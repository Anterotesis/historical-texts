            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE General Cry againſt
Stock-Jobbing has been
ſuch, and People have
been ſo long, and ſo juſtly
Complaining of it as a
publick Nuſance; and
which is ſtill worſe, have complained ſo long
without a Remedy, that the Jobbers, harden'd
in Crime, are at laſt come to exceed all
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1189201200:3"/>
bounds, and now, if ever, ſleeping Juſtice
will awake, and take ſome Notice of them,
and if it ſhould not now, yet the diligem
Creatures are ſo ſteddy to themſelves, that
they will ſome time or other, make it abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
neceſſary to the Government to demoliſh
them.</p>
            <p>I know they upon all Occaſions laugh at the
Suggeſtion, and have the Pride to think it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable
to reſtrain them; and one of the
top of the Function the other Day, when I
caſually told him, That if they went on, they
wou'd make it abſolutely neceſſary to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature,
to ſuppreſs them, return'd, That he
believ'd it was as abſolutely neceſſary for 'em
to do it now, as ever it could be; But how will
they do it? 'Tis impoſſible, ſaid he, but if the
Government takes Credit, their Funds ſhould
come to Market; and while there is a Market
we will buy and ſell; there is no effectual way
in the World, ſays he, to ſuppreſs us but this,
<hi>viz.</hi> That the Government ſhould firſt pay
all the publick Debts, redeem all the Funds,
and diſſolve all the Charters, <hi>viz. Bank, South-Sea,</hi>
and <hi>Eaſt-India,</hi> and buy nothing upon
Truſt, and then, indeed, ſays he, they need
not hang the Stock-Jobbers, for they will be
apt to hang them ſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:1189201200:4"/>
I muſt confeſs, I in part agree that this is
an effectual way, but I am far from thinking
it the only way to deal with a Confederati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Uſurers, who having ſold the whole
Nation to Uſury, keep the Purſe-Strings of
Poor and Rich in their Hands, which they
open and ſhut as they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>But before I come to the needful ways for
reſtraining thoſe People, I think 'twill be of
ſome Service to expoſe their Practices to
common view, that the People may ſee a
little what kind of Dealers they are.</p>
            <p>And firſt, they have this peculiar to 'em, and
in which they out-do all the particular pieces
of publick Knavery that ever I met with in the
World, <hi>viz.</hi> That they have nothing to ſay for
it themſelves; they have, indeed a particular
Stock of hard Ware, as the Braziers call it, in
their Faces, to bear them out in it; but if you
talk to them of their Occupation, there is not
a Man but will own, 'tis a compleat Syſtem of
Knavery; that 'tis a Trade founded in Fraud,
born of Deceit, and nouriſhed by Trick, Cheat,
Wheedle, Forgeries, Falſhoods, and all ſorts
of Deluſions; Coining falſe News, this way
good, that way bad; whiſpering imaginary
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1189201200:5"/>
Terrors, Frights, Hopes, Expectations, and
then preying upon the Weakneſs of thoſe,
whoſe Imaginations they have wrought upon,
whom they have either elevated or depreſs'd.
If they meet with a Cull, a young Dealer
that has Money to lay out, they catch him at
the Door, whiſper to him, Sir, here is a great
piece of News, it is not yet publick, it is worth
a Thouſand Guineas but to mention it: I am
heartily glad I met you, but it muſt be as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
as the black ſide of your Soul, for they
know nothing of it yet in the Coffee-Houſe,
if they ſhould, Stock would riſe 10 <hi>per Cent.</hi> in
a moment, and I warrant you <hi>South-Sea</hi> will
be 130 in a Week's Time, after it is known.
Well, ſays the weak Creature, prethee dear
<hi>Tom</hi> what is it? Why really Sir I will <hi>let you
into the Secret,</hi> upon your Honour to keep it till
you hear it from other Hands; why 'tis this,
<hi>The Pretender is certainly taken</hi> and is carried
Priſoner to the Caſtle of <hi>Millan,</hi> there they have
him faſt; I aſſure you, the Government had an
Expreſs of it from my Lord <hi>St----s</hi> within this
Hour. Are you ſure of it, ſays the Fiſh, who
jumps eagerly into the Net? Sure of it! why if
you will take your Coach and go up to the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries-Office,
you may be ſatisfied of it your
ſelf, and be down again in Two Hours, and in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1189201200:6"/>
the mean time I will be doing ſomething, tho'
it is but little, till you return.</p>
            <p>Away goes the Gudgeon with his Head full
of Wildfire, and a Squib in his Brain, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to the Place, meets a Croney at the Door,
who ignorantly confirms the Report, and ſo
ſets fire to the Mine; for indeed the Cheat
came too far to be baulkt at home: So that
without giving himſelf Time to conſider, he
hurries back full of the Deluſions, dreaming of
nothing but of getting a Hundred Thouſand
Pounds, or purchaſe Two; and even this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
was to be gotten only upon the Views of
his being before-hand with other People.</p>
            <p>In this Elevation, he meets his Broker, who
throws more Fire-works into the Mine, and
blows him up to ſo fierce an Inflamation, that
he employs him inſtantly to take Guineas to
accept Stock of any Kind, and almoſt at any
Price; for the News being now publick, the
Artiſt made their Price upon him. In a
Word, having accepted them for Fifty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Pounds more than he is able to pay,
the Jobber has got an Eſtate, the Broker 2 or
300 Guineas, and the Eſquire remains at Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to ſell his Coach and Horſes, his fine Seat
and rich Furniture, to make good the Defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1189201200:7"/>
of his Bear-Skins, and at laſt, when all
will not go through it, he muſt give them a
Bruſh for the reſt.</p>
            <p>There are who tell us, that the <hi>Exchange-Alley</hi>
Improvements made upon the News of
the Pretender's being taken, were part of the
Plot, that the late Earl of <hi>Mar</hi> having concerted
the Voyage of <hi>Voghera,</hi> and how and in what
Manner the Report of the Pretender's being
there ſhould ſpread, who it ſhould amuſe, and
how at one Blow it ſhould ſpread Eaſt to <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna,</hi>
and North-Weſt to <hi>Paris,</hi> and ſo on; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
not to contrive it, as at once ſhould ſerve
Political Ends in <hi>Italy</hi> and at <hi>Vienna:</hi> So on
the other hand, it ſhould not fail to ſerve a
private View in <hi>Exchange-Alley,</hi> and at the
ſame time that he deceiv'd ſome of the Whiggs
who he ow'd a large Grudge to for ſhrew'd
Turns at <hi>Preſton</hi> and <hi>Dumblain,</hi> he might alſo
raiſe a Tax upon them towards the incident
Charges of his wandring Circumſtances.</p>
            <p>I do not averr this Story to be true, but the
Concert is ſo exact, and the Nature of it ſo
agreeable to the Stock-jobbing Art, nay and
to the Artiſts alſo, whoſe Correſpondents are
very punctual, eſpecially ſince it is ſaid, that
Mr. T—s chief Agent was formerly my
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1189201200:8"/>
Lord <hi>M—r</hi>'s Broker; that I wont affirm it
may be true; but this I will venture to ſay of
it, That if we are often ſerv'd thus, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender
may very eaſily raiſe a Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Pounds a Year in <hi>Exchange-Alley,</hi> for the
carrying on an Invaſion, and lay the Tax
wholly upon his Enemies the Whigs, which,
by the way, I leave them to conſider of.</p>
            <p>But now that I may make good the Charge
(<hi>viz.</hi>) that the whole Art and Myſtery is a
meer Original Syſtem of Cheat and Deluſion;
I muſt let you ſee too, that this Part of the
Comedy may be very well call'd, <hi>A Bite for
the Biter;</hi> for which I muſt go back to the
Broker and his Gudgeon. The Money'd Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
finding himſelf let into the Secret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
, and that he was bitten to the Tune of
30000 l. worſe than nothing. After he had
unhappily paid as far as his ready Money
wou'd go, of which Piece of Honeſty they ſay
he has heartily repented, <hi>and is in Hopes all that
come after him will forgive him for the ſake of what
follow'd,</hi> ſtopt ſhort, as he might well, you'll
ſay, when his Money was all gone, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
himſelf, What am la doing! I have paid
away all this Money like a Fool, I was
drawn in like an Aſs, by the eager Deſire of
Biting my Neighbours to a vaſt Sum, and I
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1189201200:9"/>
have been Fool enough in that, but I have been
ten Thouſand times a worſe Fool, to pay a Groat
of the Money, eſpecially ſince I knew I could
not pay it all: Beſides, who but I would have
forgot the Nature of the Thing I was dealing
in, and of the People I was dealing with;
why, is it not all a meer Body of Knavery?
Is not the whole Doctrine of Stock-Jobbing a
Science of Fraud? And are not all the Dealers,
meer Original Thieves and Pick-Pockets? Nay,
do they not own it themſelves? Have not I
heard <hi>T. W. B. O.</hi> and <hi>J. S.</hi> a thouſand times
ſay they know their Employment was a Branch
of Highway Robbing, and only differ'd in
two things, <hi>Firſt in Degree,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi>) that it was
ten Thouſand times worſe, more remorſeleſs,
more void of Humanity, done without Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
and committed upon Fathers, Brothers,
Widows, Orphans, and intimate Friends;
in all which Caſes, Highwaymen, generally
touch'd with Remorſe, and affected with Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Humanity and Generoſity, ſtopt ſhort
and chooſe to prey upon Strangers only. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
in Danger,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi>) that theſe rob ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
; the other, with the utmoſt Riſque that
the Highwaymen run, at the Hazard of their
Lives, being ſure to be hang'd firſt or laſt,
whereas theſe rob only at the Hazard of their
Reputation which is generally loſt before they
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1189201200:10"/>
begin, and of their Souls, which Trifle is not
worth the mentioning. Have not I, I ſay,
heard my Broker Mr. ........ ſay all this,
and much more? And have not I alſo heard
him ſay, <q rend="inline">'That no Man was obliged to make
good any of their <hi>Exchange-Alley</hi> Bargains,
unleſs he pleaſed, and unleſs he was in haſte
to part with his Money, which indeed I am
not: And has not all the Brokers and Job<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, when they have been bitten too hard,
ſaid the ſame thing, and refuſed to pay'?<p>'Pray, how much did Old <hi>Cudworth, Ph.
C....p....m,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Goo......g</hi> Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Jobbers, Monarchs in their Days of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change-Alley,</hi>
break for? And how much did
they ever pay? One, if I miſtake not, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
at laſt for one Penny <hi>per</hi> Pound,
and the other Two for ſomething leſs'.</p>
                  <p>'In a Word, they are all a Gang of Rogues
and Cheats, and I'll pay none of them: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
my Lawyer, Sir <hi>Thomas Subtle,</hi> tells
me, there's not a Man of them dares ſue
me; <hi>No, tho' I had no Protection to fly to,</hi> and
he ſtates the Caſe thus:'</p>
                  <p>'You have Sir (<hi>ſays Subtle</hi>) contracted to

220, <hi>Bank</hi> at 160, <hi>South-Sea</hi> 120, and the
like. <hi>Very well,</hi> they come to put it upon
you, the Stock being ſince fallen; tell them
you cannot take it yet: If they urge your
Contract, and demand when you will take
it, <hi>tell them,</hi> you will take it when you
think fit.'</p>
                  <p>'If they ſwagger, call Names, as Rogue,
Cheat, <hi>and the like,</hi> tell them, <hi>as to that,</hi>
you are all of a Fraternity; there is no
great Matter in it, whether you Cheat them,
or they Cheat you; 'tis as it happens in the
Way of Trade, that it all belongs to the
Craft; and as the Devil's Broker, <hi>Whiſton,</hi>
ſaid to Parſon <hi>Giffard,</hi> tell them you are all
of a Trade: If they Rage, and tell you the
Devil will have you, and ſuch as that; <hi>tell
them,</hi> they ſhould let the Devil and you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
to agree about that, 'tis none of their
Buſineſs: But when he comes for you, tell
them you would adviſe them to <hi>keep out of

It muſt be confeſs'd, that if the projected
Story of the taking the Pretender was acted in
Concert between <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Exchange-Alley,</hi>
between my Lord <hi>Marr,</hi> and a certain Broker
as Fame reports, either the Broker is the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
of a Jacobite, or my Lord the Devil of a
Broker; it muſt be acknowledg'd 'twas a far
fetch'd Trick, and anſwer'd the End in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
moſt admirably.</p>
            <p>Nor can all the World tell us any other End
that it could anſwer, for as to the Pretences of
deluding the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> on Shore, or the
<hi>Britiſh</hi> Men of War at Sea, and ſo the better
to facilitate the Eſcape of the Pretender to
<hi>Spain,</hi> I undertake to prove, that this is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd
and ridiculous, for the Pretender was
Embark'd at <hi>Netunna,</hi> and gone away to Sea
thirteen Days at leaſt, before this Whim of
People taken at <hi>Voghera</hi> was talk'd of.</p>
            <p>As to the Amuſements among the Courtsa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <hi>Vienna, Paris</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> they amounted to
nothing at all, anſwer'd no End, neither
prompted any Deſign on one hand, or hindred
any Thing on the other: In a Word, we may
challenge the World, to tell us any one Turn
that was ſerv'd by it, or End anſwer'd by it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but this in <hi>Exchange-Alley.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:1189201200:14"/>
Nor was this ſo inconſiderable a Deſign, as
not to be worth while to form ſuch a Juggle,
tho' a great way off; and as far off as it is, if
we may believe the Report of thoſe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the Machines and Contrivances of
that Original of Stock-Jobbing, Sir <hi>J--- C----</hi> There
are thoſe who tell us, Letters have been
order'd, by private Management, to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
from the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> with an Account of
the Loſs of Ships which have been arriv'd
there, and the Arrival of Ships loſt; of War
which the <hi>Great Mogul,</hi> when they have been
in perfect Tranquility, and of Peace with
the <hi>Great Mogul,</hi> when he was come down
againſt the Factory of <hi>Bengale</hi> with One Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Thouſand Men, juſt as it was, thought
proper to calculate thoſe Rumours for the
Raiſing and Falling of the Stock, and when
it was for his Purpoſe to but cheap, or ſell
dear.</p>
            <p>It would be endleſs to give an Account of
the Subtiltics of that Capital Che....t, when
he had a Deſign to Bite the whole <hi>Exchange:</hi>
As he was the leading Hand to the Market, ſo
he kept it in his Power to ſet the Price to all
the Dealers. The Subject then was clrie fly the
<hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Stock, tho' there were other Stocks
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1189201200:15"/>
on foot too, tho' ſince ſunk to nothing; ſuch as
the <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s-Bay Company, the Linnen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture
Stock, Paper Stock, Salt-Petre Stock
and others, all at this Day worſe than nothing,
tho' ſome of them then Jobb'd up to 350 <hi>per
Cent.</hi> as the two firſt in particular.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Stock was the main Point,
every Man's Eye, when he came to Market,
was upon the Broker's, who acted for Sir <hi>J—</hi> Does
Sir <hi>J—</hi> Sell or Buy? If Sir <hi>J—</hi> had a
Mind to buy, the firſt thing he did was to
Commiſſion his Brokers to look ſower, ſhake
their Heads, ſuggeſt bad News from <hi>India;</hi>
and at the Bottom it follow'd, I have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
from Sir <hi>J—</hi> to ſell out whatever I
can, and perhaps they would actually ſell Ten,
perhaps Twenty Thouſand Pound; immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the <hi>Exchange</hi> (for they were not then come
to the <hi>Alley</hi>) was full of Sellers; no Body
would buy a Shilling, till perhaps the Stock
would fall Six, Seven, Eight, Ten <hi>per Cent.</hi>
ſometimes more; then the Cunning Jobber had
another Sett of Men employ'd on purpoſe to
buy, but with Privacy and Caution, all the
Stock they could lay their Hands on, 'till by
ſelling Ten Thouſand Pound, at 4 or 5 <hi>per
Cent.</hi> loſt, he would buy a Hundred Thouſand
Pound Stock, at 10 or 12 <hi>per Cent.</hi> under Price;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1189201200:16"/>
and in a few Weeks by juſt the contrary Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
, ſet them all a buying, and then ſell
them their own Stock again at ten or twelve
<hi>per Cent.</hi> Profit.</p>
            <p>Theſe honeſt Methods laid the Foundation,
we will not ſay of a fine great Stone Houſe,
on a certain Forreſt, but it certainly laid the
Foundation of an Opulent Family, and iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated
the Crowd of Jobbers on that dexterity
in tricking and cheating one another, which
to this Day they are the greateſt Proficients,
that this part of the World ever ſaw.</p>
            <p>To come a little nearer home, We had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Gentleman, who, from a ſmall Beginning,
came to leave, <hi>as they ſay who ſpeak of the leaſt,</hi>
250000<hi>l.</hi> behind him, and yet did not die an
old Man neither. This Knight, to avoid as
much as poſſible, Reflections upon the Aſhes
of the Dead, added to the former Craft, that of
bringing ſudden News into <hi>Exchange-Alley,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated
to the Wagers he had to lay, or to any
he had to hedge off, and by this gain'd immenſe
Sums of Money (where he living I ſhould give it
an harder Name.) Why ſhould it be thought ſo
ſtrange, that my Lord <hi>Marr</hi> and his Broker
ſhould trump up a Story from <hi>Italy,</hi> ſend a
Sett of Poſt-Chaiſes with Gentlemen in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1189201200:17"/>
out of the way of all Road, to be taken
up in the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> and ſent to the Caſtle, and
then ſent word to a Great Man in <hi>England,</hi>
who is a BELIEVER, that it was the Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
, and all this to raiſe the Price of Stocks,
and put it upon the Whiggs. I ſay, Why
ſhould this be more ſtrange than that Sir <hi>H— F—ſe,</hi>
in the late King <hi>William</hi>'s Reign, was
able to maintain ſuch a conſtant Intelligence
in <hi>Holland, Flanders, Germany, Ireland,</hi> &amp;c.
that he ſeveral times brought the King Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
of Battles fought, Victories won, Towns
taken, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before the ſwifteſt Expreſſes of
the King's own Servants and Generals could ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
; and had once a Diamond Ring of 500<hi>l.</hi>
given him by the King for his early News.</p>
            <p>By this exactly concerted Intelligence, he
then knew how to turn the Wagers (a ſort of
Jobbing then in Mode, and which grew ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
that they were at length oblig'd to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
it by Act of Parliament) which way he
pleaſed; and by which he got an immenſe Sum
of Money. How often did the Gentleman run
down true News as if it had been falſe, and
run up falſe News as if it had been true, by the
Force of his Foreign Intelligeneers, how often
coin Reports of great Actions to ſerve a Turn;
it is too late a Trick to be forgot, by many
that were hit by it to the Bone.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:1189201200:18"/>
In a word, they putting falſe News upon us
is nothing but an old Trade reviv'd, tho' it
muſt be confeſs'd, this of the Pretender has
been a Maſter-Piece, and the worthy Projector
who has the Credit of it, muſt paſs for a dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
Manager as any the Univerſity of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change-Alley,</hi>
has bred up for 30 Years paſt.</p>
            <p>It had alſo one Particular in it, for which
it was very remarkable; Sham Reports, Falſe
News, Foreign Letters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are Things that
have been often trumpt upon us, as above, and
the Town have been not long ago cheated to a
good round Sum that Way: But then they have
been ſoon detected, the Morning News has
been ſet to rights in the Afternoon, or the
Evening's Heat has cool'd by Morning: But
this Trick had a fatal Duration, for it held us
near a Fortnight in a firm Perſwaſion of the
Thing; and even then it continued, but ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
only for ſome time longer, and was
yet longer before it was fully detected, and
even at laſt it was hardly conquered till the
Jacobites laugh us out of it, and the Pretender
was look'd for nearer Home.</p>
            <p>The Aſſurance with which it was carry'd
about, the ſeveral Places from whence it was
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1189201200:19"/>
written, made it ſo effectually be ſwallow'd
down, that really People ſaw no room to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
the Truth of it for a great while. 'Twas
written from <hi>Rome,</hi> from <hi>Leghorn,</hi> from <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noa,</hi>
from <hi>Turin,</hi> and from <hi>Paris:</hi> Nay, 'twas
even believ'd at Court, and almoſt every
where elſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Exquiſite Fraud!</hi> who could have believed
this had been born in <hi>Exchange-Alley,</hi> ſent
over to <hi>Rome,</hi> agreed to there and executed
in ſuch a Manner as to cheat not the Town
only, but all Europe.</p>
            <p>The Authority that every one found at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temded
the Report, ſupported it ſo that it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd
us all, even thoſe whoſe Concern for the
Fact extorted Tears from them were not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceiv
'd. Thus the Huckſters had Time to
play their Game, and they made Hay while
the Sun ſhone; for if we may believe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Fame, Bargains, Contracts and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for Stocks, Bear-Skins included, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
in that time to ſome Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
of Pounds, nay, ſome ſay to Two Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
and better, moſt of which was to the
Loſs of the <hi>Believing</hi> Party.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:1189201200:20"/>
But what Tricking, what Fraud, what lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Plots as deep as Hell, and as far as the
ends of the Earth is here? What Cheating of
Fathers, and Mothers, and Brothers, gulling
Widows, Orphans, couzening the moſt Wary,
and plundering the Unwary? And how much
meaner Roberies than theſe bring the Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
even to the Gallows every Seſſions?</p>
            <p>But I muſt not ſtop here, the Story of the
Pretender is over, that Trump is play'd, and
the artful Gameſter's wanting a new Trick,
after having play'd ſo many already, that
one would think Invention was at an end,
yet they have found it out, and we are juſt
led into the Secret.</p>
            <p>Hitherto Craft and Knavery appears to be
their Method, but we ſhall trace them now
a little further, and like true Haſſars that
plunder not the Enemy only, but their own
Army, as the Opportunity preſents; ſo theſe
Men are now come to prey upon the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Let us look into the late Lotteries, had not
a piercing Eye detected the Rognery, and not
the fall of other things taken off the Edge of the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1189201200:21"/>
Peoples Fancy for venturing, theſe Artiſts
had brought up the Tickets to 16<hi>s.</hi> a-piece ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
, even before the Act was paſs'd. That
this could not be but by ſecuring the Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all the Tickets in their own hands, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
ſuch ſelect Tickets as were not to come to
<hi>Market.</hi> I <hi>ſay,</hi> that this could not be but by
Connivance, and this every one knows; and
that this Connivance again could not be but
by ſome higher People than thoſe that were
nam'd to it; this alſo every one may know,
who they were is none of my Buſineſs to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
, tho' 'tis eaſy to gueſs. 'Tis very hard
when our Stateſmen come into a Confederacy
to bite the People, and when Dukes turn Stock-Jobbers
: Yet that this was done is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
, and what was this but making a Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Power that might be in their Hands,
the better to bite the People: For if the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
appointed 500,000<hi>l.</hi> in Tickets to be
given out at a certain Rate that was low and
reaſonable, was it not to encourage the People
on whom the reſt of the National Burthen lies?
And if by the Craft and Knavery of Jobbers
the People are made to pay 600,000<hi>l.</hi> for
them, <hi>which is much about the Caſe,</hi> pray why
not pay the Hundred Thouſand Pounds to the
Publick, either to pay off a Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Pounds of Debt, or to make the Burthen
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1189201200:22"/>
of the current Year a Hundred Thouſand
Pounds lighter, of which I am ſure there is
need enough.</p>
            <p>It has been indeed our Happineſs, that a
worthy Member being inform'd of this abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
Cheat, detected it, and laid it before
the Houſe; upon which a Vote was paſt to
make void all Bargains made for Tickets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Act was paſt; ſo the Biters were Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; and a certain Sir <hi>George -----</hi> was oblig'd
to refund; but the Roguery of the Deſign
was never a Jot the leſs for that.</p>
            <p>But the fatal Influences of this growing
Evil does not end here, and I muſt trace
Stock-jobbing now to its new acquir'd Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of intermeddling with the Publick, aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Rebellion, encouraging Invaſion; and if
I do not bring the Stock-jobbers, even the
Whigs among them, to be guilty of Treaſon
againſt their King and Country, and that of
the worſt Kind too, then I do nothing.</p>
            <p>Had the Stock-jobbers been all Jacobites by
Profeſſion, or had the Employment led them,
by the Neceſſity of their Buſineſs to put King
and Nation, and particularly their own, to Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
and Sale; and had the ſelling of News
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>een their Property, and they had an Act of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1189201200:23"/>
Parliament, or Patent, to entitle them to the
ſole Privilege of impoſing what falſe Things
they pleaſed on the People, I ſhould have had
much the leſs Reaſon to have complain'd of
their Roguery, and have rather turn'd my
ſelf to the reſt of them People, who are the
Subject they work upon, and only have ſtood
at <hi>Exchange-Alley</hi> End, and cried out, <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
, have a care of your Pockets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, had it been a private Club, or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of Men, acting one among another, had
the Cheats, the Frauds, and the Tricks they
daily make uſe of, <hi>in which the Engliſh Rogue
was a Fool to them,</hi> been practis'd upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
only; and like Gameſters at a publick
Board, they had only play'd with thoſe that
came there to play with them; in this Caſe
alſo I ſhould have held my Tongue, and only
put them in mind of an old Song; every
<hi>Stanza</hi> of which chim'd in with <hi>Tantararand,</hi>
Rogues all, Rogues all.</p>
            <p>But when we find this Trade become a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical
Vice, a publick Crime, and that as it is
now carried on, it appears dangerous to the
Publick, that whenever any Wickedneſs is it
Hand, any Miſchief by the worſt of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
Enemies upon the Wheel, the Stock
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1189201200:24"/>
Jobbers are naturally made aſſiſtant to it, that
they become Abettors of Treaſon, aſſiſtant to
Rebellion and Invaſion, then it is certainly
time to ſpeak, for the very Employment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
a Crime, and we are oblig'd to expoſe
a Sort of Men, who are more dangerous than
a whole Nation of Enemies Abroad, an Evil
more formidable then the Peſtilence, and in
their Practiſe more fatal to the Publick than
an Invaſion of <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is ſaid by ſome, that the principal Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in the Jobbing Trade at that Time, and
at whom moſt part of the Satyr in this Work
ought to be pointed, are Whigs, Members of
Parliament, and Friends to the Government;
and that the refore I had beſt have a Care of
what I ſay of them.</p>
            <p>My firſt Anſwer is, <hi>So I will.</hi> I will have
a Care of them, and in the next Place let them
have a Care of me; for if I ſhould ſpeak the
whole Truth of ſome of them, they might be
Whigs; but I dare ſay, they would be neither
P.......men, or Friends to the Government
very long, and it is very hard his Majeſty
ſhould not be told what kind of Friends to
him ſuch Men are.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:1189201200:25"/>
Beſides, I deny the Fact; theſe Men Friends
to the Government! <hi>Jeſu Maria!</hi> The Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may be friendly to them in a manner
they do not deſerve; but as to their being
Friends to the Government, that is no more
poſſible than the Cardinal <hi>Alberoni,</hi> or the
<hi>Chevalier de St. George</hi> are Friends to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and therefore without reflecting
upon Perſons, naming Names, or the like;
<hi>there will be no need of Names, the Dreſs will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
them,</hi> I lay down this new faſhion'd Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
or <hi>Poſtulatum,</hi> take it which way you
pleaſe, that I will make it out by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
of what I am going to ſay.<list>
                  <item>1. That Stock-jobbing, as it is now practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and as is generally underſtood by the
Word Stock-jobbing, is neither leſs or more
than High-Treaſon in its very Nature, and
in its Conſequences.</item>
                  <item>2. That the Stock-jobbers, who are guilty
of the Practices I am going to detect, are even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
Traytors to King <hi>George,</hi> and to his
Government, Family and Intereſt, and to
their Country, and deſerve to be uſed at leaſt
as Confederates with Traytors, when ever
there are any alarms of Invaſions, Rebellions,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1189201200:26"/>
or any ſecret Practices againſt the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
, of what Kind ſoever.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>This is a black Charge, and boldly laid, and
ought therefore to be effectually made out,
which ſhall be the Work of a few Pages in
the following Sheets.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> I lay down this as a Rule, which I
appeal to the Laws of Reaſon to ſupport, that
all thoſe People, who at a Time of publick
Danger, whether of treaſonable Invaſion from
Abroad, or trayterous Attempts to raiſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections
at Home, ſhall willingly and
wittingly abett, aſſiſt, or encourage the
Traytors, Invading or Rebelling, are equally
guilty of Treaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> All thoſe who ſhall endeavour to
weaken, diſappoint and diſable the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in their Preparations, or diſcourage the
People in their aſſiſting the Government to
oppoſe the Rebels or Invadors, are guilty of
Treaſon.</p>
            <p>All that can be alledg'd in Contradiction to
this, and perhaps that could not be made our
neither, is, That they are not Traytors within
the Letter of the Law; to which I anſwer
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1189201200:27"/>
if they were, I ſhould not Satyrize them, but
Impeach them. But if it appears that they
are as effectually deſtructive to the Peace and
Safety of the Government, and of the King's
Perſon and Family, as if they were in open
War with his Power, I do the ſame Thing,
and fully anſwer the End propoſed.</p>
            <p>As there are many Thieves beſides Houſe-Breakers
, Highway-Men, Lifters and Pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pockets
, ſo there are many Traytors, beſides
Rebels and Invaders, and perhaps of a much
worſe Kind; for as in a Diſpute between a
certain Lord, and a Woman of Pleaſure in
the Town, about the different Virtue of the
Sexes, the Lady inſiſted that the Men were
Agreſſors in the Vice, and that in plain <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi>
if there were no Whore-Maſters, there
would be no Whores: So, in a Word, if there
were no Parties at Home, no Diſaffection, no
Traytors among our ſelves, there would be
no Invaſions from Abroad.</p>
            <p>Now I will ſuppoſe for the Purpoſe only,
that the People I am ſpeaking of were not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected
to the Government; I mean, not origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
, and intentionally pointing their Deſign at
the Government; nay, that they are hearty
Whigs, call them as we pleaſe; yet if it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear

To bring this home to the Caſe in view, who
were the Men, who in the late Hurry of an
expected Invaſion, ſunk the Price of Stocks 14
to 15 <hi>per Cent?</hi> Who were the Men that made
a run upon the <hi>Bank</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and puſht at
them with ſome particular Pique too, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
to have run them down, and brought
'em to a Stop of Payment? And what was the
Conſequences of theſe Things? Will they tell
us that running upon the <hi>Bank,</hi> and lowering
the Stocks, was no Treaſon? We know, that
litterally ſpeaking, thoſe things are no Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:
But is there not a plain conſtructive
Treaſon in the Conſequences of it? Is
not a wilful running down the publick Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
, at a Time when the Nation is threaten'd
with an Invaſion from Abroad, and Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
at Home? Is not this adding to the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
of the People? Is not this diſabling the
Government, diſcouraging the King's Friends,
and a viſible Encouragement of the King's
Enemies? Is not all that is taken from the
Credit of the Publick, on ſuch an Occaſion,
added to the Credit of the Invaſion? Does not
every thing that weakens the Government,
ſtrengthen its Enemies? And is not every Step
that is taken in Prejudice of the King's Intereſt
a Step taken in Aid of the deſign'd Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion?
The kindeſt thing that can be ſaid of a
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1189201200:30"/>
certain Triumvirate of Jobbers, whoſe Hands
have been deepeſt in this Part of the Work,
and who indeed had more Obligations upon
them than any other Men in the Town, to
have aſſiſted the Publick Intereſt, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the Credit of the Nation is, that they did
not think what they did, and that this Excuſe
may not ſerve them another Time, I may ſoon
furniſh them with an Anatomy of ſome of the
Conduct of that little Body of <hi>Number Three,</hi>
that when they ſee their Miſtakes with the
Eyes that other Men ſee them, they may at
their Leiſure give a better Turn to the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of Unbounded Avarice.</p>
            <p>And now that I may not be ſaid to ſpeak
without a Precedent, I humbly refer to thoſe
money'd Gentlemen to a Caſe recent in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
, and even in their own, which tho' in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they may think fit to have forgotten for
a time, they will all call to mind when they
hear of it again; and this was the Caſe of
two Goldſmiths (Knights alſo, and one of
them Member of Parliament too) in <hi>Fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet,</hi>
who puſh'd at the Bank of <hi>England</hi> at
the Time that the Pretender's Invaſion from
<hi>France</hi> was in its Preparation: One of them,
it was ſaid, had gather'd a quantity of Bank-Bills
to the value of near 100,000 l. and the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1189201200:31"/>
other, a great Sum, tho' not ſo many, and it
was ſaid, reſolv'd to demand them all at once.</p>
            <p>Let the Gentlement I point at look back
to the printed Papers that Year, let them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
what Conſtruction was put upon it; let
them enquire how the Government reſented
it, how my Lord Treaſurer <hi>Godolphin</hi> look'd
upon it as a Mine form'd to blow up the
Queen's Affairs, and how, in a Word, all the
Friends of the Government took it to be ſuch
a Step in favour of the Pretender, as was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to conſiſt with Duty to the Queen.</p>
            <p>Let them enquire further, with what Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
Sir <hi>R— H—</hi> wip'd off the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of being a Favourer of the Rebellion,
and how often, in vain, he proteſted, he did it
with no ſuch View, and how hard the Whiggs
were to believe him. Sir <hi>F— C—d</hi> indeed
carry'd it with a higher Hand, and afterwards
pretended to refuſe the Bills of the Bank;
but ſtill declar'd he did it as a Goldſmith,
and as a piece of Juſtice to himſelf, in ſome
Points in which the Bank had, as he alledg'd,
us'd him ill. But in general, it was look'd
upon as an open Affront to the Government,
and an abetting and countenancing the Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Pretender from Abroad, and the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1189201200:32"/>
Rebellion intended at Home: Nor was the
Government, much leſs were the Authors of
private Papers and Prints, wanting, in let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them know it; nay, if I am not miſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
'd, they were threatned with being trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as Enemies to the Government, and if
Things had gone on to Extremities, they had
doubtleſs been mark'd out as Perſons the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
were to take care of.</p>
            <p>Now I only ſpeak in plainer Words; It was
ſaid then, that ſuch Men as endeavour'd to
run down the Publick Credit, were Enemies
to the Government. I know no Diſtinction in
the Caſe, that ſhould require ſo much Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
every Subject of King <hi>George,</hi> who is at
the ſame time an Enemy to King <hi>George,</hi> is a
Traytor, and every Overt-Act of that Enmity
it being his Duty to his utmoſt to favour, aid
and ſupport the Government, is an Overt
Act of Treaſon, let it be gilded over with
what fine Words the Perſons pleaſe, 'tis the
ſame thing, if it is not literal Treaſon, and
within reach of the Statute, yet the Crime is
in it ſelf of the ſame Nature.</p>
            <p>And let any one tell me, what is the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between two Dealers in Paper Credit in
the time of a <hi>French</hi> Invaſion, and three
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1189201200:33"/>
Dealers in Paper-Credit in the time of a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>
Invaſion, or what Sanctity in <hi>Birchin-Lane</hi>
more than in <hi>Fleet-ſtreet,</hi> that one ſhould
be a Protection for the ſame Practice that
was reſented ſo juſtly in another.</p>
            <p>Were thoſe Stock-jobbers ſincerely and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
in the Intereſt of King <hi>George</hi> and his
Government, as they pretend loudly, what
Run could there be upon the Bank, what Ebb
of Credit, what ſinking of Stock: The honeſt
Whiggs who were Friends to the Government
at that Time mention'd above, who not only
knew their Duty, but how to make it ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and uſeful, acted after another Manner,
when others run upon the Bank with all the
Fury poſſible, they carry'd all the Money thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they could gather up: Nay, I could name
a Man in this City, who having but 500 in
the World, carry'd it all into the Bank to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
the Credit of the Publick; and the Story
being told to her Majeſty by the late Lord
Treaſurer <hi>Godolphin:</hi> The Senſe of ſuch Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
ſo mov'd the Queen, that ſhe ſent him
a Hundred Pounds as a Gift, a Royal Token
of her accepting ſuch an Act of Loyalty; and
cauſed my Lord to give him an Obligation
from the Treaſury to repay him the whole
500<hi>l.</hi> if any Diſaſter to the Bank ſhould have
made it doubtful.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:1189201200:34"/>
Where's the like Courage and Conduct to
be found now? Is it in Being? Are the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
leſs able? Or is it that they have not the
ſame Zeal for King <hi>George</hi> as that honeſt Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
had for the Queen? Or do they doubt the
King being as ſenſible of the Service? Or what
is the matter that the Publick Credit had rather
met with injurious Juggling and Jobbing upon
it, than real Support, either from <hi>Exchange-Alley
, Birchin Lane,</hi> or ſome other Places leſs
noted.</p>
            <p>Let thoſe Men reflect a little upon the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
the Publick Credit muſt have been
in by ſuch Management, if the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Attempt
had been made, and if theſe Eaſterly Proteſtant
Winds had not chopt in, by which Providence
has given the Government Time to put it ſelf
into a Poſture of Defence, ſo as now not to be
afraid of them; and if the Capital Stock of
the Perſons intereſted in the Funds, is now
ſunk a Million in the real Value of them as
they ſtood before even at the Market, which
is nothing but what the Matter of Fact will
juſtify, to what Degree would the ſame Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
, if it had gone on, have ſunk the Eſtates
of all the Money'd Men in <hi>England?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:1189201200:35"/>
In what Manner would Money have been
rais'd upon a new Credit for any immediate
Exigencies that might have happened? And
ſhould the Goverment have been ſupported,
nay though the Parliament had granted Funds,
while theſe Men had made all Credit ebb, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
, to 25 or 30 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Diſcount; and is
not this then a Species of Treaſon and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
.</p>
            <p>It was very remarkable, that in the Juncture
of thoſe Things the Jacobites could not refrain
taking notice how eaſie it was to ſet the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
a plundering the Bank, and even the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer
too; for had this gone on, the Funds
which are in effect the Exchequer it ſelf, would
have gone down Hill, Hand in Hand with the
Bank; Credit would have borne equal Pace
in one as well as in the other, and the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
would no more have been able to borrow
than the Bank would have been able to pay.</p>
            <p>It is ſcarce fit to enter into a Deſcription of
all the miſchievous Conſequences which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
follow running down the Publick
Credit, in caſe of ſuch Dangers as I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
'd above; if I ſhould fully deſcribe them,
it would appear incredible. Every one will
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1189201200:36"/>
allow that this Practice of the Jobbers, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
'd on a little further, would indeed appear
to be the worſt Kind of Treaſon.</p>
            <p>But it is needful, after having ſaid thus
much of the Crime, to ſay ſomething of the
Place, and then a little of the Perſons too;
The Center of the Jobbing is <hi>in the Kingdom</hi> of
<hi>Exchange-Alley,</hi> and its Adjacencies; the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
, are eaſily ſurrounded in about a Minute
and a half (<hi>viz.</hi>) ſtepping out of <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s into
the Alley, you turn your Face full <hi>South,</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
on a few Paces, and then turning Due
<hi>Eaſt,</hi> you advance to <hi>Garraway</hi>'s; from thence
going out at the other Door, you go on ſtill
<hi>Eaſt</hi> into <hi>Birchin-Lane,</hi> and then halting a little
at the Sword-Blade Bank to do much Miſchief
in feweſt Words, you immediately face to the
<hi>North,</hi> enter <hi>Cornhill,</hi> viſit two or three petty
Provinces there in your way <hi>Weſt:</hi> And thus
having Box'd your Compaſs, and ſail'd round
the whole Stock-jobbing Globe, you turn into
<hi>Jonathan</hi>'s again; and ſo, as moſt of the great
Follies of Life oblige as to do, you end juſt
where you began.</p>
            <p>But this is by way of Digreſſion; and even
ſtill, before I come to the main Caſe, I am
oblig'd to tell you; That though this is the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1189201200:37"/>
Sphere of the <hi>Jobbers</hi> Motion, the Orbe to
which they are confin'd, and out of which they
cannot well act <hi>in their Way;</hi> yet it does not
follow, but that Men of Foreign Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(I mean Foreign as to them, I do not
meak Foreign by Nation) and of different
Figure are ſeen among them; nay, ſome
whoſe Luſtre is ſaid to be too bright for the

with ſuch indefatigable Application, that

a Minute, however remote from one another:
Where-ever he appears, he makes an <hi>Exchange-Alley</hi>
in his Perſon, and <hi>a Court</hi> in his Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
: He is himſelf a <hi>Jonathans-Coſſee-houſe</hi>

<hi>Exchange-Alley</hi> in every Place; and yet he
rather is directed than directs, and like a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

Thieving; He inherits the Face of <hi>C—,</hi>
with the Crafr of <hi>S—,</hi> but ſeems to take

more than either; yet even this too is all Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mace

aimed at the BANK, but there they were

            <p>However, their Wings being clipt by the

(<hi>viz.</hi>) That no Society, Corporation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould

, and had they not found a Man that
had as much Money as themſelves, and more
Honeſty, that Bargain of the Forfeited Eſtates
had been the laſt they had made in the World.</p>
            <p>The Endeavours they uſe to cheat that
Gentleman, after he had deliver'd them from
a Blow that would have blown them up (is
another black Part of their Story that remains

            <p>Now they ſtand ready, as Occaſion offers,

They had another Flap with a Fox-Tail,
to the Scandal of their Politicks in the late
Vote about the Tickets of the Lottery which
I mentioned above; what Market they will
make of it is well enough known: But the
Plot was never the leſs Cunning, and 'tis
certain the Knavery is not the leſs viſible for
the Miſcarriage. I come next to their more
modern Management.</p>
            <p>Whenever they call in their Money the
<hi>Stock-Jobbers</hi> muſt ſell; the <hi>Bear-skin Men</hi> muſt
commute, and pay Difference money; then
down come the Stocks, tumbling Two or Three
<hi>per Cent.</hi> then the Tools muſt ſell, and then
Maſters buy; the next Week they take in
Stocks again, then the Jobbers buy, and the
Managers ſell. Thus the Jobbers bite their
Friends, and theſe Men bite the Jobbers, <hi>qui
Sarpat Sharpabitur, Exchange-Alley Latin;</hi> they
that are let into the Secret will underſtand it.</p>
            <p>The Truth is, it has been foretold by cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Men, who often ſee what can't be hid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that theſe Men, by a Maſs of Money which
they command of other Peoples, as well as
their own, will, in Time, ruin the Jobbing
Trade. But 'twill be only like a general Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation,
where all Diſtempers are ſwallow'd
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1189201200:42"/>
up in the Plague, like a common Calamity,
that makes Enemies turn Friends, and drowns
leſſer Grievances in the general Deluge. For
if the Repriſal Trade ſhould adjourn from
<hi>Exchange-Alley</hi> to <hi>Birchin-Lane,</hi> it may ſeem to
be like the baniſhing Uſury from the City
of <hi>Rome,</hi> which transferr'd it to a Jew at
<hi>Genoa,</hi> a Monk at <hi>Naples,</hi> and a Banker at
<hi>Venice,</hi> who, it was ſaid, had no leſs than ſeven
and twenty Principalities in <hi>Italy</hi> mortgag'd
to them at a Time, beſides two Kingdoms,
ſeven Dutchies, and the Jewels of the Crown
of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus given the blazing Characters
of three Capital Sharpers of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi>
Knaves of leſſer Magnitude can have no
room to ſhine; the Alley throngs with Jews,
Jobbers and Brokers, their Names are need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
ſs, their Characters dirty as their Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
, and the beſt thing that I can yet
find out to ſay of them, is, that there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
to be two honeſt. Men among them,
Heavens preſerve their Integrity; for the
Place is a Snare, the Employment it ſelf
fatal to Principle, and hitherto the ſame
Obſervation which I think was very aptly
made upon the Mint, will juſtly turn upon
them, (<hi>viz.</hi>) That many an honeſt Man
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1189201200:43"/>
has gone in to them, but cannot ſay that I
ever knew One come an honeſt Man out from
them.</p>
            <p>But to leave them a little, and turn our
Eyes another way; Is it not ſurprizing to
find new Faces among theſe ſcandalous People,
and Perſons even too big for our Reproof.
Is it poſſible that <hi>Stars</hi> of another Latitude
ſhould appear in our Hemiſphere? Had it been
<hi>Sims</hi> or <hi>Bowcher,</hi> or Gameſters of the Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Room
or Maſquerades, there had been
little to be ſaid; or had the Groom-Porter's
been tranſpos'd to <hi>Garraway</hi>'s and <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s,
it had been nothing new; true Gameſters
being always ready to turn their Hand to
any Play. But to ſee Stateſmen turn Dealers,
and Men of Honour ſtoop to the Chicanry
of Jobbing; to ſee Men at the Orfices in the
Morning, at the P— Houſe about
Noon, at the Cabinet at Night, and at
<hi>Exchange-Alley</hi> in the proper Intervals, What
new <hi>Phoenomina</hi> are theſe? What fatal Things
may theſe ſhining Planets (like the late Great
Light) fore-tell to the State, and to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick;
for when Stateſmen turn Jobbers, the
State may be Jobb'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:1189201200:44"/>
It may be true, that a Treaſurer or Caſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper
may be truſted with more Money than
he is worth, and many times it is ſo; and if
the Man be honeſt, there may be no harm in
it: But when a Treaſurer plays for more Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
than he is worth, they that truſt him run
a Riſque of their Money, becauſe, tho' he may
be an honeſt Man he may be undone. I ſpeak
of private, not publick Treaſurers.</p>
            <p>Indeed it requires ſome Apology to ſay
ſuch a One may be an honeſt Man; it would
be hard to call him an honeſt Man who plays
away any Man's Money that is not his own,
or more than he is able to pay again out of his
own. But if it be diſhoneſt to play it away,
<hi>that is,</hi> loſe it at Play, 'tis equally diſhoneſt to
play with it, whether it be loſt or no, becauſe
in ſuch a Caſe, he that plays for more than
he can pay, his Maſter runs the Hazard
more than himſelf; nay, his Maſter runs
an unequal Hazard, for if the Money be
loſt, 'tis the Maſters, if there is Gain, 'tis
the Servants.</p>
            <p>Stock-Jobbing is Play; a Box and Dice
may be leſs dangerous, the Nature of them
are alike, a Hazard; and if they venture at
either what is not their own, the Knavery
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:1189201200:45"/>
is the ſame. It is not neceſſary, any more
than it is ſafe, to mention the Perſons I may
think of in this Remark; they who are the
Men will eaſily underſtand me.</p>
            <p>In a Word, I appeal to all the World,
whether a Man that is intruſted with other
Mens Money, (whether Publick or Private, is
not the Queſtion) ought to be ſeen in
<hi>Exchange-Alley.</hi> Would it not be a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Objection to any Gentleman or Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, not to employ any Man to keep his
Caſh, or look after his Eſtate, to ſay of
him <hi>he plays,</hi> he is <hi>a Gameſter,</hi> or he is <hi>given
to Gaming</hi> and <hi>Stock-Jobbing,</hi> which is ſtill
worſe, gives the ſame, or a ſtronger Ground
of Objection in the like Caſes.</p>
            <p>Again, are there fewer Sharpers and Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in <hi>Exchange-Alley</hi> than at the Groom-Porters? Is there leſs Cheating in Stock-Jobbing
than at Play? Or rather is there not
fifty times more? An un-enter'd Youth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to deal in <hi>Exchange-Alley,</hi> is immediately
ſurrounded with Bites, Setters, Pointers, and
the worſt ſort of Cheats, juſt as a young
Country Gentleman is with Bauds, Pimps,
and Spungers, when he firſt comes to Town.
It is ten Thouſand to one, when a forward
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:1189201200:46"/>
young Tradeſman ſteps out of his Shop into
<hi>Exchange-Alley,</hi> I ſay 'tis ten Thouſand to one
but he is undone, if you ſee him once but enter
the fatal Door, never diſcount his Bills after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
, never truſt him with Goods at ſix
Months Pay any more.</p>
            <p>If it be thus dangerous to <hi>the Mean,</hi> what
is it to <hi>the Great?</hi> I ſee only this difference,
that in the firſt the Danger is Private, in the
latter Publick.</p>
            <p>It has not been many Years ſince Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for Members of — came to
Market in <hi>Exchange-Alley,</hi> as current as Lot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
Tickets now, and at a Price like theſe,
much above what any Parliament allow'd
them to go at; While this was carry'd on,
a great many honeſt Men exclaim'd againſt
it, and expos'd it; nay, ſeveral Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
were propos'd for regulating Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
, and preventing Bribery and Corruption:
But all this would not do, and this indeed
was one of the happy Conſequences of that
otherwiſe neceſſary Act for <hi>Triennial Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi>
and I firmly believe that it is owe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very much to the late ſuſpending that
Act for a Time, that theſe Things are not
come to Market again.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:1189201200:47"/>
It may eaſily be remember'd, that the firſt
Occaſion of the <hi>Exchange-Alley</hi> Men engaging
in the Caſe of Elections of Members, was in
King <hi>William</hi>'s Time, on the famous Diſputes
which happen'd between the Old <hi>Eaſt-India</hi>
Company and the New; which having held a
great while, and having embarraſs'd not the
City only, but the whole Nation, and even
made it ſelf dangerous to the Publick Buſineſs,
it was expected it ſhould be fully decided by the
Houſe of Commons: To this End the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of both Companies, with all the Trick,
Artifice, Cunning and Corruption, that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
and Intereſt could arm them with, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtirred
themſelves to be choſen Members.</p>
            <p>Brokers rid Night and Day from one End of
the Kingdom to the other, to engage Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to bribe Corporations, to buy off Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titors,
and to manage the Elections. You
will ſee the State of Things at that Time, and
the Danger this Stock jobbing Wickedneſs had
brought the Publick to, if you pleaſe to read
the following Exclamation of the honeſt Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders
at that Time, which was preſented
to the Publick by way of Complaint: The
Thing was laid before the King firſt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Parliament afterwards; and it
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:1189201200:48"/>
was his Majeſty's Senſe of the Conſequence,
that made him reſolve to bring the two <hi>Eaſt-India</hi>
Companies to unite their Stocks, for in
a word, the Stock-Jobbers embroil'd the whole

            <p>I ſaid above, that the Parliament put a

Acts; and the late Act for ſuſpending the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ennial
Bill has at preſent laid it a ſſep; but
how far the Practice may revive when a new
Election ſhall come on, who knows? Never
was more Knaves or more Money in <hi>Exchange-Alley,</hi>

their Funds before they are laid; Stock-jobbing

found, may in ſome Senſe be call'd Stock-job<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
the Houſe: If then they will even before
the Members Faces, jobb their depending Acts,
and that too before they are paſs'd; ſhall we
doubt but they will Stock-jobb the Elections
of another Parliament when this is gone
Home?</p>
            <p>It is evident, that at preſent, not being able
to avoid preying upon their Country, they
have been tampering Abroad; Foreign Alarms
is the preſent Commodity at Market; Choice
of Members may be the next; till in time,
by Strength of Money, they may <hi>Stock-jobb</hi>
Religion, Property, Conſtitution and Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
for nothing can come amiſs to them, if
they can but get Money by it; for if the ſame
Avarice reigns among them that 'tis evident
is their Guide now, they would with the ſame
Facility jobb for the Nation, and without any
Scruple, make a Transfer of King <hi>George</hi> and
his Crown for a half <hi>per Cent.</hi> upon the Value,
to whoever bids the Money.</p>
            <p>There was a Book publiſh'd ſome Years ago,
and when the Stock-jobbing People were thought
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:1189201200:57"/>
as willing, yet not quite ſo daring or ſo cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
as they are now; it was Entitled, <hi>The
Villany of the Stock-jobbers.</hi> Indeed it ſet them
out in their true Colours, and for ſome time
gave them a little Shock; for the Truth was,
they jobb'd King <hi>William</hi> and the Government
at that Time at ſuch a Rate, that in ſpight of
the Invincible Valour and Reſolution of the
Soldiery, in ſpight of the moſt Glorious Prince
and moſt Vigilant General the World had
ever ſeen; yet the Enemy gain'd upon us every
Year; the Funds were run down, the Credit
jobb'd away in <hi>Exchange-Alley,</hi> the King and
his Troops devoured by Mechanicks, and ſold
to Uſury, Tallies lay bundled up like <hi>Bath</hi>
Faggots in the Hands of Brokers and Stock-job<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
; the Parliament gave Taxes, laid Funds,
but the Loans were at the Mercy of thoſe Men;
and they ſhew'd their Mercy indeed, by devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the King and the Army, the Parliament,
and indeed the whole Nation, bringing that
Great Prince ſometimes to that Exigence, thro'
unexpreſſible Extortions that were put upon him,
that he has even gone into the Field without
his Equipage, nay, even without his Army;
the Regiments have been uncloathed when the
King has been in the Field, and the willing
brave <hi>Engliſh</hi> Spirits, eager to honour their
Country, and follow ſuch a King, have march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:1189201200:58"/>
even to Battle, without either Stockings or
Shoes, while his Servants have been every Day
working in <hi>Exchange-Alley</hi> to get his own Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
of the Stock-Jobbers, even after all the
horrible Demands of Diſcount have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
; and at laſt, ſcarce 50 <hi>per Cent.</hi> of the
Money granted by Parliament has come into
the Exchequer, and that late, too late for that
Service, and by Driblets, till the King has
been tir'd with the Delay, and been even ready
to give up the Cauſe.</p>
            <p>We have juſt now had a Teſt of their Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
on the Subject of the Invaſion: Theſe
were the Men that made the firſt Advantage of
the News; immediately thoſe that were to
put Stock upon any Man at a high Price, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
'd it, the Accepters, forc'd by the Demand,
call in their Money on every Hand, pay the
Difference, the Price falls, a general Run upon
the Bank follows, and Stock-jobbing began it.</p>
            <p>Say this was no Deſign, yet if every Alarm
of the Fooliſh or the Timerous, or the Falſe,
is capable to ſet the Humour afloat by the
Agency of <hi>Exchange-Alley,</hi> then <hi>Exchange-Alley</hi>
is as dangerous to the Publick Safety, as a
Magazine of Gun-powder is to a populous
City.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:1189201200:59"/>
But if it be by Deſign, then, when-ever the
Pretender is to be pawn'd upon us by any Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Power that can but talk of lending 5 or
6000 Men, our Publick Credit is at his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
, by the Agency of <hi>Exchange-Alley</hi> and the
Brokers.</p>
            <p>The Story of the Invaſion from <hi>Spain,</hi> we
hope, is now over: Indeed at the Worſt, I ſaw
no ſuch Reaſon to be ſurprized to that Degree,
as was the Caſe here. Let us look back and ſee
what Injury to the Publick has the very Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
been? What Damage to Credit! What
Stop to Trade! What Interruption to our Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Commerce! beſides ſinking above a Million
Sterling upon our Eſtates; and every Farthing
of this is occaſion'd by the <hi>Stock-jobbers,</hi> and in
the Conſequences of their Contrivances, and by
no other Means; for as to the Deſign of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion,
or that they reſolv'd to come hither at
all, tho' we have evident Proofs of that, becauſe
ſome of them have been actually landed; yet
we cannot yet reſolve the Queſtion poſitively,
whether it was ever worth our being ſo much
alarm'd as we have been in <hi>Exchange-Alley.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Even this Way it appears, that theſe Stock-Jobbers
are dangerous to the Peace, ſince 'tis
in their Power to ſet a Rate when-ever they
pleaſe, not only upon private Eſtates, but
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:1189201200:60"/>
even upon the whole Nation, and in that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
it is to be hoped, the Parliament, who
have hitherto redreſs'd the Publick Grievances,
will take care of theſe People in particular, and
deliver the Publick from ſuch a Set of Men as
are more fatal to them, than a Midnight Fire,
more dangerous than an Enemy Embark'd,
nay, I had almoſt ſaid, than an Enemy
Landed.</p>
            <p>For, in a word, theſe Men take upon them
to put a Standard upon our Fears; and we
are to ask them, when Intelligence comes from
Abroad, whether any thing be to be ſlighted
or apprehended; every publick Piece of News,
every Menace of the Nation's Enemies is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
its Weight from them; and the Price of
Stocks is the Rule by which we are to guide
our Judgment in Publick Affairs, by which
we are either to hope or to fear when any
thing amiſs preſent it ſelf to our View.</p>
            <p>Is this an Advantage fit to be put into the
Hand of a Subject? Are the King's Affairs to
go up and down as they pleaſe, and the Credit
of his Majeſty's Councils riſe and fall as theſe
Men ſhall pleaſe to value them? This would
be making them Kings, and making the King
Subject to the Caprice of their private Interſt,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:1189201200:61"/>
his Affairs be liable to be rated in <hi>Exchange-Alley,</hi>
and to be run down as they pleaſed;
an Article, which as the <hi>Roman</hi> Pontiff, in
the firſt Politicks of the Church, made all the
Kings of the Earth become Penſioners to the
Prieſts, ſo it would make all the Kings of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
Penſioners to <hi>Exchange-Alley.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It muſt be confeſs'd, it looks as if this were
the preſent View in the Manner which Stock-Jobbing
now goes on; and there are more
Miſchiefs in it than perhaps we are aware of,
the Extremes either way ſeem dangerous
enough, for Example,</p>
            <p>If one way the Stock-Jobbers manage the
Publick, they ſcandalouſly ſubject the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
, the Miniſters of State, the Publick
Credit, nay, even the Elections of Parliament
to their Orders: So if a Government ſhould
come abſolutely to get the Management of the
Stock-Jobbers, it might be many Ways fatal
to the Peoples Intereſt, and indeed put the
Purſe-Strings of the Nation ſo much into the
Hands of a Miniſtry, that if they did not at
any time command the general Treaſure, and be
able to raiſe what Money they pleas'd without
a Parliament, they would be able to add what
Value they pleaſed to the Funds given, raiſe
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:1189201200:62"/>
them when they pleas'd to draw Money in,
and ſink them when they pleaſed to iſſue Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
out: That in a word, the Rate of Stocks
ſhould be ſettled every Day in the <hi>Exchequer;</hi>
and tho' they might not be ſaid to ſtand no more
in need of Parliaments, it would be moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
, that they would not ſtand in ſo much
need of Parliaments as they uſed to do, and
as it is convenient for us they ſhould do.</p>
            <p>I muſt run out a great Length in the Enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Miſchief to the Liberty of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi>
which might attend ſuch a Thing as
this; and tho' at preſent it may be objected,
that it is unreaſonable, and entirely needleſs,
becauſe we are under a King that ſtands in
need of no Artifices, and is too juſt to attempt
any Encroachment on the Liberties of his
People, and a Miniſtry, who we have reaſon
to hope are above taking any ſuch mean Steps;
yet if ever a Time ſhall come again, when eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Politick Step ſhall be enquired after to bring
Griſt to the Publick Mill, and every way that
can be found practicable, ſhall be thought ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifiable;
then let you Citizens of <hi>London</hi> have
a care of a Bear-skin-Court, and a Stock-Job<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
Miniſtry, when <hi>Exchange-Alley</hi> ſhall be
tranſpos'd to the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> and States-men
ſhall make a Property of the Brokers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:1189201200:63"/>
This is indeed a Thing remote, and as I ſay
above, there is no Danger of its happening in
this Reign, ſo it may never happen at all: But
as I alſo ſay, without the leaſt Reflection upon
our preſent Government, that ſuch a Time may
come, and ſuch a Thing may happen; ſo I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
, the State of Things ought forthwith to be
annihilated if poſſible, which is but in its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
capable of being thus perverted, and we
ought not to leave our Poſterity in a Condition
to be devoured by ſuch Caterpillars, if it be in
our Power to prevent it.</p>
            <p>Why may not any collected Stock of Money,
ſuch as that we have mention'd before, to be in
the Management of the <hi>Birchin-Lane Company,</hi>
be manag'd in the Hands of Courtiers, as well
as of Citizens; Miniſters of State, as well as
Inhabitants of <hi>Hackney;</hi> and to how many more
unlucky Purpoſes may ſuch Men apply that
Power? Theſe Men indeed proceed, with Trick
and Cunning, to amaſs great Eſtates, and to
enrich themſelves and their Families out of the
Spoils of the People, their Neighbours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
in this we think they cannot have too much of
our juſt Satyr beſtow'd upon them; but if this
Engine of Jobbing ſhould once come into the
Hands of Miniſters of State; if a degenerated
Government ſhould come to uſe it, as ſuch a
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:1189201200:64"/>
Government may be ſuppoſed to be able to do,
what Miſchiefs may they not bring upon the
Nation? And what may they not be able to
do, if their Deſigns are but wicked enough to
puſh them on?</p>
            <p>It would be hard to ſay to what Length this
Jobbing Trade might be extended, eſpecially
whereby the Advantage of a punctual Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the publick Credit has ſo far gain'd upon
the People, as to bring the Rate of Funds and
Stocks to exceed the Intrinſick Value, and to
keep upon an Advance: What may not a
Government, who has the Command of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
do in the particular Art of Screwing up,
or Screwing down the publick Intereſts and
Securities?</p>
            <p>'Tis a copious Subject, our <hi>Exchange-Alley</hi>
Men underſtand it well enough; and if they
were put to give their Opinions, and had Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty
enough to ſpeak the Truth againſt their
Intereſt, they would acknowledge their Trade
is capable of ruining ten Nations, if it was
carried on to the full Extent of it.</p>
            <p>While theſe Sheets were at the Preſs, we had
another little Teſt of their Knavery to the
Publick; and it is not at all owing to them, that
the Thing run no further; the contrary Winds
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:1189201200:65"/>
and Storms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had diſappointed the King's
Enemies, and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet was driven back
to <hi>Spain</hi> in a ſhatter'd and defeated Condition,
as appears by the Publick Account of thoſe
Things: But in the Interval of this News,
came an Account on the other Hand, that ſome
of the Party were arriv'd in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that they
had beat it up, notwithſtanding all the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of Nature, the Hindrances of Winds
and Seas; immediately Stocks fell Two <hi>per Cent.</hi>
nor did the good News of the Defeated return
of the reſt animate theſe Men to keep up the
Intereſt, by which it appears, that they are
acted more by the bad Principle than by the
good; that they chooſe rather to do Evil than
to do Good: that they ſink faſter than they
riſe, and are willinger to do Harm than Good
to the Government.</p>
            <p>From whence I infer, that the Government,
looking upon them as they really are, rather
Enemies than Friends to the General Intereſt,
ſhould rather encline to root them out, than
preſerve them. <hi>AMEN.</hi>
