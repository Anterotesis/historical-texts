            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

CASE
OF
Diſſenters, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE <hi>Spaniards</hi> uſe to glory in the wide Extent,
and pure Catholiciſm, of their Dominion; the
<hi>Italians,</hi> from a Pretenſion of Superior Politeneſs
and Sagacity, contemn all Tramontanes; the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
<hi>French</hi> make to themſelves a daily Triumph of the
Succeſſes of their Grand Monarch; why may not my
Countrymen as well exult, that the Laws, by which we
are governed, are no other than ſuch, as our ſelves, by a
due Repreſentative, have choſen? Oh happy <hi>England!</hi>
May thy People eſteem, as it deſerves, a Benefit ſo ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar;
may that Noble Repreſentative of thine, called to
be Guardians of this Bleſſing, never want Foreſight to
diſcover, and Prudence to prevent, the Dangers which may
ariſe to threaten it.</p>
            <p>The ordinary Method with us is well known to be,
that the Addition of new Laws, or Amendment of old ones,
are propoſed firſt by the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
publick Notice given when the ſame are to
come under a ſolemn Debate; which being ſeveral times
adjourn'd, there ariſes Opportunity ſufficient, for the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
from all Parts of the Kingdom, to communicate to the
reſpective Members of Parliament, their Opinion ſeverally
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0340001500:4"/>
thereupon; ſo that in this reſpect ſeldom any thing of
Importance is concluded concerning the good People of
<hi>England,</hi> without their own tacit Conſent at leaſt, over
and above the Benefit of their being repreſented in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.
Such being then the Caſe, we cannot celebrate
enough our Happineſs; we may baſely overlook, but once
to loſe it, would be Miſery to us beyond Expreſſion.</p>
            <p>'Tis frequent moreover, for our Laws to be made tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
firſt, till the Experiment of a few Years has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
them for perpetual. As for thoſe of the
higheſt Concern, when the Benefits or Effects are liable
to Doubt, we have ſeen ſome Bills undergo the Scrutiny
of ſeveral ſucceeding Seſſions of Parliament before they
paſſed the Signature of Authority. Sometimes alſo our
Courts of Legiſlature, when the Inducements and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of a Bill were not obvious to common Eyes, or
at leaſt liable to Miſconſtruction, have thought good to
lay the ſame before the Publick, that their tender Regards
of general Emolument might the better appear.</p>
            <p>Having obſerv'd various Methods of our Propitious Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature,
an Inſtance of ſeveral of them, but more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the latter, we are here to conſider, I mean the late
Bill for Preventing Occaſional Conformity, which was ſo
differently apprehended in the laſt Seſſion of Parliament,
as no Debates during it were able to reconcile; but that
Matter is of ſuch Concern, that the Proceedings thereupon
being printed by Authority, it ſeems not unworthy eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
true Lover of his Country, to put the ſame into the beſt
Light poſſible, in order to frame a right Judgment, how a
Bill like unto that (if at any time hereafter ſuch ſhould
be propoſed) may affect the Commonweal; ſeeing the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
which ſhall prevail thereof, there can be no doubt,
will be duly weighed by our Repreſentees; and becauſe
one Intention of our Lawgivers, in publiſhing the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of their Proceedings upon that Bill, might be (not
improbably) the better to collect the common Judgment
on it, a Deſire to be aſſiſtant unto that, with a Concern
leſt unhappy Animoſities ſhould grow among us, did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
me to draw into a clear and familiar Method of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
what is very obvious touching that Matter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0340001500:5"/>
The Bill, which is the deſigned Theme of what follows,
I underſtand ſuch as it paſſed laſt Seſſion the Houſe of
Commons, with the ſeveral Amendments agreed afterwards,
touching which, that my Argument may be the more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct,
I take the Liberty to digeſt it under Three Heads,
which are eaſily diſcernable on reading the ſaid Bill, <hi>viz.</hi>
The Preamble, Extent, and Penalties, due Reference being
had thereto; however, theſe few things ought to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed,
<hi>Firſt,</hi> That the whole of it is Prudential and Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
not cenſuring directly the Perſons and Cauſe of the
Diſſenters beyond the Point of bearing Offices, nor inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting
any to be preſent at their Aſſemblies, except ſuch
as are engaged in the Magiſtracy, or Places of Truſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
leaving the Matter of Conſcience as it ſtood before.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> The Communion of the Lord's Supper is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
herein as a Diſcrimination meerly civil; ſo that tho'
Papiſts and Proteſtant Diſſenters are excluded from Offices
thereby, yet is there no Proviſion by the Law to render the
ſame a Barr to the Prophane and Scandalous; which is a
Conſideration ſeems to concern the Honour of the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> as well as the good Adminiſtration of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Truſts, to which it initiates: But becauſe, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Caſes in Religion might be reducible under the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of this Bill, I ſhall comply with the obvious Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our Lawgivers, and confine my Diſcourſe as much
as may be to a Secular Vein. To proceed therefore to the
Bill.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Touching the Preamble of it, it were not eaſie, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure,
in ſo few Words, for our Supreme Governors
to have given more Satisfaction to ſcrupulous Conſciences
than in the Religious Declaration, that ſerves as an Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
here; becauſe therein the Senſe of the preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
appears, that thoſe Severities, under which the
Diſſenters groaned, before the late Act of Indulgence, <hi>were
then to be deem'd Perſecution for Conſcience ſake;</hi> under
which Acceptation it is, that their Exemption from them
for the future (unleſs new Matter of Secular Offence to
the Government ariſes) is to ſtand upon Foundations no
leſs ſafe, than <hi>the Profeſſion of the Chriſtian Religion, and
particularly the Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England. This
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0340001500:6"/>
is the higheſt Atteſtation can be, that the Diſſenters
are no longer to be look'd upon <hi>obnoxious to the Church
and State, or chargeable with Schiſm, Sedition and Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
as the former Laws (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ow ſuſpended) did inſiſt they
were; ſo that the Reaſon given by thoſe Laws ceaſing,
<hi>and ſince it is on all Hands agreed, great Advantages have
accrued from the Act of Indulgence,</hi> they may henceforth
expect, with the reſt of their Fellow-Subjects, to partake
the Serenity and Benignity of a Government, which in all
other things ever was, and now is, the moſt clement under
the Sun. Thus is the Bond of engaging Goodneſs laid upon
them for ever; ſo that as ſince the late Glorious Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they are found equally affectionate as others, to the
Intereſts and Settlement of the Crown, all the former ſtig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matizing
Brands upon them are done away.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As to the Recital of the preſent State of Law, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
the Religious Declaration,</hi> (that it provides already,
every Perſon admitted into any Office, ſhould be conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the Church) <hi>the Words of it cannot be taken in the
ſtricteſt Senſe,</hi> there being many Offices and Employments,
to which Perſons have been, and may be now, admitted,
without lying under an Obligation to receive the Sacrament,
or be conformable on that Account: For inſtance, Offices of
Inheritance, and in the Foreſts, Non-Commiſſion Offices in the
Fleet, with many more; <hi>therefore what is aſſerted in this
Paragraph in the general, we muſt underſtand</hi> to relate to
ſuch Perſons and Offices only as are ſubſequently mention'd
in the Bill; but if thoſe who break the Intention of a Law,
break the Law, it were fit and deſireable that no Words
(if poſſible) might be uſed in any, which in the Sequel may
lead Men into Miſtakes, touching that Intention.</p>
            <p>The laſt Clauſe of the Preamble gives a very juſt Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Caſe, which the Bill is deſigned to bring a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
for; that is to ſay, <hi>No Man ordinarily frequenting
private Meetings, ſhould qualifie himſelf for an Office, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
only on that Account the Sacrament with the Church.</hi>
Now that nothing however be underſtood beyond the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Senſe of the Words thereof, I take theſe Two Things
not to be abſolutely concluded in them. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That whilſt
Conforming only for a Place has a Brand of Scandal affixed
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0340001500:7"/>
on it; yet it does not follow that Occaſional Conformity
otherwiſe (without ſuch Deſign) ought to be reproach'd; for
as to ſuch Perſons, who join themſelves to their Chriſtian So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties
ſeverally, as taking the Conduct of them to be moſt
agreeable to the Word of God, and becauſe it pleaſes the
Soveraign Spirit of Grace to co-operate more evidently up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them therein, for ſuch to go ſometimes to a Divine
Service, different from what they frequent and chuſe, is
an Expreſſion of Charity to others, and ought not therefore
to be blamed. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It can no Ways be taken for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
that a Cenſure upon the Conformity in this Bill
mention'd, does imply <hi>going to a Meeting to be</hi> malum in
ſe, <hi>or ſavouring of Faction, or Criminal, Illegal, and Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical,</hi>
as the ſuperceded Laws did conſtantly aſſert; for
the mention of it, as allowed by Law, does demonſtrate
the contrary; the manifeſt and primary Purpoſe of this
Bill being rather to keep Diſſenters from the Church,
than others from a Meeting; however, the mutual Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in this Point, to the great Glory of our Times, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
of that charitable Moderation, ſo remarkably emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
in the Primitive Ages of Chriſtianity, as to occaſion
thoſe Univerſal Laws in the <hi>Creed,</hi> for every one <hi>to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Holy Catholick Church, and the Communion of
Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The enacting Part of this Bill, I term the
Extent of it, becauſe it deſcribes both the Crime and the
Offices thereby to be affected, whereof diſtinctly; firſt
then for the Crime, the Definition of it herein is the ſame
with that <hi>in Two ſeveral Acts, to prevent and ſuppreſs
Seditious Conventicles;</hi> and 16 and 22 <hi>Car.</hi> II. ſo that
what was criminal by them to all Perſons, becomes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
ſo by this Bill to thoſe in Office; the Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for Offices by expreſs Terms of Law required at
preſent, is, in this reſpect, no more than once previouſly
to receive the Sacrament with the Church; but the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
which would be required herein, is, (beſides that) <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
after once taking an Office, to be preſent at any Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
or Meeting, under Colour or Pretence of any Exerciſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
in other manner than according to the Liturgy and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>where Five (more than the Family)
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0340001500:8"/>
ſhall be.</hi> This is a ſort of Qualification for Offices widely
different (as any may ſee) from what the Law requires
now; and we muſt obſerve, that throughout the Bill ſuch
Terms are only uſed as have been commonly appropriated
to Proteſtant Diſſenters; however, to be preſent at Maſs is
tacitly included.</p>
            <p>We do not go about to intimate, That the Injunctions of
the Law at preſent, <hi>to receive the Sacrament according
to the Rites and Uſage of the Church,</hi> do not in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
Meaning of them imply, that the Perſons ought to
be of that Communion; however, none can deny, but they
will very well bear a larger Sence alſo; whereby none
ought to be excluded Offices, who can give a publick Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
they eſteem a Communion with the Church law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
which latter Acceptation of the Laws, though the
generality of Diſſenters ſtand Excluded by it, has all along,
for 40 Years paſt, brought into the Service of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
(without very viſible, ruinous, Effects) no inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Number of Men, whom the propoſed Bill in all
Appearance would finally render incapable.</p>
            <p>Whether it may be for the publick Benefit any longer
to ſuffer the ſame Latitude in reference to Diſſenters,
belongs only to the Supreme Powers to judge; but grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
here that it were not, we do with all Humility of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to Conſideration, whether <hi>gentler Methods be not more
agreeable to the Engliſh Temper, Conſtitution of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
nay, and the Intereſt of State, ſo the End may be
duly attained;</hi> in the Caſe then before us, if the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for Example ſhould require from the eſtabliſh'd
Church, inſtead of one previous Communion (which is all
in the Law expreſs'd) that Men in Office ſhould attend
Four times Yearly, or oftner, at the Sacrament, would it
not be equal Security to the State, and greatly for the
Honour of the Church, but give no Matter of Offence
or Jealouſie to Diſſenters? Whereas if the Qualification
for Offices is to conſiſt not ſo much in frequent and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
Attendance on the publick Celebrations, as in a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
and Averſion to Diſſenters, <hi>this cannot but miniſter
juſt Cauſe of Fear, that thoſe Aſſemblies, at which once to be
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0340001500:9"/>
preſent, expoſes to ſo great a Cenſure, are not likely to
continue long allowed by Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No Man can doubt but a Cenſure of this kind would
prove <hi>a Notorious Mark of Infamy upon the Aſſemblies of
Diſſenters,</hi> and in that reſpect would affect them beyond
the Caſe of Officers; and the revived Definition of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle,
being <hi>under the Pretence and Colour of the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of Religion,</hi> (it deſerves to be conſider'd) whether it
might not be conſtrued to allude to, and imply, ſomewhat
of thoſe dangerous Practices the Suſpended Laws have
connected with the ſaid Definition; but there are other
obvious Inconveniencies in this new Method of Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for it would expoſe more a great deal than the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Way (as will be ſhewn elſewhere) to the predatory
Mercy of Informers; it debarrs the common natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
of Relations, in Baptiſms, Funeral Sermons, and
the like: <hi>It caſts a hazardous Diſcouragement upon Family
Prayer, whereat often, among Perſons of Quality, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
others, more than Five may happen to be preſent;
and it brings all Foreign Churches under a Cenſure too;
whereas the Act of Uniformity provides, that the Penalties
thereof ſhould not extend to any Reformed Churches of
Aliens, allowed, or to be allowed, by His Majeſty or His
Succeſſors; ſome ſuch have ſince had Encouragement for
their Settlement from Parliament, and have proved bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
in Manufactures to this Kingdom, toward which
their Liberty of Conſcience, without Reflection, has not a
little contributed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond Diſtinction I have made of the Extent (or
enacting Part, of this Bill) is of the Offices intended by it
to be affected, which clearly falls under a twofold Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,
one the ſame with that in the Act, 25 <hi>Car.</hi> II. <hi>For
preventing Dangers which may happen from Popiſh Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants;</hi>
the other of the 13 of <hi>Car.</hi> II. <hi>For well governing
and regulating Corporations.</hi> Now becauſe this ſeems the
moſt tender and ſenſible Part of the Bill, moſt liable to
Miſtake, and upon the right Apprehenſion whereof our
Judgment of the whole muſt very much depend; before
I deſcend into a Diſquiſition of it, I beg leave to deviate
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0340001500:10"/>
a little from the juſt Method of Diſcourſe; and therefore
before I endeavour to prove what the Bill, under this Head,
would have enacted—new, I will firſt lay down and
conſider the Reaſons commonly alledg'd, why the ſame
ought to be.</p>
            <p>What is commonly alledg'd, as the Ground of the new
Proviſions in this Bill, amounts to thus much; that a
National Church being abſolutely needful to a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the only effectual Way to preſerve it, is by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Civil Power in the Hands of ſuch whoſe Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
and Principles are agreeable thereto; and that this
is equally neceſſary to the Safety and Peace of the State
likewiſe; but ſay they, the preſent Laws proving too
weak to ſecure thoſe Bleſſings, becauſe they are eluded
by Occaſional Conformity, therefore there wants ſome new
Expedients to ſupport them; theſe Maxims we can readily
grant; ſo far as the Security and Peace of the State ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
undoubtedly concern'd, ſo much is allowed on all
Hands for inconteſtible; but the Matter in queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us ſeems to be, whether Occaſional Conformity of
Diſſenters has really endanger'd the Safety, and violated
the Peace, of Church and State? Or has any Principles in
it diſagreeable therewith? Which Matter cannot yet be
taken for concluded, as the Proceedings of Parliament
publiſh'd do evince, and whereof therefore the preſent
Juncture and Occaſion gives Liberty to ſpeak.</p>
            <p>In order to examine then this Matter aright, we think
proper to diſtinguiſh the Relation which the Occaſional
Conformity of Diſſenters may bear to the Church and
State ſeverally; firſt therefore in Reference to the State,
<hi>Occaſional Conformity</hi> (it may be agreed to us) <hi>is no new
thing, but even Coaeval with the Act of Uniformity it
ſelf; ſo that in 40 Years Experience, if it were evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that Injuries to the Peace of the Government had
aroſe thence, how came it to paſs they ſhould be overlookt
ſo long?</hi> But while ſeveral Ways were taken to enjoin
Conformity, how Occaſional ſoever, it was in no kind
before made Penal to approve it, tho' thereby Offices
were attained; after ſuch a large Atteſtation from Fact,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0340001500:11"/>
it would be needleſs to ſay, Occaſional Conformity of
Diſſenters has in it ſelf no Principles dangerous to the
Peace of the Government, if there were not another
ſort of Conformity which does obſtinately maintain ſuch
as withdraw Men from their Allegiance to Her Gracious
Majeſty, and from all Reſpect to the preſent Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Crown; but as to Principles, further than
is obvious from Practice, it is not my proper Province to
diſcourſe, that being already ſufficiently treated of by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines.</p>
            <p>If
the Time paſt has not produced a Neceſſity of any
new Proviſion againſt Accidental or Occaſional Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
I think we may be confident the preſent much leſs
does; for if the Laws already in being do intend that
Men in Office ſhould be entirely conformable, Her Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Majeſty has aſſured all the World there can be no
Danger from Occaſional Conformity in this Auſpicious
Reign, by theſe Words of Her laſt Speech to the Parliament;
<hi>I ſhall always make it my particular Care to Encourage
and Maintain this Church as by Law eſtabliſh'd, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the leaſt Member of it, in all their Juſt Rights and
Priviledges.</hi> And now having deliver'd my Sentiment,
upon Obſervations of the paſt and preſent Time, to go
further would be to wade into the Politicks beyond my
Depth. I can ſay nothing certain of Futurity; but ſince
the Diſſenters are known, beyond doubt, to be very cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially
affected to the Proteſtant Succeſſion, methinks
whatever Qualifications may be judged requiſite for Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Magiſtracy and Publick Truſt, they may well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
(beyond a Proviſion for that) no Hardſhips will be
laid upon them now.</p>
            <p>2<hi>dly,</hi> To conſider Occaſional Conformity in Reference
to the Church, it might ſuffice to ſay, the Affairs of it
(diſtinct from thoſe of the State) do no Ways lye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Cognizance of ſuch, whom that may veſt with
Government; but for what properly concerns the Honour
and Welfare of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the firſt Words
of this Bill do imply, that her greateſt Glory conſiſts in
the Character of Moderation, Sweetneſs, and Charity,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0340001500:12"/>
truly Chriſtian and Apoſtolick, and very juſtly, for this
would recommend her to all the Reformed Churches of
<hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> as worthy to be acknowledg'd their Chief
and Beſt. <hi>In the Reign of Queen</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
in</hi> England <hi>came to Church, and were Occaſional Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts,
yet the Government was not Uneaſie, and in Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
by it; but the Pope fearing what that was like ſoon
to grow to, put a Stop to it by Bull, and the Church of</hi>
Rome <hi>does generally to this Day encourage every thing
like to Occaſional Conformity of Proteſtants; and the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
ſhew they are in the right, and gain their Ends by
it.</hi> In like manner, can it be thought that the Church
has <hi>gained from any ſort of the Diſſenters among us, as
from thoſe who have allowed and practiced an Occaſional
Conformity with her? Has ſhe not, by permitting it, obtained
many uſeful and worthy Members? Does not the Practice
of it weaken the Diſſenters, and encreaſe her Reputation
and Authority?</hi> Where then has been the Damage to
the Church from Occaſional Conformity? It would be
difficult to ſhew what Security, Honour or Intereſt, ſhe
haſt loſt, during the greateſt Indulgence to Diſſenters in
the late Reign, of any thing ſhe poſſeſs'd before that
time, during the unſpeakable Sufferings of others; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it muſt be an Acceſſion of Honour and Safety unto
her, that ſhe is now by Clemency become reverenced of
thoſe who formerly were ſuſpected for her Enemies.</p>
            <p>Having thus made Enquiry, what Reaſon there is to
apprehend that the Safety of the Church and State has
been, or is, endanger'd by the Latitude allowed to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters,
from the preſent Condition of the Laws; I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
according to promiſe, to enquire what Alteration
would ariſe on the Head of Offices from the Bill now
under Conſideration; which I ſhall do in Two Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of them; I mean thoſe comprehended in the Teſt
Act, and thoſe peculiarly affected by that for regulating
Corporations; premiſing here only, that the Offices of
the latter ſort, which do directly fall within the Teſt,
I judge better to conſider in that Denomination, becauſe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0340001500:13"/>
thereby what remains will be more diſtinct and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible,
when we handle it apart.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt,</hi> For the Teſt Clauſe, which is the former in this
part of the Bill, without reciting the Words of it, we
may be allowed to ſay upon good Authority, <hi>That ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly
and indiſputably it does comprehend all the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Offices and Imployments of Publick Truſt in the
Kingdom, in which the Security of the Government may
be concerned; the Experience of 30 Years paſt has juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
the Meaſures taken by that Law, that it is exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
enough as to the ſeveral ſorts of Offices for Publick
Security; the Terms of it are expreſs, clear, and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally,
underſtood, without any Uncertainty as to what Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
it relates, which is not ſo evident in thoſe of
the Corporation Act; the ſaid Act includes all Offices of
Magiſtracy, in eſpecial, as well within Corporations as
without; and at the enacting of it there was little Regard
had to the Act for Regulating Corporations, becauſe a
more effectual Security to the Church was given hereby.</hi>
It cannot be taxed as inſufficient to compaſs the End de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
by it, which was expreſly to prevent Dangers
that might happen from Popiſh Recuſants, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
from Offices all others who will not take the
Sacrament according to the Uſage of the Church eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht.
After this Manner, and in a due Medium, as would
be eaſie in another ſort of Diſcourſe, to make appear the
Safety and Peace of Church and State, have been fully
provided for; nor have the Meaſures of it to procure
thoſe been any Ways (in particular the Penalties) found
deficient.</p>
            <p>This Act being ſo extenſive and compleat, that it
reaches whatever Offices concern the Safety of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and is not deficient in any Means to attain
its End. If Dangers ſhould from Occaſional Conformity
ariſe, it were eaſie at any time to enjoin ſuch Frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
at the Publick Offices of the Church, as might deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
an entire Conformiſt, without a Brand upon ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Aſſemblies, to raiſe again the Seeds of Fatal Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities;
but as to the Places of Magiſtracy and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0340001500:14"/>
Truſt, already comprehended in the Teſt, as they
concern the Security of State much more, ſo they affect
the Body of Diſſenters much leſs, than thoſe in the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations;
for which Cauſe, what is to be ſaid in their
Behalf is more properly referr'd to that Head. It would alſo
be very unbecoming any ſort of Men to enter into Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
with their Governors upon thoſe high Points,
which are ſo abſolutely in the Legiſlature to judge of
and determine; 'tis not fit for me ſo much as to offer an
Opinion: An Explanation of the Teſt, more to the Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of Diſſenters, might indeed deprive ſeveral of
ſome profitable Places, in the Royal Houſhold, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer,
the Navy, the Exciſe, the Cuſtoms, and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where;
but the Magiſtracy of the City would be the
chief Import of this Matter; concerning which, what
Inconveniences have aroſe to the Government from the
Courſe of Things for near 20 Years paſt there, and how
an Alteration in it will any Ways tend to the Advantage
of the State, is equally to me undiſcernable; but this I
do adventure to ſay, that if Men, whom the Negative
Qualification of this Bill would have rendred incapable
to ſerve in ſuch Offices, ſhould have been finable never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
for not ſerving them, and that <hi>toties quoties,</hi> as
the Humour of the World might lead, that ſort of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
might poſſibly riſe pretty high.</p>
            <p>2<hi>dly,</hi> It remains to examine what the propoſed Bill
would have introduced <hi>de novo,</hi> upon the Head of the
Corporation Act diſtinctly; the Clauſe whereof, expreſſive
of the Offices it would affect, is in theſe Words: <hi>Any
Mayor, Alderman, Recorder, Bayliff, Town-Clerk, Common-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil-man,
or other Perſon, bearing any Office of Magiſtracy,
or Places, or Truſts, or other Imployment, relating to, or
concerning, the Government of the reſpective Cities, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations,
Boroughs, Cinque-Ports, and their Members, and
other Port-Towns.</hi> As to ſo much hereof as concerns
Magiſtracy, the Teſt Act having better provided, my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
is to be henceforth reſtrained to what herein
touches only the Intrinſick and Inferior Imployments, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to the ſeveral Boroughs reſpectively, wherein the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0340001500:15"/>
Security of the Church and State does not ſeem to be
much concerned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſt of our Laws have ſprung from the evident Neceſſities
of the Times, and ſo came in as Remedies to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Diſtempers of them, which is in none more apparent
than this of the Corporations the</hi> 13. Car. II. Thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable
Confuſions which had tormented the Nation, for
nigh 20 Years preceeding, lay freſh upon the Minds of the
Parliament, when that Act was made; and 'tis evident
that nothing but ſo extraordinary a Juncture could have
excuſed ſome Parts of it: Nay, it was principally found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon Reaſons ſo peculiar to that time, they are ſar
from being pertinent to ours, for there is now no ſolemn
League and Covenant needs to be renounced; the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in it, that it is not lawful, upon any Pretence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
to take up Arms againſt the King, and of Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of that traiterous Poſition of doing ſo by his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
againſt his Perſon, or thoſe commiſſion'd by him,
(<hi>which was the Touchſtone of the ſaid Act and Times</hi>)
is now utterly abrogated, and no Perſon henceforth can be
obliged to take the ſame, as appears in the Act <hi>Primo W.</hi>
and <hi>M.</hi> for appointing other Oaths; the Oaths of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
and Allegiance therein are alſo chang'd; the Power
given by it to the Crown, to Conſtitute Commiſſioners for
Two Years to turn out, and put in the Corporation Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
<hi>ad libitum,</hi> though they were conformable to the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications
required by the Act, was an Extravagance the
preſent Age would ſcarce approve; the Preamble ſpeaks
of it as a thing too well known, that notwithſtanding His
Majeſties unparallell'd Goodneſs, in pardoning what was
paſt, there were many evil Spirits ſtill working. <hi>We do
not therefore herein go about to cenſure the Meaſures of that
Act, as they were ſuted to the Juncture; but as the
Reaſons, the Jealouſies and Foundations, whereon that
Act was built, were ſo appropriate to that time, that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Parts of it here above mention'd (as unſuitable to
any other) are ſince aboliſh'd. It is pretty clear that the
primary Intent thereof had its full and due Effect from
the Commiſſioners Power, and the Impoſition of renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0340001500:16"/>
the Covenant and Declaration of Fidelity,</hi> for there
was little regard had to it at the time that a more effectual
Security to the Church was provided by the Teſt.</p>
            <p>We come therefore to conſider in the next Place, what
remains yet unrazed of that Act in 13. <hi>Car.</hi> II. <hi>for well
governing and regulating Corporations;</hi> and then will clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be diſcern'd what the propoſed Bill would have ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradded,
touching the Offices of Magiſtracy, the Teſt
Act has much better and effectually provided, which has
been already conſider'd; and therefore as to what is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly
under my preſent Head of Diſcourſe to be treated
of, there remains in Subſtance of the Corporation Act yet
in Force no more than this, <hi>That no Man ſhall be Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
Elected or Choſen in or to any Offices, or Places, or
Truſts, or other Imployment relating to, or concerning the
Government of the reſpective Boroughs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>who has not
within One Year before ſuch Election taken the Sacrament
according to the Rites of the Church of</hi> England; <hi>in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault
whereof every ſuch Election is thereby declared to
be void.</hi> This being the full Import of the ſaid Act at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
it is upon that Foot a Meaſure muſt be taken, what
and how much the intended Bill would have enacted
new upon this Head; it cannot be amiſs here to obſerve,
that the Corporation Act was the firſt after the Reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which directly affected the Diſſenters as ſuch.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now</hi> in Corporations there are many Offices of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
and inferior Nature, (<hi>which cannot be fully ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
becauſe they are ſo various in the reſpective Boroughs</hi>)
whereon the Safety of the State does not appear manifeſtly
to depend, but regard only the Affairs of the particular Town
within it ſelf. Some of theſe are Freeholds, and many of
them the whole Subſiſtence of Families, which have been
obtained by Purchaſe or long Services, or attained by Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
of Courſe. Several of theſe the Diſſenters are now
poſſeſs'd of, and perhaps have enjoyed many Years, under an
Obedience to all ſuch Terms, as the Law now in being has
preſcribed; and to diſpoil Men of their Freeholds and
Poſſeſſions by a new Law, without Imputation of any
Crime; and when the Security of the Government does not
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0340001500:17"/>
appear manifeſtly concern'd, is ſure among Engliſh Alen very
hard.</p>
            <p>That the Diſſenters at this Day are not Diſaffected to
the Queen and Eſtabliſh'd Government, nor chargea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
with Rebellion paſt, nor meditating new Troubles, or
any ways dangerous to the State, (under which Characters
the Corporation-Act conſider'd them) the Preamble of this
very Bill now in Debate does intimate: For it aſſerts,
That <hi>the Act in the firſt Year of the Reign of the late
King</hi> William <hi>and Queen</hi> Mary, <hi>of Ever-glorious Memory,
entituled, An Act for Exempting Their Majeſties Proteſtant
Subjects, Diſſenting from the Church of</hi> England, <hi>from the
Penalties of certain Laws, was in due Conſideration, that
Perſecution for Conſcience only was contrary to the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Chriſtian Religion and Doctrine of the Church of</hi>
England.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If then the Diſſenters under an Obedience to all ſuch Terms
as the Law now in being has preſcribed,</hi> do poſſeſs many
inferior Offices in Corporations, which the preſent Bill,
when paſſed into an Act, would immediately ſeclude from;
beſides thoſe in the Magiſtracy, the Navy, the Cuſtoms,
the Exciſe, the Royal Houſhold, and others, which under
the Head of the Teſt-Act it would alſo deprive them of, then
(ſure enough) it takes from the Diſſenters, what they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
before by Law, and is not this to enact ſomething
new? <hi>Moreover, the Diſſenters at any time, upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Terms of Conforming, are now admittable to any Office
of what Quality ſoever in the Kingdom; but by this Bill they
would have a total Incapacity put upon them, in reſpect to
thoſe under the Teſt and Corporation Acts above-mentioned.</hi>
Which Incapacity after the firſt Offence would extend to
Offices of Inheritance, and in the Foreſts, Non Commiſſion
Offices in the Fleet, and many more, ſuch as neither the
Teſt or Corporation-Acts, or any other, ever did, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to exclude them from.</p>
            <p>It has been already inſiſted, That <hi>all the Offices wherein
the Safety of Church and State are manifeſtly concern'd,
are comprehended within the Teſt,</hi> and that the inferior Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
in the Boroughs do not come under the ſame Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0340001500:18"/>
to have therefore the ſame Reaſons of State urged
for an equal Animadverſion upon the latter, ſeems very
unequal; for it brings great Difficulty on the Commercial
Sort of Men, to argue on thoſe Topicks, while they plead
for no more than quiet Cohabi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ation with their Neighbours.
But if it be argued, that thoſe poor Emolumen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s in the
Boroughs, which the Safety of the Government might
(doubtleſs) well enough indulge them, came within the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
at leaſt of the Corporation-Act to deny to the Diſſenters,
how ſhould they judge of it but very ſevere, to have that
Act ſo explained and enforced to their Diſadvantage, that
it ſhould take Place more in the Reign of Her Gracious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
than it has done in any time preceding?</p>
            <p>In this Caſe the Diſſenters do humbly apologize for
themſelves (as it imports them) that granting whatever was
deſigned by this Bill, was the Intent then of the Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-Act,
they do not now ſtand in the ſame Place the laſt
Age did at the paſſing thereof; the preſent Generation it
cannot be pretended have brought upon the Church and
State, Confuſions, Ruin and Deſolation; they have no Ways
diſturbed the Peace of either, but have <hi>by Teſtimonies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conteſtible
ſhew'd, that neither their Principles or Practice
are inconſiſtent with Monarchy, but contrariwiſe moſt conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the preſent Government and Settlement of the Crown,
nor are there any evil Spirits working of Rebellion among
them.</hi> If therefore the Intent of the Corporation-Act was
built upon Reaſons peculiar to that time, they do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
ſubmit it to Conſideration, whether a purſuing of the
ſame Intent now, and giving (by the negative Qualification
and Penalties of this Bill) an Extent and Force to it, which
in the Inſtitution, or fince it never had before, without any
like Cauſe on their Part, would not be in the Nature of
puniſhing the Innocent for the ſake of the Guilty, which
they do not doubt will be far from ſo Wiſe, Juſt and Good
a Government; but the propoſed Bill they conceive upon the
Head only of the Corporation-Act, would have brought
upon them the extraordinary Hardſhips and Difficulties
here following.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0340001500:19"/>
1<hi>ſt,</hi> The Qualification for Offices being made to conſiſt
in the utmoſt Diſtance and Averſion unto them, will be a
Brand of Ignominy and Reproach upon the whole Body of
Diſſenters, ſo that an Emulation in caſting Injuries and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
upon them may in a little time be thought the beſt
Recommendation, and neareſt Way to Preferment; is it
juſt therefore that the whole Body ſhould ſuffer for the
ſake comparatively of a very few, who have occaſionally
Conformed?</p>
            <p>2<hi>dly,</hi> Reviving the Acts againſt Seditious Conventicles
in part, and giving a new Force to that of the Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
they fear will give too much Occaſion to Men of
violent Tempers, to declaim that they lye ſtill under the
ſame odious Imputations of Diſloyalty charged upon them
by thoſe Acts, as if they gave really any manner of Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie
to the State now; which Clamour (however cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs)
when it ſhall be induſtriouſly vented, would be in it
ſelf a very heavy Affliction.</p>
            <p>3<hi>dly, The Freeholds and Offices of an inferiour Nature,</hi>
in 600 Towns of <hi>England,</hi> or thereabouts, <hi>which have been
obtained by Purchaſe or long Services, or in Courſe, ſome
of them the whole Subſiſtence of Families, and of long time
poſſeſs'd, under an Obedience to all the Terms preſcribed
by Law,</hi> would not only be immediately loſt to the Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,
but an Incapacity would lye upon all Diſſenters for
the future of attaining the like, and (after the firſt Offence)
any other Offices in the Kingdom whatſoever; but they
hope <hi>the Crime charged upon ſome few of them, is not of
ſo deteſtable a Nature, that they ought all to be reduced to ſo
unhappy a Condition for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4<hi>thly, In many Corporations the Election of Members to
ſerve in Parliament, is only in ſuch as are concern'd in
the Government of them, and giving a Vote for a Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
in Parliament, is the eſſential Privilege whereby every En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhman
preſerves his Property, and whatſoever deprives
him of a Capacity for having ſuch Vote, deprives him of
his Birthright.</hi> The Magiſtracy of Corporations, which by
the Teſt-Act now takes Place is one thing, but the Offices
affected by the new Bill would be quite another.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0340001500:20"/>
5<hi>thly,</hi> There have been for ſeveral Towns and Cities
Acts paſſed of late Years, for ſetting the Poor on Work
therein, and puniſhing Vagrants, beſides the former ancient
Hoſpitals; touching which the Diſſenters are likely by this
Bill to have been excluded the appearing uſefully in their
Places, which is a Mark of Diſhonour on them, as well as
Diſcouragement to charitable Intentions.</p>
            <p>6thly, To leave Proteſtant Diſſenters ſubject to Fines and
Penalties, if they do not accept Offices (<hi>toties quoties</hi>) and
at the ſame time if they do accept, to reſtrain them upon
the ſevere Penalties of this Bill from doing what their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
obliges to, whether this would not (<hi>againſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of the Bill</hi>) be Perſecution for Conſcience ſake, <hi>all good
Men might be left to judge, but they only would feel,
and every Borough in</hi> England <hi>at Diſcretion be left to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
the Degree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7<hi>thly,</hi> The Diſſenters have Reaſon to fear innumerable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
and Oppreſſions (beſides theſe mention'd) would be
their Lot, in all municipal Rates, Freedoms, Duties, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges,
Services, Pariſh-Offices, and every ſort of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
with their Townſmen and Neighbours. When upon
Complaint of any ſuch Injuries thoſe Fellow-Citizens, who
only have Power to do them Juſtice, are like to ſuffer in
their own Reputations, Intereſts and Employments for ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as Favourers of the phanatical, excluded, Party.</p>
            <p>Theſe Conſiderations of their ſuffering, though they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
evident and unavoidable, are with all Candor and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation
referr'd to the Judgment of others; but the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters
muſt crave Leave to add, that they would be the
more pungent and ſenſible upon Perſons not chargeable by
the Bill with any Offence, becauſe without Penal Laws and
their Attendants, with the clamorous Inſults of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
and deſigning, the very diſſenting from the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
is in it ſelf (as to earthly Things) many ways a Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
which nothing but unpretended Conſcience (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
miſtaken) would oblige them to.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Penalties, which are the laſt Part of the
Bill, ſhall be conſider'd under Three Heads. 1<hi>ſt,</hi> What
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0340001500:21"/>
Sutableneſs there is in them to the Act of Indulgence.
2<hi>dly,</hi> What Proportion between the Proteſtant Diſſenters
and Popiſh. 3<hi>dly,</hi> What Danger from thence to the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</p>
            <p>1<hi>ſt,</hi>
For the Sutableneſs there is in theſe Penalties to
the Act of Indulgence; it may ſure be granted, that <hi>the
good Effects of Liberty to tender Conſciences are every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
viſible, that the foregoing Bitterneſs and Animoſities
are much calmed, the Diſſenters brought to a Temper of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
and more Candor towards the Church, and the Church
ſatisfied by ſufficient Experience, that the Freedom of others
does not leſſen Her Security and Reputation. Thus is our</hi>
Sion <hi>at Unity within Her ſelf, and the Unity of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in the Bond of Peace (according to the Prayer of our
Church) preſerv'd.</hi> One cannot therefore lay to Heart the
Peace of our <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> without ſome Concern, leſt the
Severities of this Bill ſhould contribute to diſturb it;
for beſides that it would diſpoſſeſs immediately Perſons
legally veſted with Places, and affect many Offices which
no Law did before, and many ways be injurious in the
Boroughs, and leave Men to occaſional Perſecution for
Conſcience ſake, and be a Brand upon all the Aſſemblies
of Diſſenters, as already has been inſtanced, there are in it
ſome further Peculiarities of Puniſhment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Before the Act of Indulgence, while Conventicles were Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legal
and Criminal Aſſemblies, even then a Man in Office,
who was preſent at them, was only liable to a
Fine of Ten Pounds, whereas by this Bill he is liable to
a Fine of 100 l. and 5 l.</hi> per Diem <hi>for Three Months, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
Loſs of his Place.</hi> The Sum you ſee may amount
to 550 l. which is more than would need to beggar ſome
Thouſands of Corporation; and other Officers in <hi>England,</hi>
whould be liable to it, and the more in Danger, becauſe
the whole Sum goes to the Informer, which is good Booty
for that ſort of Privateers; and the rather, when a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
on this Bill, would not be ſo difficult, as in moſt
other Caſes.</p>
            <p>The Diſſenters during the worſt of their Proſecutions here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore,
upon a viſible Conformity, without Renunciation or
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0340001500:22"/>
declared Abhorrence of their former Practice, were at any
time capable of Places of Profit and Truſt, but this Bill
draws over all their Heads a diſmal Cloud of Incapacity.
<hi>None will deny but a total Incapacity to ſerve his Prince and
Country is a Mark of high Infamy, ſo that next to the Loſs of
Life it ſeems the heavieſt Puniſhment, and in the ſeveral
Towns Corporate of</hi> England (which may probably be 6 or
700) <hi>to be rendred by Law incapable, of ever acquiring
the Support of any of thoſe little Places which appertain
to them, beſides thoſe of Profit under the Head of the Teſt-Act,
and thoſe many more (upon Conviction) which no Law
yet has ever affected, is altogether</hi> (if conſider'd) <hi>a very
unhapyy Condition; but after the immediate Forfeiture of
all the ſeveral Offices, now legally poſſeſs'd by the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
upon the Paſſing of this Bill, then a Perſon might
ſtill go to a Meeting, without Breach of any Law (as long
as the Toleration continues</hi>) and one would think ſuch a
Man were <hi>bonus &amp; legalis homo,</hi> and capable of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges
of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ree-born Subject, and at Liberty to provide
for his Family and Maintainance, but to impoſe a ſevere
Cenſure on any Action allowed by Law, ſeems very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable;
however that be, there would remain upon
all and every Man of the Diſſenters, an Incapacity not
only as above, but (after the firſt Offence) for any Office
or Imployment whatſoever within the Kingdom, in which
Regard this Bill would extend to Offices of Inheritance,
and in the Foreſts, Non-Commiſſion Offices in the Fleet,
with many more, which neither the Teſt or Corporation-Acts,
or any other, ever could affect, or ever intended ſo
to do.</p>
            <p>As to the Shame and Incapacity of one Convicted upon
this Bill; that is to ſay, <hi>before he ever again could enter
by Grant or Election, into any Office or Imployment within
the Kingdom of</hi> England, <hi>he muſt at the next Quarter-Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the County where he reſides, or in one of Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Courts at</hi> Weſtminſter, <hi>in publick and open Court
make Oath in writing, that within the Year foregoing he
has not once been preſent at any Conventicle, but has Three
times at the leaſt receiv'd the Sacrament at the Church;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0340001500:23"/>
which Oath is to be kept upon Record.</hi> This would not be ſo
much worthy of Conſideration, nor the Aggravation of the
Sentence on a ſecond Offence (as a Relapſe and Apoſtacy)
if the value of the Forfeiture, and Eaſineſs of Conviction,
did not put too much Hazard on the Innocent, even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſuch Purgation, as well as before it.</p>
            <p>2<hi>dly,</hi> The Proportion by the Penalties of this Bill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Proteſtant and Papiſt, is to be ſcanned by Two
Ways: <hi>Firſt,</hi> By examining whether they are equally lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to Loſs of Offices, and ſuffering the Puniſhments.
<hi>2dly,</hi> What Difference there is otherwiſe. For the <hi>firſt,</hi>
the Teſt being more expreſly contrived, to eject all Popiſh
Recuſants, and the Complexion of the Times ſince the
Grand Revolution, not favouring them, every Man will
agree with me, that the immediate Loſs to them upon
paſſing this Bill would be nothing, they have no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
in the Matter; but on the other Hand the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
(<hi>under the Terms hitherto required by Law</hi>) do poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs
many Offices, as has been diſtinctly intimated, the firſt
Loſs to them thereupon would upon many Accounts be very
conſiderable. Now for the Puniſhments ſufferable by this Bill,
the Diſſenters enjoying a Liberty upon Condition of open
Doors, a Conviction would at all times be more feaſable
upon them, than the Papiſts, who are enforced to conceal
their Worſhip by other Laws. Furthermore, the Nature
of the Proteſtant Worſhip requires all their Attendants at
once, whereas that of private Maſſes need not engage above
Five, beſides the Family in the ſame Inſtant. Thus the
Papiſt would not be ſo expoſed to the Forfeitures, Fine and
Incapacity, as the Proteſtant.</p>
            <p>The Difference otherwiſe between the Popiſh and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Diſſenter is no more than this; that whereas the
Teſt-Act did more expreſly intend the Papiſt, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
was but tacitly included, the Bill under Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
uſes ſuch Terms only as have been appropriate to Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,
and herein the Papiſt is but tacitly included, however
he is equally reach'd by the Intention and Penalties hereof;
and thus the Popiſh Diſſenter and Proteſtant do ſtand upon a
Par; but granting the Papiſt is not liable to Loſs of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0340001500:24"/>
at all, or to ſuffering the Penalties like the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
becauſe Conviction is more difficult upon him, <hi>no
Man is made liable to ſuffer ſo much by any other Law,
for aſſiſting at the ſolemneſt Acts of that Religion, as he
would by this Bill, for being preſent at a Conventicle. A
Popiſh Convict, receiving the Sacrament of the Church
is immediately clear'd; no ſuch Shame of Renuntiation;
no Incapacity lyes upon him. A Papiſt that ſhall relapſe,
and fall under a ſecond Conviction, is to be convicted over
again, without any Aggravation of his Cenſure. But Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
and good Policy require there ſhould be a Proportion
between the Offence and Puniſhment. Thus the Laws of</hi>
England <hi>have all along treated Papiſts as the moſt inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate,
reſtleſs and formidable Enemies of the State, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they depend upon a Foreign Power, and are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to it, which is ſuch a one as always was, and ever will
be imployed to ruin us, thereſore there has conſtantly been
a leſs degree of Puniſhment in the Laws upon the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Diſſenter than them.</hi> This Reaſon, if I be not miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
has a conſiderable Acceſſion of Weight to it in our
Days, the Papiſts having refuſed, ſince the late Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
their Allegiance to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> more than
ever from the early Days of the Reformation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Let us conſider what Danger would ariſe from
the Penalties of this Bill to the Innocent, for their Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſeems the higheſt Concern of all Laws. <hi>Now for the
Adminiſtrations in publick, according to the Liturgy of the
Church, though for want of it before Univerſity-Sermons,
or upon an Omiſſion of Prayer for the Royal Family, or
upon contravening the Practice of the Church of</hi> England,
<hi>Men would come within the Letter of this Bill, which
is a Condition not wholly out of Danger,</hi> yet 'tis likely the
obvious Deſign of it being againſt Diſſenters, would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a Proſecution in thoſe Caſes fruitleſs; <hi>however, Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Prayers differing from the Liturgy, at which ſhould be
preſent more than Five accidentally above the Houſhold,</hi>
(Circumſtances not uncommon) <hi>would clearly come within
Reach, and then the Villany of a couple of bad Servants</hi>
(diſmiſt perhaps for ill Practices) <hi>would have ſufficient En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement:</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:0340001500:25"/>
But the greateſt Danger to the Innocent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes
from Two Things in this Bill. <hi>Firſt,</hi> From the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of the Forfeiture, which may amount to 500 <hi>l.</hi> and
is all given to the Informers, <hi>a Temptation beyond what is
commonly ſet before them by our Laws, or what the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
of the Age can well aſſure us againſt; for a dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable
ſort of Men there has been, who for much leſs Gains
have done wrongfully to a great many, and proved a very
Nuſance to the Government, ſeveral of whom were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed
of Perjury about 20 Years ago. 2dly,</hi> The Eaſineſs
of Conviction is another Subject of Danger to the Innocent, for
<hi>as the Law in relation to Offices now ſtands, every Man
chuſes his own Witneſſes to receiving of the Sacrament;
whoſe Atteſtation, with that of the Miniſters and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardens,
being put upon Record, a Man is almoſt beyond
a Poſſibility of ſuffering by a falſe Accuſation.</hi> But in the
Bill before us 'tis not ſo ſafe, for <hi>falſe Witneſſes may chuſe
to aſſign ſuch a Time and Place</hi> (when they ſaw him at a
Meeting) <hi>as they know the Party leaſt likely to diſprove,
and the Accuſed in that Caſe has but a kind of Negative
Proof, to defend himſelf withal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As I have not preſumed to draw into Argument the
Diſpoſal of Offices, wherein the Safety of Church and
State did appear manifeſtly concern'd, ſo neither ſhall I
once enter into the Thoughts of thoſe high Affairs,
which might be any ways affected by this Bill; as whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the deſirable Union with <hi>Scotland</hi> may not be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baraſſed
thereby; whether putting all Foreign Churches
under a Cenſure may weaken the good Underſtanding,
which ought to be between <hi>England</hi> and her Proteſtant
Allies; whether this Expedient bears due Regard to the
Condition of like Affairs among our neareſt Neighbours,
<hi>Holland, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> or whether in time of ſo
dubious a War, eſpecially ſince a Pretender to our Throne
is ſet up by the Enemy, it be proper to do any thing,
which may raiſe Heats and Animoſities among our ſelves;
theſe being Matters cognizable only, by the proper Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of State, or the High Court of Parliament, and not fit
for private Perſons to debate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0340001500:26"/>
As to the grand Point of their Loyalty and due Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance,
which above all others the Diſſenters are concern'd
to vindicate themſelves about; Her Majeſties Loving Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
who (being Proteſtants, and by the Rights of Nature
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Men) lye under the Unhappineſs of diſſenting in
ſome ſmaller Matters of Religion, from the Eſtabliſh'd
Church, are abundantly ſatisfied from the Chriſtian-like
Preamble of this Bill, and otherwiſe, that in the Sacred
Breaſt of Her moſt Excellent Majeſty, and in thoſe alſo of
the Highly Honoured Lords and Commons of <hi>England,</hi> they
ſtand fully acquitted from the vile and deteſtable Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of any Principles repugnant to the Safety of this
Government; the Teſtimony of their own Conſciences
does equally concur, and their Behaviour ſhall (as they
hope it does) demonſtrate to all the World, that none of
their Fellow-Subjects can be more devoted to the preſent
Rightful and Lawful Settlement of the Crown; were
ſuch Imputations true, they could never with any Face
complain of whatever Hardſhips were put upon them;
but being in the Caſe of the preſent Government abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
before God and Men, they do always allow themſelves
to hope, that during their conſonant and uniform Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
no Difficulties or Diſtreſſes will be laid upon them;
and above all, nothing which may look like a Blemiſh
upon their Loyalty; Her moſt Gracious Majeſty (whom
God long preſerve) has ſeveral times expreſt her Pious
Parental Candor and Compaſſion unto them, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
without the Severity of Penal Laws, are for the
ſake of undiſſembled Conſcience daily under various Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Misfortunes, and as from that Diſpoſition of Her
Majeſties, they hold the Benefits of the Act of Indulgence,
(dear to them above all other earthly Conſiderations)
none can more ardently and ſincerely than they, conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
do, and will implore the choiceſt Bleſſings of Heaven,
upon Her Excellent Majeſty, and all their Governors.</p>
            <p>To diſſent from the Publick, they are ſenſible is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to be in the Wrong; but if inſtead of the few
Things ſcrupled, wherein they are involuntarily ſo, their
Union in the Eſſential, and more important Points of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0340001500:27"/>
with the Church, might find a due Conſideration,
they doubt not but all Reproaches upon them, of any
hoſtile Diſpoſitions towards it, would alſo be done away.
This is what, next to an affectionate Allegiance to the
State they could deſire moſt, to vindicate to themſelves
the Character of, and which they have for many Years,
by all Means ſo endeavour'd, that if the unfriendly Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of ſome Men, with the viſible Intereſt of the Papiſts,
had not hindred, the ſame would long e'er this have crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their Wiſhes with an univerſal Atteſtation: To diſſent
touching Matters civil and common, from any Society
we are in, I appeal to all Men, does it imply Ill-will to
it? Why then ſhould it be conſtrued ſo in the Caſe before
us? Or if we pleaſe, why not quite otherwiſe?</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> is it not as a City, which
has an ambitious and powerful Enemy in the Field? She
has indeed other Fortifications more near and proper, but
why may not the Diſſenters to her alſo be accounted, as
detached Outworks and Lines of Defence? Had ever the
common Enemy a Deſign immediate to execute upon this
City, but firſt his ſecret Engines were wrought to breed
Miſunderſtanding between the Town and her Dependants,
then open Attacks were made upon the ſeparated Forts;
and while many Storms have fallen upon thoſe, their Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
to the Town has been the more approv'd, but the
City it ſelf ſecure? No Perſecutions could extort any Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
from them for a Toleration of Popery. But after a
long and obſtinate Defence, when thoſe outward Poſts
came to be abandon'd and demoliſh'd, did not the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
ſoon get within the Town? The Papiſts ('tis true)
when once poſſeſs'd of their Conqueſt, to ſecure againſt
the Revolt of it, though before by open Force they had
taken and levell'd all thoſe Redoubts, did then officiouſly
erect them anew, thinking to ſerve their Intereſt of them:
But the Diſſenters, glad of Liberty indeed (who can blame
them?) no ſooner diſcover'd the Enemy's Deſign, then
they adhered to their ancient Mother and Principal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0340001500:28"/>
The Author hereof, to obviate undue Conſtructions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
thinks fit to declare he is not liable to the Loſs of any
Office by the foreſaid Bill, nor has he reaped any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
Advantage from the Revolution, or any ways from
the Government ſince; but the true Occaſion of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
was not ſo much a Reſpect to the Diſſenters, as
an accidental Computation in himſelf, of the flouriſhing
Eſtate of the Reformed Intereſt in <hi>Europe,</hi> in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement
of the laſt Century, and of the diſmal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clenſion
of it at the latter end, which gave him Occaſion
to reflect, that in Humane Appearance, the only defenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Bulwark of it now muſt conſiſt, in the Welfare of
our Government, and an indiſſoluble Union with <hi>Holland.</hi>
Upon which Occaſion, conſidering that <hi>the Indemnity of
Diſſenters from Penal Laws, was by the Act of Indulgence
declared an effectual Means to unite our Proteſtant Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Subjects
in Intereſt and Affection,</hi> He could not but
conclude, that the impoſing new Penalties and Sufferings
would diſunite them; and what can look more fatal
upon us than to ſee buried Animoſities flame out afreſh?
Who can tell but a Breach, when open'd, may, beyond
all our Foreſight, grow in time ſo wide, that the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſs
Uſurpations of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> may enter at it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But as to our Days, the Hope and Wiſhes of our

Direction, which the pious and prudent Authority over
us has preſcribed, in appointing on the late Solemn
