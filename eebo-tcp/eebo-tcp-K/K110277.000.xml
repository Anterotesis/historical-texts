            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE LIFE OF EDWARD MOORE.</head>
            <p>OF the life of this ingenious writer few particulars are known, and none reſpecting his deſcent, birth, education, or death; at leaſt none which we have been able to diſcover.</p>
            <p>Mr. Moore was bred a linendraper, but whether from a ſtronger attachment to the ſtudy than the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, from a more ardent zeal in the purſuit of fame than in the ſearch after fortune, or whether from the cauſe aſſigned by our Author himſelf in the Preface to the quarto edition of his works in 1756, that <q rend="inline margQuotes">"his marriage with the Muſes, like moſt other marriages into that noble family, was more from neceſſity than inclination,"</q> he quitted buſineſs to join the retinue of theſe ladies; and he certainly had a very happy and pleaſant talent in poetry. In his Trial of Selim the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian, which is a compliment to the firſt and worthy Lord Lyttelton, he has ſhewn himſelf a perfect maſter of the moſt elegant kind of panegyrick, that which is couched under the appearance of accuſation; and his
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0183801000:5"/>
Fables for the Female Sex, not only in the freedom and eaſe of the verfification, but alſo in the forcibleneſs of the moral and poignancy of the ſatire, approach nearer to the manner of Mr. Gay than any of the numerous imitations of that author which have been attempted ſince the publication of his Fables.</p>
            <p>As a dramatick writer Mr. Moore has by no means met with the ſucceſs his pieces have merited, which are three in number, The Foundling and Gil Blas, comedies, and The Gameſter, a tragedy. The firſt has been condemned for its ſuppoſed reſemblance to the celebrated comedy of The Conſcious Lovers; and The Gameſter met with a cold reception for no other apparent reaſon but becauſe it too nearly touched a favourite and faſhionable vice<note n="†" place="bottom">The Gameſter was alſo objected to as too proſaick in the language, and too horrible in the cataſtrophe, as obſerved and apologized for by the Author in his Preface to The Gameſter, quarto edition of 1756.</note>. Yet on the whole his plots are intereſting, his characters well drawn, his ſentiments delicate, and his language poetical and pleaſing; and what crowns all and more forcibly claims for his Writings publick notice, the greateſt purity pervades the whole, the obvious tendency of every piece being the promotion of morality and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; as is indeed obſerved by the Author himſelf in the Preface already referred to, when ſpeaking of his
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0183801000:6"/>
Writings in general; <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Such as the Work now is I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to the publick. Defects in it there are many.—Its merit (if it has any, and I may be allowed to name it) is its being natural and unaffected, and <hi>tending to promote virtue.</hi>"</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Moore married a lady of the name of Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, daughter to the Tabledecker to the Princeſſes: ſhe had a poetical turn, and has been ſaid to have aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her huſband in the writing of his plays. One ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen of her poetry was handed about before their marriage, and has ſince appeared in different collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſongs. It was addreſſed to a daughter of the famous Stephen Duck, and begins with the following ſtanza:<q>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Would you think it my Duck! for the fault I muſt own,</l>
                     <l>Your Jenny at laſt is quite covetous grown;</l>
                     <l>Tho' millions if Fortune ſhould laviſhly pour</l>
                     <l>I ſtill ſhould be wretched if I had not <hi>More.</hi>
                     </l>
                  </lg>
               </q> After half-a-dozen other ſtanzas, in which with great ingenuity and delicacy, and yet in a manner that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes a ſincere affection, ſhe has quibbled on our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's name, ſhe concludes with the following lines:<q>
                  <l>You will wonder my Girl! who this dear one can be</l>
                  <l>Whoſe merit can boaſt ſuch a conqueſt as me;</l>
                  <l>But you ſh' n't know his name, tho' I told you before;</l>
                  <l>It begins with an M, but I dare not ſay <hi>More.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In the year 1753 Mr. Moore commenced a weekly
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0183801000:7"/>
miſcellaneous paper entitled The World, by Adam Fitz-Adam, in which undertaking he was aſſiſted by Lord Cheſterfield and other diſtinguiſhed characters. This paper was collected and publiſhed in four vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes; and Mr. Moore died ſoon thereafter.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>MOST of the following Poems have already made their appearance in detached pieces, but as many of them were printed without a name I was adviſed by ſome particular friends to collect them into a volume and publiſh them by ſubſcription. The painful taſk of ſoliciting ſuch a ſubſcription was chiefly undertaken by thoſe friends, and with ſuch ſpirit and zeal that I ſhould be greatly wanting in gratitude if I neglected any opportunity either publick or private of making them my moſt ſincere acknowledgments. I am alſo obliged to a very valuable friend in Ireland for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable number of ſubſcribers in that kingdom, a liſt of whoſe names I have not been favoured with, and for which I was deſired not to delay publication. I mention this ſeeming neglect that my friends on that ſide the water may not accuſe me of any diſreſpect.</p>
            <p>Such as the Work now is I ſubmit it to the publick. Defects in it there are many, which I have wanted both time and abilities to amend as I could wiſh. Its merit (if it has any, and I may be allowed to name it) is its being natural and unaffected, and tending to promote virtue and good-humour. Thoſe parts of it that have been publiſhed ſingly had the good fortune to pleaſe; thoſe that are now added will I hope be no diſcredit to them. Upon the whole, I have ſent this my offspring into the world in as decent a dreſs as I
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0183801000:9"/>
was able: a legitimate one I am ſure it is; and if it ſhould be thought defective in ſtrength, ſpirit, or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, let it be conſidered that its father's marriage with the Muſes, like moſt other marriages into that noble family, was more from neceſſity than inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

The favours I have received at his hands, and the kind aſſurances he was pleaſed to give me of their continuance, which his death only prevented, have left me to lament my own private loſs amidſt the general concern. It is from theſe favours and aſſurances that I flatter myſelf with having a kind of privilege to addreſs your Grace upon this occaſion, and to entreat your patronage of the following ſheets. I pretended to no merit with Mr. Pelham except that of honouring his virtues, and wiſhing to have been ſerviceable to them: I pretend to no other with your Grace. My hopes are, that while you are fulfilling every generous intention of the brother whom you loved your Grace will not think me unworthy of ſome ſmall ſhare of that notice with which he was once pleaſed to honour me.</p>
