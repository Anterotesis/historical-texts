            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>ON the Feaſt of the Annunciation, the Young Queen went to the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the <hi>Incarnation.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador's Lady accompanied her thither; but tho' ſhe never ſo earneſtly deſired to have an opportunity to entertain her in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, ſhe could not find one ſingle moment to do it; for the vigilant <hi>Camarera</hi> would not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Queen that Liberty. At her return, ſhe ſerved Nine Poor Women at Dinner, and gave each of them a Suit of Apparel, and ſive Piſtols in their Purſe: The Maids of Honour carried the Diſhes; the Queen-Mother performed the ſame Ceremony on her ſide. But what infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely ſurprized the Queen, was to find a Billet privately ſlipt into her Pocket, and thus Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed:<q>For the QUEEN Alone.</q>

               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0148502702:2"/>
At firſt ſhe was in doubt, whether ſhe ought to open it or no; but preſently after ſhe had a mind to carry it to the King: Nevertheleſs the uncertainty of what was contained in it, and after what manner the King might take it, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with her at laſt to open it. It ſeemed to be written in a diſguiſed ſort of an Hand, and contained theſe Words in <hi>Spaniſh:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">
                  <hi>The Supreme Elevation of your Majeſty, and the mighty difference that is between us, has not been able to efface that Paſſion which your admirable Qualities have infuted into my Heart. I adore you, my Queen; I die in adoring you; and I dare ſay, that I am not unworthy to adore you: I ſee you, I ſigh after you; but you don't know my Sighs, you don't underſtand my ſecret Languiſhings; nay, you don't turn your Charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eyes upon me. Ah, Madam, how unhappy am I to be born a Subject, who find my ſelf poſſeſſed with the Inclinations of the greateſt King in the Univerſe.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The Queen continued ſome time ſurprized and aſtoniſhed: She could not imagine who this Raſh Perſon was, that had the hardineſs to write to her in theſe Terms; and did not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, but that the Billet was ſlipt into her Pocket by one of the Poor Women whom ſhe had ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. But then it appear'd very ſtrange, that a Man, who ſeem'd to be of great Quality, would truſt his Life (for nothing leſs was hazarded) into the Hands of a poor needy Creature; for ſuch ſhe muſt be that could approach the Queen that day. It was true indeed, that ſhe had been amongſt the Religious Women of the <hi>Inearnation:</hi> but although ſome of them might undertake this buſineſs, yet there was little probability to be
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0148502702:3"/>
lieve it, by reaſon of the Conſequences that would have proved fatal to the Party concerned, if ever the matter came to be diſcovered. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſhe thought, that perhaps it might be a Trick of the <hi>Camarera Mayor,</hi> to ſee what uſe ſhe made of this Billet, and then to acquaint the King with it, and turn the moſt Innocent thing in the World into a wrong ſenſe. After theſe different Reflections, at laſt ſhe judged it would be the ſafeſt way to diſcover the Matter to the Queen-Mother, and follow her Advice. She went the next day to dine with her, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſhew'd her the Letter, beſeeching her to keep it: That if the King came to know any thing of the matter, ſhe would be ſo kind as to teſtify the whole Truth. The Queen-Mother ſeeing that ſhe was diſcompoſed at it, aſſured her, that it was not worth the while to torment her ſelf about it; and from whatever Hands the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter came, if the King was diſquieted at it, ſhe would take care to acquaint him with the Truth: So that the Queen left her more at eaſe than ſhe was before, by reaſon of this aſſurance. On this day the Queen arrived to her Eighteenth Year: She received rhe Compliments of all the Lords, and the Ladies made her Preſents, particularly the Queen-Mother, who ſent her a Sett of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds and Turquoiſes. At Night there was a Conſort of <hi>French</hi> Muſick at the Palace.</p>
            <p>It was much about this time that the Envoy of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> parted from <hi>Madrid,</hi> complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and loudly threatning them with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's Reſentments. He came to receive ſeveral conſiderable Sums, which the Elector had ſent to the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> They had amuſed him a long time with many tedious delays, but at laſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0148502702:4"/>
gave him an Aſſignation to receive fifty thouſand Crowns of the Silver that was daily expected from the <hi>Indies.</hi> When the <hi>Flota</hi> was arrived, he went to <hi>Sevil,</hi> but his Journey had no ſucceſs, becauſe they had ordered the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of the <note n="*" place="margin">The <hi>Contration</hi> is a Council where they order all Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs relating to the <hi>Indies.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>Contration</hi> at <hi>Sevil</hi> to give him nothing. He came back to <hi>Madrid</hi> with all the Fury imaginable, to find himſelf treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſo little Reſpect: He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed his Importunities; and they for their part renewed their Promiſes: At laſt he was ſo wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with theſe continual Delays, whereby they ſtill put him off, that he demanded a poſitive An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and yet tarried longer than he had reſolved. But his Maſter being informed of the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, ordered him to take his Audience of Leave. The Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> would fain have ſtopt him, promiſing to pay down fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crowns in four Months: And perhaps the Envoy had ſtay'd in expectation of them, if he had not been otherwiſe ordered, although there was little probability that he would have received ſatisfaction at the time appointed; and ſo he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed this Propoſal. Then they offered him thirty thouſand Crowns in hand. He was upon the point of accepting them, when he was given to underſtand, that this would be paid him no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the reſt. This put him into a great Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which made him ſpeak ſo fiercely and freely to the Miniſters, that he did not ſpare them at all. He ſhew'd ſeveral Perſons a Letter from the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> which was full of Menaces, for the rude Treatment of his Envoy. The Night before he parted, they ſent him a Golden Chain worth a hundred and fifty Piſtols; but he returned
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0148502702:5"/>
it immediately back again to the Perſon who brought it to him from the King: The next day the ſame Chain was brought to him the ſecond time; but he ſent it back to the Chief Miniſter, and told him, He would rather ſay, he had loſt it upon the Road, than accept of a Preſent that was ſo unworthy of the Elector his Maſter.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, the Count <hi>de Gubernatis,</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy from <hi>Savoy,</hi> ſeeing that all his Solicitations and Inſtances for four years laſt paſt, had not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced his Negotiation in the leaſt; and that all the hopes they gave him of granting the ſame Honours to the Miniſters of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> as they received in <hi>France,</hi> were only dilatory Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to amuſe him, without ever deſigning to perform them; he departed from <hi>Madrid</hi> in a great Fury, which was ſo much the greater, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they refuſed to ſatisfy his Demands, in the payment of thoſe Subſidies that were due to his Maſter. Some of the other Envoys departed alſo with no leſs diſcontents; and as for thoſe that ſtay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d behind, they complained in their turns of the Ill Uſage they had received. But Foreigners were not the only Perſons that were diſguſted, the Subjects of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> were little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter uſed; and the Count <hi>de Balbo,</hi> with ſeveral <hi>Milaneſe</hi> Officers, returned to <hi>Italy,</hi> without being able to obtain what was due to them, or get the Recompence they demanded. It is indeed cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the King had no Funds; that the price of Victuals was not in the leaſt diminiſhed; that many poor Artiſans and Day-labourers died of Hunger; and that thoſe men who were ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be rich, had Billets often ſent to them to ſend their Money to ſuch and ſuch places, with great Menaces to Aſſaſſinate them in caſe they failed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0148502702:6"/>
Another Affair happened, upon which the Court had their Eyes fixt for a long time, and ſeveral Perſons of the higheſt Quality found themſelves Intereſted in it, by the means of the Prince <hi>d'Stillano,</hi> and the Count <hi>de Monterey.</hi> The firſt of theſe poſſeſs'd the place of Preſident of the Council of <hi>Flanders</hi> at <hi>Madrid</hi>; it was taken from him by <hi>Don Juan</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and conferred upon the Count de <hi>Monterey,</hi> who had never taken poſſeſſion of it. The pretence they uſed to ſet by the Prince <hi>de Stillano,</hi> was a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel raiſed for the purpoſe. He had been baniſhed, but was afterwards informed under hand, that he might, if he pleaſed, come back to <hi>Madrid:</hi> ſo he fell into the Snare, and returned. The K. and <hi>Don Juan</hi> ſeemed to be very angry with him, becauſe he preſumed to come back, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Majeſty's Order; and therefore to puniſh him, they beſtow'd his place upon the Count <hi>de Monterey,</hi> who at that time commanded the Army in <hi>Catalenia</hi>; and after this uſage were ſo far from revoking his Sentence, that they baniſhed him to his old place. The firſt thing the Count did after he had been ſummoned to the Court, was to demand the Oath of his Office, and the King promiſed to chuſe a convenient Opportunity to receive him: But the Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being informed of it by <hi>Don Geronimo d'Eguya,</hi> hindered the King from receiving the Oath of the Count <hi>de Monterey,</hi> becauſe ſhe had a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for the Prince <hi>d'Stillano,</hi> who was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther devoted to her Service. The Affair conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in this condition, till the Duke <hi>De Medina Celi</hi> was advanced to the Miniſtry, who aſſembled a <hi>Juncto</hi> at Cardinal <hi>Portocarero</hi>'s Palace, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the Reaſons of one ſide and t'other: The
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0148502702:7"/>
Cardinal preſided in it, and was aſſiſted by the King's and Qeeen-Mother's Confeſſors, by <hi>Don Benedetto</hi> and by <hi>Don Pedro Gil del Faro:</hi> They gave the Prince <hi>de Stillano</hi> to underſtand, that ſince his Majeſty had diſpoſed of his Place in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Count <hi>de Monterey,</hi> he had nothing left him to do, but only to ſubmit. To this the Prince anſwer'd, That by an ancient Law of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> the King could not take away his Place, without commencing a Proceſs againſt him. Upon this the <hi>Juncto</hi> broke up, but at their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Meeting concluded, That it was in the King's Power to diſpoſe of this Office, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a great Inclination to the Count, had deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it in his advantage. Whilſt the Prince <hi>de Stillano</hi> continued thus outed, the Queen-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was ſenſibly concerned at the Injuſtice that was done to one of her principal Servants; and ſhe was perſwaded, as well as the reſt of her Family, that they could reproach him with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but his faithful adhering to that Princeſs. He ſtill perſiſted in his Demands to have his Tryal come on; That ſince they had taken away his Place from him, as from a Criminal, they ought to treat him as one, and puniſh him according to his Faults. All the Queen-Mother's Faction joyned in the ſame Complaints; but that did not hinder the Count <hi>de Monterey</hi> from continuing ſtill in hir Place. It is true, that conſidering him Perſonally, he was more deſerving than the Prince <hi>de Stillano</hi>; that he had faithfully ſerved the King in <hi>Flanders,</hi> when he was Governour there, at a time when Affairs were in a tickliſh condition. He is a well-made agreeable Perſon, of great Abilities; and we ought to reckon amongſt his other good Qualities, his Alliance with the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0148502702:8"/>
Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi>; and this was no ſmall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, at a time when the Duke did whatever he pleaſed at Court: For Example, he nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Brother to be Vice-Roy of <hi>Mexico,</hi> which is a Poſt where they get a Prodigious Wealth in a ſhort time.</p>
            <p>The Preſident of the Council of <hi>Caſtile</hi> receiv'd about this time a <hi>Breve</hi> from the Pope, whereby he was enjoyn'd to repair immediately to <hi>Rome,</hi> to give an account of his Behaviour towards the <hi>Nuncio</hi>; but they were of Opinion here, that he was not obliged to obey it. It was known at <hi>Madrid,</hi> that the Viſitor-General of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> had ſent word to the Duke <hi>de Saint-Angelo,</hi> Dean of the Collateral Council, to depart out of <hi>Naples</hi> within three days, and to retire ſixty Miles off. He obey'd this Injunction, after having taken his Leave of the Vice Roy, and the moſt conſiderable Perſons of the City; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards went to <hi>Gaette</hi> with his whole Family. The Vice-Roy, who appeared in Favour of him, was very glad that the City of <hi>Naples</hi> had writ to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> about him, with a great deal of Zeal and Affection. The Viſitor-General enraged at the Courſe they had taken, ſent Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders immediately to the Duke <hi>de Monte Sardo,</hi> his Son in Law, to the Duke <hi>Della Regina,</hi> his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, and to all his other Relations, to be gone within an hour. The Luke <hi>Della Regina</hi> being a Magiſtrate of the City, pretended, that he could not be hindered from ſtaying in it. He ſummon'd his Friends together, and after he had repreſented to them the Injury that was done to himſelf in particular, he declared to them, that the Viſitor had a deſign to attack them too in general, as appeared by his ſevere
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0148502702:9"/>
examining the Conduct of the Princes and Barons of that Kingdom, although by their Priviledges they were exempted from it. 'Twas reſolved in this Aſſembly, to meet again the next day; and accordingly a great number of people came there. In ſhort, there came more than ſixty, who ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted out of themſelves the Prince <hi>Dotojano,</hi> of the Houſe <hi>de Medicis,</hi> the Prince <hi>de la Torella</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>Caraccioli,</hi> and the Duke <hi>de Matalone,</hi> of the Houſe <hi>de Caraffa:</hi> They went to find out the Vice-Roy, who voluntarily engaged to ſpeak to the Viſitor General; but he coldly told him, That he executed the Orders he had received from <hi>Spain.</hi> Hereupon the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Lords were extreamly diſſatisfied, and ſeveral of them wiſhed, that they had ſome Chief or other to head them, who was capable of a great Reſolution.</p>
            <p>For the better underſtanding of theſe <hi>Memoirs,</hi> I ought to acquaint the Reader, That the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, and even the Envoys, had a certain Right at <hi>Madrid,</hi> which exempted them from paying any Toll at the City Gates, for thoſe things that were neceſſary for their Families. This Cuſtom had been obſerved time out of mind; but it being diſcovered, that ſome perſons had extended this Priviledge farther than it ought to be, and that hereby the King ſuffered exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his Dues; the Council judged it expedient to convert it into a Sum of Mony, which was in effect paid by the Forreign Miniſters, and the <hi>Franquezas</hi> (for ſo they call this Right) were aboliſhed. There was likewiſe another Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which is called <hi>Immunidad del Barrio</hi>; that is to ſay, the Ambaſſadors have a certain Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct markt out about their Houſes, in which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0148502702:10"/>
compaſs Juſtice is not to be performed without their permiſſion, and the <hi>Alcaldes</hi> dare not paſs in the Ambaſſador's Quarter with their White Rods, which is the Badge of their Authority. Every Ambaſſador is ſo jealous to preſerve this Priviledge, that ſome Forreign Miniſters have been ſo hardy as to hang the <hi>Alguaſils</hi> at their Gates, when they found them treſpaſſing in this point. I muſt confeſs very few of them have carried things to this extremity, but ſeveral have ordered them to receive an hundred blows with a cudgel.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the apparent Riſque they run, and the Conſequences that ſuch Infractions might carry, the <hi>Corrigidor,</hi> accompanied with his Officers, paſſed at mid-day through the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter belonging to our Ambaſſador: They carried with them their White Rods; but he not being informed of it till they were quite gone, could only ſend to the <hi>Corrigidor</hi> to tell him, that he was extreamly ſurpriſed at his procedure, and that for the time to come, he ſhould remember his Duty better. He anſwer'd, That he was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, till he was now better informed, that the Ambaſſador's Quarter extended ſo far as the place through which he had paſſed; and that it was ſufficient he knew it now. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this ſort of ſatisfaction, the very ſame <hi>Corrigidor</hi> a few days after came by that way again, and paſs'd before the Ambaſſador's Houſe at a time when he was abroad. The Marquis <hi>de Villars</hi> being informed of it, complained loudly of this Inſolence.</p>
            <p>He expected with Impatience what would be the Reſult of the matter, when an Order from the King came to him, wherein his Majeſty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0148502702:11"/>
the Priviledges of his Quarter, pretending it was not juſt, that the Ambaſſador of <hi>France</hi> ſhould be more favourably treated at <hi>Madrid,</hi> than the Ambaſſador of <hi>Spain</hi> was at <hi>Paris.</hi> It was ſaid at Court, that in that great City the Officers of Juſtice went when they pleaſed up to the very Gates of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Functions of their reſpective Offices: That in the Year 1671. there was iſſued out a Declaration of the ſame Nature with this; that the renewing of it was no Novelty, and that ſince the firſt Declaration the Ambaſſadors had only enjoy'd this Priviledge by Sufferance, but that for the future they were reſolved to connive at it no more.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>de Villars</hi> anſwer'd, <hi>That he owed too great a reſpect to the King, ever to remove himſelf from it: That he was aſſured the King his Maſter would approve of the Propoſal to treat their Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, as they did his in</hi> Spain: <hi>but then they ought to conſider, what Priviledges that Miniſter has at the Court of</hi> France: <hi>That it was not neceſſary there to demand Audience and Permiſſion, which always retard Affairs, in order to ſpeak to the King and Queen, to ſee them, and accompany them; that he went a hunting with the King; that he aſſiſted at Feaſts, and other Ceremonies, as often as he pleaſed; that he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to have Six Horſes to his Coach, and ſo to drive all about</hi> Paris: <hi>That the Ambaſſadoris Lady went in the Queen's Coach; that ſhe ſometimes Dined with her, and that ſhe received ſeveral Marks of Diſtinction, all which ſerved to make an Embaſſy paſs very agreeable: That it ought to be conſidered, that he did not enjoy all theſe Advantages at</hi> Madrid: <hi>And laſtly, That he would take care to acquaint his Maſter with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of his Catholick Majeſty: That he could not</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0148502702:12"/>
               <hi>have an Anſwer immediately, by reaſon of the great diſtance; and that it was but reaſonable and juſt, that things ſhould continue in the Old State, till it arrived.</hi> But the King of <hi>Spain</hi> iſſued out a Second De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, wherein it was ſaid, That his Majeſty perſiſted in his firſt Reſolution, and that he thought fit to take away the Immunities of the <hi>Frenco</hi> Ambaſſador's Quarter, without aſſigning any Cauſe.</p>
            <p>'Tis indeed very ſurpriſing that Monſieur <hi>de Villars,</hi> who had reaſon to promiſe himſelf very advantageous Diſtinctions upon the Queen's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, ſhould be the only man, who was ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out from the reſt of the Ambaſſadors, to have his Franchiſes taken away from him, whilſt the others enjoy'd theirs as formerly. He did not fail to ſend Advice to the Court of <hi>France</hi> of what had happened; the King was ſenſibly concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at his Ill Uſage, and promiſed to ſee Juſtice done to him. But <hi>Monſieur</hi> deſiring, that things might not be carried to Extremities, neither on one ſide nor the other, writ a Letter to the Queen his Daughter, wherein he ſignified to her his great Trouble and Inquietude about this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair. He conjured her to uſe all her Intereſt with the King her Husband, to engage him to do his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty Juſtice. She was kept ignorant till this very moment, of what had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and was no leſs ſurpriſed than afflicted at it. She took occaſion to diſcourſe the King about it at a favourable Juncture, as ſhe imagined; but he anſwer'd her coldly enough, That it was a long time ago ſince this affair had been regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and that he would diſpenſe with himſelf for telling her the Reaſons. She earneſtly impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned him to acquaint her with them; and after
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0148502702:13"/>
infinite Sollicitations, he could only be brought to reply as follows:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eſque me quiteram eſte Embaxador, y me embi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aram otro Gavacho.</hi> Which ſignifies in our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; <hi>Let them take away this Ambaſſador from me, and ſend me another in his room.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is eaſie to judg, that the King ſpeaking in theſe Terms, was not only prejudiced againſt the Marqueſs <hi>de Villars,</hi> but alſo againſt any other that might be ſent to him. Whatſoever Intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties the Queen made to oblige him to ſettle mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the Eſtate they were formerly, yet he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſtill inflexible, and ſeem'd indeed to act in this Affair rather by another Spirit than his own, without making any Reflection, either he or his Council, that <hi>France</hi> would reſent the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury. But they awaked <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap> of their Lethargy, when they ſaw an Extraordinary Courier arrive on the 8<hi>th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> to the Marqueſs <hi>de Villars</hi>'s Houſe. They had terrible apprehenſions upon them, that he brought a Declaration of War along with him; and the Suſpitions they had enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a long time from the ſide of <hi>Italy,</hi> ſenſibly alarm'd them. Our Ambaſſador had Audience of the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> to demand the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhment of his Franchiſes, and the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of his Quarter. <hi>He repreſented to him the hardſhip of his Uſage, and the little reaſon they had to treat him after this manner, and to chooſe him from amongſt the reſt to be affronted: That the King his Maſter was never the Aggreſſor, but that he would not tamely ſuffer an Injury, without revenging it: That particularly he was ſenſible of this, and demanded pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſatisfaction for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke alledged, as he had done before, <hi>That ever ſince the Year</hi> 1671. <hi>the King of</hi> Spain <hi>was</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0148502702:14"/>
               <hi>reſolved not to grant the Franchiſes to the Ambaſſadors any longer, but that the Relaxation which time cauſes in every thing, was the reaſon that the Forreign Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters by little and little recovered their former Rights; That this was no good Conſequence, why it ſhould take place of the Law; and for a Teſtimony that they had no intention to diſguſt him in this particular, he might reſt aſſured, that for the time to come, all the other Ambaſſadors ſhould be treated after the ſame manner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this the Marqueſs <hi>de Villars</hi> made Anſwer; <hi>That inſtead of finding any particular Satisfaction for himſelf, he met with a new ſubject of Complaint, upon the ſcore of this General Conduct; That ſince the new Alliance that was contracted between the Two Crowns, the Natural Right warranted him to expect that the Ambaſſadors of one would eaſily merit Favours of the other, and even procure them for their Friends; that he was ſo far from meeting that Uſage, that he could get nothing for them but affronts; but that this was not the thing he demanded: That as for the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of</hi> 16-1. <hi>he was not obliged to take the leaſt notice of it, ſince having been Ambaſſador at</hi> Madrid<hi>, near four years ago, he peaceably enjoy'd all thoſe Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, which now they deſign to retrench him of, under the pretence of that Declaration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was not content with diſcourſing the Chief Miniſter about this Affair, but demanded Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the King, and immediately obtained it. So he preſented to him his Letters of Credence, to have this Affair regulated, and ſaid every thing that was neceſſary to engage him to make neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Reflections upon a thing that might draw after it ſuch evil Conſequences. <hi>He reminded him of the Peace that was ſo lately ſworn, and of the Marriage he had contracted with a Princeſs of the</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0148502702:15"/>
               <hi>Bood of</hi> France<hi>, and told him what little occaſion he had to diſguſt the moſt Chriſtian King; That in truth, his Maſter believed he did not act by his own Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and that upon this Conſideration he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to receive the Satisfaction he had ſo much reaſon to promiſe himſelf on his part.</hi> The King of <hi>Spain</hi> only anſwered with <note n="*" place="margin">We will ſee.</note>
               <hi>Veremos,</hi> according to his uſual Cuſtom.</p>
            <p>After this, it was deliberated in Council, what was neceſſary to be done in the buſineſs: The Council gave their Advice to the Chief Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and he to the King, as is the way in <hi>Spain.</hi> At laſt a Reſolution was taken up, that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>de Los Balbazez,</hi> who had been named to go Commiſſary to the Ambaſſador in <hi>France,</hi> ſhould give him Satisfaction. In purſuance to this Order, he went to the Palace of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>de Villars,</hi> and preſented to him a Paper that was ſigned, wherein was repreſented in terms full of Amity and Reſpect, <hi>That the King of</hi> Spain <hi>had given neceſſary Orders to his Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, to give that Anſwer and Satisfaction to his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, which he had demanded in his Letter; and that he came to aſſure him, That the King his Maſter had ſo great a regard to all the Motives of Friendſhip that united their Majeſties, that he would ſtill continue the Ambaſſador of</hi> France <hi>in all the Priviledges and Immunities of his Quarter; and that he ſhould likewiſe have the Right of the Franchiſes paid to him; That if he had them not till this preſent, it was only occaſioned by his own neglect to demand them; and that the King had never any deſign to take them away from him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a thing ſeldom practiſed in other Courts to begin Actions of this Nature, unleſs they have
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0148502702:16"/>
had an important occaſion to do it, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to abandon them with an Eaſineſs, which may in ſome meaſure be attributed to their great Weakneſs; but there are ſome places where this Conduct is more in Requeſt than others, and the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> is one of them. Some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were even perſwaded, that this deſign of taking away the Ambaſſador's Priviledges, was executed by the Miniſters, only out of a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Revenge, becauſe our King had ſent word to the Duke <hi>de Giovenezzo,</hi> that he was willing to give him at his Court all the Advantages that belonged to the Character of the Ambaſſador of <hi>Spain,</hi> wherewith he was inveſted; but that he had no Intention to leave him thoſe Liberties which he allowed to others. And he had a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Reaſon to obſerve this Conduct with him; for it is very well-known, that when he was in the Quality of Envoy at the Court of <hi>Savoy,</hi> he had buſied himſelf, without any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, to put them upon the Deſign of burning the Veſſels of <hi>Toulon,</hi> and the Magazines of <hi>Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerol:</hi> So that the King having very juſt Reaſons to look upon him as a particular Enemy, it was Natural enough to deny him thoſe Favours that are allowed to thoſe Perſons for whom we have an Eſteem. However it was if the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> was at the bottom mortified at this matter, they took care not to make it appear; and to take away from our King an Ambaſſador who was by no means agreeable to him, they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately named the Marqueſs <hi>de la Fuente</hi> to go and ſupply his Place. The Queen was extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfied to ſee the buſineſs of the Franchiſes terminate as ſhe deſired.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0148502702:17"/>
The King, who loved her tenderly, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all thoſe ſecret Enemies that did her ill Services with him, knowing that one of her greateſt Diverſions was to ride a hunting, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Three fine Horſes to be brought to her from <hi>Andaluſia.</hi> She choſe one of the moſt mettleſome, and mounted him; but ſhe was no ſooner got upon his back, but he began to caper, and was very like to have thrown himſelf backwards upon her, when ſhe fell: One of her Feet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily happened to hang in the Stirrup, and the Horſe finding this Embarras, ran about very furiouſly, and dragged the poor Queen after him, to the extream peril of her Life. This Accident happen'd in the Court of the Palace. The King beholding her from a Balcony, was brought to the laſt Deſpair; And though the Court was full of Perſons of Quality, and the Guards, yet no one durſt offer to go and help the Queen, becauſe it is not lawful for any body to touch her, and eſpecially by the Feet, unleſs it be the Chief of her <hi>Menins,</hi> or Pages, who puts on her Chiopins: Theſe are a ſort of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals, into which the Ladies put their Shooes, and make them appear very tall. The Queen always ſupports her ſelf upon one of her <hi>Menins,</hi> when ſhe walks any where; but theſe were Children too ſmall to reſcue her from the danger wherein ſhe was. At laſt, Two <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Knights, one of whom was named <hi>Don Louis de las Torres,</hi> and the other, <hi>Don Jaime de Soto-Mayor,</hi> reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, Whatever might happen, to deliver her: So one of them caught hold of the Horſe by the Bridle, and ſtopt him; the other took hold im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately of the Queen's Foot, took it out of the Stirrup, and put one of his fingers out of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0148502702:18"/>
Joynt in doing her this piece of Service: But without tarrying a moment, away they went to their Houſes, and preſently ordered their Horſes to be ſaddled, to eſcape the King's Indignation. The Young Count <hi>de Pannaranda,</hi> who was a Friend to both of them, approached the Queen, and told her very reſpectfully, That thoſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen who had been ſo happy as to ſave her Life, were yet in fear of loſing their own. She had the Goodneſs to ſpeak to the King in their favour, becauſe, as I mentioned before, no body was permitted to touch her, and particularly by the Feet. The King, who came down imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, to ſee in what a condition ſhe was, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified an extraordinary Joy to find ſhe was not hurt, and very kindly received the Requeſt ſhe made in behalf of theſe Generous Criminals. Word was immediately ſent to them, who by this time were got on Horſe-back to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: The Queen honoured them with a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and ever after had a particular Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for them.</p>
            <p>A few days after this Accident had befallen the Young Queen, ſhe received a ſmall diſguſt from the King upon this occaſion: She had a very pretty Spaniel with her, and the little Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture uſed to lie with her a Nights. The Queen happening to miſs her one Night got out of her Bed, and groped up and down the Room for her; the King too finding the Queen was not in Bed, got up likewiſe to find her. Behold them now in the midſt of a great Chamber, without any Light, going on one ſide and t'other, and rubbing their Shins againſt every thing they met; At laſt, the King being impatient, asked the Queen, Why ſhe got up? the Queen anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

him, To ſearch for her Spaniel: <hi>And is it worth the while,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>for a King and Queen of</hi> Spain <hi>to riſe out of their Beds, to find a little pitiful Bitch?</hi> Being thus vexed, he ſpurned the poor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>reature with his Foot, as ſhe came againſt his Legs, and was like to kill it. At the Cries ſhe made, the Queen, who loved the Bitch, could not forbear to complain in a ſweet man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and came to bed again very ſorrowful; but neither the King nor ſhe were able to find it again; and they were forced to call up the Queen's Women to bring them a Light. The next Morning the King went out very early a hunting all alone, without ſaying a word to the Queen. This diſquieted her all day long, and ſhe paſt the greateſt part of it leaning upon the Windows of her Chamber, although the Dutcheſs <hi>de Terra Nova</hi> frequently diſturbed her, and told her, <hi>That a Queen of</hi> Spain <hi>ought not to look out at a Window.</hi> All that day ſhe impatiently expected the King's return, and as ſoon as ever he lighted from his Horſe, met him about half the Stair-Caſe, and threw her ſelf about his Neck, with that agreeable <hi>French</hi> Liberty, which ſhe had not yet forgotten: He was perfectly charmed at it, and could not forbear to embrace her often, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it is not the Cuſtom in that Country, where their way of ſaluting the Ladies, is to preſs their Arms with their Hands. He was in ſo good a humour, that ſhe obtained leave for the Duke <hi>de Oſſone,</hi> to come back to Court, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute his Place of Great Maſter of the Horſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Juncta</hi> that was erected to determine the Affair between the <hi>Nuncio,</hi> and <hi>Don Juan de la Puente y Guebarra,</hi> Preſident of the Council of <hi>Caſtile</hi> decided it on the 12th of <hi>April.</hi> He was
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0148502702:20"/>
entenced to be baniſhed, and turned out of his Office. The <hi>Nuncio</hi> demanded of them, that they would oblige him to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> to take off the Suſpenſion he had incurred; but they thought they had puniſhed him ſufficiently. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of people ſaid, That theſe great Names he took upon him, did not belong to him; and that his true Name was <hi>Don Juan de Montefillo,</hi> and that he was barely a Gentleman of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Caſtile.</hi> He finiſhed the Courſe of his Studies at <hi>Salamanca,</hi> and afterwards was made Canon of <hi>Toledo.</hi> His Behaviour mightily plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Archbiſhop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> who was at that time Cardinal of <hi>Arragon,</hi> and taking a delight in his Converſation, truſted him with the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of all his Affairs. He acquitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo well in this Station, that the Archbiſhop took care to reccommend, and make him known to <hi>Don Juan</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> whom he extreamly pleaſed by the Suppleneſs of his Carriage, and the Vivacity of his <hi>Genius</hi>; And whether that Prince had any particular Deſigns upon him, or only intended to prefer him, to acquit himſelf of the Promiſe he had made to the Cardinal, he made him Preſident of the Chancery of <hi>Vallado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid.</hi> Sometime after the Count <hi>de Villambroſa,</hi> who was Preſident of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> happening to die, the Prince gave his Place to <hi>Don Juan de la Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ente.</hi> To ſay the truth, he only executed that Office by a Commiſſion; but it was a very great Poſt, and could not fail to draw the Envy of ſeveral Perſons upon him: And ſo it really did; for few people were concerned at his Misfortunes: They looked upon him as one of the Creatures of <hi>Don Juan</hi>; and thoſe that were always look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out for an Object for their Hatred, when
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0148502702:21"/>
that Prince was gone, vented all their Spleen and Indignation upon him. The people accuſed him of all their Grievances, and pretended, that he was the Cauſe of crying down the Money; That being in a Place which rendered him Chief of Juſtice and the Civil Government, he might, if he had been ſo minded, have found out ſome way or other to relieve ſo many different Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that ſuffered according to their Condition. But the Complaints of private Men, nay, even thoſe of the Publick in general, could not have been able to hurt him, if there had not been a neceſſity at that Juncture, to oblige the Pope, by reaſon of the Apprehenſions they had of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of the moſt Chriſtian King upon <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although the Office of the Preſident of <hi>Caſtile</hi> is the next in Dignity to that of the Chief Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, yet all People have not an equal deſire to poſſeſs it. <hi>Don Juan Aſcenſio,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Avila,</hi> whom the King nominated to it, refuſed it: An Order was ſent to him, to come immediately, but he deſired the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> to excuſe him, and leave him in his Dioceſs. He had formerly been a Religious of the <hi>Mercy,</hi> and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of his Order: However, as it is a hard matter to reſiſt the Will of one's Prince, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when it happens to be ſo advantageous as this was, he obey'd the ſecond Order that was ſent him, and came without any delay. He was a Perſon of great Diſcretion; and 'tis certain a Man cannot have too much to qualifie him for the Exerciſe of ſo conſiderable a Place: for the Council of <hi>Caſtile</hi> regulates all the Affairs that reſpect the Government of the States of <hi>Caſtile:</hi> it was firſt created in the Year 1245. by St. <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dmand,</hi> King of <hi>Caſtile</hi>; it is compoſed of a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0148502702:22"/>
and ſixteen Counſellors; the Preſident ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver makes any Viſits, and at his Houſe gives the Right Hand to no body. They ſummon to this Council the Chanceries of <hi>Granada</hi> and <hi>Vaillado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid,</hi> and the Courts of Judicature of <hi>Sevil</hi> and <hi>Gallicia,</hi> which are the Four Seats of Juſtice, where they determine, by way of Appeal, all the Suits that are judged by the <hi>Corrigidors</hi> in the Cities, and by the <hi>Alcades</hi> in the Villages: When the King ſpeaks of the Council of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> he barely calls it <hi>Our Council.</hi>

            <p>The Court was exceedingly troubled at the Advices they received, That the Vice-Roy of <hi>Naples,</hi> having with no ſmall pains, heaped to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the Sum of two hundred thouſand Crowns, part of which he had borrowed to ſend to <hi>Piom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bino, Portolongone, Orbitelle</hi> and ſome other places which the King of <hi>Spain</hi> poſſeſſes on the Coaſts of <hi>Tuſcany</hi>; the Money being embarked in a <hi>Folouque,</hi> Eight Slaves found the opportunity to carry off the Veſſel: Two ſmall Veſſels and a Galley were ſent after them to bring them back, but they were gone too far to be recovered: So all the pains of the Marqueſs <hi>de Los-Veles,</hi> tended only to ſet Eight Slaves at liberty, and enrich them for the remainder of their Lives.</p>
            <p>The Ambaſſador of <hi>Venice</hi> ſeeing that he of <hi>France</hi> received Satisfaction upon the occaſion of the Franchiſes and Immunities, redoubled his Inſtances to have Juſtice done him upon the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guazils,</hi> who had killed two of his Attendants. He received Satisfaction on the 17th of <hi>April.</hi> The <hi>Alcalde</hi> who led them on was baniſhed, and the <hi>Alguazils</hi> were ſent to Priſon, and were not enlarged but by his Intreaty.</p>

If the Count <hi>de Monterey</hi> was ſenſibly affected with Joy, to be preferr'd to the Prince <hi>de Aſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lano,</hi> as to the Preſidentſhip of <hi>Flanders,</hi> he was not a little diſguſted to ſee ſeveral Perſons made Counſellors of State before him; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he earneſtly deſired to be one of the number, he was diſappointed. The King named the Duke <hi>de Albuquerque</hi> General at Sea, the Count <hi>Doropeſa,</hi> who was very Young, and had no other Dignity as yet, the Marqueſs <hi>de Los Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lez</hi> Governor of <hi>Naples,</hi> the Duke <hi>de Villa Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſa</hi> Governor of <hi>Flanders, Don Melchior Navar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> who had been formerly Vice-Chancellor of <hi>Arragon,</hi> the Marqueſs <hi>de Manſera Mayor, Domo Major</hi> to the Queen-Mother, and the Inquiſitor-General, to be Members of this Council. It was commonly believed that the Queen-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had a great influence in naming moſt of theſe Lords. The Council of State was inſtituted by <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth in 1526. Here it is that they examine the Merits and Services of thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that pretend to be made Vice Roys, or to poſſeſs any other great Employments: They regulate the moſt important Affairs of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy; the King only is the Preſident of it, and the number of the Counſellors is not fixed.</p>
            <p>Moſt People were ſurprized, that <hi>Don Carlos Ramirez de Arrellano,</hi> was made Preſident of the <hi>Finances,</hi> on the 8th of <hi>April,</hi> after he had been ſo long chained and ſhut up for his Lunacy and Madneſs: He was choſen in the room of <hi>Don Antonio de Monſalve.</hi> No body could imagine for what Reaſon the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> thought fit to truſt him with a Poſt of that Conſequence; for he had none of thoſe Qualities that are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to make a Man capable of diſcharging it
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0148502702:24"/>
well; nay, he had ſome that ought to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded him. Amongſt the reſt, he was Son-in-Law to a <hi>Corrigider,</hi> named <hi>Don Franciſco de Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rera,</hi> who was mortally hated by the People; and 'tis ſaid, not without juſt Grounds; ſince he contributed not a little to the extream Miſeries un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which they groaned. The Council of <hi>Finances,</hi> which is there called <hi>de Hazienda,</hi> was eſtabliſhed in the Year 1602. by <hi>Philip</hi> III. It is their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to inſpect the Tribunal, which is called the <hi>Contaduria Mayor,</hi> and was ſet up by <hi>Philip</hi> the Second in 1574.</p>
            <p>A certain Accident happened at Court, which I cannot forbear to relate, although it is of little Conſequence. The Queen had two of the pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt Parrots in the World, which ſhe had brought along with her from <hi>France,</hi> and loved mightily: The Dutcheſs <hi>de Terra Nova</hi> thought to do a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious work in killing them, becauſe they could only talk <hi>French.</hi> One day when the Queen was gone out to take a Walk, and the Dutcheſs, to avoid going with her, and to put this Deſign in Execution, had pretended a ſlight Indiſpoſition; ſhe demanded the Parrots of the Woman that looked after them, and ſo without any more a-do, as ſoon as ever ſhe had got them into her Hands, wrung off their Necks, in ſpight of all the Prayers and Intreaties that were uſed to prevent her from killing them. This was a great Affliction to the poor <hi>French</hi> Women that waited upon the Queen, who when ſhe came back to her Apartment, commanded them to bring her Parrots and Dogs, as her cuſtom was always when the King was not there: for he cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d not endure any of theſe little creatures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they came from <hi>France</hi>; and whenever he
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0148502702:25"/>
ſaw them, he cry'd, <hi>Fuera, fuera, Peros Frances</hi>; that is to ſay, <hi>Out, out, you</hi> French <hi>Dogs.</hi> All the Queen's Women, inſtead of going to fetch what ſhe demanded, ſtared upon one another, and continued for ſome time immoveable, without daring to ſpeak a word; but at laſt, after a long ſilence, one of them gave her an account of the Execution which the <hi>Camerera</hi> had made of them She was extremly concerned, although ſhe took care not to diſcover it; but as ſoon as the Dutcheſs entred the Room, and according to her cuſtom, came to kiſs her Hand: The Queen, without ſpeaking a Syllable to her, gave her two Boxes on the Ear with her hand. Never was any thing in the World in ſuch a Rage and Surprize as the Dutcheſs was; for ſhe was one of the moſt haughty imperious Women living, and carried as much State and Grandeur: She poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as I mentioned before, a Kingdom in <hi>Mexico,</hi> and now to be buffeted by a young Queen, whom ſhe had hitherto treated like a Child; this appeared inſupportable; ſhe imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately flew out of the Room, ſaying all the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent things that her Anger ſuggeſted to her, and aſſembled together her Relations and Friends, and above four hundred Ladies: With this nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Train of Coaches, ſhe came to the King's Apartment, to demand Juſtice of him for the Affront ſhe pretended ſhe had received from the Queen: She made ſo great a Clamour, and ſhed ſo many Tears, that he ſent for the Queen to come to him: And as he repreſented to her the high Rank which the <hi>Camarera Mayor</hi> held in the World, the Queen interrupted him, and told him, without any heſitation, <hi>Senor, eſto es une antojo.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0148502702:26"/>
Theſe few unexpected Words clearly chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Face of Affairs: The King embraced her with a thouſand Teſtimonies of Joy; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, That ſhe had done very well; and that if Two Blows were not enough to ſatisfy her, he conſented ſhe ſhould give the Dutcheſs Two Dozen more. Now <hi>antojo</hi> ſignifies in the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Tongue, <hi>the Longing of a Woman with Child:</hi> And they are it ſeems convinced by long Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, That if Women with Child in that Country have not what they deſire, and don't do what they have a mind to do, they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered before their time of a dead Infant. The King, who believed the Queen was with Child, was raviſhed with Joy; and though he had a mighty kindneſs for the Dutcheſs, yet he exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly approved of the Queen's Action: So that all the Satisfaction ſhe received from him was this, <hi>Cailla os, eſt as bofetadus ſon hii as del antojo</hi>; That is to ſay, <hi>Hold your peace; theſe Blows are the Fruits of a Woman with Child.</hi> The Queen had ſo much Prudence and Addreſs, as not to take the leaſt notice of the Death of her Parrots: So that ſhe left the King no Room to imagine, that the <hi>antojo</hi> of boxing the Old Dutcheſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from her own Reſentments.</p>
            <p>The Marqueſs <hi>de Villa Menrique</hi> obtain'd the Vice-Royſhip of <hi>Peru,</hi> which is one of the moſt conſiderable Poſts, by the means of a pretty Lady, of whom the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly enamour'd.</p>
            <p>The King, the Queen, and the Queen-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, went together to <hi>Buen-Retiro</hi> to paſs the Holy Week there. After <hi>Eaſter</hi> was over, the King expreſſed a great deſire to go to <hi>Aranjuez,</hi> as it had always been the cuſtom: But the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0148502702:27"/>
Queen-Mother, who had no Inclinations to be at any great diſtance from <hi>Madrid,</hi> becauſe all Affairs were managed there, and the Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors never ſtir out of it; and likewiſe becauſe the Neighbourhood of <hi>Toledo,</hi> where ſhe had been formerly confined againſt her Will, revived a ſort of Horror in her, raiſed ſo many Obſtacles, that the King alter'd his Mind: So he ſtay'd but a very inconſiderable time at <hi>Buen-Retiro,</hi> and paſſed four days at the <hi>Eſcurial.</hi> He would only ſuffer himſelf to be accompanied by the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> the Maſter of the Horſe, one of the Gentlemen of his Bed-Chamber, and the <hi>Major domo.</hi> The next day after he was arrived, the Queen wrote a very tender Letter to him, and ſent him a Diamond-Ring. He ſent her, by way of return, a Chaplet made of the Wood of <hi>Calambour,</hi> garniſhed with Diamonds, in a little Box of Gold Filagreen, wherein he incloſed a Billet that had only theſe Words, <hi>Madam, there has been a great Wind; I have killed ſix Wolves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As ſoon as he returned to <hi>Madrid,</hi> the deſire of going to <hi>Aranjuez,</hi> ſeized him again. By a cuſtom that had been eſtabliſhed ever ſince the time of <hi>Philip</hi> II. the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> were uſed to go to this Noble Houſe ſome time after <hi>Eaſter.</hi> This is appointed in the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> of the Palace, which is a Rule they always fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: In it are to be found all the Ceremonies that are to be obſerved, the Habits which the Kings and Queens are to wear, the Time of their going to their Royal Houſes, how long they are to continue there; the Days of going to Chappel, as alſo thoſe for Bull-Feaſts, and running at the Ring; the Hour of their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties going to Bed, and Riſing; and a thouſand
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0148502702:28"/>
other things of the ſame Nature. But, as it happen'd, there was ſo great a ſcarcity of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, that the King was obliged to ſtay at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid:</hi> However, to excuſe and colour ſo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary a thing, they gave out, that the Small-Pox was at <hi>Aranjuez,</hi> which being ſcituated upon the Road to <hi>Malago,</hi> where the Plague raged, and from whence it might eaſily be ſpread thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, his Majeſty was not willing to hazard him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo far as to venture thither.</p>
            <p>The Court was troubled at the Advices they received on the firſt of <hi>May,</hi> That the Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>Fontarabia,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Andaye,</hi> had been lately engaged in a Quarrel about the Fiſhery of the River <hi>Bidaſſoa,</hi> which ſeparates the Two Kingdoms. They fought, and ſeveral Men were killed on both ſides: but what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned them the moſt, was, That the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Fontarabia,</hi> inſtead of ſending to part them, play'd the Cannon upon the <hi>French,</hi> and demoliſhed ſome Houſes in <hi>Andaye:</hi> So that to prevent the Conſequences, which might perhaps have proved very dangerous, they commanded him to repair the Houſes that were battered, and give the <hi>French</hi> Fiſhermen all the Satisfaction they deſired. Our Ambaſſador aſſured them, that he would write to his Maſter, and acquaint him with what readineſs and complaiſance this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair was made up at Court.</p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> offer'd to make the Marqueſs <hi>de Villa Franca</hi> Counſellor of State, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he would quit his Place of Lieutenant-General of the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> which the King had a mind to beſtow upon Prince <hi>Alexander Farneſe:</hi> but he returned him this Anſwer, <hi>That having Reaſon to flatter himſelf, that he had diſcharged</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0148502702:29"/>
               <hi>this Office well, he could never be prevailed with to throw it up to another, as long as he was capable of doing the Duties of it himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King's Confeſſor was upon the point of being ſent away about the beginning of <hi>May.</hi> The Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> deſigned that place for Father <hi>Bayona,</hi> Confeſſor of the Univerſity of <hi>Alcala</hi>; for he imagined he might reckon upon him, and beſide, the King had given his conſent. They had a mind to beſtow the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick of <hi>Plazencia</hi> upon Father <hi>Francis de Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lux,</hi> to have a favourable pretence to remove him: But he uſed all the Intereſt and Credit he had in the World to keep his old Poſt, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; That he would refuſe the Biſhoprick; and that if the King turned him off, he would every-where complain of the Chief Miniſter. Although the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> hated him heartily, becauſe he was difficult of Acceſs, and having a great Aſcendant over the King, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd him with ſeveral Scruples, in order to purſue his own particular Views; yet he was forced to let him alone. Every one is of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the Duke had done much more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly, not to have diſcovered his Intentions againſt him, unleſs he had been in a capacity to put them in Execution, becauſe to ſhew an ill Will, and not be able to effect our Deſigns, only draws more Enemies upon our heads, and expoſes us to the contempt of all the World, which will be apt to conclude we only are too weak. But this was not all; he left in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Confeſſor a Man that was always with the King, and who was ſure to oppoſe him in every thing; but that was not the only thing he had Reaſon to apprehend. The <hi>Cama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rera</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0148502702:30"/>
               <hi>Mayor,</hi> and <hi>Don Jeronimo de Eguya,</hi> ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to poſſeſs the King's Favours; They had opportunity to diſcourſe him as often as they pleaſed, by vertue of their Places, and neglected no occaſions to advance and ſecure their own Intereſt. This was a ſort of a <hi>Triumvirate,</hi> which might very well check the Authority of the Chief Miniſter; he very well ſaw what he was to fear from this quarter, and was extreamly concerned at it; he had long ago deſired to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move <hi>de Eguya,</hi> but he fixed himſelf every day more and more in the King's good Graces; and the Death of <hi>Don Pedro Fernandez del Campo,</hi> left him in the intire poſſeſſion of a Place, which before he had only exerciſed by a Commiſſion. He likewiſe obtained a Place of being a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor in the Chamber of the <hi>Indies</hi>; and when the Duke uſed all his Endeavours to remove him from buſineſs, he perceived that the King's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination prevailed above all his Attempts to the contrary; for his Majeſty was perſuaded, that <hi>de Eguya</hi> was faithful and neceſſary to him. The Dutcheſs <hi>de Terra N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>vo,</hi> as well as the Confeſſor, confirmed him in this Opinion: So that they rendred one another all good Offices recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally; and this was a ſure and eaſy way to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port themſelves.</p>
            <p>Ever ſince the Night that the <hi>Camarera Mayor</hi> had received that Chaſtiſement from the Queen, after a long conſideration of the matter, ſhe found, that if ſhe continu'd to obſerve the ſame rigorous Conduct towards that young Princeſs, which ſhe had hitherto uſed, ſhe could never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate her ſelf into her Affections. Beſides this, ſhe knew that the Queen-Mother utterly diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved this ſort of Treatment, and that ſhe had
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0148502702:31"/>
frequently ſpoke to the King her Son about it; that ſhe had repreſented to him, that there was ſo vaſt a difference between the Cuſtoms of <hi>France</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Spain,</hi> that there was a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to make ſome Allowances, and not to perplex a Young Princeſs, whoſe Age, as well as the Sweetneſs of her Temper, deſerved ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort of Uſage. The <hi>Camarera</hi> look'd upon her ſelf as undone, if ſhe did not lay aſide all her former Severity; and theſe conſiderations pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with her to aſſume a more engaging Air, and to endeavour to relieve the Queen in all her penſive moments, by diſcovering the King's Humour to her, and the means to pleaſe him. Whenever the King was vex'd, and out of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, ſhe ſeem'd to ſpare no pains to ſweeren him; and the Queen being of a frank, eaſy Diſpoſition, was immediately perſwaded, that the Dutcheſs had taken up a better Temper, and even believed, that ſhe did her all the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices ſhe could. But the reſt of the World were of a different Opinion from her Majeſty; they knew well enough that this Old <hi>Belldame</hi> was rather inclined in her own Nature, to throw Oil into the fire, than endeavour to quench it; and they alledged, as an indiſputable Proof of this, all the ill impreſſions ſhe had made upon the King, in relation to the <hi>French</hi>; nay, even the moſt inconſiderable things that came from <hi>France:</hi> For, as I ſignified before, the Queen durſt not play with the little Dogs ſhe had brought along with her, before the King; and the two Parrots were killed for no other reaſon but becauſe they talked <hi>French:</hi> The King was out of humour as oft as any <hi>Frenchman</hi> paſſed through the Court of the Palace, eſpecially if the Queen looked upon
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0148502702:32"/>
him, although it was through the Windows and Lattices of her Chamber.</p>
            <p>As ſhe was going one day to our Ladies Church, <hi>Datocha,</hi> a poor fellow, who was a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> came to her Coach, and begged an Alms of her; the King was in ſo horrible a Paſſion, that they were afraid he would have cauſed this Unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Wretch to be killed immediately. The <hi>Camerera</hi> officiouſly counſell'd the Queen to order him to leave <hi>Madrid</hi> without any delay; but if the Dutcheſs had not prejudiced the King after this manner, it is not to be imagined that the Queen had been expoſed to theſe Injuries which happened ſo often to her.</p>
            <p>This is ſo undeniable a truth, that one day when their Majeſties went into the City, two Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men belonging to the Ambaſſador of <hi>Holland,</hi> chancing to meet them, they ſtopt their Coach, out of Reſpect, and ſaluted them as they ought: They were on that ſide the Queen happened to be of, and were apparelled after the <hi>French</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion. This immediately raiſed the <hi>Camarera</hi>'s Paſſion, who commanded one of the Guards to go and demand of them who they were, from whence they came, whither they were going, what buſineſs they had in <hi>Madrid?</hi> And when to this they anſwered, That they were both <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> in the Ambaſſador's Retinue, ſhe believed it to be a Sham, or at leaſt pretended to believe it, that ſhe might give the King a freſh occaſion to commend her Care and Zeal for him: So that ſhe ſent to the Ambaſſador himſelf to be better ſatisfied; and when ſhe was fully aſſured of the truth, ſhe ſent the two Gentlemen word, That when they met their Majeſties, they ſhould never be guilty of the Preſumption any more to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0148502702:33"/>
go on the Queen's ſide, to ſalute her, or look upon her. Nevertheleſs, obſerving the Queen to be concerned at this Conduct, as ſoon as ſhe was informed of it, ſhe thought to efface all this out of her Mind, by ſending often to the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador, and giving him to underſtand that ſhe was angry with him for coming ſo ſeldom to the Palace. She uſed the ſame Expreſſions to the Ambaſſador's Lady, and told her, That it would be the greateſt Joy in the World to her to ſee them viſit the Young Queen oftner, who perhaps was too melancholy in private, and would certainly find no ſmall Diverſion to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Company of Perſons of their Merit, and who were of the ſame Country with her. This did not make the Marqueſs <hi>de Villars</hi> alter his Conduct in the leaſt; for he underſtood well enough what was the meaning of theſe fair Speeches; but as for his Lady, there ſeldom paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a day but ſhe went to wait upon the Queen, either in the Queen-Mother's company, or all alone by her ſelf; but notwithſtanding the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiduity of her Viſits, ſhe ſeldom found an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to entertain her in private: She was hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered from doing this by the preſence of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ladies, who came to make their Court; or elſe by the King's coming, who went every other moment from his own Apartment to the Queen's; for 'tis the Cuſtom there, that as ſoon as he appears, all the Women that are in the Chamber do immediately withdraw.</p>
            <p>Without reckoning the Penance of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Solitude, the Queen had other things to afflict her, and one was to find her ſelf clearly deſtitute of Money; and this, conſidering the Generoſity of her Heart, and her natural Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0148502702:34"/>
to be liberal, was a very ſenſible Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. She had lived there ſix Months intire, without having any Money to ſerve her for her leſſer pleaſures; and ſhe was forced to borrow a little, to buy a few things ſhe had neceſſary occaſion for, and to keep a few Horſes ſhe had brought with her out of <hi>France,</hi> that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come altogether unſerviceable to her, becauſe ſhe had no permiſſion to ride them out at any time. She wanted Money likewiſe to ſend back ſome of her Women that could not comply with the Cuſtoms of <hi>Spain,</hi> and whom they could not conſequently endure there. The few Officers that ſhe was allowed to bring with her, were all diſmiſt, even to her Chyrurgeon, who had bought the Place, and performed the Journey at his own Expences. All of them departed; and this conſideration redoubled the young Queen's Afflictions, to ſee ſhe was not Miſtriſs enough to keep them any longer, or to do them thoſe kindneſſes ſhe deſigned. On the 15<hi>th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 500 Piſtols a Month were aſſigned her; but this was in a manner leſs than nothing, becauſe for ſix Months together ſhe had been forced to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Money, and even out of this ſmall Sum ſhe was obliged to lay aſide 200 Piſtols monthly for ſome Alms and Charity, which the Queens of <hi>Spain</hi> were accuſtomed to make. All this while no Orders were given out about the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Money of the Kingdom, nor was the Price of Victuals regulated; a great Want and Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city reigned every where, and the Publick Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries daily increaſed: it had not rained for ſix Months together, and this very much contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to inhance the Price of Corn: So that the People were reduced to the laſt Extremities:
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0148502702:35"/>
Nay, what is infinitely more ſurpriſing, they were not in a condition to pay the Queen the Money that was aſſigned to her, Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver being ſo ſcarce, that none of it was to be ſeen.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Aquila</hi> being arrived at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi> took poſſeſſion of his Place of Preſident of <hi>Caſtile</hi>; and the firſt of his Cares was to relieve and eaſe the People of their Grievances. To effect this, he made a ſtrict Examination into the moſt minute matters, and ſoon diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, that the groſs Monopolies, and inſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Avarice of the Magiſtrates, were partly the occaſion of theſe horrid Diſorders. He came to be informed, That even the Counſellors of the Council Royal, by ſome of their Creatures, took their ſhares of the Impoſts that were laid upon Victuals; and that the ſome thing was done in the Oil, Chocolat, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

But he was ſenſible that he was not able to rectifie theſe Abuſes alone; ſo he diſcourſed the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> about the matter, whoſe Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Aſſiſtance he promiſed himſelf. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, whether the Duke were otherwiſe employed, or had no real intentions to change the Form of the Government, he did not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Preſident's Deſires, who perceiving that if he acted by himſelf, the hatred of all thoſe Perſons whom he ſhould cauſe to be puniſhed, would directly fall upon his own Head, he was not willing to Sacrifice himſelf for the Publick

Good. He remembred that in the time of the Regency, a certain Biſhop, who was Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as he was, having endeavoured to ſuppreſs theſe Abuſes, had been poiſoned by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates.</p>
            <p>In the mean time every thing without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion continued to be as dear as formerly, and Silver was ſo ſcarce a Commodity, that one would have imagined it had been all melted down; I once ſaw at a Relation's Houſe of mine the Sum of almoſt three thouſand Crowns received in Pieces of <hi>Bellon</hi> and in <hi>Ochavos</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Theſe are much of the ſame value with the <hi>French</hi> Doubles, and are ſcarce an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Farthing</note>, which are a wretched ſort of Braſs Money, and for the greateſt part bad, and yet happy was the Man who in this Univerſal Scarcity could get this Money. However, I am obliged to ſay this in honour of <hi>Spain,</hi> that although the Finances were in that ſad condition as I repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented them before, yet the King paid all the Penſions that were due to Foreigners very exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe he looked upon himſelf obliged in Honour to do it, and yet to confeſs a truth, ſome of theſe Penſions were not inconſiderable. I knew a certain Lady, to whom he gave Eight Thouſand Crowns, and they were conſtantly paid her in the moſt difficult times.</p>
            <p>The Families that were ready to die of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ſet themſelves to Rob and Murder, being in a manner Authorized in theſe Diſorders by the little care that was taken to puniſh Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as they deſerved, and by the extraordinary Partiality which the Judges ſhew to the Natives of the Country. Theſe Families, I ſay, that were very numerous at <hi>Madrid,</hi> aſſembled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

in one of the leaſt frequented Quarters of the Town, and reſolved by main force to break open ſome of the Magiſtrates Houſes, becauſe they principally charged them with the Diſorders of the preſent Affairs, and afterwards to Plunder them in the face of the World, to ſerve for an Example to others. But as this Deſign was only formed by a Mutinous Rabble, who had never a Head to lead them on, ſo it is not to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred if they did not puſh their wicked Intentions any farther. In ſhort, every Man return'd to his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Occupation, and none of them were call'd to an Account for Aſſembling after this Tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous manner. Behold now the Effects which this ſort of Connivance and Toleration always produces.</p>
            <p>The Shoemakers being informed about the middle of <hi>May,</hi> that the Price of Shoes was ordered to be regulated, preſented a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition to the new Preſident of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> wherein with terms full of Reſpect they repreſented their Reaſons againſt this Regulation, making it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that they could not poſſibly leſſen the Price of Shoes, as long as Leather was ſold ſo dear as it was. He ſent them to the Preſident of the Chamber of the <hi>Alcaldles</hi>; ſo they formed themſelves into a ſort of a Body, to meet him with the greater Ceremony: but he being a Man of a ſour ſullen Humour, fell into a Paſſion to ſee ſo great a number of them; he threatned to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon them, and told them, that if their Power were equal to their ill Intentions, they were to be feared, becauſe they were neither better nor worſe than downright Mutineers. They mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered a few words, and being at that time none of the ſtrongeſt, went in a Body to find out their
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0148502702:38"/>
Companions and Friends, and then immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately repaired to the Court of the Palace. They ran under the Windows of the King's Chamber, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

               </gap> it is the Cuſtom there when the People complain of the Government, they cried out as loud as they were able, <hi>Let the King live, and let the ill Government die.</hi> As ſoon as the King per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it, he came near the Window, and was extreamly ſurprized to ſee ſo great a Rabble got together, for by this time abundance of other People had joined them. The King ſent in g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eat haſte to find out the Preſident of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> who came amongſt them, and promiſed them all the ſatisfaction imaginable: He moreover told them, they violated that Reſpect they owed His Majeſty, in coming to demand Juſtice of him with ſuch Clamours and Tumults, and that if they would follow him home, he would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently content them. They very readily went along with him, ſo he gave them a permiſſion to ſell their Shoes at the ſame Price as they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Order was publiſhed. This made them return the joyfulleſt People in the World; but they happened to meet the Preſident of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caldes</hi> in the way, who not knowing a Syllable of what had paſt, and not at all conſidering that he had to do with an unruly Mob, ſtopt them to vent his Reproaches and Menaces againſt them. But this procedure raiſed their Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo high, that they drew out their Swords with a deſign to kill him, and purſued him ſo fiercely, that never was any Man under more terrible Apprehenſions. He had never eſcaped their hands, had not their Fury ſo far tranſported them, that they took no notice how he ſaved himſelf through a little Gate, which he took
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0148502702:39"/>
care to ſhut after him; but his fear was ſo great, that he fell dangerouſly ill upon it. After they had ſearched for him on all ſides to no purpoſe, they were going homewards, when they ſaw the Preſident of <hi>Caſtile</hi> coming that way; they preſently ſurrounded him, and ſwore they would not let him paſs any farther, till he had ſigned the Permiſſion he had givem them to ſell their Shoes at the ordinary Price. He immediately did every thing they demanded of him; ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any delay they took Drums and Trumpets to publiſh and affix this Permiſſion to all the Publick places of the City. They ſuffered this firſt Heat to paſs over without Oppoſition, but afterwards they arreſted ſeveral of thoſe whom they found the moſt Seditious; nevertheleſs they tarried but a ſhort time in Priſon, and what deſerved an Exemplary Chaſtiſement, was pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed like an inconſiderable Trifle. It is indeed very true, that in order to humble the People, it was propoſed to forbid all manner of Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to carry Swords about them, and to wear black Silk Cloathes with the <hi>Golilia.</hi> 'Twas likewiſe deſigned that this Prohibition ſhould extend to all thoſe Perſons who had no Titles, and were not able to keep a Coach: However they durſt not put it in execution, becauſe they thought this Regulation would be too difficult and ſevere to be practiſed.</p>
            <p>The Vice-Roy of <hi>Naples</hi> was not a little afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the loſs of the Money which the eight Slaves had carried away with them. He was obliged to get more, but it was no eaſie matter to find it in a place where they were burthen'd every day with Impoſts upon Impoſts. He received Orders from <hi>Madrid</hi> to Let out the Lands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0148502702:40"/>
to the King's Demain at forty thouſand Crowns <hi>per Annum</hi>; but no body could be found to take them, although thoſe Perſons who had formerly taken them, enjoy'd them peaceably; and this Example one would have thought ought to have encouraged others to imitate them. The <hi>Banditti</hi> of that Country had for ſome time ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended all Acts of Hoſtility, out of hopes that His Majeſty would have given them a General Indemnity upon the ſcore of his Marriage; but when they perceived that their Expectations were like to be fruſtrated, and that endeavours were uſed to Apprehend their Captain <hi>Mattheo Tango,</hi> who was juſt come from Pirateering at Sea, they met to the number of Three Thouſand, pillaging and ravaging every thing they found in the Country, and, what is ſtrange, not a word was ſpoken of the horrible Diſorders they committed.</p>
            <p>The Queen Mother, who was every day at <hi>Buen Retiro,</hi> and ſearched all means to gain the Affections of the People, gave three Comedies, with Muſick between the Acts, that were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented on a Theatre in the <hi>Placa Mayor,</hi> that abundance of People might have the pleaſure of ſeeing them without putting them to any Expence. The Comedians play'd for three days together, and the crowd was ſo great, that ſome People were killed. The City ſeemed to be very well pleaſed with theſe Shews, for they love them more in <hi>Spain</hi> than in any other part of the World; and what helped to ſuſtain the publick Joy, was the mighty Expectation they had of ſeeing a new face af Affairs, under the Miniſtry of the Duke <hi>ae Medina Celi:</hi> they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed themſelves to find an end of all their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0148502702:41"/>
Grievances, without conſidering, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his intentions were never ſo good, it would be a difficult matter to redreſs them. He had <hi>Don Vincente Gonzaga</hi> for his Friend, who was very capable to adviſe him and furniſh him with all neceſſary Expedients to accompliſh his Deſigns, but the execution of them ſeemed to carry almoſt invincible difficulties along with it. There was a neceſſity to be ſevere, to diſguſt ſome, and puniſh others; to remove ſeveral things that had been long eſtabliſhed; to give ones ſelf up entirely to Buſineſs, and conſtant Application, before theſe matters could ever be accompliſhed: But this was not the Genius of the Duke, and his Natural Sweetneſs and Bounty ſuited but very ill with that ſteadineſs and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution that ought to be obſerved in theſe nice rancounters. This gave him abundance of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy thoughts; ſo that <hi>Don Vincente,</hi> who ſtill preſs'd him to take up ſteady Meaſures, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them with vigour, had opportunity enough to diſcover his Weakneſs. To deliver himſelf therefore from ſo rigid and ſevere a Superviſor, the Duke gave him the Government (as 'tis called there) of the Council of the <hi>Indies,</hi> upon Condition that he himſelf ſhould always be the Preſident of it; but as for the Profits, one had as great a ſhare as the other. And now <hi>Don Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cente</hi> thought of nothing more than diſcharging the Duties of his New Place, and it was not doubted but he would worthily exerciſe them; for his Judgment, his Age, and his Experience made him to be conſidered as one of the Chief Perſons of the Council.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:0148502702:42"/>
In the mean time ſeveral People of great Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Birth were diſpleaſed to ſhe the Duke confided in him no longer, they were in hopes that they would have joyned together to Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Money. The good was diminiſhed, as I ſaid before, and the bad continued to go as freely as formerly it did. It was therefore reſolved to ſuppreſs it for good and all in Commerce, and an Edict was publiſhed on the 24<hi>th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 1680. by which the King ſuppreſſed all the Copper Money that had gone for ſeveral Years, and People were ordered to bring it in within Ten Days to certain Offices that were ſet up in all parts of <hi>Madrid,</hi> where they were to receive Bills of Exchange for it, that were payable in Six Months. But they found a vaſt inconvenience in the Execution of this Project; for in the two <hi>Caſtiles</hi> they had ſixteen Millions of this Money, part of which were mixed with good Silver, and the other was notoriouſly bad. So that to draw theſe ſixteen Millions out of the hands of private Perſons, they found in the King's Coffers a Fund of only ſixſcore thouſand Crowns: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, this did not hinder the crying down of the Money; and as for thoſe Perſons that had ſtore of it, they were utterly undone. It is an eaſie matter to imagine what ſad Effects theſe new Grievances drew upon the People, who were miſerable enough in all conſcience before, and who were forced to buy every thing at exceſſive Rates.</p>
            <p>The Miniſters of the Inquiſition, with their Trumpets, Kettle-Drums and Banners marching before them, went on the 30<hi>th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> in a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valcade, from the Palace to the <hi>Placa Major,</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:0148502702:43"/>
where they ordered it to be publiſhed, That on the 30<hi>th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> they would publickly puniſh all thoſe whom they had condemned to the fire and other torments. It was forty years ago, ſince a thing of this nature had been ſeen; and and the Sight was expected at <hi>Madrid</hi> with as great an impatience, as if it had been the moſt agreeable Feſtival in the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Thomas de la Cerda,</hi> Brother to the Duke <hi>de Medina-Celi,</hi> parted for <hi>Cales,</hi> with ſo mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent an Equipage, that a Prince of the Blood could not have a finer. Three Men of War waited to carry him over to <hi>New Spain,</hi> of which he was made Vice-Roy.</p>
            <p>They received Advices at Court, That the Count <hi>de Fuenſalida,</hi> Vice-Roy of <hi>Navar,</hi> had ſent ſome Troops to <hi>Fontarabia,</hi> under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Duke <hi>de Canzano.</hi> This Conduct did not ſeem to agree with the Orders they had ſent him from this place, to give Satisfaction to the <hi>French</hi> Fiſhermen of <hi>Andaye,</hi> who had been abuſed and injured.</p>
            <p>On the 16<hi>th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> a Bull-Feaſt was kept, at which the King and the Queen, attended by all the Court, made their Appearance. This ſeemed an extraordinary fine Show to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> becauſe two of the Combatants were killed upon the Spot, and three Cavaliers more were dangerouſly wounded. The Queen was ſo concerned at it, that ſhe found her ſelf ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what diſcompoſed; however, ſhe took care not to diſcover it, for fear of diſquieting the King.</p>
            <p>The Count <hi>de Gubernatis,</hi> Envoy Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nory of <hi>Savoy,</hi> waited for his Orders to depart, but he received a command to attend the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0148502702:44"/>
               <hi>de Dronero,</hi> who went Ambaſſador Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary into <hi>Portugal.</hi> So he tarried at Court without any Character.</p>
            <p>We were here informed, that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Captains, who were at <hi>Naples,</hi> were not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle mortified at the Prohibition that was iſſued out to forbid them to go dreſt after the <hi>French</hi> Faſhion. There is never a <hi>Spaniard</hi> of 'em all that is not raviſhed with Joy, as ſoon as he is out of his own Country, to quit the Habit of it alſo; and to oblige them to wear it again, nothing leſs will ſerve the Turn but reiterated Edicts one upon the back of another.</p>
            <p>The execrable Secret of preparing the moſt ſubtle Poyſon, that is ſo frequently practiſed in <hi>Italy,</hi> has been uſed from time to time in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples.</hi> The Regent <hi>Galeota,</hi> who came back from <hi>Gaeta,</hi> made a ſad Experiment of it, in a Doſe of Phyſick, which diſpatched him in a few hours after: The Vice-Roy of <hi>Naples,</hi> who loved him dearly, expreſt a mighty ſorrow at his Loſs, and promiſed, that if ever he was able to diſcover the Crime, he would make a notorious Example of thoſe that were concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it.</p>
            <p>On the 30<hi>th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> there was kept at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid</hi> an <hi>Auto de Inquiſition</hi>; That is to ſay, a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Execution of the <hi>Jews.</hi> The People ran thither in their beſt Cloaths, and with as great an earneſtneſs as if it had been to the moſt ſolemn ſhow. A great Scaffold was erected in the <hi>Placa Mayor,</hi> where from Seven a Clock in the Morning till Nine at Night, nothing was to be ſeen but Criminals of both Sexes, that had been ſent from all the <hi>Inquiſitions</hi> to <hi>Madrid:</hi> Their Proceſs was read aloud, and Judgment
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0148502702:45"/>
was pronounced againſt them: Twenty <hi>Jews</hi> as well Men was Women, and a <hi>Renegado Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan,</hi> were ſentenced to be burnt: Five more <hi>Jews</hi> of both Sexes, this being the firſt time they were apprehended, and now repenting of their Errors, were condemned to a long Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, and to wear a Yellow Scapulary, with a Red St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s Croſs upon it, which they call a <hi>Sanbenito,</hi> as thoſe that carry this Habit are called <hi>Sanbenitados.</hi> Ten more accuſed of <hi>Bigamy, Witchcraft</hi> and <hi>Sorcery,</hi> were ſentenced to be whipt, and ſent to the Gallies: Theſe wore Paſtboard Bonnets upon their Heads, with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions upon them, having a Rope about their Necks, and Torches in their Hands. All the Court was preſent, the King, the two Queens, the Ladies, the Ambaſſadors, the Grandees, and a great multitude of People. The Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor's Chair was placed after the manner of a Tribunal, and was much above that of the King, and a great deal higher. Theſe Unfortunate People were perſecuted ſo near the King, that he heard all their Complaints and Groans; for the Scaffold where they were ranged touched his Balcony. The Grandees of <hi>Spain</hi> did the ſame thing here as our Provoſt-Marſhal's Men do in <hi>France,</hi> they conducted the Criminals that were to be burnt, and held them tied faſt with thick Cords: The <hi>Famillares</hi>; that is to ſay, the Domeſtick Officers of the <hi>Holy Inquiſition,</hi> at the ſame time led the other Offenders, and ſeveral of the Religious, whether Learned or Ignorant, diſputed vehemently with them, to convince theſe miſerable Creatures of the Truth of our Religion. Some of the <hi>Jews</hi> were very know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their own way of Worſhip, and returned
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0148502702:46"/>
very ſurprizing Anſwers to their Diſputants. Amongſt the reſt, there was a young Woman, of admirable Beauty, who ſeemed not to be above Seventeen Years of Age, and happening to be on the ſame ſide where the Queen was, ſhe addreſſed her ſelf to her, to obtain Favour at her Hands: <hi>Great Queen,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>cannot your Royal Preſence bring ſome Remedy to my Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes? Have pity on my Youth, and conſider that I am perſecuted for a Religion which I have ſucked in with my Mother's Milk.</hi> The Queen turned away her Eyes, and appear'd to pity her caſe, but durſt not make any interceſſion to have her ſaved.</p>
            <p>Maſs was now began, in the midſt of which the Prieſt that officiated, quitted the Altar, and ſate down upon a Seat which was prepared for him; then the Inquiſitor-General deſcended from the Amphitheater, dreſt in his Cope, and having a Mitre on his Head; and after he had bowed towards the Altar, he advanced to the King's Balcony, which he aſcended by ſome Steps that went round the Scaffold, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by ſome Officers of the Inquiſition, who carried the Croſs, and the Evangeliſts, and a Book containing the Oath by which the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> oblige themſelves to protect the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith, to extirpate Hereſies, and to ſupport the Procedures of the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> with their Royal Authority.</p>
            <p>The King ſtood up, with his Head uncovered, and having the Conſtable of <hi>Caſtile</hi> on one ſide of him, who held the Royal Sword lifted up, ſwore to obſerve the Oath, which a Counſellor of the Council Royal read to him, and continued in this poſture till ſuch time as the Inquiſitor was return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Place. Then a Secretary of the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0148502702:47"/>
got up in a Pulpit, and read the ſame Oath, which he cauſed the Councils, and all the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to take. It was about Noon when Maſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, and it was not over till Nine a clock at Night, by reaſon of the long Sentences of the condemned Perſons, that were read aloud one after another. The Conſtancy and Reſolution with which they went to the place of Puniſhment, had ſomething in it which was very extraordinary; ſeveral of them caſt themſelves into the fire, others burnt their Hands, and afterwards their Feet in the Flames, bearing their Torments with a Tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity which made them be lamented, that ſuch reſolute Souls were not illuminated with the Light of Faith. As for myſelf, I did not go to behold this ſad Spectacle; for beſides that it was midnight, and the place of Execution was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Gate of <hi>

                  </gap>,</hi> I was ſo concerned at what I had ſeen in the day-time, that I found my ſelf indiſpoſed. The King could not avoid ſeeing this horrible ſight, both becauſe it was a Religious Affair, and becauſe he is obliged to authorize by his Preſence whatever the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion does. We muſt not believe that theſe rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Examples do in the leaſt promote the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the <hi>Jews</hi>; they are not at all concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at it, and there are a conſiderable number of them in <hi>Madrid,</hi> who are known to be ſuch, and yet are quietly ſuffered to enjoy their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments in the <hi>Finances.</hi> Amongſt theſe <hi>Don Aventura Dionis</hi> was reckoned: His Father gave Seventy thouſand Crowns to be made a Knight of St. <hi>Jago,</hi> and he himſelf a few days after this Execution, obtained of the King a Marqueſs's Title, which ſtood him in Fifty thouſand Crowns.

               <hi>Amſterdam:</hi> All this was known at Court, but there was not the leaſt notice taken of it; and indeed the General Receipts and Farms are full of theſe People. When they are rich, the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> content themſelves with affrighting them, that they may make them empty their Purſes to redeem their Lives. By this means they draw prodigious Sums of Money from them, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they are in a condition to pay a good round Sum, they make a ſhift to eſcape the Fire, which they deſerve as well as the reſt.</p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>de Giovenazzo,</hi> who from being Envoy at the Court of <hi>Savoy,</hi> was nominated to go Ambaſſador to that of <hi>France,</hi> was ordered to return to <hi>Turin.</hi> But the Count <hi>de Gubernatis,</hi> who at that time was under no Character at <hi>Madrid,</hi> and who was making Preparations for his Journey to <hi>Portugal,</hi> went to find out the Chief Miniſter, and repreſented to him, <hi>That the Duke his Maſter was ſo ill ſatisfied, to ſee that his Miniſters were not treated in</hi> Spain <hi>with the ſame Reſpect as they were in</hi> France<hi>, and eſpecially becauſe they did not pay him theſe great Sums that were due to him, that he deſired to ſee an Envoy of</hi> Spain <hi>no more at</hi> Turin. The Duke <hi>de Medina-Celi</hi> anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, <hi>That whatever Treatment was paid his Maſter in</hi> France<hi>, ought not to be uſed as a Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence for the King of</hi> Spain <hi>to do the like, who was ſo far above all other Kings, that he had no Example to follow.</hi> The Count replied, <hi>That he had no mind at preſent to enter into an Examination of their Greatneſs, or the difference that might be between them; but that he had not forgotten, that about Twenty Years ago</hi> Philip IV. <hi>had declared by the Marqueſs</hi> de la Fuente<hi>, That his Ambaſſador ſhould not appear at the Ceremonies where thoſe of</hi> France
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0148502702:49"/>
               <hi>aſſiſted; and that this Declaration was very well known, and accordingly regulated in all the Courts of</hi> Europe. The Duke anſwered him, That he knew nothing of the matter, and that he could hardly believe the buſineſs was as he repreſented it. In the mean time, they made ſeveral Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections at Court upon the Propoſals of the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>; and <hi>Don Antonio de la Cerda,</hi> who had been nominated to go to <hi>Turin,</hi> was recalled home before he arrived there. Nevertheleſs, they diſpenced with themſelves ſo far, as to ſend to compliment the Duke, upon the Alliance he was going to make with the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Portugal.</hi>

            <p>This Princeſs, as it was commonly pretended, was ſuppoſed to be poyſoned; and what made the World judge ſo, was, becauſe one of her Officers having carried ſome of the Diſhes from her Table to his own Houſe, his Wife, and ſome others, after they had eat of them, found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves extreamly ill, that they believed they ſhould die, and had all of them Marks of poyſon about them. This Accident occaſioned a great buſtle at <hi>Lisbon</hi>; the People mutinied, and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Object for their Fury to work upon, they deſign'd to pick a quarrel with the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Envoy, although they had no Reaſon for it, and he was juſt upon the point of ſuffering the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Outrages imaginable. The <hi>Portugueſes</hi> had afterwards a new occaſion to grieve them, cauſed by the Death of <hi>Don Duarte Ribero,</hi> who was ſent Ambaſſador to <hi>Savoy.</hi> He happened to die in the Territories of <hi>Spain,</hi> after ſo violent and ſudden a manner, that all the World was aſtoniſhed at it; and this ſerved to increaſe the Suſpicions they formerly entertained of the evil intentions of ſome perſons, in relation to the <hi>Infanta.</hi>

               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:0148502702:50"/>
A little time appeaſed all theſe Clamours, and the Count <hi>de Gubernatis</hi> departed towards the end of <hi>June</hi> to go for <hi>Portugal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the 22d of the ſame Month, the Marqueſs <hi>de Grana,</hi> Ambaſſador from the Emperor, made his Entry. All his Retinue were barely cloathed in Gray, and his Coaches had no Gilding about them. Moſt People were ſurpriſed at the ſight; and to ſay the truth, this was not the right way to pleaſe in <hi>Madrid</hi>; for there they ſhew them more or leſs Reſpect, according to the Expences they are at in theſe ſorts of occaſions. To this we may add, that the People there love fine Shows above any thing in the World; and it being known, that the Ambaſſador had received twenty five thouſand Crowns to defray the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of his Journey, and that he drew every Year from the Emperour and the King forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crowns more, they were ready to throw Stones at him, when they ſaw him make ſo ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous an Entry. <hi>Don Diego de Bracamonte,</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador of <hi>Malta,</hi> was the Reaſon why he made his Entry no ſooner. He was ſtill of Opinion that they had not done him Juſtice, when the Marqueſs <hi>de Villars</hi> made his Entry, but that as ſoon as ever he renewed his Pretenſions, he ſhould have Satisfaction given him. Being under theſe Expectations, he demanded that his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot might march immediately after that of the laſt Ambaſſador of the Chappel; the Marqueſs <hi>de Grana</hi> would by no means conſent to it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging what had been formerly done by the Ambaſſador of <hi>France,</hi> and ſo that example was followed. This ſmall difference was ſcarce de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, when the Marqueſs <hi>de Grana</hi> had another Conteſt with <hi>Don Geronimo d'Eguya</hi>; he
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0148502702:51"/>
would have had him make the firſt Viſit, as the other Secretaries of State had always done before him. <hi>D'Eguya</hi> excuſed himſelf, by pretending, that all the other Ambaſſadors has come firſt to viſit him, and that he lay under no Obligations to make any particular Diſtinctions for the ſake of Monſieur <hi>de Grana.</hi> Upon, this, the other Ambaſſadors taking notice what ill Advantage he had made of the Civility they ſhew'd him, unanimouſly declared, that they never preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to make that Viſit, as if it had been a Duty incumbent upon them; ſo that <hi>D'Eguya</hi> was not a little mortified at a Declaration ſo contrary to his Vanity and Pretenſions, and found himſelf now under an indiſpenſable neceſſity to go firſt to the Ambaſſador of <hi>Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He tarried till the Court was gone to the <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial,</hi> and took his Opportunity to go to his Houſe on a certain day, when he knew he was not at home: but this did not ſatisfie the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs, who ſaid, he reckoned that Viſit for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which he had not received; <hi>D'Eguya</hi> anſwered, That he had acquitted himſelf of his Duty; and thus they did not ſee one another at all. The Ambaſſador Extraordinary of <hi>Malta</hi> made his Entry, which tho' it made no Magnificent Appearance, was handſomly ordered.</p>
            <p>It was no ſmall ſatisfaction to them at Court to hear, that the Flora for the <hi>Indies,</hi> which they believed would ſcarce be in a condition to go this Year, by reaſon that the great Diſorder of the currant Money had not a little hindred all manner of Commerce, had ſet Sail out of the Port of <hi>Cales,</hi> and made a Happy Voyage with the Brother of the Duke <hi>de Medina-Celi,</hi> who went Vice-Roy to <hi>New Spain:</hi> But to allay their
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0148502702:52"/>
Joy, they were informed, that one of the greater Veſſels had ſtruck againſt a Rock in the middle of the Bay, and received ſo much damage, that ſpringing a Leak on every ſide they had not time enough to bring her off to any place where they might unload and repair her; ſo that ſhe was loſt with ſome of her Paſſengers, and all her Merchandize.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Medina-Celi</hi> not being abſolutely aſſured to continue Chief Miniſter long, thought it the beſt way to make all Advantages of the preſent Opportunity. He had nine Daughters, but had only married two of them, and had a great mind to beſtow the third upon the Son of the Conſtable <hi>Colonna,</hi> who was newly returned to <hi>Madrid</hi> from his Vice-Royſhip of <hi>Arragon,</hi> and had brought his Children along with him. This appeared to be a very Advantageous Match for the Duke's Daughter, and therefore having it ſtill in his Eye, he ſhewed a particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Marqueſs <hi>de los Balbazez,</hi> who was Brother-in-law to the Conſtable. Few Perſons penetrated at firſt into the true Motive of the thing; they thought he did it only to have a fit Occaſion to take his Inſtructions, becauſe he was capable of giving him the beſt: but the more underſtanding People ſoon diſcovered that the great deſire he had to conclude this Alliance, was the principal Reaſon; for at the bottom the Marqueſs <hi>de los Balbazez</hi> had more Reputation at the time when his Embaſſies and great Negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations kept him at a diſtance, than when he was at <hi>Madrid.</hi> Whether it proceeded from the Envy the World bore him, or that his Preſence made them examine his Faults more narrowly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is certain that People had a better Opinion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

him when he was abſent, than when they ſaw him before them. The good Graces of the Duke ſtill contributed to draw more Hatred and Envy upon him, but they did not laſt long enough to made him ſuffer any thing upon that Account.</p>
            <p>One of the greateſt things they uſually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached <hi>Balbazez</hi> with, was his exceſſive, Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, which buſied it ſelf in the moſt inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable matters, altho he was Maſter of a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Fortune, and might have lived after another manner, without incommoding his Eſtate in the leaſt. He was a <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>Spinola</hi>; his Grandfather had formerly commanded the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army, and this was likewiſe a great Captain; but whether it were becauſe he was a Stranger, or for ſome other Reaſon, the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees of <hi>Spain</hi> looked upon him as much inferior to them, although he was a Grandee as well as themſelves, and was of illuſtrious Birth. They deſpiſed him, becauſe he made Advantage of his Money, after the manner of a Banker, which is ſo ſeldom practiſed in <hi>Spain</hi> by Perſons of Quality, that they cannot endure thoſe that do it. His Enemies pretended, that he had committed notorious Overſights at the Treaty of <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> and that they daily beheld new Inconveniences ariſe from his ill Conduct there; That this was the Subject of perpetual quarrels between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> becauſe he had neglected to lay down in plain intelligible terms, what things were yielded up, and their Dependencies, and that every one made uſe of this Obſcurity to interpret it to their own Advantage.</p>
            <p>It is certain that what they alledged againſt the Marqueſs <hi>de Los Balbazez,</hi> had foundation
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0148502702:54"/>
enough, but the Conſtable of <hi>Caſtile</hi> was the Man that took the greateſt pains to expoſe his Miſcarriages to the World. He had no kindneſs for him for <hi>Don Juan</hi>'s ſake, whoſe Favourite he had always been, and for which reaſon the Marqueſs declared againſt the Queen. This was the true Cauſe of the Averſion that was between the Conſtable and him, and it increaſed very much on the ſide of the former, when he ſaw what a Reſpect and Eſteem the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> teſtified for the other. He needed no more than this to revive the Old Grudge he had againſt the Chief Miniſter, and it proceeded ſo far, that he inceſſantly heighten'd the Complaints that came from all parts, under the Dominion of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> againſt the Duke. It muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, that the Conſtable was one of the moſt dexterous prudent Men of his Age, and that his Rank and great Abilities gave him vaſt Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages over the reſt; ſo that whenever he gave his Advice, few People were found ſo hardy as to oppoſe him. The Duke was ſenſible, that he directly thwarted him upon all occaſions: This, together with his other Affairs, made him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly uneaſie, to find himſelf perpetually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in a troubleſome Combat, and to diſpute againſt a Man, who, as we may ſay, took a Pleaſure in chafing himſelf, and who ſearched all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to perplex and diſguſt him. Therefore in this Affair the Duke took the mildeſt courſe; he courted the Conſtable's Friendſhip, and made all Advances towards it: He knew that he was fall'n ill, and that though he was not in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to go to the Council, he was not ſo much indiſpoſed, but that he might have his Advice, in caſe it were demanded.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0148502702:55"/>
He ſent conſtantly to the Conſtable's Houſe to conſult him upon all important occaſions, and this mark of diſtinction flatter'd his Vanity ſo agreeably, that he found himſelf mightily obliged to the Duke. He wanted very little of pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be always ſick for the time to come, as long as the Duke continued to give him ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent a proof of Deference: However, 'tis very certain, that although he was as well as ever, he would not ſtir abroad for a long time, only to prolong a thing which filled him with ſo much Pleaſure and Satisfaction. He received another Obligation from the Duke, which made no leſs an impreſſion upon him; a conſiderable Benefice happening to be vacant, he beſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ed it immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately upon one of his Natural S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3+ letters">
                  <desc>•••…</desc>
               </gap> without the Conſtable's ever demanding it. So many unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Favours perfectly overcame him, and made him deſirous to do ſomething on his ſide; ſo he propoſed to ſubmit to a Reference, in order to accommodate the buſineſs of the Duke <hi>de Cardonne</hi>'s Succeſſion. The Conſtable had eſpouſed his Widow, and the Duke his Daughter: Theſe two Ladies had great Pretenſions, and as great Differences; therefore they thought it the beſt way to determine them by the mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of both Parties: The Duke was ſenſible, that the Conſtable, who naturally loved long tedious Law-Suits, ſhew'd a great deal of Complaiſance in this matter; and indeed the Conſtable was of Opinion, that it would be better to put an end to this Affair, than be ingaged in an everlaſting Conteſt with the Chief Miniſter.</p>
            <p>This Chief Miniſter often aſſiſted the King, and denied Audience to no body; but neither did his Endeavours or Audiences produce any
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0148502702:56"/>
advantageous Effects for the publick Intereſt, and the ſmalleſt Affairs were as difficult for him to determine, as the greateſt. The Marqueſs <hi>de Grana</hi> knew ſo well beforehand what he was to expect upon this ſcore, that he could not be brought to accept the Embaſſy for <hi>Spain,</hi> till he received expreſs Orders from the Emperour, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though for his farther Encouragement he had ſeveral Relations and Friends at <hi>Madrid</hi>; and that beſides his having reſided there formerly, the conſideration of thoſe Favours he might reaſonably expect for his Maſter's ſake, ought to have overcome the unwillingneſs he expreſſed to come to this Court. It is true, what ſerved to increaſe it very much, was the ſecret Advantage which he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> his Enemies, and thoſe that envied him, might have upon him, during his Abſence from <hi>Vienna:</hi> But for all this he found he had reaſon enough to be content with the manner of his uſage, the King allow'd him a double Franchiſe, and paid all the Charges of his Houſe at his Arrival: The Two Queens honoured the Marchioneſs <hi>de Grana,</hi> and her Daughters, with ſeveral Preſents; they favoured him in every thing, yet nevertheleſs he could not forbear to ſay proudly, that he hoped he ſhould not tarry there above a year, and that it ſhould not be his Fault if he did not depart ſooner. He was a fine Gentleman, had abundance of Wit, Penetration and Conduct; but he was of a prodigious bigneſs, and found himſelf mightily incommoded by it: He ſometimes could not help changing his Countenance, when he hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to be in Company with People whom he was not well acquainted with, when they looked ſtedfaſtly upon him. The Court of <hi>Spain</hi> had
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0148502702:57"/>ſuch favourable Inclinations for him, that they readily granted him whatever he deſired; but they could not forbear now and then to promiſe him ſome things which they never performed, and he himſelf was ſenſible that they never would. He was frequently vexed upon theſe Occaſions, ſaying, That it was his Misfortune not to know what he might depend upon: He was concerned at the Miſery to which all ſorts of People were reduced at <hi>Madrid</hi>; and I have heard him fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſay, That whatever Idea's a Man might form to himſelf of the Publick Grievances, yet they infinitely fell ſhort of what they really were, when he came to ſee them; and that for his part, he could not imagine what Remedies they could apply to them. It is indeed true, that Funds were wanting for the moſt neceſſary Exigencies, and that they were forced to borrow five thouſand Piſtols for the Subſiſtence of ſome Troops that they thought convenient to ſend to <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Frontiers of <hi>Biſcay,</hi> by reaſon of the Apprehenſions they had at Court of the Deſigns of our King. I have heard it often ſaid, That the Couriers could not go, for want of Money to defray the Expences of their Journey, although they had Affairs of great Conſequence to diſpatch; and the Marqueſs <hi>de Los Balbazez,</hi> who knew this better than any body, repreſented to the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> that there was a perfect neceſſity to take full Cognizance of the Funds, upon which they might depend for the time to come. The Duke reliſhing this Propoſal, ordered a true Scheme of the King's Revenues to be brought before him: But the Preſident of the <hi>Finances,</hi> and ſome others, after they had deliberated, as their Faſhion was, upon the matter, that is, with a regard only to

their own proper Intereſts, anſwered all with one Conſent, That what he demanded of them was the Work of ſeveral Years. This Anſwer was ſufficient to make him abandon the Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; for the Duke never cared to engage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in any buſineſs that was of long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; nay, he had ſcarce Reſolution enough to go through thoſe things which he was obliged ſuddenly to begin, and as ſoon to finiſh. One of the beſt Examples I can produce to juſtify this, is his leaving the <hi>Camarera Major, Don Gero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimo de Eguya,</hi> and the Confeſſor, quietly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy their Places, without endeavouring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move them; whether it were becauſe he deſpiſed them, or that he imagined them to be too pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful to attempt any thing againſt them; the Weakneſs which he ſhew'd in that Rancounter, ſerved only to increaſe their Courage and Haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs; and they went ſo far at laſt, as not to fear him at all: They poſſeſſed the King with a ſtrong Averſion to him, and inſinuated ſeveral things into him that were quite oppoſite to the Duke's Intentions. He was well enough ſenſible of it, but his natural inſenſibility hindered him from reſenting it: His Gentleneſs rend'red him contemptible both to one and the other, but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to the Dutcheſs <hi>de Terra Nova,</hi> who ſpoke often to the King about him, and explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſelf upon her conſtant Chapter, the Duke, in ſuch bitter Language, that he being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of it, as he certainly was, every body had Reaſon to wonder how he was able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it.</p>
            <p>This ill-natur'd old Beldame had only a ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and not a real Kindneſs for the Young Queen, and it laſted ſo ſhort a time, that her

uſage ſerved only to make the Queen ſenſible, that ſhe knew how to moderate her ſelf well enough, when ſhe ſaw it was neceſſary for her intereſt ſo to do. But as this was indeed a true conſtraint upon her Nature, and ſhe could not counterfeit the leaſt ſweetneſs of Temper, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a great Reluctance; ſo ſhe ſoon reaſſumed her proper Character, and her Perſecutions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more frequent than ever. The Queen, utterly impatient of this Rigorous Deportment, charmed the King one day, by all manner of tender engaging Careſſes, till ſhe found him in a Humour to deny her nothing. After ſome time had paſt, ſhe told him, That if ſhe was dear to him, ſhe conjured him to give her ſome teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of it, that was as well neceſſary for her Health, as the Satisfaction of her Mind. He promiſed to conſent to whatever ſhe deſired. <hi>Why then,</hi> ſaith ſhe, <hi>deliver me from the Tyranny of the Dutcheſs</hi> de Terra Nova. This Demand ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized him, and it was a pretty while before he returned her any Anſwer: but knowing that this had diſquieted her a long time, he told her at laſt, That what ſhe requeſted had never any Preſident, and that no Queen had ever changed her <hi>Camarera Major. Ah, Sir,</hi> replied the Queen, <hi>your Majeſty has ſhew'n me ſeveral Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

I conſent to it,</hi> ſays the King, taking her by the Hand, <hi>I conſent to it; but then, Madam, have a care up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom you coſt your Eyes; for after this faſt choice it will be impoſſible for you to make another.</hi> The Queen teſtified her Joy and Acknowledgment, by Thanks proportionable to the Pleaſure ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:0148502702:62"/>
The firſt Journey ſhe made, was to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the Queen-Mother with the News, not at all queſtioning, but that ſhe would almoſt ſhew as much Joy upon this occaſion as her ſelf.</p>
            <p>But ſhe was not a little ſurprized to find her ſo reſerved and cold, as if the matter were abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely indifferent to her. This mightily perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, and ſo ſhe diſcovered the whole Affair to the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador's Lady, who took pains to put her in heart again, by making her ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that the Queen-Mother was only appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of ſeeing this place filled by ſome other Lady, who might perhaps be full as diſagreeable to her as the Dutcheſs <hi>de Terra Nova</hi> was; and that ſhe was of Opinion, that if ſhe propoſed ſome body to her, whom ſhe liked, ſhe would open her ſelf more clearly to her. The Young Queen replied, That ſhe would do nothing in this buſineſs, without the Advice of the Queen her Mother-in-Law; That ſhe was minded to have ſaid as much to her, when ſhe firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed her about it, but that ſhe ſeemed to be ſo indifferent in the matter, that ſhe had not Confidence enough to explain her ſelf farther. The Queen judged it would be expedient to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> with this Affair, for fear, leſt if ſhe made a Myſtery of it, and he ſhould afterwards happen to diſcover it, he might look upon himſelf to be diſobliged, and reſent it ſo much, as to endeavour to hinder the Accompliſhment of it: But ſhe ſtill lay under ſome Perplexities, becauſe ſhe fancied ſhe did not underſtand the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Language well enough, to be able to hold any long Converſation in it with the Duke, and this was a nice Caſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0148502702:63"/>
ſhe ought to explain her ſelf clearly and intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligibly. She was yet more afraid, that the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marera,</hi> who was always a liſtening in all parts of her Apartment, and who ſometimes ſlipt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Corners, where, without being perceived, ſhe underſtood and ſaw every thing that paſt, would go and diſcover what ſhe ſaid concerning her. Theſe Reaſons prevailed with her to charge one of her Women in whom ſhe repoſed a great confidence, to go to <hi>Don Antonio de la Cerda,</hi> who was a near Relation of the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> and who beſides expreſſed a great Zeal for her Majeſty, and deſire him to acquaint the Chief Miniſter with what had happened, and to tell him, That ſince the the Queen was reſolved to remove her <hi>Camerera,</hi> ſhe deſired him to chuſe for her one of his Friends, of whoſe Fidelity he was aſſured; and that it was neceſſary for him to aſſiſt her in this Affair, to the end, that act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Conſort one with another, the buſineſs might ſucceed to their common Satisfaction. The Duke received the Honour the Queen did him, with a great deal of Reſpect and Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement, and ſent his Dutcheſs that very Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to return her his moſt humble Thanks. When ſhe came to the Queen's Apartment, ſhe tarried till the other Ladies were gone out of the Room, that ſhe might have a better opportunity of making her Compliment.</p>
            <p>The Queen, who knew very well, that the Dutcheſs was ſenſible enough of the favourable Condeſcentions ſhe had made on her ſide, was deſirous to beſtow the Place upon her; but the Affair did not ſucceed as ſhe imagined, becauſe that Lady had too much buſineſs upon her Hands to accept the Offer. <hi>I have deſigned it for you,</hi>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:0148502702:64"/>
ſays the Queen, <hi>and I am of Opinion, that you will not be unwilling to ſerve me.</hi> The Dutcheſs thanked her, as in Duty obliged, and told her, She could wiſh with all her heart that ſhe was in a condition to accept this Honour, and that no body in the World ſhould ſerve her Majeſty more faithfully than ſhe would; but her Health was ſo ill, that it would not permit her to render her thoſe Services in which that Place, as well as her own inclinations, would engage her. But the Queen continuing to preſs her ſtill, ſhe told her, That although this Conſideration was laid aſide, yet ſhe had another of equal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, which ſhe could never diſpence with, That ſhe had Seven Daughters, upon whoſe Education and good Conduct all her Cares were beſtow'd; and therefore ſhe requeſted her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to think of her no more: However, ſhe durſt aſſure her, ſhe believed the Marchioneſs <hi>de Los Velez,</hi> to be the moſt proper Perſon to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute this Place; That ſhe was a Lady of great Merit, and illuſtrious Birth; that ſhe had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been <hi>Governante</hi> to the Young King, and conſequently being ſo well known to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, could more dexterouſly humour and pleaſe him than any one beſides. The Queen very well approved of this Advice, and the Dutcheſs after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards withdrew. She gave her Husband an Account of what Converſation had paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her and the Queen; but he was diſpleaſed to hear that ſhe had recommended the Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>de Los Velez,</hi> becauſe he had already engaged himſelf in behalf of the Dutcheſs <hi>de Albuquerque,</hi> and earneſtly deſir'd to ſee her advanc'd to this Poſt.</p>
            <p>The Confidence which the King repoſed in <hi>de Eguya,</hi> would not permit him to conceal from
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0148502702:65"/>
him the promiſe he made the Queen to remove the <hi>Camerera.</hi> He for his part omitted nothing that might turn off the intended blow; but he found the King was ſo fully reſolved to ſatisfie the Queen, that he perceived it would be to no purpoſe to uſe any importunities with him upon this Score: So all he could do in the matter, was only to acquaint the <hi>Camarera</hi> with what was deſigned againſt her, that ſo ſhe might be the better provided to bear the ſhock when it happened. She had ſome Suſpicions of this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it being her principal Talent to penetrate into the moſt ſecret Affairs. This blow ſenſibly afflicted her, and ſhe could not forbear to ſpeak to the Queen about it. <hi>Madam,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>I ſhould reckon my ſelf extreamly unfortunate, if my Zeal for your Majeſty ſhould ever happen to diſpleaſe you: I have ſpoken to you with more Zeal, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps with more Freedom than any one has done; nevertheleſs, my deſign was only to inſpire you with a deſire of learning all our Faſhions, that ſo you might abſolutely poſſeſs the Heart and good Inclinations of the King: The Liberty I took has appeared too aſſuming; I have drawn your diſpleaſure upon my ſelf, by endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to deſerve your Affection; and I am informed at laſt, that your Majeſty deſires to ſee my Place filled by another.</hi> The Queen, ſurprized to ſee that the Affair ſhe had communicated to ſo few Perſons, had taken Air, anſwered coldly, <hi>It is not worth the while, Madam, to trouble your ſelf about what People ſay; few Perſons know my Thoughts; and 'tis a thing uſually practiſed in Courts, to invent News, and then to relate it as if it were true.</hi> The <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marera</hi> was not able to draw any Diſcoveries from this Converſation; but whether her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience reproached her for the Conduct ſhe had
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0148502702:66"/>
uſed, or elſe ſhe had been informed of the Queen's Deſigns before <hi>de Eguya</hi> ſpoke to her about them; it was ſome time ago ſince ſhe ſuſpected that ſhe was to be removed, and upon that Conſideration, having examined all the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the Court, who gave her the greateſt Jealouſy, ſhe found Three, <hi>viz.</hi> the Marchioneſs <hi>de Los Velez,</hi> the Dutcheſs <hi>de Albuquerque,</hi> and the Dutcheſs <hi>de l'Infantado.</hi> This is the Cauſe that ſhe took her meaſures a long time before, and ſpoke of theſe Three Ladies in very diſobliging Terms before the Queen, whenever an occaſion preſented it ſelf. She accuſed the Marchioneſs <hi>de los Velez</hi> for her Haughtineſs in all her Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and for her inſupportable Severity. She pretended, that the Dutcheſs <hi>de Albuquerque</hi> hated all the <hi>French</hi> ſo mortally, that when ſhe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to meet any of that Nation, ſhe turned her Eyes aſide, that ſhe might not behold them; and that ſhe valued her ſelf ſo mightily upon the ſcore of her high Birth and Vertue, that ſhe had always ſomething or other to ſay againſt all the World: And then as for the Dutcheſs <hi>de l'Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tado,</hi> ſhe repreſented her as an old doting Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who at the beſt had never any great ſhare of Wit, and had now totally loſt it, by reaſon of her great Age. She was not content to ſpeak of them after this manner, but engaged all the <hi>French</hi> Women, who were near the Queen, to inſinuate the ſame Opinion into her, and they acquitted themſelves in the matter as well as they could, out of hopes, that if the Dutcheſs conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in her Poſt ſtill, ſhe would take care to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider them for their good Services.</p>
            <p>What they ſaid to the Queen upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, made but a ſmall impreſſion upon her
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0148502702:67"/>
Mind; and the firſt time ſhe could find an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to diſcourſe the Queen-Mother about it, ſhe acquainted her with her Deſigns in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Marchioneſs <hi>de los Velez</hi>; but ſhe expreſſed as great an indifference at this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as ſhe did at firſt. This gave the Queen no ſmall Affliction; ſo ſhe imagined that ſhe ought to inform her of every thing that was laid to the Dutcheſs <hi>de Terra Nova</hi>'s Charge, as well upon the Affair of <hi>Don Carlos</hi> of <hi>Arragon,</hi> whom ſhe cauſed to be Aſſaſſinated, as ſeveral other things that rendered her odious. After this, ſhe added the Particulars of the Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhe had uſed towards her. But the Queen-Mother pretended, as if all this were News to her, and ſtill continued to ſpeak very kindly of the <hi>Camarera</hi>; not that ſhe had the leaſt kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for her in reality; for ſhe had not forgotten how deeply ſhe had been engaged in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of <hi>Don Juan</hi>; and ſhe had not as yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given the Memory of that Prince for the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles he brought upon her.</p>
            <p>The Reaſon of her uſing this Conduct with the Queen, was only to exclude the Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>de Los Velez,</hi> and the Dutcheſs <hi>de l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tado,</hi> whom ſhe did not greatly care for. She thought with her ſelf, that if ſhe deſired to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige the Queen to take a <hi>Camarera</hi> from her Hands, it would be neceſſary for her to teſtify no Averſion for her that was to fill that Place; and that the Queen being deſirous to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by her, would demand of her whom ſhe pitched upon, and ſo take a Perſon of her own chuſing. The Young Queen was aware of her Mother-in Law's Deſigns: However, ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to know nothing of them, ſuppoſing
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0148502702:68"/>
that ſuch a one would be always obliged to do as the Queen-Mother directed her: Having therefore a particular inclination for the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs <hi>de Los Velez,</hi> ſhe was reſolved to ſound the King's Sentiments upon that Affair, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed her to him; but he expreſs'd an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Antipathy to her: <hi>If,</hi> ſays he, <hi>you knew the Marchioneſs</hi> de Los Velez <hi>as well as I do, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident you would never think of placing her ſo near you; She has been my Governante, and is the only Perſon in the World whom I dread moſt.</hi> The Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> deſired no more to ſee her in that Station than the King did, and ſhew'd as great a diſlike to the Dutcheſs <hi>de l'Infantado</hi>; all their Votes concurr'd in behalf of the Dutcheſs <hi>de Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buquerque,</hi> and it was agreed upon at laſt, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade the Queen that ſhe ought to chuſe her.</p>
            <p>This Choice had infallibly ſucceeded, if the Queen could have cured her ſelf of thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable impreſſions which the <hi>Camarera</hi> had made upon her in relation to that Dutcheſs; She often thought of the imperious Humour that was attributed to her, of the pretended Averſion ſhe had to the <hi>French</hi>; but eſpecially of what the King had told her, That when once the Dutcheſs <hi>de Terra Nova</hi> was removed, and another put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her Place, ſhe muſt never think of turning her off. She was perſuaded, that ſhe ſhould be no Gainer by the change, if ſhe pitched upon the Dutcheſs <hi>de Albuquerque:</hi> Nay, that it migh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:0148502702:69"/>
ſearching after one, ſhe was told of the Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>de Eytona,</hi> who was a Woman of Solid Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, great Merit, and had abundance of Wit and Gallantry. In fine, ſhe was every way ſo well Accompliſh'd, that it was neceſſary for her Majeſty to have her near her; and by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations ſhe had at the Queen-Mother's Court, and with the Chief Miniſter, ſhe could not chuſe but pleaſe both Parties alike. The King ſhew'd no oppoſition to her, and the Queen, who knew her, loved her already; ſo that ſhe was mighty joyful to meet with one whom ſhe liked ſo well. But this Joy did not continue long; for the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs <hi>de Eytona</hi> fell ſick, and died a few days after. The Young Queen was ſenſibly Afflicted at this Loſs, and not knowing where to make a better choice, ſhe came back again to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs <hi>de Los Velez,</hi> becauſe ſhe comprehended no difference between the Dutcheſs <hi>de Terra Nova</hi> and the Dutcheſs <hi>de Albuquerque</hi>; And as for the Dutcheſs <hi>de l'Infantado,</hi> ſhe perceived well enough that ſhe was not fit for her.</p>
            <p>But now to propoſe the Marchioneſs <hi>de Los Velez,</hi> was to attempt a thing that could never ſucceed, for the Reaſons I have already mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. The Marchioneſs, who perceived them better than any body, could not endure to be ſo long expoſed to an Excluſion that was ſo very diſobliging to her; So ſhe went to find out the Queen, and returned her Thanks for her great Favours; but ſhe told her, That her Age, and the Trouble ſhe had had with the King, when ſhe was Governante to him, gave her ſo great a diſreliſh for the Court, that ſhe could by means reconcile her ſelf to it, and therefore deſired her to think of her no more. All theſe Difficulties
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0148502702:70"/>
ſeemed to ariſe for the Satisfaction of the Dutcheſs <hi>de Terra Nova,</hi> or at leaſt, they proved the occaſion why ſhe continued ſtill in her Place; and that the Queen, utterly wearied to find ſo many diſappointments in her way, was come to ſuch a paſs, that ſhe was no longer deſirous to remove her. The Queen Mother all the while intrigued more than ſhe, becauſe ſhe earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to have that Lady turned out of the Palace.</p>
            <p>What ſtill contributed to make the Young Queen leſs concerned for the matter, was, that her Mind was taken up with new Troubles, that were more preſſing upon her than thoſe ſhe received from the <hi>Camarera</hi>; I mean, the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions they had at Court of a Rupture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Crowns. The Queen remained in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolable, when ſhe conſidered, that the Peace of <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> of which ſhe was, as it were, the Seal, was going to be broken. The Love ſhe had for <hi>France,</hi> and the Obligations that faſtened her to <hi>Spain,</hi> ballanced all her Inclinations; and ſhe often ſhed Tears, out of a fear only of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the War renewed.</p>
            <p>The moſt Chriſtian King pretended, That the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had pillaged and abuſed his Subjects in ſeveral places, and either burnt or taken many <hi>French</hi> Veſſels; That they returned him no Anſwer at <hi>Madrid,</hi> to the Complaints he had made; That the Marqueſs <hi>de Borgomaine,</hi> who reſided at <hi>London,</hi> in quality of Ambaſſador Extraordinary from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> obſerved no manner of meaſures; nay, not even thoſe that Decency preſcribes; That he had made a League in the Name of the King his Maſter, with the King of <hi>England</hi> againſt <hi>France</hi>; That he was well informed, that as he was upon his
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0148502702:71"/>
departure to go Ambaſſador to <hi>Vienna,</hi> he had received private Orders to ſtay ſome time in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to try if he could perſwade the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to do the moſt prejudicial things they could do to <hi>France.</hi> The King, provoked at ſo clandeſtine a Conduct, and ſo extraordinary in the midſt of a Peace, which he had not infringed the leaſt on his part, was reſolved to act according to his uſual Juſtice and Equity; and finding himſelf poſſeſs'd with theſe Reſentments, he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to incline him to believe, that he was obliged to part with any of his Rights.</p>
            <p>He ordered his Gallies to put to Sea, with an expreſs Command to make thoſe of <hi>Spain</hi> give them the firſt Gun whenever they met them. He knew that this Affair had been regulated at the ſame time when <hi>Philip</hi> IV had agreed that his Ambaſſadors ſhould never appear in Publick with thoſe of <hi>France</hi>; and he made the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> be acquainted, that the Conduct he uſed during the Peace, was ſo oppoſite to Peace it ſelf, that he ſaw himſelf obliged to ſeek out all Advantages on his ſide, as he found it expedient.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Spain,</hi> for his part, complained of the exact Severity that was ſhown him in the ſmalleſt matters, alledging, that when the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of the moſt Chriſtian King were to have adjuſted with thoſe that came from <hi>Spain,</hi> the Limits of what had been yielded up by the Treaty of <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> had refuſed to Treat with the Deputies of <hi>Spain,</hi> as long as the Catholick King ſhould take upon him the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Duke of <hi>Burgundy:</hi> They added a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration to this Refuſal. That if within a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time aſſigned, they did not Treat by Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of another Commiſſion, where this Title was
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0148502702:72"/>
not inſerted, they would immediately put the King of <hi>France</hi> in Poſſeſſion of the Territories and Rights which belonged to him. So that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was content to cut off the Titles he uſually aſſumes with an <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This League, about which the Marqueſs <hi>de Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomaine</hi> made ſuch a buſtle and ſtir in <hi>England,</hi> was at laſt concluded with <hi>Spain.</hi> It was a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Engagement on both ſides, whereby they obliged themſelves to defend one another, in what place ſoever they ſhould happen to be attack'd. For this end <hi>England</hi> was to furniſh Eight Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot, and Thirty Men of War; and <hi>Spain</hi> was obliged to ſend an Hundred Thouſand Crowns every Month into <hi>Flanders,</hi> to keep the Gariſons there in a good condition, and have Twelve Thouſand Men in Pay in <hi>Champagne.</hi> They were in good hopes, that the Emperor and the <hi>Hollander</hi> would likewiſe enter into the League. <hi>Don Pedro Ronquillo,</hi> Ambaſſador Extraordinary of <hi>Spain,</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> ſent a Courier, with a Ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Treaty, which was received at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid</hi> on the 25<hi>th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> 1680.</p>
            <p>Moſt People were very well ſatisfied, when they ſaw the ſeveral Motions on both ſides, that the War would infallibly be kindled ſomewhere or other in <hi>Flanders.</hi> The Duke <hi>de Villa Hermoſa</hi> had demanded to be recalled home, and that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Governor might be ſent to ſupply his Place. The unconcern'd Temper, as well as the Natural Slowneſs of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> held the matter a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time in ſuſpence, without giving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the trouble to determine it. The Marqueſs <hi>de Los Balbazes</hi> was firſt pitch'd upon to be ſent thither: but as ſoon as he received Advice of it, he endeavour'd all he could to get himſelf excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0148502702:73"/>
out of an Apprehenſion that they would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage him at the ſame time to contract vaſt Debts, to which his Thrifty Humour gave him an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Averſion. Beſides this, they found it a difficult matter to meet with any Subject who was to their Mind: The Report ran, That the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> would go to command there in Chief; Afterwards it was ſaid, the Duke of <hi>Newburg</hi> would be the Man, for whom the Marqueſs <hi>de Grana</hi> did ſeveral good Offices. After they had deliberated a long time about the Merits of theſe two Competitors, at laſt they caſt their Eyes upon Prince <hi>Alexander Farneſe</hi>; he obtained the Preference, and was named about the beginning of <hi>July.</hi> He was Brother to the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> and was about Threeſcore Year old; the Gout very much troubled him, and the Talneſs of his Stature was very Extraordinary: He had been a long time devoted to <hi>Spain,</hi> and particularly to the Queen-Mother, at the juncture when ſhe had thoſe great Differences with <hi>Don Juan:</hi> He had been General of the Cavalry in <hi>Eſtramadura</hi> and <hi>Catalonia,</hi> and paſſed for a very great Soldier, although 'tis certain he had but very little Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and the Management of his private Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs ſufficiently demonſtrated it; for he ow'd every body Money, paid ſeldom, and had not a Farthing by him: his Profuſeneſs and his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes ruined him, and although, after all, he had really a great Eſtate, yet it was miſerably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbred. It was the General Opinion here, that if the War commenced, <hi>Flanders</hi> would be the firſt Victim; and this made them believe, that it would be leſs ignominious for <hi>Spain</hi> to ſuffer this Loſs, when an <hi>Italian</hi> was Governor of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> than if a <hi>Spaniard</hi> were there. In ſhort,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0148502702:74"/>
it could be nothing elſe but this Conſideration only, that could poſſibly induce them to believe they did well to fill this Poſt with a Man, who never had managed as yet any Affair of that vaſt importance as theſe were. They bargained with <hi>Don Franciſco de Caſtile,</hi> for the Sum of Three Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Thouſand Crowns, which was to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> for the payment of the Troops: And after Prince <hi>Alexander</hi> had received the Thirty Thouſand Crowns which the King or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be given him, to bear the Expence of his Voyage, he parted on the 17<hi>th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> to go and take Shipping at the <hi>Groyne</hi> in <hi>Galicia.</hi> He took along with him abundance of Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, and a numerous Train of Domeſticks: He ſent a Courier into <hi>France,</hi> to get neceſſary Paſports, and left the Court in ſuch haſte, that he forgot to carry with him the Patent for his Government. It was not very long before he heartily repented for ſo doing, and he preſt earneſtly to have it: However, they promiſed him one, but deferr'd to expedite it; ſo that he could only be ſaid to be Governor for the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim</hi>; and it was believed, with Reaſon enough that he would not be well pleaſed with this Uſage. He had intruſted ſome Perſons at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid</hi> to ſollicite this Affair for him; but they refuſed the Expeditions, when the Court would oblige them to take them in ſuch a Form; and after many Petitions on their ſide, and ſeveral Conteſts with the Miniſters about it, it was not at laſt inſerted into the Patent after what manner he was made Governor.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Prince departed from <hi>Madrid:</hi> with ſo little Money, according to his uſual Cuſtom, that he was ſcarce arrived at the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0148502702:75"/>
               <hi>Groyne,</hi> but he diſpatch'd a Courier away to the Court with ſome Letters, wherein he demanded Money to perform his Voyage. They anſwered him very coldly, That they would adviſe him not to defer the day of his departure, and that they could by no means believe, that he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſpent his Thirty Thouſand Crowns. He embarked immediately, accompanied by ſome Veſſels belonging to <hi>Biſcay,</hi> which tranſported five hundred new raiſed Men, that had been levied in <hi>Galicia,</hi> and were commanded to guard the <hi>Frontiers.</hi> The People in <hi>Flanders</hi> had not for many Years ſeen any other Governour but <hi>Don Juan</hi>; he poſſeſſed the Government as his own till his Death; and although he was at ſo great a diſtance, yet Couriers were ſtill diſpatched to him, to receive his Orders, even in the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Conjunctures. To ſay the truth, the Conſtable of <hi>Caſtile</hi> had been ſent thither, as I have already obſerved in the beginning of theſe Memoirs, in the Place of that Prince; and he obtained a General Patent, without ſpecifying in it, that it was only by a Commiſſion; but the Queen-Mother would have it ſo, on purpoſe to diſguſt <hi>Don Juan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The preſſing Neceſſity there was for Money in <hi>Flanders,</hi> obliged the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> to ſearch with all imaginable Application ſome means or other to furniſh them with ſome; and he tried ſeveral without meeting any Succeſs. <hi>Don Franciſco de Caſtile</hi> immediately promis'd to remit Thirty Thouſand Crowns thither, and afterwards engaged to make a return of Eighteen Hundred Thouſand <hi>Florins</hi> more; upon which conſideration they were to give him Two Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Thouſand Crowns in Hand, and to pay
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0148502702:76"/>
him the reſt at different times upon Aſſignations, which in all probability would never have been paid to him. He queſtioning it very much, was not willing to be their Fool, and reſolved to ſend no Money to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> but accordingly as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it at <hi>Madrid.</hi> They failed to perform the Promiſe they had made him, to pay him Two Hundred Thouſand Crowns down upon the Nail; and he, for his part, failed them in the reſt.</p>
            <p>Now how was it poſſible to draw ſuch a Sum as this out of the King's Treaſury, when it was totally exhauſted? The inferior Officers of his Houſe having tarried for their Wages longer than they could well do, except they reduced them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to down-right Beggary, would have thrown up their Liveries, being reſolved to quit the Service, unleſs they had been partly detained by Menaces, and partly by fair promiſes to ſee them paid, if they continued in it ſtill. As for People of Quality, they could not tell what to do: After they had pawn'd their Jewels, their Plate, nay, even their Canopies of State, and their wearing Apparel, they found they had now no more Money or Credit left. The Bankers were not in a better condition, and the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants had neither Merchandize nor Money. The inconvenience of proclaiming Money, to go at a lower Price, was ſenſibly perceived every day more and more, and the Publick Miſery ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed. A Man cannot ſufficiently wonder that things of ſo great a conſequence were managed with ſo little conſideration: Nay, matters were come to that paſs, that in ſeveral Provinces they were forced to exchange Cattle for Corn, and Cloath for Linnen, becauſe there was not Money enough to circulate in the way of Trade. Heaven
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0148502702:77"/>
pitied the great Afflictions of thoſe People, and favoured them with a Plentiful Year; but the Price of Bread was not in the leaſt dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, either through the Negligence or Villany of the Magiſtrates, who were ſo far from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging the Corn to be brought into the great Cities, that they under-hand hindred it from being carried to thoſe Places. The Queen-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Houſhold began to find in their turn, the Effects of theſe Diſorders; ſhe had been hitherto very well paid, and her Domeſticks received their <hi>Racions,</hi> that is to ſay, their Allowances, either in Money or Proviſions; and now when they preſt the Treaſurers to take care they might have them, they were told, that they might go and viſit the Cheſts of the Treaſury, if they pleaſed, which at preſent were all open, becauſe they had no Money within.</p>
            <p>So many particular as well as private Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, were yet increaſed by the Ravage and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation the Plague made in <hi>Andaluſia.</hi> It is not long ago ſince it was altogether uninhabited along the Sea-Coaſts from <hi>Malaga</hi> to <hi>Alicant.</hi> The Kingdom of <hi>Granada</hi> was not free from this Peſtilence, which ſpread it ſelf about <hi>Sevil</hi> and <hi>Corduba,</hi> and in <hi>Eſtramadura.</hi> It was immediately perceived at Port St. <hi>Mary,</hi> but they would not take any publick notice of it, till after the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>Flota</hi> for the <hi>Indies,</hi> for fear of ſpoiling Commerce. If it had not been for this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, it had been viſibly perceived much ſooner. The difficulties ſtill increaſed as to the buſineſs of Trade, and People were apprehenſive that their Letters, Commodities, and Goods, carried the infection with them. It is natural enough for Men to uſe all neceſſary Precaution againſt ſo dangerous a Diſtemper as this was.</p>

I have already obſerved that the Duke <hi>de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina-Celi</hi> would have fain engaged the King to part with his Confeſſor, but that finding ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny difficulties appear in the way, he deſiſted from his deſign: But Father <hi>Francis de Relux</hi> had not, for his part, forgotten the ill Offices that the Duke endeavoured to do him. He diſſembled his Reſentments, becauſe he was not as yet ſo well ſettled in the King's good inclinations, as to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to cope with the Chief Miniſter. But as ſoon as he found himſelf upon ſure grounds, he ſpoke to <hi>de Eguya,</hi> and the Dutcheſs <hi>de Terra Nova,</hi> to intereſt them in his quarrel, out of a deſire he had to make the Duke ſenſible of the Effects of his Power. The old Dutcheſs was not ignorant that the Duke hated her, and that he paſſionately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to ſee another in her Place: This inſpired her with a mortal Averſion to him; and ſo theſe Three Perſons being always united, raiſed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Faction againſt him: But that of the Confeſſor was carried on more ſecretly, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently was more dangerous. It often happens, that a Man purſues his Revenge freely, when he may ſafely do it under the Pretence of Devotion; And this was the Caſe of Father <hi>de Relux</hi>; for he inceſſantly attacked the King in his moſt tender part, his Conſcience. <q rend="inline">He repreſented to him the Miſery of his People, the Extremity of the State, the Diſorder and Miſcarriages, which were ſo far from being remedied, that they were openly encouraged; that no Grievances were redreſs'd, that every thing came to ruin; that if his Majeſty was ſenſible that he had not Power and Experience enough to regulate Affairs of himſelf, and to take the Reins of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into his own hands, he ought at leaſt, to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0148502702:79"/>
intruſt them with a Miniſter, who would give him an honeſt and faithful Account of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment: That the debate was not now about a trivial matter, but that his Everlaſting Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lay at ſtake; that God, who makes and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves Kings in their Sovereign Authority, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects that Kings ſhould perform their Duties; that they are obliged to cheriſh their Subjects as their Children, and to make them happy as far as it lies in their Power; that the Duke <hi>de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina Celi</hi> only regarded his own private Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, and minded nothing but his Family, which was very numerous, and the advancing of his Relations, whilſt the reſt of <hi>Spain</hi> groaned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the heavy weight of Subſidies, Impoſts, and a thouſand other Vexations, which were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely raiſed to exhauſt them; that he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged in Conſcience to inform him, that unleſs he vigorouſly endeavour'd to apply proper Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies to theſe Evils, it was his Duty to deny him Abſolution.</q> The King, who continued for ſome time aſtoniſhed at theſe Menaces, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him, whether he did not ſpeak all theſe afflicting things only to try him? The other anſwer'd, That he was ſo far from entertaining any ſuch thoughts, that were ſo little conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Reſpect he owed him, that he would willingly have ſacrificed his own Life, to have been exempted from the cruel neceſſity of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him after ſo frank a manner. The King was very Penſive, and ſpent ſeveral days in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting himſelf, without knowing what to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve upon: He lov'd the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> exceedingly, and at laſt ſent for him to come to him. So having ſhut him up with himſelf in his Cloſet, he fairly acquanted him with the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0148502702:80"/>
occaſion of his Uneaſieneſs, and with his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions in relation to his Salvation: He recounted to him every thing that paſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Confeſſor and him, and how he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to Abſolve him, becauſe of the general diſorder of Affairs; and at laſt told the Duke, He had now ſent for him to comfort him with good Reaſons. The Chief Miniſter liſtned very reſpectfully to him all the while, and would not ſuffer himſelf to be tranſported with any Paſſion againſt the Confeſſor's Severity, for fear the King ſhould ſuſpect the true Motives of that Heat. On the contrary he agreed, <q rend="inline">That he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a Man of Sincerity, and that his Advices ſeemed to proceed from a good intent: But then he added, That he was a Monk, and had no manner of Experience in the World: That <hi>Don Juan</hi> had drawn him out of a Convent, where he lay buried; That he never had any Converſation but with Monks, like himſelf; that he was dazled with the Poſt to which, by the Favour of <hi>Don Juan</hi> he had been elevated all on the ſudden; that his Head was giddy, and that he knew not how to make any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between things and times, although this was an Article abſolutely neceſſary in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Souls; that he placed the King's Soul in a parallel with that of a private Man; that he agreed indeed, that in the ſight of God one were as valuable as the other, and that all the difference that was to be found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, proceeded only from the diverſity of their Works; but then every Man had a particular way to ſave himſelf; that a Prince ought to live like a Prince, and a private Man like a private Man, and ſo after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner, <pb n="79" facs="tcp:0148502702:81"/>
a Secular like a Secular, and a Religious like a Religious; that Father <hi>Relux,</hi> whoſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity was very narrow, confounded all Eſtates, and even loſt himſelf in this Chaos; that his Majeſty ought not to be diſturbed at what he had told him, and eſpecially leaſt of all in the preſent Affairs, becauſe he aſſured him, for his part, that he would not loſe a moment to ſet them in the beſt Order imaginable; that in truth, it was neceſſary to allow ſome time for the performance of this; that let a Man's Zeal be never ſo earneſt for the Publick Good, yet he cannot effect it immediately, ſince it is full as difficult a matter to remedy Grievances, as 'tis eaſie to deſire the removal of them; but that ſince the Confeſſor had troubled himſelf with ſeveral things, which did not at all belong to him, if the King would be pleaſed to take his Advice, he would provide him with one who was more capable of the Poſt than F. <hi>Relux,</hi> and would never torment him with imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Scruples.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke found it an eaſie matter to perſwade his Majeſty to embrace a thing that would ſet his Conſcience at reſt; and the King had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented that very moment to the removal of the Confeſſor, if he had not judged it neceſſary to take the Advice of <hi>Don Geronimo de Eguya,</hi> and ſo he told the Duke, that he would make a few Reflections as was requiſite, upon the matter. <hi>De Eguya</hi> coming to wait upon the King, he communicated his Deſigns to him. After the ſtrict Union that was between this Favourite, the Dutcheſs <hi>de Terra Nova,</hi> and Father <hi>Relux,</hi> there was little probability that he would conſent to his Removal, but as he preferr'd his own Intereſts
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0148502702:82"/>
to thoſe of other Perſons, and only ſerved others out of a Reſpect to his own Advantage: So he found, that the Confeſſor was ſo devoted to the <hi>Camarera Mayor,</hi> and that ſhe ſo reſolutely ſwore the Downfall of the Duke, that if this Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation continued much longer, the Duke would infalllibly fall under the weight of it: That his Succeſſor might perhaps have leſs favourable Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions towards him, and that he had better ſacrifice the Confeſſor to the Miniſter, than the Miniſter to the Confeſſor. Theſe Reaſons ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd ſo well-grounded, that inſtead of inſpiring other Sentiments into the King, he fortified thoſe he had already, and this was enough to ruin the Father Confeſſor to all intents and purpoſes. They offer'd him, as they did before, the Biſhoprick of <hi>Avila,</hi> in order to obſerve ſome ſort of Decency in removing him; but he would not accept of it, and was content to continue a Counſellor in the Supreme Council of the Inquiſition, where they are always obliged to have a <hi>Dominican.</hi> The Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> perſwaded the King to take in his Place Father <hi>Bayona,</hi> a <hi>Dominican,</hi> Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor of the Univerſity of <hi>Alcala:</hi> He had expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a great deſire long before to ſee him placed in this Station, and had ſpoke of him ever ſince the Miniſtry of <hi>Don Juan.</hi> That Prince, who had no kindneſs for him, would never admit him, ſaying, that he was a <hi>French-man.</hi> He was indeed a Native of <hi>Navar,</hi> but that was the <hi>Spaniſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>var:</hi> He entred into this Function towards the end of <hi>July.</hi> 'Tis very obſervable, that in the ſpace of Five Years the King had Seven Confeſſors.</p>
            <p>This Alteration gave a fatal Blow to the Dutcheſs <hi>de Terra Nova,</hi> and the Chief Miniſter flatter'd himſelf, that ſhe would now leave the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0148502702:83"/>
Palace in a ſhort time. Since People ſpoke no more of ſending her away, and ſhe was well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of every thing that paſt, ſhe was of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that they could not find any Lady who was fit to ſucceed her in her Place, and that ſhe ſhould ſtill continue in it: But the Queen finding all her Stock of Patience ſpent and gone, by reaſon of all thoſe occaſions of Complaint ſhe ſtill perſiſted to give her, conſented at laſt to receive the Dutcheſs <hi>de Albuquerque</hi> near her Perſon. But this was not till after ſhe had endeavoured to obtain the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs <hi>de Los Velez,</hi> and even the Dutcheſs <hi>de l'Infantado.</hi> She ſaw very well, that the Queen-Mother, and the Chief Miniſter would never give their conſent to it, and that it was indiſpenſably neceſſary for her to take a <hi>Camarera Major</hi> from their hands, or elſe to reſt contented with whom ſhe now had. Every one gave the Dutcheſs <hi>de Albuquerque</hi> a good Character, to efface thoſe ill impreſſions ſhe had received againſt her. They took care to ſatisfy her, <q rend="inline">That ſhe was ingenious, and well-read in the World; that ſhe was not ignorant of any of the Cuſtoms and Ceremonies of the Court; that ſhe would do her all good Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices imaginable, both with the Queen-Mother, and the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi>; that ſhe had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter make this Choice freely and voluntarily, than expreſs any repugnance to a thing which would unavoidably happen.</q> Theſe Reaſons had their Effect; the Queen accepted her, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd her very kindly when ſhe ſaw her. She had concerted the matter with the Queen her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-Law, and the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi:</hi> But this was not ſufficient; the King's Conſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſtill to be gained; and he was no leſs averſe to the Dutcheſs <hi>de Albuquerque,</hi> than to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0148502702:84"/>
               <hi>de Los Velez.</hi> The Prejudices he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived againſt this Dutcheſs were of the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with thoſe that had been inſinuated into the Queen. The Dutcheſs <hi>de Terra Nova,</hi> and the Secretary <hi>de Eguya,</hi> were the Perſons who had thus maliciouſly prepoſſeſſed him againſt her; and nothing leſs than all the Authority of the Queen-Mother could make him reſolve to admit her into the Palace. She ſpoke to him of it at firſt very ſoftly and gently, but afterwards in a ſtronger and higher Tone. She told him, <q rend="inline">That it was high time for him now to know People of himſelf, and not to judge of their Merits by what was whiſpered to him concerning them; that any Perſon might be ſo unhappy as to have ſecret Enemies, and that he was in a miſerable condition to depend always upon thoſe that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed his Ear.</q> When he perceived the Queen-Mother to ſpeak to him after this manner, he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the buſineſs no longer, and ſo every thing was adjuſted. <hi>Don Pedro de Arragon</hi> received Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders on the Twentieth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> to acquaint the Dutcheſs <hi>de Terra Nova</hi> with the Queen's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and with the Reaſons ſhe pretended to Aſſign againſt her Conduct; that the beſt way ſhe could take, would be to obey without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and to make it appear, as well as ſhe could, that ſhe retired of her own Accord.</p>
            <p>This Blow did not ſurprize her, ſince ſhe was long ago prepared for it, by the private Whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perings that were ſpread about the Court. She anſwered <hi>Don Pedro de Arragon</hi> in a very few Words, and could not yet bring her ſelf to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the King had given his Conſent to her Removal: So ſhe was reſolved to be ſatisfied of the truth of it from his own Mouth. She
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0148502702:85"/>
waited to ſpeak with him, as he was juſt going to ſit down to Dinner, and entertained him for ſome time in a low Tone; at laſt raiſing her Voice to a higher pitch, ſhe demanded leave of him to retire. The King anſwered her aloud, <hi>I give you my Conſent, Madam; you may retire as ſoon as you pleaſe.</hi> Theſe few Words were like to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſe all the Conſtancy of the Dutcheſs; ſhe changed Colour ſeveral times, and advanced a few ſteps to ſpeak in private with him again; but he turned his back towards her, and asked ſomething or other of the Duke <hi>de Uzeda.</hi> She went haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of the Room, and retired to her Chamber to compoſe her ſelf again; but the diſorder ſhe was in, would not permit her to appear before the Queen till Evening; and then ſhe came to wait upon her at Supper, and at her going to Bed, with as unconcerned an Air, as if nothing had paſſed, though to counterfeit this, gave her a great deal of trouble, becauſe ſhe was throughly netled. The Queen was informed by the King of what he had ſaid to her; however, ſhe had the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs not to diſcover any thing of it, although ſhe had no Reaſon to be well-pleaſed with her.</p>
            <p>Next Morning, the Dutcheſs, who had not gone to Bed, but had paſſed the whole Night walking in her Chamber, with the Dutcheſſes <hi>de Monte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon</hi> and <hi>de Hijar</hi> her two Daughters, only waited till the Queen was up, to go and take her leave of her. Her Viſage was more pale than ordinary, and her Eyes more red and fiery: She then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached the Queen, and without weeping, or ſhewing the leaſt Concern, told her, She was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſorry that ſhe had not ſerved her ſo well as ſhe wiſhed. The Queen, who was a Perſon of wonderful Tenderneſs, could not forbear to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0148502702:86"/>
ſeem ſomewhat touched, and to relent a little; but as ſhe was ſaying ſome obliging things to comfort her, the Dutcheſs interrupted her, and told her with an imperious Air, <q rend="inline">That a Queen of <hi>Spain</hi> ought not to weep for ſo inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a matter; That the <hi>Camarera</hi> who came to ſucceed her in her Place, would acquit her ſelf better of her Duty:</q> And ſo, without ſaying a Word more, ſhe took hold of the Queen's Hand, and making a ſhew of kiſſing it, immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired. When every one about the Court knew that ſhe was to go away, they came to her Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhedding Tears, either through Policy, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, or Weakneſs. She did not ſeem to them to be in the leaſt afflicted, and caſting her Eyes on all ſides, ſhe ſaid: <hi>I thank Heaven, this is a Place where I ſhall never ſet my Foot again; I am going to taſte the Sweets of Repoſe, and to find Tranquility at my own Houſe: I will go to</hi> Sicily<hi>, there I ſhall meet with no ſuch Diſguſts as I have found at</hi> Madrid. In ſaying theſe Words, ſhe ſtruck her Fiſt twice upon a little Table that ſtood near her, and taking a very pretty <hi>China</hi> Fan, ſhe broke it in two, threw it upon the ground, and ſtampt it under her Feet.</p>
            <p>Thus ſhe was ſent away a few days after the Father Confeſſor; ſhe that never thought of leaving the Court, as well by reaſon of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendant ſhe had got over the King, as becauſe it was a thing without a Preſident, till now, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the Queen's <hi>Camarera Major,</hi> unleſs it ſo happen'd, that ſhe deſired it her ſelf. 'Tis eaſy to imagine the Grief ſhe felt upon this occaſion; however, to comfort her in ſome meaſure, it was reſolved to beſtow the Vice-Royſhip of <hi>Gallicia</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Duke <hi>de Hijar,</hi> her Son-in-Law, and the Order of the Fleece upon the Duke <hi>de Monteleon,</hi>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:0148502702:87"/>
who had married her Grand-Daughter. They were likewiſe willing ſtill to continue to her the Honours and the Appointments belonging to her Place; but as ſoon as ſhe was informed of the good intentions of the Court towards her, ſhe proudly ſaid, That ſhe would refuſe every thing they could offer her, and that <hi>this was to give her Incenſe, forſooth, and break her Noſe with the Cenſer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As ſoon as ſhe was departed from the Palace, the Dutcheſs <hi>de Albuquerque</hi> went thither to take poſſeſſion of her Apartment; and though ſhe had the Character of a Proud Haughty Woman, yet ſhe did not make it appear, that ſhe intended to Copy after the Dutcheſs <hi>de Terra Nova</hi>'s Conduct: On the other hand, ſhe entertained all People with a World of Reſpect and Civility, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the greateſt Affection imaginable for the Young Queen. This Lady was Widow to the Duke <hi>de Albuquerque,</hi> who was Chief of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily <hi>de la Cueva,</hi> and was Fifty Years old. I always ſaw her wear a little Bandore of Black Taffata, which reached down as low as her Eye-Brows, and bound her Forehead ſo hard, that her Eyes were ſwelled with it. She was a Woman of great Wit and Reading, and on certain days in the Week, held Aſſemblies at her Houſe, where all the Learned were well received. She had on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one Daughter, whom ſhe married to the Youngeſt Brother of the late Duke <hi>de Albuquerque,</hi> to keep up the Name of the Family. She was paſſionately devoted to the Queen-Mother's Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and People did not doubt, but that ſhe would uſe the Young Queen very well. They were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards confirmed in this Opinion, when they heard the King, a little after her admittance to Court, tell the Queen, That he would have her
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0148502702:88"/>
take her Pleaſure more than ſhe had hitherto done; That ſhe muſt walk abroad, and ride on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back; and that he was willing ſhe might go to Bed late, provided he might go to Bed at Eight a Clock, as his Cuſtom was. Nay, he was ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry complaiſant a few days after, as to reſolve not to go to Bed till Ten. This agreeable Alteration in his Conduct, gave the World occaſion to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, that the Dutcheſs <hi>de Albuquerque</hi> had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged the Queen-Mother to ſpeak to the King in favour of her; and that the Severity which the Queen had hitherto undergone, had been inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the King only by the means of the Dutcheſs <hi>de Terra Nova.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Marqueſs <hi>de Caralvo,</hi> who was of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of State, died about this time: He left prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Sums of ready Money behind him; and the Crown gained by his Death ſixty ſeven thouſand Crowns; which was yearly given him by way of Penſion. The Admiral of <hi>Caſtile</hi>'s Lady died likewiſe, and as he had lived after a very indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent manner with her always, and was one of the greateſt Admirers of the fair Sex in all the World; ſo he did not over-much complain for his Wife's Death, nor was over-ſorrowful to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Widower. He had accuſtomed her to ſee near fifteen or ſixteen of his Miſtreſſes live, in his Houſe with him, in very fine Apartments, and all different; and he was ſometimes ſo mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, when ſhe walked out in the Garden, as to look out of a Window with one of theſe Creatures ſtanding by him, who let her Handkerchief, or a Ribbon drop, and the Admiral would call to his Wife to take it up, and bring it to the Perſon to whom it belonged; which ſhe ſubmitted to do, with a Reſpect and Patience that all the World admired.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:0148502702:89"/>
It happened to be ſaid at Court, That a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Man was found digging in the Ground very early in the Morning, over againſt the <hi>Imperial Colledge.</hi> His Deſign was to take up ſome Money and Jewels, which a <hi>Jew,</hi> who had been burnt, and whoſe Domeſtick he was, had buried in that place. The King ordered him to bring what he had found there: It was all locked up in a little Iron Cheſt, which was full of Pieces of Gold of ſeveral ſorts; and amongſt the reſt, there were Two Pictures which I have ſeen, bigger than my Hand, and in circled round with Diamonds of a conſiderable Value: about them were Two little Scrowls of Parchment, with ſome Writing upon them; upon one, <hi>The Dutcheſs de Chievreuſe</hi>; and on the other, <hi>The Dutcheſs de Montbazon.</hi> It was judged, that the <hi>Jews</hi> who traffick much, and lend Money upon Pawns, came perhaps by theſe Pictures after the ſame manner. They were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly finiſhed, and the Ladies were both of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Beauty. The King ſaid, that they ought to be ſent to the <hi>Eſcurial.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I often had the happineſs to ſee the Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>de Liche,</hi> who was one of the moſt beautiful and agreeable Perſons at Court; her Husband was a Man of infinite Wit: He was much againſt his Will Ambaſſador at <hi>Rome</hi>; and when he was to go thither, endeavoured all the ways in the World to break off his Voyage. He tarried a long time upon the Coaſts of <hi>Spain,</hi> and was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to depart, pretending that he was ill, and praying them to ſend another in his room, to whom he offered to give all his Equipage, as a free Gift, or elſe to truſt him for it, at his choice: But the Court was afraid of the Vivacity of his Genius, and he was known to be a Man of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe:
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0148502702:90"/>
For this Reaſon it was thought conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to keep him at a diſtance, and ſo they ſent him freſh Orders to depart, and go to <hi>Rome.</hi> He appeared there with a great Magnificence, and ſupported the Honour of his Miniſtry very well. When the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> was made Chief Miniſter, he writ ſeveral Letters to him, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd the Intereſt of all his Family to get him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf recalled. It was poſitively denied him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was feared now more than ever; And it was apprehended, in caſe he returned home, that he would unite himſelf with his Brother the Count <hi>de Monterei.</hi> To theſe Reaſons of State the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> joyned ſome private ones, that purely reſpected his own proper Intereſt: for it was an eaſy matter to take Advantage of the Abſence of the Marqueſs <hi>de Liche,</hi> to have a certain Law Suit determined, which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending between them.</p>
            <p>The Marqueſs being informed of what had happened, and deſpairing ever to ſurmount thoſe Obſtacles which the Duke laid in his way, thought the ſureſt Expedient to get himſelf recalled home, would be to diſguſt the Pope upon all occaſions; And herein he acquitted himſelf ſo dexterouſly, and did every thing to diſpleaſe the Pope after ſo diſobliging a manner, that his Holineſs ſent the King Word, That unleſs he would recall the Marqueſs <hi>de Liche,</hi> he muſt reſolve to leave <hi>Rome</hi>; intreating him to ſend another Ambaſſador in his Place, ſince he had never ſeen ſo diſagreeable a one as this in all his Life: But they anſwered him, That one of the Reaſons which inclined them to continue him ſtill at <hi>Rome,</hi> was, becauſe his Holineſs had declared, That he would grant the Rights of the Franchiſes, and the Immunities
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0148502702:91"/>
of their Quarter, only to thoſe Ambaſſadors who were then reſident in <hi>Rome,</hi> and that thoſe who were to be ſent in their room for the time to come, ſhould no more enjoy them.</p>
            <p>The Pope perceiving that he tormented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in vain; and that if he, for his part, had good Reaſons to demand the recalling of the Marqueſs <hi>de Liche,</hi> the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> had alſo theirs to deny it, did not renew his Importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties any more: but being reſolved to do all the ill offices he could to the Ambaſſador, who had on purpoſe diſobliged him, as far as lay in his power, he found an opportunity to quit Scores with him; and he took his advantage of it with pleaſure. It was about a Diſpenſation, which the Marqueſs <hi>de Liche</hi> demanded of him in favour of <hi>Don Pedro de Arragon,</hi> his Uncle, to marry <hi>Donna Catalina de la Cerda,</hi> Daughter to the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This young Lady was Niece to <hi>Don Pedro de Arragon,</hi> who was Brother to the Duke <hi>de Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donne,</hi> and to the Cardinal of <hi>Arragon</hi>; and the Duke <hi>de Cardonne</hi> was Father to the Dutcheſs <hi>de Medina Celi:</hi> ſo that there was an abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity for a Diſpenſation. The Marqueſs was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the procuring of it by his Uncle, who writ him word, That he ſhould die conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly, if he could but leave an Heir of his Name and Eſtate behind him; That after he had been twice married, without getting any Children, he hoped his Third Match would prove more For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate to him; and therefore he deſired him not to loſe a moment to obtain of the Pope what he deſired.

him off, and ſent him ſometimes to one, and ſometimes to another Cardinal. In fine, after having made him dance Attendance long enough, till he had loſt all manner of Patience, they blunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told him, that they could by no means grant what he demanded, and that the Pope made a Scruple of giving a Diſpenſation to a Man, who was Seventy Years old, to marry his Niece, who was not yet Sixteen. The Ambaſſador ſenſibly reſented this Refuſal, and ſent ſpeedy notice of it to <hi>Don Pedro de Arragon:</hi> but what gave him a new occaſion to be more diſpleaſed, was to hear, That at the very moment when <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was reading his Letter at <hi>Madrid,</hi> the <hi>Nuncio</hi> brought him a Diſpenſation that was expedited <hi>gratis,</hi> and told him, That he had received it much ſooner, if the Marqueſs <hi>de Liche</hi> had not appeared in the matter. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> ſent his Nephew word of all theſe Circumſtance: who was exceedingly vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at it.

            <p>All the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Officers at <hi>Naples</hi> were enjoyn'd to reaſſume the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Dreſs: 'Twas believed that the <hi>Neapolitans</hi> would ſoon imitate them; but ſeeing they did it not in the leaſt, an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance was publiſhed, by Sound of Trumpet, at the beginning of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> commanding all the Officers of Juſtice to Apparel themſelves after the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Faſhion. This Conduct had never been uſed towards them, had it not been to let them ſee how great a Heart-burning it was to them, to behold them dreſt after the <hi>French</hi> way. The Troops continued ſtill to make Complaints, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was a long time ſince they had been paid

off: They ſpoke ſeveral times to the Vice-Roy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, who ſent them to the Secretary of War, and he to the Caſh-Keeper, or Pay-Maſter to the Army. He anſwered them, That the Military Funds were clearly exhauſted, and that he was not in a Condition to ſatisfy them. This makes it ſufficiently appear, That the extream Miſery, which indeed oppreſſed the whole <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, was not only perceived at <hi>Madrid.</hi>

            <p>The King being fully reſolved to endeavour, as far as in him lay, the Eaſe and Satisfaction of his People, and thinking himſelf obliged to the Performance of it, by thoſe things which Father <hi>Francis de Relux</hi> had ſaid to him, at the time when he was his Confeſſor, acquainted the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> with his Deſigns to eſtabliſh a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Council, where all manner of Affairs ſhould be debated; and it ſhould be compoſed of the Conſtable of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> the Marqueſs <hi>de Los Balba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zez,</hi> the Inquiſitor General, and <hi>Don Melchior Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varra.</hi> The Chief Miniſter was to be the Head of it, but the King reſerved to himſelf the laſt Reſolutions of things, and all Favours, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals of Places. The Duke approved at firſt of the King's Project, but after he had maturely deliberated upon it, he went to the King on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to diſſuade him from it, out of an Aſſurance, that the Council of State would be Jealous of it, which was compoſed of ſome of the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Perſons in the Kingdom; that this would occaſion a vexatious difference between them, and rather hinder the Succeſs and Advancement of Affairs, than promote them. <hi>Don Melchior Navarra,</hi> Vice-Chancellor of <hi>Arragon,</hi> obtained all the Appointments and Profits, which the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents of that Council were formerly uſed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy.</p>

It was not at all queſtioned, but that the Queen-Mother advanced the Dutcheſs <hi>de Albuquerque</hi> to the Place where now ſhe was to be ſeen; and People were as fully perſuaded, that it was ſhe who got the Prince <hi>de Parma</hi> to be ſent into <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> to recompence the great Zeal he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways expreſſed in her Service. But the Council of State began to be Alarmed at the great Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of this Princeſs. <hi>What is the matter?</hi> would they uſually ſay one to another, <hi>Are we going to have a new Regency, and is the King reſolved to be under Wardſhip again?</hi> What gave them the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt occaſion to talk after this manner, was as follows: The Council having, according to the Cuſtom, named Three Subjects for the Vice-Royſhip of <hi>Peru,</hi> out of which number the King generally chuſes one; his Majeſty, without having any regard to it, named <hi>Don Melchior Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varra,</hi> who had advanced his Fortune by the means of the Queen-Mother, and was abſolutely devoted to her. He was born in <hi>Arragon,</hi> of an obſcure Family, and at firſt was an Advocate, and afterwards a Counſellor at <hi>Naples</hi>; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come to <hi>Madrid,</hi> he there became Fiſcal to the Council of <hi>Arragon,</hi> and had the good Fortune to pleaſe the Queen-Mother, who was then Regent. She made him Vice-Chancellor of <hi>Arragon,</hi> which is one of the moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Places, out of pure Spight to the Council of State, who oppoſed her, ſo that ſhe could not beſtow this Office upon the Prince <hi>de Stillano.</hi> The <hi>Juncto</hi> of the Government refuſing to admit him, ſhe put the other in his Place, that ſhe might always have one of her own Creatures in that <hi>Juncto</hi>; and beſides this, might always be informed for the time to come of what was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted there.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:0148502702:95"/>
The Queen had no ſooner given this Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of her Affection to <hi>Don Melchior,</hi> but every body ſtood ſurprized to ſee a Man of ſo mean a Birth, advanced to ſo high a Poſt; but when they knew him better, they found him to be a Perſon of great Merit, Experience and Probity. <hi>Don Juan</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> who was mightily diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at his Conduct, baniſhed him, and he came not back to Court till after the death of that Prince.</p>
            <p>The Queen-Mother being deſirous to make him compleatly happy, got the Vice-Royſhip of <hi>Peru</hi> for him, which is a very Advantageous Poſt; for in leſs than five Years time a Man may very well heap up Three Millions by it, without wronging either his own Conſcience, or his Neighbour. Juſt at his departure, they charged him with very rigorous Orders againſt the Governors of that Kingdom, who had made an ill uſe of their Power. This Cuſtom has been taken up of a long time; the Poor and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate only are made Examples, but the reſt make a ſhift to eſcape well enough, by giving a good round Sum of Money, which perhaps they have extorted from other People. But as it always happens, that one Man's good Fortune proves an Obſtacle to that of another, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>de Santa Crux</hi> died of Grief, becauſe he miſt this Place. He had been General of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gallies, and was a Man of Birth and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but ſo extremely poor, that he ſaw nothing elſe could ſet him up again, but the Vice-Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of <hi>Peru.</hi>

Perſonal Merit. He flattered himſelf, that all theſe Conſiderations would infallibly procure him the Vice-Royſhip of <hi>Peru.</hi> He came on purpoſe to <hi>Madrid,</hi> to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite for it; but when he ſaw <hi>Don Melchior Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varra</hi> preferred before him, he could not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter his Grief, and died within few days after. His Death was attended by that of one of the dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Perſons in the World to him, <hi>Donna Antonia de la Cerda,</hi> Daughter to the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> and Wife to the Son of the Marqueſs <hi>de Villa Manriquez.</hi> She was very young, and yet extreamly agreeable.</p>
            <p>The Ambaſſador of the Eſtates of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited Provinces, had Audience of the King, on the Twentieth of <hi>Auguſt:</hi> He demanded of him the Payment of ſeveral Millions that were due from the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> to the Admiralty of <hi>Holland,</hi> ever ſince the Year 1675. The King was only pleaſed to ſay, <hi>Veremos</hi>; and that Evening having ſent for the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> to come to him, <hi>I have never,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſeen ſo many Debts, and ſo little Money to pay them; If this holds, I will give no more Audience to thoſe to whom I am indebted.</hi> The Duke told him, He hoped that in a ſhort time things would be in a better Condition, and that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were rich enough to ſtay a little longer for their Money.</p>
            <p>People talked very ſtrangely at <hi>Madrid,</hi> of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0148502702:97"/>
the King's recalling the Duke <hi>de Veraguas,</hi> who was Vice-Roy of <hi>Valentia.</hi> This little Kingdom is, as it were, annexed to that of <hi>Arragon,</hi> and is a place where there never fail to be abundance of Murderers, Robbers and Cut-Throats. The malignant influence that reigns here, makes the Men naturally ſo bad, that when there is any ill Action to be done, they make uſe of the <hi>Bandolero's,</hi> who are a ſort of <hi>Banditti,</hi> divided into ſeveral Factions, and have each of them their Chief, who are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſeditious Perſons, capable of all the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies in the World. An Apoſtatized Monk took ſhelter amongſt them, and they found him to be ſo reſolute and hardened a Fellow, that they choſe him for their Captain; but as it happened, the very moment he came to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit an Aſſaſſinate, he was taken with his Sword in his Hand. He could not deny ſo palpable a Crime, and the Vice-Roy was adviſed to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute ſpeedy Juſtice upon him. The Vice-Roy was well enough ſatisfied that he ought to ſerve him ſo; but what gave him ſome trouble, was this, That having to deal with a Religious, he thought that he ought to uſe more Formality with him. Another Reaſon likewiſe ſtopt him a little; for by the laws of <hi>Valentia,</hi> ſome days are allotted to Criminals after they are condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, before their Execution. He ordered Four Religious of different orders to meet, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted them upon theſe Two Heads: Two of them were of opinion, that he might take Cognizance of this matter with the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's Conſent: The Two others maintained, That although the Laws of the Countrey al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſome time to a Guilty Perſon, and that this
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0148502702:98"/>
was a Monk belonging to the Eccleſiaſtical Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction; yet for all that, the King's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice demanded a ſpeedy and ſevere Example; and that the Actions of this Man were ſo abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minably odious, that he deſerved to have no Reſpect ſhown him. The Duke <hi>de Veraguas</hi> was of their Opinion, and ordered him to be hanged immediately. The Eccleſiaſticks demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him before Execution; the Archbiſhop ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported them by his Authority, and when he knew it was to no purpoſe, his Official publiſhed an Interdict. The People immediately made an Inſurrection, and the Vice-Roy was obliged to ſhut himſelf up in his Palace; but being beſieged on every ſide, and apprehending ſome danger from the Violence of the Rabble, he eſcaped out of the City well Accompanied. The Archbiſhop loſt no time to inform the Court of what had happened; the Duke too ſent thither as ſoon, and each of them alledged their Reaſons. Upon this the King ordered a <hi>Juncto</hi> to ſit, compoſed of his own Confeſſor, a Jeſuit, and a Dominican. It happened well for the Archbiſhop that he was of the ſame Order with this laſt, and had been Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of his Order; He wanted no more to gain the Cauſe; the Duke <hi>de Veraguas</hi> was condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with one Conſent, and a Sum of Money was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him, with Orders to come within Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Leagues of <hi>Madrid,</hi> and there to wait the King's farther Pleaſure. On the Twenty Sixth of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt</hi> the Count <hi>de Aquilar</hi> was named to ſucceed him in his Place, and within 24 Hours after he departed, to go and take poſſeſſion of it.</p>
            <p>If this affair, the Judgment whereof ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared too rigorous, made ſo great a Noiſe, the Connivance ſhown to the Marqueſs <hi>de Las</hi>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:0148502702:99"/>
               <hi>Navas,</hi> Vice-Roy of <hi>Sicily,</hi> ſurprized People no leſs. He meerly, for a Humour, perſecuted the Archbiſhop of <hi>Palermo,</hi> ſo as to make him leave the City: The King being informed of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, was not only content to Reprimand the Vice-Roy for it, but ordered, That the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop ſhould receive particular Satisfaction from him. He wrote a very obliging Letter to this Prelate, wherein he acquainted him how much he was concerned at the Affronts he had received, and ſent it to the Marqueſs <hi>de Navas,</hi> with Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to deliver it to the Archbiſhop with his own Hands. The Vice-Roy received it, and kept it by him; but they being informed of it at Court, a freſh Injunction was ſent him: He obey'd this no better than the former. This Stiffneſs and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacy of his, perfectly wearied the Council, without drawing the leaſt inconvenience up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; ſo that they no more commanded him to deliver the Letter to the Archbiſhop. It is very certain, that another Man would not have had this Indulgence ſhow'n him; but the Vice-Roy being, it ſeems, obliged to marry his Son to one of the Daughters of the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> this is one Reaſon why he was ſure to meet with good Quarter, as long as the Duke continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Favour. Nevertheleſs, the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvignies,</hi> who was made Governour of <hi>Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> was no ſooner arrived there, but he was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended to ſee the Fortifications and Garriſon in ſo ill a Condition. He plainly told the Marqueſs <hi>de Las Navas,</hi> That he could not diſpenſe with himſelf from giving the Court an Account of theſe matters. He was as good as his Word, and the Vice-Roy received a ſevere Check for his Negligence.</p>
            <p>They had a new occaſion to be diſpleaſed at <hi>Madrid,</hi> when they received Advices of what
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0148502702:100"/>
happened at <hi>Naples,</hi> on the 7<hi>th</hi> of <hi>September:</hi> The Vice-Roy paſſing through the <hi>Toledo-Street,</hi> to go to Viſit the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Nuns, was ſtopt by an Hundred Troopers, all armed, and on Horſe-back, who Audaciouſly demanded of him, either to pay them off, or elſe to diſmiſs them.</p>
            <p>So reſolute an Action as this was, did not a little ſurprize him: He promiſed to do every thing they deſired of him, and returned back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the Palace very ſuddenly. As ſoon as he believed himſelf to be ſafe, he ordered Six Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to be ſent to Priſon, and their Tryals to come on ſpeedily. He reformed all the Cavalry, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Captains, and the other Officers, as well as the Lieutenant General. This Body of Horſe conſiſted of Seven Troops, and had been kept up above Fifty Years. He pretended, That he had received Orders from <hi>Madrid</hi> to reform them after this manner; but the real Truth is, he was not in a condition to pay them. The King of <hi>Spain</hi> hereupon was exceedingly grieved, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Miſery to which all his Kingdoms were reduced.</p>
            <p>But all this evil News was ballanced, when they knew that the Plague was intirely ceas'd in <hi>Andaluzia,</hi> and that the Chief Magiſtrate of <hi>Cales</hi> finding the Port of St <hi>Mary</hi> free from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, had taken off the Prohibition of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce. After this, they immediately begun to load the Gallions. On the Fifth of <hi>September</hi> there were great rejoicings at Court, becauſe it was the Birth-day of his Moſt Catholick Majeſty: A Comedy was Acted there, and all the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors and Grandees of <hi>Spain</hi> were preſent at it. The Queen appeared ſo covered with Jewels, that her Diamonds caſt a greater Light than ſix large Flambeaux, as big as Torches did, that were lighted in the Great Hall. A few days after
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0148502702:101"/>
this, the King and the two Queens went ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Chappel, where the Anniverſary of <hi>Philip</hi> IV. was celebrated with great Ceremonies. The Queen being returned to the Palace, found a Sealed Letter in her Pocket, having the ſame Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſcription with that which ſhe formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; and ſeeing written on the out-ſide, <hi>For the Queen alone,</hi> ſhe would not open it, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt diſtracted her ſelf in thinking what Perſon it was, that could find the means to come ſo nigh her, as to ſlip this Letter into her Pocket. Towards Evening ſhe went along with the King to the Queen-Mother's Palace, to make her the uſual Compliments of Condolance, upon the Death of the late King her Husband. The Dutcheſs <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> told the King, That ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Letter from <hi>Iſpahan,</hi> the Capital City of <hi>Perſia,</hi> which had great Curioſities in it. The King replied, That he was deſirous to hear it.</p>
            <p>All the Company being gone out of the Room, ſhe placed her ſelf near him to read it. The Queen took her advantage of this Opportunity, and told the Queen-Mother, That ſhe had a great deſire to ſee a Picture of <hi>Titian,</hi> which ſhe had lately bought. As ſhe ſaid theſe Words, ſhe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced towards the great Cloſet of the Queen-Mother, whither ſhe follow'd her. When they had entred into it, the Young Queen gave her the Letter, which ſhe had found in her Pocket, and deſired her to keep it, or burn it, as ſhe thought moſt convenient. <hi>I don't know,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>but it may come from the Dutcheſs</hi> de Terra Nova; <hi>but ſhe ſhall be clearly miſtaken in her Project.</hi> The Queen-Mother told her, That ſhe had beſt open the Letter to ſee what was contained in it. <hi>Ah, Madam,</hi> replied the Queen, <hi>I would never, by my good Will, ſee any ſuch Letters.</hi> The Queen-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther admired the prudent Conduct of this Young
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0148502702:102"/>
Princeſs, and bid her not diſquiet her ſelf about the matter; for ſhe would take care to keep it ſealed by her: And ſome time after, ſhe recounted this Adventure to the Marchioneſs <hi>de Mortare,</hi> and ſhow'd her the firſt Letter, ſaying, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it proceeded from the Malice of ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who deſigned to do the Queen a Miſchief. It was through this Lady's means, that my Couſin and I came to know all that I have written con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Affair.</p>
            <p>The Queen, and the Queen-Mother did not tarry long together, but came to find the King, who told them, That the Dutcheſs <hi>de Medina Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li</hi> had read a Letter to him, wherein was contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a very Tragical ſurpriſing Accident, and that they would by no means think their time loſt to hear it. The Dutcheſs immediately read the Letter; it was dated from <hi>Iſpahan,</hi> the 18<hi>th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> 1680, and gave an Account, how, That on the 23<hi>d</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> in the ſame Year, the City of <hi>Maſulipatan,</hi> which is the greateſt Scale of Trade in the Kingdom of <hi>Golconda,</hi> had been overflow'd by the Sea, and by extraordinary Rains, accompanied with a furious Hurricane: That above Twenty five thouſand Perſons were drowned there, and that the loſs of the Goods and Merchandize amounted to Twenty Millions: That it had Rained Blood for the ſpace of Two Hours, in the Village of <hi>Sohou,</hi> near <hi>Deli,</hi> where the <hi>Great Mogul</hi> keeps his Reſidence; and that part of the City of <hi>Sougean,</hi> near <hi>Daera,</hi> had been over-whelmed by an Earthquake: That the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> having received Advice, That the <hi>Raja Seva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi,</hi> after he had pillaged the City of <hi>Danga,</hi> threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to beſiege <hi>Bombay,</hi> (which is a Place that was yeilded up by the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> to them, together with <hi>Tangier,</hi> upon occaſion of the Marriage of the <hi>Infanta Catharina,</hi> Queen of <hi>England</hi>) had
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0148502702:103"/>
ſent ſome Men of War to <hi>Bombay</hi> to defend it; but that it was very much queſtioned whether they would be able to hold in out againſt a Prince who continued to make his Conqueſts with ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious a Swiftneſs, and who had already defeated <hi>Cercan Loudi,</hi> a Prince dependent upon the King of <hi>Viſiapour.</hi> He had poſſeſſed himſelf in leſs than Two Years, of all the Territory ſituate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Coaſts of <hi>Coromandel.</hi> The King of <hi>Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apour</hi> being concerned at the Misfortune of this Prince, who was juſt upon the point of Marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Princeſs <hi>Famika,</hi> his Siſter, deſigned to aſſiſt him, and ſent his Forces under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Famika,</hi> who was as brave as an <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon,</hi> Beautiful and Haughty. The Prince <hi>Seva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi</hi> knowing that ſhe marched againſt him, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced with his Army, and met her towards the Kingdom of <hi>Golconda.</hi> She ſent a <hi>Zagay</hi> to him, with a Sabre, and writ to him, That in caſe he was ſo pleaſed, they would decide the Quarrel by a ſingle Combat. He accepted the Challenge, took the Arms ſhe ſent him, and returned her o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. The Two Armies were drawn out in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, with Orders, not to make the leaſt move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as long as the Combat continued. The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs was vanquiſhed, and ſurrendered her ſelf Priſoner. The Prince <hi>Cercan Loudi,</hi> who was with her, was driven into Deſpair, when he ſaw his Miſtreſs taken away from him; he threw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, with his Forces, upon thoſe of <hi>Sevagi,</hi> and after a long Combat <hi>Cercan</hi> was taken Priſoner; and the Prince remained Maſter of the Field. After this, he ſtill carried <hi>Famika</hi> along with him; and ſhe appeared ſo charming to him, that he told her, If ſhe was willing to marry him, he would reſtore to <hi>Cercan Loudi</hi> all that he had taken from him by way of Conqueſt. The Princeſs haughtily replied, That ſhe would never ſacrifice
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0148502702:104"/>
her ſelf to one that was a Subject to the King her Brother. <hi>Sevagi,</hi> who was deeply in Love with her, diſpatched an Envoy to the King of <hi>Viſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour,</hi> to demand <hi>Famika</hi> of him, and promiſed, That if he would beſtow that Princeſs upon him, he would ſerve him as his Vaſſal. The King ſcorned the Propoſal, treating him as a Revolted Subject, whom he knew well enough how to chaſtiſe. When the other ſaw that gentle Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods ſignified nothing, he preſently fell a Rava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Country of <hi>Viſiapour,</hi> from <hi>Surat</hi> to <hi>Goa,</hi> except ſix or ſeven Places upon the Coaſts; ſo that his Conqueſts extended as far as <hi>Negapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>; and this, in all, made near 250 Leagues in length. He always carried his Fair Priſoner along with him, hoping to gain her by his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and Complaiſance; but having had one day a very long Converſation with her upon this Topick, wherein ſhe declared, That all the Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries either ſhe, or thoſe of her Family, ſuffered at his Hands, only ſerved to provoke her the more, and that ſhe would never love any one but <hi>Cercan Loudi</hi>; the Love of <hi>Sevagi</hi> was in a moment turned into Fury, and he had the Cruelty to cauſe a Scaffold to be erected for her, where with his own Hands he cut off the Head of the young Princeſs <hi>Famika,</hi> and her Lover.</p>
            <p>The Queen-Mother having a great kindneſs for the Marchioneſs <hi>de Grana,</hi> received two of her Daughters, who were very lovely and well ſhaped, into the number of her Ladies.</p>
            <p>A ſhort time after, the King, the two Queens, and all the Court, departed for <hi>Aranjuez</hi>; but the Houſe not being large enough to lodge half the Officers and Ladies, they came back every Night, and lay near it. The Duke <hi>de Uzeda,</hi> the Count <hi>de Altamire,</hi> and the two Sons of the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> diſguiſed themſelves like Mule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0148502702:105"/>
with Bonnets, after the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Faſhion, pulled over their Heads to hide them; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dreſs'd after Faſhion, they went every day on Foot by the Boot of the Coach of the Queen's Maids of Honour, to Court their Miſtreſſes, as the Cuſtom is there.</p>
            <p>Although the King had Prohibited all Perſons in General, and Married People in Particular, <hi>Los Galanteos de Palacio,</hi> as they call it, at <hi>Madrid</hi>; yet he was not able to hinder it. It has been a thing eſtabliſhed time out of mind amongſt them, to entertain the Ladies of the Court, with their Gallantry, although they have not the leaſt deſign to marry them: And they wait upon them with as much Aſſiduity, as if they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready betrothed to them. But what is the ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, as well as the leaſt pardonable thing of all, is, that they ruine themſelves by it: I have feen married Men, nay, even thoſe that were Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, totally taken up in an Amour with one of the Ladies of the Court. The Women, whoſe Husbands are led away with theſe Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant Fancies, are extremely diſguſted at it; and this often occaſions horrid Diſorders in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies; but all that theſe Cavaliers pretend to reap by their Paſſion, is only, that their Miſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes will ſuffer them to come and ſtop under their Windows. Here they ſit in the back part of their Coaches, and entertain them by their Fingers, and the Ladies anſwer them after the ſame manner, without ſpeaking to them, but only upon days of Ceremony; for at that time, they have the liberty to Accoſt them before all the World. But what is very ſurpriſing, and was never yet practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed any where elſe, the Ladies of Honour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Queen, receive Jewels, Apparel, and conſiderable Sums of Money from their Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants. The Dukes <hi>de Montalte</hi>; and <hi>de Medina</hi>

               <hi>Sidonia,</hi> having no Office to oblige them to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Court to <hi>Aranjuez,</hi> ſent their Stewards, Cooks, and other Servants, with Gold and Silver Plate, to carry Magnificent Repaſts to their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, as long as they ſtaid at <hi>Aranjuez.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Diverſion there is but little, becauſe the greateſt pleaſure one can take, is to walk along the ſides of the River <hi>Tagus,</hi> which waſh the Banks of the fineſt Walks in the World; but the Rains were ſo great, that no body could ſtir out When there was the leaſt fair Weather, the Queen rode on Horſe-back with all her Ladies, but one of them had the miſchance to be carried away by her Horſe, and received ſo much hurt by her Fall, that ſhe died within three days after. This ill Accident troubled the King exceedingly, ſo that by his good Will, he would not ſuffer the Queen to ride: When he ſaw her not, he would ſtill be crying. <hi>Let ſome body go to ſee how my Queen does, and bring me word, whether ſhe is fallen off her Horſe.</hi> The King was informed at <hi>Aranjuez,</hi> that two <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Men of War, in their return to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> had met a <hi>French</hi> Veſſel, commanded by the Chevalier <hi>de Leti:</hi> He demanded the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute of them; and upon their refuſing to do it gave them a Broad-ſide, which they anſwered with all their Guns; but after a long diſpute, he obliged them to ſtrike the Flag. After this, the Veſſel continued its courſe towards <hi>Villa Franca</hi> where the Ambaſſador of <hi>Savoy</hi> waited to be carried over to <hi>Portugal.</hi> Upon this the King <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

along with him thither, till he had ſtaid ſome time at ſome of the other Houſes belonging to the Kings of <hi>Spain.</hi> He had been told, That it was looked upon to be an ill Omen, to go firſt to the place where the Royal Tombs are; and ſince the Queen had as yet been only at <hi>Buen Retiro, à la Caſa del Campo,</hi> at <hi>Pardo,</hi> and <hi>Zarzuela,</hi> which are ſo near <hi>Madrid,</hi> that ſhe juſt reſted her ſelf there a few hours, after ſhe came from hunting. He was reſolved to begin with <hi>Aran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juez,</hi> to avert and fruſtrate thoſe evil Preſages: Therefore he ordered every thing to be in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for his Journey, by the beginning of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> which is one of the fineſt Months of the Year in <hi>Spain:</hi> But the Miniſters not finding Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney enough in the Treaſury to defray the Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Progreſs, dexterouſly endeavoured to put it by; though in all appearance they ſeemed to deſire it as much as the King did, and daily ordered Mules to be got ready to carry the Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage. They pretended the Ways were dangerous and bad, and at laſt, that the great Rains had corrupted the Air. Nay, they ſent for ſome Phyſicians, with whom they had been practiſing, to confirm all they ſaid. Notwithſtanding theſe Reaſons, the King ſtill perſiſted in his Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to go to <hi>Aranjuez,</hi> and did not know till the very Evening before he was to depart, that he could not go. He was the only Perſon that was ignorant of it; for the Miniſters had acquainted their Friends with it above Twelve Days before, and all the City was informed, that the King was to ſtay at <hi>Madrid</hi> ſtill. The Queen was not a little diſpleaſed at theſe Proceedings; ſhe ſpoke to the King about it, and told him, that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters might now very well forbear to uſe them any longer like Children; that if there had been any important Reaſons why they ſhould not go
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0148502702:108"/>
to <hi>Aranjuez,</hi> they ought to have given them timely notice of it; but to put them off, and, ſpeaking properly, to fool them after this inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable rate, was never to be endured. The King was vexed, and told the Queen, That this ſhould be the laſt time he would ſuffer ſuch things at their Hands, and that they ſhould direct them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for the future, only by his Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. This Diſcourſe was over-heard by ſome of the Gentlemen of the Bed-Chamber, who went preſently to acquaint the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> with it, to make their Court by this means. He was terribly diſheartned, and feared leſt the Queen, who was charming and witty, might come to get a greater Aſcendent over the King's Inclinations than he deſired; and therefore that he might not diſpleaſe the King any more, uſed all imaginable diligence to provide a Fund ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to bear the Expences of going to <hi>Aranjuez</hi> and the <hi>Eſcurial.</hi> Till this very moment, he had reſolved to break off theſe Two Journeys; but he apprehended a great deal of danger from the Queen's diſſatisfaction; and ſo to get a Sum ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the occaſion, he ſold Two Offices of the <hi>Contador Major</hi> for Twenty five thouſand Crowns, and received Forty more for a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the <hi>Indies.</hi> He took Fifty thouſand Crowns out of an Hundred thouſand, that were to be laid out in Equipping of the Gallions. He made uſe of the Money gathered for Cuſtom, that was to have paid off the Rights of the Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſes, and the Revenues of the Town-Hall: In a word, every thing was got ready by that time the Court came back from <hi>Aranjuez,</hi> for them to go to the <hi>Eſcurial.</hi> However, the King was not able to go as ſoon as he deſired, by reaſon that the ill Weather increaſed; ever ſince the be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>September</hi> never a day paſſed withou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

violent Tempeſts, accompanied by dreadful Claps of Thunder: The Lightning ſtruck abundance of Perſons in ſeveral Places, and the Hail fell ſo thick, and in ſuch prodigious quantities in the Foreſt of the <hi>Pardo,</hi> which is an Houſe of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure belonging to the King, that it broke the Branches of the greateſt Trees, and killed ſo many Birds and Wild-Fowl, that both the Fields and the River of <hi>Mancanarez</hi> were covered with them, and it was the moſt ſurpriſing ſight in the World to behold: The Ancient Bridge <hi>de Aranda de Duero</hi> was carried away by the Waters of that River, and the <hi>Tagus</hi> over flowed its Banks with that Impetuoſity, that it did an incredible Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to the pleaſant Walks at <hi>Aranjuez.</hi> So many Accidents, of which they received freſh News daily, troubled the Court exceedingly; for there was ſcarce a place in <hi>Spain</hi> exempt from theſe continual Tempeſts: One of them hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened on the 26<hi>th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> in ſo outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a manner, that the Gardens of the Counteſs <hi>de Ognate,</hi> which are the fineſt in <hi>Madrid,</hi> were over-flown in a moment; the Water entred into the lower Apartments of her Houſe, where ſhe kept her nobleſt <hi>Italian</hi> Paintings, and her richeſt Moveables, and all was intirely ſpoiled by this Inundation. The Torrent, to work out its paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, threw down the Garden-Walls, and broke into that belonging to our Lady's <hi>de Atocha.</hi> The next Night we all thought, that <hi>Madrid</hi> would be beaten down about our Ears by the Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claps, the Lightning, the Wind, the Rain, and the Hail. I don't believe any body went to Bed in the whole City; the Churches were full of People who confeſſed, as if the hour of Death were approaching. The Water of the <hi>Manca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narez</hi> ſwelled exceedingly, and ſpread it ſelf on all ſides. The King and the Queen, who impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0148502702:110"/>
waited for day-light, went in Devotion to our Lady's <hi>de Atocha,</hi> but at their return they found the <hi>Pardo</hi> over-flown; and though a Coach had been over-turned a little before, by the: apidity of the Torrent, the King believed that his might paſs it well enough, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Coachman to advance ſpeedily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward towards the Bridge of the bare-legged <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtines:</hi> Within a few Paces of the Bridge, the two fore Mules, which in <hi>Spain</hi> are at a pretty diſtance from the hindmoſt, were overturned by the Impetuoſity of the Water: The Poſtillion that led them 'ſcaped very narrowly; the Mules recovered themſelves twice, and were thrown down as often. The King was all alone in the Coach with the Queen, very much concerned, and telling her, that he was in pain only for her ſake. In the mean time, ſome People got hold by the Traces, and ſo drew out the Coach by meet ſtrength. By this means the Mules got out of the Water; but their Majeſties could not reach the Palace, and being affrighted at the great Danger they had juſt eſcaped, were obliged to go to <hi>Buen-Retiro,</hi> where they tarried till mid-night, and waited for the Waters to fall.</p>

Affair. But the King and the Miniſters here, could not forbear to wonder, that his Holineſs ſpoke of renewing his Pretenſions, which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be adjuſted a long time ago.</p>
            <p>The only Son of the Marqueſs <hi>de Caſtel-Rodri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go</hi> died about the beginning of <hi>October</hi>; as did alſo <hi>Don Rui Gomez, de Silva,</hi> Brother to the Duke <hi>de Hijar.</hi> We may ſay, they were two of the moſt handſome and hopeful Lords at Court. This laſt was mightily devoted to <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Iſabella de Mendoza,</hi> a Lady of great Beauty, who was not completely Seventeen Years old. She took the Death of her Lover ſo much to heart, that without acquainting her Mother with it, ſhe got out of her Houſe, covered in a Mantle, and went to the <note n="*" place="margin">A Monaſtery founded by <hi>Joan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> Siſter to <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> IV.</note>
               <hi>Deſcalſas Reales,</hi> there to take upon her the Religious Habit.</p>
            <p>Their Majeſties parted from <hi>Madrid</hi> on the 7<hi>th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> to go to the <hi>Eſcurial.</hi> The King only carried with him the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> the Grand Maſter of the Houſhold, with two Maſters of the Houſe in Ordinary, the Great Foreſter, and the Firſt Gentleman of the Bed-Chamber, and two other Lords in the ſame Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, <hi>Don Geronimo de Eguya,</hi> Secretary of State, and the Marqueſs <hi>de Grana,</hi> Ambaſſador from the Emperor. The Admiral of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> who was Maſter of the Horſe, did not arrive there till Fourteen Days after the King: He was naturally ſo lazy, even when he was obliged to make his Court, that he could not reſolve in a leſs time to go to the <hi>Eſcurial.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All the Ladies of the Court, and Six Women of the Bed-Chamber, Accompanied the Queen; the Marqueſs <hi>de Villa Maina,</hi> Chief Gentleman of the Bed-Chamber, and the Marqueſs <hi>de Aſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gas,</hi>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:0148502702:112"/>
Grand Maſter of the Houſhold, went along with her. As for the Duke <hi>de Oſſone,</hi> who was Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Horſe to her, he tarried at <hi>Madrid</hi> upon the account of a new Diſguſt, he had received at Court. The King was willing that the Queen ſhould ride on Horſe-back, to take a few turns in the Walks of the Meadows, and to meet him as he came from hunting. She had Four Fits of an Ague, but the following ones were ſo gentle that ſhe was able to get up a few days after, and divert her ſelf as ſhe had uſed to do ever ſince her Arrival to the <hi>Eſcurial.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King, who was altogether taken up with the Pleaſures of hunting, purſued the Sport from Sun riſing till Night. One day he ordered a Chace to be prepared after the <hi>German</hi> manner; they had Toils which incloſed a great quantity of Ground, and here with their Guns they killed above Two hundred Bucks and Does. The Queen was at firſt deſirous to be there, but being inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after what manner they uſed theſe poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſhe imagined that ſuch a ſight would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther give her occaſion to employ her Pity, than afford her any Pleaſure. The King in all his Chaces generally took no more with him than the firſt Gentleman of the Bed-Chamber, and the great Foreſter; he loved to find himſelf alone in vaſt Solitudes, and ſometimes it was a long while before they could find him. When he hunted after the <hi>German</hi> manner, he would be accompanied by the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> and the Marqueſs <hi>de Grana.</hi> At his return, the Chief Miniſter following the King to the Queen's A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, found that her Majeſty did not caſt her Eyes upon him; he immediately penetrated into the reaſon of this alteration he found in the Queen's Behaviour; for to ſay the truth, ſhe was diſpleaſed with him for diſſwading his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0148502702:113"/>
to expedite a Patent for a Government in the <hi>Indies,</hi> which he had granted to her: But when the Duke knew it, he told the King, That the Queen begged this Grace of him, at the intreaty of one of the Women of her Bed-Chamber, who was a <hi>French</hi> Woman, who would get conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably by it, when in the mean time Twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Piſtoles were offered for it. The King thought it was the beſt way to take this Sum, and after this would not hear the leaſt Word of diſpatching the Patent, as he had promiſed.</p>
            <p>But what provoked the Queen infinitely more, was the Conduct he had uſed in her Abſence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Conſtable <hi>Colonna</hi>'s Lady. The Dutcheſs <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> had paſſed her Word to the Queen, as in her Husband's Name, That du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſtay her Majeſty made at the <hi>Eſcurial,</hi> nothing ſhould be done to the prejudice of this Lady. Notwithſtanding theſe Aſſurances, upon which ſhe depended, ſhe was carried away from <hi>Madrid,</hi> and by an Order from the King, confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Caſtle of <hi>Segovia.</hi> To begin this Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from its Original, the Reader is to know, that this Lady was Niece to the late Cardinal <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine:</hi> She brought a very conſiderable Fortune with her at her Marriage; and perhaps the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the <hi>Colonna</hi>'s had ſunk very low without this ſeaſonable Relief. After ſhe had paſſed the happieſt and moſt pleaſant part of her Life at <hi>Rome,</hi> where ſhe always appeared in great Pomp and Splendor, having the liberty to live after the <hi>French</hi> Faſhion, and according to all Appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſeeming to be content with her Fortune: She withdrew all on the ſudden, without ſo much as knowing the Reaſon of it her ſelf, through the ill Counſels of ſome Perſons, who hazarded not a little upon her Account, in making her hazard every thing on her ſide: So that ſhe departed pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0148502702:114"/>
with the Dutcheſs of <hi>Mazarine,</hi> her Siſtet. They had diſguiſed themſelves ſo well, that none knew them when they took Shipping: And thus they arrived ſafely in <hi>France.</hi> The Conſtable <hi>Colonna</hi>'s Lady hoped to find here a Sanctuary againſt her Husband, and ſome vain flattering Idea's, that were not as yet perfectly extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in her Heart, ſerved to perſwade her, that ſhe ſhould be well received at Court; but ſo far was ſhe from meeting any Encouragement to make her Appearance there, that ſhe was prohibited by the King to come there. I have heard her ſay, That ſhe reſented this Treatment with ſo ſenſible a Grief, that ſhe was like to have died of it. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this ſhe went to <hi>Turin,</hi> where ſhe made a ſhort ſtay, and the uneaſineſs of her Mind led her at laſt to <hi>Flanders.</hi> There ſhe happened to find the Marqueſs <hi>de Borgomaine,</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>Eſte,</hi> in whom ſhe repoſed an intire Conſidence, without remembering that he was rather a Friend to her Husband than to her ſelf. He flattered her in all her Projects, in order to amuſe her, and to gain time till he might receive Advice from the Conſtable, how to diſpoſe of her; for he had ſent him a Letter, by a Courier for that purpoſe, to inform him, that his Wife was at <hi>Bruſſels</hi>; and in Anſwer to it, the Conſtable earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him to Seize and Apprehend her. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted himſelf immediately of his Commiſſion, and carried her to a Convent, from whence ſhe was not to depart, unleſs ſhe would conſent to be Ship'd for <hi>Spain,</hi> as they deſired her. When ſhe was at <hi>Madrid</hi> ſhe delay'd, upon ſeveral Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, to take the Religious Habit upon her; ſhe loved her Liberty and was deſirous ſtill to enjoy it: But the Conſtable being informed of her Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, ſent <hi>Don Fornand de Colonna,</hi> his Natural Brother, with Letters to the King, and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0148502702:115"/>
wherein he beſeech'd them, that either by fair means, or violence they would oblige his Lady to enter into a Convent. This Neceſſity ſeemed very hard to her; nevertheleſs ſhe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to it, and retired to the Monaſtery <hi>de Santo Domingo el Real,</hi> upon Condition, That if ſhe happened to come out of it, ſhe would conſent that the King ſhould reſtore her to her Husband. She continued there a long time, and ſometimes in an Evening ſhe eſcaped out with one of her Women, and often went to walk on Foot in a White Mantle in the <hi>Pardo,</hi> where ſhe met with many pleaſant Adventures, becauſe moſt of the Women that come there are Ladies Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers; and ſome Ladies of the beſt Quality at Court, take a mighty pleaſure when they can go thither and are not known.</p>
            <p>The Conſtable <hi>Colonna</hi> being ceme to <hi>Madrid,</hi> in his way to <hi>Arragon,</hi> whereof he was Vice-Roy, went every day to entertain her at the Grate, and I have ſeen him ſhow thoſe Gallantries to her, which a Lover may ſhow to his Miſtreſs. He departed in a very good underſtanding with her; but when the Queen made her entry, ſhe having a great deſire to behold her Majeſty, did not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine they would hold her ſo ſtrictly to the Word ſhe had given the King, That in caſe ſhe ever quitted the place of her Confinement, he ſhould deliver her into her Husband's Hands: So with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more a do, ſhe went to the Marchioneſs <hi>de Los Balbazez,</hi> her Siſter in Law, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived her very kindly, and the Marqueſs made her an Entertainment that might have deceived a Perſon of leſs Faith than her ſelf. Seeing theſe fair Appearances ſhe thought no more of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Santo Domingo,</hi> but ſtaid with the Marchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneſs <hi>de Los Balbazez.</hi> All this while he ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endeavoured to get an Order from the King,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0148502702:116"/>
and as ſoon as he had procured it, carried her to a Convent within Four Leagues of <hi>Madrid.</hi> So ſevere a Procedure afflicted her as much as it is poſſible for a Woman to be afflicted. She wrote to the Queen to demand her Protection; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing informed that the Conſtable was come back from <hi>Arragon,</hi> with his Sons, ſhe obtained a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the King to go into ſome Monaſtery or other at <hi>Madrid.</hi> But whether it were, that ſhe was not content to be there, or that ſhe had ſome other Views in her Head, ſhe made her eſcape, and went ſtrait to her Husband's Houſe: She li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in one half of it, made her Court very regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to the Queen, viſited abundance of Ladies, and diverted her ſelf very well.</p>
            <p>The Conſtable left her an intire Liberty to do what ſhe pleaſed; but when he was deſirous to return to <hi>Rome,</hi> he talked of carrying his Lady along with him thither. She was migtily A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed at it, and declared, that ſhe would not go. The Reaſon was, becauſe ſhe had got her Nativity to be Calculated, and it was told her, That if ſhe had another Child, ſhe ſhould die. This Prediction was ſo freſh in her imagination that ſhe would rather chuſe to return to her old place of Retreat. The King was urgent with her to explain her meaning; She ſent him Word back again, That ſhe humbly requeſted him to grant her his Protection, in the deſign ſhe had to throw her ſelf into a Convent.</p>
            <p>The King judged it convenient, That the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitor General, <hi>Don Melchior Navarra,</hi> and his Confeſſor, ſhould meet to determine this dif<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ference between the Conſtable and his Lady<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Marqueſs <hi>de Los Balbazez</hi> ſollicited ſo powerfully, that the <hi>Juncto</hi> concluded to ſend her to the Caſtle of <hi>Segovia.</hi> This he ſo paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately <pb n="115" facs="tcp:0148502702:117"/>
deſired, that all the laſt Year he was perpetually troubling his Brain, how to do her ſome ill Office. But the Conſtable of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and the Admiral, ſet themſelves all they could to oppoſe it; and they were not able to obtain an Order for it.</p>
            <p>They had never obtained one, if the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> had not been an Enemy to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable's Lady. She being informed of what had paſt againſt her, and what Reaſons ſhe had to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend ſome Miſchief from her Enemies, caſt her ſelf at the Queen's Feet, and conjured her, with Tears in her Eyes, not to abandon her in this diſtreſs, but to engage the Chief Miniſter to paſs his Word, that nothing ſhould be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted againſt her as long as the Court was at the <hi>Eſcurial.</hi> The Queen interpoſed in this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, as I have already mentioned; but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this Precaution, within Eight Days after her departure, a Counſellor of the Counſel Royal, with his Officers, Accompanied by the Conſtable <hi>Colonna,</hi> and the Marqueſs <hi>de Los Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bazez,</hi> who performed the Office of Bailiffs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Armed, as if they had been going to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend a Ring-Leader of Robbers, rather than an unfotrunate Lady, who was not capable of making the leaſt Reſiſtance, went about Eleven a Clock at Night to break open the Doors of her Appartment, although it was within her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's Houſe. She was in her Chamber, when immediately an <hi>Alcade</hi> of the Court pretended to tie her Arms with a Cord: Seing herſelf uſed after ſo ignominious a manner, ſhe took up a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Knife, which lay accidenttally up on the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and as ſhe defended her ſelf, gave him a cut in the Hand. This Reſiſtance made the reſt of the Company fall upon her with that barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Fury, that they dragged the poor Lady, half
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0148502702:118"/>
naked, as ſhe was, by the Hairs of her Head, and ſo they forced oer away, like one of the moſt miſerable of her Sex. She was conducted after this manner, all Night long, to the Caſtle of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>govia,</hi> without expreſſing the leaſt conſideration either for her Birth or Reputation, although ſhe had given them no occaſion to treat her thus; for in fine, ſhe was actually at that time in her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's Houſe, and her only Crime was, her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to return to <hi>Rome</hi> with the Conſtable, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſhe offered to go into a Convent, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having the liberty ever to leave it. Moſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons pitied her ſorrowful Condition, and took it ill that they broke their Promiſe to the Queen, and that they durſt employ the King's Name, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſatisfie the Malice and Animoſity of the Marqueſs <hi>de Los Balbazez.</hi> It was for his ſake principally that they uſed this Perſecution to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Conſtable's Lady; for her Husband was one of the beſt conditioned Men in the World: He loved her, and as he had formerly given her his conſent to ſtay ſeveral Years in a Religious Houſe; ſo without queſtion he had not now oppoſed the Conditions ſhe deſired, if it had not been for the Marqueſs <hi>de Los Balba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zez.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He alone managed this Affair, and ſollicited the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> in the Conſtable's Name; and that Miniſter thinking by this means to oblige both of them, gave his conſent to what was demanded of him.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs it was a ſurpriſing thing, that he uſed ſo rude a Conduct towards the on Cſtable's Lady; it had been a more generous and manly part, to endeavour to reconcile the preſent Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences than to impriſon a Lady who was to be Mother in Law to his own Daughter. He ought to have conſidered, that a Husband and a Wife
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0148502702:119"/>
are eaſily brought to accommodate matters; and that if ever they came to be Friends again, his Daughter would fall into the Hands of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable's Lady, who would then be in a condition to revenge her ſelf upon her, for the Injuries he had done her. He might reaſonably imagine, that as ſhe was rich, and had a great number of near Relations, who made a conſiderable Figure in the World; ſo they would never ſee her op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd, without regretting her misfortunes, and intereſting themſelves in her Quarrel: That they would vigorouſly endeavour to procure her her Liberty, and that at the bottom, when he came to caſt up his Accounts, he himſelf would get no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ill will by it.</p>
            <p>This Affair made a great noiſe in the World: I knew every particular Circumſtance of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, becauſe I was intimately acquainted with this Unfortunate Lady, and knew her to be of a good Diſpoſition, and not given to ſpeak ill of other People, and, as it was truly ſaid of her, ſhe was never an Enemy to any one but her ſelf. Indeed it were to be wiſhed, ſhe had been Miſtreſs of more Diſcretion, and had not been of ſo eaſie a Temper as to believe thoſe Perſons who adviſed her ill. She was very lovely, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſhe was not in the Prime of her Youth; her Eyes were lively, quick and piercing; her Teeth admirable; her Hair blaker than Jet, and in a great quantity; her Stature noble, and her Leg well-ſhaped. The Queen being informed of her Misfortunes, was mighitily concerned at them, and continued to be very angry with the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> for not keeping his Promiſe to her.</p>
            <p>The Calamities occaſioned by the Plague, were not the only Evils, which the People of <hi>Spain</hi> ſuffered. The publick Poverty ſpread it
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0148502702:120"/>
ſelf farther ſtill; for the ſcarcity of Proviſions continued, and no Remedies were applied to rectifie theſe Diſorders. No alteration was made in the Government, and the Chief Miniſter ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be poſſeſſed with a Lethargy. Every body hung down his Head, and Men were ſo enfee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, that they had ſcarce ſtrength enough to lift up their Eyes and Hands to Heaven, to implore its Aſſiſtance and Relief. The paſt and preſent Miſeries made them apprehend what was to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; every one made melancholy Reflections upon the ſad condition of Affairs, which carried them farther than they deſired: But to compleate the general Calamity, after they had for ſix Weeks together beheld terrible Inundations that did a world of Miſchief in ſeveral goodly Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, theſe Accidents were followed by an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, which happened two days after the King's departure to the <hi>Eſcurial.</hi> We perceived it at <hi>Madrid</hi> on thh 9<hi>th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> between ſix and ſeven a Clock in the Morning; it was ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent, that it made a general Concuſſion, and the moſt reſolute Perſons were poſſeſs'd with fear. This extraordinary Motion was perceived all the Kingdom over, and even at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Portugal</hi>; but the City of <hi>Malaga</hi> found the ſaddeſt Effects, and ſuſtained the greateſt Loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes by it.</p>
            <p>This City is ſituated in the Kingdom of <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada,</hi> upon the Coaſts of the Mediterranean Sea, within Twenty five Leagues of the <hi>Straights,</hi> at the foot of a Mountain, upon the top of which ſtands a Caſtle that Commands the Town and and the Port. It is large, well peopled, and rich, by reaſon of the conſiderable Trade they drive in <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wine, Oyl, Citrons, Fruits, and other Commodities, which draw a vaſt number of Veſſels to that Port. Its Fortifications, although
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0148502702:121"/>
they are old, are very good, and are adorned with ſeveral ſtately Buildings, which are remainders of the Magnificence of the <hi>Moors,</hi> and the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral Church was formerly the Principal Moſque.</p>
            <p>They perceived there a great Trembling of the Earth, which laſted but a few moments; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Concuſſions were ſo violent, that they cauſed a general fear and deſolation in the City by the ſtrange diſorder it occaſioned. The Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and the Walls on the ſame ſide, with their Bulwarks, Towers, and Ramparts were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown; the Sea was in ſo extraordinary an agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that the Fiſhes every where leapt out of the Water; the Veſſels that were in the Port, were lifted up above Twenty Foot high, and all their ſides crack'd as if they had been in a real Tempeſt, ſo that the Mariners believed they were unavoidably loſt. Fifteen Convents of Men and Women were ruined after that manner, that ſcarce one Stone lay upon another; and in that of the Obſervance of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> there were Fourteen Perſons buried in the Ruins.</p>
            <p>This Magnificent Church, which had been En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged and Beautified in the Year 1521, leaned ſeveral times on its two ſides ready to overturn, and yet received no damage, which the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants took for a Miracle. One thouſand three hundred Houſes were ſorely battered, and more than One thouſand two hundred ruined. 'Tis eaſie to judge what a vaſt number of Perſons muſt have been killed, hurt and buried in this Confuſion. As ſoon as the Earthquake had ceaſed, the Biſhop, followed by his Clergy, and a great multitude of People, went in Proceſſion to the Church, to implore the Divine Commiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Aſſuredly in theſe ſorts of Occaſions the moſt irreligious hardned Perſons pray heartily and ſincerely.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:0148502702:122"/>
The Inhabitants being affrighted, retired into the Country, fearing to be over-whelmed in the City by ſome new Concuſſion, but ſeveral Houſes fell down all about <hi>Malaga</hi>; a great Mountain was perfectly overthrown; the Earth opened in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of places, and caſt up Water in ſuch prodigious quantities, that great Torrents were occaſioned by it, which ſwelled the Rivers ſo as to make them overflow their Banks. 'Twas ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable that the Wall of the Church <hi>d'Alhavrin</hi> opened it ſelf the breadth of four Foot, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards cloſed again, ſo that the place where this fiſſure happened, could not be diſcerned. The Jaſper Pillars in the ſame Church were removed from their Pedeſtals, but afterwards returned to their old place, and ſuſtained no damage. At the City of <hi>Velez Malaga,</hi> the Earth opened and ſwallowed up a River which runs near it; after this it cloſed again with ſo terrible a noiſe, and threw up the Water with ſo great a violence, that it roſe above ten Pikes higher than the Houſes, and had like to have over whelmed every thing when it fell down.</p>
            <p>Several Cities here were entirely overthrown, and the Earthquake did a great deal of miſchief at <hi>Sevil, Corduba,</hi> and at <hi>Jaen,</hi> where Places and Churches, and many Houſes were ruined. It is impoſſible for any thing in Nature to be more terrible than this was; for no body knew where to ſave themſelves, and Death ſeemed to purſue them where-ever they fled.</p>
            <p>A few days after this Earthquake, there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened at Night a Tempeſtuous Storm, which overturned part of the Roof of the <hi>Eſcurial,</hi> broke the Cryſtal Windows of the King's Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and tore up abundance of Trees in the Garden by the Roots. The King perceiving the Queen to be affrighted at it, was ſo complaiſant
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0148502702:123"/>
as to riſe with her, and ſent for ſome Company to come to her Chamber, and comfort her a little.</p>
            <p>It has been a Cuſtom long ago eſtabliſhed in <hi>Spain,</hi> that when any thing happens, the truth of which they cannot immediately diſcover, for the Miniſters to ſuſpect that <hi>France</hi> had a hand in it. Thus they had received certain Advice, that the Count <hi>d'Eſtries</hi> had ſailed with ſeveral Men of War in his Company for the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> and therefore they preſently concluded, that it was he who burnt <hi>Porto-bello</hi>; but they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the contrary by two Veſſels, which were arrived from the <hi>Honduras</hi> at the Port of <hi>Cales,</hi> laden with Six thouſand Cheſts of <hi>Indigo,</hi> and Two hundred thouſand <hi>Piaſters.</hi> Theſe brought word, that ſome <hi>Bucaniers,</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> had landed at the Port <hi>de Baſtimentos,</hi> and after five days march in the Mountains, had attackued <hi>Porto-bello</hi>; that the the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gariſon threw away their Arms, and retired without fighting a ſtroke into the Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del; that a poor <hi>Negro,</hi> who was Seventy Years old, had marched out of it, followed by Twenty five Soldiers, and made a brave Reſiſtance, but was killed upon the place, being abandoned by his Men. The <hi>Bucaniers</hi> carried away Thirty ſix thouſand Crowns, and all the Booty they were able to take with them. In fine, having paſſed the Gulf of <hi>Darien,</hi> and being conducted by the <hi>Indians,</hi> that were Enemies to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they arrived through unknown ways in nine days to the South Sea, within a League of <hi>Panama:</hi> They imbarked in this place in ſome <hi>Canoos,</hi> and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Port <hi>de Perico,</hi> where they made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of three Veſſels, and ſeveral Barks. They went from thence to pillage the Suburbs of <hi>Panama,</hi> the Garriſon of which place, without
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0148502702:124"/>
making any Reſiſtance, retired to a Baſtion, with the Preſident and the Auditors of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer. The <hi>Bucaniers</hi> continned ſome days Maſters of the Sea, but at laſt departed, upon Information that a Relief of Four Hundred Men was coming from <hi>Cartagena,</hi> and that two Veſſels were ſetting Sail from <hi>Lima,</hi> to oppoſe their Deſigns. The Council of the <hi>Indies,</hi> high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provoked againſt the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Soldiers, who had ſhew'd ſo little Courage upon this Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, aſſembled at <hi>Madrid,</hi> and reſolved to ſend Three Hundred <hi>Veterane</hi> Soldiers to reinforce the Garriſons. They gave full Authority to <hi>Don Melchior Navarra,</hi> who was named to go Vice-Roy for <hi>Peru,</hi> to condemn without Appeal the Officers and other Soldiers that were found guilty, and to decimate them, in caſe he found them all in fault, as it was believed here.</p>
            <p>It was no ſmall Mortification to them to hear of the taking of a Veſſel belonging to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Lading whereof was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to be worth Four Hundred Thouſand Crowns in Goods. Six Ships of the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> took her near <hi>Oſtend.</hi> This Prince was highly enraged at the ill Treatment of his Envoy, and it ſeems the Menaces he gave them juſt as he left <hi>Madrid,</hi> were not without effect. 'Twas believed here, that he had done himſelf too much Juſtice; but others, who conſidered this Action without prejudice, were agreed, that it was but Natural for the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> to make recourſe to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, after the unfair meaſures they had kept with him; which he had ſo much the leſs Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to expect, becauſe he was devoted to the Intereſts of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and had chiefly ſupported it in the laſt War. But if theſe Reaſons ſerved to excuſe him, there were
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0148502702:125"/>
others that laid ſome blemiſh upon him, to uſe ſuch an Action of Hoſtility towards a King, with whom he was in Peace, and who had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver failed on his ſide to ſatisfie him, unleſs he had been utterly uncapable of paying him: That at the very time when the Envoy from <hi>Brandenburg</hi> demanded the Money, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had not enough to defray the Expences of his Houſhold, and that if he had been in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Circumſtances, he had dealt better by him.</p>
            <p>The Court was not a little troubled at this Infraction of the Peace; and now they had a freſh Argument to grieve them. They were inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> pretended to keep the Iſland of St. <hi>Gabriel</hi> to themſelves, and that although <hi>Buenoſaires</hi> lay ſo near it, yet they were in a Condition to maintain themſelves there. The Coaſt of <hi>Braſil</hi> lying ſo near, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, them as well as the River, whoſe Channel is ſo very narrow in that place, that it was an eaſie matter to Command it, and to hinder all Commerce. The <hi>Portugueſes</hi> it ſeems had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the the River <hi>de Plata</hi>; and all theſe Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances were the more affiicting, becauſe it was certainly known that a Squadron of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburghers</hi> was gone for the <hi>Indies.</hi> This Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair was talked of, and the Council met about it: But thoſe that were well acquainted with the Genius of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Nation, were ſatisfied that the Alarm would not laſt very long; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe at Court they look upon dangers that are at any diſtance, but as ſo many things that will never happen.</p>
            <p>The King and Queen being come back to <hi>Madrid</hi> from the <hi>Eſcurial,</hi> every one was very forward to make his Court to them; and on the Fourth of <hi>November,</hi> which was the Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0148502702:126"/>
of St. <hi>Charles,</hi> His Majeſty went to the Chap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pel in the Palace, where the Ambaſſadors <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

His Chain, to which the Order of the Fleece was faſtened, glitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſeveral Emeralds half a Finger long<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Queen-Mother writ to the Queen in the Morning, deſiring her to dreſs her ſelf that day after the <hi>French</hi> Faſhion. The Queen carried this Billet to the King, and after ſhe had read it to him, asked him, if he would agree to it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He told her, ſhe look'd ſo pretty in her <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Drſs, that he prayed her not to quit that Habit on a Day of Rejoicing.</p>
            <p>The King took away the Receipt and Amini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Revenues of of <hi>Madrid</hi> from the <hi>Corregidors</hi> and <hi>Regidors,</hi> when he knew their Cheats and Villanies. He intruſted the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them to a Council compoſed of four Perſons, <hi>Don Lopez de los Rios, Don Andrea Villaran, Don Franciſco Carrillo,</hi> and <hi>Don Joſeph Benavidez</hi>; and empowred them to make the <hi>Regidors</hi> give them an account of their Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration. They were accuſed to have gotten the Sum of Eight Hundred Thouſand Crowns by the Expences of the Queen's Entry, and by the Building of the New Bridge at <hi>Toledo,</hi> which was carried away by the Waters of the <hi>Manca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nares.</hi> At the ſame time the Collecting of the Impoſts upon Wine, Victuals, and Coals, was taken away from them. Theſe Alterations di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed the Profits of their Offices ſo mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they could ſcarce get any People to bid
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0148502702:127"/>
ſix Thouſand Ducats for them, whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Reformation, it was an uſual thing to give Ninety Thouſand, although the Salaries were not above Six Hundred Ducats.</p>
            <p>The Chief Miniſter had ſent a Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſome Months before to the Frontiers of <hi>Biſcay,</hi> to adjuſt the Rights of both Sides with the <hi>French,</hi> but he being fond of his Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, endeavoured to prolong it, and ſo deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded none of the Differences. There were ſome Regiments at <hi>Bayonne</hi> poſted all along the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>Bidaſſoa,</hi> and ſome Brigandines blocked up the Mouth of it to hinder the Inhabitants of <hi>Fontarabia</hi> from all manner of Traffick. They could not go out to Fiſh, or commit any of thoſe Acts of Hoſtility, to which they had been ſo long accuſtomed: And now they were given to underſtand, that they ſhould be kept thus impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd till the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> had conſented to a Reaſonable Accommodation. Whilſt matters continued in this Poſture, the Brigandines pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to go away; immediately the <hi>Biſcayners</hi> began to Fiſh, but the <hi>French</hi> coming back upon them, carried them away Priſoners, and made themſelves Maſters of their Barks. As ſoon as this News was brought to <hi>Madrid,</hi> the Miniſters began to exclaim that this was an unheard of Violence, and ſuch an infraction of the Peace, as was never to be endured. But his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty ordered his Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor to acquaint them that they then ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the difficulties which occaſion'd ſo many Diſorders; or till they were regulated to conſent to follow the deciſions which the Commiſſioners of <hi>France</hi> had made after the Treaty of Peace.</p>
            <p>A Perſon of the firſt Quality who had follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the King to the <hi>Eſcurial,</hi> and came back from thence before him, told us, that he had ſtrong
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0148502702:128"/>
conjectures to believe that the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> had fallen out with the Queen-Mother. However, few Perſons ſuſpected it at that time; but after the return of the Court to <hi>Madrid,</hi> it was plain and viſible. Some People pretend that the Duke was wearied with the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Creatures, whom the Queen-Mother dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recommended to him, and to whom he was forced to diſtribute part of his Favours; that now he did not look upon her as any longer ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſupport his Fortune, and therefore was not willing to grant the frequent Demands ſhe made him; that in order to break off with her all at once, he found it convenient to viſit her no more, but expreſs a great coldneſs towards her. On the contrary, there were other Perſons that ſaid, that it was occaſion'd by the Queen-Mother her ſelf, who was not able to conſtrain her ſelf ſo far as to ſuffer the preſence of a Man, who minded nothing but how to advance his Family or Friends, and never ſhow'd any Civilities to her. There were others ſtill that were of Opinion, that the Duke's behaviour towards the Queen-Mother was not the reſult of his own Inclinations, but proceeded from the Suggeſtions of <hi>Don Geronimo D'Eguya,</hi> and indeed it might be ſo, if it were not for the two following Reaſons: The firſt is becauſe there was not the leaſt appearance of any particular mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tive to engage him to deſire a Rupture between the Queen-Mother and the Duke; the othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Humour of <hi>De Eguya</hi> made him always em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Intereſts of the moſt fortunate, and he found himſelf under certain Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which adviſed him not to preſs too far, for fear of diſobliging the chief Miniſter. But notwithſtanding the coldneſs which paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, the King when he was at the <hi>Eſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,</hi> told <hi>D'Eguya</hi> one day very angrily, that if he was not more punctual for the future, to come and help him in the Diſpatches, he would do all the buſineſs with <hi>Vibanco,</hi> who was Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary to the <hi>Chamber,</hi> and for whom the King ſhew'd Inclination enough.</p>
            <p>The Duke immediately, whether out of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity, or Politick, excuſed <hi>De Eguya</hi> ſo hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely, that he ſet him right in the King's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour again; and this Obligation, for which <hi>De Eguya</hi> was indebted to him, made them be in a good Underſtanding with one another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>De Eguya</hi> finding himſelf ſo well with the Duke, confirmed him in all the diſpoſitions he already had, not only in regard to the Queen-Mother, but alſo to the Young Queen.</p>
            <p>He repreſented to him, <q rend="inline">That theſe Two Princeſſes could do nothing for him; That the King would take it well to find him te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie a Devotion only to his own Perſon, and that he would anſwer him with his Affection better, when he ſaw it was not divided.</q>  His true Deſign in ſpeaking to him after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, was only to keep him to himſelf, that ſo the Chief Miniſter might repoſe an intire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in him.</p>
            <p>In fine, they were both agreed, that in order to render the Duke an abſolute Maſter, it would be neceſſary for him to reſolve to refuſe the two Queens whatever Offices or Employments they begged for their Creatures. The Duke ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0148502702:130"/>
that this Counſel proceeded from a true motive of Zeal, which he thought abounded in <hi>De Euguya,</hi> and believed him ſo heartily, that he would do nothing but by his Advice. The Duke was generally complained of, for ſuffering himſelf to be manag'd like a Child, by the only Man of <hi>Spain,</hi> who as he was a Perſon of the greateſt Courtſhip, ſo he was likewiſe of the leaſt Sincerity.</p>
            <p>To purſue the Project of diſguſting the Queen-Mother, the Chief Miniſter ordered Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to be given to ſeveral Perſons who were directly oppoſite to her; the Duke <hi>De villa Hermoſa,</hi> who had got enough in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> were in this number. The Marqueſs <hi>De Aſtorgas</hi> was made maſter of the Ordnance, although he was Comptroller of the Queen's Houſhold; and that ſingle place, with the Wealth he had heaped up in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> might very well ſuffice a Man of his Age. The Chief Miniſter afterwards aſſign'd penſions ro the Women of the Dutcheſs <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> out of the <hi>Bolſillo,</hi> which is a ſort of a privy Purſe for the King's Houſe, and other private Expences. He gratified ſeveral of his own Domeſticks after the ſame manner, whilſt thoſe belonging to the King lay under ſuch great Neceſſities, that they found themſelves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to quit his Service for meer Want and Poverty.</p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> gave one Proof of his Power, which ſucceeded a great deal bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than one could have have believed. On the 13<hi>th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> he married one of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, whoſe Name was <hi>Don Auguſtine Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riquez de Guſman,</hi> a Cadet of the Houſe of <hi>Guſman,</hi> very poor, and of little or no Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to <hi>Donna <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0148502702:131"/>
Duke <hi>de Montalte,</hi> who was but fifteen years old, and ſo rich, that ſhe was looked upon to be the beſt Match in all <hi>Spain,</hi> as well upon the Account of her Father's vaſt Eſtate, as thoſe of the Marqueſs <hi>de Los Velez,</hi> and the Count <hi>de Oropeza,</hi> whoſe Fortunes ſhe was to inherit, in caſe they had no Children. This Affair was the Work of the Dutcheſs <hi>de Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Celi: Don Auguſtine de Gaſman</hi> had waited upon her with ſo much Aſſiduity, that to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence his Services, ſhe procured this Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage for him. All the World was extremely ſurpriſed at it; but no body could compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend upon what Conſiderations the Duke <hi>de Montalte</hi> conſented to ſacrifice his Daughter to Policy. The Marqueſs <hi>de Los Velez,</hi> the Count <hi>de Oropeza,</hi> and all the reſt of their Family were hereupon mightily enraged at the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi>; they quitted his Intereſts, which they had hitherto embraced with Zeal, and they openly declared, that they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſo diſhonourable an Alliance as long as they lived. The Count <hi>de Oropeza</hi> made parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Complaints againſt the Duke, becauſe he had contributed more than any one to his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and that if he had been minded to have taken Advantage of the Favourable Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions his Majeſty had to him, It is certain, that when <hi>Don Juan</hi> was dead, he might have been made Chief Miniſter, notwithſtanding he was ſo young: But as he had a great Reſpect for the Duke, he imagined, that if he vigorous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſiſted him upon ſo important an occaſion, he would always remember him for his Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and that if he did not rule by himſelf, he ſhould at leaſt govern by his Friend. In this he found both Repoſe and Security together, he flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered himſelf with diſpoſing of Favours, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0148502702:132"/>
defended from the Averſion of the People. Theſe Reflections engaged him to employ all his Wit, and all his Credit with the King to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the Duke his Chief Miniſter. But for all this Obligation, which was tranſcendent, and for which he was ſo much indebted to him, he did not act fairly with relation to the Daughter of the Duke <hi>de Montalte</hi>; for altho' the Count <hi>de Oropeza</hi> was her Uncle, yet he knew nothing of her Marriage. The Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>De Los Velez,</hi> Grand-mother to this young Lady, was no better informed of it; they were married privately without any Ceremony, for fear leſt any one ſhould come to diſturb the Feaſt.</p>
            <p>The King and Queen being willing to divert themſelves, went to <hi>Prado,</hi> to hunt there till St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s Day; they came back from thence, by reaſon the Queen-Mother had a ſlight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition upon her, and they were deſirous to viſit her every Day.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Don Philip Vinzani,</hi> an able Chymiſt, who came from <hi>Naples</hi> to <hi>Madrid,</hi> with <hi>Don Pedro de Arragon,</hi> received Orders from the Chief Miniſter to examine the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, which had been cried down ſome Months before, in order to ſeparate the Silver from the Braſs. It was pretended, that the King by this means would get Six Millions of Peices of Eight, and that he would employ them to ſend conſiderable Forces to Sea; for the Pope was willing that the Money which was to be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by the Bulls of the <hi>Craſade,</hi> ſhould be laid out to equip a Fleet, to make War againſt the <hi>Corſairs</hi> of <hi>Barbary.</hi> At the ſame time they were apprehenſive, that the Veſſels ſent to the <hi>Indies</hi> had ſuffered Ship-wrack, becauſe they had received Advice, that one of them arrived
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0148502702:133"/>
very much ſhattered at <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> and they could not hear any News of the reſt. Although it is the Cuſtom of <hi>Spain</hi> for the King to dine with the Knights of the Golden-Fleece on St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s day, his Majeſty diſpenſed with it, to take the diverſion of Hunting. As he came back from <hi>Prado,</hi> towards the Evening, the two Queens went out to meet him, and conducted him to the Admiral of <hi>Caſtile</hi>'s Houſe, where they had paſſed the time ever ſince Noon. This Nobleman, who was always generous and magnificent, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that he was to receive this Honour, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Baſons of ſeveral Fountains to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed with large Silver-Pots, filled with all manner of Victuals, Flowers and Fruits as the Seaſon produced, and the diverſity joyned to the Order had a very agreeable effect upon the Eye. In all the Summer-houſes which terminated the Walks, there were little Tables ſet out with pieces of Cryſtal, Agate, Cornelian, and Tapiſtry of Gold and Vermilion, having all ſorts of things in Baſons, after the ſame manner as the Tables had. He got all ſorts of Fruit counterfeited, particularly of Grapes which hung with their Leaves and Branches in the <hi>Grottas</hi>; they were compoſed chiefly of little Carbuncles of a Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granate colour, Topazes, and Amethyſts, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could look finer or prettier. The two Queens received a mighty ſatisfaction at this Walk. As ſoon as the King was arrived, they went into the Houſe, where Fifteen Ladies and as many Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers immediately appeared, dreſs'd after the faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Country. The Ladies came at firſt in their Mantles <hi>Tabados,</hi> that is to ſay, all their Face was covered except one Eye. The Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers for their part, wore their Cloaks up to their Noſes, and their Hats over their Eyes: This was a ſort of Masquerade, and to divert their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0148502702:134"/>
they talked with their Fingers, and by Signs for ſome time, with all the ſeveral turns and geſtures that are uſed in this kind of dumb Converſation: Afterwards the Ladies quitted their Mantles, and the Lords their Cloaks, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to dance a Saraband after the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> faſhion, holding one another with Taffata-Skarfs of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent colours, and quitting them ſometimes to carry Flambeaus in their Hands. The Women wore little Caps on their Heads, covered with Plumes that were raiſed upon the fides very high. When the Saraband was finiſhed, the Ladies kiſſed the Queen's Hand, and the Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers the King's; their Majeſties were pleaſed to declare, that they were extremely ſatisfied with this pretty Entertainment. The Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> and the Conſtable of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> knowing what Honour the King had done the Admiral, deſired him that he would condeſcend to come and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert himſelf at their Houſes, whither he went along with the two Queens. There were Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies there; and Artificial Fire-works, and a noble Collation: They omitted nothing that might teſtifie their Joy upon this Occaſion, and their acknowledgment of ſo great a Favour.</p>
            <p>On the ſecond of <hi>December</hi> the King demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſupply of Money of all the Councils, and a Hundred thouſand Pieces of Eight of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Italy.</hi> He propoſed to ſell ſome Places to raiſe this Summ, becauſe it was impoſſible to be raiſed any other way.</p>
            <p>The King being informed, that abundance of People died of ſeveral Diſtempers at <hi>Port St. Mary,</hi> which were chiefly occaſioned by the great ſcarcity of Proviſions, told the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> that ſome way or other muſt be found out to remedy theſe Miſeries, and that he could not endure to hear any more talk of them; that they
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0148502702:135"/>
had been of a long ſtanding, which made him inclined to believe that all this proceeded from meer negligence. The Duke replied, that he would not loſe one moment to redreſs them, and that if his Life would do the People any good, he was free to ſacrifice it. He went home very melancholy, and having retired into his Cloſet with his Dutcheſs, <hi>I have a great deſire,</hi> ſays he to her, <hi>to abondon every thing, I ſlave and kill my ſelf here with buſineſs, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, meet with nothing but Reproaches for my Pains. When you have once brought things into a good Condition,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>you may quit them if you pleaſe; but if you leave them at preſent, all the World will conclude that it is through weakneſs.</hi> She added ſo many reaſons to theſe, that ſhe made him take Courage again, although he was mightily dejected. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>de Priego,</hi> his Son-in-law being come to <hi>Madrid</hi> to ſee him, as he entred the Room, hit himſelf a little blow on the Temples againſt the edge of a Cabinet; he was immediately ſeized with a bleeding at the Noſe, and died of it in a ſhort time after.</p>
            <p>Our Ambaſſador prevailed with the King to give his conſent to appoint a Judge <hi>Conſervator,</hi> whoſe only buſineſs ſhould be to look after all Affairs relating to the <hi>French</hi> Nation.</p>
            <p>The buſineſs was decided at laſt at <hi>Madrid,</hi> in favour of Conſtable <hi>Colonna,</hi> upon the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence he had with the <hi>Roman</hi> Knights, Subjects to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> about the Priority they pretended to diſpute with him in the <hi>Cavalcade,</hi> which is every Year performed to preſent the the Pope with a white Mare, and a common Schedule for the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> which the King of <hi>Spain</hi> holds in fief of the Holy See. His Catholick Majeſty's Council had delay'd to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0148502702:136"/>
this Affair ever ſince the year 1668. When the <hi>Roman</hi> Barons perceived, that it was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in favour of them, they ſearched new occaſions to get the Sentence revoked; and to ſucceed in their deſigns, they united themſelves with the Heads of the Papal Families, to write all of them together to <hi>Madrid</hi> about the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: When the King was told of it, he only an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>What is judged is judged.</hi> The Marqueſs <hi>de Liche,</hi> Ambaſſador from <hi>Spain</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> fell ſick; he ſent immediately for the Pope's Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an to come to him, and when his Friends demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of him why he choſe him before his own, <hi>I am ſo weary of my Life,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that I purpoſely ſend for one, who will ſooneſt kill me, if it were only to pleaſe his Maſter. The Pope being inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of this Anſwer, ſent one of the Gentlemen of his Chamber to viſit him, and ordered him to tell the Marqueſs, that he deſired his Health as much as he did his Abſence, and by that judge whether he wiſhed his recovery or no.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About the beginning of <hi>December</hi> there was a great Earthquake in the Province of <hi>Salerne,</hi> as alſo at <hi>Naples,</hi> and the Places about it, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it did no damage. It was commonly ſaid at <hi>Madrid,</hi> that the Queen-Mother had engaged the King to nominate Cardinal <hi>Nitard</hi> to be Vice-Roy of <hi>Naples,</hi> and that ſhe hoped in a ſhort time to ſee her two Favourites with her. The Cardinal was the firſt, and the Marqueſs <hi>de Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenzuela</hi> the ſecond. The Marqueſs <hi>de los Velez,</hi> who had no deſire to quit his place, ſent the King (in order to fix himſelf in his good Graces) a ſtately Coach of admirable Sculpture, and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered all over moſt delicately. But although the King had ſo many fine Coaches by him, I never ſaw him in any of them; he juſt caſt his Eyes upon them, and then they were ſhut up in a
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0148502702:137"/>
Coach houſe, where time and the duſt abſolutely ſpoiled them; the King rather loves to ride in great Coaches of Green Linnen waxed over, made after the ſame faſhion with ours, and which a ſimple Citizen of <hi>Paris</hi> would not vouchſafe to go in. The Marquiſs <hi>de los Velez</hi> ſent him likewiſe ſome <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Horſes, but ſo finely ſhaped, that nothing certainly ever came near them.</p>
            <p>Few days paſſed wherein the King and Queen did not go a hunting, or elſe to ſee a Play; they went to <hi>Buen Retiro</hi> to behold ſome <hi>Dutchmen</hi> skate upon the Ice after the faſhion of their Country. Some Ladies ſent to acquaint the Queen, that if her Majeſty would permit them to appear masked, becauſe they had no mind to be known; they would ſhow her better ſport than ſhe had hitherto ſeen. They were told that they might come if they pleaſed, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately they went upon the Ice in ſhort Petticoats, fine Shooes and Stockings, and Pattins after the <hi>Dutch</hi> manner; they danced a Saraband with Caſtanets to admiration, moving as nimbly as the Dance would allow them; but the Ice not being equally thick in all places, broke under one of them, and let her fall into the Water, where ſhe had certainly been drowned, if People had not come to her help immediately. Having loſt her Mask by this Mischance, they ſaw ſhe was a very deformed old Woman, who was near Threeſcore Years old. When the Queen was told of it, ſhe ſmiled and anſwered, <hi>That at that Age it was lawful for any one to go masked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The two Queens on St. <hi>Nicholas</hi>'s day made a Preſent of precious Stones to the Dutcheſs <hi>d'Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buquerque,</hi> becauſe it was her Birthday. She offered them in way of return, ſome Curioſities of great Value, and particularly a Prayer-book
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0148502702:138"/>
to the young Queen, which was incomparably well Painted, with golden Claſps, and adorned with Diamonds. It being now towards the end of the Year, I went (according to Cuſtom) to wiſh her Majeſty a happy <hi>New Year</hi>; ſhe was dreſs'd in a ſlight Stuff of White Wool, and had a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious quantity of large Pearls about her; ſhe ſat near a great Veſſel full of Olive ſtones, and turning over the the Leaves of the Prayer-book which the Dutcheſs <hi>d'Albuquerque</hi> had given her, did me the honour to ſhew it me. <hi>See,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>here are</hi> Henry <hi>the Fourth, and</hi> Mary de Medicis <hi>on their Knees, ſtretching out their Arms in their Oratory; it is certain that this Book was made for one of them. I was deſirous to know by what accident it came into</hi> Spain<hi>, and told her that perhaps Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>brought it thither.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ſhe called for the Dutcheſs <hi>d'Albuquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que,</hi> and asked her how ſhe came by it. The Dutcheſs told her ſhe could not tell, but only that ſhe had received it of her Mother. The Queen ſaid to me afterwards, <hi>Are you not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized to find me dreſs'd in White Woollen? 'Tis a ſmall ſort of Devotion which the King and I perform, but no body ſhall know the reaſon of it. Ah Madam, reply'd the Dutcheſs</hi> de Paſtrane<hi>, we all of us take the liberty to divine. How ſays the Queen, without miſtaking? No, I am not poſitive ſays the Dutcheſs. And for you, ſaid ſhe to me, have you gueſs'd at the true cauſe? Yes, Madam, very eaſily, reply'd I, and all</hi> Spain <hi>joyns its Vows with yours. Don't you know, ſays the Queen ſmiling, that this is none of the beſt Places in the World to play the Sorcereſs in, and that we have a horrible Inquiſition here? The King entred the Room at that moment, ſo the Queen riſing up, told him with a chearful Air, that ſhe had two Sorcereſſes to ſhew him; and that the</hi>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:0148502702:139"/>
               <hi>Dutcheſs</hi> de Paſtrane <hi>and I had divined the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of her white Habit.</hi> The King, although in all appearance he ſeemed to be in a good Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, he looked ſo angrily upon us, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly upon my ſelf, whom he knew to be a <hi>French-Woman,</hi> that I made a profound Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; and went immediately out of the Queen's Apartment.</p>
            <p>An Order was here publiſhed to raiſe the price of Money, which was reduced to a fourth part of its value.</p>
            <p>Although the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> was indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, yet he did not neglect to inform himſelf diligently of every thing that happened, and he was not a little troubled to hear that the Plague began to rage again at <hi>Port St. Mary.</hi> The Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and Poverty of this Country was ſo extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly great, that ſeveral Perſons died daily for want; and the Duke <hi>de Medina Cidonia</hi> was obliged to ſend Corn from <hi>Andaluzia</hi> thither. The Miſery was not leſs at <hi>Naples.</hi> The Pope's Nuncio, by his Holineſs's Order, Summoned the Superiours of all the Regular Houſes hither, to oblige them to give the City ſome Relief in Corn.</p>
            <p>They granted two in an hundred of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, and it was hoped that what with this Money, and what with the Charities they drew from private Perſons, they would remedy theſe preſſing Neceſſities: But after ſome time, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Caracchioli,</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Naples,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the Marqueſs <hi>de les Velez,</hi> by his Vicar General, that the Pope would not ſuffer the Tax of two in the hundred to be raiſed any longer upon the Eccleſiaſtical Revenues. Thus the Vice-Roy found himſelf diſapponited in his deſigns of raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Two hundred thouſand Crowns, which were to be laid out in Corn, and likewiſe a more conſiderable Sum that was to be ſent to <hi>Madrid.</hi>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:0148502702:140"/>
To augment the Diſorder, which was already great enough, the price of Gold-Money dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed daily in the Dutchy of <hi>Bari,</hi> which total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hindred all Commerce in the greateſt part of the Kingdom. On the 16<hi>th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> they made a Proceſſion at <hi>Naples,</hi> which is duly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed every Year, to thank God for preſerving this City from the Flames of the Mountain <hi>Veſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius.</hi> The Body and Blood of St. <hi>Januarius,</hi> one of the Protectors of <hi>Naples,</hi> was carried about in this Proceſſion.</p>
            <p>The King was troubled with an Ague for a few days towards the beginning of <hi>January</hi> 1681. It is impoſſible for any one to ſhew the aſſiduity that the young Queen made appear during the little time his Indiſpoſition laſted. Two Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were acted at Court to divert his Majeſty after his Recovery. On one of theſe days, the King having prohibited all Perſons, without exception, to ſit upon the Theatre; the Duke <hi>d'Oſſone</hi> pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced himſelf there upon a heap of Cuſhions, and would not depart. The King took no notice of it during the Play, but as ſoon as it was over, he ſent an order to him, to come no more to Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil or to Court. He was not in the leaſt pitied, ſince he had voluntarily drawn this Misfortune upon himſelf, and becauſe it was neceſſary to mortifie him a little. But what principally occaſioned the King's Severity is, that he had obſerved in his Journey to the <hi>Eſcurial,</hi> that the Duke, who was Maſter of the Horſe to the Queen, did not follow the Court thither. A little after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, he ſent him word, that he expected him to wait more diligently for the future: The Duke took no notice of this Advice, and as he was one of the haughtieſt Men in the World, affected a certain negligence in the diſcharge of his Office, which obliged the King to acquaint him by a
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0148502702:141"/>
Note from the Secretary of State, that if he did not behave himſelf better for the time to come, he would diſpoſe of his Place to ſome body elſe. He might eaſily have judged from this, that the King had his Eye fixed upon him, and at leaſt ought to have taken care of himſelf for ſome time; but his Natural haughtineſs would not ſuffer him to comply with this conſtraint.</p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> did not paſs all his moments with content; he was envied for the high Poſt he enjoyed, and <hi>d'Eguya</hi> was mortally hated: Both of them had powerful Enemies, and amongſt theſe were reckoned the Duke <hi>de Paſtrane,</hi> and his two Brothers, the Admiral of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> the Prince <hi>de Stillano,</hi> the Count <hi>de Monterey,</hi> the Count <hi>d'Oropeza,</hi> and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>de Manſera.</hi> They frequently met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and made ſevere Reflections upon the unequal Conduct of the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi:</hi> They obſerved that he was too irreſolute when there was an occaſion for conſtancy; too lazy when he ought to be diligent; and too poſitive, when he was juſtly and reaſonably oppoſed. They examined the preſent State of the Kingdom, the Miſery of the People, and the little appearances there were that he would redreſs them. They propoſed Expedients to remedy all theſe Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and likewiſe to prevent thoſe that might happen; but as it was not the Publick Good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone that made them thus inquiſitive, but their Private Intereſt animated them, they took all of them different Meaſures to attain the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ends they propoſed to themſelves. It is true indeed, they all concurred in the deſtruction of the Chief Miniſter, but when he was removed out of the way, every one was deſirous to make the beſt Advantages for himſelf; and thus this narrow Spirit of Self-Intereſt which was ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0148502702:142"/>
in their Cabals, hindred them from uniting with that ſincerity, that makes great Affairs ſucceed happily.</p>
            <p>Amongſt theſe Noblemen, the Admiral was moſt forward to deſire an Alteration: He had not forgot the ſweetneſs he had taſted in that ſhort interval, when the Marqueſs <hi>de Valenzuela</hi> was the Queen-Mother's Favourite: The remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of that Golden Time made him deſirous of another like it; for though he was a Perſon of a great Eſtate, yet his Expences were ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, that if he had been a great deal rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, he would have been always in Debt. He deſired therefore to contribute what in him lay to the ſetting up of another Miniſter, in order to find his Accounts in it; not that he deſigned to heap up any Money, but to throw it out of the Windows and ſquander it away, if he could but get enough to ſerve ſo. He carefully look'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him to find out a fit and capable Perſon to be advanced to this Honour; and at laſt, the Count <hi>d'Oropeza</hi> ſeemed to be the moſt proper to accompliſh his Deſigns; for he did not doubt but that thoſe particular marks of Eſteem His Majeſty always ſhewed him, would have their effect, in caſe he were ſupported by a powerful Party.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, the Count <hi>de Monterey,</hi> who wanted neither Youth, Wit, nor Ambition, whoſe whole Deportment was agreeable and Court-like, who had been concerned in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of ſeveral Affairs, who was laborious and vigilant, took only reſolute and ſecret Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons into his Party. He had the juſteſt occaſions in the World to be diſpleaſed with the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> and <hi>Don Geronimo d'Eguya</hi> his Mortal Enemy had done him a great deal of wrong before the King. He had painted the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0148502702:143"/>
and Character of this Count in ſuch black co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, that the Young Queen deſigning to do him ſome good Offices, and ſpeaking very advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly of him to his Majeſty, he told her, <hi>That</hi> Monterey <hi>might reckon himſelf happy enough, that he wore his Head upon his Shoulders ſtill.</hi> The Count was ſenſibly diſguſted to ſee the Duke <hi>de Villa Hermoſa,</hi> who had been Governour of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> after him, and who had even ſerved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Orders, made Counſellor of State at his arrival at <hi>Madrid,</hi> and himſelf conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excluded after ſo diſobliging a manner. Beſides this he ſaw that the Marqueſs <hi>de Liche</hi> his Brother was detained at <hi>Rome</hi> againſt his will, although he daily petitioned to be called home. This gave the Count a new occaſion to complain, and made him ſenſible of the ill diſpoſitions they had at Court to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and himſelf. The Marchioneſs <hi>de Liche,</hi> who was Beautiful and Young, threw her ſelf frequently at the King's Feet, to demand of him the return of her Husband, who was continually indiſpoſed at <hi>Rome,</hi> whether it were becauſe the Air did not agree with him, or that his uneaſineſs to be kept there by force, contributed to deſtroy his Health. What makes the caſe harder, is, that ſhe did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to have him come back to <hi>Madrid,</hi> but only that he might have permiſſion to live in any of his Majeſty's Dominions. The greater part of the Counſellors of State were agreed in favour of the Marchioneſs, and her Entreaties had certainly met with ſucceſs, if the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Marqueſs <hi>de Liche</hi> had not taken all Opportunities to confirm the King in the Opinion he had already of him, that he was a Man of the moſt incureable ill Temper in the World, and that it was not poſſible for him
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0148502702:144"/>
to permit him to come home, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding the Peace of all the Court. We may therefore eaſily apprehend, that the Count <hi>de Monterey</hi> had reaſon enough to be angry with the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> and <hi>d'Eguya</hi>; and his Reſentments as well as his Ambition made him paſſionately wiſh to ſee another in the Place, that he might effectually Revenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon the Duke, whom he hated, and might have acceſs enough to the new Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, to be able through his means to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced into the Council of State, and puſh on his own Fortune. He imagined himſelf capable of doing it by his Merits and good Management: But although he might with Juſtice aſpire to the moſt high and difficult Poſts, he was obliged to conceal his Deſires and Intentions; becauſe he found People's Eyes were ſtill upon him, and that ſeveral who made a ſolemn Profeſſion to be his Friends, ſerved only as ſo many Spies to watch him. This conſideration prevailed with him to put that reſtraint upon himſelf, as to live in a ſort of Retirement, and that with ſo much circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, as to diſcover his Deſigns almoſt to no body. Nay, he affected to viſit the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> and having found him one day more eaſie of Acceſs than was uſual with him, he freely declared to him, that it was not without the greateſt Impatience that he beheld the preference the Duke <hi>de Villa Hermoſa</hi> met with, to be made Privy-Counſellor, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf excluded. The Duke anſwered him, that he might expect his turn one day, and upon this ſhewed him ſome Civility, which perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Count to believe, that he had now perhaps a greater kindneſs for him than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly. This Reaſon engaged him to make his
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0148502702:145"/>
Court regularly to him, and to devote himſelf to him, at leaſt in appearance.</p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>de Veraguas,</hi> ſenſible of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front he had received in loſing the Vice-Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of <hi>Valencia,</hi> had no other Motive to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him to think of the removal of the Chief Miniſter, but only an expectation that he who ſucceded him in that Place, would do him more Juſtice, than the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> had done: For although the Duke <hi>de Veraguas</hi> was deſcended of an illuſtrious Family, as being of the Houſe of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and that beſides his Youth, he had a great deal of Merit and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity; yet whatever Importunities he made at Court to be reſtored to his Vice-Royſhip again, he was not able to obtain it. He had received Abſolution privately from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick <hi>Nuncio,</hi> for having ordered the Monk to be executed, who had quitted his Habit, and was made Captain of the <hi>Banditti.</hi> It was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that having now appeaſed the Pope, this would facilitate his re-eſtabliſhment: He daily preſented his Petitions to the Council; he demanded of them, that if he were a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, they would treat him as ſuch, that his Tryal might come one, and that his Head might anſwer for the Faults he had committed; but that if after ſtrict Examination of his Conduct, they found he had ſerved His Majeſty well, they would not deny him the Juſtice that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to the meaneſt Soldier. His Trouble and his Requeſts were always equally unſucceſsful, he found them perverſe and prejudiced againſt him; and ſo by this ill uſage they obliged him to join with the Male contents.</p>
            <p>As for the Duke <hi>de Paſtrane,</hi> he had not in the leaſt been ill uſed at Court, however he thought it ſufficient ill Treatment to be left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0148502702:146"/>
an Employ. His Wife, who was Siſter to the Marqueſs <hi>de Liche</hi> and the Count <hi>de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi> being provoked at what Indignities thoſe of her Family had ſuffered, perſwaded him to uſe all his Efforts to get a new Miniſtery e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed. The Duke <hi>de Paſtrane</hi> voluntarily eſpouſed this Party, and his two Brothers, whom he had made acquainted with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, were reſolved not to ſeparate their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts from his: One of them was named <hi>Don Gaſper,</hi> the other <hi>Don Joſeph de Sylva</hi>; the laſt of theſe had a very great ſhare in the King's Affections, and his Place of Chief Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman-Uſher procured him a great Eſteem and Approbation. He had Married the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Marqueſs <hi>de Manſera</hi>; but theſe three Noblemen were guilty of a great Sole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm in this Affair: For they communicated the matter to <hi>Don Sebaſtian Bibanco,</hi> Secretary of the Chamber, out of a Preſumption that he was of the ſame Opinion with themſelves, but herein they were miſtaken; for he was infinitely more devoted to the Chief Miniſter than to them, and conſequently no ſooner knew any thing of Importance, but he immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcovered it to him.</p>
            <p>The Marqueſs <hi>de Manſera,</hi> Grand Maſter of the Queen-Mother's Houſhold, and her Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, deſired for her ſake as well as his own, to ſee the Government molded into another Form. He was a Man well advanced in Years, whoſe Merit and Experience might with Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice prompt him to believe that he was fit to poſſeſs whatever Place they would aſſign him in the Miniſtery. He deſired a <hi>Juncto</hi> to be erected, that he might be choſen a Member of it: But knowing that his Zeal for the Queen-Mother rendred him ſtrongly ſuſpected, and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0148502702:147"/>
that he ran an extraordinary hazard if he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared for himſelf, he judged it expedient to employ the Marqueſs <hi>de Grana,</hi> who was his Brother-in Law and Confident. So he diſcourſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him about the matter, and poſſeſſed him with a deſire to take all neceſſary meaſures to effect it. The other having nothing to fear by reaſon of his Quality of being Ambaſſador, laboured very diligently in the Affair, while the Marqueſs <hi>de Manſera</hi> expreſſed but a ſmall concern for whatever happened at Court, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it were for the Marqueſs <hi>de Grana</hi>'s Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to contribute to his Advancement. He ſeemed to be of Opinion, that for the Intereſts of the Emperour his Maſter, he was obliged to procure the Proſperity of <hi>Spain,</hi> which languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under an extreme Miſery that extended it ſelf farther than the Limits of that Kingdom: That it was impoſſible for the King to Second the Emperour in any of his Deſigns, as long as the Members of that great Body were declining, and continued under the ill effects of a Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, that made them utterly incapable of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that it was to no purpoſe to make any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals to the Miniſters, becauſe whatever they promiſed him was never executed. All theſe Motives joyned together, excited him to make all poſſible advances to convince the Duke of the Neceſſity he lay under to erect a <hi>Juncto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides this he conſidered that the Marqueſs <hi>de Manſera</hi> wou'd not fail of making one of that number; that he would manage himſelf in the Council according to the Directions he gave him, and that this would be the eaſieſt way for him to ſucceed in all his Enterprizes. He ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd, that the beſt Policy he could uſe to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh theſe Deſigns, would be to uſe none it all, and ſo he addreſſed himſelf immediately
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0148502702:148"/>
to the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi.</hi> He began with commending his Zeal, his Induſtry and Pains, and afterwards paſſing into a more ſtrict Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of every thing, he was deſirous to make him comprehend, <hi>That the Affairs of this Monarchy were reduced to their laſt Period, unleſs he took ſure and ready Methods to remedy them; that he made a Slave of himſelf in vain, ſince it was not poſſible for one ſingle Man to ſuſtain (like another</hi> Atlas<hi>) the weight of ſo many Kingdoms; that</hi> Don Louis de Haro <hi>at a conjuncture of leſs difficulty, had compoſed a Juncto for his own eaſe, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in followed the Example of ſeveral great Miniſters who preceded him; that a Juncto would ſerve to determine Matters under the Authority of the Chief Miniſter, to whom they would carry every thing almoſt digeſted in his Hand, and that by this means, buſineſs would go on cheerfully and ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; that at the preſent time, whatever good Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions were taken, yet they continued without effect, by reaſon of the general Perplexity, which rendred thoſe things difficult that appeared to be very eaſie; that he ought to conſider, that the moſt accompliſhed Genius in the World, without great Preſumption, could never promiſe himſelf to move ſo ponderous a Machine all alone, and that be therefore counſelled him to take ſome Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds, of Experience and Ability ſufficient, to make him repoſe one part of his Affairs upon them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Chief Miniſter reliſhed theſe Reaſons of the Marqueſs <hi>de Grana,</hi> promiſing to weigh the matter with Deliberation, and afterwards, if he ſaw good, to determine himſelf by the Advice he had given him. This gave the Ambaſſador good hopes, that his Viſit would meet with hap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>py ſucceſs; and as he was a Perſon of a great deal of Wit, who knew how to ſet off any thing
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0148502702:149"/>
to the beſt advantage, and ſhow it by the beſt Lights, ſo he did not queſtion but the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> would lay hold of the Expedient, he had diſcovered to him: But the Chief Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter had the weakneſs to diſcourſe <hi>d'Eguya</hi> about them; who did not loſe one moment to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him from this Reſolution. <hi>He repreſented to him, that if he compoſed a Juncto, he went to give himſelf ſo many Tutors; that then he could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide nothing but in concert with them; that he would find himſelf joyned with Noblemen, who were led by their own Paſſions, blinded with their own Intereſts, ſtill purſuing their own Ends, and turning every matter to their own private advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; that notwithſtanding all this, he only muſt reſolve to bear the brunt of all, and that every body having their Eyes fixed upon him would purſue all his Motions ſtep by ſtep; that if any difficult juncture, any misfortune, or unexpected accident ſhould happen, he alone muſt incur the Reproach of it; that the Juncto would never be called in queſtion for ill Events, but that they would all lye at the Chief Miniſter's door; that it was very juſt and natural to think, that if he alone was reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for all Miſcarriages, that then he alone de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to enjoy the Grandeur and Advantages that are annexed to this Place.</hi> He turned the Duke's Inclinations ſo happily by theſe Reaſons, that he reſolved to follow them, notwithſtanding the advice that was given him to the contrary; ſo that when the Marqueſs came to him with Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations to find him continue ſtill in the ſame Sentiments, and ready to put them in Execution, he perceived that he was ſtedfaſt and inflexible in the other Opinion, and that all the Avenues to him were ſhut up and hindred.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Lords who had aſſociated together, to make a League againſt the Duke,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0148502702:150"/>
continued to aſſemble in private, and to debate of the Expedients that were to be taken to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the King of the neceſſity there was to chuſe another Miniſter, or at leaſt to erect a Juncto; but the greateſt part of their time was generally ſpent in making long Politick Diſcourſes, and theſe ſame Politicks hindred them ſo, that none of them offered to put himſelf at the head of the Party. When the Queſtion was about ſetting up a Chief, every one ſtood looking upon his Neighbour; they wanted that Amity and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in one another, which is neceſſary to cement theſe Deſigns; and he that merited the greateſt eſteem, was ſure to find the leaſt Friendſhip from the reſt. Envy reigned amongſt them, Sincerity was not obſerved; and when their Society was examined, there was nothing but Vanity and Weakneſs to be found at the bottom.</p>
            <p>Amongſt thoſe who were moſt ſenſible of the ill management that was to be found in this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal, the Admiral of <hi>Caſtile</hi> was one of the firſt. He eaſily diſcovered all the defects of the Party, and found it was nonſence to be longer engaged in it; ſince the Bow was not drawn high enough to ſend the Arrow to the Butt. He was aſſured, that the deſign would be diſcovered, and that then he ſhould find himſelf very finely ruined; that ſuppoſing it ſucceeded, and a Juncto was ſet up, the Marqueſs <hi>de Liche</hi> would in all probability be made a Member of it, and for his part, rather than that ſhould happen, he would chuſe to go to Hell, becauſe he bore ſuch an implacable ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to him. This only <hi>Idea,</hi> that now he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to procure an Advantage for the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs, turned his Inclinations abſolutely from the Society into which he was entred: In fine, after abundance of Reflections he totally abandoned it, and ſeveral People were ſtrongly perſwaded that
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0148502702:151"/>
he was not content to quit it, but that he went to the King, and acquainted him with the moſt minute Particulars of what had paſſed there; nay, that he gave the ſame Advice to the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt Victm the Duke ſacrificed to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments, was the Count <hi>de Montery,</hi> whether it were becauſe his Indignation were the more violent againſt him, by reaſon of the Friendſhip he always pretended to him, and now had viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; or becauſe he feared him more than any of the reſt: So that notwithſtanding the great ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity he imagined himſelf to be in for his circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect Conduct, the Preſident of <hi>Caſtile</hi> ſent him word, that he had ſomething to ſay to him, and therefore muſt ſee him that Evening at Court, (for it muſt be obſerved by the way, that the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of <hi>Caſtile</hi> never go to make any Viſits.) The Count was very glad to have this Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to diſcourſe him, having ſome Affairs to ſpeak with him about, wherein he was concerned. But his Joy laſted but a ſhort time, for the Preſident gave him an Order contained in a Billet from the King, and ſigned by <hi>Don Geronimo d'Eguya,</hi> wherein it was ſpecified, that he muſt inſtantly retire to one of his Country-Houſes. He conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſurpriſed for ſome time, and told the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, he was ready to obey it; but that being a Grandee of <hi>Spain,</hi> he demanded an Order ſigned by the King's own Hand, ſince it was the Cuſtom, and that while he tarried for it, he would go to put his Affairs in order. In ſhort, he returned to his own Houſe extremely concerned, and got his Equipage made ready, not at all doubting but that the Order would be ſent ſuddenly to him. He received it next day, which was the 15<hi>th</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> accompanied with a Permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to tarry three days longer in <hi>Madrid.</hi> He
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0148502702:152"/>
paſſed them there amongſt ſome of his Friends, and afterwards parted for <hi>Salamanca.</hi> Few Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple pitied his caſe, becauſe he was generally envied; and when Fortune leaves a Man, few of his Friends have Generoſity enough to declare themſelves in favour of him, or to eſpouſe his Cauſe. He was the firſt Perſon whom the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> treated ill, and 'tis believed he had not made him ſerve as an Example for the reſt, if <hi>d'Eguya</hi> by his violent Courſes had not ſowred that peaceable and ſweet Diſpoſition that was ſo natural to the Chief Miniſter; for he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed him to puniſh the Count immediately, to be a warning to others; and he was baniſhed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe he was not agreeable to <hi>d'Eguya,</hi> and had too much Merit, than becauſe he was an Enemy to the Duke. The Queen-Mother ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly rejoyced at it, but could not ſo well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal her ſatisfaction, but that it was evidently perceived. The Count had quitted her Party in <hi>Don Juan</hi>'s time, and 'tis very well known, that he had ſeveral preſſing Obligations upon him to have uſed her after another manner; for if he had been willing to have made the beſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of his Fortune, ſhe had preferred him to <hi>Valenzuela,</hi> and intruſted him with the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her Affairs. He had at leaſt as many good Qualities as the other could pretend to, and was of an illuſtrious Extraction, but being a young Man he neglected the advances the Queen-Mother made towards him. A certain Perſon, who knew the whole Proceedings very well, told me that Father <hi>Nitard</hi> was ſcarce gone out of <hi>Spain,</hi> when ſhe began to caſt her Eyes upon him, intending to honour him with her Confidence. On the Feſtival of St. <hi>Iſidore,</hi> who is the Patron of <hi>Madrid,</hi> and on which day a Bull-feaſt was cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated at the Expence of the City, the Queen-Mother
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0148502702:153"/>
asked the Count, whether he deſigned to Combat the Bulls; he told her no, unleſs her Majeſty would be pleaſed to order him. <hi>No,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>I will by no means Command you to do it, but is there ne'r a Lady here in Court, who has laid any ſuch Commands upon you? If any of them had,</hi> replied he, <hi>your Majeſty might well imagine, that I would not fail to give her this mark of my Obedience.</hi> The Queen cried out Jeſus, Jeſus, Count! Will you expoſe your Life thus? A few days after this, ſhe let a Paper drop out of her Hands, as he was giving her an account of ſome Affairs ſhe had intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with; he took it up, and kneeling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one Knee, preſented it to her. <hi>Perhaps,</hi> ſays the Queen, <hi>you believe it is a Paper of Importance, come I'll leave you to judge of that your ſelf, open it.</hi> The Count found the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eſtoy toda la noche deſpierta ſola, triſte, y de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeando: Mis penas ſon Martirios, mis Martiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os ſon guſtos.</hi> That is to ſay, <hi>I paſs all the Night without ſleeping, alone, penſive, and forming de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to my ſelf: My Pain is a Martyrdom, but my Martyrdom is a Pleaſure.</hi> The Count read theſe Words with ſo careleſs an Air, that the Queen who obſerved it, ſnatched the Paper out of his Hand, and ſaid to him, go you inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſay your <hi>Domine non ſum dignus.</hi> The Count was ſenſible of his Fault, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to repair it, but it ſucceeded a great deal worſe with him. The Queen-Mother did not doubt but that he had ſome other Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he preferred to his Fortune; ſhe informed her ſelf of his Conduct, and at laſt knew that he was deſperately in love with the Dutcheſs <hi>de Monteleon.</hi> This was a young Widow, Beautiful and agreeable, but the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0148502702:154"/>
Queen prohibited her to come to Court. The Dutcheſs <hi>de Terra Nova</hi> her Mother, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely diſguſted at it, and this was the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion why ſhe diſengaged her ſelf from the Intereſts of the Queen-Mother, and joyned with <hi>Don Juan</hi>'s Faction. In the mean time the Queen continued ſtill enraged at the Procedure of the Count <hi>de Monterey</hi>; ſo that paſſing from the Extremity of Love to that of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, ſhe gave him during the remainder of her Regency, all the Mortifications ſhe could think of.</p>
            <p>Moſt People were diſpleaſed with the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and call'd him nothing but falſe Brother, and falſe Friend. Nevertheleſs he would have it received for a certain Truth, that he never had any Intention to make the leaſt Diſcoveries; but that the King having ſent for him, told him, that upon condition he would deal fairly and honeſtly by him, he would forgive him: Whereas on the contrary, if he went about to excuſe himſelf, he was certainly undone; that he knew every thing that had paſſed, even to the leaſt Circumſtance, that the Declaration he demanded of him was rather to know his Heart, than to draw any new Lights from him; that when he would have denied every thing, the King preſſed him more earneſtly than before: So that upon that Score, he reſolved to diſcover what related per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally to himſelf, but that he had avoided as much as was poſſible to ſpeak of his Friends. To ſay the Truth, whether he really excuſed the Prince <hi>de Stillano,</hi> or the Court looked upon him to have made but an inconſiderable Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure amongſt the Party, the Chief Miniſter did not make him feel the Effects of his Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnation. It is indeed as certain, that his Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0148502702:155"/>
preceded his Fault, and that having already loſt his Place of being Preſident of the Council of <hi>Planders,</hi> which was beſtowed upon the Count <hi>de Monterey,</hi> he had ſome Juſtice on his ſide to expect that they would ſuffer him to live in quiet.</p>
            <p>The Baniſhment of the Count <hi>de Monterey</hi> ſo terribly affrighted the Duke <hi>de Paſtrane</hi> his Brother-in-Law, that he thought of nothing elſe but how to get handſomly out of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue: He followed the Admiral's Steps, that is to ſay, he readily diſcovered whatever he knew of this affair, that he might better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the King of his Sincerity and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Secretary <hi>Vibanco,</hi> to whom he opened himſelf, had already diſcovered the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance; but in fine, he came ſoon enough to be favourably received: His two Brothers, who were concerned in the ſame Cabal, imitated his Example, in reconciling themſelves to the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> and they ſeemed in all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to embrace his Intereſts, with greater Zeal than any of his beſt and oldeſt Friends. Nevertheleſs, the Duke <hi>de Paſtrane</hi> and his two Brothers could not forbear to be a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle troubled, for being looked upon by the World as timerous Perſons, who had only made theſe diſcoveries out of Weakneſs and Irreſolution: This Reaſon obliged them to uſe all imaginable means to make it be believed that they had told the King nothing; but that having had the Misfortune to communicate their Deſigns to <hi>Vibanco,</hi> he had Sacrificed his Friendſhip to make his Court at their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence; that the King had him ready to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce as a Witneſs againſt them; that he had ſeverely threatned them, and affixed their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don only to their Sincerity; that they could
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0148502702:156"/>
not poſſibly avoid the doing of this at a Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, when they ſhould otherwiſe have deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves without ſaving any Body elſe; and that if it had not been for theſe unhappy Circumſtances, they had never been capable of doing this Injury to their Friends. People hearkned to them, but gave no Credit to their words; nay, ſeveral of their Friends reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them very frankly for ſhewing ſo little Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Conſtancy upon this Occaſion.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the Duke <hi>de Veraguas</hi> had eſcaped as well as the Prince <hi>de Stillano,</hi> and the loſs of his Vice-Royſhip had prevented the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they pretended he deſerved, for join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to a Party againſt the Chief Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter: But he was impatient to be reſtored to his former Dignity, and continually demanded Juſtice at their Hands; he filled all his Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with Complaints, and loudly vented them againſt the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi>; beſides this, he earneſtly importun'd the King to aſſign him ſome Judges; before whom he might Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his Conduct in condemning the relapſed Monk, who had betaken himſelf to the <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditti.</hi> So at laſt he was ſent to the Council of <hi>Arragon,</hi> where he demanded to be re eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as a piece of Juſtice that could not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him, and purſued this Affair with all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Vigour and Heat: But on the third of <hi>February</hi> he received an Order to withdraw preſently to his Eſtate in <hi>Andaluzia.</hi> He beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged leave to go to any other place, becauſe the Plague raged violently in that Province; but it was refuſed him, and he had only eight Hours to prepare for his Departure. One may ſay, it was only the ill Fortune of the Duke <hi>de Veraguas</hi> that procured him all the ill uſage he met upon the account of his Vice-Royſhip:
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0148502702:157"/>
For it is a certain truth, that if there were a Law to treat all People after the ſame manner, who fail in their Duty; abundance of Perſons had been ſeverely puniſhed, who were now gratified and encouraged for their Pains: But His Majeſty was ſo exceedingly prejudiced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, that one Evening when the Queen was demanding of him, whether it were true, that the Duke <hi>de Veraguas</hi> was Baniſhed: He anſwered, <hi>Yes, and that all thoſe ſhould be treated in the ſame kind who talked impertinently.</hi> This was ſufficient to make the Queen know how his Inclinations ſtood, and as ſhe was very pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, ſhe took care to change the Diſcourſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately.</p>
            <p>It was now ſenſibly perceived at Court, that the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> and <hi>Don Geronimo d'Eguya</hi> oppoſed the Queen-Mother in every thing, but the true Occaſion was not poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known. One day when the Marchioneſs <hi>de Mortare</hi> came to Viſit us, we ſpoke to her concerning it; and as ſhe was particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the whole matter, and repoſed a greater Confidence in us than in the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> becauſe we had no Intereſts to take, in this Affair: She acquainted us, That ſome time before the King went to the <hi>Eſcurial, d'Eguya</hi> going to find out the Queen-Mother, to ſhew her a certain Letter which the Marqueſs <hi>de Liche,</hi> Ambaſſador at <hi>Rome,</hi> had ſent to the King: When he was come into her Cloſet, looked for it in his Letter Bag to no purpoſe. He then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred himſelf, that he had locked it up in his <hi>Scritore,</hi> where he had ſeveral other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, which he had no mind any body ſhould ſee; and ſent a little Page for it, who could not read. The poor Boy took the firſt Letter he found there, and wrapped it up in a Sheet of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0148502702:158"/>
white Paper, as he had every day ſeen his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter do the ſame, when he carried his Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the King.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Geronimo d'Eguya</hi> tarried all this while with the Queen-Mother, and as ſoon as the Boy brought him the Letter, without taking it out of the Paper, delivered it to her. It was now towards Evening, and the Queen went to the Window to read it more conveniently: She was immediately ſurprized to find it was not Marqueſs <hi>de Liche</hi>'s Hand, but that of <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Lucinda Bucados</hi> (who was of the Houſe <hi>de Barcelona</hi>) one of her Maids of Honour, who was a very Beautiful Lady, and extremely lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by <hi>d'Eguya.</hi> The Letter was writ with a great deal of Freedom, and ſignified to him, that he had no reaſon to apprehend that the Queen her Miſtreſs would cenſure their Amours. She gave him ſeveral Reaſons for it, that highly reflected on the Queen's Reputation. After ſhe had read it over, ſhe impoſed that conſtraint up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her ſelf, as to conceal her Indignation for that time, and only told <hi>d'Eguya,</hi> that ſhe muſt Diſcourſe the King about what the Ambaſſador had written to him. As ſoon as he was gone, ſhe ſent for <hi>Donna Lucinda,</hi> and after ſhe had reproached her for her Ingratitude and Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ſhe cauſed her to be privately locked up in a little Chamber well grated and barr'd up, and kept the Key of it her ſelf. Here the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate <hi>Lucinda</hi> was forced to lye upon a ſorry Matt, having nothing but Bread and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſuſtain her, and the Queen-Mother fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ordered her to undergo the Penance of a Diſcipline. They told thoſe that enquired after her, that ſhe was ſick of the Small-Pox, that the Queen had ordered her to be remov'd out of the Palace, and that ſhe was dangerouſly ill.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:0148502702:159"/>
               <hi>Don Geronimo d'Eguya</hi> believ'd the News, and was almoſt deſperate for two days; but having open'd his <hi>Scritore,</hi> to take out ſomething or other, he was exceedingly ſurpriſed to find the Marqueſs <hi>de Liche</hi>'s Letter there, which he thought he had left in the Hands of the Queen-Mother: He ſearch'd immediately for that of <hi>Donna Lucinda,</hi> and not finding it, he ſoon concluded where the fatal Error was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; ſo he ran in all haſte to the Queen-Mother's Apartment, caſt himſelf at her Feet, conjur'd her to forgive <hi>Lucinda,</hi> to conſider her Youth, her Birth, and the humble tender Intreaties he made in her behalf; but he found the Queen Inflexible. Seeing at laſt that he was not able to move her, he told her he knew a way how to revenge himſelf upon her. She asked him what it was? He replied, that he would hinder <hi>Valenzuela</hi> from ever coming back again; and that ſhe ſhould behold him no more. The Queen very much enrag'd at this Anſwer, told him, that ſhe was ſenſible enough of the Ill-will he bore her, but that ſhe did not fear the Effects of it; that it was a long time ſince ſhe had loſt <hi>Valenzuela,</hi> who was indeed one of the beſt Servants ſhe ever had, but that ſhe was now accuſtomed to bear his Abſence. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſhe added theſe words, looking earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon him, <hi>I would adviſe you for your own ſake to hinder his Return, for if ever he comes to know that ſuch a Fellow as you had the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to diſpleaſe me, he would tear you in pieces as a Lion does a She-Goat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>D'Eguya</hi> poſſeſſed with Rage, took the firſt favourable Opportunity to ſpeak to the King in prejudice of <hi>Valenzuela</hi>; <hi>He repreſented to him, That he was a bold intriguing Man; that if the Queen had him with her, they two would</hi>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:0148502702:160"/>
               <hi>raiſe Factions together, in which they would engage all the turbulent Spirits in the Kingdom; that by this means they would diſturb the Tranquillity he now enjoyed; that the Queen ſtill regretted the Time and Authority of the Regency; that it was dangerous to ſhew Favours to any of thoſe Perſons, who had been her Creatures of old.</hi> In a word, he ſo well managed the King upon this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he bid him iſſue out an Order, ſuch as he judged convenient, to hinder the coming back of the unfortunate <hi>Valenzuela. D'Eguya</hi> loſt no time about it, and the ſubſtance of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was, That if they met him upon the Sea, in his Return to <hi>Spain,</hi> they ſhould take him out of the Veſſel where he was, and re-em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark him in that which brought the Order, and ſo carry him to <hi>Cartagena</hi> in the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi> The Queen-Mother for her part ſent away <hi>Donna Lucinda</hi> in private, with Orders to Ship her at the <hi>Groyn,</hi> and to Tranſport her to <hi>Flanders,</hi> where ſhe had ſent word to Prince <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Parma,</hi> to get her ſhut up in a Nunnery. But <hi>Don Geronimo d'Eguya</hi> having found means to acquaint himſelf of what had happened, diſpatched an Order of the Chief Miniſter to the <hi>Groyne,</hi> to bring <hi>Donna Lucinda</hi> back to one of her Relations, who had agreed to take care of her.</p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> eſpouſed <hi>d'Eguya</hi>'s ſide in this Diſpute with a mighty heat. The Affair blew over at Court without any noiſe or buſtle: As for the Queen-Mother, ſhe ſpoke nothing at all of it; becauſe it had then been neceſſary to produce <hi>Lucinda</hi>'s Letter, which was by no means convenient to be ſhewn, for the ſeveral fierce and diſreſpectful things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it. On the other hand, <hi>d'Eguya</hi> had no Temptation to ſpeak of it; for being Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0148502702:161"/>
of State, and under an Obligation to preſerve his <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gravity, he was not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to diſcover his Amorous Weakneſſes to the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>D'Eguya,</hi> who was the ſole cauſe of the ill underſtanding between the Queen-Mother and the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> uſed all his Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to encreaſe it ſtill, and in order to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh his deſigns, alarm'd the Duke perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually with all that he had reaſon to apprehend from the Reſentments and Indignation of that Princeſs. What he whiſpered to him, ſerved to exaſperate the Chief Miniſter more and more againſt her, and this made him keep a fair Correſpondence with her no longer. He conſidered with himſelf, that he ſtood firm in the King's Affection, and that the Father Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor and <hi>d'Eguya,</hi> who had more frequent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions to diſcourſe his Majeſty than he had, would take care to confirm him in all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Diſpoſitions he had for the Duke. This Triumvirate began at the ſame time to ſow the Seeds of Diſcord between the King and the Queen-Mother. No body durſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the King with the Reaſons that inclined them to act ſo violently; they had ſeen after what manner the Chief Miniſter had treated thoſe Perſons who were not of his ſide, and they had no Mind to draw down his Anger upon themſelves. The great Officers belonging to the King's Houſhold ſeemed to depend en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely upon him; the Gentlemen of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, who waited every day in their turn, pay'd no leſs abject Submiſſion to the Favourite; and thoſe who had Sincerity enough to ſpeak, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Injury they might hereby do themſelves, left the Province of better informing the King to ſome body elſe, who had more Zeal,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0148502702:162"/>
and leſs Policy: So that the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi, d'Eguya,</hi> and the Confeſſor, finding a clear Field, gave his Majeſty what Ill Impreſſions they pleaſed, in relation to the Queen-Mother; they aſſured him that nothing in the World could make her forget the Troubles and ill uſage ſhe had found when <hi>Don Juan</hi> governed all; that although ſhe had reaſon enough to believe, that when that Miniſter treated her ſo rudely, he acted only by himſelf; yet it was certainly true, that all was done under the Name and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the King; that therefore ſhe would always remember, it was he that abetted the Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhe had ſuffered; and that he ought to conſider, that it was by no means ſafe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any Confidence in a reconciled Enemy. The natural goodneſs of the King, and the Reſpect he had for the Queen his Mother, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him from being abſolutely influenced by the pernicious Counſels they gave him; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they prevailed ſo far upon him as to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him jealous, and conſequently cold and reſerved to her. She eaſily perceived it, and was well informed of all their Deſigns, but whether ſhe judged it was by no means a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per time to endeavour the Deſtruction of her Enemies, or whether ſhe had ſome other reaſons to diſſwade her from attempting it; ſhe did not move at all in that Affair, and a ſhort time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſhe never went out of her Palace, but only to make Viſits of common decency to the King and Queen.</p>
            <p>The Chief Miniſter, the Father Confeſſor and <hi>d'Eguya</hi> applauded one another for having removed the Queen-Mother from all ſhare in the Adminiſtration of Affairs, but fearing left the young Queen might become ſerviceable to her in this conjecture, they found it conveni
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0148502702:163"/>
ent to render the Queen-Mother ſuſpected to her. They took a very odd way to effect it, but one that ſerved their turn as well as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; that is to ſay, they began to inſpire the King with a diſlike of the Queen's Conduct, wherein they made him obſerve abundance of inconſiderable ſlight things, which they inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted to him with ſo much the more Mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity, becauſe the Queen acting without any reſerve as all Perſons of Sincerity uſe to do, never reſtrained her own natural Temper.</p>
            <p>Sometimes the King expreſſed to her ſome diſſatisfaction at it, and this afflicted her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely, but while ſhe looked about her to find out who thoſe Perſons were that did her theſe ill Offices, ſome of the Duke's Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents gave her to underſtand that all this came from the Queen-Mother, who ſeeing ſhe had no Children, endeavoured to render the King indifferent to her, that ſo ſhe might arrive to what ſhe ſo earneſtly deſired, which was to ſee the Arch-Dutcheſs Queen of <hi>Spain.</hi> The young Queen found ſome appearances of truth in what they told her, and this threw her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a dejection of Mind, that really made her an object of Compaſſion. Another Affliction was joyned to this, and contributed to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gment her Grief, and that was to ſee the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Credit ſhe had to obtain whatever ſhe deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
            <p>For although the Chief Miniſter had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to be always devoted to her Service, and ſhe had accepted of the Dutcheſs <hi>d'Albuquerque</hi> chiefly upon his Recommendation; yet he ſeemed not at all to be ſenſible of it, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver obliged her in any tolerable Manner. It was to no purpoſe that ſhe begged any favour of the King, and it was to as little purpoſe
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0148502702:164"/>
that his Majeſty granted them; for he no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſpoke to the Duke about them, but the Duke diſſwaded him from doing what the Queen deſired; in ſuch manner, that if ſhe requeſted any thing, it was ſufficient for her to reſt aſſured that ſhe ſhould loſe the Fruit of her Deſires. The Queen, who had a great deal of Wit and Penetration, and who knew what Obſtacles the Chief Miniſter always laid in her way, could not forbear to ſpeak to the King about him, in a moſt preſſing earneſt manner, which intimated to him his unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fondneſs for the Chief Miniſter; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſhe cloſed the Diſcouſe with a particular detail of the Diſorders which were to be found in all Affairs, by reaſon of the Duke's inſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Negligence. The King gave <hi>d'Eguya</hi> an Account of what the Queen told him, <hi>d'Eguya</hi> carried all to the Duke to make his Court by it, and this ſtill occaſioned freſh Complaints on one ſide and t'other. The young Queen by this means compleatly loſt that little Intereſt ſhe had in the Chief Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and ſometimes could not tell what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures ſhe ought to take, to ſtrengthen and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port her own Authority.</p>
            <p>The Queen was conſidering with her ſelf, what the Occaſion might be that made the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> neglect to give her that deference he was obliged to pay her for ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Reaſons; and the Duke being informed that the Queen's Reſentments againſt him daily increaſed, made uſe of the Marqueſs <hi>d'Aſtor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gas</hi>'s Confeſſor, to tell him who belonged to the Queen, that her Majeſty made a wrong Judgment of his Inclinations; that he ſhould always be ready to give her all imaginable Te<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtimonies of his Reſpect and Fidelity, but tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:0148502702:165"/>
it was an ungrateful diſpleaſing ſight to him to ſee her Majeſty ſhew ſuch particular Favours to Perſons directly oppoſite to him, amongſt whom he reckoned the Marchioneſs <hi>de Liche,</hi> the Counteſs <hi>de Monterey,</hi> the Princeſs <hi>de Stilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> the Dutcheſs <hi>de Oſſone,</hi> the Marchioneſs <hi>de los Velez,</hi> the Dutcheſs <hi>de l'Infantado,</hi> and ſome others: That if ſhe would be pleaſed to remove thoſe Ladies, or at leaſt not entertain them with ſuch evident diſtinctions of Kindneſs, he ſhould receive it with a moſt ſenſible acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, and omit no opportunity to give her all the proofs of Gratitude he was capable of. He added, that without conſulting his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Intereſts in this, he was obliged to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint her Majeſty, as being her Servant, that it was not the Cuſtom of <hi>Spain</hi> for the Ladies to have ſuch free Acceſs into the Queen's Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that generally they were introduced by the <hi>Camerara Major</hi> only. The Queen liſtn'd to this Advice the Chief Miniſter ſent her, but had no Inclinations to follow it; becauſe ſhe found he deſigned to ſubject her intirely to the Dutcheſs <hi>d'Albuquerque</hi> after the ſame manner as ſhe had been to the Dutcheſs <hi>de Terra Nova.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She knew that in all the differences he had with the Queen-Mother, the <hi>Camerara Major</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways declared for him, that ſhe embraced his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts with more Zeal than her own, and that ſhe had clearly forgotten all that the Queen-Mother had done for her to advance her to this place. The Queen had no deſire to throw her ſelf again into a Captivity, from which ſhe had lately got her ſelf delivered with ſo much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty. Thus ſhe was content to examine the Motives which made them ſet ſo many Intreagues on Foot, but had no mind to be the Victim.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:0148502702:166"/>
The Duke had ſo preſſing a deſire to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the ſole Affections of his Maſter, that he could never forgive thoſe Perſons who were in a Capacity to become his Rivals; and he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a certain Air of Sincerity to his words, whenever he ſpoke ill of any one, that the King was really perſwaded he had no private by-ends in doing it: His Relations, nay, even his Friends had no more Privileges than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who were indifferent to him. The Duke was believed, becauſe he always paſſed for an honeſt Gentleman; but one ought to have a great Fund of Vertue, not to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted when he becomes a Favourite. He repreſented to the King, all thoſe that came near his Perſon, as ſo many Secret Enemies and Domeſtick Spies, who had neither Zeal nor Affection for him: And theſe Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons wrought ſo far upon the King's Spirit, that he was ſcarce ever able to wear them off. The Duke not only did ill Offices to thoſe that belonged to the King's Houſhold, but he extended his Malice to all thoſe who were able to maintain any Intelligence between the Queen and the Queen-Mother. He was perſwaded, that the Ambaſſador of <hi>France</hi> and his Lady, contributed to it all that lay in their Power; and this made him conceive an Averſion for them both: He ſpoke of them daily to the King, after a very diſobliging man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and laid ſeveral things to their charge wherein they were not concerned. This made the King ſo mightily diſpleaſed with them, that he could not forbear to tell the Queen one Day, as they accidentaly talked of the Marqueſs <hi>de Villars,</hi> That he had poyſoned <q rend="inline">all the Court, and that he would rather chuſe to have an open War with <hi>France,</hi>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:0148502702:167"/>
than ſuch an Ambaſſador at <hi>Madrid.</hi>
               </q> He af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this let fall ſome reflecting Words againſt the Ambaſſador's Lady, which ſufficiently teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied what ſtrange Thoughts he had of her; although we may ſafely ſay, that neither ſhe nor her Husband deſerved it. But the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the Chief Miniſter was ſo provoked againſt them, was, becauſe he was well inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the Prince <hi>de Stillano,</hi> the Count <hi>de Monterey</hi>; the Duke <hi>de Veraguas,</hi> the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and ſome others had ſeen him in private, and communicated to him their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns againſt him, to which he was to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute ſomething on his ſide, by getting the Queen to ſupport the Project. But ſuppoſe the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador really knew of their Intentions, this is no good Conſequence, that he was willing to ſecond them; and indeed there is little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability to believe it, becauſe the Ambaſſador had no Reaſon to deſire the Removal of the Chief Miniſter; and the Duke's Abilities were not ſo formidable, that the Court of <hi>France</hi> had any occaſion to be apprehenſive of him.</p>
            <p>While the Court at <hi>Madrid</hi> was thus divided about the little Intrigues I have mentioned, the People continued to cry out and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of their Grievances, becauſe no care was taken to redreſs them. It was now a full year ſince the Duke <hi>De Medina Celi</hi> had been made Chief Miniſter, and it was hoped that he would have taken all neceſſary meaſures in a matter ſo preſſing and important, as was the eaſing of the People; but he ſo far forgot his Duty, that every thing went worſe and worſe ſtill; and indeed the leaſt Inconveniences ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly improve in their Malignity, when they are neglected. The leſſening the Value of the Copper-Money had occaſioned a great Diſorder:
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0148502702:168"/>
'Tis true indeed it might have been managed to the Publick Advantage, but they took ſuch wrong meaſures in the Regulation, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a moſt horrible Oppreſſion; for the Species of Gold and Silver being thus reduced to one half of its juſt Value, Foreigners took ſuch hold of this opportunity, that they exported prodigious Sums out of the Kingdom. Beſides this, the price of <hi>Segovia</hi> Wooll, which is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Commodity, and brings a mighty Profit to thoſe that deal in it, roſe in proportion to the abatement of the Money; ſo that no body would buy it, unleſs they would ſink the Price: And things being in this condition, then at laſt came the crying down of the Money, and this totally compleated and ratified their Miſery. There was computed to be of it to the Value of Six Millions of Crowns. The King did not at all take them off, although he had promiſed by his Edict, to pay the full Value of the Metal, to thoſe who brought them into the Offices appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to receive them. So all this Money lay abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely dead: And it is no eaſie matter to expreſs the Loſs which the Bankers, the Merchants, the King's Farmers, and almoſt every private Man ſuffered by this decrying of it down. Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were the only Men that made Advantage of this General Misfortune of <hi>Spain:</hi> They bought this Copper-Money, that was mixt with a good Allay of Silver, for very little, and ſent it to <hi>Genoa,</hi> to <hi>Portugal,</hi> and other Places. The Council very well knew the Prejudice the King<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dom received by it, and Aſſembled ſeveral times to find out an Expedient to put a ſtop to it: There were ſome Undertakers, that offered to treat for all of it, and ſeparate the Silver from the Copper; and as I ſaid before, <hi>Don Philip Vinzam,</hi> was made choice of in this Affair; but
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0148502702:169"/>
he had not been preferred before others, if it had not been for the Credit of <hi>Don Pedro de Arraga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> This Man owed him great Sums of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and had been twice Bankrupt, and was juſt upon the Point of breaking the third time; ſo he was deſirous to introduce him into ſome great buſineſs, that he might by this means enrich himſelf, and be in a capacity of paying his Debts: But this Project did not ſucceed, becauſe ſo great a quantity of this Money was already carried out of the Kingdom, and the ſeparating of the Allay was ſo difficult a matter.</p>
            <p>Theſe Loſſes were the cauſe that abundance of Perſons of great Quality found themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a neceſſity of ſelling their Plate and Jewels. 'Tis true, there is ſo much both of the one and the other at <hi>Madrid,</hi> that it cannot well fail in a long time. What made ſeveral private Men ſuffer the more, was, that the Rents of the Town-Hall, which were reduced from Eight to Five in the Hundred, were not now paid at all; becauſe the <hi>Corregidors</hi> and <hi>Regidors,</hi> who were concerned in the Payment of it, were ſuch great Villains, that although the City was ſufficiently haraſſed with Cuſtoms, Taxes, and heavy Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, before theſe People had drained it as long as they pleaſed, and that they had put ſome ſmall inconſiderable matter of it into the King's Coffers; there was nothing more left out of ſo many Impoſts, and yet they were not levied for the greateſt part, but under the pretence of ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Rents of the Town-Hall.</p>
            <p>But how was it poſſible to put things, as they now ſtood, into a better Order? It was reſolved, that there ſhould not be above four <hi>Regidors</hi>; there had been more than Fifty, and their Places were worth Sixty Thouſand Crowns. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that before they could reimburſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0148502702:170"/>
of ſuch a Sum, they muſt be guilty of great Extortion and Cheating.</p>
            <p>An Order was ſent from <hi>Madrid</hi> to all the Ports to publiſh Repriſals in favour of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> upon the Veſſels belonging to the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh.</hi> I have already ſpoke of the Veſſel which that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector's Subjects had taken away from his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Majeſty. The Elector had allowed three Months to redeem her, but they were not in a Condition to do it. The Ambaſſadors of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> laboured to Accommodate the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with no Succeſs; becauſe the Elector declared he would be paid his Eight Hundred Thouſand Crowns that were due to him, and he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore nothing but upon that Condition. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Court would rather ſuffer him to enjoy his Prize: However, to ſave the Honour of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Miniſters pretended, that the King would have his Veſſel reſtored before he would do any thing, and that he refuſed to hearken to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Propoſal till that were executed.</p>
            <p>The Queen-Mother, who ſeldom ſtirred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and who lived a very Melancholy Life at her Palace, invited the Young Queen one day to Dinner, when the King was gone out a Hunting: They afterwards ſhut them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up in the Queen-Mother's great Cloſet, and (as ſhe told the Marchioneſs <hi>de Mortare,</hi> from whom I afterwards had the Story) they began to weep and embrace one another ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tenderly. The Queen-Mother complained, <hi>That the Queen her Daughter-in-Law, had preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced the King againſt her, and that ſhe ſuffered as great a Confinement, as if</hi> Don Juan <hi>did ſtill Govern; that ſhe was not ignorant that the Duke</hi> de Medina Celi<hi>, </hi>d'Eguya<hi>, and the Confeſſor did her all the ill Offices they were able; that if</hi>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:0148502702:171"/>
               <hi>ſhe had only theſe to Combat, ſhe would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to deſtroy them; that perhaps ſhe might be a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble to accompliſh it, but that when ſhe ſaw the Queen at the Head of the Party, ſhe had no Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage left to defend her ſelf; that although ſhe very well knew, ſhe had promiſed to do her all the Injury ſhe could, yet ſhe could not forbear to ſpeak to her of it, rather to eaſe her ſelf, than out of any Hopes to ſoften her diſpoſitions. Alas, Madam, Alas,</hi> cryed the Young Queen all in Tears, <hi>why do you add ſuch ſtabbing Suſpicions to the other ills you have done me? Could you not be conteat to poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon my Conduct before the King, and make him ſhew me a thouſand ſenſible unkindneſſes upon that ſcore, but muſt you inſult upon me too, and accuſe me of the only thing in the World I am uncapable of doing?</hi> At theſe words, the Queen-Mother ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out her Arms to her, and they tarried a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſpace of time without being able to ſpeak a Syllable; ſo much were both their Minds prepoſſeſſed againſt each other: But at laſt, when they could ſpeak in cold Blood, and came to examine what had been ſaid on both ſides, they were ſenſible that ſome ill Perſons had endeavoured to diſ-unite them, in order to Fortifie their own Party, which was equally contrary to them both. They gave one another an Account of the meaſures that had been taken, of the Perſons that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in them, of thoſe whom they ought to ſuſpect for the time to come, and they reſolved to employ all their Intereſt to deſtroy the oppoſite Cabal. They ſtayed together till it was Night, and on the next day, which was the fifth of <hi>February,</hi> the Conſtable of <hi>Caſtile</hi> gave the King and the two Queens a Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Collation, accompanied with Muſick. The King's Dwarf, who is one of the prettieſt
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0148502702:172"/>
Creatures in the World, whom the Conſtable brought with him from his Government of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> where he ſucceeded <hi>Don Juan,</hi> danced a <note n="*" place="margin">A Ground.</note>
               <hi>Paſſa Cailla</hi> along with a young Girl whom the Queen had taken to her Service, and was newly redeemed out of Slavery. They were both of them dreſs'd after the <hi>Indian</hi> Faſhion, covered with Feathers of Birds of different colours; they had little Tabors, and played prettily upon them. This Feaſt was followed by another at the Houſe of <hi>Don Pedro d'Arragon,</hi> where the Queen danced before the King, which ſhe had never done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, although ſhe acquitted her ſelf that way to admiration. She had purpoſely learned the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries</hi> and a <hi>Saraband</hi>; ſo that the King was perfectly charmed to ſee her ſo expert in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Dances, and told her ſeveral times as he preſſed her Arms with his two Hands, <hi>Mi Reina, Mi Reina, eres la mas perfeta de todo el Orbe:</hi> That is to ſay, <hi>My Queen, my Queen, you are the moſt accompliſhed Perſon in the whole World.</hi> The Queen-Mother ſent her that Evening a Watch all adorned with Diamonds, and a Gold-Chain of exquiſite Work; ſhe writ a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to her, wherein ſhe wiſhed that this Watch would only ſhew her happy and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Hours. The Queen returned her this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that they would be always ſo, if ſhe would continue to love her. She afterwards deſired the King to tell her ſome tender thing, that ſhe might ſend it to the Queen-Mother. The King told her immediately <hi>No tengo, que deſir.</hi> How, Sir, ſays the Queen, have you nothing to ſay to the Queen your Mother? I beſeech you to give me a Compliment that may pleaſe her. The King ſtudied a long time what to ſend her, and at laſt ſaid, <hi>Ponga os mi Reina, que jo</hi>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:0148502702:173"/>
               <hi>tongo buſna ſalud.</hi> That is to ſay, <hi>Write my Queen, that I am well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King diſpatched an Order to Prince <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,</hi> Governour of the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> to make a grand Reform amongſt the Officers of War and Juſtice. He gave at the ſame time the Vice-Royſhip of <hi>Navar</hi> to the Great Prior of <hi>Caſtile.</hi> The Count <hi>de Fuen Salida,</hi> who poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that Poſt, went to <hi>Gallicia,</hi> whereof he was made Vice-Roy. The Count <hi>de Palma,</hi> Nephew to Cardinal <hi>Portocarero,</hi> had the Government of <hi>Malaga,</hi> and the Coaſts of <hi>Granada,</hi> in the room of the Count <hi>de Cifuentes,</hi> and the Duke <hi>de Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jar,</hi> Son-in-law to the Dutcheſs <hi>de Terra-Nova,</hi> obtained the Vice-Royſhip of <hi>Arragon.</hi> This Dutcheſs had not appeared at Court ever ſince ſhe had quitted it with ſo great a Diſguſt: But her Son-in-law having now received this new Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, ſhe was reſolved to go and viſit the Queen on the tenth of <hi>February.</hi> She had already ſent to her Majeſty, to demand her Permiſſion, and the Queen ſent her word, that ſhe ſhould be glad to ſee her. The Dutcheſs at her entrance into the Queen's Chamber, ſeemed at firſt a little diſordered: She excuſed her not coming to Court upon the account of a long fit of Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and then added, <hi>I aſſure your Majeſty I did not think I ſhould have been able to live, after my misfortune to be ſeparated from you.</hi> The Queen told her, that ſhe had been informed of her Indiſpoſition, but that this was not a place for her to ſpeak of what made her uneaſie, and in effect paſſed to ſome other Diſcourſe. The Dutcheſs <hi>de Terra Nova</hi> fixed her Eyes continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally on the Dutcheſs <hi>d'Albuquerque,</hi> as if ſhe had a mind to devour her; and the Dutcheſs <hi>d'Albuquerque,</hi> whoſe Eyes were neither better
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0148502702:174"/>
nor ſweeter than hers, looked askew upon her, and they let fall every other moment ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions that were a little eager.</p>
            <p>One of the Footmen belonging to the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambaſſador had committed ſome Inſolence, and the Juſtices ordered him to be Apprehended for it: But this Miniſter pretending that it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Privilege of Ambaſſadors, complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of it to the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> but he did not receive ſo favourable an Anſwer from him as he expected. This ſo much diſguſted him, that he went to acquaint the reſt of the Ambaſſadors with it, who all agreed to repreſent the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of ſuch an Action to the Duke <hi>de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina Celi</hi> in a large Memorial conceived in very harſh Terms, which they ſent to him all at the ſame time. The Chief Miniſter carried it to the Council of State, who after they had maturely deliberated upon the Affair, were of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that they ſhould ſet the Footman immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately at liberty. The Ambaſſadors were reſolved, in caſe they had refuſed them this Satisfaction, to have forced the Priſon to fetch him out.</p>
            <p>Conſtable <hi>Colonna</hi> came back to <hi>Madrid</hi> in <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burary.</hi> The moſt important Affair that brought him thither, was his deſire to Accommodate Matters with his Lady, and to find out a way for both of them to live in Peace. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of his Son with the Daughter of the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> did alſo take him up very much. The Queen was concerned at the Misfortunes of his Wife, and it was no ſmall trouble to her to underſtand what ill uſage a Perſon of her Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity received in Priſon: Nay, ſhe was particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obliged to protect her, by reaſon of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe the Duke had made her, and the Confidence the Conſtable's Lady repoſed in it. Theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons engaged her to charge her Confeſſor to do
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0148502702:175"/>
all he could with the Conſtable, in order to Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiate an Accommodation, and ſee whether he would carry her into <hi>Italy,</hi> or ſuffer her to ſtay in ſome Religious Convent at <hi>Madrid,</hi> as ſhe had already been. But the Conſtable and his Wife were ſtrangely exaſperated againſt one another: She reſented to the Life the unworthy Treatment ſhe had received; and the mutual occaſions they had to complain, hindered them from conſenting to what might contribute to their common ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. At laſt, the Conſtable being earneſtly importuned by the Queen, and adviſed by the Marqueſs <hi>de Los Balbazez,</hi> propoſed, that his Wife ſhould turn a Religious, and that he, for his part, ſhould take the Habit of a Knight of <hi>Malta.</hi> This at firſt appeared very ſurpriſing to all the World, but indeed was more ſtrange to the Conſtable's Lady than to any one; for 'tis certain ſhe had no great deſire to that Life, and her Inclination did not very well reliſh Three mortifying Vows, an auſtere Cloyſtering, and a ſevere Rule. Nevertheleſs, the Conſtable was ſo poſitive, that all his Wive's Friends were ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied there was no other way to deliver the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Lady out of the Caſtle of <hi>Segovia,</hi> but by obliging her to give her conſent to what he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. Thus at laſt they prevailed upon her to conſent to it; ſo ſhe was brought back to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid</hi> on the 15<hi>th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> 1681. where ſhe immediately was ſhut up amongſt the Nuns of the Conception of the Order of St. <hi>Jerome.</hi> She was ſo afflicted at her Misfortunes, that ſhe would ſee no body but her Children: She told them ſhe looked upon her ſelf to be the moſt Unfortunate Creature in the World, and that ſhe was going to do a thing which might coſt her the Repoſe of her Life; That ſhe beheld the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0148502702:176"/>
of it with Terror, but that nevertheleſs ſhe was reſolved to undergo it, becauſe ſhe had given her Promiſe. In effect, ſhe went down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Quire, where every thing was prepared for the Ceremony, and ſhe took upon her the Habit of a Novice, but with a formal deſign to die rather than make Profeſſion. She wore a Pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticoat of Gold and Silver Brocard, under her Woollen Robe, and when ſhe was not in company with any of the Nuns, ſhe would throw her Veil aſide, and put a Coif upon her Head, after the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Mode, dreſs'd with Ribbons of all Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. Sometimes it ſo happened, that the Bell rung to Chappel, where ſhe was obliged to make her Appearance by the Rule of her Order, and the Miſtreſs of the Novices comming to inform her of it, ſhe clapt on her Frock and Veil over her Ribbons and her looſe Hair: This made a very odd and comical Figure, and no body could have forborn laughing at it, had not her Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries on the other hand, drawn the Compaſſion of all Perſons that knew her; for indeed her Condition was very Neceſſitous, ſhe wanted Money, had but mean Eating, and yet worſe Lodging. One Day as I happened to be in the Queen's Retinue, I entred the Convent; and the Conſtable's Lady carried me to her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; I was like to have been ſtarved with the Cold there; it was as high as a Tennis-Court, and not to flatter the Place, it was no better than a great Barn. The Conſtable got a Diſpenſation from <hi>Rome</hi> to haſten the time of her Profeſſion: and he himſelf was obliged, as I have already ſaid, to take the Vows of the Order of <hi>Malta</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he was told every day, that his Wife had an unconquerable Averſion to become a Religious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and at laſt had no hopes of it: The Marqueſs <hi>de</hi>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:0148502702:177"/>
               <hi>Los Balbazez,</hi> as well as the Marchioneſs, were not a little concerned to be laught at by all the World. The Conſtable concluded the Marriage of his Eldeſt Son with the Daughter of the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> and parted three days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to return to <hi>Rome:</hi> He carried his Siſter-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law, and his two Sons along with him. As for his Lady, ſhe ſtill tarried in the Convent, where ſhe wore the Habit of a Religious long enough, and at laſt quitted it.</p>
            <p>The King and Queen went to the <hi>Jeſuits Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,</hi> to ſee a Tragedy, where a young Scholar, who Perſonated a Fury, coming upon the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre with a lighted Torch in his Hand, perceived his Tutor in a Corner, who acted a Chymiſt: In all appearance he bore him a Grudge; for he ran after him, and burnt his Beard and Hair, and purſued him like a real Fury indeed. He play'd his part ſo well, that the King was mightily pleaſed with him, and would needs have them begin that Scene again, becauſe it was the pretti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in the Play. The Scholar deſired it withal his Heart, but neither his Tutor, nor any of the College, had a mind to be concerned in the other part. The <hi>Carnival</hi> approached, and a Comedy was play'd the three laſt days of it at Court. On the 19th of <hi>February,</hi> which was <hi>Aſh-Wedneſday,</hi> the King had a Solemn Service at the Chappel Royal, and ordered the Ambaſſadors to be told, that he would continue to have one every Week, except <hi>Holyday Week.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied himſelf ſeriouſly to find out means to ſet a Fleet to Sea by the Spring, and treated with ſome of the principal Bankers of <hi>Madrid,</hi> whoſe Names were <hi>Dominico Grillo, Franciſco de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerato,</hi> and <hi>Ambroſio Dionis.</hi> The firſt engaged
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0148502702:178"/>
to ſend a Hundred Thouſand Piaſters a Month to <hi>Flanders,</hi> the ſecond to remit Fifty Thouſand to <hi>Catalonia,</hi> and the third Thirty Thouſand to <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>var.</hi> But what ſignified all theſe Treaties, ſince they were not in a Condition to furniſh neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Funds? The Court received Advice from <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> from whence they expected ſome Supplies in Money, That the Prince <hi>de Belvedere,</hi> and ſeveral of the Principal Barons, were retired to their reſpective Country-Houſes, by reaſon of the great Diſorders and Miſery of that City. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, they were informed, that the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Trapan,</hi> and of two other Cities in that Kingdom, had made an Inſurrection, killed their Governor and Judges, and at the ſame time had ſent to demand Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Turks.</hi> This News found but an Unwelcome Reception at <hi>Madrid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There arrived alſo at Court a Deputy of the Commerce at <hi>Sevil,</hi> with whom I had a long Converſation. He aſſured me, that that great and ſtately City was reduced to a Condition which amazed all the World; That there did not now remain one fourth part of its Inhabitants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That the Impoſts increaſed every day; and that this City, which but about Fifty Years ago, was one of the Richeſt in the Univerſe, was now ready to ſink for want of relief; although the Gallions arrived there, and it ſtill enjoy'd the moſt conſiderable Trade of any Place in <hi>Spain</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We may hence juſtly conclude, in what a ſad Condition the reſt of the Cities of <hi>Spain</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>duced to, ſince the beſt of them was almoſt ruined<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This Reaſon obliged me to enquire of a certai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Money only, which came from the <hi>Indies,</hi> they amounted to Thirty Millions and Eight Hundred Thouſand Ducats, which in <hi>French</hi> Money is worth ſomewhat more than Seventy Five Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Livers: But then it ought to be obſerved, that the King does not touch a third part of this Sum, the greateſt part of it being either otherwiſe gaged or purloined: And yet out of this third part are to be defrayed the Expences of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, the Penſions his Majeſty beſtows, and the Payment of his Armies. He is likewiſe obliged to be ſtill ſending conſiderable Sums to <hi>Milan,</hi> to <hi>Naples,</hi> to <hi>Meſſina,</hi> to <hi>Catalonia,</hi> and to <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders:</hi> For the Vice-Roys and Governors take ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual care that the King ſhall not draw a Farthing out of thoſe Kingdoms and Provinces; they keep all the Profits to themſelves: And this is the Reaſon why Money is ſo often wanting, even for the neceſſary Occaſions of the King's Houſe. But after all, I can by no means be perſwaded, but that he is richer than he is generally ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be; for there is no probability that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he could be able to give as he does, ſuch conſiderable Penſions, and ſo much in ſtanding Wages, to ſo vaſt a number of People. It is true, theſe Liberalities ſo mightily incommoded him, that about the beginning of the Year 1681. all the Livery-men of the Stables, having waited two Years together for their Wages, left the King's Service on the ſame day, and looked abroad to get a Livelihood; ſo that his Horſes had no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to look after them, or give them Corn. This appeared ſo much the leſs ſurpriſing, becauſe the Table of the Gentlemen of his Bed-Chamber, was abſolutely laid aſide, although it was the only one the King kept in his Palace. The Women that waited upon the Queen had no better luck,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0148502702:180"/>
and the Court could not be ſupplied with Money enough to defray the leaſt Expences. This Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity laſted for a while, and then things were eſtabliſhed as formerly. But what is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, and deſerves the laſt Commendation, the Soldiers, notwithſtanding this Miſery, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſtill in the Service; although there were ſeveral Officers, nay, entire Regiments of them that had not received two Months pay in three Years. However, this was the reaſon that abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Gariſons were ill provided with Men, and in a very bad Condition, and particularly on the ſide of <hi>Eſtrà Madura,</hi> where nevertheleſs it was their Intereſt to have been more careful; becauſe the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> had very conſiderable Poſts in that part of the Country.</p>
            <p>We ſaw the Governors of St. <hi>Sebaſtian, Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boa,</hi> and <hi>Fontarabia</hi> at <hi>Madrid,</hi> who came on purpoſe to acquaint the Council of War, that their Soldiers died of hunger, that the youngeſt of them had deſerted, that none but the old and infirm were left behind in the Garriſons; and that in a ſhort time there would be none of theſe left, unleſs they gave them a ſpeedy Relief. They had fair Promiſes made them, they return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back, but were forgotten as well as a great number of others.</p>
            <p>It is indeed ſurprizing, and cannot eaſily be believed; that in this very <hi>Spain,</hi> ſo exceſſively poor and exhauſted, as it ſeems to be, the <hi>Flota</hi> from the <hi>Indies</hi> only, in the Year 1680, brought Thirty Millions of Gold. But of theſe prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Summs that arrive there every Year, we muſt deduct near two thirds which the Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers draw away for the ſeveral Goods they furniſh them with; and beſides there is a way found to cheat the King of the fifth Penney, which is due
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0148502702:181"/>
to him, out of all the Silver that comes from the <hi>Indies.</hi> There is another thing ſtill behind that contributes exceedingly to make the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> ſo deſtitute of Money as they are, and that is the prodigious number of <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> who come to help them, whether in the Tillage of the Ground, or in their Buildings, or any other things of a more ſervile Nature, which the <hi>Don Diegos</hi> and the <hi>Don Dodriguez</hi> think ſo much below them, either out of a Principle of Vanity or Idleneſs, that they had rather chuſe to ſtarve, than reſolve to ſet about them. But Foreigners are not ſo nice and delicate, they come hither, and when they have ſcraped a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Money together, they return to their own Country; in the mean time others come in their room, and are employed in the ſame Work. They are computed generally to be full Forty Thouſand, who come in and go out of the Kingdom after this manner, and there is not one of them who does not carry away with him Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or Eight Piſtoles every Year, and ſometimes more. It is eaſie to judge that this ariſes to a prodigious Summ.</p>
            <p>The People ſtill continued to cry out and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim, and at laſt the Duke fatigu'd with the great buſineſs he had upon his Hands, and with theſe continual Complaints, reſolved to erect a Juncto to ſet things in order again, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to relieve the preſent Neceſſities. He caſt his Eyes upon a Perſon of great Abilities, whoſe Name was <hi>Don Lopez de los Rios,</hi> and whoſe Vertue and Experience were ſufficiently known; for he had always bore ſome Office ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Civil Government, or the Finances. He had firſt ſhew'd a great Zeal, and the heat of this Zeal did not at all abate in his Mind,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0148502702:182"/>
but he found himſelf not ſtrong enough to cope with all the Enemies alone, whom he muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to create by a ſevere and ſteady Conduct. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Perſons, nay, even the Miniſters intereſted in theſe Affairs, directly thwarted him; and by this means deſtroyed all that he had eſtabliſhed with ſo much Pains and Induſtry.</p>
            <p>On the 23<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>February</hi> a private Act of the Inquiſition was performed in the Church of the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> where Twenty Perſons were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for being guilty of Superſtition, Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Judaiſm. The Duke <hi>de Villa Hermoſa,</hi> who came back from <hi>Flanders,</hi> arrived about this time at <hi>Madrid,</hi> and the Duke <hi>d'Hijar</hi> parted from thence to go to <hi>Saragoſſa,</hi> and take Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Vice-Royſhip of <hi>Arragon.</hi> Two days after this, which was the 26<hi>th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> the Marqueſs <hi>de Mondejar</hi> was made a Grandee of <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>d'Oſſone,</hi> who now began to be weary of not ſupplying his Place himſelf, deſired ſome of his Friends to intercede with the King in his behalf, that he mightcome to Court; and the King conſented to it, with this Proviſo, that he ſhould perform his Duty better for the time to come. The Count <hi>de Pouar,</hi> and the Count <hi>de Montiel</hi> were forbidden the Court; both of them were paſſionately in love with <hi>Donna Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſca d'Alcannicas,</hi> Lady of Honour to the Queen, and Niece to the Conſtable of <hi>Caſtile.</hi> The Count <hi>de Pouar</hi> was under her Chamber Window, and entertained her there with his Fingers, as is the manner of <hi>Spain,</hi> and told her a Story very much to the diſadvantage of the Count <hi>de Montiel,</hi> who lay hid in a Corner, where he ſaw and underſtood all; ſo that coming towards the Count <hi>de Pouar</hi> all enraged, with his
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0148502702:183"/>
Hand upon the Guard of his Sword, he told him he was a perfidious Villain, and that he might thank his good Fortune for being in the Palace. The Count <hi>de Pouar</hi> coldly anſwered, that he would go out of it as ſoon as he had told <hi>Donna Franciſca</hi> two or three things he had ſtill to ſay no her, and that he came ſeaſonably enough to be a Witneſs of them, becauſe they concerned him. The Count <hi>de Montiel</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with Choler, was upon the point of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Sword upon his Rival. But the Duke <hi>d'Uſſeda,</hi> Brother to <hi>Donna Franciſca,</hi> paſſing by that way with the Count <hi>d'Altamire,</hi> ſhe made them a ſign to draw near, and told them with her Fingers what had happened. The two Lords laboured all they could to make up the quarrel between the two Rivals, and ſucceeded in it; however this Accident could not be kept ſo ſecret but that the King being informed of it, forbid them the Court.</p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>de Sejar</hi> parted from hence to go and ſerve in <hi>Flanders</hi> in quality of a Volunteer. He was a Perſon of Illuſtrious Birth, very Rich, and very Young; the reaſon he did this was only becauſe he was jealous of his Lady. The Count <hi>de Talara</hi> had the Place of Judge of the Forreſts conferred upon him, which was vacant by the Death of the Marqueſs <hi>de la Garde</hi>; and <hi>Don Franciſco de Manſerato</hi> obtained the Title of Marqueſs <hi>de Tamarit.</hi> The King ordered the Council to diſcharge all the Receivers of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, that are laid upon the Provinces: Theſe Officers were above a Thouſand, and the ſuppreſſing of them muſt needs be of great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to his Catholick Majeſty, and to his Subjects.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:0148502702:184"/>
A Veſſel which came to <hi>Cales</hi> from the <hi>Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duras,</hi> brought News, that the <hi>Flota</hi> was happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arrrived on the fifth of <hi>September,</hi> and that the Merchants of <hi>Lima</hi> offered three Hundred Thouſand Crowns to the King, on condition that for an Year and half he would not ſend the Gallions here. In the mean time, ill Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hindred the Fleet, which had ſet Sail from <hi>Cales</hi> a little before, from doubling the Cape of St. <hi>Vinoent</hi>; the bad effects of this Tempeſt were not only perceived at Sea, for it was ſo violent in all parts of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> that ſeveral Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were beaten down, and the exceeding Rains ſo ſwelled the Rivers, that the Roads were o'rflown; and almoſt all the Bridges carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by the rapidity of the Waters.</p>
            <p>This ill news was followed immediately by three Couriers, one upon the neck of another, and the firſt of them arrived on the thirteenth of <hi>March,</hi> from Abbot <hi>Maſſerati,</hi> Envoy of <hi>Spain</hi> in <hi>Portugal.</hi> He diſpatched them to inform the Council, that they had received Advice at <hi>Lisbon</hi> by a Veſſel, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Buenoſaires,</hi> having got together abundance of <hi>Indians,</hi> had joined them to his Garriſon; that on the 15th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1680. he had ſurpriſed the Fort which the <hi>Portugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> had began to build in the Iſle of St. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel</hi>; that he had taken the Governour Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, and cut the Garriſon in pieces; that the Prince-Regent being provoked at this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult, had aſſembled the Council of State, where the Queen of <hi>Portugal</hi> was preſent; that they had reſolved to raiſe the Militia, and ſend 400 Horſe, and Four Regiments of Old Soldiers into <hi>Eſtramadura</hi>; that it would be neceſſary to get Magazines ready on the Frontiers, and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0148502702:185"/>
to have a General Rendezvous at <hi>Eluas</hi>; that having demanded Audience of the Prince-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, he had refuſed it him, and that in all probability a War would enſue. 'Twas ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected at Court that the Envoy of <hi>Portugal</hi> would make his Complaints, but they were extremely ſurprized to ſee him take no notice of it at all: So now it was not doubted, but that this Silence certainly preſaged a Surprize of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Territories, like to that which the Governour of <hi>Buenoſaires</hi> had committed in the <hi>Indies</hi> upon the <hi>Portugueſes.</hi> The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters judged it convenient to prevent this blow, and ſpoke to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ambaſſador about it; deſiring him to repreſent to the Envoy of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> that the King of <hi>England</hi> would be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to take up Arms againſt him who firſt broke the Peace, whereof he was Guarantee; that he had alſo a more particular Reaſon than this, foraſmuch as by the League that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded between the King his Maſter, and his Catholick Majeſty, they had mutually enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to Declare againſt the Enemy that fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on either of them. This Diſcourſe was ſpoke with a great deal of Heat; but the Envoy of <hi>Portugal</hi> anſwered him, That he looked upon him to be a Partiſan of the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> rather than an Ambaſſador from the King of <hi>England</hi>; that he knew very well he ſpoke without Order, and of his own Head: This Anſwer was followed by a Proteſtation in Writing, wherein it was declared that the King of <hi>England</hi> could not upon any Reaſon whatever hinder the Prince of <hi>Portugal</hi> from uſing the Right of Repriſals, and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to get Satisfaction from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> for the Injuries received.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:0148502702:186"/>
A little after this, the Envoy of <hi>Portugal</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an Order from the Prince Regent to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Publick Audience upon this Occaſion; and told his Catholick Majeſty, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded an entire Satisfaction from him, and that the Prince Regent deſired, that they would ſet the Soldiers and Governour at Liberty; that they would puniſh thoſe of <hi>Buenoſaires</hi>; that they would reſtore the Ammunition and Cannon; that if the Fort were razed, they would rebuild it, or elſe ſurrender the place; that in caſe the Priſoners were ſent into <hi>Spain,</hi> they would ſet them at Liberty; that they would receive into the Port of St. <hi>Gabriel</hi> the Garriſon which the Prince of <hi>Portugal</hi> ſhould ſend thither; that the Governour of <hi>Bueno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaires</hi> ſhould be chaſtiſed, and that an Anſwer be given in within Twenty Days, or elſe they would begin Actions of Hoſtility. Upon this the Council met, and ſpent three days to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate about it. They gave Orders for their Forces to march towards the moſt expoſed, defenceleſs places, and <hi>Don Antonio Panyagua,</hi> Maſter-General of the Camp, was charged to ſtay there, till he ſaw an end of this Affair.</p>
            <p>Beſides they ſet forth a great Memorial, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were contained the Arguments which the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy of <hi>Spain</hi> had given in at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> to make it appear by Authentick Papers, that according to the Limits appointed by Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> VI. the Iſle of St. <hi>Gabriel</hi> belongs to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and that they have had it a Hundred and Fourſcore and Six Years in their poſſeſſion. After this, they took notice of the Declaration of the Envoy of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and ended all with a Proteſtation, ſignifying, That they were deſirous to preſerve the Peace, and that they would labour with all
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0148502702:187"/>
Application in this matter. This <hi>Manifeſto</hi> was ſent to all the Foreign Miniſters to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to their Maſters; but they had ſcarce given it to them, when they ſent in all haſte back back again, for the Copies to Correct ſomething or other, and then they returned them again. At the ſame time a Rumour was induſtriouſly diſperſed, that the <hi>Nuncio</hi> by an expreſs Order from the Pope, had moved them to ſend an Ambaſſador to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> to treat about an Accommodation. But this was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally a Temperament they had found out to conceal the true Motives which engaged them to make this Advance. The <hi>Nuncio</hi> upon this ſaid openly, that he had never interpoſed in the Buſineſs, and that it was impoſſible to receive any Orders from <hi>Rome</hi> about ſo freſh an Affair.</p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>de Giovennazzo</hi> was choſen for this Embaſſy. As ſoon as he was arrived at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> he ſaw the Prince-Regent, who nominated the Duke <hi>de Cadaval,</hi> and the Marqueſs <hi>de Fronteyra</hi> for Commiſſioners. He would have made his Complaints at firſt, and demanded Satisfaction; but he was told that they were of a Humour clearly oppoſite to what he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; and that matters were to be done con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Memorial which the Envoy of <hi>Portugal</hi> had preſented at <hi>Madrid</hi>; or elſe let the Affair go whither it would for them. After ſome ſlight conteſtations, he gave his Conſent to it, and diſpatched a Courier to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi> to inform the Court of what he had done. Immediately the Miniſters bellowed out againſt him as a Man of no Judgment, who had violated his Fidelity to the King; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that he had infringed all the Rules of Prudence and good Senſe, by a Conduct
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0148502702:188"/>
and an Accommodation ſo diſadvantageous to <hi>Spain,</hi> and that his Inſtructions furniſhed him with no ſuch Power. All theſe Circumſtances of Indignnation and Reſentment were only of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to the Honour of the Nation: But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this, they did not loſe a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to conclude the Accommodation, and the Ratification of it was ſpeedily ſent to the Duke <hi>de Giovenazzo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Money ſtill continued to be as ſcarce as ever at <hi>Madrid,</hi> and certain it is that it was the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt difficulty in the World for the Council to provide a Hundred and Fifty Thouſand Crowns for the King to go to <hi>Aranjuez.</hi> The Ceremonial of the Palace, whereof I have already made mention, orders this Summ preciſely to be ſpent in that ſmall Journey, and here they are ſo exact to follow it, that they would not for all the World lay out a Hundred Piſtoles leſs. But after the Money was once in the King's Coffers, the Council thought to ſend it to the Forces that were kept on the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Portugal,</hi> by reaſon of the late dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference about the Iſle of St. <hi>Garbiel.</hi> The Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> ſpoke to the King about it, and propoſed that in this Juncture, they might take Money where ever they could find it; but he roundly anſwered him, <hi>Do what you will, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided you don't meddle with that which is deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for</hi> Aranjuez. He was not able to go thither all the Autumn, becauſe ſuch a Summ of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney as is neceſſary for that purpoſe could not be then gotten ready. He began his Journey a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> 1681; being not willing to break any of the Cuſtoms that are eſtabliſhed in the Ceremonial of the Palace: <hi>Philip</hi> II. obſerved it Religiouſly, and after him
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0148502702:189"/>
the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> have looked upon it as Sacred as a Law. Every thing is there ſet down, the Proceſſions, the Chaſes, the Solemn Days of Chappel, the changing of their Apartments, their Habits, their Walks, their Journeys, the Preſents the Kings make their Miſtreſſes, and what is to become of them when they ceaſe to love them any longer: In a word, there is to be found every thing, from the moſt eſſential circumſtance of State down to the moſt inſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant Trifles. The King tarried five Weeks at <hi>Aranjuez.</hi> This Royal Houſe is within ſeven Leagues of <hi>Madrid.</hi> He goes no where all the Year round but there, and to the <hi>Eſcurial</hi> in <hi>October:</hi> Theſe are his two great Journeys.</p>
            <p>I went thither along with a Relation of mine to take leave of the Queen, and receive her Protection for a young Girl, whom I was to leave behind me in <hi>Spain,</hi> and was very dear to me. She told me, ſhe would take her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Number of her Menines, and that I might aſſure my ſelf ſhe carried her own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation along with her, ſince ſhe came from <hi>France.</hi> She honoured me with her Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture in Enamel, incircled with Diamonds, and I ſenſibly regret the loſs of it to this very day. This is not a fit place to tell, how this Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune happened to me; perhaps I may ſtill write the Memoirs of another Court, where I reſided ſome time, and which are no leſs particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar than theſe; and there I ſhall have a fit oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to ſpeak concerning the Portraiture of the Lovely Queen.</p>
