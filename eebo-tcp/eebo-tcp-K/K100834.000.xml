            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>OF THE PLAN and CONDUCT OF THE FAERIE QUEENE. SECT. I.</head>
            <p>WHEN the works of Homer and of Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle began to be reſtored
and ſtudied in Italy, when the pure and uncorrupted ſources of antient
poeſy and antient criticiſm were opened, and literature in general ſeemed
emerging from the depths of Gothic ignorance and barbarity, it might have been
expected, that, inſtead of the ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic ſpecies of poetical compoſition
introduced by the provencal bards, a new and more legitimate taſte of writing
would have ſucceeded; that unnatural events, the machinations of imaginary
beings, and adventures entertaining only as they were improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, would have
given place to juſtneſs of thought and deſign, and to that decorum which
nature dictat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and which the example and the precept of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity had
authoriſed. But it was a long time before ſuch a change as this was
effected; and we find A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſto, many years after the revival of letters,
reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0143401900:5"/> truth for magic, and chuſing rather to follow
the irregular and ridiculous excurſions of Boiardo, than the propriety and
uniformity of the great Graecian and Roman Epic models. Nor was the ſtate of
cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm leſs generally and effectually influenced than that of poeſy
by the reſtoration of antient learning: Beni, one of the moſt celebrated
critics of the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth century, was ſtill ſo infatuated with a love of
the old provencal vein, that he ventured to write a regular diſſertation,
in which he compares Arioſto with Homer. Triſſino, indeed, who was nearly
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary with Arioſto, had taſte and boldneſs enough to publiſh a
poem written in profeſt imitation of the Iliad; but this attempt met with
little regard or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, for that very reaſon on which its real merit
was founded; it was rejected as an inſipid and unen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining performance,
having few devils or enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to recommend it. To Triſſino ſucceeded
Taſſo, who, in his Gieruſaleme Liberata, took the antients for his
guides; but was, at the ſame time, too ſenſible of the prevailing taſte
for ideal beings, and romantic deſcription, to omit them entirely; though he
was well acquainted with, and fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the excellencies of Homer and
Virgil, yet he ſtill kept the old provencal poets in his eye; like his own
Rinaldo, who after he had gaz'd on the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond ſhield of truth, and while he
was departing from Armida, and her enchanted gardens, could not help looking
back upon them with ſome remains of fondneſs. Nor did Taſſo's poem,
though compos'd, in ſome meaſure, on a claſſical and uniform plan, gain
its author (in his own country at leaſt) any high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0143401900:6"/>
ſhare of praiſe and reputation upon that account: Arioſto, with all his
extravagancies, was ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred; and the ſuperiority of the Orlando
Furioſo to the Gieruſaleme Liberata was at length eſtabliſh'd by a
formal decree of the Academicians della Cruſca, who held a ſolemn court of
enquiry concerning the merit of both poems.</p>
            <p>In the midſt of this bad taſte, Spenſer began to write his
FAERIE QUEENE; which, after the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Arioſto, was to conſiſt of
allegories, enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and romantic adventures, carried on by fairy
knights, giants, magicians, and fictitious beings. It may indeed be urged, as
an inſtance of Spenſer's weak and undiſcerning judgment, that he choſe
to follow Arioſto rather than Taſſo, the plan and conduct of whoſe poem
was much more regular and legitimate than that of his rival. To this objection
it may be anſwered, in defence of our author, that he was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
induced to follow that poem which was moſt celebrated and popular: for tho'
the French critics in general gave the preference to Taſſo, yet in Italy
the partiſans, on the ſide of Arioſto, were by far the moſt numerous,
and conſequently in England; for Italy, in the age of queen Elizabeth, gave
laws to our iſland in all matters of taſte, as France has done ever
ſince. It muſt, however, be confeſſed at the ſame time, that
Spenſer was in ſome meaſure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced, from the natural biaſs of his
mind, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that plan, which would admit of the moſt exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive range
for his unbounded imagination. What this plan is, and how it is conducted, we
ſhall now proceed to examine.</p>

               <note n="*" place="bottom">See Spenſer's letter
to Sir W. Raleigh, &amp;c.</note>The poet ſuppoſes, that the FAERIE QUEENE
held a magnificent feaſt, (according to annual cuſtom) which laſted
twelve days; on each of which reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, twelve ſeveral complaints are
preferred before her: accordingly, in order to redreſs the injuries which
were the occaſion of theſe ſeveral complaints, ſhe ſends out twelve
different knights, each of which, in the particular adventure allotted to him,
proves an example of ſome particular virtue, as of Holineſs, Temperance,
Juſtice, Chaſtity, &amp;c. and has one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete book aſſigned to him,
of which he is the hero. But, beſides theſe twelve knights, ſeverally
exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying twelve moral virtues, there is one principal knight, or general
hero, viz. PRINCE ARTHUR; who repreſents Magnificence; a virtue which is
ſuppoſed to be the perfection of all the reſt; who aſſiſts in
eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry book, the end of whoſe actions is to find out GLO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIANA, or Glory, and
in whoſe perſon the poet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to pourtray, 
<q rend="inline">"THE IMAGE OF A BRAVE KNIGHT PERFECTED IN THE
TWELVE PRIVATE MORAL VIRTUES."</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is evident, that our author, in eſtabliſhing one hero, who
ſeeking and attaining one grand end, viz. GLORIANA, or Glory, ſhould
exemplify one grand character, viz. that of a brave knight perfected in the
twelve private moral virtues, had the practice of Virgil and Homer in his eye.
But tho' he was ſenſible of the importance and expediency of a unity of the
hero and of his deſign, yet he does not, at the ſame time, ſeem convinced
of the neceſſity of that unity of action, by which this deſign ſhould
be properly accompliſhed; nor ſufficiently acquainted with the method of
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0143401900:8"/> made uſe of by the two great originals
above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, in conducting their reſpective heroes to the one grand end
propoſed. It may be aſked, with great propriety, how does ARTHUR execute
this one grand ultimate deſign? It may be anſwered, with no leſs
plauſibility, that by aſſiſting each patron of the twelve virtues
reſpectively, in his allotted defence or patronage of each, ARTHUR approaches
ſtill nearer and nearer to Glory, 'till at laſt he obtains it, and ſo
conſummates the intended grand deſign. But ſurely to aſſiſt only is
not ſufficient to gain this end, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete the propoſed character. The
poet ought to have made his ARTHUR the principal agent in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of
each particular wrong, which aroſe from the various violation of Holineſs,
Temperance, Juſtice, Chaſtity, &amp;c. If the hero had thus, in his own
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, exerted himſelf in the ſervice of all the twelve virtues, he
might have been deſervedly ſtiled the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect pattern of them all, and
conſequently would then have completed the propoſed grand end, viz. the
attainment of Glory. At preſent he is only a ſubordinate, or rather
acceſſory character; the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and obſtacles which he ſhould
have ſurmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in order to gain the propoſed end, are done to his hand,
and removed by others; it is not he who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers the dragon in the firſt
book, (to inſtance in no other) or who quells the magician Buſirane in the
third; theſe are atchievements executed by St. George and by Britomart. In
ſhort, the twelve ſeveral knights, or patrons, do too much for ARTHUR to do
any thing, or at leaſt what may reaſonably be expected from the plan of the
poet; while we are attending to <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0143401900:9"/> the deſign of the hero of
the book, we forget that of the hero of the poem. Mr. Dryden remarks, 
<q rend="inline">"We muſt do Spenſer that juſtice to
obſerve, that mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity [magnificence] which is the true cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of
PRINCE ARTHUR, ſhines throughout the whole poem; and ſuccours the reſt
when they are in diſtreſs."<note n="†" place="bottom">

                  </note>
               </q> If the magnanimity of PRINCE AR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THUR did in
reality ſhine throughout the whole poem with a ſteady and ſuperior
luſtre, our author would ſtand excuſed; but at preſent it breaks forth
but ſeldom, in dim and interrupted flaſhes; it is not like the pervading
ſpirit of Virgil, which

                  </l>
               </q> And to 
<q rend="inline">"ſuccour the reſt when they are in

a poem: "to ſuccour" is, in fact, a ſervice to be perform'd in the cauſe
of the hero, by ſome dependent and inferior chief, the buſineſs of a Gyas
or a Cloanthus, a Mneſtheus, or a Sereſtus.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, and in general, it muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that
Spenſer's adventures, which are the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of each ſingle book, have no
mutual dependance upon each other, and conſequenly do not contribute to
conſtitute one legitimate poem; and Mr. Hughes, not conſidering this, has
advanced a remark in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of Spenſer, which may moſt properly be
turned to his cenſure. 
<q rend="inline">"If we conſider the firſt book as an entire
work of itſelf, we ſhall find it to be no irregular contrivance: there is
one principal action, which is completed in the twelfth Canto, and the 
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0143401900:10"/> ſeveral incidents are proper, as they tend either to
obſtruct or promote it."<note n="*" place="bottom">

Queen. Hughes's edit. of Spenſer's works, vol. 1.</bibl>
                  </note>
               </q> As the
heroic poem is required to be one WHOLE, compounded of many various parts
depending upon, and relative to each other; ſo it is expedient, that not one
of thoſe parts ſhould be ſo regularly contriv'd, and ſo completely
finiſhed, as to become a WHOLE of itſelf. For the mind being thus once
ſatisfied in arriving at the completion of an orderly ſeries of events,
acquieſces in that ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and its attention and curioſity are
diverted from purſuing, with due vigour, the final and general cataſtrophe;
whereas while each part is left imperfect, I mean, incomplete, if disjoined or
ſeparated from the reſt, the mind ſtill deſirous and eager of
gratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its expectations, is irreſiſtibly and imperceptibly drawn on
from part to part, till it receives a full and ultimate ſatisfaction from the
accompliſhment of one great event, which all thoſe parts, following and
il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrating each other, contributed to produce.</p>
            <p>Our author was probably aware, that by conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting twelve
ſeveral adventures for twelve ſeveral knights, a want of continuity and
general concatena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of facts would be laid to his charge; and upon this
account, I ſuppoſe, he ſometimes begins a ſtory in one book, the
completion of which he defers, not without much interruption, to ſome future
and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant book; a proceeding, which unavoidably occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions much
confuſion to the reader. And it ſeems to be for the ſame reaſon, that,
after one of the twelve knights has fulfilled the adventure of his book, he
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduces <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0143401900:11"/> him, in the next book; acting, perhaps, in an
inferior light, and degraded to ſome leſs dangerous adventure; a conduct
which deſtroys that repoſe which the mind feels after having accompanied a
hero, thro' various diſtreſſes and difficulties, to ſucceſs and
victory. Beſides, when we view the hero entering upon an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior attempt,
our former admiration is diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; having ſeen him once nobly and
deciſively conquer, we become ſo warmly intereſted in his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that
we look upon his engagement in any po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterior enterpriſe (however
ſucceſsfully) which is leſs arduous than that of which we had juſt
before hail'd him the conqueror, as derogatory to that glory which he had
juſt acquired by ſuch a conqueſt. Spenſer, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, would have
embaraſſed himſelf and the reader leſs, had he made every book one
entire detached poem, without any the leaſt reference to the reſt. Thus he
would have written twelve diſtinct poems, in all of which, he might have
completed the pattern of a particular virtue in twelve knights reſpectively;
at preſent, he has remarkably failed in endeavouring to repreſent all the
virtues completed in the character of one. The poet muſt either have
eſtabliſhed TWELVE KNIGHTS without an ARTHUR, or an ARTHUR without TWELVE
KNIGHTS. Upon ſuppoſition that Spenſer was reſolved to characteriſe
the twelve moral virtues, the former plan, perhaps, would have been beſt: the
latter muſt neceſſarily want ſimplicity, as it is an action
conſiſting of twelve actions, all equally great, and unconnected between
themſelves; and not an action conſiſting of one uninterrupted and
coherent chain of incidents tending to the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of one
deſign.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0143401900:12"/>It has been obſerv'd before, that our author
endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to expreſs the character of a knight perfected in the twelve
moral virtues, by repreſenting him as aſſiſting in the ſervice or
defence of each, till at laſt he becomes poſſeſſed of all: this plan,
however, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicious, he certainly was obliged to obſerve; but in the third
book, which is ſtiled the legend of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity, PRINCE ARTHUR doth not ſo
much as lend his aſſiſtance in the protection or vindication of that
virtue; he appears indeed, but not as an auxiliary in the adventure of the
book.</p>
            <p>It muſt, however, be confeſſed, that there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
artificial in the poet's manner of varying from hiſtorical preciſion; a
conduct which may be beſt il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated from his own words. 
<q rend="inline">"But becauſe the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the whole work
ſeemeth abrupt, and as depending upon other antecedents, it needs that ye
know the occaſion of theſe three knights ſeveral adventures. For the
method of a poet hiſtorical, is not ſuch as of an hiſtoriographer. For an
hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographer diſcourſeth of affairs orderly, as they were done,
accounting as well the times as the action; but a poet thruſteth into the
middeſt, even where it moſt concerneth him, and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing to the
things forepaſt, and divining of things to come, maketh a pleaſing
analyſis of all. The beginning therefore of my hiſtory, were it to be told
by an hiſtoriographer, ſhould be in the twelfth book, which is the laſt;
where I deviſe, that the FAERIE QUEENE held her annual feaſt twelve days;
upon which twelve ſeveral days, the occaſion of twelve ſeveral adventures
hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened: <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0143401900:13"/> which being undertaken by twelve ſeveral

It appears, from this quotation, that Spenſer had finiſhed but three books,
when this letter was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</note>"</q> Thus according to this plan the
reader would have been agreeably ſurpriſed, in the laſt book, when he
came to diſcover, that all the adventures which he had juſt gone through,
were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken at the command of the FAERIE QUEENE, and that all the knights
had ſeverally ſet forward to the execution of them from her annual
birth-day feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val; but Spenſer, in moſt of his books, has
inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly foreſtalled the firſt of theſe particulars; which
certainly ſhould have been concealed till the laſt book, not only to have
prevented a needleſs repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of the ſame thing, but that he might

Orlando Furioſo. Though there is no general unity in the former, yet if we
conſider every book or adventure as a ſeparate poem, we ſhall meet with
ſo many diſtinct, however imperfect, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, by which means the reader is
leſs bewildered, than by that general indigeſted medley of which the former
totally conſiſts, and in which we meet with neither partial, nor

               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0143401900:14"/> The very idea of celebrating the MADNESS of an hero,
carries with it ſomewhat extravagant and abſurd. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lando doth not make his
appearance till b. 8. where he is placed in a ſituation not very heroic; he
is firſt diſcovered to us in bed, deſiring to ſleep. His ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
deſign is to find Angelica, but his purſuit of her is broken off in b. 30;
after which there are ſixteen more books to come, and in which Angelica
diſappears. Other heroes are likewiſe engaged in the ſame purſuit.
After reading the firſt ſtanza of b. 1. one would be inclined to think,
that the ſubject of the poem was the expedition of the Moors into France,
under their emperor Agramante, to fight againſt Charlemayne; but this matter
is the leaſt part of the poem. In fact, many of the knights perform exploits
equal, if not ſuperior to thoſe of Orlando; and particularly Rogero, with a
grand atchievement of wholn the poem is cloſed, viz. his killing Rodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont;
but this event is not the completion of a ſtory carried on principally
through the whole work. The author paſſes from one incident to another, and
from region to region (whether it be from England to the Heſperides, or from
the earth to the moon) with ſuch incredible ſwiftneſs and rapidity, that
one would think he was mounted upon his own winged ſteed Ippogrifo. He begins
a tale of a knight in Europe, and ſuddenly breaks it off to reſume the
unfiniſhed cataſtrophe of another in Aſia. The imagination of the reader
is not ſo much involv'd in, as it is oppreſſed with the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of
ſtories, in the relation of each of which the poet is at the ſame time
equally engaged. To reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy this inconvenience, it was thought proper to affix,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0143401900:15"/> in ſome of the editions, marginal hints, informing the
reader in what book and ſtanza the poet would recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence ſome interrupted
epiſode; an expedient not more inartificial than that which the firſt
painters were obliged to make uſe of, in order to aſſiſt their want of
ſkill, who having drawn the figure of a man, a bird, or a quadruped, found it
neceſſary to write under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the name of the kind to which the thing
repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented belonged. However, this method has been the means of giving the
reader a clear comprehenſion of Arioſto's tales, which otherwiſe he could
not have obtained without much difficulty. This poet is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom read twice in
order; that is, by paſſing from the firſt canto to the ſecond, and from
the ſecond to the reſt ſucceſſively; but by perſuing (without any
regard to the order of the books, or the ſtanzas) the different ſtories,
which though all ſomewhere finiſh'd, yet are, at preſent, ſo mutually
interwoven, that the incidents of one are perpetually claſhing with thoſe
of another. The ingenious Abbé Du Bos

            <head>SECT. II. Of Spenſer's Imitations from old Romances.</head>
            <p>ALthough Spenſer formed his FAERIE QUEENE upon the fanciful plan
of Arioſto, as I remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the preceding ſection, yet it muſt be
confeſſed, that the adventures of Spenſer's knights are a more exact and
immediate copy of thoſe which we meet with in old romances, or books of
chivalry, than they are of thoſe of which the Orlando Furioſo conſiſts.
Arioſto's knights exhibit very ſurpriſing inſtances of their proweſs,
and atchieve many heroic actions; but our author's knights are more
particularly engaged in revenging injuries, and doing juſtice to the
diſtreſſed; which was the proper buſineſs, and ultimate end of the
antient knight-errantry. And thus though many of Spenſer's incidents and
expedients are to be found in Arioſto, ſuch as that of blowing a horn, at
the ſound <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0143401900:17"/> of which the gates of a caſtle fly open, of
the vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an enchanted palace or garden, after ſome knight has
deſtroyed the enchanter, and the like, yet theſe are not more peculiarly
the property of Ario<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſto, than they are common to all antient romances in
general. Spenſer's firſt book is, indeed, a regular and preciſe imitation
of ſuch a ſeries of action as we frequently meet with in books of chivalry:
For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, a king's daughter applies to a knight, that he would relieve
her father and mother, who are cloſely confined to their caſtle, upon
account of a vaſt and terrible dragon, that had ravaged their country, and
perpetually laid in wait to deſtroy them. The knight ſets forward with the
lady, encounters a monſter in the way, is plotted againſt by an enchanter,
and after ſurmounting a variety of difficulties and obſtacles, arrives at
the country which is the ſcene of the dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon's devaſtations, kills him,
and is preſented to the king and queen, whom he has juſt delivered;
mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries their daughter, but is ſoon obliged to leave her, on account of
fulfilling a former vow. It may be likewiſe obſerved, that the
circumſtance of each of Spenſer's twelve knights, ſetting out from one
place, by a different way, to perform a different adventure, exactly
reſembles that of the ſeven knights proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forwards to their ſeveral
expeditions, in the well-known romance, entitled the Seven Champions of
Chriſtendom. In fact, theſe miraculous books were highly faſhionable, and
that chivalry, which was the ſubject of them, was ſtill practiced, in the
age of queen Elizabeth.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Hollingſhead's

MORTE ARTHUR, <hi>The Lyf of Kyng Arthur, of his noble Knyghtes of the round

by W. Caxton, 1484<note n="*" place="bottom">This Book has been reprinted twice

hiſtory our author has borrow'd many of his names, viz. Sir Triſtram,
Placidas, Pelleas, Pellenore, Percivall, and others. As to Sir Triſtram, he
has copied from this book the circumſtances of his birth and education with
much exactneſs. Spenſer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us that Sir Triſtram was born in

            <p>As Spenſer has copied many other fictions from MORTE ARTHUR, I
apprehend that he drew this from thence, and not from Geoffrey of Monmouth; not
to mention, that Spenſer's circumſtances tally more exactly with thoſe in

            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0143401900:24"/>There is great reaſon to conclude, not only
from what has already been mention'd concerning Spenſer's imitations from
this romantic hiſtory of king Arthur and his knights, but from ſome
circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which I ſhall now produce, that it was a favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite and
reigning romance about the age of queen Elizabeth; or at leaſt one very well
known and much read at that time. Spenſer in the Shepherd's Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar has the

            <p>Upon the words LADIES OF THE LAKE, E. K. the old commentator on
the paſtorals has the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing remark. 
<q rend="inline">"LADIES OF THE LAKE be nymphes: for it was an old
opinion among the antient Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, that of every ſpring and fountaine was a
goddeſſe the ſoveraine; which opinion ſtucke in the minds of men not
many years ſince by meanes of certain fine fablers, or looſe lyers; ſuch
as were the authors of KING ARTHUR the great.—Who tell many an unlawfull

lyers, are the authors of the romance above-mention'd, viz. MORTE ARTHUR, where
many miracles are brought about, and much enchantment is carried on by the
means and interpoſition of the LADY OF THE LAKE. Now <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0143401900:25"/> it
ſhould be obſerved, that the LADY OF THE LAKE was introduc'd to make part

<q>

            </p>
            <p>She is afterwards introduc'd complaining to the queen, that ſir
Bruſe had inſulted her for doing an injury to Merlin, (an incident related
in MORTE ARTHUR); and that he would have put her to death had not Neptune
deliver'd her, by concealing her in that lake; from which confinement the queen
is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſuppos'd to deliver her, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Without expatiating upon the nature of ſuch a royal
entertainment as this, I ſhall obſerve from it that the LADY OF THE LAKE
(and conſequently the romance which ſupply'd this fiction) was a very
po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular character in the reign of queen Elizabeth; and we may add, that it is
not improbable that Spenſer might allude in the above-cited verſes to
ſome of the circumſtances in this part of the queen's entertainment; for
queen Eliſabeth, the Fayre Eliſa, is the lady whom the LADIES OF LAKE are
repreſented as repairing to, <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0143401900:27"/> in that eclogue<note n="*" place="bottom">Spenſer's paſtorals were publiſhed about four years after
this entertainment.</note>. Nor is it improbable that this lady was often
exhibited upon other occaſions. Nor is it improper to remark in this place
that Ben. Johnſon has introduced her, together with king Arthur and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,
in an entertainment before the court of James I. called PRINCE HENRIES
BARRIERS.</p>
            <p>The above antient letter acquaints us, that the queen was
entertain'd with a ſong from this romance, which is another proof of it's
popularity at that time. 
<q rend="inline">"A minſtrall came forth with a ſollem ſong
warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſtory out of king Arthur's acts the firſt book, 24. whereof
I gat a copy, and that is this,

                     <l>"So it fell out on a pentecoſt day</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This is the ſong above hinted at, where mention is made of king
Rience demanding the beard of king Arthur. In the ſame letter a gentleman who
ſhew'd ſome particular feats of activity before the queen, is ſaid to be 
<q rend="inline">"very cunning in fens, and hardy as Gawen."</q>
Which Gawen was king Arthur's ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, and whoſe atchievements are highly

               </q> The HOLY GRAYLE, that is the real
blood of our bleſſed Saviour. What Spenſer here writes GRALE, is often
written SANGREAL, or <hi>St. grale</hi> in MORTE AR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THUR, and is there ſaid
to have been brought into England by Joſeph of Arimathea. Many of king
Arthur's knights are there repreſented as going in queſt, or in ſearch of
the SANGREAL, or SANGUIS REALIS. This expedition was one of the firſt
ſubjects of the old romance.</p>
            <p>This romance ſeems to have extended its reputation beyond the

            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:0143401900:41"/>As to Spenſer's original and genealogy of
the Fairy nation, I am induc'd to believe, that part of it was ſupply'd by
his own inexhauſtible imagination, and part by ſome fabulous hiſtory. He
tells us, B. ii. c. 10. S. 70. that man, as firſt made by Prometheus, was
called ELFE, who wandring through the world, at laſt arriv'd at the gardens
of Adonis, where he found a female, whom he called FAY; that the iſſue of
theſe two were called Fairies, who ſoon grew to be a mighty people, and
conquer'd all nations. That their eldeſt ſon Elfin govern'd America, and
the next to him, named Elfinan, founded the city of Cleopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, which was
enclos'd with a golden wall by Elfiline. That his ſon Elfine overcome the
Gobbelines; but that, of all Fairies, Elfant was moſt renowned, who built
Panthea of Cryſtall.—To theſe ſucceeded Elfar, who kill'd two
brethren-giants; and to him Elfinor, who built a bridge of glaſs over the
ſea, the ſound of which was like thunder. At length Elficleos rul'd the
Fairy land with much wiſdom, and highly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd its honour: he left two
ſons, the eldeſt of which, fair Elferon, died an immature death, and
whoſe place was ſupply'd by the mighty Oberon, whoſe wide memorial
(continues our author) ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, and who dying, left Tanaquil to
ſucceed him by will, who is likewiſe called Glorian, or GLORIANA.</p>
            <p>In the circumſtance of Elfinel, who overcame the Gobbelines, he
plainly alludes to the faction of the Guelfes and Gibbelines in Italy; and his
friend and commentator E. K. remarks,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Eclogue,

               </note> that our Elfes and <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0143401900:42"/> Goblins were
deriv'd from thoſe two parties Guelfes and Gibelines. But in the latter part
of this relation, under the fictitious names of theſe ideal beings, he has
adumbrated ſome of our Engliſh princes. Elficleos is king Henry VII,
whoſe eldeſt ſon Arthur died at ſixteen years of age; and whoſe
youngeſt ſon Oberon, that is, Henry VIII, ſucceeded to the crown,
marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, about the ſame time, his brother Arthur's wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, the princeſs
Katherine; which is what Spenſer more particularly hints at in theſe lines,

<q> 
                  <l>Whoſe emptie place the mighty Oberon,</l> 
                  <l>Doubly ſupply'd in SPOUSALL and DOMINION.</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame of this king was very recent in our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's age.</p>
            <p>It is remarkable that Spenſer ſays nothing of Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward VI. and
queen Mary, who reigned between Henry VIII. and queen Elizabeth, but that he
paſſes immediately from Oberon to Tanaquill, or GLORI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ANA, i. e. queen
Elizabeth, who was excluded from her right by thoſe two intermediate reigns. 
<q> 
                  <l>He dying left the faireſt Tanaquill,</l> 
                  <l>Him to ſucceed there by his laſt will:</l> 
                  <l>Fairer and nobler liveth none this howre.</l>

            </p>
            <p>And the reader may obſerve, that there is much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs and
art in the poet's manner of making this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. There is ſo much
confuſion in Spenſer's <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0143401900:43"/> ſeries of this fairy people,
that it is difficult to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, whether or no he has here allegoriſed any
o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Engliſh reign. However in Elfant who laid the foundation of Cleopolis,
he may ſignify king Lud, as it appears, by another place, that Cleopolis is
London, 
<q> 
                  <l>Till now, ſaid then the knight, I weened well,</l> 
                  <l>That great Cleopolis where I have been,</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The faireſt FAERIE QUEENE is queen Elizabeth: and by the lines
that immediately follow, it ſhould ſeem that Panthea is the queen's palace,

<q> 
                  <l>—The faireſt citie was that might be ſeene,</l> 
                  <l>And that bright towr all built of cryſtall cleene,</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But this idea of the cryſtall tower, and of the gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en wall,
and bridge of glaſs, &amp;c. mention'd above, ſeem to be ſome romantic
tradition. As to his FAE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIE QUEENE, the notion of ſuch a perſonage was
very common; Chaucer in his Rime of Sir Thopas ſpeaks of her, together with a
fairy land; and Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpere who was univerſally converſant in popular
ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, has introduc'd her in his Midſummer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night's Dream. She was
ſuppos'd to have held her court in the higheſt magnificence in the days of
king Arthur, a circumſtance by which the happineſs of that reign was
originally repreſented in the romantic annals of it.</p>

hiſtory and mythology.</head>
            <p>AS Spenſer ſought to produce ſurpriſe by extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
incidents, and fantaſtic deſcriptions, the mythology of the antients
afforded matter no leſs co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious than ſuitable for ſuch a deſign. He
has ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly adopted ſome of their moſt romantic fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in many of
which he has departed from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived tradition, as his purpoſe and
ſubject required. And, indeed, with regard to our author's
miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the fables of antiquity, it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that
from thoſe arguments which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced <pb n="45" facs="tcp:0143401900:48"/> againſt his
fidelity, new ones may be drawn in favour of his fancy. Spenſer's native
force of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention would not permit him to purſue the letter of preſcribed
fiction with tame regularity and ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous exactneſs. In many particulars
he varies from antiquity merely that he may introduce new beauties, and
frequently mentions one or two circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of antient fable, not ſo much
with a deſign of adorning his poem with them, as of taking an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
from them, of raiſing a new fiction of his own. He ſometimes, indeed,
miſrepreſents theſe matters through haſte; his alluſions to antient
hiſtory are likewiſe very frequent, which in many inſtances he has not
ſcrupled to violate, with equal freedom, and for the ſame reaſons.

us, that Envy was found eating the fleſh of vipers, which is not much unlike
Spenſer's picture. But our author has heighten'd this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to a
moſt diſguſting degree; for he adds, that the poyſon ran about her jaw.
This is, perhaps, one of the moſt loathſom ideas that Spenſer has given
us, though he paints very ſtrongly (as Jortin obſerves) B. i. i. 20.

31. and 7. 7. 40. In reality, the ſtrength of our author's imagination could
not be ſuppreſs'd or kept in on any ſubject, and in ſome meaſure it
is owing to the fullneſs of his ſtanza, and the frequency of his rhymes,
that he has deſcrib'd theſe diſagreeable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſo minutely. But to
return to his Envy. This perſonage is again introduc'd, 5. 12. 29. chawing a

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>It may be urg'd, that Spenſer drew the thought of her throwing
the Snake at him, from Alecto's attack upon Amata.

            <p>But Spenſer's application of this thought, is ſurely a much
greater effort of invention than the thought itſelf. The malignity both of
Envy, and of her Snake, <pb n="49" facs="tcp:0143401900:52"/> could not have been expreſt is
more ſignificant ſtrokes; tho' the ſnake was her conſtant food, yet
ſhe was tempted to deprive herſelf of ſuſtenance, that ſhe might
caſt it at him; and tho' the ſnake by being thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly fed upon was

is indeed ingenious; and to his defence of it he might have added, that Milton,
in one of his juvenile Latin poems, has ſhewn his knowledge of this
mythological point, viz. 
<q> 
                  <l>Nox <hi>ſenis amplexus</hi> EREBI <hi>taciturna

            </p>
            <p>After all, it is not improbable but that Milton might write
CERBERUS: full of the idea of the loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſs of melancholy, he ſeems
to have choſen out the moſt deteſtable parents for her that his
imagination could ſuggeſt, CERBERUS and MIDNIGHT; and it ſhould be
obſerved, that he does not ſay Midnight ſimply, but <hi>blackeſt
Midnight,</hi> an epithet by which he ſtrongly marks out his abhorrence of
the offspring of ſo foul a pair, and the conſiſtency and propriety of her
being leagu'd with Cerberus.</p>

            <p>It is obſervable, that this little poem of Milton, as containing
a council, conſpiracy, and attempt of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, may look'd upon as an early
preluſion of his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius to the ſubject of the paradiſe loſt.

                  <l>And in the midſt thereof a ſilver ſeat</l> 
                  <l>With a thick arbour, &amp;c.</l> 
                  <l>Next thereunto did growe a goodly tree.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>On this tree, he adds, grew golden apples; and that from this
likewiſe ſprung the tree of the Heſperides; but theſe circumſtances,
as alſo that of Proſerpina's garden, &amp;c. is, I think, not to be
juſtified from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient writers. He afterwards informs us, that the gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
apples by which Acontius won Cydippe, and that which Ate threw among the Gods,
were gather'd from <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0143401900:59"/> this tree: but theſe, as we learn
from many paſſages in the Claſſics, were the produce of the Heſperian
tree abovemention'd. He then tells us, that the branches of this tree
overſpread the river Cocytus, in which Tantalus was plung'd up to the chin,
who was perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually catching at its fruit, in which he copies Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, in
ſome meaſure; who acquaints us, that many trees of delicious fruit wav'd
over the lake in which Tantalus was plac'd; but it does not appear, from him,
that Tantalus was fix'd in Cocytus, but in ſome lake peculiarly appropriated
to his puniſhment.

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Spenſer has alſo made another uſe of Cocytus, viz. that the
ſhores of Cocytus perpetually reſounded with the ſhrieks of damned
ghoſts, who underwent an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting puniſhment by being dipt in its
waters. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cytus, indeed, ſays antient fable, muſt be paſt, before there
is any poſſibility of arriving at the infernal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions; but we do not
find, that it was a puniſhment allotted to any of the ghoſts, to be thus
plung'd into its waves; nor that this circumſtance was the cauſe of the
cries which echoed around its banks.</p>
            <p>What he has invented of Cocytus, exhibits a fine image: he
ſuppoſes, that when Sir Guyon came to this river, 
<q> 
                  <l>—He clomb up to the bank</l> 
                  <l>And looking downe ſawe many damned wights</l>

            <p>The antients tell us, that the golden apple, for which the
goddeſſes ſtrove on mount Ida, was pluck'd in the garden of the
Heſperides; but Spenſer's allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing imagination feigns, that it grew
in hell. He might probably receive the hint of this tree with the golden apples
from Homer's mention of various trees which grew in hell, near the lake of
Tantalus, hinted at above; but the ſilver ſtool beneath it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely his
own, which Mammon perſuades the knight to ſeat himſelf upon, and is A NEW

was a name for Diana, viz.

nurſe of Scylla, and from whom our <pb n="61" facs="tcp:0143401900:64"/> author has copied his
Glauce, Britomart's nurſe, in the Canto mentioned above. She was called
Dictyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, becauſe ſhe invented nets for hunting, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo one
of Diana's names, Britomartis and Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na were look'd upon as the ſame.
Callimachus ſpeaks of her as one of the nymphs of Diana's train, but
obſerves, that ſhe was called by the Cydonians, Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynna. He has left us
the hiſtory of Britomartis in his hymn to Diana.

Adonis, 
<q> 
                  <l>In that ſame garden all the goodly flowres,</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In his deſcription of this garden he might probably have an eye
to the notion of the antients concerning Adonis, that he repreſented the
ſun which quickens the growth of all things. Thus Orpheus, in his Hymn to
Adonis,

               </q> Others
repreſent him as the ſeed of wheat. Thus the ſcholiaſt of Theocritus,
after having informed us, that Adonis after his death remained ſix months in
the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of Venus, and ſix months with Proſerpine.

            <p>Cupid was repreſented by the antients with parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour'd wings,
as we learn (among others) from this paſſage quoted by Mr. Jortin, from an
epigram aſcrib'd to Virgil, 
<q>

               </q> But
this pictureſque circumſtance was probably ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd by our author's
fancy. In the Paſtorals, March, he draws Cupid after the ſame manner, 
<q> 
                  <l>With that ſprung forth a naked ſwaine</l>

criticiſm, Scaliger has great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly betray'd his ignorance of the nature of
antient Poeſy, and of the character of Orpheus. 
<q rend="inline">"In the early ages of the Grecian ſtate

with an awe of ſuperior and irreſiſtible powers, and a liking to ſocial
life. They wanted a mythology to lead them by fear and dread (the only holds to
be taken of a rude multitude) into a feeling of natural cauſes, and their

highly conſiſtent, in attributing a ſong to Orpheus, whoſe ſubject

to be defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without conſidering the character of Orpheus. The occaſion
of this ſong was a quarrel among the Argonauts, whom Orpheus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to

The Titans were indeed thrown into Tartarus, but it could not be ſaid, from
thence, that the Titans were her parents; tho' this, I preſume, was the
beſt argument that our author had for his genealogy. In this ſtanza Bellona
is likewiſe feigned to be the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of the Titans; but Bellona was the
ſiſter of Mars, who was the ſon of Jupiter and Juno; or, as Ovid reports,
of Juno alone.</p>

author was induced to make choice of it (with the addition of one line) from
the example of Taſſo and Arioſto, who were the moſt faſhionable poets
of his age. But Spenſer, in making this choice of his ſtanza, ſeems not
ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently to have conſider'd the genius of the Engliſh language,
which will not eaſily admit of that more frequent repetition of the ſame

circumſtance not difficult in the Italian, which deals largely in identical
cadences.<note n="†" place="bottom">I am obliged to the admirable author

                  <item>I. It neceſſitated him to dilate the thing to be
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt, however unimportant, with trifling and inſipid circumlocutions,
viz.

words, viz.

we may venture to affirm, that the fullneſs and ſignificancy of Spenſer's
deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is often owing to the prolixity of his ſtanza, and the
multitude of his rhymes. The diſcerning reader is deſired to conſider the
following ſtanza as an inſtance of what is here advanced. Guyon is binding
Furor. 
<q>

                  <l>And hundred knots, which did him ſore conſtraine;</l>

                  <l>Stared full wide, and threw forth ſparkes of fire;</l> 
                  <l>And more for ranke deſpight, than for great paine,</l>

            <p>Dryden, I think, ſomewhere remarks, that rhyme often helped him
to a thought; an obſervation, which, probably, Spenſer's experience had
likewiſe ſupplied him with: Spenſer, however, muſt have found more
convenience, in this reſpect, from writing in rhyme, than Dryden, in
proportion as the ſtanza of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer obliged him to a more repeated uſe
of it.</p>
            <p>In ſpeaking of Spenſer's rhyme, it ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark'd, that
he often new-ſpells a word to make it rhyme more preciſely. Take theſe

We find in many paſſages of our author the orthography violated, when the

oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur often in Harrington's Arioſto, and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of the word
<hi>ſaid,</hi> which is often occaſionally written SED. This practice was
continued as far down as the age of Milton.

<note n="*" place="bottom"> 
                  <p>The author of the Viſions of PIERCE PLOWMAN is Roberte
Longelande, or Langelande, according to Bale, Script. Brit. Cent. 6. 37. &amp;
Wood, Hiſt. &amp; Antiq. Univ. Oxon. B. 2. pag. 106. who likewiſe calls him
Malverne. It is plain that his poem, called the VISIONS of P. PLOWMAN, was
publiſh'd after the Year 1350, from this paſſage in it, 
<q> 
                        <l>In Date of our bryghte, in a drye Apriell</l>

                        <bibl>Paſſ. 13.</bibl>
                     </q> So that ſeveral of Gower's
and Chaucer's pieces made their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance before it. It is divided into
twenty parts (PASSUS, as he ſtyles them;) and conſiſts of many diſtinct
viſions, which have no mutual dependance upon each other; ſo that the poem
is not a regular and uniform whole, conſiſting of one action or deſign.
The author ſeems to have intended it as a ſatire on almoſt every
occupation of life, but more particularly on the clergy; in cenſuring whom,
Wickliff had led the way not many years before. This piece abounds with humour,
ſpirit, and imagination; all which are dreſt to great diſadvantage in a
very uncouth verſification, and obſolete language. It ſeems to be written
without rhyme, an ornament which the poet has endeavour'd to ſupply, by
making every verſe to conſiſt of words beginning with the ſame letter.
This practice has contributed not a little to render his poem obſcure and
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex'd, excluſive of its obſolete ſtyle; for to introduce his
allitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he muſt have been often neceſſarily compell'd to depart
from the natural and more obvious way of expreſſing himſelf. The learned
Dr. Hickes obſerves, that this alliterative verſification was drawn by
Langland from the practice of the Saxon poets, and that theſe viſions
abound with many Saxoniſms.

                     </q> From this it appears,

of their native tongue, by naturaliz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many new words from the Latin, French,

of a brook; where, in a viſion, he ſees a ſtately tower upon a hill, with
a dungeon, and dark diſmal ditches belonging to it, and a very deep dale
under the hill. Before the tower a large field or plain is ſuppoſed, filled
with men of every rank and occupation, all being reſpectively engag'd in
their ſeveral purſuits; when ſuddenly a beautifull lady appears to him,
and unravels to him the myſtery of what he had ſeen."</q>

                     </q> In theſe
verſes there is a manifeſt contradiction; for the poet ſays, that the SUN
was SETT, and that it was a MAY-MORNING. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it is plain, that in the

falling aſleep, are diſtinctly deſcrib'd; before one of them in

ſatire is carried on by means of ſeveral allegoric perſonages, ſuch as
MEDE, SIMONY, CONSCIENCE, SLOTH, &amp;c. The learned Selden (notes on Polyolb.

an old book called the SHEP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HEARD'S KALENDER, firſt printed by Wynkin a 
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0143401900:95"/> Worde, and reprinted about twenty years before our author

<q rend="inline">"He tearmeth it the SHEPHERD's KALENDER, applying

               </note>, 
<q rend="inline">"who was privie to all his deſigns",</q> E. K. 
<q rend="inline">"In myne opinion, ſays he, it is one eſpeciall

which is the onely cauſe that our mother-tongue, which truly of itſelfe is
both ful enough for proſe, and ſtately enough for verſe, hath long time
beene counted moſt bare and barren of both; which default, when as ſome
have endevored <pb n="93" facs="tcp:0143401900:96"/> to ſalve and recure, they patched up the
holes with peeces and ragges of other languages; borrowing here of the French,
there of the Italian, and every where of the Latine; not weighing how ill
thoſe tongues accord with themſelves, but much worſe with ours; ſo now
they have made our Engliſhe tongue a gallimaufrey, or hodge-podge of all
other ſpeeches."</q> Thus that which induced Spenſer to adopt ſo much
obſolete language in the Paſtorals, induced him likewiſe to do the ſame
in the FAERIE QUEENE. Hence it is manifeſt, that he was diſguſted with
the practice of his cotemporary writers, who had adulterated, according to his
judgement, the purity of the Britiſh tongue by various innovations from the
Spaniſh, French, Latin, and Italian. And that this was the caſe in the age
of Queen Elizabeth will appear from the following paſſages. Thus Marſton
in his ſatires.

premis'd, that the cunning and rapacious Jew is repreſented, in our ballad,
to have lent an eminent merchant of Venice an hundred crowns, upon a bond, in
which promiſe of payment is made within a year and a day; under the
forfeiture of a pound of the merchant's fleſh, in caſe of non-payment; that
the merchant, on account of his ſhips being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by adverſe winds, was
unable to perform his contract at the time appointed; that the affair was
referr'd to a judge; that the friends of the merchant offer'd ten thouſand
crowns to abſolve him, but that the Jew obſtinately perſiſted in his
demand of the forfeited pound of fleſh.

reſulting from the ſubject.</p> 
                  <p>It may be objected, that this ballad might have been written
after, and copied from, Shakeſpere's play. But if that had been the caſe,
it is moſt likely that the author would have preſerved Shakeſpere's name
of Shylock for the Jew; and nothing is more likely, than that Shakeſpere in
copying from this ballad, ſhould alter the name from Gernutus to one more
Jewiſh; and by the alteration of the name his imitation was the better
diſguiſed. Another argument (which would have appeared much more
convincing, had the whole ſong been tranſcrib'd, but which perhaps will be
allowed from this extract) is, that our ballad has the air of a narrative
written before Shakeſpere's play; I mean, that, if it had been written after
the play, it would have been much more full and circumſtantial: At preſent,
it has too much the nakedneſs of an original. Beſides, the firſt ſtanza
informs us, that the ſtory was taken from ſome Italian novel. Thus much
therefore is certain, that is, Shakeſpere either copied from that Italian
novel, or from this ballad: Now we have no tranſlation, I preſume, of
ſuch a novel into Engliſh; if then it be granted that Shakeſpere
generally took his Italian ſtories from their Engliſh tranſlations, and
that the arguments above, concerning the prior antiquity of this ballad are
true, it will follow that Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpere copied from this ballad.</p> 
                  <p>I ſhall only add, that it appears from S. Goſſon's
Schoole of Abuſe, printed 1579; that the character of a cruell and covetous
Jewe had been exhibited with good applauſe before Shakeſpere's Shylock
appear'd. The author is commending ſome plays, and among the reſt, 
<q rend="inline">"The JEWE and Ptolome ſhewne at the bull;
the one repreſenting the greedineſſe of wordly chuſers, and bloudy

intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, and accordingly they will generally be found at the end of his
lines. Thus the poverty of our tongue (or rather the unfrequency of identical
termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations in it) often compelled him for the ſake of rhyme, to coin new
Engliſh words, ſuch as damni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd, unmercify'd, wonderment, warriment,
unruli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, habitaunce, hazardrie, &amp;c. &amp;c. To this cauſe his many

                  </l>
               </q> Spenſer, perhaps, in having
given us this minute and particular enumeration of various trees, has incurred
a ſmaller ſhare of cenſure than ſome of the Roman authors mentioned
above. In ſome of them, indeed, ſuch a deſcription will be found
ſuperfluous and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent; but, upon this occaſion, it is highly
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent, and, indeed, expedient, that the poet ſhould dwell, for
ſome time, on the beauty of this grove, in deſcribing its variety of trees,
as that circumſtance tends to draw the red-croſs knight and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
farther and farther into the ſhade, 'till at length <pb n="102" facs="tcp:0143401900:105"/>
they are imperceptibly invited to the cave of error, which ſtood in the
thickeſt part of it: in ſhort, this deſcription is ſo far from being
puerile, or ill-placed, that it ſerves to improve, and help out the allegory.
But notwithſtanding this may be affirm'd, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of Spenſer, yet
I am apt to think, that the impropriety of introducing ſuch a deſcription,
would not have appear'd a ſufficient reaſon to our poet, why he ſhould
not have admitted it; for his judgment was ſo greatly overwhelm'd by his
imagination, that he could never neglect the opportunity of a good

not inferior (if not equal) to Drayton, and others of the next rank to SPENSER;
but they are all to be produced in MSS. namely, his POETICAL VISION, his ALARM

               </q> But we are told, in the gloſſary to
Chaucer, (Urry's edit.) that this word, among other ſenſes, ſignifies,
<hi>to dare, to attempt.</hi> Thus, by a gradual detortion, and by an

length, attains a meaning en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely foreign to its original etymology.</p>
            <p>Spenſer's frequent uſe of DARRAINE ſeems to have ſomewhat
familiaris'd it in Queen Elizabeth's age. We meet with it in Shakeſpere, who
probably drew it from our author.

it muſt be confeſs'd, that moſt of our old Engliſh writers frequently

thoſe only which carry with them a more certain and undoubted evidence of
their being immediately derived from Chaucer. Thus here are ſeveral old old
words unnoticed, which appear likewiſe in Chau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer; but which are no more the
property of him, than they are of Lidgate, of Gower, and of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of
Piers Plowman; ſo that it would be difficult in ſome caſes to aſcertain
and mark out the particular ſource from which our author drew; however it is
manifeſt that he had the moſt frequent recourſe to, and drew the
largeſt draughts from Chaucer,

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot diſmiſs this ſection without a wiſh, that this
neglected author whom Spenſer propoſed in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as the pattern
of his language, and to whom he is not a little indebted for many noble
ſtrokes of poetry ſhould be more univerſally and attentively ſtudied.
Chau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer ſeems to be regarded rather as an old poet, than as a good one, and
that he wrote Engliſh verſes four hundred years ago ſeems more frequently
to be urged in his commendation, than that he wrote four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years ago
with taſte and judgment. We look upon his poems rather as venerable relics,
than as finiſh'd patterns; as pieces calculated rather to gratify the
antiquarian than the critic. When I ſate down to read Chaucer with the
curioſity of knowing how the firſt Engliſh poet wrote, I left him with
the ſatisfaction of having found what later and more refin'd ages could
hardly equal in true humour, pathos, or ſublimity. It muſt 
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0143401900:145"/> be confeſt that his uncouth or rather unfamiliar
lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage has deterr'd many from peruſing him; but at the ſame time it
muſt be allowed, that nothing has more contributed to his being little looked
into, than the convenient opportunity of reading him with faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in modern
imitations. Thus when tranſlation (for ſuch may imitations from Chaucer be
call'd) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſubſtituted as the means of attaining the knowledge of any
difficult and antient author, the original not only begins to be neglected and
excluded as leſs eaſy, but alſo to be deſpiſed as leſs ornamental
and elegant. And thus tho' Mr. Pope's tranſlation of Homer is perhaps the
beſt that ever was made of any author, yet it has ſo far indulg'd the
lazineſs or illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teracy of many readers, as to tempt them to acquieſce in
the knowledge of Homer acquir'd by it, as ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; and thus many have
preferr'd that tranſlation to the Graecian text, in proportion as the former
contains more frequent and more ſhining metaphors, more lively
deſcriptions, and in general appears to be more full, elaborate, and
various.</p>

            <p>It has been before remark'd, that Spenſer in his BLATANT BEAST
had ſome reference to the ſtory of the <hi>queſting</hi> beaſt
mention'd in the romance of MORTE ARTHUR. Yet, notwithſtanding, I am apt to
think, that Spenſer in repreſenting ſcandal under the ſhape of a
monſtrous and unnatural beaſt, imitated, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vyed with Arioſto,
who has repreſented avarice and jealouſy under the picture of two hideous
beaſts; the firſt of which, like the BLATANT BEAST attacks all eſtates
alike, enters the palace as well the cottage, but vents his rage in a more
particular manner againſt the clergy, ſparing not even the pope himſelf.
She is at laſt ſuppoſed to be bound by Leo the tenth, as Jealouſy is
ſuppoſed to be driven to her den by Renaldo. It is not improbable, that
Arioſto, in adumbrating theſe violent paſſions under the figure of
beaſts, form'd of many unnatural combinations, might have an eye to the
beaſt in the REVELA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIONS, which 
<q rend="inline">"roſe out of the ſea, having ſeven heads,
and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of
blaſphemy; and <pb n="156" facs="tcp:0143401900:159"/> the beaſt which I ſaw was like unto
a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth
of a lion."<note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>I had almoſt forget to take notice, that our author, in his
Radegunde with her city of females, probably had an eye upon Arioſto's land
of Amazons.</p>
            <p>But although Spenſer appears to have imitated, and
conſequently to have admir'd Arioſto, from a ſurvey of the preceding
inſtances; and to have been ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of rivalling the Orlando Furioſo, in
compoſing a poem upon a kindred and ſimilar plan; yet it may be affirmed,
that they were both of a genius entirely different. Spenſer, amidſt all his
abſurdities, abounds with beautiful and ſublime repreſentations; while
A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſto's ſtrokes of true poetry bear a very ſignal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion, in
their number, to his ſallies of roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic imagination: he gives us the
groteſque for the graceful, and extravagance for majeſty: he frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
moves our laughter and ſurpriſe by the whimſical figures of a Callot, but
ſeldom awakens our admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the juſt portraits of a Raphael. To
confeſs the truth, Arioſto's vein is ſo far different from Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer's,
that it is abſolutely comic, and infinitely better ſuited to ſcenes of
humour, than to ſerious and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn deſcription; he ſo greatly excels
in painting the familiar manners, that what are call'd his tales, are, by far,
the moſt ſhining paſſages in his poem. Many of <pb n="158" facs="tcp:0143401900:161"/>
his ſimiles are likewiſe the ſtrongeſt indications of his turn for
burleſque.<note n="*" place="bottom">Thus the magician diſcloſing his
enchanted ſhield, to dazzle the fight of Bradamante, is compar'd to a cat
wantonly playing with a mouſe, and at laſt killing it. C. 4. S. 22. Rogero
fighting with the orc, a ſea-monſter, is compar'd to a fly attacking a
maſtiff, and attempting to ſting him in various parts of his body. C. 10.
S. 105. Alzirdo being ſlain by Orlando, his ſoldiers are ſaid to make a
noiſe like that of a herd of ſwine, when a wolf has ſeiz'd one of their
little pigs, <hi>un tener porco.</hi> C. 12. S. 78. Zerbino hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt
inſulted Gabrina, and afterwards addreſſing her in a gentle manner, is
compar'd to a dog, who at firſt furiouſly aſſaults a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but
afterwards, a cruſt being thrown to him, fawns upon him. C. 20. S. 139.
Orlando and Mandricard fighting together, their weapons being broke to pieces,
are compar'd to two peaſants who are drubbing each other, having quarrell'd
about a water-courſe, or boundary of land. C. 23. S. 83. Other examples of
this ſort are obvious to a reader of Arioſto.</note>

            <p>But if there ſhould be any readers, who, from ſome of the
fictions in Orlando, would prove that its author was poſſeſs'd of an
extenſive and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent invention, let them remember, that theſe are
commonly borrow'd from romances, and adapted occaſionally by the poet to the
tenor of his allegory; and if it ſhould be granted, that ſome, or the
greateſt part of theſe were deriv'd from his own fancy, yet theſe, as
they ſo enormouſly tranſgreſs the bounds of nature and probability,
ought by no means to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted as genuine marks of the TRUE POET.</p>

            <head>SECT. VII. Of Spenſer's Inaccuracies.</head>
            <p>FEW poets will appear to have written with greater rapidity than
Spenſer. Hurried on by the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence of imagination he frequently cannot
find time to attend to the niceties of conſtruction, or to ſtand ſtill
and reviſe what he has before written, in order to prevent contradiction,
inconſiſtency, or repetition. Hence it is, that he not only fails in the
connection of ſingle words, but of circumſtances, and not only violates the
rules of grammar, but thoſe of truth, probability and propriety. He was more
ſollicitous about giving bold than exact touches to his figures, and was ſo
earneſtly intent of forming what was great, that he forgot to produce that
which was correct. So that if, with theſe inaccuracies, we conſider the
irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of Spenſer's plan in general, we may venture to conclude, that
no poet ever ſhewed more imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination with leſs judgement, than the
author of the FAERIE QUEENE. It may be looked upon as a very officious piece of
ill-nature to draw together theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior and ſubordinate faults, and 
<q> 
                  <l>—Seek ſlight faults to find,</l>

            <p>But a review of them will tend to explain many paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in

be impertinent to remark, that the Marchioneſs lamented in this Epitaph of
Milton, is probably the ſame with that celebrated by B. Johnſon, in an

It has been obſerv'd, that Milton copied the invention of fire-arms from
Arioſto; and it may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be obſerv'd, that Milton, in the ſpeech
which one of the evil angels makes upon them,

                  <p>There are other ſtrokes likewiſe in Milton's leſſer

                     </q> Among Milton's IMITATIONS OF
HIMSELF, I think the following have been unobſerved. In Il PENSEROSO, 
<q> 
                        <l>Sometimes let gorgeous TRAGEDY</l> 
                        <l>In ſcepter'd pall come ſweeping by,</l>

                        <l>Or the Tale of TROY divine.</l>
                     </q> It appears, that the
Greek Tragedies, founded upon theſe ſtories made an early, and
conſequently a laſting impreſſion upon Milton. In his firſt elegy to
Diodatus, written before he was arriv'd at his twentieth year, he
particulariſes them, where (as in the lines juſt cited) he is ſpeaking of
tragedy in general.

                     </q> But ſhall we ſuſpect Milton
of plagiariſm becauſe the Roman poet wrote FIRST? was it not NATURAL for
either poet in expreſſing the force of muſic in the ISLE OF SICILY, to
mention it's influence on two moſt implacable objects, which the SITUATION of
the Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, in both caſes, ſuggeſted?</p>

reſemblances for thefts; but this aſſertion by no means affects the
inſtances which I have given, in two former ſections, of Spenſer's
imitations from Chaucer and Arioſto. Spenſer is univerſally acknowledg'd
to have been an attentive reader, and profeſs'd admirer of both thoſe
poets; his imitations from the former are moſt commonly LITERAL; and what he
has copied from the latter, are ARTIFICIAL FICTIONS, which conſiſting of
UNNATURAL COMBINATIONS, could not, on account of their SINGULARITY, be fallen
upon by both poets <hi>accidentally</hi>; as NATURAL APPEARANCES might be,
which lie <hi>expos'd</hi> and <hi>obvious</hi> to all, at all times: ſo that

which proceeds upon an uncertain foundation, afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the amuſement of
conjecture rather than the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of truth; it may perhaps be a more
ſerviceable undertaking, to produce an author's IMITATIONS OF HIMSELF: and
this will be more particularly uſeful in the three following reſpects, viz.
It will diſcover the FAVORITE IMAGES of an author; it will teach us how
VARIOUSLY he expreſſes the ſame thought; and it will often EXPLAIN
DIFFICULT paſſages, and words.

of his imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and, what was its conſequence, his ſenſibility of

            <p>It is proper to remark, in this place, that Spenſer has given
three large deſcriptions, much of the ſame nature, viz. The Bower of
Bliſs, 2. 12. The Gardens of Adonis, 3. 5. And the Gardens of the Temple of
Venus, 4. 10. all which, though, in general, the ſame, his invention has
diverſified with many new circumſtances; as it has likewiſe his Mornings:
and perhaps we meet with no poet who has more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, or more minutely, at
the ſame time, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineated the Morning, than Spenſer. He has intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
two hiſtorical genealogies of future kings and princes of England, 3. 3. and,
2. 10. beſide two or three other ſhorter ſketches of Engliſh hiſtory.
He often repeatedly introduces his allegorical figures, which he ſometimes
deſcribes with very little variation from his firſt repreſentation;
particularly, DISDAIN, FEAR, ENVY, and DANGER. In this poem we like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe meet
with two hells, 1. 5. 31. and 2. 7. 21.</p>

before the reader ſome uncommon words and expreſſions, of which
Spenſer, by his frequent uſe, ſeems particularly fond.

predeceſſors, often occaſions the variation here inſiſted upon; and
ſometimes mere caprice and obſtinacy. Though in examining ſome of the
enſuing paſſages, I may be deceiv'd (as the reſt of my brethren have
been) by the appearance of truth, which I have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd above, as one of
the cauſes of difference of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion among the critics; I can promiſe the

the laſt-mention'd corrupt principles and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices; and, upon this

confeſs that <hi>alive</hi> is ſuperfluous, but Spenſer has run into many
other ſuperfluities on account of the frequency of his rhyme. Mr. Upton
propoſes likewiſe to write Earth [<hi>His Mother Earth</hi>] with an
initial capital, ſuppoſing it a PERSON; however, we had, perhaps, better
ſuppoſe it a THING: for if we underſtand it to be a Perſon, what an

Earth as a Perſon, but it may be to Earth as a Thing. However, it muſt be
confeſs'd, that this is ſuch an abſurd mixture as Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer was very
likely to have fallen into; and we have numberleſs inſtances of this fault,
in his account of the rivers which attended the marriage of Thames and Medway,

indiſcriminately put, the one for the other.

               </q> How

propoſes to remove this contradiction by reading <hi>dire</hi> Dropſy, the
<hi>dirus Hydrops</hi> of Horace. But it is plain, that <hi>dry Dropſie</hi>
is the ſpecies of the Dropſy ſo call'd, the <hi>dry Dropſy</hi> or
<hi>Tympanites</hi>; which Spenſer has inaccurately confounded with the other
ſpecies of the Dropſy, which may not improperly be <pb n="210" facs="tcp:0143401900:213"/>
ſaid to <hi>flow through the fleſh</hi>; not conſidering the
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency of making a <hi>dry</hi> thing <hi>flow.</hi> As to Mr.
Upton's correction <hi>dire,</hi> I cannot perceive how DIRE could ever be
miſtaken by the printers for DRY. Mr. Upton might, with equal propriety, have
objected to the following words, DRY <hi>Drops.</hi> 
               <q> 
                  <l>And with DRY DROPS congealed in her eye.</l>

               </q> By the way, it will be difficult
alſo to determine what Spenſer means by <hi>congealed,</hi> which occurs
again in the ſame ſenſe, and on the ſame occaſion, 
<q> 
                  <l>—In whoſe faire eye</l>

            <p>To return: By DRY <hi>Dropſie,</hi> may not the poet, alſo

                  <l>Him little anſwer'd th' angry Elfin knight.</l>

<q> 
                  <l>Him angry—</l>

                  <bibl>S. 41.</bibl>
               </q> But becauſe the Paynim is angry, doth
it neceſſarily follow, that the Elfin knight ſhould not be ſo too? He
certainly has reaſon to be enraged and angry after <pb n="211" facs="tcp:0143401900:214"/>
that bitter taunt, which provokes him to throw down his gauntlet, as a
challenge. It is ſurely wrong to alter the text, when there is neither
neceſſity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, nor authority to ſupport the correction.

                  <l>Both thoſe the lawrell garlands to the victor dew.</l>
               </q>
Mr. Upton thus reads the laſt line, 
<q> 
                  <l>Both thoſe AND TH' lawrel garlands to the victor
due.</l>
               </q> But ſurely Dueſſa, and Sans foy his ſhield, are the
lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel garlands, that is, the rewards to be given to the conqueror. Laurel
garlands are metaphorically uſed, and put in appoſition with Dueſſa,
and Sans foy his ſhield. It may be urg'd, as another objection to Mr. Upton's
alteration, that Spenſer never cuts off the vowel in THE before a
conſonant; upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count I would reject Hughes's reading of the

the lake of brimſtone burnt not <hi>bright,</hi> but only ſerv'd to make

            <p>IN reading the works of an author who lived in a remote age, it is
neceſſary, that we ſhould look back upon the cuſtoms and manners which
prevailed in his age; that we ſhould place ourſelves in his ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation,
and circumſtances; that ſo we may be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enabled to judge and
diſcern how his turn of thinking, and manner of compoſing were biaſs'd,
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenc'd, and, as it were, tinctur'd, by very familiar and reigning
appearances, which are utterly different from thoſe with which we are at
preſent ſurrounded. For want of this caution, too many readers view the
knights and damſels, the turnaments and enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Spenſer with
modern eyes, never conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the encounters of Chivalry
ſubſiſted in our author's age, as has been before hinted<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Sect. ii.</bibl>
               </note>; that ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances were
then moſt eagerly and univerſally read; and that thus, Spenſer from the
faſhion of his age, was naturally diſpos'd to undertake a recital of
chivalrous atchievements, and to become, in ſhort, a ROMANTIC POET.</p>
            <p>Nor is it ſufficiently conſider'd, that a prevalent practice
of Spenſer's age contributed in a very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable <pb n="218" facs="tcp:0143401900:221"/>
degree to make him an ALLEGORICAL POET. It ſhould be remember'd that, in the
age of which we are ſpeaking, allegory was the ſubject and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of
public ſhews and ſpectacles, which were then exhibited with a magnificence
ſuperior to that of former times; that the vices and virtues perſonify'd,
and repreſented by living actors, diſtinguiſh'd with their reſpective
emblematical types, were generally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd to conſtitute PAGEANTRIES,
which were then the principal entertainments, and ſhewn not only in private,
and upon the ſtage, but very frequently in the open ſtreets, for
ſolemniſing any public occaſion. As a proof of what is here advanc'd, I
would refer the reader to Hollinſhed's 
<note n="*" place="bottom"> 
                  <q rend="inline">"And to keep that ſhew companie, (but yet

                  <p>It is not improbable, that Milton, in IL PENSEROSO, took his
thought of hearing muſic from the earth, produc'd by ſome SPIRIT or GENIUS,

<q>

                     </q> From ſome
machinery of Inigo Jones, in his Maſques. Hollinſhed mentions ſomething
like this, in a very curious DEVISE preſented before Queen Elizabeth;
ſpeaking of the muſic of ſome fictitious nymphs; he adds, 
<q rend="inline">"which ſure had been a noble hearing, and
the more melodious for the variety thereof, becauſe it ſhould come
ſecretlie and ſtrangelie out of the earth."

                  </p> 
                  <p>It may perhaps be readily admitted, that Milton drew the
whole, from what had been repreſented in a maſque.</p>
               </note> TURNEY
performed by Fulke Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile, the lords Arundell, and Windſor, and ſir
Philip Sydney; who are feign'd to be the children of DESIRE attempting to win
the fortreſſe of BEAUTY; in which laſt ſpectacle much poetical
invention is diſcover'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:0143401900:222"/>In the mean time, I do not deny that our
author, was in great meaſure, induc'd, from the practice of Arioſto, to
write a poem partaking much of allegory: yet it muſt ſtill be granted, that
Spenſer's manner of allegorizing ſeems to have rather reſulted from
ſome of the ſpectacles juſt mention'd, than from what he had red in
Arioſto. In fact, Arioſto's allegory does not ſo much conſiſt in
perſonifying the virtues, vices, and affections of the mind, as it does in
adumbrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moral doctrine 
<note n="*" place="bottom">It is affirmed by Plutarch, that 
<q rend="inline">"Allegory is that, in which one thing is related
and another underſtood."</q> Thus Arioſto RELATES the adventures of
Orlando, Rogero, Bradamante, &amp;c. by which is UNDERSTOOD the conqueſt of
the paſſions, the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of virtue, and other moral doctrines; on
which account we may term the ORLANDO a MORAL poem; but can we term the FAERIE
QUEEN upon the whole, a MORAL POEM? is it not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually an HISTORICAL or
POLITICAL poem? for tho' it be (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its author's words) an ALLEGORY
or DARK CONCEIT, yet that which is couched or underſtood under this allegory
is the hiſtory, and intrigues of Queen Elizabeth's courtiers; which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
are introduc'd with a moral deſign.</note> under the actions of men and 
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0143401900:223"/> women. In ſuch an adumbration, Spenſer's allegory
ſometimes conſiſts; as in the firſt book, where The Red-croſſe
Knight, or a TRUE CHRISTIAN, attended by Una, or TRUTH, defeats the wiles of
Archimago, or the DEVIL, &amp;c. &amp;c. yet he has ſhewn himſelf a much
more ingenious allegoriſt, where his IMAGINA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION BODIES forth
unſubſtantial things, TURNS THEM TO SHAPE, and marks out the nature,
powers, and effects of that which is ideal and abſtracted, by viſible and
external ſymbols; as in his delineations of FEAR, ENVY, FANCY, DESPAIR, and
the like. Arioſto gives us but few of theſe ſymbolical beings, in
compariſon of Spenſer; and thoſe which he has given us, are by no means
drawn with that fullneſs and diſtinctneſs with which they are painted by
the latter. And that Spenſer painted theſe figures ſo fully and
diſtinctly, may we not reaſonably attribute it, to his being frequently
ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituated to the ſight of theſe ſymbolical beings, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd
with their proper emblems, and actually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with ſpeech, motion, and
life?</p>
            <p>As a more convincing argument in confirmation of what has been
aſſerted upon this head, it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark'd, that Spenſer denominates
his moſt exquiſite groupe of allegorical figures, the MASKE OF CUPID; thus,
without recurring to conjecture, his own words indubitably demonſtrate, that
he had ſometimes repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of this ſort in his eye: he tells us,
that theſe figures were 
<q> 
                  <l>—a jolly company</l> 
                  <l>In MANNER of a MASKE enranged orderly.</l>

               </q> 
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:0143401900:224"/> And in his
introduction to this groupe, it is manifeſt that he drew from another
allegoric ſpectacle of age, called the DUMB SHEW<note n="*" place="bottom">This
conſiſted of dumb actors, who by their dreſs and action prepar'd the

have intended to arraign the natural fertility of our author's invention; and
to prove, that he minutely copied after theſe repreſentations; all that I
have endeavoured to inculcate, is, that Spenſer was not only better qualified
to delineate fictions of this ſort, becauſe they were 
<q>

            <p>Inſtead of entering into an examination of Spenſer's manner of
allegoriſing, and of the conduct of his allegories in particular, which has
been done with an equally judicious and ingenious diſcernment by Mr.
Spenſe;<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <bibl>Polymet. B. 10. D. 4.</bibl> To
Mr. Spenſe's examination it may be added, that our author frequently
introduces an allegory, under which no meaning is couch'd; viz. 2. 9. 21. ALMA
is the mind, and her CASTLE the body. The tongue is the porter of this
caſtle, the noſe the Portcullis, and the mouth the porch, about the
inſide of which are placed twice ſixteen warders clad in white, which are
the teeth; theſe ALMA paſſes by, who riſe up, and do obeyſance to
her. St. 26. But how can the teeth be ſaid to riſe up and bow to the mind?
Spenſer here forgot that he was allegoriſing, and ſpeaks as if he was
deſcribing (without any latent meaning) a real queen, with twice ſixteen
real warders, who, as ſuch, might, with no improprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, be ſaid to riſe
and bow to their queen. Many inſtances of his confounding allegory with
reality, occur through this whole Canto, and the two next; particularly, where
he is deſcribing the kitchen of this caſtle, which is the belly, he gives
us a formal deſcription of ſuch a kitchen, as was to be ſeen in his time
in caſtles, and great houſes, by no means expreſſive of the thing
intended. Again, the occult meaning of his bringing Scudamore to the houſe of
CARE, 4. 5. 32. claſhes with what he had before told us. By this allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of
Scudamore coming to CARE's houſe, it ſhould be UNDER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STOOD, that 
<q rend="inline">"Scudamore, from a happy, paſs'd into a
miſerable ſtate."</q> For we may reaſonable ſuppoſe, that before he
came to CARE's houſe, he was unacquainted with CARE; whereas the poet had
before repreſented him as involv'd in extreme miſery. It would be tedious,
by an allegation of particular examples, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, how frequently his
allegories are mere deſcriptions; and that, taken in their literal ſenſe,
they have an improper, or no ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, veil'd under them. I ſhall,
however, mention one. The BLATANT BEAST is ſaid to break into the
monaſteries, to rob their chancels, caſt down the deſks of the monks,
deface the altars, and deſtroy the images found in their churches. By the
BLATANT BEAST is underſtood Scandal, and by the havock juſt mentioned as

popiſh ſuperſtition. But how can this be properly ſaid to have been
brought about by ſcandal? and how could Spenſer, in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, ſay this,
who was, as it appears by his paſtorals, a friend to the reformation, as was
his heroine Queen Elizabeth?</note> I ſhall mention one capital fault
committed by the poet in this point, which does not immediately fall under the

               <q rend="inline">"Painters, ſays a French writer, ought to employ
their allegories in religious pictures, with much greater reſerve than in
profane pieces. They may, indeed, in ſuch ſubjects as do not repreſent
the myſteries and miracles of our religion, make uſe of 
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0143401900:227"/> an allegorical compoſition, the action whereof ſhall
be expreſſive of ſome truth, that cannot be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented otherwiſe,
either in painting or ſculpture. I agree therefore to let them draw FAITH and
HOPE ſupporting a dying perſon, and RELIGION in deep affliction at the feet
of a deceaſed prelate. But I am of opinion, that artiſts who treat of the
mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and dogmas of our religion, are allowed no kind of allegorical
compoſition.—The facts whereon our religion is built, and the doctrine
it delivers us, are ſubjects in which the painter's imagination has no

which this author condemns, is practiſed by Spenſer, with this difference
only; that the painters here condemned are ſuppoſed to adapt human allegory
to divine myſtery, whereas Spenſer has adopted divine myſtery to human

profane matters, but to place the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious ſallies of imagination upon a

MACHABREE,<note n="*" place="bottom"> 
                  <p>One Machabree, a French poet, wrote a deſcription, in
verſe, of a proceſſion painted on the walls of St. Innocent's cloiſter
at Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, called the DANCE OF DEATH. This piece was tranſlated by Lydgate,
who tells us in the Prologue, St. 5. 
<q> 
                        <l>The which Daunce at St. Innocent's</l> 
                        <l>Portraied is.—</l>
                     </q> Stow mentions this DANCE OF
DEATH, in his Survey of London, ſpeaking of the cloiſters which antiently
belonged to St. Paul's church, 
<q rend="inline">"About this cloiſter was artificially and
richly painted the Dance of Machabray, or DANCE of DEATH, commonly called the
Dance of Paul's: the like whereof was painted about St. Innocent's cloyſter
at Paris; the metres or poeſie of this Daunce were tranſlated out of French
into Engliſh by John Lidgate, Monk of Bury, and with the picture of Death
leading all eſtates, painted round the cloyſter."</q> pag. 264. This
picture is a wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut, and prefixed to the poem we are ſpeaking of, in
Tottell's edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Lydgate, 1555; and is, I ſuppoſe, an exact
repreſentation of what was painted in St. Paul's cloiſters. It was
afterwards en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graved by Hollar, in Dugdale's Monaſt. vol, 3. p. 368. In all
probability, this painting at St. Paul's, or that (which was the ſame) at St.
Innocent's, gave Hans Holbein the hint for compoſing his famous piece, call'd
the DANCE OF DEATH, now to be ſeen in the town-houſe at Baſil.</p> 
                  <p>It is commonly ſuppoſed, that the wood-cuts, from whence
Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar engraved his exquiſite ſett of prints, entitled the DANCE OF DEATH,
were executed by Holbein: but I am apt to think this a miſtake, which aroſe
from confounding Holbein's picture, above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, with theſe wood-cuts.
For it will appear, that Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bein's manner of cutting in wood, is entirely
different from that in which theſe are finiſhed, by comparing them with
Holbein's ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural wood-cuts (in one of which his name is engraved at full
length) inſerted in archbiſhop Cranmer's catechiſm, an. 1548. In the cuts
of this catechiſm there is a delicacy of handling, by no means to be found in
thoſe of the DANCE OF DEATH; which, however, have an inimitable
expreſſion, and are moſt probably the work of Albert Durer. I am not
ignorant, that Rubens, who had copied this DANCE OF DEATH, recommended them to
Sandrart, as the performance of Holbein: of which Sandrart himſelf informs
us. 
<q rend="inline">"<hi>Sic memini,</hi> &amp;c.—I alſo
well remember, that, in the year 1627, when Paul Rubens came to Utrecht to
viſit Handorſt, being eſcorted, both coming from, and returning to
Amſterdam, by ſeveral artiſts, as we were in the boat, the converſation
fell upon Holbein's book of cuts, repreſenting the DANCE OF DEATH; that
Rubens gave them the higheſt encomiums, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing me, who was then a young
man, to ſet the higheſt value upon them, informing me, at the ſame time,
that he, in his youth, had copied them."

                     </q> But if Rubens
ſtiled theſe prints Holbein's, in familiar converſation, it was but
calling them by the name which the world had given them, and which they
generally went by. In another place Sandrart evidently confounds theſe
wood-cuts with Holbein's picture at Baſil. 
<q rend="inline">"<hi>Sed in foro, &amp;c.</hi> But in the
fiſh-mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket there [at Baſil] may be ſeen his [Holbein's] admirable DANCE
OF PEASANTS; where alſo, in the ſame public manner, is ſhewn his DANCE OF

ſpares neither popes, emperors, princes, &amp;c. as may be ſeen in his

which, at preſent, I am treating, are fifty-three in number, every one of
which has an unity, and is entirely detach'd from the reſt; ſo that, how
could they be repreſentations of one picture? But if it be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that
they were engrav'd from this picture, (which, moreover, from their
diſſimilitude, they could not be) how does it follow they were done by
Holbein?</p>

tranſlated. Spurious edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of theſe cuts ſoon afterwards appear'd,
particularly one at Cologn, dated 1566, in which the forgery is pretty
diſcernible. It may not be improper to take leave of this ſubject, by

written in the ſpecies of which I am at <pb n="231" facs="tcp:0143401900:234"/> preſent
ſpeaking. Lidgate has received numberleſs encomiums from our old Engliſh
poets, to which <pb n="232" facs="tcp:0143401900:235"/> his language entitled him, rather than
his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination; for though he is a very unaminated writer, yet he made very
conſiderable improvements in the original ſtate of our Engliſh
verſification, by writing in ſo polite a ſtyle; and it ought not to be
denied, that Lydgate is the firſt Engliſh poet, who can be red without
heſitation and difficulty. To Lydgate ſucceeded John Harding, who wrote a
Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle, in verſe, of all our Engliſh kings, from Brutus to the reign of
king Edward IV. in which he liv'd. This piece is often commended, and quoted by
ſome of our beſt antiquaries. But his merit, as an hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, naturally
excludes him from that which he ſhould arrogate as a poet: accuracy in
collecting, and fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in relating events, may be, perhaps, juſtly allow'd
him, but not the leaſt effort of invention. So that, from the ſpecimen
produced by Harding at this time, there was ſome reaſon to preſage, that
poeſy was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſing into its primaeval barbariſm; and that the
rudeneſs of Robert of Glouceſter, would be reinſtated 
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0143401900:236"/> in the place of Chaucer's taſte, judgement, and
imagination.</p>
            <p>However in the reign of Henry VII. ample amends were made for this
interval of darkneſs by Stephen Hawes, a name generally unknown, and not
menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by any Engliſh compiler of the lives of Engliſh poets, but by

This author I look upon to be the reſtorer of invention in our poetry,
whoſe ſtreams had flow'd in a current ſtill more polluted and
ſluggiſh, ever ſince the time of Chaucer. He not only reviv'd, but highly
improved the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient allegoric vein, which the rhyming chronicle of the laſt
mentioned poet had (as I before hinted) now totally expelled. Inſtead of that
dryneſs and harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of deſcription which are ſo remarkably
diſguſting in his predeceſſors, we are by this author often
enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with the fullneſs and luxuriancy of Spenſer-Hawes refin'd
Lydgate's verſification, and gave it, what it wanted, ſentiment and
invention; added new graces to the ſeven-lined ſtanza, which Gower and
Chaucer firſt introduced into our tongue from the Italian; and, to ſum up
all, was the firſt of our poets, who taught fertile fancy, and high-wrought
fiction to wear the garb of perſpicuous and harmonious numbers. The title of
his poem is almoſt as univerſally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known as his name, and is as follows. 
<q rend="inline">"The hiſtory of GRAUNDE AMOURE and LA BEL PUCEL,

language, in which are repoſited the treaſures of true learning now began
to be taught and admir'd. In this age flouriſh'd John Skelton, who
notwithſtanding the great and new lights with which he was ſurrounded,
contributed not the leaſt ſhare of improvement to what his anceſtors had
left him; nor do I perceive that his verſification is in any degree more
poliſh'd than that of his immediate predeceſſor, Hawes. His beſt pieces
are written in the allegorical manner, and are, his CROWNE of LAU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RELL, and
BOWGE OF COURT. But the genius of this author ſeems little better qualify'd
for pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tureſque, than for ſatyrical poetry; in the former, he wants
invention, grace, and dignity; in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, wit, and good manners.</p>

flouriſh'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this time, Sir David Lyndeſay, and William Dunbar; the
former of which, in his DREAM, and other pieces, and the latter in his GOLDEN
TERCE, or SHIELD, and in THE THISTLE AND ROSE, has diſcover'd a genuine
ſpirit of allegoriſing. Soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, appear'd a ſeries of poems,

                  <p>Lydgates's FALL of PRINCES gave riſe to the MIRROUR OF

ſeries of the great Unfortunate; but he choſe rather to confine himſelf
entirely to our Engliſh ſtory, and began with Robert Treſilian, 1388. and
ended with Lord Haſtings, 1483. In this work he was aſſiſted by others;
and particularly by John Sackville, who wrote the life of the Duke of
Buckingham, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with this INDUCTION; intending at the ſame time to
write all thoſe remarkable lives which occurr'd from the Conqueſt to
Treſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, with whom Baldwin originally began, and to have printed his
additional part, together with all that Baldwine, and his friends, had already
done, in one volume, and to have prefix'd this INDUC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION as a general preface
to the whole. But this was never exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted. Afterwards another collection was

ſtrokes; but theſe, however honour'd with the commendation of Sir Philip
Syd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, are little better than a biographical detail. There is one piece
indeed among the reſt, which exhibits a train of imaginary perſonages ſo
beautifully drawn, <pb n="236" facs="tcp:0143401900:239"/> that in all probability they
contributed to ſtimulate and awaken the imagination of Spenſer, in forming
the like deſcriptions. This however may be affirm'd from demonſtration,
that SACKVILLE'S INDUCTION ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches nearer to the FAERIE QUEENE in allegoric

Milton's imitations; by which it will farther appear, how well he knew to make
a bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd thought or deſcription his own, by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of the

attempted to give, or who, at the ſame time, gave with becoming majeſty,
the idea of an ARMED ANGEL. He, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, receiv'd ſome hints, in this

where Gryllus, one of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of Ulyſſes, transform'd into a hog by
Circe, holds a diſcourſe with Ulyſſes, and refuſes to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd
to his human ſhape.</p>
            <p>Not many years before the FAERIE QUEENE was written, viz. 1548,
Gelli publiſhed his Circe, which is declar'd in the Preface to be founded
upon the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of Plutarch, mention'd by Mr. Jortin. Circe ſoon became a
very popular book, and was tranſlated into Engliſh (as likewiſe into
other languages) in the Year 1557, by one Henry Iden; ſo that, probably,
Spenſer had red it; and might be induc'd to conſult that Dialogue, from its
mention in the preface.

<q>

               </q> As would the

<q> 
                  <l>Yet was admired much of fooles, <hi>women,</hi> and boyes.</l>

                  <bibl>5. 2. 30.</bibl>
               </q> If we were to read, 
<q> 
                  <l>Yet was admired much of <hi>women,</hi> fooles, and
boyes.</l>
               </q> But theſe corrections are made by the critic, upon a
ſuppoſition that his author muſt infallibly have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten what was
beſt. It may be laid down as a general rule, that an Alexandrine cannot be
harmonious with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a full pauſe after the third foot. Thus, 
<q> 
                  <l>That ſpear enchanted <hi>was</hi>—which laid thee on
the green.</l>
               </q> Conſequently the ſixth ſyllable muſt neceſſarily
be a monoſyllable, or the laſt ſyllable of a word; for we cannot make a
full pauſe in the middle of a word, upon which account ſuch Alexandrines as
theſe are neceſſarily inharmonious. 
<q> 
                  <l>So in his angry <hi>cour—age</hi> fairly pacify'd.</l> 
                  <l>That bore a Lyon <hi>paſſ—ant</hi> in a golden
field.</l> 
                  <l>But that he muſt do <hi>batt—el</hi> with the
ſea-nymph's ſon.</l> 
                  <l>And to her watry <hi>cham—ber</hi> ſwiftly carry
him.</l>
               </q> 
               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:0143401900:263"/> And becauſe a full pauſe muſt be made
on the laſt ſyllable of the third foot, the third foot ſhould never
conſiſt of a Trochee, for then we ſhould be oblig'd to lay the greater
ſtreſs upon the ſhort ſyllable; as if the third foot was to be
Beāuty̆, Coūrăge, grēedy̆,
flōwry̆, or the like.</p>
            <p>And it may be further remark'd, that an Iambus, for the third
foot, will make the verſe more muſical, as the pauſe will be more
ſtrong after a ſhort ſyllable. Thus, 
<q> 
                  <l>Fit to adorn <hi>thĕ dēad,</hi>—and deck
the dreary tomb.</l> 
                  <l>That art thus <hi>foully̆ flēd</hi>—from
famous enemy.</l>
               </q> For the ſame reaſon an Iambic foot at the end of any
Engliſh verſe has a good effect.</p>
            <p>An Alexandrine entirely conſiſting of Iambic feet, anſwers
preciſely to a pure Iambic verſe of the antients. Thus, 
<q> 
                  <l>Thĕ gēntlĕ Evē ăwākes
rĕfrēſhfŭll āirs ăroūnd.</l>

            </p>
            <p>In reading this kind of meaſure, the antients did not, probably,
huddle the ſyllables together, as we do: but it would be difficult to point

            </p>
            <p>It may be obſerv'd, that a Latin Hexameter is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
diſtinguiſh'd from a proſe ſentence, only by being ended with a Dactyle
preceding a Spondee; upon which account our manner of reading the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of
ſuch Hexameters as theſe, <hi>procumbit Humi Bos, Oceano Nox, amica Luto
Sus, &amp;c.</hi> is probably wrong. According to our preſent manner of
reading them, the whole verſe doth not differ in ſound from an <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio
proſaica</hi>; contrary therefore to our preſent prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, we ſhould
take care to expreſs the Dactyle and Spondee thus—<hi>Ocean—o
Nox</hi>; and ſo of the reſt. And that this was the practice of the
antients, may be farther infer'd from theſe words of Quintilian, on reading
verſes,

in the courſe of this work, it may not be, perhaps, improper to give the
reader ſome further knowledge of him. His works were print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed An. 1576, with
this title, 
<q rend="inline">"A hundreth ſundrie flowres, bounde up
in one ſmall poeſie; gather'd, partly by tranſlation, in the fyne and
outlandiſh gardens of Euripides, Ovid, Petrarke, Arioſto, and others; and
partely by invention, out of our own fruitefull orchardes in Englande; yielding
ſundrie ſweet ſavours of tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, comicall, and morall diſcourſes,
both pleaſaunt and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the well-ſmellyng noſes of learned
readers."</q> This was follow'd by another edition, An. 1587. This author was
well eſteem'd by his cotemporary writers, as appears by their teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of him; and it muſt be confeſs'd, that he has much exceeded all the poets
of his age, in ſmoothneſs and harmony of verſification. Would it not
extend this note too far, as a ſpecimen of his talent for love-verſes, I
would produce his Ode, 
<q rend="inline">"In praiſe of Lady Bridges, now Ladie
Sandes, on a ſcar on her forehead,"</q> in which the reader would be
ſurpriz'd to diſcover a delicacy, rarely, if ever, to be found in that
early ſtate of our poetry.</p> 
                        <p>But the reader will, probably, be ſtill more entertain'd
with ſome paſſages in JOCASTA, a Tragedie, (before mention'd) written ten
years before the Poem juſt quoted, and acted at Gray's Inn, 1566, in which he
will not only perceive the ſtrength and harmony, but likewiſe the poetical
ſpirit of Spenſer, who did not publiſh any one of his pieces till
fourteen years afterwards. The ſtory is taken, and in ſome meaſure
tranſlated, from the PHOENISSAE of Euripides; it is written in blank verſe,
with choruſſes (none of which are copied from thoſe in the PHOENISSAE);
and before each Act, according to the practice of that age, the Dumb Shew is
introduc'd. In Act 2. 2. combat is likely to enſue, between Eteocles and
Polynices; on which occaſion the Chorus, conſiſting of four Theban dames,
ſing an Ode, which thus begins.

            <p>When the falſe Florimel is plac'd by the ſide of the true
Florimel, the former vaniſhes into nothing; and as ſuddenly, ſays the
poet, as all the glorious colours of the rain-bow fade and periſh. With
regard to the circumſtance of the ſudden evaneſcence in each, the
compariſon is juſt and elegant: but if we conſider, that a rainbow
exiſts by the preſence of the ſun, the ſimilitude by no means is made
out: however, it is the former of theſe circumſtances only which the poet
inſiſts upon, ſo that a partial correſpondence only is expected.

            <p>In the age of the poet, tapeſtry was the moſt faſhionable
furniture of halls and ſtate-rooms; as it was when Milton wrote his Comus,
who mentions tapeſtry as a circumſtance of grandeur. 
<q>

                  <l>Which oft is ſooner found in lowly ſheds,</l>

            <p>As the general faſhion of furniſhing halls, &amp;c. is at

and propriety both expreſſions and deſcriptions muſt neceſſarily
loſe, when the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, or cuſtoms, or manners, to which they allude, are
out of uſe, and forgotten. There is another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to tapeſtry in

            <p>He ſeems here to have intended a ſatirical ſtroke againſt
the Puritans, who were a prevailing party in the age of Queen Elizabeth; and,
indeed, our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, from his profeſſion, had ſome reaſon to declare
himſelf their enemy, as poetry was what they parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly ſtigmatiz'd, and
bitterly inveigh'd againſt. In the year 1579, one Stephen Goſſon wrote a
pamphlet, with this title, 
<q rend="inline">"The Schoole of Abuſe, containing a pleaſaunt
invective againſt poets, pipers, plaiers, jeſters, and ſuch-like
caterpillers of a common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth."</q> This was ſoon follow'd by many others
of the ſame kind.</p>
            <p>But the moſt ridiculous treatiſe of this ſort was that
written many years afterwards by W. Prynne; as a ſpecimen of which, I ſhall
beg leave to entertain the reader with its title-page.

arguments, by the concurring authorities, and reſolutions of ſundry texts

of fifty-five Synods and Councils, of ſeventy-one Fathers, and Chriſtian

which we renounce in baptiſme, if we believe the Fathers) are ſinfull,
heatheniſh, lewd, ungodly ſpectacles, and moſt pernicious corruptions;
condemned in all ages as intolerable miſchiefes, to churches, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicks,

fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting of ſtage-playes, are unlawfull, infamous, and miſbeſeeming

            </p>
            <p>This extravagant and abſurd ſpirit of puritanical
enthuſiaſm, proved at laſt, in its effects, as perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to polite
learning, and the fine arts, as to the liberties and conſtitution of our
country: while every ſpecies of elegance was repreſented, by theſe
auſtere and melancholy zealots, as damnable luxury, and every degree of
decent adoration, as popiſh idolatry. In ſhort, it is not ſufficiently
conſider'd, what a rapid and national progreſs we were, at that time,
making in knowledge, and how ſudden a ſtop was put to it, by the inundation
of preſbyterianiſm and ignorance; which circumſtance alone, excluſive
of its other at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant <pb n="293" facs="tcp:0143401900:296"/> evils, gives us ample cauſe to

            <p>It may not, perhaps, be impertinent to remark here, that Milton,
who was inclin'd to puritaniſm, had good reaſon to think, that the
publication of his Samſon Agoniſtes, would be very offenſive to his
brethren, who held poetry, and particularly that of the dramatic kind, in
ſuch abhorrence. And, upon this account, it is probable, that, in order to
excuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for having engag'd in this proſcrib'd and forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

concerning the ſeverity of manners among the antient Viſigoths. This author
informs us, that on the top of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Kindaberg, near the caſtle of
the ſame name, there was a beautiful garden, the moſt delicious ſpot of
ground in all the Northern climate. Into this gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den none but old men were
permitted to enter. The admiſſion of young men to a ſurvey of ſo
delightfull a ſcene, it was fear'd, might prove too great a relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from
their unintermitted daily diſcipline, and make ſuch impreſſions on
their ſuſceptible diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as might be the beginnings of an
effeminate and luxurious life.

they may be ſuppoſed to ſleep with their eyes open. Neither dares he
ſay that the porter and traveller are yet taking a nap, but only that they
have a good mind to't. And after all, we find none but the good woman who had
loſt her child (and ſhe indeed is faſt) aſleep, unleſs the dogs may
likewiſe be ſuppoſed ſo, becauſe they had left off barking. And
theſe methinks were ſcarce worthy to be taken notice of in an heroic poem,

heroically."</q> Our critic here unfortunately ſets on upon a
ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition abſolutely falſe, viz. that 
<q rend="inline">"the poet is repreſenting all the world as
faſt aſleep,"</q> ſo that every argument which he draws from this
ſuppoſition muſt neceſſarily fall to the ground. Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius uſhers
in his night-piece by telling us, 
<q rend="inline">"night cover'd the earth with her
ſhade,"</q> and afterwards ſelects ſuch objects and circumſtances the
repoſe and tranquillity of which produce the moſt ſtriking contraſt to,
and conſequently moſt ſtrongly exaggerate the diſtraction and
inquietude of Medea. Hence he tells us that the mariner was contemplating with
calm attention the conſtellations of Helice and Orion; or, that now it was
the time, according to Virgil's tranſlation, 
<q rend="inline">
                        <hi>cum medio volvuntur ſydera
lapſu:</hi>
                     </q> or that it was a ſtill, and conſequently a ſilent
night, that even the traveller and door-keeper (whom he ſingles out, as their
employment implies watching and wakefullneſs) were now about to fall
aſleep; that even the mother (whom we might expect to find awake) had now
forgot her dead babes in ſlumber; that the dogs had ceaſed barking thro'
the city, a circumſtance highly natural and pictureſque of a ſtill night;
that every ſound, &amp;c. but, that amidſt this ſituation of things Medea
could not ſleep. But what can we expect from a critic who confeſſes
himſelf to be ſtruck with this choice repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the night in

dreams. Somewhat like to the fourth we have in Marino.</p>

                     </q> 
                     <p>Which is a pretty image, but has not ſo near a reſemblance
with truth, nor can ſo generally be apply'd to all flowers. Our author here
dares not ſay directly that the flowers ſleep, which might ſound a little
harſh, but ſlurs it over in the <hi>participle,</hi> as taken for granted,
and affirms only that they ſweat, which the night-dew makes very eaſie.</p>

                     <p>In the laſt half-verſe, we may ſee how far our author
has out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done Apollonius. 'Twas no ſuch ſtrange thing in the ſorrowful
woman when ſhe had ſpent her tears, for ſleep to cloſe her eyes: but
here we have the moſt raging and watchful paſſions luſt and envy. And
theſe too inſtead of the luſtful and the envious, for the greater force
and emphaſis, in the abſtract.</p> 
                     <p>Some may object, That the third verſe does contradict the
firſt. How can all things be huſh'd, if birds in dreams repeat their
ſongs? Is not this like the indiſcretion of Marino? who ſays, That the
winds and all things are huſht, and the ſeas ſo faſt aſleep, that
they ſnore. Cant. 20.</p> 
                     <p>It may be anſwer'd, That in this place 'tis not the poet
that ſpeaks, but another perſon; and that the poet here truly repreſents
the nature of man, whoſe firſt thoughts break out in bold and more general
terms, which by the ſecond thoughts are more correct and limited. As if one
ſhould ſay, all things are ſilent, or aſleep how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; if there is any
noiſe, 'tis ſtill but the effect of ſleep, as the dreams of birds,
&amp;c. This compariſon might be much further im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd to our advantage, and
more obſervations made, which are left to the readers ingenuity.

<q> 
                  <l>Throw hither all your QUEINT enamel'd eyes.</l>
               </q> And in

            </p>
            <p>The ſame poet has likewiſe drawn one or two more ſtrokes in
the ARCADES, from a maſk of Johnſon. In ſong 1. he thus breaks forth, 
<q>

                  <l>To whom our vows, and wiſhes, &amp;c.</l>
               </q> So Johnſon
in an Entertainment at Althrope, 1603. 
<q> 
                  <l>This is ſhee,</l> 
                  <l>This is ſhee.</l>
               </q> Milton in Song 3. pays this compliment
to the counteſs of Derby, 
<q> 
                  <l>Tho' Syrinx your Pan's miſtreſs were,</l> 
                  <l>Yet Syrinx well might wait on her.</l>

                  <l>And the dame has Syrinx' grace.</l>
               </q> 
            </p>
            <p>Theſe little traits of likeneſs juſt lead us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that Milton before he ſate down to write his ARCADES, had recourſe to
Johnſon (who was the moſt eminent maſque-writer then extant) for the form
and manner proper to this ſpecies of compoſition, and that in the courſe
of writing it, he naturally fell upon ſome of Johnſon's expreſſions.

            <p>IN the cloſe of this work, it may not be perhaps im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to
ſubjoin an apology for the manner in which I have conducted it.</p>
            <p>And firſt it may be objected in general, that theſe
obſervations would have been rendered more uſeful and <pb n="310" facs="tcp:0143401900:313"/> convenient had they been printed together with Spenſer's text,
arrang'd in their reſpective places; at leaſt it may be urged that ſuch a
plan would have prevented much unneceſſary tranſcription. But I was
diſſuaded from ſuch a procedure by two reaſons; the firſt is, The
obſervations, (the laſt ſection excepted) as they now ſtand, reduced to
general heads, appear to be ſo many diſtinct eſſays on Spenſer; and
thus methodized, are intended to form a kind of ſyſtematical critciſm on
the FAERIE QUEENE. The ſecond is, that a formal edition of this poem with
notes, would have been impertinent, as ſuch a work is at preſent expected
from the hands of two learned and ingenious critics.</p>
            <p>As to particular ejections, too many, I am ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, muſt
occur; one of which will probably be, that I have been more diligent in
pointing out the faults than the beauties of this author. That I have been
deficient in encomiums on particular paſſages, did not proceed from a want
of perceiving or acknowledging beauties, but from a perſuaſion, that
nothing is more abſurd or uſeleſs than the panegyrical comments of
thoſe, who criticiſe from the imagination, rather than from the judgement,
who exert their admiration inſtead of their reaſon, and diſcover more of
enthuſiaſm than diſcernment. And this muſt neceſſarily, (it will
however moſt commonly) be the caſe of thoſe, who undertake to point out
beauties; which, as they will naturally approve themſelves to the reader by
their own force, ſo no reaſon can often be given why they pleaſe. The
ſame cannot always be ſaid of faults, which I have <pb n="311" facs="tcp:0143401900:314"/>
frequently diſplayed without palliation;<note n="*" place="bottom">See more
particularly Sect. 1.</note> it being my chief aim, together with that of
particular illuſtration, to give an impartial eſtimate of the merit of this
origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal genius.</p>
            <p>I cannot take my final leave of the reader without acknowledging
that this taſk has been peculiarly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful to me; tho' the buſineſs
of criticiſm is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally laborious and dry, yet it has here more frequently
amuſed than fatigu'd my attention, in it's exerciſes upon an author who
makes ſuch perpetual and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful appeals to the fancy. The pleaſure which
Spenſer received in compoſing the FAERIE QUEENE muſt neceſſarily be
ſhared by it's commentator; and the critic, on this occaſion, may venture
to exclaim with the poet,
