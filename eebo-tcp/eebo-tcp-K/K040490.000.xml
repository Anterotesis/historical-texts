            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AS I conſider myſelf (in the Meaning of my Motto) <hi>an humane Man, and that no Act of Humanity is a Stranger to my Heart;</hi> I could not reſiſt a natural Impulſe to publiſh the following Sheets; inaſmuch as they will tend, I hope, wiſh, and believe, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the unjuſt Prejudices, that have been moſt wantonly and cruelly taken againſt a Man; and that too with an avowed Purpoſe, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent him, as an <hi>"ancient outlawed Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, who was ſaid to have</hi> Caput lupinum, <hi>and might be knocked on the Head, like a Wolf, by any one who ſhould meet him;</hi> becauſe, <hi>having renounced all Law, he was to be dealt with, as in a State of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, when any one, who ſhould find him, might ſlay him."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as Mr. <hi>Macklin hath not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced all Law,</hi> and as <hi>"now (to avoid the Imputation of the Inhumanity above complained of) it is holden, that no Man can kill ſuch Outlaw wantonly or wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,"</hi> he ſeems as well intitled to the Protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law of <hi>England,</hi> as any other liege Subject.</p>

If it was high Treaſon againſt the Majeſty of the <hi>PUBLIC,</hi> for a poor, ignorant, inſulted Player, deluded, by miſtaking a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, (from their Treatment of him) for Barbarians, hunting down a Beaſt of Prey, to become indignant, ſo indignant at ſuch Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and at not being heard in his own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; and to happen to be ſo far loſt, in an unguarded Moment, in ſuch a Scene; as to expreſs an improper and imprudent Agitation of Mind, by Looks or Geſture; if ſuch De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment, in ſuch a Situation, could, I ſay, be conſidered as high Treaſon; what muſt one think of Gentlemen, who, though liberally edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, and converſant in the Laws of their Country; yet, with theſe Advantages, and cool and diſpaſſionate; after ſerious Reflection, and mature Conſideration, ſhould aſſert in the public Papers, that they had been <hi>"ill uſed, and robbed by Ruſſians, Mr. Macklin's Friends, that they ſcarcely ſuffered them to eſcape with their Lives, and that Mr. Macklin was privy to the Cauſe of their Complaints;"</hi> and ſuch malevolent Aſſertion be beſides, unſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either by Proof or Reaſon; but, on the contrary, alledged merely on <hi>own</hi> ſelf-created

            <p>
               <hi>Macklin</hi> was moſt groſly and inhumanly abuſed, inſulted, and proſcribed; and had it not been for the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> would have been totally ruined. To them he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed;

            <p>The <hi>Town</hi> give out, that a Player hath dared to diſpute the undoubted Right of a Britiſh Audience, founded on immemorial Cuſtom, to approve or diſapprove any Actor or theatrical Exhibition, by the uſual Mode of Clapping or Hiſſing. The Charge is denied; and it is <hi>only</hi> humbly contended, that the meaneſt Subject, even a Player, a Servant of the Public, or a Vagabond (who being liable to Puniſhment, is alſo intitled to Protection) hath a legal Right to be heard againſt being for ever deprived of his Livelihood; though ſuch At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt were made by the firſt Perſonages in the Kingdom, or by Majeſty itſelf (if that were poſſible) and that Riots, Conſpiracies, and Malice, are all odious to, and puniſhable by the Spirit, as well as the Letter, of the Laws of <hi>England.</hi>

Mr. <hi>Macklin,</hi> and his Friend Mr. <hi>Kavenhuller Skinner</hi> ſay, that upon the 13th of <hi>November</hi> laſt, Mr. <hi>James,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Mr. <hi>Aldus</hi> an Attorney at Law, was very violent, at the Head of a Party,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0187601100:16"/>
in the two Shilling Gallery of <hi>Covent Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> Theatre; that they and their Party were the chief Perſons who made the Diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and there is this particular Charge againſt <hi>James,</hi> that he inſiſted a Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> one of the Actors of the ſaid Theatre, ſhould perform the Part of <hi>Macbeth,</hi> which was to have been exhibited that Evening. Then Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi> and Mr. <hi>Skinner</hi> ſay likewiſe, that upon the 18th of ſaid <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> Mr. <hi>James</hi> appeared again at the ſaid Theatre, in Concert with Mr. <hi>Aldus</hi> and Mr. <hi>Miles,</hi> in Conſequence of a Conſpiracy together, and that they made a violent Riot; and it is expreſsly charged that <hi>James,</hi> among others, called upon Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi> to kneel down upon the Stage, and aſk Pardon,—Theſe are the Charges againſt Mr. <hi>James,</hi> for whom I am concerned, with ſome general Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to inflame; and Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi> aſſerts in his Affidavit, that he, believes the ſole Cauſe of his Diſcharge from the Theatre, was occaſioned by, and owing to theſe riotous Proceedings. I have an Affidavit of Mr. <hi>James,</hi> which, if I am not very much miſtaken, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0187601100:17"/>
exculpates him from any Thing of the Sort, charged By the Information in this Cauſe—though perhaps Mr. <hi>James</hi> was not ſo perfectly quiet, as he could now wiſh he had been, yet your Lordſhips will find, upon his Affidavit, that he did nothing more than is done every Day, when an Auditor does not like an Actor—he tells, you he was there, when Mr. <hi>Mack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> himſelf does not introduce him—he has no Reluctance in telling how often he attended the Exhibition of <hi>Macbeth,</hi> and the whole of his Conduct while there—he tells your Lordſhip, that he went there upon the 6th of ſaid <hi>November,</hi> when he is not charged with being there—he ſays he went in Company with his Wife, that may ſatisfy your Lordſhip, he meant to be quiet, for to procure Quiet at Home, he took his Wife with him, and went into the two Shilling Gallery; he did not mean to make a Riot, having his Wife with him; and it might be well if every Perſon's Wife was as quiet as Mr. <hi>James</hi>'s. But your Lordſhip will find there was another lady, a Lady <hi>Macbeth,</hi> who was not ſo quiet in this Buſineſs, for ſhe thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0187601100:18"/>
to act in the Character, her Huſband was that Night to perform, therefore ſhe was not quite ſo quiet—and her Huſband, inſtead of performing the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of <hi>Macbeth,</hi> choſe to exhibit a great Part of his own Character.—Inſtead of going on with the Play, he produced a vaſt Number of News Papers, with which he was diſpoſed to act his Part in the Cauſe, and appealing to them was his Method of acting, till Mr. <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> took the Character from him, who will act much better for him, if he will let him alone; thus the Cauſe was taken from the Audience, which ſeemed to be an Accuſation thrown out againſt <hi>Macklin</hi> of ſaying, that a Mr. <hi>Reddiſh</hi> had hiſſed him; it ſeems Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi> appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the News Papers, and charged Mr. <hi>Reddiſh</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sparks</hi> with having hiſſed him. This Charge Mr. <hi>Reddiſh</hi> and the other denied in the public Papers, by Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidavits ſworn before my Lord Mayor, or ſome Juſtice of the Peace. Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi> was angry, that he had thrown out a falſe Charge, and in order to exculpate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was prepared with Papers, when he
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0187601100:19"/>
came upon the Stage, and was going to enter upon his Exculpation, and that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the firſt Riot.—Moſt of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience diſapproved of Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi>'s Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in this Buſineſs, and tho' it was his own Appeal to the Public, yet he did not chuſe to have Mr. <hi>James</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhew their Diſapprobation by Hiſſing, which is the uſual manner upon ſuch Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, either Hiſſing or Clapping; that was all that paſſed upon the 6th of <hi>November;</hi> then upon the 13th, the Time when it is charged, that Mr. <hi>James</hi> was at the Theatre, the Queſtion then aroſe, whether Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi> had not been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely wrong in this falſe Charge upon Mr. <hi>Reddiſh</hi> and others, and it was the Judgment of the Houſe that he had, and Mr. <hi>James</hi> was in Truth one of thoſe judges who was of Opinion it was impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Behaviour, and Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi> was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon for ſome Conceſſions, for that he had been in the wrong.—Mr. <hi>James</hi> ſays he ſat in the two Shilling Gallery, and that he, with the reſt, called out for a Conceſſion, for this bad Behaviour of <hi>Macklin</hi>'s, which he had no ſooner done, than a Lady, who ſat ſome little Diſtance
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0187601100:20"/>
from him, ſtarted up and immediately ſtruck Mr. <hi>James</hi>—This Signal it ſeems was to be given, together with the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion the Lady made uſe of, <hi>"this is one of the Scoundrels who hiſſed,"</hi> or to that Effect, upon which a Man ſtarted up and ſeconded the Lady, being cloſe by her, and immediately ſtruck Mr. <hi>James;</hi> upon this a Scuffle and a third Perſon aroſe, and ſtruck Mr. <hi>James;</hi> this ſeems to be rather unfortunate for Mr. <hi>James,</hi> for if he did wrong, he was very well puniſhed upon the Spot, without having the Puniſhment of this Court—they tumbled him between two Benches, and one or two got upon him, and beat him: Your Lordſhip may conceive the Conſequences might have been very ſerious to him—He ſays, he had a Suſpicion who this Virago Lady, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun the Buſineſs, was, he ſuppoſed her to be a Relation of Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi>'s, and he defined a Friend of his, who appeared in the Gallery, to follow this Lady Home, to ſee who ſhe was; he found out the Houſe ſhe went to, which had the Name <hi>Macklin</hi> upon the Door. Every one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves the Lady, who begun this Aſſault
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0187601100:21"/>
upon Mr. <hi>James,</hi> was Mrs. <hi>Macklin,</hi> Wife of Mr. <hi>Macklin,</hi> who makes this Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The preſent Queſtion is, whether or no there was a concerted Deſign and Conſpiracy between theſe Parties to hurt Mr. <hi>Macklin.</hi> This would be a bad Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs indeed, and every Perſon muſt feel it ſo.—But Mr. <hi>James</hi> denies the Charge in theſe Terms, <hi>viz.</hi> that he had not the leaſt Knowledge before of Mr. <hi>Aldus,</hi> or any of the reſt, and abſolutely denies, that he called upon Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> to perform in the Character of <hi>Macbeth,</hi> inſtead of Mr. <hi>Macklin,</hi> or for any Purpoſe whatſoever—and though Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi> has been too hot and haſty in charging Mr. <hi>James</hi> with making uſe of thoſe Expreſſions, they are material Expreſſions perhaps, and mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial to be denied, for they enter into the very Purpoſe, ſuppoſed to be a Preface to the Proceedings of the reſt of theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, by calling upon Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Part of <hi>Macbeth;</hi> this he fully denies.—He is charged with hiſſing, hooting, and abuſing every Perſon near him; but he puts a Negative upon this by his Affidavit, wherein he ſhews the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0187601100:22"/>
Uſage he received from the Hands of Mrs. <hi>Macklin</hi> and her Friends.—He ſays, the next Morning he waited upon Mr. <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> the acting Manager of the Playhouſe, to procure an Interview with Mr. <hi>Mack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> in order to find out from whom he received thoſe Blows; that he did not mean to proſecute, with reſpect to her, but would put up with the Blows he received from her. Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> took a great deal of Pains to procure a Meeting between <hi>Macklin</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> to have the Matter explained. But your Lordſhip will find that was diligently avoided by Mr. <hi>Mack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> tho' he had full Notice.—Now ſuppoſing for a Moment, that Mr. <hi>James</hi> himſelf was at all to blame, will your Lordſhip grant an Information upon the Application of this Mr. <hi>Macklin,</hi> from whoſe Wife and two of his Friends (for thoſe Men muſt be taken for his Friends) if Mr. <hi>James</hi> had behaved at all ill, he receiv'd ample Puniſhment from their Hands, ſuch as I have before repreſented; and when Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi> refuſed to meet him or to aſſiſt him in his Enquiry after theſe Perſons. I ſhould ſubmit, that would be
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0187601100:23"/>
a Ground for refuſing this Information to Mr. <hi>Macklin.</hi> The Court requires, when an Application is made to them for an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, for a Riot or a Breach of the Peace, or other bad Behaviour, that there ſhould be nothing of the Sort on the Part of the Perſon who makes the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Another Charge againſt Mr. <hi>James</hi> is, that he roared out for Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi> to kneel down upon his Knees, and that he menaced Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi> with his Stick or Cane; that is a material Charge, and material to be denied, that is denied in the fulleſt Manner in the World. He abſolutely denies in Words, that he roared out to Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi> to down upon his Knees, or menaced Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi> with his Stick, as charged in the Affidavit—for Deponent poſitively ſwears he had no Stick or Cane whatever with him that Evening; that is material, the Truth is no more than this; they muſt have taken ſome other Perſon to be him—Now with reſpect to the Conſpiracy between theſe Parties, to do the Miſchief, which is the material Part, there is the moſt abſolute and poſitive Denial that can be in any

Form of Words—Mr. <hi>James</hi> ſays, he was there upon the 18th of <hi>November,</hi> that he was a perfect Stranger to <hi>William Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus Miles, James Sparks, Joſeph Clarke, Ralph Aldus,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Leigh,</hi> or any or either of them, to drive the ſaid Mr. <hi>Mack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> from the Stage, nor had any Meeting with any Perſon or Perſons whatever for that Purpoſe, nor deſired any Perſon to expell the ſaid <hi>Macklin</hi> from the Stage—All this Deponent wanted was for him to anſwer for his Conduct relating to thoſe Charges againſt Mr. <hi>Reddiſh</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sparks,</hi> and that was the whole of the Buſineſs, and denies that he was in any Conſpiracy, or knew of any Conſpiracy againſt Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi>—That with reſpect to himſelf, he has been ſufficiently ill uſed, and more than ſufficiently puniſhed at the Time, through the Behaviour of the Wife of Mr. <hi>Macklin,</hi> for if there was any Cauſe of Revenge, ſhe and her two Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtants fully revenged the Cauſe, while my Client was down between the two Benches; therefore, my Lord, I conceive this is a full Anſwer to the Charge, and that your Lordſhip will not make the Rule abſolute againſt Mr. <hi>James.</hi>

                        <p>SAITH, That on the 6th of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> laſt, to the beſt of Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent's Knowledge and Belief, as to the Time, Deponent went in Company with his Wife to Covent Garden The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre, to ſee the Tragedy of <hi>Macbeth,</hi> wherein Mr. <hi>Charles Macklin</hi> was to perform the Part of <hi>Macbeth,</hi> being the third Time of his appearing in that Character; ſaith, They were in the two Shilling Gallery, and that before the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Play Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi> came on the Stage, with a large Parcel of Papers in his Hands, which he began to read, the Purport of which was to prove, that Mr. <hi>Reddiſh</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sparks</hi> had hiſſed him the firſt Night of his performing ſaid Part of <hi>Macbeth;</hi> ſaith, That on hearing ſame read, it appeared to Deponent, that there was no ſufficient Proof of either ſaid <hi>Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh</hi> or <hi>Sparks</hi> hiſſing, neither did De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0187601100:26"/>
think a mere Relation ſufficient to contradict the Oaths of ſaid <hi>Reddiſh</hi> and <hi>Sparks,</hi> which they had reſpectively made, denying that ſaid <hi>Reddiſh</hi> had hiſſed on the 23d of <hi>October;</hi> Copies whereof were inſerted in the News Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and Deponent did therefore diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approve of ſaid <hi>Macklin</hi>'s Behaviour, by the common Mode of Hiſſing, and faith nothing more particular paſſed that Evening, and the Play was heard through, during the Performance of which Deponent applauded or hiſſed, as he approved or diſapproved.</p>
                        <p>Saith, That on 13th of ſame <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> Deponent went to ſaid Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, to ſee the Tragedy of <hi>Macbeth,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fourth Time of Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi>'s performing ſaid Character, and ſat in the two Shilling Gallery; ſaith, that as ſaid <hi>Macklin</hi> had not produced the poſitive Proof of <hi>Reddiſh</hi> and <hi>Spark</hi>'s hiſſing, as he pledged himſelf to the Public to do Deponent, as well as many others, call'd out for ſuch Proof or a Conceſſion. And ſaith, that on his calling out for ſuch Proof or Conceſſion, a Woman
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0187601100:27"/>
ſome little Diſtance from Deponent, ſtarted up and ſtruck Deponent, and ſaid, <hi>"This is one of the Scoundrels who hiſſed,"</hi> or uſed Words to that Effect; on which a Man, who appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be ſitting next her, immediately ſtarted up, and alſo ſtruck Deponent, who returned his Blows, and continued ſo to do, till his Companions took him away.</p>
                        <p>Saith, That ſome little Time after ſaid Fray happened, but during the Performance of ſaid Play, as Deponent was endeavouring to find out ſaid Man who had ſtruck him, a Gentleman, whom Deponent has not the leaſt Knowledge of, pointed out the Man, who had ſtruck him, and told Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, if he was looking for the Man who had ſtruck him, that was him, or Words to that Effect; ſaith, upon his going up to the ſaid Perſon who had ſo ſtruck him, another Man immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly roſe up and ſtruck Deponent, which Blow was followed by ſeveral others, from ſeveral perſons who were ſitting near ſaid Man, who had firſt ſtruck
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0187601100:28"/>
Deponent, and Deponent was knocked down between the two Benches, and ſome Perſon or Perſons ſtamped on De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent's Breaſt, and other Parts of his Body; and ſaith, if his Friends who went with him, and ſome other Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, had not interpoſed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented ſaid Perſons from continuing their ill Uſage to him, the Conſequence would have proved very dangerous to Deponent.</p>
                        <p>Saith, that immediately after he had been ſo releaſed from the diſagreeable Situation he was in between the two Benches, he went into the Paſſage of the ſaid Gallery, where he was addreſſed by a Gentleman, who informed him he was a Patentee of ſaid Theatre (and whom Deponent believes, and has been ſince informed, was Mr. <hi>Dagge</hi>) and deſired Deponent to give him his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, which Deponent did, and then ſaid he had heard Deponent had been uſed very ill, and pointed to a Perſon, who he ſaid was the Conſtable of the Theatre, and had Orders from him to take out any Perſon or Perſons, whom
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0187601100:29"/>
Deponent ſhould fix on, who had uſed him ill.</p>
                        <p>Saith, he then went into the Gallery, with the Conſtable, to ſearch for the firſt Man who had ſtruck Deponent, but could not find him; and on his coming into the Gallery, with the Conſtable, he obſerved the Woman who had ſtruck him riſing from her Seat to go out, and as Deponent was following her, with a View of finding out who ſhe was, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent met Mr. <hi>Lucas</hi> of <hi>Charing Croſs,</hi> who was then coming into the Gallery, on which Deponent deſired Mr. <hi>Lucas</hi> to watch ſaid Woman Home, which he accordingly did, and ſaid <hi>Lucas</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to ſaid Theatre in about twenty Minutes, and informed Deponent, that he had followed her into a Houſe in <hi>James Street, Covent Garden,</hi> with the Name of <hi>Macklin</hi> on the Door, and therefore Deponent at that Time verily believed, and doth now believe, that ſaid Woman who ſtruck Deponent firſt, and whom ſaid <hi>Lucas</hi> followed to ſaid Houſe, on the Door of which Houſe was wrote <hi>Macklin,</hi> to be Mrs. <hi>Macklin,</hi> Wife of ſaid <hi>Charles Macklin;</hi>

                           <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0187601100:30"/>
Saith, that being ſo ill uſed in the Theatre, he was obliged to quit ſame during the Time the fifth Act was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming.</p>
                        <p>Denies being at the Head of, or form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Party or Parties againſt Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi>'s performing ſaid Character of <hi>Macbeth,</hi> on ſaid 13th <hi>November,</hi> and abſolutely denies having at that Time the leaſt Knowledge of Mr. <hi>Ralph Aldus;</hi> and alſo denies, that he called on Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> to play ſaid Character of <hi>Macbeth,</hi> inſtead of ſaid <hi>Macklin,</hi> or for any other Purpoſe whatſoever; and alſo denies, that he hiſſed, hooted, or abuſed thoſe, who deſired him to be quiet.</p>
                        <p>Saith, that on the <hi>Monday</hi> Morning following, he waited on Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> the acting Manager of the ſaid Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, to requeſt of him to uſe his Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to obtain an Interview with Mr. <hi>Macklin,</hi> in order to prevail on Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi> to uſe his utmoſt Endeavours to find out the ſeveral Perſons, who uſed Deponent ill the preceding Night; that Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> ſent his Servant to ſaid <hi>Macklin,</hi> to obtain ſuch Interview,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0187601100:31"/>
which Servant brought back for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that ſaid <hi>Macklin</hi> was not at Home; that ſaid <hi>Coleman</hi> promiſed Deponent to ſpeak to <hi>Macklin,</hi> and to procure a Meeting with him, and that he would give Deponent Notice of ſuch Meeting; that in the Evening of ſame Day, he received a Note from Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming him, that ſoon after Deponent left ſaid <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Houſe ſaid <hi>Macklin</hi> came, and refuſed to have any Meeting or Converſation with Deponent on the Subject; in which ſaid Note from <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> to Deponent, was incloſed one from <hi>Macklin</hi> to <hi>Coleman,</hi> informing ſaid <hi>Coleman,</hi> that ſaid <hi>Macklin</hi> refuſed to meet Deponent.</p>
                        <p>Saith, that on or about 17th of ſaid <hi>November,</hi> Deponent did cauſe to be inſerted in the Morning Chronicle, a Letter addreſſed to ſaid <hi>Macklin,</hi> in the Words following (that is to ſay)</p>

                        <p>Poſitively denies, that he roared out to <hi>Macklin,</hi> to down on his Knees, or that he menaced ſaid <hi>Macklin</hi> with his Stick, for he had no Stick or Cane of any kind whatſoever with him, during that Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and ſaith, that on 18th <hi>November</hi> laſt, he was a perfect Stranger to <hi>Miles, Sparks, Leigh,</hi> any or either of them, and never had any Converſation with all or any of them, or with <hi>Clarke</hi> or <hi>Aldus,</hi> or either of them, to drive ſaid <hi>Macklin</hi> off the Stage, nor did Deponent enter into any Combination, Conſpiracy, or Agreement with any Perſons whomſoever, for that Purpoſe; nor did Deponent ſay or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs any Deſire t expel ſaid <hi>Macklin</hi> from the Stage, for all that Deponent wanted was an Anſwer to his Queſtion, and an Apology for ſaid <hi>Macklin</hi>'s Conduct towards the ſaid <hi>Reddiſh</hi> and <hi>Sparks.</hi>

Mr. <hi>James</hi> appears from the firſt Time to be inſulted by People who came there, and the Woman who firſt began the Diſturbance, was traced to Mr. <hi>Mack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>'s Houſe; he had Notice, and was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon to give an Account, if he knew who the Perſons were who had uſed <hi>James</hi> ſo ill—But what was Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct: he refuſes to meet him, and gives no Anwer whatſoever, which was not an implicit reaſon, that he did not know who they were; if he did not know who they were, as I think he muſt know, he might have ſo informed Mr. <hi>James,</hi> but he had reaſon to ſuſpect who they were. Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi> is ſaid to have firſt appealed to the Public; I ſhould have thought his Diſcretion would have dictated to him to abide by their Opinion, let it be what it would; but with reſpect to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Application to a Court of Juſtice, he is not intitled to the leaſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour or Countenance whatſoever; for he
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0187601100:36"/>
brought his Complaint in the moſt public and ſolemn Manner he could, againſt two People in the ſame Profeſſion with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and which Complaint, if proved muſt have been attended with all the fatal Conſequences to thoſe two Gentlemen that <hi>Macklin</hi> ſeems to apprehend now the Complaint was made by him to the Audience, they heard it with Patience the Complaint they found was not true but appeared to be falſe; I don't know any more generous Conduct for any Man to have adopted upon this Occaſion, where there was a falſe Charge brought againſt two Men, which, as public Men, muſt have been attended with very injurious Conſequences to thoſe Gentlemen, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

which has been ſince added, at that Time the Court ſaid there was no Ground for an Information. Now they have foiſted in the Ground of Conſpiracy, which they have not made out. It is denied, in the moſt poſitive Terms, reſpecting the Stick being held up in the Pit; it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, in the moſt poſitive Terms, that <hi>James</hi> knew any thing of the other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants; upon the contrary he went as a ſingle Man, neither has he entered into any Conſpiracy or Combination whatever. Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi> might have put an end to it, if he pleaſed, even after his having made his Appeal to the Public, in the Manner he did; when he was called upon by Mr. <hi>James,</hi> he might have anſwered him, by giving him an Account of thoſe Perſons from whom he had ſuffered ſo much, when he was knocked down between the Benches, where he was kicked and ſtamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, which might have been attended with fatal Conſequences to his Perſon; but when called upon, Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes to give him any Anſwer, or meet him.</p>

Of the Facts ſworn to upon the 13th of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember laſt, <hi>Macdonnel</hi> and his Wife give this Account; that one of <hi>"the Perſons who ſeemed to be at the Head of thoſe who oppoſed</hi> Macklin's <hi>performing the Character of</hi> Macbeth, <hi>and ſpoke moſt particularly, was one</hi> James—<hi>as he called himſelf, whom they believed to be</hi> John Stephen James, <hi>of</hi> Bridge Street, Weſtminſter, <hi>ſaid</hi> James <hi>ſo publicly declaring;"</hi> theſe Mr. <hi>Buller</hi> thought good to repreſent to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as Perſons ſpeaking from Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Belief, and to ſuppoſe Mr. <hi>Mack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> ſpoke from Information and Belief reſpecting the Perſon; it is charged to be <hi>James</hi> by <hi>Macdonnel</hi> and his Wife, but their Affidavit hardly wants Poſitiveneſs, in the manner of making it, three People ſwear poſitively, Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi> making the fourth—Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi> believes <hi>James</hi> to be the Perſon from whom he received that Treatment, and the Reaſon for his believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is, he has been fo informed by thoſe, who now prove it, concurring with his own Apprehenſions.</p>

The Court will now ſay what is fit to be done upon the Truth of the Caſe, when the Truth is underſtood; Mr. <hi>Buller</hi> thought good, as did Mr. <hi>Bearcroft,</hi> who went before him, to ſay Mr. <hi>Macklin,</hi> who gave certain Provocations, which, by their Argument, they would refer to him, in Conſequence of which Mr. <hi>James,</hi> was intitled to act in the manner he did, and was not ſo culpable as the reſt, he having received very ill Treatment from the Hands of a Woman, and ſome Friends of Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi>'s. If your Lordſhip looks at the Affidavit of the Gentleman, in his own Exculpation, and of Mr. <hi>Lucas,</hi> your Lordſhip will ſee upon what Ground theſe People were warranted, in preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this Woman was Mrs. <hi>Macklin.</hi> The Ground is this; by the Directions of <hi>James, Lucas</hi> followed this Woman to the Houſe, upon the Door of which, was the Name of <hi>Macklin;</hi> Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi> lives in that Houſe, Part of which belongs to him, upon the Door of which, leading to his Apartments, is his Name, the other Part of it is a Shop; in the Houſe there are various Lodgers, and to what Part of the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0187601100:41"/>
Hoauſe ſhe went, they have hot thought proper to tell; ſhe might go to a Lodger there, or might be a Lodger herſelf; or poſſibly never heard or knew any thing at all of Mr. <hi>Macklin,</hi> otherwiſe than as being a Lodger in the Houſe; and diſpoſed to think Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi> was ill treated. But of this Woman being Mrs. <hi>Macklin,</hi> there is no Evidence, nor do they affect to ſay ſhe is in any Way ſo, as to induce your Lordſhip to credit, that ſuch is their Belief. Your Lordſhip will give me Leave to ſay, that this Woman, ſo ſaid to be Mrs. <hi>Macklin</hi> by Mr. <hi>James,</hi> was not Mrs. <hi>Macklin,</hi> and it was ſo far from being poſſible for <hi>James</hi> ſo to believe her, that he charged a Woman of the Name of <hi>Macdonnel</hi> with being the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who had ſo treated him; he Mr. <hi>James</hi> therefore, ſo far from being of that Belief, ſtands under the Predicament of having found out his Miſtake, if ever there was a Time, that he really thought ſo, for this ſame Mrs. <hi>Macdonnel</hi> is the ſame Perſon he fixed upon, as having given him that Uſage, and is not Mrs. <hi>Macklin,</hi> out Mrs. <hi>Macdonnel,</hi> a Perſon who has
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0187601100:42"/>
nothing to do with it, but the Fact of being a Witneſs in this Caſe; all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument founded upon it will be removed, by ſhewing there is ſuch a Miſrepreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Then my Lord it remains to ſhew, that the Charge is neither diſputed or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied; I take Leave to ſay ſo, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Gentlemen have ſaid it is both diſputed and denied; theſe Facts, ſuppoſing them to be true, conſtitute the Ground of the Charge againſt this Perſon.</p>
               <p>Your Lordſhip will give me Leave to preſume that, of which theſe is undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Evidence, and which no Perſon is prepared to controvert, <hi>viz.</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the enlarging of the Rule for Mr. <hi>Leigh,</hi> Mr. <hi>Buller</hi> was not ill ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed, it was not a Slip upon the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, though the Gentleman ſays ſo, but he has it from the Attorney, giving him Inſtructions to enlarge it, without which he would not have enlarged it, therefore it was no Miſtake of Inſtructions, but the Gentleman acted agreeable to the Point of his Inſtructions; the Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, in my Apprehenſion, perfectly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0187601100:43"/>
what he was about, when he gave thoſe Inſtructions; I now, underſtand it, and if the Gentleman had not adviſed he ſhould be defended, they would have given him better Inſtructions. Nobody will doubt the Charge, when there is a Proof of a great Number of People, ſpeaking at a great Number of Times and Places, about it; and Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> has been ſeen to give Orders, and to apply that Force, and collect it, which will clearly be found to be the Truth; and when not denied, it muſt be taken for granted; and if that Time never comes of its being denied, it appears in Proof beyond a Doubt, there exiſted in Somebody a determined Purpoſe to drive this Man from the Stage; and though the Gentleman choſe to ſpeak of Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi>'s Apprehenſions being groundleſs, Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi> at that Time, as well as the Time I am now preſſing his Intereſt for the Conſideration of the Court, if he was in a Situation to apprehend any thing, muſt apprehend he would be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged; and now that he has been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, if he is not apprehenſive of being diſcharged, it is certain he is not
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0187601100:44"/>
yet reſtored, and not under the Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion he ſhall be reſtored. With reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to their own Safety, for which no Imputation falls upon them, if the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagers of the Theatre attend to ſuch Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour as this, it will for ever prevent the Reſtitution and Reſtoration of this Man, to what the People have driven him from. That ſome People are anſwerable for that, I beg Leave to preſume, in this Buſineſs; how far thoſe People are acceſſary to that Deſign, and inſtrumental in carrying it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Execution, and for the Purpoſe of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viating the Suſpicion of Colluſion and Conſpiracy, the Circumſtances are ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar enough. When I ſtate Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi> to be an Iriſhman, he will not be affronted with me, what thoſe others are I cannot learn; I have not made any Inquiry about it; but I find a little <hi>Iriſh</hi> Blood has found its Way into their Veins, or thoſe that adviſe or appear for them to Day; when the Rule was enlarged, they appeared by two diſtinct Claſſes of Council, each re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting Three, and to Day the Partie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Then I beg Leave to ſtand again to rectify my Miſtake; we ſhall grow accurate, by Degrees, no doubt; then there is one Attorney for three Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, repreſented by three Council; and three Attorneys inſtructing another Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, to be for the three other Parties. The corrected Caſe then is this; three Attorneys employ one Council, upon the Behalf of three Parties, who chooſe to be underſtood, as Parties entirely unconnect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with each other; another Attorney em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys three diſtinct Council, repreſenting three Parties, becauſe they chuſe to ſhew
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0187601100:46"/>
thoſe three Parties totally unconnected with each other; therefore, as far as reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects the Point of Connection, is to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by the <hi>Evidentia rei</hi> of the Caſe, which your Lordſhip ſees, with reſpect to Mr. <hi>James,</hi> the preſent Subject in Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, is, that he is underſtood by his Council, to have acquitted himſelf alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and they have gone particularly through the Charge, in Point of Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, in order to contradict it.—Give me Leave to go through the Parts of the Anſwer; in the firſt Place, your Lordſhips are told, that this Gentleman went to the Theatre, for the peaceable Purpoſe of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Play; perhaps if he had been ſo very peaceable as my learned Friend, he would have had no Occaſion to have taken his Wife with him, to keep him in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; I wiſh with all my Heart his Wife could have done ſo the next Time of his going there; but I cannot tell whether it was, that this Gentleman grew ſo unruly, that his Wife choſe to keep out of his Way (it would have been well for the reſt of theſe Defendants, if they had done ſo too) or whether it was for other Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes:
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0187601100:47"/>
It ſeems he returned to the Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe; but with what View? Not out of Curioſity, that being fully ſatisfied the firſt Night; for then Mr. <hi>James</hi> was clearly of Opinion, that <hi>Macklin</hi> was incompetent for performing the Character of <hi>Macbeth;</hi> the Gentleman might have ſuppoſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf inveſted with Authority, to form a Judgment upon the Merits of Mr. <hi>Mack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> as a Performer, and, in Company with his Wife, whoſe Criticiſms concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with his, <hi>Macklin</hi>'s Performance of the Character was conſidered, by them, as worth Nobody's while to go and ſee, It was odd, after he had paſſed this Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he ſhould chuſe, whenever Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi> came on again, in that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, to go and ſee him. This Caſe is too ſtrong, and no Perſon can give this Gentleman Credit for ſaying, he came on Purpoſe afterwards to ſee the Play; and when Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi> came upon the Stage, in different Characters, in the Play in <hi>Shylock,</hi> and in the Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in Sir <hi>Archy Macſarcaſm;</hi> I take Leave to ſuppoſe the Town agreed, that in theſe Characters Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi> always
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0187601100:48"/>
had capital Merit; if there is any Merit in thoſe Characters themſelves, they are underſtood, by all the World, to have been exhibited with all their Advantages by Mr. <hi>Macklin;</hi> however, if it was Mr. <hi>James</hi>'s Purpoſe to ſhare in the Pleaſures, what drew him to ſee <hi>Macklin</hi> in the Characters of <hi>Shylock</hi> and Sir <hi>Archy Macſarcaſm?</hi>—He was in fear, as he thinks fit to tell us, before Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi> began the Character, that they would not let him go on, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they wanted Something elſe; they wanted an Apology, and ſome Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and God knows what; and that which I ſhall preſently go more minutely into the Enquiry of—that Something—therefore it was, and not ſeeing him in Sir <hi>Archy</hi> and <hi>Shylock,</hi> clearly which drew Mr. <hi>James</hi> to ſee him, in thoſe Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, any more than when he went to ſee him in <hi>Macbeth.</hi> Nobody can ſuppoſe nor will Mr. <hi>James</hi> wiſh to be underſtood that ſeeing, applauding, or condemning the Character, were among the Object that drew Mr. <hi>James</hi>'s Attention to the Play-houſe. It ſeems, however, Mr. <hi>Jame</hi> having ſatisfied your Lordſhips theſe were
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0187601100:49"/>
not his Purpoſes, has left us no Doubt what they were; for he has had the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to explain them. He ſays, the firſt Time, viz. the Sixth of <hi>November,</hi> there was a Talk about <hi>Reddiſh.</hi> His Affidavit ſtates, that, <hi>"it appeared to this Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that there was no ſufficient Proof, of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſaid</hi> Samuel Reddiſh <hi>or</hi> James Sparks <hi>hiſſing; neither did this Deponent think a mere Relation ſufficient to contradict the Oaths of them, the ſaid</hi> Samuel Reddiſh <hi>and</hi> James Sparks; <hi>and this Deponent did therefore diſapprove of</hi> Macklin's <hi>Behaviour, by the common Mode of Hiſſing."</hi>—What other Purpoſe, if any, brought him there that Night? Your Lordſhip ſees how ſoon he forgot—for it ſeems he hiſſes the Actor to prevent his going on; and why? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was not ſufficient Proof to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy this ſelf-created, ſelf-erected Judge. He takes upon himſelf to act upon a Charge he had nothing to do with; he had no Connection with either of the Parties; but he, in pure Generoſity, as Mr. <hi>Buller</hi> tells us, was inclined to take upon him to judge of thoſe Merits, he ſuppoſed himſelf called upon to try, though his Proceedings,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0187601100:50"/>
in Fact, had no Relation at all to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the Performance—But Mr. <hi>James</hi> was ſo inattentive to the Pleaſure of the Company there, as to think himſelf au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized to diſturb what they might like.</p>

               <p>I am very well ſatisfied, as to Mr. <hi>James</hi>—You need not go any further—I think what Mr. <hi>Buller</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded to, was right; if the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion went therefore in the Way he meant it, to be ſure, this Court would not encourage Complaints of the Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation or Approbation of acting upon a public Theatre; being ſhewn in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which every Part of the Auditory has a Right to ſhew it—But if from Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, Ill-will, or Reſentment, a Number of People are ungenerous enough to take Advantage of the Situation a poor Actor is in, being at their Mercy upon the Stage, to deprive him of his Bread, and inſult him, not upon any Offence ariſing out of the Play, but from Malice and Conſpiracy againſt the Perſon who is the Actor, to ſtrip him of the Means of Living, that is a ſtrong Ground of Action, which may be brought by him—I rather wiſhed he had—
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0187601100:51"/>
I hinted and recommended to him to have brought an Action—Beſides the Injury done to him, it is moſt indecent to the Public, and a Shame to the Police of the Kingdom—With Regard to Mr. <hi>James,</hi> he don't deny ſome of the principal Parts of the Charge, and upon his own Affida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit, he gives ſufficient Ground to ſhew with what View, after the Sixth of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi> he went there, and with what Principle, and for what Purpoſes—As to the Affidavit of <hi>Macdonnel</hi> and his Wife, he hardly gives an Anſwer to any Part of it—It is the cleareſt, fulleſt, and moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Charge, and he hardly gives an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to any Part of that Affidavit—It is very remarkable in that Affidavit, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But taking it upon his own Affidavit, which is the faireſt Way—He goes there upon the Sixth of <hi>November;</hi> whether he went for Amuſement, or other Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, he don't ſay; but he goes on the Sixth of <hi>November;</hi> he ſays, before the Beginning of the Play, Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi> came upon the Stage, with a Parcel of Papers in his Hands, which he began to read, the Purport of which was, to prove Mr. <hi>Reddiſh,</hi> a Performer of <hi>Drury Lane,</hi> the firſt Night of his performing the Part of <hi>Macbeth,</hi> had hiſſed; and upon hearing the ſame read, it appeared to him, there was no ſufficient Proof of either ſaid <hi>Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh</hi> or <hi>Sparks</hi> hiſſing; neither did he this Deponent think a mere Relation ſufficient to contradict the Oaths of them, the ſaid <hi>Reddiſh</hi> and <hi>Sparks,</hi> which they had reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectively made, whereby they denied it and he ſays, he therefore ſhewed his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approbation of <hi>Macklin</hi>'s Behaviour, by the common Method of Hiſſing, and he ſays he hiſſed that Evening—There it reſts for that Night—But how comes it upon the Thirteenth of <hi>November,</hi> that he came there? With what View, and in what
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0187601100:53"/>
Company does he come there? Manifeſtly for Vengeance, not to ſee the Play—He ſays he went, it being the fourth Time of Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi>'s performing the Character—He ſays, that as <hi>Macklin</hi> had not produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced any poſitive Proof of <hi>Reddiſh</hi> and <hi>Sparks</hi> Hiſſing, as he had pledged himſelf to the Public to do, he this Deponent, as well as others, called for ſuch Proof or Conceſſon; and upon that, a Squabble happened with a Woman (<hi>Macdonnel</hi>'s Wife) whom he ſwore to be moſt out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous—As to Proofs and Conceſſions, <hi>Macklin</hi> had nothing to do with it, <hi>Macklin</hi> was wrong in ſaying any Thing about it; and much more ſo, after they had made their Affidavits, to take Notice of it.</p>
               <p>But he goes on Purpoſe, not to ſee the Play, but to call for Proofs and Conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions—Who was to take them? Was the Court? Or the Pit? Or the Upper Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery? They had not defined what the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions were to be, or to whom to be made—Then <hi>James</hi> is outrageous, and makes all this Work for want of Proofs end Conceſſions, that he had no Buſineſs to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0187601100:54"/>
go to the Play-houſe to aſk for—Then he has made a Slip in one Thing, which I am ſure he was not aware of—It is inſiſted, there was no Conſpiracy—To be ſure no Conſpiracy—The other Perſons joined in the Rule, have no Acquaintance with him—But when he comes to give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, he ſays, if his <hi>Friends</hi> that went with him had not done ſo and ſo, they ſhould not have been able to have got the better; therefore it appears he went with a Body of his Friends, to demand Proofs and Conceſſions, by Vociferations and Noiſe in the Houſe—After this he wants to ſpeak with <hi>Macklin</hi>—I ſuppoſe <hi>Macklin</hi> took Care not to meet him—He was afraid to ſpeak to him, as he was ſo boiſterous, but to Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> he deſires to be excuſed giving him any Satisfaction about this Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man at all—In Conſequence of this Mr. <hi>James</hi> ſends a Challenge, and publiſhes it in the News-papers—He writes to him in this Manner.</p>
               <q>Sir, I call upon you thus publicly, to declare your Reaſons for refuſing to meet me at Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi>'s, or elſewhere, as likewiſe who the Gentlewoman is,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0187601100:55"/>
who firſt ſtruck, and <hi>then</hi> ſet a Ruſſian to aſſault me, on <hi>Saturday</hi> Evening laſt, in the Gallery of <hi>Covent Garden</hi> The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre, ſhe being afterwards watched in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your Houſe, in <hi>James Street, Covent Garden.</hi> This I muſt inſiſt upon, as I intend then to leave you to the Stings of your own malevolent Heart, and the Reſentment of the much injured Public.</q>
               <p>Then for fear the Court ſhould not be able to perceive it was a Challenge, <hi>James</hi> takes Care of this, for he declares in his Affidavit, that Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi> did not dare to anſwer him, <hi>either in a public or private Manner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However, this is not a Conſpiracy. He ſays he is not acquainted with the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons that might be there—There might be Scores or Hundreds concerned in it—Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi> ſingled out, as well as he could, thoſe he was able to give Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of—<hi>James</hi> ſays he did not enter into a Conſpiracy to drive <hi>Macklin</hi> for ever from the Stage—But ſtill he ſhould give Proofs or Conceſſions before he acted again.</p>
               <p>Now as to a Conſpiracy, it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to prove a parole or written Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

               <p>I am for Mr. <hi>Miles,</hi> and ſhall trouble your Lordſhip with ſuch An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to the Charge againſt him, as occur to me.</p>
               <p>I apprehend there is very little Proof againſt Mr. <hi>Miles</hi>—He is charged with being preſent in <hi>Covent Garden</hi> Houſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Eighteenth of <hi>November;</hi> that he hiſſed, was noiſy, and outrageous, with a great Number of other Perſons in the Pit—He is likewiſe charged with having wrote ſomething upon Paper, and throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it out of the Pit upon the Stage—What the Contents of the Paper were, is not ſtated; ſo I preſume your Lordſhips will not conſider it to be ſo ſtated—Then
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0187601100:58"/>
that he had a Conference with Mr. <hi>Woodward,</hi> and after that <hi>Woodward</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired. I think that is the whole of the Charge made upon Mr. <hi>Miles.</hi> He is not charged with being preſent in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi> acted <hi>Macbeth</hi>—I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand there was a ſtrange Diſturbance upon the Eighteenth of <hi>November;</hi> but he is not charged with any Conſpiracy, except what could be inferred from expreſſing his Diſapprobation at the Time of Acting, by Hiſſing—No Suſpicion can properly fall upon <hi>Miles</hi>—On his Part I have an Affidavit, by which he declares he went to the Houſe upon the Eighteenth of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi> for the Purpoſe of ſeeing Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi> act the Part of <hi>Shylock,</hi> and the Part of Sir <hi>Archy Macſarcaſm,</hi> in an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment; in which Parts I underſtand he has always acquitted himſelf with great Applauſe—He ſays the Audience was very noiſy, at the Time of drawing up the Curtain, and he, not approving altogether of Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi>'s Conduct, joined in ſome Degree with the Noiſe of the Houſe; ſo far he admits, but ſays he did it merely becauſe he thought Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi> ought,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0187601100:59"/>
after what he ſaid, to make ſome little Conceſſion to the Public—That he did not do it with any View or Intention of driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him from his Profeſſion—In ſhort, that he was in no Combination, and had no Malice againſt <hi>Macklin.</hi> Thus it ſtands upon Mr. <hi>Miles</hi>'s Affidavit. I apprehend therefore, with Deference to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, from the whole of the Caſe, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears there was no Malice, or Intention of Malice—That <hi>Miles</hi> went there as a Spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator—That what be did was no more than expreſſing his Diſapprobation of <hi>Macklin,</hi> as every Perſon in a Play-houſe generally does, if they diſlike a Performance—That he conſidered himſelf as having a Right to do it, and if any Conſequence aroſe from it, by that Behaviour, Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi> may have his Remedy by Action—But I truſt, in ſuch a Caſe as this, your Lordſhips will never let an Information go againſt him.</p>

Offence againſt the People; and <hi>Clarke</hi> tells your Lordſhip, that finding a Majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Audience in this, he did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in ſaying, off, off, and hiſſing, and ſtriking the Board againſt the Scenes and Box, finding a Majority of the Audience calling to <hi>Macklin</hi> to ſubmit and beg Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, he joined with the reſt. That he then ſent a Note to Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi> ſtates; he threw the Note upon the Stage, which was a Note to <hi>Coleman,</hi> to beg he would come upon the Stage to make Peace; to deſire <hi>Macklin</hi> to quiet the Audience, which he was told he might, if he would beg their Pardon; he ſays, Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> did not come upon the Stage; and then Mr. <hi>Clarke</hi> tells your Lordſhips, he went away and left the Houſe. One of the Affidavits ſtates, that he was upon the Stage afterwards, and Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> came there; but he denies that, and ſays he went to <hi>Drury Lane</hi> directly.</p>

Denies, that to his Knowledge or Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half that, on making his Appearance in ſaid Box, he was ſaluted with three Chears, with waving of Hats, bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhing of Sticks, or that he received any Salutation whatſoever, with Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment and Satisfaction, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned any Salutation made to him.</p>
                        <p>Denies, that as the Curtain was drawing up, he made any Signal, with his Hat, to the Audience, or any Thing elſe to make an Outrage of Hiſſing or Hooting, or to cry off, off, off.</p>
                        <p>Saith, that as ſoon as the Curtain drew up, and two of the Performers of the Play came on the Stage, a great many of the Audience in the Pit cried off, off, off, and the Players with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew from off the Stage, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Mr. <hi>Charles Macklin,</hi> in the Dreſs of <hi>Shylock,</hi> came on the Stage, when ſome Altercation or Diſpute aroſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſaid <hi>Macklin</hi> and ſome Perſons in the Pit, when ſaid <hi>Macklin</hi> went off the Stage, and took off the Dreſs of <hi>Shylock,</hi> and came on the Stage again, in his common Dreſs, when he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

                        <p>Admits he had a Board, or falſe Rail in his Hand, covered with red, which was looſe on the Top of the Box, where he leant over, which Deponent

believes takes off, and puts on, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally; and admits he made a Noiſe with ſaid Board, by ſtriking it againſt the Box and Scenes; but denies, to his Knowledge or Belief, he menaced or threatened ſaid <hi>Macklin</hi> with the ſame.</p>
                        <p>Saith, that ſaid <hi>Macklin</hi> continued obſtinate in not making a Submiſſion, and the Audience beginning to be more violent than ever, Deponent wrote a Note to Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> the Manager of ſaid Houſe, to deſire he would come on the Stage, which Deponent thought would be the only Way to put an End to the Diſturbance; but ſaid <hi>Macklin</hi> refuſed to come, and Deponent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon went to ſaid <hi>Coleman</hi> in the Green Room, and deſired he would appear on the Stage, and inform the Audience, that whilſt ſaid <hi>Macklin</hi> lay under their Diſpleaſure, that he ſhould not appear again on the Stage, until he had made a proper Submiſſion to the Public, or uſed Words to that Effect, and the reaſon of Deponent's ſo doing was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he apprehended it was moſt likely to put an End to the Diſturbance.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Saith, he hath been informed and believes, that ſaid <hi>Coleman</hi> did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that Evening come on ſaid Stage, and addreſs himſelf to the Audience; and ſaith, he never preconcerted any Signals with <hi>William Auguſtus Miles, John Stephen James, Ralph Aldus, Thomas Leigh</hi> and <hi>James Sparks,</hi> or any of them, to be given by him, ſaid <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph Clarke,</hi> on ſaid 18th of <hi>November,</hi> at Theatre Royal, <hi>Covent Garden.</hi> But, on the contrary, Deponent ſaith he was, before 18th of ſaid <hi>November,</hi> and whilſt the Diſturbance was making in ſaid Houſe that Evening, a total Stranger to ſaid <hi>Miles, James, Aldus Leigh</hi> and <hi>Sparks,</hi> and never had any Converſation with them, or any or either of them, touching ſaid <hi>Macklin,</hi> or any Thing elſe, except that Deponent met ſaid <hi>Miles</hi> by Accident that Night, as he was going behind the Scenes to the Green Room, to Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> as

                        <p>Denies, he called upon ſaid <hi>Macklin,</hi> to kneel down and aſk Pardon, but admits he cried off, off, off, which ſeemed to Deponent to be the general Senſe of the Audience then preſent; and denies he did in Conjunction with <hi>Miles, James, Aldus, Leigh</hi> and <hi>Sparks,</hi> or any of them, or with any other Perſon, compel the Managers of ſaid Theatre to diſcharge ſaid <hi>Macklin</hi> from his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy, Deponent having no ſuch Wiſh,

Deſire or Intention; but verily believes, that if ſaid <hi>Macklin</hi> had made a proper Submiſſion to the Audience, the ſame would have been accepted, by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority thereof, which would have put an End to the Diſturbance.</p>
                        <p>Denies, that he ever entered into any Combination, Conſpiracy, or Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with ſaid <hi>Miles, James, Aldus Leigh</hi> and <hi>Sparks,</hi> or any of them, or any other Perſon againſt ſaid <hi>Macklin</hi> in order to diſcharge him from the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre, on ſaid 18th of <hi>November,</hi> or any other Time.</p>

               <p>I will tell your Lordſhip how that Matter ſtands, and then your Lordſhip will judge how far Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi> was wrong, in regard to <hi>Sparks.</hi> The Fact is, that Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi> was attacked the firſt Night, and upon his firſt Appearance in <hi>Macbeth.</hi> He had not been uſed to that Sort of Behaviour during forty Years, and was very much aſtoniſhed what could oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion it—Three Perſons informed him (one of whom hath now made an Affida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit)
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0187601100:78"/>
that <hi>Sparks</hi> and <hi>Reddiſh</hi> were the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who occaſioned the Tumult in the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery the firſt Night—Then upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent <hi>Saturday</hi> (it was Upon a <hi>Saturday</hi> he firſt applied) Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi> finding all the News-papers, Day after Day, Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Evening, pouring out the moſt virulent Abuſe upon him, calling him Murderer, Villain, and the moſt oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious Names of every ſort, and Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphs deſiring the Public to drive him from the Stage, if he ever appeared again; he went upon the Stage with a large Bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of Papers, the Papers of a Week, (as I am informed, I was not there—but I think it is ſo upon the Affidavits) he ſaid he had been long in their Service, and there was his Reward, pointing to the Bundle of Papers of the whole Week, which he held in his Hands, full of every Scurrility that could be inſerted in News Papers, poured out upon him, and Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph's, deſiring the Public to drive him from the Stage, and ſubmitted to their Judgment, whether they would permit him to play the Characters that Night—that he had been informed <hi>Sparks</hi> and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0187601100:79"/>
                  <hi>Reddiſh</hi> were the Perſons who begun the Riot. Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi> agreed with me, that News Paper Paragraphs were odious, and it appeared to me not to be a deſirable Way for Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi> to refute, even <hi>Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh</hi> upon his Oath—he readily concurred with me; and as he could not get People to prove it upon Oath, he was to procure the Papers, and read the Proof on <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday.</hi>

               <p>I fancy your Lordſhip miſtakes the Fact at preſent in Favour of Mr. <hi>Sparks;</hi> for the Point about which, theſe Parties diſputed, was the Unſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factorineſs of the Proof inſiſted upon; and the Fact to be decided by this ſingular Tribunal was, whether Mr. <hi>Reddiſh</hi> had hiſſed? <hi>Sparks</hi> adopts the Charge as far as reſpected him; but, ſays he, though I did hiſs, which I have a right to do, yet, <hi>Reddiſh</hi> being an Actor, it is Matter of Imputation upon him; and I, as his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, will make good the Charge; the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0187601100:80"/>
Point to be tried was, whether they were truly or falſely charged?</p>

               <p>That don't vary it; he charges <hi>Sparks</hi> with hiſſing, and brings the Proof upon the Stage—charging both him and <hi>Reddiſh,</hi> and appeals in that way; that was wrong, he ſhould have applied to the Laws of the Country; and if he would not, he ſhall not come here for an extraordinary Interpoſition—I go upon the Ground of <hi>Sparks</hi>'s being more guilty than any, againſt whom the Rules are gone—that may be taken to the Grand Jury—but with regard to <hi>Leigh,</hi> the Rule muſt be made abſolute, as it was enlarged for him; and the Rule muſt be diſcharged as to <hi>Sparks.</hi>
