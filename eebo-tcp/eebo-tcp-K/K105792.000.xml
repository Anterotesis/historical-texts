            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Comedy of <hi>Le Glorieux,</hi> by M. Nericault Deſtouches, is the baſis on which <hi>The School for Arrogance</hi> has been formed. From that I have taken the plan, ſeveral of the characters, and ſome of the ſcenes. Difference of arrangement, addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional incidents, and what I deem to be eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential changes of character, have all been introduced. The Count has but little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance to the original: Lucy and Mac Dermot none. Lady Peckham is a new character, and was firſt ſuggeſted by a friend; who, conceiving highly of the contraſt which exiſts in life, between the pride of rank and the pride of riches, induſtriouſly ſought to ſtimulate and rouſe my imagination.</p>
            <p>The ſubject of the piece is greatly inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting to morals, and highly worthy of the Theatre. Conſcious of the great effects a perfect Comedy might have produced, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret the imperfections of the preſent. Some good it will do: I regret that it cannot do more. Perſuaded as I am of the moral
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0737501000:4"/>
dignity of the ſtage, I cheriſh an enthuſiaſtic wiſh to ſee the dramatic art ſurpaſs even all its former ſublime efforts. Among the pleaſures of the imagination, how frequently has its place been the firſt! Happy indeed ſhould I be, could my ſucceſs add the ſmalleſt impulſe to the exertions of Genius: ineffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly happy, would but this noble art once more boldly aſſert its rank; and render it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, not only the general love and delight of mankind, but the veneration of the wiſe.</p>
            <p>It is with peculiar pleaſure that I here ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge how much I am indebted to the conduct of Mr. Marſhal; who, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the prejudices which it was ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined Mr. Harris laboured under, reſpecting me, acted, for a time, in my behalf, as the author of the piece. Though anxiouſly zealous for its ſucceſs, he ſtill continued impartially attentive to the intereſts of all parties; and ſacrificed his own feelings to promote what he conceived to be a public good.</p>
            <p>The tribute of juſtice is alſo due to Mr. Harris. This tribute I am happy to have an opportunity to pay. And, that I may
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0737501000:5"/>
now be conſiſtent, as I always have been, in my private and public language to Mr. Harris, I will here inſert a copy of a letter which I wrote to him, when the comedy had been twice performed.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE patiently waited the proper moment in which to write to you. That moment I hope is now come. I ſhould be guilty of injuſtice, were I any longer to delay expreſſing my ſenſe of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety with which you have acted, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively to The School for Arrogance, after you had every reaſon to ſuppoſe it mine. Such conduct, Sir, is highly honourable; and is not only productive of the beſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, but muſt ſecure the beſt and moſt permanent applauſe. That you had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived diſadvantageous ideas of me I knew; though I have no doubt but I ſhall ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately convince you that, even ſuppoſing me to be miſtaken, my motives have been laudable ***** <note n="†" place="bottom">A ſingle phraſe, which relates entirely to myſelf, is here omitted.</note>.

                  <p>Oh! As for that, honey, let him alone. The nobleſt blood of France, aye, and what is better, of Ireland too, trickles to his finger's ends. The Villars and the O'Connol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.</p>

                  <speaker>Mac D.</speaker>
                  <p>He is viry willing to marry the young Lady, but not her family. His pride and his paſſion have had many a tough battle about that, d'ye ſee. Only think! A direct deſcindant of the former kings of Ireland, and collateral couſin to a priſent peer of France, to beſmear and beſmoulder his dignity by rubbing it againſt porter butts, vinegar caſks, and beer barrels.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
                  <p>Miſs Lucy is indeed a lovely girl, animated to exceſs, and ſometimes apparently giddy and flighty: but ſhe has an excellent underſtanding, and a noble heart; and theſe are ſuperior to birth, which is indeed a thing of mere accident.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mac D.</speaker>
                  <p>Faith, and that it is—I, a ſimple Iriſhman, as I am—why now, I would have been born a duke, had they been civil enough to have aſked my conſint.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
                  <p>The Count fell in love with her at the convent, to which ſhe was ſent to improve her French.</p>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes—ſhe ſaw me friendleſs, and conceived a generous and diſintereſted affection
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0737501000:13"/>
for me.—He has followed her to England; has taken apartments in our neighbourhood, and lives in ſplendour—yet is not rich.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mac D.</speaker>
                  <p>Um, um.—No—But then he is a Colonel in the Iriſh brigade; and, beſide his pay, has ſacrit ſupplies.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lydia.</speaker>
                  <p>From whom?</p>

                  <speaker>Lydia.</speaker>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mac D.</speaker>
                  <p>To ſpake the truth, that now is his failing.—An if it was not for that, oh! he would be the jewel of a maſter!—He trates his infariors with contimpt, keeps his diſtance with his aquals, and values the rubbiſhing duſt of his great grandfathers above diamonds!</p>

                  <p>His character is in perfect contraſt to that of his humble rival, Sir Samuel Sheepy; who, even when he addreſſes a footman, is all bows and affability; whoſe chief diſcourſe is, Yes, if you pleaſe, and, No, thank you; and who, in the company of his miſtreſs, ſtammers, blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and bluſhes, like a great boy.</p>

                  <p>A bachelor, and only fifty; rich, of a good family, and a great favourite with Lady Peckham, by never having the courage to contradict her.</p>

                  <p>Why, there now! You talk of the Count's pride! Here is this city lady as proud as ten counts! Her own coach horſes, ready harneſſed, don't carry their heads higher! And then ſhe is as inſolent, and as vulgar, and—Hem!</p>

                  <p>Chequered are the ſcenes of life. Pleaſure and pain, joy and grief, auſterity and laughter, intermingling, weave a motley web. Our prejudices are our puniſhments: they cling about us, warp our actions, diſtort our manners, render us the food of ſatire, the mockery of fools, and torture us, as wailing ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chins are tormented to make ſport for boys. Error and folly impede the progreſs of perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

Truth alone can make men wiſe and happy. Myſelf the ſacrifice of falſehood and miſtake, feebly have I ſtriven to ſtem the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and here my taſk, and here I hope my troubles end.</p>
