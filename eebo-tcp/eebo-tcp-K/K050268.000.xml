            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AS all Evils are to be diſcovered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can expect their Remedy, this Work proceeds in that Order.</p>
            <p>We ſhall never attempt the reſtoring our Manufactures, if we do not firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the Cauſes of their Decay.</p>
            <p>The following Work does not complain of the Evil with Reproach, and to expoſe the Indolence of the Age, whatever Room there might have been for ſuch a Satyr.</p>
            <p>But ſeriouſly repreſents the Grievance, and earneſtly moves our Superiors to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the proper Remedies.</p>
            <p>It is not the War, it is not the Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of This Power, or the Inveteracy of That, which can hurt the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, at leaſt not fatally.</p>
            <p>Our Miſchiefs are at Home, and the Remedy is at Home: We may cure the Evil with the utmoſt Eaſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1213901500:5"/>
But if we will be <hi>Felo de ſe</hi> in Trade, if we will cut the Throat of our own Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures, if we will pull them down with our own Hands, we ſhould have our Trade Buried at a Croſs-way, with a Stake dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thro' it, and an Inſcription, <hi>Here lies Buried the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Trade, having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd it ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Tract regards no Faction or Parties; no Complaint againſt publick or private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or Management; but 'tis a Complaint of an unhappy Humour among us all, that we will Diſcourage and Deſtroy our own Manufactures, and ruin our ſelves.</p>
            <p>May the National Wiſdom reſtrain this Folly; may the Poor obtain ſuch Help, and Trade ſuch Relief, as the Diſtreſs of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and People call for, and the End of this Work, and the Author's Wiſh, will be fully Anſwered.</p>

AN ACCOUNT of the <hi>Preſent Condition</hi> of the MANUFACTURES of GREAT BRITAIN.</head>
         <div type="introduction">
            <head>The INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>BEFORE I enter into the Subſtance of the Queſtion now before me, and that I may make as little Pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as poſſible in a Thing of ſuch Importance, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to lay down in plain and direct Terms, ſo as may admit of no Cavils or Diſputes, what I mean, and how I would be underſtood by the Words, <hi>The Manufactures of Great Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the Manufactures of <hi>Great Britain</hi> (and of which I ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, that they are now in a declining and decaying Condition) I mean the Woollen Manufactures, ſuch as Broad and Narrow Cloths, Serges, Kerſies, Druggets, Bays, Sayes, Perpets, Stuffs, Stockings, Hats, Flannels, and all thoſe woollen Goods generally uſed for Wearing-Apparel, Furniture of Houſes, and ſuch-like neceſſary Purpoſes; and as are made by the Labour of our People, for Uſe or Sale at Home (that is to ſay, in <hi>Great Britain</hi>) or for Exportation Abroad, of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Kind, and by whatever Names; for they bear ſo great a Variety of Names (eſpecially the <hi>Norwich</hi> and <hi>Spittle-Fields</hi> Goods) that it would be as endleſs as it is needleſs to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Particulars.</p>
            <p>That this Manufacture is a thing of great Importance, of a vaſt Magnitude, and a Value beyond all poſſible Calculation, I ſuppoſe I need not ſpend time to prove; 'tis deſcrib'd in the beſt manner to be underſtood, by taking Notice, that it not only uſes and works up all the Wool which grows in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but a very great Quantity both from <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Ireland, Barbary, Turkey,</hi> and other Places where-ever it can be had, and of which I ſhall have occaſion to take notice again in its Place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:1213901500:7"/>
That this Manufacture was once in a flouriſhing Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, vaſtly extended abroad, and prodigiouſly conſum'd at home; was carried on to the Employment and Enriching of innumerable Multitudes of People, and Families of People, 'till it had made <hi>England</hi> (where its Center is fix'd) the moſt opulent, populous, wealthy, and powerful Nation in the World; all this I not acknowledge only, but if it ſhould be diſputed, am ready to make appear at large upon all Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
            <p>It is likewiſe evident, that this flouriſhing Manufacture has riſen from ſmall Beginnings, and was at firſt reſcued (as it were) out of Captivity in a ſtrange Land, where (like <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi>) it ſuffer'd Bondage, and was engroſs'd by Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers who had no Title to it, having none of its Principles, no Materials for carrying it on <hi>De Jure,</hi> in their own Right, no, nor <hi>De Facto,</hi> in their Poſſeſſion; but ſerch'd them from us, and then arbitrarily ſold back the Goods made of them to us at their own Price, enriching their People with the Profits of the Manufacture, while (<hi>Spaniard-</hi>like) we ſtarv'd with the Mines of Gold in our own keeping.</p>
            <p>From this Captive-State, this miſerable abandon'd Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it was reſcued, by the Policy and Wiſdom of our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and the impolitick and fooliſh Management of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who by their Religious Tyranny, and their Civil Fury, drove their own People over to us to ſeek Bread and Liberty, in return for which they gave us Wealth and Trade, taught our Women to Spin, and our Men to Weave; ever ſince this we have made the Manufacture our own, and are now able to teach our Teachers, having infinitely improv'd the Kinds, as well as encreas'd the Quantity; have made not only innumerable new-invented Sorts, but have alſo made thoſe Sorts or Kinds of Goods much better than ever the <hi>Flemmings</hi> were able to make them before, eſpecially the Broad Cloths, which are improved to ſuch a Degree, and brought to ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as they were never capable of before, or ſo much as to believe poſſible.</p>
            <p>That by this very Article, <hi>England,</hi> tho' not an Inch of Land larger, either in Length or Breadth, the Soil not an Ounce richer than it was capable of being made before, the Climate not one Degree warmer, and without any one Advantage of Nature, more than it had before; yet by a moderate, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a juſt and reaſonable Calculation, between the Year 1490, in the beginning of King <hi>Hen.</hi> VII. when we began to manufacture our own Wool, and the Year 1726, has encreas'd her People from under two Millions, to above ſeven Millions,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1213901500:8"/>
raiſed the Value of Lands ſo, that what was then worth <hi>50l. per Annum,</hi> is now worth <hi>1000l. per Annum,</hi> as may be ſeen by the Rate of Subſidies, and by other Rules of Calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and which has raiſed the Value of Perſonal Wealth to ſuch a Degree, as admits no Compariſon, no Calculation, and hardly any Imagination; inſomuch that Some are of opinion, that taking the Wealth of this Nation at the Medium of Time, between the Conqueſt, and the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that is to ſay, about the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> II. and excepting only the Wealth of Churches and Monaſterys, which indeed was great, there is now more Silver in <hi>England</hi> than there was then Block Tin, more Gold than they had Copper, and more Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds and Pearl than they had <hi>Briſtol</hi> Stones.</p>
            <p>This Increaſe of People, and of the Real and Perſonal Wealth of <hi>England,</hi> may be ſaid to be all owing to the Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Manufacture; and to bring it all to the Point, <hi>viz.</hi> that this Woollen Manufacture has gone on encreaſing ever ſince, even to this Time, or (as I may more properly ſay) to Our time, 'till its Magnitude is ſuch, that we may ſay it is too great, and that not too great for the Country only, but too great for the whole World.</p>
            <p>It is a ſtrange Advance made in this Argument, and at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of it too, to ſay the Manufacture of <hi>England</hi> is too great for the World; but I cannot go back from it; and upon a ſerious Reflexion on its real Magnitude, as it now is; and yet how much greater it is poſſible to make it, that is to ſay, how many Countries, and, as I may ſay, Millions of People are yet unconcerned in it, and unemployed by it, I do inſiſt, that were the Wool of <hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> kept entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at home, the Quantity encreas'd as it might be, and all that Quantity manufactured at home, as it alſo might be, if thoſe other Countries were ſet to work, the People of <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> are able to make more Woollen Manufactures than all the known Inhabitants of the World would wear; To ſuch a Perfection of Working are the People arrived; to ſuch an immenſe Quantity is the Wool brought to amount, to ſuch a prodigious Number are the People multiplied; and the laſt Article indeed is the moſt eſſential of all the reſt, for not withſtanding the Encreaſe of the Wool, which is a Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy in it ſelf, yet to ſuch a Degree are the People alſo encreas'd, that all the Wool of <hi>England,</hi> however (as I ſay) encreas'd, and all the Wool of <hi>Ireland,</hi> from whence no Wool was had in thoſe Days, and all the Wool of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which was not uſed at all in <hi>England</hi> in thoſe times, is now manufactured in <hi>England,</hi> by leſs than one quarter part of our People.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:1213901500:9"/>
This may ſeem ſtrange at firſt View, and eſpecially when we ſee how many Thouſands, nay, how many Millions of People are employ'd in this one Manufacture. But let me be allowed a ſhort Digreſſion, and I ſhall ſoon prove it by giving you a View of the ſeveral Countries in <hi>England,</hi> where the Woollen Manufactures are made, and where <hi>not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>N.B. <hi>Before I begin, I muſt obſerve, that when I ſay, ſuch Counties make no Woollen Manufactures, I do not mean that many of the People might not knit their own Stockings, ſpin and weave Woollens for their own Uſe and Wearing, as in ſome Places they do Linnen, where yet we do not ſay the Linnen is carried on as a Manufacture; but it is to be underſtood that they make no Particular or General Manufacture for Sale, and for Trade, to be carried out of the Bounds of the Towns or Counties where they are ſo made.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The County of <hi>Cornwall</hi> is not known to have any Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture. <hi>Devonſhire</hi> indeed, the next County immediately on this Side, is full of Manufacture; but we ſee nothing in <hi>Cornwall</hi> but Miners, and Diggers in the Earth for Lead, Copper, and Block Tin; as for the poor Women, they are employ'd in waſhing the Oar; and the Men who are not at work in the Mines are Refiners, Smelters, and Melters of the Oar and Mettals, or elſe are Husbandmen, Fiſhermen and Sailers; but no Woollen Manufacture.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The four large Counties of <hi>Kent, Suſſex, Surry,</hi> and <hi>Southampton,</hi> have very little apparent Manufacture. In former times there were ſome Cloathings about <hi>Guildford, Godlaming, Darking,</hi> and <hi>Farnham</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> and likewiſe at <hi>Tenterden, Cranbrook, Goudburſt,</hi> and in the <hi>Wild</hi> of <hi>Kent,</hi> in both which Counties they made a very good (tho' low-priz'd) Medley Cloth for the middling Peoples wear, but 'tis all gone, extinct, except a little not worth naming.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The great City of <hi>London</hi> is now eminent for the Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Manufacture of Stuffs, Chamlets, and ſeveral Goods, ſuch as were formerly made at <hi>Norwich;</hi> but as this is in a manner confin'd to <hi>Spittle-Fields,</hi> and a few adjacent Streets, and to a very little in <hi>Southwark,</hi> it may be truly ſaid, that not one twentieth Part of the City and County of <hi>Middleſex</hi> are concerned at all in it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Inland Counties of <hi>Bucks, Hertſord, Cambridge, Bedford,</hi> and <hi>Huntingdon;</hi> theſe have none of them any Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Manufactures, except that of late Years the <hi>Spittle-Fields</hi> Manufacturers have employed ſome particular Places in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1213901500:10"/>
thoſe Counties for ſpinning Worſted Yarn, but 'tis ſent up to <hi>London</hi> to be manufactured.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Even <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi> it ſelf, tho' it is the inexhauſtible Fund of Wool for all the Eaſt and South-Eaſt Part of <hi>England,</hi> and is the chief Support of their Manufacture, yet has no Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of its own, nor do we ſo much as ſee the Women and Children employ'd, or any Spinning among them; tho' it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo an exceeding large and populous County; but they are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally employ'd in Trade or Husbandry at home, or upon the Seas abroad.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The County of <hi>Stafford,</hi> and of <hi>Cheſter</hi> and <hi>Darby,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly taken up in making Cheeſe, breeding Horſes and Cows, digging Lead, and making Crockery Ware, have very little or no Woollen Manufacture, except about <hi>Tamworth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Northumberland, Cumberland, Durham,</hi> and the Eaſt and North Riding of <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> are the ſame, and have no Woollen Manufacture, except a ſmall Quantity of Yarn Stockings made at <hi>Richmond</hi> and <hi>Barnard Caſtle,</hi> and a ccarſe ſtrip'd Stuff for Hangings at <hi>Darlington.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. All the Counties of <hi>Wales</hi> put together, produce no Manufacture for Sale, or that come out of their own bounds, except Flannel, with a very few and very coarſe Yarn Stockings.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Nor do the two large Counties of <hi>Monmouth</hi> and <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and two Thirds of <hi>Shropſhire,</hi> ſo much as pretend to any Woollen Manufacture, but are taken up with planting Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards, making Syder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that notwithſtanding the exceeding Greatneſs and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Woollen Manufacture, and that (as I have ſaid) it ſeems to be too great, even for the whole World, yet it employs by far the leaſt Part of <hi>England,</hi> and even the leaſt Part of the People in many of thoſe Counties where it is made.</p>
            <p>Nay, even in thoſe Counties where great Branches of the Woollen Manufacture are eſtabliſhed, yet there are other Manufactures which employ greater numbers of their People: For Example,</p>
            <p>The four Capital Diſtricts where the Woollen Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of <hi>England</hi> is ſeated, are thus divided:</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Weſt-riding of <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> including the Eaſt-ſide of <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> the County of <hi>Weſtmorland</hi> and <hi>Richmondſhire,</hi> and Part of <hi>Cumberland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet in this very Weſt-riding is the great Iron Manufacture of <hi>Sheffield;</hi> and the County round it, which is called <hi>Hallam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> is ſaid to employ at leaſt an hundred thouſand People.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:1213901500:11"/>
2. The Weſt Side of <hi>Wilts,</hi> and the whole Counties of <hi>Glouceſter, Warwickſbire,</hi> and <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and part of <hi>Shrop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire;</hi> and yet in the two Counties of <hi>Warwick</hi> and <hi>Worceſter</hi> are carried on the great Hard-ware Manufacture of Iron, Braſs, Steel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at <hi>Birmingham,</hi> and the Nailors which it is known to employ are a prodigious Number of People, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more than at <hi>Sheffield;</hi> as alſo, the Manufacture of Glaſs at <hi>Sturbridge,</hi> beſides ſeveral other ſmaller Manufactures al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of different kinds; add to which, the multitude of Dairies and Cheeſe-makers in thoſe particular Counties.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The great and populous Counties of <hi>Devon</hi> and <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet,</hi> the moſt intent perhaps upon the Woollen Manufacture of any in all <hi>Britain,</hi> yet how is the firſt diverted by the fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Trade upon both its Shores, its Cyder Trade in the <hi>South-Hams,</hi> and alſo in their Sea-affairs as well the Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping as the Merchandize; and the other in Grazing and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of Lead and Coal, which employs many thouſands of their People.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Counties of <hi>Eſſex, Norfolk,</hi> and <hi>Suffolk</hi> carry on the fourth, but not the leaſt Branch of the Woollen Manufacture, and yet they tell us there are above thirty thouſand Men em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed out of thoſe three Counties always at Sea. <hi>Suffolk</hi> is two Thirds of it, both Land and People, employed in Dairies and feeding Cattle and Fowls for <hi>London;</hi> and they tell us, that the two Counties of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and <hi>Suffolk</hi> only, ſend every Year to <hi>London</hi> fifty thouſand Head of fat black Cattle, two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand fat Sheep and Lambs, fifty thouſand Firkins of Butter, and twenty thouſand Barrels of Oyſters, an hundred thouſand fatted Calves, with two Millions of Geeſe and Turkeys. How many of the People all That may keep em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, let others judge for me: However it will be granted that even in theſe three Counties where ſuch prodigious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures are produced, as <hi>Norwich</hi> Stuffs, the <hi>Sudbury</hi> Sayes and the <hi>Colcheſter</hi> Bayes, yet not one half of the People are employed in any.</p>
            <p>Add to this, the Multitudes of People in <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in making the Cotton Manufactures, about which alone they ſay there are two hundred thouſand People employed in the Town of <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> and within twelve Miles round it.</p>
            <p>Add to this alſo, the Multitudes now employed in the ſame County in the Linnen Manufacture, which is ſo encreaſed of late Years there as to employ near as many as the Cotton, only that it extends over a greater compaſs of Land.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:1213901500:12"/>
Add to them all, That even in thoſe Manufacturing Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, where the greateſt Part of the Woollen Work is carried on, and where the moſt People are employed by it, not the Lawyers, not the Phyſicians, not the Gentry, not the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, not the Citizens, or Towns-people, that is to ſay, not the Shop-keepers, not all the Handicrafts, ſuch as Smiths, Carpenters, Maſous, Bricklayers, Shoemakers, and of the laſt, not their Wives or Children, ſo much as ſet a Hand, no not a Finger, to any Part of this great Manufacture, except it be to wear it out and conſume it.</p>
            <p>In a word, except the Weaving part, and the Managing part, the main Streſs of the Manufacture depends upon, and is performed by the Women and Children, and that of thoſe few Counties only.</p>
            <p>The Concluſion from all this is directly to the Caſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, thus:</p>
            <p>If the Manufacture of <hi>England</hi> is ſo prodigious great, and yet employs but ſo ſmall a Part of the People, what might it not be brought to, and how would it be (as I ſaid) too great for the whole World, if all the Inhabitants, I mean all the looſer In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, ſuch as are fit to work, and who would gladly work if they could be employed, were ſet in upon it? What an infinite Quantity of Goods would they make, and how would they uſe up, not only all the Wool that <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> could produce, but even more Wool than they could produce, tho' the ſaid Quantity was to be encreaſed to twice or three times as much as it is, and that none was clandeſtinely carried away to other Parts?</p>
            <p>But as I ſaid this Part ſhould be treated as a Digreſſion, I will not run it out too long. It comes of courſe next to conſider the preſent State of this great Manufacture, how it ſtands, and then bring it all to theſe great and neceſſary En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries.<list>

            <head>CHAP. I. Of the original State of the Woollen Manufacture of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> with ſome juſt Deductions from what it has been in former Times to what it is Now.</head>
            <p>AS I have obſerved in the Introduction that the Woollen Manufacture was (like the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi>) reſcued from a State of Captivity, and from a ſtrange Land, we muſt make that out a little plainer: The Caſe was thus.</p>
            <p>In the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> III. of glorious Fame, tho' <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was thought to be at that time in the moſt flouriſhing Condition that Hiſtory gives us any Account of: The Glory of her Arms, the Vigour of the Monarch, and of his eldeſt Son, the Gaiety and Splendor of the Court were ſuch as never were known before; the Laſt was the Reſort of all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, Youth and Gentry of <hi>Europe;</hi> the ſecond was the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration and Wonder of the World; the greateſt Princes made their Court to them, and Kings were Captives in their Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: <hi>England</hi> was the Terror of the World; The Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of <hi>Creſſy</hi> and <hi>Poictiers,</hi> and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſtating the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> depos'd by his Rival, were Actions that brought all the Powers of <hi>Europe</hi> to ſtand at Gaze, and as it were to dread the turning of the Arms of <hi>England</hi> ſo much as to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Dominions: Hiſtory will confirm all the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; I have no room for long Quotations:</p>
            <p>Yet all this while Trade ſhared no Advantages among the Conqueſts of the Day; nor do we find the leaſt Concern in any of the Councils of that Glorious Prince, or of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of State, for the Propagation of Commerce, at home or abroad.</p>
            <p>Building publick and ſumptuous Edifices, great Churches and Monaſterys; making Feaſts, Balls, Tournaments; adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Windſor-</hi>Caſtle; inſtituting the famous Order of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; making League, and Alliances; expenſive Enterviews with Foreign Princes, ſuch as the Emperor and the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and keeping a magnificent <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logne,</hi> for almoſt a Year and a half at a time: Theſe things took up the Court, and turn'd the Eyes (I had almoſt ſaid turn'd the Heads) of the Nation, during that whole Reign. Things which tended to the Glory of the Kingdom, and the Honour of the Majeſty of the King, as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> ſaid of his great <hi>Babel</hi> that he had built; but, as we may add, theſe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1213901500:14"/>
glorious things gutted <hi>England</hi> of its Wealth, made the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch powerful and his People poor.</p>
            <p>In all his Parliaments we ſee not one Act for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of Trade, for the enlarging Commerce, for Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of the Poor, for ſetting up Manufactures; to ſpeak the Truth, I queſtion if the Word Manufacture or Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturer were known in the Country; and, for ought I ſee, as the Taylors were the Only Merchants, ſo the Shoemakers were the Greateſt Manufacturers in the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The bountiful Hand of Heaven had then, and from the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, given <hi>England</hi> the greateſt Gift of Nature that the whole World could be ſaid to enjoy, <hi>viz.</hi> the Wool: The diligent and ſenſible Nations round us underſtood it, and how to value it; and, which was more, underſtood how to improve it; and for that end, throng'd to the very outmoſt Bounds of the Continent of <hi>Europe</hi> (this way) to be near it, and that they might bring it over as cheap as poſſible.</p>
            <p>By this I mean the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> where the induſtrious Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by the Help of the Wool from <hi>England,</hi> fell to work in ſuch a Manner as that there they made then, as we have ſince done in <hi>England,</hi> Cloaths for all the known Parts of the World.</p>
            <p>This brought the many Thouſands and Millions of People to inhabit thoſe drowned, overflowed Bogs and Marſhes, which before that were ſcarce thought fit for human Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to dwell in, and which were dwelt in only as Retreats and Faſtneſſes to ſecure the fugitive Nations from the Incurſions of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and afterwards of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This very Trade brought People, and built Cities and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, even where the Sea allowed no footing, and the Land no Foundation; from hence, I ſay, the numberleſs Throngs of People came to dwell in that Country, and by degrees, by the Encreaſe of their Wealth, and by their indefatigable Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry (all the Effects of Trade and Manufacture) have brought it to be the richeſt Soil, the fulleſt of People and of great Cities and Towns, of any Country in the World.</p>
            <p>All this while <hi>England</hi> lay neglected to the laſt Degree; her Sons knocking their Heads againſt Stone-walls, and ranging the Field of War in foreign Countries, purſued their own Poverty, and ſought Miſery, for the Glory of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch.</p>
            <p>But at home it was all a Miſcellany of Sorrow: Villainage and Vaſſalage compriſed the Poor; Knighthood and Eſquire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip took up the middle Gentry; and Glory dwelt only among the Barons and Princes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:1213901500:15"/>
All the Trade we read of, was carrying their Wool abroad, to give Employment to the Poor of foreign Countries, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> and the <hi>Flemings;</hi> and this Wool, we may ſay, was the grand Fund of the Wealth, both of King and People.</p>
            <p>If the King made any Wars, and demanded Subſidies of his Parliament, as was too frequently the Caſe in the time of <hi>Edw.</hi> III, the grand Article of <hi>Ways and Means</hi> was to grant the King ten Shillings a Pack upon Wool, or twenty Shillings a Pack upon Wool, like our two Shillings and four Shillings <hi>per</hi> Pound upon Land; and once they came to ſuch a Height, (God forbid we ſhould ſee the like of our Lands) that the Parliament gave the King one Half Part of all the Wool it ſelf for his Wars in <hi>France;</hi> by the ſame Token that (as King <hi>Charles</hi> II. did too often) all the Money was ſpent, and no War with <hi>France</hi> begun neither; nor did the War break out 'till three Years after; ſo that when it came, they were ſain to give the King new Subſidies again; that is to ſay, another Tax upon the Exportation of Wool, and ſo over and over again ſeveral times.</p>
            <p>In this State of Indolence, or rather horrid Ignorance and Blindneſs, was this whole Nation, as it were, Philtred and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched, notwithſtanding all the Glory, the Wiſdom, the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy and good Government which King <hi>Edward</hi> III was ſo famed for.</p>
            <p>Like People buried alive in Sloth and Idleneſs they ſat ſtill, ploughed and ſowed as much Corn as ſerved juſt to feed them, ſheer'd their Sheep every Year, and, as it may be ſaid, threw away their Wool; went to the Wars, were knocked on the Head for the Honour of <hi>Old England,</hi> and the Glory of their great Kings; and this was the Round of Life, even from the Nobleman to the meaneſt Vaſſal, Peaſant or Labourer in the Nation.</p>
            <p>As to the poor Women and Children, they ſat at home, fared hard, lived poor and idle: the Women drudg'd at the Husbandry, and the Children ſar ſtill, blow'd their Fingers, pick'd Straws; and both might be ſaid not to live, but to ſlarve out a wretched time, then Die, and go, <hi>Where—</hi> who knows!</p>
            <p>As to Manufacture or Employment, we do not ſee room ſo much as to believe that they knew any thing of it; any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than it may be to make ſome very ordinary things which Nature <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Neceſſity put them upon for their own Covering, and hardly that</p>
            <p>In this miſerable Condition lay the Anceſtry of this dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Nation, who being but once let into the Method of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1213901500:16"/>
working the Wool, and ſome Authority ſupporting as well as encouraging them by ſtopping the Stream of its Exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſoon taſted the Sweets of it, ſoon fell heartily upon it, preſently became Maſters of the Performance, and in time ſupplanted the Encroachers; engroſſed the Wool, for it was their own before; redeem'd the Captives, and at laſt brought not only the Manufactures, but the Manufacturers too, over to <hi>England;</hi> for thouſands of the People followed the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture for Bread, and that they might get Employment; and this began the multiplying of the People too, as well as of their Wealth; for as Trade brings Wealth, ſo Work brings the Workmen together.</p>
            <p>It is juſt thus ſtill in <hi>England:</hi> Where-ever we ſee the Manufactures ſeated, there we ſee Multitudes of People col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected; the Labour gathers the Hands: and this was the firſt Occaſion of making thoſe ſtrict excluſive Laws for Pariſh Settlements, that the particular Pariſhes where ſuch Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures were ſet up might not be oppreſſed with the Numbers of Poor flocking in from other Pariſhes.</p>
            <p>Where the firſt Manufacturer's ſettled or ſet up, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>employed People preſently throng'd about them for Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Wages; and we find it to this day, that where the Manufactures are, the Country is always exceeding populous; This 'tis evident the Manufactures did not find, but made it ſo; 'tis true the Manufacture in moſt Places pitch'd its Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation in great Towns or Cities, ſuch as <hi>Norwich, Colcheſter, Canterbury, Exeter,</hi> and the like; but 'tis alſo certain that thoſe Cities, and eſpecially the adjacent Countries, are grown infinitely more populous by the ſettling of thoſe Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures among them, than they were before.</p>
            <p>This is farther proved by a general View of thoſe Parts of <hi>England</hi> where the People are not thus employed; for where the Inhabitants of a Country conſiſt only, or chiefly, of Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord and Tenant, Gentry and Shopkeepers, you ſee the Country much leſs throng'd; it is true that the Multitudes which live together in thoſe Places where the Manufactures are eſtabliſhed as above, do influence all the reſt of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by cauſing a greater Cultivation of the Lands, and greater Improvement of Eſtates, for Proviſions, which the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume; the Corn and the Cattle being brought from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteſt Parts for their Subſiſtence, and by conſequence the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are encreas'd there alſo:</p>
            <p>Yet we ſee the Country is inhabited in a more even man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the People live more at large and diſperſed, as the Farms
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1213901500:17"/>
and the Lands which they cultivate call them; they are ſpread as it were over the whole ſace of the Land.</p>
            <p>We ſee no ſuch Villages there as <hi>Leeds</hi> or <hi>Hallifax, Shef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> or <hi>Birmingham, Mancheſter</hi> or <hi>Froom, Taunton</hi> or <hi>Troubridge,</hi> in moſt of which, or on very little Ground near them, twenty to forty thouſand People are ſaid ſeverally to inhabit; and in three or four of them, as in <hi>Hallifax, Mancheſter, Bir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingham,</hi> and <hi>Froom,</hi> many more.</p>
            <p>But to go back to the Introduction of this Change: It was in the Reign of K. <hi>Hen.</hi> VII, and not before, when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> began the bold Adventure of Manufacturing their own Wool, (I mean began it in Quantity.) There had ſome Attempt been made before, and we are told of ſome Adventurers in Trade who having been over in <hi>Flanders</hi> and learned the Manner of it, but eſpecially having ſeen the Advantage of it, had brought over with them ſo much Knowledge as to learn the People to ſpin, (ſo many of them at leaſt as their Stocks could compaſs to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy) and others to Comb and Card the Wool, and ſo on, thro' all the other Parts of the Work; which went a little way, and was promiſing to go farther in time.</p>
            <p>But it is to be obſerved, that from the firſt Part of the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> VI, and thro' all that long Reign, and thro' the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> IV, and <hi>Richard</hi> III, the whole Nation was miſerably embroiled in the Civil Confuſions, ſuch as the Wars between the White Roſe and the Red; the Houſes of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> and <hi>York;</hi> and the ſeveral Inſurrections and Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of Affairs which naturally attended thoſe Quarrels.</p>
            <p>Every one knows that War is no Friend to Trade: Arts and Improvements, much leſs Manufacture, and the Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Poor, never plant, or at leaſt never thrive, in the Flame and Heat of War, eſpecially too the worſt of the kind, an Inteſtine, Civil, or to ſpeak juſtly of it, an Unnatural War.</p>
            <p>Times of Feud and Faction, Rebellion, Inſurrection, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and plundering, are no times for Improvement; and this may be a juſt Reaſon why the Beginnings of the Manufacture, which I have mentioned as above, took no conſiderable root during the Confuſions of War, both Civil and Foreign Wars, but eſpecially Civil Wars, which for ſixty Years almoſt without Intermiſſion vex'd this Nation.</p>
            <p>Perhaps a Manufacturer did, or ſuppoſe he had ſeated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at any particular Town or Place in the Country, had brought together ſome People, and had inſtructed them in the Work, <hi>viz.</hi> ſome Women to ſpin, ſome Men to comb, to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1213901500:18"/>
weave, to dreſs the Cloth, and had built a Fulling Mill to thicken the Cloths, and the like: Then come the two Armies into the Field, and they march over the Country where the poor Manufacturer is ſettled: If it be a friendly Army, and they are of the ſame Side, then the kindeſt thing that could be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was to call all the Poor Workmen away, eſpecially the young able-bodied Fellows, with their Bows and Arrows to encreaſe the Army: If it were the Enemy, then they all run away for fear of being forced. As for the Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, they are no body without the Men, for they cannot ſpin the Wool 'till the Men comb it, and when they have ſpun the Yarn, 'tis of no uſe when the Men are gone that ſhould weave it; and perhaps the Loom which it ſhould be wrought in, burnt by the Plunderings and Ravagings of the Soldiers.</p>
            <p>By this means (and I cannot doubt but this was often the Caſe) the Beginning of the Manufacture was check'd and put back, the poor Undertaker ruin'd and undone; and ſo you heard no more of the Attempt for ſome Years.</p>
            <p>This is as good an Account as I believe can be given why the Woollen Manufacture began among us no ſooner; why it had no Encouragement in <hi>England,</hi> at leaſt no conſiderable Encouragement, 'till the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> VII, and about the Year 1480, to 1490.</p>
            <p>The Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> was the firſt <hi>Halcyon</hi> Seaſon which <hi>England</hi> had ſelt, not for ſome Years only, but for ſome Ages, as will appear at large in the Hiſtories of thoſe Times: Either Wars abroad, or Wars at home, had vex'd the Nation, from the unfortunate Reign of <hi>Richard</hi> II. to that time; all the Circumſtances of thoſe Reigns will confirm it, I need not quote the Particulars, which are too many; the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was always in a Hurry and a Fright; here the Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Tyrants, there the Rebellions of People; here the Kings depos'd and murther'd, there the People ravag'd and plunder'd; now one King runs away, then another. <hi>Hen.</hi> VI. was upon the Throne, and in Priſon, alternately, five or ſix times; <hi>Edward</hi> IV. upon the Throne, and fled out of the Country, twice at leaſt; and ſo among the reſt.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Henry</hi> VII. took new Meaſures, and manag'd the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Affairs with the utmoſt Dexterity. He firſt humbled the too powerful Nobility, ſo to prevent Caballing and Rebellion; brought them to be all dependent upon him, and gradually im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſh'd them, while he hoarded up immenſe Sums of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney himſelf: In a word, his Reign was a whole Scene of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue and Deſign, among the great Ones; the King ever talking of War, and bluſtering at his Neighbours as if he
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1213901500:19"/>
would quarrel with every body; and got great Sums of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from his Parliament to begin a War (eſpecially againſt <hi>France</hi>) but put the Money in his Pocket, and never made any War at all, and (as ſome ſay) never intended it.</p>
            <p>But in the mean time (as theſe Cabals and Politicks at Court concerned no body but themſelves) his Reign, as to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, was all pacifick and quiet, and the Conſequence was vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, for now Induſtry began to hold up its Head, Trade be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſpread, the Merchants began to ſet up, and Navigation to be encouraged; the People of <hi>England</hi> began to look abroad and about them, and Colonies and Factories began in this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Reign to be planted, foreign Countries to be diſcovered, and new Worlds looked into; and Some tell us that <hi>Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pber Columbus</hi> having now diſcovered <hi>America,</hi> came over hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and made the firſt Offer for a farther Diſcovery to King <hi>Henry,</hi> and particularly to take poſſeſſion of it for him, but that the King (by the meer Narrowneſs of his Soul) declin'd the Expence of it.</p>
            <p>Alſo 'tis affirm'd, that ſeveral Voyages were made in this King's Reign to the Weſtern Shoars of <hi>Africk,</hi> and to the Gold Coaſt, and great Advantages made by it to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, bringing pure Gold back for the moſt worthleſs Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles: But this is not to the preſent Purpoſe, only thus far, that this being a Reign of proſound Peace, Arts and Commerce began to reliſh with the People, and they began to turn their Hands to ſeveral kinds of Improvement.</p>
            <p>Among the reſt, this of the Woollen Manufacture came principally into play. The King, who had liv'd abroad, as well in <hi>Flanders</hi> as in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Brittany,</hi> had ſeen with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, how not the <hi>Flemings</hi> only, but the <hi>French</hi> grew rich at the Expence of <hi>England,</hi> and how even they could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain mocking the Sloth and Weakneſs of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that ſhould let their Wool be carried out of the Kingdom, to be work'd up into Cloths and Stuffs; and in a word, be manufactured abroad, and then buy even the Cloths they wore of their own Wool ſo manufactured abroad.</p>
            <p>It muſt be conſeſs'd it deſerv'd Reproach, and when we come to look back upon it at this diſtance, we cannot help wondering at the Madneſs of the People, but there are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Examples of the unaccountable Stupidity of thoſe Ages, eſpecially of the common People, that if they were all to be brought upon the Stage, we ſhould ceaſe to wonder at any thing of this kind; as particularly, how they were blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given up to the abſolute Tyranny of the Nobility, in Civil Matters, and to the abſolute Government of the ignorant Prieſts, on the Side of Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:1213901500:20"/>
But not to dwell upon the Folly of thoſe Ages, I proceed to take a View of the Advances our Anceſtors made in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering this glorious Trade; and even in that, I ſhall not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large upon the little Beginnings, and unſucceſsful Attempts, which (as above) were made by private Purſes, and on private Experiments, before the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> VII. for if we may believe <hi>Fame,</hi> there were ſeveral private Eſſays made, for the engaging in, and carrying on a Manufacture of Woollen Cloth, before that Time, ſome of which began to promiſe Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs too; and the People began to reliſh the Thing, and taſte the Profit of it before.</p>
            <p>Had it not been ſo, we can hardly think that King <hi>Henry</hi> could, all at once, bring the People of <hi>England</hi> to a general Manufacturing, ſo as effectually to ſtop the Exportation of the Wool, as he certainly did in the eighteenth Year of his Reign, or thereabout.</p>
            <p>But ſeveral People having attempted it before, ſome without Succeſs, and ſome with; and the Thing beginning gradually to encreaſe and get ground in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> IV. the King, who (as above) having ſeen the innumerable Numbers of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple working at it abroad, and being thereby fully ſenſible of the Advantage it would be to his own Subjects, if they could be brought to engage in it at home, firſt ſet heartily about it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his own Subjects, encouraging thoſe that were engag'd in it, and promiſing Encouragement to others to go about it; ſo that he brought ſeveral Men of Intereſt among his Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and others, to eſpouſe it, and the Manufacture was ſet on foot in that manner in ſeveral Parts of <hi>England,</hi> and that with apparent Succeſs; as particularly, (if we may credit private Accounts) the firſt Appearance of the Woollen Manufacture of Cloth was at <hi>Wakefield,</hi> in the Weſt Riding of <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> being encouraged by an ancient Knight and Favourite of King <hi>Henry,</hi> of the Name of <hi>Savil,</hi> and ſome other Perſons of Rank, who had Eſtates in that Country, and who encourag'd their Tenants and Vaſſals to the Work. This <hi>Savil,</hi> I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to be ſome of the Anceſtors of the late Marquis of <hi>Hallifax,</hi> one of whoſe Titles is taken from the Town of <hi>Eland,</hi> in the ſame Part of the Country, and upon the Banks of the <hi>Calder,</hi> not far from <hi>Wakefield,</hi> of whom the Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are Lords <hi>Eland</hi> to this Day.</p>
            <p>The next Place to which the Manufacture ſpread, was the Town of <hi>Okingham</hi> in <hi>Berkſhire;</hi> where it did not continue long, or at leaſt was not contain'd in the narrow Bounds of that ſmall Place, but ſpread it ſelf to the larger Towns of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingſtoke</hi> and <hi>Andover</hi> in <hi>Hampſhire</hi> and <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> and to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1213901500:21"/>
               <hi>Reading</hi> and <hi>Newberry,</hi> in which four laſt Towns it continued even 'till within theſe few Years, to an extraordinary Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; but it is now remov'd farther Weſt, into <hi>Wiltſhire, Glouceſterſhire,</hi> &amp;c. Then the Counteſs of <hi>Richmond,</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to King <hi>Henry</hi> VII, encouraged ſome money'd Men to ſet it up again in the Villages about <hi>Woking,</hi> on the River <hi>Wey,</hi> where, or near which, ſhe liv'd, with a great and noble Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality, doing good to all the poor People round about her, and particularly by thus ſetling them to work, and that from thence began the Cloathing about <hi>Guildford, Godlaming, Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> &amp;c. all Towns in <hi>Surrey;</hi> and in other Places thereabouts, and which continues there (tho' decay'd) to this Day.</p>
            <p>It was ſome time after theſe private Perſons undertook the manufacturing of Wool, that King <hi>Henry,</hi> finding his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects begin to improve, and that the Goods they made were able to ſupply the ordinary Demand, or near it; cauſed the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of Wool to be prohibited, and foreign-made Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures alſo to be excluded, encouraging his People thereby to make larger Quantities of thoſe Goods at home.</p>
            <p>Nor did there need any greater Encouragement to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture, than thus ſhutting out the foreign Manufactures; for this encreaſing the Demand at home, the Price encreas'd of courſe, which ſufficiently rewarded the Labours of the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and encreas'd their Wages.</p>
            <p>I need not bring any Vouchers to prove, that this Encreaſe of Wages improved the Manufacture, or encreas'd the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Workmen; for now, not only the <hi>Engliſh</hi> fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Trade with Courage, and with Multitudes, but (as above) Multitudes follow'd the Manufacture out of <hi>Flanders,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by the Gain, and wanting Employment at home.</p>
            <p>Nor were theſe of the labouring Poor only, but abundance of the Maſter Manufacturers, and of thoſe the moſt skilful in the Workmanſhip; by whom the People here were ſoon inſtructed and perfected in the Knowledge, not of the Art on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in general, ſuch as in the Sorting, Combing, Carding, and otherwiſe managing the Wool, in Spinning, Weaving, Knit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but alſo in the ſeveral kinds of Goods fitted for the Markets, and demanded as well abroad as at home.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſecur'd the Trade to themſelves, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came firſt Maſters of the Woollen Manufacture; and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Flemings</hi> themſelves, who had for ſo many Ages eat the Bread out of their Mouths, were now their Aſſiſtants and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructors, in compleating them in the Knowledge of Dreſſing, Sheering, Perfecting, and Finiſhing the working Part; thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of the ſaid <hi>Flemings,</hi> and their Families, coming over
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1213901500:22"/>
hither for Work, and ſettling among them, and whoſe Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity became <hi>Engliſh,</hi> immediately after them, ſcarcely reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their foreign Names, or changing them, to conceal their Original.</p>
            <p>For it is to be obſerv'd, that it was not ſo eaſy a Matter for Foreigners to be naturalized among the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in thoſe times, as it is now, which made thoſe that found means to ſettle here, and turn their Hands to the Manufacture, take what care they could to conceal themſelves, and ſo to change their Sir-names, or at leaſt ſhorten and abridge them into differing Sounds, that they might be made to ſpeak <hi>Engliſh</hi> as much as poſſible, that is to ſay, to ſound like <hi>Engliſh:</hi> for Example; <hi>Jean de Somteres</hi> would be called <hi>John Sommers; Guillaume de Tournay, William Turner; Eſticnne D'Anvers, Stephen Danvers; Jaques de Franquemont, James Franks;</hi> and ſo of the reſt; by which all the <hi>Flemiſh, Dutch,</hi> and <hi>Walloon</hi> Names were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently turn'd into <hi>Engliſh.</hi> And thus of thoſe who had two or three Chriſtian Names (as is common among Foreigners) they turn'd the ſecond Chriſtian Name into a Sir-name, and from thence 'tis ſaid we have ſo many Families of ſuch Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>names among us to this Day; for Example, <hi>Jean Jaques de Buromeir,</hi> leaving out the Sir-name, was called <hi>John James; Guillaume Jacob Van Platten, William Jacobs; Guillaume Henry de Villangen, William Henry;</hi> and many more of this kind, as we find the <hi>French</hi> Refugees of the laſt Age are do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at this very time; <hi>Jean de Morlaix</hi> is now <hi>John Morley;</hi> and but the other Day, <hi>Jaques de Guilote</hi> call'd himſelf <hi>James Gill,</hi> and the like is done every Day, ſo that the Families are no more known to be foreign. But this is a Digreſſion.</p>
            <p>We find very little upon Record, relating to the Wool be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carried into <hi>Flanders</hi> after this; or of the <hi>Flemings</hi> making broad Cloth and Stuffs, nor indeed are our Laws much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned about thoſe Affairs, except that King <hi>Henry</hi> VII. to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the End of his Reign, had ſome Laws made to regulate the Lengths and Breadths of the Cloths made here, in order to bring the Clothiers into a Regularity of working, and that the ſeveral ſorts of Goods ſhould be all alike, equal to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and as near as poſſible of an equal Goodneſs and Value; ſo to eſtabliſh the Price of every kind at Market, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Frauds.</p>
            <p>Hence came the fixing of Marks and Seals to the Cloths; at firſt, every Maker ſtriving to add a Reputation to his own Manufacture, and pretending it to be ſuperiour in its Fineneſs or Goodneſs, to his Neighbours, ſet his Mark at the End, wrought into the Cloth, in ſome different Colour, or (as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſome time was practis'd) Leaden Seals, with the Maker's
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1213901500:23"/>
Name, and the Weight of the Cloth ſtamp'd upon them; and hence after ſome time the ſeveral Towns and Corporations, denominating the Manufacture from the Place, obtained Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges and Immunities, Powers and Authority to regulate the Length, and Breadth, and Goodneſs of the ſeveral Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures made in thoſe Towns reſpectively, ſtamping the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Seals with the Town Marks or Arms, as at <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> at <hi>Norwich,</hi> at <hi>Leeds,</hi> and ſeveral other Places.</p>
            <p>It is true that in this Interval between ſtopping the Wool from being exported, and bringing the Manufacture at home to a Perfection, two Inconveniences happened.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The King's Revenue was greatly impaired, and even the Parliament were put to Difficulties for <hi>Ways</hi> and <hi>Means</hi> upon extraordinary Occaſions to raiſe Money for the King's Buſineſs; for the uſual Fund for raiſing Money, when the ordinary Subſidies, Tenths and Fifteenths were not ſufficient, was by granting the King twenty Shillings or forty Shillings, as the Publick Occaſion called for it, upon each Pack of Wool; whereas now the Wool being detained at home, the Clothiers paying no Duty upon that which they bought at home, nor any Tax upon the Cloths when made, the Revenue to the Crown was ſtopt at once; and this perhaps might be the reaſon, that notwithſtanding the Prohibition in <hi>Henry</hi> VII's time, which perhaps was temporary and ſo might be expir'd, we find the Wool was exported again to <hi>Flanders</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII; and in the Fourth of King <hi>Edward</hi> VI, we find mention made of a <hi>Wool Fleet</hi> of ſixty Sail bound to <hi>Antwerp,</hi> which I take to be partly alſo occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by this next Article, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Clothing being yet young in <hi>England,</hi> tho' greatly improved (conſidering the time it had been ſet up in) the Manufacturers were not able to work up the whole Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Wool which grew in <hi>England,</hi> and ſo the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was obliged either to allow or wink at its being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried abroad, as it certainly was all the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII, and of <hi>Edward</hi> VI alſo, tho' in the ſaid fourth Year of <hi>Ed.</hi> VI they conſulted much upon erecting a Mart for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cloth and Block Tin to be eſtabliſh'd at <hi>Southampton;</hi> ſo that none of thoſe Goods ſhould be ſold at any other Place, for the South-Weſt Parts of <hi>England,</hi> and at <hi>Hull</hi> for the North Parts; this laſt to accommodate the Merchants of the Eaſt-Seas called the <hi>Hans,</hi> and alſo for the Eaſe and Advantage of the Northern Clothiers in <hi>England;</hi> for that it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved even then, that the Clothing Trade flouriſhed in thoſe early Times in the Weſt-Riding of <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> viz. at <hi>Wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, Halifax, Leeds,</hi> &amp;c. more than in any other Part of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:1213901500:24"/>
However, as I have ſaid, that the Clothiers were not yet able to work up all the Growth of the Wool in <hi>England;</hi> ſo there ſeemed to be a Neceſſity to let ſome Part of it be ſent abroad; yet it was reſolved in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Council, it ſeems, to ſtop the Fleet which was juſt then going for <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and to have the Wool kept at home, to encourage the Mart intended to be erected at <hi>Southampton:</hi> But the Fleet was ſailed out of <hi>Dover</hi> Harbour, and out of the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> before the Order of Council was paſſed, and could reach them; and ſo the Wool went away; and the King's Death following ſoon after, thoſe Reſolves came to Nothing for that time.</p>
            <p>In the next Reign, <hi>Philip</hi> II, King of <hi>Spain,</hi> marrying Queen <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> it was not to be expected that a Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo much to the Prejudice of the Trade of the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi> which were King <hi>Philip</hi>'s proper Dominion, ſhould paſs in <hi>England;</hi> ſo that we have Reaſon to believe the Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of ſending Wool over the Seas, was at leaſt ſuſpended for that Reign; and what happen'd in the next, we ſhall have frequent Occaſion to mention as we go on.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee the Infant State of the Woollen Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture; from what rational Meaſures it received its firſt Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement in <hi>England,</hi> and how gradually it came on; for we muſt alſo obſerve, that as it was a thing of vaſt Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, as well as of the utmoſt Importance to this Nation, ſo it was not eaſily, much leſs ſuddenly, brought to Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the Stream or Channel of ſo great a Commerce was not ſoon changed, tho' our People came into it with Chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and made wonderful Progreſs for the time; yet <hi>This Rome</hi> was not built in a Day, it was many Years, nay Ages, before it came to Perfection.</p>
            <p>The firſt Beginnings of it I take to have been in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> IV, that is to ſay, of its being attempted by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Hands: The firſt publick Countenance it receiv'd, was at neareſt about the Year 1480, in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> VII, and it was from thence to the Year 1560 <hi>(viz.)</hi> under Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> before it came to its Perfection; ſo that it was above an hundred and twenty Years, as we may call it, in its State of <hi>Nonage,</hi> tho' all the while encreaſing and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and in a promiſing View of a proſperous Magnitude, the ſame which we have ſince ſeen it arrive to.</p>
            <p>It had indeed a moſt glorious Patron (or Patroneſs) and Protector in Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> who not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted and encouraged it at home, but alſo extended the Trade for the Conſumption of it abroad; for in her Time, the ſeveral Branches of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commerce were extended into almoſt all Parts of the known World; the <hi>Turkey</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:1213901500:25"/>
Trade, and the <hi>Muſcovy</hi> Trade eſtabliſhed; the Colonies in <hi>America</hi> diſcovered and planted, by all which the Woollen Manufacture obtained a Vent in foreign Markets, and thoſe great Branches of its Conſumption, which have ſince been ſo large, and are ſtill the moſt conſiderable, were firſt eſtabliſhed in her time, particularly (I ſay) that of <hi>Turkey</hi> and <hi>Muſcovy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But nothing contributed ſo effectually to the Proſperity of the Woollen Manufacture in this Nation, and which may be ſaid (under the wiſe Conduct of that glorious Queen) to compleat the whole Fabrick, giving the mortal Stroke to, unhinging the whole Trade in, and ſhutting it for ever out from, the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> as the long and bloody War between the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and his Subjects in thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, on account of the Liberties and Religion of the People.</p>
            <p>By this, the People were diſtracted and ſeparated, the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility murthered, the Towns ruin'd, the Country plunder'd, the United Provinces (now call'd the <hi>States-General</hi>) entirely broken off from the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Government; thouſands of the People fled over to <hi>England,</hi> where they were kindly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, hoſpitably relieved, courteouſly entertained, and (which was above all the reſt) encouraged to ſet up their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures in the Towns and Corporations, wherever they pleas'd; and this encreas'd and compleated the manufacturing Trade in <hi>England.</hi> And thus we have brought it within View (at leaſt) of its preſent State.</p>

            <p>IT was not to be reckon'd a ſmall Part of the Encreaſe of the Woollen Manufacture in <hi>England</hi> (conſidering its Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal was from Abroad) that it was made capable of ſupplying the Demands of the Home Trade, and was conſiderable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to cloath its own People: Nor was it under above an hundred Years Improvement from its beginning, that this could be attained to, as is Noted above.</p>
            <p>The Manufacturers abroad not only out-work'd us, but under-work'd us; they made their Goods both better and cheaper; the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had great Advantages, but no Experience, ſo
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1213901500:26"/>
that ſtill ſome of the nicer and better Manufactures were made in <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> nor was there any avoiding it at firſt.</p>
            <p>But when the <hi>Flemings</hi> (perſecuted and terrified by the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty and Perſecution of the Duke <hi>D'Alva</hi>) fled over hither, and Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> gave them Protection and Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> then became abſolute Maſters of the Manufactures, and from thence we may Date the Perfection of their Skill; then all foreign Importation might be ſaid to ceaſe, and the carrying abroad of the Wool was made Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal.</p>
            <p>But let us ſee how its Conſumption went on.</p>
            <p n="1">1. At Home; the whole Country was cloathed, Poor and Rich; nothing ſo fine, but it was to be had in <hi>Glouceſterſhire</hi> and <hi>Wiltſhire, Worceſterſhire</hi> and <hi>Barkſhire: Jack</hi> of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> was a Clothier ſuperior to any that are to be found among us at this Time, by many Thouſands, as Money went then; and Mr. <hi>Kenrick</hi>'s Will, of St. <hi>Chriſtopher</hi>'s (who was ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally a Clothier, and then a Cloth Merchant, dealing to <hi>Dort</hi>) teſtifies how conſiderable the Trade was by that Time, (<hi>viz.</hi> King <hi>James</hi> 1.) when he left above <hi>40000l.</hi> in Gifts and Charities, beſides the Bulk of his Eſtate.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But let us alſo take a View of its Encreaſe Abroad, from Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Time, beſides its being able fully to ſupply all the People at Home.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Queen eſtabliſhed a flouriſhing Company, called the <hi>Levant</hi> Merchants (the ſame we now call the <hi>Turkey</hi> Company) by which ſhe extended the Trade of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for their fine Broad Cloths, into the ſeveral Courts of <hi>Perſia, Turkey,</hi> and <hi>Egypt;</hi> for either the Queen, or the <hi>Turkey</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany (I am not ſure which) making ſome Preſents to the Grand Seignior of fine <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cloth, of ſuch exquiſite Workmanſhip for the Fineneſs of the Cloth, and of ſuch beautiful Colours, being dyed Scarlet and Crimſon, the ſaid Grand Seignior, and the Grand Vizier, cauſed fine Robes or Gowns to be made of the ſaid Cloths; and alſo fine Veſts, after their manner, which being ſurred with Sables and rich Furrs, preſented them much about the ſame time from the Great Duke (ſo the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Emperor was then call'd) of <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy,</hi> made a moſt magnificent Appearance; the Grand Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior and his Courtiers were ſo pleaſed with them, that they ſoon became the Mode or Wear of all the great Officers, and of the Grand Seignior himſelf, and ſo again of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziers or Viceroys of their remoteſt Provinces, and the ſame at the Court of <hi>Perſia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:1213901500:27"/>
Thus in a few Years, the fine <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cloth became the Robes of Majeſty, and (as it were) the Badge of Greatneſs and Glory, at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and at <hi>Iſpahan,</hi> at <hi>Alexandria</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and at <hi>Aleppo</hi> in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and every where elſe among the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> where they had Money ſufficient to purchaſe them; and thus it continues to this Day, which is ſtill more ſtrange than all the reſt</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſame <hi>Levant</hi> Company included the Trade to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria</hi> in the Mouth of the great River <hi>Nile,</hi> by which all the Country of <hi>Egypt</hi> was ſupplyed; and not only the great Court of the V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

The ſame <hi>Levant</hi> Company extended the Trade for <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Cloth to the City of <hi>Venice,</hi> at the bottom of the <hi>Adria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> Gulph, where they drove a very great and advantagious Trade; for I ſuppoſe that the Trade of <hi>Smyrna</hi> and <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deroon,</hi> and the Caravans by <hi>Aleppo</hi> to <hi>Perſia,</hi> were not at that time found out by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but were carried on (if at all) by the Merchants of <hi>Venice;</hi> who at that time engroſs'd indeed all the Commerce of the Eaſt, imported the Spices and all the rich Goods of the <hi>Indies,</hi> by the Gulph of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and by the Caravans of <hi>Baſſora</hi> and <hi>Bagdat</hi> to <hi>Aleppo,</hi> and ſent back by the ſame Conveyance ſuch <hi>European</hi> Goods as thoſe Countries demanded; among which, the fine Broad Cloths of <hi>England,</hi> ſoon after that time, began to be the moſt acceptable, and were indeed of the greateſt Value of any thing of that kind in the World.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Likewiſe in this Queen's Reign, the Paſſage to <hi>Arch-Angel,</hi> or the <hi>White Sea,</hi> being diſcovered, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants found Means to carry on a Trade from that Port, by Water-Carriage, to the great City of <hi>Muſcow,</hi> a little way excepted, where their Goods were carried by Land about ſixty Miles only.</p>
            <p>Here they alſo found a Market for their rich Cloths, in the great Duke's Court; and upon this a new Society for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce was erected, and were call'd the <hi>Muſcovy</hi> Company; who brought back a very gainful Return in Sables, Ermins, and other rich Furrs, the Produce of the wild and barren Deſarts of <hi>Siberia</hi> and the North.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:1213901500:28"/>
N.B. <hi>Theſe</hi> Muſcovy <hi>Merchants found the Way, ſome time after this, to paſs by the great River</hi> Wolga, <hi>to</hi> Aſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, <hi>and thence into the</hi> Caſpian Sea, <hi>an Inland Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> (<hi>reckoning from</hi> Jerowſlaw, <hi>where they firſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked their Goods</hi>) <hi>of very near</hi> 2000 <hi>Miles on one Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> viz. <hi>the</hi> Wolga; <hi>hence</hi> (<hi>unwearted in their Search after new Worlds of</hi> Trade) <hi>they paſs'd the</hi> Caſpian, <hi>landed in</hi> Gerogia, <hi>paſs'd over the Mountains of</hi> Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, <hi>and reach'd into the Heart of the Kingdom of</hi> Perſia, <hi>where they found an extraordinary Reception, ſold their fine Cloths at an extravagant Price, ſuch as was even ſurprizing to themſelves; and brought back Bales of raw Silk to a very great Advantage alſo; ſo that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the extraordinary Charges of ſo exceeding long a Travel, they made a very profitable Voyage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe two new Trades gave a very great Encouragement to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants, and particularly to the Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cloth, which now obtain'd ſuch a Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion over the whole Trading World, that nothing was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually valuable in any, or perhaps in all the Courts of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. In the latter End of this Queen's Reign, the ſame Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures were demanded in an exceeding manner in the Northern Parts of the Empire, and the Countries bordering on the <hi>Baltick;</hi> and this Trade naturally fell into the Hands of the <hi>Hans,</hi> that is to ſay, the Society of Merchants who call'd themſelves the <hi>Hans,</hi> a Word ſignifying a <hi>Brotherhood,</hi> or an <hi>United Company;</hi> and becauſe there were ſo many (for there was once no leſs than Seventy two Cities of them) they were called the <hi>Hans</hi> Towns; theſe carried on the Trade of the North, as the <hi>Venetians</hi> did that of the South and Eaſt, mentioned above.</p>
            <p>By theſe Towns, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manufacture was indeed wonderfully extended, that is to ſay, into all the Countries in the <hi>Baltick,</hi> the Kingdoms of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Norway,</hi> the Coaſts of <hi>Mecklemberg,</hi> both the <hi>Pomerens, Pruſſia, Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Livonia, Eaſthonia,</hi> &amp;c. and up the great Rivers of thoſe Countries, into the very Heart of the Empire, and of all the Northern Countries; for Example,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By the City of <hi>Bremen,</hi> one of the chief of the <hi>Hans</hi> Towns, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manufacture paſſed up the <hi>Weſer,</hi> into all the Circle of <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> into the Countries of <hi>Lunen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg, Heſſia,</hi> and ſome part of the <hi>Lower Saxony.</hi>

2. By the City of <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> another of the <hi>Hans</hi> Towns, they had the like Paſſage into the Heart of the Dominions of the Empire, and even to the Hereditary Countries of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria;</hi> for the <hi>Elb</hi> carries its Navigation, by it ſelf, and other Navigable Rivers, into and thro' the Electorates of <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ony</hi> and <hi>Brandeburgh,</hi> up to the great City of <hi>Prague,</hi> the Capital of <hi>Bohemia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. By the City of <hi>Lubeck,</hi> the Capital and firſt of the <hi>Hans</hi> Towns, to all the Kingdom of <hi>Sweden;</hi> that City having at that time the Poſſeſſion and Government of all <hi>Schonen,</hi> and the whole Commerce of the Kingdom of <hi>Sweden;</hi> (whoſe Power in Shipping was at that time very low) and the <hi>Hans</hi> were Maſters of the Sea in all that Part of the World.</p>
            <p n="4">4. By the City of <hi>Stetin,</hi> another <hi>Hans</hi> Town, ſituate on the great River <hi>Oder,</hi> and by which the <hi>Stetiners</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on the like Trade into <hi>Sileſia, Luſatia, Auſtria,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Poland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. By the City of <hi>Dantzick,</hi> another <hi>Hans,</hi> and by the Trade of that City upon the great River <hi>Viſtula,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manufactures were ſpread into the Heart of <hi>Poland,</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Frontiers of <hi>Hungaria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. By all the Sea-Ports of <hi>Koningsburg, Riga, Revel,</hi> and <hi>Narva,</hi> and the ſeveral Rivers call'd the <hi>Duina,</hi> the <hi>Nic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> the <hi>Pregel</hi> and the <hi>Narve;</hi> by all which, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants found an exceeding Vent for the Conſumption of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cloths, eſpecially the Northern Cloathing of <hi>Leeds, Wakefield,</hi> and <hi>Halifax,</hi> call'd in general <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> Cloth; which being not ſo fine, or dyed in ſuch coſtly Colours as that which was ſold into <hi>Perſia, Muſcovy</hi> and the <hi>Levant,</hi> yet ſuiting beſt with thoſe Northern Climates, the Merchants found the Quantities which ſold there exceeding great, and the Price ſold for very encouraging.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> alſo, tho' the laſt was generally em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broil'd with <hi>England</hi> almoſt all that Reign, were yet (during the riſing Proſperity of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manufacture) glad to come into the Trade of it, and eſpecially the Former took off great Quantities every Year; for <hi>France</hi> had not yet ſet their Hands to work to imitate (much leſs to rival) the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in this particular Piece of Improvement. As for the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the Peace or Truce between <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>States-General,</hi> which was firſt ſettled for twelve Years only, by which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were obliged to acknowledge the <hi>Dutch,</hi> or <hi>United Provinces,</hi> to be a Free State; as it brought on with it a Peace, or a good Correſpondence (at leaſt) between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> ſo it wonderfully encreas'd the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Commerce,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1213901500:30"/>
and eſpecially the Conſumption of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manufactures in all the Provinces of <hi>Europe,</hi> where they had been obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted (if not prohibited) before.</p>
            <p>Particularly the <hi>Dutch,</hi> by the Navigation of the <hi>Rhine</hi> and the <hi>Maes</hi> (two great Rivers, and one of them, without Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, the greateſt River for Trade and Inland Navigation in <hi>Europe</hi>) carried thoſe Goods up into the middle of the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Countries of the Empire; for now the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woollen Cloth was become the general Favourite of <hi>Europe,</hi> and the Manufactures of <hi>England</hi> were the chief Article at the great Fairs of <hi>Ausburg, Nuremberg, Franckſort,</hi> and <hi>Leipſick,</hi> the greateſt Marts of <hi>Europe</hi> at that time, if not in the World; and which continue in a flouriſhing Condition to this Day, tho' ſenſibly declining in that particular Article which was their firſt Riſe and Foundation; I mean that of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woollen Manufacture, as I ſhall ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>w in its Place.</p>
            <p>By this means the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manufacture, which the <hi>Dutch</hi> at that time gladly promoted, extended it ſelf not only into the ſeveral Countries adjoining to thoſe Rivers, but into other Countries, by the additional Help of other Navigable Rivers running into them, or running thro' other Provinces not far from them; ſuch as</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Moſelle,</hi> falling into the <hi>Rhine</hi> at <hi>Coblents,</hi> and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king into it the <hi>Saar,</hi> by which the Trade was ſupplyed into <hi>Lorrain,</hi> the Country of <hi>Tryer,</hi> the North-Eaſt Parts of <hi>France,</hi> the three Biſhopricks of <hi>Metz, Toul,</hi> and <hi>Verdun,</hi> and into all that rich and fruitful Country between the <hi>Saar</hi> and the <hi>Rhine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Main,</hi> a River Navigable almoſt 200 Miles, into the Circle of <hi>Franconia,</hi> and to the Countries of <hi>Wurtzburgh, Bamberg, Baden,</hi> and many other of the moſt populous Parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> paſſing then by <hi>Francfort au Main,</hi> and falling into the <hi>Rhine</hi> at <hi>Mentz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Neckar,</hi> a Navigable River alſo, running thro' the fruitful rich Country of the Count <hi>Palatine</hi> of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and paſſing by the Cities of <hi>Heidleberg, Hailbron,</hi> and the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the Black Foreſt, and within a few Miles of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Ulm</hi> upon the <hi>Danube,</hi> where that great River begins to be Navigable, and by which the ſaid Trade had a Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with all the great Cities and Rivers of <hi>Suabia</hi> and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia,</hi> and even down to <hi>Paſſau, Lintz</hi> and <hi>Vienna.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>Aar,</hi> a large River of <hi>Swiſſerland,</hi> alſo Navigable, which riſing out of the ſame Mountains of the <hi>Griſons,</hi> from whence the <hi>Rhine</hi> it ſelf proceeded, paſſes thro' the City of <hi>Bern,</hi> near that of <hi>Zurick,</hi> and other conſiderable Parts of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1213901500:31"/>
the <hi>Swiſs</hi> Cantons, and falling into the <hi>Rbine</hi> a little above <hi>Baſle,</hi> carryed the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woollen Manufacture into the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons of <hi>Swiſſerland;</hi> as it does now ſerve, to our great Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, to bring the like Manufactures now made in <hi>Swiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerland,</hi> down into <hi>Germany,</hi> and to the great Fairs of <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remberg</hi> and <hi>Franckſort,</hi> where they Underſell and Supplant us, as ſhall be ſeen in its Place.</p>
            <p>In this flouriſhing Condition Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> left the Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Manufacture of <hi>England;</hi> being at that time not the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Manufacture in <hi>Europe</hi> only (for ſo it may be called ſtill, tho' ſinking and declining a-pace) but the moſt encreaſing, thriving, and riſing Trade (at that time) in the World.</p>
            <p>As the Woollen Manufacture had thus been about an hundred and fifty Years in its growing and encreaſing Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, like a young Oak in the Woods; ſo now being grown Major, or as we ſay <hi>of Age,</hi> and out of its <hi>Nonage,</hi> we may allow it to have continued above another Century in its flouriſhing and proſperous State; that is to ſay, it held its own, and continued in its full Glory, extended to an infinite Length and Breadth, triumphing over the whole World of Commerce, not rival'd, not imitated, I will not ſay, not envyed, but really not rival'd by any People or in any Country in the World; no, not ſo much as pretended to be rival'd any where: And this laſt hundred Years which I reckon to be the State of its full Glory and Perfection, I take to be from the Middle of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, to the End of the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. that is to ſay, near the End of it, <hi>viz.</hi> from the Year 1580, twenty Years before Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> died, to the Year 1680, being the latter End of the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> II.</p>
            <p>During this time, the Manufactures were ſo far from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving any Blow, any mortal Wound or ſenſible Diſaſter, either from abroad or at home, that the ſeveral Circumſtances relating to the Vent and Conſumption of them concurred to enlarge them and render their Condition yet more flouriſhing and proſperous, if that could be, than they were before. For Example,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> During that Interval of Time, many flouriſhing and now famous Colonies of <hi>Engliſh</hi> had been ſettled in <hi>America,</hi> and in other remote Parts of the World; the Diſcoveries of the indefatigable Adventurers of that Age; ſuch as Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> the famous Earl of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> Captain <hi>Smith,</hi> and others, too many to name, by whom the Commerce of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> was extended in a prodigious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and their Dominions alſo; as in the following Countries in particular:

            <p>In all theſe, the ſucceeding Generations have ſo improved, the Plantations have been ſo ſpread, ſo well managed, and the Numbers of People are ſo ſurpriſingly encreaſed, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in the Beginning of King <hi>James</hi>'s Reign it is creditably affirmed there were not Five thouſand People in all of them, Negroes excepted, and not abundance of Them: 'Tis now as creditably inſiſted upon, that there are not leſs than a Million of <hi>Britiſh</hi> Subjects, Slaves included; which monſtrous En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe is not only an Addition to the Greatneſs and Glory of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Dominion and to their Commerce, by the immenſe Return of their Product to <hi>England,</hi> ſuch as from the Continent in Tobacco, Rice, Pitch, Tar, Turpentine, Train-Oil, Fiſh, Whale-fins, Furs, Drugs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to the other Colonies on the Iſlands in Corn, Meal, Peas, Pork, Beer, Horſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and from the Iſlands to <hi>England,</hi> in Sugar, Rum, Melaſſes, Ginger, Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Indico, Piemento, Cocoa, and many other valuable things. I ſay, this Encreaſe of People is not only an Encreaſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, in the Returns above-named, but it adds to the Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Manufactures in an extraordinary manner; not only all that Million of People being to be cloathed from hence, but that they have in all Places upon the ſaid Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent taught the Natives of the Country to go cloathed alſo; and who are ſupplyed with Manufactures from <hi>England;</hi> all which is a meer Addition to the Trade, as well as to the Navigation of <hi>England,</hi> ſince the time above-named; nothing of thoſe Countries being then known, much leſs any Trade to them.</p>
            <p>It may be objected, and has been pretended, that the firſt Planters or Inhabitants of thoſe Colonies coming from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is no Addition; for that the ſame Encreaſe would have been from them at home, if they had not gone abroad.</p>
            <p>But as this requires a long and full Anſwer, ſuch a full An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer may be given to it hereafter; and particularly this, that thoſe Inhabitants generally going over thither in mean Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and growing rich there by their Induſtry, have quite altered the Caſe; and that the Encreaſe of the ſame People, if it had happened, had probably been an Encreaſe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1213901500:33"/>
both of unprofitable Hands and Mouths; whereas here they have been juſt the contrary, and their Poſterity being rich and induſtrious, have thereby encreaſed the publick Wealth as well as the Numbers of People: But this is not to the preſent Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>It is certain, that ſince Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, not our Colonies only, but the whole Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> is encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in People in a wonderful manner; and that notwithſtanding the prodigious Numbers who we can account for, as deſtroyed out of the ordinary courſe of Nature; ſuch as by War abroad and at home, Plague, Shipwreck, peopling of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and other Caſes, by which ſome Millions may have been deſtroyed, and no doubt have been.</p>
            <p>All this Encreaſe of People has been an Addition to the Conſumption of the Manufactures, and conſequently an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of it; and to ſay, that the Manufacture was encreaſed by its being ſufficient to clothe the Inhabitants in <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's Reign, was to ſay little or nothing, compared to what the Importance of the ſame Article would be now, ſeeing we cannot doubt but that there are at leaſt Four Millions of People in the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> at this time, more than there were at the End of the Year 1500.</p>
            <p>The firſt Foundation of this Encreaſe was, without doubt, ſaid in the fixing the Manufactures at home, which were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſettled in <hi>Flanders,</hi> as I have ſaid; and the next Step was the Perſecution of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> mentioned alſo above.</p>
            <p>The laſt of thoſe Articles, as ſome are of Opinion, brought over at leaſt one hundred thouſand <hi>Flemings</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> where Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> far from being ignorant of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit that Numbers of People would be to her Dominions, where ſhe knew well there was Buſineſs enough to employ them gave them all imaginable Encouragement, appointed them Churches, admitted them to ſet up in Corporations, exempted them from Taxes, and the like; and we ſee their Poſterity here to this Day, diſtinguiſhed by Name in many of our Manufacturing Towns, as the <hi>Rebows</hi> at <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> the <hi>De Vinks</hi> at <hi>Norwich,</hi> the <hi>Papilons</hi> at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the like.</p>
            <p>I might give Examples of the caſual Encreaſe of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Manufactures both abroad and at home; within the Compaſs of an hundred and twenty Years now paſſed, from the Death of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> as limited above, to this time; all which may ſerve further to prove the then flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Condition of that Trade; ſuch as the ſeveral Factories of

the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in other Parts of the World; and the Encreaſe of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Portugueze</hi> Colonies in <hi>America,</hi> which have ſtill added to the Encreaſe of the Manufactures of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> the Conſumption being ſo very great among thoſe Nations.</p>
            <p>Hitherto then we have ſeen the bright Side of the Subject, and have brought the Manufacture to its Meridian Height: It is only to be obſerved as an Addition to what has been ſaid, that as the Conſumption of the Manufacture encreaſed abroad, ſo the Quantity made encreaſed at home. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures encreaſing, the Manufacturers encreaſed alſo; the Trade ſpread at home in Proportion as it ſpread abroad; and that which was at firſt the Work of a few Counties and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, became now the Employment of whole Provinces or Diviſions of the Country, being a kind of Diſtrict conſiſting of ſeveral Counties or Parts of Counties together.</p>
            <p>Thus the Manufacture, firſt erected at <hi>Norwich,</hi> ſpread in a little after the ſaid time, over the whole Counties of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk:</hi> As the Bay Trade of <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> firſt confined to that Town and the adjacent Country, is now extended thro' the whole County, one of the largeſt and moſt populous in <hi>England.</hi> The Clothing Trade erected firſt at the Towns of <hi>Oakingham, Reading, Newbery,</hi> and <hi>Andover,</hi> in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of <hi>Wiltſhire</hi> and <hi>Berkſhire,</hi> is now ſpread farther into <hi>Wilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> and <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> extending along a vaſt Tract of Ground from the Edge of <hi>Glouceſterſhire</hi> to the ſide of <hi>Dorſetſhire,</hi> for near an hundred Miles, thro' the richeſt and moſt fruitful Vale in all the Weſt Part of <hi>England</hi> called, <hi>the Vale of White-Horſe,</hi> and including the populous Towns of <list>

And this brings us to the preſent State of the Manufacture, as it ſtands aborad juſt now with reſpect to the Sale, and as it ſtands at home with reſpect to the Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, by which it will be eaſily ſeen, whether the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture as a Trade or as a Buſineſs is in a thriving or a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining Condition.</p>

         <div n="3" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. III. Of the Preſent State of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Manufacture, as well abroad as at home; with a juſt Deduction from the Proſpect of it to the Question in hand <hi>(viz.)</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is in a Declining Condition or no.</head>
            <p>WE have ſeen ſomething of the paſt State of the Woollen Manufacture: Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> brought it into a flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Condition, in which it continued with ſeveral large Additions to its Proſperity, and a continual Encreaſe of its Magnitude, and of its Conſumption, to the Time of the late Reſtoration; in which time if it ſunk in one Article, it roſe in another; ſo that we might ſay, it was always flouriſhing, and was rather greater than leſs at the end of the next hundred Years, than at the beginning; that is to ſay, at the Year 1700, than at the Year 1602, when Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> died.</p>
            <p>Certain it is that the Conſumption was infinitely encreas'd, the Trade abroad perfectly good; Experience as well as Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory confirms that even in the Height of the Confuſions of the Civil Wars in <hi>England,</hi> the Trade of the Woollen Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture was flouriſhing and prodigious great. Even during the Time of the Siege of <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> when that Town was, as it was called then, in open Rebellion; the Neceſſity of Trade obliged the Beſiegers to give the Towns-People Leave to bring out their Bays to <hi>Lexden</hi> Heath, and to ſell them to the <hi>London</hi> Merchants, who came thither to buy; and the Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers were allowed to carry back their Money unmoleſted by
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1213901500:36"/>
the Soldiers who beſieged them. The Reaſon was plain; the Demand from abroad made it neceſſary the Merchants ſhould be ſupplyed, and the Trade ought not to be obſtructed.</p>
            <p>Nay ſuch was the Conſumption of the Woollen Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture abroad, that all the Encreaſe of it at home was not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient; but the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> encourag'd by the Merchants, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Plenty of Wool, feel into the Making Part, and in a few Years Peace being reſtor'd in that Kingdom, and the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Inhabitants multiplying, the Woollen Manufacture came (by the Induſtry of People) to be as great there, in Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as it was here.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>France</hi> about this time encreas'd in People, and flouriſhing in Peace under the proſperous Reign of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII, and the exquiſite Adminiſtration of the great <hi>Richlieu,</hi> began to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their Trade; and the Demand they made of our Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture in that Reign, was prodigious great.</p>
            <p>But here we muſt make a full Point, and look a little into the Trade as in a State of full Perfection, and ſtanding for ſome time at a Stay.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Great Britain</hi> grew immenſly Rich in thoſe Ages of Trade, is not to be deny'd, or indeed diſputed; we might give a long Account of the Encreaſe of her Wealth and Riches, her Greatneſs and Glory, and how it was all rais'd by, and the Effect of, her encreas'd Commerce; but it is too long for a Tract of this Nature, it will be ſeen in its Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, and in nothing more than in the prodigions Efforts made by the whole Nation, in the late double War, from the <hi>Revolution</hi> to the Peace of <hi>Utrecht;</hi> in which, let but the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe Sums of Money which were rais'd upon Trade only be taken Account of, and they will give us a fair Sketch of the Improvement it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Nay, let the vaſt Sums rais'd Annually, to this Day, by the Cuſtoms upon Trade, ſpeak ſomething of the Encreaſe of it ſince thoſe Days. I need not enter into the Detail of thoſe Productions, ſuch as the Duties on Wines, Tobacco, Brandies; <hi>Eaſt-India,</hi> and <hi>Italian,</hi> and <hi>Turkey</hi> Importations; the Exciſes on Beer, Ale, Malt, Spirits, Coffee, Tea, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which at this time raiſe ſuch Sums, as no Nation in the World can ſhow the like of, and as this Nation never came up to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>I ſhall cloſe the Abſtract of it with this ſhort Return of the late King <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV, to the Account of the laſt Year's State of the War in <hi>England;</hi> when he ſaw the Eſtabliſhment of the <hi>South-Sea</hi> Company, and the Proviſion made by the Parliament for the old unprovided-for Debts, and for the Service of the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Year, both which amounted to near Eleven Millions <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> a Sum ſo frightful, put into <hi>French</hi> Money, that the King upon ſight of it, ſpread out his Hands, and ſaid, <hi>I ſee</hi> 'tis time <hi>to put an End to the War! I never believ'd that</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland <hi>could have made ſuch Efforts as theſe; let us make Peace upon the beſt Terms we can.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I come in the next Place to the declining Part of our Trade, and to enquire where it began.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="4" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. IV. How and when the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Manufactures began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſome Impreſſion from the Influence of other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: And how they began to ſuffer any Leſſening or Loſs from thoſe Impreſſions.</head>
            <p>THE firſt Impreſſion which the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Commerce felt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Greatneſs of her Trade, and eſpecially upon her Manufacture, was from <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was in the latter end of the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> II, that <hi>England</hi> driving ſuch an encouraging Commerce in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of her Woollen Manufactures, the Gain of it animated the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Merchants not only to Export the like from <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but to encourage the People of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as well the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> as the <hi>Engliſh Iriſh</hi> (ſo they call the Families riſen up there from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Race) to puſh into it, and to ſet up the Working all manner of Woollen Goods made in <hi>England,</hi> after the ſame Manner, and under the ſame Denominations as in <hi>England;</hi> with this Addition, that they ſoon found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves able not only to do it as well as in <hi>England,</hi> the Wool and the Workmanſhip being as it were) the ſame; but that they were able to Make, Finiſh, Export, and conſequently Sell at Market the ſame Goods, as good, and much cheaper, than the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt Diſcovery of this in <hi>England</hi> ſeem'd to be from <hi>France,</hi> and from <hi>Spain,</hi> where our Merchants, to their great Mortification, firſt ſound themſelves under-ſold in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets; Goods of the ſame Fabrick, of the like Weight, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Value and Colour, being afforded much cheaper than from <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was an Affliction in Trade, and a very great Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment to the Merchants; and, in its Turn, to the Factors,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1213901500:38"/>
and to the Manufacturers in the Country; for <hi>Firſt,</hi> Our Goods at the ſeveral Markets in <hi>France</hi> lay unſold; expected Orders were ſtop'd and interrupted; the Merchants in <hi>France</hi> wrote to <hi>Ireland</hi> for the Goods, the Markets were ſupplyed, and our Trade in a word decay'd.</p>
            <p>It was not long ſo here, but we began to find the ſame in <hi>Portugal,</hi> and at <hi>Cadiz</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and at other Markets, as at <hi>Leghorn, Meſſina,</hi> and the principal Ports of <hi>Italy;</hi> and thus it was going on to be, in all other Parts of the World.</p>
            <p>But this was not all; Misfortunes ſeldom come alone; one Evil generally follows in the Neck of another. About this time Monſieur <hi>Colbert,</hi> that great and ſucceſsful Manager of the <hi>French</hi> Commerce, after having (with a moſt happy and wonderful Advantage) put all the Southern Provinces of <hi>France</hi> upon the planting Mulberry Trees, and raiſing of Silk; obliging every Town and Village in the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of <hi>Languedock, Provence, Dauphine,</hi> and the adjacent Countries, to plant a proportion'd Number of Mulberry Trees for the nouriſhing Silk-worms, and by that means to eſtabliſh a Fund for the Silk; he contrived the like, as far as in him lay, for the Wool.</p>
            <p>But finding it impoſſible to form a Production of Wool in <hi>France</hi> (tho' he got over Sheep from <hi>England,</hi> from <hi>Ireland,</hi> and from <hi>Scotland</hi>) and that he could not make the Wools come on or grow there, as they did at home, he then apply'd himſelf to the ſettling Methods for getting Wool from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and eſpecially from <hi>Ireland;</hi> by This he immediately ſet up large Manufactures in <hi>France,</hi> as at <hi>Rouen,</hi> at <hi>Caen,</hi> in <hi>Poictou, Guienne, Niſmes,</hi> and other Places, too many to enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate; with this, and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wool, and ſuch other Supplies as he got from remoter Places, he ſoon advanced in his new Attempt, and made ſeveral ſorts of Woollen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, and this in ſuch Quantities, and ſo well performed, that we ſaw <hi>France,</hi> in a few Years, able to ſupply themſelves with Cloathing of their own Making, tho' not of their own Wool, and even to tranſport the Manufactures they wrought to other Places; where they were ſold in the ſame Markets with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to our great Mortification as well as Loſs.</p>
            <p>Nor was this all; but ſo far the <hi>French</hi> proceeded, that in a few Years they ſet up for Prohibitions, excluded our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes all over <hi>France,</hi> and pretended to ſhut us out from their Markets, ſo that we ſhould not be allow'd to Import our Goods any more into <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:1213901500:39"/>
This was a terrible Blow to <hi>England;</hi> and had we not ſoon after made our ſelves Amends upon <hi>France,</hi> by Prohibiting their whole Commerce with us, particularly their Wines, Brandies, Linnen, and wrought Silks, four Articles in which it was ſaid we took near two Millions <hi>Sterling</hi> from them <hi>per Annum,</hi> more than all the Goods that they took from us amounted to; I ſay, had we not done this, it muſt have ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in'd our whole Stock, by draining away ſuch immenſe Sums in Caſh as muſt have been call'd off for the Ballance.</p>
            <p>Here began the Breach between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> in Point of Commerce; and as it came with a War, it laſted ſo long, that it is not yet return'd, nor is ever likely to be: The Humour of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ran off from the <hi>French</hi> Trade, neither their Wines, or their Brandies, or their wrought Silks, have ever come into Uſe again here, and perhaps would never do ſo again, tho' the Trade were to be open'd; at leaſt, it would not as it did before: Our Taſte is chang'd as to their Wines; our Faſhions and Modes are chang'd as to their Silks; and the whole Vein of their Trade is turn'd (here in <hi>England</hi>) ſo as never to return into the old Channel again, no, tho' the Trade ſhould be laid open, which yet it is not.</p>
            <p>But ſtill this was a Blow to our Manufactures, and leſſen'd the Conſumption of them abroad, and conſequently the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of them at home; the Effect of which was, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſome new Vent of the ſaid Manufactures was found out abroad, there would of neceſſity be a Stop, and ſome Hands muſt be taken off at home; the Quantity muſt abate as the Conſumption abated, or elſe the Markets abroad would be glutted with Goods, and the Makers at home not be able to put them off; theſe muſt leave off making, or be undone; and if they left off Making, the Poor (at leaſt ſo far) would be undone: for all Abatement or Declining of the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture, is a degree of Ruin to the People.</p>
            <p>To remedy this, Prudent Heads found out one immediate Help, tho' it was (in its kind) what we may call a Deſperate Cure, namely, a Cure by Amputation; it was indeed cutting off a Member, a vaſt and important Member of our Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture, <hi>viz. Ireland:</hi> The Caſe was thus:</p>
            <p>It was found that <hi>Ireland</hi> began to encroach, in a very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous manner, on our Manufacture, by running into every Branch of it, making every ſort of Goods there, which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> made at home, and that in ſo great a Quantity, that they not only ſupplyed their own Nation, and ſent over great Quantities hither, but that, <hi>as before,</hi> they fill'd foreign Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets with them, and even under-ſold us abroad.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:1213901500:40"/>
Upon this, and conſidering the Abatement of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption by Prohibitions abroad, two Acts were paſſed in <hi>England,</hi> for the Encouragement of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures.</p>
            <p n="1">1 An Act to take off the Duty of Tonnage and Poun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, paid here upon the Exportation of the Woollen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture, which being about <hi>5 per Cent</hi> upon the Value, was conſiderable, and was done in order to bring down our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures at foreign Markets, ſo as not to be under-ſold by the <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Dutch;</hi> which Act continues in Force, and all our Manufactures are Exported free, to this Day.</p>
            <p n="2">2. An Act to Prohibit the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Woollen Manufactures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Exported to any Parts or Places beyond the Seas. This was indeed a terrible Blow to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Merchants, and to the Manufacturers in that Kingdom; but there was no Remedy: it was apparent, that if the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were ſuffered to go on, they would reduce the Manufacture of <hi>England</hi> to nothing; as well by their Cheapneſs, as by their irregular Working, being bound to no Laws or Rules, to no Lengths or Breadths, or other ſuch Limitations as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are bound by.</p>
            <p>It is not my Buſineſs, not have I Room here, to enter into the Reaſons or Arguments made uſe of on one Side or other, at that time; 'tis enough to my preſent Purpoſe, that ſo it was, and that <hi>England</hi> found her ſelf under a Neceſſity of taking that Step with <hi>Ireland,</hi> however Hard or Severe it might ſeem to be.</p>
            <p>Nor can I enter into an Account of the Linnen Trade, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed on this Occaſion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> with the ſeveral Encouragements given to it in the late King <hi>William</hi>'s Reign, being as a kind of Equivalent to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> for the heavy Article above, and which is ſince that grown up to an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Height there, and by particular Encouragements in <hi>England,</hi> is become much more of an Equivalent than was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at firſt hoped for; but that is not our preſent Enquiry; I return to the Caſe before me.</p>
            <p>This Stop of the Exportation of the Woollen Manufacture in <hi>Ireland,</hi> was a ſenſible Relief to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trade, and for a while the Manufactures flouriſh'd again; and tho' the <hi>French</hi> encroach'd (in a ſurprizing manner) upon us in ſome foreign Markets, yet there were ſome particular Articles which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd our Conſumption too very conſiderably, and theſe ought to be mention'd, becauſe I muſt do Juſtice as I go, and let it be fairly ſeen where our Manufacture found ſome Helps, as well as where it felt its Decay; where it was reliev'd, as well as where it was wounded and hurt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:1213901500:41"/>
Beſides this violent Step for the Relief of the Manufacture, it had had three Additions or Encreaſes in the ordinary way of Commerce, which were exceeding great, and which in their Turn greatly encouraged the People, and ſupported the Thing as a Manufacture or Employment.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Trade to <hi>Portugal,</hi> the Encreaſe of which has been ſo ſurprizing great, and began to be ſo about the beginning of the firſt War, that it was apparent in the Second War the Export of <hi>Britiſh</hi> Manufactures to <hi>Portugal,</hi> from <hi>England,</hi> was greater than the whole Export to <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether was before.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Trade to <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> which by the Conqueſts of the late <hi>Czar</hi> in the <hi>Baltick,</hi> his building the Port of <hi>Petersburgh,</hi> his altering the Habits and Cloaths of all his People, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Encouragements given by him to Trade in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commerce in Particular, opened a new Door to the Conſumption of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Manufacture, where there was none before.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The extraordinary Trade to <hi>Jamaica</hi> By what Ways and Means our Merchants found it practicable to eſtabliſh ſuch a Commerce, it is not my Buſineſs to deſcribe; but this is certain, that during that War our Trade to <hi>Jamaica</hi> was ſuch, that the Number of Ships uſing that Trade was encreaſed to more than four times what they were in a few Years before the War; and that this Trade has continued to this time, or 'till within a very little while <hi>(viz.)</hi> 'till the <hi>Spaniſh Guard de Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta's,</hi> or cruiſing Ships of War, took upon them to keep a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Lock-out than formerly, and interrupt it. Whether this Trade was juſtifiable by the Terms of the Treaties ſubſiſting between <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> or not, is not to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in this Place. I may perhaps grant it was not: But 'tis the Fact, not the Legality of it, that I am now Enquiring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and in that Part I am ſure of being right.</p>
            <p>Theſe three Articles of Commerce may be allowed to make a great Addition to the Conſumption of the Woollen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture of <hi>England,</hi> and by theſe Helps, the Loſs of the <hi>French</hi> Trade was for ſome Years the leſs felt, if perhaps at all.</p>
            <p>And that I may give a full Latitude to this Part of our Diſcourſe, I may add, for the take of the Argument only, that ſeveral other Branches of our Exportation ſeemed to have been encreaſed in the ſame Space <hi>(viz.)</hi> the laſt thirty or forty Years, and that not in a trifling manner, but very conſiderably; particularly to <hi>Legborn,</hi> the Trade of that Port being exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advanced during the various Turns among the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1213901500:42"/>
Powers, and particularly occaſioned by the late Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in <hi>Spain, Naples, Sicily,</hi> and that were in <hi>Piemont</hi> and <hi>Milan,</hi> and other Parts of <hi>Lombardy;</hi> alſo by ſome Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments among the <hi>Italians,</hi> which we are not particularly Judges of: Be it which way it will, 'tis evident the Expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of <hi>Britiſh</hi> Manufactures to <hi>Leghorn</hi> are more than double to what they formerly were.</p>
            <p>I might inſtance like wiſe in the End caſe of our own Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, which is very conſiderable in the laſt thirty or forty Years, as may be proved in many particular Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in their Trade, and eſpecially by the Export of <hi>Britiſh</hi> Manufactures thither, which is the Point I am upon, and which is manifeſtly encreaſed, as well to <hi>New England,</hi> and to <hi>Virginia,</hi> as to <hi>Carolina</hi> in particular, and to other Places.</p>
            <p>But I need not enlarge upon theſe things; for were the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of theſe foreign Conſumptions much greater than it is, and were the Places, where that Encreaſe has been, five times larger than they are, the declining State of the Manufacture would ſtill be made out, from other oppoſite Circumſtances, too evident to be denied, and too ſtrong to be balanced by thoſe Advances.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> the unreaſonable Encreaſe of the Quantity made is to be conſider'd, the growing Condition of the Manufacture it ſelf, in which we may venture to ſay there are ſome Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that not only will not be equall'd by any Addition of Commerce either abroad or at home; but, to ſpeak boldly to it, would not be equall'd, if all the Nations to whom our Manufacture is exported, were to encreaſe the Conſumption of it in proportion to that of <hi>Portugal</hi> or <hi>Legborn,</hi> as above.</p>
            <p>It is evident our Manufacture is encreaſed to a Degree al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt inexplicable, inſomuch that it is in itſelf too great for the Conſumption of all <hi>Europe.</hi> Now it ſeems a little of a Paradox that I ſhould bring the Encreaſe of the Quantity as an Argument to prove the declining of the Manufacture that is encreaſed: But a little Reflection will ſet that Part to rights in your Thoughts, and the Difficulty will immediately vaniſh.</p>
            <p>In ſpeaking of the Manufactures as Declined, we are not ſpeaking of the Quantity made, but of the Quantity ſold; or it you will, we muſt change the Terms, and diſtinguiſh betwixt the Woollen Manufacture as a Work or Fabricature, and as a Trade. There may be as many G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ods made in <hi>England</hi> as ever, but if there are not as many told as ever, the Trade will be allowed to decline; nay, the more there is made, the more
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1213901500:43"/>
the Manufacture is declined if they cannot be ſold, becauſe the Quantity becomes a Grievance to it ſelf.</p>
            <p>If it be apparent that the Quantity made, encreaſes faſter than the Quantity ſold off, or that there is more made than can be ſold, the Manufacture is under evident Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. On the other hand, if there are more made and leſs ſold, that Diſcouragement encreaſes to a Diſtraction; the Manufacture languiſhes, and is in a kind of Dropſy, where the Repletion exceeding the Evacuation, the Body ſwells in Bulk, but declines in Strength, and dies of the worſt kind of Conſumption.</p>
            <p>There is no queſtion but that upon the apparent Encreaſe of the Manufactures in <hi>England,</hi> during thoſe many Years mentioned in particular as above, the great Advantage made by that Trade, and the vaſt Eſtates acquired even by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturers themſelves in their ordinary Buſineſs, encouraged others to fall into it, and even encouraged thoſe that were in it to enlarge their Buſineſs, to launch out as their Stocks encreaſed, farther and farther, into that Trade.</p>
            <p>This Humour continues to this day, and is now become the great Grievance of the Manufacture in general; and will, if not timely prevented, be ruinous to the Trade in the End, as I ſhall make appear in its Place.</p>
            <p>While the Manufacture was in its full Extent abroad, while it was the Miſtreſs of the World in Trade, had no Rivals, and no Attempts were made to mimick it, or imitate it, but that it had an uninterrupted Sale abroad; the Encreaſe of the Quantity at home was far from being a Grievance, either to the Country or to the Trade; and during the happy Years of its thus currently going off, vaſt Additions to the Quantity were made at home, ſuch, as if you will give Credit to ſome People, would in a few Years have glutted the whole World with our Goods, tho' there had been no Check given to the Vent of it abroad.</p>
            <p>I could give a long Hiſtory of the Encreaſe of the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture in <hi>England,</hi> I mean, as a Work or Fabrick; even whole Towns, nay, Parts of Counties, have, within the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of ſome ſtill alive, been employed in it, who were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver employed before.</p>
            <p>I could likewiſe enter into the Detail of the Changes and Turns which the Manufacture itſelf has ſuffered by changing the Kinds, as particularly the changing the Clothing or Cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making into the making narrow and lighter Kinds of Cloth, ſuch as we call Druggets and Ketſies, inſtead of Broad-cloth,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1213901500:44"/>
in the Weſtern Parts of <hi>England,</hi> ſuch as the Counties of <hi>Wilts, Berks,</hi> and <hi>Devon;</hi> and Sagathies and Duroys, a thin and light ſort of Stuff, inſtead of thick Cloth-Serges, at <hi>Taunton</hi> in <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> and other Parts adjoining; by which Exchange of Kinds, it is the Opinion of many Men of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manufacture in general has ſuffered ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely, and a Door opened to the Attempts of Foreigners, who encroached upon us by thoſe Imitutions and Deluſions, but were not able to come up to us in the eſſential Part of the Manufacture <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Clothing Part. The Caſe was thus:</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> were the firſt who, as I have ſaid, ſet up to rival our Manufactures, and having gotten Workmen as well as Materials from <hi>England,</hi> they ſet up a Cloathing Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture as well at <hi>Rouen</hi> and <hi>Caen</hi> and other Places in <hi>Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> as at <hi>Niſmes</hi> and the adjacent Cities in <hi>Languedock</hi> and <hi>Provence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>French</hi> (according to the known ſuperficial Humour of that Nation) contenting themſelves with keeping up to the Standard of Broad Cloth in <hi>Languedoc</hi> only; becauſe they were oblig'd to follow the Pattern of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> there, for the <hi>Turkey</hi> Trade; in other Places made it light, looſe, and ſpongy, thinner in Subſtance, and ſlighter in Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and this not being able to carry the Breadth of the Broad Cloth, they alter'd to the uſual Stuff Breadth of half Ell, or half Yard, as their ordinary Stuffs were made.</p>
            <p>Theſe they call'd Cloths at firſt; but ſeeing they would not keep up the Credit of that Name, as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cloth did; they gave them ſeveral Names from the Towns or Counties where they were made, ſuch as <hi>Drap de Normandy, Drap de Berry, Drap de Lorrain,</hi> and ſo of the reſt.</p>
            <p>Had we let the <hi>French</hi> go on their own way, and kept up at home to the old <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manufacture of Broad Cloth, the <hi>French</hi> to this Day had been diſtanc'd in their new Attempt; but with a Weakneſs, never to be defended, while they with Difficulty followed us, we faced about, and ſimply followed them.</p>
            <p>They brought their Silk Stuffs, and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Druggets, and light thin <hi>French</hi> Serges, into Wear, and into Faſhion; and they were in the right, becauſe they could make no better; We, to Ape them in their Mode, fall into the ſame ſorts of Stuffs, and ſo made that, which was their Neceſſity, be our Miſchief.</p>
            <p>By this Means, not only we wore their ſorry ſlight Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures, and even brought them privately from <hi>France</hi> it ſelf, but (fond of our own Miſchiefs) we quit the Broad
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1213901500:45"/>
Cloth, the ancient Glory of <hi>England</hi> (as to Manufacture) and fall into the making of light Stuffs for Men's Wear, to the Ruin of our own Manufactures, as much as in us lay; for theſe new fooliſh Things neither employ'd an equal Number of Hands, or conſum'd an equal Quantity of the Wool, in both which they accommodated the <hi>French,</hi> who neither had at firſt a Number of skilful Workmen to make them, or a Quantity of Wool to make them with; but in both we weaken'd our own Country, for this at once caus'd the Wool to lye on hand unwrought, and thouſands of Poor to go unemploy'd.</p>
            <p>The great Promoter of this Debauchery in Trade (for ſuch it might be call'd) was one <hi>D'Oyly,</hi> a Warehouſe-Keeper in <hi>London,</hi> who, valuing himſelf upon that for which he ought (according to the Laws of <hi>Perſia</hi>) to have his Name be made infamous, and his Houſe be made a Dunghil, boaſted of his Merit, and call'd his new <hi>French</hi> Mimickry of a Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture, <hi>Doyly</hi>'s <hi>Stuffs;</hi> and ſuch was the Vanity of the Day, that we ſaw the whole Town, nay, we might ſay the whole Nation, run into them, and the ancient Manufacture of Broad Cloth lay by the Walls; the ſubſtantial Woollen-Drapers had nothing to do, no Trade at their Shops; and the new Stuff-Merchant <hi>D'Oyly</hi> had his great Ware-houſe near <hi>Exeter-Exchange</hi> in the <hi>Strand,</hi> throng'd with Buyers from Morning to Night, and the Man got an Eſtate in one Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer's Trade.</p>
            <p>It is true, God, and a hard Winter, ſhould have the Thanks of the poor Manufacturers, while they live; the Severity of the great Froſt (falling in immediately upon it) brought the good warm cloathing Trade into Mode again, and ſet the Poor at work in ſome tolerable Degree, ſo at leaſt as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them for that time.</p>
            <p>But this unhappy Humour reviv'd ſo far, as brought our Manufacturers into the way of making a middle Kind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Cloth and Stuff, ſo as on one Side to ſuit the Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, and yet (as near as might be) on the other, to follow the <hi>French</hi> Folly alſo, and this introduc'd the making Drug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets, Sagathies, Chamlets, Duroys, and the ſeveral kinds of Men's Stuffs, with which we have (as it were) made War with our own Manufacture, and joſtled the Broad Cloth as much as we could out of the World; ſo that in ſhort, if thoſe light things which the <hi>French</hi> made, becauſe they could make no better, did not become the univerſal Mode of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and the better and more important Cloathing, on which the whole Nation depended, go quite out of uſe, it was none of our Fault.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:1213901500:46"/>
The Truth is, tho' the firſt Madneſs wore off, and the <hi>D'Oyly</hi> Stuffs in a little time did ſicken and glut the Town, yet This is certain that the wearing of Drugget and Stuffs, Chamlets and Duroys, and ſuch-like ſlight things, was a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Blow to the antient Clothing Manufacture; to this Day it has not recovered it, and perhaps never will.</p>
            <p>Thus far the Manufacture declined by our Own Folly: It is true indeed that theſe ſlight thin Stuffs, tho' they did not conſume ſo much Wool, or employ ſo many Hands as the Clothing, yet, as they ſent the People oftner to Market, the Quantity made ſeemed to be ſome Amends to the Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, and to the Poor; But then, they opened a Door to the <hi>French</hi> to ſell their ſlight, half-made Goods at foreign Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets; for the Faſhion alſo took Root, whereas (if the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture of Broad-cloth had been kept up) the <hi>French</hi> would never have been able to have hurt us, at home or abroad.</p>
            <p>But this is not all; I ſhall give you a farther Account of the Declining of the Manufacture in its Sale abroad, and of the Reaſons of it in particular, more ruinous than this. But here I muſt take notice too, as I have ſaid above, how the Making encreaſed, whether the Sale encreaſed or no; and this we ſhall give you ſome unanſwerable Evidence of in a few Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Upon this unhappy falling into the <hi>French</hi> Faſhion of wearing Stuffs inſtead of Broad-cloth, I mean for the Mens Wear, a ſtrange and ſudden Metamorphoſis in Trade follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here in <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Spittlefields</hi> had been eminent for many Years for the Silk Manufacture, encouraged and greatly encreaſed by the coming over of the <hi>French</hi> Refugees in 1682 to 1684, and the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of People encreaſing there, the Buildings likewiſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed; ſo that what with Ribband-Weavers and Broad-Weavers, it was generally ſaid there was an hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Weavers in <hi>Spittlefields</hi> and the adjacent Streets.</p>
            <p>But the Trade was not equal to the Numbers of the People, the Streets began to be deſolate, the Houſes empty, and the People ſhifted about to other Places and to other Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as Occaſion ſupply'd them; when all on a ſudden, we were ſurpriſed to find Wool-combers and Staplers ſetting up in <hi>Spittlefields,</hi> and Shops began to open there for Worſted Yarn and for comb'd Wool, and abundance (of the <hi>French</hi> Women eſpecially) went ſpinning about the Streets. This was employed at firſt among the Stocking-Weavers or Frame-work-Knitters, which Manufacture, about that time, took a new Turn all over <hi>England,</hi> from Knitting to Weaving or <hi>Frame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:1213901500:47"/>
to the great Loſs of the Poor in the Countries where thoſe Goods were uſually made, where many thouſands were formerly employed in Knitting, but now were quite ſtruck out of the Work by the Groſs of the Stockings being wrought in the Frame.</p>
            <p>This began the Woollen Trade in <hi>Spittlefields;</hi> but when the <hi>D'Oyly Stuffs</hi> had, as I have ſaid above, ſpread the Town, and the Humour continued for ſome time, <hi>Spittle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields</hi> took another new Turn, and in one Year more we ſaw it as full of Stuff and Worſted as before of Silk, the Silk-Weavers turned their Hands to the narrow Woollen Manufactures, and the Quantity of thoſe Manufactures now made there of almoſt all Kinds, eſpecially ſuch as were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly made at <hi>Norwich</hi> and the Parts adjacent, is ſuch, that in a word, <hi>Spittlefields</hi> is become the principal Seat or Center of thoſe Manufactures in <hi>England;</hi> and yet the City of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> as above, is ſuppoſed to be in as full Employ as ever, or at leaſt as uſual; ſo that this whole Manufacture of <hi>Spittle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields</hi> is an Encreaſe upon the Manufacture in general, and muſt be anſwered for by a proportioned Sale ſomewhere or other, abroad or at home, or elſe ſo far the Encreaſe is too great for the Conſumption, and is not a Benefit but a Loſs to the Manufacture, and adds in the worſt manner to its decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Circumſtances.</p>
            <p>I could give you a like Account of large Manufactures of Druggets and other Goods erected in ſeveral Towns and Places in <hi>England</hi> within theſe few Years, where no ſuch or other Woollen Manufactures worth naming in this caſe were wro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1213901500:48"/>
of the Town of <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> and by that they were ſure to know of what Value the Goods were, and were certain to find them anſwer both in Lengths and Goodneſs.</p>
            <p>But the Neighbouring Towns finding the <hi>Colcheſter</hi> and <hi>Bocking</hi> Bay-makers grow rich, thruſt themſelves into that Trade, and now the Bayes are made at <hi>Coggeſhal,</hi> at <hi>Witham,</hi> at <hi>Kelvedon,</hi> at <hi>Braintre,</hi> at <hi>Halſted,</hi> and in a word, at almoſt all the moſt conſiderable Towns in <hi>Eſſex</hi> beyond <hi>Cbelms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is this all, but even the Bay-makers themſelves, upon the leaſt Start of the Trade, and upon any ſudden quick Demand from abroad, puſh in with ſuch Eagerneſs, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their Quantity to ſuch a Degree, that they bring more to the Market than all the World can take off.</p>
            <p>This has, I may ſay, ruin'd the Trade; and the Conſequence is, that as ſoon as ever that ſmall Run is over, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from abroad ceaſes, the Market is immediately throng'd with Goods, they are pawned and pledged to every monied Man in the Place, 'till they can be put off; the Price ſinks, the Labour of the Poor ſtops, and the Bay-makers are often broke and undone.</p>
            <p>Nor is the Credit or real Value of the Goods ſupported, for the Bay-makers being now extended over the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and working out of the Juriſdiction of the Bay-Hall at <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> they put what Goods they pleaſe upon the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, and what Marks or Seals they pleaſe upon the Goods; ſo that the Credit of the Manufacture is ſunk, and no Man truſts to the Seals of the Goods any more, but takes Care to look into the Goods himſelf, and ſee with his own Eyes that he is not cheated.</p>
            <p>I cannot but eſteem this laſt to be one eminent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of the Declining of that Manufacture; for if once a Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture declines in its Credit, I ſhall always conclude it is declin'd in its Sale, or will ſoon be ſo; <hi>but that by the way.</hi> The preſent Article I am upon, and which I lay the whole Streſs of the Queſtion now upon, is the Encreaſe of the Quantity beyond the Demand; that more are made than are or can be conſumed, which I think is apparent in many other Particulars.</p>
            <p>I ſum the whole Obſervation up in this one Head <hi>(viz.)</hi> that this very Encreaſe is a Grievance, which in the end may be ruinous to the whole Woollen Manufacture of <hi>England,</hi> if ſome new Doors of Commerce are not opened abroad to raiſe a Conſumption equal to that Encreaſe, or ſome Method

be not taken to put a Stop to the farther Encreaſe of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick at home, ſo as not to make the Manufacture be too great for the Sale, whether it be at home or abroad.</p>

            <p>BUT 'tis needful now to enquire into the State of our Manufacture abroad, as to the Conſumption of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Species in thoſe Countries where our Trade uſed to be ſettled: If we find the Sale or Demand encreaſing abroad, the encreaſing of the Quantity at home would certainly be ſo far from a Grievance, that it would be the Glory and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of our Commerce and of our Country; and if every County in <hi>England</hi> were as fully employed in manufacturing, as <hi>Wiltſhire, Devonſhire, Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Eſſex,</hi> every City as <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi> and <hi>Exeter,</hi> and every Market Town, as <hi>Froom, Taun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Leeds,</hi> or <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> it would be the Wealth of the whole, and the greateſt Felicity that this World ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a Nation.</p>
            <p>But the Caſe is not ſo, but far otherwiſe; inſtead of the Conſumption encreaſing abroad, inſtead of a larger Demand, we ſee all Parts of the World envying us, moſt Parts endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to imitate us, and as many as can encouraging their own upſtart Manufactures in the room of the <hi>Britiſh;</hi> and too many totally prohibiting the Sale or the wearing our Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, that their own, however mean and ordinary, may take Place.</p>
            <p>And not to dwell upon ſome late Prohibitions of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Woollen Goods in <hi>Spain</hi> and in the Iſland of <hi>Sicily,</hi> at <hi>Lintz, Paſſau, Vienna,</hi> and other Places in the Emperor's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, done rather by way of Inſult to our Nation at this Criſis of their Affairs, than that they are able to carry on any E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent Manufactures of their own; I ſay, not to lay any Streſs upon theſe, yet it muſt be ſaid, that other Places have of late Years attempted our Manufacture, and ſome but with too much Succeſs, and Prohibitions rather natural and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quential, than political, encreaſe upon us every Day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:1213901500:50"/>
It is the general Opinion (and I have joyn'd with it in Part, in the beginning of this Diſcourſe) that there is no Wool to be found in any Part of the World, or at leaſt not in <hi>Europe,</hi> capable of working into ſuch Manufactures, and of making ſuch ſeveral Sorts of Goods, as we at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent furniſh the World with; and upon this very Principle we carry our Boaſts of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Manufacture ſo high: Now in ſome particular Things we are right; I mean, right in our Judgment, namely, that the World has not the Wool, that is, has not any Wool capable of working into ſuch Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures as we make; tho' as to Boaſting, as we do, I ſhall never come into that Part, becauſe boaſting of our Superiority is but firing the reſt of the World with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearyed Application to ſupply the Defect.</p>
            <p>But let us diſtinguiſh here with a little more Temper than we uſually do; There is a manifeſt Difference between having no Wool fit for any Manufacture at all, and not having the beſt and the fineſt Wool, of the longeſt Staple, the firmeſt Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the fineſt and ſofteſt Quality: There is a manifeſt Difference between the Wool being good for nothing, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not ſo good as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Iriſh</hi> Wool. To deſcend to Particulars;</p>
            <p>It is true, <hi>Europe,</hi> take it BY and LARGE (as we expreſs it) from End to End, does not produce a Wool capable of making our fine Broad Cloths of <hi>Warminſter, Trowbridge, Bradford,</hi> and <hi>Froom;</hi> or our fine <hi>Glouceſter</hi> and <hi>Worceſter</hi> Whites; no nor perhaps ſuch as our <hi>Wakefield</hi> and <hi>Leeds</hi> Cloth, tho' what we call coarſe, yet of Subſtance and Weight inimitable; nor of many ſeveral Manufactures of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kinds, ſuch as <hi>Devonſhire</hi> Kerſies, <hi>Exeter</hi> and <hi>Taunton</hi> Serges, <hi>Devizes</hi> and <hi>Briſtol</hi> Druggets, <hi>Andover</hi> and <hi>Newberry</hi> Shaloons, and the like.</p>
            <p>But to ſay therefore, that there are no other of our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures that can be made abroad, and that even where they have no <hi>Engliſh</hi> Wool, that I cannot and muſt not grant, becauſe Experience teaches us the contrary every Day, to our great Diſadvantage in Trade.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saxony,</hi> a large and fertile Country in <hi>Germany,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Severity of the Winters, which are ſometimes ſuch as gives a Check to the Production of Wool, yet not only has a very good kind of Wool, but a very large Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of it; and the <hi>Saxons,</hi> an induſtrious People, are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy advanc'd ſo far in the Manufacturing the Wool, that they make two particular Manufactures which are very
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:1213901500:51"/>
uſeful in thoſe cold Countries, and which they formerly bought from <hi>England,</hi> either brought thither to their Fair at <hi>Leipſick,</hi> by way <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

            <p>Every one knows, that as theſe Goods are ſoft and warm, and are ſuited very particularly for preſerving the Bodies of thoſe who wear them in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe Northern Parts of the World from the Severity of the Cold, ſo they are not made of the coarſeſt and harſheſt of the Wool; on the contrary, they are made thick and downy, well mill'd, and the Nap raiſed, which would not be, if the Wool was not fine and ſoft, and the Workmanſhip cloſe and thick.</p>
            <p>Yet theſe they now make in <hi>Saxony,</hi> not only in ſufficient Quantities to ſupply themſelves, and their own Markets, but we ſee the Flannels and Bayes of <hi>Saxony</hi> ſold every Year at <hi>Frankfort,</hi> at <hi>Nurembergh,</hi> and moſt of the other Fairs of Note in the Upper <hi>Germany;</hi> and what is the Conſequence of this? Not any Prohibition of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bays and Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels; no; we may ſend ours thither alſo, and may ſell them there too, if we can; but Nature forbids it, the Thing is a Prohibition of it ſelf; ours are not ſold there, becauſe their own are ſufficient, and we need not ſay, are cheaper, for it would be very hard, if they can be made at all, that they ſhould not be made cheaper than the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which paſs thro' ſo many Hands, ſo many Countries, pay ſo many Embarkations, Aſſurances, Commiſſions, and other Charges, and are carried ſo far, as well by Land as Water-Carriage.</p>
            <p>It is true, the Wool of <hi>Saxony</hi> is of a brown, or a kind of Ruſſet Colour, occaſion'd by the Climate, or the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Breed of the Sheep, or from whatſoever other Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in Nature we cannot account for; but as the Bayes are generally Dyed, and many of the Flannels alſo, it is not diſtinguiſh'd, for that the Wool, however Ruſſet, or of a Greyiſh Colour at firſt, and as it grows on the Sheep's Back, yet it is not at all the worſe to take any Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, in the Dying-fat, but (as ſome think) is rather the better.</p>
            <p>I need go no farther for the Proof of this, than to appeal to thoſe Merchants, who trading to thoſe Countries, uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had Commiſſions from thence to buy great Quantities of thoſe Goods here; and let Them tell us how many
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:1213901500:52"/>
Bayes or Flannels they now have Orders for, for the Fair at <hi>Leipſick,</hi> or the Mart at <hi>Frankfurt;</hi> or rather, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bayes and Flannels are ſent thither, or no.</p>
            <p>But this is not all: Let us look in the next Place into the King of <hi>Pruſſia</hi>'s Dominions, I mean that Part of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try which was formerly call'd the Electorate of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> the Country about <hi>Magdeburgh,</hi> the Country upon the <hi>Havel</hi> and the <hi>Sprhee;</hi> there they have Wool, which, tho' coarſe and harſh, yet the Government of <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to improve the Country to the utmoſt, and to employ their own Poor for their own Work, cauſes all thoſe coarſer Manufactures which their own Wool is capable of making, to be made among themſelves; and tho' theſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures are not equal to the <hi>Britiſh,</hi> yet as they are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to the Demands of their own Poor, and ſerve to cloath the Boors and Peſants, that is to ſay, the Country People and Plow-men, and labouring Poor, they think it reaſonable to Prohibit all foreign Manufactures, which uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally were Imported for thoſe Uſes; ſuch were our <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> Kerſies, double and ſingle <hi>Doſens,</hi> the coarſe Goods made in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Half-Thicks, Penniſtones, Duffiels,</hi> Blanketting, and other Woollen Manufactures made for the Cloathing and Covering of the Poor.</p>
            <p>Theſe were formerly Shipp'd off in great Quantities for <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> and for <hi>Stetin</hi> and <hi>Straelſond,</hi> and other Ports on the South Coaſt of the <hi>Baltick;</hi> but now the General Conſumption of ſuch Goods has been ſtopp'd for ſome Years, the People making all thoſe Things at home.</p>
            <p>It is the like in <hi>Sweden,</hi> where, tho' their Wool is ſtill coarſer, and the Manufactures they make the pooreſt and rougheſt that can be imagined, yet the ſetting their own Poor to work to make their own Cloathing, however mean, ſerves to employ them, keeps their Money at home, and all ſtill ſhortens us in our Exportations of thoſe Goods to that Country.</p>
            <p>It is true our finer Cloths gain ſtill an Admittance into thoſe Countries, becauſe the Wool (even of <hi>Saxony</hi>) is not fine enough for ſuch a Manufacture; and this may ſhew us, that we have certainly been in the Wrong of it, and have weakened the Intereſt of our Manufactures abroad exceedingly, by leaving our Cloathing Trade to ſink upon our Hands, and turn our Workmen to the lighter Manufactures, which other Countries with their coarſe Wool are ſo much eaſier able to ſupply. But to go on;</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:1213901500:53"/>
So many of our Woollen Manufactures being thus exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from <hi>Sweden,</hi> from <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> from <hi>Saxony,</hi> and from ſo many Parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> let us look next towards the South; and here we find the <hi>Swiſs</hi> of <hi>Zurick</hi> making Chamlets, Shalloons, and ſeveral other Sorts of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures, as well for Mens Wearing as Womens, the ſame as are made in <hi>Spittlefields, Norwich, Andover,</hi> and ſeveral other Places in <hi>England;</hi> the <hi>Swiſs</hi> perform theſe Works now with much Accuracy, and it is hard to know them from the like ſorts of Goods made in <hi>England;</hi> the Workmen alſo who ſet them up being fetch'd from <hi>Spittle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields,</hi> where they learned the Art, and how to manage both the Wool, the Yarn, the Loom, the Dreſſing, and in a word, the whole Finiſhing after the <hi>Engliſh</hi> manner, and (without flattering our ſelves) as well perform'd.</p>
            <p>Did the <hi>Zurickers</hi> only ſupply their own City, or their own Canton with theſe Goods, the Loſs to our Manufacture would be no more than the meer Negative upon their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption; but I ſhould not be juſt to the matter in hand, if I did not tell you, that, to the irreparable Loſs of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manufactures, theſe Goods are brought from <hi>Zurick</hi> by the River <hi>Rhine</hi> to the City of <hi>Baſle,</hi> and from thence down the <hi>Rhine</hi> to <hi>Mentz,</hi> and then ſtill by Water up the <hi>Main</hi> to the Mart at <hi>Frankfort au Main,</hi> where they go too far in Supplanting the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Goods of the ſame Denomination; and to ſuch a Degree are they arriv'd, that I am told there are very few <hi>Engliſh</hi> Goods of theſe Sorts now ſold there; the <hi>Zurickers</hi> ſupplying the Fair with them, as good as the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and conſiderably cheaper.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee our Manufacture cut ſhort on every Side, by the Envy or Induſtry of the ſeveral Nations of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> totally Prohibited in <hi>France,</hi> and very much ſupplant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſeveral other Places.</p>
            <p>The Emperor has for ſome time encouraged Manufactures in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> in <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and in all the Hereditary Countries; and the Conſequence of this, 'tis expected, will be a General Prohibition of all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woollen Manufactures. It has been attempted lately by way of Pique and Reſentment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Imperial Court and <hi>Great Britain.</hi> But that Part may be eſteem'd a Jeſt, compar'd with other Countries.</p>
            <p>However it may be well worth conſidering, whether if this general Humour of manufacturing ſhould ſpread far in <hi>Europe,</hi> as we are juſt now told it begins to do in <hi>Poland,</hi> and in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> and is threatned in <hi>Spain,</hi> what the Impreſſion it
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1213901500:54"/>
may make upon our Manufactures in <hi>England,</hi> may be in a few Years.</p>
            <p>As theſe Invaſions are Increaſing, ſo our Manufacture muſt be Declining in proportion, unleſs it could be ſaid that ſome yet farther Branch of Foreign Commerce can be found out for the Conſumption of our Manufacture, which it is time enough to ſpeak of when we ſee it in Proſpect, and which I ſhould be glad to ſay was probable.</p>
            <p>I muſt acknowledge if the preſent War ſhould proceed to Extremities, ſo as to lay open the Trade from <hi>England</hi> to the <hi>Spaniſh Weſt-Indies</hi> directly, I ſhould venture to ſay it would give our Manufactures a new Turn, and they would feel a Spring of Proſperity for ſome time, and that conſiderably too; eſpecially if ſome Bounds were ſet to the Manufacturers at home, elſe (if they launch'd out in Quantity, according to Cuſtom, as is mentioned above) they would glut the Market, tho' they were to have a new <hi>America</hi> opened to them for the Trade once in every five Years.</p>
            <p>However, I ſee no room to argue upon this remote Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect; they that are Sanguine enough upon the War to run on making, and lay up a Stock of Goods in expectation of a Market the next Fair at <hi>Porto-Belo,</hi> or when <hi>La Vera Cruz</hi> ſhall be turn'd <hi>Engliſh,</hi> may go on their own way, I am for ſharing no <hi>Bear Skins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I muſt come nearer home ſtill, and muſt take the Freedom to inſiſt, that our Manufacture is in a State of Decay too from our Conduct at home, much more than from all Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions and Interruptions abroad. I am not diſpos'd to make this Work a Satyr upon my own Country, but certainly we are the firſt, if not the only Nation in the World, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the beſt and moſt profitable Product, and the beſt and moſt agreeable Manufacture of our own, of any Nation in <hi>Europe,</hi> if not in the World, are the moſt backward to our own Improvement.</p>
            <p>A Manufacture valuable in it Self, infinitely profitable to the Poor, unexceptionably pleaſant to the Rich; not too hot for the Summer, not too cold for the Winter; light enough for <hi>July;</hi> warm enough for <hi>December;</hi> beautiful as the fineſt Silks, ſuiting with Laces, Embroidery, and all manner of Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, better than even Silk it ſelf, and yet Ornamental and Rich in its own Luſtre.</p>
            <p>A Manufacture receptive of the brighteſt and deepeſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours; Gay enough for the Bridegroom, Solemn enough for the Widow; Rich enough for a Coronation, Grave enough for the deepeſt Mourning.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:1213901500:55"/>
A Manufacture that has not one Exception to be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, or one Reaſon to be given for diſliking it; except the weakeſt of all Reaſons, the Love of Change and Variety, or that wicked Reaſon which a Man gave why he did not love his beautiful and agreeable Wife, <hi>viz.</hi> only becauſe ſhe was his own.</p>
            <p>A Manufacture that all the World covets, envies us for, ſtrives to imitate, nay, are vain of but thinking they can imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate it.</p>
            <p>A Manufacture which thoſe other Nations (when they have faintly imitated it) are obliged to Prohibit by the ſevereſt Laws, or elſe all their People would run into them, and which they do ſtrive to come at and purchaſe, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtricteſt Prohibitions.</p>
            <p>A Manufacture which is apparently declining for want of a Conſumption equal to its Bulk, and becauſe of the too ſucceſsful Attempts of other People to ſet it up among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and becauſe of the Improvements that the Induſtry of Strangers, and the Indolence of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Manufacturers aſſiſts them in.</p>
            <p>And yet with ſuch a Manufacture as this, we cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade our ſelves to wear our own Produce, to propagate our own Induſtry, or employ our own People; but we are no ſooner Prohibited the Uſe of one foreign Bauble, but we fly to another; firſt we turn'd our Backs upon our own wrought Silks, and run to <hi>India</hi> and <hi>China</hi> for all the ſlighteſt and fooliſheſt Traſh in the World, ſuch as their Chints, ſlight Silks, painted Cottons, <hi>Herba,</hi> Silk and no Silks as if any thing but our own was to be thought beautiful, and any thing but what was beſt for us, was to be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by us.</p>
            <p>When this Extravagance was alſo check'd by a Law, we run then into another Extream, and ſtill turning our Fancy againſt our own Manufactures, on a ſudden we ſaw all our Women, Rich and Poor, cloath'd in Callico, printed and painted; the Gayer and the more Tawdry, the better; and though ordinary, mean, low-priz'd, and ſoon in Rags, the gayeſt Ladies appeared in them on the greateſt Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
            <p>Thus the Ancient Manufactures of <hi>Great Britain</hi> were deſpis'd by our own People, and the Bread taken out of the Mouths of the Poor; the Hands that would have labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed could get no Work; the Trade ſunk; the Manufacturers ſlarved, and the Wool lay by in heaps unwrought, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:1213901500:56"/>
to the general impoveriſhing of the People, and the Ruin of the Manufacture it ſelf.</p>
            <p>We are now by another Law of Prohibition reſtrained from the wearing of painted Callicoes; and what follows? the Temper is not at all reclaim'd, nor do they ſo much as incline to return to the Uſe of their own Manufactures, which is the main and beſt End of the Prohibition: But, as if we were reſolv'd to run down our whole Country, and ruin our Poor with our own Hands, we run to the remoteſt Corners for ſome Shift or other to cheat our ſelves; and now we ſee the general Cloathing (of the meaner Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleſpecially) runs into the meaneſt, tawdrieſt Colours, ſtamp'd upon the moſt ordinary Linnen, fetch'd from <hi>Scotland, Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or indeed any where; as if any thing but our own was to be our Choice, and as if we had forſworn our own Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures, and were aſham'd to be dreſs'd in our own Cloths.</p>
            <p>How ſhall we expect our own Manufactures ſhould grow and encreaſe, while this is the Caſe? and if we will not encourage our own Growth, and the Labour of our own People, how ſhould we expect Foreigners ſhould do it?</p>
            <p>In ſhort, as I ſaid of the Woollen Manufactures of <hi>Saxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> that they are an effectual Prohibition of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſo I may ſay of our People's running into the Wear of printed Linnens, Callicoes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they are a tacit Prohibition of the Manufactures; for what is a Rejecting the Manufacture by a kind of general Conſent, but a Prohibition in effect? and how ſhould the Manufacture be ſupported, when our own People turn their Backs upon it, and when even the People that make it will hardly be perſwaded to wear it?</p>
            <p>I believe no Man will ask me, after this, how I will prove the Manufacture to be in a declining State, or what is the Reaſon of it; no more can they ask what Remedy is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to apply to this Evil: 'Tis an unaccountable Thing in a Manufacturing Nation like this, that Men ſhould ask what will reſtore the Trade, when they ſee ſo evidently what has been the Ruin of it.</p>
            <p>The Anſwer is ſhort, and (according to my Title) the Only Way to reſtore our Manufactures, is to WEAR THEM. The Conſumption at home is infinitely great: If our whole populous Nation were obliged to cloath only in their own Manufacture, we ſhould neither complain of our ſelves, or value the Prohibition of others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:1213901500:57"/>
If you will not do this (and the next Direction is as ſhort as that) you muſt abate the Quantity; and, as you Conſume leſs, Make leſs; what will Encreaſing the Work do for us, while we Decreaſe the Conſumption? It will in the End not only ruin the trading People, but ruin the Trade it Self: But I have not room to enlarge upon that Part here.</p>
