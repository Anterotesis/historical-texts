            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Not ſo, upon my Honour. I went ſoberly to Reſt at Twelve; but my Pillow and I never agreed worſe: There was no Part of it cou'd pleaſe me. But, when I account for our Quarrel, you will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly indulge in a hearty Laugh. In ſhort, after I left you at <hi>George</hi>'s I went to <hi>Ranelagh,</hi> where <hi>Townly</hi> introduc'd me to one of the moſt amiable, elegant, ſprightly, bewitching Females—that ever made Mortal melancholy.</p>

                  <p>Never was Man ſo chang'd. I drew <hi>Townly</hi> aſide, made a ſhort Inquiry into her Family and Character; and, finding both unexceptionable, I made a formal Declaration of an honourable Paſſion; which the dear Girl receiv'd in a moſt eaſy, open, becoming Manner.</p>

                  <p>Well, this is as ſtrange a Metamorphoſis as any in <hi>Ovid!</hi> but I believe it is only the Fore-runner of another. A Month's Poſſeſſion of the deſired Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, will convince him, however eaſily trapp'd, he is not long to be caged. Love, quotha! he has been as often in love, as he calls it, as I have been at ſhort Commons; and has changed his Mind much oftener, than I my Livery. I thought ſomething was gathering in the Wind when I let him in laſt Night. He was very eager to get to Bed too, which is never the Caſe, but when his Heart's full or his Purſe empty. I foreſee a World of Difficulty in this Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. So much the better—for, as he has but few Friends in Town, I muſt needs be a Party in the Plot—and when once I am deeply engag'd in the Secret—if I don't get well paid for keeping it, why then—But hold! Will that be honeſt? May be not —but 'twill be very convenient; and that's the firſt Thing to be conſider'd.</p>

His Addreſs ſo eaſy! his Converſation ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging! and when he made the wiſhed-for Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it was attended with ſuch Openneſs, and, at the ſame Time, ſuch unaffected Delicacy, that I ſoon bad adieu to Reſerve, and gave him ample Leave to hope the beſt. I laid before nim the Difficulty of a Correſpondence — but at that Inſtant, <hi>Cupid,</hi> be thanked! I thought of an Expedient to introduce him.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1196701000:8"/>I expect him preſently in the Diſguiſe of a foreign Tutor, lately recommended to my Father. If the real Maſter ſhould make his Appearance, we muſt employ my Gold, and your Smiles, upon that old Hypocrite <hi>Robin,</hi> and ſo get him diſmiſſed.</p>

                        <p>My Father's Buſineſs was as important as diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable. There has been a Relation with him, one Mr. <hi>Trapwell,</hi> of <hi>Oxford,</hi> who has given him Information of a young Gentleman's Arrival in Town, whoſe Name is <hi>Gilbert.</hi> He mentions him as a Man of great Fortune, and has promis'd, on his Return from <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> for which Place he has juſt ſet off, to introduce him to our Family. My Father ſeems conſident a Meeting will produce a Match. But, on my putting a few Negatives on the Matter, he has thought ſit to confine me
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1196701000:13"/>cloſer than ever. I am not to ſee any Body; ſo your Diſguiſe will avail but little. It is with Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty I write and ſend this. On any Alteration, will endeavour to give you the earlieſt Notice.</p>

                  <p>A very lucky one, I think; for now you have nothing to do, but to make an immediate Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of your Situation to the old Fellow, and the Affair will undoubtedly take a favourable Turn.</p>

                  <p>I am not very clear in that. What you mention might produce the deſir'd Effect, if I had not appear'd before him in my borrow'd Shape, which you are ſenſible muſt make a Part of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation: And who knows but ſuch a Step may, in his Eyes, give me too much the Air of an Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer, and lead him to make Inquiries, which, you know, will not be at all convenient: Nay, he may think it neceſſary to conſult my Father; and, if in the End it ſhould not prove agreeable to my old Gentleman, I ſhall repent my frank Confeſſion, as it will undoubtedly deprive me of all future Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of viſiting <hi>Celia</hi> in my feign'd Character; and I am determin'd not to give her up.</p>

He may find a thouſand Ways of introducing himſelf. This will, at leaſt, give me an Opportunity of conveying the Situation of Affairs in a Letter to the dear Girl. Nay, perhaps, procure her Liberty; which, if ſhe makes a proper Uſe of, we'll put the finiſhing Stroke to the Affair, before the Return of my <hi>Oxford</hi> Friend, <hi>Trapwell:</hi> And when my Father arrives, the three old Fellows

                  <p>But, Madam, don't be ſo ſevere upon me. Unleſs you ſuppoſe Prudence always attends Poverty, why ſhould you wonder that I am frail, when you have prov'd yourſelf ſo?
