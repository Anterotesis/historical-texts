            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>LAW—As a Science of methodized and artificial Equity, aboliſhed in France.</head>
            <p>A Government of the nature of that ſet up at our very door (France) has never been hitherto ſeen or even imagined in Europe. What our relation to it will be cannot be judged by other relations. It is a ſerious thing to have a connection with a people who live only under poſitive, arbitrary, and changeable inſtitutions; and thoſe not perfected nor ſupplied, nor explained by any common acknowledged rule of moral ſcience. I remember that in one of my laſt converſations with the late Lord Camden, we were ſtruck much in the ſame manner with the abolition in France of the law, as a ſcience of methodized and artificial equity. France, ſince her revolution, is under the ſway of a ſect, whoſe leaders have deliberately, at one ſtroke, demoliſhed the whole body of that juriſprudence which France had pretty nearly in common with other civilized coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. In that juriſprudence were contained the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and principles of the law of nations, the great ligament of mankind. With the law they have of courſe deſtroyed all ſeminaries in which juriſprudence was taught, as well as all the corporations eſtabliſhed for its conſervation. I have not heard of any coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, whether in Europe or Aſia, or even in Africa, on this ſide of Mount Atlas, which is wholly without ſome ſuch colleges and ſuch corporations, except France. No man, in a public or private concern, can divine by what rule or principle her judgments are to be directed; nor is there to be found a Profeſſor in any Univerſity, or a Practitioner in any Court, who will hazard an opinion of what is or is not law in France, in any caſe whatever. They have not only annulled all their old treaties, but they have renounced the law of nations, from whence treaties have their force.
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0244800202:4"/>
With a fixed deſign they have outlawed themſelves, and to their power outlawed all other nations. Inſtead of the religion and the law by which they were in a great and politic communion with the Chriſtian world, they have conſtructed their republic on three baſes, all fundamentally oppoſite to thoſe on which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities of Europe are built Its foundation is laid in Regicide, in Jacobiniſm, and in Atheiſm; and it has joined to thoſe principles a body of ſyſtematic man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners which ſecures their operation.—<bibl>

            <head>LAW OF CHANGE.</head>
            <p>WE muſt all obey the great law of change. It is the moſt powerful law of nature, and the means perhaps of its conſervation. All we can do, and that human wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom can do, is to provide that the change ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed by inſenſible degrees. This has all the benefits which may be in change, without any of the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies of mutation. Every thing is provided for as it arrives. This mode will, on the one hand, prevent the <hi>unfixing old intereſts at once;</hi> a thing which is apt to breed a black and ſullen diſcontent in thoſe who are at once diſpoſſeſſed of all their influence and conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This gradual courſe, on the other ſide, will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent men, long under depreſſion, from being intoxicated with a large draught of new power, which they always abuſe with a licentious inſolence. But wiſhing, as I do, the change to be gradual and cautious, I would, in my firſt ſteps, lean rather to the ſide of enlargement than reſtriction.—<bibl>

            <p>BAD laws are the worſt ſort of tyranny. In ſuch a country as this, they are of all bad things the worſt, worſe by far than any where elſe; and they derive a particular malignity even from the wiſdom and ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the reſt of our inſtitutions.

            <head>LAWGIVER. Character of a true Lawgiver.</head>
            <p>BUT it ſeems as if it were the prevalent opinion in Paris, that an unfeeling heart, and an undoubting confidence, are the ſole qualifications for a perfect legiſlator. Far different are my ideas of that high office. The true lawgiver ought to have an heart full of ſenſibility. He ought to love and reſpect his kind, and to fear himſelf. It may be allowed to his temperament to catch his ultimate object with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitive glance; but his movements towards it ought to be deliberate. Political arrangement, as it is a work for ſocial ends, is to be only wrought by ſocial means. There mind muſt conſpire with mind. Time is required to produce that union of minds which alone can produce all the good we aim at. Our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience will atchieve more than our force. If I might venture to appeal to what is ſo much out of faſhion in Paris, I mean to experience, I ſhould tell you, that in my courſe I have known, and, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my meaſure, have co-operated with great men, and I have never yet ſeen any plan which has not been mended by the obſervations of thoſe who were much inferior in underſtanding to the perſon who took the lead in the buſineſs. By a ſlow but well-ſuſtained progreſs, the effect of each ſtep is watched; the good or ill ſucceſs of the firſt, gives light to us in the ſecond; and ſo, from light to light, we are conducted with ſafety through the whole ſeries. We ſee, that the parts of the ſyſtem do not claſh. The evils latent in the moſt promiſing contrivances are provided for as they ariſe. One advantage is as little as poſſible ſacrificed to another. We compenſate, we reconcile, we balance. We are enabled to unite into a conſiſtent whole the various anomalies and contending principles that are found in the minds and affairs of men. From hence ariſes, not an excellence in ſimplicity, but one far ſuperior, an excellence in compoſition. Where the great intereſts of mankind
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0244800202:6"/>
are concerned through a long ſucceſſion of genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that ſucceſſion ought to be admitted into ſome ſhare in the councils which are ſo deeply to affect them. If juſtice requires this, the work itſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the aid of more minds than one age can fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh. It is from this view of things that the beſt legiſlators have been often ſatisfied with the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome ſure, ſolid, and ruling principle in government; a power like that which ſome of the philoſophers have called a plaſtic nature; and having fixed the principle, they have leſt it afterwards to its own operation.—<bibl>

This deſire of having ſome one below them, deſcends to thoſe who are the very loweſt of all; and a Proteſtant cobler, debaſed by his poverty, but exalted by his ſhare of the ruling church, feels a pride in knowing it is by his genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity alone, that the peer, whoſe footman's inſtep he meaſures, is able to keep his chaplain from a jail.

            <head>LOVE. The phyſical Cauſe of Love.</head>
            <p>WHEN we have before us ſuch objects as excite love and complacency, the body is affected, ſo far as I could obſerve, much in the following manner: The head reclines ſomething on one ſide; the eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0244800202:11"/>
are more cloſed than uſual, and the eyes roll gently with an inclination to the object; the mouth is a little opened, and the breath drawn ſlowly, with now and then a low ſigh; the whole body is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and the hands fall idly to the ſides. All this is accompanied with an inward ſenſe of melting and languor. Theſe appearances are always propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to the degree of beauty in the object, and of ſenſibility in the obſerver. And this gradation from the higheſt pitch of beauty and ſenſibility, even to the loweſt of mediocrity and indifference, and their correſpondent effects, ought to be kept in view, elſe this deſcription will ſeem exaggerated, which it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly is not. But from this deſcription it is almoſt impoſſible not to conclude, that beauty acts by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxing the ſolids of the whole ſyſtem. There are all the appearances of ſuch a relaxation; and a relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſomewhat below the natural tone ſeems to me to be the cauſe of all poſitive pleaſure. Who is a ſtranger to that manner of expreſſion ſo common in all times and in all countries, of being ſoftened, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxed, enervated, diſſolved, melted away by plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? The univerſal voice of mankind, faithful to their feelings, concurs in affirming this uniform and general effect: and although ſome odd and particular inſtance may perhaps be found, wherein there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears a conſiderable degree of poſitive pleaſure, without all the characters of relaxation, we muſt not therefore reject the concluſion we had drawn from a concurrence of many experiments; but we muſt ſtill retain it, ſubjoining the exceptions which may occur according to the judicious rule laid down by Sir Iſaac Newton in the third book of his Optics. Our poſition will, I conceive, appear confirmed beyond any reaſonable doubt, if we can ſhew that ſuch things as we have already obſerved to be the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine conſtituents of beauty, have each of them, ſeparately taken, a natural tendency to relax the fibres. And if it muſt be allowed us, that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the human body, when all theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituents

are united together before the ſenſory, fur ther favours this opinion, we may venture, I believe, to conclude, that the paſſion called love is produced by this relaxation. By the ſame method of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which we have uſed in the enquiry into the cauſes of the ſublime, we may likewiſe conclude, that as a beautiful object preſented to the ſenſe, by cauſing a relaxation in the body, produces the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of love in the mind; ſo if by any means the paſſion ſhould firſt have its origin in the mind, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation of the outward organs will as certainly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue in a degree proportioned to the cauſe.—<bibl>

            <p>Conſtitute government how you pleaſe, infinitely the greater part of it muſt depend upon the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the powers which are left at large to the prudence and uprightneſs of miniſters of ſtate. Even all the uſe and potency of the laws depends upon them. Without them, your commonwealth is no better than a ſcheme upon paper; and not a living, acting, effective conſtitution. It is poſſible, that through negligence, or ignorance, or deſign artfully conducted, miniſters may ſuffer one part of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to languiſh, another to be perverted from its purpoſes, and every valuable intereſt of the country to fall into ruin and decay, without poſſibility of fixing any ſingle act on which a criminal proſecution can be juſtly grounded. The due arrangement of men in the active part of the ſtate, far from being foreign to the purpoſes of a wiſe government, ought to be among its very firſt and deareſt objects. When, therefore, the abettors of the new ſyſtem tell us, that between them and their oppoſers there is nothing but a ſtruggle for power, and that therefore we are no ways concerned in it; we muſt tell thoſe who have the impudence to inſult us in this manner, that of all things we ought to be the moſt concerned, who and what ſort of men they are, that hold the truſt of every thing that is dear to us. Nothing can render this a point of indifference to the nation, but what muſt either render us totally deſperate, or ſoothe us into the ſecurity of ideots. We muſt ſoften into a credulity below the milkineſs of infancy, to think all men virtuous. We muſt be tainted with a
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0244800202:19"/>
malignity truly diabolical, to believe all the world to be equally wicked and corrupt. Men are in public life as in private, ſome good, ſome evil. The elevation of the one, and the depreſſion of the other, are the firſt objects of all true policy. But that form of government, which, neither in its direct inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nor in their immediate tendency, has contrived to throw its affairs into the moſt truſt worthy hands, but has left its whole executory ſyſtem to be diſpoſed of agreeably to the uncontrouled pleaſure of any one man, however excellent or virtuous, is a plan of polity defective not only in that member, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentially erroneous in every part of it.</p>
            <p>In arbitrary governments, the conſtitution of the miniſtry follows the conſtitution of the legiſlature. Both the law and the magiſtrate are the creatures of will. It muſt be ſo.

The people of a free common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, who have taken ſuch care that their laws ſhould be the reſult of general conſent, cannot be ſo ſenſeleſs as to ſuffer their executory ſyſtem to be compoſed of perſons on whom they have no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance, and whom no proofs of the public love and confidence have recommended to thoſe powers, upon the uſe of which the very being of the ſtate depends.</p>
            <p>The popular election of magiſtrates, and popular diſpoſition of rewards and honours, is one of the firſt advantages of a free ſtate. Without it, or ſomething equivalent to it, perhaps the people can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not long enjoy the ſubſtance of freedom; certainly none of the vivifying energy of good government. The frame of our commonwealth did not admit of ſuch an actual election: but it provided as well, and (while the ſpirit of the conſtitution is preſerved)
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0244800202:20"/>
better for all the effects of it than by the method of ſuffrage in any democratic ſtate whatſoever. It had always, until of late, been held the firſt duty of Parliament, <hi>to refuſe to ſupport Government, until power was in the hands of perſons who were acceptable to the people, or while factions predominated in the Court in which the nation had no confidence.</hi> Thus all the good effects of popular election were ſuppoſed to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to us, without the miſchiefs attending on per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual intrigue, and a diſtinct canvaſs for every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular office throughout the body of the people. This was the moſt noble and refined part of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. The people, by their repreſentatives and grandees, were intruſted with a deliberative power in making laws; the king with the controul of his negative. The king was intruſted with the delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative choice and the election to office; the people had the negative in a parliamentary refuſal to ſupport. Formerly this power of controul was what kept miniſters in awe of parliaments, and parliaments in reverence with the people. If the uſe of this power of controul on the ſyſtem and perſons of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration is gone, every thing is loſt, parliament and all. We may aſſure ourſelves, that if parliament will tamely ſee evil men take poſſeſſion of all the ſtrong holds of their country, and allow them time and means to fortify themſelves, under a pretence of giving them a fair trial, and upon a hope of diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whether they will not be reformed by power, and whether their meaſures will not be better than their morals; ſuch a parliament will give countenance to their meaſures alſo, whatever that parliament may pretend, and whatever thoſe meaſures may be.</p>
            <p>Every good political inſtitution muſt have a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventive operation as well as a remedial. It ought to have a natural tendency to exclude bad men from government, and not to truſt for the ſafety of the ſtate to ſubſequent puniſhment alone: puniſhment, which has ever been tardy and uncertain; and which,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0244800202:21"/>
when power is ſuffered in bad hands, may chance to fall rather on the injured than the criminal.</p>
            <p>Before men are put forward into the great truſts of the ſtate, they ought by their conduct to have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſuch a degree of eſtimation in their country, as may be ſome ſort of pledge and ſecurity to the public, that they will not abuſe thoſe truſts. It is no mean ſecurity for a proper uſe of power, that a man has ſhewn by the general tenor of his actions, that the affection, the good opinion, the confidence, of his fellow citizens have been among the principal objects of his life; and that he has owed none of the gradations of his power or fortune to a ſettled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, or occaſional forfeiture of their eſteem.</p>
            <p>That man who before he comes into power has no friends, or who coming into power is obliged to deſert his friends, or who loſing it has no friends to ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathize with him; he who has no ſway among any part of the landed or commercial intereſt, but whoſe whole importance has begun with his office, and is ſure to end with it; is a perſon who ought never to be ſuffered by a controuling parliament to continue in any of thoſe ſituations which confer the lead and direction of all our public affairs; becauſe ſuch a man <hi>has no connexion with the intereſt of the people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe knots or cabals of men who have got toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, avowedly without any public principle, in order to ſell their conjunct iniquity at the higher rate, and are therefore univerſally odious, ought never to be ſuffered to domineer in the ſtate; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have <hi>no connexion with the ſentiments and opinions of the people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are conſiderations which in my opinion enforce the neceſſity of having ſome better reaſon, in a free country, and a free parliament, for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the miniſters of the crown, than that ſhort one, <hi>That the king has thought proper to appoint them.</hi> There is ſomething very courtly in this. But it is a principle pregnant with all ſorts of miſchief, in a
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0244800202:22"/>
conſtitution like ours, to turn the views of active men from the country to the court. Whatever be the road to power, that is the road which will be trod. If the opinion of the country be of no uſe as a means of power or conſideration, the qualities which uſually procure that opinion will be no longer cultivated. And whether it will be right, in a ſtate ſo popular in its conſtitution as ours, to leave ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without popular motives, and to truſt all to the operation of pure virtue in the minds of kings and miniſters, and public men, muſt be ſubmitted to the judgment and good ſenſe of the people of England.</p>
            <p>Cunning men are here apt to break in, and, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out directly controverting the principle, to raiſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections from the difficulty under which the ſovereign labours to diſtinguiſh the genuine voice and ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his people, from the clamour of a faction, by which it is ſo eaſily counterfeited. The nation, they ſay, is generally divided into parties, with views and paſſions utterly irreconcileable. If the king ſhould put his affairs into the hands of any one of them, he is ſure to diſguſt the reſt; if he ſelect par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular men from among them all, it is an hazard that he diſguſts them all. Thoſe who are left out, however divided before, will ſoon run into a body of oppoſition; which, being a collection of many diſcontents into one focus, will without doubt be hot and violent enough. Faction will make its cries reſound through the nation, as if the whole were in an uproar, when by far the majority, and much the better part, will ſeem for a while as it were annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by the quiet in which their virtue and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion incline them to enjoy the bleſſings of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Beſides that the opinion of the mere vulgar is a miſerable rule even with regard to themſelves, on account of their violence and inſtability. So that if you were to gratify them in their humour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, that very gratification would be a ground of their diſſatisfaction on the next. Now as all theſe
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0244800202:23"/>
rules of public opinion are to be collected with great difficulty, and to be applied with equal uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty as to the effect, what better can a king of England do, than to employ ſuch men as he finds to have views and inclinations moſt conformable to his own; who are leaſt infected with pride and ſelf will, and who are leaſt moved by ſuch popular humours as are perpetually traverſing his deſigns, and diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſervice; truſting that, when he means no ill to his people, he will be ſupported in his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whether he chooſes to keep or to change, as his private judgment or his pleaſure leads him? He will find a ſure reſource in the real weight and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the crown, when it is not ſuffered to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an inſtrument in the hands of a faction.</p>
            <p>I will not pretend to ſay that there is nothing at all in this mode of reaſoning; becauſe I will not aſſert that there is no difficulty in the art of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Undoubtedly the very beſt adminiſtration muſt encounter a great deal of oppoſition; and the very worſt will find more ſupport than it deſerves. Sufficient appearances will never be wanting to thoſe who have a mind to deceive themſelves. It is a fallacy in conſtant uſe with thoſe who would level all things, and confound right with wrong, to inſiſt upon the inconveniencies which are attached to every choice, without taking into conſideration the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent weight and conſequence of thoſe inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. The queſtion is not concerning <hi>abſolute</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content or <hi>perfect</hi> ſatisfaction in government; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which can be pure and unmixed at any time, or upon any ſyſtem. The controverſy is about that degree of good humour in the people, which may poſſibly be attained, and ought certainly to be looked for. While ſome politicians may be waiting to know whether the ſenſe of every individual be againſt them, accurately diſtinguiſhing the vulgar from the better ſort, drawing lines between the enterprizes of a faction and the efforts of a people, they may chance
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0244800202:24"/>
to ſee the government, which they are ſo nicely weighing and dividing, and diſtinguiſhing, tumble to the ground in the midſt of their wiſe deliberation. Prudent men, when ſo great an object as the ſecurity of government, or even its peace, is at ſtake, will not run the riſk of a deciſion which may be fatal to it. They who can read the political ſky will ſee an hurricane in a cloud no bigger than an hand at the very edge of the horizon, and will run into the firſt harbour. No lines can be laid down for civil or political wiſdom. They are a matter incapable of exact definition. But, though no man can draw a ſtroke between the confines of day and night, yet light and darkneſs are upon the whole tolerably diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhable. Nor will it be impoſſible for a prince to find out ſuch a mode of government, and ſuch perſons to adminiſter it, as will give a great degree of content to his people; without any curious and anxious reſearch for that abſtract, univerſal, perfect harmony, which while he is ſeeking, he abandons thoſe means of ordinary tranquillity which are in his power without any reſearch at all.</p>
            <p>It is not more the duty than it is the intereſt of a prince, to aim at giving tranquillity to his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But thoſe who adviſe him may have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in diſorder and confuſion. If the opinion of the people is againſt them, they will naturally wiſh that it ſhould have no prevalence. Here it is that the people muſt on their part ſhew themſelves ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of their own value. Their whole importance, in the firſt inſtance, and afterwards their whole free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, is at ſtake. Their freedom cannot long ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive their importance. Here it is that the natural ſtrength of the kingdom, the great peers, the leading landed gentlemen, the opulent merchants and manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturers, the ſubſtantial yeomanry, muſt interpoſe, to reſcue their prince, themſelves, and their poſterity.—<bibl>

            <head>MINISTERS. Character of the interior Miniſtry, (See CABINET (DOUBLE.)</head>
            <p>THE interior miniſtry are ſenſible, that war is a ſituation which ſets in its full light the value of the hearts of a people; and they well know, that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the importance of the people muſt be the end of theirs. For this reaſon they diſcover upon all occaſions the utmoſt fear of every thing, which by poſſibility may lead to ſuch an event. I do not mean that they manifeſt any of that pious fear which is backward to commit the ſafety of the country to the dubious experiment of war. Such a fear, being the tender ſenſation of virtue, excited, as it is regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, by reaſon, frequently ſhews itſelf in a ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able boldneſs, which keeps danger at a diſtance, by ſeeming to deſpiſe it. Their fear betrays to the firſt glance of the eye, its true cauſe, and its real object. Foreign powers, confident in the knowledge of their character, have not ſcrupled to violate the moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn treaties; and, in defiance of them, to make conqueſts in the midſt of a general peace, and in the heart of Europe. Such was the conqueſt of Corſica, by the profeſſed enemies of the freedom of mankind, in defiance of thoſe who were formerly its profeſſed defenders. We have had juſt claims upon the ſame powers; rights which ought to have been ſacred to them as well as to us, as they had their origin in our lenity and generoſity towards France and Spain in the day of their great humiliation. Such I call the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of Manilla, and the demand on France for the Eaſt India priſoners. But theſe powers put a juſt confidence in their reſource of the <hi>double cabinet.</hi> Theſe demands (one of them at leaſt) are haſtening faſt towards an acquittal by preſcription. Oblivion begins to ſpread her cobwebs over all our ſpirited remonſtrances. Some of the moſt valuable branches of our trade are alſo on the point of periſhing from
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0244800202:26"/>
the ſame cauſe. I do not mean thoſe branches which bear without the hand of the vine-dreſſer; I mean thoſe which the policy of treaties had formerly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to us; I mean to mark and diſtinguiſh the trade of Portugal, the loſs of which, and the power of the cabal, have one and the ſame aera.</p>
            <p>If, by any chance, the miniſters who ſtand before the curtain poſſeſs or affect any ſpirit, it makes little or no impreſſion. Foreign courts and miniſters, who were among the firſt to diſcover and to profit by this invention of the <hi>double cabinet,</hi> attend very little to their remonſtrances. They know that thoſe ſhadows of miniſters have nothing to do in the ultimate diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of things. Jealouſies and animoſities are ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly nouriſhed in the outward adminiſtration, and have been even conſidered as a <hi>cauſa ſine qua non</hi> in its conſtitution: thence foreign courts have a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, that nothing can be done by common counſel in this nation. If one of thoſe miniſters officially takes up a buſineſs with ſpirit, it ſerves only the better to ſignalize the meanneſs of the reſt, and the diſcord of them all. His colleagues in office are in haſte to ſhake him off, and to diſclaim the whole of his proceedings. Of this nature was that aſtoniſhing tranſaction, in which Lord Rochford, our ambaſſador at Paris, remonſtrated againſt the attempt upon Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſica, in conſequence of a direct authority from Lord Shelburne. This remonſtrance the French miniſter treated with the contempt that was natural; as he was aſſured, from the ambaſſador of his court to ours, that theſe orders of Lord Shelburne were not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the reſt of the (I had like to have ſaid Britiſh) adminiſtration. Lord Rochford, a man of ſpirit, could not endure this ſituation. The conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences were, however, curious. He returns from Paris, and comes home full of anger. Lord Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne, who gave the orders, is obliged to give up the ſeals. Lord Rochford, who obeyed theſe orders, receives them. He goes, however, into another
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0244800202:27"/>
department of the ſame office, that he might not be obliged officially to acquieſce in one ſituation under what he had officially remonſtrated againſt in another. At Paris, the Duke of Choiſcul conſidered this office arrangement as a compliment to him: here it was ſpoke of as an attention to the delicacy of Lord Rochford. But whether the compliment was to one or both, to this nation it was the ſame. By this tranſaction the condition of our court lay expoſed in all its nakedneſs. Our office correſpondence has loſt all pretence to authenticity; Britiſh policy is brought into deriſion in thoſe nations, that a while ago trembled at the power of our arms, whilſt they looked up with confidence to the equity, firmneſs, and candour, which ſhone in all our negotiations. I repreſent this matter exactly in the light in which it has been univerſally received.</p>
            <p>Such has been the aſpect of our foreign politics, under the influence of a <hi>double cabinet.</hi> With ſuch an arrangement at court, it is impoſſible it ſhould have been otherwiſe. Nor is it poſſible that this ſcheme ſhould have a better effect upon the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our dependencies, the firſt, the deareſt, and moſt delicate objects, of the interior policy of this empire. The colonies know, that adminiſtration is ſeparated from the court, divided within itſelf, and deteſted by the nation. The <hi>double cabinet</hi> has, in both the parts of it, ſhewn the moſt malignant diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions towards them, without being able to do them the ſmalleſt miſchief.</p>
            <p>They are convinced, by ſufficient experience, that no plan, either of lenity or rigour, can be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued with uniformity and perſeverance. Therefore they turn their eyes entirely from Great Britain, where they have neither dependence on friendſhip, nor apprehenſion from enmity. They look to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their own arrangements. They grow every day into alienation from this country; and whilſt they are becoming diſconnected with our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0244800202:28"/>
we have not the conſolation to find, that they are even friendly in their new independence. Nothing can equal the futility, the weakneſs, the raſhneſs, the timidity, the perpetual contradiction, in the management of our affairs in that part of the world. A volume might be written on this melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly ſubject; but it were better to leave it entirely to the reflexions of the reader himſelf than not to treat it in the extent it deſerves.</p>
            <p>In what manner our domeſtic oeconomy is affected by this ſyſtem, it is needleſs to explain. It is the perpetual ſubject of their own complaints.</p>
            <p>The court party reſolve the whole into faction. Having ſaid ſomething before upon this ſubject, I ſhall only obſerve here, that when they give this account of the prevalence of faction, they preſent no very favourable aſpect of the confidence of the people in their own government. They may be aſſured, that however they amuſe themſelves with a variety of projects for ſubſtituting ſomething elſe in the place of that great and only foundation of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, the confidence of the people, every attempt will but make their condition worſe. When men imagine that their food is only a cover for poiſon, and when they neither love nor truſt the hand that ſerves it, it is not the name of the roaſt beef of Old England, that will perſuade them to ſit down to the table that is ſpread for them. When the people conceive that laws, and tribunals, and even popular aſſemblies, are perverted from the ends of their inſtitution, they find in thoſe names of degenerated eſtabliſhments only new motives to diſcontent. Thoſe bodies, which, when full of life and beauty, lay in their arms, and were their joy and comfort, when dead and putrid, become but the more loathſome from remembrance of former endearments. A ſullen gloom, and furious diſorder, prevail by fits; the nation loſes its reliſh for peace and proſperity, as it did in that ſeaſon of fullneſs
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0244800202:29"/>
which opened our troubles in the time of Charles the Firſt. A ſpecies of men to whom a ſtate of order would become a ſentence of obſcurity, are nouriſhed into a dangerous magnitude by the heat of inteſtine diſturbances; and it is no wonder that, by a ſort of ſiniſter piety, they cheriſh, in their turn, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders which are the parents of all their conſequence. Superficial obſervers conſider ſuch perſons as the cauſe of the public uneaſineſs, when, in truth, they are nothing more than the effect of it. Good men look upon this diſtracted ſcene with ſorrow and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation. Their hands are tied behind them. They are deſpoiled of all the power which might enable them to reconcile the ſtrength of government with the rights of the people. They ſtand in a moſt diſtreſſing alternative. But in the election among evils they hope better things from temporary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, than from eſtabliſhed ſervitude. In the mean time, the voice of law is not to be heard. Fierce licentiouſneſs begets violent reſtraints. The military arm is the ſole reliance; and then, call your conſtitution what you pleaſe, it is the ſword that governs. The civil power, like every other that calls in the aid of an ally ſtronger than itſelf, periſhes by the aſſiſtance it recieves. But the contrivers of this ſcheme of government will not truſt ſolely to the military power; becauſe they are cunning men. Their reſtleſs and crooked ſpirit drives them to rake in the dirt of every kind of expedient. Unable to rule the multitude, they endeavour to raiſe diviſions amongſt them. One mob is hired to deſtroy another; a procedure which at once encourages the boldneſs of the populace, and juſtly increaſes their diſcontent. Men become penſioners of ſtate on account of their abilities in the array of riot, and the diſcipline of confuſion. Government is put under the diſgraceful neceſſity of protecting from the ſeverity of the laws that very licentiouſneſs, which the laws had been before violated to repreſs. Every thing partakes of
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0244800202:30"/>
the original diſorder. Anarchy predominates without freedom, and ſervitude without ſubmiſſion or ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination. Theſe are the conſequences inevitable to our public peace, from the ſcheme of rendering the executory government at once odious and feeble; of freeing adminiſtration from the conſtitutional and ſalutary controul of parliament, and inventing for it a <hi>new controul,</hi> unknown to the conſtitution, an <hi>interior cabinet;</hi> which brings the whole body of government into confuſion and contempt.</p>
            <p>After having ſtated, as ſhortly as I am able, the effects of this ſyſtem on our foreign affairs, on the policy of our government with regard to our depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies, and on the interior oeconomy of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth; there remains only, in this part of my deſign, to ſay ſomething of the grand principle which firſt recommended this ſyſtem at court. The pretence was, to prevent the king from being enſlaved by a faction, and made a priſoner in his cloſet. This ſcheme might have been expected to anſwer at leaſt its own end, and to indemnify the king, in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal capacity, for all the confuſion into which it has thrown his government. But has it in reality anſwered this purpoſe? I am ſure, if it had, every affectionate ſubject would have one motive for endur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with patience all the evils which attend it.</p>
            <p>In order to come at the truth in this matter, it may not be amiſs to conſider it ſomewhat in detail. I ſpeak here of the king, and not of the crown; the intereſts of which we have already touched. Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of that greatneſs which a king poſſeſſes merely by being a repreſentative of the national dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, the things in which he may have an individual intereſt ſeem to be theſe: wealth accumulated; wealth ſpent in magnificence, pleaſure, or beneficence; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal reſpect and attention; and above all, private eaſe and repoſe of mind. Theſe compoſe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventory of proſperous circumſtances, whether they regard a prince or a ſubject; their enjoyments differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only in the ſcales upon which they are formed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:0244800202:31"/>Suppoſe then we were to aſk, whether the king has been richer than his predeceſſors in accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated wealth, ſince the eſtabliſhment of the plan of favouritiſm? I believe it will be found that the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of royal indigence which our court has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented until this year, has been truly humiliating. Nor has it been relieved from this unſeemly diſtreſs, but by means which have hazarded the affection of the people, and ſhaken their confidence in parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If the public treaſures had been exhauſted in magnificence and ſplendour, this diſtreſs would have been accounted for, and in ſome meaſure juſtified. Nothing would be more unworthy of this nation, than with a mean and mechanical rule, to mete out the ſplendour of the crown. Indeed I have found very few perſons diſpoſed to ſo ungenerous a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure. But the generality of people, it muſt be confeſſed, do feel a good deal mortified, when they compare the wants of the court with its expences. They do not behold the cauſe of this diſtreſs in any part of the apparatus of royal magnificence. In all this, they ſee nothing but the operations of parſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, attended with all the conſequences of profu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Nothing expended, nothing ſaved. Their wonder is encreaſed by their knowledge, that beſides the revenue ſettled on his majeſty's civil liſt to the amount of 800,000 <hi>l.</hi> a year, he has a farther aid, from a large penſion liſt, near 90,000 <hi>l.</hi> a year, in Ireland; from the produce of the dutchy of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter (which we are told has been greatly improved); from the revenue of the dutchy of Cornwall; from the American quit-rents; from the four and a half <hi>per cent.</hi> duty in the Leeward Iſlands; this laſt worth to be ſure conſiderably more than 40,000 <hi>l.</hi> a year. The whole is certainly not much ſhort of a million annually.</p>
            <p>Theſe are revenues within the knowledge and cognizance of our national councils. We have no direct right to examine into the receipts from his
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0244800202:32"/>
majeſty's German dominions, and the biſhopric of Oſnabrug. This is unqueſtionably true. But that which is not within the province of parliament, is yet within the ſphere of every man's own reflexion. If a foreign prince reſided amongſt us, the ſtate of his revenues could not fail of becoming the ſubject of our ſpeculation. Filled with an anxious concern for whatever regards the welfare of our ſovereign, it is impoſſible, in conſidering the miſerable circumſtances into which he has been brought, that this obvious topic ſhould be entirely paſſed over. There is an opinion univerſal, that theſe revenues produce ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing not inconſiderable, clear of all charges and eſtabliſhments. This produce the people do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to be hoarded, nor perceive to be ſpent. It is accounted for in the only manner it can, by ſuppoſing that it is drawn away, for the ſupport of that court faction, which, whilſt it diſtreſſes the nation, impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſhes the prince in every one of his reſources. I once more caution the reader, that I do not urge this conſideration concerning the foreign revenue, as if I ſuppoſed we had a direct right to examine into the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penditure of any part of it; but ſolely for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of ſhewing how little this ſyſtem of favouritiſm has been advantageous to the monarch himſelf; which, without magnificence, has ſunk him into a ſtate of unnatural poverty; at the ſame time that he poſſeſſed every means of affluence, from ample re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, both in this country, and in other parts of his dominions.</p>
            <p>Has this ſyſtem provided better for the treatment becoming his high and ſacred character, and ſecured the king from thoſe diſguſts attached to the neceſſity of employing men who are not perſonally agreeable? This is a topic upon which for many reaſons I could wiſh to be ſilent; but the pretence of ſecuring againſt ſuch cauſes of uneaſineſs, is the corner-ſtone of the court party. It has, however, ſo happened, that if I were to fix upon any one point, in which this ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0244800202:33"/>
has been more particularly and ſhamefully blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, the effects which it has produced would juſtify me in chooſing for that point its tendency to degrade the perſonal dignity of the ſovereign, and to expoſe him to a thouſand contradictions and mortifications. It is but too evident in what manner theſe projectors of royal greatneſs have fulfilled all their magnificent promiſes. Without recapitulating all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the reign, every one of which is more or leſs a melancholy proof of the truth of what I have advanced, let us conſider the language of the court but a few years ago, concerning moſt of the perſons now in the external adminiſtration: let me aſk, whether any enemy to the perſonal feelings of the ſovereign, could poſſibly contrive a keener inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mortification, and degradation of all dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, than almoſt every part and member of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent arrangement? nor, in the whole courſe of our hiſtory, has any compliance with the will of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ever been known to extort from any prince a greater contradiction to all his own declared affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and diſlikes than that which is now adopted, in direct oppoſition to every thing the people approve and deſire.</p>
            <p>An opinion prevails, that greatneſs has been more than once adviſed to ſubmit to certain condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions towards individuals, which have been denied to the entreaties of a nation. For the meaneſt and moſt dependent inſtrument of this ſyſtem knows, that there are hours when its exiſtence may depend upon his adherence to it; and he takes his advantage accordingly. Indeed it is a law of nature, that whoever is neceſſary to what we have made our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, is ſure, in ſome way, or in ſome time or other, to become our maſter. All this, however, is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to, in order to avoid that monſtrous evil of governing in concurrence with the opinion of the people. For it ſeems to be laid down as a maxim,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0244800202:34"/>
that a king has ſome ſort of intereſt in giving un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs to his ſubjects: that all who are pleaſing to them, are to be of courſe diſagreeable to him: that as ſoon as the perſons who are odious at court are known to be odious to the people, it is ſnatched at as a lucky occaſion of ſhowering down upon them all kinds of emoluments and honours. None are conſidered as well-wiſhers to the crown, but thoſe who adviſe to ſome unpopular courſe of action; none capable of ſerving it, but thoſe who are obliged to call at every inſtant upon all its power for the ſafety of their lives. None are ſuppoſed to be fit prieſts in the temple of government, but the perſons who are compelled to fly into it for ſanctuary. Such is the effect of this refined project; ſuch is ever the reſult of all the contrivances which are uſed to free men from the ſervitude of their reaſon, and from the neceſſity of ordering their affairs according to their evident intereſts. Theſe contrivances oblige them to run into a real and ruinous ſervitude, in order to avoid a ſuppoſed reſtraint that might be attended with advantage.</p>
            <p>If, therefore, this ſyſtem has ſo ill anſwered its own grand pretence of ſaving the king from the neceſſity of employing perſons diſagreeable to him, has it given more peace and tranquillity to his majeſty's private hours? No, moſt certainly. The father of his people cannot poſſibly enjoy repoſe, while his family is in ſuch a ſtate of diſtraction. Then what has the crown or the king profitted by all this fine-wrought ſcheme? Is he more rich, or more ſplendid, or more powerful, or more at his eaſe, by ſo many labours and contrivances? Have they not beggared his exchequer, tarniſhed the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of his court, ſunk his dignity, galled his feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, diſcompoſed the whole order and happineſs of his private life.—<bibl>

            <head>MANNERS.</head>
            <p>MANNERS are of more importance than laws. In a great meaſure the laws depend upon them. The law touches us but here and there, and now and then. Manners are what vex or ſooth, corrupt or purify, exalt or debaſe, barbarize or refine us, by a conſtant, ſteady, uniform, inſenſible operation, like that of the air we breathe in. They give their whole form and colour to our lives. According to their quality, they aid morals, they ſupply them, or they totally deſtroy them. Of this the new French Legiſlators were aware; therefore, with the ſame method, and under the ſame authority, they ſettled a ſyſtem of manners, the moſt licentious, proſtitute, and abandoned, and, at the ſame time, the moſt coarſe, rude, ſavage, and ſerocious. Nothing in the Revolution, no, not to a phraſe or a geſture, not to the faſhion of a hat or a ſhoe, was left to accident. All was the reſult of deſign; all was matter of inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. No mechanical means could be deviſed in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of this incredible ſyſtem of wickedneſs and vice, that has not been employed. The nobleſt paſſions, the love of glory, the love of country, were debauched into means of it's preſervation and it's propagation. All ſorts of ſhews and exhibitions calculated to inflame and vitiate the imagination, and pervert the moral ſenſe, have been contrived. They have ſometimes brought forth five or ſix hundred drunken women, calling at the bar of the Aſſembly for the blood of their own children, as being royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts or conſtitutionals. Sometimes they have got a body of wretches, calling themſelves fathers, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the murder of their ſons; boaſting that Rome had but one Brutus, but that they could ſhew five hundred. There were inſtances, in which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and retaliated the impiety, and produced ſons, who called for the execution of their parents. The foundation of their republic is founded in moral

paradoxes. Their patriotiſm is always prodigy. All thoſe inſtances to be found in hiſtory, whether real or fabulous, of a doubtful public ſpirit, at which morality is perplexed, reaſon is ſtaggered, and from which a frighted nature recoils, are their choſen, and almoſt ſole examples for the inſtruction of their youth.—<bibl>

            <p>OTHER Legiſlators, knowing that marriage is the origin of all relations, and conſequently the firſt element of all duties, have endeavoured, by every art, to make it ſacred. The Chriſtian religion, by confining it to the pairs, and by rendering that rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion indiſſoluble, has, by theſe two things, done more towards the peace, happineſs, ſettlement, and civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation of the world, than by any other part in this whole ſcheme of Divine Wiſdom. The direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary courſe was taken in the Synagogue of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, I mean in that forge and manufactory of all
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0244800202:38"/>
evil, the ſect which predominated in the Conſtituent Aſſembly of 1789. Thoſe monſters employed the ſame, or greater induſtry, to deſecrate and degrade that State, which other Legiſlators have uſed to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it holy and honourable. By a ſtrange, uncalled for declaration, they pronounced, that marriage was no better than a common, civil contract. It was one of their ordinary tricks, to put their ſentiments into the mouths of certain perſonated characters, which they theatrically exhibited at the bar of what ought to be a ſerious Aſſembly. One of theſe was brought out in the figure of a proſtitute, whom they called by the affected name of <q rend="inline">"a mother without being a wife."</q> This creature they made to call for a repeal of the incapacities, which in civilized States are put upon baſtards. The proſtitutes of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly gave to this their puppet, the ſanction of their greater impudence. In conſequence of the principles laid down, and the manners authoriſed, baſtards were not long after put on the footing of the iſſue of lawful unions. Proceeding in the ſpirit of the firſt authors of their conſtitution, they went the full length of the principle, and gave a licence to divorce at the mere pleaſure of either party, and at four day's notice. With them the matrimonial connexion was brought into ſo degrading a ſtate of concubinage, that, I believe, none of the wretches in London, who keep warehouſes of infamy, would give out one of their victims to private cuſtody on ſo ſhort and inſolent a tenure. There was, indeed, a kind of profligate equity in thus giving to women the ſame licentious power. The reaſon they aſſigned was as infamous as the act, declaring that women had been too long under the tyranny of parents and of huſbands. It is not neceſſary to obſerve upon the horrible conſequences of taking one half of the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies wholly out of the guardianſhip and protection of the other.—<bibl>

            <head>MONASTIC INSTITUTIONS.</head>
            <p>THERE are moments in the fortune of ſtates when particular men are called to make improvements by great mental exertion. In thoſe moments, even when they ſeem to enjoy the confidence of their prince and country, and to be inveſted with full au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, they have not always apt inſtruments. A politician, to do great things, looks for a <hi>power,</hi> what our workmen call a <hi>purchaſe;</hi> and if he finds that power, in politics as in mechanics, he cannot be at a loſs to apply it. In the monaſtic inſtitutions, in my opinion, was found a great <hi>power</hi> for the mechaniſm of politic benevolence. There were revenues with a public direction; there were men wholly ſet apart and dedicated to public purpoſes, without any other than public ties and public principles; men without the poſſibility of converting the eſtate of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity into a private fortune; men denied to ſelf-intereſts, whoſe avarice is for ſome community; men to whom perſonal poverty is honour, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit obedience ſtands in the place of freedom. In vain ſhall a man look to the poſſibility of making ſuch things when he wants them. The winds blow as they liſt. Theſe inſtitutions are the products of enthuſiaſm; they are the inſtruments of wiſdom. Wiſdom cannot create materials; they are the gifts of nature or of chance; her pride is in the uſe. The perennial exiſtence of bodies corporate and their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, are things particularly ſuited to a man who has long views; who meditates deſigns that require time in faſhioning; and which propoſe duration when they are accompliſhed. He is not deſerving to rank high, or even to be mentioned in the order of great ſtateſmen, who, having obtained the command and direction of ſuch a power as exiſted in the wealth, the diſcipline, and the habits of ſuch corporations, as thoſe which you have raſhly deſtroyed, cannot find any way of converting it to the great and laſting
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0244800202:40"/>
benefit of his country. On the view of this ſubject a thouſand uſes ſuggeſt themſelves to a contriving mind. To deſtroy any power, growing wild from the rank productive force of the human mind, is almoſt tantamount, in the moral world, to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the apparently active properties of bodies in the material. It would be like the attempt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy (if it were in our competence to deſtroy) the expanſive force of fixed air in nitre, or the power of ſteam, or of electricity, or of magnetiſm. Theſe energies always exiſted in nature, and they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways diſcernible. They ſeemed, ſome of them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviceable, ſome noxious, ſome no better than a ſport to children; until contemplative ability, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bining with practic ſkill, tamed their wild nature, ſubdued them to uſe, and rendered them at once the moſt powerful and the moſt tractable agents, in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervience to the great views and deſigns of men. Did fifty thouſand perſons, whoſe mental and whoſe bodily labour you might direct, and ſo many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand a year of a revenue, which was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lazy nor ſuperſtitious, appear too big for your abilities to wield? Had you no way of uſing the men but by converting monks into penſioners? Had you no way of turning the revenue to account, but through the improvident reſource of a ſpendthrift ſale? If you were thus deſtitute of mental funds, the proceeding is in its natural courſe. Your politicians do not underſtand their trade; and therefore they ſell their tools.</p>
            <p>But the inſtitutions favour of ſuperſtition in their very principle; and they nouriſh it by a permanent and ſtanding influence. This I do not mean to diſpute; but this ought not to hinder you from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving from ſuperſtition itſelf any reſources which may thence be furniſhed for the public advantage. You derive benefits from many diſpoſitions and many paſſions of the human mind, which are of as doubtful a colour in the moral eye, as ſuperſtition itſelf. It
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0244800202:41"/>
was your buſineſs to correct and mitigate every thing which was noxious in this paſſion, as in all the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. But is ſuperſtition the greateſt of all poſſible vices? In its poſſible exceſs I think it becomes a very great evil. It is, however, a moral ſubject; and, of courſe, admits of all degrees and all modifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations. Superſtition is the religion of feeble minds; and they muſt be tolerated in an intermixture of it, in ſome trifling or ſome enthuſiaſtic ſhape or other, elſe you will deprive weak minds of a reſource found neceſſary to the ſtrongeſt. The body of all true religion conſiſts, to be ſure, in obedience to the will of the ſovereign of the world; in a confidence in his declarations; and an imitation of his perfections. The reſt is our own. It may be prejudicial to the great end; it may be auxiliary. Wiſe men, who as ſuch, are not <hi>admirers</hi> (not admirers at leaſt of the <hi>Manera Terrae</hi>) are not violently attached to theſe things, nor do they violently hate them. Wiſdom is not the moſt ſevere corrector of folly. They are the rival follies, which mutually wage ſo unrelenting a war; and which make ſo cruel a uſe of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, as they can happen to engage the immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate vulgar on the one ſide or the other in their quarrels. Prudence would be neuter; but if, in the contention between fond attachment and fierce anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy concerning things in their nature not made to produce ſuch heats, a prudent man were obliged to make a choice of what errors and exceſſes of enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm he would condemn or bear, perhaps he would think the ſuperſtition which builds, to be more toler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than that which demoliſhes—that which adorns a country, than that which deforms it—that which endows, than that which plunders— that which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to miſtaken beneficence, than that which ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to real injuſtice—that which leads a man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to himſelf lawful pleaſures, than that which ſnatches from others the ſcanty ſubſiſtence of their ſelf-denial. Such, I think, is very nearly the ſtate of

I ſhall undertake to ſhew, that upon two others, that the inordinate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits given, with the loſſes incurred in order to ſecure thoſe profits, would pay a year's dividend more.</p>
            <p>It is a third property of trading men, to ſee that their clerks do not divert the dealings of the maſter to their own benefit. It was the other day only, when their governor and council taxed the company's inveſtment with a ſum of fifty thouſand pounds, as an inducement to perſuade only ſeven members of their board of trade to give their <hi>honour</hi> that they would abſtain from ſuch profits upon that inveſtment as they muſt have violated their <hi>oaths</hi> if they had made at all.</p>
            <p>It is a fourth quality of a merchant to be exact in his accounts. What will be thought, when you have fully before you the mode of accounting made uſe of in the treaſury of Bengal?—I hope you will have it ſoon. With regard to one of their agencies, when it came to the material part, the prime coſt of the goods on which a commiſſion of fifteen <hi>per cent.</hi> was allowed, to the aſtoniſhment of the factory to whom the commodities were ſent, the accountant-ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral reports that he did not think himſelf authorized to call for <hi>vouchers</hi> relative to this and other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars—becauſe the agent was upon his <hi>honour</hi> with regard to them. A new principle of account upon honour ſeems to be regularly eſtabliſhed in their dealings and their treaſury, which in reality amounts
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0244800202:45"/>
to an entire annihilation of the principle of all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.</p>
            <p>It is a fifth property of a merchant, who does not meditate a fraudulent bankruptcy, to calculate his probable profits upon the money he takes up to veſt in buſineſs. Did the company, when they bought goods on bonds bearing 8 <hi>per cent.</hi> intereſt, at 10, and even 20 <hi>per cent.</hi> diſcount, even aſk themſelves a queſtion concerning the poſſibility of advantage from dealing on theſe terms?</p>
            <p>The laſt quality of a merchant I ſhall advert to, is the taking care to be properly prepared, in caſh or goods, in the ordinary courſe of ſale, for the bills which are drawn on them. Now I aſk, whether they have ever calculated the clear produce of any given ſales, to make them tally with the four million of bills which are come and coming upon them, ſo as at the proper periods to enable the one to liqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date the other? No, they have not. They are now obliged to borrow money of their own ſervants to purchaſe their inveſtment. The ſervants ſtipulate five <hi>per cent.</hi> on the capital they advance, if their bills ſhould not be paid at the time when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come due; and the value of the rupee on which they charge this intereſt is taken at two ſhillings and a penny. Has the company ever troubled themſelves to enquire whether their ſales can bear the payment of that intereſt, and at that rate of exchange? Have they once conſidered the dilemma in which they are placed—the ruin of their credit in the Eaſt Indies, if they refuſe the bills—the ruin of their credit and exiſtence in England, if they accept them? Indeed no trace of equitable government is found in their politics; not one trace of commercial principle in their mercantile dealing; and hence is the deepeſt and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trueſt wiſdom of parliament demanded, and the beſt reſources of this kingdom muſt be ſtrained, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore them; that is, to reſtore the countries deſtroyed by the miſconduct of the company, and to reſtore

<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0244800202:51"/>
whether this might not have been rather to overſtrain the principle. Certain it is, the beſt patriots in the greateſt commonwealths have always commended and promoted ſuch connexions. <hi>Idem ſentire de repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica,</hi> was with them a principal ground of friendſhip and attachment; nor do I know any other capable of forming firmer, dearer, more pleaſing, more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, and more virtuous habitudes. The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans carried this principle a great way. Even the holding of offices together, the diſpoſition of which aroſe from chance not ſelection, gave riſe to a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which continued for life. It was called <hi>neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudo ſortis;</hi> and it was looked upon with a ſacred re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence. Breaches of any of theſe kinds of civil relation were conſidered as acts of the moſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed turpitude. The whole people was diſtributed into political ſocieties, in which they acted in ſupport of ſuch intereſts in the ſtate as they ſeverally affected. For it was then thought no crime to endeavour, by every honeſt means, to advance to ſuperiority and power thoſe of your own ſentiments and opinions. This wiſe people was far from imagining that thoſe connexions had no tie, and obliged to no duty; but that men might quit them without ſhame, upon every call of intereſt. They believed private honour to be the great foundation of public truſt; that friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was no mean ſtep towards patriotiſm; that he who, in the common intercourſe of life, ſhewed he regarded ſomebody beſides himſelf, when he came to act in a public ſituation, might probably conſult ſome other intereſt than his own.

            <p>ALL this violent cry againſt the nobility I take to be a mere work of art. To be honoured and even privileged by the laws, opinions, and inveterate uſages of our country, growing out of the prejudice of ages, has nothing to provoke horror and indignation in any man. Even to be too tenacious of thoſe privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, is not abſolutely a crime. The ſtrong ſtruggle in every individual to preſerve poſſeſſion of what he has found to belong to him and to diſtinguiſh him, is one of the ſecurities againſt injuſtice and deſpotiſm, implanted in our nature. It operates as an inſtinct to ſecure property, and to preſerve communities in a ſettled ſtate. What is there to ſhock in this? Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is a graceful ornament to the civil order. It is the Corinthian capital of poliſhed ſociety. <hi>Omnes boni nobilitati ſemper favemus,</hi> was the ſaying of a wiſe and good man. It is, indeed, one ſign of a liberal and benevolent mind to incline to it with ſome ſort of partial propenſity.

            <head>NATIONAL TIES.</head>
            <p>THE operation of dangerous and deluſive firſt principles obliges us to have recourſe to the true ones. In the intercourſe between nations, we are apt to rely too much on the inſtrumental part. We lay too much weight upon the formality of treaties and compacts. We do not act much more wiſely when we truſt to the intereſt of men as guarantees of their engagements. The intereſts frequently tear to pieces the engagements; and the paſſions trample upon both. Entirely to truſt to either is to diſregard our own ſafety, or not to know mankind. Men are not tied to one another by papers and ſeals. They are led to aſſociate by reſemblances, by conformities, by ſympathies. It is with nations as with individuals.
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0244800202:54"/>
Nothing is ſo ſtrong a tie of amity between nation and nation as correſpondence in laws, cuſtoms, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and habits of life. They have more than the force of treaties in themſelves. They are obligations written in the heart. They approximate men to men, without their knowledge, and ſometimes againſt their intentions. The ſecret, unſeen, but irrefragable bond of habitual intercourſe, holds them together, even when their perverſe and litigious nature ſets them to equivocate, ſcuffle, and ſight about the terms of their written obligations.</p>
            <p>As to war, if it be the means of wrong and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, it is the ſole means of juſtice amongſt nations. Nothing can baniſh it from the world. They who ſay otherwiſe, intending to impoſe upon us, do not impoſe upon themſelves. But it is one of the greateſt objects of human wiſdom to mitigate thoſe evils which we cannot remove. The conformity and analogy of which I ſpeak, incapable, like every thing elſe, of preſerving perfect truſt and tranquillity among men, has a ſtrong tendency to facilitate accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and to produce a generous oblivion of the rancour of their quarrels. With this ſimilitude, peace is more of peace, and war is leſs of war. I will go further. There have been periods of time in which communities, apparently in peace with each other, have been more perfectly ſeparated than, in later times, many nations in Europe have been in the courſe of long and bloody wars. The cauſe muſt be ſought in the ſimilitude in Europe of religion, laws, and manners. At bottom, theſe are all the ſame. The writers on public law have often called this <hi>aggregate</hi> of nations a Commonwealth. They had reaſon. It is virtually one great ſtate having the ſame baſis of general law; with ſome diverſity of provincial cuſtoms and local eſtabliſhments.

            <p>I CONFESS I feel a degree of diſguſt, almoſt leading to deſpair, at the manner in which we are acting in the great exigencies of our country.

The collection of ſixteen millions annually; a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection on which the public greatneſs, ſafety, and credit have their reliance; the whole order of criminal juriſprudence, which holds together ſociety itſelf, have at no time obliged us to call forth ſuch powers; no, nor any thing like them.

ſubverted to favour the execution of that project<note n="*" place="bottom">Appendix, No. 1.</note>. And for what is all this apparatus of buſtle and terror? Is it becauſe any thing ſubſtantial is expected from it? No. The ſtir and buſtle itſelf is the end propoſed. The eye-ſervants of a ſhort-fighted maſter will employ themſelves, not on what is moſt eſſential to his affairs, but on what his neareſt to his ken. Great difficulties have given a juſt value to oeconomy; and our mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the day muſt be an oeconomiſt, whatever it may coſt us. But where is he to exert his talents? At home, to be ſure; for where elſe can he obtain a profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able credit for their exertion? It is nothing to him, whether the object on which he works under our eye be promiſing or not. If he does not obtain any public be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, he may make regulations without end. Thoſe are ſure to pay in preſent expectation, whilſt the effect is at a diſtance, and may be the concern of other times, and other men. On theſe principles he chooſes to ſuppoſe (for he does not pretend more than to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) a naked poſſibility, that he ſhall draw ſome reſource out of crumbs dropped from the trenchers of penury; that ſomething ſhall be laid in ſtore from the ſhort allowance of revenue officers, overloaded with duty, and famiſhed for want of bread; by a reduction from officers who are at this very hour ready to batter the treaſury with what breaks through ſtone walls, for an increaſe of their appointments. From the marrowleſs bones of theſe ſkeleton eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhments, by the uſe of every ſort of cutting, and of every ſort of fretting tool, he flatters himſelf that he may chip and raſp an empirical alimentary powder, to diet into ſome ſimilitude of health and ſubſtance the languiſhing chimeras of fraudulent reformation.</p>
            <p>Whilſt he is thus employed according to his policy and to his taſte, he has not leiſure to enquire into thoſe abuſes in India that are drawing off money by millions from the treaſures of this country, which are exhauſting the vital juices from members of to

            <head>OPINION.</head>
            <p>BUT, ſay ſome, you force opinion. You can never extirpate opinion without extirpating a whole nation. Nay, by purſuing it, you only increaſe its partizans. Opinions are things out of human juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. I have formerly heard this from the mouths of great men, with more ſurprize than ſatisfaction. They alledged as a proof of their doctrine, the wars of Charles the Fifth, and ſome of his ſucceſſors, againſt the reformation.</p>
            <p>It is ſo common, though ſo unreaſonable, it is hardly worth remarking, that no perſons purſue more fiercely with criminal proceſs, and with every kind of coercion, the publication of opinions contrary to their own, than thoſe do, who claim in this reſpect the moſt unbounded latitude to themſelves. If it were not for this inconſiſtency, then war againſt opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions might be juſtified as all others, more or leſs, according to the reaſon of the caſe: for the caſe judged on by moral prudence, and not by any uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal abſtract principle of right, is to guide govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this delicate point.</p>
            <p>As to the mere matter of extirpation of all kinds of opinions, whether right or wrong, without the extirpation of a people, it is a thing ſo very common, that would be clouded and obſcured rather than il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated by examples. Every revolution in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant opinion made by the force of domeſtic legal government, by the force of any uſurpation, by the force of any conqueſt, is a proof to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;—and there is no nation which has not expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced thoſe changes. Inſtances enough may be
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0244800202:59"/>
furniſhed of people who have enthuſiaſtically, and with force, propagated thoſe opinions, which ſome time before they reſiſted with their blood. Rarely have ever great changes in opinion taken place with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the application of force, more or leſs. Like every thing elſe in human life and human affairs, it is not univerſally true, that a perſecution of opinions leſſens or increaſes the number of their votaries. In finding where it may or may not have gathered theſe effects, the ſagacity of government ſhines or is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced, as well as in the time, the manner, the choice of the opinions on which it ought to uſe or forbear the ſword of domeſtic or of foreign juſtice. But it is a falſe maxim, that opinions ought to be indifferent to us, either as men or as a ſtate. Opinion is the rudder of human action; and as the opinion is wiſe or fooliſh, vicious or moral, the cauſe of action is noxious or ſalutary. It has even been the great primary object of ſpeculative and doctrinal philoſophy to regulate opinion. It is the great object of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical philoſophy to promote that which is found; and to extirpate what is miſchievous, and which directly tends to render men bad citizens in the community, and miſchievous neighbours out of it. Opinions are of infinite conſequence. They make the manners—in fact, they make the laws: they make the legiſlator. They are, therefore, of all things, thoſe to which provident government ought to look moſt to in their beginnings. After a time they may look to them in vain. When, therefore, I am told that a war is a war of opinions, I am told that it is the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant of all wars.</p>
            <p>Here I muſt not be told that this would lead to eternal war and perſecution. It would certainly, if we argued like metaphyſicians run mad, who do not correct prudence, the queen of virtues, to be any virtue at all,—and would either throw the bridle on the neck of headlong nature, or tie it up for ever to the poſt. No ſophiſtry—no chicane here. Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

            <p>TO make any thing very terrible, obſcurity ſeems in general to be neceſſary. When we know the full extent of any danger, when we can accuſtom our eyes to it, a great deal of the apprehenſion vaniſhes. Every one will be ſenſible of this, who conſiders how greatly night adds to our dread, in all caſes of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and how much the notions of ghoſts and goblins, of which none can form clear ideas, affect minds which give credit to the popular tales concerning ſuch ſorts of beings. Thoſe deſpotic governments, which are founded on the paſſions of men, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally upon the paſſion of fear, keep their chief as much as may be from the public eye. The policy has been the ſame in many caſes of religion. Almoſt all the heathen temples were dark.

            <head>PROPORTION AND BEAUTY.</head>
            <p>LET us ſee whether proportion can in any ſenſe be conſidered as the cauſe of beauty, as hath been ſo generally, and by ſome ſo confidently affirmed. If proportion be one of the conſtituents of beauty, it muſt derive that power either from ſome natural properties inherent in certain meaſures, which operate mechanically; from the operation of cuſtom; or from the fitneſs which ſome meaſures have to anſwer ſome particular ends of conveniency. Our buſineſs therefore is to enquire, whether the parts of thoſe objects, which are found beautiful in the vegetable or animal kingdoms, are conſtantly ſo formed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſuch certain meaſures, as may ſerve to ſatisfy us that their beauty reſults from thoſe meaſures on the principle of a natural mechanical cauſe; or from cuſtom; or, in fine, from their fitneſs for any deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate purpoſes. I intend to examine this point under each of theſe heads in their order. But before I proceed further, I hope it will not be thought amiſs, if I lay down the rules which governed me in
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0244800202:62"/>
this enquiry, and which have miſſed me in it, if I have gone aſtray. 1. If two bodies produce the ſame or a ſimilar effect on the mind, and on exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation they are found to agree in ſome of their properties, and to differ in others; the common effect is to be attributed to the properties in which they agree, and not to thoſe in which they differ. 2. Not to account for the effect of a natural object from the effect of an artificial object. 3. Not to account for the effect of any natural object from a concluſion of our reaſon concerning its uſes, if a natural cauſe may be aſſigned. 4. Not to admit any determinate quantity, or any relation of quantity, as the cauſe of a certain effect, if the effect is produced by different or oppoſite meaſures and relations; or if theſe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and relations may exiſt, and yet the effect may not be produced. Theſe are the rules which I have chiefly followed, whilſt I examined into the power of proportion conſidered as a natural cauſe; and theſe, if he thinks them juſt, I requeſt the reader to carry with him throughout the following diſcuſſion; whilſt we enquire in the firſt place, in what things we find this quality of beauty; next, to ſee whether in theſe we can find any aſſignable proportions, in ſuch a manner as ought to convince us that our idea of beauty reſults from them. We ſhall conſider this pleaſing power, as it appears in vegetables, in the inferior animals, and in man. Turning our eyes to the vegetable creation, we find nothing there ſo beautiful as flowers; but flowers are almoſt of every ſort of ſhape, and of every ſort of diſpoſition; they are turned and faſhioned into an infinite variety of forms; and from theſe forms botaniſts have given them their names, which are almoſt as various. What proportion do we diſcover between the ſtalks and the leaves of flowers, or between the leaves and the piſtils? How does the ſlender ſtalk of the roſe agree with the bulky head under which it bends? but the roſe is a beautiful flower; and can we undertake
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0244800202:63"/>
to ſay that it does not owe a great deal of its beauty even to that diſproportion? the roſe is a large flower, yet it grows upon a ſmall ſhrub; the flower of the apple is very ſmall, and grows upon a large tree, yet the roſe and the apple bloſſom are both beautiful, and the plants that bear them are moſt engagingly attired, notwithſtanding this diſproportion. What by general conſent is allowed to be a more beautiful object than an orange tree, flouriſhing at once with its leaves, its bloſſoms, and its fruit? but it is in vain that we ſearch here for any propor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

a diſpoſition to think charitably of all the actions of men in power, and to live in a mutual intercourſe of favours with them; an inclination rather to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance a ſtrong uſe of authority, than to bear any ſort of licentiouſneſs on the part of the people; theſe are unfavourable qualities in an open election for members of parliament.</p>
            <p>The inſtinct which carries the people towards the choice of the former, is juſtified by reaſon; becauſe a man of ſuch a character, even in its exorbitancies, does not directly contradict the purpoſes of a truſt, the end of which is a controul on power. The latter character, even when it is not in its extreme, will execute this truſt but very imperfectly; and, if de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viating to the leaſt exceſs, will certainly fruſtrate inſtead of forwarding the purpoſes of a controul on government. But when the houſe of commons was to be new modelled, this principle was not only to be changed but reverſed. Whilſt any errors com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in ſupport of power were left to the law, with every advantage of favourable conſtruction, of miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and finally of pardon; all exceſſes on the ſide of liberty, or in purſuit of popular favour, or in defence of popular rights and privileges, were not only to be puniſhed by the rigour of the known law, but by a <hi>diſcretionary</hi> proceeding which brought on <hi>the loſs of the popular object itſelf.</hi> Popularity was to be rendered, if not directly penal, at leaſt highly dangerous. The favour of the people might lead even to a diſqualification of repreſenting them. Their odium might become ſtrained through the medium of two or three conſtructions, the means of ſitting as the truſtee of all that was dear to them. This is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing the offence in the offending part. Until this time, the opinion of the people, through the power of an aſſembly, ſtill in ſome ſort popular, led to the greateſt honours and emoluments in the gift of the crown. Now the principle is reverſed; and the favour of the court is the only ſure way of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining

and holding thoſe honours which ought to be in the diſpoſal of the people.</p>
            <p>It ſignifies very little how this matter may be quibbled away. Example, the only argument of effect in civil life, demonſtrates the truth of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. Nothing can alter my opinion concerning the pernicious tendency of this example, until I ſee ſome man for his indiſcretion in the ſupport of power, for his violent and intemperate ſervility, rendered incapable of ſitting in parliament. For as it now ſtands, the fault of overſtraining popular qualities, and, irregularly if you pleaſe, aſſerting popular pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, has led to diſqualification; the oppoſite fault never has produced the ſlighteſt puniſhment.

If they have any evil deſign to which there is no ordinary legal power commenſurate, they bring it into parliament. In parliament the whole is executed from the beginning to the end. In parliament the power of obtaining their object is abſolute; and the ſafety in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0244800202:66"/>
perfect; no rules to confine, no after-reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to terrify. Parliament cannot with any great propriety puniſh others, for things in which they themſelves have been accomplices. Thus the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul of parliament upon the executory power is loſt; becauſe parliament is made to partake in every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable act of government. <hi>Impeachment, that great guardian of the purity of the conſtitution, is in danger of being loſt, even to the idea of it.</hi>

            <head>PARLIAMENT (TRIENNIAL AND PLACE BILL.) A triennial Parliament, or a Place Bill, not competent to effect the Ends propoſed by them.</head>
            <p>THE firſt ideas which generally ſuggeſt themſelves, for the cure of parliamentary diſorders, are, to ſhorten the duration of parliaments; and to diſqualify all, or a great number of placemen, from a ſeat in the Houſe of Commons. Whatever efficacy there may be in thoſe remedies, I am ſure, in the preſent ſtate of things, it is impoſſible to apply them. A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration of the right of free election is a preliminary indiſpenſable to every other reformation. What al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations ought afterwards to be made in the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, is a matter of deep and difficult reſearch.</p>
            <p>If I wrote merely to pleaſe the popular palate, it would indeed be as little troubleſome to me as to another, to extol theſe remedies, ſo famous in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, but to which their greateſt admirers have never attempted ſeriouſly to reſort in practice.</p>
            <p>I confeſs that I have no ſort of reliance upon either a triennial Parliament, or a Place Bill. With regard to the former, perhaps it might rather ſerve to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teract than to promote the ends that are propoſed by it. To ſay nothing of the horrible diſorders among the people attending frequent elections, I ſhould be fearful of committing, every three years, the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent gentlemen of the country into a conteſt with
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0244800202:68"/>

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ul view of public proceedings, ſo as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ground his ſpeculations on his experience, muſt have obſerved how prodigiouſly greater the power of Miniſtry is in the firſt and laſt ſeſſion of a parliament, than it is in the intermediate period, when members ſit a little firm on their ſeats. The perſons of the greateſt parliamentary experience, with whom I have converſed, did conſtantly, in canvaſſing the ſate of queſtions, allow ſomething to the Court ſide, upon account of the elections depending or imminent. The evil complained of, if it exiſts in the preſent ſtate of things, would hardly be removed by a trien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial parliament; for, unleſs the influence of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in elections can be entirely taken away, the more frequently they return, the more they will har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſs private independence; the more generally men will be compelled to ſly to the ſettled ſyſtematic in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of Government, and to the reſources of a boundleſs civil liſt. Certainly ſomething may be done, and ought to be done, towards leſſening that influence in elections; and this will be neceſſary upon a plan either of longer or ſhorter duration of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But nothing can ſo perfectly remove the evil, as not to render ſuch contentions, too frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, utterly ruinous, firſt to independence of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and then to independence of ſpirit.</p>
            <p>As I am only giving an opinion on this point, and not at all debating it in adverſe line, I hope I may be excuſed in another obſervation. With great truth I may aver, that I never remember to have talked on this ſubject with any man much converſant with public buſineſs, who conſidered ſhort parliaments as a real improvement of the conſtitution. Gentlemen, warm in a popular cauſe, are ready enough to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute all the declarations of ſuch perſons to corrupt motives. But the habit of affairs, if, on one hand, it tends to corrupt the mind, furniſhes it, on the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0244800202:69"/>
other, with the means of better information. The authority of ſuch perſons will always have ſome weight. It may ſtand upon a <hi>par</hi> with the ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thoſe who are leſs practiſed in buſineſs; and who, with perhaps purer intentions, have not ſo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual means of judging. It is, beſides, an effect of vulgar and puerile malignity to imagine, that every ſtateſman is of courſe corrupt, and that his opinion, upon every conſtitutional point, is ſolely formed upon ſome ſiniſter intereſt.</p>
            <p>The next favourite remedy is a place-bill. The ſame principle guides in both; I mean, the opinion which is entertained by many, of the infallibility of laws and regulations, in the cure of public diſtempers. Without being as unreaſonably doubtful as many are unwiſely confident, I will only ſay, that this alſo is a matter very well worthy of ſerious and mature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection. It is not eaſy to foreſee what the effect would be of diſconnecting with parliament, the greateſt part of thoſe who hold civil employments, and of ſuch mighty and important bodies as the military and naval eſtabliſhments. It were better, perhaps, that they ſhould have a corrupt intereſt in the forms of the conſtitution, than that they ſhould have none at all. This is a queſtion altogether diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the diſqualification of a particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of revenue officers from ſeats in parliament; or, perhaps, of all the lower ſorts of them from votes in elections. In the former caſe, only the few are affected; in the latter, only the inconſiderable. But a great official, a great profeſſional, a great military and naval intereſt, all neceſſarily comprehending many people of the firſt weight, ability, wealth, and ſpirit, has been gradually formed in the kingdom. Theſe new intereſts muſt be let into a ſhare of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, elſe poſſibly they may be inclined to deſtroy thoſe inſtitutions of which they are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to partake.

            <head>POLITY OF THE SEVERAL COUNTRIES OF EUROPE.</head>
            <p>THE whole of the polity and oeconomy of every country in Europe have been derived from the ſame ſources. They were drawn from the old Germanic or Gothic cuſtumary; from the feudal inſtitutions which muſt be conſidered as an emanation from thoſe cuſtoms; and the whole has been improved and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted into ſyſtem and diſcipline by the Roman law. From hence aroſe the ſeveral orders, with or without a Monarch, which are called States in every country; the ſtrong traces of which, where Monarchy predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated, were never wholly extinguiſhed or merged in deſpotiſm. In the few places where Monarchy was caſt off, the ſpirit of European Monarchy was ſtill left. Thoſe countries ſtill contiued countries of States, that is, of claſſes, orders and diſtinctions, ſuch as had before ſubſiſted, or nearly ſo. Indeed the force and form of the inſtitution called States, continued in greater perfection in thoſe republican countries than under Monarchies. From all thoſe ſources aroſe a ſyſtem of manners and of education which was nearly ſimilar in all countries, and which
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0244800202:72"/>
ſoftened, blended, and harmonized the colours of the whole. There was little difference in the form of their Univerſities for the education of their youth, whether with regard to faculties, to ſciences, or to that erudition which is uſed to impart, with liberal morals, a kind of elegance to the mind. From this reſemblance in the modes of intercourſe, and in the whole form and faſhion of life, no citizen of Europe could be altogether an exile in any part of it. There nothing more than a pleaſing variety to recreate and inſtruct the mind; to enrich the imagination; and to meliorate the heart. When a man travelled or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided for health, pleaſure, buſineſs or neceſſity, from his own country, he never felt himſelf quite abroad. My friend, Mr. Wyld, the late profeſſor of law in Edinburgh, a young man of infinite promiſe, and whoſe loſs at this time is ineſtimable, has beautifully applied two lines of Ovid to this unity and diverſity in Europe, before the curſe of the French Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had fallen upon us all.

Such ſaving to the public may prove the worſt mode of robbing it.

merit. There is a time, when the weather-beaten veſſels of the ſtate ought to come into harbour. They muſt at length have a retreat from the malice of rivals, from the perfidy of political friends, and the inconſtancy of the people. Many of the perſons, who in all times have filled the great offices of ſtate, have been younger brothers, who had originally little, if any fortune. Theſe offices do not furniſh the means of amaſſing wealth. There ought to be ſome power in the crown of granting penſions out of the reach of its own caprices. An intail of depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is a bad reward of merit.</p>
            <p>I would, therefore, leave to the crown the poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of conferring ſome favours, which, whilſt they are received as a reward, do not operate as corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. When men receive obligations from the crown through the pious hands of fathers, or of connexions as venerable as the paternal, the dependences which ariſe from thence, are the obligations of gratitude, and not the fetters of ſervility. Such ties originate in virtue, and they promote it. They continue men in thoſe habitudes of friendſhip, thoſe political con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions, and thoſe political principles in which they began life. They are antidotes againſt a corrupt levity, inſtead of cauſes of it. What an unſeemly ſpectacle would it afford, what a diſgrace would it be to the commonwealth that ſuffered ſuch things, to ſee the hopeful ſon of a meritorious miniſter begging his bread at the door of that treaſury, from whence his father diſpenſed the oeconomy of an empire, and promoted the happineſs and glory of his country? Why ſhould he be obliged to proſtrate his honour, and to ſubmit his principles at the levee of ſome proud favourite, ſhouldered and thruſt aſide by every impudent pretender, on the very ſpot where a few days before he ſaw himſelf adored?—obliged to cringe to the author of the calamities of his houſe, and to kiſs the hands that are red with his father's blood?—No, Sir, theſe things are unfit—They are intolerable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:0244800202:75"/>Sir, I ſhall be aſked, why I do not chuſe to deſtroy thoſe offices which are penſions, and appoint penſions under the direct title in their ſtead? I allow, that in ſome caſes it leads to abuſe; to have things appointed for one purpoſe, and applied to another. I have no great objection to ſuch a change: but I do not think it quite prudent for me to propoſe it. If I ſhould take away the preſent eſtabliſhment, the burthen of proof reſts upon me, that ſo many penſions, and no more, and to ſuch an amount each, and no more, are neceſſary for the public ſervice. This is what I can never prove; for it is a thing incapable of defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition. I do not like to take away an object that I think anſwers my purpoſe, in hopes of getting it back again in a better ſhape. People will bear an old eſtabliſhment when its exceſs is corrected, who will revolt at a new one. I do not think theſe office-penſions to be more in number than ſufficient: but on that point the houſe will exerciſe its diſcretion. As to abuſe, I am convinced, that very few truſts in the ordinary courſe of adminiſtration, have admitted leſs abuſe than this. Efficient miniſters have been their own paymaſters. It is true. But their very partiality has operated as a kind of juſtice; and ſtill it was ſervice that was paid. When we look over this exchequer liſt, we find it filled with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendants of the Walpoles, of the Pelhams, of the Townſhends; names to whom this country owes its liberties; and to whom his majeſty owes his crown.

            <p>The bill before you cuts off this ſource of influence. Its deſign and main ſcope is to regulate the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of India upon the principles of a Court of Judicature; and to exclude, as far as human prudence can exclude, all poſſibility of a corrupt partiality, in appointing to office, or ſupporting in office, or co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vering from enquiry and puniſhment, any perſon who has abuſed, or ſhall abuſe his authority. At the Board, as appointed and regulated by this bill, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and puniſhment cannot be ſhifted and reverſed by a whiſper. That commiſſion becomes fatal to cabal, to intrigue, and to ſecret repreſentation, thoſe inſtruments of the ruin of India. He that cuts off the means of premature fortune, and the power of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting it when acquired, ſtrikes a deadly blow at the great fund, the bank, the capital ſtock of Indian in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, which cannot be veſted any where, or in any hands, without moſt dangerous conſequences to the public.—<bibl>

            <head>PROBERT. The famous Hiſtory of the Revenue Adventures of the bold Baron North and the good Knight Probert, upon the Mountains of Venodotia.</head>
            <p>AN attempt was lately made to improve this branch of local influence, (Principality of Wales) and to transfer it to the fund of general corruption. I have on the ſeat behind me, the conſtitution of Mr. John Probert, a knight errant, dubbed by the noble lord in the blue ribbon<note n="*" place="bottom">Lord North.</note>, and ſent to ſearch for revenues and adventures upon the mountains of Wales. The commiſſion is remarkable; and the event not leſs ſo.
The commiſſion ſets forth, that
<q rend="inline">"Upon a report of the <hi>deputy auditor</hi> (for there is a deputy auditor) of the principality of Wales,) it appeared, that his Majeſty's land revenues in the ſaid principality, <hi>are greatly diminiſhed</hi>;"</q>
and

<q rend="inline">"<hi>A beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly account of empty boxes.</hi>"</q> And yet, Sir, you will remark, that this diminution from littleneſs (which ſerves only to prove the infinite diviſibility of matter) was not for want of the tender and officious care (as we ſee) of ſurveyors general, and ſurveyors particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar;
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0244800202:80"/>
of auditors and deputy-auditors; not for want of memorials, and remonſtrances, and reports, and commiſſions, and conſtitutions, and inquiſitions, and penſions.</p>
            <p>Probert, thus armed, and accoutred, and paid, proceeded on his adventure; but he was no ſooner arrived on the confines of Wales, than all Wales was in arms to meet him. That nation is brave, and full of ſpirit.

The rocks poured down their goatherds, and the deep caverns vomited out their miners. Every thing above ground, and every thing under ground, was in arms. In ſhort, Sir, to alight from my Welſh Pegaſus, and to come to level ground; the <hi>preux Chevalier</hi> Probert went to look for revenue, like his maſters upon other occaſions, and like his maſters, he found rebellion. But we were grown cautious by experience. A civil war of paper might end in a more ſerious war; for now remonſtrance met remonſtrance, and memorial was oppoſed to memorial. The wiſe Britons thought it more reaſonable, that the poor, waſted, decrepit revenue of the principality, ſhould die a natural than a violent death. In truth, Sir, the attempt was no leſs an affront upon the underſtanding of that reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able people, than it was an attack on their property. They choſe that their ancient moſs-grown caſtles ſhould moulder into decay, under the ſilent touches of time, and the ſlow formality of an oblivious and drowſy Exchequer, than that they ſhould be battered down all at once by the lively efforts of a penſioned engineer. As it is the fortune of the noble lord to whom the auſpices of this campaign belonged, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to provoke reſiſtance, ſo it is his rule and nature to yield to that reſiſtance <hi>in all caſes whatſoever.</hi>

            <head>POETRY. Its Powers and Province.</head>
            <p>SO little does poetry depend for its effect on the power of raiſing ſenſible images, that I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced it would loſe a very conſiderable part of its energy if this were the neceſſary reſult of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription. Becauſe that union of affecting words, which is the moſt powerful of all poetical inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, would frequently loſe its force along with its propriety and conſiſtency, if the ſenſible images were always excited. There is not perhaps in the whole Aeneid a more grand and laboured paſſage than the deſcription of Vulcan's cavern in Aetna, and the works that are there carried on. Virgil dwells particularly on the formation of the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which he deſcribes unfiniſhed under the ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers of the Cyclops. But what are the principles of this extraordinary compoſition?<q>
                  <l>Tres imbris torti radios, tres nubis aquoſoe</l>
                  <l>Addiderant; rutili tres ignis et alitis auſtri;</l>
                  <l>Fulgores nunc terrificos, ſonitumque, metumque</l>
                  <l>Miſcebant operi, flammiſque ſequacibus iras.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This ſeems to me admirably ſublime; yet if we attend coolly to the kind of ſenſible images which a
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0244800202:82"/>
combination of ideas of this ſort muſt form, the chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meras of madmen cannot appear more wild and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd than ſuch a picture.
<q rend="inline">"<hi>Three rays of twiſted ſhowers, three of watery clouds, three of fire, and three of the winged ſouth wind; then mixed they in the work terrific lightnings, and ſound, and fear, and anger, with purſuing flames.</hi>"</q>
This ſtrange com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is formed into a groſs body; it is hammered by the Cyclops, it is in part poliſhed, and partly continues rough. The truth is, if poetry gives us a noble aſſemblage of words, correſponding to many noble ideas, which are connected by circumſtances of time or place, or related to each other as cauſe and effect, or aſſociated in any natural way, they may be moulded together in any form, and perfectly anſwer their end. The pictureſque connexion is not demanded; becauſe no real picture is formed; nor is the effect of the deſcription at all the leſs upon this account. What is ſaid of Helen by Priam and the old men of his council, is generally thought to give us the higheſt poſſible idea of that fatal beauty.

Here is not one word ſaid of the particulars of her beauty; nothing which can in the leaſt help us to any preciſe idea of her perſon; but yet we are much more touched by this manner of mentioning her than by thoſe long and laboured deſcriptions of Helen, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther handed down by tradition, or formed by fancy, which are to be met with in ſome authors. I am ſure it affects me much more than the minute deſcription which Spencer has given of Belphebe; though I own
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0244800202:83"/>
that there are parts in that deſcription, as there are in all the deſcriptions of that excellent writer, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely fine and poetical. The terrible picture which Lucretius has drawn of religion, in order to diſplay the magnanimity of his philoſophical hero in oppoſing her, is thought to be deſigned with great boldneſs and ſpirit;
<q>
                  <l>Humana ante oculos foedè cum vita jaceret,</l>
                  <l>In terris, oppreſſa gravi ſub religione,</l>

                  <l>Primus Graius homo mortales tollere contra</l>
                  <l>Eſt oculos auſus.—</l>
               </q>
What idea do you derive from ſo excellent a picture? None at all, moſt certainly; neither has the poet ſaid a ſingle word which might in the leaſt ſerve to mark a ſingle limb or feature of the phantom, which he intended to repreſent in all the horrors imagination can conceive. In reality poetry and rhetoric do not ſucceed in exact deſcription ſo well as painting does; their buſineſs is, to affect rather by ſympathy than imitation; to diſplay rather the effect of things on the mind of the ſpeaker, or of others, than to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent a clear idea of the things themſelves. This is their moſt extenſive province, and that in which they ſucceed the beſt.—<bibl>

            <head>PASSIONS. The Rationale of our Paſſions very neceſſary.</head>
            <p>THE more accurately we ſearch into the human mind, the ſtronger traces we every where find of his wiſdom who made it. If a diſcourſe on the uſe of the parts of the body may be conſidered as an hymn to the Creator; the uſe of the paſſions, which are the organs of the mind, cannot be barren of praiſe to him, nor unproductive to ourſelves of that noble and uncommon union of ſcience and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which a contemplation of the works of infinite wiſdom alone can afford to a rational mind; whilſt, referring to him whatever we find of right or good or fair in ourſelves, diſcovering his ſtrength and wiſdom even in our own weakneſs and imperfection, honouring them where we diſcover them clearly, and adoring their profundity where we are loſt in our ſearch, we may be inquiſitive without impertinence, and elevated without pride; we may be admitted, if I may dare to ſay ſo, into the counſels of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty by a conſideration of his works. The eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the mind ought to be the principal end of all our ſtudies, which if they do not in ſome meaſure effect, they are of very little ſervice to us. But, beſides this great purpoſe, a conſideration of the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionale of our paſſions ſeems to me very neceſſary for all who would affect them upon ſolid and ſure principles. It is not enough to know them in general: to affect them after a delicate manner, or to judge properly of any work deſigned to affect them, we ſhould know the exact boundaries of their ſeveral juriſdictions; we ſhould purſue them through all their variety of operations, and pierce into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, and what might appear inacceſſible parts of our nature,
<q>Quod latet arcanâ non enarrabile fibrâ.</q>
Without all this it is poſſible for a man, after a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed manner, ſometimes to ſatisfy his own mind of
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0244800202:86"/>
the truth of his work; but he can never have a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain determinate rule to go by, not can he ever make his propoſitions ſufficiently clear to others. Poets, and orators, and painters, and thoſe who cultivate other branches of the liberal arts, have without this critical knowledge ſucceeded well in their ſeveral provinces, and will ſucceed; as among artificers there are many machines made, and even invented without any exact knowledge of the principles they are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by. It is, I own, not uncommon to be wrong in theory, and right in practice; and we are happy that it is ſo. Men often act right from their feelings, who afterwards reaſon but ill on them from principle; but as it is impoſſible to avoid an attempt at ſuch reaſoning, and equally impoſſible to prevent its having ſome influence on our practice, ſurely it is worth taking ſome pains to have it juſt, and founded on the baſis of ſure experience. We might expect that the artiſts themſelves would have been our ſureſt guides; but the artiſts have been too much occupied in the practice: the philoſophers have done little; and what they have done, was moſtly with a view to their own ſchemes and ſyſtems: and as for thoſe called critics, they have generally ſought the rule of the arts in the wrong place; they ſought it among poems, pictures, engravings, ſtatues, and buildings. But art can never give the rules that make an art. This is, I believe, the reaſon why artiſts in general, and poets principally, have been confined in ſo narrow a circle; they have been rather imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of one another than of nature; and this with ſo faithful an uniformity, and to ſo remote an antiquity, that it is h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>d to ſay who gave the firſt model. Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics follow them, and therefore can do little as guides. I can judge but poorly of any thing, whilſt I mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure it by no other ſtandard than itſelf. The true ſtandard of the arts is in every man's power; and an eaſy obſervation of the moſt common, ſometimes of the meaneſt things in nature, will give the trueſt
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0244800202:87"/>
lights, where the greateſt ſagacity and induſtry that ſlights ſuch obſervation, muſt leave us in the dark, or, what is worſe, amuſe and miſlead us by falſe lights. In an enquiry it is almoſt every thing to be once in a right road. I am ſatisfied I have done but little by theſe obſervations conſidered in themſelves; and I never ſhould have taken the pains to digeſt them, much leſs ſhould I have ever ventured to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh them, if I was not convinced that nothing tends more to the corruption of ſcience than to ſuffer it to ſlagnate. Theſe waters muſt be troubled before they can exert their virtues.

            <p>NOTHING is a due and adequate repreſentation of a ſtate, that does not repreſent its ability, as well as its property. But as ability is a vigorous and active principle, and as property is ſluggiſh, inert, and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid, it never can be ſafe from the invaſions of ability, unleſs it be, out of all proportion, predominant in the repreſentation. It muſt be repreſented too in great maſſes of accumulation, or it is not rightly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected. The characteriſtic eſſence of property, formed out of the combined principles of its acquiſition and conſervation, is to be <hi>unequal.</hi> The great maſſes, therefore, which excite envy, and tempt rapacity,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0244800202:89"/>
muſt be put out of the poſſibility of danger. Then they form a natural rampart about the leſſer proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in all their gradations. The ſame quantity of property, which is by the natural courſe of things di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided among many, has not the ſame operation. Its defenſive power is weakened as it is diffuſed. In this diffuſion each man's portion is leſs than what, in the eagerneſs of his deſires, he may flatter himſelf to obtain by diſſipating the accumulations of others.—The plunder of the few would indeed give but a ſhare inconceivably ſmall in the diſtribution to the many. But the many are not capable of making this calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and thoſe who lead them to rapine, never intend this diſtribution.</p>
            <p>The power of perpetuating our property in our families, is one of the moſt valuable and intereſting circumſtances belonging to it, and that which tends the moſt to the perpetuation of ſociety itſelf. It makes our weakneſs ſubſervient to our virtue; it grafts benevolence even upon avarice. The poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors of family wealth, and of the diſtinction which attends hereditary poſſeſſion, (as moſt concerned in it) are the natural ſecurities for this tranſmiſſion.—With us, the Houſe of Peers is formed upon this principle. It is wholly compoſed of hereditary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty and hereditary diſtinction; and made therefore the third of the Legiſlature; and in the laſt event, the ſole judge of all property in all its ſubdiviſions. The Houſe of Commons too, though not neceſſarily, yet in fact is always ſo compoſed in the far greater part. Let thoſe large proprietors be what they will, and they have their chance of being among the beſt, they are at the very worſt, the ballaſt in the veſſel of the commonwealth. For though hereditary wealth, and the rank which goes with it, are too much idolized by creeping ſycophants, and the blind abject admirers of power, they are too raſhly ſlighted in ſhallow ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations of the petulant, aſſuming, ſhort-ſighted cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combs of philoſophy.

But in what manner was this chaos brought into order? The means were as ſtriking to the imagination, as ſatisfactory to the reaſon, and ſoothing to the moral ſentiments. In contemplating that change, humanity has every thing to rejoice and to glory in; nothing to be aſhamed of, nothing to ſuffer. So far as it has gone, it probably is the moſt pure and defecated public good which has ever been conferred on mankind. We have ſeen anarchy and ſervitude at once removed; a throne ſtrengthened for the protection of the people, without trenching on their liberties; all foreign cabal baniſhed, by changing the crown from elective to hereditary; and what was a matter of pleaſing wonder, we have ſeen a reigning king, from an heroic love to his country, exerting himſelf with all the toil, the dexterity, the management, the intrigue, in favour of a family of ſtrangers, with which ambitious men labour for the aggrandiſement of their own. Ten millions of men

Every thing was kept in its place and order; but in that place and order every thing was bettered. To add to this happy wonder, this unheard of conjunction of wiſdom and fortune, not one drop of blood was ſpilled; no treachery; no outrage; no ſyſtem of ſlander, more cruel than the ſword; no ſtudied inſults on religion, morals, or manners; no ſpoil; no confiſcation; no citizen beggared; none impriſoned; none exiled: the whole was effected with a policy, a diſcretion, an unanimity and ſecreſy, ſuch as have never been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore known on any occaſion; but ſuch wonderful conduct was reſerved for this glorious conſpiracy in favour of the true and genuine rights and intereſts of men.

            <p>THEY (the French faction) cannot pretend that France had ſtood ſo much in need of a change as Poland.

Both revolutions profeſs liberty as their object; but in obtaining this object the one proceeds from anarchy to order: the other from order to anarchy.

            <head>POWER. Always accompanied by Terror.</head>
            <p>I KNOW ſome people are of opinion, that no awe, no degree of terror, accompanies the idea of power; and have hazarded to affirm, that we can contemplate the idea of God himſelf, without any ſuch emotion. I purpoſely avoided, when I firſt conſidered this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, to introduce the idea of that great and tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous Being, as an example in an argument ſo light as this; though it frequently occurred to me, not as an objection to, but as a ſtrong confirmation of, my notions in this matter. I hope, in what I am going to ſay, I ſhall avoid preſumption, where it is almoſt impoſſible for any mortal to ſpeak with ſtrict propriety. I ſay then, that whilſt we conſider the Godhead merely as he is an object of the underſtanding, which forms a complex idea of power, wiſdom, juſtice, goodneſs, all ſtretched to a degree far exceeding the bounds of our comprehenſion, whilſt we conſider the Divinity in this refined and abſtracted light, the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination and paſſions are little or nothing affected. But becauſe we are bound, by the condition of our nature, to aſcend to theſe pure and intellectual ideas, through the medium of ſenſible images, and to judge of theſe divine qualities by their evident acts and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions, it becomes extremely hard to diſentangle our
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0244800202:94"/>
idea of the cauſe from the effect by which we are led to know it. Thus when we contemplate the Deity, his attributes and their operation coming united on the mind, form a ſort of ſenſible image, and as ſuch are capable of affecting the imagination. Now, though in a juſt idea of the Deity, perhaps none of his attributes are predominant, yet to our imagination, his power is by far the moſt ſtriking. Some reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſome comparing, is neceſſary to ſatisfy us of his wiſdom, his juſtice, and his goodneſs. To be ſtruck with his power, it is only neceſſary that we ſhould open our eyes. But whilſt we contemplate ſo vaſt an object, under the arm, as it were, of almighty power, and inveſted upon every ſide with omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, we ſhrink into the minuteneſs of our own nature, and are, in a manner, annihilated before him. And though a conſideration of his other attributes may relieve in ſome meaſure our apprehenſions; yet no conviction of the juſtice with which it is exerciſed, nor the mercy with which it is tempered, can wholly remove the terror that naturally ariſes from a force which nothing can withſtand. If we rejoice, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice with trembling; and even whilſt we are receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing benefits, we cannot but ſhudder at a power which can confer benefits of ſuch mighty importance.—When the prophet David contemplated the wonders of wiſdom and power which are diſplayed in the oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy of man, he ſeems to be ſtruck with a ſort of divine horror, and cries out, <hi>Fearfully and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully am I made!</hi> An heathen poet has a ſentiment of a ſimilar nature; Horace looks upon it as the laſt effort of philoſophical fortitude, to behold without terror and amazement, this immenſe and glorious fabric of the univerſe:
<q>
                  <l>Hunc ſolem, et ſtellas, et decedentia certis</l>
                  <l>Tempora momentis, ſunt qui ſormidine nulla</l>
                  <l>Imbuti ſpectant.</l>
               </q>
Lucretius is a poet not to be ſuſpected of giving way to ſuperſtitious terrors; yet when he ſuppoſes the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0244800202:95"/>
whole mechaniſm of nature laid open by the maſter of his philoſophy, his tranſport on this magnificent view, which he has repreſented in the colours of ſuch bold and lively poetry, is overcaſt with a ſhade of ſecret dread and horror:
<q>
                  <l>His tibi me rebus quoedam divina voluptas</l>
                  <l>Percipit, atque horror, quod ſic Natura tua vi</l>
                  <l>Tam maniſeſla palet ex omni parte retecta.</l>
               </q>
But the ſcripture alone can ſupply ideas anſwerable to the majeſty of this ſubject. In the ſcripture, wherever God is repreſented as appearing or ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, every thing terrible in nature is called up to heighten the awe and ſolemnity of the divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. The pſalms, and the prophetical books, are crowded with inſtances of this kind. <hi>The earth ſhook</hi> (ſays the pſalmiſt), <hi>the heavens alſo dropped at the preſence of the Lord.</hi> And what is remarkable, the painting preſerves the ſame character, not only when he is ſuppoſed deſcending to take vengeance upon the wicked, but even when he exerts the like pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of power in acts of beneficence to mankind. <hi>Tremble thou earth! at the preſence of the Lord; at the preſence of the God of Jacob; which turned the rock into ſtanding water, the ſlint vnto a fountain of waters!</hi> It were endleſs to enumerate all the paſſages, both in the ſacred and profane writers, which eſtabliſh the general ſentiment of mankind, concerning the inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable union of a ſacred and reverential awe, with our ideas of the divinity. Hence the common maxim, <hi>Primos in orbe deos fecit timor.</hi> This maxim may be, as I believe it is, falſe with regard to the origin of religion. The maker of the maxim ſaw how inſeparable theſe ideas were, without conſidering that the notion of ſome great power muſt be always precedent to our dread of it. But this dread muſt neceſſarily follow the idea of ſuch a power, when it is once excited in the mind. It is on this principle
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0244800202:96"/>
that true religion has, and muſt have, ſo large a mixture of ſalutary fear; and that falſe religions have generally nothing elſe but fear to ſupport them. Before the chriſtian religion had, as it were, human<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized the idea of the Divinity, and brought it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what nearer to us, there was very little ſaid of the love of God. The followers of Plato have ſomething of it, and only ſomething; the other writers of pagan antiquity, whether poets or philoſophers, nothing at all. And they who conſider with what infinite at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, by what a diſregard of every periſhable object, through what long habits of piety and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation it is, any man is able to attain an entire love and devotion to the Deity, will eaſily perceive, that it is not the firſt, the moſt natural, and the moſt ſtriking effect which proceeds from that idea. Thus we have traced power through its ſeveral gradations unto the higheſt of all, where our imagination is finally loſt; and we find terror, quite throughout the progreſs, its inſeparable companion, and growing along with it, as far as we can poſſibly trace them. Now, as power is undoubtedly a capital ſource of the ſublime, this will point out evidently from whence its energy is derived, and to what claſs of ideas we ought to unite it.—<bibl>

            <p>WITHOUT their principles, perhaps without any principles at all, they played the game of the Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins. There was a beaten road before them. The Powers of Europe were armed; France had always appeared dangerous; the war was eaſily diverted from France as a faction, to France as a ſtate. The Princes were eaſily taught to ſlide back into their old habitual courſe of politics. They were eaſily led to conſider the flames that were conſuming France, not as a warning to protect their own buildings, (which were without any party wall, and linked by a contig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation into the edifice of France) as an happy occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the pillaging the goods, and for carrying off the materials of their neighbour's houſe. Their provident fears were changed into avaricious hopes. They carried on their new deſigns without ſeeming to abandon the principles of their old policy. They pretended to ſeek, or they flattered themſelves that they ſought, in the acceſſion of new fortreſſes, and new territories, a <hi>defenſive</hi> ſecurity. But the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity wanted was againſt a kind of power, which was not dangerous in its fortreſſes nor in it's territories, but in it's ſpirit and it's principles. They aimed, or pretended to aim, at <hi>deſending</hi> themſelves againſt a danger, from which there can be no ſecurity in any <hi>defenſive</hi> plan. If armies and fortreſſes were a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt Jacobiniſm, Louis the Sixteenth would this day reign a powerful monarch over an happy people.</p>
            <p>This error obliged them, even in their offenſive operations, to adopt a plan of war againſt the ſucceſs of which there was ſomething little ſhort of mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical demonſtration. They refuſed to take any ſtep which might ſtrike at the heart of affairs. They ſeemed unwilling to wound the enemy in any vital

part. They acted through the whole, as if they really wiſhed the conſervation of the Jacobin power; as what might be more favourable than the lawful Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to the attainment of the petty objects they looked for. They always kept on the circumfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and the wider and remoter the circle was, the more eagerly they choſe as their ſphere of action. The plan they purſued, in it's nature, demanded great length of time. In it's execution they who went the neareſt way to work were obliged to cover an incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible extent of country. It leſt to the enemy every means of deſtroying this extended line of weakneſs. Ill ſucceſs in any part was ſure to defeat the effect of the whole. This is true of Auſtria. It is ſtill more true of England. On this falſe plan, even good fortune, by further weakening the victor, put him but the further off from his object.</p>
            <p>As long as there was any appearance of ſucceſs, the ſpirit of aggrandizement, and conſequently the ſpirit of mutual jealouſy ſeized upon all the coaleſeed Powers. Some ſought an acceſſion of territory at the expence of France, ſome at the expence of each other, ſome at the expence of third parties; and when the viciſſitude of diſaſter took it's turn, they found common diſtreſs a treacherous bond of faith and friendſhip.—<bibl>

However, if in general it be not eaſy to determine concerning the lawfulneſs of ſuch devious proceedings, which muſt be ever on the edge of crimes, it is far from difficult to foreſee the perilous conſequences of the reſuſcitation of ſuch a power in the people. The practical conſequences of any political tenet go a great way in deciding upon its value. Political pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems do not primarily concern truth or falſehood. They relate to good or evil. What in the reſult is likely to produce evil, is politically falſe: that which is productive of good, politically is true.</p>
            <p>Believing it therefore a queſtion at leaſt arduous in the theory, and in the practice very critical, it would become us to aſcertain, as well as we can, what form it is that our incantations are about to call up from darkneſs and the ſleep of ages. When the ſupreme authority of the people is in queſtion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we attempt to extend or to confine it, we ought to fix in our minds, with ſome degree of diſtinctneſs, an idea of what it is we mean when we ſay the PEOPLE.</p>
            <p>In a ſtate of <hi>rude</hi> nature there is no ſuch thing as a people. A number of men in themſelves have no collective capacity. The idea of a people is the idea of a corporation. It is wholly artificial; and made like all other legal fictions by common agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. What the particular nature of that agreement was, is collected from the form into which the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſociety has been caſt. Any other is not <hi>their</hi> covenant. When men, therefore, break up the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal compact or agreement which gives its corporate form and capacity to a ſtate, they are no longer a people; they have no longer a corporate exiſtence; they have no longer a legal coactive force to bind within, nor a claim to be recognized abroad. They are a number of vague looſe individuals, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more. With them all is to begin again. Alas! they little know how many a weary ſtep is to be taken
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0244800202:100"/>
before they can form themſelves into a maſs, which has a true politic perſonality.</p>
            <p>We hear much from men, who have not acquired their hardineſs of aſſertion from the proſundity of their thinking, about the omnipotence of a <hi>majority,</hi> in ſuch a diſſolution of an antient ſociety as hath taken place in France. But amongſt men ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded, there can be no ſuch thing as majority or minority; or power in any one perſon to bind an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. The power of acting by a majority, which the gentlemen theoriſts ſeem to aſſume ſo readily, after they have violated the contract out of which it has ariſen, (if at all it exiſted) muſt be grounded on two aſſumptions; firſt, that of an incorporation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by unanimity; and ſecondly, an unanimous agreement, that the act of a mere majority (ſay of one) ſhall paſs with them and with others as the act of the whole.</p>
            <p>We are ſo little affected by things which are ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual, that we conſider this idea of the deciſion of a <hi>majority</hi> as if it were a law of our original nature: but ſuch conſtructive whole, reſiding in a part only, is one of the moſt violent fictions of poſitive law, that ever has been or can be made on the principles of artificial incorporation. Out of civil ſociety nature knows nothing of it; nor are men, even when ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranged according to civil order, otherwiſe than by very long training, brought at all to ſubmit to it. The mind is brought far more eaſily to acquieſce in the proceedings of one man, or a few, who act under a general procuration for the ſtate, than in the vote of a victorious majority in councils in which every man has his ſhare in the deliberation. For there the beaten party are exaſperated and ſoured by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious contention, and mortified by the concluſive defeat. This mode of deciſion, where wills may be ſo nearly equal, where, according to circumſtances, the ſmaller number may be the ſtronger force, and where apparent reaſon may be all upon one ſide,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:0244800202:101"/>
and on the other little elſe than impetuous appetite; all this muſt be the reſult of a very particular and ſpecial convention, confirmed afterwards by long habits of obedience, by a ſort of diſcipline in ſociety, and by a ſtrong hand, veſted with ſtationary perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent power, to enforce this ſort of conſtructive ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral will. What organ it is that ſhall declare the corporate mind is ſo much a matter of poſitive ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement, that ſeveral ſtates, for the validity of ſeveral of their acts, have required a proportion of voices much greater than that of a mere majority.—Theſe proportions are ſo entirely governed by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, that in ſome caſes the minority decides. The laws in many countries to <hi>condemn</hi> require more than a mere majority; leſs than an equal number to <hi>acquit.</hi> In our judicial trials we require unanimity either to condemn or to abſolve. In ſome incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations one man ſpeaks for the whole; in others, a few. Until the other day, in the conſtitution of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, unanimity was required to give validity to any act of their great national council or diet. This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches much more nearly to rude nature than the inſtitutions of any other country. Such, indeed, every commonwealth muſt be, without a poſitive law to recognize in a certain number the will of the entire body.</p>
            <p>If men diſſolve their ancient incorporation, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to regenerate their community, in that ſtate of things each man has a right, if he pleaſes, to remain an individual. Any number of individuals, who can agree upon it, have an undoubted right to form themſelves into a ſtate apart and wholly independent. If any of theſe is forced into the fellowſhip of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, this is conqueſt and not compact. On every principle, which ſuppoſes ſociety to be in virtue of a free covenant, this compulſive incorporation muſt be null and void.</p>
            <p>As a people can have no right to a corporate ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity without univerſal conſent, ſo neither have they
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0244800202:102"/>
a right to hold excluſively any lands in the name and title of a corporation. On the ſcheme of the preſent rulers in our neighbouring country, regenerated as they are, they have no more right to the territory called France than I have. I have a right to pitch my tent in any unoccupied place I can find for it; and I may apply to my own maintenance any part of their unoccupied ſoil. I may purchaſe the houſe or vineyard of any individual proprietor who refuſes his conſent (and moſt proprietors have, as far as they dared, refuſed it) to the new incorporation. I ſtand in his independent place. Who are theſe inſolent men calling themſelves the French nation, that would monopolize this fair domain of nature? Is it becauſe they ſpeak a certain jargon? Is it their mode of chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, to me unintelligible, that forms their title to my land? Who are they who claim by preſcription and deſcent from certain gangs of banditti called Franks, and Burgundians, and Viſigoths, of whom I may have never heard, and ninety-nine out of an hundred of themſelves certainly never have heard; whilſt at the very time they tell me, that preſcription and long poſſeſſion form no title to property? Who are they that preſume to aſſert that the land which I purchaſed of the individual, a natural perſon, and not a f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

This mode of arguing might be puſhed into all the detail, ſo as to leave no ſort of doubt, that on their principles, and on the ſort of footing on which they have thought proper to place themſelves, the crowd of men, on the other ſide of the channel, who have the impudence to call themſelves a people, can never be the lawful excluſive poſſeſſors of the ſoil. By what they call reaſoning without prejudice, they leave not one ſtone upon another in the fabric of human ſociety. They ſubvert all the authority which they hold, as well as

<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0244800202:107"/>
other ſources of faction, combining parties among the inhabitants of different countries into one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion, are opened, and that from theſe ſources are likely to ariſe effects full as important as thoſe which had formerly ariſen from the jarring intereſts of the religious ſects. The intention of the ſeveral actors in the change in France, is not a matter of doubt. It is very openly profeſſed.</p>
            <p>In the modern world, before this time, there has been no inſtance of this ſpirit of general political faction, ſeparated from religion, pervading ſeveral countries, and forming a principle of union between the partizans in each. But the thing is not leſs in human nature. The ancient world has furniſhed a ſtrong and ſtriking inſtance of ſuch a ground for faction, full as powerful, and full as miſchievous as our ſpirit of religious ſyſtem had ever been, exciting in all the ſtates of Greece (European and Aſiatic) the moſt violent animoſities, and the moſt cruel and bloody perſecutions and proſcriptions. Theſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient factions in each commonwealth of Greece, connected themſelves with thoſe of the ſame deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in ſome other States; and ſecret cabals and public alliances were carried on and made, not upon a conformity of general political intereſts, but for the ſupport and aggrandizement of the two leading ſtates which headed the ariſtocratic and democratic factions. For, as in later times, the King of Spain was at the head of a catholic, and the King of Sweden of a proteſtant intereſt, France, (though catholic, acting ſubordinately to the latter,) in the like manner the Lacedemonians were every where at the head of the ariſtocratic intereſts, and the Athenians of the demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratic. The two leading powers kept alive a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant cabal and conſpiracy in every ſtate, and the political dogmas concerning the conſtitution of a republic, were the great inſtruments by which theſe leading States choſe to aggrandize themſelves. Their choice was not unwiſe; becauſe the intereſt in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:0244800202:108"/>
(merely as opinions, and without any experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental reference to their effects) when once they take ſtrong hold of the mind, become the moſt ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative of all intereſts, and indeed very often ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede every other.</p>
            <p>I might further exemplify the poſſibility of a poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical ſentiment running through various ſtates and combining factions in them, from the hiſtory of the middle ages in the Guelfs and Ghibellines. Theſe were political factions originally in favour of the Emperor and the Pope, with no mixture of religious doginas; or if any thing religiouſly doctrinal they had in them originally, it very ſoon diſappeared; as their firſt political objects diſappeared alſo, though the ſpirit remained. They became no more than names to diſtinguiſh factions; but they were not the leſs powerful in their operation, when they had no direct point of doctrine, either religious or civil, to aſſert. For a long time, however, thoſe factions gave no ſmall degree of influence to the foreign chiefs in every commonwealth in which they exiſted. I do not mean to purſue further the track of theſe parties. I allude to this part of hiſtory only, as it furniſhes an inſtance of that ſpecies of faction which broke the locality of public affections, and united deſcriptions of citizens more with ſtrangers than with their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen of different opinions.—<bibl>

            <p>MERE parſimony is not oeconomy. It is ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in theory from it; and in fact it may, or it may
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0244800202:110"/>
not, be a <hi>part</hi> of oeconomy, according to circum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtances. Expence, and great expence, may be an eſſential part in true oeconomy. If parſimony were to be conſidered as one of the kinds of that virtue, there is, however, another and an higher oeconomy Oeconomy is a diſtributive virtue, and conſiſts not in ſaving, but in ſelection. Parſimony requires no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, no ſagacity, no powers of combination, no compariſon, no judgment. Meer inſtinct, and that not an inſtinct of the nobleſt kind, may produce this falſe oeconomy in perfection. The other oeconomy has larger views. It demands a diſcriminating judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a firm ſagacious mind. It ſhuts one door to impudent importunity, only to open another, and a wider, to unpreſuming merit. If none but meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious ſervice or real talent were to be rewarded, this nation has not wanted, and this nation will not want, the means of rewarding all the ſervice it ever will receive, and encouraging all the merit it ever will produce. No ſtate, ſince the foundation of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, has been impoveriſhed by that ſpecies of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.—<bibl>

            <head>PROFESSORS OF ARTIFICIAL LAW. (SEE LAW.)</head>
            <p>THE profeſſors of artificial law have always walked hand in hand with the profeſſors of artificial theology. As their end, in confounding the reaſon of man, and abridging his natural freedom, is exactly the ſame, they have adjuſted the means to that end in a way entirely ſimilar. The divine thunders out his <hi>ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themas</hi> with more noiſe and terror againſt the breach of one of his poſitive inſtitutions, or the neglect of ſome of his trivial forms, than againſt the neglect or breach of thoſe duties and commandments of natural religion, which by theſe forms and inſtitutions he pretends to enforce. The lawyer has his forms, and his poſitive inſtitutions too, and he adheres to them
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0244800202:111"/>
with a veneration altogether as religious. The worſt cauſe cannot be ſo prejudicial to the litigant, as his advocate's or attorney's ignorance or neglect of theſe forms. A law-ſuit is like an ill-managed diſpute, in which the firſt object is ſoon out of ſight, and the parties end upon a matter wholly foreign to that on which they began. In a law-ſuit the queſtion is, who has a right to a certain houſe or farm? And this queſtion is daily determined, not upon the evidences of the right, but upon the obſervance or neglect of ſome forms of words in uſe with the gentlemen of the robe, about which there is even amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſuch a diſagreement, that the moſt experienced veterans in the profeſſion can never be poſitively aſſured that they are not miſtaken.</p>
            <p>Let us expoſtulate with theſe learned ſages, theſe prieſts of the ſacred temple of juſtice. Are we judges of our own property? By no means. You then, who are initiated into the myſteries of the blindfold goddeſs, inform me whether I have a right to eat the bread I have earned by the hazard of my life, or the ſweat of my brow? The grave doctor anſwers me in the affirmative. The reverend ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant replies in the negative; the learned barriſter reaſons upon one ſide and upon the other, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes nothing. What ſhall I do? An antagoniſt ſtarts up and preſſes me hard. I enter the field, and retain theſe three perſons to defend my cauſe. My cauſe, which two farmers from the plough could have decided in half an hour, takes the court twenty years. I am, however, at the end of my labour, and have, in reward for all my toil and vexation, a judgment in my favour. But hold—a ſagacious commander, in the adverſary's army has found a ſlaw in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding. My triumph is turned into mourning. I have uſed <hi>or</hi> inſtead of <hi>and,</hi> or ſome miſtake, ſmall in appearance, but dreadful in its conſequences, and have the whole of my ſucceſs quaſhed in a writ of error. I remove my ſuit; I ſhift from court to
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0244800202:112"/>
court; I fly from equity to law, and from law to equity; equal uncertainty attends me every where: and a miſtake in which I had no ſhare, decides at once upon my liberty and property, ſending me from the court to a priſon, and adjudging my family to beggary and famine. I am innocent, gentlemen, of the darkneſs and uncertainty of your ſcience. I never darkened it with abſurd and contradictory notions, nor confounded it with chicane and ſophiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. You have excluded me from my having any ſhare in the conduct of my own cauſe; the ſcience was too deep for me; I acknowledged it; but it was too deep even for yourſelves; you have made the way ſo intricate, that you are yourſelves loſt in it. You err, and you puniſh me for your errors.—<bibl>

            <head>PRUSSIA AND THE EMPEROR.</head>
            <p>IF the two great leading Powers of Germany do not regard this danger<note n="*" place="bottom">French Revolution.</note>, (as apparently they do not) in the light in which it preſents itſelf ſo naturally, it is becauſe they are powers too great to have a ſocial intereſt. That ſort of intereſt belongs only to thoſe, whoſe ſtate of weakneſs or mediocrity is ſuch, as to give them greater cauſe of apprehenſion from what may deſtroy them, than of hope from any thing by which they may be aggrandized.</p>
            <p>As long as thoſe two Princes are at variance, ſo long the liberties of Germany are ſafe. But if ever they ſhould ſo far underſtand one another as to be perſuaded that they have a more direct and more certainly defined intereſt in a proportioned mutual aggrandizement than in a reciprocal reduction, that is, if they come to think that they are more likely to be enriched by a diviſion of ſpoil, than to be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſecure by keeping to the old policy of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:0244800202:113"/>
others from being ſpoiled by either of them, from that moment the liberties of Germany are no more.</p>
            <p>That a junction of two in ſuch a ſcheme is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impoſſible nor improbable, is evident from the partition of Poland in 1773, which was effected by ſuch a junction as made the interpoſition of other nations to prevent it, not eaſy. Their circumſtances, at that time, hindered any other three ſtates, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed any two, from taking meaſures in common to prevent it, though France was at that time an exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power, and had not yet learned to act upon a ſyſtem of politics of her own invention. The geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphical poſition of Poland was a great obſtacle to any movements of France in oppoſition to this, at that time unparalleled league. To my certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, if Great Britain had, at that time, been willing to concur in preventing the execution of a project ſo dangerous in the example, even exhauſted as France then was by the preceding war, and under a lazy and unenterpriſing Prince, ſhe would have at every riſque taken an active part in this buſineſs. But a languor with regard to ſo remote an intereſt, and the principles and paſſions which were then ſtrongly at work at home, were the cauſes why Great Britain would not give France any encouragement in ſuch an enterprize. At that time, however, and with regard to that object, in my opinion, Great Britain and France had a common intereſt.</p>
            <p>But the poſition of Germany is not like that of Poland, with regard to France, either for good or for evil. If a conjunction between Pruſſia and the Emperor ſhould be formed for the purpoſe of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lariſing and rendering hereditary the Eccleſiaſtical Electorates and the Biſhopric of Munſter, for ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling two of them on the children of the Emperor, and uniting Cologne and Munſter to the dominions of the King of Pruſſia on the Rhine; or if any other project of mutual aggrandizement ſhould be in proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0244800202:114"/>
and that to facilitate ſuch a ſcheme, the modern French ſhould be permitted and encouraged to ſhake the internal and external ſecurity of theſe Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Electorates, Great Britain is ſo ſituated that ſhe could not, with any effect, ſet herſelf in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to ſuch a deſign.

            <head>PRESCRIPTION (THE SACRED RULES OF).</head>
            <p>THE Crown has conſidered me after long ſervice: the Crown has paid the Duke of Bedford by advance. He has had a long credit for any ſervice which he may perform hereafter. He is ſecure, and long may he be ſecure, in his advance, whether he performs any ſervices or not. But let him take care how he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangers the ſafety of that conſtitution which ſecures his own utility, or his own inſignificance; or how he diſcourages thoſe who take up, even puny arms, to defend an order of things, which, like the ſun of Heaven, ſhines alike on the uſeful and the worthleſs. His grants are engrafted on the public law of Europe, covered with the awful hoar of innumerable ages. They are guarded by the ſacred rules of preſcription, found in that full treaſury of juriſprudence from which the jejuneneſs and penury of our municipal law has, by degrees, been enriched and ſtrengthened.

The Duke of Bedford will ſtand as long as preſcriptive law endures; as long as the great ſtable laws of property, common to us with all civilized nations, are kept in their integrity, and without the ſmalleſt intermixture of the laws, maxims, principles, or precedents of the grand revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. They are ſecure againſt all changes but one. The whole revolutionary ſyſtem, inſtitutes, digeſt, code, novels, text, gloſs, comment, are not only not the ſame, but they are the very reverſe, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe fundamentally, of all the laws on which civil life has hitherto been upheld in all the governments of the world. The learned profeſſors of the Rights of Man regard preſcription, not as a title to bar all claim, ſet up againſt old poſſeſſion, but they look on preſcription as itſelf a bar againſt the poſſeſſor and proprietor. They hold an immemorial poſſeſſion to be no more than a long continued, and therefore an aggravated injuſtice.</p>

            <head>REVOLUTION (FRENCH.) State of France in 1793.</head>
            <p>THE State of France is perfectly ſimple. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of but two deſcriptions—the Oppreſſors and the Oppreſſed.</p>
            <p>The firſt have the whole authority of the State in their hands, all the arms, all the revenues of the public, all the confiſcations of individuals and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations. They have taken the lower ſort from their occupations, and have put them into pay, that they may form them into a body of Janiſaries to overrule and awe property. The heads of theſe wretches they never ſuffer to cool. They ſupply them with a food for fury varied by the day—beſides the ſenſual ſtate of intoxication from which they are rarely free. They have made the prieſts and people formally abjure the divinity: they have eſtranged them from every civil, moral, and ſocial, or even natural and inſtinctive ſentiment, habit, and practice, and have rendered them ſyſtematically ſavages, to make it impoſſible for them to be the inſtruments of any ſober and virtuous arrangement, or to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to any ſtate of order, under any name what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
            <p>The other deſcription, <hi>the Oppreſſed</hi>—are people of ſome property; they are the ſmall reliques of the perſecuted Landed Intereſt; they are the burghers and the farmers. By the very circumſtance of their being of ſome property, though numerous in ſome points of view, they cannot be very conſiderable as a <hi>number.</hi> In cities the nature of their occupations renders them domeſtic and feeble; in the country it confines them to their farm for ſubſiſtence. The National Guards are all changed and reformed. Every thing ſuſpicious in the deſcription of which they were compoſed, is rigourouſly diſarmed. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:0244800202:120"/>
called of Vigilance and Safety, are every where formed; a moſt ſevere and ſcrutinizing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, far more rigid than any thing ever known or imagined. Two perſons cannot meet and confer without hazard to their liberty, and even to their lives. Numbers ſcarcely credible have been exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, and their property confiſcated. At Paris, and in moſt other towns, the bread they buy is a daily dole—which they cannot obtain without a daily ticket delivered to them by their Maſters. Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of all ages and ſexes are actually impriſoned. I have reaſon to believe, that in France there are not, for various ſtate crimes, ſo few as twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand<note n="*" place="bottom">Some accounts make them five times as many.</note> actually in jail—a large portion of people of property in any State. If a father of a family ſhould ſhew any diſpoſitions to reſiſt, or to withdraw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from their power, his wife and children are cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly to anſwer for it. It is by means of theſe hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, that they keep the troops, which they force by maſſes (as they call it) into the field—true to their colours.</p>
            <p>Another of their reſources is not to be forgotten.—They have lately found a way of giving a ſort of ubiquity to the ſupreme Sovereign Authority, which no Monarch has been able yet to give to any repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of his.</p>
            <p>The Commiſſioners of the National Convention, who are the Members of the Convention itſelf, and really exerciſe all its powers, make continual circuits through every province, and viſits to every army. There they ſuperſede all the ordinary authorities, civil and military, and change and alter every thing at their pleaſure. So that in effect, no deliberative capacity exiſts in any portion of the inhabitants.—<bibl>

            <p>FRANCE differs eſſentially from all thoſe Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are formed without ſyſtem, which exiſt by habit, and which are confuſed with the multitude, and with the complexity of their purſuits. What now ſtands as government in France, is ſtruck out at a heat. The deſign is wicked, immoral, impious, oppreſſive; but it is ſpirited and daring: it is ſyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic; it is ſimple in its principle; it has unity and conſiſtency in perfection. In that country, entirely to cut off a branch of commerce, to extinguiſh a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture, to deſtroy the circulation of money, to violate credit, to ſuſpend the courſe of agriculture, even to burn a city, or to lay waſte a province of their own, does not coſt them a moment's anxiety. To them, the will, the wiſh, the want, the liberty, the toil, the blood of individuals is as nothing. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuality is left out of their ſcheme of government. The ſtate is all in all. Every thing is referred to the production of force; afterwards every thing is truſted to the uſe of it. It is military in its principle, in its maxims, in its ſpirit, and in all its movements. The ſtate has dominion and conqueſt for its ſole objects; dominion over minds by proſelytiſm, over bodies by arms.</p>
            <p>Thus conſtituted with an immenſe body of natural means, which are leſſened in their amount only to be increaſed in their effect, France has ſince the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of the revolution, a complete unity in its direction. It has deſtroyed every reſource of the ſtate, which depends upon opinion and the good will of individuals. The riches of convention diſappear. The advantages of nature in ſome conſiderable mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure remain; the command over them is complete and abſolute. We go about aſking when aſſignats will expire, and laugh at the laſt price of them: but what ſignifies the fate of theſe tickets of deſpotiſm?
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0244800202:122"/>
The deſpotiſm will find deſpotic means of ſupply. They have found the ſhort cut to the productions of Nature, while others in purſuit of them are obliged to wind through the labyrinth of artificial ſociety. They ſeize upon the fruit of the labour; they ſeize upon the labourer himſelf. The natural means of France are ſtill great. They are very materially leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened, I admit; but the power over them is increaſed. Were France but half what it is in population, in compactneſs, in applicability of its force, ſituated as it is, and being what it is, it would be too ſtrong for moſt of the States of Europe, conſtituted as they are, and proceeding as they proceed. Would it be wiſe to eſtimate what the world of Europe, as well as the world of Aſia, had to dread from Jinghiz Khan, upon a contemplation of the reſources of the cold and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren ſpot in the remoteſt Tartary, from whence firſt iſſued that ſcourge of the human race? Ought we to judge from the exciſe and ſtamp duties of the rocks, or from the paper circulation of the ſands of Arabia, the power by which Mahomet and his tribes laid hold at once on the two moſt powerful empires of the world; beat one of them totally to the ground, broke to pieces the other, and, in not much longer ſpace of time than I have lived, overturned governments, laws, manners, religion, and extended an empire from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus to the Pyrennees.</p>
            <p>Material reſources never have ſupplied, nor ever can ſupply the want of unity in deſign and conſtancy in purſuit. But unity in deſign, and perſeverance, and boldneſs in purſuit, have never wanted reſources, and never will. We have not conſidered as we ought the dreadful energy of a State, in which the property has nothing to do with the Government. Reflect, my dear Sir, reflect again and again on a Government, in which the property is in ſubjection, and where nothing rules but the minds of deſperate men. The condition of a commonwealth not go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by its property, was a combination of things,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0244800202:123"/>
which the learned and ingenious ſpeculator Harring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, who has toſſed about ſociety into all forms, never could imagine to be poſſible. We have ſeen it; the world has felt it; and if the world will ſhut their eyes to this ſtate of things, they will feel it more. The rulers there have found their reſources in crimes. The diſcovery is dreadful, the mine exhauſtleſs. They have every thing to gain, and they have nothing to loſe. They have a boundleſs inheritance in hope; and there is no medium for them betwixt the higheſt elevation, and death with infamy. Never can thoſe, who, from the miſerable ſervitude of the deſk have been raiſed to empire, again ſubmit to the bondage of a ſtarving bureau, or the profit of copying muſic, or writing plaidoyers by the ſheet. It has made me often ſmile in bitterneſs, when I heard talk of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity to ſuch men, provided they returned to their allegiance.</p>
            <p>From all this, what is my inference? It is, that this new ſyſtem of robbery in France cannot be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſafe by any art, or any means. That it <hi>muſt</hi> be deſtroyed, or that it will deſtroy all Europe.

            <p>The church was not impaired. Her eſtates, her majeſty, her ſplendor, her orders and gradations continued the ſame.

            <p>THIS ſyſtem, (the French) as it has been firſt realized, dogmatically, as well as practically, in France, makes France the natural head of all fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious formed on a ſimilar principle, whenever they may prevail, as much as Athens was the head and ſettled ally of all democratic factions, wherever they exiſted.

            <p>This ſyſtem has very many partizans in every country in Europe, but particularly in England, where they are already formed into a body, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending moſt of the diſſenters of the three leading denominations; to theſe are readily aggregated all who are diſſenters in character, temper, and diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though not belonging to any of their congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions—that is, all the reſtleſs people who reſemble them, of all ranks and all parties—whigs, and even

tories—the whole race of half bred ſpeculators;—all the atheiſts, deiſts, and ſocinians;—all thoſe who hate the clergy, and envy the nobility;—a good many among the monied people;—the Eaſt Indians almoſt to a man, who cannot bear to find that their preſent importance does not bear a proportion to their wealth. Theſe latter have united themſelves into one great, and in my opinion, formidable club<note n="*" place="bottom">Originally called the Bengal club, but ſince opened to perſons from the other preſidencies, for the purpoſe of conſolidating the whole Indian intereſt.</note>, which, though now quiet, may be brought into action with conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unanimity and force.</p>
            <p>Formerly few, except the ambitious great, or the deſperate and indigent, were to be feared as inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in revolutions. What has happened in France teaches us, with many other things, that there are more cauſes than have commonly been taken into our conſideration, by which government may be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. The monied men, merchants, principal tradeſmen, and men of letters (hitherto generally thought the peaceable and even timid part of ſociety) are the chief actors in the French Revolution. But the fact is, that as money increaſes and circulates, and as the circulation of news, in politics and letters, becomes more and more diffuſed, the perſons who diffuſe this money, and this intelligence, become more and more important. This was not long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcovered. Views of <hi>ambition</hi> were in France, for the firſt time, preſented to theſe claſſes of men. Objects in the ſtate, in the army, in the ſyſtem of civil offices of every kind. Their eyes were dazzled with this new proſpect. They were, as it were, electrified and made to loſe the natural ſpirit of their ſituation. A bribe, great without example in the hiſtory of the world, was held out to them—the whole government of a very large kingdom.</p>
            <p>There are ſeveral who are perſuaded that the ſame thing cannot happen in England, becauſe here, (they
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:0244800202:129"/>
ſay) the occupations of merchants, tradeſmen, and manufacturers, are not held as degrading ſituations. I once thought that the low eſtimation in which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce was held in France, might be reckoned among the cauſes of the late revolution; and I am ſtill of opinion, that the excluſive ſpirit of the French no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, did irritate the wealthy of other claſſes. But I found long ſince, that perſons in trade and buſineſs were by no means deſpiſed in France in the manner I had been taught to believe. As to men of letters, they were ſo far from being deſpiſed or neglected, that there was no country perhaps in the univerſe, in which they were ſo highly eſteemed, courted, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed, and even feared; tradeſmen naturally were not ſo much ſought in ſociety (as not furniſhing ſo largely to the fund of converſation as they do to the revenues of the ſtate) but the latter deſcription got forward every day. M. Bailly, who made himſelf the popular mayor on the rebellion of the Baſtile, and is a pricipal actor in the revolt, before the change poſſeſſed a penſion or office under the crown, of ſix hundred pound Engliſh, a year, for that country, no contemptible proviſion: And this he obtained ſolely as a man of letters, and on no other title. As to the monied men—whilſt the monarchy continued, there is no doubt, that merely as ſuch, they did not enjoy the <hi>privileges</hi> of nobility, but nobility was of ſo eaſy an acquiſition, that it was the fault or neglect of all of that deſcription, who did not obtain its pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, for their lives at leaſt in virtue of office. It attached under the royal government to an innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable multitude of places, real and nominal, that were vendible; and ſuch nobility were as capable of every thing as their degree of influence or intereſt could make them, that is, as nobility of no conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able rank or conſequence. M. Neckar, ſo far from being a French gentleman, was not ſo much as a Frenchman born, and yet we all know the rank in
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:0244800202:130"/>
which he ſtood on the day of the meeting of the ſtates.</p>
            <p>As to the mere matter of eſtimation of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantile or any other claſs, this is regulated by opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and prejudice. In England a ſecurity againſt the envy of men in theſe claſſes, is not ſo very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete as we may imagine. We muſt not impoſe upon ourſelves. What inſtitutions and manners together had done in France, manners alone do here. It is the natural operation of things where there exiſts a crown, a court, ſplendid orders of knighthood, and an hereditary nobility;—where there exiſts a fixed, permanent, landed gentry, continued in greatneſs and opulence by the law of primogeniture, and by a protection given to family ſettlements; where there exiſts a ſtanding army and navy;—where there exiſts a church eſtabliſhment, which beſtows on learning and parts an intereſt combined with that of religion and the ſtate;—in a country where ſuch things exiſt, wealth, new in it's acquiſition, and precarious in it's duration, can never rank firſt, or even near the firſt; though wealth has it's natural weight, further, than as it is balanced and even preponderated amongſt us as amongſt other nations, by artificial inſtitutions and opinions growing out of them. At no period in the hiſtory of England have ſo few peers been taken out of trade or from families newly created by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce. In no period has ſo ſmall a number of noble families entered into the counting-houſe. I can call to mind but one in all England, and his is of near fifty years ſtanding. Be that as it may, it appears plain to me from my beſt obſervation, that envy and ambition may by art, management and diſpoſition, be as much excited amongſt theſe deſcriptions of men in England, as in any other country; and that they are juſt as capable of acting a part in any great change.—<bibl>

            <head>REVOLUTION. Policy at the Revolution, different Syſtem purſued for ſome Years paſt. (See KING'S MEN, CABINET (DOUBLE.)</head>
            <p>AT the revolution, the crown, deprived, for the ends of the revolution itſelf, of many prerogatives, was found too weak to ſtruggle againſt all the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties which preſſed ſo new and unſettled a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The court was obliged therefore to delegate a part of its powers to men of ſuch intereſt as could ſupport, and of ſuch fidelity as would adhere to, its eſtabliſhment. Such men were able to draw in a greater number to a concurrence in the common defence. This connection, neceſſary at firſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued long after convenient; and properly conducted might indeed, in all ſituations, be an uſeful inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of government. At the ſame time, through the intervention of men of popular weight and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, the people poſſeſſed a ſecurity for their juſt portion of importance in the ſtate. But as the title to the crown grew ſtronger by long poſſeſſion, and by the conſtant increaſe of its influence, theſe helps have of late ſeemed to certain perſons no better than incumbrances. The powerful managers for govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were not ſufficiently ſubmiſſive to the pleaſure of the poſſeſſors of immediate and perſonal favour, ſometimes from a confidence in their own ſtrength, natural and acquired; ſometimes from a fear of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending their friends, and weakening that lead in the country, which gave them a conſideration indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the court. Men acted as if the court could receive, as well as confer, an obligation. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of government, thus divided in appearance between the court and the leaders of parties, became in many caſes an acceſſion rather to the popular than to the royal ſcale; and ſome part of that influence which would otherwiſe have been poſſeſſed as in a ſort of mortmain and unalienable domain, returned again to the great ocean from whence it aroſe, and
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:0244800202:132"/>
circulated among the people. This method, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, of governing, by men of great natural intereſt, or great acquired conſideration, was viewed in a very invidious light by the true lovers of abſolute mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy. It is the nature of deſpotiſm to abhor power held by any means but its own momentary pleaſure; and to annihilate all intermediate ſituations between boundleſs ſtrength on its own part, and total debility on the part of the people.</p>
            <p>To get rid of all this intermediate and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant importance, and <hi>to ſecure to the court the unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited and uncontrouled uſe of its own vaſt influence, under the ſole direction of its own private favour,</hi> has for ſome years paſt been the great object of policy. If this were compaſſed, the influence of the crown muſt, of courſe, produce all the effects which the moſt ſanguine partizans of the court could poſſibly deſire. Government might then be carried on with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any concurrence on the part of the peeple; without any attention to the dignity of the greater, or to the affections of the lower ſorts. A new project was therefore deviſed, by a certain ſet of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triguing men, totally different from the ſyſtem of adminiſtration which had prevailed ſince the acceſſion of the Houſe of Brunſwick. This project, I have heard, was firſt conceived by ſome perſons in the court of Frederick Prince of Wales.</p>
            <p>The earlieſt attempt in the execution of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was to ſet up for miniſter, a perſon, in rank in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed reſpectable, and very ample in fortune; but who, to the moment of this vaſt and ſudden eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was little known or conſidered in the kingdom. To him the whole nation was to yield an immediate and implicit ſubmiſſion. But whether it was for want of firmneſs to bear up againſt the firſt oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or that things were not yet fully ripened, or that this method was not found the moſt eligible; that idea was ſoon abandoned. The inſtrumental part of the project was a little altered, to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:0244800202:133"/>
it to the time, and to bring things more gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and more ſurely to the one great end propoſed.</p>
            <p>The firſt part of the reformed plan was to draw <hi>a line which ſhould ſeparate the court from the miniſtry.</hi> Hitherto theſe names had been looked upon as ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonymous; but for the future, court and adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were to be conſidered as things totally diſtinct. By this operation, two ſyſtems of adminiſtration were to be formed; one which ſhould be in the real ſecret and confidence; the other merely oſtenſible, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the official and executory duties of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The latter were alone to be reſponſible; whilſt the real adviſers, who enjoyed all the power, were effectually removed from all the danger.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>A party under theſe leaders was to be formed in favour of the court againſt the miniſtry:</hi> this party was to have a large ſhare in the emoluments of government, and to hold it totally ſeparate from, and independent of, oſtenſible adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>The third point, and that on which the ſucceſs of the whole ſcheme ultimately depended, was <hi>to bring parliament to an acquieſcence in this project.</hi> Parliament was therefore to be taught, by degrees, a total indifference to the perſons, rank, influence, abilities, connexions, and character, of the miniſters of the crown. By means of a diſcipline, on which I ſhall ſay more hereafter, that body was to be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituated to the moſt oppoſite intereſts, and the moſt diſcordant politics. All connexions and dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies among ſubjects were to be entirely diſſolved. As hitherto buſineſs had gone through the hands of leaders of Whigs or Tories, men of talents to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliate the people, and engage to their confidence, now the method was to be altered; and the lead was to be given to men of no ſort of conſideration or credit in the country. This want of natural import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance was to be their very title to delegated power. Members of parliament were to be hardened into an
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:0244800202:134"/>
inſenſibility to pride as well as to duty. Thoſe high and haughty ſentiments, which are the great ſupport of independence, were to be let down gradually. Point of honour and precedence were no more to be regarded in parliamentary decorum, than in a Turkiſh army. It was to be avowed as a conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional maxim, that the king might appoint one of his footmen, or one of your footmen, for miniſter; and that he ought to be, and that he would be, as well followed as the firſt name for rank or wiſdom in the nation. Thus parliament was to look on, as if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly unconcerned, while a cabal of the cloſet and back-ſtairs was ſubſtituted in the place of a national adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>With ſuch a degree of acquieſcence, any meaſure of any court might well be deemed thoroughly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure. The capital objects, and by much the moſt flattering characteriſtics of arbitrary power, would be obtained. Every thing would be drawn from its holdings in the country to the perſonal favour and inclination of the prince. This favour would be the ſole introduction to power, and the only tenure by which it was to be held: ſo that no perſon look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards another, and all looking towards the court, it was impoſſible but that the motive which ſolely influenced every man's hopes muſt come in time to govern every man's conduct; till at laſt the ſervility became univerſal, in ſpite of the dead letter of any laws or inſtitutions whatſoever.</p>
            <p>How it ſhould happen that any man could be tempted to venture upon ſuch a project of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may, at firſt view, appear ſurpriſing.

            <head>REPUBLICS (ANCIENT.) The old Republican Legiſlators followed, with a ſolicitous accuracy, the moral Conditions and Properties of Men.</head>
            <p>THE legiſlators who framed the antient republics knew that their buſineſs was too arduous to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed with no better apparatus than the metaphyſics of an under-graduate, and the mathematics and arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metic of an exciſeman. They had to do with men, and they were obliged to ſtudy human nature. They had to do with citizens, and they were obliged to ſtudy the effects of thoſe habits which are commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated by the circumſtances of civil life. They were ſenſible that the operation of this ſecond nature on the firſt produced a new combination; and thence aroſe many diverſities amongſt men, according to their birth, their education, their profeſſions, the periods of their lives, their reſidence in towns or in the country, their ſeveral ways of acquiring and of fixing property, and according to the quality of the property itſelf, all which rendered them as it were ſo many different ſpecies of animals. From hence they thought themſelves obliged to diſpoſe their citizens into ſuch claſſes, and to place them in ſuch ſituations in the ſtate as their peculiar habits might qualify them to fill, and to allot to them ſuch appropriated privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges as might ſecure to them what their ſpecific occaſions required, and which might furniſh to each deſcription ſuch force as might protect it in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict cauſed by the diverſity of intereſts, that muſt exiſt, and muſt contend in all complex ſociety: for the legiſlator would have been aſhamed, that the coarſe huſbandman ſhould well know how to aſſort and to uſe his ſheep, horſes, and oxen, and ſhould have enough of common ſenſe not to abſtract and equalize them all into animals, without providing for each kind an appropriate food, care, and employment; whilſt he, the oeconomiſt, diſpoſer, and ſhepherd of his own kindred, ſubliming himſelf into an airy metaphyſician,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:0244800202:138"/>
was reſolved to know nothing of his flocks but as men in general. It is for this reaſon that Monteſquien ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved very juſtly, that in their claſſification of the citizens, the great legiſlators of antiquity made the greateſt diſplay of their powers, and even ſoared above themſelves. It is here that your modern legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators have gone deep into the negative ſeries, and ſunk even below their own nothing. As the firſt ſort of legiſlators attended to the different kinds of citizens, and combined them into one commonwealth, the others, the metaphyſical and alchemiſtical legiſlators, (French) have taken the direct contrary courſe. They have attempted to confound all ſorts of citizens, as well as they could, into one homogeneous maſs; and then they divided th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> their amalgama into a number of incoherent republics. They reduce men to looſe counters merely for the ſake of ſimple telling, and not to figures whoſe power is to ariſe from their place in the table. The elements of their own metaphyſics might have taught them better leſſons. The troll of their categorical table might have informed them that there was ſomething elſe in the intellectual world beſides <hi>ſubſtance</hi> and <hi>quantity.</hi> They might learn from the catechiſm of metaphyſics that there were eight heads more<note n="*" place="bottom">Qualitas, Relatio, Actio, Paſſio, Ubi, Quando, Situs, Habitus.</note>, in every complex deliberation, which they have never thought of, though theſe, of all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, are the ſubject on which the ſkill of man can operate any thing at all.</p>
            <p>So far from this able diſpoſition of ſome of the old republican legiſlators, which follows with a ſolicitous accuracy, the moral conditions and propenſities of men, they have levelled and cruſhed together all the orders which they found, even under the coarſe unar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial arrangement of the monarchy, in which mode of government the claſſing of the citizens is not of ſo much importance as in a republic. It is true, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that every ſuch claſſification, if properly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0244800202:139"/>
is good in all forms of government; and compoſes a ſtrong barrier againſt the exceſſes of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotiſm, as well as it is the neceſſary means of giving effect and permanence to a republic. For want of ſomething of this kind, if the preſent project of a republic ſhould fail, all ſecurities to a moderated free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom fail along with it; all the indirect reſtraints which mitigate deſpotiſm are removed; inſomuch that if monarchy ſhould ever again obtain an entire aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy in France, under this or under any other dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſty, it will probably be, if not voluntarily tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered at letting out, by the wiſe and virtuous counſels of the prince, the moſt completely arbitrary power that has ever appeared on earth. This is to play a moſt deſperate game.</p>
            <p>The confuſion, which attends on all ſuch proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, they even declare to be one of their objects, and they hope to ſecure their conſtitution by a terror of a return of thoſe evils which attended their making it. <q rend="inline">"By this,"</q> ſay they,
<q rend="inline">"its deſtruction will become difficult to authority, which cannot break it up without the entire diſorganization of the whole ſtate."</q>
They preſume, that if this authority ſhould ever come to the ſame degree of power that they have acquired, it would make a more moderate and chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed uſe of it, and would piouſly tremble entirely to diſorganize the ſtate in the ſavage manner that they have done.

            <p>Inſtead of a public officer in an abuſive department, whoſe province is an object to be regulated, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a criminal who is to be puniſhed. I do moſt ſeriouſly put it to adminiſtration, to conſider the wiſdom of a timely reform. Early reformations are amicable arrangements with a friend in power; late reformations are terms impoſed upon a conquered enemy; early reformations are made in cool blood; late reformations are made under a ſtate of inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In that ſtate of things the people behold in government nothing that is reſpectable. They ſee the abuſe, and they will ſee nothing elſe—They fall into the temper of a furious populace provoked at the diſorder of a houſe of ill fame; they never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to correct or regulate; they go to work by the ſhorteſt way—They abate the nuiſance, they pull down the houſe.</p>
            <p>This is my opinion with regard to the true intereſt of government. But as it is the intereſt of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that reformation ſhould be early, it is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the people that it ſhould be temperate. It is their intereſt, becauſe a temperate reform is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent; and becauſe it has a principle of growth. Whenever we improve, it is right to leave room for a further improvement. It is right to conſider, to look about us, to examine the effect of what we have done.—Then we can proceed with confidence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we can proceed with intelligence. Whereas in hot reformations, in what men, more zealous than conſiderate, <hi>call making clear work,</hi> the whole is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſo crude, ſo harſh, ſo indigeſted; mixed with ſo much imprudence, and ſo much injuſtice; ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the whole courſe of human nature, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man inſtitutions, that the very people who are moſt eager for it, are among the firſt to grow diſguſted at what they have done. Then ſome part of the abdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated

The very idea of purity and diſintereſtedneſs in politics falls into diſrepute, and is conſidered as a viſion of hot and inexperienced men; and thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders become incurable, not by the virulence of their own quality, but by the unapt and violent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the remedies.

            <p>HAPPILY, France was not then jacobinized, (1780.) Her hoſtility was at a good diſtance. We had a limb cut off; but we reſerved the body. We loſt our colonies; but we kept our conſtitution. There was, indeed, much inteſtine heat; there was a dreadful fermentation. Wild and ſavage inſurrection quitted the woods, and prowled about our ſtreets in the name of reform. Such was the diſtemper of the public mind, that there was no madman, in his maddeſt ideas, and maddeſt projects, that might not count upon numbers to ſupport his principles and execute his deſigns.</p>
            <p>Many of the changes, by a great miſnomer called parliamentary reforms, went, not in the intention of all the profeſſors and ſupporters of them, undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, but went in their certain, and, in my opinion, not very remote effect, home to the utter deſtruction of the conſtitution of this kingdom. Had they taken place, not France, but England, would have had the honour of leading up the death-dance of democratic revolution. Other projects, exactly coincident in time with thoſe, ſtruck at the very exiſtence of the kingdom under any conſtitution. There are, who remember the blind fury of ſome, and the lamentable helpleſſneſs of others; here, a torpid confuſion, from a panic fear of the danger; there, the ſame inaction from a ſtupid inſenſibility to it; here, well-wiſhers to the miſchief; there, indifferent lookers-on.

            <head>REFORMATION. Its Effects. (See REVOLUTION (FRENCH) RELIGION, POLITICS, NEW SYSTEM.)</head>
            <p>THE laſt revolution of doctrine and theory which has happened in Europe, is the Reformation. It is not for my purpoſe to take any notice here of the merits of that Revolution, but to ſtate one only of it's effects.</p>
            <p>That effect was <hi>to introduce other intereſts into all countries, than thoſe which aroſe from their locality and natural circumſtances.</hi> The principle of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was ſuch, as by it's eſſence, could not be local or confined to the country in which it had it's origin. For inſtance, the doctrine of <q rend="inline">"Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by Faith or by Works,"</q> which was the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal baſis of the Reformation, could not have one of it's alternatives true as to Germany, and falſe as to every other country. Neither are queſtions of true and theoretic falſehood, governed by circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, any more than by places. On that occaſion, therefore, the ſpirit of proſelytiſm expanded itſelf with great elaſticity upon all ſides, and great divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were every where the reſult.</p>
            <p>Theſe diviſions, however, in appearance merely dogmatic, ſoon became mixed with political; and their effects were rendered much more intenſe from this combination. Europe was, for a long time, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into two great factions, under the name of Catholic and Proteſtant, which not only often alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated ſtate from ſtate, but alſo divided almoſt every
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:0244800202:147"/>
ſtate within itſelf. The warm parties in each ſtate were more affectionately attached to thoſe of their own doctrinal intereſt in ſome other country than to their fellow-citizens, or to their natural government, when they, or either of them, happened to be of a different perſuaſion. Theſe factions, whenever they prevailed, if they did not abſolutely deſtroy, at leaſt weakened and diſtracted the locality of patriotiſm, the public affections came to have other motives and other ties.</p>
            <p>Although the principles to which it gave riſe, did not operate with a perfect regularity and conſtancy, they never wholly ceaſed to operate. Few wars were made, and few treaties were entered into in which they did not come in for ſome part. They gave a colour, a character, and direction to all the politics of Europe.—<bibl>

            <p>VIRTUAL repreſentation is that in which there is a communion of intereſts, and a ſympathy in feelings and deſires between thoſe who act in the name of any deſcription of people, and the people in whoſe name they act, though the truſtees are not actually choſen by them.

At the ſame time, that in this languid inactive ſtate, the nerves are more liable to the moſt horrid convulſions, than when they are ſufficiently braced and ſtrengthened. Melancholy, dejection, deſpair, and often ſelf-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, is the conſequence of the gloomy view we take of things in this relaxed ſtate of body. The beſt remedy for all theſe evils is exerciſe or <hi>labour;</hi> and labour is a ſurmounting of <hi>difficulties,</hi> an exertion of the contracting power of the muſcles; and as ſuch reſembles pain, which conſiſts in tenſion or contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in every thing but degree. Labour is not only requiſite to preſerve the coarſer organs in a ſtate fit for their functions; but it is equally neceſſary to theſe finer and more delicate organs, on which, and by which, the imagination, and perhaps the other mental powers, act. Since it is probable, that not only the inferior parts of the ſoul, as the paſſions are called, but the underſtanding itſelf makes uſe of ſome fine corporeal inſtruments in it's operation; though what they are, and where they are, may be ſomewhat hard to ſettle: but that it does make uſe of ſuch, appears from hence; that a long exerciſe of the mental powers induces a remarkable laſſitude of the whole body; and on the other hand, that great bodily la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, or pain, weakens and ſometimes actually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the mental faculties.

            <p>The principled Royaliſts are certainly not of force to effect theſe objects by themſelves. If they were, the operations of the preſent great combination would be wholly unneceſſary.

I am ſure, that if half that number of the ſame deſcription were taken out of this country, it would leave hardly any thing that I ſhould call the people of England. On the faith of the Emperor and the King of Pruſſia, a body of ten thouſand nobility on horſeback, with the King's two brothers at their head, ſerved with the King of Pruſſia in the campaign of 1792, and equipped themſelves with the laſt ſhilling of their ruined fortunes and exhauſted credit<note n="*" place="bottom">Before the Revolution the French nobleſſe were ſo reduced in numbers, that they did not much exceed twenty thouſand, at leaſt of full grown men.

No part of the mind has reſt. Power gradually extirpates from the mind every humane and gentle virtue. Pity, benevolence, friendſhip, are things almoſt unknown in high ſtations. <hi>Veroe amicitioe rariſſime inveniuntur in iis qui i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

And indeed, courts are the ſchools where cruelty, pride, diſſimulation and treachery are ſtudied and taught in the moſt vicious perfection. This is a point ſo clear and acknowledged, that if it did not make a neceſſary part of my ſubject, I ſhould paſs it by entirely. And this has hindered me from draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at full length, and in the moſt ſtriking colours, this ſhocking picture of the degeneracy and wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of human nature, in that part which is vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly thought its happieſt and moſt amiable ſtate.—You know from what originals I could copy ſuch pictures. Happy are they who know enough of them to know the little value of the poſſeſſors of ſuch things, and of all that they poſſeſs; and happy they who have been ſnatched from that poſt of danger which they occupy, with the remains of their virtue; loſs of honours, wealth, titles, and even the loſs of one's country, is nothing in balance with ſo great an advantage.</p>
            <p>Let us now view the other ſpecies of the rich, thoſe who devote their time and fortunes to idleneſs and pleaſure. How much happier are they? The plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which are agreeable to nature are within the reach of all, and therefore can form no diſtinction in favour of the rich. The pleaſures which art forces
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:0244800202:153"/>
up are ſeldom ſincere, and never ſatisfying. What is worſe, this conſtant application to pleaſure takes away from the enjoyment, or rather turns it into the nature of a very burthenſome and laborious buſineſs. It has conſequences much more fatal. It produces a weak valetudinary ſtate of body, attended by all thoſe horrid diſorders, and yet more horrid methods of cure, which are the reſult of luxury on one hand, and the weak and ridiculous efforts of human art on the other. The pleaſures of ſuch men are ſcarcely felt as pleaſures; at the ſame time that they bring on pains and diſeaſes, which are felt but too ſeverely. The mind has its ſhare of the misfortune; it grows lazy and enervate, unwilling and unable to ſearch for truth, and utterly uncapable of knowing, much leſs of reliſhing real happineſs. The poor by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive labour, and the rich by their enormous luxury, are ſet upon a level, and rendered equally ignorant of any knowledge which might conduce to their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.

Very different is the proſpect of the natural ſtate. Here there are no wants which nature gives, and in this ſtate men can be ſenſible of no other wants, which are not to be ſupplied by a very moderate degree of labour; therefore there is no ſlavery.

            <p>THE political dogma, which upon the new French ſyſtem, is to unite the factions of different nations, turns on this,
<q rend="inline">"That the majority told, by the head, of the taxable people in every country, is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual, natural, unceaſing, indefeaſible ſovereign; that this majority is perfectly maſter of the form, as well as the adminiſtration of the ſtate, and that the magiſtrates, under whatever names they are called, are only functionaries to obey the orders, (general as laws or particular as decrees) which that majority may make; that this is the only na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural government; that all others are tyranny and uſurpation."</q>
            </p>
            <p>In order to reduce this dogma into practice, the republicans in France, and their aſſociates in other countries, make it always their buſineſs, and often their public profeſſion, to deſtroy all traces of antient eſtabliſhments, and to form a new commonwealth in each country, upon the baſis of the French <hi>Rights of Men.</hi> On the principle of theſe rights, they mean to inſtitute in every country, and as it were, the germ of the whole, parochial governments, for the
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:0244800202:159"/>
purpoſe of what they call equal repreſentation. From them is to grow, by ſome media, a general council and repreſentative of all the parochial governments. In that repreſentative is to be veſted the whole na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tional power; totally aboliſhing hereditary name and office, levelling all conditions of men, (except where money <hi>muſt</hi> make a difference) breaking all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion between territory and dignity, and aboliſhing every ſpecies of nobility, gentry, and church eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhments; all their prieſts, and all their magiſtrates being only creatures of election, and penſioners at will.</p>
            <p>Knowing how oppoſite a permanent landed intereſt is to that ſcheme, they have reſolved, and it is the great drift of all their regulations, to reduce that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of men to a mere peaſantry, for the ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the towns, and to place the true effective government in cities, among the tradeſmen, bankers, and voluntary clubs of bold, preſuming young per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;—advocates, attornies, notaries, managers of newſpapers, and thoſe cabals of literary men, called academies.

            <p>IN ſhort, the Germanic body is a vaſt maſs of heterogeneous States, held together by that hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous body of old principles which formed the public law poſitive and doctrinal.

            <p>THE peaſants, in all probability, are the deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants of theſe antient proprietors, Romans or Gauls. But if they fail, in any degree, in the titles which they make on the principles of antiquaries and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, they retreat into the citadel of the rights of men. There they find that men are equal; and the earth, the kind and equal mother of all, ought not to be monopolized to foſter the pride and luxury of any men, who by nature are no better than themſelves, and who, if they do not labour for their bread, are worſe. They find, that by the laws of nature the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupant and ſubduer of the ſoil is the true proprietor; that there is no preſcription againſt nature; and that the agreements (where any there are) which have been made with their landlords, during the time of ſlavery, are only the effect of dureſſe and force; and that when the people re-entered into the rights of men, thoſe agreements were made as void as every thing elſe which had been ſettled under the prevalence of the old feudal and ariſtocratic tyranny. They will tell you that they ſee no difference between an idler with a hat and a national cockade, and an idler in a cowl or in a rochet. If you ground the title to rents on ſucceſſion and preſcription, they tell you, from the ſpeech of Mr. <hi>Camus,</hi> publiſhed by the national aſſembly for their information, that things ill begun cannot avail themſelves of preſcription; that the title of theſe lords was vicious in its origin; and that force is at leaſt as bad as fraud. As to the title by ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, they will tell you, that the ſucceſſion of thoſe who have cultivated the ſoil is the true pedigree of property, and not rotten parchments and ſilly ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions; that the lords have enjoyed their uſurpation too long; and that if they allow to theſe lay monks any charitable penſion, they ought to be thankful to the bounty of the true proprietor, who is ſo generous towards a falſe claimant to his goods.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="337" facs="tcp:0244800202:163"/>When the peaſants give you back that coin of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtic reaſon, on which you have ſet your image and ſuperſcription, you cry it down as baſe money, and tell them you will pay for the future with French guards, and dragoons, and huſſars. You hold up, to chaſtiſe them, the ſecond-hand authority of a king, who is only the inſtrument of deſtroying, without any power of protecting either the people or his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Through him it ſeems you will make yourſelves obeyed. They anſwer, you have taught us that there are no gentlemen; and which of your principles teach us to bow to kings whom we have not elected? We know, without your teaching, that lands were given for the ſupport of feudal dignities, feudal titles, and feudal offices. When you took down the cauſe as a grievance, why ſhould the more grievous effect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main? As there are now no hereditary honours, and no diſtinguiſhed families, why are we taxed to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain what you tell us ought not to exiſt? You have ſent down our old ariſtocratic landlords in no other character, and with no other title, but that of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actors under your authority. Have you endeavoured to make theſe your rent-gatherers reſpectable to us? No. You have ſent them to us with their arms re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed, their ſhields broken, their impreſſes defaced; and ſo diſplumed, degraded, and metamorphoſed, ſuch unfeathered two-legged things, that we no longer know them. They are ſtrangers to us. They do not even go by the names of our antient lords. Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſically they may be the ſame men; though we are not quite ſure of that, on your new philoſophic doctrines of perſonal identity. In all other reſpects they are totally changed. We do not ſee why we have not as good a right to refuſe them their rents, as you have to abrogate all their honours, titles, and diſtinctions. This we have never commiſſioned you to do; and it is one inſtance, among many indeed, of your aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of undelegated power. We ſee the burghers of Paris, through their clubs, their mobs, and their
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:0244800202:164"/>
national guards, directing you at their pleaſure, and giving that as law to you, which, under your au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, is tranſmitted as law to us. Through you, theſe burghers diſpoſe of the lives and fortunes of us all. Why ſhould not you attend us as much to the deſires of the laborious huſbandman with regard to our rent, by which we are affected in the moſt ſerious manner, as you do to the demands of theſe inſolent burghers relative to diſtinctions and titles of honour, by which neither they nor we are affected at all? But we find you pay more regard to their fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies than to our neceſſities. Is it among the rights of man to pay tribute to his equals? Before this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of yours, we might have thought we were not perfectly equal. We might have entertained ſome old, habitual, unmeaning prepoſſeſſion in favour of thoſe landlords; but we cannot conceive with what other view than that of deſtroying all reſpect to them, you could have made the law that degrades them. You have forbidden us to treat them with any of the old formalities of reſpect, and now you ſend troops to ſabre and to bayonet us into a ſubmiſſion to fear and force, which you did not ſuffer us to yield to the mild authority of opinion.</p>
            <p>The ground of ſome of theſe arguments is horrid and ridiculous to all rational ears; but to the politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians of metaphyſics who have opened ſchools for ſophiſtry, and made eſtabliſhments for anarchy, it is ſolid and concluſive. It is obvious, that on a mere conſideration of the right, the leaders in the aſſembly would not in the leaſt have ſcrupled to abrogate the rents along with the titles and family enſigns. It would be only to follow up the principle of their reaſonings, and to complete the analogy of their conduct. But they had newly poſſeſſed themſelves of a great body of landed property by confiſcation. They had this commodity at market; and the market would have been wholly deſtroyed, if they were to permit the huſbandman to riot in the ſpeculations
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:0244800202:165"/>
with which they ſo freely intoxicated themſelves. The only ſecurity which property enjoys in any one of its deſcriptions, is from the intereſts of their rapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city with regard to ſome other.

Then the people of England are contented to ſeek in the kindneſs of a foreign ſyſtematic enemy combined with a dangerous faction at home; a ſecurity which they cannot find in their own patriotiſm and their own courage. They are willing to truſt to the ſympathy of regicides, the guarantee of the Britiſh monarchy. They are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to reſt their religion on the piety of atheiſts by eſtabliſhment. They are ſatisfied to ſeek in the cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of practiſed murderers the ſecurity of their lives. They are pleaſed to confide their property to the ſafeguard of thoſe who are robbers by inclination, intereſt, habit, and ſyſtem. If this be our deliberate

            <p>WITH a regicide peace the King cannot long have a miniſter to ſerve him, nor the miniſter a King to ſerve. If the great diſpoſer, in reward of the royal and private virtues of our ſovereign, ſhould call him from the calamitous ſpectacle which will attend a ſtate of amity with regicide, his ſucceſſor will ſurely ſee them, unleſs the ſame providence greatly anticipates the courſe of nature. Thinking thus, (and not as I conceive on light grounds) I dare not flatter the reigning ſovereign, nor any miniſter he has, or can have, nor his ſucceſſor apparent, nor any of thoſe who may be called to ſerve him, with what appears to me a falſe ſtate of their ſituation.

               </gap>F theſe princes had ſhewn a tyrannic diſpoſition, it would be much to be lamented. We have no others to govern France. If we ſereened the body of murderers from their juſtice, we ſhould only leave the innocent in future to the mercy of men of fierce and ſanguinary diſpoſitions, of which in ſpite of all our intermeddling in their conſtitution, we could not prevent the effects. But as we have much more reaſon to fear their ſeeble lenity than any blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able rigour, we ought, in my opinion, to leave the matter to themſelves.</p>
            <p>If, however, I were aſked to give an advice merely as ſuch—here are my ideas. I am not for a total indemnity, nor a general puniſhment. And firſt, the body and maſs of the people never ought to be treated as criminal. They may become an object of
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:0244800202:169"/>
more or leſs conſtant watchfulneſs and ſuſpicion, as their preſervation may beſt require, but they can never become an object of puniſhment. This is one of the few fundamental and unalterable principles of politics.</p>
            <p>To puniſh them capitally would be to make maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacres. Maſſacres only increaſe the ferocity of men, and teach them to regard their own lives and thoſe of others as of little value; whereas the great policy of government is to teach the people to think both of great importance in the eyes of God and the State, and never to be ſacrificed or even hazarded to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify their paſſions, or for any thing but the duties preſcribed by the rules of morality, and under the direction of public law and public authority. To puniſh them with leſſer penalties would be to debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the commonwealth, and make the nation miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, which it is the buſineſs of government to render happy and flouriſhing.</p>
            <p>As to crimes too, I would draw a ſtrong line of limitation. For no one offence, <hi>politically an offence of rebellion,</hi> by council, contrivance, perſuaſion, or compulſion, for none properly a <hi>military offence of rebellion,</hi> or any thing done by open hoſtility in the field, ſhould any man at all be called in queſtion; becauſe ſuch ſeems to be the proper and natural death of civil diſſentions. The offences of war are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated by peace.</p>
            <p>Another claſs will of courſe be included in the indemnity, namely, all thoſe who by their activity in reſtoring lawful Government ſhall obliterate their offences. The offence previouſly known, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of ſervice is a pardon for crimes. I fear that this claſs of men will not be very numerous.</p>
            <p>So far as to indemnity. But where are the objects of juſtice, and of example, and of future ſecurity to the public peace? They are naturally pointed out, not by their having outraged political and civil laws, nor their having rebelled againſt the ſtate, as a State,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:0244800202:170"/>
but by their having rebelled againſt the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and outraged man, as man. In this liſt, all the regicides in general, all thoſe who laid ſacrilegious hands on the King, who, without any thing in their own rebellious miſſion to the convention to juſtify them, brought him to his trial, and unanimouſly voted him guilty; all thoſe who had a ſhare in the cruel murder of the Queen, and the deteſtable proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with regard to the young King, and the unhappy Princeſſes; all thoſe who committed cold-blooded murder any where, and particularly in their revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary tribunals, where every idea of natural juſtice and of their own declared Rights of Man, have been trod under foot with the moſt inſolent mockery; all men concerned in the burning and demolition of houſes or churches, with audacious and marked acts of ſacrilege and ſcorns offered to religion; in general, all the leaders of Jacobin clubs; not one of theſe ſhould eſcape a puniſhment ſuitable to the nature, quality, and degree of their offence, by a ſteady but a meaſured juſtice.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, no man ought to be ſubject to any penalty, from the higheſt to the loweſt, but by a trial according to the courſe of law, carried on with all that caution and deliberation which has been uſed in the beſt times and precedents of the French juriſprudence, the criminal law of which country, faulty to be ſure in ſome particulars, was highly laudable and tender of the lives of men. In reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing order and juſtice, every thing like retaliation ought to be religiouſly avoided; and an example ought to be ſet of a total alienation from the Jacobin proceedings in their accurſed revolutionary tribunals. Every thing like lumping men in maſſes, and of forming tables of proſcription ought to be avoided.</p>
            <p>In all theſe puniſhments, any thing which can be alledged in mitigation of the offence ſhould be fully conſidered. Mercy is not a thing oppoſed to juſtice. It is an eſſential part of it; as neceſſary in criminal
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:0244800202:171"/>
caſes, as in civil affairs equity is to law. It is only for the Jacobins never to pardon. They have not done it in a ſingle inſtance. A council of mercy ought therefore to be appointed, with powers to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port on each caſe, to ſoften the penalty, or entirely to remit it, according to circumſtances.</p>
            <p>With theſe precautions, the very firſt foundation of ſettlement muſt be to call to a ſtrict account thoſe bloody and mercileſs offenders. Without it govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot ſtand a year. People little conſider the utter impoſſibility of getting thoſe who having emerged from very low, ſome from the loweſt claſſes of ſociety, have exerciſed a power ſo high, and with ſuch unrelenting and bloody a rage, quietly to fall back into their old ranks, and become humble, peaceable, laborious, and uſeful members of ſociety. It never can be. On the other hand, is it to be believed, that any worthy and virtuous ſubject, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to the ruins of his houſe, will, with patience, ſee the cold-blooded murderer of his father, mother, wife, or children, or, perhaps, all of theſe relations (ſuch things have been) noſe him in his own village, and inſult him with the riches acquired from the plunder of his goods, ready again to head a Jacobin faction to attack his life? He is unworthy of the name of man who would ſuffer it. It is unworthy of the name of a government, which taking juſtice out of the private hand, will not exerciſe it for the injured by the public arm.</p>
            <p>I know it ſounds plauſible, and is readily adopted by thoſe who have little ſympathy with the ſufferings of others, who wiſh to jumble the innocent and guilty into one maſs, by a general indemnity. This cruel indifference dignifies itſelf with the name of humanity.</p>
            <p>It is extraordinary that as the wicked arts of this regicide and tyrannous faction increaſe in number, variety, and atrocity, the deſire of puniſhing them becomes more and more faint, and the talk of an
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:0244800202:172"/>
indemnity towards them, every day ſtronger and ſtronger. Our ideas of juſtice appear to be fairly conquered and overpowered by guilt when it is grown gigantic. It is not the point of view in which we are in the habit of viewing guilt. The crimes we every day puniſh, are really below the penalties we inflict. The criminals are obſcure and feeble. This is the view in which we ſee ordinary crimes and cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals. But when guilt is ſeen, though but for a time, to be furniſhed with the arms, and to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with the robes of power, it ſeems to aſſume another nature, and to get, as it were, out of our juriſdiction. This I fear is the caſe with many. But there is another cauſe full as powerful towards this ſecurity to enormous guilt, the deſire which poſſeſſes people who have once obtained power, to enjoy it at their caſe. It is not humanity, but lazineſs and inertneſs of mind which produces the deſire of this kind of indemnities. This deſcription of men, love general and ſhort methods. If they puniſh, they make a promiſcuous maſſacre; if they ſpare, they make a general act of oblivion. This is a want of diſpoſition to proceed laboriouſly according to the caſes, and according to the rules and principles of juſtice on each caſe; a want of diſpoſition to aſſort criminals, to diſcriminate the degrees and modes of guilt, to ſeparate accomplices from principals, leaders from followers, ſeducers from the ſeduced, and then by following the ſame principles in the ſame detail, to claſs puniſhments, and to ſit them to the nature and kind of the delinquency. If that were once attempted, we ſhould ſoon ſee that the taſk was neither infinite, nor the execution cruel. There would be deaths, but for the number of criminals, and the extent of France, not many. There would be caſes of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſportation; caſes of labour to reſtore what has been wickedly deſtroyed; caſes of impriſonment, and caſes of mere exile. But be this as it may, I am ſure that if juſtice is not done there, there can be
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:0244800202:173"/>
neither peace or juſtice there, nor in any part of Europe.</p>
            <p>Hiſtory is reſorted to for other acts of indemnity in other times. The Princes are deſired to look back to Henry the Fourth. We are deſired to look to the reſtoration of king Charles. Theſe things, in my opinion, have no reſemblance whatſoever. They were caſes of a civil war; in France more ferocious, in England more moderate than common. In neither country were the orders of ſociety ſubverted; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and morality deſtroyed on principle, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty totally annihilated. In England the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Cromwell was to be ſure ſomewhat rigid, but for a new power, no ſavage tyranny. The country was nearly as well in his hands as in thoſe of Charles the Second, and in ſome points much better. The laws in general had their courſe, and were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably adminiſtered. The king did not in reality grant an act of indemnity; the prevailing power, then in a manner the nation, in effect granted an indemnity to <hi>him.</hi> The idea of a preceding rebellion was not at all admitted in that convention and that parliament. The regicides were a common enemy, and as ſuch given up.</p>
            <p>Among the ornaments of their place which emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently diſtinguiſh them, few people are better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the hiſtory of their own country than the illuſtrious Princes now in exile: but I caution them not to be led into error by that which has been ſuppoſed to be the guide of life. I would give the ſame caution to all princes. Not that I derogate from the uſe of hiſtory. It is a great improver of the underſtanding, by ſhewing both men and affairs in a great variety of views. From this ſource much political wiſdom may be learned; that is, may be learned as habit, not as precept; and as an exerciſe to ſtrengthen the mind, as furniſhing materials to enlarge and enrich it, not as a repertory of caſes and precedents for a lawyer; if it were, a thouſand times
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:0244800202:174"/>
better would it be that a Stateſman had never learned to read—<hi>vellem neſcirent literas.</hi> This method turns their underſtanding from the object before them, and from the preſent exigencies of the world, to compariſons with former times, of which after all, we can know very little and very imperfectly; and our guides, the hiſtorians, who are to give us their true interpretation, are often prejudiced, often ignorant, often fonder of ſyſtem than of truth. Whereas, if a man with reaſonable good parts and natural ſagacity, and not in the leading-ſtrings of any maſter, will look ſteadily on the buſineſs before him, without being diverted by retroſpect and compariſon, he may be capable of forming a reaſonable good judgement of what is to be done. There are ſome fundamental points in which nature never changes—but they are few and obvious, and belong rather to morals than to politics. But ſo far as regards political matter, the human mind and human affairs are ſuſceptible of infinite modifications, and of combinations wholly new and unlooked for. Very few, for inſtance, could have imagined that property, which has been taken for natural dominion, ſhould, through the whole of a vaſt kingdom, loſe all its importance and even its influence. This is what hiſtory or books of ſpeculation could hardly have taught us. How many could have thought, that the moſt complete and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable revolution in a great empire ſhould be made by men of letters, not as ſubordinate inſtruments and trumpeters of ſedition, but as the chief contrivers and managers, and in a ſhort time as the open admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrators and ſovereign rulers? Who could have imagined that atheiſm could produce one of the moſt violently operative principles of fanaticiſm? Who could have imagined, that in a commonwealth in a manner cradled in war, and in an extenſive and dreadful war, military commanders ſhould be of little or no account? That the convention ſhould not contain one military man of name? That admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrative
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:0244800202:175"/>
bodies in a ſtate of the utmoſt confuſion, and of but a momentary duration, and compoſed of men with not one impoſing part of character, ſhould be able to govern the country and its armies, with an authority which the moſt ſettled ſenates, and the moſt reſpected monarchs ſcarcely ever had in the ſame degree? This, for one, I confeſs I did not foreſee, though all the reſt was preſent to me very early, and not out of my apprehenſion even for ſeveral years.</p>
            <p>I believe very few were able to enter into the effects of mere <hi>terror,</hi> as a principle not only for the ſupport of power in given hands or forms, but in thoſe things in which the ſoundeſt political ſpeculators were of opinion, that the leaſt appearance of force would be totally deſtructive, ſuch is the market, whether of money, proviſion, or commodities of any kind. Yet for four years we have ſeen loans made, treaſuries ſupplied, and armies levied and maintained, more numerous than France ever ſhewed in the field, by the <hi>effects of fear alone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is a ſtate of things, of which, in its totality, if hiſtory furniſhes any examples at all, they are very remote and feeble. I therefore am not ſo ready as ſome are, to tax with folly or cowardice, thoſe who were not prepared to meet an evil of this nature. Even now, after the events, all the cauſes may be ſomewhat difficult to aſcertain. Very many are however traceable. But theſe things hiſtory and books of ſpeculation (as I have already ſaid) did not teach men to foreſee, and of courſe to reſiſt. Now that they are no longer a matter of ſagacity, but of experience, of recent experience, of our own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, it would be unjuſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>WHILST the fortune of the field was wholly with the Regicides, nothing was thought of but to follow where it led; and it led to every thing. Not ſo much as a talk of treaty. Laws were laid down with arrogance. The moſt moderate politician amongſt them<note n="*" place="bottom">Boiſſy d'Anglas.</note> was choſen as the organ, not ſo much for preſcribing limits to their claims, as to mark what, for the preſent, they are content to leave to others. They made not laws, not Conventions, but late poſſeſſion, but phyſical nature, and political convenience the ſole foundation of their claims. The Rhine, the Mediterranean, and the ocean were the bounds which, for the time, they aſſigned to the empire of Regicide. In truth, with theſe limits, and their principle, they would not have left even the ſhadow of liberty or ſafety to any nation. This plan of empire was not taken up in the firſt intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of unexpected ſucceſs. You muſt recollect, that it was projected juſt as the report has ſtated it, from the very firſt revolt of the faction againſt their monarchy; and it has been uniformly purſued, as a ſtanding maxim of national policy, from that time to this. It is in the ſeaſon of proſperity that men diſcover their real tempers, principles, and deſigns.

            <p>ON a ſuperficial view, we may ſeem to differ very widely from each other in our reaſonings, and no leſs in our pleaſures: but notwithſtanding this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:0244800202:177"/>
which I think to be rather apparent, than real, it is probable that the ſtandard, both of reaſon and taſte is the ſame in all human creatures. For if there were not ſome principles of judgement as well as of ſentiment common to all mankind, no hold could poſſibly be taken either on their reaſon or their paſſions, ſufficient to maintain the ordinary corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence of life. It appears indeed to be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally acknowledged, that with regard to truth and falſehood there is ſomething fixed. We find people in their diſputes continually appealing to certain teſts and ſtandards, which are allowed on all ſides, and are ſuppoſed to be eſtabliſhed in our common nature. But there is not the ſame obvious concurrence in any uniform or ſettled principles which relate to taſte. It is even commonly ſuppoſed that this delicate and aërial faculty, which ſeems too volatile to endure even the chains of a definition, cannot be properly tried by any teſt, nor regulated by any ſtandard. There is ſo continual a call for the exerciſe of the reaſoning faculty, and it is ſo much ſtrengthened by perpetual contention, that certain maxims of right reaſon ſeem to be tacitly ſettled amongſt the moſt ignorant. The learned have improved on this rude ſcience, and reduced thoſe maxims into a ſyſtem. If taſte has not been ſo happily cultivated, it was not that the ſubject was barren, but that the labourers were few or negligent; for to ſay the truth, there are not the ſame intereſting motives to impel us to fix the one, which urge us to aſcertain the other. And after all, if men differ in their opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſuch matters, their difference is not attended with the ſame important conſequences; elſe I make no doubt but that the logic of taſte, if I may be allowed the expreſſion, might very poſſibly be as well digeſted, and we might come to diſcuſs matters of this nature with as much certainty, as thoſe which ſeem more immediately within the province of mere reaſon.—<bibl>

            <p>ONE would think, that after an honeſt and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary revolution, (if they had a mind that theirs ſhould paſs for ſuch) your maſters would have imitated the virtuous policy of thoſe who have been at the head of revolutions of that glorious character. Burnet tells us, that nothing tended to reconcile the Engliſh na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the government of King William ſo much as the care he took to fill the vacant biſhoprics with men who had attracted the public eſteem by their learning, eloquence, and piety, and above all, by their known moderation in the ſtate. With you, in your purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing revolution, whom have you choſen to regulate the church? Mr. Mirabeau is a fine ſpeaker—and a fine writer—and a fine—a very fine man; but really nothing gave more ſurprize to every body here, than to find him the ſupreme head of your eccleſiaſtical affairs. The reſt is of courſe. Your aſſembly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes a manifeſto to France, in which they tell the people, with an inſulting irony, that they have brought the church to its primitive condition. In one reſpect their declaration is undoubtedly true; for they have brought it to a ſtate of poverty and perſecution.—What can be hoped for after this? Have not men (if they deſerve the name) under this new hope and head of the church, been made biſhops, for no other merit than having acted as inſtruments of atheiſts; for no other merit than having thrown the children's bread to dogs; and in order to gorge the whole gang of uſurers, pedlars, and itinerant Jew diſcounters at the corners of ſtreets, ſtarved the poor of their Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian flocks, and their own brother paſtors? Have not ſuch men been made biſhops to adminiſter in temples, in which (if the patriotic donations have not already ſtripped them of their veſſels) the churchwardens ought to take ſecurity for the altar plate, and not ſo
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:0244800202:179"/>
much as to truſt the chalice in their ſacrilegious hands, ſo long as Jews have aſſignats on eccleſiaſtic plunder, to exchange for the ſilver ſtolen from churches?</p>
            <p>I am told, that the very ſons of ſuch Jew-jobbers have been made biſhops; perſons not to be ſuſpected of any ſort of Chriſtian ſuperſtition, fit colleagues to the holy prelate of Autun; and bred at the feet of that Gamaliel. We know who it was that drove the money changers out of the temple. We ſee too who it is that brings them in again. We have in London very reſpectable perſons of the Jewiſh nation, whom we will keep; but we have of the ſame tribe others of a very different deſcription,—houſe-breakers, and receivers of ſtolen goods, and forgers of paper cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, more than we can conveniently hang. Theſe we can ſpare to France, to fill the new epiſcopal thrones: men well verſed in ſwearing; and who will ſcruple no oath which the fertile genius of any of your reformers can deviſe.</p>
            <p>In matters ſo ridiculous, it is hard to be grave. On a view of their conſequences it is almoſt inhuman to treat them lightly. To what a ſtate of ſavage, ſtupid, ſervile inſenſibility muſt your people be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, who can endure ſuch proceedings in their church, their ſtate, and their judicature, even for a moment! But the deluded people of France are like other madmen, who, to a miracle, bear hunger, and thirſt, and cold, and confinement, and the chains and laſh of their keeper, whilſt all the while they ſupport themſelves by the imagination that they are generals of armies, prophets, kings, and emperors. As to a change of mind in theſe men, who conſider infamy as honour, degradation as preferment, bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to low tyrants as liberty, and the practical ſcorn and contumely of their upſtart maſters, as marks of reſpect and homage, I look upon it as abſolutely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable. Theſe madmen, to be cured, muſt firſt, like other madmen, be ſubdued. The ſound part of the community, which I believe to be large, but by
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:0244800202:180"/>
no means the largeſt part, has been taken by ſurpriſe, and is disjointed, terrified, and diſarmed. That ſound part of the community muſt firſt be put into a better condition, before it can do any thing in the way of deliberation or of perſuaſion. This muſt be an act of power, as well as of wiſdom; of power, in the hands of firm, determined patriots, who can diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the miſled from traitors, who will regulate the ſtate (if ſuch ſhould be their fortune) with a diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating, manly, and provident mercy; men who are purged of the ſurfeit and indigeſtion of ſyſtems, if ever they have been admitted into the habits of their minds; men who will lay the foundation of a real reform, in effacing every veſtige of that philoſophy which pretends to have made diſcoveries in the <hi>terra auſtralis</hi> of morality; men who will fix the ſtate upon theſe baſes of morals and politics, which are our old, and immemorial, and, I hope, will be our eternal poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>This power, to ſuch men, muſt come from <hi>without.</hi> It may be given to you in pity; for ſurely no nation ever called ſo pathetically on the compaſſion of all its neighbours. It may be given by thoſe neighbours on motives of ſafety to themſelves. Never ſhall I think any country in Europe to be ſecure, whilſt there is eſtabliſhed, in the very centre of it, a ſtate (if ſo it may be called) founded on principles of anarchy, and which is, in reality, a college of armed fanatics, for the propagation of the principles of aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſination, robbery, rebellion, fraud, faction, oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and impiety. Mahomet, hid, as for a time he was, in the bottom of the ſands of Arabia, had his ſpirit and character been diſcovered, would have been on object of precaution to provident minds. What if he had erected his frantic ſtandard for the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Chriſtian religion in <hi>luce Aſioe,</hi> in the midſt of the then noon-day ſplendor of the then civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized world?

ought not now, in my opinion, to ſuffer all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies and commonwealths to be ſwallowed up in the gulph of this polluted anarchy.

There is a power always on the watch, qualified and diſpoſed to profit of every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture, to eſtabliſh its own principles and modes of miſchief, wherever it can hope for ſucceſs.

            <head>REVENUE (FRENCH.)</head>
            <p>I SHALL now ſay ſomething of the ability ſhewed by your legiſlators with regard to the revenue.</p>
            <p>In their proceedings relative to this object, if poſſible, ſtill fewer traces appear of political judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or financial reſource. When the ſtates met, it ſeemed to be the great object to improve the ſyſtem of revenue, to enlarge its connexion, to cleanſe it of oppreſſion and vexation, and to eſtabliſh it on the moſt ſolid footing. Great were the expectations en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained on that head throughout Europe. It was by this grand arrangement that France was to ſtand or fall; and this became, in my opinion, very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, the teſt by which the ſkill and patriotiſm of thoſe who ruled in that aſſembly would be tried. The revenue of the ſtate is the ſtate. In effect all depends upon it, whether for ſupport or for refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. The dignity of every occupation wholly depends upon the quantity and the kind of virtue that may be exerted in it. As all great qualities of the mind which operate in public, and are not merely ſuffering and paſſive, require force for their diſplay, I had almoſt ſaid for their unequivocal exiſtence, the revenue, which is the ſpring of all power, becomes in its adminiſtration the ſphere of every active vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Public virtue, being of a nature magnificent and ſplendid, inſtituted for great things, and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant about great concerns, requires abundant ſcope and room, and cannot ſpread and grow under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, and in circumſtances ſtraitened, narrow,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:0244800202:184"/>
and ſordid. Through the revenue alone, the body politic can act in its true genius and character, and therefore it will diſplay juſt as much of its col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective virtue, and as much of that virtue which may characteriſe thoſe who move it, and are, as it were, its life and guiding principle, as it is poſſeſſed of a juſt revenue. For from hence not only magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and liberality, and beneficence, and fortitude, and providence, and the tutelary protection of all good arts, derive their food, and the growth of their organs, but continence, and ſelf-denial, and labour, and vigilance, and frugality, and whatever elſe there is in which the mind ſhews itſelf above the appetite, are no where more in their proper element than in the proviſion and diſtribution of the public wealth. It is therefore not without reaſon that the ſcience of ſpeculative and practical finance, which muſt take to its aid ſo many auxiliary branches of knowledge, ſtands high in the eſtimation not only of the ordinary ſort, but of the wiſeſt and beſt men; and as this ſcience has grown with the progreſs of its object, the proſperity and improvement of nations has generally encreaſed with the encreaſe of their revenues; and they will both continue to grow and flouriſh, as long as the balance between what is left to ſtrengthen the efforts of individuals, and what is collected for the common efforts of the ſtate, bear to each other a due reciprocal proportion, and are kept in a cloſe correſpondence and communication. And perhaps it may be owing to the greatneſs of revenues, and to the urgency of ſtate neceſſities, that old abuſes in the conſtitution of finances are diſcovered, and their true nature and rational theory comes to be more perfectly underſtood; inſomuch, that a ſmaller reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue might have been more diſtreſſing in one period than a far greater is found to be in another; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate wealth even remaining the ſame.—<bibl>

            <head>RUSSEL (HOUSE OF.) Mr. Burke contraſts his own Merit with that of the Founder of the Houſe of Ruſſel.</head>
            <p>THE merit of the origin of his Grace's (Bedford) fortune was in being a favourite and chief adviſer to a prince, who left no liberty to their native country. My endeavour was to obtain liberty for the municipal country in which I was born, and for all deſcriptions and denominations in it.—Mine was to ſupport with unrelaxing vigilance every right, every privilege, every franchiſe, in this my adopted, my dearer and more comprehenſive country; and not only to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve thoſe rights in this chief feat of empire, but in every nation, in every land, in every climate, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and religion, in the vaſt domain that ſtill is under the protection, and the larger that was once under the protection, of the Britiſh crown.</p>
            <p>His founder's merits were, by arts in which he ſerved his maſter and made his fortune, to bring po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:0244800202:186"/>
wretchedneſs and depopulation on his country. Mine were under a benevolent prince, in promoting the commerce, manufactures and agriculture of his kingdom; in which his majeſty ſhews an eminent example, who even in his amuſements is a patriot, and in hours of leiſure an improver of his native ſoil.</p>
            <p>His founder's merit, was the merit of a gentleman raiſed by the arts of a court, and the protection of a Wolſey, to the eminence of a great and potent lord. His merit in that eminence was by inſtigating a tyrant to injuſtice, to provoke a people to rebellion.—My merit was, to awaken the ſober part of the country, that they might put themſelves on their guard againſt any one potent lord, or any greater number of potent lords, or any combination of great leading men of any ſort, if ever they ſhould attempt to proceed in the ſame courſes, but in the reverſe order, that is, by inſtigating a corrupt populace to rebellion, and, through that rebellion, ſhould intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a tyranny yet worſe than the tyranny which his Grace's anceſtor ſupported, and of which he profited in the manner we behold in the deſpotiſm of Henry the Eighth.</p>
            <p>The political merit of the firſt penſioner of his Grace's houſe, was that of being concerned as a counſellor of ſtate in adviſing, and in his perſon exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the conditions of a diſhonourable peace with France; the ſurrendering the fortreſs of Boulogne, then our out guard on the continent. By that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render, Calais, the key of France, and the bridle in the mouth of that power, was, not many years after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, finally loſt. My merit has been in reſiſting the power and pride of France, under any form of it's rule; but in oppoſing it with the greateſt zeal and earneſtneſs, when that rule appeared in the worſt form it could aſſume; the worſt indeed which the prime cauſe and principle of all evil could poſſibly give it. It was my endeavour by every means to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite a ſpirit in the houſe, where I had the honour of
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:0244800202:187"/>
a ſeat, for carrying on with early vigour and deciſion, the moſt clearly juſt and neceſſary war, that this or any nation ever carried on; in order to ſave my country from the iron yoke of it's power, and from the more dreadful contagion of its principles; to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, while they can be preſerved pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted, the ancient, inbred integrity, piety, good nature, and good humour of the people of England, from the dreadful peſtilence which beginning in France, threatens to lay waſte the whole moral, and in a great degree the whole phyſical world, having done both in the focus of it's moſt intenſe malignity.</p>
            <p>The labours of his Grace's founder merited the curſes, not loud but deep, of the Commons of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, on whom <hi>he</hi> and his maſter had effected a <hi>complete parliamentary reform,</hi> in making them in their ſlavery and humiliation, the true and adequate repreſentatives of a debaſed, degraded, and undone people. My merits were, in having had an active, though not always an oſtentatious ſhare, in every one act, without exception, of undiſputed conſtitutional utility in my time, and in having ſupported on all occaſions, the authority, the efficiency, and the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of the Commons of Great Britain. I ended my ſervices by a recorded and fully reaſoned aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on their own journals of their conſtitutional rights, and a vindication of their conſtitutional con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. I laboured in all things to merit their inward approbation, and (along with the aſſiſtants of the largeſt, the greateſt, and beſt of my endeavours) I received their free, unbiaſſed, public, and ſolemn thanks.</p>
            <p>Thus ſtands the account of the comparative merits of the crown grants which compoſe the duke of Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford's fortune as balanced againſt mine. In the name of common ſenſe, why ſhould the duke of Bedford think, that none but of the houſe of Ruſſel are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to the favour of the crown? Why ſhould he imagine that no king of England has been capable of judging of merit but king Henry the Eighth? Indeed,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:0244800202:188"/>
he will pardon me; he is a little miſtaken; all virtue did not end in the firſt earl of Bedford. All diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment did not loſe its viſion when his creator cloſed his eyes. Let him remit his rigour on the diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between merit and reward in others, and they will make no enquiry into the origin of his fortune. They will regard with much more ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, as he will contemplate with infinitely more advantage, whatever in his pedigree has been dulci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by an expoſure to the influence of heaven in a long flow of generations, from the hard, acidulous, metallic tincture of the ſpring. It is little to be doubted, that ſeveral of his forefathers in that long ſeries, have degenerated into honour and virtue. Let the duke of Bedford (I am ſure he will) reject with ſcorn and horror, the counſels of the lecturers, thoſe wicked panders to avarice and ambition, who would tempt him in the troubles of his country, to ſeek another enormous fortune from the forfeitures of another nobility, and the plunder of another church. Let him (and I truſt that yet he will) em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy all the energy of his youth, and all the reſources of his wealth, to cruſh rebellious principles which have no foundation in morals, and rebellious move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that have no provocation in tyranny.</p>
            <p>Then will be forgot the rebellions, which, by a doubtful priority in crime, his anceſtor had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked and extinguiſhed. On ſuch a conduct in the noble duke, many of his countrymen might, and with ſome excuſe might, give way to the enthuſiaſm of their gratitude, and in the daſhing ſtyle of ſome of the old declaimers, cry out, that if the fates had found no other way in which they could give a<note n="*" place="bottom">At ſi non aliam venturo fata Neroni, &amp;c.</note> duke of Bedford and his opulence as props to a tottering world, then the butchery of the duke of Buckingham might be tolerated; it might be regarded even with complacency, whilſt in the heir of confiſcation they
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:0244800202:189"/>
ſaw the ſympathizing comforter of the martyrs, who ſuffer under the cruel confiſcation of this day; whilſt they beheld with admiration his zealous protection of the virtuous and loyal nobility of France, and his manly ſupport of his brethren, the yet ſtanding nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and gentry of his native land. Then his Grace's merit would be pure and new, and ſharp as freſh from the mint of honour. As he pleaſed he might reflect honour on his predeceſſors, or throw it forward on thoſe who were to ſucceed him. He might be the propagater of the ſtock of honour, or the root of it, as he thought proper.—<bibl>

            <head>REFORMAMION. Short View of the Reformation.</head>
            <p>GENTLEMEN, the condition of our nature is ſuch, that we buy our bleſſings at a price. The Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, one of the greateſt periods of human improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was a time of trouble and confuſion. The vaſt ſtructure of ſuperſtition and tyranny, which had been for ages in rearing, and which was combined with the intereſt of the great and of the many; which was moulded into the laws, the manners, and civil inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of nations, and blended with the frame and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy of ſtates; could not be brought to the ground without a fearful ſtruggle; nor could it fall without a violent concuſſion of itſelf and all about it. When this great revolution was attempted in a more regular mode by government, it was oppoſed by plots and ſeditions of the people; when by popular efforts, it was repreſſed as rebellion by the hand of power; and bloody executions (often bloodily returned) mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the whole of its progreſs through all its ſtages. The affairs of religion, which are no longer heard of in the tumult of our preſent contentions, made a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ingredient in the wars and politics of that time; the enthuſiaſm of religion threw a gloom over the politics; and political intereſts poiſoned and perverted
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:0244800202:190"/>
the ſpirit of religion upon all ſides. The Proteſtant religion in that violent ſtruggle, infected, as the Popiſh had been before, by worldly intereſts and worldly paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, became a perſecutor in its turn, ſometimes of the new ſects, which carried their own principles fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than it was convenient to the original reformers; and always of the body from whom they parted; and this perſecuting ſpirit aroſe, not only, from the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of retaliation, but from the mercileſs policy of fear.</p>
            <p>It was long before the ſpirit of true piety and true wiſdom, involved in the principles of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, could be depurated from the dregs and feculence of the contention with which it was carried through. However, until this be done, the Reformation is not complete; and thoſe who think themſelves good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, from their animoſity to others, are, in that reſpect, no Proteſtants at all. It was at firſt thought neceſſary, perhaps, to oppoſe to Popery another Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, to get the better of it. Whatever was the cauſe, laws were made in many countries, and in this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in particular, againſt Papiſts, which are as bloody as any of thoſe which had been enacted by the popiſh princes and ſtates; and where thoſe laws were not bloody, in my opinion, they were worſe; as they were ſlow, cruel outrages on our nature, and kept men alive only to inſult in their perſons, every one of the rights and feelings of humanity.

The Elector is a Catholic; the people of Saxony are, ſix-ſevenths at the very leaſt, Proteſtants. He <hi>muſt</hi> continue a Catholic, according to the Poliſh law, if he accepts that crown. The pride of the Saxons, formerly flattered by having a crown in the Houſe of their Prince, though an honour which coſt them dear; the German probity, fidelity, and loyalty; the weight of the conſtitution of the Empire under the Treaty of Weſtphalia; the good temper and good nature of the Princes of the Houſe of Saxony; had formerly removed from the people all apprehenſion with regard to their religion, and kept them perfectly quiet, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, and even affectionate.

            <head>SOCIETY A Contract.</head>
            <p>SOCIETY is indeed a contract. Subordinate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts for objects of more occaſional intereſt may be depoſited at pleaſure, but the ſtate ought not to be conſidered as nothing better than a partnerſhip agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in a trade of pepper and coffee, calico or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:0244800202:193"/>
or ſome other ſuch low concern, to be taken up for a little temporary intereſt, and to be diſſolved by the fancy of the parties. It is to be looked on with other reverence; becauſe it is not a partnerſhip in things ſubſervient only to the groſs animal exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a temporary and periſhable nature. It is a partnerſhip in all ſcience; a partnerſhip in all art; a partnerſhip in every virtue, and in all perfection. As the ends of ſuch a partnerſhip cannot be obtained in many generations, it becomes a partnerſhip not only between thoſe who are living, but between thoſe who are living, thoſe who are dead, and thoſe who are to be born. Each contract of each particular ſtate is but a clauſe in the great primaeval contract of eternal ſociety, linking the lower with the higher natures, connecting the viſible and inviſible world, according to a fixed compact ſanctioned by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable oath which holds all phyſical and all moral natures, each in their appointed place. This law is not ſubject to the will of thoſe, who by an obligation above them, and infinitely ſuperior, are bound to ſubmit their will to that law. The municipal corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of that univerſal kingdom are not morally at liberty at their pleaſure, and on their ſpeculations of a contingent improvement, wholly to ſeparate and tear aſunder the bands of their ſubordinate commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and to diſſolve it into an unſocial, uncivil, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connected chaos of elementary principles. It is the firſt and ſupreme neceſſity only, a neceſſity that is not choſen but chooſes, a neceſſity paramount to deliberation, that admits no diſcuſſion, and demands no evidence, which alone can juſtify a reſort to anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy. This neceſſity is no exception to the rule; becauſe this neceſſity itſelf is a part too of that moral and phyſical diſpoſition of things to which man muſt be obedient by conſent or force; but if that which is only ſubmiſſion to neceſſity ſhould be made the object of choice, the law is broken, nature is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed, and the rebellious are outlawed, caſt forth,

            <p>THE moſt obvious diviſion of ſociety is into rich and poor; and it is no leſs obvious, that the number of the former bear a great diſproportion to thoſe of the latter. The whole buſineſs of the poor is to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter to the idleneſs, folly, and luxury of the rich; and that of the rich, in return, is to find the beſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of confirming the ſlavery and increaſing the burthens of the poor. In a ſtate of nature, it is an invariable law, that a man's acquiſitions are in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to his labours. In a ſtate of artificial ſociety, it is a law as conſtant and as invariable, that thoſe who labour moſt, enjoy the feweſt things; and that thoſe who labour not at all, have the greateſt number of enjoyments. A conſtitution of things this, ſtrange and ridiculous beyond expreſſion. We ſcarce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a thing when we are told it, which we actually ſee before our eyes every day without being in the leaſt ſurprized. I ſuppoſe that there are in Great-Britain upwards of an hundred thouſand people em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in lead, tin, iron, copper, and coal mines; theſe unhappy wretches ſcarce ever ſee the light of the ſun; they are buried in the bowels of the earth; there they work at a ſevere and diſmal taſk, without the leaſt proſpect of being delivered from it; they ſubſiſt upon the coarſeſt and worſt ſort of fare; they have their health miſerably impaired, and their lives cut ſhort, by being perpetually confined in the cloſe vapour of theſe malignant minerals. An hundred thouſand more at leaſt are tortured without remiſſion by the ſuffocating ſmoak, intenſe fires, and conſtant drudgery neceſſary in refining and managing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts of thoſe mines. If any man informed us that two hundred thouſand innocent perſons were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to ſo intolerable ſlavery, how ſhould we pity the unhappy ſufferers, and how great would be

            <p>IN the ſtate of nature, without queſtion, mankind was ſubjected to many and great inconveniencies. Want of union, want of mutual aſſiſtance, want of a common arbitrator to reſort to in their differences. Theſe were evils which they could not but have felt pretty ſeverely on many occaſions. The original children of the earth lived with their brethren of the other kinds in much equality. Their diet muſt have been confined almoſt wholly to the vegetable kind; and the ſame tree, which in its flouriſhing ſtate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them berries, in its decay gave them an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation. The mutual deſires of the ſexes uniting their bodies and affections, and the children, which were the reſults of theſe intercourſes, introduced firſt the notion of ſociety, and taught its conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies.

not to be ſatisfied with any reaſonable acquirement; not to compound with our condition; but to loſe all we have gained by an inſatiable purſuit after more. Man found a conſiderable advantage by this union of many perſons to form one family; he therefore judged that he would find his account proportionably in an union of many families into one body politic.

<pb n="373" facs="tcp:0244800202:199"/>
in human nature, which will cauſe innumerable broils, place men in what ſituation you pleaſe; but owning this, I ſtill inſiſt in charging it to political re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations, that theſe broils are ſo frequent, ſo cruel, and attended with conſequences ſo deplorable. In a ſtate of nature, it had been impoſſible to find a number of men, ſufficient for ſuch ſlaughters, agreed in the ſame bloody purpoſe; or allowing that they might have come to ſuch an agreement, (an impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſuppoſition) yet the means that ſimple nature has ſupplied them with, are by no means adequate to ſuch an end; many ſcratches, many bruiſes undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly would be received upon all hands; but only a few, a very few deaths. Society, and politics, which have given us theſe deſtructive views, have given us alſo the means of ſatisfying them. From the earlieſt dawnings of policy to this day, the invention of men has been ſharpening and improving the myſtery of murder, from the firſt rude eſſays of clubs and ſtones, to the preſent perfection of gunnery, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noneering, bombarding, mining, and all theſe ſpecies of artificial, learned, and refined cruelty, in which we are now ſo expert, and which make a principal part of what politicians have taught us to believe is our principal glory.</p>

            <head>SOCIETIES (POPULAR.) Remarks on the Conſtitutional and Revolution Societies.</head>
            <p>I certainly have the honour to belong to more clubs than one, in which the conſtitution of this kingdom, and the principles of the glorious revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are held in high reverence: and I reckon myſelf among the moſt forward in my zeal for maintaining that conſtitution and thoſe principles in the utmoſt purity and vigour. It is becauſe I do ſo, that I think it neceſſary for me, that there ſhould be no miſtake. Thoſe who cultivate the memory of our revolution, and thoſe who are attached to the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of this kingdom, will take good care how they are involved with perſons who, under the pretext of zeal towards the revolution and conſtitution, too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently wander from their true principles; and are ready, on every occaſion, to depart from the firm, but cautious and deliberate ſpirit which produced the one, and which preſides in the other. Before I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to anſwer the more material particulars in your letter, I ſhall beg leave to give you ſuch information as I have been able to obtain of the two clubs which have thought proper, as bodies, to interfere in the concerns of France; firſt aſſuring you, that I am not, and that I have never been, a member of either of thoſe ſocieties.</p>
            <p>The firſt, calling itſelf the Conſtitutional Society, or Society for Conſtitutional Information, or by ſome ſuch title, is, I believe, of ſeven or eight years ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The inſtitution of this ſociety appears to be of a charitable, and ſo far of a laudable, nature: it was intended for the circulation, at the expence of the
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:0244800202:201"/>
members, of many books, which few others would be at the expence of buying; and which might lie on the hands of the bookſellers, to the great loſs of an uſeful body of men. Whether the books ſo charitably circulated, were ever as charitably read, is more than I know. Poſſibly ſeveral of them have been exported to France; and, like goods not in requeſt here, may with you have found a market. I have heard much talk of the lights to be drawn from books that are ſent from hence. What im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements they have had in their paſſage (as it is ſaid ſome liquors are meliorated by croſſing the ſea) I cannot tell: but I never heard a man of common judgment, or the leaſt degree of information, ſpeak a word in praiſe of the greater part of the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions circulated by that ſociety; nor have their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings been accounted, except by ſome of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as of any ſerious conſequence.</p>
            <p>Your national aſſembly ſeems to entertain much the ſame opinion that I do of this poor charitable club. As a nation, you reſerved the whole ſtock of your eloquent acknowledgments for the Revolution Society; when their fellows in the Conſtitutional were, in equity, entitled to ſome ſhare. Since you have ſelected the Revolution Society as the great object of your national thanks and praiſes, you will think me excuſeable in making its late conduct the ſubject of my obſervations. The national aſſembly of France has given importance to theſe gentlemen by adopting them; and they return the favour, by acting as a committee in England for extending the principles of the national aſſembly. Henceforward we muſt conſider them as a kind of privileged per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; as no inconſiderable members in the diplomatic body. This is one among the revolutions which have given ſplendor to obſcurity, and diſtinction to undiſcerned merit. Until very lately I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect to have heard of this club. I am quite ſure that it never occupied a moment of my thoughts;
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:0244800202:202"/>
nor, I believe, thoſe of any perſon out of their own ſet. I find, upon enquiry, that on the anniverſary of the revolution in 1688, a club of diſſenters, but of what denomination I know not, have long had the cuſtom of hearing a ſermon in one of their churches; and that afterwards they ſpent the day cheerfully, as other clubs do, at the tavern. But I never heard that any public meaſure, or political ſyſtem, much leſs that the merits of the conſtitution of any foreign nation, had been the ſubject of a formal proceeding at their feſtivals; until, to my inexpreſſible ſurprize, I found them in a ſort of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic capacity, by a congratulatory addreſs, giving an authoritative ſanction to the proceedings of the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal aſſembly in France.</p>
            <p>In the antient principles and conduct of the club, ſo far at leaſt as they were declared, I ſee nothing to which I could take exception. I think it very probable, that for ſome purpoſe, new members may have entered among them; and that ſome truly chriſtian politicians, who love to diſpenſe benefits, but are careful to conceal the hand which diſtributes the dole, may have made them the inſtruments of their pious deſigns. Whatever I may have reaſon to ſuſpect concerning private management, I ſhall ſpeak of nothing as of a certainty but what is public.</p>
            <p>For one, I ſhould be ſorry to be thought, directly or indirectly, concerned in their proceedings. I certainly take my full ſhare, along with the reſt of the world, in my individual and private capacity, in ſpeculating on what has been done, or is doing, on the public ſtage; in any place antient or modern; in the republic of Rome, or the republic of Paris: but having no general apoſtolical miſſion, being a citizen of a particular ſtate, and being bound up in a conſiderable degree, by its public will, I ſhould think it at leaſt improper and irregular for me to open a formal public correſpondence with the actual government of a foreign nation, without the expreſs authority of the government under which I live.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="377" facs="tcp:0244800202:203"/>I ſhould be ſtill more unwilling to enter into that correſpondence, under any thing like an equivocal deſcription, which to many, unacquainted with our uſages, might make the addreſs, in which I joined, appear as the act of perſons in ſome ſort of corporate capacity, acknowledged by the laws of this kingdom, and authorized to ſpeak the ſenſe of ſome part of it. On account of the ambiguity and uncertainty of unauthorized general deſcriptions, and of the deceit which may be practiſed under them, and not from mere formality, the Houſe of Commons would reject the moſt ſneaking petition for the moſt trifling ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, under that mode of ſignature to which you have thrown open the folding-doors of your preſence chamber, and have uſhered into your National Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, with as much ceremony and parade, and with as great a buſtle of applauſe, as if you had been viſited by the whole repreſentave majeſty of the whole Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh nation. If what this ſociety has thought proper to ſend forth had been a piece of argument, it would have ſignified little whoſe argument it was. It would be neither the more nor the leſs convincing on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the party it came from. But this is only a vote and reſolution. It ſtands ſolely on authority; and in this caſe it is the mere authority of indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals, few of whom appear. Their ſignatures ought, in my opinion, to have been annexed to their inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The world would then have the means of knowing how many they are; who they are; and of what value their opinions may be, from their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal abilities, from their knowledge, their experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or their lead and authority in this ſtate. To me, who am but a plain man, the proceeding looks a little too refined, and too ingenious; it has too much the air of a political ſtratagem, adopted for the ſake of giving, under an high ſounding name, an importance to the public declarations of this club, which, when the matter came to be cloſely inſpected, they did not altogether ſo well deſerve. It is a policy that has very much the complexion of a fraud.—<bibl>

An obſervation on this difference will let us into the true ſpirit of their conduct. Every thing which they have done, or continue to do, in order to obtain and keep their power, is by the moſt common arts. They proceed exactly as their anceſtors of ambition have done before them. Trace them through all their artifices, frauds, and violences, you can find nothing at all that is new. They follow precedents and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples with the punctilious exactneſs of a pleader. They never depart an iota from the authentic formu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las of tyranny and uſurpation. But in all the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations relative to the public good, the ſpirit has been the very reverſe of this. There they commit the whole to the mercy of untried ſpeculations; they abandon the deareſt intereſts of the public to thoſe looſe theories, to which none of them would chuſe to truſt the ſlighteſt of his private concerns. They make this difference, becauſe in their deſire of obtaining and ſecuring power they are thoroughly in earneſt; there they travel in the beaten road.

            <p>THE worſt effect of all their proceeding was on their military, which was rendered an army for every purpoſe but that of defence. If the queſtion was, whether ſoldiers were to forget they were citizens, as an abſtract propoſition, I could have no difference about it; though, as it is uſual, when abſtract prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are to be applied, much is to be thought on the manner of uniting the character of citizen and ſoldier. But as applied to the events which had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in France, where the abſtract principle it cloathed with its circumſtances, I think that my friend (Mr. Fox) would agree with me, that what was done there furniſhed no matter of exultation, either in the act or the example. Theſe ſoldiers were not citizens; but baſe hireling mutineers, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary ſordid deſerters, wholly deſtitute of any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable principles. Their conduct was one of the fruits of that anarchic ſpirit, from the evils of which a democracy itſelf was to be reſorted to by thoſe who were the leaſt diſpoſed to that form as a ſort of refuge. It was not an army in corps and with diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and embodied under the reſpectable patriot citizens of the ſtate in reſiſting tyranny. Nothing like it It was the caſe of common ſoldiers deſerting from their officers, to join a furious, licentious popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace. It was a deſertion to a cauſe, the real object of which was to level all thoſe inſtitutions, and to break all thoſe connections, natural and civil, that regulate and hold together the community by a chain of ſubordination; to raiſe ſoldiers againſt their offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers;

When we have our true ſituation diſtinctly preſented to us, if we reſolve with a blind and headlong violence, to reſiſt the admonitions of our friends, and to caſt ourſelves into the hands of our potent and irreconcileable foes, then, and not till then, the miniſters ſtand acquitted before God and man, for whatever may come.—<bibl>

            <p>IN the eſtates of the church, notwithſtanding their ſtrictneſs in baniſhing the French out of that country, there are not wanting the ſeeds of a revolution. The ſpirit of Nepotiſm prevails there nearly as ſtrong as ever. Every pope of courſe is to give origin or reſtoration to a great family, by the means of large donations. The foreign revenues have long been gradually on the decline, and ſeem now in a manner dried up. To ſupply this defect the reſource of vexatious and impolitic jobbing at home, if any thing, is rather encreaſed than leſſened. Various, well intended but ill underſtood practices, ſome of them exiſting, in their ſpirit at leaſt, from the time of the old Roman empire, ſtill prevail; and that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is as blindly attached to old abuſive cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, as others are wildly diſpoſed to all ſorts of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations and experiments. Theſe abuſes were leſs felt whilſt the pontificate drew riches from abroad, which in ſome meaſure counterbalanced the evils of their remiſs and jobbiſh government at home. But now it can ſubſiſt only on the reſources of domeſtic management; and abuſes in that management of courſe will be more intimately and more ſeverely felt.</p>
            <p>In the midſt of the apparently torpid languor of the eccleſiaſtical ſtate, thoſe who have had oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of a near obſervation, have ſeen a little rip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling in that ſmooth water, which indicates ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing alive under it. There is in the eccleſiaſtical ſtate, a perſonage who ſeems capable of acting (but with more force and ſteadineſs) the part of the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune Rienzi. The people once inflamed will not be deſtitute of a leader. They have ſuch an one already in the Cardinal or Archbiſhop <hi>Buon Campagna.</hi> He is, of all men, if I am not ill-informed, the moſt turbulent, ſeditious, intriguing, bold, and deſperate.
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:0244800202:209"/>
He is not at all made for a Roman of the preſent day. I think he lately held the firſt office of their ſtate, that of Great Chamberlain, which is equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to High Treaſurer. At preſent he is out of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, and in diſgrace. If he ſhould be elected pope, or even come to have any weight with a new pope, he will infallibly conjure up a democratic ſpirit in that country. He may indeed be able to effect it without theſe advantages. The next interregnum will probably ſhew more of him. There may be others of the ſame character, who have not come to my knowledge. This much is certain, that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man people, if once the blind reverence they bear to the ſanctity of the pope, which is their only bridle, ſhould relax, are naturally turbulent, ferocious, and headlong, whilſt the police is defective, and the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment feeble and reſourceleſs beyond all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.—<bibl>

There was in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Nova Scotia, one little neglected corner; the country of the <hi>neutral French;</hi> which having the good fortune to eſcape the foſtering care both of France and England, and to have been ſhut out from the protection and regulation of Councils of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and of Boards of Trade, did, in ſilence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out notice, and without aſſiſtance, increaſe to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable degree. But it ſeems our nation had more ſkill and ability in deſtroying, than in ſettling a colony. In the laſt war we did, in my opinion, moſt inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly, and upon pretences that in the eye of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man are not worth a farthing, root out this poor innocent deſerving people, whom our utter inability to govern, or to reconcile, gave us no ſort of right to extirpate.

It has been formed by overflowings from the exuberant population of New England, and by emigration, from other parts of Nova Scotia, of fugitives from the protection of the Board of Trade.—<bibl>

            <head>SOVEREIGN JURISDICTIONS (SEE KING OF GREAT BRITAIN.)</head>
            <p>WITH regard to the ſovereign juriſdictions, I muſt obſerve, Sir, that whoever takes a view of this kingdom in a curſory manner, will imagine, that he beholds a ſolid, compacted, uniform ſyſtem of monarchy; in which all inferior juriſdictions are but as rays diverging from one center. But on examining it more nearly, you find much eccentricity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. It is not a monarchy in ſtrictneſs. But, as in the Saxon times this country was an heptarchy, it is now a ſtrange ſort of <hi>pentarchy.</hi> It is divided into five ſeveral diſtinct principalities, beſides the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme. There is indeed this difference from the Saxon times, that as in the itinerant exhibitions of the ſtage, for want of a complete company, they are obliged to throw a variety of parts on their chief performer; ſo our ſovereign condeſcends himſelf to act, not only the principal but all the ſubordinate parts in the play. He condeſcends to diſſipate the royal character, and to trifle with thoſe light ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate

Croſs a brook, and you loſe the king of England; but you have ſome comfort in coming again under his majeſty, though <q rend="inline">"ſhorn of his beams,"</q> and no more than prince of Wales. Go to the north, and you find him dwindled to a duke of Lancaſter; turn to the weſt of that north, and he pops upon you in the humble character of Earl of Cheſter. Travel a few miles on, the earl of Cheſter diſappears; and the king ſurpriſes you again as count palatine of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter. If you travel beyond Mount Edgecombe, you find him once more in his incognito, and he is duke of Cornwall. So that, quite fatigued and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated with this dull variety, you are infinitely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed when you return to the ſphere of his proper ſplendor, and behold your amiable ſovereign in his true, ſimple, undiſguiſed, native character of majeſty.—<bibl>

            <head>SPAIN. Preſent State of that Country.</head>
            <p>AS to Spain, it is a nerveleſs country. It does not poſſeſs the uſe, it only ſuffers the abuſe of a nobility. For ſome time, and even before the ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Bourbon dynaſty, that body has been ſyſtematically lowered, and rendered incapable by excluſion, and for incapacity excluded from affairs. In this circle the body is in a manner annihilated—and ſo little means have they of any weighty exertion either to controul or to ſupport the crown, that if they at all interfere, it is only by abetting deſperate and mobbiſh inſurrections, like that at Madrid which drove Squillace from his place. Florida Blanca is a creature of office, and has little connexion, and no ſympathy with that body.</p>
            <p>As to the clergy, they are the only thing in Spain that looks like an independent order, and they are
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:0244800202:217"/>
kept in ſome reſpect by the inquiſition, the ſole but unhappy reſource of public tranquillity and order now remaining in Spain. As in Venice, it is become moſtly an engine of ſtate, which indeed to a degree it has always been in Spain. It wars no longer with Jews and Heretics: It has no ſuch war to carry on. It's great object is to keep atheiſtic and republican doctrines from making their way in that kingdom. No French book upon any ſubject can enter there which does not contain ſuch matter. In Spain the clergy are of moment from their influence, but at the ſame time with the envy and jealouſy that attend great riches and power. Though the crown has by management with the Pope got a very great ſhare of the eccleſiaſtical revenues into it's own hands, much ſtill remains to them. There will always be about that court thoſe who look out to a farther diviſion of the church property as a reſource, and to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by ſhorter methods than thoſe of negotiations with the clergy and their chief. But at preſent I think it likely that they will ſtop, leſt the buſineſs ſhould be taken out of their hands; and leſt that body in which remains the only life that exiſts in Spain, and is not a fever, may with their property loſe all the influence neceſſary to preſerve the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, or being poor and deſperate, may employ whatever influence remains to them as active agents in it's deſtruction.</p>
            <p>The Caſtilians have ſtill remaining a good deal of their old character, their <hi>Gravidad, Lealdad,</hi> and <hi>il Timor de Dios;</hi> but that character neither is, or ever was exactly true, except of the Caſtilians only. The ſeveral kingdoms which compoſe Spain, have perhaps ſome features which run through the whole; but they are in many particulars as different as nations who go by different names; the Catalans, for inſtance, and the Arragonians too, in a good meaſure have the ſpirit of the Miquelets, and much more of repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licaniſm than of an attachment to royalty. They
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:0244800202:218"/>
are more in the way of trade and intercourſe with France; and upon the leaſt internal movement, will diſcloſe and probably let looſe a ſpirit that may throw the whole Spaniſh monarchy into convulſions.</p>
            <p>It is a melancholy reflection that the ſpirit of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lioration which has been going on in that part of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, more or leſs during this century, and the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſchemes very lately on foot for further advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are all put a ſtop to at once. Reformation certainly is nearly connected with innovation—and where that latter comes in for too large a ſhare, thoſe who undertake to improve their country may riſque their own ſafety. In times where the correction, which includes the confeſſion of an abuſe, is turned to criminate the authority which has long ſuffered it, rather than to honour thoſe who would amend it (which is the ſpirit of this malignant French diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper) every ſtep out of the common courſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes critical, and renders it a taſk full of peril for princes of moderate talents to engage in great under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings. At preſent the only ſafety of Spain is the old national hatred to the French. How far that can be depended upon, if any great ferments ſhould be excited, it is impoſſible to ſay.—<bibl>

            <head>SUBLIME. The Sublime and Beautiful compared.</head>
            <p>ON cloſing this general view of beauty, it natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally occurs, that we ſhould compare it with the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime; and in this compariſon there appears a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able contraſt. For ſublime objects are vaſt in their dimenſions, beautiful ones comparatively ſmall: beauty ſhould be ſmooth and poliſhed; the great, rugged and negligent; beauty ſhould ſhun the right line, yet deviate from it inſenſibly; the great, in many caſes, loves the right line; and when it devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates, it often makes a ſtrong deviation: beauty ſhould not be obſcure; the great ought to be dark and
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:0244800202:219"/>
gloomy: beauty ſhould be light and delicate; the great ought to be ſolid, and even maſſive. They are, indeed, ideas of a very different nature, one being founded on pain, the other on pleaſure; and however they may vary afterwards from the direct nature of their cauſes, yet theſe cauſes keep up an eternal diſtinction between them, a diſtinction never to be forgotten by any whoſe buſineſs it is to affect the paſſions. In the infinite variety of natural com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations, we muſt expect to find the qualities of things the moſt remote imaginable from each other united in the ſame object. We muſt expect alſo to find combinations of the ſame kind in the works of art. But when we conſider the power of an object upon our paſſions, we muſt know that when any thing is intended to affect the mind by the force of ſome predominant property, the affection produced is like to be the more uniform and perfect, if all the other properties or qualities of the object be of the ſame nature, and tending to the ſame deſign as the principal;
<q>
                  <l>If black and white blend, ſoften, and unite,</l>
                  <l>A thouſand ways, are there no black and white?</l>
               </q>
If the qualities of the ſublime and beautiful are ſometimes found united, does this prove that they are the ſame; does it prove that they are any way allied; does it prove even that they are not oppoſite and contradictory? Black and white may ſoften, may blend; but they are not therefore the ſame. Nor, when they are ſo ſoftened and blended with each other, or with different colours, is the power of black as black, or of white as white, ſo ſtrong as when each ſtands uniform and diſtinguiſhed.—<bibl>

Here is a very noble picture; and in what does this poetical picture conſiſt? in images of a tower, an archangel, the ſun riſing through miſts, or in an eclipſe, the ruin of monarchs, and the revolutions of kingdoms. The mind is hurried out of itſelf, by a crowd of great and confuſed images; which affect becauſe they are crowded and confuſed. For ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate them, and you loſe much of the greatneſs; and join them, and you infallibly loſe the clearneſs. The images raiſed by poetry are always of this obſcure kind; though in general the effects of poetry are by no means to be attributed to the images it raiſes. But painting, when we have allowed for the pleaſure of imitation, can only affect ſimply by the images it preſents; and even in painting, a judicious obſcurity in ſome things contributes to the effect of the picture; becauſe the images in painting are exactly ſimilar to thoſe in nature; and in nature dark, confuſed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain images have a greater power on the fancy to form the grander paſſions, than thoſe have which are more clear and determinate. But where and when this obſervation may be applied to practice, and how far it ſhall be extended, will be better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from the nature of the ſubject, and from the occaſion, than from any rules that can be given.</p>
            <p>I am ſenſible that this idea has met with oppoſition, and is likely ſtill to be rejected by ſeveral. But let it be conſidered, that hardly any thing can ſtrike the mind with its greatneſs, which does not make ſome ſort of approach towards infinity; which nothing can do whilſt we are able to perceive its bounds; but to fee an object diſtinctly, and to perceive its bounds, is one and the ſame thing. A clear idea is therefore another name for a-little idea. There is a paſſage in the book of Job amazingly ſublime, and this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limity is principally due to the terrible uncertainty of the thing deſcribed: <hi>In thoughts from the viſions of the night, when deep ſleep ſalleth upon men, fear came upon me and trembling, which made all my bones to</hi>
               <pb n="396" facs="tcp:0244800202:222"/>
               <hi>ſhake. Then a ſpirit paſſed before my face. The hair of my fleſh ſtood up. It ſtood ſtill,</hi> but I could not diſcern the form thereof; <hi>an image was before mine eyes; there was ſilence; and I heard a voice,—Shall mortal man be more juſt than God?</hi> We are firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the utmoſt ſolemnity for the viſion; we are firſt terrified, before we are let even into the obſcure cauſe of our emotion: but when this grand cauſe of terror makes its appearance, what is it? is it not wrapt up in the ſhades of its own incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible darkneſs, more aweful, more ſtriking, more terrible, than the livelieſt deſcription, than the cleareſt painting, could poſſibly repreſent it? When painters have attempted to give us clear repreſentations of theſe very fanciful and terrible ideas, they have, I think, almoſt always failed; inſomuch that I have been at a loſs, in all the pictures I have ſeen of hell, whether the painter did not intend ſomething ludicrous. Several painters have handled a ſubject of this kind with a view of aſſembling as many horrid phantoms as their imaginations could ſuggeſt; but all the deſigns I have chanced to meet of the temptations of St. Anthony, were rather a ſort of odd wild groteſques, than any thing capable of producing a ſerious paſſion. In all theſe ſubjects poetry is very happy. Its appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions, its chimeras, its harpies, its allegorical figures, are grand and affecting; and though Virgil's Fame, and Homer's Diſcord, are obſcure, they are magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent figures. Theſe figures in painting would be clear enough, but I fear they might become ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous.—<bibl>

            <p>As to Switzerland, it is a country whoſe long union, rather than its poſſible diviſion, is the matter of wonder. Here I know they entertain very ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine hopes. The aggregation to France of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocratic Swiſs republics appears to them to be a work half done by their very form; and it might ſeem to them rather an encreaſe of importance to theſe little commonwealths, than a derogation from their independency, or a change in the manner of their government. Upon any quarrel amongſt the cantons nothing is more likely than ſuch an event. As to the ariſtocratic republics, the general clamour and hatred which the French excite againſt the very name, (and with more facility and ſucceſs than againſt monarchs) and the utter impoſſibility of their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment making any ſort of reſiſtance againſt an inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, where they have no troops, and the people are all armed and trained, render their hopes in that quarter, far indeed from unfounded. It is certain that the republic of Berne thinks itſelf obliged to a vigilance next to hoſtile, and to impriſon or expel all the French whom they find in their territories. But indeed thoſe ariſtocracies which comprehend whatever is conſiderable, wealthy, and valuable in Switzerland, do now ſo wholly depend upon opinion, and the humour of their multitude, that the lighteſt puff of wind is ſufficient to blow them down. If France, under its ancient regimen, and upon the ancient principles of policy, was the ſupport of the Germanic conſtitution, it was much more ſo of that of Switzerland, which almoſt from the very origin of that confederacy reſted upon the cloſeneſs of its connection with France, on which the Swiſs cantons wholly repoſed themſelves for the preſervation of the parts of their body in their reſpective rights and permanent forms, as well as for the maintenance of all in their general independency.</p>

            <p>But to cut off all pretence for cavilling, I mean by the word Taſte, no more than that faculty or thoſe faculties of the mind, which are affected with, or which form a judgment of, the works of imagination and the elegant arts. This is, I think, the moſt general idea of that word, and what is the leaſt connected with any particular theory.

We are ſatisfied that what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be light to one eye, appears light to another; that what ſeems ſweet to one palate, is ſweet to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; that what is dark and bitter to this man, is likewiſe dark and bitter to that; and we conclude in the ſame manner of great and little, hard and ſoft, hot and cold, rough and ſmooth; and indeed of all the natural qualities and affections of bodies. If we ſuffer ourſelves to imagine, that their ſenſes preſent to different men different images of things, this ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical proceeding will make every ſort of reaſoning on every ſubject vain and frivolous, even that ſceptical reaſoning itſelf which had perſuaded us to entertain a doubt concerning the agreement of our perceptions. But as there will be little doubt that bodies preſent ſimilar images to the whole ſpecies, it muſt neceſſarily be allowed, that the pleaſures and the pains which every object excites in one man, it muſt raiſe in all mankind, whilſt it operates naturally, ſimply, and by its proper powers only; for if we deny this, we muſt imagine that the ſame cauſe operating in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and on ſubjects of the ſame kind, will produce different effects, which would be highly abſurd. Let us firſt conſider this point in the ſenſe of taſte, and the rather as the faculty in queſtion has taken its name from that ſenſe. All men are agreed to call vinegar ſour, honey ſweet, and aloes bitter; and as they are all agreed in finding theſe qualities in thoſe objects, they do not in the leaſt differ concerning their effects with regard to pleaſure and pain. They all concur in call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſweetneſs pleaſant, and ſourneſs and bitterneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant. Here there is no diverſity in their ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and that there is not, appears fully from the conſent of all men in the metaphors which are taken from the ſenſe of taſte. A ſour temper, bitter expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:0244800202:227"/>
bitter curſes, a bitter fate, are terms well and ſtrongly underſtood by all. And we are altogether as well underſtood when we ſay a ſweet diſpoſition, a ſweet perſon, a ſweet condition, and the like. It is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that cuſtom, and ſome other cauſes, have made many deviations from the natural pleaſures or pains which belong to theſe ſeveral taſtes; but then the power of diſtinguiſhing between the natural and the acquired reliſh remains to the very laſt. A man fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently comes to prefer the taſte of tobacco to that of ſugar, and the flavour of vinegar to that of milk; but this makes no confuſion in taſtes, whilſt he is ſenſible that the tobacco and vinegar are not ſweet, and whilſt he knows that habit alone has reconciled his palate to theſe alien pleaſures. Even with ſuch a perſon we may ſpeak, and with ſufficient preciſion, concerning taſtes. But ſhould any man be found who declares, that to him tobacco has a taſte like ſugar, and that he cannot diſtinguiſh between milk and vinegar; or that tobacco and vinegar are ſweet, milk bitter, and ſugar ſour; we immediately conclude that the organs of this man are out of order, and that his palate is utterly vitiated. We are as far from conferring with ſuch a perſon upon taſtes, as from reaſoning concerning the relations of quantity, with one who ſhould deny that all the parts together were equal to the whole. We do not call a man of this kind wrong in his notions, but abſolutely mad. Exceptions of this ſort, in either way, do not at all impeach our general rule, nor make us conclude that men have various principles concerning the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of quantity, or the taſte of things. So that when it is ſaid, taſte cannot be diſputed, it can only mean, that no one can ſtrictly anſwer what pleaſure or pain ſome particular man may find from the taſte of ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng. This indeed cannot be diſputed; but we may diſpute, and with ſufficient clearneſs too, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the things which are naturally pleaſing or diſagree able to the ſenſe. But when we talk of any peculiar or acquired reliſh, then we muſt know the habits, the
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:0244800202:228"/>
prejudices, or the diſtempers of this particular man, and we muſt draw our concluſion from thoſe.</p>
            <p>This agreement of mankind is not confined to the taſte ſolely. The principle of pleaſure derived from ſight is the ſame in all. Light is more pleaſing than darkneſs. Summer, when the earth is clad in green, when the heavens are ſerene and bright, is more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than winter, when every thing makes a different appearance. I never remember that any thing beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, whether a man, a beaſt, a bird, or a plant, was ever ſhewn, though it were to an hundred people, that they did not all immediately agree that it was beautiful, though ſome might have thought that it fell ſhort of their expectation, or that other things were ſtill finer.—<bibl>

            <head>TASTE. Progreſs of Taſte.</head>
            <p>A man to whom ſculpture is new ſees a barber's block, or ſome ordinary piece of ſtatuary, he is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſtruck and pleaſed, becauſe he ſees ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like a human figure; and, entirely taken up with this likeneſs, he does not at all attend to its defects. No perſon, I believe, at the firſt time of ſeeing a piece of imitation ever did. Some time after, we ſuppoſe that this novice lights upon a more artificial work of the ſame nature. He now begins to look with contempt on what he admired at firſt; not that he admired it even then for its unlikeneſs to a man, but for that general though inaccurate reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance which it bore to the human figure. What he admired at different times in theſe ſo different figures, is ſtrictly the ſame; and though his knowledge is improved, his taſte is not altered. Hitherto his miſtake was from a want of knowledge in art, and this aroſe from his inexperience; but he may be ſtill deficient from a want of knowledge in nature. For
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:0244800202:229"/>
it is poſſible that the man in queſtion may ſtop here, and that the maſter-piece of a great hand may pleaſe him no more than the middling performance of a vulgar artiſt; and this not for want of better or higher reliſh, but becauſe all men do not obſerve with ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient accuracy on the human figure to enable them to judge properly of an imitation of it. And that the critical taſte does not depend upon a ſuperior principle in men, but upon ſuperior knowledge, may appear from ſeveral inſtances. The ſtory of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient painter and the ſhoemaker is very well known. The ſhoemaker ſet the painter right with regard to ſome miſtakes he had made in the ſhoe of one of his figures, and which the painter, who had not made ſuch accurate obſervations on ſhoes, and was content with a general reſemblance, had never obſerved. But this was no impeachment to the taſte of the painter; it only ſhewed ſome want of knowledge in the art of making ſhoes. Let us imagine, that an anatomiſt had come into the painter's working room. His piece is in general well done, the figure in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a good attitude, and the parts well adjuſted to their various movements; yet the anatomiſt, criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal in his art, may obſerve the ſwell of ſome muſcle not quite juſt in the peculiar action of the figure. Here the anatomiſt obſerves what the painter had not obſerved; and he paſſes by what the ſhoemaker had remarked. But a want of the laſt critical knowledge in anatomy no more reflected on the natural good taſte of the painter, or of any common obſerver of his piece, than the want of an exact knowledge in the formation of a ſhoe. A fine piece of a decol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated head of St. John the Baptiſt was ſhewn to a Turkiſh emperor; he praiſed many things, but he obſerved one defect; he obſerved that the ſkin did not ſhrink from the wounded part of the neck. The ſultan on this occaſion, though his obſervation was very juſt, diſcovered no more natural taſte than the painter who executed this piece, or than a thouſand
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:0244800202:230"/>
European connoiſſeurs, who probably never would have made the ſame obſervation. His Turkiſh ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty had indeed been well acquainted with that ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible ſpectacle, which the others could only have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in their imagination. On the ſubject of their diſlike there is a difference between all theſe people, ariſing from the different kinds and degrees of their knowledge; but there is ſomething in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the painter, the ſhoemaker, the anatomiſt, and the Turkiſh emperor, the pleaſure ariſing from a natural object, ſo far as each perceives it juſtly imitated; the ſatisfaction in ſeeing an agreeable figure; the ſympathy proceeding from a ſtriking and affecting incident. So far as taſte is natural, it is nearly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all.—<bibl>

The unbounded liberality of the King of Pruſſia's<note n="*" place="bottom">Frederick the Great.</note> conduct on this occaſion, is known to all the world; and it is of a piece with the other grand maxims of his reign. The magnanimity of the imperial court, breaking through the narrow principles of its predeceſſors, has indulged its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant ſubjects, not only with property, with wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, with liberal education, but with honours and truſts, both civil and military.

            <p>IT is thus in real calamities. In imitated diſtreſſes the only difference is the pleaſure reſulting from the effects of imitation; for it is never ſo perfect, but we can perceive it is imitation, and on that principle are ſomewhat pleaſed with it. And indeed in ſome caſes we derive as much or more pleaſure from that ſource than from the thing itſelf. But then I imagine we ſhall be much miſtaken if we attribute any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable part of our ſatisfaction in tragedy to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration that tragedy is a deceit, and its repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no realities. The nearer it approaches the reality, and the further it removes us from all idea of fiction, the more perfect is its power. But be its
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:0244800202:235"/>
power of what kind it will, it never approaches to what it repreſents. Chooſe a day on which to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the moſt ſublime and affecting tragedy we have; appoint the moſt favourite actors; ſpare no coſt upon the ſcenes and decorations; unite the greateſt efforts of poetry, painting, and muſic; and when you have collected your audience, juſt at the moment when their minds are erect with expectation, let it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported that a ſtate criminal of high rank is on the point of being executed in the adjoining ſquare; in a moment the emptineſs of the theatre would demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the comparative weakneſs of the imitative arts, and proclaim the triumph of the real ſympathy. I believe that this notion of our having a ſimple pain in the reality, yet a delight in the repreſentation, ariſes from hence, that we do not ſufficiently diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh what we would by no means chooſe to do, from what we ſhould be eager enough to ſee if it was once done. We delight in ſeeing things, which ſo far from doing, our heartieſt wiſhes would be to ſee redreſſed. This noble capital, the pride of England and of Europe, I believe no man is ſo ſtrangely wicked as to deſire to ſee deſtroyed by a conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or an earthquake, though he ſhould be removed himſelf to the greateſt diſtance from the danger. But ſuppoſe ſuch a fatal accident to have happened, what numbers from all parts would crowd to behold the ruins, and amongſt them many who would have been content never to have ſeen London in its glory! Nor is it, either in real or fictitious diſtreſſes, our immunity from them which produces our delight; in my own mind I can diſcover nothing like it. I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that this miſtake is owing to a ſort of ſophiſm, by which we are frequently impoſed upon; it ariſes from our not diſtinguiſhing between what is indeed a neceſſary condition to our doing or ſuffering any thing in general, and what is the <hi>cauſe</hi> of ſome particular act. If a man kills me with a ſword, it is a neceſſary condition to this that we ſhould have been both of us
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:0244800202:236"/>
alive before the fact; and yet it would be abſurd to ſay, that our being both living creatures was the cauſe of his crime and of my death. So it is certain, that it is abſolutely neceſſary my life ſhould be out of any imminent hazard, before I can take a delight in the ſufferings of others, real or imaginary, or indeed in any thing elſe from any cauſe whatſoever. But then it is a ſophiſm to argue from thence, that this immunity is the cauſe of my delight either on theſe or on any occaſions. No one can diſtinguiſh ſuch a cauſe of ſatisfaction in his own mind, I believe; nay, when we do not ſuffer any very acute pain, nor are expoſed to any imminent danger of our lives, we can feel for others, whilſt we ſuffer ourſelves; and often then moſt when we are ſoftened by affliction; we ſee with pity even diſtreſſes which we would accept in the place of our own.—<bibl>

There are two courts, and two intereſts; both very different from the intereſts of the people. The favourite knows that the regard of a tyrant is as unconſtant and capricious as that of a woman; and concluding his time to be ſhort, he makes haſte to fill up the meaſure of his iniquity, in
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:0244800202:237"/>
rapine, in luxury, and in revenge. Every avenue to the throne is ſhut up. He oppreſſes, and ruins the people, whilſt he perſuades the prince, that thoſe murmurs raiſed by his own oppreſſion are the effects of diſaffection to the prince's government. Then is the natural violence of deſpotiſm inflamed, and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated by hatred and revenge. To deſerve well of the ſtate is a crime againſt the prince. To be po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular, and to be a traitor, are conſidered as ſynony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous terms. Even virtue is dangerous, as an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring quality, that claims an eſteem by itſelf, and independent of the countenance of the court.

For the groſs of the people, they are conſidered as a mere herd of cattle; and really in a little time become no better; all principle of honeſt pride, all ſenſe of the dignity of their nature, is loſt in their ſlavery. The day, ſays Homer, which makes a man a ſlave, takes away half his worth; and in fact, he loſes every impulſe to action, but that low and baſe one of fear.—In this kind of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment human nature is not only abuſed, and inſulted, but it is actually degraded and ſunk into a ſpecies of brutality.—<bibl>

            <head>TOULON.</head>
            <p>I HAVE Toulon in my eye. It was with infinite ſorrow I heard, that in taking the king of France's fleet in truſt, we inſtantly unrigged and diſmaſted the ſhips, inſtead of keeping them in a condition to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape in caſe of diſaſter, and in order to fulfil our truſt, that is, to hold them for the uſe of the owner, and, in the mean time, to employ them for our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſervice. Theſe ſhips are now ſo circumſtanced, that if we are forced to evacuate Toulon, they muſt fall into the hands of the enemy, or be burnt by ourſelves. I know this is by ſome conſidered as a fine thing for us. But the Athenians ought not to
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:0244800202:239"/>
be better than the Engliſh, or Mr. Pitt leſs virtuous than Ariſtides.</p>
            <p>Are we then ſo poor in reſources that we can do no better with eighteen or twenty ſhips of the line than to burn them? Had we ſent for French Royaliſt naval officers, of which ſome hundreds are to be had, and made them ſelect ſuch ſeamen as they could truſt, and filled the reſt with our own and Mediterranean ſeamen, which are all over Italy, to be had by thouſands, and put them under judicious Engliſh commanders in chief, and with a judicious mixture of our own ſubordinates, the Weſt Indies would at this day have been ours. It may be ſaid that theſe French officers would take them for the King of France, and that they would not be in our power. Be it ſo. The iſlands would not be ours, but they would not be jacobinized. This is however a thing impoſſible. They muſt in effect and ſubſtance be ours. But all is upon that falſe principle of diſtruſt, which, not confiding in ſtrength, can never have the full uſe of it. They that pay, and feed, and equip, muſt direct. But I muſt ſpeak plain upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. The French iſlands, if they were all our own, ought not to be all kept. A fair partition only ought to be made of thoſe territories. This is a ſubject of policy very ſerious, which has many relations and aſpects. Juſt here I only hint at it as anſwering an objection, whilſt I ſtate the miſchievous conſequences which ſuffer us to be ſurprized into a virtual breach of faith, by confounding our ally with our enemy, becauſe they both belong to the ſame geographical territory.</p>
            <p>My clear opinion is, that Toulon ought to be made, what we ſet out with, a royal French city. By the neceſſity of the caſe, it muſt be under the influence, civil and military, of the allies. But the only way of keeping that jealous and diſcordant maſs from tearing its component parts to pieces, and hazarding the loſs of the whole, is to put the place into the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:0244800202:240"/>
government of the Regent, his officers being approved by us. This, I ſay, is abſolutely neceſſary for a poiſe amongſt ourſelves. Otherwiſe is it to be believed that the Spaniards, who hold that place with us in a ſort of partnerſhip contrary to our mutual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, will ſee us abſolute maſters of the Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean, with Gibraltar on one ſide, and Toulon on the other, with a quiet and compoſed mind, whilſt we do little leſs than declare that we are to take the whole Weſt Indies into our hands, leaving the vaſt, unwieldy, and feeble body of the Spaniſh dominions in that part of the world abſolutely at our mercy, without any power to balance us in the ſmalleſt degree.</p>
            <p>Nothing is ſo fatal to a nation as an extreme of ſelf-partiality, and the total want of conſideration of what others will naturally hope or fear. Spain muſt think ſhe ſees, that we are taking advantage of the confuſions which reign in France, to diſable that country, and, of courſe, every country from afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her protection, and in the end, to turn the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh monarchy into a province. If ſhe ſaw things in a proper point of light, to be ſure, ſhe would not conſider any other plan of politics as of the leaſt moment in compariſon of the extinction of jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biniſm. But her miniſters (to ſay the beſt of them) are vulgar politicians. It is no wonder that they ſhould poſtpone this great point, or balance it, by conſiderations of the common politics, that is, the queſtions of power between <hi>ſtate and ſtate.</hi> If we manifeſtly endeavour to deſtroy the balance, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the maritime and commercial balance, both in Europe and the Weſt Indies (the latter their ſore and vulnerable part) from fear of what France may do for Spain hereafter, is it to be wondered, that Spain, infinitely weaker than we are (weaker, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, than ſuch a maſs of empire ever was) ſhould feel the ſame fears from our uncontrouled power, that we give way to ourſelves from a ſuppoſed reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the ancient power of France under a
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:0244800202:241"/>
monarchy? It ſignifies nothing whether we are wrong or right in the abſtract; but in reſpect to our relation to Spain, with ſuch principles followed up in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, it is abſolutely impoſſible that any cordial alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance can ſubſiſt between the two nations. If Spain goes, Naples will ſpeedily follow. Pruſſia is quite certain, and thinks of nothing but making a market of the preſent confuſions. Italy is broken and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided; Switzerland is jacobinized, I am afraid, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely. I have long ſeen with pain the progreſs of French principles in that country. Things cannot go on upon the preſent bottom. The poſſeſſion of Toulon, which, well managed, might be of the greateſt advantage, will be the greateſt misfortune that ever happened to this nation. The more we multiply troops there, the more we ſhall multiply cauſes and means of quarrel amongſt ourſelves. I know but one way of avoiding it, which is to give a greater degree of ſimplicity to our politics. Our ſituation does neceſſarily render them a good deal involved. And, to this evil, inſtead of increaſing it, we ought to apply all the remedies in our power.</p>
            <p>See what is, in that place, the conſequence (to ſay nothing of every other) of this complexity. Toulon has, as it were, two gates, an Engliſh and a Spaniſh. The Engliſh gate is, by our policy, faſt barred againſt the entrance of any Royaliſts. The Spaniards open theirs, I fear, upon no fixed principle, and with very little judgment. By means, however, of this fooliſh, mean, and jealous policy on our ſide, all the Royaliſts whom the Engliſh might ſelect as moſt practicable, and moſt ſubſervient to honeſt views, are totally excluded. Of thoſe admitted, the Spaniards are maſters. As to the inhabitants they are a neſt of Jacobins which is delivered into our hands, not from principle, but from fear. The inhabitants of Toulon may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in few words. It is <hi>differtum naulis, cauponi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus atque malignis.</hi> The reſt of the ſeaports are of the ſame deſcription.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="416" facs="tcp:0244800202:242"/>Another thing which I cannot account for is, the ſending for the biſhop of Toulon, and afterwards forbidding his entrance. This is as directly contrary to the declaration, as it is to the practice of the allied powers. The king of Pruſſia did better. When he took Verdun, he actually re-inſtated the biſhop and his chapter. When he thought he ſhould be the maſter of Chalons, he called the biſhop from Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to put him into poſſeſſion. The Auſtrians have reſtored the clergy wherever they obtained poſſeſſion. We have propoſed to reſtore religion as well as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy; and in Toulon we have reſtored neither the one nor the other. It is very likely that the Jacobin Sans-Culottes, or ſome of them, objected to this meaſure, who rather chuſe to have the atheiſtic buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoons of clergy they have got to ſport with, till they are ready to come forward, with the reſt of their worthy brethren, in Paris and other places, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that they are a ſet of impoſtors, that they never believed in God, and never will preach any ſort of religion. If we give way to our Jacobins in this point, it is fully and fairly putting the government, civil and eccleſiaſtical, not in the king of France, to whom, as the protector and governor, and in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance the head of the Gallican church, the nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the biſhoprics belonged, and who made the biſhop of Toulon; it does not leave it with him, or even in the hands of the king of England, or the king of Spain; but in the baſeſt Jacobins of a low ſea-port, to exerciſe, <hi>pro tempore,</hi> the ſovereignty. If this point of religion is thus given up, the grand inſtrument for reclaiming France is abandoned.—<bibl>

            <head>VARIATION, WHY BEAUTIFUL.</head>
            <p>ANOTHER principal property of beautiful objects is, that the line of their parts is continually varying its direction; but it varies it by a very inſenſible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation; it never varies it ſo quickly as to ſurprize, or by the ſharpneſs of its angle to cauſe any twitching or convulſion of the optic nerve. Nothing long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the ſame manner, nothing very ſuddenly varied, can be beautiful; becauſe both are oppoſite to that agreeable relaxation which is the characteriſtic effect of beauty. It is thus in all the ſenſes. A motion in a right line, is that manner of moving next to a very gentle deſcent, in which we meet the leaſt reſiſtance; yet it is not that manner of moving, which, next to a deſcent, wearies us the leaſt. Reſt certainly tends to relax: yet there is a ſpecies of motion which relaxes more than reſt; a gentle oſcillatory mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ariſing and falling. Rocking ſets children to ſleep better than abſolute reſt; there is, indeed, ſcarce any thing at that age, which gives more pleaſure than to be gently lifted up and down; the manner of play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which their nurſes uſe with children, and the weighing and ſwinging uſed afterwards by themſelves as a favourite amuſement, evince this very ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently. Moſt people muſt have obſerved the ſort of ſenſe they have had, on being ſwiftly drawn in an eaſy coach on a ſmooth turf, with gradual aſcents and declivities. This will give a better idea of the beautiful, and point out its probable cauſe better, than almoſt any thing elſe. On the contrary, when one is hurried over a rough, rocky, broken road, the pain felt by theſe ſudden inequalities ſhews why
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:0244800202:244"/>
ſimilar ſights, feelings, and ſounds, are ſo contrary to beauty: and with regard to the feeling, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly the ſame in its effect, or very nearly the ſame, whether, for inſtance, I move my hand along the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of a body of a certain ſhape, or whether ſuch a body is moved along my hand. But to bring this analogy of the ſenſes home to the eye: if a body pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to that ſenſe has ſuch a waving ſurface, that the rays of light reflected from it are in a continual inſenſible deviation from the ſtrongeſt to the weakeſt (which is always the caſe in a ſurface gradually un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal) it muſt be exactly ſimilar in its effect on the eye and touch; upon the one of which it operates directly, on the other indirectly. And this body will be beautiful if the lines which compoſe its ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face are not continued, even ſo varied, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that may weary or diſſipate the attention. The variation itſelf muſt be continually varied.—<bibl>

            <p>DISTANCE of place does not extinguiſh the duties or the rights of men; but it often renders their exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe impracticable. The ſame circumſtance of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance renders the noxious effects of an evil ſyſtem in any community leſs pernicious. But there are ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations where this difficulty does not occur; and in which, therefore, theſe duties are obligatory, and theſe rights are to be aſſerted. It has ever been the method of public juriſts to draw the analogies on which they form the law of nations, from the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of law which prevail in civil community. Civil laws are not all of them merely poſitive. Thoſe which are rather concluſions of legal reaſon, than matters of ſtatutable proviſion, belong to univerſal equity, and are univerſally applicable. Almoſt the whole praetorian law is ſuch. There is a <hi>Law of Neighbourhood</hi> which does not leave a man perfect maſter on his own ground. When a neighbour ſees a <hi>new erection,</hi> in the nature of a nuiſance, ſet up at his door, he has a right to repreſent it to the Judge; who, on his part, has a right to order the work to be ſtaid; or if eſtabliſhed, to be removed. On this head, the parent law is expreſs and clear; and has made many wiſe proviſions, which, without deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, regulate and reſtrain the right of <hi>ownerſhip</hi> by the right of <hi>vicinage.</hi> No <hi>innovation</hi> is permitted that may redound, even ſecondarily, to the prejudice of a neighbour. The whole doctrine of that important head of praetorian law, <q rend="inline">"<hi>De novi operis nunciatione,</hi>"</q>
               <pb n="420" facs="tcp:0244800202:246"/>
is founded on the principle, that no <hi>new</hi> uſe ſhould be made of a man's private liberty of operating upon his private property, from whence a detriment may be juſtly apprehended by his neighbour. This law of denunciation is proſpective. It is to anticipate what is called <hi>damnum infectum,</hi> or <hi>damnum nondum factum,</hi> that is a damage juſtly apprehended but not actually done. Even before it is clearly known whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the innovation be damageable or not, the Judge is competent to iſſue a prohibition to innovate, until the point can be determined. This prompt interfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is grounded on principles favourable to both parties. It is preventive of miſchief difficult to be repaired, and of ill blood difficult to be ſoftened.—The rule of law, therefore, which comes before the evil, is amongſt the very beſt parts of equity, and juſtifies the promptneſs of the remedy; becauſe, as it is well obſerved, <hi>Res damni infecti celeritatem deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derat, &amp; periculoſa eſt dilatio.</hi> This right of denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation does not hold, when things continue, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever inconveniently to the neighbourhood, according to the <hi>ancient</hi> mode. For there is a ſort of preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt novelty, drawn out of a deep conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of human nature and human affairs; and the maxim of juriſprudence is well laid down, <hi>Veluſtas pro lege ſemper habetur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such is the law of civil vicinity. Now where there is no conſtituted Judge, as between independent ſtates there is not, the vicinage itſelf is the natural judge. It is, preventively, the aſſertor of its own rights, or remedially, their avenger. Neighbours are preſumed to take cognizance of each other's acts. <q rend="inline">"<hi>Vicini, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinorum ſacta preſumuntur ſcire.</hi>"</q> This principle, which, like the reſt, is as true of nations as of men, has beſtowed on the grand vicinage of Europe, a duty to know, and a right to prevent, any capital innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which may amount to the erection of a dangerous nuiſance. Of the importance of that innovation, and the miſchief of that nuiſance, they are, to be ſure, bound to judge not litigiouſly; but it is in their
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:0244800202:247"/>
competence to judge. What in civil ſociety is a ground of action, in politic ſociety is a ground of war. But the exerciſe of that competent juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a matter of moral prudence. As ſuits in civil ſociety, ſo war in the political, is ever a matter of great deliberation.

            <p>VARIOUS perſons may concur in the ſame meaſure on various grounds. They may be various, without being contrary to, or excluſive of, each other. I thought the inſolent, unprovoked aggreſſion of the Regicide upon our ally of Holland, a good ground of war; I think his manifeſt attempt to overturn the balance of Europe a good ground of war; as a good ground of war I conſider his declaration of war on his Majeſty and his kingdom. But though I have taken all theſe to my aid, I conſider them as nothing more than as a ſort of evidence to indicate the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable mind within. It was not for their former declaration of war, nor for any ſpecific act of hoſtility that I primarily wiſhed to reſiſt them, or to perſevere in my reſiſtance. It was becauſe the faction in France had aſſumed a form, had adopted a body of principles and maxims, and had regularly and ſyſtematically acted on them, by which ſhe virtually had put herſelf in a poſture which was in itſelf a declaration of war againſt mankind.—<bibl>

            <head>WAR. View of War that touches our own Country.</head>
            <p>LET the portion of our hiſtory from the year 1689 to 1713 be brought before us. We ſhall find, that in all that period of twenty-four years, there were not above ſix that could be called an interval of peace; and this interval was in reality nothing more than a very active preparation for war. During that period, every one of the propoſitions of peace came from the enemy. The firſt, when they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, at the peace of Ryſwick. The ſecond, where they were rejected at the congreſs at Gertru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgh. The laſt, when the war ended by the treaty of Utrecht. Even then, a very great part of the nation, and that which contained by far the moſt intelligent ſtateſmen, was againſt the concluſion of the war. I do not enter into the merits of that queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as between the parties. I only ſtate the exiſtence of that opinion as a fact. I mention the length of the war as a proof, that though the countries which now compoſe the kingdom, for a part of the time were not united, and through all the time continued with a raw and ill cemented union, and though they were further ſplit into parties as vehement, and more equally divided than now they are, and that we were poſſeſſed of far leſs abundant reſources in all kinds than we now enjoy.—I mean to mark, that under all theſe diſadvantages the Engliſh nation was then a great people; that we had then an high mind, and a conſtancy unconquerable; that we were then inſpired with no fluſhy paſſions, but ſuch as were durable as well as warm; ſuch as correſponded to the great intereſts we had at ſtake. This force of character was inſpired, as all ſuch ſpirit muſt ever be, from above. Government gave the impulſe. As well may we fancy that of itſelf the ſea will ſwell, and without winds the billows will inſult the adverſe ſhore, as that the groſs maſs of the people will be
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:0244800202:250"/>
moved and elevated without the influence of ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior authority, or ſuperior mind.</p>
            <p>This impulſe ought, in my opinion, to have been given in this war; and it ought to have been conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to it at every inſtant. It is made, if ever war was made, to touch all the great ſprings of action in the human breaſts. It ought not to have been a war of apology. The miniſter had, in this conflict, wherewithal to glory in ſucceſs; to be conſoled in adverſity; to hold high his principle in all fortunes. If it were not given him to ſupport the falling edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, he ought to bury himſelf under the ruins of the civilized world. All the art of Greece, and all the pride and power of eaſtern monarchs, never heaped upon their aſhes ſo grand a monument.</p>
            <p>There were days when his great mind was up to the criſis of the world he is called to act in. His manly eloquence was equal to the elevated wiſdom of ſuch ſentiments. But the little have triumphed over the great; and unnatural, not an unuſual victory. I am ſure you cannot forget with how much uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs we heard in converſation, the language of more than one gentleman at the opening of this conteſt,
<q rend="inline">"that he was willing to try the war for a year or two, and if it did not ſucceed, then to vote for peace."</q>
As if war was a matter of experiment! As if you could take it up or lay it down as an idle frolic! As if the dire goddeſs that preſides over it, with her murderous ſpear in her hand, and her gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon at her breaſt, was a coquette to be flirted with! We ought with reverence to approach that tremendous divinity, that loves courage, but commands counſel. War never leaves a nation where it was found. The interval between that and peace is, indeed,
<q rend="inline">"a very hideous dream, in which the genius and the mortal inſtruments are ſeriouſly at work."</q>
It is never to be entered into without a mature deliberation; not a deliberation lengthened out into a perplexing indeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but a deliberation leading to a ſure and fixed
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:0244800202:251"/>
judgment. When ſo taken up, it is not to be aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned without reaſon as valid, as fully, and as exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively conſidered; for peace may be made as unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſedly as war. Nothing is ſo raſh as fear; and the counſels of puſillanimity very rarely put off, whilſt they are always ſure to aggravate the evils they would fly from.</p>
            <p>In that great war carried on againſt Louis the XIVth, for near eighteen years, Government ſpared no pains to ſatisfy the people, that though they were to be animated by a deſire of glory, glory was not their ultimate object: but that every thing dear to them, in religion, in law, in liberty, every thing which as freemen, as Engliſhmen, and as citizens of the great commonwealth of Chriſtendom, they had at heart, was then at ſtake. Whether they did not exaggerate the danger I will not diſpute. A danger, and no ſmall danger, unqueſtionably there was; and that long and arduous war was purſued, upon at leaſt as ſolid and manly grounds, as the peace was made which put an end to it. A danger to avert a danger—a preſent inconvenience and ſuffering to prevent a foreſeen future, and a worſe calamity—theſe are the motives that belong to an animal, who, in his conſtitution, is at once adventurous and provident; circumſpect, and daring; whom his Creator has made, as the Poet ſays,
<q rend="inline">"of large diſcourſe, looking before and after."</q>
But never can a vehement and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſpirit of fortitude be kindled in a people by a war of calculation. It has nothing that can keep the mind erect under the guſts of adverſity. Even where men are willing, as ſometimes they are, to barter their blood for lucre, to hazard their ſafety to gratify their avarice, that paſſion, like all the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, muſt ſee it's objects diſtinct and near at hand.</p>
            <p>The paſſions are hungry and impatient. Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative plunder; contingent ſpoil; future long ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed uncertain booty; pillage which muſt enrich a late poſterity, and which poſſibly may not reach to
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:0244800202:252"/>
poſterity at all; theſe, for any length of time, will never ſupport a mercenary war. The people are in the right. The calculation of profit in all ſuch wars is falſe. On balancing the account of ſuch wars, ten thouſand hogſheads of ſugar are purchaſed at ten thouſand times their price. The blood of man ſhould never be ſhed but to redeem the blood of man. It is well ſhed for our family, for our friends, for our God, for our country, for our kind. The reſt is vanity; the reſt is crime.</p>
            <p>In the war of the Grand Alliance, moſt of theſe conſiderations voluntarily and naturally had their part. Some were preſſed into the ſervice. The political intereſt eaſily went in the track of the natural ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In the reverſe courſe the carriage does not follow freely. I am ſure the natural feeling, as I have juſt ſaid, is a far more predominant ingredient in this war, than in that of any other that ever was waged by this kingdom.</p>
            <p>If the war made to prevent the union of two crowns upon one head was a juſt war, this, which is made to prevent the tearing all crowns from all heads which ought to wear them, and with the crowns to ſmite off the ſacred heads themſelves, this is a juſt war.</p>
            <p>If a war to prevent Louis the Fourteenth from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing his religion was juſt, a war to prevent the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers of Louis the Sixteenth from impoſing their ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion upon us is juſt; a war to prevent the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſyſtem, which makes life without dignity, and death without hope, is a juſt war.</p>
            <p>If to preſerve political independence and civil freedom to nations, was a juſt ground of war; a war to preſerve national independence, property, liberty, life, and honour, from certain univerſal havock, is a war juſt, neceſſary, manly, pious; and we are bound to perſevere in it by every principle, divine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as long as the ſyſtem which menaces them all, and all equally, has an exiſtence in the world.—<bibl>

            <head>WAR. The preſent a religious War.</head>
            <p>WE cannot, if we would, delude ourſelves about the true ſtate of this dreadful conteſt. It is a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious war. It includes in its object undoubtedly every other intereſt of ſociety as well as this; but this is the principal and leading feature. It is through this deſtruction of religion that our enemies propoſe the accompliſhment of all their other views. The French revolution, impious at once and fanatical, had no other plan for domeſtic power and foreign empire. Look at all the proceedings of the National Aſſembly, from the firſt day of declaring itſelf ſuch in the year 1789, to this very hour, and you will find full half of their buſineſs to be directly on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. In fact it is the ſpirit of the whole. The reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſyſtem, called the conſtitutional church, was on the face of the whole proceeding ſet up only as a mere temporary amuſement to the people, and ſo conſtantly ſtated in all their converſations, till the time ſhould come, when they might with ſafety caſt off the very appearance of all religion whatſoever, and perſecute chriſtianity throughout Europe with fire and ſword. The conſtitutional clergy are not the miniſters of any religion: they are the agents and inſtruments of this horrible conſpiracy againſt all morals. It was from a ſenſe of this, that in the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh addition to the articles propoſed at St. Domingo, tolerating all religions, we very wiſely refuſed to ſuffer that kind of traitors and buffoons.</p>
            <p>This religious war is not a controverſy between ſect and ſect as formerly, but a war againſt all ſects and all religions. The queſtion is not whether you are to overturn the catholic, to ſet up the proteſtant. Such an idea in the preſent ſtate of the world is too contemptible. Our buſineſs is to leave to the ſchools the diſcuſſion of the controverted points, abating as much as we can the acrimony of diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:0244800202:254"/>
on all ſides. It is for chriſtian ſtateſmen, as the world is now circumſtanced, to ſecure their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon baſis, and not to riſque the ſubverſion of the whole fabric by purſuing theſe diſtinctions with an ill-timed zeal. We have in the preſent grand alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, all modes of government as well as all modes of religion. In government, we mean to reſtore that which, notwithſtanding our diverſity of forms we are all agreed in, as fundamental in government. The ſame principle ought to guide us in the religious part; conforming the mode, not to our particular ideas (for in that point we have no ideas in common) but to what will beſt promote the great general ends of the alliance. As ſtateſmen we are to ſee which of thoſe modes beſt ſuits with the intereſts of ſuch a commonwealth as we wiſh to ſecure and promote. There can be no doubt, but that the catholic religion, which is fundamentally the religion of France, muſt go with the Monarchy of France; we know that the Monarchy did not ſurvive the Hierarchy, no not even in appearance, for many months; in ſubſtance, not for a ſingle hour. As little can it exiſt in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, if that pillar is taken away; or even ſhattered and impaired.—<bibl>

            <head>WALES. Sketch of Welch Hiſtory.</head>
            <p>MY next example is Wales. This country was ſaid to be reduced by Henry the Third. It was ſaid more truly to be ſo by Edward the Firſt. But though then conquered, it was not looked upon as any part of the realm of England. Its old conſtitution, whatever that might have been, was deſtroyed; and no good one was ſubſtituted in its place. The care of that tract was put into the hands of lords marchers—a form of government of a very ſingular kind; a ſtrange heterogeneous monſter, ſomething between
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:0244800202:255"/>
hoſtility and government; perhaps it has a ſort of reſemblance, according to the modes of thoſe times, to that of commander in chief at preſent, to whom all civil power is granted as ſecondary. The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Welſh nation followed the genius of the government: the people were ferocious, reſtive, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage, and uncultivated; ſometimes compoſed, never pacified. Wales within itſelf, was in perpetual diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order; and it kept the frontier of England in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual alarm. Benefits from it to the ſtate, there were none. Wales was only known to England, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſion and invaſion.</p>
            <p>Sir, during that ſtate of things, parliament was not idle. They attempted to ſubdue the fierce ſpirit of the Welch by all ſorts of rigorous laws. They prohibited by ſtatute the ſending all ſorts of arms into Wales, as you prohibit by proclamation (with ſomething more of doubt on the legality) the ſending arms to America. They diſarmed the Welſh by ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, as you attempted (but ſtill with more queſtion on the legality) to diſarm New England by an inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They made an act to drag offenders from Wales into England for trial, as you have done (but with more hardſhip) with regard to America. By another act, where one of the parties was an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhman, they ordained, that his trial ſhould be always by Engliſh. They made acts to reſtrain trade, as you do; and they prevented the Welſh from the uſe of fairs and markets, as you do the Americans from fiſheries and foreign ports. In ſhort, when the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute-book was not quite ſo much ſwelled as it is now, you find no leſs than fifteen acts of penal regulation on the ſubject of Wales.</p>
            <p>Here we rub our hands—A fine body of prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents for the authority of parliament and the uſe of it!—I admit it fully; and pray add likewiſe to theſe precedents, that all the while, Wales rid this kingdom like an <hi>incubus;</hi> that it was an unprofitable and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive burthen; and that an Engliſhman travelling
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:0244800202:256"/>
in that country could not go ſix yards from the high road without being murdered.</p>
            <p>The march of the human mind is ſlow. Sir, it was not, until after two hundred years, diſcovered, that by an eternal law, providence had decreed vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to violence; and poverty to rapine. Your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors did however at length open their eyes to the ill huſbandry of injuſtice. They found that the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of a free people could of all tyrannies the leaſt be endured; and that laws made againſt an whole nation were not the moſt effectual methods for ſecuring its obedience. Accordingly, in the twenty-ſeventh year of Henry VIII. the courſe was entirely altered. With a preamble ſtating the entire and perfect rights of the crown of England, it gave to the Welſh all the rights and privileges of Engliſh ſubjects. A political order was eſtabliſhed; the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary power gave way to the civil; the marches were turned into counties. But that a nation ſhould have a right to Engliſh liberties, and yet no ſhare at all in the fundamental ſecurity of theſe liberties, the grant of their own property, ſeemed a thing ſo incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that eight years after, that is, in the thirty-fifth of that reign, a complete and not ill-proportioned repreſentation by counties and boroughs was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon Wales, by act of parliament. From that moment, as by a charm, the tumults ſubſided; obedience was reſtored; peace, order, and civiliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, followed in the train of liberty.—When the day-ſtar of the Engliſh conſtitution had ariſen in their hearts, all was harmony within and without—<q>

            <head>WEALTH OF FRANCE IN 1785.</head>
            <p>THE wealth of a country is another, and no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible ſtandard, by which me may judge whether, on the whole, a government be protecting or deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. France far exceeds England in the multitude of her people; but I apprehend that her comparative wealth is much inferior to ours; that it is not ſo equal in the diſtribution, nor ſo ready in the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. I believe the difference in the form of the two governments to be amongſt the cauſes of this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage on the ſide of England. I ſpeak of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, not of the whole Britiſh dominions; which, if compared with thoſe of France, will, in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, weaken the comparative rate of wealth upon our ſide. But that wealth, which will not endure a compariſon with the riches of England, may conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a very reſpectable degree of opulence. Mr. Necker's book publiſhed in 1785, contains an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and intereſting collection of facts relative to public oeconomy and to political arithmetic; and his ſpeculations on the ſubject are in general wiſe and liberal. In that work he gives an idea of the ſtate of France, very remote from the portrait of a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try whoſe government was a perfect grievance, an abſolute evil, admitting no cure but through the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and uncertain remedy of a total revolution. He affirms, that from the year 1726 to the year 1784, there was coined at the mint of France, in the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of gold and ſilver, to the amount of about one hundred millions of pounds ſterling.</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible that Mr. Necker ſhould be miſtaken in the amount of the bullion which has been coined
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:0244800202:258"/>
in the mint. It is a matter of official record. The reaſonings of this able financier, concerning the quantity of gold and ſilver which remained for cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, when he wrote in 1785, that is about four years before the depoſition and impriſonment of the French king, are not of equal certainty; but they are laid on grounds ſo apparently ſolid, that it is not eaſy to refuſe a conſiderable degree of aſſent to his calculation. He calculates the <hi>numeraire,</hi> or what we call <hi>ſpecie,</hi> then actually exiſting in France, at about eighty-eight millions of the ſame Engliſh mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. A great accumulation of wealth for one coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, large as that country is? Mr. Neckar was ſo far from conſidering this influx of wealth as likely to ceaſe, when he wrote in 1785, that he preſumes upon a future annual increaſe of two per cent. upon the money brought into France during the periods from which he computed.—<bibl>

            <head>WORDS. How Words influence the Paſſions.</head>
            <p>NOW, as words affect, not by any original power, but by repreſentation, it might be ſuppoſed that their influence over the paſſions ſhould be but light; yet it is quite otherwiſe; for we find by experience that elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and poetry are as capable, nay indeed much more capable, of making deep and lively impreſſions than any other arts, and even than nature itſelf, in very many caſes. And this ariſes chiefly from theſe three cauſes. Firſt, that we take an extraordinary part in the paſſions of others, and that we are eaſily affected and brought into ſympathy by any tokens which are ſhewn of them; and there are no tokens which can expreſs all the circumſtances of moſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſo fully as words; ſo that if a perſon ſpeaks upon any ſubject, he can not only convey the ſubject to you, but likewiſe the manner in which he is himſelf
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:0244800202:259"/>
affected by it. Certain it is, that the influence of moſt things on our paſſions, is not ſo much from the things themſelves, as from our opinions concerning them; and theſe again depend very much on the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of other men, conveyable for the moſt part by words only. Secondly, there are many things of a very affecting nature, which can ſeldom occur in the reality, but the words which repreſent them often do; and thus they have an opportunity of making a deep impreſſion, and taking root in the mind, whilſt the idea of the reality was tranſient; and to ſome perhaps never really occurred in any ſhape, to whom it is, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, very affecting, as war, death, famine, &amp;c. Beſides, many ideas have never been at all preſented to the ſenſes of any men but by words, as God, angels, devils, heaven, and hell, all of which have however a great influence over the paſſions. Thirdly, by words we have it in our power to make ſuch <hi>combinations</hi> as we cannot poſſibly do otherwiſe. By this power of combining we are able, by the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of well-choſen circumſtances, to give a new life and force to the ſimple object. In painting we may repreſent any fine figure we pleaſe; but we never can give it thoſe enlivening touches which it may receive from words. To repreſent an angel in a picture, you can only draw a beautiful young man winged; but what painting can furniſh out any thing ſo grand as the addition of one word, <q rend="inline">"the angel of the <hi>Lord</hi>?"</q> It is true, I have here no clear idea; but theſe words affect the mind more than the ſenſible image did, which is all I contend for. A picture of Priam dragged to the altar's foot, and there murdered, if it were well executed, would undoubtedly be very moving; but there are very aggravating circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which it could never repreſent:

This idea, or this affection cauſed by a word, which nothing but a word could annex to the others, raiſes a very great degree of the ſublime; and this ſublime is raiſed yet higher by what follows, a <q rend="inline">"<hi>univerſe of Death.</hi>"</q> Here are again two ideas not preſentable but by language; and an union of them great and amazing beyond conception; if they may properly be called ideas which preſent no diſtinct image to the mind;—but ſtill it will be difficult to conceive how words can move the paſſions which belong to real objects, without repreſenting theſe objects clearly. This is difficult to us, becauſe we do not ſufficiently diſtinguiſh, in our obſervations upon lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, between a clear expreſſion, and a ſtrong ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. Theſe are frequently confounded with each other, though they are in reality extremely different. The former regards the underſtanding; the latter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the paſſions. The one deſcribes a thing as it is; the other deſcribes it as it is felt. Now, as there is a moving tone of voice, an impaſſioned countenance, an agitated geſture, which affect inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently of the things about which they are exerted, ſo there are words, and certain diſpoſitions of words, which being peculiarly devoted to paſſionate ſubjects, and always uſed by thoſe who are under the influence of any paſſion, touch and move us more than thoſe
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:0244800202:261"/>
which far more clearly and diſtinctly expreſs the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject matter. We yield to ſympathy what we refuſe to deſcription. The truth is, all verbal deſcription, merely as naked deſcription, though never ſo exact, conveys ſo poor and inſufficient an idea of the thing deſcribed, that it could ſcarcely have the ſmalleſt effect, if the ſpeaker did not call in to his aid thoſe modes of ſpeech that mark a ſtrong and lively feeling in himſelf. Then, by the contagion of our paſſions, we catch a fire already kindled in another, which probably might never have been ſtruck out by the object deſcribed. Words, by ſtrongly conveying the paſſions, by thoſe means which we have already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, fully compenſate for their weakneſs in other reſpects. It may be obſerved, that very poliſhed languages, and ſuch as are praiſed for their ſuperior clearneſs and perſpicuity, are generally deficient in ſtrength. The French language has that perfection and that defect. Whereas the oriental tongues, and in general the languages of moſt unpoliſhed people, have a great force and energy of expreſſion; and this is but natural. Uncultivated people are but ordinary obſervers of things, and not critical in diſtinguiſhing them; but, for that reaſon, they admire more, and are more affected with what they ſee, and therefore expreſs themſelves in a warmer and more paſſionate manner. If the affection be well conveyed, it will work its effect without any clear idea; often without any idea at all of the thing which has originally given riſe to it.</p>
            <p>It might be expected from the fertility of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that I ſhould conſider poetry as it regards the ſublime and beautiful more at large; but it muſt be obſerved that in this light it has been often and well handled already. It was not my deſign to enter into the criticiſm of the ſublime and beautiful in any art, but to attempt to lay down ſuch principles as may tend to aſcertain, to diſtinguiſh and to form a ſort of ſtandard for them; which purpoſes I thought
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:0244800202:262"/>
might be beſt effected by an enquiry into the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of ſuch things in nature, as raiſe love and aſtoniſhment in us; and by ſhewing in what manner they operated to produce theſe paſſions. Words were only ſo far to be conſidered, as to ſhew upon what principle they were capable of being the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of theſe natural things, and by what powers they were able to affect us often as ſtrongly as the things they repreſent, and ſometimes much more ſtrongly.—<bibl>

Theſe doctrines concerning the <hi>people</hi> (a term which they are far from accurately defining, but by which, from many circumſtances, it is plain enough they mean their own faction, if they ſhould grow by early arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by treachery, or violence, into the prevailing force) tend, in my opinion, to the utter ſubverſion, not only of all government, in all modes, and to all ſtable ſecurities to rational freedom, but to all the rules and principles of morality itſelf.</p>

That it was juſtified <hi>only</hi> upon the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of the caſe; as the <hi>only</hi> means left for the recovery of that <hi>antient</hi> conſtitution, formed by the <hi>original contract</hi> of the Britiſh ſtate; as well as for the future preſervation of the <hi>ſame</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>

The conſtitution of the electoral do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions has indeed a double control, both from the laws of the empire, and from the privileges of the country. Whatever rights the king enjoys as elector, have been always parentally exerciſed, and the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies of theſe ſcandalous ſocieties have not been authorized by a ſingle complaint of oppreſſion—<bibl>

            <head>WHIGS. Character of the Whigs in the Reign of Queen Anne.</head>
            <p>IN one of the moſt fortunate periods of our hiſtory this country was governed by a <hi>connexion;</hi> I mean the great connexion of Whigs in the reign of Queen Anne. They were complimented upon the principle of this connexion by a poet who was in high eſteem with them. Addiſon, who knew their ſentiments, could not praiſe them for what they conſidered as no proper ſubject of commendation. As a poet who knew his buſineſs, he could not applaud them for a thing which in general eſtimation was not highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable. Addreſſing himſelf to Britain,
<q>
                  <l>Thy favourites grow not up by fortune's ſport,</l>
                  <l>Or from the crimes or follies of a court.</l>
                  <l>On the firm baſis of deſert they riſe,</l>
                  <l>From long-try'd faith, and friendſhip's holy ties.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The Whigs of thoſe days believed that the only proper method of riſing into power, was through hard eſſays of practiſed friendſhip and experimented fidelity. At that time it was not imagined that patriotiſm was a bloody idol, which required the ſacrifice of children and parents, or deareſt connexions in private life, and of all the virtues that riſe from thoſe relations. They were not of that ingenious paradoxical morality, to imagine that a ſpirit of moderation was properly ſhewn in patiently bearing the ſufferings of your friends; or that diſintereſtedneſs was clearly manifeſted at the expence of other people's fortune. They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that no men could act with effect, who did not act in concert; that no men could act in concert who did not act with confidence; and that no men could act with confidence, who were not bound together by common opinions, common affections, and common intereſts.</p>
            <p>Theſe wiſe men, for ſuch I muſt call Lord Sunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Lord Godolphin, Lord Sommers, and Lord Marlborough, were too well principled in theſe maxims

upon which the whole fabric of public ſtrength is built, to be blown off their ground by the breath of every childiſh talker.

            <head>WIT AND JUDGMENT.</head>
            <p>MR. LOCKE very juſtly and finely obſerves of wit, that it is chiefly converſant in tracing reſemblances: he remarks at the ſame time, that the buſineſs of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is rather in finding differences. It may perhaps appear, on this ſuppoſition, that there is no material diſtinction between the wit and the judgment, as they both ſeem to reſult from different operations of the ſame faculty of <hi>comparing.</hi> But in reality, whether they are or are not dependant on the ſame power of the mind, they differ ſo very materially in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, that a perfect union of wit and judgment is one of the rareſt things in the world. When two diſtinct objects are unlike to each other, it is only what we expect; things are in their common way; and therefore they make no impreſſion on the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: but when two diſtinct objects have a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, we are ſtruck, we attend to them, and we are pleaſed. The mind of man has naturally a far greater alacrity and ſatisfaction in tracing reſemblances than in ſearching for differences; becauſe by making reſemblances we produce <hi>new images;</hi> we unite, we create, we enlarge our ſtock; but in making diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we offer no food at all to the imagination; the taſk itſelf is more ſevere and irkſome, and what plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure we derive from it is ſomething of a negative and indirect nature. A piece of news is told me in the morning; this, merely as a piece of news, as a fact added to my ſtock, gives me ſome pleaſure. In the evening I find there was nothing in it. What do I gain by this, but the diſſatisfaction to find that I had been impoſed upon? Hence it is that men are much
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:0244800202:266"/>
more naturally inclined to belief than to incredulity. And it is upon this principle, that the moſt ignorant and barbarous nations have frequently excelled in ſimilitudes, compariſons, metaphors, and allegories, who have been weak and backward in diſtinguiſhing and ſorting their ideas. And it is for a reaſon of this kind, that Homer and the Oriental writers, though very fond of ſimilitudes, and though they often ſtrike out ſuch as are truly admirable, they ſeldom take care to have them exact; that is, they are taken with the general reſemblance; they paint it ſtrongly, and they take no notice of the difference which may be found between the things compared.—<bibl>

            <head>WILL AND DUTY. The Author of our Being has diſpoſed us not according to our Will but his own.</head>
            <p>I CANNOT too often recommend it to the ſerious conſideration of all men, who think civil ſociety to be within the province of moral juriſdiction, that if we owe to it any duty, it is not ſubject to our will. Duties are not voluntary. Duty and will are even contradictory terms. Now, though ſociety might be at firſt a voluntary act (which in many caſes it undoubtedly was) it continues under a permanent ſtanding covenant, co-exiſting with the ſociety; and it attaches upon every individual of that ſociety, without any formal act of his own. This is war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by the general practice, ariſing out of the general ſenſe of mankind. Men without their choice derive benefits from that aſſociation; without their choice they are ſubjected to duties in conſequence of theſe benefits; and without their choice they enter into a virtual obligation as binding as any that is actual. Look through the whole of life and the whole ſyſtem of duties. Much the ſtrongeſt moral obligations are ſuch as were never the reſults of our option. I allow, that if no ſupreme ruler exiſts, wiſe to form, and potent to enforce, the moral law, there
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:0244800202:267"/>
is no ſanction to any contract, virtual or even actual, againſt the will of prevalent power. On that hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis, let any ſet of men be ſtrong enough to ſet their duties at defiance, and they ceaſe to be duties any longer. We have but this one appeal againſt irreſiſtible power—<q>
                  <l>Si genus humanum et mortalia temnitis arma,</l>
                  <l>At ſperate Deos memores fandi atque nefandi.</l>
               </q>
Taking it for granted that I do not write to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Pariſian philoſophy, I may aſſume, that the awful author of our being is the author of our place in the order of exiſtence; and that having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and marſhalled us by a divine tactic, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our will, but according to his, he has, in and by that diſpoſition, virtually ſubjected us to act the part which belongs to the place aſſigned us. We have obligations to mankind at large, which are not in conſequence of any ſpecial voluntary pact. They ariſe from the relation of man to man, and the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man to God, which relations are not matters of choice. On the contrary, the force of all the pacts which we enter into with any particular perſon amongſt them, depends upon thoſe prior obligations. In ſome caſes the ſubordinate relations are voluntary, in others they are neceſſary, but the duties are all compulſive. When we marry, the choice is volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, but the duties are not matter of choice. They are dictated by the nature of the ſituation. Dark and inſcrutable are the ways by which we come into the world. The inſtincts which give riſe to this myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terious proceſs of nature are not of our making. But out of phyſical cauſes, unknown to us, perhaps un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowable, ariſe moral duties, which, as we are able perfectly to comprehend, we are bound indiſpenſably to perform. Children are not conſenting to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, but their relation, without their actual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, binds them to its duties; or rather it implies their conſent, becauſe the preſumed conſent of every rational creature is in uniſon with the prediſpoſed
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:0244800202:268"/>
order of things. Men come in that manner into a community with the ſocial ſtate of their parents, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with all the benefits, loaded with all the duties of their ſituation. If the ſocial ties and ligaments, ſpun out of thoſe phyſical relations which are the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the commonwealth, in moſt caſes begin, and always continue, independently of our will, ſo does that relation called our country, which comprehends (as it has been well ſaid) <q rend="inline">"all the charities of all,"</q> bind us without any ſtipulation on our part. Nor are we left without powerful inſtincts to make this duty as dear and grateful to us, as it is awful and coercive. Our country is not a thing of mere phyſical locality. It conſiſts, in a great meaſure, in the ancient order into which we are born. We may have the ſame geographical ſituation, but another country; as we may have the ſame country in another ſoil. The place that determines our duty to our country is a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, civil relation.—<bibl>

               <p>OUR wonderful miniſter, as you all know, formed a new plan, a plan <hi>inſigne recens alio indictum ore,</hi> a plan for ſupporting the freedom of our conſtitution by court intrigues, and for removing its corruptions by Indian delinquency. To carry that bold para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxical deſign into execution, ſufficient funds and apt inſtruments became neceſſary. You are perfectly ſenſible that a parliamentary reform occupies his thoughts day and night, as an eſſential member in this extraordinary project. In his anxious reſearches upon this ſubject, natural inſtinct, as well as ſound policy, would direct his eyes, and ſettle his choice on Paul Benfield. Paul Benfield is the grand par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:0244800202:271"/>
reformer, the reformer to whom the whole choir of reformers bow, and to whom even the right honourable gentleman himſelf muſt yield the palm: For what region in the empire, what city, what bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, what county, what tribunal, in this kingdom, is not full of his labours. Others have been only ſpeculators; he is the grand practical reformer; and whilſt the chancellor of the exchequer pledges in vain the man and the miniſter, to increaſe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial members, Mr. Benfield has auſpiciouſly and practically begun it. Leaving far behind him even Lord Camelford's generous deſign of beſtowing Old Sarum on the Bank of England, Mr. Benfield has thrown in the borough of Cricklade to reinforce the county repreſentation. Not content with this, in order to ſtation a ſteady phalanx for all future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms, this public-ſpirited uſurer, amidſt his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable toils for the relief of India, did not forget the poor rotten conſtitution of his native country. For her, he did not diſdain to ſtoop to the trade of a wholeſale upholſterer for this houſe, to furniſh it, not with the faded tapeſtry figures of antiquated merit, ſuch as decorate, and may reproach ſome other houſes, but with real, ſolid, living patterns of true modern virtue. Paul Benfield made (reckoning himſelf) no fewer than eight members in the laſt parliament. What copious ſtreams of pure blood muſt he not have transfuſed into the veins of the preſent!</p>
               <p>But what is even more ſtriking than the real ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of this new imported patriot, is his modeſty. As ſoon as he had conferred this benefit on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, he withdrew himſelf from our applauſe. He conceived that the duties of a member of parliament (which with the elect faithful, the true believers, the <hi>Iſlam</hi> of parliamentary reform, are of little or no merit, perhaps not much better than ſpecious ſins) might be as well attended to in India as in England, and the means of reformation to parliament itſelf, be
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:0244800202:272"/>
far better provided. Mr. Benfield was therefore no ſooner elected than he ſet off for Madras, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded the longing eyes of parliament. We have never enjoyed in this houſe the luxury of beholding that minion of the human race, and contemplating that viſage, which has ſo long reflected the happineſs of nations.</p>
               <p>It was therefore not poſſible for the miniſter to conſult perſonally with this great man. What then was he do? Through a ſagacity that never failed him in theſe purſuits, he found out in Mr. Benfield's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative, his exact reſemblance. A ſpecific at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction by which he gravitates towards all ſuch cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, ſoon brought our miniſter into a cloſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with Mr. Benfield's agent and attorney; that is, with the grand contractor (whom I name to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour) Mr. Richard Atkinſon; a name that will be well remembered as long as the records of this houſe, as long as the records of the Birtiſh treaſury, as long as the monumental debt of England ſhall endure.</p>
               <p>This gentleman, Sir, acts as attorney for Mr. Paul Benfield. Every one who hears me, is well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the ſacred friendſhip, and the ſteady mutual attachment that ſubſiſts between him and the preſent miniſter. As many members as choſe to attend in the firſt ſeſſion of this parliament, can beſt tell their own feelings at the ſcenes which were then acted. How much that honourable gentleman was conſulted in the original frame and fabric of the bill, commonly called Mr. Pitt's India bill, is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter only of conjecture; though by no means difficult to divine. But the public was an indignant witneſs of the oſtentation with which that meaſure was made his own, and the authority with which he brought up clauſe after clauſe, to ſtuff and fatten the rankneſs of that corrupt act. As faſt as the clauſes were brought up to the table, they were accepted. No heſitation; no diſcuſſion. They were received by the new miniſter, not with approbation, but with
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:0244800202:273"/>
implicit ſubmiſſion. The reformation may be eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, by ſeeing who was the reformer. Paul Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field's aſſociate and agent was held up to the world as legiſlator of Indoſtan. But it was neceſſary to authenticate the coalition between the men of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue in India, and the miniſter of intrigue in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, by a ſtudied diſplay of the power of this their connecting link. Every truſt, every honour, every diſtinction, was to be heaped upon him. He was at once made a director of the India company; made an alderman of London; and to be made, if miniſtry could prevail (and I am ſorry to ſay how near, how very near they were prevailing) repreſentative of the capital of this kingdom. But to ſecure his ſervices againſt all riſque, he was brought in for a miniſterial borough. On his part, he was not wanting in zeal for the common cauſe. His advertiſements ſhew his motives, and the merits upon which he ſtood. For your miniſter, this worn-out veteran ſubmitted to enter into the duſty field of the London conteſt; and you all remember, that in the ſame virtuous cauſe, he ſubmitted to keep a ſort of public office or counting-houſe, where the whole buſineſs of the laſt general election was managed. It was openly managed by the direct agent and attorney of Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field. It was managed upon Indian principles, and for an Indian intereſt. This was the golden cup of abominations; this the chalice of the fornifications of rapine, uſury, and oppreſſion, which was held out by the gorgeous eaſtern harlot; which ſo many of the people, ſo many of the nobles of this land, had drained to the very dregs. Do you think that no reckoning was to follow this lewd debauch? that no payment was to be demanded for this riot of public drunkenneſs and national proſtitution? Here! you have it here before you. The principal of the grand election manager muſt be indemnified; accordingly the claims of Benfield and his crew muſt be put above all enquiry.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="448" facs="tcp:0244800202:274"/>For ſeveral years, Benfield appeared as the chief proprietor, as well as the chief agent, director, and controller, of this ſyſtem of debt. The worthy chairman of the company has ſtated the claims of this ſingle gentleman on the nabob of Arcot, as amounting to five hundred thouſand pounds<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Smith's Proteſt.</note>. Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly at the time of the chairman's ſtate, they might have been as high. Eight hundred thouſand had been mentioned ſome time before<note n="†" place="bottom">Madras correſpondence on this ſubject.</note>; and according to the practice of ſhifting the names of creditors in theſe tranſactions, and reducing or raiſing the debt itſelf at pleaſure, I think it not impoſſible, that at one period, the name of Benfield might have ſtood before thoſe frightful figures. But my beſt informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion goes to fix his ſhare no higher than four hundred thouſand pounds. By the ſcheme of the preſent miniſtry for adding to the principal twelve <hi>per cent.</hi> from the year 1777 to the year 1781, four hundred thouſand pounds, that ſmalleſt of the ſums ever mentioned for Mr. Benfield, will form a capital of £592,000, at ſix <hi>per cent.</hi> Thus, beſides the arrears of three years, amounting to £106,500 (which, as faſt as received, may be legally lent out at 12 <hi>per cent.</hi>) Benfield has received, by the miniſterial grant before you, an annuity of £35,520 a year, charged on the public revenues.</p>
               <p>Our mirror of miniſters of finance, did not think this enough for the ſervices of ſuch a friend as Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field. He found that Lord Macartney, in order to frighten the court of directors from the project, of obliging the nabob to give ſoucar ſecurity for his debt, aſſuring them, that if they ſhould take that ſtep, Benfield<note n="‡" place="bottom">Appendix, No. 5, A.</note> would infallibly be the ſoucar; and would thereby become the entire maſter of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natic. What Lord Macartney thought ſufficient to deter the very agents and partakers with Benfield
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:0244800202:275"/>
in his iniquities, was the inducement to the two right honourable gentlemen to order this very ſoucar ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to be given, and to recall Benfield to the city of Madras, from the ſort of decent exile, into which he had been relegated by Lord Macartney. You muſt therefore conſider Benfield, as ſoucar ſecurity for £480,000 a year, which at twenty-four <hi>per cent.</hi> (ſuppoſing him contented with that profit) will, with the intereſt of his old debt, produce an annual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of £149,520 a year.</p>
               <p>Here is a ſpecimen of the new and pure ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy created by the right honourable gentleman<note n="*" place="bottom">Right Honourable William Pitt.</note>, as the ſupport of the crown and conſtitution, againſt the old, corrupt, refractory, natural intereſts of this kingdom; and this is the grand counterpoiſe againſt all odious coalitions of theſe intereſts. A ſingle Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field outweighs them all; a criminal, who long ſince ought to have fattened the region kites with his offal, is, by his majeſty's miniſters, enthroned in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of a great kingdom, and enfeoffed with an eſtate, which in the compariſon effaces the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of all the nobility of Europe.—<bibl>

               <p>CONDORCET (though no marquis, as he ſtyled himſelf before the revolution) is a man of another ſort of birth, faſhion, and occupation from Briſſot; but in every principle, and in every diſpoſition to the loweſt as well as the higheſt and moſt determined villainies, fully his equal. He ſeconds Briſſot in the Aſſembly, and is at once his coadjutor and his rival in a newſpaper, which in his own name, and as ſucceſſor to Mr. Garat, a member alſo of the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, he has juſt ſet up in that Empire of Gazettes. Condorcet was choſen to draw the firſt declaration preſented by the Aſſembly to the King, as a threat to the Elector of Treves, and the other princes on the Rhine. In that piece, in which both Feuillans and Jacobins concurred, they declared publicly, and moſt proudly and inſolently, the principle on which they mean to proceed in their future diſputes with any of the Sovereigns in Europe, for they ſay,

His

               <p>CROMWELL, when he attempted to legalize his power, and to ſettle his conquered country in a ſtate of order, did not look for diſpenſers of juſtice in the inſtruments of his uſurpation. Quite the contrary. He ſought out with great ſolicitude and ſelection, and even from the party moſt oppoſite to his deſigns, men of weight, and decorum of character; men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained with the violence of the times, and with hands not fouled with confiſcation and ſacrilege: for he choſe an <hi>Hales</hi> for his chief juſtice, though he abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely refuſed to take his civic oaths, or to make any acknowledgment whatſoever of the legality of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Cromwell told this great lawyer, that ſince he did not approve his title, all he required of him was, to adminiſter, in a manner agreeable to his pure ſentiments and unſpotted character, that juſtice without which human ſociety cannot ſubſiſt: that it was not his particular government, but civil order itſelf, which as a judge he wiſhed him to ſupport. Cromwell knew how to ſeparate the inſtitutions expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to his uſurpation from the adminiſtration of the public juſtice of his country. For Cromwell was a man in whom ambition had not wholly ſuppreſſed, but only ſuſpended the ſentiments of religion, and the love (as far as it could conſiſt with his deſigns) of fair and honourable reputation.—<bibl>

               <p>AND now, having done my duty to the bill, let me ſay a word to the author. I ſhould leave him to his own noble ſentiments, if the unworthy and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberal language with which he has been treated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all example of parliamentary liberty, did not make a few words neceſſary; not ſo much in juſtice to him, as to my own feelings. I muſt ſay then, that it will be a diſtinction honourable to the age, that the reſcue of the greateſt number of the human race that ever were ſo grievouſly oppreſſed, from the greateſt tyranny that was ever exerciſed, has fallen to the lot of abilities and diſpoſitions equal to the taſk; that it has fallen to one who has the enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to comprehend, the ſpirit to undertake, and the eloquence to ſupport, ſo great a meaſure of hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous benevolence. His ſpirit is not owing to his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the ſtate of men and things; he well knows what ſnares are ſpread about his path, from perſonal animoſity, from court intrigues, and poſſibly from popular deluſion. But he has put to hazard his eaſe, his ſecurity, his intereſt, his power, even his darling popularity, for the benefit of a people whom he has
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:0244800202:286"/>
never ſeen. This is the road that all heroes have trod before him. He is traduced and abuſed for his ſuppoſed motives. He will remember, that obloquy is a neceſſary ingredient in the compoſition of all true glory: he will remember, that it was not only in the Roman cuſtoms, but it is in the nature and conſtitution of things, that calumny and abuſe are eſſential parts of triumph. Theſe thoughts will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a mind, which only exiſts for honour, under the burthen of temporary reproach. He is doing indeed a great good; ſuch as rarely falls to the lot, and almoſt as rarely coincides with the deſires of any man. Let him uſe his time. Let him give the whole length of the reins to his benevolence. He is now on a great eminence, where the eyes of mankind are turned to him. He may live long, he may do much. But here is the ſummit. He never can exceed what he does this day.</p>
               <p>He has faults; but they are faults that, though they may in a ſmall degree tarniſh the luſtre, and ſometimes impede the march of his abilities, have nothing in them to extinguiſh the fire of great virtues. In thoſe faults, there is no mixture of deceit, of hypocriſy, of pride, of ferocity, of complexional deſpotiſm, or want of feeling for the diſtreſſes of mankind. His are faults which might exiſt in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendant of Henry the Fourth of France, as they did exiſt in that father of his country. Henry the Fourth wiſhed that he might live to ſee a fowl in the pot of every peaſant of his kingdom. That ſentiment of homely benevolence was worth all the ſplendid ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings that are recorded of kings. But he wiſhed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps for more than could be obtained, and the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the man exceeded the power of the king. But this gentleman, a ſubject, may this day ſay this at leaſt, with truth, that he ſecures the rice in his pot to every man in India. A poet of antiquity thought it one of the firſt diſtinctions to a prince whom he meant to celebrate, that through a long ſucceſſion of
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:0244800202:287"/>
generations, he had been the progenitor of an able and virtuous citizen, who by force of the arts of peace, had corrected governments of oppreſſion, and ſuppreſſed wars of rapine.

That he was not aſhamed to avow that degree of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility. That when the choice is well made, it ſtrengthens inſtead of oppreſſing our intellect. That he who calls in the aid of an equal underſtanding, doubles his own. He who profits of a ſuperior un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, raiſes his powers to a level with the height of the ſuperior underſtanding he unites with. He had found the benefit of ſuch a junction, and would not lightly depart from it. He wiſhed almoſt, on all occaſions, that his ſentiments were underſtood to be conveyed in Mr. Fox's words; and that he wiſhed, as amongſt the greateſt benefits he could wiſh the country, an eminent ſhare of power to that right honourable gentleman; becauſe he knew that, to his great and maſterly underſtanding, he had joined the greateſt poſſible degree of that natural moderation, which is the beſt corrective of power; that he was of the moſt artleſs, candid, open, and benevolent diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; diſintereſted in the extreme; of a temper mild and placable, even to a fault; without one drop of gall in his whole conſtitution.</p>
               <p>MR.

He declared,

that he did not affect a democracy. That he always thought any of the ſimple, unbalanced governments bad; ſimple monarchy, ſimple ariſtocracy, ſimple democracy; he held them all imperfect or vicious: all were bad by themſelves: the compoſition alone was good.

               <head>GRENVILLE, MR.</head>
               <p>UNDOUBTEDLY Mr. Grenville was a firſt-rate figure in this country. With a maſculine underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a ſtout and reſolute heart, he had an appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation undiſſipated and unwearied. He took public buſineſs, not as a duty which he was to fulfil, but as a pleaſure he was to enjoy; and he ſeemed to have no delight out of this houſe, except in ſuch things as ſome way related to the buſineſs that was to be done within it. If he was ambitious, I will ſay this for him, his ambition was of a noble and generous ſtrain. It was to raiſe himſelf, not by the low pimping poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics of a court, but to win his way to power, through the laborious gradations of public ſervice; and to ſecure to himſelf a well earned rank in parliament, by a thorough knowledge of its conſtitution, and a perfect practice in all its buſineſs.</p>
               <p>Sir, if ſuch a man fell into errors, it muſt be from defects not intrinſical; they muſt be rather ſought in the particular habits of his life; which, though they do not alter the ground-work of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, yet tinge it with their own hue. He was bred in a profeſſion. He was bred to the law, which
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:0244800202:290"/>
is, in my opinion, one of the firſt and nobleſt of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſciences; a ſcience which does more to quicken and invigorate the underſtanding, than all the other kinds of learning put together; but it is not apt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in perſons very happily born, to open and to liberalize the mind exactly in the ſame proportion. Paſſing from that ſtudy he did not go very largely into the world; but plunged into buſineſs; I mean into the buſineſs of office; and the limited and fixed methods and forms eſtabliſhed there. Much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is to be had undoubtedly in that line; and there is no knowledge which is not valuable. But it may be truly ſaid, that men too much converſant in office, are rarely minds of remarkable enlargement. Their habits of office are apt to give them a turn to think the ſubſtance of buſineſs not to be much more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant than the forms in which it is conducted. Theſe forms are adapted to ordinary occaſions; and therefore perſons who are nurtured in office do ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably well, as long as things go on in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon order; but when the high roads are broken up, and the waters out, when a new and troubled ſcene is opened, and the file affords no precedent, then it is that a greater knowledge of mankind, and a far more extenſive comprehenſion of things is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite than ever office gave, or than office can ever give. Mr. Grenville thought better of the wiſdom and power of human legiſlation than in truth it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves. He conceived, and many conceived along with him, that the flouriſhing trade of this country was greatly owing to law and inſtitution, and not quite ſo much to liberty; for but too many are apt to believe regulation to be commerce, and taxes to be revenue. Among regulations, that which ſtood firſt in reputation was his idol. I mean the act of navigation. He has often profeſſed it to be ſo. The policy of that act is, I readily admit, in many reſpects well underſtood. But I do ſay, that if the act be ſuffered to run the full length of its principle, and
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:0244800202:291"/>
be not changed and modified according to the change of times and the fluctuation of circumſtances, it muſt do great miſchief, and frequently even defeat its own purpoſe.—<bibl>

His plan is original; and it is as full of genius as it is of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. It was a voyage of diſcovery; a circumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation of charity. Already the benefit of his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is felt more or leſs in every country: I hope he will anticipate his final reward, by ſeeing all its effects <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               <head>KEPPEL (LORD.)</head>
               <p>I EVER looked on Lord Keppel as one of the greateſt and beſt men of his age; and I loved, and cultivated him accordingly. He was much in my heart, and I believe I was in his to the very laſt beat. It was after his trial at Portſmouth that he gave me this picture. With what zeal and anxious affection I attended him through that his agony of glory; what part my ſon in the early ſluſh and enthuſiaſm of his virtue, and the pious paſſion with which he attached himſelf to all my connections, with what prodigality we both ſquandered ourſelves in courting almoſt every ſort of enmity for his ſake, I believe he felt, juſt as I ſhould have felt, ſuch friendſhip on ſuch an occaſion. I partook indeed of this honour, with ſeveral of the firſt, and beſt, and ableſt in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but I was behind hand with none of them; and I am ſure, that if to the eternal diſgrace of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to the total annihilation of every trace of honour and virtue in it, things had taken a different turn from what they did, I ſhould have attended him to the quarter-deck with no leſs good will and more pride, though with far other feelings, than I partook of the general flow of national joy that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the juſtice that was done to his virtue.</p>
               <p>Pardon, my Lord, the feeble garrulity of age, which loves to diffuſe itſelf in diſcourſe of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted great. At my years we live in retroſpect alone: and, wholly unfitted for the ſociety of vigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous life, we enjoy, the beſt balm to all wounds, the conſolation of friendſhip, in thoſe only whom we have loſt for ever. Feeling the loſs of Lord Kep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:0244800202:295"/>
at all times, at no time did I feel it ſo much as on the firſt day when I was attacked in the Houſe of Lords.</p>
               <p>Had he lived, that reverend form would have riſen in its place, and with a mild, parental repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion to his nephew the Duke of Bedford, he would have told him that the favour of that gracious prince, who had honoured his virtues with the government of the navy of Great Britain, and with a ſeat in the hereditary great council of his kingdom, was not undeſervedly ſhewn to the friend of the beſt portion of his life, and his faithful companion and counſellor under his rudeſt trials. He would have told him, that to whomever elſe theſe reproaches might be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming, they were not decorous in his near kindred. He would have told them that when men in that rank loſe decorum, they loſe every thing.</p>
               <p>On that day I had a loſs in Lord Keppel; but the public loſs of him in this aweful criſis—! I ſpeak from much knowledge of the perſon, he never would have liſtened to any compromiſe with the rabble rout of this Sans Culotterie of France. His good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, his reaſon, his taſte, his public duty, his principles, his prejudices, would have repelled him for ever from all connection with that horrid medley of madneſs, vice, impiety, and crime.</p>
               <p>Lord Keppel had two countries; one of deſcent and one of birth. Their intereſts and their glory are the ſame; and his mind was capacious of both. His family was noble, and it was Dutch. That is, he was of the oldeſt and pureſt nobility that Europe can boaſt, among a people renowned above all others for love of their native land. Though it was never ſhewn in inſult to any human being, Lord Kepple was ſomething high. It was a wild ſtock of pride, on which the tendereſt of all hearts had grafted the milder virtues. He valued ancient nobility; and he was not diſinclined to augment it with new honours. He valued the old nobility and the new, not as an
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:0244800202:296"/>
excuſe for inglorious ſloth, but as an incitement to virtuous activity. He conſidered it as a ſort of cure for ſelfiſhneſs and a narrow mind; conceiving that a man born in an elevated place, in himſelf was nothing, but every thing in what went before, and what was to come after him. Without much ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, but by the ſure inſtinct of ingenuous feelings, and by the dictates of plain unſophiſticated natural underſtanding, he felt, that no great Commonwealth could by any poſſibility long ſubſiſt, without a body of ſome kind or other of nobility, decorated with honour, and fortified by privilege. This nobility forms the chain that connects the ages of a nation, which otherwiſe (with Mr. Paine) would ſoon be taught that no one generation can bind another. He felt that no political fabric could be well made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome ſuch order of things as might, through a ſeries of time, afford a rational hope of ſecuring unity, coherence, conſiſtency, and ſtability to the ſtate. He felt that nothing elſe can protect it againſt the levity of courts, and the greater levity of the multitude. That to talk of hereditary monarchy without any thing elſe of hereditary reverence in the Commonwealth, was a low-minded abſurdity; fit only for thoſe deteſtable <q rend="inline">"fools aſpiring to be knaves,"</q> who began to forge in 1789, the falſe money of the French Conſtitution—That it is one fatal objection to all <hi>new</hi> fancied and <hi>new fabricated</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publics (among a people, who, once poſſeſſing ſuch an advantage, have wickedly and inſolently rejected it) that the <hi>prejudice</hi> of an old nobility is a thing that <hi>cannot</hi> be made. It may be improved, it may be corrected, it may be repleniſhed: men may be taken from it, or aggregated to it, but the <hi>thing it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> is matter of <hi>inveterate</hi> opinion, and therefore <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi> be matter of mere poſitive inſtitution. He felt, that this nobility, in fact, does not exiſt in wrong of other orders of the ſtate, but by them, and for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="471" facs="tcp:0244800202:297"/>I knew the man I ſpeak of; and, if we can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine the future, out of what we collect from the paſt, no perſon living would look with more ſcorn and horror on the impious parricide committed on all their anceſtry, and on the deſperate attainder paſſed on all their poſterity, by the Orleans, and the Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foucaults, and the Fayettes, and the Viſcomtes de Noailles, and the falſe Perigords, and the long <hi>et coetera</hi> of the perfidious Sans Culottes of the court, who like demoniacs, poſſeſſed with a ſpirit of fallen pride, and inverted ambition, abdicated their digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, diſowned their families, betrayed the moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred of all truſts, and by breaking to pieces a great link of ſociety, and all the cramps and holdings of the ſtate, brought eternal confuſion and deſolation on their country. For the fate of the miſcreant parri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides themſelves he would have had no pity. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion for the myriads of men, of whom the world was not worthy, who by their means have periſhed in priſons, or on ſcaffolds, or are pining in beggary and exile, would leave no room in his, or in any well-formed mind, for any ſuch ſenſation. We are not made at once to pity the oppreſſor and the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</p>
               <p>Looking to his Batavian deſcent, how could he bear to behold his kindred, the deſcendants of the brave nobility of Holland, whoſe blood prodigally poured out, had, more than all the canals, meers, and inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of their country, protected their indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to behold them bowed in the baſeſt ſervitude, to the baſeſt and vileſt of the human race; in ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to thoſe who, in no reſpect, were ſuperior in dignity, or could aſpire to a better place than that of hangmen to the tyrants, to whoſe ſceptered pride they had oppoſed an elevation of ſoul, that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted, and overpowered the loftineſs of Caſtile, the haughtineſs of Auſtria, and the overbearing arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of France?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="472" facs="tcp:0244800202:298"/>Could he with patience bear, that the children of that nobility, who would have deluged their country and given it to the ſea, rather than ſubmit to Louis XIV. who was then in his meridian glory, when his arms were conducted by the Turennes, by the Luxembourgs, by the Bouſſlers; when his councils were directed by the Colberts, and the Louvois; when his tribunals were filled by the Lamoignons, and the Dagueſſaus—that theſe ſhould be given up to the cruel ſport of the Pichegrus, the Jourdans, the Santerres, under the Rollands, and Briſſots, and Gorſas, and Robeſpierres, the Reubels, the Carnots, and Talliens, and Dantons, and the whole tribe of regicides, robbers, and revolutionary judges, that, from the rotten carcaſe of their own murdered country, have poured out innumerable ſwarms of the loweſt, and at once the moſt deſtructive of the claſſes of animated nature, which like columns of locuſts, have laid waſte the faireſt part of the world?</p>
               <p>Would Keppel have borne to ſee the ruin of the virtuous Patricians, that happy union of the noble and the burgher, who with ſignal prudence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, had long governed the cities of the confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Republic, the cheriſhing fathers of their country, who, denying commerce to themſelves, made it flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in a manner unexampled under their protection? Could Keppel have borne that a vile faction ſhould totally deſtroy this harmonious conſtruction, in favour of a robbing Democracy, founded on the ſpurious rights of man?</p>
               <p>He was no great clerk, but he was perfectly well verſed in the intereſts of Europe, and he could not have heard with patience that the country of Grotius, the cradle of the Law of Nations, and one of the richeſt repoſitories of all law, ſhould be taught a new code by the ignorant ſlippancy of Thomas Paine, the preſumptuous ſoppery of La Fayette, with his ſtolen rights of man in his hand, the wild profligate intrigue and turbulency of Marat, and the impious ſophiſtry
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:0244800202:299"/>
of Condorcet, in his inſolent addreſſes to the Bata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian Republic?</p>
               <p>Could Keppel, who idolized the houſe of Naſſau, who was himſelf given to England, along with the bleſſings of the Britiſh and Dutch revolutions; with revolutions of ſtability; with revolutions which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolidated and married the liberties and the intereſts of the two nations for ever, could he ſee the fountain of Britiſh liberty itſelf in ſervitude to France? Could he ſee with patience a Prince of Orange expelled as a ſort of diminutive deſpot, with every kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumely, from the country, which that family of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverers had ſo often reſcued from ſlavery, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to live in exile in another country, which owes its liberty to his houſe?</p>
               <p>Would Keppel have heard with patience, that the conduct to be held on ſuch occaſions was to become ſhort by the knees to the faction of the homicides, to intreat them quietly to retire? or if the fortune of war ſhould drive them from their firſt wicked and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked invaſion, that no ſecurity ſhould be taken, no arrangement made, no barrier formed, no alliance entered into for the ſecurity of that, which under a foreign name, is the moſt precious part of England? What would he have ſaid, if it was even propoſed that the Auſtrian Netherlands (which ought to be a barrier to Holland, and the tie of an alliance, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect her againſt any ſpecies of rule that might be erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or even be reſtored in France) ſhould be formed into a republic under her influence and dependent upon her power.—<bibl>

               <p>THIS unfortunate king (not without a large ſhare of blame to himſelf) was deluded to his ruin by a deſire to humble and reduce his nobility, clergy, and his corporate magiſtracy; not that I ſuppoſe he meant wholly to eradicate theſe bodies, in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſince effected by the democratic power: I rather believe that even Necker's deſigns did not go to that extent. With his own hand, however, Louis the XVIth pulled down the pillars which upheld his throne; and this he did, becauſe he could not bear the inconveniences which are attached to every thing human; becauſe he found himſelf cooped up, and in durance by thoſe limits which nature preſcribes to deſire and imagination; and was taught to conſider as low and degrading, that mutual dependance which Providence has ordained that all men ſhould have on one another. He is not at this minute, perhaps, cured of the dread of the power and credit like to

               <p>A MISFORTUNE it has indeed turned out to him, that he was born king of France. But misfortune is not crime, nor is indiſcretion always the greateſt guilt. I ſhall never think that a prince, the acts of whoſe whole reign were a ſeries of conceſſions to his ſubjects, who was willing to relax his authority, to remit his prerogatives, to call his people to a ſhare of freedom, not known, perhaps not deſired by their anceſtors; ſuch a prince, though he ſhould be ſubject to the common frailties attached to men and to

               <p>LOUIS the XVIth was a diligent reader of hiſtory. But the very lamp of prudence blinded him. The guide of human life led him aſtray. A ſilent revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution in the moral world preceded the political, and prepared it. It became of more importance than
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:0244800202:304"/>
ever what examples were given, and what meaſures were adopted. Their cauſes no longer lurked in the receſſes of cabinets, or in the private conſpiracies of the factious. They were no longer to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled by the force and influence of the grandees, who formerly had been able to ſtir up troubles by their diſcontents, and to quiet them by their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. The chain of ſubordination, even in cabal and ſedition, was broken in its moſt important links. It was no longer the great and the populace. Other intereſts were formed, other dependencies, other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions, other communications. The middle claſs had ſwelled far beyond its former proportions. Like whatever is the moſt effectively rich and great in ſociety, that became the ſeat of all the active poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics; and the preponderating weight to decide on them. There were all the energies by which fortune is acquired; there the conſequence of their ſucceſs. There were all the talents which aſſert their preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and are impatient of the place which ſettled ſociety preſcribes to them. Theſe deſcriptions had got between the great and the populace; and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on the lower claſſes was with them. The ſpirit of ambition had taken poſſeſſion of this claſs as violently as ever it had done of any other. They felt the importance of this ſituation. The correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence of the monied and the mercantile world, the literary intercourſe of academies; but, above all, the preſs, of which they had in a manner, entire poſſeſſion, made a kind of electric communication every where. The preſs, in reality, has made every government, in its ſpirit, democratic. Without it the great, the firſt movements could not, perhaps, have been given. But the ſpirit of ambition, now for the firſt time connected with the ſpirit of ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, was not to be reſtrained at will. There was no longer any means of arreſting a principle in its courſe. When Louis the XVIth, under the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the enemies to monarchy, meant to found
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:0244800202:305"/>
but one republic, he ſet up two. When he meant to take away half the crown of his neighbour, he loſt the whole of his own. Louis the XVIth could not countenance a new republic: yet between that dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous lodgment for an enemy, which he had erected, and his throne, he had the whole Atlantic for a ditch. He had for an outwork the Engliſh nation itſelf, friendly to liberty, adverſe to that mode of it. He was ſurrounded by a rampart of monarchies, moſt of them allied to him, and generally under his influence. Yet even thus ſecured, a republic erected under his auſpices, and dependent on his power, became fatal to his throne. The very money which he had lent to ſupport this republic, by a good faith, which to him operated as perfidy, was punctually paid to his enemies, and became a reſource in the hands of his aſſaſſins.—<bibl>

In ſome points he has but too much reſemblance to his unfortunate brother; who with all his weakneſſes, had a good underſtanding, and many parts of an excellent man, and a good King. But Monſieur, without ſuppoſing the other deficient (as he was not) excels him in general knowledge, and in a ſharp and keen obſervation, with ſomething of a better addreſs, and an happier mode of ſpeaking and of writing.

               <p>YOU aſk me what I think of the conduct of General Monk. How this affects your caſe, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell. I doubt whether you poſſeſs, in France, any perſons of a capacity to ſerve the French mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy in the ſame manner in which Monk ſerved the monarchy of England. The army which Monk commanded had been formed by Cromwell to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of diſcipline which perhaps has never been exceeded. That army was beſides of an excellent compoſition. The ſoldiers were men of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary piety after their mode, of the greateſt regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and even ſeverity of manners; brave in the field, but modeſt, quiet, and orderly, in their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; men who abhorred the idea of aſſaſſinating their officers or any other perſons; and who (they at leaſt who ſerved in this iſland) were firmly attached to thoſe generals, by whom they were well treated and ably commanded. Such an army, once gained, might be depended on. I doubt much, if you could now find a Monk, whether a Monk could find in France, ſuch an army.</p>
               <p>I certainly agree with you, that in all probability we owe our whole conſtitution to the reſtoration of the Engliſh monarchy. The ſtate of things from which Monk relieved England, was however by no means, at that time, ſo deplorable in any ſenſe, as yours is now, and under the preſent ſway is likely to continue. Cromwell had delivered England from anarchy. His government, though military and deſpotic, had been regular and orderly. Under the iron, and under the yoke, the ſoil yielded its produce. After his death, the evils of anarchy were rather dreaded than felt. Every man was yet ſafe in his houſe and in his property. But it muſt be admitted,
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:0244800202:307"/>
that Monk freed this nation from great and juſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions both of future anarchy and of probable tyranny in ſome form or other.—<bibl>

               <p>WE hear, as a reaſon for clinging to Mr. Fox at preſent, that nine years ago Mr. Pitt got into power by miſchievous intrigues with the court, with the diſſenters, and with other factious people out of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, to the diſcredit and weakening of the power of the Houſe of Commons. His conduct nine years ago I ſtill hold to be very culpable. There are, however, many things very culpable that I do not know how to puniſh. My opinion, on ſuch matters, I muſt ſubmit to the good of the ſtate, as I have done on other occaſions; and particularly with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the authors and managers of the American
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:0244800202:309"/>
war, with whom I have acted, both in office and in oppoſition, with great confidence and cordiality, though I thought many of their acts criminal and impeachable. Whilſt the miſconduct of Mr. Pitt and his aſſociates was yet recent, it was not poſſible to get Mr. Fox of himſelf to take a ſingle ſtep, or even to countenance others in taking any ſtep upon the ground of that miſconduct and falſe policy, though if the matters had been then taken up and purſued, ſuch a ſtep could not have appeared ſo evidently deſperate as now it is.—So far from pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Mr. Pitt, I know that then, and for ſome time after, ſome of Mr. Fox's friends were actually, and with no ſmall earneſtneſs, looking out to a coalition with that gentleman. For years I never heard this circumſtance of Mr. Pitt's miſconduct on that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion mentioned by Mr. Fox, either in public or in private, as a ground for oppoſition to that miniſter. All oppoſition, from that period to this very ſeſſion, has proceeded upon the ſeparate meaſures as they ſeparately aroſe, without any vindictive retroſpect to Mr. Pitt's conduct in 1784. My memory, however, may fail me. I muſt appeal to the printed debates, which, (ſo far as Mr. Fox is concerned) are unuſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally accurate.</p>
               <p>Whatever might have been in our power, at an early period, at this day I ſee no remedy for what was done in 1784. I had no great hopes even at the time, I was therefore very eager to record a remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance on the journals of the Houſe of Commons, as a caution againſt ſuch a popular deluſion in times to come; and this I then feared, and now am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, is all that could be done. I know of no way of animadverting on the crown. I know no mode of calling to account the Houſe of Lords, who threw out the India Bill, in a way not much to their credit. As little, or rather leſs, am I able to coerce the people at large, who behaved very unwiſely and intemperately on that occaſion. Mr. Pitt was then
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:0244800202:310"/>
accuſed, by me as well as others, of attempting to be miniſter, without enjoying the confidence of the Houſe of Commons, though he did enjoy the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the crown. That Houſe of Commons, whoſe confidence he did not enjoy, unfortunately did not itſelf enjoy the confidence, (though we well deſerved it) either of the crown or of the public. For want of that confidence, the then Houſe of Commons did not ſurvive the conteſt. Since that period Mr. Pitt has enjoyed the confidence of the Crown, and of the Lords, and <hi>of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> through two ſucceſſive parliaments; and I ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that he has ever ſince, and that he does ſtill, enjoy as large a portion, at leaſt, of the confidence of the people without doors, as his great rival.—<bibl>

               <head>ROCKINGHAM (MARQUES OF.)</head>
               <p>THE noble Marquis of Rockingham and his worthy colleagues, whilſt they trembled at the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of ſuch diſtreſſes as you have ſince brought upon yourſelves, were not afraid ſteadily to look in the face that glaring and dazzling influence at which the eyes of eagles have blenched. He looked in the face one of the ableſt, and, let me ſay, not the moſt ſcrupulous oppoſitions, that perhaps ever was in this houſe, and withſtood it, unaided by, even one of, the uſual ſupports of adminiſtration. He did this when he repealed the ſtamp-act. He looked in the face a perſon he had long reſpected and regarded, and whoſe aid was then particularly wanting; I mean Lord Chatham. He did this when he paſſed the declaratory act.</p>
               <p>It is now given out, for the uſual purpoſes, by the uſual emiſſaries, that Lord Rockingham did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the repeal of this act until he was bullied into it by Lord Chatham; and the reporters have gone ſo far as publicly to aſſert, in an hundred companies,
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:0244800202:311"/>
that the Honourable Gentleman under the gallery<note n="*" place="bottom">General Conway.</note>, who propoſed the repeal in the American committee, had another ſet of reſolutions in his pocket directly the reverſe of thoſe he moved. Theſe artifices of a deſperate cauſe are, at this time, ſpread abroad, with incredible care, in every part of the town, from the higheſt to the loweſt companies; as if the induſtry of the circulation were to make amends for the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity of the report.</p>
               <p>Sir, whether the noble lord is of a complexion to be bullied by Lord Chatham, or by any man, I muſt ſubmit to thoſe who know him. I confeſs, when I look back to that time, I conſider him as placed in one of the moſt trying ſituations in which, perhaps, any man ever ſtood. In the Houſe of Peers there were very few of the miniſtry, out of the noble lord's own particular connexion (except Lord Egmont, who acted, as far as I could diſcern, an honourable and manly part) that did not look to ſome other future arrangement, which warped his politics. There were in both houſes new and menacing appearances, that might very naturally drive any other, than a moſt reſolute miniſter, from his meaſure, or from his ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The houſehold troops openly revolted. The allies of miniſtry (thoſe, I mean, who ſupported ſome of their meaſures, but refuſed reſponſibility for any) endeavoured to undermine their credit, and to take ground that muſt be fatal to the ſucceſs of the very cauſe which they would be thought to countenance. The queſtion of the repeal was brought on by miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in the committee of this Houſe, in the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant when it was known that more than one court negociation was carrying on with the heads of the oppoſition. Every thing, upon every ſide, was full of traps and mines. Earth below ſhook; heaven above menaced; all the elements of miniſterial ſafety were diſſolved. It was in the mindſt of this chaos of

plots and counter-plots; it was in the midſt of this complicated warfare againſt public oppoſition and private treachery, that the firmneſs of that noble perſon was put to the proof. He never ſtirred from his ground; no, not an inch. He remained fixed and determined, in principle, in meaſure, and in conduct. He practiſed no managements. He ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured no retreat. He ſought no apology.—<bibl>

               <p>WE have had the great profeſſor and founder of <hi>the phyloſophy of vanity</hi> in England. As I had good opportunities of knowing his proceedings almoſt from day to day, he left no doubt in my mind, that he entertained no principle either to influence his heart, or to guide his underſtanding, but <hi>vanity.</hi> With this vice he was poſſeſſed to a degree little ſhort of madneſs. It is from the ſame deranged eccentric vanity, that this, the inſane <hi>Socrates</hi> of the National Aſſembly, was impelled to publiſh a mad confeſſion of his mad faults, and to attempt a new ſort of glory, from bringing hardily to light the obſcure and vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar vices which we know may ſometimes be blended with eminent talents. He has not obſerved on the nature of vanity, who does not know that it is om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivorous; that it has no choice in its food; that it is fond to talk even of its own faults and vices, as what will excite ſurprize and draw attention, and what will paſs at worſt for openneſs and candour. It was this abuſe and perverſion, which vanity makes even of hypocriſy, which has driven Rouſſeau to record a life not ſo much as chequered, or ſpotted here and there, with virtues, or even diſtinguiſhed by a ſingle good action. It is ſuch a life he chooſes to offer to the attention of mankind. It is ſuch a life, that with a wild defiance, he ſlings in the face of his Creator, whom he acknowledges only to brave.
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:0244800202:313"/>
Your aſſembly, knowing how much more powerful example is found than precept, has choſen this man (by his own account without a ſingle virtue) for a model. To him they erect their firſt ſtatue. From him they commence their ſeries of honours and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions.</p>
               <p>It is that new invented virtue which your maſters canonize, that led their moral hero conſtantly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſt the ſtores of his powerful rhetoric in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of univerſal benevolence; whilſt his heart was incapable of harbouring one ſpark of common parental affection. Benevolence to the whole ſpecies, and want of feeling for every individual with whom the profeſſors come in contact, form the character of the new philoſophy. Setting up for an unſocial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence, this their hero of vanity refuſes the juſt price of common labour, as well as the tribute which opulence owes to genius, and which, when paid, honours the giver and the receiver; and then he pleads his beggary as an excuſe for his crimes. He melts with tenderneſs for thoſe only who touch him by the remoteſt relation, and then, without one natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral pang, caſts away, as a ſort of offal and excrement, the ſpawn of his diſguſtful amours, and ſends his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to the hoſpital of foundlings. The bear loves, licks, and forms her young; but bears are not philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers. Vanity, however, finds its account in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing the train of our natural feelings. Thouſands admire the ſentimental writer; the affectionate father is hardly known in his pariſh.</p>
               <p>Under this philoſophic inſtructor in the <hi>ethics of vanity,</hi> they have attempted in France a regeneration of the moral conſtitution of man. Stateſmen, like your preſent rulers, exiſt by every thing which is ſpurious, fictitious, and falſe; by every thing which takes the man from his houſe, and ſets him on a ſtage, which makes him up an artificial creature, with painted theatric ſentiments, fit to be ſeen by the glare of candle-light, and formed to be contemplated
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:0244800202:314"/>
at a due diſtance. Vanity is too apt to prevail in all of us, and in all countries. To the improvement of Frenchmen it ſeems not abſolutely neceſſary that it ſhould be taught upon ſyſtem. But it is plain that the preſent rebellion was its legitimate offspring, and it is piouſly fed by that rebellion, with a daily dole.</p>
               <p>If the ſyſtem of inſtitution, recommended by the aſſembly, is falſe and theatric, it is becauſe their ſyſtem of government is of the ſame character. To that, and to that alone, it is ſtrictly conformable. To underſtand either, we muſt connect the morals with the politics of the legiſlators. Your practical philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, ſyſtematic in every thing, have wiſely began at the ſource. As the relation between parents and children is the firſt among the elements of vulgar, natural morality, they erect ſtatues to a wild, fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, low-minded, hard-hearted father, of fine ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral feelings; a lover of his kind, but a hater of his kindred. Your maſters reject the duties of this vulgar relation, as contrary to liberty; as not founded in the ſocial compact; and not binding according to the rights of men; becauſe the relation is not, of courſe, the reſult of <hi>free election;</hi> never ſo on the ſide of the children, not always on the part of the parents.</p>
               <p>The next relation which they regenerate by their ſtatues to Rouſſeau, is that which is next in ſanctity to that of a father. They differ from thoſe old-faſhioned thinkers, who conſidered pedagogues as ſober and venerable characters, and allied to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rental.

They ſyſtematically corrupt a very corruptible race, (for ſome time a growing nuiſance amongſt you) a ſet of pert, petulant, litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, to whom, inſtead of their proper, but ſevere, unoſtentatious duties, they aſſign the brilliant part of men of wit and pleaſure, of gay, young, military
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:0244800202:315"/>
ſparks, and danglers at toilets. They call on the riſing generation in France, to take a ſympathy in the adventures and fortunes, and they endeavour to engage their ſenſibility on the ſide of pedagogues, who betray the moſt awful family truſts, and vitiate their female pupils. They teach the people, that the debauchers of virgins, almoſt in the arms of their parents, may be ſafe inmates in their houſe, and even fit guardians of the honour of thoſe huſbands who ſucceed legally to the office which the young litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors had pre-occupied, without aſking leave of law or conſcience.</p>
               <p>Thus they diſpoſe of all the family relations of parents and children, huſbands and wives. Through this ſame inſtructor, by whom they corrupt the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, they corrupt the taſte. Taſte and elegance, though they are reckoned only among the ſmaller and ſecondary morals, yet are of no mean import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the regulation of life. A moral taſte is not of force to turn vice into virtue; but it recommends virtue with ſomething like the blandiſhments of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and it infinitely abates the evils of vice. Rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeau, a writer of great force and vivacity, is totally deſtitute of taſte in any ſenſe of the word. Your maſters, who are his ſcholars, conceive that all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement has an ariſtocratic character. The laſt age had exhauſted all its powers in giving a grace and nobleneſs to our natural appetites, and in raiſing them into higher claſs and order than ſeemed juſtly to belong to them. Through Rouſſeau, your maſters are reſolved to deſtroy theſe ariſtocratic prejudices. The paſſion called love, has ſo general and powerful an influence; it makes ſo much of the entertainment, and indeed ſo much the occupation of that part of life which decides the character for ever, that the mode and the principles on which it engages the ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy, and ſtrikes the imagination, become of the utmoſt importance to the morals and manners of every ſociety. Your rulers were well aware of this;
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:0244800202:316"/>
and in their ſyſtem of changing your manners to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate them to their politics, they found nothing ſo convenient as Rouſſeau. Through him they teach men to love after the faſhion of philoſophers; that is, they teach to men, to Frenchmen, a love without gallantry; a love without any thing of that fine flower of youthfulneſs and gentility, which places it, if not among the virtues, among the ornaments of life. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of this paſſion, naturally allied to grace and manners, they infuſe into their youth an unfaſhioned, indelicate, ſour, gloomy, ferocious medley of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantry and lewdneſs; of metaphyſical ſpeculations, blended with the coarſeſt ſenſuality. Such is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral morality of the paſſions to be found in their famous philoſopher, in his famous work of philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phic gallantry, the <hi>Nouvelle Eloiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the fence from the gallantry of preceptors is broken down, and your families are no longer protected by decent pride, and ſalutary domeſtic pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, there is but one ſtep to a frightful corruption. The rulers in the national aſſembly are in good hopes that the females of the firſt families in France may become an eaſy prey to dancing maſters, fidlers, pattern-drawers, friſeurs, and valets de chambre, and other active citizens of that deſcription, who having the entry into your houſes, and being half domeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by their ſituation, may be blended with you by regular and irregular relations. By a law, they have made theſe people your equals. By adopting the ſentiments of Rouſſeau, they have made them your rivals. In this manner, theſe great legiſlators complete their plan of levelling, and eſtabliſh their rights of men on a ſure foundation.</p>
               <p>I am certain that the writings of Rouſſeau lead directly to this kind of ſhameful evil. I have often wondered how he comes to be ſo much more admired and followed on the continent than he is here.

               <head>SAVILLE, (SIR GEORGE.)</head>
               <p>WHEN an act of great and ſignal humanity was to be done, and done with all the weight and authority that belonged to it, the world could caſt its eyes upon none but him (Sir George.) I hope that few things, which have a tendency to bleſs or to adorn life, have wholly eſcaped my obſervation in my paſſage through it. I have ſought the acquaintance of that gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and have ſeen him in all ſituations. He is a true genius; with an underſtanding vigorous, and acute, and refined, and diſtinguiſhing even to exceſs; and illuminated with a moſt undounbed, peculiar, and original caſt of imagination. With theſe he poſſeſſes many external and inſtrumental advantages; and he
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:0244800202:318"/>
makes uſe of them all. His fortune is among the largeſt; a fortune which, wholly unincumbered, as it is, with one ſingle charge from luxury, vanity, or exceſs, ſinks under the benevolence of its diſpenſer. This private benevolence, expanding itſelf into pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotiſm, renders his whole being the eſtate of the public, in which he has not reſerved a <hi>peculium</hi> for himſelf of profit, diverſion, or relaxation. During the ſeſſion, the firſt in, and the laſt out of the houſe of commons; he paſſes from the ſenate to the camp; and, ſeldom ſeeing the ſeat of his anceſtors, he is always in parliament to ſerve his country, or in the field to defend it. But in all well-wrought compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſome particulars ſtand out more eminently than the reſt; and the things which will carry his name to poſterity, are his two bills; I mean that for a limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the claims of the crown upon landed eſtates; and this for the relief of the Roman Catholics. By the former, he has emancipated property; by the latter, he has quieted conſcience; and by both, he has taught that grand leſſon to government and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,—no longer to regard each other as adverſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.—<bibl>

               <head>SAXONY (ELECTOR OF.)</head>
               <p>THE preſent Elector is a Prince of a ſafe and quiet temper, of great prudence and goodneſs. He knows that in the actual ſtate of things, not the power and reſpect belonging to Sovereigns, but their very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence depends on a reaſonable frugality. It is very certain that not one Sovereign in Europe can either promiſe for the continuance of his authority in a ſtate of indigence and inſolvency, or dares to venture on a new impoſition to relieve himſelf. Without aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning wholly the ancient magnificence of his Court, the Elector has conducted his affairs with infinitely more oeconomy than any of his predeceſſors, ſo as to reſtore his finances beyond what was thought poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:0244800202:319"/>
from the ſtate in which the ſeven years war had left Saxony. Saxony during the whole of that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful period having been in the hands of an exaſperated enemy, rigorous by reſentment, by nature, and by neceſſity, was obliged to bear, in a manner, the whole burthen of the war; in the intervals, when their allies prevailed, the inhabitants of that country were not better treated.</p>
               <p>The moderation and prudence of the preſent Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, in my opinion, rather perhaps reſpites the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles than ſecures the peace of the Electorate. The offer of the ſucceſſion to the Crown of Poland is truly critical, whether he accepts, or whether he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines it. If the States will conſent to his acceptance, it will add to the difficulties, already great, of his ſituation between the King of Pruſſia and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror. But theſe thoughts lead me too far, when I mean to ſpeak only of the interior condition of theſe Princes. It has always, however, ſome neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary connexion with their foreign politics.—<bibl>

               <head>TOWNSHEND (CHARLES.)</head>
               <p>THERE are many young members in the Houſe (ſuch of late has been the rapid ſucceſſion of public men) who never ſaw that prodigy Charles Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhend;
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:0244800202:320"/>
nor of courſe know what a ferment he was able to excite in every thing by the violent ebullition of his mixed virtues and failings. For failings he had undoubtedly—many of us remember them; we are this day conſidering the effect of them. But he had no failings which were not owing to a noble cauſe; to an ardent, generous, perhaps an immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate paſſion for fame; a paſſion which is the inſtinct of all great ſouls. He worſhipped that goddeſs whereſoever ſhe appeared; but he paid his particular devotions to her in her favorite habitation, in her choſen temple, the Houſe of Commons. Beſides the characters of the individuals that compoſe our body, it is impoſſible, Mr. Speaker, not to obſerve, that this Houſe has a collective character of its own. That character, too, however imperfect, is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amiable. Like all great public collections of men, you poſſeſs a marked love of virtue, and an abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of vice. But among vices, there is none, which the Houſe abhors in the ſame degree with <hi>obſtinacy.</hi> Obſtinacy, Sir, is certainly a great vice; and in the changeful ſtate of political affairs it is frequently the cauſe of great miſchief. It happens, however, very unfortunately, that almoſt the whole line of the great and maſculine virtues, conſtancy, gravity, magnanimity, fortitude, fidelity, and firmneſs, are cloſely allied to this diſagreeable quality, of which you have ſo juſt an abhorrence; and in their exceſs, all theſe virtues very eaſily fall into it. He, who paid ſuch a punctilious attention to all your feelings, certainly took care not to ſhock them by that vice which is the moſt diſguſtful to you.</p>
               <p>That fear of diſpleaſing thoſe who ought moſt to be pleaſed, betrayed him ſometimes into the other extreme. He had voted, and in the year 1765, had been an advocate for the ſtamp-act. Things and the diſpoſition of men's minds were changed. In ſhort, the ſtamp-act began to be no favorite in this Houſe. He therefore attended at the private meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:0244800202:321"/>
in which the reſolutions moved by a Right Honourable Gentleman was ſettled; reſolutions lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the repeal. The next day he voted for that repeal; and he would have ſpoken for it too, if an illneſs (not as was then given out a political) but to my knowledge, a very real illneſs, had not prevented it.</p>
               <p>The very next ſeſſion, as the faſhion of this world paſſeth away, the repeal began to be in as bad an odour in this Houſe as the ſtamp-act had been in the ſeſſion before. To conform to the temper which began to prevail, and to prevail moſtly amongſt thoſe moſt in power, he declared, very early in the winter, that a revenue muſt be had out of America. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly he was tied down to his engagements by ſome, who had no objection to ſuch experiments, when made at the coſt of perſons for whom they had no particular regard. The whole body of courtiers drove him onward. They always talked as if the king ſtood in a ſort of humiliated ſtate, until ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the kind ſhould be done.</p>
               <p>Here this extraordinary man, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, found himſelf in great ſtraits. To pleaſe univerſally was the object of his life; but to tax and to pleaſe, no more than to love and to be wiſe, is not given to men. However he attempted it. To render the tax palatable to the partizans of American revenue, he made a preamble, ſtating the neceſſity of ſuch a revenue. To cloſe with the American diſtinction, this revenue was <hi>external,</hi> or port duty; but again, to ſoften it to the other party, it was a duty of <hi>ſupply.</hi> To gratify the <hi>coloniſts,</hi> it was laid on Britiſh manufactures; to ſatisfy the <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of Britain,</hi> the duty was trivial, and (except that on tea, which touched only the devoted Eaſt India company) on none of the grand objects of commerce. To counterwork the American contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, the duty on tea was reduced from a ſhilling to three-pence. But to ſecure the favour of thoſe
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:0244800202:322"/>
who would tax America, the ſcene of collection was changed, and, with the reſt, it was levied in the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. What need I ſay more? This fine-ſpun ſcheme had the uſual fate of all exquiſite policy. But the original plan of the duties, and the mode of executing that plan, both aroſe, ſingly and ſolely, from a love of our applauſe. He was truly the child of the Houſe. He never thought, did, or ſaid any thing but with a view to you. He every day adapted himſelf to your diſpoſition; and adjuſted himſelf before it, as at a looking-glaſs.</p>
               <p>He had obſerved (indeed it could not eſcape him) that ſeveral perſons, infinitely his inferiors in all reſpects, had formerly rendered themſelves conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in this Houſe by one method alone. They were a race of men (I hope in God the ſpecies is extinct) who, when they roſe in their place, no man living could divine, from any known adherence to parties, to opinions, or to principles; from any order or ſyſtem in their politics; or from any ſequel or connexion in their ideas, what part they were going to take in any debate. It is aſtoniſhing how much this uncertainty, eſpecially at critical times, called the attention of all parties on ſuch men. All eyes were fixed on them, all ears open to hear them; each party gaped, and looked alternately for their vote, almoſt to the end of their ſpeeches. While the Houſe hung in this uncertainty, now the <hi>hear-hims</hi> roſe from this ſide—now they rebellowed from the other; and that party to whom they fell at length from their tremulous and dancing balance, always received them in a tempeſt of applauſe. The fortune of ſuch men was a temptation too great to be reſiſted by one, to whom, a ſingle whiff of incenſe withheld gave much greater pain, than he received delight, in the clouds of it, which daily roſe about him from the prodigal ſuperſtition of innumerable admirers. He was a candidate for contradictory honours; and his great aim was to make thoſe agree in admiration

of him who never agreed in any thing elſe.—<bibl>

               <p>IN ſtating that Walpole was driven by a popular clamour into a meaſure not to be juſtified, I do not mean wholly to excuſe his conduct. My time of obſervation did not exactly coincide with that event; but I read much of the controverſies then carried on. Several years after the conteſts of parties had ceaſed, the people were amuſed, and in a degree warmed with them. The events of that aera ſeemed then of magnitude, which the revolutions of our time have reduced to parochial importance; and the debates, which then ſhook the nation, now appear of no higher moment than a diſcuſſion in a veſtry. When I was very young, a general faſhion told me I was to admire ſome of the writings againſt that Miniſter; a little more maturity taught me as much to deſpiſe them. I obſerved one fault in his general proceeding. He never manfully put forward the entire ſtrength of his cauſe. He temporiſed; he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged; and adopting very nearly the ſentiments of his adverſaries; he oppoſed their inferences.—This, for a political commander, is the choice of a weak poſt.

If he had fallen in a common ſlaughter of libellers and blaſphemers, I could well believe that nothing more was meant than was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. But when I ſee that, for years together, full as impious, and perhaps more dangerous writings to religion, and virtue, and order, have not been pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, nor their authors diſcountenanced; that the moſt audacious libels on royal majeſty have paſſed without notice; that the moſt treaſonable invectives againſt the laws, liberties, and conſtitution of the country, have not met with the ſlighteſt animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;

I muſt conſider this as a ſhocking and ſhameleſs pretence.
