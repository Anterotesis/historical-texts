            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>PERMIT me to addreſs this Treatiſe to your peruſal: there needs a Patron whoſe Name may give the Sanction of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to what it contains; and 'tis neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that Patron ſhould be eminently ſkillfull and diſintereſted: To whom then ſhould it be addreſſed but you?</p>
            <p>The Author tho' he ſeeks no popular Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe; would be proud if the Work be found to merit your Approbation: Whoſe peculiar Succeſs in the Treatment of this Diſeaſe, gives you the higheſt Right to judge.</p>
            <p>The Attempt may perhaps be allowed ſome Praiſe, becauſe ſuch a Book is wanted: Parents generally take the Care of Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per upon themſelves; and you very will know low fataly they are deceived when they believe it attended with little Danger. You
<pb facs="tcp:0274601000:3"/>who have Benevolence will be pleaſed to ſee them inform'd of the neceſſary Care; and perhaps your Candour may allow ſome far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther merit in the Author for his Attention, to thoſe little Articles, and nice Diſtinctions, in appropriating, from the Variety of proper Medecines, ſuch as while they ſerve the general Purpoſe, will from this Choice, hare a good Effect alſo on the particular Symptoms, that ariſe in any Caſe.</p>
            <p>The great Point he has laboured is to explain to Parents the Uſe and Safety of Bleeding in this Diſorder; the Advantages of which, Phyſicians ſufficiently know; tho' there is a vulgar Prepoſſeſſion againſt that Practice.</p>
            <p>You will pardon the Omiſſion of a Name where no Deſire of Reputation has prompted the Undertaking; and permit me to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to this Addreſs, only that I am</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE misfortune of an honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able family who loſt an only child by this diſeaſe; perhaps from its unconquerable vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, but as I rather apprehend from a wrong management, has directed my at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to its nature, and the proper treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0274601000:5"/>Being removed from the intereſts of the profeſſion, I may perhaps be thought a fit perſon to write upon the ſubject uſefully: and I ſhall be happy if by a fair detail of the circumſtances, and the danger, and plain directions for avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, I may be inſtrumental to the ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome at leaſt of thoſe lives which are loſt continually by the conſequences of the Meaſles, when the diſeaſe has been thought long over; and thoſe who grieve for them, wonder of what they died.</p>
            <p>WHAT I ſhall attempt is to lay the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary information before the parents or relations of the diſeaſed. It may be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful alſo to our apothecaries: whither or no the younger phyſicians want inſtruction, in this caſe, it may not become me to judge: I hope thoſe who do want it will not be above receiving it. But there is a more eſſential reaſon why the needful ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice ſhould be directed to the parent: this is a diſeaſe in which medicines can do very little; and wherein all good is to be expected from a careful management.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0274601000:6"/>
            <p>IT cannot be deny'd that the loſt child to whoſe dear memory this work is conſecrated, had the aſſiſtance of reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able phyſicians; nor could it be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked, that while he periſhed under theſe ſkillful hands, the unattended children of the next damp cellar, got through the ſame diſeaſe with perfect ſafety.</p>
            <p>LET it not be inferred from this, that medicines are hurtful, or that care is dangerous: facts ſhould be underſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we reaſon from them; and the great rule of life is moderation. Some medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines may be uſeful, but we ſhould know, not only what theſe are, but when they are to be given; and tho' ill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed attendance may be deſtructive; yet there is no diſeaſe where a continual and judicious care is more required.</p>
            <p>To apply theſe medicines; and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect this care, is the deſign of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent treatiſe, the ſole purpoſe of which is to be of ſervice to mankind: the God of mercy grant it may be uſeful.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of the nature of the diſeaſe.</head>
               <p>THE diſeaſe called the Meaſles is an inflammatory fever of a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar kind; attended with an eruption over the whole ſurface of the body; not ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering into pimples, or producing matter as the ſmall pox, but only riſing to a ſmall heighth above the level of the ſkin; with heat, and a high red colour.</p>
               <p>THESE eruptions are not conſined to the ſurface of the body: they attack alſo the internal parts; and particularly the lungs.</p>
               <p>THEY uſually remain upon the child about four days; ſometimes a little longer, ſometimes leſs: and at the end of that time, dying away, the ſkin ſeems covered with a ſkurff like bran. The fever goes off at the ſame period; and what we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly call the Meaſles is thus at an end: but there are conſequences yet behind very dangerous when they are not expected.</p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0274601000:8"/>
               <p>THE diſeaſe is communicated by infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and moſt perſons have it once in their lives: but it never attacks any one a ſecond time. 'Tis thought to be origin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally native of Africa and to have been carried thence into Aegypt, and from Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt into our part of the world: but, however that be, it appears frequently in parts of England, where there is no cauſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to think it is brought by infection; no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> can all the care of parents prevent their children from having the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>INDEED it would not be their intereſt to do this, if they could: for thoſe who eſcape it in their infancy have it at a more advanced period of their lives; and it is then much more dangerous.</p>
               <p>THE Meaſles may break out at any ſeaſon of the year; but Spring and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn are the moſt uſual times; and when the diſeaſe once appears in a place it ſoon ſpreads: not only becauſe it is catching, but becauſe the ſame ſtate of the air,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0274601000:9"/>which cauſed it firſt to break out upon one perſon, has the like effect on more.</p>
               <p>OF the two natural ſeaſons for the Meaſles the Autumn generally produces the worſt kind. An open Spring after a mild winter frequently makes the diſeaſe allmoſt univer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>al; but it is at no part of the year attended with ſo little danger.</p>
               <p>THE ſtate of infancy is the moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to this diſtemper; and the time of life at which it generally goes off beſt, is from three to four years old. In general infants earlier than this, do not throw out the eruptions ſo freely; and, when children are at an age to eat ſtronger food, the inflammation is apt to be greater and the ſtate of the lungs more dangerous. In tender infants the great care is required to manage the time of the eruption; in chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren more advanced it is the conſequences we are to regard moſt. Nature will ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally take care of the eruption; but if great attention be not ſhewn, afterwards hectic fevers and conſumptions follow.</p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0274601000:10"/>
               <p>The Meaſles are always attended with ſome danger to grown perſons; and there are ſeaſons which make them terrible to all ages: in the Autumn of the year 1672, the Meaſles raged in ſo univerſal and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible a degree in London that they ſwept off the children like a plague: the Spring of the ſucceeding year ſhew'd the diſeaſe almoſt as univerſally in the country, but leſs dangerous. In the year 1701, there was ſuch an other ſevere viſitation; but fewer died; for a better method of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had been introduced, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the free uſe of bleeding. <hi>Sydenham</hi> the oracle of phyſicians for many years, had not fallen upon this happy expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient; and <hi>Moreton</hi> who wrote with reputation on this diſeaſe, tho' his practice in it was not altogether ſucceſsful, did not allow this help but in the firſt ſtage. The free uſe of bleeding at any period of the Meaſles when the ſymptoms called for it, was the diſcovery that took off the fatatality of the diſeaſe; and this we owe to Dr. <hi>Mead.</hi> In general thoſe who have the Meaſles in a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0274601000:11"/>good air, get better over them than ſuch as have them in London, and thoſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren naturally are in moſt danger, which are of the fulleſt and groſſeſt habits.</p>
               <p>THE purpoſe of this treatiſe is utility; therefore it will be proper to add, as the reſult of the foregoing conſiderations that thoſe parents may think themſelves moſt happy, whoſe children take this diſeaſe in the country, in a mild Spring, when a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable kind is about; when the age is from two year and a half to four and a half, and the child otherwiſe healthy and not groſs.</p>
               <p>WHEN we know what is to be wiſh'd, the next ſtep is to endeavour to obtain it; and as this diſeaſe will probably come on at ſome time of life, and may be dangerous, I think a parent may wiſely go ſo far toward inoculation in this caſe, as to take his child into the chamber where ſome one of a like age and habit has a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable kind.</p>

This is the more needful to thoſe who have not taken their child into the way of infection, becauſe a certain care is neceſſary from the firſt; and the attack cannot be known ſo early unleſs this be underſtood.</p>
               <p>It will be uſeful to conſider the diſeaſe in three ſtages; for the ſymptoms, the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and the neceſſary care differ accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to theſe three periods.

                  </head>
                  <p>THE firſt attack of the Meaſles uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally comes on at the time of the child's
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0274601000:13"/>waking in the morning; and this is more or leſs perceived as the aſſault is milder or more violent. The child is croſs peeviſh and unwilling to get up; reſtleſs; full of uneaſy motion; and toſſing his head about: and ſoon after this he begins to cough and ſneeze.</p>
                  <p>WHEN taken up and dreſſed he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of his head, the cough grows worſe, his eye-lids ſwell and lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>AFTER a few hours more he grows drowſy; cannot hold up his head, lies down, cries, and the coughing and ſneez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grow more violent. He will then not be eaſy 'till put to bed; and that is the beſt place for him. From this time he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more drowſy, but the cough inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts his ſlumbers: and thus paſſes the firſt day.</p>
                  <p>THE ſecond day his fleſh is hotter; his eye-lids are more ſwell'd and enflam'd, and the tongue is furr'd, but moiſt; the eyes
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0274601000:14"/>and noſe run more; the breathing grows difficult; and a ſickneſs at the ſtomach comes on, with a total loſs of appetite, and a continual thirſt. The ſickneſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing the child generally vomits. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times this ſymptom comes on at the very firſt attack; ſometimes it does not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen at all; this, and other like variations depending on the degree of the diſeaſe, and condition of the body Sometimes a ſlight purging takes the place of the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting; and thus cloſes the firſt period of the diſeaſe.</p>

Let the air of the room be often refreſhed by opening the door; but defend the child carefully from the draught that comes in, by cloſing the curtains on that ſide.</p>
               <p>AS ſoon as he is in bed let him be blooded in the arm; or back of the hand. The proper quantity is about <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r ounces for a child of four years old: but a little more may be ſpared in groſs habits, and in very tender ones, leſs will anſwer the intention.</p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0274601000:18"/>
               <p>IF he has had one ſtool that day it is ſufficient; if not, it will be neceſſary to give him a glyſter. This ſhould be made of a quarter of a pint of broth of chick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens guts, with a ſpoonful of oil of ſweet almonds, a ſpoonful of powder ſugar, and four ſpoonfulls of milk.</p>
               <p>'TIS common to uſe olive oil in glyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; but it is wrong: there is ſalt added to all the olive oils before they are ſent over; and this tends to irritate, which is not the intention. On ſuch little circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances as theſe the life of a child often depends. In the Meaſles the bowels muſt be kept open; but yet we are to fear a violent purging. Such a ſymptom often comes on in the natural courſe of the diſeaſe; and none is more dangerous. To ſtop it, is to kill the patient; yet if it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues uncheckd it often takes him off in the end; by remaining upon him when the diſeaſe is over, and bringing on a fatal decay, attended with an unconquerable hectic fever. This is one of the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences againſt which we are to guard,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0274601000:19"/>even in the natural courſe of the Meaſles; let us therefore be very careful not to give a tendency that way by careleſsneſs, or an ill choice of remedies.</p>
               <p>THE child will have no appetite for food; nor will it be proper he ſhould eat any thing. Yet a little nouriſhment may be given at times by the uſe of barley-water, with milk. The barley-water ſhould be made of pearl barley; and about one fourth part milk added to it. Twice or three times a day he ſhould have a little of this warm.</p>
               <p>THE cough will be troubleſome now tho' it will in ſome degree abate, as the eruption comes out more fully: it may be greatly eaſed at the preſent period by a pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toral infuſion, and the ſame medicine properly prepared will alſo prevent an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation on the lungs, and will anſwer at the ſame time the needfull purpoſe of diluting.</p>
               <p>TAKE raiſins ſton'd one ounce, liquo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice root bruiſed a quarter of an ounce,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0274601000:20"/>half an ounce of the leaves of white hoar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hound freſh gathered; nitre ten grains, and whole linſeed a ſpoonful: put theſe into a clean ſtone jar, and pour upon them a quart of boiling water: let it ſtand covered up two hours, then ſtrain it off without preſſing; and let the child take half a tea cup full of it juſt warm'd once in three hours.</p>
               <p>THE leaves of colts foot or ſcabious, are more commonly uſed than hoarhound, in pectoral infuſions, but this herb is of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture highly ſuperior to them; it poſſeſſes the ſame virtue of eaſing a cough that thoſe and the other pectoral herbs have, but it has beſide a gentle, yet always prevalent quality of preventing obſtructions in the viſcera, and particularly of the lungs: there always is inflammation where there is obſtruction; and wherever there is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation we have alſo a right to fear obſtruction, this is a great danger in the Meaſles; indeed it is the great object of fear, tho' it do not wear a terrible form thus early. This herb in the pectoral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion will do more than many medicines to prevent it. If the virtues of engliſh
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0274601000:21"/>herbs were more regarded, the practice of phyſick would be much more ſucceſsful.</p>
               <p>WITH theſe helps, the time from the firſt attack to the beginning of the erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will paſs without danger. Reſtleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and a cough muſt be expected; but the child will have as much eaſe as the nature of the caſe will allow, and the parent may be ſecure that he is ſafe.</p>

               <p>WHEN the eruption begins to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, the child muſt be kept a little warmer than before; but ſtill there muſt be a free and pure air in the room. The great ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed in the bed, to the chin; and there is no way of doing this but by conſtant attendance: for children cannot be peſuaded; and nothing is worſe than to check the eruption. The cough always becomes more violent upon any
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0274601000:22"/>miſmanagement of this kind, and all the troubleſome ſymptoms encreaſe.</p>
               <p>GREAT attention muſt now be had to the pulſe, and to the condition of the bowells. Some degree of fever there muſt be, and this will raiſe the pulſe; but if it be too full, as well as too quick, probably then another bleeding will be required. 'Tis natural to fear this would check the eruption; the phyſicians of the laſt age thought ſo; and from their practice and writings that opinion became univerſal: but it is an error. When there is this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication in the pulſe, when the cough in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encreaſes, and the breath grows more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, the neceſſity of another bleeding is evident; and inſtead of the effect of check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the eruptions, they will be ſeen to come out the fuller and more freely for it.</p>
               <p>THE child ſhould continue to have one ſtool in the day: if he have two there is no harm; but if more than this it is wrong in the other extream; aud ſome care muſt be taken on that head. If there have
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0274601000:23"/>been no ſtool in the whole day, there muſt be a glyſter given toward evening: this may be the ſame as before directed.</p>
               <p>WITH regard to checking the too large number of ſtools, a great deal of caution is required; becauſe of the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite danger: and the firſt attempt muſt be to do it, in the courſe of thoſe medicines which are taken for the cough.</p>
               <p>AS the child will be now weaker, and leſs able to cough up, ſomething will be neceſſary to eaſe that ſymptom beſide the pectoral infuſion; not that this is to be omitted, for it is a good diluter and has o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther excellent qualities, but with it muſt be joined ſomething farther. A great eaſe and relief may be had at this period by an oily linctus; and nearly equal good by a mucilaginous one with gum tragacanth. One or other of theſe will be neceſſary and the condition of the bowells will give the direction which ſhould be uſed; for the oil will tend to open them; and the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0274601000:24"/>mucilaginous one is in ſome degree of a contrary quality.</p>
               <p>THEREFORE if the child have not one ſtool a day during the time of the erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, let the following linctus be us'd.</p>
               <p>RUB in a marble mortar a quarter of an ounce of loaf ſugar to powder, put to this four ſpoonfulls of oil of ſweet almonds and four ſpoonfulls of ſyrup of marſhmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, mix them well together, and put this in a cup. Bruiſe the end of a piece of clean liquorice root 'till it is ſhaggy like a bruſh, and let this be dipt into it, and and ſtirr'd about: ſome of the linctus will ſtick to it, which the child will ſuck off with great pleaſure, let him thus take a little of it once in two or three hours, when the cough is moſt troubleſome.</p>
               <p>ON the other hand if the ſtools be more than two in a day, inſtead of this, make up the following. Take conſerve of red roſes one ounce, ſyrup of quinces an ounce and a half, compound powder of gumm
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0274601000:25"/>tragacanth two ſcruples: mix theſe well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and let this linctus be taken in the ſame manner as the other. Either of theſe will eaſe the cough, and there will be a great advantage in uſing one or the other, according to the habit of the body.</p>
               <p>IN caſes where the bowells are in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly good ſtate, a ſpermaceti emulſion may be given in the place of theſe. It will have as much power over the cough, and will no way effect the ſtools: it is made thus.</p>
               <p>RUB to powder in a marble mortar three drachms of ſpermaceti, and the ſame quantity of treble refin'd ſugar, put to theſe the yolk of an egg, and when they are well mixed add half a pint of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon water and three quarters of an ounce of balſamick ſyrup. Let a ſpoonful of this be given every three or four hours, always ſhaking it well together.</p>
               <p>IF the body is bound, and the uſe of the oily linctus do not anſwer the purpoſe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0274601000:26"/>of keeping up at leaſt one ſtool a day, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe muſt be had to the ſame glyſter as was before directed, and it muſt be given every evening; for nothing more muſt be done by medicines. But in the other caſe, in a tendency to a purging, if the mucila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginous linctus does not take effect we may give hartshorn drink, carefully prepared and in a ſmall quantity: it is to be made thus. Boil an ounce of hartshorn in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in a quart of ſpring water for ten mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes; then let it ſtand to ſettle, ſtrain it off and add half an ounce of the fineſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar. Let the child take two ſpoonfulls of this, juſt warm'd, once in three hours: this with the effect of the mucilaginous linctus, will probably check the diſorder of the bowels.</p>
               <p>HE muſt continue taking the pectoral infuſion; and if theſe medicines do not ſurfficiently anſwer the purpoſe, it will be proper to add half a drachm of the gum tragacanth whole, to the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients, the next time that infuſion is
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0274601000:27"/>made. This will not entirely diſſolve; but it will greatly help the medecine.</p>
               <p>IF the number of ſtools has weakened the child, he may have a jelly of harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn warm'd, and given him a little at a time to recruit his ſtrength; but in the other caſe of the want of ſtools, this muſt not be allowed, nor will it be neceſſary.</p>
               <p>WITH theſe aſſiſtances and a careful attendance, the eruptions will come out regularly, the face and breaſt will be firſt cover'd with them, then the back of the hands and the legs: all the time the child will be kept tolerably eaſy; and the pulſe no more raiſed than is neceſſary to the good courſe of the diſorder.</p>
               <p>IF at any time the eruptions ſeem to deaden before it has come to the heighth a little more warmth in the room, and a free uſe of the pectoral infuſion warm'd, will bring them out again freſh and full.</p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0274601000:28"/>
               <p>NO heating me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>icines under the name of cordials, or with the miſt ken intention of keeping them out, muſt be allowed: they will not be neceſſary; and they will certainly do hurt in the end. This cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is needful in all families, becauſe the error is common. Apothecaries are apt to throw in hot medicines under the notion of ſweats, and the good women are fond of ſaffron: both are wrong; they encreaſe the fever, and the tendency to inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is the great thing we have to fear: they always make the breathing dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult; and uſually encreaſe the cough.</p>
               <p>THE great danger is the diſtemper falling upon the lungs in its decline, and theſe he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ting medicines give an early tendency to that miſchief. If the child be kept from toſſing oſſ the cloaths, thoſe warm dilut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things we have ordered, will keep the ſkin moiſt; which is all that need be wiſh'd: and the air of the room may be kept warm enough for this, without ſtif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling the infant by ſhutting up all the doors and windows, which making the breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0274601000:29"/>difficult, will encreaſe both the cough and inflammation.</p>
               <p>THE eyes will run, and the eyelids will ſwell and look red in this ſtate of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe it is to be expected: and it will give the child uneaſineſs whatever we can do: but this will be leſs, as the management is more careful in other reſpects; and it may be relieved by frequent waſhing the eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids with a mixture, of two parts skim'd milk and one part roſe water, made juſt warm. Thus he will be ſafely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted thro' the ſecond ſtage of the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>IN this courſe there is very little medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine needed, unleſs in a tendency to ſome bad ſymptom; and what are here directed in thoſe caſes are perfectly innocent; yet they will be found ſufficient. A great deal of care is indeed directed; but why ſhoud that be refuſed? the diſeaſe is but of ſhort continuance; and a neglect of this atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance during thoſe few days may entail certain miſery, or death upon the infant.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0274601000:30"/>We are not to ſuppoſe the children of the poor eſcape always, becauſe we ſee them get ſafely, as we think, thro' the diſtemper. They often periſh by coughs and hecticks, which are the conſequences of the Meaſles, tho' not known to be ſo; and few diſeaſes load our hoſpitals more than the effects of this.</p>
               <p>CARE and a continual good manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thro' this ſtage of the diſtemper is the great ſecurity; and let the parent ſee this care is taken. Children are very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging to thoſe who are about them, but all natures are not equally capable of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs: an affectionate ſervant to nurſe them will be more than all medicines; but we ſhou'd ſee often that this attention is really ſhewn, and this care duly taken.</p>
               <p>A nurſe properly inſtructed would be better in this diſeaſe then an army of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; and if it were the cuſtom to employ ſuch, we ſhould ſee the deaths from the age of ſix to nine decreaſe extremely in our bills of mortality.</p>

               <p>THE third ſtage of the Meaſles which we call the decline, takes in the time from the compleat fullneſs of the eruption, till its going off from the whole body: This is uſually the ſpace of two days. The eruptions upon the face and breaſt keep out till thoſe upon the legs are fully raiſed; when they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, the whole body is cov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>red with the Meaſles; and they begin immediately after to die away.</p>
               <p>LET this period be attentively watched, for it requires care: as the eruption goes off, other ſymptoms often come on, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when the diſeaſe has been careleſly or ignorantly treated; and theſe are more dangerous than the firſt.</p>
               <p>THE firſt ſign of the decay of erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or the decline of the diſeaſe, is a
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0274601000:32"/>whitiſh roughneſs on the chin and upper lip; then the eruptions upon the cheeks become rough and tade away; and thoſe of the body, legs, and arms, go off next in the ſame manner.</p>

                  </gap> off: if they do, it ſhews a neceſſity of immediate bleeding.</p>
               <p>THE cough naturally encreaſes as the eruption goes away; eſpecially when care has been wanting in the courſe of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe; and this is another certain indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for immediate bleeding.</p>
               <p>IF the breathing grow difficult, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo an equal notice of the want of that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. Theſe ſymptoms declare the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of doing it when the eruptions are dying off: it is always proper to be done after they are all gone: all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is that in this caſe it muſt be done one day ſooner.</p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0274601000:33"/>
               <p>WHEN children have been in a good ſtate of body, at the time of the attack, and the diſeaſe has been conducted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out neglect or error, during the two pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding ſtages; the eruption goes off with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any aggravation of the other ſymptoms, and the cough will by degrees grow mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. This is a ſtate that ſhould make the parent very happy: but let it not lull him into a falſe ſecurity. Still let the child be blooded: it will never do harm: and it is always neceſſary; though the neceſſity be not equally ſeen. The ſmall remains of the cough will be taken off by one bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: which otherwiſe would have hung upon the child, and would have encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the firſt cold, and entailed great danger.</p>
               <p>DURING the two days of the decline of the diſeaſe, the ſame attention muſt be had to the ſtate of the body as throughout the reſt of the illneſs. For 'tis an inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that we principally fear; and a coſtive habit will greatly tend to bring it on. The
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0274601000:34"/>contrary danger of a purging ſucceeding the Meaſles, is now alſo to be guarded againſt with equal care: if the conſtitution ſhew that tendency.</p>
               <p>LET the parent have in mind theſe two ſources of ſucceeding miſchief. He has been told the Meaſles are apt to fix in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off, either upon the lungs, or bowels, bringing on in the end a conſumption, or a hectic; and let him now take care to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the firſt tendency to either of theſe diſeaſes. This tendency to one or other of them, always appears in the two days now conſidered; and great evils are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by ſlight means, if they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd in their beginnings. Now new me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decine is needed at this period, except the ſlight change of oil for ſperma ceti, in the linctus; nor any new care: only a choice of the moſt proper among thoſe eaſy ones we have before mentioned, and a ſtrict contrinuace of the attention.</p>
               <p>ONE or two ſtools muſt be expected each of theſe days, and a choice muſt be

This is the general medecine to be given in the decline of the Meaſles; but in caſe of a purging coming on, it muſt not be allowed; but recourſe muſt be had to the mucilaginous linctus directed in the preceding chapter.</p>

               <p>IF the eyes continue ſore, the ſame mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of milk and roſe water warm muſt be uſed frequently, to waſh them, and the child muſt not be placed ſo as to face a ſtrong light. If they are ſo bad as to be very painful, a piece of green ſilk ſhou'd be contrived to fall over them: and this with frequent gentle waſhing, will keep them eaſy 'till the next ſtage; the neceſſary management of which will carry off the inflammation entirely.</p>
               <p>SOMETIMES the mouth is very ſore at this period of the Meaſles, and in this caſe a pleaſant gargle muſt be made up of ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of mulberries and ſpring water, two ſpoonfuls of the ſyrup to a quarter of a pint of the water will be ſufficient: the beſt way of uſing it is with a ſmall ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe; but if the little patient can be taught to gargle his mouth himſelf and ſpit it out again, nothing can do better.</p>
               <p>IF the child has not had the thruſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; it will be apt to come on after the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0274601000:37"/>Meaſles, eſpecially if they have been vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. This firſt appears in a ſoreneſs of the mouth, and the parent will know it by the round form of the ſmall ſores with their white edges. In this caſe a violent purging uſually follows: therefore the great caution muſt be in the choice of thoſe medecines directed before, to prevent it. Aſtringents, or the common medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines for ſtoping a looſeneſs, would in this be in the higheſt degree dangerous: bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing has been declared neceſſary, in this ſtage of the diſorder; and the ſooner it is done upon ſuch an appearance the better. It will go farther toward ſtoping the purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than any medecine whatſoever; and will make thoſe ſafe and gentle ones be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore directed take their effect.</p>
               <p>IT will be proper that for theſe two days of the decline of the diſorder, the room be kept ſomewhat cooler than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; the purer the air is, the leſs labour have the lungs in breathing, and any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction will be apt to create inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0274601000:38"/>in a caſe where nature has too much tendency that way.</p>
               <p>ON the firſt of theſe two days it will be proper to give the child a jelly, warmed, and taken a little at a time: on the ſecond, his appetite will begin to return and he may be allowed a bread pudding. Let him be taken out of bed at noon, on the latter of theſe days; and ſit up three or four hours: not longer; for this will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh him, but more would fatigue him. Let his drink be only the pectoral infuſion or the hartshorn decoction, according to the condition of his body; and let the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt care be taken to put him on a warm dreſs for the hours he is to be up. Tho' tolerably pure air is neceſſary for his breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eaſily, nothing would be ſo dangerous as catching cold.</p>
               <p>When the child is laid in his bed again, on the evening of the ſecond day of this ſtage, we may pronounce the Meaſles to be over: but there are conſequences we have nam'd, which may be very terrible,

               <p>THERE is always a tendency in the decline of the Meaſles to their fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling either upon the lungs, or on the bowels. Sometimes this is apparent, and alarming; often it is ſo ſlight as to paſs unregarded.

                  </gap>her of theſe parts is violent; but perhaps it is more fatal when leſs perceived, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it will be ſtrengthened by neglect. Probably the ſymptoms will be ſlight when a child has been treated during the courſe of the diſeaſe, according to r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>id down; but let them not be for that reaſon over looked. Let not the parent who has preſerved him. thro' the diſtemper, grow negligent of him afterwards: this will be worſe than to have neglected him in the begining.</p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0274601000:40"/>
               <p>BLEEDING and purging are always ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary after the Meaſles. If the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms have required bleeding in the firſt and ſecond ſtage, or in the firſt and third, this purpoſe will have been anſwered; and only the purging will now remain ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary under that head: but if the child has not been blooded at all; or only in the firſt ſtage, it is needful to repeat it after the decline.</p>
               <p>LET the quantity taken away be about four ounces. The beſt time in this caſe, is the day after the diſeaſe is over; that is the morning following, the ſecond day of the decline.</p>
               <p>THE day following let him take a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle purge. The moſt proper is rhubarb, becauſe we are ſtill to have a regard to the danger of a loſeneſs coming on: it will be proper to guard alſo againſt thoſe ſharp humours, which often fall upon the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and bowels after this diſeaſe. Therefore let the purge be the following powder. Take powder of rhubarb ten
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0274601000:41"/>grains, prepared oiſter ſhells fix grains, mix this in a little barley water and give it in the morning.</p>
               <p>THE doſe here directed, is what in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral will anſwer the purpoſe for a child of the age, at which we have ſuppoſed the Meaſles to have come on; but in this reſpect there is no rule, but the particular conſtitution of every one. The quantity of rhubarb muſt be encreaſed if this is not found ſufficient; or diminiſhed if this prove more powerful than intended: but 'tis likely to err in this doſe on the ſafe ſide; for it is leſs rather than more, than will uſually be needed. The intent is, that it ſhould give about four ſtools; and inſtead of barley water, the child ſhould be allowed with this ſome very weak thin and clear mutton broth. This purge muſt be repeated every other, or every third day, according to the infants ſtrength, 'till he has taken three doſes.</p>
               <p>WHETHER any thing more than this will be abſolutely neceſſary, is not eaſy
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0274601000:42"/>to ſay: probably in the milder caſes there will not; but where any ſymptoms of a diſorder of the lungs; when the cough re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains; or the breathing is difficult, or when weakneſs, waſting of fleſh, want of appetite, and a lurking fever follow; the country air and aſſes milk will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. In all caſes where the parents circumſtances will permit the expence, theſe ſhould be uſed; the ſeeds of future miſchief often lie deep conceal'd, after this diſeaſe, and they will be as certain in that caſe to deſtroy the child at a diſtance of time afterwards, as the diſorders, brought on immediately with more violent ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms.</p>
               <p>THEREFORE the beſt courſe is after he has taken two of the three doſes of phyſick, to remove him into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; chuſing a dry ſituation and mild clear air.</p>
               <p>WITHOUT ſo much caution the means uſed to preſerve him, might be to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves deſtructive; a damp houſe in the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0274601000:43"/>country will give colds as well as in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; and the ſharp thin bleak air, of hilly and expoſed places, will be too piercing for ſuch a child: it will probably throw him into that hectic, which all the care was taken to avoid.</p>
               <p>THE beſt ſituation is on ariſing ground; but not an abſolute hill; defended from the north and north eaſt; open to the fouth; and where there is not a great deal of timber growing, nor much ſtanding water.</p>
               <p>IN ſuch a place let the child recruit his ſtrength, and get over the laſt remains of the diſeaſe, by a regular diet and due ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe. With reſpect to food, he muſt be very ſlowly brought to butcher's meat: puddings and a little boiled chicken, ſhou'd be all, for the firſt eight or ten days: then by degrees broth, carefully made; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards a little at a time, veal or lamb: nothing ſtronger muſt be allowed while he is under the courſe of this regimen.</p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0274601000:44"/>
               <p>EVERY morning three quarters of an hour before he gets up, give him a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a pint of aſſes milk; and the ſame quantity in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>IF the aſſes milk turns ſour upon his ſtomach, a little prepared oiſter ſhell muſt be given with it, for the firſt two or three days: and if it has a tendency to run thro' him, and the ſame powder does not prevent it ſufficiently, a little ſugar of roſes or the conſerve, muſt be mix'd with it, 'till that ſymptom is over. If the cough continues, which is not likely with this regimen, he may take the ſperma ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti emulſion as he did during the illneſs.</p>
               <p>EXERCISE, and the free enjoyment of the ſweet air of the country, are eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial parts of this method; but the eye of the parent ought to be alſo there: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe much miſchief may follow. A change of air takes the immediate effect of giving any perſon ſpirits, and children feel this more ſtrongly than grown people: therefore if the little patient be not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0274601000:45"/>he will be apt to uſe more exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe than is proper.</p>
               <p>HE muſt not be permitted to go out in the morning before the air is warm, and the ground thoroughly dry; nor to remain out 'till the cool and damp of the evening. The middle hours of the day are the wholeſome ones; and by the aſſiſtance of gentle exerciſe and the free air of that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, he will preſently recover.</p>
               <p>A ſervant, or the parent himſelf ſhou'd have him by the hand, all the time he is out for the fiſt two or three days; for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therewiſe he will naturally run about, or uſe too much motion. The lungs are tender after this diſeaſe; and violent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe quickens the breath, and puts them into a kind of convulſion. It muſt be by degrees they are brought to their ſtrength; not thus diſturbed whilſt the diſeaſe is ſcarce over.</p>
               <p>IN bad days the child muſt be kept en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely within doors: for once taking cold,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0274601000:46"/>will at this critical time ſpoil all that has been doing. With this care, about three weeks will perfectly reſtore him.</p>
               <p>FOR thoſe who cannot give their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren the country air, aſſes milk ſhould be very regularly given; and all the other cautions here directed, us'd exactly. After this the child may be determined to be perfectly cured; and to have eſcaped that danger from this diſeaſe, which takes off thouſands unſeen, for one who falls by it openly, and without the knowledge of his relations, that 'tis the Meaſles which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him.</p>
               <p>THUS we may cloſe the account of this diſeaſe as it uſually appears: but particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar caſes afford peculiar circumſtances, and from thoſe ariſe uncommon ſymptoms. Theſe we are to deſcribe: for the parent ſhou'd not be left uninform'd of any thing; much leſs of thoſe accidents which are leſs common and more dangerous than the uſual appearances.</p>

               <p>CONVULSIONS are alarming ſymptoms in the Meaſles: they appear in the latter end of the firſt ſtage; when the eruptions ſhou'd be coming out. Let the parent fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſee his child at this time; ſleeping as well as waking; and regard all his little mot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ons. Much toſſing about ſhews a ſtruggle of nature, and preſages the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper will be violent; and if there are twitchings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and abſolute convulſions he muſt be prepared for worſe ſymptoms.</p>
               <p>IF the convulſions are violent, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption will not come out kindly 'till they
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0274601000:48"/>are allayed. At their firſt appearance let proper medicines be given againſt them, and of theſe Tincture of Caſtor is the beſt.</p>
               <p>MIX together rue water five ounces, ſyrup of piony flowers ſix drachms, and tincture of caſtor a drachm and a half, ſhake them up, and give too ſpoonfuls once in three hours; if the convulſed mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions do not abate upon this, the addition of a little prepared oiſter ſhells will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably give it full effect. The mixture ſhou'd be made a freſh: and it will be a k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd of pearl julep. To five ounces of rue water, add a quarter of an ounce of the fineſt ſugar, and half a drachm of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared oiſter ſhell with the ſame quantity of tincture of caſtor. Let it be taken as the other. All the time let the child be kept warm, and give him frequently ſome of the pectoral infuſion. Probably the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions will go off after two or three doſes, if he continues in a gentle ſtate of perſpiration; and the eruptions will then come out in their proper manner.</p>
               <p>A violent purging ſometimes rages, from the very beginning of this diſeaſe; and encreaſes hourly, ſo as to threaten death. This is a nice point to conduct: the means before directed have been natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0274601000:49"/>us'd, tho' without ſucceſs; and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute aſtringents would be immediate death: the courſe of the diſorder alſo threatens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, as certain though not ſo ſudden. The following decoction is perfectly ſafe; and yet with due management will prove effectual.</p>
               <p>SLICE one ounce of freſh comfry roof, put it into three pints of ſpring water, add half a drachm of gumm tragacanth whole, half an ounce of burnt hartſhorn; and a quarter of an ounce of prepared oiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhells: let this boil five or ſix minutes, then ſtrain it off while hot, thro' a flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel bag: ſet it to ſettle, and to the clear liquor, add half an ounce of ſugar of roſes. It muſt be given warm two ſpoonfuls after every ſtool.</p>
               <p>IF this does not check the purging, bleeding at the arm muſt be repeated; and the child muſt be kept continually in a ſtate of gentle perſpiration. The medicine being then continued will ſeldom fail to take effect: then let the doſe following be leſſened, and the uſe of it left off by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. The intent is, to reduce the bowels to a ſtate of affording two ſtools a day, and not more; and when this decoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion once takes effect, it will be eaſy to bring them to that condition by its regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated uſe.</p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:0274601000:50"/>
               <p>THIS diſeaſe is not ſo regular, but that the bad ſymptoms of one ſtage, may be ſhew themſelves in another. Convulſions may come on during the time of the erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and ſo may the purging. The ſame means are to be uſed, as have been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected already: but there is a ſymptom in a manner peculiar to the ſecond ſtage, and more alarming than any, this a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of ſwallowing and of fetching breath. Children moſt liable to this, are thoſe of groſs habits, and ſuch as have been coſtive during the firſt ſtage.</p>
               <p>THEREFORE if the child be of a groſs body, let five ounces of blood be taken away inſtead of four, at the time of the attack; and after this, if a high full pulſe, a great quantity and high ſwelling of the eruptions, and a fiery aſpect of the face appear tegether, let the bleeding be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated on the ſecond day of the eruption, but in a ſomewhat ſmaller quantity. The Meaſles will come out the more kindly, and it will prevent that ſuffocation which may elſe be expected toward their height. Two glyſters ſhould be given in the four and twenty hours, if nature does nothing that way herſelf; and a plentiful uſe of the pectoral infuſion muſt keep the child conſtantly in a ſtate of gentle perſpiration.</p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0274601000:51"/>
               <p>IF notwithſtanding theſe precautions, the breath grows more difficult, the face ſwells, and the eyelids look thick and red, this ſymptom is certainly to be expected tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard the heighth: and it will be neceſſary to bleed again. There is no other alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native but that or death.</p>
               <p>LET no one fear theſe bleedings: nature ſhews that ſhe requires them; and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief they give is like a miracle; for 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate, and certain. Thoſe who have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the bleedings have often been convinced by this, and it would be happy if their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample could alſo convince others.</p>
               <p>IN this caſe more than the uſual quantity of blood often is neceſſary to be taken away; five or ſix ounces however will at any time be ſufficient: the ſtrength of the child, and violence of the ſymptoms muſt direct; for there can be no general rule for the quantity; tho' the neceſſity of doing it, is without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</p>
               <p>WHEN this frightful ſymptom is once t ken away, it rarely returns. However, all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions ſhould be uſed againſt ſuch an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. The bowels muſt be kept open; and the pectoral infuſion drank very plentifully and the child muſt be kept moſt carefully from taking cold. If it ſhould return, there
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0274601000:52"/>will be no poſſible relief but by the repetition once more of the bleeding. This is far from a deſireable thing, therefore let all poſſible caution be uſed to prevent the neceſſity.</p>
               <p>AN inflammation of the eyes, as well as eyelids, ſometimes appears at the height of the Meaſles, and becomes not only very painful but dangerous. The ſame ſtate of the blood which in one child occaſions the laſt nam'd ſymptoms, will in another bring on this; and therefore the relief muſt be the ſame. Bleeding is the certain remedy.</p>
               <p>BY the frequent mention here made of bleeding, let not the parent ſuppoſe it is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be ſo very often repeated in any one caſe. Thoſe who caſt a ſlight eye over theſe pages may be led to make this miſtake, for being the great relief in almoſt all the bad ſymptoms, it cannot but have been nam'd under each of theſe heads. As to the quantity directed to be taken away, that is moderate; and in very mild kinds, once bleeding is ſufficient; for being done in time it prevents thoſe ſymptoms which wou'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe make it neceſſary afterwards: in caſes ſomewhat worſe, twice will be ſufficient; this takes away but eight ounces of blood, which a child may ſpare without hurt, in an inflammatory diſorder. In the worſt ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, a third bleeding may be needful: this is very rarely the caſe, and I have never ſeen a neceſſity for more. To ſpeak with free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0274601000:53"/>I never ſaw an inſtance wheren three bleedings were neceſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ry from the abſolute violence of the diſeaſe; tho' ſometimes from ill management.</p>
               <p>LET not the parent trifle in this caſe. All he can do is to put off an operation, which is better done ſoon; for the ſame ſtate of the blood which inflames the eyes, at this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, will take a like effect upon the lungs in the decline.</p>
               <p>THE fever which preceeded and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied the eruptions ſhould go off when they die away, but ſometimes it continues after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; and becomes of the hectic kind; and then without extreme care the child will be loſt. This generally happens when the infant has been unhealthy before, or when the bowels have continued coſtive during the courſe of the diſeaſe, and bleeding has been omitted. A dry cough and a difficulty of breathing uſually attend this fever. Bleeding is again the firſt requiſite; and after this pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toral and balſamick medicines; and the country air. The ſperma ceti emulſion, and the pectoral infuſion muſt be continued. The purges ſhould be repeated as the ſtrength will allow; and then aſſes milk will compleat the cure.</p>

               <p>PHYSICIANS are free with Opiates in the Meaſles: and it may appear ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular that in the method of treating the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0274601000:54"/>nam'd: but in what I have ſeen of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe they have not been wanted; and there is reaſon to think they may be hurtful. I have uſualy found this method, prevent thoſe ſymptoms which opiates are given by others to mitigate; and there are ſome bad ones which thoſe medicines may bring on. <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denham</hi> ſuppoſed opiates neceſſary; but 'tis to later phyſicians we owe the true manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this diſeaſe. Among theſe Doctor <hi>Mead,</hi> the ornament, not of his profeſſion alone, but of his country, deſerves the firſt praiſe. If opiates ever can be needful, it muſt be in the latter end of the diſeaſe; but even then 'tis beſt to do without them, if poſſible. If the cough be violent, and no other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod will allay it, a very ſmall doſe of an opiate will have a conſiderable effect: and when a purging can be aſſwaged by no other means, a few drops of liquid laudanum will probably aſſiſt the other medicines. In theſe extream neceſſities, I think opiates will do good; but I am perſwaded thoſe who ſhall take timely care, very rarely have occaſion to uſe them.</p>

               <p>THE eyes and eyelids are always af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the Meaſles and in the worſt kinds the ſoreneſs continues after the diſeaſe is over, uſually the laſt bleeding brings them
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0274601000:55"/>to themſelves: or if this fails, they become perfectly well after the firſt doſe of phyſick.</p>
               <p>WHEN they continue ſore after this, the cauſe is a natural weakneſs: a cold might have brought on the ſame diſorder, therefore it is to be conſidered independ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The eyes muſt be defended from the light; and of a long time the child ſhould not be permitted to walk in the ſun, or fit facing the windows; and the cure muſt be compleated by waſhing the eyes frequently with the following mixture.</p>
               <p>PICK off an ounce of the leaves of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Vervain, pour upon them a quart of boiling water; and let this ſtand all night: then ſtrain off the liquor, and add two ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls of Brandy, warm a little of this and mix with it one third part of ſkim'd milk. Waſh the eyes with it morning and evening. The virtues of this plant deſerve to be more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded: great good is done with it by thoſe who keep it a ſecret; but much more wou'd follow, if it were known univerſally.</p>
               <p>I HAVE added this caſe of inflam'd eyes, tho' not a regular conſequence of the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſles, yet as a complaint which ſometimes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that diſeaſe; being deſirous the parent ſhou'd find here all needful direction, and the child all ſafety.</p>
