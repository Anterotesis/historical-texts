            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>SINCE the firſt publication of the late Earl of CHESTERFIELD'S Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to the preſent time, the arrows of Cenſure have been levelled at the doctrine they inculcate, from every quarter: the wit hath had his joke, the verſifier his parody, the moraliſt his oppoſing ſentiment, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0377100201:4"/>
his grave diſſertation. Very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious men have taken the pen in hand to confront his Lordſhip: his Graces have been ſmartly ridiculed; his etiquette humorouſly expoſed; and Mr. HUNTER, with an elegance and profundity far beyond the reſt of his remarkers, hath penetrated into the very bottom of his maxims, traverſed him through every double, and examined his whole ſyſtem with an analytical acuteneſs.</p>
            <p>It is matter of real amazement that amongſt all thoſe who have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed themſelves loudly and dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrically againſt the doctrine of
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0377100201:5"/>
Lord CHESTERFIELD'S correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, none ſhould have yet thought of the only method that was moſt likely to manifeſt their tendency. The general ſtigma upon theſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters has been, that they are calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to recommend deceit, and to conceal the moſt deſtructive hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy, under the ſmiling aſpect, plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible exterior, fair-ſeeming ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and a complacent flexibility.</p>
            <p>In an age of voluptuouſneſs, it is moſt obvious to apprehenſion, that maxims, like theſe, would have moſt weight with the young and diſſipated. The man of faſhion
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0377100201:6"/>
would find them ſo conſiſtent with his plan of ſecurity, that there would be little doubt but he would adopt them; and the man of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient and broken fortunes would as eagerly catch at a mode of conduct which, without either danger of his neck, or character, might repair his purſe, promote his pleaſures, and ſave him from a thouſand ſhocks that poverty is heir to.</p>
            <p>The eſſence of my Lord CHES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERFIELD'S ſyſtem ſeems to be neither more nor leſs than this: Secure yourſelf from being blaſted, as he terms it, and do whatever
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0377100201:7"/>
you think proper: whatever fancy, paſſion, whim, or wickedneſs, ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, only command your counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, check your temper, and throw before your heart and boſom the ſhield of Diſſimulation, and ſnatch it—ſeize it—enjoy it.</p>
            <p>In regard to women—never ſurely iſſued from the preſs a collection of hints ſo capable of being turned to their deſtruction: and the ſex ought to be more alarmed at this publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (which, however, one of their own ſex has uſhered into the world) than at any thing that ever was pointed at their peace of mind, or purity of character.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="x" facs="tcp:0377100201:8"/>How, then, hath it happened, that no perſon hath yet put the volumes of the Earl of CHESTER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FIELD into the hand of a hero, who, with a natural aptitude to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy every thing within his obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, might increaſe his felicity very conſiderably, by the aſſiſtance of ſentiments ſo admirably ſuited to multiply miſchief, and to enſure his victory over that ſimplicity, that beauty, and that ſoftneſs, which, would, thence, be, ſo much the more eaſily, <hi>thrown off their guard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As nothing of this kind, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, has appeared, I have ventured
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0377100201:9"/>
to preſent to the public, the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of a man of birth, rank, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, and character, ardent in the purſuit of pleaſures, and much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted <hi>with,</hi> and attracted <hi>by,</hi> the theory of Lord CHESTERFIELD. He purchaſes the books, finds them agreeable to his palate, ſtudies them paragraph by paragraph, thrives under his application, piques him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon his progreſs; and in the end, a maſter of his ſcience, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes the genius of his noble pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptor, puts money in his purſe, the ineſtimable volumes in his port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manteau, and ſallies into the gay world, armed at all points, the PUPIL OF PLEASURE.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xii" facs="tcp:0377100201:10"/>Every ingenious precept laid down by the noble Lord, this high-bred young gentleman reduces to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, who, taking the ſummer before him, makes his attacks at a place of faſhionable reſort; where (fixing with commendable and pre-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed acuteneſs upon proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects) he begins to exemplify, and is as ſucceſsful as the politeſt caſuiſt could poſſibly wiſh.</p>
            <p>In the courſe of this hiſtorical il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtration—this biographical com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary on the text of CHESTER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FIELD—ample ſcope has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for the diſplay of various characters, and particularly ſuch as
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:0377100201:11"/>
more immediately promoted the main deſign of the work, which is, to ſhew the aggravated evils in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety ariſing from the practice of ſuch <hi>perniciouſly-pleaſing precepts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this end, I have made great uſe of the noble Lord's maxims, rules, and admonitions, upon va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſubjects. The incidents, it is conceived, ariſe, naturally, out of the principles that produce them; the contraſt in the characters, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of HOMESPUN, SEDLEY, THORNTON, Lieutenant VERNON, and Sir HENRY DELMORE, I have endeavoured to render eminent and
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:0377100201:12"/>
conſpicuous; and altho', ſome may think, the cataſtrophe and a few of the circumſtances, carried too far into the pathetic, yet, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, thoſe who weigh deeply the <hi>precepts</hi> of Lord CHESTERFIELD, will agree with me in thinking, that, if puſhed into <hi>practice</hi> by an adventurer, like that which his Lordſhip <hi>would</hi> have formed out of Mr. STANHOPE, ſimilar or even greater ſorrows, and vices, would invade the community. In ſhort, this hiſtory is calculated ſtrongly to prove the truth of Lord CHESTER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FIELD'S <hi>own</hi> obſervation, namely, "That the adoption of Vice is
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:0377100201:13"/>
likely to ruin ten times more young men, than natural inclination."</p>
            <p>I am apt to think Mr. STAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HOPE'S reputed want of <hi>ability</hi> made him die an honeſt, though an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinguiſhed man: perhaps, if he had had <hi>Ton</hi> enough to follow the advice of his father, and entered into all the <hi>elevated connexions</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to him, he had fallen, like the hero of this hiſtory, equally celebrated, dazzling, and diabolical.</p>

               <p>THE whirl of wheels, a fine flow of ſpirits, the elyſium of expectation, and the vigour of freſh horſes at every ſtage, brought me, in leſs than twenty hours, from Cavendiſh-ſquare to the place of date. Having no unneceſſary luggage
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0377100201:15"/>
to retard me, no trifling petit maitre, who, at two miles diſtance from the ſhifting-place, drives back for his gloves, his cane, his ſnuff-box, or his white handkerchief; I rolled, THORNTON, on the ſprings of expedition; and I ſit down, unſubdued by fatigue, to tell thee of my ſafety.</p>
               <p>Richardſon's a child, his Grandiſon is a monſter, his Lovelace a bungler:— ſince the days of Adam, Nature hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced but <hi>one man of pleaſure;</hi> and that wonder was reſerved to adorn the age be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us.</p>
               <p>Oh, CHESTERFIELD! CHESTERFIELD! <hi>thou,</hi> only thou, kneweſt the <hi>ſcience</hi> of joy; thou only hadſt the ſkill to cover the rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedneſſes of life with roſes, that bloom from being preſſed.

               <p>THORNTON, I am inſpired! the rhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſody of my invocation is throbbing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready at my heart—it is working its way to the very marrow in the bones.

               </head>
               <p>DULL THORNTON!—circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect citizen! at what art thou alarmed, and "why is thy ſpirit troubled within thee?" How canſt thou entertain ſo contemptible a notion of thy SEDLEY? <hi>Imitation!</hi> Curſe thee for the thought Haſt thou, in the courſe of ſeven enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing years, ever known me ſtoop from the originality of <hi>ſelf</hi> to the ſlavery of another? 'Tis true, I admire the Lord of CHESTERFIELD: his epiſtles are, in the reading hour, always in my hand; at night they repoſe behind my pillow, and they at preſent conſtitute all my tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling library. But I ſcorn to be fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0377100201:20"/>
either in body or ſoul. The li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the <hi>underſtanding</hi> is as dear to me as the liberty of the <hi>perſon;</hi> and I have too much pride, too much dignity, to become a plagiary. No, THORNTON, the Earl is, as it were, my tutor; his ſentiments are ſuch as I have long felt, but ſuch as, till now, I was cautious of <hi>avowing.</hi> Hitherto I have been reſtrained in my actions, and loſt half the joy of voluptuouſneſs, becauſe, forſooth, nobody had either reputation or ingenuity enough to keep me in countenance. I ſwam the ſtream of pleaſure, but was always afraid of going out of my depth. For the herd of men are contented to be libertines in the ordinary ſhallow way, and, before the appearance of theſe <hi>enchanting Letters,</hi> we wanted the imprimatur of a man of celebrity, to give credit to the efforts of an enterprizing ſpirit. But <hi>now</hi> the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment is removed,—the avenue is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0377100201:21"/>
opened, and the proſpect of pleaſure is palpable. The repoſitory of STANHOPE, the cabinet of CHESTERFIELD, the Earl's arcanum, are all diſcloſed:—EUGENIA— bear, bear the name, ye roſy-winged deities of joy, in gratitude to heaven!—EUGENIA has given to mankind the invaluable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of her father, and in that preſent —(Oh, THORNTON, echo EUGENIA!)— hath diſcovered, to every elegant character, freſh roads to the temple of felicity, and virgin, untaſted reſources of perſonal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacy.</p>
               <p>My deſign then, is to indulge my prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, by improving upon thoſe maxims which his elegant pen hath made <hi>faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</hi> Let others content themſelves with the <hi>vulgar</hi> happineſs of yielding beauty, entrapt ſimplicity, and the mere deflora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of female youth,—<hi>I</hi> cannot be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribed by ſuch common, <hi>animal</hi> ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0377100201:22"/>
—give me delicacy, give me diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, give me refinement,—give me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation,—or take from me exiſtence.</p>
               <p>"To beat the beaten track,—to taſte the taſted,"—Oh, ſhocking!—inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable! I am above it. I ſcorn it.</p>
               <p>In a word then, THORNTON, what our GARRICK is to SHAKESPEARE, I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to be to CHESTERFIELD,—the living comment upon the dead text. The youth to whom the Earl's Letters were originally addreſſed, thou knoweſt, is dead; and it ſhould ſeem that he wanted <hi>ſoul</hi> to reliſh them, had he continued amongſt us. Peace to his uncongenial manes! I claim the inheritance, THORNTON, and deſire you will conſider <hi>me</hi> as his ſon, by the adoption of his <hi>ſentiment.</hi> Nay, had theſe veins been filled with the rich ſtream
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0377100201:23"/>
that fed the heart of STANHOPE, I could not have been more like himſelf.—God forgive me! but, were it not ſaid that my mother was the Diana of her day, I ſhould ſuſpect ſhe played my father the Alderman falſe, and that ſhe threw her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the conquering and accompliſhed arms of CHESTERFIELD.—Earth and ſkies! Mr. THORNTON, canſt thou think I was the product of a plethoric Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and that Alderman a dealer in hops? —Baſtardize me, dear friend, in pity to my feelings; and rather than ſuppoſe me the offspring of <hi>ſuch</hi> a conjunction, make me the by-blow of ſome deity in diſguiſe, and let me catch a ray of comfort from illegitimacy.</p>
               <p>So much for the introduction to our correſpondence. Of preface no more— Prepare for immediate action—A face

               <p>THE Earl's abſent man has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready exhibited himſelf. He is of the name of HOMESPUN, and is the butt of the bath. His ſoul is contemplative, and his body pedantic. Never ſaw I ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular, or thoughtful a figure: a very walking ſoliloquy; and his wife, or, at leaſt, the beautiful She who hangs upon his arm—O THORNTON! THORNTON! —I have an object before me already, young, elegant, graceful, and (I warmly hope) a <hi>wife</hi>—If ſhe ſhould prove indeed the property of this pedant—if the ſtars ſhould have thrown a <hi>hoop of gold</hi> in my way, my fortune is made.—Soft a little
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0377100201:26"/>
—my landlord enters—his eye looks com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication—there is intelligence in every feature. I am poſitive he will prove the <hi>Daily Advertiſer</hi> of the bath.</p>
               <p>Pray, Mr.—I forget your name— Mr.— Wyngood is my name, Sir.— Pray, Mr. Wyngood, what fine young lady is that now walking with the ſtraight, well-made gentleman in raven-grey?</p>
               <p>She is wife to the gentleman, Sir; and his name is Mr. HORACE HOMES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PUN, a miniſter come to bathe for the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> diſorder. There's a <hi>vaſt</hi> deal of company, Sir, in town, and I think you are very lucky in taking my lodgings. I have got the beſt lodgings in all BUX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON, and ſome of the beſt people in them at this moment. Why now, Sir, you would not think it, but I can ſhew you ſuch things as will ſurprize you.—Here
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0377100201:27"/>
he ſet off, and I followed him into a bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, where, without any ceremony, opening the drawers of his lodgers, he took out a riding-hat, with a blue feather and a ſpangled button. "Lookee, Sir, did you ever ſee the like? Then here is ſilks upon ſattins, and ſattins upon ſilks; and they're the <hi>kindeſt</hi> people in the world. They live as cheap as poſſible. Why I don't ſuppoſe, one day with another, they ſpend a guinea; they pay only eight-pence a-piece for breakfaſt, a ſhilling a-piece for dinner, eight-pence for tea in the afternoon, a ſhilling each for ſupper, and fourteen ſhillings for lodging; beſides waſhing, coals, candles, and wines,—a <hi>mere nothing,</hi> as I may ſay, for a watering-place. I preſume, Sir, you would chuſe to join them, and live in the ſame manner. I ſee you are a very worthy gentleman, and I will go mention you under the name of — pray, what name muſt I ſay, Sir?
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0377100201:28"/>
— But no matter; I will tell Mr. HOMESPUN that a new lodger wiſhes to do as he does. Sir, your ſervant; I will be with you again preſently.</p>
               <p>The fellow had it all his own way, THORNTON. I interrupted him not, and am this very night to ſup with maſter miniſter HOMESPUN. I have walked down to the well, and drank a glaſs at this Helicon of health. I was in this ramble the man of faſhion, juſt ſtept out of the chaiſe, and elegantly diſordered in my dreſs—my hair was tied with negligence, my curls looſe and in the <hi>ton</hi> of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and my frock diſcovered a genteel ſhape and the cut of a good taylor. A miſcellaneous group were paſſing away the intermediate hours betwixt tea-time and ſupper: the lame and the lazy, the merry and the mortified, were all upon the ſaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: HOMESPUN was fondly ruminating
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0377100201:29"/>
with his angelic conſort in the ſhade; and <hi>ſomething</hi> that had the appearance of a fop—I mean of the common kind—was ſaying ſmart things to a pretty well-woman.</p>
               <p>Nothing, however, could induce me to ſtay a moment at this dull place, but the <hi>practice</hi> of <hi>precepts</hi> which will convert all places into a paradiſe, and make even a <hi>watering-place</hi> delicious.—I am ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned by the ſupper-bell.—Mrs. HOME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SPUN—Oh, what a name for ſuch a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture!—is tripping it towards the ſound, and HOMESPUN himſelf ſeems to forget his primitive uprightneſs of back, and ſteps briſkly forward.</p>

               <opener>
                  <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>YOU remember, I preſume, the jaunt I took in the laſt year to SOUTH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>AMPTON, the particulars of which, at the requeſt of ſome friends, I ſuffered to be printed in the WESTMINSTER MAGAZINE, in two ſeveral letters addreſſed to the publiſher, Mr. THOMAS WRIGHT, of Eſſex-ſtreet, in the Strand, London. I there told you, that I was not quite ſo highly intereſted in, or entertained by, the ſcenes in a hurry before me, as my <hi>then</hi> patron, the Baronet, would flatter my
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0377100201:35"/>
imagination with upon the road; and (as I find thoſe letters from the Weſtminſter Magazine were reprinted into various <hi>other</hi> monthly publications) I have reaſon to ſuppoſe my excurſion afforded ſome amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a certain ſet of readers.</p>
               <p>But, having ſince then been yoked to a damſel who hath a paſſion for theſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering-places, and who (bringing along with her a decent fortune) has a right to indulge herſelf in ſuch amuſements as ſeem beſt unto her, I have a <hi>ſecond</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to ſurvey the cuſtoms and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of water-drinkers and duckers; and can now give you many curious particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars by way of ſupplement to the accounts I have already publiſhed.</p>
               <p>As my preſent cure is ſituated about thirty-ſeven poſt miles and a quarter from the waters of BUXTON, amidſt the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0377100201:36"/>
of the Peake, Mrs. HOMESPUN choſe to paſs a week at that place, for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of a pain in the ancle, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came grievous about ſix minutes before ſhe ſuggeſted to me the neceſſity of ſuch an excurſion.</p>
               <p>That the cure of her ancle might be perfectly completed, I contrived it ſo, as to perſuade the curate of a neighbouring pariſh to do duty at home in my abſence, and reſolved to ſtay a fortnight. Of this fortnight only four days are yet expired; and though I never underwent the ſame degree of parade, of fatigue, and of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence, in any former fourteen years of my life,—not even when I preached thrice in the Sunday, and footed it to two of the cures,—yet HARRIET ſeems ſo happy in <hi>doing as others do,</hi> and finds ſuch real felicity in the dulleſt ſpot I ever beheld, that I am in doubt whether even
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0377100201:37"/>
the long reſidue of the fortnight will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy her, ſo as to return home, to peace, privacy, and the parſonage-houſe, without murmurings and repinings.</p>
               <p>Oh! Doctor, ſee the outlines of my ſituation, and pity me. I am amongſt a number of both ſexes whoſe pleaſures are my averſions, and whoſe amuſements I cannot reliſh. I love quietneſs and the ſhade of life, and yet the houſe where I now lodge is as public as an inn at a fair. I admire rural ornaments, and ſcenes of ſummer verdure beyond imagination; and yet the mountains of Arabia Deſerta ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit not a proſpect ſo barren as that by which BUXTON is bounded. I love to ſtroll into the ſhop of an intelligent book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller, and to converſe with him upon the topic of recent publications;—alas! the bookſeller of BUXTON has nothing in his ſhop but the traſh that circulates at a
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0377100201:38"/>
watering-place amongſt the women. I ran my eye over his catalogue, and never did I ſee ſuch a collection: Clelia, Pamela, the Adventures of Cleopatra, Amuſements at the German Spa, and the Hiſtory of an Actreſs, were the beſt, in this bad bundle.</p>
               <p>I mentioned the Reviews—no body called for <hi>them.</hi> I talked of the Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines—none were ordered. I rummaged every row for <hi>philoſophy</hi>—nobody reads philoſophy at a watering-place. I criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed the ſhelves for <hi>morals,</hi> but found them not. I ventured to aſk, but with ſome little heſitation, for Secker's Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures—the bookſeller never heard of them. I took a turn round the ſhop, and (having forgot to bring any books with me) would have taken up with almoſt any-thing <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching</hi> to the rational, but, in my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, I had well-nigh overſet a glaſs-caſe
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0377100201:39"/>
of toothpicks, gold huſſives, embroidered pincuſhions, and emboſſed ſnuff-boxes.</p>
               <p>And now it appeared, that this harle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin trader was rather a haberdaſher, than a bookſeller.</p>
               <p>On caſting my eyes towards a perſon at the other end of the ſhop, I ſaw her bending wire, to form, what is facetiouſly called, a cap: over this perſon's head was a goodly ſhow of bandboxes; and acroſs the window at which ſhe ſat, were ribbons variouſly twiſted, and ſeveral ſpecimens of her ſkill in decorating that part of the body which is <hi>now</hi> more ridiculous than any other. Seeing ſuch preparations for the <hi>outſide</hi> of the head, I gave up the idea of finding any <hi>internal</hi> furniture; and, walking out of the ſhop, aſked pardon for having ſo groſsly miſtaken a milliner's and toyman's, for a vender of matters in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0377100201:40"/>
the literary way.—Juſt as I got to the door, a party of mighty pretty women, and my wife amongſt the reſt, (for <hi>ſhe</hi> already knew every body,) came ruſtling into the ſhop, and in a liſping tone, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned to the articulation of a watering-place, deſired the haberdaſhery-millinery bookſeller to look for JULIA MANDEVILLE —Julia Mandeville was not to be had. Then let us have SIDNEY BIDDULPH, ſaid the ladies — Sidney Biddulph was out. I'm for, THE MISTAKES OF THE HEART, cried a very grave-looking woman. I wiſh, my dear, (ſaid my wife to me, with a very well-bred civility, taking leſs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of me than uſual,) you had brought JOSEPH ANDREWS along with you— Oh la! Ma'am, replied another, how can you poſſibly read ſuch <hi>low</hi> ſtuff—the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures of a footman, a kitchin wench, and a ſtrolling parſon—Nay, Madam, ſaid HARRIET, don't ſay any-thing againſt
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0377100201:41"/>
the parſons, pray; remember I'm a cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman's wife, and there he ſtands—an ABRAHAM ADAMS every inch of him— a'n't you, my dear?</p>
               <p>This was too much; I attempted to go, but HARRIET caught me by the coat. The poor ladies were in great anxiety to find THE MISTAKES OF THE HEART had been carried off laſt ſeaſon, by a perſon who took the road to GRETNA GREEN with her footman, in her way to London; though ſome (ſaid the haber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſher archly) may think <hi>that</hi> was going a round-about way too. If we can't get THE MISTAKES, ſuppoſe, rejoined the ladies, we make ſhift, till we can have ſomething <hi>better,</hi> with TOM JONES—Aye, TOM JONES is tolerable enough, (ſaid a pale lady,) if he would but ſay more about SOPHIA, and give us leſs non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe about the old vulgar father, the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0377100201:42"/>
fuſty aunt, and thoſe unentertaining hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid creatures, THWACKUM and SQUARE. As to his Introductory Chapters, as he calls them, I always ſkip 'em; and yet, if he was a little plainer in telling us what we were to expect, at the top of his chapters, I really think it would be a <hi>goodiſh, prettyiſh</hi> ſort of a novel. — Tom Jones, it ſeems, was now in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Lady Sallow's coachman.—The haberdaſher recommended FILIAL PIETY —the ladies were ſatisfied that it was a dull, ſerious, ſermonizing thing, from the title. FILIAL PIETY indeed!—ſend it to Miſs Dorothy Deſolate, who is come to dip for the diſmals; or Lady Bab. Bluebutter, who wants to drink away her frog-freckled complexion.—Ha! ha! ha! he! he! he.—</p>
               <p>The laugh was now more violent than the wit was brilliant by which it was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0377100201:43"/>
and my dear HARRIET, joined in it moſt cordially.—They were about to depart without any books at all, when the haberdaſher mentioned ſome odd vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes of the Spectator. They aſked what he meant by talking about ſuch old things, which they had been <hi>obliged</hi> to read over and over again when they were at their boarding-ſchools. Lord! (cried one of the damſels,) here's DELICATE EMBAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RASSMENTS—Oh! the very thing—worth all the Spectators that ever were <hi>wrote.</hi> Aye, take it, and let us go read it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly—It don't <hi>end well</hi> I think, objected another; I had rather read EACH SEX IN THEIR HUMOUR.—Here is <hi>Something New,</hi> ladies, ſaid the haberdaſher—As old as the poles, ſaid the fair-ones.—What ſay you to ELOISA?—Oh! by all means— Have you got ELOISA?—reach it this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment—Oh, the dear book!—there are <hi>three</hi> letters in the firſt volume worth all
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0377100201:44"/>
the world.—Come, it's a naſty evening and not fit for walking, let us hurry away; and ſo ſend them, Mr TRASHLEY, to <hi>the Hall</hi> this inſtant. Come, Mr. HOMESPUN, (turning to me,) you ſhall <hi>'ſquire</hi> us.</p>
               <p>They fluttered out, caught me by the arm, and carried me off in high triumph, ten times faſter than I ſhould have walked, had I been permitted to do as I thought proper. But that is a matter by no means allowable, at a watering-place. Even now I am ſummoned by a meſſenger, who ſays <hi>the party</hi> are waiting for me, to go into the walks. I dare not ſtay to finiſh my letter, leſt I ſhould become <hi>ridiculous;</hi> ſo you muſt wait till I can next ſteal a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>from</hi> folly <hi>for</hi> friendſhip.</p>

               <p>The party, of which I was made one, conſiſted of maſter miniſter HOMESPUN, his lady, an animal who burleſqued the coxcomb, and a fourth who departed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the entrance of ſupper, ſo that of him I ſhall ſay nothing at preſent.— HOMESPUN and his wife are oppoſites,

The cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb was of the neutral kind, but wiſhed to be flattered, for his taſte in perſonal or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments. Never was there a more cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious trio. The converſation turned at firſt upon weather, then upon books, then upon dreſs, and laſt upon the virtue of the BUXTON waters; and I accommodated myſelf to the ſeveral changes with tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable facility.</p>
               <p>And, firſt, to touch the tender part of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0377100201:47"/>
our bookworm, I obſerved that the public ſuſtained a great loſs in the death of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ornaments of the age. I ſpoke cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically, as to the ſatiric powers of CHARLES CHURCHILL; and poetically, as to the Pindaric flights of GRAY. I entered into the intricacies of the epic, and drew the line betwixt the original HOMER and the imitator VIRGIL. I ſpoke of eaſe, in the ſtyle of TILLOTSON; and of the pathetic, in the periods of YORICK. I affected even to diſcountenance the innuendo of TRISTRAM SHANDY, and I compared his licentious ſpirit with the voluptuous OVID. I pretended to diſcover an oſtentatious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play of talents in the Orations and Epiſtles of CICERO; and I took care to ſuit every opinion to the taſte of the perſon I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed, who had his ſhare in the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation too, and who (as I have ſince heard) mentions me to his friends as a paragon of learning.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0377100201:48"/>I muſt not forget to tell thee, that, when I was talking upon books, and mentioned the ELEMENTS OF CRITICISM, Mrs. HOMESPUN (though no ſimpleton) aſked me, with great ſimplicity, if that was a <hi>novel;</hi> to which the fop anſwered <hi>Yes,</hi> it came out laſt year, and was written by an intimate friend of his, but that, though <hi>he</hi> puſhed it with all his intereſt, it did not <hi>take,</hi> and was now totally buried in oblivion.</p>
               <p>I contradicted this with all poſſible po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs—<hi>I imagined he might be miſtaken:</hi> that work, <hi>I believed,</hi> was attributed to LORD KAMES—a writer, with whom I did <hi>not doubt</hi> but he was acquainted. Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly he might confound the title a little, with others ſimilar to it; which might very eaſily be done. I had caught <hi>myſelf</hi> in ſuch errors a thouſand times. Mr. HOMESPUN chuckled at my candour.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0377100201:49"/>
Mrs. HOMESPUN (I know by her eyes) ſaid ſomething to her huſband, in a low voice, in my favour; and the fop him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, with a ſmile of complacence, but without any confuſion at detected ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, (—ſuch, THORNTON, is the force of <hi>manner!</hi>—) ſaid, it was very likely he might be miſled by the title; that there were three or four <hi>elements,</hi> and he was moſt ſuperlatively obliged to me for ſetting him right.</p>
               <p>Upon the topic of dreſs, I took care to agree with Mrs. HOMESPUN in every particular; except that, now and then, I affected, in a gentle tone of voice, and ſubmiſſive ſmile of countenance, to differ from her, on purpoſe to throw the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph on <hi>her</hi> ſide, make her happy in an ideal ſuperiority, the better to impreſs her with a proper notion of my good manners, in yielding to conviction.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0377100201:50"/>The fop hopped out about twelve o'clock, and took me by the hand in token of ſatisfaction. Honeſt HORACE (that is his Chriſtian name) conſiders me as his comforter, and declares that he hopes for ſome happineſs now, even in a watering-place; and Mrs. HOMESPUN, or, as I ſhall call her hereafter, (to uſe as little as poſſible that vulgar name,) HARRIET, makes no ſcruple of ſaying, I am the moſt chatty, agreeable man at the bath.</p>
               <p>I caught her, THORNTON, twice mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring me from top to bottom, and then ſhe gave HORACE a ſurvey.—By the ſoft, half-ſuppreſſed ſigh ſhe gave at the end of it, it is eaſy to ſee—whoſe dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſhe likes beſt.</p>
               <p>Oh! THORNTON, if I can once bring her to be diſcontented with her ſituation,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0377100201:51"/>
—if ſhe once begins to repent of her bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, the day is my own! I never ſaw a pair of eyes more likely to fall in love than hers. The eyes of HORACE are grey, and without luſtre. She hath the right lips of invitation: the vulgar HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RACE ſmackt them at ſomething ſhe ſaid, but methinks the impreſſion was only <hi>ſkin-deep.</hi> She is in full health, and in the hey-day of female youth!</p>
               <p>Oh, THORNTON! THORNTON! pray earneſtly, that ſhe may be miſerable, and that the deſpair of her heart may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, only by thy friend</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0377100201:54"/>About one o'clock in the morning, the eyes of HORACE began to twinkle,—what was before dull became duller, till at laſt the four eye-laſhes met together, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the balls of ſight. HARRIET con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued loquacious and lively, and reſolved not to go to bed till it was a more <hi>modiſh</hi> hour, inſiſting, that I ſhould keep her company. I humoured her vivacity till HORACE began to ſnore, and then ſhifted the converſation to ſomething leſs ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sentiment,</hi> THORNTON, when enforced at a proper criſis, is a better weapon for a man of pleaſure, than downright <hi>licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs.</hi> I began to ſing forth the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of Mr. HOMESPUN; ſaid many things in praiſe of his learning, honeſty, and hoſpitable turn of thinking—told a tale of diſappointed paſſion—deſcanted on the difficulties often attending reciprocal
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0377100201:55"/>
attractions—placed two young people in ſeveral affecting ſituations. I altered the tone of my voice, and ſuited it to the ſtillneſs of the night—ſighed in whiſper— corrected myſelf—called a tear into my eye—aſſumed a ſoftened flexibility of fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture—and, now and then, took my eye from viewing her, as if ſenſibly ſtruck with my danger.</p>
               <p>Part of the flowers with which ſhe had been ſome time playing, fell on the floor —I took them up with a trembling hand, and put them into hers, with a preſſure ſcarcely perceptible. There was a ſudden bluſh over her face in a moment. I took no notice of it; but, catching up a myrtle-ſprig, kept it ſportingly as if to conceal a new ſigh—preſented it to her as the feſheſt on the table, and roſe to take my leave.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:0377100201:56"/>It was the exact moment of departure. She was viſibly agitated, and I would not ſee it. She took the ſprig, and I ſaw the leaves ſhake. I went ſoftly to the door, left with her the compliments of the night, in a gentleneſs of the tones perfectly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic—lingered at the door a moment— complained that I could not open it haſtily for fear of diſturbing her huſband—at laſt, I <hi>almoſt</hi> ſhut it—half opened it again —ſtood the third of a minute, in a finely-diſſembled ſtate of embarraſſment—once more bade her farewel, and indeed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted,</p>

               <p>THE journey has already had a good effect, my dear LUCY, upon poor FANNY. We travelled by eaſy ſtages, and I hope <hi>much</hi> from the alteration of air, even if the waters ſhould want virtue to reſtore her. The poor thing has been to all the baths in the kingdom, you know, except thoſe of BUXTON. Alas! I fear her diſorder has got too near her heart for medicine; and the God that afflicts, can only, I believe, remove the affliction. Never was known ſo gradual a decline, and yet no application could ſtop its progreſs.—What a pity, LUCY,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0377100201:62"/>
that ſuch a form ſhould be daily decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, before the eyes of the moſt tender relations! Company, converſation, the ſimplicity of her diet, the wholeſomeneſs of the ſituation, are all that can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from a ſhort reſidence here, as the waters of BUXTON are not ſtrongly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in conſumptive complaints. She is always beſt in ſociety, and I am happy to tell you, the place is tolerably full. Her poor fond huſband hangs over her fading form, with more tenderneſs than when it was in its bloom.

               <p>SOFTNESS to the ſick is better than a cordial! FANNY ventured yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day to breakfaſt in public: her delicate form, beautiful in diſtreſs, inſtantly attracted, and <hi>claimed,</hi> what it <hi>received,</hi>—the attention of the whole company. She was dreſſed with her uſual ſimplicity, and ſuited her ornaments to her ſituation. In my life, I never ſaw any body, in the luxuriancy of health, half ſo intereſting. After the firſt diſh of tea, the fluſh, which was formerly a conſtant reſident, reviſited her cheek—the diſorder has not, in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, tinged her complexion—her forehead is, as it ever was, alabaſter white; and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0377100201:64"/>
the veins, that meander round the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, are ſo tranſparently blue, and the circulation ſeems to be performed ſo pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifically, one might almoſt envy the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy, which a cruel diſorder hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon her. In the eyes of ſeveral young ladies, who, by their florid ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, came hither merely for amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I ſaw the gliſtening drop of ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy—and the men, who were laughing at our entrance, ſoon ſoftened their voices, and ſpoke almoſt in a whiſper, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment to the lovely invalid, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to <hi>want</hi> ſuch attention.</p>
               <p>FANNY was ſenſible to their indulgence, and ſmiled acknowledgment. At laſt, in came a ſtranger, elegant and eaſy beyond deſcription.—<hi>How,</hi> my LUCY, ſhall I proceed?—FANNY ſunk upon my arm, complained that ſhe was worſe on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and roſe to go out—the ſtranger aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted,

               <p>I REALLY begin to think, I ſhall find ſome ſatisfaction at BUXTON bath. Amidſt a cluſter of inſignificant characters, one gentleman has diſtinguiſhed himſelf ſo much above the reſt, that I have at once gratified my pride and curioſity in his acquaintance.</p>
               <p>He is intimately acquainted with polite and elegant learning, perfectly well man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nered, and not above converſing upon
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0377100201:68"/>
ſubjects of divinity, and ethics, even at a <hi>watering-place.</hi> My wife ſays, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands to a nicety, what ſome of the waterers call the ETIQUETTE of dreſs; and with the arts of a ſcholar, he has, it ſeems, the invention and taſte of a cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, without any-thing of courtly inſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity.</p>
               <p>In truth, I am apt to think very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably of him, eſpecially as his exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior does not ſeem more frank and open, than his interior is ingenuous and undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed. <hi>One</hi> ſuch character will atone for the ſtupidity of the <hi>reſt.</hi> As I am fond of, now and then, what I call a wood-walk, or a ramble by myſelf, I can now take <hi>this</hi> without a breach of good manners, for I can leave this accompliſhed gentleman with HARRIET, who is fond enough of his company to accept of him in <hi>my</hi> abſence.</p>

               <p>'Tis hardly worth attending to, and perhaps you'll laugh at my taking <hi>notice</hi> of ſuch a trifle, but he ſits in a chair, eats his victuals, cuts it into ſlices, and holds his knife and fork as different from HORACE as poſſible, who, you know, ſometimes ſeems ſo over head and ears in thought, that he forgets the dinner is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, picks his teeth, and ſits ſilent, till the cloth is ready to be taken away. Then again, as to carving, HORACE can no more do the honours, of the table than a baby: he <hi>miſſes the joint,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſcatters the ſauce in ones face;— whereas <hi>this</hi> gentleman, hits the mark as dexterouſly as a ſurgeon, helps the ladies to the greateſt delicacies, with ſuch a gentle manner, and with a countenance
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0377100201:72"/>
ſo ſmiling, that it is impoſſible to refuſe what he offers.</p>
               <p>At ſupper laſt night, HORACE was in one of his thoughtful moods, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted me horridly.</p>
               <p>There was a roaſted fowl; and HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RACE, perceiving my plate empty, muſt needs fill it with one of the wings, which he made ſhift to mangle off with the knife with which he had been eating, though another for the purpoſe was lying on the other ſide the diſh. Then he muſt needs make my wing ſwim with the gravy, and, in awkwardly tilting the diſh, ſeveral drops flew upon the gentleman's waiſtcoat. Mr. SEDLEY—that is his name —ſaid, it was no matter; it was not eaſy to help ſuch accidents; and begged he would conſider it as of no ſort of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.—Sweet fellow!—Oh, that HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RACE
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0377100201:73"/>
would imitate him! He is now walking towards our lodgings, and HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RACE ſlouching by the ſide of him. HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RACE is upright enough, but then he looks as ſtiff and uncomfortable as an overſtarched ſhirt.—SEDLEY moves as if he was quite happy: Mr. HOMESPUN ſtruts as if he was in miſery. They are both at the door.</p>

               <p>THE proverb is verified: It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not rain, but it pours! The Cherubim I mentioned to thee in my laſt, is a che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rub of an inferior order, when compared with the SERAPH who came with her. She was at <hi>that</hi> time muffled up and cloſe hooded; but when, on the next day, the veil was withdrawn, judge of my ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, when I beheld the very <hi>She,</hi> the charming <hi>She,</hi> whom laſt ſeaſon I met with her father, Sir HENRY DELMORE, at SCARBOROUGH, at the very period, that the letters, of my <hi>divine Earl</hi> became popular, and I had brought a copy of them. We lodged in the ſame houſe,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0377100201:75"/>
and I became agreeable to Sir HENRY. The very firſt trial I made to reduce my favourite precepts to practice, was upon the heart of this very girl, then glowing with all the graces of health, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with all the enchantments of a <hi>pathetic</hi> temper. I ſoon pretended to loſe <hi>my</hi> vivacity, and became the ſofteſt ſon of ſentiment that ever was born. The net of ſilk, which I had diligently woven, became ſucceſsful; and I had certainly caught in it the faireſt prize in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, had not a cruel neceſſity called me from the bath.</p>
               <p>Several tranſient tete-a-tetes I Had with her there, gave me the opportunities I wiſhed. Her paſſion was imaginary, but pleaſing—ſhe fixed high the ſtandard of domeſtic felicity, and unreaſonably loved to refine.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:0377100201:76"/>To accommodate myſelf to <hi>this,</hi> was, at firſt, not eaſy; but before I quitted SCARBOROUGH, I was ſo diſtinguiſhed for the <hi>penſenoſo,</hi> that even Sir HENRY him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, began to think I was falling into a hypochondriac diſorder, and uſed every effort to divert me.</p>
               <p>Though I was then but a novice in the theory of joy, I had read enough of CHESTERFIELD to know the potency of <hi>diſſimulation;</hi> and, had it been in my power to have ſtaid <hi>another week,</hi> ſhould have, even <hi>then,</hi> added an illuſtrious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, to corroborate that glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, which adviſes "to adapt the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and converſation to the company."</p>
               <p>Since theſe tranſactions, ſhe is altered, THORNTON,—altered in every part of her ſituation: the is married, and in a conſumption; and yet, like certain fruits, ſhe
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0377100201:77"/>
is delicious in decay. I was pleaſed to ſee her diſordered at the firſt interview: the little blood that painted her cheek, diſappeared, her knees ſhook, and her hands trembled at the recollection. And this, too, was in a public breakfaſting-room. Judge how her agitation muſt alarm the company, and operate amongſt the women in my favour. Who knows, THONRTON, but the beautiful invalid may have brought herſelf to this ſtate, upon <hi>my</hi> account? If ſo, ought not <hi>I</hi> to pity her?—and ought not <hi>ſhe</hi> to thank the gods, that I again "am come to comfort her?" At all events, you ought to congratulate me, and once again ſing <hi>Io Paean,</hi> to the canonized bones of CHES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERFIELD.</p>

               <p>THE HOMESPUNS are ſecured; I have them by the <hi>heart,</hi> and enjoy, in an equal degree, the <hi>confidence</hi> of the wife and huſband.</p>
               <p>HORACE has many <hi>oddities,</hi> of which hid wife is lately become ſenſible; and it has been <hi>my</hi> buſineſs, to excuſe them to her. He is addicted to catch hold of the button, and, in the ardour of philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical and ſyſtematic converſation, tugs at it moſt immoderately. Laſt night, in ſupporting a favourite opinion, which was oppoſed ſtoutly by the fopling, he ſeized
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0377100201:79"/>
the wrought button, and tore his fingers againſt the raiſed-work on the ſurface, till the blood fairly guſhed out in a ſtream, and ſpotted his ſables. The fop ſwore,—I checked him with <hi>temper:</hi> the parſon cooled in his <hi>argument,</hi>—and I applied an handkerchief to the wound, and thus ſaved them both from <hi>looking ſilly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HORACE'S nails are not quite ſo <hi>accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately clean</hi> as they might be; and, as I obſerved Mrs. HOMESPUN comparing them with <hi>mine,</hi> I ſuddenly cloſed my hand, as <hi>if</hi> out of tenderneſs, leſt the compariſon ſhould turn to HORACE'S diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage; yet this <hi>very</hi> tenderneſs, <hi>ſo managed,</hi> anſwered the deſign compleatly, and I can ſee plainly, HARRIET thinks hardly of HORACE for neglecting to pick the dirt from under his nails: while, on

               <p>THE very worſt reaſoner in the dominions of GEORGE, is JAMES THORN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON, Eſq.</p>
               <p>And ſo, becauſe I have an eye upon <hi>three,</hi> thou ſuppoſeſt I muſt needs be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent, and irregular! Doſt thou not know, that the ſame Oracle adviſes, a quickneſs of attention, an unobſerved ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, the art of ſeeing all the people in the room without appearing to look <hi>critically?</hi> Is there not, according to that Oracle, pretty nearly the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of deception in every character;
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0377100201:85"/>
and are we not to turn all this hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy to <hi>our</hi> advantage, even while we <hi>ſeem</hi> to think every body <hi>honeſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The great nicety in my preſent ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, <hi>thou</hi> doſt not ſee; nor will <hi>I</hi> be at the pains to develope it to ſo awkward an arguer.</p>
               <p>What a concluſion haſt thou drawn, indeed, from my having <hi>three</hi> objects in view! not conſidering, that I am as cool and collected as if I had but <hi>one;</hi> and that I have a capacity, equal to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of thirty times three.</p>
               <p>Learn to know me better.</p>
               <p>I am too well diſciplined in my ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, to be precipitate, or to hazard the mortification of being diſappointed, by
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0377100201:86"/>
raſhly ſeizing that which I perceive can only be attained gradually, by the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful efforts of reſiſtleſs inſinuation.</p>
               <p>The Maſter of my Art ſays, very truly,—<q>Little minds are in a hurry, when the object proves too big for them: they run, they puzzle, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found, and perplex themſelves; they want to do every thing at once, and never do it at all. But a man of ſenſe takes the time for doing the thing he is about, well; and his haſte to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch a buſineſs, only appears by the continuity of his application to it: he purſues it with a cool ſteadineſs, and finiſhes it before he begins any other.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This laſt ſentence, THORNTON, thou mayſt think, claſhes with my preſent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack upon the three beauties of BUXTON.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:0377100201:87"/>Thou art <hi>again</hi> miſtaken.</p>
               <p>I am not in a hurry to be happy, as to the <hi>ultimatum</hi> of female favours. Like a man of reſolution, I can watch the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of a favourite purſuit, and ſee it proſper under my eye, without ſeizing the final recompence of my labour, till it is the proper <hi>criſis</hi> of fruition.</p>
               <p>To bring theſe arguments home to the points in queſtion, thou muſt underſtand, that, had only HARRIET HOMESPUN been at the bath, I ſhould have been contented till <hi>her finiſhing;</hi> but as the Fates have thrown two <hi>ſiſters</hi> in my way, of which one happens to be an old acquaintance, but whom accident permitted to ſlip through my fingers <hi>unconquered,</hi> or, at leaſt, without beſtowing upon her victor the <hi>rewards</hi> of conqueſt, I muſt ſuit my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the triple tie; that chance hath
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0377100201:88"/>
laid upon me, with as much adroitneſs as I am able. And <hi>this</hi> is the delicacy in my ſituation, to which, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this letter, I alluded.</p>
               <p>One great part of my ſyſtem is, to make people, who are to give <hi>me</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, happy in themſelves. I muſt, to this end, take care to avoid making any of theſe dear creatures <hi>rivals</hi> to each other:—to <hi>boaſt</hi> of amours, thou knoweſt, is utterly repugnant to the STAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HOPEAN principle. <hi>Preſs</hi> for the favour, <hi>read</hi> the <hi>eyes, fix</hi> the <hi>heart,</hi> and revel over the <hi>yielded</hi> perſon, <hi>ad eternitatem;</hi> but keep the joy to <hi>thyſelf;</hi> nor ever, with raſcal loquacity, betray the infirmity of her, whoſe indulgence has give thee the firſt of felicities.</p>
               <p>To one friend I have <hi>ventured</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe myſelf in the very confidence of my
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0377100201:89"/>
ſoul. If thou <hi>betrayeſt</hi> me, though but in the hour of ebriety—it does not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of an <hi>if,</hi>—thou art a guarded, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable character.</p>
               <p>No more, I prithee, as to plurality of objects.</p>
               <p>The CHESTERFIELD ſyſtem admits not the fearful and filthy intercourſe of <hi>venal</hi> women. <hi>He</hi> could not allow the horrid and vulgar hazards of c—s and p—s. "Avoid," ſaith he, (in his coeleſtial chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on Pleaſures,) <q>the fate of the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous</hi> fornicator: what a wretch is a rake with half a noſe, crippled by coarſe and infamous debauches!</q>
               </p>
               <p>Hence, THORNTON, it is evident, that a man is juſtified (provided he keeps the ſecret) to ſearch the circle of the earth for thoſe favours, and elevated connexions,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0377100201:90"/>
that bring along with them the honey without the ſting. It is beneath a <hi>gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,</hi> to beat round the bagnio's, or criticiſe the brothel. Leave <hi>ſuch</hi> to the appetites of apprentices, whoſe vulgar palates can digeſt any-thing. Be it the buſineſs of thoſe who are governed by the <hi>laws of good-breeding,</hi> to enliſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under the <hi>white banner of apparent modeſty,</hi> and invite embraces, unallayed by terrors and ſuſpicions.</p>
               <p>The conſtitution of a man of faſhion, demands, in theſe caſes, the utmoſt cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection: the <hi>wife,</hi> the <hi>virgin,</hi> and the FRIEND, only, promiſe this <hi>bliſsful ſecurity.</hi> To them, then, let us direct ourſelves in ſelf-defence, and thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the perſonal paradiſe, in which the roſes of beauty bloom without a <hi>thorn.</hi>

                  <salute>Dear Doctor,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>WE are all wrong again!</p>
               <p>The head of poor HARRIET is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly turned; and, inſtead of a cure being performed, ſhe is certainly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, by theſe ſame waters of BUXTON. This day we drank tea in private, and never heard I ſuch a train of converſation as ſhe fell into. Why, Doctor, ſhe is <hi>gone</hi>—her intellects I mean—paſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:0377100201:93"/>For the firſt time in her life, ſhe found fault with every-thing I did. She inſiſted upon it, I drank my tea <hi>too hot,</hi> which was not only, ſhe ſaid, injurious to the coat of the ſtomach, but ſhockingly <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delicate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The tea-ſpoon was not managed to her ſatisfaction. I ſipped too <hi>loud</hi> from the <hi>ſaucer,</hi> when it would, I find, have been <hi>genteeler</hi> to apply a <hi>silent</hi> lip to the <hi>cup.</hi> Nay, what is worſe than all this, I had the misfortune to fold the bread and butter <hi>ineligantly;</hi> and it would have been better there too, if I had put the <hi>ends,</hi> rather than die <hi>ſide</hi> of it, to my mouth firſt.</p>
               <p>But that which moſt aſtoniſhed me, was her objection to the good old cuſtom of <hi>turning down</hi> my cup, which ſhe ſaid was out of the TON, and that it would
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0377100201:94"/>
give her great pleaſure, if, in future, I would lay the <hi>ſpoon acroſs</hi> the cup.</p>
               <p>I was perfectly petrified, and yet <q>held my tongue, and ſpake nothing.</q>—She propoſed walking, and, as I really thought the air might do the poor creature's head good, I drew on my gloves, and attended her towards the well-walk.—Alas! Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, nothing, I fear, can bring her about; for ſhe grew ten times worſe than ever, and if I was aſtoniſhed before, I was now almoſt ſtruck dead with the hugeneſs of my amazement.</p>
               <p>I had not the happineſs to hit her fancy even in my walk, which ſhe very fairly told me, was <hi>ridiculous;</hi> and that I held up my head too high, turned <hi>in</hi> my toes too much, and wanted the <hi>Graces</hi> in my arms.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:0377100201:95"/>She actually made an objection to the <hi>manner</hi> in which my wig was powdered, ſaid it was all in patches, and had not the regular ſprinkling of a man of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion.</p>
               <p>Upon this, I ventured gently to tell her, that I was but a country curate, that I had no pretenſions to <hi>faſhion</hi>—that I had, for my own part, nothing to do at watering-place, but to oblige her— that I was very ſorry, for the loftineſs of my head, which, for the time to come, ſhould be carried with more humility— that, if it would give her any pleaſure, I would take care to ſtoop till I bent neck and ſhoulders together—that, as to inverſion of the toes, I would learn to dance, late in the day as it was for me, and inconſiſtent as ſuch a part might be thought to the clerical character— in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to my arms, that I had hitherto only

uſed them in the ordinary offices of life, and found they performed very well for a plain man; but that, if ſhe had any favourite attitudes, or wiſhed me to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit in any poſtures to which ſhe was particularly partial, I would practiſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilantly at the looking-glaſs, and, rather than want the <hi>Graces</hi> ſhe ſpoke of, would abſolutely learn the exerciſe, and go through all the forms and ceremonies of legs, arms, head, and hands, like a young recruit. At the ſame time I begged her to conſider, that, as we had, ſince the day of our union, lived harmoniouſly, I warmly hoped we ſhould not be put out of tune by trifles, which are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves inſignificant, even if we admitted them to be eſſential to the <hi>etiquette</hi> of a watering-place. I, moreover, told her to remember, that I was at leaſt a <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> huſband, and made her happineſs the ſtudy, practice, and contrivance, of my
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0377100201:97"/>
whole life: and that, ſurely, where the cardinal duties were obſerved, it mattered little whether the toes were the breadth of a barley-corn too much in or out, or the head half an inch too lofty, or half an inch too low. I would have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in my defence, but that my good friend Mr. SEDLEY at that inſtant came to my relief, told us, <hi>as he advanced with warmth, vivacity and a chearful countenance, that,</hi> 
                  <q>if we did juſtice to his attachment to us, we might judge of the joy be felt in ſeeing us ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently chuſe a private path, which was to him a certain indication of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonial felicity.</q>
               </p>
               <p>There was ſomething ſo pretty in his ſpeech, that it made an impreſſion on my memory, and I have copied it <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batim.</hi> In leſs than half an hour, Mrs. HOMESPUN recovered her reaſon; her
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0377100201:98"/>
late lunacy was never hinted at, and, hoping to continue her good-nature, I invited this moſt agreeable gentleman to take another bit of ſupper with us.</p>
               <p>The manner in which he accepted the invitation, trebled the ſenſe of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour he did me by his company. What a gratification it is to have ſo ſenſible and entertaining a friend at a watering-place!</p>

               <p>A MAN, THORTON, who is <hi>true</hi> to the reliſh of pleaſure, can extract extacy even from diſappointment. The <hi>bliſs of bliſſes</hi> alone, could have made me happier than I was an hour ago.</p>
               <p>Hear the ſtory.</p>
               <p>Since the firſt moment I caſt my eye upon the bewitching HARRIET, I marked her for my own; and <hi>ſhe</hi> hath ſince been the <hi>grand</hi> point of all my inſinuation and ingenuity. Not a ſingle article hath been neglected that could touch her imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, move her heart, and catch her <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0377100201:100"/>
weakneſſes.</hi> I paid court to her fancy, to her feelings, to her foibles. Conſtant attention hath done the buſineſs I expected it would, and I have but one effort more, to be maſter of <hi>all</hi> that the ſineſt woman in the world has to beſtow.</p>
               <p>Laſt night, my THORNTON, was the conſcious period that yielded up every tranſport but <hi>the one.</hi> HORACE was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted to perform the funeral-ſervice over the corpſe of a fellow who died by a dropſy; (as the parſon of the pariſh was indiſpoſed;) and, it ſeems, he was to be buried at a town a mile diſtant from our lodgings.</p>
               <p>He went.—The opportunity was not to be omitted. I exerted myſelf. I ſparkled in the luſtre of STANHOPEAN ſentiments—I became eloquent, and ſoon communicated a part of <hi>my</hi> ardour to the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0377100201:101"/>
troubled boſom of HARRIET. I hit her, ſoft upon the heart. Our eyes met— <hi>they</hi> confirmed our <hi>ſentiments</hi>—our voices grew ſoft as the ſummer-breezes—there was no intruder—I laid my cheek cloſe to hers—they were both upon the glow— for the firſt time in my life, I kiſſed her lips—I repeated the preſſure—ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed me—I dropped upon my knee, and in that attitude repeated the offence —Nature was ſtirred to the uttermoſt— I continued to ſuck the delicious poiſon, and unawares ſhe returned the ſalutation. The dalliance was no longer to be borne; ſhe begged me, for God's ſake, to deſiſt. The fluſh of deſire and modeſty, were at war in her cheek—her boſom palpitated —I plied her with my precious maxims in a whiſper, that gave them additional graces—I laid my hand upon her heart: the throb was violent; and, as I caught her eagerly in my arms, her head ſunk
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0377100201:102"/>
in unreſiſting ſoftneſs on my ſhoulder, and, worked to the extreme betwixt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent and ſenſation, ſhe burſt into tears.</p>
               <p>I compoſed her cheek—drew her hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief gently over her eye, fixed her again, without offering to diſtreſs her, in her chair; and to this moment ſhe thinks I ſacrificed, to love, reſpect, delicacy, and friendſhip, a paſſion that is tearing me to pieces.</p>
               <p>In a few minutes HOMESPUN returned; he is no reader of looks, and I took my leave for the night with that <hi>eaſy, intrepid aſſurance</hi> which belongs to the great cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter I have adopted.</p>
               <p>And now, THORNTON, am I not a tolerable proficient in the ſcience of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation? Does any-thing come amiſs to me? Can I not <hi>aſſume with eaſe, and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0377100201:103"/>
wear with chearfulneſs, every ſhape?</hi> Are not heat, cold, luxury, abſtinence, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, gaiety, ceremony, eaſineſs, learning, trifling, buſineſs, and pleaſure, modes which, according to my Preceptor's ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, I am able to take, lay aſide, or change occaſionally, with as much eaſe as I would take and lay aſide my hat.— But you may expect nobler illuſtrations of this hereafter. I am yet in the outſet of my adventures—ſporting (by way of trial) with jejune experiments. The next time I can ſend THEE out of the way, HORACE HOMESPUN, beware! Thou haſt juſt eſcaped a ſore evil. A little while ago, thou wert within an inch of cuckoldom.</p>

               <p>SUCH a night as the laſt, I never paſſed. My poor wife has had a relapſe, Doctor. It returned at midnight upon her, and raged with the moſt frightful violence for above two hours. She is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely delirious, and I am the moſt wretched of men.</p>
               <p>About an hour after we were in bed, ſhe complained that there was no bearing
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0377100201:105"/>
the heat; though, in truth, this is one of the coldeſt places in England, and it had rained all the preceding evening. I felt her pulſe, and it was immoderately full, tumultuous, and rapid. I kiſſed her with all the tenderneſs of a ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thizing huſband;—ſhe aſked me, how I could poſſibly be <hi>ſo cruel?</hi> I offered to lay her dear head upon my boſom, as upon the pillow of affection, judging that ſhe would be pleaſed with my aſſiduities. Her eyes were ſtreaming in tears—her face was on fire—the ſighs came from her, palpably againſt her conſent. I preſſed to know the cauſe of this; at leaſt, to what ſhe attributed it; and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to throw on my cloaths, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a Doctor. Her cure, ſhe told me, was out of the reach of a Doctor; but that, if I would not ſuffer her to be quiet without fretting her by my officiouſneſs,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0377100201:106"/>
ſhe ſhould be under the neceſſity of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of the bed, and ſit till the morning in a chair. A little time after this, ſhe changed her manner, and with a kinder tone of the voice aſked me, if I would conſent to return home as ſoon as it was light. She caught my hand, begged my pardon, wetted it with her tears, and begged I would excuſe her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity. I drew her, fond and cloſe to my heart; and I felt <hi>hers,</hi> at that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, leap with agony. In the next mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhe requeſted me to leave her, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered herſelf haſtily head over ears with the bed-cloaths, and, ſaying that ſhe wiſhed I was wrapping her in the ſhroud, ſunk ſobbing upon her pillow. Oh! Doctor, what ſhall I do? What can be the matter? I am really unconſcious of offence. She is now in bed—perhaps, ſleep may alleviate her diſorder. The
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0377100201:107"/>
worſt of it is, ſhe will not allow me to ſpeak to any third perſon; and, as I myſelf know nothing of either maladies, or their proper medicines, I am dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully alarmed, and tremble for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.</p>

               <p>CERTAINLY, Mr. SEDLEY is the beſt young man in England. When he came to pay me the compliments of the morning, he found me in a very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected ſituation; and though he was far from inquiſitive, yet I could not conceal from his aſking eye the nature of my calamity. Poor young Gentleman! it was evident that he, <hi>felt</hi> for me: his countenance loſt, in a moment, all that fine glow that is natural to it; and, if
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0377100201:109"/>
my fancy does not deceive me, he had ſome difficulty to prevent a tear from ſtarting. He aſſured me, that words were never made to do juſtice to the feelings of wounded friendſhip; that he was more intereſted in every-thing that concerned me and my wife, than he could expreſs; and that, if I would ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt ſome little pretence, either of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or of invitation, to leave him with Mrs. HOMESPUN in the evening, he would certainly either comfort her by every miniſtration of the ſincereſt friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or, at worſt, he would find out the reaſons for her anxiety, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of her complaint; after which, he very well obſerved, the remedy would be eaſy. At this generous propoſal, in which his worthy diſpoſition was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, I was ready to weep; and, as we embraced each other at parting, our
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0377100201:110"/>
voices became of no uſe to us, and we could only ſhew, by our ſympathiſing enfoldings, that we had a ſincere and chriſtian regard for each other.</p>

               </head>
               <p>OH, CHARLOTTE! CHARLOTTE! what a perplexity am I thrown into, by this ſcheme of pleaſure! Accurſed be the hour in which I ſet my foot upon the confines of BUXTON! Unconſcious of any violent partialities, I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented while I was ignorant. In the dreary village, where our parſonage is a <hi>palace,</hi> I was ſufficiently happy, becauſe I ſaw nobody ſuperior to Mr. HOMESPUN. I was the Miniſter's lady, and the wives and daughters of the neighbourhood paid me the compliment of their beſt curtſey. My HORACE really looked handſome in
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0377100201:112"/>
his Sunday canonicals, and I viewed him in the pulpit with pleaſure.</p>
               <p>But, alas! my CHARLOTTE, the ſcene is changed. I have been ſeveral days in a place of politeneſs, where HORACE is the moſt awkward of the circle. My eyes are now opened to his imperfections —I <hi>ſee</hi> them, I <hi>feel</hi> them, I <hi>deteſt</hi> them. He is a lump of learning, without duc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility, without ſoftneſs, without—what Mr. SEDLEY calls, <hi>the Graces.</hi> I am ſometimes obliged to aſk ſeveral times before I can obtain an anſwer to the moſt ordinary queſtion, and then, at laſt, he burſts from his reverie, and pretends not to have heard me ſpeak to him. Can any-thing be ſo diſguſting? His converſation is unlike that of the reſt of the company; and, inſtead of bearing a part, in little, ſocial, and endearing <hi>chit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chat,</hi> he talks eternally about Locke, and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0377100201:113"/>
Livy, and Cicero, the Elements of Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm, the Problems of Euclid, and ſuch fellows—and many a time, when I have wanted him to put a pin in my hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief, or ſuch little offices of endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he has been wrapt up in medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and then ſtared me full in the face without knowing I was in the room.</p>
               <p>Then, he actually has a ſtrange ſhy method of treating me as a wife. There is no delicacy in his air, when he takes my hand: he ſhakes it indeed HEARTILY, but then he has the fat fiſt of a graſier, even though in other reſpects he is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeably thin. He kiſſes, with a cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony perfectly claſſical, as Mr. SEDLEY calls it. There is a pretty method, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, even in the management of the lips. By <hi>accident,</hi> Mr. SEDLEY ſtole a kiſs the other day, and he placed it, ſo directly, ſo gently, and ſo pathetically in
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0377100201:114"/>
the <hi>center,</hi> that I never felt ſuch a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation! I proteſt, CHARLOTTE, it ran thrilling through every vein of me, warmed my very heart, and almoſt took away my breath.</p>
               <p>We were, I remember, playing at queſtions and commands, the day being ſhowery, ſo that we could not ſtir out. The forfeit came round at laſt to HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RACE, and he ſmackt me, as uſual, in his round-about manner. Heaven par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me, CHARLOTTE, but I was obliged to draw my pocket-handkerchief acroſs my mouth, and had ſome difficulty to avoid making a wry face. If you was once in the company of Mr. SEDLEY— he is called the <hi>handſome</hi> SEDLEY here— you would never forget—gentle, grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, elegant, ſoft, genteel, and eloquent. —Heigho!—Why, CHARLOTTE, why did I marry, before I had ſeen
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0377100201:115"/>
ſomething of the world? Or, rather, Why, after I <hi>was</hi> married, why did I ever ſtray from carts and cottages, to the delightful dangers of a watering-place? —But I muſt hide my letter; Mr. HOMESPUN is coming towards the houſe, as erect as a walking-ſtick.</p>

               </head>
               <p>FANNY is much diſordered, my dear LUCY; the fainting with which ſhe was ſeized at the breakfaſt-rooms, has preyed on her ever ſince. Her ſpirits are greatly agitated. Her huſband attends her, with the diligence of a nurſe, and cannot be perſuaded to leave her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. The poor girl often drops the tear of gratitude, but ſpeaks leſs than uſual, as ſhe ſays, talking exhauſts her. She has twice hinted her wiſhes to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from hence, either to my father's, or to SCARBOROUGH, as we thought proper: and begs her removal may be pretty late at night, for company,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0377100201:117"/>
ſhe ſays, rather diſturbs her, ſince her laſt accident. Poor MORTIMER, her huſband, ſees her dying by inches before his face, and his unavailing officiouſneſs appears now and then, to go too near the heart of the ſinking FANNY. She is too indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to remove at preſent: for my part, I have not been able to ſet my foot yet in the ſtreet: I love my ſiſter too tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to leave her with a ſtrange woman, in a ſtrange place, eſpecially with one, who is merely paid for her attention, and who, conſequently, can have none of thoſe charming thoughts that enter into the heart of a tender relation. Sometimes, my dear, the changing a poſture, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the ſhifting a pillow, or fixing a chair, does more by the <hi>method</hi> of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, than all the elaborate efforts of an avowed nurſe. A Mr. SEDLEY—who is ſaid to be the beauty of the Bath, and was the perſon that handed FANNY down
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0377100201:118"/>
ſtairs, and was very obliging during her illneſs,—ſends every day, very reſpectfully, to know how the ſick lady improves in her health. As many of both ſexes were witneſs to poor FANNY'S diſtreſs, and as people <hi>ſhould</hi> have a fellow-feeling, in places of general reſort for cures, as well as faſhions, I wonder <hi>others</hi> have not paid this ſweet girl the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment.</p>
               <p>The <hi>manner</hi> in which this gentleman makes the enquiry, is pretty: he does not preſume upon the privilege of a public place, and ſend a blundering foot-boy with a meſſage, nor does he come, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding, <hi>himſelf,</hi> but he uſually writes a little billet, (every day varied, and containing a new turn,) in which his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions diſcover at once accompliſhment and high-breeding; and, what puts it out of any body's power to miſconſtrue it
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0377100201:119"/>
into deſign, he always addreſſes his cards to MR. MORTIMER. As my brother was reading one of theſe this morning to his wife, ſhe deſired to look at the hand, but had ſcarce held it to her eye, before ſhe dropt the paper, and, letting her arm fall languidly on the pillow, ſaid, very ſoftly, that ſhe could not manage it, and was weaker than ſhe imagined.</p>
               <p>She is now in a gentle doſe, and I took the opportunity it gave, to inform my dear Lucy of our preſent melancholy ſituation. Sir HARRY, and my mother are expected hourly. If FANNY really dies, my mother will certainly go diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted. Heaven bleſs you, and yours.</p>

               <p>IN the name of heaven, HAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIET, what are you about? Your letters alarm me beyond imagination. You are in the road to ruin: I ſee you upon the very verge of perpetual infamy. You can now mark the little imperfections of a huſband: you are blind to his many vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. You have caſt your eye on a man, whoſe perſon and manners you like bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: with <hi>this</hi> man, you have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready left <hi>alone:</hi> you <hi>may</hi> be left alone <hi>again.</hi> The next ſtep is too apparent to be mentioned: you are very gay, very young, very inexperienced: there is but one way left to prevent your deſtruction,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0377100201:121"/>
and <hi>that</hi> is, to return home directly, and make any excuſe to HORACE for the abruptneſs of your departure. I know nothing of the SEDLEY you ſpeak, nor do I wiſh to know him. Better had it been, on all hands, if <hi>you</hi> were as igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of him as I am. It is plain he hath pleaſed you <hi>too well;</hi> ſince the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is bought at the dear price of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to the beſt of huſbands. Yes, HAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIET, your HORACE is the beſt of huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands. He is an <hi>honeſt</hi> man, if he is not a <hi>brilliant</hi> man; and, if he does not ſhine in ſociety, he hath an excellent heart, and a ſimplicity of manners, truly amiable. The little points of objection you have made, are, when weighed againſt his various virtues, light, and of no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; while, on the other hand, SED<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEY has, very probably, nothing but an <hi>elegance in trifling</hi> to ſet him of.</p>

               <p>YOUR HARRIET is ſomething happier than when ſhe laſt ſat down to addreſs you. Mr. SEDLEY has pleaded the cauſe of poor HORACE ſo perſuaſively, and <hi>that</hi> behind his back, (there's a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous man for you!) that I have been induced to aſk his pardon, and I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to treat him with more politeneſs, which I find is indiſpenſible in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of a married woman to her huſband, even though he were indifferent to her.</p>
               <p>We have paſt together a very happy
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0377100201:124"/>
afternoon; and though I do not find any greater degree of tenderneſs for HORACE, yet, as I know how to make him happy, by merely ſuppreſſing thoſe ſentiments in his disfavour, which can do <hi>me no ſervice</hi> to diſcover, I feel the ſweets of <hi>diſguiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth</hi> upon ſome occaſions. I have reſtored HORACE to perfect ſerenity, and I as ſincerely thank Mr. SEDLEY, for taking me to taſk. Adieu.</p>

               <p>THE firſt blow is not yet finally given. Opportunity hath not favoured temptation <hi>ſufficiently.</hi> My ſyſtem, not only demands that I ſhould preſerve the fact <hi>private,</hi> but the reputation of both the man and the woman, <hi>unſuſpected.</hi> I am not to be a harum-ſcarum rake, who brutiſhly and boyiſhly boaſts of his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, but a man of pleaſure, who is to bathe his ſenſes in bliſs, and revel in the richeſt luxuries of enjoyment, <hi>(pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately,)</hi> with conſenting elegance; while <hi>(in public)</hi> I am to ſuſtain a fair charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and <hi>paſs upon men</hi> (who only look
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0377100201:126"/>
upon the ſurface) as a pattern of purity, and a model for morals.</p>
               <p>HARRIET is a bewitching, illiterate, ſweet piece of unpractiſed Nature. Her complexion is ardent, and I have ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſet <hi>her</hi> paſſions afloat; but I muſt take care to guard againſt working up <hi>my own.</hi> All the power of all-conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſſimulation is over, when DESIRE ſeizes the helm from the hand of cool and deliberate REASON. <hi>"Vigour and ſpirit"</hi> are mere madneſſes, without <hi>"verſatility</hi> "and <hi>complacence."</hi> Upon this principle, I muſt walk without deviation, like a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful pupil, in the path that is chalkt out for me. It is my buſineſs to <q>lead right reaſon in the triumphant fetters and ſhackles of the heart, and the paſſions.</q> In order to accompliſh this, THORNTON, I muſt keep <hi>myſelf</hi> collected, and never ſtrike till I have fully thrown every body
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0377100201:127"/>
about me off <hi>their</hi> guard, and till I can, then, gratify, conquer, triumph, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy in full ſecurity. My blood, THORN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON, is as cool as a turtle's. HARRIET'S, I ſee, is upon the boil: yet ſhe <hi>has</hi> beauty enough to ſtir me; and when the <hi>ſecure</hi> moment offers itſelf, fear not her diſappointment. Her wiſhes—ſhall not be vain.</p>

                  <hi>LETTER XXXII. SEDLEY</hi> to <hi>THORNTON.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I HAVE appeared in public. I dined this day at the ordinary. <hi>Ordinary</hi> indeed! ſuch a room full of emptineſs I never beheld: citizens apeing the men of mode, women of ſallow countenances, and fops, who would be thought witty and elegant, when they are merely ſaucy, and affected, and dull. Alas! THORN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON, what a pity, what a mortification! I have not a ſingle competitor,—I mean not in point of gallantry, for that mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates againſt my ſyſtem of pleaſure,— but there is no one of <hi>my</hi> ſex from whom I can gain any real honour in the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon. However, as even blockheads are
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0377100201:129"/>
worth gaining, and their hearts worth miſleading; as they have all foibles to flatter, and weakneſſes that may be for our intereſt to work upon: I began to ſhew off, and brought the whole company over, as my admirers. I practiſed all the charming converſation-rules of DORMER, with as much facility as if I had been the author of them; and, indeed, they are ſo ſuited to my own natural ſentiments, that I only conſider him as having <hi>writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi> what I long ago <hi>thought,</hi> and what I will henceforward invariably practiſe, till I am incapable of farther enjoyment. I had the happineſs to ſit parallel to the very fop, already recorded in my correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence; and he was <hi>over-dreſſed</hi> to all the extravagancy of the <hi>ton;</hi> while I had the advantage, of not in any ſort, invad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the modeſty of Nature. The fool lookt as if he piqued himſelf upon his gaudineſs, he ſtroaked his ruffles, diſplayed
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0377100201:130"/>
the baubles of his watch, perkt up his head to gaze in the pier-glaſſes, pulled his watch in and out of his fob ſeveral times, eyed himſelf aſcance, and figitted up and down in his chair, with all the inſignificant whiffling agility of the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key in the fable, who had ſeen the world.</p>
               <p>Cloſe to the ſide of this popinjay, ſat an unweildy animal, who, to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of a bear, united the uncouthneſs of an elephant, without half its ſagacity; and who, in feeding, ſcattered his offals a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round, to the utter diſmay of the cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb, who, fearful of complaining, and alarmed at the ſize of the antagoniſt, took ſhelter at a ſmall table, or rather ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, and fluttered himſelf clean, while the monſter enjoyed his embarraſſment. I am happy to tell you, that, though this piece of pleaſantry ſet the unpoliſhed ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in a roar, I commanded my features,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0377100201:131"/>
and did not give way to ridicule. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto I have <hi>never laught out</hi> ſince I came to BUXTON, and I ſolemnly hope I ſhall never be booriſh, of boiſterous enough to laugh <hi>out</hi> again, while I have being.</p>
               <p>I eat elegantly, drank diſcreetly. I <hi>ſmiled</hi> at a thouſand <hi>dull</hi> ſtories, and only told <hi>one</hi> myſelf, and that, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivably a-propos. I heard long talkers, without appearing to be tired, and I looked every perſon whom I addreſſed full in the face. I dreſſed my countenance in ſoftneſs, and gave the <hi>douçeur</hi> to all my motions. I interrupted no man, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted cautiouſly, palliated tenderly, decided a diſpute betwixt the fop and the glutton with a good-humoured plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantry, caught the habits of the company, ſwore not at all, and adapted my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation to every ſpeaker. The conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0377100201:132"/>
was, THORNTON, that I was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately known to be <hi>ſomebody,</hi> nay, I was the admiration of <hi>every body:</hi> my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany was cheriſhed, my abſence regretted, and, at my going out of the room, a buz of univerſal approbation followed me down ſtairs. In a word, THORNTON, the fops were annihilated, the prattlers were ſilenced, and I went off in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleateſt triumph of unconteſted excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
               <p>And thus, having ſettled my reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and eſtabliſhed myſelf PUBLICLY, it only remains that I enjoy my popularity by <hi>appearing</hi> to deſerve it; and then I may bid defiance to cenſure, and then —WELCOME VOLUPTUOUSNESS!</p>

               <p>RECEIVE TIMOTHY, the greet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of THOMAS.</p>
               <p>I, and my maſter, arrived on the day we ſet out at this execrable place, where I have as yet done little more than ſtick a pin in SEDLEY'S hair, and peruſe a page of his CHESTERFIELD after dinner.</p>
               <p>Theſe books we are both exceſſively fond of, and as he always leaves them in the chamber-window, I take them <hi>up</hi> when he lays them <hi>down</hi> to walk out; by which means we make pretty nearly
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0377100201:134"/>
the ſame progreſs. If any thing, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I am half a volume before-hand with him, and, in the opinion of the judicious, am the finer gentleman of the two.</p>
               <p>Not that my maſter, like your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon coxcombs, ever mentions his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, or his ſtudies to his ſervant, any more than I diſcover mine to him: we are both better bred; but I have heard too much of CHESTERFIELD at table, at tea, and every where elſe, not to have had, long ago, a reliſh for his writings; and I ſcruple not to tell thee, TIMO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THY, that I have formed myſelf, what you know me to be, entirely on his Lordſhip's model.</p>
               <p>He had, beyond compariſon, the pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt pen, at an epiſtle, in Europe, and is at once ſo neat and plain, that it is
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0377100201:135"/>
impoſſible to miſunderſtand him. I once was as vulgar a dog in my choice of books as any in the kingdom;—I had no more taſte, TIMOTHY, than a teacher of the table of multiplication. I thought the luſcious love-ſcenes of ROCHESTER delicious, and had a mighty hankering after the memoirs of CLELAND; but hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven defend me from ſuch barefaced traſh, The bawdry brutes!</p>
               <q>They ſhew too much to raiſe deſire.</q>
               <p>No TIM. Stanhope has brought me round, he teaches that <q>the very ſhoe has power to wound;</q> and I am by God's grace, and his Lordſhip's graces, as gracefully graceleſs a raſcal, and as pretty a fellow as any in Britain.</p>
               <p>I expect, by the Earl's aſſiſtance, to do an infinite deal of miſchief at this watering-place;—my eye (though no
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0377100201:136"/>
ſettler) has pointed at a bath-maid, who attracted me in the handing a tumbler of Spa-water. Nauſeous as all minerals are, I took it and toſt it off, becauſe, I find, to refuſe is <hi>ungenteel.</hi> I ſhall ſubdue this damſel at my leiſure, having, for my more ſerious <hi>ſimulations,</hi> as his Lordſhip calls them, a noble object in view, of whom you will hear more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly in my next.</p>
               <p>SEDLEY is upon ſome project, but I ſcorn to be guilty of impertinent cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity; and he is as much above mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either a confident or a pimp of his ſervant, I ſhould with more propriety have ſaid his <hi>gentleman,</hi> as his gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is of wearing a livery of worſted lace. God and the Graces ſpeed him, ſay I, in all his undertakings! Every man has a right in this world to follow
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0377100201:137"/>
the bent of his fancy, to <q>ſtrew the way over with flowers,</q> as the ſong ſays, and to be as happy, both up and <hi>a-bed,</hi> as he poſſibly can.</p>

               <p>UPON my word!—Oh brave! —Why, you have made a rapid progreſs, and are an apt ſcholar, that's certain. A young creature ſcarce two-and-twenty, bred upon a barren mountain, little read in the ways of any part of the world, but the ways of a circumſcribed village— a farmer to your father, and an honeſt wholeſome dairy-woman for your mother —a little modicum of money to the tune of five hundred pounds, the ſavings of twenty pains-taking years of your poor grandam—and, and—to turn <hi>fine lady</hi> all of a ſudden!—to trip to BUXTON bath, in the height of the ſeaſon, forget all

your country friends, and country <hi>feelings</hi> —all in a <hi>week</hi>—a <hi>little</hi> week!

Down to the very earth, I drop my curteſey, faſhionable Mrs. HOMESPUN!</p>
               <p>But, gracious God! can it be poſſible? Is not the laſt letter, marked with your name, a forgery? Can the character, be Mrs. HOMESPUN'S? Can it be written by <hi>her,</hi> whom I have ſo often diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed for innocence in the midſt of gaiety, and modeſty in the very boſom of amuſement?</p>
               <p>Is it practicable, in ſo ſhort a ſpace of time, to loſe all that's valuable, all that's feminine, all that's truly endearing; and to ſubſtitute, the moſt deſpicable,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0377100201:146"/>
deteſted contraries? Ah! HARRIET, HARRIET, how art thou fallen! Thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, ingrateful creature! Poor HORACE, what is become of him?

               <p>But what is the BOOK you allude to, as the panacea, of a perſon polluted, and a heart ſet againſt the venerable maxims of morality? Alas! Madam, be not every way deluded: nor books, nor tongues, nor caſuiſtry, nor all the chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane of eloquence miſapplied, can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly overturn the ſober ſingle ſyſtem of unentangled innocency. I <hi>yet</hi> hope, you are not in that wretched ſtate, which, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing of forgiveneſs, hunts about for apology, nor, rather than ſeem <hi>deſtitute,</hi>

condeſcend to take up with one, that in effect, plunges you deeper in crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality. A drowning creature, catches at the ſlighteſt twig: and a guilty woman, is fain to ſupport herſelf from falling in her own eſteem, againſt a tottering pillar.</p>
               <p>BOOKS, HARRIET!—find a refuge from the keenneſs of your own reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in BOOKS! Periſh the volume, and may the name of its author deſcend ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominiouſly to poſterity, in which the error, that you have, under your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic circumſtances, been guilty of, is not <hi>palpably diſcountenanced!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mention, however, the name of that book from which you receive comfort, and, woman as I am, I will undertake to baffle its boaſted ſyſtem, and ſhew, that the only way to genuine pleaſure, is through the paths of purity, integrity,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0377100201:148"/>
and ſingleneſs. I am, and have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued a widow, five years upon principle: the man I have loſt, was even leſs ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did than Mr. HOMESPUN, nor had his perſon any peculiar attractions. What of that? He was good, he was great, and he was tender as Heaven. I wanted not temptation, while he was living, to indulge indelicacies, but I valued both his honour and my own; and though I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to no gifts of preternatural conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, I defy either <hi>books</hi> or <hi>men,</hi> to make me act in diametrical oppoſition to common-ſenſe and chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>But, juſt at the preſent criſis, you are, of all women in the world, the moſt inexcuſeable! Oh, heavens! HARRIET, reflect a moment. More than three parts gone with child—<hi>that</hi> child your firſt-born—the father an honour to his profeſſion—his profeſſion the <hi>Church!</hi>—
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0377100201:149"/>
I will ſay no more, for if you had <hi>my</hi> heart, enough has been ſaid already to move you to add to your preſent errors, the crime of ſuicide.</p>

               <p>ALL goes on to the utmoſt content of my heart. Oh, THORNTON! STANHOPE is infallible. His maxims are perfect anodynes againſt diſappointment, and I ſhall (I do really think) render him more celebrated than ever, by prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically illuſtrating every precept in every period!—I have played the ſecond part of the ſame tune with HARRIET, and I half believe I ſhall make her a proſelyte; for ſhe hath got <hi>volume the firſt,</hi> and I have taken care to pencil the places at which I would have her ſtop: a mark in the margin always attracts. HORACE and I, too, are hand and glove, and a very

worthy prieſt he is, for an HOMESPUN, I'll aſſure thee.</p>
               <p>I will give thee, however, an inſtance or two of my proficiency in the arts of pleaſing. When all was over, I paid my reſpects to HARRIET and her Lord, at the accuſtomed hour, without the leaſt viſible embarraſſment, or alteration of countenance. The poor woman, indeed, made but a bungling piece of work of it, bluſhed, ſtammered, and ſtopt ſhort; while I took care to preſerve every muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and lineament ſteady and unmoved. I ſee the efficacy of this moſt materially, for, had I not practiſed this preſence of mind, I do verily believe even the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſagacious HOMESPUN would have ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected what had happened. I took him by the hand, with the uſual cordiality, and we walkt to FAIRFIELD, a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring village, (whither by the by he

                  <salute>Dear Doctor,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>THINGS are ſo pleaſingly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, that I have been over-ruled as to my deſign of going away even at the end of the fortnight, and I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to procure another week's receſs, in order to extend my HARRIET'S hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and enjoy myſelf the ſpirited, yet moral and engaging conduct of Mr. SEDLEY, who, every day, becomes more agreeable, and who, I do truly believe, has been not a little inſtrumental in
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0377100201:160"/>
bringing about my poor wife to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſenſe of her duty and right reaſon. If any-thing, ſhe is more cordial to me than before my departure from the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, and is at once lively and obliging.</p>
               <p>I take it for granted, the ſtrange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct I tranſmitted you an account of in my late letters, was only a tranſient gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs, not very infrequent, as I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, Doctor, to the fair ſex, about HARRIET'S age, which is very well called, in one of SHAKESPEARE'S trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that I read formerly, the <q>heyday of youthful blood.</q> We grave folks, you know, my dear DIGGORY, ought to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low for all this. Poor thing, I pity her, and am half angry with myſelf that I ſhould have treated the overflowing, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferveſcent emanations, as I may ſtile them, of a juvenile mind, as a ſerious delirium.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:0377100201:161"/>But, thank God, it is not gone abroad to any perſon who is capable of circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the whiſper of the day to the detriment of a fellow-creature. Mr. SED<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEY, who, I can eaſily ſee, is to be truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with every thing, and my old friend, and brother-collegian, Doctor DIGGORY, are the only perſons informed of the matter, and ſo all is well. But do not, I charge you, think too hardly of her for what hath been ſaid. It was all a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentation, and you ſhould admire your heavenly HARRIET, as you uſed to call her, the <hi>more,</hi> for having been <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured.</hi> I can aſſure you, I am at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent more ſatisfied with <hi>her</hi> than I am with <hi>myſelf:</hi> and, indeed, ſhe has the advantage of me; for ſhe appears in the light of a perſon <hi>calumniated,</hi> and I am only one in a ſtate of conſcious error, and <hi>probation.</hi>

You are deep in my debt, and though I am now rich in the ineſtimable trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of reconciliation, yet a line from you would add materially to my fortune, and I ſhould have to thank Heaven for as full a meaſure of felicity, as it is, perhaps, either proper or poſſible to taſte on this ſide of it.</p>

is over, to whimper, lament the loſs of reputation, the deſtruction of their eternal peace of mind, and grow ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornly refractory, or elſe ſullenly repine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This was formerly a vile piece of buſineſs, and was a ſore draw-back upon the felicity of fruition; but the converts of CHESTERFIELD have no trouble of this ſort to apprehend. As the confeſſor can make the conſent of a good-natured nun a point of piety and religion; ſo a man of manner, dreſs, addreſs, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation, may manifeſtly prove, to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther maid, wife, or widow, that the ſhorteſt, as well as the ſofteſt conveyance to heaven, is, <hi>upon a feather-bed.</hi>

require—I have firmly perſuaded HARRIET, that all our future pleaſure depends on behaving ten times <hi>better</hi> than ever to HORACE—and laſtly, I have prevailed on the curate to indulge his wife a few days longer, as a firſt inſtance of his repentance. In the raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her heart, ſhe hath told all to a <hi>Mrs.</hi> LA MOTTE, who hath written a chiding epiſtle in the old ſcolding way; and to this, I find, ſhe (HARRIET) hath replied in juſtification of herſelf. Here I was obliged to ſet her right, and have taken care to ſee her diſpatch a peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial piece of <hi>policy,</hi> which will bring all round again. This ſame <hi>Mrs.</hi> LA MOTTE is in a ſtate of widowhood, and much in love with her weeds—a great beauty— and, I ſee by one of her letters, (which I <hi>diſſimulated</hi> out of HARRIET,) a great <hi>boaſter.</hi> I furthermore underſtand, that ſhe is a conſtant church-goer, has a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly

               <p>THERE is nothing, ſaith my creed, <q>ſo delicate as a man's moral character, and nothing which it is ſo much his <hi>intereſt</hi> to preſerve pure.</q>—I have been at church, THORNTON, where HOMESPUN officiated as teacher. He hath a ſnuffle in his noſe; his voice is deſtitute of that harmonious variety, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to all ſorts of eloquence; and his organs of articulation, appear conſiderably obſtructed.</p>
               <p>However, I took him by the hand, upon his deſcending from the pulpit; returned him my ſincere thanks, in a
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0377100201:175"/>
well-invented compliment, for the <hi>elegance</hi> of his diſcourſe; applauded his <hi>delivery;</hi> lamented that I had not <hi>often</hi> been made ſo happy; and almoſt brought the tears of virtue and vanity, into the good man's eyes, at the pathos of my concluſion.</p>
               <p>"There is no living in the world," you know, THORNTON, <q>without a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſant indulgence for peoples weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</q> In a ſhort time, I expect to reach the ſummit; for, after only an hour's practice, I found myſelf able to call out a palpable tear, only by placing a <hi>chair</hi> before my face, and, by the force of imagination, repreſenting <hi>it</hi> as a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain perſon in diſtreſs, which I had an <hi>intereſt</hi> in relieving.</p>
               <p>And now I am talking upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of ſympathy, I muſt tell thee, THORN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON, that I have made myſelf ſtill more
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0377100201:176"/>
popular than ever in this little place, by ſeveral acts of <hi>unoſtentatious oſtentation</hi>— by giving occaſional ſmall ſums to people, who make it utterly unneceſſary for me to be my <hi>own</hi> trumpeter. There are a ſet of characters that will raiſe a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor's reputation, without any drudgery on his ſide: theſe people have <hi>tongue</hi> enough, however poor they may be in other reſpects; and all the good you do, though ſilent and ſecret as the noon of night, ſhall ſhine like <q>the light that ſhineth unto the perfect day,</q> by means of thoſe ſame grateful goſſips.</p>

               <p>ONCE more, receive an account of a tender tranſaction, which I cannot conceal from thee. Relating upon paper, to the friend of one's heart, (for ſuch thou art to me,) any buſineſs, or event, that hath afforded tranſport, is an office of a pleaſing kind.</p>
               <p>HARRIET, is as richly formed by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for rapture, as ever was woman; and will, I am in hopes, ſoon be an adept in the <hi>ſcience</hi> of pleaſing.

She hath been <hi>ruined and undone,</hi> as ſhe terms it, by the baſeſt of men.—And who doſt thou think that man <hi>is,</hi> THORNTON?—Neither more nor leſs than my fellow THOMAS, who is, I'll aſſure thee, a would-be STANHOPEAN: but, truſting merely to picked-up precepts—the very crumbs that have fallen from his maſter's table—he ſtumbles in the effort, and diſcovers his livery, his dependency, and his education, even in his amours. All this, I enjoy, thou knoweſt.—The forſaken nymph came to complain of <hi>my Mr.</hi> THOMAS. She is very pretty, and very loquacious; but hear the ſtory in her own words.</p>

                  <head>THE STORY OF THE PRETTY BATH-MAID.</head>
                  <p>AN'T pleaſe your Honour, I am but a ſervant, and live, by handing my water to gentryfolks. I have tended the well-ſide, ſince BUXTON bath became <hi>famuſh;</hi> and nobody's tumbler was oftener filled than mine. Till the week before laſt, I was the happieſt water-wench that ever dipt her glaſs in the well: all the <hi>qallety</hi> knew me, all the ladies loved me, and all the gentlemen quarrelled which ſhould drink firſt; but matters are now altered, and I am <hi>aſheamed</hi> to take my <hi>ſtand</hi> at the place, becauſe of the baſeneſs of your Honour's <hi>unhoneſt</hi> Mr. THOMAS.</p>
                  <p>The arts he has uſed to tangle me, and take away my <hi>wartue,</hi> are monſtrous, and ſuch, as would make the ſtouteſt <hi>ſhe</hi>
                     <pb n="167" facs="tcp:0377100201:180"/>
in the country ſtumble. I am ſure, for my part, I ſtood it, till I could ſtand it no longer. If your Honour will hear me out, and do me <hi>juſtis,</hi> ſeeing as my cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter is gone, and therewithal my water, and with that my bread, ſo that I have now neither bread <hi>nor</hi> water, I will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold every-thing, and let your Goodneſs ſee the affair from top to bottom.</p>
                  <p>Poor girl, ſit down, ſit down; I am ſorry for the loſs of your water, with all my heart, and ſhall very chearfully ſee as much of the affair, as you drink proper to ſhew me—Sit down, therefore, child, and ſhew away.</p>
                  <p>You muſt know, Sir, <hi>as how,</hi> when bathing and drinking the waters is over, and your Honour and ſuch-like fine folk are all buſy a-dancing; we ſervant-people, ſometimes get together to a <hi>leſſerrer</hi> room,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0377100201:181"/>
and have a little hop of our own. This happened the very firſt night I ſaw Mr. THOMAS, who I obſerved, ſoon after he came into town, walk round the well, and then backwards and forwards; and, to be ſure, there was ſomething in his putting his foot to the ground, taking it off again, ſwinging his arm, flouriſhing his ſwitch, and ſaluting the fellow-ſervants, that made him look a king to the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Well, Sir, he <hi>chus'd</hi> me for his part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and tho' I ſay it, I can ſhake a foot with my betters; nay, at a <hi>country</hi>-dance, I'll turn my back neither to gentle nor ſimple.</p>
                  <p>If your Honour had heard the <hi>high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliers</hi> he crammed my poor head with, all the while we were at it—the ſoft things he ſaid, while we led out—the <hi>wows</hi> he made, as we handed up the middle—and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0377100201:182"/>
the tender oaths and <hi>rodermuntadoes</hi> he ſwore, while we right and left handed it, or caſt off, and joined hands again—while at the ſame time the muſic ſtruck up enough to melt one's heart—with candles lighted, and i' the ſummer-ſeaſon—your Honour would not blame me ſo much for giving away my ſoul and body to the moſt <hi>artfulleſt</hi> of his <hi>ſect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In ſhort, Sir, he talkt me over ſo finely about <hi>this</hi> and <hi>that,</hi> that before I left the room, and we broke up, I did not know whether I ſtood upon my head or my heels.</p>
                  <p>After dancing was over, and Mr. THO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAS and I had made ourſelves all of a heat, or, as I remembers <hi>he</hi> called it, all of an <hi>ardor,</hi> we took a walk in the grove by the hall, to cool ourſelves. And <hi>there</hi> he began to flouriſh it again—overpowered
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0377100201:183"/>
me with ſuch an ocean of love-ſayings, and, in ſhort, talked ſo different from my old ſweetheart ROGER DOUSIT, who is all dull and downright, as I may ſay, that I <hi>declares</hi> to your Honour, he at laſt made me think it would be a ſin to refuſe him; and ſo—God forgive me!—and ſo—</p>
                  <p>And ſo—you did <hi>not</hi> refuſe, hey? Is that it?—</p>
                  <p>Here the poor girl drew out her hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief, and had ſincerely a very great occaſion for it.</p>
                  <p>She told me, in a tone, THORNTON, that touched me, that if, notwithſtanding what THOMAS ſaid, ſhe had been wicked, ſhe was a ruined woman, that was all— that it might do very well for <hi>gentlefolks</hi> to play falſe with one another, becauſe <hi>they</hi> had got <hi>wherewithal</hi> to waſh all white
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0377100201:184"/>
again; but that a black ſpot in a <hi>poor</hi> woman, who <hi>pended</hi> on her water—was never to be rubbed out:—that, more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the news had ſome-how got air, and ſhe was pointed at by all the ill-natured fingers in the place. She ſaid, with aſtoniſhing ſimplicity, that the man fairly <hi>overſet</hi> her with his new-fangled <hi>gibberiſh</hi>—but that ſhe found 'twas all over with her. She added, that, for her own part, ſhe did not ſo much mind it, as ſhe could turn her hand to any-thing, and would leave the town in a twinkle; but that ſhe had an old mother, that had been bedridden theſe eight months, who lived at FAIRFIELD, and who muſt now want bread as well as herſelf. Nay, for that matter, ſaid the girl, ſhe'll ſoon be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for, if ſhe hears of my ſlip, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out troubling the pariſh; for I ſhall ſoon break her heart: I ſhall ſoon ſend my
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0377100201:185"/>
poor old mother out of the world; for ſhe is a <hi>good</hi> woman, Sir, and would ſooner bury me than ſee me what I am now. DOUSIT will turn up his noſe at me <hi>now;</hi> and without your Honour makes Mr. THOMAS do me <hi>juſtis,</hi> ſo as that I may become honeſt again, and do it in the lawful way—God only knows what courſe I muſt take?</p>
                  <p>She now dropt her tears, THORNTON, as faſt, to uſe the language of SHAKE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SPEARE,
<q>
                        <l>As the Arabian tree</l>
                        <l>Its medicinal gum.</l>
                     </q>
At this very moment THOMAS came in with a meſſage on which he had been diſpatched.</p>
                  <p>What is it, THORNTON, what curſed troubleſome thing is it, at once inviſible,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0377100201:186"/>
and audacious, that lodges in our boſoms beyond reach of our revenge, to make the ſtouteſt of us children and cowards?</p>
                  <p>Never did GARRICK exhibit, or SHAKE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SPEARE deſcribe, ſuch a look, and attitude, as that of poor TOM at his entrance, on obſerving ſo unexpected an object.</p>
                  <p>He ſtammered, he ſtaggered, he turned white, and attempted to retreat.</p>
                  <p>I commanded him to ſtay; and, taking my ſword from the hook, gave him his choice, and one that might have puzzled a much wiſer man—either to die or marry. Fear operated even ſo ſtrong, as to make him chuſe the latter.</p>
                  <p>He fell on his knees, and would have entered into explanations. I would not
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0377100201:187"/>
hear them.—The ceremony that HAMLET uſes with his quondam friends now paſſed between us, and I made them both ſwear upon my ſword.</p>
                  <p>I promiſed them a dower—the woman was in extacy, and paid me, by ſuch a look of gratitude, that, had REYNOLDS been there, he would have made the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-wench immortal by drawing it.</p>
                  <p>I am above altercation: of this THO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAS is aware. Nay, I believe, he likes the girl.—They ſhall be united as ſoon as poſſible: and what the devil can be the reaſon, that I am more happy in putting theſe two people together, than all the joys I ever taſted with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite and yielding HARRIET, I cannot tell.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="175" facs="tcp:0377100201:188"/>Were it not that I have contrived, as uſual, to get HORACE out of the way, and that I never break an aſſignation, I ſhould certainly avoid ſeeing <hi>her,</hi> or any body <hi>elſe,</hi> this evening.—Is not this unaccountable?

               <p>THE ſtory of thy bath-maid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted me ſtrangely; and I have felt the more pleaſure in giving it a tear, becauſe I perceive it hath penetrated even the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt invulnerable PHILIP SEDLEY.</p>
               <p>But how thou art able to ſtand the ſhock of ſo many radient eyes, and yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed charms,—wrapt round and round as thou art in the elyſium of voluntary and voluptuous embraces—a young fellow of ſpirit too—is, to <hi>me,</hi> moſt unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably myſterious.—In defiance of all the cautionary precepts of thy divine DOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MER—in defiance of all empiriciſm—I
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0377100201:190"/>
ſhould certainly break out, and even at the riſque of overturning the whole well-woven web of gallantry, dwindle into a downright inamerato, and quite loſe the ſubtle diſtinction betwixt ſimulation and laudible inſincerity.</p>
               <p>And ſo thou hadſt the ſupreme of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, in uniting thy faithleſs footman to the beautiful bath-maid!</p>
               <p>I'll tell thee what, SEDLEY,—thou art —(if thou wilt allow me for once the coinage of a new word)—thou art but half CHESTERFIELDED.—The impreſſion made upon thee by the pale face of the conſcious THOMAS—the pleaſure thou hadſt at wiping away the drops of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence and perturbation from the cherry cheek of ſimplicity—and thy wiſhing to ſoliloquiſe, and be excuſed, even from the arms of the tempting and <hi>married</hi> HAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIET
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0377100201:191"/>
—are all ſymptoms totally <hi>unſtanho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean</hi> (there's another word for thee).</p>
               <p>Take care, SEDLEY: thou art upon the eve of a relapſe—a relapſe in favour, not of DORMER, but of down-right DOU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIT'S ſingle-dealing.</p>
               <p>And yet, my friend, ſhall I once again confeſs to you my infirmity—my uneſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment in the maxims of thy Precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor?—I cannot blame thy weakneſſes, nor can I—however deſtructive they may be to <hi>thy</hi> ſyſtem—avoid wiſhing thou mayſt continue thy preſent tendencies, eſpecially as, by thy own honeſt confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, thou haſt found more gratification in them, than in ſupporting the toilſome taſk of eternal diſingenuity.</p>
               <p>Nor ought I, indeed, to <hi>call</hi> this a weakneſs in me. If to be happy is the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0377100201:192"/>
ultimatum of all earthly purſuits—if it is equally the effort of every different order of men, it aſſuredly follows, that <hi>that</hi> conduct is the moſt rational by which the greateſt ſhare of felicity is procured. The cloſeſt application of human wit and wiſdom can do no more than point out to thee the moſt ſolid degree of joy, and it matters not whether that joy is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the practice of <hi>one</hi> ſyſtem or <hi>another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The laſt action thou haſt recorded (I allude to the promiſed nuptials of thy bath-maid) was evidently agreeable to the ſentiments of SENECA, SOCRATES, and all the wiſe and good men both of the Eaſt and Weſt; and ſince the precepts of STANHOPE have been unable to give thee a ſuperior, or even an <hi>equal</hi> felicity, how proper and conſiſtent with right rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is it in me, to adviſe thee to walk
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0377100201:193"/>
in that path wherein thou haſt found the moſt pleaſure? Laugh not—ridicule not, I beſeech thee: thou art not, I hope, ſo much a tool to the taſte of the times —ſo much a dupe to prejudiced opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions—as to diſlike even the balance of bliſs which is now in thy favour, merely becauſe the ſcale hath been turned by a worthy action—that would be inſanity.</p>
               <p>To love duplicity, and certain ſophiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical diſtinctions, merely for the ſake of double-dealing, and when plain, clear, clean, uncrooked honeſty will anſwer thy purpoſe much <hi>better,</hi> is at once ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and diabolical.</p>
               <p>On the whole, therefore, I adviſe thee, in the deliberation of my heart, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the aforeſaid SENECA, or ſome other ſyſtematical moraliſt, inſtead of STANHOPE; and to lay <hi>him</hi> quickly
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0377100201:194"/>
aſide in a corner of thy trunk, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified to confer the comfort he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes to adminiſter.</p>
               <p>And, indeed, SEDLEY, to open my whole ſoul to thee, I muſt own thee, that I very much ſuſpect his Lordſhip's ſentiments. Even in my occaſional deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings here in Town, ſince thy departure, I have not been able to make them bear the teſt quite to my ſatisfaction: ſuch, eſpecially, as relate to the ſuduction of the tender ſex. I made a ſlight experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, no longer ago than laſt night, of his moſt favourite maxim, namely, to taſte the joys of <hi>ſecurity,</hi> mingled in embraces; and yet, though I do not think I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted myſelf unadroitly, it did not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together anſwer the ſatisfaction he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to reſult from it</p>
               <p>Thou art not a ſtranger to the elegan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0377100201:195"/>
of SOPHIA VERNON, the new-mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried wife of the man whoſe promotion from enſign to lieutenant it was our joint endeavour, ſome time ago, to effect: his gratitude is ſtill—<q>tremblingly alive all o'er;</q> and, by a natural conſequence, he is without the leaſt tincture of ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, and eſteems every inſtance of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular enquiry after his wife, or friend, as a mark of generoſity in his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor.</p>
               <p>This leaves the way to an intimacy with his SOPHIA fair and unobſtructed; and ſhe has already caught ſo much of the Lieutenant's enthuſiaſm, that ſhe pays me the tribute of a roſy-red bluſh of acknowledgment as often as I approach her. They have lately purchaſed a pretty cottage, amidſt the vernal beauties of SURRY: it is ſurrounded by gardens, not <hi>cittiſh,</hi> but genteel: there are no nudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,

no monſtrous urns, no fantaſtical fountains, no chubby cherubims, no tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toed Mercury's, ſmirking Venuſſes, nor ſpruce holly-hedges: 'tis all <q>true Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to advantage dreſſed;</q> the verdure is voluptuous, the flower-beds well weed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the ſhrubbery gratefully ſhaded, and the alcove ſmiles upon the Thames.</p>
               <p>Within this alcove I yeſterday took the tea that was prepared by the hand of SOPHIA, whoſe huſband had invited me preſſingly, to make the ſolitude of his lady more ſocial by my company, as he was himſelf under the neceſſity of tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a journey into SUSSEX.</p>
               <p>As you love brooks and books, hills and rills, my dear Mr. THORNTON, ſaid he, ſmilingly, you and SOPHY will be able to paſs away your time to your mutual ſatisfaction, till the return of your friend.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:0377100201:197"/>Poor, unſuſpicious pair!</p>
               <p>They united their entreaties, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed: Lieutenant VERNON ſet out, and left to thy friend <hi>(in truſt)</hi> the moſt beautiful property upon the banks of the THAMES. In a word, he began his journey in the fragrant coolneſs of yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day's evening, and I was left at full li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to abuſe the confidence he placed in my integrity, and, in return for his hoſpitality, do my utmoſt to deſtroy the chaſtity of <hi>her,</hi> whom he doats upon with the ſincereſt tenderneſs.</p>
               <p>The tear which ſhe dropt upon his hand as ſhe kiſſed it, at parting, drew from him <hi>another,</hi> accompanied by ſuch a look, as defies either tongue, pen, or pencil, and went at the time ſo cloſe to my heart, that I could not but imagine the paſſion betwixt two, was more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0377100201:198"/>
than if it were divided betwixt two-and-twenty. One man and one wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, thought I, may certainly be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier than a Sultan; and I had rather poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the real, <hi>undiſſimulated</hi> love of a SO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHIA VERNON, than command the keys of the ſeraglio.</p>
               <p>SOPHIA remained penſive, and ſighed after the travelling Lieutenant.</p>
               <p>I examined the little library for a book to entertain her. CHESTERFIELD was there, but I did not think it a proper book to read, as I would wiſh to keep the maxims as far out of the ſight of a female as poſſible: for when a woman is <hi>told the ſecret</hi> of her ſeduction, ſhe will naturally be upon her guard againſt the ſeducer; and, really, STANHOPE un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds the art with ſuch perſpicuity, that ſhe who runs may read; nay; even thy
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0377100201:199"/>
footman comprehends the whole ſyſtem, and hath, according to thy account, ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined his woman with a very <hi>tolerable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the by, SEDLEY, I have to accuſe thee of two weak pieces of conduct. The firſt is, thy raſhneſs in truſting the epiſtles of thy Preceptor to the flighty HARRIET, who might have heedleſsly ſhewn them to HORACE, by which means (as thou art a very ſtriking commentary upon the chapters of CHESTERFIELD) he would have had a clue to the original ſources of thy preſent conduct; and a detection of this kind would have been totally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable. Thy other fault is, thy careleſſneſs, and, I might ſay, want of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, in expoſing the volumes which thou ſo pretendeſt to venerate, to the plebeian eyes of thy <hi>valet.</hi> Lock them up, I pray thee, for the time to come; and if
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0377100201:200"/>
thou art reſolved to proceed in reducing them to practice, do it <hi>privately.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In regard to SOPHIA, my endeavours to divert her thoughts <hi>from</hi> the beloved ſubject of their contemplation, were in vain: the Lieutenant mingled in every idea, and ſhe had paſſions, ſighs, ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſenſations, only for Mr. VER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NON. I recited to her an elegy from HAMMOND, and ſhe wept, in the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of her heart, over images ſo amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſo ſimilar to thoſe now ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted by her <hi>own</hi> ſituation. I wiſhed to divert her, by reading to her the od<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of corporal <hi>Trim,</hi> and uncle <hi>Toby:</hi> but ſhe was in no diſpoſition to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with the whimſical ſtrokes of a fine, but irregular wit. I even adverted to the irreſiſtible ſallies of HARRY FIELDING, and diſplayed to her the maſter-piece of narrative, in the laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0377100201:201"/>
ſcene of Parſon ADAMS purſued by the hounds and hunters. She was proof even againſt this, and afforded it only a faint ſmile. She then tried what a walk in the garden would do: ſhe criticiſed the colours of the tulips, and deſcanted with moral delicacy on the pleaſing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of vegetable Nature; but, alas! even here a ſigh would break in upon her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, and very evidently convince me, that Pope was not ſo romantic in the paſtoral ſentiment, which obſerves, <q>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is ſurely death to thoſe who love.</q> In ſhort, SEDLEY, whatever might be the temptation before me, and however aſſiduous I was to gratify it, it was not now the moment to begin the attack; and every-thing I ſaid, only ſerved to ſhew me more plainly, that, if I would wiſh to pleaſe her, it muſt be by talking warmly of a man, whom it was my intereſt to wean from her affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0377100201:202"/>
Perceiving this, I gave way to ſympathy, and moſt cordially united <hi>my</hi> tears to <hi>hers,</hi> and joined in the moſt ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated encomiums on her happy Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. Theſe tears, however, SEDLEY, and thoſe praiſes, gave me a ſoothing ſoftneſs not to be deſcribed, and made me feel a thouſand times more agreeable than while I repreſſed them, in the hope of turning my thoughts to the huſband's diſhonour, and the wife's deſtruction. Is not this, SEDLEY, a parallel caſe to that of thine? If thou wert more happy at doing a <hi>juſt</hi> action to thy bath-maid, than at an <hi>unjuſt</hi> one, by <hi>undoing</hi> the lively HARRIET; I am more happy at having conquered an inclination, which would have tormented my own fancy, tortured a "generous, truſting friend," and agonized the boſom of a woman, whoſe reputation is at preſent unſuſpected, and unpolluted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:0377100201:203"/>Hence then, my dear SEDLEY, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that we are now both exulting in the triumph of a ſimilar ſenſation—a ſenſation created by the ſocial virtues, and derived purely from the felicity of others. Upon this ſubject I have but one point to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve: it is, to <hi>continue</hi> the triumph. Let us even cheriſh a tranſport, which is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to any that diſſimulation can give: let us throw away the perplexing maſk of the caſuiſtical CHESTERFIELD: let us walk in the <hi>right</hi> way, and ſince it hath already <hi>rewarded</hi> us ſo well, let us prefer truth to falſehood, and honeſty to hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy: for, believe me, my dear, dear SEDLEY, under whatever name we may diſtinguiſh vice and virtue, they remain eternally the ſame, and neither ſophiſtry, nor ſubtlety, nor faſhion, nor the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied follies of the mode, can poſſibly pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate the atrociouſneſs of the one, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from the native excellence of the other. PENMEN may puzzle, PHILOSO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHERS
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0377100201:204"/>
may refine, POETS may colour, and viſionaries may ſuggeſt as they pleaſe, but, while the traces of Nature remain, virtue will be fair, and vice deformed; and, in my opinion, that man's maxims are extremely contradictory and fallible, who, in the <hi>ſame volume,</hi> nay, ſometimes in the <hi>ſame epiſtle,</hi> inculcates a delicate regard to <hi>moral</hi> character, and an attack upon thoſe human <hi>weakneſſes,</hi> from the humouring of which (aſſiſted by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per mixture of well-applied flattery) we are to prey upon each other, to prepare ourſelves for deceit, and, if the ſyſtem were general, introduce, by theſe means, even while we ſanctify them, the moſt dangerous deluſions. For my part, SED<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEY, I tell thee again, and again, that I find a flaw in thy STANHOPE, and ſhall read him, for the future, with the eye of a ſevere critic, and not an idolater—not a PHILIP SEDLEY.</p>

                  <hi>LETTER LII. SEDLEY</hi> to <hi>THORNTON.</hi> (Prior to his Receipt of the laſt Letter.)</head>
               <p>THE ceremony has been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. I inſiſted on its being done in the face of the congregation, I gave THOMAS a purſe for his wedding-dinner, and ſo the poor wench is again made an honeſt woman.</p>
               <p>Never heard I panegyrics more warm or better circulated than thoſe reverberated from lip to lip upon this occaſion; and I could almoſt bleſs the fellow for a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery, that hath added ſuch luſtre to my character. I am the very ballad of
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0377100201:206"/>
the bath; and the negligence which I ſeem to pay to the praiſes, only ſerves to increaſe, and make me appear more deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them. But what a ſimpleton I was, in yielding to the baby ſenſation which ſeized me unawares in my laſt. To do good is, indeed, <hi>pleaſing,</hi> and I will on that principle continue to do it as occaſion invites; but Is there not an higher mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, thou wilt ſay, than this?—Is there not <hi>religion?</hi> Pſhaw!—</p>
               <p>Yes, pious THORNTON, there is a higher motive. It flatters the ſenſes, it gratifies vanity, it procures <hi>eclat,</hi> it promotes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, it extends our triumph over a ſex that was born for our amuſement.—The trifling action juſt recorded, backed by a few more that I have not patience to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite, hath made me ſo popular amongſt all ranks of people in this village, from my Lady in her bathing-ſhift, to her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0377100201:207"/>
of the towel, that I defy any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but my own folly to mark me as an object of ſuſpicion.</p>
               <p>I have eſtabliſhed my reputation, THORN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON, upon the ſolid baſis of virtuous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; I have decorated the ſuperſtructure, with the graces of conduct; and now, no man will dare to imagine this goodly edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is but a <hi>whitened</hi> ſepulchre. Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly thou mayſt imagine, that I have earned my pleaſures by difficult adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the STANHOPEAN ſyſtem. No, THORNTON, I have a taſte for them. I do not <q>inflict exceſſes upon myſelf, becauſe I think them genteel,</q> but I find theſe purſuits <q>guard me againſt frivolouſneſs,</q> and prevent me <q>from throwing away upon trifles, that time, which only important things deſerve.</q> In a word, I tell thee once more, I view the Lord of my Idolatry only as a man
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0377100201:208"/>
more ſkilled than myſelf, in the arts of being <hi>truly</hi> happy: and in this light he deſerves my everlaſting gratitude; for he hath taught me <q>to make every place I go to, the ſcene of quick and lively tranſports; to let every company I frequent, gratify my <hi>paſſions;</hi> to know the true value of time; and to ſnatch, ſeize, and <hi>enjoy</hi> every moment of it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Of this enough: the remainder of my letter ſhall be dedicated to the delicious purpoſe of recording ſeveral events, which have fallen out, by the joint effort of deſtiny and contrivance, ſince my laſt.</p>
               <p>I have had a ſecond glance at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate but decaying features of FANNY. Tempted by the chearfulneſs of the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhe ventured, under the ſupporting arms of a huſband, and ſiſter, to walk from her lodgings to the bathing-houſe.
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0377100201:209"/>
She ſaw me, but drew away her eye, and never directed it towards me again. Her huſband bowed to me, as to the polite ſtranger, who had intereſted himſelf ſo much in the welfare of his beloved: the ſiſter inclined her head, and curteſy'd <hi>more</hi> than civilly—it was the bend, rather of attention, than ceremony.</p>
               <p>At this moment, many a lank-haired ſwain, yet humid with the bath, and a cluſter of women, ſtill glowing from the immerſion, appeared in view. They were inſtantly attracted by the meteor, gazed, envied, and paſſed on. Well, indeed, <hi>might</hi> they gaze—well might they envy, THORNTON: the roſe again emulates the lilly, in her cheek; the blue is like the blue of the elements; her arm, is ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated alabaſter; and the hand, to which it belongs, is ſhaped to <hi>inſpire</hi> by its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and <hi>enfever</hi> by its touch.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:0377100201:210"/>After this, as ſhe was preparing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, a ſervant came haſtily to inform Mr. MORTIMER, that Sir HENRY DEL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MORE was arrived. They quickened their pace a little; even FANNY attempted to ſtep briſkly, but failed in the effort. The good Baronet was impatient, and (eager to behold his children) came forward in his boots to meet them.</p>
               <p>Oh, THORNTON, what a figure!—how noble! how venerable! how faſhionable! —But, alas! all ſurprizes, even thoſe of the moſt pleaſing kind, are too much for the feeble ſituation of FANNY. Her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſoon ſaw her confuſion, ſoftened it by a paternal kiſs, and aſſiſted in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing her home to her lodgings. In ſomething leſs than an hour, I received the incloſed; which is the luckieſt inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the world to me, and which, by
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0377100201:211"/>
the time this reaches you, I hope to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove to <hi>ſome purpoſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HARRIET HOMESPUN is fonder of me, and better bred to HORACE, than ever. She has a wonderful aptitude to learn, and will in time be, no doubt, a female STANHOPE. What a lucky thing it is for us, that HORACE hath ſo great an appetite for a long walk by himſelf after dinner! and how infinitely <hi>is</hi> he, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>ought</hi> he to be, obliged to me, for adminiſtering ſo much conſolation to his wife in his abſence!</p>
               <p>Surely, THORNTON, there is nothing ſo grateful as ſerving a friend.</p>

               <p>WHAT can poſſibly be the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of your ſo long ſilence? I now want your advice on a momentous ſubject.</p>
               <p>The time of my ſojourning at this watering-place is expired, my curacy can no longer be deſerted, and I muſt return to it at all events on Saturday, or the duty of the Sabbath muſt be neglected.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding this, Mrs. HOMESPUN
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0377100201:215"/>
again complains of her ancle, and ſays the anguiſh of it is now got higher than her knee; and ſhe is, therefore, reſolved to undergo the operation of pumping up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the part affected, by which means I ſhall be obliged to leave her behind, or elſe bring her away much againſt her own choice; which, notwithſtanding my want of faith as to the knee and ancle, I do not think myſelf entitled to do, ſeeing that ſhe hath demeaned herſelf moſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially. The fact is, ſhe is quite in love with the frivolous pleaſures of this puerile place, in which, were it not for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive and entertaining converſations of my friend SEDLEY, I ſhould not be able to ſupport its cuſtoms. As my wife, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſeems reſolved, I have thought of an expedient to ſupply my abſence for a few days longer. HARRIET hath a friend in our neighbourhood—a Mrs. LA MOTTE—who is a very diſcreet, ſenſible,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0377100201:216"/>
and judicious widow-woman, and who, I am perſuaded, will not only do me the ſervice of paſſing a few days at the bath, but likewiſe urge all the arguments of which ſhe is miſtreſs, to wean the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of her friend from this circle of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and reduce her once more to the ſtandard of common-ſenſe, and the ſerene pleaſures of a country-village.</p>
               <p>I want your council, my dear DOCTOR, on the following ſubject. <hi>Mr.</hi> SEDLEY has applied in my favour to the Biſhop of —, reſpecting the living of —, which is worth near 200l. per annum. <hi>Mr.</hi> SEDLEY is in hourly expectation of a reply to this, and I am already ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with the kindneſſes of this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy gentleman, (who hath done them in a manner peculiar to his character,) that I am in doubt whether I ought to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe a debt it will be ever beyond my
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0377100201:217"/>
ability to diſcharge. HARRIET'S little for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, united to the profits of my curacy, are ſufficient to the purpoſes of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented mind. My parſonage, you know, DOCTOR, is in the very boſom of a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful wood, through which I have been accuſtomed to ramble with a ſocial claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic in my hand; my pariſhioners love me; the little garden is of my own cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; I turned the arch, and twiſted the woodbines around my bower with my own fingers; the birds are protected, and neſt with me in perfect ſecurity; and if I could but once make HARRIET in love with it again, I believe I ſhould not quit it without a ſigh. But one circumſtance weighs with me. I have the dear proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of a ſucceſſor: to <hi>it</hi> I owe an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt I ſhould not feel for myſelf. HAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIET is very far advanced in her preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy. A child, my dear friend, enlarges the wiſhes of a father: a tear is ready to

Under theſe circumſtances thou wilt not expect that I can attend to thy long epiſtolary ſermon, which I herewith re-incloſe thee for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the parſon of thy pariſh, againſt the death of Mrs. ARABELLA, thy gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, when it will afford many admirable hints for the funeral oration of that pious and puritanical old lady.</p>

                  <hi>LETTER LVII.</hi> Miſs <hi>DELIA DELMORE,</hi> to Lady <hi>LUCY SAXBY.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WHAT an additional degree of happineſs do I feel, ſince I laſt wrote to my beloved Lady LUCY? My father is arrived, my ſiſter is recovering, and we are become acquainted with a man whoſe company is at once pleaſing, inſtructive, and various. The very gentleman, my dear LUCY, who hath ſo frequently ſent his polite cards of enquiry concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing FANNY, proves to be a man of birth, rank, and character, and well-known both to <hi>Sir</hi> HENRY, and <hi>Mr.</hi> MORTIMER, when they were laſt ſeaſon at the bath of SCARBOROUGH. He is
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0377100201:222"/>
the moſt well-bred and complaiſant cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter in the world, and has, at the firſt interview, all the eaſe, firmneſs, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embarraſſed air of an old acquaintance. The aſſured, yet modeſt manner with which he preſents himſelf to a company, ſhews plainly that he has been long accuſtomed to faſhionable ſocieties, and would charm you. If FANNY continues to recover, we ſhall be once more a joyful family—my mother is alſo down with us.</p>
               <p>We have taken part of a very elegant houſe, only a ſhort ride from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, about three miles diſtant from BUX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON, and it ſtands upon a ſpot infinitely leſs bleak and barren than the uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable-looking mountains that ſurround the bath. I received the welcome epiſtle, dear LUCY, in which you enjoin me to fill up the interval of abſence, in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence of wiſdom, wit, ſentiment,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0377100201:223"/>
and affection: but does not my fair friend forget that the requiſites to form and to continue ſuch an intercourſe, are not at the command of every ſcribbler, though the partiality of Nature, and the poliſh of high-breeding, may confer them on her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? However, ſince you are ſo earneſt with me, I will pour out my ſoul imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly upon paper, and though I may be wanting in point of elegance, or accuracy, the deficiencies will be compenſated by a frankneſs of mind, and an undiſguiſe of ſentiment, that will pay a better compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to my LUCY'S candour, than all that could poſſibly be beſtowed by the flowers of rhetoric, or colourings of the imagination.</p>
               <p>I the more readily yield to your urgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, my LUCY, as my pen, at this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, can only be the intelligencer of a felicity at once virtuous and endearing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:0377100201:224"/>It is ſaid, indeed, that mankind have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſome fantaſtical and viſionary ſcheme in view. I declare to you, Lady SAXBY, that the perfect reſtoration of FANNY'S health is the only drop that could now be added to the cup of our domeſtic joy. Judge yourſelf! for the viſible alteration of Mrs. MORTIMER for the better, hath put me into ſuch ſpirits, that I cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain my gratitude to the dear perſonages by which thoſe ſpirits are inſpired. Take then, my beloved LUCY, the ſketch of a family-picture, drawn (and yet not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially) by the pencil of a relation.</p>
               <p>The firſt, and principal figure in this group is, a father, whoſe mind is the repoſitory of every virtue—a repoſitory in which he has been, from hour to hour, in the career of almoſt threeſcore years, laying up ſomething valuable, till he hath at length ſtored it with every excellence;
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0377100201:225"/>
with all, LUCY, that can give worth to the huſband, ſoftneſs to the parent, ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity to the friend, benevolence to the neighbour, and humanity to the man: to which is added, a univerſal attention to the wants, and complaints, the fortunes, and morals of that prodigious body of men to which he is related only by ſame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpecies, and the conſcious ties of the chriſtian and fellow-creature.</p>
               <p>The ſecond leading object in the piece is a mother, the model of her huſband; and differing only, by adapting the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly virtues to a delicacy more conſiſtent with the refinement and gentleneſs of the female character, and nature.</p>
               <p>The third figure, to which I would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect your obſervation, is, the ſtill lovely FANNY MORTIMER,—a woman whom even the depredations of four lingering
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0377100201:226"/>
months, paſſed in the languors of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, have not rendered unattracting. To a ſpirit at once wiſe and worthy, ſhe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradds the fineſt politeneſs, gentleneſs uncommon, and meekneſs peculiar to her: and to theſe, again, are joined a taſte ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant and ſimple—an underſtanding en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged and cultivated,—and a face, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance of diſtemper, in which Heaven ſeems to have painted an attribute in every fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: her eye ſparkles benignity, her lips are the temples of truth, her cheeks are the emblems of modeſty veiled in roſes, and her hands were formed by the Graces to the beſt of purpoſes—to charm, by their liberality, the wretched into peace, and to be (conſiſtently with their colour) the pure and beautiful ſtewards of a heart tender as a turtle's, yet ſolid as a ſage's.</p>
               <p>The huſband of this enchanting crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is the brother of Lady SAXBY, the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0377100201:227"/>
very counter-part of his ſiſter, and the very youth whom Sir HENRY DELMORE adopted as the child of his affection, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook for ſeveral years the direction of his education, ſupplied the loſs of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, trained him up for his own, and at laſt gave him, all-accompliſhed, to the only woman that could deſerve him—his <hi>daughter.</hi> His character is recorded in moſt of the European courts; and it is but a mere reverberation of a familiar echo for <hi>me</hi> to ſay, that he has been every where diſtinguiſhed, for bravery without raſhneſs, honour without anceſtral pride, elegance without vanity, affection with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intereſtedneſs, and generoſity without oſtentation.</p>
               <p>Such, LUCY, are the outlines of a pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture now under the eye of your friend. Your abſence, however, and FANNY'S un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain ſtate of health, are the two dark
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0377100201:228"/>
clouds that overcaſt my otherwiſe radiant horizon.</p>
               <p>In ſome meaſure, however, to atone for theſe indiſpenſible drawbacks, I can now promiſe an often-repeated intercourſe, in which, through the kind medium of the poſt, our pleaſures, with thoſe of our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, ſhall be reciprocated—But—in the the name of extravagance, where am I rambling—and what a metaphorical rhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſody am I going to ſend? Let me haſten then to aſſure you, that in all diſpoſitions of mind, I am, with a tenderneſs pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the truth of my attachment,</p>

                  <hi>LETTER LVIII. SEDLEY</hi> to <hi>THORNTON.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE Fates, ſurely, are buſied in contriving matters preciſely as I would <hi>have</hi> them.</p>
               <p>The DELMORE'S are removed to a villa at ſome diſtance from BUXTON, by which means I ſhall be able to prevent oppoſite intereſts from claſhing with each other.—I prithee, THORNTON, mark my policy, to which I have, even at the age of thirty, ſacrificed my <hi>paſſion.</hi> Knowing the little ſcandals and fugitive whiſpers of a water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-place, I practiſed upon myſelf the STANHOPEAN ſelf-denial, and have not been a ſingle minute alone with HAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIET
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0377100201:230"/>
ſince the departure of HORACE. I contrive to call in, either the loquacious landlord, or chattering landlady, and only converſed, in their own way, upon topics too trivial to ſend thee one hundred and ſixty miles; but which anſwered very well my purpoſe: for, ſtrange as it may ſeem to thee, I hold it not good policy, or right reaſon, to have a <hi>tete-a-tete</hi> with a wife, when her huſband is <hi>known</hi> to have left the town; nor am I very well pleaſed with the incautious HARRIET, for ſuffering her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be deſerted, and expoſed to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and <hi>murder</hi> of the moment; for in theſe places, where detraction is a <hi>neceſſary</hi> filler-up of the vacuum,
<q>At ev'ry word a reputation dies.</q>
And I would not be thought a libertine, either in thought, word, or deed, for the univerſe. 'Tis expreſſly, and flagrantly,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0377100201:231"/>
againſt my ſyſtem, which, thou knoweſt, places the very perfection of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the height of human abilities, in "being upon our <hi>own</hi> guard, and yet, by a <hi>ſeeming</hi> natural openneſs, to put peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>off theirs."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, in caſes of amour, it is, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to this principle, abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that a huſband ſhould be upon the premiſes, though not upon the ſpot; otherwiſe there is no poſſibility of avoiding myſtery; and myſtery occaſions ſuſpicion, and ſuſpicion opens a door to detection, and detection ruins me for ever. The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary rake, thou knoweſt, piques himſelf upon this, nay, circulates it at the expence of his truth:
<q>
                     <l>He talks of tranſports that he never knew,</l>
                     <l>And fancies raptures that he never felt.</l>
                  </q>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:0377100201:232"/>
But the pupils of CHESTERFIELD are not ſuch "rude, vain-glorious boaſters." They are to preſerve their moral ſanctity, even in the midſt of (what gownſmen call) vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, not only of good report, but, like the purity of Caeſar's wife, unſuſpected.</p>
               <p>Oh! may this ingenuity and well-acted diſſimulation ever keep me from being blown upon; and, to this end, may I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver withdraw the dear veil that keeps me <hi>apparently</hi> pure, one moment from my heart! May I ever poſſeſs the ingenuous exterior, with the reſerved interior; may I never reject, as troubleſome, or uſeleſs, the maſtery of my temper; and, above all other things, may I always poſſeſs my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf enough to hear, and ſee, every thing, without any viſible change of countenance! May no man living ever be able to decy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher the ſecret of <hi>my</hi> heart; and yet, may
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0377100201:233"/>
I keep the key of every <hi>other</hi> heart in the univerſe: and, to conclude my prayer, let Hypocriſy place before me her ſhield, under which I may fight my fooliſh anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſt, for ever guarded, and for ever victorious!</p>
               <p>And indeed, THORNTON, I perceive, the adroiteſt practice of theſe ſeveral points, ſuggeſted by the matchleſs DORMER, will be ſhortly neceſſary, for never did I enter ſo ſagacious, or ſo uniformly amiable a family as that of the DELMORES.</p>
               <p>The principal of it (Sir HENRY) is ſo acute, ſo adorned, ſo read, ſo experienced, that <hi>he</hi> muſt, I perceive, be deceived with a delicacy even beyond the deceptions of Belial: and I wonder I did not lay my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf open to diſcovery when at SCARBO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ROUGH, at a time that I was a novice in
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0377100201:234"/>
the ways of STANHOPE, and could not be ſuppoſed to <hi>copy him, liberally.</hi> But, my good genius preſerved me, and I engaged the hand of the father, and ſtruck hard upon the tender heart of his daughter.</p>
               <p>Then there's a formidable huſband in my way—no HORACE HOMESPUN—but a man of travel, experience, taſte—A ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſiſter, too—the lively DELIA—a wit, a correſponder, a perfect pen-woman; and, to cloſe the liſt, a venerable matron— wiſe—virtuous—penetrating—the lady pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of this bewitching aſſociation.</p>
               <p>What of that? If they are not verſed (as I <hi>believe</hi> they are not) in my maxims, I may be a match for all of them: paſs like a meteor through this difficult hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere—kindle as I go—and dread no ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diant competitor.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:0377100201:235"/>As to HARRIET—the affair is over: nothing is left even for the exerciſe of my talents: the precept by which I obtained her, has been ſucceſsful in practice: all that remains, is ITERATION. Her fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs grows luxuriant, and ſhe may betray me. To confeſs the truth, THORNTON— I am indifferent to her, and I wiſh HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RACE had her, locked in his arms to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, with all my ſoul.</p>
               <p>At all events, ſhe muſt not entertain ſuch ardent expectations—for—I am ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned elſewhere—a ſcene of greater diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, greater delicacy, and greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, expands itſelf before me—the half-conquered—half-expiring FANNY MORTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MER, who muſt not deſcend unenjoyed by SEDLEY to the earth—The worm, THORN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON, muſt not be ſuffered to riot on her beauties: 'twould be a pity—a profana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0377100201:236"/>
The exquiſite and vivacious DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIA, alſo, attracts my notice. I am called to the combat, and I muſt exert every nerve to <hi>triumph</hi> in the combat, of which the laurels will be trebly precious, ſince I perceive they muſt be earned with all the artillery of manner, addreſs, and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
               <p>In purſuance of theſe objects, I ſhall probably be often animated into the <hi>wiſh</hi> of enjoyments, that, it may be impolitic, to puſh <hi>too far,</hi> till every thing is ripe for the <hi>coup de grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In ſuch exigences, it is difficult to keep the rein in my hand: the warmth of imagination, and an acquaintance with objects, and ſituations, calculated to fire it, ſeem inconſiſtent with the neceſſary coolneſs, and command of my temper.
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0377100201:237"/>
To provide, therefore, againſt theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ardour, I ſhall, if LA MOTTE comes down, retain the enamoured HAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIET in my train, as the agreeable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource from the agitations in which it is likely I ſhall be thrown by the charms, delays, or impediments, of the DELMORES. Poſſibly, too, ſomething may fall out to reduce LA MOTTE, which, be her perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal endowments what they may, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable; becauſe ſhe is prepared to ſuſpect my principles, and therefore will engage my more ſerious attention, till ſhe ſhall have little reaſon to ridicule or laugh at her friend.</p>
               <p>But, on the other hand, if this LA MOTTE does <hi>not</hi> move at the injunction of HORACE, nor at the pretended peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the letter-loving HARRIET, and, by theſe means, HARRIET ſhould be left
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0377100201:238"/>
to herſelf, ſhe muſt abſolutely return to the boſom of the poor pedant, and I will aſſuredly ſacrifice the poſſeſſion of her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to the unblemiſhed ſecurity of <hi>my</hi> cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, which, I am aware, muſt inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably ſuffer by being avowedly the Ciciſbeo of a wife little diſtinguiſhed amongſt the bathers and water-bibbers of faſhion.</p>
               <p>If, indeed, ſhe had been bleſſed with a ſallow damſel for a ſiſter, or a prudent gentlewoman for her aunt, it might have been another matter: but I again repeat it to you, that, in a place like this, in this ſneaking, inquiſitive country of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, it is, to all intents and purpoſes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, for the ſecurity of my ſyſtem, that there ſhould be ſome third perſon in a family, by way of ſcreen; and rather than have our miſtreſſes alone, that is, unprotected by ſome oſtenſible he, or ſhe,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0377100201:239"/>
that is anſwerable for them in the pariſh where they viſit, or where they reſide, it is better for <hi>our</hi> plan of action, that we are ſheltered under the withered wing of a maiden couſin of a century's ſtanding, or even of the great-grandmother herſelf.</p>
               <p>And now, THORNTON, for a word or two on thy own affairs. If thou haſt not, by this time, ſurmounted the ticklings of thy conſcience, and taken poſſeſſion of that tender tenement, which thy friend the Lieutenant left to thee, thou deſerveſt to be for ever diſcarded.</p>
               <p>What! Haſt thou an angel in "earth's mould?" Is ſhe in a wilderneſs of ſweets? Art thou invited by a bed of roſes? Art thou neither in fear of being blaſted by detection, nor of incurring the prattle of a ſingle goſſip of either ſex, (ſeeing that
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0377100201:240"/>
thou art in a retirement perfectly ſhaded by a ſhrubbery of perfumes, and apart from a ſecond houſe), and Is the good man of the houſe gone a long journey into a far country?—Is all this in the way of propitiating thy advances, maſked, as I preſume they would be, in the fine veil of modeſty, manner, and firmneſs, <hi>each</hi> (like co-partners, whoſe intereſt it is to promote common-right in the ſame buſineſs) aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>other?</hi> and Doſt thou, after all, boggle at a ſhadow—a maukin—at con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience?</p>
               <p>Admitting even all thy wiſhes crowned with ſucceſs—where's the miſchief? Thou doſt not deſpoil her: the Lieutenant is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of what is granted, as of what was never attempted. The STANHOPE ſcheme of fruition ſuffers us not to do any <hi>real</hi> injury to individuals <hi>ſingly,</hi> or to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0377100201:241"/>
collectively; we are neither to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray the wife, nor to call the huſband the cuckold we have had the honour to make him, nor to breathe an accent that may lead to the remoteſt ſuſpicion. In ſome caſes, THORNTON, this ſyſtem is of the utmoſt ſervice (under the STANHOPEAN reſtrictions, I mean) both to our King, and country.</p>
               <p>How many puny ſtriplings are there who cannot do the common rights of nuptial juſtice to the unhappy creatures that either intereſt, or folly, has chained them to for life? In that inſtance, it is ours to beſtow as a <hi>favour,</hi> what the huſbands cannot diſcharge as a <hi>duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the other hand, how many miſerable pairs are there, ſighing for an heir to an unweildy eſtate, which muſt, in default of
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0377100201:242"/>
iſſue, devolve to the next fool or driveller in deſcent? There again <hi>we</hi> are patriots of the firſt order: Do we not provide a ſucceſſor, and create a being to inherit all the luxuries of life?</p>
               <p>Nay, even ſuppoſing the huſband en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to provide for himſelf: while our ſyſtem dictates ſo inviolable a <hi>ſecrecy,</hi> while the joys of it are not invaded by <hi>diſtemper</hi> (and they can never be granted without the prior conſent of the wife— and ſuch conſent implies that ſuch variety is neceſſary to her happineſs)—no injury can, in effect, be incurred. His <hi>own</hi> off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring we cannot deſtroy; and <hi>ours</hi> will be conſidered as legitimate, and not be expoſed, like the by-blows of the rake, to the ſcorn, deſertion, and ill-fortunes of baſtardy. So that, view the ſyſtem of CHESTERFIELD on which ſide ſoever you
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0377100201:243"/>
will, it is a ſyſtem of policy, prudence, pleaſure, good-fellowſhip, and right reaſon.</p>
               <p>Great length of paper, and much time, have I ſtolen from more agreeable pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, to illuſtrate this to thee: and if it move thee not, thou art altogether impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrable, and not deſerving ſo ſublime a friend as the <hi>immaculate</hi>
