            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE former Part of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
has been cenſur'd for two
Faults; firſt for being obſcure;
ſecondly, for not being ſo practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
as it ought to be: As to the
Firſt, I anſwer, That <hi>Obſcurity</hi> may be
taken in two Senſes, as Real, or as Relative
to the Underſtanding of the Reader; if
Obſcurity is taken in the firſt Senſe, I will
venture to affirm, That it is unjuſtly blam'd
upon that Account: Perhaps it may not be
all true, but I am ſure it is intelligible. If
Obſcurity is taken in the ſecond Senſe, <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clid</hi>'s
Elements may be ſaid to be obſcure:
I freely own that I had made too partial a
Judgment of the Capacity of ſeveral of my
Readers; and yet it is true, That many, not
bred up in the Profeſſion of Phyſick, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
the Whole; many, a great Part of it;
<pb facs="tcp:0412700800:4"/>
and it was not poſſible to write it down to the
Capacity of every Body.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Fault, of its not being ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
practical, I have endeavour'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair,
by the Addition of this Second Part,
which I was oblig'd to write in haſte, when
the Diſtreſs both of my Mind and Body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
Buſineſs, render'd me very unfit for
ſuch an Undertaking: All I can ſay for it
is, That tho' it be leſs accurate, it may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
be more uſeful than the firſt, it being
much ſuch a Work as an Almanack, of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Benefit, but from which no body I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
ever propos'd any Reputation. It is a
Collection of the ſcattered Precepts of the
Firſt Part, and other new Rules, extended
to the moſt common Diſeaſes as well as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions
of Human Bodies. I have ſtill
follow'd the Method of the learned and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious
<hi>Boerhaave,</hi> who has certainly ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
and taught this Part of the Profeſſion
more than any that ever were before him.</p>
            <p>I cannot think it trifling nor unneceſſary
to treat this Dietetick Part of Medicine
by it ſelf with ſome Accuracy, for the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Reaſons: <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe the Parts
of any Art or Science are often beſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
when they are treated ſeparately: <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
Becauſe the Practitioners in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
and Chirurgery are often fruſtrated in
their Intentions by Errors in Diet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb facs="tcp:0412700800:5"/>
by their Patients, a Misfortune that
I my ſelf have felt ſeveral times, and, as I
ſuppoſe, in common with others of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.
<hi>Thirdly,</hi> Becauſe ſome practical
Rules of this ſort may be uſeful to ſuch as
are remote from good Advice; and likewiſe
to ſome coarſe Practitioners which they are
obliged to make uſe of: By the Methods
preſcrib'd in this ſhort Treatiſe, which are
almoſt within the Reach of every Body, more
Good and leſs Miſchief will be done in acute
Diſtempers, than by Medicines improperly and
unſeaſonably adminiſtred; and great Cures
may be effected in Chronical Diſtempers, by
a proper Regimen of the Diet. I hope I
have done with this Subject. I was drawn
in to write the Firſt Part by Accident, and
to write the Second by ſome Defects in the
Firſt; theſe are the cumberſome Perquiſites
of Authors.</p>

                  <hi>RIGOR, Coldneſs.</hi> A right Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
during the Rigor or cold
Fit in the beginning of a Fever, is
of great Importance, and Miſtakes
of dangerous Conſequence: A long
continued Rigor is a Sign of a
ſtrong Diſeaſe, and is in it ſelf an.
Approach towards Death; during
the Rigor, the Circulation is leſs
quick, and the Blood actually ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates
in the Extremities, and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
upon the Heart creates great
Anxieties, and may produce Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions
about the Heart, and in
other Parts of the Body; therefore a
Rigor increaſeth an Inflammation.
Thoſe who die of Quartan Fevers,
die in the cold Fit; and indeed there
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:0412700800:70"/>
is no Miſchief but what may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from a Rigor of long Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>In ſuch Rigors, all warm Cordials
and ſtimulating Subſtances are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper,
for the firſt acting with
force upon the right Ventricle of the
Heart, may drive the Blood with
too much Force through the Lungs;
and ſtimulating Subſtances, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringing
the Veſſels, often increaſe
the Symptom.</p>
               <p>In ſuch a Rigor, nothing is more
proper than Water, which dilutes and
relaxes at the ſame time, and will
ſooner terminate the cold Fit, and
throw the Patient into a Sweat, than
the warmeſt Cordial; if a very ſmall
Quantity of Rheniſh Wine be mix'd
with the Water, it will be ſtill more
effectual: In this Caſe ſtrong Fric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Extremities relieve.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anxieties.</hi> In Anxieties which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
Fevers, when the cold Fit is
over, a warmer Regimen may be
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:0412700800:71"/>
allow'd; and becauſe Anxieties often
happen by Spaſms from Wind, Spices
are uſeful.</p>
               <p>In thoſe Anxieties, Soapy Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
which diſſolve the Blood, are
indicated; ripe Fruits; ſome of the
lacteſcent Plants, as Lettuce, Endive,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and eſpecially Honey, have this
Quality.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirſt.</hi> In Thirſt attending Fevers,
Liquors ſhould not be drank quite
cold; for cold Liquors, by conſtring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Glands of the Palate and
Throat, do not quench Thirſt ſo
well as Liquors moderately warm:
In this Caſe ſubacid Liquors ſhould be
drank plentifully; all Salts increaſe
Thirſt, except Nitre, and dulcify'd Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Nitre mix'd with Water, is very
proper in this Caſe; ſo are Barley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Water
and Emulſions, except in great
Weakneſs and Flatulencies of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
in which Caſe Water mix'd
with a ſmall Quantity of Rheniſh
Wine, is beſt of all.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="306" facs="tcp:0412700800:72"/>
                  <hi>Sickneſs, Vomiting.</hi> This is one of
the moſt troubleſome Symptoms at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
a Fever, becauſe it renders
the Patient incapable of taking any
thing.</p>
               <p>This Symptom is often prevented
by giving a Vomit; or cur'd by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
the Vomiting for a while by
tepid Water.</p>
               <p>During the Symptom, acid Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors,
and ev'n ſuch as are auſtere
and aſtringent, are indicated, becauſe
ſuch ſtrengthen the Fibres of the
Stomach; and indeed Nature directs
Patients to ſuch a Diet, for they co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet
ſubacid Liquors, and abhor fat
and oily things.</p>
               <p>Diluting, and ſometimes relaxing
the Belly, and carrying the bilious
Salts downwards, often cures this
Symptom.</p>
               <p>Attention is to be given to the
Appetites of Patients, in this and
many other Caſes, who have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
coveted odd things which
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:0412700800:73"/>
have reliev'd them, as Salt, Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Vomiting, from a bilious Cauſe,
is cur'd by ſubacid Liquors; Vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
from ſome putrid Cauſe, by
Salts of all Kinds; in ſuch a Caſe,
Water-Gruel with Cream of Tartar,
Rheniſh Wine and Water, Jelly of
Currants, Marmalade of Quinces,
Sorrel boil'd in Broths well skimm'd
from Fat, are beneficial.</p>
               <p>If the Vomiting comes from a
phlegmatick Cauſe, Spices, and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
things will relieve. The Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſon
muſt be adapted to the Cauſe;
for Example, in Poiſon from Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
Corroſive, and Arſenick.</p>
               <p>In the Firſt, alkaline Subſtances;
in the Second, oily Subſtances are
proper; in both, diluent.</p>
               <p>It is eaſy to judge of the Cauſe by
the Subſtances which the Patient
throws up.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="308" facs="tcp:0412700800:74"/>
Whether Vomit may be ſafely
or properly given, muſt be judg'd
by the Circumſtances; if there be
any Symptoms of an Inflammation
of the Stomach, a Vomit is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
dangerous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wind</hi> and <hi>Spaſms</hi> are occaſion'd by
the feveriſh Heat expanding the ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Particles in the Fluids.</p>
               <p>Whatever is anodyne and quiets
Convulſions, and what abates the
Heat, relieves this Symptom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Weakneſs,</hi> or the Impotence of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing
animal Motion which attends
Fevers, proceeds from too great Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in the beginning, and too great
Inanition in the latter end of the
Diſeaſe; for whatever ſtops or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tards
the Circulation in the ſmalleſt
Veſſels, eſpecially thoſe of the Brain
(which either of theſe Cauſes will do)
produceth this Symptom. Thoſe
two Cauſes demand different Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,
in the firſt emptying and dilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:0412700800:75"/>
in the latter, a more plentiful
Nouriſhment, the uſe of Wine dilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with Water, and Spices in ſmall
Quantities, Jellies, Broths, the alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſcent
Quality of which may be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
with ſome acid, unleſs there
be Signs of Acidity, and in that Caſe
the Diet ought to be contrary to the
Cauſe of the Symptom; Viper-Broth
is both anti-acid and nouriſhing.</p>
               <p>In Debility, from great Loſs of
Blood, Wine, and all Aliment that
is eaſily aſſimulated, or turn'd into
Blood, is proper; Blood is required
to make Blood; a ſmall Quantity of
Blood brings the Patient into danger
of a Dropſy.</p>
               <p>Frictions of the extreme Parts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
Weakneſſes, as they promote
the Flux of the Juices and Spirits in
the Joints and Limbs.</p>
               <p>Fat People are moſt ſubject to this
Symptom of Weakneſs in Fevers,
becauſe the Fat, melted by the fever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
Heat, obſtructs the ſmall Canals,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:0412700800:76"/>
and conſequently produceth this
Symptom. This is evident by the
great Loſs of Fat ſuch People ſuſtain
in Fevers. In the latter end of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
ſuch are weak by the Laxity of
the Fibres, and the Emptineſs of the
ſmaller Veſſels; ſuch therefore muſt
be treated with particular Care, <hi>viz,</hi>
after due Evacuations, diluting
ſtrongly both by Drink and Clyſters,
avoiding all things oily, and uſing
Sugar, Honey, and ripe Fruits.</p>
               <p>Cordials made of ſpirituous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors
are not the beſt Remedies for
this Debility, tho' they increaſe the
Force of the Heart, and are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſometimes to keep up the vital
Functions, they rather coagulate the
Fluid; they add Strength to the Mill,
but congeal the Stream. Whatever
makes the Circulation more free
through the ſmall Veſſels, is a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Heat;</hi> the Degree of which may
be known by the Thermoſcope, the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:0412700800:77"/>
Senſation of the Patient, the Intenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the red Colour of the Urine,
the Sizeneſs of the Blood, the Diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of the fluid Parts, which
renders it thicker; the Hardneſs,
Strength, and Frequency of the
Pulſe, which makes the Friction the
ſtronger, to which the Heat is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portional,
the bad Diſpoſition of the
Humour, and the dry Temperament
of the Body.</p>
               <p>Feveriſh Heat is moderated by
Blood-letting, by muſcular Reſt, by
moderate Ligatures which compreſs the
Veins only, and often removed from
Joint to Joint, by a mechanical Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
retard the Circulation; of ſuch
ſort is dry Cupping, bathing the
lower Parts, watery Liquors for Drink,
not cold, but tepid; ſubacid, as Jel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of Currants diſſolved in tepid wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
Liquors; Decoctions of mealy
Subſtances acidulated, Subſtances a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodyne,

the ſimple Oxymel, often uſed by
<hi>Hippocrates,</hi> plentiful diluting, and
reſtoring as much Water to the Blood
as is diſſipated by the Heat; all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulcent
and relaxing Subſtances,
cooling the Air in the Room, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Curtains, and removing too
thick Bed-clothes; all ſtimulating and
ſlyptick Subſtances to be avoided, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they increaſe the Force of the

               <p>
                  <hi>Delirium.</hi> Too great Alacrity and
Promptneſs in Anſwering, eſpecially
in Perſons naturally of another Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
is a Sign of an approaching De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirium:
In a feveriſh Delirium there
is a ſmall Inflammation of the Brain;
therefore any thing which increaſeth
the Circulation in the lower Parts,
and diminiſheth the Preſſure on the
Brain, is beneficial, as immerging
the Feet in warm Water; nothing
relieves the Head more than the
Piles, therefore Suppoſitories of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
Aloes, and Rock-Salt, ought
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0412700800:79"/>
to be try'd, relaxing by emollient

the Tenacity of the Fluids circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

by the Fever, obſtruct the
ſmall Canals of the Brain: In young
People it commonly proceeds from
Fulneſs, and is beſt cur'd by letting
Blood, and relaxing the Belly. The
Sign of ſuch a Fulneſs is, a red
Countenance, and Eyes inflamed; if
it proceeds from a glutinous Oil, it
ought to be attempted to be reſolv'd
by Water, nitrous Salts, Soaps, and
ſubacid Liquors.</p>

Convulſions ariſing from ſome

very dangerous.</p>
               <p>Convulſions which ariſe from great

attending Fevers, are dangerous.</p>
               <p>Convulſions ariſing from Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
of the Membranes of the

Symptoms attending them are a

<pb n="317" facs="tcp:0412700800:83"/>
in that Caſe, Subſtances which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lax

ſuch as open the Belly; which, <hi>See

                  <hi>Violent Sweats</hi> proceed from a

a Circulation of the Blood.</p>
               <p>Profuſe Sweats deprive the Blood
of its moſt fluid Parts, thicken, and

good Practice to puſh Sweating too

               <p>In profuſe Sweats, Care at leaſt
ſhould be taken, by diluting, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
the Liquid which the Blood
loſeth, and to uſe the Methods ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed
in too great Heat, by taking
away ſome of the Coverings of the
Bed, and admitting of cool Air,
and uſing a Diet moderately aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent;
Wine, Spices, and ſpirituous
Liquors, in this Caſe, have often a
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:0412700800:84"/>

                  <hi>A Diarrhoea Looſeneſs</hi> proves often a
dangerous and fatal Symptom in Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
it weakens, excoriates and inflames
the Bowels, occaſions Bloody-Fluxes,
thickens the circulating Juices, and
exhauſts the Strength of the Patient;
notwithſtanding, a critical Diarrhoea
is not to be ſtopt, for fear of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
theſe Dangers.</p>
               <p>Attention is to be given to the
Cauſe of Acidity; it is to be cur'd
by Anti-acids; but, as in Fevers, the
Cauſe is more frequently alkaline and
bilious, Acid or four things reſolve,
and it happens that oily Subſtances
by blaſting the Acrimony will do
good in Diarrhoeas. Oily Subſtances
of themſelves do not irritate or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
Diarrhoeas, they only lubricate
or make the Bowels ſlippery. Diar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoeas
ariſing from Quantities of Fruit
are often cur'd by Emulſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:0412700800:85"/>
Vomiting, by evacuating the irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
Cauſe, often cures ſuch Diar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoeas.</p>

                  <hi>Inflammatory Eruptions.</hi> In all
theſe of any kind whatſoever, as
Small-Pox, Meazles, Scarlet Fever,
Purples, the Intention in Diet
ought to be, to avoid ſtrong Sudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rificks,
which puſh out too great a
Quantity of the Matter upon the
Skin; to uſe cooling and temperate
Diluents, which keep the Matter flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>id
and moveable, ſo that it may be
ſecern'd from the Blood; to keep
warm during the Eruption; and that
then Diet be cool; for which Reaſon
the moderate Uſe of Acids, as Juice
of Limon, is indicated.</p>
               <p>A due Attention to the few Rules
above-mention'd, in the ſeveral Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms,
will prove very ſucceſsful in
the Cure of moſt Fevers. I ſhall
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:0412700800:86"/>
only add a few more according to
the various Kinds of Fevers and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory
Diſtempers.</p>
               <p>An Ephemera, or a Fever of one
Day, is cur'd by Abſtinence, Reſt,
and Diluting; and the ſame Method
will prove effectual if the Fever laſts ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Days, and is not putrid, or attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a greater Inflammation and
Acrimony, and Obſtruction of the
Veſſels in ſome Parts of the Body,
amongſt which is what is commonly
call'd, a Cauſus, or burning Fever.</p>
               <p>The Cauſes of ſuch a Fever are
various; Errors in the Non-Naturals,
Air, Meat and Drink, Reſt and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Such a Fever will be rais'd by
Vehement Exerciſe or Labour, Heat
of the Sun, by long Thirſt, by the
immoderate Uſe of fermented and
ſpirituous Liquors; and hot things,
as Spices; and by great Laſſitude en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured
any way, eſpecially in hot
Weather.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="321" facs="tcp:0412700800:87"/>
Its Symptoms are a burning Heat
in the Skin, a Senſation of extreme
Heat inwardly; ſometimes Coldneſs
in the extreme Parts; Dryneſs of
the Skin, Mouth, and Noſtrils;
a Dryneſs and Roughneſs of the
Tongue; laborious and ſhort breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
great Thirſt; Loathing, Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Stomach, and Vomiting;
Anxiety, Reſtleſneſs, Wearineſs; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a Cough and Hoarſeneſs; Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
and Delirium, and Exacerba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
every other Day.</p>
               <p>Such a Fever is often reſolv'd by
a bleeding at the Noſe, which ought
not to be ſtop'd unleſs it endangers
Life. It is likewiſe often in the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Day reſolv'd by Sweating, Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting,
Looſeneſs, and Spitting of
thick Phlegm. The fatal Signs are
commonly bloody Urine, Difficulty
of Swallowing, watery Sweats about
the Head and Face, without Relief;
Coldneſs of the Extremities, Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
too great a Looſeneſs; and
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:0412700800:88"/>
ſometimes an Inflammation of the
Lungs.</p>
               <p>The Regimen, in ſuch a Fever, is
keeping the Air of the Room pure
and cool, untainted with Fire, Smoke,
or the Breaths of many People; they
ought to have no more Bed-clothes
than barely protects them from Cold;
their Curtains ought to be kept open
ſo as to renew the Air; and their
Poſture in lying, as erect as they
can bear; the Sick, in this Condition,
covet all theſe things, and their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries
offend them.</p>
               <p>Their Drink ought to be cool, mild,
ſubacid, tepid, given in moderate
Quantities, and often, as Water
with Juice of Limon or Tama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinds.</p>
               <p>Their Aliment ought to be light,
of farinaceous Vegetables, as Water-Gruel,
Preparations of Barley, with
ſome Juice of Limon; Rice boil'd in
Whey, and ſtrain'd. Roaſted Apples
in the Progreſs of the Diſeaſe; a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:0412700800:89"/>
toaſted Bread with Rheniſh Wine
and Water, Jelly of Currants; Broths
and Jellies made of animal Subſtances
are rather too alkaleſcent, at leaſt they
ought to be qualify'd with Juices of
Limon, or ſome acid.</p>
               <p>Sometimes ſuch alimentary Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
as gently ſtimulate the Belly,
are uſeful, as ſome ripe Fruits, Straw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries,
Currants, Mulberries.</p>
               <p>The Symptoms increaſe by the
Uſe of hot things given either as Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or Medicine.</p>

               <head>Intermitting Fevers.</head>
               <p>They are (at leaſt in this Country)
very obſtinate, often return in ſpite
of all Remedies, and by long Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
they degenerate into Hepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Fevers, and many chronical Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers,
as Jaundice, Dropſy, Schir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus's,
and Scurvies; therefore in this
Diſeaſe a right Method, both of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
and Diet, is of great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:0412700800:90"/>
There is a great Variety in
theſe Diſeaſes, as to the Intervals of
Times between the Paroxyſms; Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
ſometimes redouble their Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xyſms,
ſo as to appear like Quotidians.
I think it may be taken as a general
Rule, That the greater Diſtance of
Time there is between the Paroxyſms,
the Fever is leſs dangerous, but more
obſtinate.</p>
               <p>There is a different Regimen to
be us'd during the Continuance and
Abſence of the Paroxyſm; and in the
Paroxyſm itſelf, during the Rigor or
cold Fit, the Heat and the Sweat.</p>
               <p>During the Rigor, the Regimen
preſcrib'd in the foregoing Part of
this Chapter, in the Article of Fever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
Rigors, is proper in all Fevers,
and Care is to be taken by all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Methods to ſhorten that Period as
much as poſſible, and by tepid Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luents
to bring on the Sweat ſoon,
but not to puſh it beyond its due
Meaſure, becauſe an intermitting Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:0412700800:91"/>
relaxeth and weakens the Body
extremely.</p>
               <p>Between the Paroxyſms, too great
Abſtinence is hurtful as much as too
great Repletion; as intermitting Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
are often of long Continuance,
extreme Abſtinence is impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and would reduce the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
to a Condition not to be able
to ſuſtain the Shock of the next At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack.</p>
               <p>Between the Paroxyſms, ſuch Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
as temper, correct, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
the bilious Alkali, as acid Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
nitrous Salts, ſmall thin
Wines with Water, Chicken Broth with
Juice of Limons; Wine with Bitters
infuſed, are proper; Cichory and
Dandelion are uſeful, becauſe the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd

                  <pb n="326" facs="tcp:0412700800:92"/>
Exerciſe, to as great a degree as
the Patient can bear, is extremely
beneficial between the Paroxyſms.</p>
               <p>But the chief Remedy of all is to
endeavour to prevent the cold Fit,
by getting to Bed, by Frictions, and
ſome ſudorifick and warm Liquor;
for by putting off the cold Fit ſome
Agues have been cur'd.</p>
               <p>Letting of Blood ſeldom does
good, and often a great deal of Hurt

of the Patient is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd

Cool Air, and Sitting up, if

                  <p>The Mouth and Throat muſt be

                  <p>Such may happen either in the

There are coagulating Poiſons

extreme violent Paſſions, by affecting

critical Reſolution, Concoction, and
Evacuation of the morbifick Matter,
which is either attenuated ſo as to
be return'd into the Channels, and
to go on in the common. Thread
of Circulation, or expectorated by
Coughing, which may be eaſily
known by the Abatement of Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Fever, Difficulty of
Breathing, Thirſt, Anxiety, Reſtleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and the Patient's falling into
gentle breathing Sweats. One of the
beſt Reſolvents is the Blood of the
wild Goat.</p>
                  <p>Copious Bleeding is the moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
Remedy in the beginning of
the Diſeaſe; but when the Expecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
goes on ſucceſsfully, not ſo
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:0412700800:101"/>
proper, becauſe it ſometimes ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
it, and in that Caſe Sudorificks
thicken the Matter that is expectora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
The Motions of Nature ought
to be followed. This by the way.</p>
                  <p>From the Symptoms in this Stage
of the Diſeaſe, and the uſe of the
Lungs, it is evident the Aliment
ought to be more ſlender and thin
than in any other inflammatory Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe
whatſoever, common Whey be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſufficient to preſerve the Strength
of the Patient; watery Liquors, and
even the Steam of warm Water ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in by the Breath, attenuates the
impacted Matter. Relaxing Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
of which Barley and all its
Preparations are the beſt.</p>
                  <p>In this State, Diureticks, which
have not much Acrimony in them,
are proper, for Fluxes of Urine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Lungs; for this Intention,
an Infuſion of Fenel Roots in warm
Water, with Milk, is good, both as
Nouriſhment and Drinks.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="336" facs="tcp:0412700800:102"/>
If Nature relieves by a Diarrhoea,
without ſinking the Strength of the
Patient, it is not to be ſtopt, but
promoted gently by emollient Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</p>
                  <p>Decoction of Cichory, Lettuce,
as being anodyne and reſolvent, are
proper.</p>
                  <p>If the Patient is not reliev'd nor
dies in eight Days, the Inflammation
ends in a Suppuration and an Abſceſs
in the Lungs, and ſometimes in ſome
other Part of the Body; the Symptoms
of which are, an obſtinate dry Cough,
increas'd by Motion and taking of
Food; theeaſieſt Poſture in Lying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the affected Side; a continual
Lent-Fever, with Rigors invading with
uncertain Periods; Exacerbations af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Motion and Repaſt, Thirſt, Night-Sweats,
a frothy Urine, Paleneſs,
Leanneſs, Weakneſs.</p>
                  <p>In ſuch a Caſe one muſt forbear
letting of Blood. The Diet muſt
be mild, ſoft, incraſſating, and more
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:0412700800:103"/>
plentiful; tepid Vapours admitted
into the Lungs, of Decoctions of
proper Ingredients; and when by the
Symptoms and Time the Impoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hume
may be judg'd to be ripe, the
Vapour of Vinegar it ſelf, and any
thing which creates a Cough, as
Oxymel, or Vinegar and Honey,
Exerciſe and Concuſſion are proper,
the ſooner it is broke, the leſs Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to the Lungs.</p>
                  <p>Tho' ſuch a State is extremely dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
it is not quite deſperate; the
Aliment ought to be Milk; the
Drink, Milk, and Barley-Water, and
ſuch alimentary Subſtances as are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectorating
and cleanſing, with gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Anodynes, that the Patient may
have ſome Reſt. <hi>See</hi> Chap I.</p>
                  <p>The principal Intention in every
State of Inflammation of the Lungs
is to promote Expectoration, and to
reſtore it when it is loſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="338" facs="tcp:0412700800:104"/>
If the Inflammation ends in a
Gangrene, the Caſe is deſperate; if
in a Schirrus, incurable.</p>
                  <p>There is a ſpurious ſort of a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripneumony,
not inflammatory; when
the Veſſels are obſtructed with a viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous
Pituite that mixeth with the
Blood, and invades in cold Weather,
it is dangerous, and often ſuffocates;
it is incident to weak and old Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
In this, ſome of the Methods
uſed in the Inflammatory are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
but not ſo copious Bleeding,
Clyſters frequently injected; Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
more generous, Broths, and
Jellies with Juice of Limon, Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel,
or Honey and Water; for
Drink, ſoft Oils, and Aliments which
abound with a ſoft, not volatile Oil,
are beneficial.</p>
                  <p>A Peripneumony is the laſt fatal
Symptom of every Diſeaſe, for no
Body dies without a Stagnation of
the Blood in the Lungs; as long as
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:0412700800:105"/>
it circulates through the Lungs, it
will circulate through the reſt of the
Body. The total Extinction of
Breath is caus'd by the Stagnation of
Blood in the Lungs.</p>

                  <p>Some of the beſt Cautions in Diet

                  <p>Which, beſides the general Cauſes
of Inflammations, are extreme Fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
Fat diſſolv'd by Heat and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations
obſtructs the Veſſels of

Eroſions, by the Acrimony of the

ſuddenly chill'd by cold Air, cold

great Heat; Vomits given injudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly,
when the Liver is already

                  <p>In ſuch a Caſe, the Liver being

                  <p>Coffee-colour'd Urine is not a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous

from a Mixture of a ſmall Quantity
of Blood with the Urine, but often

a more laſting and dangerous Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>After plentiful Bleeding, and a

Its Symptoms are a ſpontaneous

livid Colour of the Countenance;

Theſe Symptoms proceed from an

thick or too thin, being of a ſaline
Conſtitution, either from an acid,
alkaline, or muriatick Cauſe, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Cauſe, demands very

               <p>The Scurvy of Mariners is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
cured by Acids, as all ſorts of
ripe Fruits, Limons, Oranges, Butter-Milk;
alkaline Spirits hurt them;
and acid Spirits, as that of Salt,
does them good; when the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
are attended with a Foetor of
any kind, either in the Urine, Mouth,
Breath, with Drought, Heat, Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrage
of the Gums, or of any

If the Scurvy be entirely muria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
proceeding from a Diet of
ſalt Fleſh or Fiſh, the Vegetables
commonly called Antiſcorbutick, as
Water-creſſes, Scurvy-Graſs, and
Brook-Lime may be given with Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
but tempered with Acids, as
the Juice of Oranges and Limons;
and the Pot-Herbs which are anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acid

but if there be a high degree of
Heat and Inflammation, the hot An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſcorbuticks

It is often preceded by a Spitting
of Blood, occaſion'd by its Acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and too great a projectile Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
with Slenderneſs and Weakneſs
of the Veſſels; to which Perſons of
a fair roſy Complexion, long Neck,

Aliment too viſcous, obſtructing the
Glands, and by its Acrimony cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roding
the ſmall Veſſels of the Lungs
(an Organ of a ſlender Texture,
through which the Half of the whole
Blood paſſeth, and which is never at
reſt) after a Rupture and Extravaſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Blood, eaſily producing an
Ulcer, then a ſmall Fever, dry Cough,
Heat, Fluſhing after Repaſt; when
the new Chyle enters the Lungs,
ſhort Breath, a Diſpoſition to Sweat
after Sleep; all theſe Symptoms,
when the Blood is moſt copious and
hot, between the Ages of 16 and
30; ſuch a Diſeaſe may be indue'd
by the Suppreſſion of Evacuations
natural and artificial, by any great
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:0412700800:150"/>
Force upon the Lungs, from ſome
accidental Cauſe; by too hot, full,
and acrimonious Meat or Drink, by
ſome acute Diſeaſe, the Meazles or
Small-Pox.</p>
               <p>The Blood is ejected from the
Lungs with ſome ſmall Pain, Heat,
Oppreſſion on the Breaſt, florid, and
frothing, with ſhort Breathing, and
a ſmall ſoft quick Pulſe.</p>
               <p>If after ſuch Haemorrage from the

a Cough, hectick Fever, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
Rigours and Chillineſs invading
irregularly, with Weakneſs, one may
be ſure that there is a Suppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>In a Haemorrage from the Lungs,
no Remedy ſo proper as Bleeding,
often repeated; Stypticks are often
inſignificant, and if it were poſſible
that they could operate immediately
upon the affected Part, ſo far as
to make a Scar, when that fell off
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:0412700800:151"/>
the Diſeaſe would return. Both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſſating
and ſtyptick Subſtances
work univerſally, but they would
hurt the Lungs if given before the
Veſſels are empty'd. Balſamick Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
often hurt by their too great
Heat.</p>
               <p>The Intention here is by Diet to
abate the Acrimony and projectile
Motion of the Blood, after repeated
Bleeding; to keep ſtrictly to a Milk
Diet, with farinaceous Subſtances, as
Rice and Barley, Milk with roaſted
Apples, Jelly of Currants, or the
Jelly of any ripe ſubacid Fruit, which
is cooling, and very agreeable to
the Stomach; Milk and common
Water, or Barley-Water, for Drink,
taking the Aliment frequently, and
in very ſmall Quantities, for fear of
charging the Lungs with too great
a Quantity of Chyle at a time. (<hi>See

of ſuch a Diſeaſe any Subſtance
which is deobſtruent, without much
Acrimony, is beneficial, but what
heats diſpoſeth to Suppuration.</p>
               <p>There is likewiſe a Conſumption
from an Empyema, after an Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the Lungs, which may
be known from a Weight upon the
Diaphragm, Oppreſſion of the Lungs,
a Difficulty of Breathing, and Ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
to lie on one Side (which is
that which is found) a perpetual
Cough and Fever, with Thirſt, Fluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Cheeks, Weakneſs, and
Decay of Appetite.</p>
               <p>The Cure of ſuch a Caſe is chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgical,
by opening the Side; if the
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:0412700800:153"/>
Ulcer is not broke, it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
call'd a Vomica, attended with
almoſt the ſame Symptoms as an
Empyema, becauſe the Vomica com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
with the Veſſels of the
Lungs muſt neceſſarily void ſome of
the putrid Matter into theſe Veſſels,
and taint the Blood.</p>
               <p>The Ulcer may break ſuddenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Larynx, with the danger of
Suffocation; or inwardly, and the
Matter may by degrees be expectora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
The Event of the Diſeaſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
upon the Symptoms, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the Nature of the Pus; that
which ſwims in Water, without any
ill Smell, is better than what ſinks,
is livid, and ſmells of putrify'd
Fleſh.</p>
               <p>There may be a Conſumption
with a purulent Spitting, when the
Vomica is contain'd in a Cyſt or
Bag, upon the breaking of which
the Patient is commonly ſuffocated.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="388" facs="tcp:0412700800:154"/>
In this Caſe the ſame Intentions
muſt be purſued in the Diet, as in
a Wound or any other Ulcer. The
Aliment cool, demulcent, vulnera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and not drying or hot, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
of Quantities of liquid things,
even though they provoke Sweat. It
is a common Miſtake that acid things
hurt the Lungs. The Gas Sulphuris
may be given with Succeſs in any
Diſeaſe of the Lungs, but at ſome
diſtance of Time from Milk, Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
and Honey, is proper and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent;
anodyne Subſtances relieve the
Cough; gentle Exerciſe by Riding,
is beneficial; by an extremely exact
Regimen a conſumptive Perſon may
hold out for Years, if the Symptoms
are not violent.</p>
               <p>The Sweats and Diarrhoea attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Conſumptions are generally fatal
Symptoms, but muſt be reliev'd by

               <p>The moſt common Cauſes of it

ſudden chilling of the Feet after
Sweat, or drying them at the Fire
after being wet and cold; a ſeden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Life, with a plentiful Diet, and
intenſe Study, and Application of the
Mind; moſt commonly a Gouty
Conſtitution is attended with great
Acuteneſs of Parts, the nervous Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres
both in the Brain and the other
Extremities being delicate; and there
are Inſtances where Wives have got
it from their Husbands by Infection,
ſo <hi>Boerhaave</hi> ſays; Females and young
People are not ſubject to this Diſeaſe,
unleſs where it is hereditary.</p>
               <p>A proper Regimen of Diet is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
in this Diſtemper, becauſe it
does not admit of very many Helps
from Medicines, and there are no
better Rules than Abſtinence from
thoſe things which occaſion it.</p>
               <p>It ſeems to be a Diſeaſe of the
nervous Parts, which makes it ſo hard

more remote in the Thread of the

Motion of the Fluids, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant

it looks as there were regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Accumulations and Gatherings of
it, as of other Humours in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
growing perhaps in ſome People
as Corns.</p>
               <p>As one of the Cauſes of the Gout
is the Suppreſſion of Sweat and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration,
the procuring a due de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree

Perſpiration.</p>
               <p>Violent Purging, in Abſence of
the Paroxyſm, by agitating the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
often hurts, and during the
Paroxyſm, may draw the Gout in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly.</p>
               <p>The beſt Diet is Abſtinence from
acid Subſtances; the moderate uſe of
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:0412700800:165"/>
ſuch as promote Perſpiration, as Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
aromatical, and volatile Salts,

make the Body perſpirable; diluent
Liquors, taken in ſuch a degree as
not to hurt the Stomach; Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the Quantity of Food and

making the Feet ſweat, and much
Sleep.</p>
               <p>In the Paroxyſm, as temperate
and cool, and diluent a Diet as the
Patient can bear; Abſtinence from
Opiats, except when the morbid
Matter is ſeparating (by Opiats any

It is of the utmoſt Importance to
know if any Diſeaſe proceeds from
a Tranſlation of the Gouty Matter;
for the Methods, eſpecially Evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations,
us'd in an original Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,
would be very improper in a
Gouty Caſe, where the Intention muſt
be to draw the Gout down to the
Feet, by Bliſters apply'd to the Thighs
or Legs, and acrid inflammatory Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taplaſms
and Plaiſters; therefore when
any Gouty Perſon is diſappointed of
a Paroxyſm which he expected by
the Seaſon, or the previous Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms,
and inſtead of it is ſeiz'd with
another Diſeaſe, let him ſpeedily
conſult his Phyſician.</p>
               <p>If a Gouty Perſon can bring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

               <p>The Approach of a Fit of the

               <p>Infants new-born, before they
have taken any Aliment, often have
the whole alimentary Duct filled
with a glutinous cheeſy Matter, and
all of them have a Meconium, or
ſort of dark-colour'd Excrement in
the Bowels, which ought to be
purg'd off.</p>
               <p>Moſt of the Diſeaſes of ſuckling
Infants proceed from Milk growing
ſour and curdling in the Stomach;
the Cure of which is to be effected
<hi>Firſt,</hi> By attenuating this curdy Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and <hi>Secondly,</hi> by expelling it
out of the Body; it may be digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Infant by Abſtinence from
Sucking for ſeveral Hours; Honey
and Water, with a little Wine, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate
and diſſolve; and ſome gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
purging Syrup, as Syrup of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chory

Infants; Clyſters and warm Fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
and other Applications of
aromatical Subſtances to the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
and Belly, are uſeful in this
Caſe.</p>
               <p>Antiacids, eſpecially the Abſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bents,

               <p>Opiats and anodyne Subſtances are

               <p>When Children begin to feed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Subſtances on which Infects de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
their Eggs, eſpecially Fruits,
they are often troubled with Worms,
for want of a ſufficient Force of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion
to deſtroy theſe Eggs.</p>
               <p>The moſt common Sort in Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are the round or Earth-Worms.</p>
               <p>The Symptoms occaſion'd by the
Motion and Biting of theſe Worms
are Loathing as it were from a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the Throat, a Vomiting,
Looſeneſs, Fainting, a feveriſh Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
with a ſmall quick pulſe,
Itching of the Noſe, Grinding of
the Teeth, Fits, Paleneſs, a craving
Appetite, Weakneſs, and when the
Worms are large they conſume the

Moiſture, and inſtead of Looſeneſs
will occaſion Aſtriction of the Belly,
with a Swelling; Worms will perfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

               <p>Children ſubject to Worms ought
not to live much upon Milk, Cheeſe,

ſome Inſects lay their Eggs in

alimentary Subſtances; Honey
and Oil given by the Mouth, or
Clyſters, have a good Effect; they
may be taken together faſting; any

Above a tenth Part of Infants
die in Teething, by Symptoms pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from the Irritation of the
tender nervous Parts of the Jaws,
occaſioning Inflammations, Fevers,
Convulſions, Looſeneſs, with green
Stools (not the worſt Symptom) and
in ſome, Gangrenes: It is plain that
ſuch a Caſe ought to be treated
as any other inflammatory Diſtemper.</p>
               <p>When the Symptoms of Teeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
appear, the Gums ought to be
relax'd by ſoftening Ointment, the
Jaws fomented with emollient De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions,
and the whole Head to be
kept warm; when the Teeth is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to cut, the upper Part rubb'd
with hard Subſtances, which Infants
by a natural Inſtinct affect, and
when there is a manifeſt Tenſion
of the Gum by the Tooth, then it
ought to be cut; but this Operation
ought not to be perform'd too ſoon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="409" facs="tcp:0412700800:175"/>
In the Convulſions it is neceſſary
to give volatile Spirits, which they
can bear better than when they are
new-born.</p>
               <p>The Rickets is another Diſeaſe to
which Children are ſubject: It has
been reckoned a Diſeaſe unknown
to the Ancients, uncommon in hot
Countries, and more common in
<hi>England</hi> than any other Northern
Country.</p>
               <p>Children have this Diſeaſe from
ſickly Parents, and eſpecially from
Mothers of a weak lax Conſtitution,
living on a various, high, and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
Diet, without Exerciſe; and
Children born healthy, often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
the Diſeaſe from an unwholſome
Nurſe.</p>
               <p>A Diet of farinaceous Subſtances
infermented, as of Pudding, much
Butter, wet or ill-air'd Linen, cuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
Eruptions repell'd, or ill cur'd,
expoſing their lower Parts too long
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:0412700800:176"/>
to cold Air, may bring, or at leaſt
increaſe this Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>The Diſeaſe may be foreſeen by
the Child's being long in taking to
his Feet; when it takes place the
Child grows lean, the muſcular Fleſh
decays, and grows flabby, the Skin
looſe and flaccid, the Epiphyſes of
the Bones about the Joints of the
Arms grow big, the Belly ſwells, the
Blood-Veſſels about the Neck en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large,
and ſo does the Head it ſelf,
the Bones grow crooked; theſe are
the outward Appearances, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of the inward Parts is often
much worſe.</p>
               <p>It is highly probable that this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
proceeds from a redundant Aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
becauſe Vinegar will ſoften and
crook tender Bones; and this Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
muſt happen in Children when
there is no Strength in the Muſcles
to ſupport them, or they muſt be
inflected to that Side where the
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:0412700800:177"/>
Muſcle pulls ſtrongeſt. Contrary to
the common Rules for the Aliment
of Children, the Diet of thoſe that
are Rickety ought to be moderately
warm, even making uſe of Spices
or carminative Seeds. They ought
to forbear unfermented farinaceous
Subſtances, new Bread; and rather
uſe Biſcuit. Their Diet ſhould be
pretty much of fleſh Meat, ſuch as
are commonly call'd White Meats,
and rather roaſted than boil'd, ſuch
Diet being anti-acid. They may
be allow'd a moderate Quantity of
Wine.</p>
               <p>I knew a rickety Child cur'd by
a very great Indulgence of fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Liquors, but it is not an Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

               <p>Frictions of the Back-bone and
Joints with Flannel, ſmoak'd with pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating

fomenting the Joints with old Malaga
Wine, have prov'd often very effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.</p>

                  <pb n="412" facs="tcp:0412700800:178"/>
They ought to uſe as much Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe

by Voiture or Carriage. Care
muſt be taken to open the Obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the lower Belly by Vomits
and proper Purgations, where the
Seat of the Diſeaſe chiefly lies, and
after that the Cold Bath is a very
proper and effectual Remedy.</p>

               <p>In general, young Perſons who
have not had the Diſeaſe ought to
be extremely careful to avoid great
Irregularities in their Diet, becauſe
the Small-pox which are occaſion'd
by ſuch often prove dangerous.
This Diſeaſe is likewiſe more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
as the Fluids are more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
and diſſipated, and the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids
more ſtrict and compacted, and
conſequently more ſo as People are
advanc'd in Age.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="414" facs="tcp:0412700800:180"/>
This Diſeaſe may be eaſily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
by the Contagion or
Steams of an infected Perſon ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
in the Air, and drawn in by
the Breath, or perhaps by the Pores
of the Skin; and it is evident by
Inoculation that the ſmalleſt Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Matter mix'd with the
Blood produceth the Diſeaſe, tho'
not ſo quickly as thoſe volatile
Steams.</p>
               <p>The firſt Symptoms are a Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
Rigor, ſucceeded by a Fever
and conſtant Heat, a certain Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
or Shining in the Eyes, with a
little moiſture; this is very obſervable
in Children; a great Pain in the
Head, with Dulneſs, Drowſineſs,
Sleepineſs, a pain in the Back in
ſome, but Pains in the Limbs in all,
Anxiety, Inquietude, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Drowſineſs, Loathing,
Sickneſs of the Stomach, Vomiting,
and in Infants Convulſions ſhortly
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:0412700800:181"/>
before the Eruption. The Blood let
the firſt time, florid; after a ſecond
time ſizy.</p>
               <p>It is evident that in this State the
Diſeaſe ought to be treated as any
other inflammatory Diſtemper, by
ſuch Methods as if it were poſſible
to hinder any Suppuration at all,
and to reſolve and digeſt as much
of the feveriſh Matter as we can;
for the longer the Eruption is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and the ſmaller when it comes,
the Diſeaſe is leſs dangerous; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all the Methods prractis'd in
the beginning of inflammatory Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes
are here neceſſery, with a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Care of cleanſing the ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
Duct by Vomiting and
Clyſters, the Impurities of which
will be carried into the Blood.</p>
               <p>There is not yet found any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Antidote to the poiſonous
Stimulus of this Diſtemper; the
learned <hi>Boerhaave</hi> is of opinion,
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:0412700800:182"/>
that if any ſuch could be found, it
muſt be in Antimony, or Mercury
intirely deſtitute of all Acrimony:
The Effects of Mercury on all Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerations
are very manifeſt.</p>
               <p>Bleeding, which is extremely uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in the beginning of the Diſeaſe,
is not ſo proper and uſeful when it
is advanc'd.</p>
               <p>In the firſt Stage the whole Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
of the Body ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lax'd,
a free Perſpiration thro' the
Skin, without violent Sweating, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted;
the Viſcoſity or Toughneſs
of the Fluids taken off by diluents;
the alkaleſcent State of the Salts cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected;
all theſe things are effected
by emollient Fomentations apply'd
inwardly in Clyſters, and why not
outwardly to the Skin? Such are
us'd ſucceſsfully in other Eruptions,
as Eryſipelas, Shingles, by a ſlender
Diet of Decoctions of farinaceous
Vegetables, and copious drinking
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:0412700800:183"/>
of cooling Liquors, with nitrous
and acid Salts, and other acid Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
mix'd with them; no Fleſh,
unleſs it be ſmall Chicken-Broth;
no Spice; the Air ought not to
be ſpoil'd by Heat, nor the Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the Bed ſo thick as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
Sweat.</p>
               <p>The Greatneſs and Danger of
this Diſeaſe is eſtimated by the Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Eruptions on the Face and
other Parts of the Head; therefore
the Matter ought to be ſolicited by
all poſſible Methods to the lower
Parts, eſpecially the Legs, by Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations,
Bathing, Epiſpaſticks,
Bliſtering, and through the whole
Diſeaſe keeping the Feet and Legs
warm; the Breaſt and Head not
any more cover'd than to keep them
from the Impreſſion of cold Air.</p>
               <p>During the Filling and Ripening
of the Puſtles, the Diet may be
more plentiful, but ſtill not hot or
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:0412700800:184"/>
inflammatory, with the due Uſe of
anodyne Subſtances: In this State
Demulcents, or what abates Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony;
and where the Circumſtances
of the Patient require it, a Spoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
or two of Canary Wine, twice
or thrice a Day, are proper: The
Diet in this State ought likewiſe to
be adapted to the particular Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
of the Diſeaſe, as cleanſing,
attenuating, expectorating; to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
the Spitting, diuretick; when
that is ſuppreſs'd, and Clyſters dilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
without any Stimulus, frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
injected, are beneficial in every
Stage of the Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>When the Age, Temperament,
high Pulſe, and eſpecially a Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
and Delirium, all would ſeem
to demand it in any other Caſe,
why not Bleeding in this State?
which I know to have been us'd
with great Succeſs; a great many
Veſſels are in this State almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervious
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:0412700800:185"/>
by the Fluids; thoſe who
die of this Diſeaſe have inward In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations,
eſpecially in the Lungs;
thoſe Reaſons ſeem to juſtify Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Indeed the gangrenous Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which appears in the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Kind, is a Reaſon againſt it,
but hardly any thing will do good
in theſe extremely malignant Caſes.</p>
               <p>In ſuch malignant Kinds, all that
is left is at laſt to try evacuating
the morbifick Matter by other ways,
as Epiſpaſticks and Stools procur'd
by lenitive Subſtances, not irritating,
which would only agitate the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
and increaſe the Fever.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Gravel, Stone.</head>
               <p>A Stone or ſtony Matter may
grow in any Part of a Human Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
for when any thing inſoluble
ſticks in any Part of the Body, it
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:0412700800:186"/>
gathers a Cruſt about it; a ſmall
Drop of concreted Blood may grow
to be a Stone, for by the Evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the moſt fluid Parts it
grows hard, and by the Attraction
of new Matter increaſeth Blood,
and a Human Calculus, or Stone,
yield the ſame Contents by Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
Trial, tho' in an inverſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſtony Concretions happen
moſt commonly in the Kidneys and
Bladder; and indeed if the Tartar
and other Contents of the Urine
were not conſtantly voided, ſuch
Concretions would happen to every
Human Creature; for the Urine of
the moſt ſound Perſon being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected
with a Microſcope, after it
has ſtood a while, will diſcover a
black Speck, which is Sand, and
wherever this Sand ſticks it grows
ſtill bigger, by the appoſition of
new Matter: When ſuch Concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:0412700800:187"/>
happen in the Kidneys, and
are expell'd or drop into the Ure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
it makes what we call Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel;
when they lodge and ſtick in
the Body of the Kidneys, and
grow to ſuch a Bulk as not to
drop into the Pelvis, or paſs by
the Ureters, they make the Stone
in the Kidneys: The Symptoms
of which are a dull Pain in the
Kidney, moſt commonly bloody
Water; upon a ſudden Jolt, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Motion, Pain in Stooping; Pain
in the Thigh, Sickneſs in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
Colical Pains, various Changes
in the Colour of the Urine, black,
bloody, pale, occaſion'd by ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſharp or ſcabrous wounding the
ſmall Blood-Veſſels; if the Stone
is ſmooth and well bedded, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
this may not happen. Fleſhy
Filaments, or Matter voided by
Urine, are ſuſpicious Symptoms of
a Stone in the Kidney, eſpecially
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:0412700800:188"/>
if the Patient has been ſubject to
Voiding of Gravel.</p>
               <p>When a ſmall Stone is lodg'd in
the Body of the Kidney, it does
not create Pain, nor much when it
falls into the Pelvis; but when it
falls into the Ureter, and ſticks,
the Pain is moſt acute; it often
ſtops at the Flexure and Valve of
the Ureter, and ſometimes in the
Urethra, or Paſſage of the Urine
from the Bladder; while it ſtays in
the Bladder it creates no Pain, but
remaining there long it grows a
confirm'd Stone, too big to be paſs'd
by the Urethra: The manner of
its Concretion is by concentrical
Rings, like an Onion, about the
firſt Kernel, which ſhews the Cauſe
to be Attraction. This is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
true of a ſmall Stone, but any
ſolid Body lodg'd in the Bladder
will make the Kernel of a Stone;
the Experiment of a Bullet's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:0412700800:189"/>
this Effect has been try'd
upon a Dog; and ſuch an Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
has happen'd to a Man by a
Wound, in which a Bullet has
dropt into the Bladder.</p>
               <p>The Symptoms of a Stone in the
Bladder are a Titillation about the
Neck of the Bladder, and the Parts
thereabout; a frequent Needing to
make Water; a Senſation of Weight
in the lower Belly, under the Shear-Bone,
with a great Pain, eſpecially
upon any ſudden Motion, which
cauſeth a Concuſſion of the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
a Dribling, Difficulty, and a
momentary Suppreſſion of Urine by
the Stone, ſhutting up the Orifice
of the Bladder, attended with a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſmus,
or needing to go to Stool,
and a burning Pain in the Urethra;
ſometimes a white Mucus in the Urine;
tho' this laſt Symptom will happen
without a Stone in the Bladder.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="424" facs="tcp:0412700800:190"/>
The Regimen in the Stone in
the Kidneys is by diluent and ſoft
Diureticks to try to expel it, if it is
ſmall enough to paſs; if the Stone
is brittle, it will often crumble and
paſs in the Form of Gravel; if the
Stone is too big to paſs, the beſt
Method is to come to a ſort of a
Compoſition or Truce with it; the
Diet ought to be cool and diluent,
as far as poſſible to hinder its
Growth; to uſe Diureticks that gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reſolve, as Parſley, Fennel, Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zonera,
Saſſafras, Mallows, and Tea,
Dandelion, Cichory, Oats, Barley,
Honey, Honey and Vinegar; Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
Salts, as Spirit of dulcify'd
Nitre; the moſt ſoft cooling Dilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
of all, is Whey; the beſt Emol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lients
are Decoctions of Marſhmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
Linſeed-Tea.</p>
               <p>Bathing in tepid Water, Clyſters,
ſeaſoning the Aliment moderately
with Sea-Salt, for the immoderate
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:0412700800:191"/>
Uſe of it is reſolving and diuretick;
the Belly, in all Caſes of the Stone,
ought to be kept lax and open.</p>
               <p>In a confirm'd Stone of the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys
too violent Exerciſe is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</p>
               <p>During the paſſing of a Stone,
one ſhould avoid at firſt all ſtrong
Stimulating; relaxing and lubrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Paſſages, and quieting the
Spaſms by Opiats is certainly the
beſt Method; and where Bathing
cannot be conveniently had, Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Bladders,
half full of warm Water,
apply'd conſtantly to the affected
Part may be uſefully ſubſtituted.
Letting of Blood taketh off a Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
better than any thing, and is
very neceſſary where the Symptoms
are violent; when the Parts are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
relax'd, ſtimulating Diure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
may be us'd more ſafely, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if aſſociated with Opiats.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="426" facs="tcp:0412700800:192"/>
As to Diſſolvents of the Stone,
all that have hitherto been propos'd
are chimerical; <hi>Helmont</hi> talks of Bulls
Blood; Goats Blood is rather a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Diſſolvent.</p>
               <p>The ſureſt way to hinder the
Generation of a Stone, is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
a Diarrhoea by Whey, Broth,
and a liquid Diet; and indeed what
would not one do to prevent ſo pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
a Diſeaſe?</p>
               <p>When the Stone is fallen to the
Bladder, Care ſhould be taken to
make it paſs as ſoon as poſſible,
for the Reaſons above-mention'd;
if all the Symptoms abate without
the paſſing of the Stone, it is not
certain that the Stone remains in
the Bladder, becauſe a very ſmall
Stone may paſs inſenſibly by Urine;
if the Stone has paſs'd, it is not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that the Fit is over, for there are
often more, and the uſual Remedies
ought not to be left off.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="427" facs="tcp:0412700800:193"/>
The Irritations of the Membranes
of the Bladder by a Stone, may be
much mitigated by the Injection of
the Oil of Linſeed or Almonds, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Bladder.</p>
               <p>Such as are ſubject to the Gravel
or Stone ought to be careful of their
Diet, to uſe ſuch Aliments as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
a ſmall Quantity of Foeces, or
relax the Belly; Aliment demulcent,
as Peaſe; a Decoction of Chick-Peaſe
is a Remedy in a Fit of the
Stone; they ought to drink Whey in
the Spring, and take Honey in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Forms, if it agrees with them;
Rice, Barley, Millet, are all good
in this Caſe; nothing makes Stones
or Gravel paſs more eaſily than
Opiats.</p>
               <p>If the Stone ſticks in the Ure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thra,
emollient Fomentation of the
Parts, Oil injected, or in caſe of
great Extremity, an Inſtrument
with a Cavity like a ſmall Spoon,
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:0412700800:194"/>
dipt in Oil, may fetch out the
Stone.</p>
               <p>The Stone in the Bladder is not
only a painful, but a mortal Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,
if not extracted. The Diet of
a Patient in ſuch a Caſe is ſuch as of
a wounded Perſon, nouriſhing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Acrimony.</p>
               <p>Let the Reader look into the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle

is certainly Whey; I knew a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

never be cur'd by any other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
but a Diet of Whey and Bread.
A Milk Diet is likewiſe effectual for
changing that ſaline Conſtitution of
the Serum of the Blood.</p>
               <p>Cream of Tartar in Water-Gruel,
taken for ſeveral Days, will abate
