            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Reaſons, why the</hi> Apothecary <hi>may be ſuppoſed to underſtand the Adminiſtration of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines in the Cure of Diſeaſes, as well as the</hi> Phyſician.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU have at length found the moſt effectual means to prevail with me, to break thro' the reſolution I had taken, of having no ſhare in the preſent Controverſie between the <hi>Phyſicians</hi> and the <hi>Apothecarys,</hi> by imputing my Silence to the bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my Cauſe: In the Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of which, you are pleas'd
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0682000800:3"/>to ſay, no Sober or Ingenious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will offer to draw his Pen.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs, I have hitherto been of the Opinion of the Major part of our Profeſſion; that what has yet appear'd in publick againſt us, has not deſerv'd a ſerious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, moſt of it being taken up on Prejudice, the reſt a Scandalous Aſperſion, invented by a peeviſh Set of Men, who were angry that any body thriv'd beſide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>Thus then have you unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forced me into a ſpacious Field, where on each ſide I may extend and dilate my ſelf; and which way ſoever I turn, may find at leaſt <hi>quantum ſufficit</hi> of Matter to Work upon.</p>
            <p>But ſince you keep a more than ordinary pother with the high Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which the <hi>Phyſicians</hi> have
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0682000800:4"/>over us, I ſhall chuſe to examine the truth of that Aſſertion, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſet thoſe High Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, (as you call 'em) in a true light; and then leave the Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial World to Judge, whether all be Goſpel which proceeds from the Pen of a Diſpenſary <hi>Phyſician.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And firſt it is pretended, That the <hi>Phſician,</hi> by his liberal Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (that is, by being bred at an <hi>Academy</hi>) has greater and more frequent opportunities of being inſtructed in the Practice of <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,</hi> than the <hi>Apothecary</hi> can have; and that not only from his own private Reading and Obſervation, the Care and Direction of his Tutor, but alſo from the publick Lectures of the Phyſick Profeſſor.</p>
            <p>Now if it be expected that this Argument ſhould have any force againſt us, it muſt firſt be prov'd
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0682000800:5"/>what extraordinary Benefits thoſe are which Young Students receive from Tutors and Phyſick Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors; and not think that we ſhall barely aſſent to them, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them to be ſuch mighty things upon their ſingle Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I fear when theſe wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Lectures come to be examin'd, they will appear little better than Barren Animadverſions on <hi>Galen, Hippocrates,</hi> or ſome other of the old Phyſical Authours; which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man is capable of doing, who is able to read and underſtand them. And I believe we may ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to add, that the Auditors of theſe Lectures generally return with the ſame degree of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Satisfaction, as a late Aſſembly did from a Lecture at <hi>Exeter-Exchange,</hi> againſt the <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of the Blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0682000800:6"/>
            <p>It is again Objected againſt us, That the Opportunities of being Advanc'd in the Knowledge of <hi>Anatomy</hi> and <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> ſo eſſential to the Qualification of a Perſon who is to Adminiſter Phyſick, are greater in the <hi>Academy</hi> than in any other place; and from whence the <hi>Apothecary</hi> is totally excluded.</p>
            <p>It muſt be allow'd, that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the wonderful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance and Texture of ſo admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a Machine, as is that of the <hi>Humane Body,</hi> is no ordinary part of Science, and what undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Perſon who Adminiſters Phyſick ought to be acquainted withal. From which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, I cannot ſee how the <hi>Apothecary</hi> is totally excluded, ſince there are conſtant Anatomical Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſections at the <hi>Surgeon</hi>'s <hi>Hall,</hi> which is open to <hi>Apothecarys</hi> as well as
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0682000800:7"/>
               <hi>Phyſicians;</hi> and where I preſume there is more to be ſeen in one Year, than the Young <hi>Phyſician</hi> meets withal in ſix at his <hi>Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The pretended Advantages they have over us in <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> are of a-piece with thoſe before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd: For not to Inſtance our own private <hi>Elaboratorys,</hi> the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick <hi>Elaboratory</hi> at the <hi>Hall,</hi> where all Chymical Preparations are made in the higheſt Perfection, is a ſufficient Confutation of that groundleſs Aſſertion.</p>
            <p>Theſe, <hi>Sir,</hi> Being the principal Reaſons on which You build your <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> namely, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which the <hi>Phyſician</hi> has over the <hi>Apothecary,</hi> I ſhall not content my ſelf with this general Reflection on them, but ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to examine them more cloſely,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0682000800:8"/>and particularly that of Study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity,</hi> by which is meant a liberal Education, as if the Streams of Polite Literature and Knowledge were not alike diffus'd throughout the <hi>Globe,</hi> but were ſcantily confin'd to the Banks of <hi>Cham</hi> or <hi>Iſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We will ſuppoſe then, An <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary,</hi> who is Maſter of the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Tongues, (as there are few of them but are) to be as duly Qualified for the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Comparing and Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on <hi>Phyſical</hi> Authours, as the <hi>Academic Phyſician,</hi> which I think no ſober Intelligent Perſon will de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y, if he allows that the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Tongues as Taught at <hi>Weſtminſter, Pauls,</hi> &amp;c. to be as fit for that purpoſe, as what the Young <hi>Phyſician</hi> generally carries with him to <hi>Oxford,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0682000800:9"/>
            <p>Neither will it be diſputed with me, I think, that Reading, Reffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Obſervation and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are the only known means of acquiring Humane Learning and Science: To all which, the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecary</hi> thus Qualified, has as fair pretences as the moſt Elevated <hi>Phyſician</hi> of 'em all; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Apothecary</hi> may as reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be thought to make as great a Proficience, provided he uſes the ſame Induſtry and Application.</p>
            <p>It may be objected, That altho' the <hi>Apothecary</hi> be thus Qualified, yet whilſt he is an Apprentice he has little or no time for theſe Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys, if he had never ſo great an Inclination; that what with the Duty to his Maſter, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Neceſſities and Expence of Life, which ask ſome time to be repair'd in ſpight of us, there will
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0682000800:10"/>be little or none left for any thing elſe.</p>
            <p>To this I Anſwer, That altho' for the firſt Year or two there may be little elſe done, yet by that time he begins to have a true Taſt of the Matter, and his Reaſon ſhines forth with brighter Rays: If he be a Youth of any Spirit and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, he will and do's find a thouſand opportunities of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing his Knowledge, equal, if not ſuperiour to the <hi>Academic Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Apothecary</hi> then thus Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, may very reaſonably be thought to underſtand the Study of Phyſick, the Natures of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes and their Cures, equally with the <hi>Phyſician,</hi> tho' he cannot boaſt the High Advantages of a liberal Education and <hi>Accademic</hi> Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments.</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0682000800:11"/>
            <p>Whilſt the <hi>Phyſician</hi> contends with us after this manner, we ſhall never recede from theſe Principles: But if he ſhall ſay, That the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of an <hi>Academic</hi> Education are a better Foundation for him to Set up for a Wit, a Poet, or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining Company; then indeed we ſubmit, frankly acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that we induſtriouſly ſhun thoſe <hi>Arts,</hi> which rather tend to the Subverſion and Deſtruction of the Animal Life, than its Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and Emolument.</p>
            <p>If then the equal Learning of the <hi>Apothecary</hi> ſets him upon a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel with the <hi>Phyſician,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his boaſted Advantages over him, it can never be imagin'd that the Compoſition and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of Medicines by which he diſcovers their Nature and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations, will be any hindrance
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0682000800:12"/>to him in the perſecution of thoſe Studies which naturally lead him to any inquiry into the Structure and Oeconomy of the Humane<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy, and the manner how theſe <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines</hi> he prepares Operate upon it.</p>
            <p>This certainly without Vanity we may affirm, That we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the <hi>Materia Medica</hi> as well, not to ſay better than moſt Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary <hi>Phyſicians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The World is very ſenſible what Advantages they owe to theſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Reformers of Phyſick; to whoſe wonderful penetration we have not yet heard that Phyſick has been Obliged for one Addition or Diſcovery: But that is not their buſineſs, 'tis ſufficient for them if they can libel the Town in their awkard Exclamations againſt the <hi>Apothecarys,</hi> by which they vainly imagin'd to have Ingroſs'd the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0682000800:13"/>whole Art of Compounding and Vending Medicines to the Publick. But alas! fond deluded Men, This knowing Age was not to be led Hoodwink'd to their Ruin. The Town ſaw through the thin Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe, and laugh at the ſenſeleſs Contrivance: They knew the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitys of thoſe Perſons who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook the Project, and that moſt of 'em ſo far from being able to Compound Medicines as they ought to be, ſcarce knew the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between <hi>Mint</hi> and <hi>Cardus.</hi> It may be thought perhaps, that here I have a little Tranſgreſs'd, and gone beyond the limits of Truth, for that ſo ſmall a degree of Knowledge is ſufficient for that purpoſe, that it is next to impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that even a Diſpenſary <hi>Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> ſhould be without it. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be thought of it, I have
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0682000800:14"/>undeniable Proofs of this Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to produce, when ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd to it.</p>
            <p>'Tis certain, That however An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry the Diſpenſary <hi>Phyſicians</hi> may be with us at preſent, they had once a better Opinion of our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitys and Underſtanding; I mean, when they Compos'd that moſt Elaborate Piece, the <hi>London Diſpenſatory;</hi> where 'tis evident they did not underſtand what they were about, by the unaccountable Jumble of Alteratives and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thartics in the ſame Compoſition: Nay, nor even the making the Compoſition it ſelf; elſe, What is the meaning that we ſo often meet with <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t Artis Eſt, Secundum Artum,</hi> and the like? By which at leaſt they tacitely confeſs that we are the more knowing of the Two.</p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0682000800:15"/>
            <p>Since ſo much has been ſaid of the Diſpenſary <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> it may not be unſeaſonable to ſpeak a Word of their <hi>Mighty Captain,</hi> and to deſire the Impartial Reader to Examine that Famous Book, which has made ſo much Noiſe in the World; wherein the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of its Writer is ſo very Conſpicuous, that we need hardly point at his Miſtakes.</p>
            <p>His Catalogue of <hi>Drugs</hi> and Simples, (notwithſtanding the whole Conſpiracy labour'd for its Birth) is a handſom Specimen of his Knowledge in the <hi>Materia Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dica;</hi> wherein there is ſcarce a Paragraph which has not ſome one or more rang'd in their improper Claſſes.</p>
            <p>The Senſeleſs Remarks he has made on ſome of the beſt of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, ſhow rather the Fertility
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0682000800:16"/>of his Spleen, than his Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: The which nevertheleſs he fancies unanſwerable, by his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken ſo much pains to bring Quotations from ſome Authours as Obſcure and Splenatick as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for his Vouchers.</p>
            <p>His Spleen and Ignorance will be the more remarkable, when we reflect on that Part of his Book, where with his wonted Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance he tells his Readers, That when it ſhall pleaſe the <hi>Almighty Diſpenſer</hi> of all things, to afflict them with any Malady, that they need not be very ſollicitous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the means of their Cure, that they have nothing to fear but the Lethiferous <hi>Apothecary;</hi> That if it ſhould ſo happen that no Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſary <hi>Phyſician</hi> be at hand, 'tis much ſafer to truſt to the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Event of the Diſeaſe, and the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0682000800:17"/>Direction of Nature, or to any thing elſe, tho' it were but an Old Woman and <hi>Water-Gruel,</hi> than this Bugbear <hi>Apothecary.</hi> This is fine Jargon, and without doubt will be very grateful to a Perſon tortur'd with a Fit of the <hi>Stone,</hi> or indeed in any other violent Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſm or Convulſion of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>It is confeſs'd, that Nature is moſt wiſe in all her Productions; and that if we will cloſely attend to her, ſhe will never fail to Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to us the true way by which ſhe would be aſſiſted by us in her Labours. But this I take to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Power and Addreſs of an Old Woman, or even of our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſary <hi>Phyſician</hi> himſelf.</p>
            <p>To ſay but one Word more of the Ingenuity of this mighty <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour;</hi> and that is, that all the Buſtle
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0682000800:18"/>he has made in this Matter, aroſe from a private Quarrel between him and an <hi>Apothecary,</hi> who it ſeems was a Man of too much Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and of too tenacious a Temper for the Friendſhip of this worthy <hi>Phyſician.</hi> When theſe things I ſay ſhall be duly conſider'd, I make no queſtion but the World will have juſt ſuch an opinion of him and his Performance as they both deſerve.</p>
            <p>Since then the <hi>Apothecary</hi> is not obliged to the Receipts of the <hi>Phyſician</hi> for his Knowledge in the <hi>Adminiſtration of Medicines in the Cure of Diſeaſes,</hi> as the Vulgar falſly imagine, but goes to the ſame Fountain and Drinks as large and as pure Draughts of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge as himſelf: And ſince moſt of us are ready to confeſs, that their Receipts have been ſo far
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0682000800:19"/>from being a Direction to us, that they have rather prov'd <hi>Ignes Fatui</hi> to miſlead us into thoſe Errours we have been guilty of, in relation to Practice.</p>
            <p>Since the Preſent Learning and Labours of the <hi>Apothecaries</hi> are ſo abundantly evident in this Town, that it would be perfectly needleſs for me to mention them.</p>
            <p>And ſince we do, and can give Reaſons equally with the <hi>Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> of the different Operations of Medicines us'd in the Cure of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes; Why are we thus Branded with the Opprobrious Names of <hi>Quacks, Mountebanks, Empiricks,</hi> and what not, by the Mouth of the Conſpiracy, that Mighty Champion for the Cauſe, The Renowned Dr. <hi>Pitt. O Doctiorum puicquid eſt Aſſurgite huic tam colen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do Nomini.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0682000800:20"/>
            <p>'Tis poſſible, It may be thought by what I have ſaid, that I inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to bring an Odium on the Manner of Education, as now Practic'd at the Univerſities, and on thoſe Learned Gentlemen who have been Educated there. I ſhall only beg leave to aſſure thoſe Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Foundations, for whom I have the Profoundeſt Veneration, That I Contend for nothing but the bare Priviledge which our School-Learning Intitles us to, namely, the Underſtanding <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Authours, as well as the <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> tho' we have not had the Pleaſure of being brought up under their Benign Tuition.</p>
            <p>And as for thoſe truly Learned and Worthy <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> who have not departed from their Integrity, We are ſo far from the thoughts of Interpoſing in their Practice,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0682000800:21"/>That We are, and always ſhall be ready, as it is our Duty, to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend and Introduce them, when ever it is in our Power.</p>
            <p>Thus, <hi>Sir,</hi> Have I Anſwer'd Your Requeſt; and I hope have made it appear as much as the Brevity of this Letter will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, that thoſe High Advantages you ſeem ſo fond of, are not ſo Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable as You imagin'd; and that in reality, They are no more than Vain, Empty, Airy Notions, the Genuine Production of the Imagination of a Diſpenſary <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As this is barely a <hi>Specimen</hi> of what I have to bring againſt You, when Leiſure and Opportunity offer themſelves, I would deſire You, as a Friend, in the mean time, to provide your ſelf with a better Shield, to Ward off the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0682000800:22"/>Blows of Your Adverſary, than your Boaſted Advantages are like to prove: And withal, that You will Publiſh Your Next, that the World may judge fairly the Merits of the Cauſe, and give the Crown to the Conquerour.</p>
