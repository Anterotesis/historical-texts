            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE founded my piece upon two ideas;—the firſt, a cuſtom among the Egyptians, who publicly tried the conduct of their great men after death, and then gave judgment on their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Secondly, a cuſtom of the Greeks and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, who pronounced orations over the bodies of their deceaſed heroes, or over their aſhes when inurned.</p>

                  <p>I fear few in theſe days would paſs the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian ordeal immaculate, or merit the Greek or Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man oration. But I am ſurprized, Doctor Plunder, that you, who have ſuffered ſo ſeverely for tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing Maſter Punch, while living, ſhould now become his Panegyriſt; particularly as his <hi>execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> have no <hi>pecuniary</hi> demands upon you. But having ſhifted off this mortal coil, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come defunct, like Zanga's revenge, I ſuppoſe your enmity expired with your foe. You war not with the duſt;—a lion preys not upon carcaſes.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Doctor Plunder.</speaker>
                  <p>Maſter Roſcius ſecundus, you have hit the right nail on the head. I hated Punch while liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but now he is dead, I am determined to be one of his moſt zealous eulogiſts. Our diſlike aroſe from that mutual antipathy which naturally exiſts, not only between dramatic authors, but every claſs of writers, whether coiners, cutters, clippers, or counterfeiters, of literature.</p>

                  <p>Your ſentiments, Doctor, exactly coincide with mine. His failings all lie buried in the grave, and all his good comes ruſhing on my ſoul. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will I again mimic his peculiarities with buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foon drollery. But do you not think the plagia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm of our piece will meet the diſapprobation of the audience?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Doctor Plunder.</speaker>
                  <p>By no means: I have only ſtolen from Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare; and Poets ſet up a preſcriptive right to purloin from him. I am convinced from experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that Plagiariſm meets as much ſucceſs as Originality. The addition of a few <hi>ſongs</hi> to a Tragedy, makes an excellent <hi>Maſque</hi>; and airs ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly introduced into a <hi>Cut Comedy,</hi> anſwers all the intents, and every end of an <hi>Original Opera.</hi> I know how to ſecure the approbation of the public by crook, or by <hi>Hooke.</hi>

                  <p>I plead guilty to your arraignment; and the Prologue which you ſpeak to this night's enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, I have taken, partly from old Jack Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and partly from Alic Pope. I am like Sir Roger de Coverley's chaplain, who always preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from printed ſermons, when unable to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe himſelf.

                  <p>But do you not think, Doctor, that the <hi>Monody</hi> is rather too highly elevated in the <hi>hyperbole?</hi> In praiſing your hero, you have made mere cyphers of every other puppet. Like a poet laureat, you
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0681802100:9"/>
have centered every virtue, merit, and qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in an individual; which is out-heroding Herod, and an inſult upon common-ſenſe and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty.
