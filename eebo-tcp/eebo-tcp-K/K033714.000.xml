      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <sp>
               <l>THOUGH tender ſighs breathe in the tragick page,</l>
               <l>What lover now complains—but on the ſtage?</l>
               <l>No ſuitor now attempts his rival's life,</l>
               <l>But lets him take that cordial balm—a wife:</l>
               <l>And yet, to prove his pure and conſtant flame,</l>
               <l>Still loves his miſtreſs in the wedded dame;</l>
               <l>Still courts his friend, and ſtill devoutly bows</l>
               <l>At the fair ſhrine where firſt he breath'd his vows.</l>
               <l>For love, ſhe knows ſome gratitude is due,</l>
               <l>Searches her heart, and finds there's room for two;</l>
               <l>And often ſees, her coy reluctance o'er,</l>
               <l>Good cauſe to prize her <hi>caro ſpoſo</hi> more.</l>
               <l>Thus modiſh wives, with ſentimental ſpirit,</l>
               <l>May go aſtray, to prove their huſbands' merit,—</l>
               <l>Or ope the door, in this commodious age,</l>
               <l>Without death's aid, to 'ſcape from wedlock's cage.—</l>
               <l>Abjuring rules, that ſoon will ſeem romance,</l>
               <l>Love's gayer ſyſtem we import from France;</l>
               <l>Reſcind politely our old Engliſh <hi>duty,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And take off all reſtraints from wine and beauty;</l>
               <l>While lighter manners cheer our native gloom,</l>
               <l>As Spaniſh wool refines the Britiſh loom.</l>
               <l>Had faſhion's law of old ſuch influence ſhed,</l>
               <l>The raptur'd Claudio ne'er had timeleſs bled:</l>
               <l>His bliſs with joy Mentevole had ſeen,</l>
               <l>And Julia's favourite Ciciſhe' had been.</l>
               <l>The aſſiduous lover, and the huſband bland,</l>
               <l>Like Brentford's kings, had ſtill walk'd hand in hand;</l>
               <l>Together ſtill had ſhone at Park, and play,</l>
               <l>Quaffing the fragrance of the ſame bouquet.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:0532001300:98" rendition="simple:additions"/>Our varlet poet, with licentious ſpeech,</l>
               <l>Thus far our injur'd ſex has dar'd <hi>impeach.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>The female character thus rudely ſlurr'd,</l>
               <l>'Tis fit, at laſt, that <hi>I</hi> ſhould have a word.—</l>
               <l>Firſt then, without rejoinder or diſpute,</l>
               <l>This <hi>virtuous</hi> circle might each <hi>charge</hi> refute.</l>
               <l>That 'tis a <hi>nuptial age,</hi> I ſure may ſay,</l>
               <l>With their own wives when huſbands run away.—</l>
               <l>But truce with jeſt. Howe'er the wits may rail,</l>
               <l>The cauſe of truth and virtue muſt prevail.</l>
               <l>Of former times whatever may be told,</l>
               <l>We are juſt as good as e'er they were of old.</l>
               <l>Connubial Love here long has fix'd his throne,</l>
               <l>And bliſs is ours, to foreign climes unknown.</l>
               <l>If <hi>now and then</hi> a tripping fair is ſound,</l>
               <l>On Scandal's wings the buzzing tale flies round:</l>
               <l>While blameleſs <hi>thouſands,</hi> in ſequeſter'd life,</l>
               <l>Adorn each ſtate, of parent, friend, and wife;</l>
               <l>From private cares ne'er wiſh abroad to roam,</l>
               <l>And bleſs, each day, the ſunſhine of their home;</l>
               <l>Unnoticed keep their noiſeleſs happy courſe,</l>
               <l>Nor dream of ſecond wedlock or divorce.—</l>
               <l>I ſee the verdict's ours; you ſmile applauſe;</l>
               <l>So, with your leave, again I'll plead our cauſe;</l>
               <l>New triumphs nightly o'er this railer gain,</l>
               <l>And to the laſt our female rights maintain.</l>
