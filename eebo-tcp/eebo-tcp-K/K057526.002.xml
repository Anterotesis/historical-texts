            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0558800102:3"/>
preſented to the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and immediately entered on his Office.</p>
               <p>HIS <hi>Lordſhip</hi> was a great <hi>Writer;</hi> but his Works were intended for the Uſe of Poſterity, having never publiſhed but a <hi>Thankſgiving Sermon,</hi> and one on the 30th of <hi>January</hi> by Order of the Houſe of Lords. His Tracts were very voluminous, but all eſſential, and of the utmoſt Conſequence to Mankind. His Treatiſe on the <hi>Uſe</hi> and <hi>Abuſe of Surplices and Lawn Sleeves</hi> was filled with the profoundeſt Erudition.— His Diſcourſe on <hi>Pews, Cuſhions,</hi> and <hi>Mats,</hi> in Churches, was extremely well handled; but the Poſtſcript on <hi>the Crime of ſleeping in thoſe Places,</hi> was ſo artfully worded, that you felt an Example in yourſelf. —His Letter to the Inhabitants of the Pariſh of — clearly demonſtrated the <hi>Abſurdity of a Steeple without Bells.</hi>—His <hi>Apology</hi> and <hi>Vindication</hi> of <hi>Murder, Adultery,</hi> and <hi>Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> proving, mathematically, that the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Name</hi> of theſe Crimes were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely changed by <hi>Circumſtance, Time,</hi> and <hi>Place,</hi> was a moſt learned and elaborate Performance; but his favourite Work was his <hi>Hiſtory</hi> and <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Tithes,</hi> which he demonſtrated to be an <hi>Eſſential of True Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0558800102:4"/>HIS Lordſhip, at different Times, was ſo good as fully to explain theſe Subjects to <hi>Conyers,</hi> who in three Months had tranſcribed the Treatiſe on <hi>Surplices,</hi> and had juſt began the laſt-mentioned Work. He had full Employment, but was not extremely pleaſed with the Nature of it, for his Taſte was ſo vitiated, that he found no Charms in what he did not underſtand.</p>
               <p>THE Biſhop kept a plentiful Table, where his <hi>Clergy</hi> were welcome, except the poorer Sort, to whom he made ample Amends for the Diſtinction by ſmall Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents and large Promiſes. He was a Man of Virtue, and religiouſly kept his Word, when his Memory, which was none of the beſt, fail'd him not. So weak was he in that Quarter, that he remembered and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got his Promiſe to a poor Curate ten dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Times, and as often was angry with himſelf. On theſe Occaſions he uſed to ſay, <q>Well, God help me! I find I am grown old; my Faculties can't laſt for ever;— <hi>The Lord gave, and the Lord ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away.</hi>
                  </q>—Sometimes indeed his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory was very ſharp, for if one, or ten of his Clergy, were ſick, he never failed a daily Enquiry after their Health; and when any died, he never ſuffered the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to lapſe. He could not bear Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0558800102:5"/>
and no Doubt his Dependants were careful not to offend in that Article.—He did not <hi>like Money,</hi> but he paſſionately <hi>lov'd it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>JACK did not much approve of his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation. He lived well, but he plainly ſaw he had no great Proſpect of a future Fortune, and looked on himſelf as <hi>Gil Blas</hi> when with the Archbiſhop, which deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined him to be ſoon convinced of what he had to depend on. He had Thoughts of writing a modeſt and moving Letter to his Lordſhip; but then he remembered, That '<hi>a Verſe may catch him, who a Sermon flies;</hi> ſo reſolved to write a Stanza or two, and leave it on my Lord's Deſk next Morning. Accordingly he ſat down and wrote,

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0558800102:10"/>
Minutes, then has burſt out into La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations and Tears, then into violent Laughter, and end in a Swoon.—Doctor <hi>Noſtrum</hi> conſtantly attended; but one Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when he had finiſhed <hi>above,</hi> Sir <hi>John,</hi> got him to taſte ſome <hi>Cape</hi> Wine, and give ſome Account of her Ladyſhip's Diſorder. —<q>Sir <hi>John, ſaid the Doctor,</hi> who was a dry Joker, here is my Service to you.— Upon my Word very good Wine—very good Wine indeed, Sir. But—you were ſaying ſomething of <hi>that there</hi> Diſorder. —Why—to be ſure, your <hi>Hypochondriac</hi> and <hi>Hyſteric</hi> Diſorders are troubleſome,— very troubleſome, and tedious, but ſeem, I may ſay, to be more ſo to the Huſband or Wife, or Attendants, than to the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient</hi> and <hi>Phyſician.</hi> I think I have had theſe Diſorders, in a peculiar Manner under my Care, for theſe Thirty or Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-two Years laſt paſt; and I think I may ſay, that I underſtand them; that is, I know how to treat them properly.— There is no certain Rule to go by, for,— for as a ſkilful Mariner muſt find out the Trim of his Ship; ſo I ſay a ſkilful Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician muſt find out the Temper of his Patient. — If I preſcribe a <hi>China Jarr,</hi> when the Malady is fix'd on a <hi>Japan Cabinet,</hi> I ſhall do Wrong,—be all out,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0558800102:11"/>
and perchance may double the Diſorder upon me.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>I OWN, Doctor, <hi>ſaid Sir Peter,</hi> I am no Judge of theſe Matters, but for my Blood, I cannot conceive what <hi>Jarrs</hi> or <hi>Cabinets</hi> have to do in the Affair'—O Lord, Sir <hi>Peter, cry'd the Doctor</hi> — but here's my beſt Reſpects.—In Truth it has a charming Flavour!—but, as you were ſaying,—or—as I was ſaying.—To explain this Phoenomenon, I ſhall not call in the <hi>Ancients,</hi> for they were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, very ignorant of ſundry modern Ailments, but account, that is, Reaſon upon them, on the Principles of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Philoſophy. — Hem — hem — The Diſorder is of the <hi>Feminine Gender.</hi> — When it attacks a <hi>Maſculine Figure,</hi> it then becomes of the <hi>doubtful.</hi>— It is termed, by Pre-eminence, <hi>Vapour,</hi> from its aſcending Quality; for it riſes (you'll pleaſe to obſerve, Sir) in the Heart by the too quick Viberation of the Blood, and mounts directly to the Brain.—Thus —when an Object is placed before a Lady in ſuch a Point of Light, that the Rays of her Eyes center, and form a <hi>Focus</hi> upon it, the Effect is ſurprizing.— The Object indeed remains ſound and entire, but her Heart <hi>burns for it.</hi>—
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0558800102:12"/>
When the Heart Strings are untuned, no Wonder that the Voice is all Diſcord.— <hi>A Diamond Solitair—A Gilt Chariot—Fine</hi> Dreſden <hi>China —An</hi> Indian <hi>Skreen</hi> — and the like, cauſe ſuch a Fluttering of the animal Spirits, and raiſe ſuch a longing for <hi>poſſeſſing them,</hi> that clearly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s Doctrine of <hi>Attraction</hi> and <hi>Viſion.</hi>—Contrary Principles will ſometimes produce the ſame dreadful Effects—When a Lady delights in the innocent Amuſement of PLAY, and has what they call, an <hi>ill Run,</hi> it undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly will over-heat the Blood, and ſour the Temper,— but I ſay—when ſhe is not in a Condition to diſcharge ſuch <hi>honourable Debts,</hi> the whole Maſs is on a Ferment, and frequently produces Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences very fatal to the Repoſe of the Family.</q>

I would adviſe you, Sir <hi>Peter,</hi> to ſee how my Preſcriptions will operate for a Day or two.—If the Diſorder don't take a Turn in that Time, why, apply your's.—But, here's

my good Lady's better Health.—I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it is a moſt delicious Cordial! — It warms my Heart.' — 'I fancy, Doctor, <hi>ſaid Sir Peter,</hi> this Wine would be very proper for my dear Girl.—It would raiſe her Spirits.—'Raiſe her Spirits, <hi>cryed the Doctor,</hi> why, it is their being too high that cauſes the Diſorder.—Beſides—Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides—All dulciferous Fluids are bad.— Acid is her proper Regimen, and tho' it is true, there is an Acidity in all Sweets; it is not of the right Sort—Your right genuine <hi>Sour,</hi> is the ſureſt Remedy.—I have ordered the Juice of the <hi>Crab Apple</hi> to be taken internally, and the fungous Matter to be apply'd, Plaiſter-ways, to the Shoulders and Back, with great Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.—I was once ſent for to a rich Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter's in <hi>Southwark,</hi> whoſe Wife was ſuddenly ſeiz'd with the <hi>Vapours.</hi>—The poor Woman was as extremely ill as any Lady of the firſt Quality.—So, Sir,—as I was ſaying,—I was going to order her the Apples, but the Seaſon not affording any, and her Caſe being very deſperate, I directed her Huſband to take a <hi>ſlender Twig</hi> of <hi>that there</hi> Tree of about three Foot long, and apply the ſame in ſo ſmart a Manner to the <hi>Shoulders,</hi> that the Part might be thoroughly warmed,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0558800102:14"/>
and the Pores ſo opened, as at once to draw, and ſuffer the malignant <hi>Effluvia</hi> to <hi>evaporate</hi> with Eaſe.—Next Morning, Sir, I viſited my Patient, but, to my very great Surprize, I found her chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſitting by the Kitchen Fire, darning her Huſband's Stockings.—The Fellow was an ungrateful Dog — for he never employed me ſince.—I ſhall not, <hi>Sir Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> take up more of your Time at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but refer you to a ſmall Folio on that Subject, which I have now ready for the Preſs,—This one Glaſs and no more.—Amongſt a Variety of Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, one is pretty general.—In all the Practice and Experience I have had, I never knew a Lady ſubject to Spleen or <hi>Vapours,</hi> who was bleſs'd with a <hi>ſurly ill-natur'd</hi> Huſband.—In <hi>Ruſſia</hi> the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order is unknown, otherwiſe the Great <hi>Klincoſky,</hi> and the celebrated <hi>Baroniwiſky,</hi> would have taken ſome Notice of it; but you frequently meet with the Uſe and Efficacy of the <hi>Crab Tree,</hi> and find it in moſt of their Preſcriptions, which, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, is given by way of Prevention.— But my Hour is come for a Conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,—ſo—Sir <hi>Peter,</hi> your moſt obedient and moſt faithful humble Servant.</q>—</p>

               <p>THE Servants had perſuaded <hi>Jack</hi> to be a Member, and pay Quarteridge to a Society of <hi>Footmen,</hi> which they called a Parliament. This Convocation regulated diverſe weighty Matters, and raiſed a Fund for the Maintenance of their Brethren <hi>out of Place.</hi> The Members took the Titles of their reſpective Maſters, and ſpoke and acted ſo near their Characters, that it might be termed a <hi>Saturnalia. Jack was but</hi> too punctual a Viſiter. If he improved not in his Manners by ſuch Company, he
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0558800102:17"/>
thought, at leaſt, that he was well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</p>
               <p>THE Conſtitution of this motly Synod, with their Conduct and Reſolutions, muſt be poſtponed to another Chapter, that the Chain of this Hiſtory may not be broken.</p>
               <p>WAS our Hero intitled to an Eſtate, his Age would permit him to enjoy it.—His Complexion, his Manner, his Voice, but above all, his generous good-humoured Diſpoſition, could not eſcape the piercing Eyes of Mrs. <hi>Suſanna Pinup.</hi> This Lady acted in the humble Station of Waiting-Woman to Lady <hi>Shallow.</hi> From her Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſundry domeſtick Secrets, ſhe had great Power in the Family, and, as the Servants phraſe it, had <hi>feathered her Neſt.</hi> Her great Sagacity not only diſcovered Charms in the Perſon of Mr. <hi>John Conſtant,</hi> but that he had Money likewiſe. The Union of ſuch Perfections, merited her tendereſt Regard, to which, ſhe thought, if her own were added, the Syſtem of Happineſs would be compleat.</p>
               <p>WITH theſe Views Mrs. <hi>Pinup</hi> began to notice our <hi>Jack</hi> in a particular Manner. She ſhewed him every Civility; ſhe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured him frequently with her Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and was ſo intimate and gracious, that he often drank Tea in her Chamber.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0558800102:18"/>
Such a manifeſt Partiality drew on her the Reſentment and ſcandalous Tongues of the other Servants; but, from her <hi>exalted Seat,</hi> ſhe looked down with Contempt on the <hi>vulgar Wretches.</hi>—Mr. <hi>Buffett,</hi> the Butler, ſeemed moſt concerned, and, with a jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic'd Eye, beheld this growing Paſſion, ſo fatal to his Hopes. This Gentleman had long ſighed for Mrs. <hi>Pinup,</hi> and made ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Libations of Pints of Sack, and other choice Wines, on the Shrine of her Beauty. His Project was as extenſive as it was am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious. He judged, that could he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Heart of this Lady, <hi>the cheating the Family</hi> in every Branch, from the <hi>Cellar,</hi> upwards, would centre in his own Pocket. This was a Loſs his Philoſophy was not Proof againſt, and made him meditate dire Revenge.</p>
               <p>Mrs. PINUP was ſo fond of <hi>Jack,</hi> and ſo ſecure of her darling Scheme, that ſhe omitted ſome Eſſentials in bringing it to bear; for one Evening, when Proteſtations and Vows were plentifully beſtowed on each other, and fervent Kiſſes and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces given, and returned with mutual Ardour, the <hi>World</hi> and all its <hi>idle Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi> were forgotten, and equal Happineſs cemented their Hearts without the Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of any <hi>Prieſt,</hi> except that of Love.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0558800102:19"/>MATTERS were thus conducted for ſome Time; but Mrs. <hi>Pinup</hi> had praiſed <hi>Jack</hi> ſo much to Miſs <hi>Shallow,</hi> that ſhe longed to converſe with him, and <hi>Pinup</hi>'s Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber gave her frequent Opportunities. Miſs <hi>Shallow</hi> was Siſter to Sir <hi>Peter,</hi> and had a Fortune of Ten Thouſand Pounds. Her Education had been none of the beſt, and her Perſon was of that Sort, that a Man paſſes by without noticing. However, <hi>Jack</hi>'s Vanity was ſtrangely up, and Ten Thouſand Pounds put a Million of Schemes into his Head, and his waking and ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Dreams were filled with <hi>Equipage</hi> and <hi>Splendor.</hi>—With ſome Difficulty and weighty Reaſons, he perſuaded <hi>Pinup</hi> to aſſiſt him, and Miſs <hi>Shallow</hi> ſeemed no-ways averſe to his <hi>Careſſes</hi> and <hi>Propoſal,</hi> tho' the was actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally engaged to 'Squire <hi>Hunt,</hi> and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage Writings drawn. In ſhort, nothing was wanting to compleat this Affair but a convenient Opportunity, which would ſoon have happened, had not adverſe Fate, in the Shape of Mr. <hi>Buffett,</hi> maliciouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpos'd.</p>
               <p>JEALOUSY, <hi>Envy, Intereſt</hi> and <hi>Revenge,</hi> are powerful <hi>ſeparate,</hi> but make ſtrange Havock when <hi>united. Buffett</hi> had them all. He had never ceas'd watching the Motions of Mrs. <hi>Pinup;</hi> and his Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0558800102:20"/>
were ſuch, that they added to his Pain; but, when he found Miſs <hi>Shallow</hi> was of the Party, Revenge opened an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Field.</p>
               <p>SIR <hi>Peter,</hi> as I've before obſerved, was not the brighteſt Genius in <hi>England;</hi> but, in Recompence, Nature had indulged him with a large Share of Pride, <hi>(that Vice of little Minds!)</hi> with which he ſometimes impoſed himſelf on the World as a Man of Conſequence and great Importance.— Mr. <hi>Buffett</hi> knew his ruling Paſſion, and applied to it. On the firſt Notice, the <hi>Knight</hi> ſtormed and ſwelled with Rage; but the Butler moderated his Anger, and perſuaded him into Patience, until he ſhould convince him of the Truth.—Next Evening the Lovers met; but the artful <hi>Buffett</hi> had ſo contrived, that Sir <hi>Peter</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly entered, and caught the unguarded Pair in their innocent Embraces, and Mrs. <hi>Pinup</hi> in the Midſt of a Diſcourſe on Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy.—<q>Fine Doings in my Houſe, <hi>cryed Sir Peter,</hi> — But I'll ſpoil your Sport, you impudent Son of a W—re.</q>— He ran directly at <hi>Jack,</hi> but <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Miſs Shallow</hi> averted the Blow, and gave him an Opportunity of ſlipping out of the Room. His Retreat was ſo precipitate, that he did not obſerve the Butler liſt'ning
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0558800102:21"/>
on the Stair-head, but drove againſt his Breaſt with ſuch Force, that poor Mr. <hi>Buffett</hi> was hurried down a little improperly, for his <hi>Head</hi> went foremoſt. He fell with a mighty Noiſe, and the Alarm was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral through the Family. — Had there been <hi>Earth</hi> or <hi>Air-quakes</hi> in thoſe Days, no Doubt they had all ran to <hi>Prayers,</hi> and laughed at themſelves for ſo doing, when the Danger was over.—Sir <hi>Peter</hi> thundered —Miſs ſcreamed, and <hi>Pinup</hi> wept ſo loud, that my Lady with her Company, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the Servants, filled the Room in an Inſtant.</p>
               <p>THE Knight thought he acted very cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly, by not telling the <hi>Whole</hi> of this Affair before ſo many; but as he dropt ſome Words about Miſs, and inſiſted that <hi>Pinup</hi> and <hi>Jack</hi> ſhould be immediately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, he left them all Room enough to <hi>think the worſt,</hi> tho', perhaps, their Charity and Good-nature wanted not his Help.—<hi>My Lady</hi> pleaded ſtrongly for poor <hi>Pinup;</hi> yet at laſt ſhe was obliged to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but with a Proviſo, that the <hi>Butler</hi> ſhould make a Third. Sir <hi>Peter</hi> gave him up very readily, ſo that in leſs than an Hour, the ill-fated Mr. <hi>Buffett</hi> loſt his Cellar.—The unhappy <hi>Pinup</hi> loſt all her Lover's Promiſes.—The unfortunate <hi>Jack</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0558800102:22"/>
loſt Ten Thouſand Pounds, and — next Day <hi>Miſs Shallow</hi> loſt her <hi>Reputation,</hi> but luckily ſhe found it on the Third, in the Arms of <hi>'Squire Hunt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I FORGOT to mention, that Mr. <hi>Sang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>froid</hi> had been lately obliged to accompany a Nobleman to <hi>Liſbon;</hi> ſo that <hi>Jack</hi> loſt this <hi>Aſylum,</hi> with his Advice and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.—When he had packed up his Goods, and reſigned his Livery, he found Mrs. <hi>Pinup</hi> waiting for him in the Hall, becauſe, as ſhe ſaid, <q>One Coach might ſerve both.</q> — They mounted, but where to drive was not determined; but at laſt they ſtopt in <hi>Southampton-ſtreet. Jack</hi> alighted, and ſoon found a convenient Lodging, where the happy Pair acted the Part of <hi>Man and Wife,</hi> with great Harmony for about a Fortnight. <hi>Pinup</hi> often boaſted her Riches, and tempted him, by ſhewing Thirty Guineas <hi>in hard Gold,</hi> beſides <hi>Linens and Woollens,</hi> and ſundry Gowns and Pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticoats.— <q>
                     <hi>Jack</hi> was Proof againſt all Tears and Intreaties. — 'Pſha, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> I've more than that myſelf. Marry! — we ſhould be pretty Devils truly! No, no, Child, keep your Money, and I'll keep your Secret.'—'I don't underſtand, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> what you mean by Secrets. — If I have any, I believe it won't be a Secret
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0558800102:23"/>
long.—I wiſh your <hi>Money</hi> was no more a Secret than mine.'—'So much for Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, <hi>reply'd Jack,</hi> now for the Proof. Do you ſee that large Trunk, my Dear? 'Tis the faithful Repoſitory of <hi>fifty Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas.</hi>' Ay, ay, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> I ſee both your Trunks, but for the Money, <hi>ſeeing's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving.'</hi> 'You have no more Faith, <hi>cry'd Jack,</hi> than an <hi>Ebrew Jew;</hi> but I ſhall convince you in a Moment.</q>—The large Trunk had not been open'd, by him, theſe ſix Months, and he found the Lock ruſty, and more difficult than it uſed to be. At laſt he got the better, but was ſurprized at ſeeing ſome of his Effects out of order. In a little Flutter, he ſearch'd for his Purſe, but not readily finding it, his Hurry increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and he pull'd out an <hi>old Great Coat,</hi> and ſome tatter'd Shirts artfully mingl'd with ſome of his Things of little Value.—In a Word, his <hi>Money</hi> and his beſt Effects were vaniſh'd. — He flew in an Inſtant to the ſmall Trunk, which contain'd his ordinary wear, and in which he had very oddly placed the <hi>ſmall Box</hi> his old Friend Mr. <hi>Kindly</hi> had given him, and moſt of Mr. <hi>Villeneuf</hi>'s and his own Papers. Finding this ſafe and untouch'd, he ſat down in Silence, tho' greatly perplex'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0558800102:24"/>
                  <q>BLESS me, ſaid Mrs. <hi>Pinup,</hi> what ails the Man?—Sure, you <hi>haven't</hi> loſt your <hi>Money?</hi> — Yes, <hi>ſaid Jack,</hi> 'tis gone, — every Shilling gone! but how, or which Way, Heaven knows!—Heaven knows! <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> I believe Heaven knows very well you had no ſuch Thing, but that you've betray'd and cheated a poor innocent Woman; but ſince I find theſe are your Tricks, I ſhall take Care of myſelf, I aſſure you.—Very well, <hi>reply'd Jack,</hi> pray proceed, for I am in a Temper to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke a <hi>Saint;</hi> for I ſha'n't anſwer.</q>—As ſhe had nothing to fear, ſhe ſaluted him with bitter Terms, and many ſtinging Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, till <hi>Tears</hi> interven'd, and gave him a Receſs.— <q>Since, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> you are ſo good to be ſilent, becauſe you have no more to ſay, pray let me be heard.—I have my Quarter's Wages in my Pocket, which will more than pay the Lodging. Let me have a little Repoſe this Night, and To-morrow you may diſpoſe of your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf how and which way you pleaſe, for, by the Lord, this ſhall be the laſt.</q> — <hi>Pinup</hi> attempted a Reply, but he ſwore in ſo peremptory a Manner, as frighten'd the poor Woman into Silence. They retir'd to Bed, but <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Repoſe</hi> had forſaken it, and <hi>Hatred</hi> and <hi>Diſquietude</hi> took their
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0558800102:25"/>
Place. The dawning Day rous'd <hi>Jack</hi> from his Pillow, and <hi>Pinup</hi> unwillingly follow'd. He generouſly paid all Charges, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Trunks on a Bier, parted with this Lady, telling her, before the Land-lady, that ſhe might follow at her Leiſure, but, as he intended, ſo, he never ſaw her after.</p>

               <p>AS the dropping Water will, in Time, impreſs even Marble, ſo <hi>low</hi> and <hi>mean Company</hi> will communicate their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents and infect even an Heart of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and Virtue. <hi>Jack</hi> now ceas'd to be the <hi>agreeable</hi> and the <hi>polite.</hi> He <hi>ſwore</hi> much, and ſometimes <hi>drank.</hi> He had contracted a ſaucy impertinent Air, and inſtead of that humble, modeſt Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that drew on him the <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Eſteem</hi> of the World, his Looks and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſeem'd to demand them as his <hi>Right,</hi> and as due to his Perſon and ſuperior Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0558800102:26"/>
He forgot all the Leſſons and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of his Friends, and thought his own Experience and great Knowledge were ſufficient to conduct him, without the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of <hi>pedantick</hi> Rules, or the <hi>muſty Gravity</hi> of old Philoſophers.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER, this laſt Stroke of Fortune had alter'd his <hi>Thermometer,</hi> and <hi>Pride</hi> ſunk down to <hi>extreme Humility.</hi> In this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per he apply'd to Mr. <hi>Edge,</hi> a Barber, to whom he made known his Situation. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt <hi>Edge</hi> was ſorry to find him in ſuch Diſtreſs, and provided him a Room for two Shillings a Week, but for his Diet, he was to manage the beſt Way he could. He had ſtill three Guineas and ſome Silver remaining, and waited, with great Anxiety, for a Turn of Fortune.</p>
               <p>AS our Hero, like other Heroes, has found a Time for Idleneſs and Inaction, it furniſhes me an Opportunity of exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the <hi>Memoirs of the Parliament of Footmen,</hi> and making ſuch Extracts as I judge of publick Uſe and Benefit.</p>
               <p>THIS noble Order held their Aſſemblies at ſundry <hi>Beer-Houſes,</hi> but all united in the main View of giving Laws to, and providing a Maintenance for the Brethren who came within their Rules. The Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber our Friend frequented was fill'd with
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0558800102:27"/>
the Servants of <hi>Dukes, Lords, Biſhops, Knights</hi> and <hi>Squires,</hi> and made up a ſubſcribing Body of about two hundred, of which forty or fifty were commonly preſent at each weekly Aſſembly. As theſe <hi>great</hi> Men, follow'd the Example of their <hi>great</hi> Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, they were leſs clamorous than might be expected. An old Gentleman fill'd the Chair as <hi>Speaker,</hi> and kept Matters in moſt excellent order.</p>
               <p>THE following are a few of their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Reſolutions; for by the Advice of Friends, I ſhall ſpeedily publiſh, <hi>by Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription,</hi> a full and impartial Hiſtory of this <hi>noble Order,</hi> in ſeven Volumes Octavo, in which will be included all their Speeches on the moſt intereſting Subjects, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete Syſtem of Wiſdom and Prudence. The Reſolutions neceſſary in this Place are as follow.</p>
               <p>RESOLVED, That each Member, when out of Place, ſhall receive two Shillings each Week, for the Term of ſix Months, but no longer. On his getting a new Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very to pay freſh Entrance.</p>
               <p>RESOLVED, That each Member pay five Shillings on his Admittance, and two Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and Sixpence each Quarter.</p>
               <p>RESOLVED, That no Member, when accompanying his Maſter or Miſtreſs in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0558800102:28"/>
their Viſits, ſhall attempt to open or hold the Coach Door, or afford them any the leaſt Aſſiſtance, but leave them to the Care of the Servants of the Family viſited.</p>
               <p>RESOLVED, That the Hats, Swords or Canes of Gentlemen viſiting our reſpective Maſters, ſhall be ſeized upon, and kept in ſafe Cuſtody, until the ſaid Gentlemen de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part. Should any of the ſaid Gentlemen refuſe or neglect to pay the uſual Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it ſhall and may be lawful to change his ſaid Hat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or have them miſlaid or loſt, and, as Occaſion ſerves, to give him Water when he calls for Wine; ſmall Beer when he deſires Bread; and, if he be an obſtinate Offender, entirely to diſregard and affront him.</p>
               <p>RESOLVED, That as we look on the Tables of our Maſters as <hi>Ordinaries,</hi> ſo we expect to be paid in Proportion to their Rank, from half a Crown to half a Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea.</p>
               <p>RESOLVED, That no Perſons paying a Morning Viſit to our reſpective Maſters, and particularly <hi>Trades-People</hi> with <hi>Bills,</hi> ſhall be permitted to ſee them, except on Payment of the uſual and accuſtomed <hi>Fee,</hi> but on their Compliance, then our ſaid Maſters to be made viſible, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Orders to the contrary.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0558800102:29"/>RESOLVED, That all <hi>Tradeſmen</hi> ſhall be obliged to pay at the Rate of Five Pounds by the Hundred, for every Commodity ſold to our reſpective Maſters; and the ſaid <hi>Tradeſmen</hi> are hereby empower'd to make an extraordinary Charge of ten Pounds by the Hundred.</p>
               <p>RESOLVED, That in attending our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters or Miſtreſſes to the Play-houſe, or any other publick Spectacle where we are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, we will endeavour to imitate their Conduct, by doing our utmoſt to diſturb the Audience. This will demonſtrate our Power, and ſhew the Uſe of exalting us.</p>
               <p>RESOLVED, That no Member ſhall be entitled to the Benefit of this Society, who ſhall live more than three Months in any Family who do not play Cards five Nights in the Week, <hi>Sunday</hi> Night included; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall he receive any Benefit, if it can be proved that he has ſuffer'd any Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution to his Authority and legal Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges.</p>
               <p>RESOLVED, And it is hereby moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly agreed, by the Honour and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of <hi>our Cloth,</hi> that ſhould any Member of this Society marry the <hi>Relict</hi> of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, or the <hi>Daughter</hi> of his Maſter or Miſtreſs, that he ſhall pay into the Hands of our Treaſurer, Ten Shillings for every
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0558800102:30"/>
Hundred Pounds obtained by ſuch Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
               <p>RESOLVED, That any Member, guilty of <hi>Robbery</hi> or <hi>Theft,</hi> ſhall be expell'd this Society. Nevertheleſs, this is not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to extend to <hi>Breach of Truſt,</hi> Embez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zlement of Goods, and the <hi>neceſſary</hi> Frauds in <hi>Bread, Coals, Candles, Oats,</hi> &amp;c. which we regard as Privileges annexed to our Poſts, and Part of our <hi>juſt Perquiſites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>RESOLVED, That each Member be as careful as poſſible of all his Apparel, except the <hi>Livery,</hi> and that he practiſes all lawful Ways and Means to wear out his Maſter's <hi>Shirts, Shoes, Stockings,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>THEY had many more, equally whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Laws, not made, <hi>like ſome others,</hi> to be broken or deſpiſed, for I apprehend they kept ſtrictly to each.</p>

                  <hi>JACK</hi> remain'd at the Barber's about three Weeks; and tho' he received his <hi>Parliamentary</hi> Penſion very punctually, yet his Money diminiſhed apace.</p>
               <p>HE ſaw no Appearance of Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and gloomy melancholy Thoughts rack'd his Brain. With a View of allevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating his Sorrows, he frequently took a <hi>Dram,</hi> and innocently amuſed himſelf with one or two very <hi>low Amours.</hi> This made his Purſe feel a very ſenſible Decay, for it now contain'd but a very few Shillings.— Mad and wild at the Cruelty of his Fate, a thouſand Projects fill'd his Head, and at laſt ended in the noble Reſolution of ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Little he had in Pleaſure, and then to reſign a Life that became burthenſome to him. He brought many weighty Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to vindicate the Action, and call'd, to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0558800102:32"/>
his Mind the Example of ſundry great Men who accounted it meritorious. — <q>Why are we, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> brought into the World but to enjoy the few Pleaſures of it with Eaſe and Content.—What Eaſe have I? —What Content?—If the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of <hi>Being</hi> ceaſe, it is but juſt we ſhould ceaſe to <hi>Be</hi>—Beſides, What are all the Pleaſures of this World, even in the higheſt Gratification, but <hi>idle ſtupid</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions of the ſame ſtupid Amuſements? —<hi>Come, gentle Thames, and peaceful Grave now come, for</hi> Conyers <hi>is aweary of this World, and longs to lay his troubled Head in Duſt!</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>HE was now in St. <hi>James</hi>'s <hi>Park.</hi> His Steps were ſlow; his Arms were folded; his Head reclined, and a fix'd Melancholy was ſeated on his Brow.—In the Midſt of theſe Reflections, two of his <hi>quondam</hi> Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren paſs'd him by; but one, turning about, cry'd,— <q>Z—ns, <hi>Jack Conſtant!</hi>— Such a Man alive! Where the Devil have you hid yourſelf theſe thouſand Years?</q>—Theſe Sort of Greetings finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they enter'd into Particulars. <q>I ſuppoſe, <hi>ſaid Tom Smart,</hi> you are now one of thoſe poor daſtardly Scoundrels, who ſtarve in a rich World.'— 'Let him ſtarve, <hi>cry'd Jack Brazen,</hi> if he han't Spirit enough
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0558800102:33"/>
to fiſh in troubled Waters.' 'Come, come, <hi>ſaid Smart,</hi> d'ye really want Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney?'— 'Not much, <hi>reply'd our Friend,</hi> for I believe I have a Shilling; but where to get another, the Lord knows.' — 'Here's a Guinea, my Boy, <hi>ſaid Smart,</hi> you ſee I don't want Money, nor need you, if you'll take our Advice; but let's dine together, and talk that Matter over.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THEY dined, and a Bottle of <hi>Port</hi> was open'd, as well as the Converſation. <hi>Smart</hi> dwelt long on the partial Diſtribution of the good Things of this World, and on the Neceſſity of correcting the Scheme.— <q>Is it juſt, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> that Numbers of good-for-nothing worthleſs Animals ſhall wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in <hi>Plenty</hi> and <hi>Abundance,</hi> whilſt ſuch young Fellows as us may want the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Conveniencies of Life?'—Very juſt, <hi>ſaid Brazen,</hi> provided they will permit our uſing ſome of their Superfluities.'— D—me, <hi>ſaid Jack,</hi> but I am all in the Dark. I wiſh you'd ſpeak a little plainer, or not ſpeak at all. You may depend on my Secrecy, for I am almoſt already in the Grave. Now, Gentlemen, if you've a Mind to bring me to Life, come to the Point directly, and a thouſand to one but I'll join in your Scheme.' — 'Well
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0558800102:34"/>
ſaid, honeſt <hi>Jack, cry'd Smart,</hi> then to the Point.—You muſt know, that <hi>Brazen</hi> and I were turn'd a-drift together from my Lord's. We wore out our Shoes and the Pavement, but could get no Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment; and ſomething told us, that Eating was neceſſary, ſo, my <hi>dear Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,</hi> we <hi>padded</hi> it about the Fields for ſome Time, and, by our Induſtry, have riſen to <hi>Horſe.</hi> We are at this Time <hi>Commiſſioners of the Highways,</hi> and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect thoſe <hi>Duties</hi> omitted in the Acts of <hi>Parliament.</hi>'— 'I underſtand you, <hi>ſaid Jack;</hi> but does it anſwer? Is it not dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous?' — 'It anſwers, <hi>ſaid Smart,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely well, tho', to be ſure, it is a little hazardous; but where is the Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without it? — Don't the Merchant venture for Lucre, and the Soldier and Sailor riſk their <hi>Lives</hi> for Six-pence a Day?— Some riſk their <hi>Reputation,</hi> and moſt People riſk their <hi>Souls.</hi> — Believe me, <hi>Jack,</hi> the whole World is a Game of Hazard, and (ſhewing his Piſtols) here are my <hi>Dice.</hi>—Will you ſet?</q>
               </p>
               <p>OUR Hero paus'd, and a violent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict aroſe in his Breaſt between <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Neceſſity.</hi>—At laſt, <hi>Brazen</hi> clapp'd him on the Shoulder, and cry'd, — <q>What ſays my dear Boy?—Will you make a Third,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0558800102:35"/>
and then our Party is compleat?— Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, <hi>ſaid Jack,</hi> give me your Hands. Now I am a Brother. — Command and lead me where you pleaſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>That Night they conducted him to their Lodging, and gave him a Horſe for the Morning Expedition, and three Guineas more. They roſe very early, and <hi>Jack</hi> put on a Pair of Spatterdaſhes, examin'd his Saddle and Piſtols, and found all Things in tolerable Order.</p>
               <p>THE Plan of Operation was ſettled by <hi>Smart,</hi> but, providentially, <hi>Jack</hi> made a ſmall Alteration. <q>No, Gentlemen, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> let us not ſet out together, or keep Company on the Road, as it may cauſe Suſpicion; let us rather divide, and ride on to <hi>Staines,</hi> but join on <hi>Hounſlow-heath</hi> preciſely at Eleven o'Clock, when we can't fail of meeting the Coach we look for. — Beſides, when ſeparate, we may each pick up a ſingle Traveller to amuſe us before the principal Action.'—'Very right, <hi>ſaid Smart,</hi> then I'll advance firſt, <hi>Brazen</hi> will follow in half an Hour, and you will bring up the Rear in another; ſo, Gentlemen, Good-morrow, Succeſs attend us.</q>—He rode off, and <hi>Brazen</hi> but reſted his proper Time.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0558800102:36"/>WHEN alone, <hi>Jack</hi> began to conſider this Affair more circumſpectly, but not with a Deſign of breaking his Engagement. The Fellow, who took Care of the Horſes, was no Stranger to the Expedition, and congratulated his new Maſter, on the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of making his Fortune. <q>
                     <hi>Tim, ſaid Jack,</hi> I have a Thought that will ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize my Friends; if you will aſſiſt me I'll give your a Crown for your Trouble.' —That I will, Maſter, <hi>anſwer'd Tim,</hi> and be true and faithful too.'— 'Well, then, <hi>ſaid Jack,</hi> take my Horſe, and ride a little beyond the Church at <hi>Hounſlow,</hi> and wait for me; you may depend I ſhan't keep you long. When you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver me the Horſe, go directly acroſs the Heath.</q> — <hi>Tim</hi> promis'd to obey his Orders, and ſet forwards.</p>
               <p>TWO odd Circumſtances happen'd to <hi>Jack.</hi> He very fortunately knew the Name of a Family that liv'd juſt by <hi>Hounſlow,</hi> of which he intended to make a proper Uſe; and the Old Great Coat which he found in his Trunk, he had made into a <hi>Surtout,</hi> and was then on his Back. This Coat was of that Sort of Cloath that is one Side Scarlet, and the other Blue; it was ſingle, and not lined. This Day the Blue was outſide, and the Sleeves turn'd up,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0558800102:37"/>
made Scarlet Cuffs. Thus dreſs'd, he walk'd to <hi>Piccadilly,</hi> and took a Poſt-Chaiſe to <hi>Hounſlow,</hi> where he arrived at Ten o'Clock. With great Civility he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of Mrs. <hi>Day</hi> about the Family he ſaid he was going to viſit. He call'd for a Gill of Wine, and the good Woman an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd all his Queſtions, which were ſuch, as made her imagine he was a Relation of the Family, and had juſt come from Abroad. He hinted, that perhaps he might ſtay there a Week, or return in an Hour, when he'd be glad of a Poſt-Chaiſe ready for <hi>London.</hi> Mrs. <hi>Day</hi> aſſuring him he ſhould have one at a Moment's Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he walk'd forward tho' with a troubled Mind, and ſoon found his Horſe. When <hi>Tim</hi> had march'd off, he turn'd his <hi>Surtout,</hi> and was now in Scarlet, with Blue Sleeves.</p>
               <p>HE rode on about three Miles, and met with his Friends, who began to be in ſome Pain about him.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Z—ds, <hi>ſaid Smart,</hi> what the Devil kept you ſo long?—but we have no Time to talk, for the Coach is at Hand. You are to keep the Poſtillion and Coachman in Awe; <hi>Brazen</hi> will do the ſame with the Servants, and let me alone for <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing</hi> with the Paſſengers. When the Jobb's over, let's ſeparate, and meet at our Lodging.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0558800102:38"/>THEY had no Time for further Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, for the Coach drew near.— Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage! <hi>cry'd Smart,</hi> and all rode briſkly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.—<hi>Jack</hi> did his Duty with the Poſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion;—The Servants, making a Reſiſtance, received a Fire from <hi>Brazen,</hi> which did no Harm; but the Compliment was inſtantly return'd, and poor <hi>Brazen</hi> fell from his Horſe. Whilſt this was doing, <hi>Smart</hi> attack'd the Coach, but a Gentleman in it, with great Reſolution, ſo nimbly, and with ſuch Strength, turn'd his Wriſt, that the Piſtol went off in the Air, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately one of the Servants rode up, and knock'd him down.</p>
               <p>JACK, finding two Wings of his Army taken Priſoners, was determin'd to ſave the Remainder by a ſpeedy Flight. The Gentlemen and Servants were ſo buſy about <hi>Smart</hi> and <hi>Brazen,</hi> that he was not purſu'd, but got near <hi>Hounſlow</hi> in a ſhort Time.— His former Caution had now its Uſe; for tying his Horſe to a Tree, a little out of the Road, he once more turn'd his Coat, and walk'd leiſurely on to the Inn. With a tolerable Coolneſs of Temper, he deſir'd a Poſt-Chaiſe; but accidentally a Horſe was wanting, which obliged him to wait a full half Hour, which, no doubt, he thought was half an Age. He ſummon'd
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0558800102:39"/>
all his Reſolution to avoid Suſpicion, and talk'd to Mrs. <hi>Day</hi> about the Family he had viſited. His Chaiſe was juſt ready when Mr. <hi>Day</hi> enter'd.—<q>There, now, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> is two fine Gentlemen that have made a noble <hi>Kettle of Fiſh</hi> of it this Morning.' — 'Bleſs me, my Dear, <hi>ſaid Mrs. Day,</hi> what's the Matter? — Not much, <hi>reply'd her Huſband,</hi> only a Coach was ſtopp'd on the Heath by three High-waymen, and two of 'em <hi>is</hi> taken, and now at next Inn.'—'Dear Sirs, <hi>ſaid Mrs. Day,</hi> 'tis the moſt <hi>prepoſterouſteſt</hi> Thing <hi>in Life,</hi> that Gentlefolks won't travel in <hi>Poſt Chaiſeſes,</hi> and then they're always ſafe from theſe Fellows.'—'Well, well, <hi>ſaid her Huſband,</hi> I muſt ſend after the <hi>Third</hi> who eſcap'd; I'll engage to find out his <hi>Scarlet Coat</hi> before Night.'— Were it not, <hi>ſaid Mrs. Day,</hi> that theſe poor Creatures <hi>pay</hi> for being Taken, I am <hi>ſure and certain</hi> my Huſband would never trouble his Head about them; becauſe, you know, Sir, one of the Gang will <hi>peach,</hi> and then the others <hi>hang</hi> of Courſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>WHAT were the Emotions of <hi>Jack</hi>'s Soul, cannot be expreſs'd. He felt Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies that all his former Diſtreſſes had never plung'd him into; but, recollecting his
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0558800102:40"/>
Situation, he chim'd in with Mrs. <hi>Day,</hi> and ſpoke greatly againſt the Diſturbers of the Publick.—At laſt, he took his Leave of Mrs. <hi>Day,</hi> mounted his Chaiſe, and got ſafe to <hi>London,</hi> but often thought the Horſes were very bad.</p>

               <p>GUILT is a <hi>Fiend,</hi> that ſeizing the Conſcience, becomes a Tyrant over every Idea of Man. <hi>Remorſe</hi> is his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, and <hi>Suſpicion</hi> and <hi>Fear</hi> conſtantly purſue his Steps. <hi>Diſquietude</hi> engroſſes every Thought, and even his ſleeping Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination is fill'd with Dread and Horror. —Our poor Hero is now an Object of the greateſt Compaſſion.—He knew not whom
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0558800102:41"/>
to truſt, where to fly for Safety, or how to <hi>live;</hi> and he had now diſcover'd that he was very unfit to <hi>die.</hi>—He got to his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and telling the Barber that he was engaged to a Gentleman at <hi>Hampſtead,</hi> he paid a Week's Rent, call'd a Coach, and drove, with his Effects, to an Inn in <hi>South-wark.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>NOT ſecure in ſo publick a Place, he found out a poor Widow in a neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Village, with whom he agreed for Diet and Lodging. Here he was ſafe and quiet, had his anxious Thoughts permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him any Repoſe. A Fortnight paſs'd, and he paid the poor Woman very punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually. She began to conceive a very great Opinion of Mr. <hi>Conyers,</hi> as his whole De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment was very regular and decent. His Mind now grew ſomewhat more calm, and his Sleep was leſs diſturb'd, for he moſt ſincerely repented of his Folly and Wickedneſs, and with great Fervency and Devotion, confeſs'd his manifold Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, and humbly pray'd for <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Forgiveneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HIS Purſe was extremely low. He had Thoughts of applying to ſome People he knew, but durſt not venture to <hi>London;</hi> and his Landlady was ſo poor, ſhe could not afford to give him Credit.—He almoſt
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0558800102:42"/>
determin'd to break his Promiſe to Mr. <hi>Johnſton,</hi> and write to <hi>Lord Truegood,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Kindly;</hi> but as he knew not what Apology to make for deferring it ſo long, or how to account for his Conduct, he was obliged to lay the Thought aſide, at leaſt for the preſent.—He frequently wept moſt bitterly, and bewail'd his wretched Condition. The Agitation of his Mind affected his Health, and threw him into a dangerous Fever. The poor Woman was extremely tender and careful of him, but his <hi>Soul</hi> wanting as ſalutary Remedies as his <hi>Body,</hi> he begg'd that a Clergyman might be ſent for; and <hi>Doctor St. Amour,</hi> Miniſter of the Pariſh, attended on the firſt Notice. This Gentleman was one of thoſe who reproach many of his Profeſſion, for he was <hi>pious</hi> without <hi>Moroſeneſs,</hi> and <hi>charitable</hi> without <hi>Oſtentation. Jack,</hi> tho' extremely weak, politely thank'd the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor for his Condeſcenſion in viſiting ſo <hi>poor,</hi> ſo <hi>wretched,</hi> ſo <hi>miſerable</hi> a Being. — The good Man, with an eaſy Countenance, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd.—<q>If your Situation, Sir, is ſo bad, I think you require, and have a natural Right to my more <hi>immediate</hi> and <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Attention.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>THE Doctor pray'd by him in the true Spirit of Devotion. His Exhortations
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0558800102:43"/>
were ſo fill'd with Chriſtian Eloquence, as warm'd and chear'd the Heart of <hi>Conyers,</hi> and inſenſibly lighten'd his Burthens.— The Fever ſtill continued, and the Doctor never fail'd his Morning and Evening Viſits.— <hi>Jack</hi> was ſo charm'd, that he open'd his whole Soul to this good Man, and hid not the minuteſt Part of all his Affairs ſince his Return from <hi>France.</hi>—The Gentleman flatter'd not his <hi>Sins,</hi> neither did he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to affright him with the diſmal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of <hi>endleſs Miſery.</hi> He ſkilfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed and cleanſed his <hi>Wounds,</hi> and then pour'd in the Balſam of <hi>Peace, Comfort,</hi> and Hopes of Pardon by <hi>Repentance,</hi> and a Newneſs of Life.—Had Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> been acquainted with <hi>one Man</hi> of Dr. <hi>St. Amour</hi>'s Character, I apprehend he would not have ſaid, that <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Roguery go together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN one of theſe Converſations, <hi>Jack</hi> took an Opportunity of mentioning the Promiſe he made to Mr. <hi>Kindly</hi> when he gave him the ſmall Box, as ſpoken of in a former Chapter. — <q>I am now, Sir, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> ſo poor, ſo indigent, that I think I may ſafely open the Preſent; but I am ſo fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that I muſt beg your Aſſiſtance.</q> The <hi>Doctor</hi> found the Box in the Trunk, and open'd it by the Bed-ſide.—He pull'd out a Quantity of Straw, and, at laſt, a
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0558800102:44"/>
Sheet of Paper which he read, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained theſe Words.</p>

               <p>AS the Doctor read, <hi>Jack</hi> wept. The good Man could not avoid ſympathizing, and with ſtreaming Eyes, purſued the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of the Poſtſcript; but when he open'd a Paper nicely roll'd, and threw <hi>Twenty Guineas</hi> on the Table, poor <hi>Jack</hi> attempted to ſpeak, but his Tongue faulter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he fainted on his Pillow. With ſome Difficulty he recover'd, and a violent Fit of Crying enſu'd.—<q>Yes, <hi>cry'd he,</hi> I will obey my <hi>Father,</hi> my <hi>Friend,</hi> and my <hi>Guardian Angel!</hi> Oh Sir! What has not this moſt worthy Man done for me! — He <hi>ſaved</hi> me when an <hi>Infant,</hi> and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves</hi> me when a <hi>Man.</hi> Good God! Can I be ungrateful to his Hopes?—Can
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0558800102:46"/>
I diſregard his charitable Inſtructions?— No! If Heaven prolongs my Days, they ſhall be employ'd in <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Honour.'</hi> Your Reſolution, <hi>ſaid Dr. St. Amour,</hi> is truly juſt, and I pray God to keep you firm in it, but this preſent Mark of his Bounty, is not the only one you have lately received.—His Providence has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd you from the ſhameful, infamous <hi>Death</hi> that your <hi>Hounſlow</hi> Companions ſuffer'd laſt Week. I have enquir'd par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly into that Affair, and find you have nothing to dread. A third Perſon was indeed ſpoken of at the Tryal, but the Name of <hi>Conſtant</hi> or <hi>Conyers</hi> was never mention'd. Let this ſuffice to eaſe your Mind.—Follow Mr. <hi>Kindly</hi>'s Advice, and be happy!</q>
               </p>
               <p>WHEN alone, he ſhudder'd and wept at the Fate of <hi>Smart</hi> and <hi>Brazen.</hi> He reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the dreadful Conſequences of lawleſs Purſuits. He traced back his own Life and wicked Conduct, and found, that <hi>one Vice</hi> generates another; that as they grow in Strength; they corrupt the Heart by Degrees, until the <hi>whole Man</hi> is ſwallow'd up in Debauchery, and his Name and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> eraz'd out of the Volume of the World. —<q>How fatal, <hi>continued he,</hi> is the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Evil! and who can foreſee the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0558800102:47"/>
End?—We go on from Step to Step re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs of Danger. <hi>We walk on Fire cover'd with Aſhes.</hi> No Thought, no Prudence guides. We dream of <hi>Pleaſure</hi> and <hi>Delight,</hi> but, too often, awake in the Gulph of <hi>Sorrow</hi> and <hi>Perdition!</hi> — How few, like me, have prov'd an almoſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Eſcape, and what Thanks, what <hi>Gratitude</hi> do I not owe for my Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance!</q>—His Reflections were very juſt and moving, and he promis'd to himſelf an entire Change of Conduct.</p>
               <p>HIS Spirits began to revive, and in a few Days the Fever left him. He thank'd the Apothecary, and deſir'd his Bill, but the good <hi>Doctor St. Amour</hi> had been before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand with him. So generous was this Gentleman, that he would not permit him to mention that, or any other Obligation he lay under.—<q>All I now want, <hi>ſaid the Doctor,</hi> is to ſee you quite recovered, and then we ſhall think of ſomewhat for your Service.</q>— In a Week he was perfectly well, tho' a little Pale, and when neatly dreſs'd, the <hi>Doctor</hi> was ſurpris'd at his comely Appearance.—At laſt he propos'd an Employment to <hi>Jack,</hi> which, he ſaid, he knew he could diſcharge extremely well. —<q>
                     <hi>Sir John Curious, continued he,</hi> wants a young Man, like you, to read to him,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0558800102:48"/>
and keep his private Accounts. I have ſatisfied him as to your Abilities, and he is willing to give you <hi>thirty Pounds</hi> a Year. He is very old, rich and gouty, and ſometimes peeviſh, but a Man muſt bear with the Infirmities of Superiors.</q> He then proceeded in a very uſeful Lecture on a moral and political Conduct.—<hi>Conyers</hi> return'd him many Acknowledgements, and in two Days he took a grateful Adieu of the good Widow, and fix'd in <hi>London</hi> with the Family of <hi>Sir John Curious.</hi>

               <p>NEVER Man began an Employment with more Pleaſure. He ſeem'd as if return'd again into Life, and was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd to ſpare no Pains in enjoying it.— His firſt Care was a particular Attention to his Duty, and his next was to find out the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0558800102:49"/>
Family Oeconomy, that he might adapt himſelf to their different Tempers.</p>
               <p>SIR JOHN CURIOUS was Sixty-ſeven Years of Age, very corpulent, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely infirm. When his Gout was not violent, he din'd with his Company, and was very chearful. From Seven to Nine at Night, <hi>Jack</hi> read to him; at Ten he went to Bed, but never roſe till about Eleven next Morning. Two Servants at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended him, and about One o'Clock, all his Flannels were remov'd, and in an old embroider'd Coat and great Wig, he ſat in his Arm-Chair, and <hi>Jack</hi> did the Duty of his Office till Three o'Clock.—He did SIR ROBERT WALPOLE the Honour of being his Enemy, and look'd on the <hi>Craftſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> equal, if not ſuperior to <hi>Holy Writ,</hi> conſequently theſe Papers were every Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment quoted. In this Choice of Books he had great Judgment, and to ſhew it fully, he delighted in the Works of TAYLOR the <hi>Water Poet;</hi> in an old and only Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of DUBARTUS; in huge Folios of <hi>Heraldry;</hi> and when inclin'd to Sleep, in the modern Pamphlets and weekly Papers.</p>
               <p>HIS Houſe-Steward had a good Salary, and a certain Quarterly Sum for providing all Things for the Family. This Sum was accounted for, but could not be exceeded.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0558800102:50"/>
To examine, and checque theſe Accounts, was part of <hi>Jack</hi>'s Duty.</p>
               <p>SIR JOHN had always maintain'd the Character of <hi>A fine Gentleman.</hi> His Dreſs was gay, and his Manner ſuch, that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported the Dignity he aſſum'd. It was a Queſtion, whether <hi>Pride</hi> or <hi>Avarice</hi> had the Superiority in his Conſtitution, but it is certain, they frequently acted in concert. <hi>Pride</hi> obliged him to a Punctuality in pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Debts, but <hi>Avarice</hi> prevented his going a Step beyond it.—<hi>Pride</hi> made him extremely <hi>Courteous, Complaiſant</hi> and <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious,</hi> becauſe he lov'd to be ſo treated himſelf, but <hi>Avarice</hi> ſtopp'd his Ears againſt the Cries of the <hi>Poor,</hi> expell'd every Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Charity and Benevolence, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted and abridg'd ſome of his <hi>Vices,</hi> even when he had the Power of being <hi>Vicious.</hi> In a Word, <hi>Sir John</hi> had a <hi>Negative Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,</hi> and acquir'd the Title of <hi>a good Sort of Man;</hi> that is, his Vices were not <hi>many,</hi> but he had not a <hi>ſingle Virtue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HE had ſeen enough of <hi>one</hi> Part of the World to convince him that there was no ſuch Thing as a <hi>modeſt Woman.</hi> This happy Imagination kept him a Batchelor, till, at the Age of Sixty-three, <hi>Love,</hi> or ſome other <hi>Monoſyllable,</hi> ſtumbled into his Head. —The Charms of <hi>Miſs Bridoon,</hi> his Sadler's
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0558800102:51"/>
Daughter, made him ſo generous as to propoſe a Marriage and relinquiſh a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. Whilſt this Treaty was on Foot, his Relations interpos'd, and ſome of his moſt intimate Friends ſpoke pretty freely about it. They ſaid, <q>It was highly pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in him to marry, but begg'd he would conſider his Age and the Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties growing on him. That a Girl of <hi>Eighteen</hi> was quite out of the Rule of Proportion. That a <hi>Mechanick's</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was unworthy his <hi>Rank</hi> and Fortune, and an <hi>Indignity</hi> to his Family. That no one could anſwer for the Conduct of a young Girl, eſpecially one of low Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and begg'd him to turn his Eyes on ſome Lady, whoſe <hi>Years</hi> would Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantee her Virtue, and make him happy in a faithful Companion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>OONS, cry'd the <hi>Knight,</hi> what the Plague would you be at? I tell you, my Age is no Impediment, for I find myſelf as vigorous as at Twenty. If Children, <hi>not my own,</hi> inherit my <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Eſtate,</hi> is it not the Practice of every Day? Is it not much better than the Heathen Scheme of Adoption?—The Honour of my Family, which my <hi>virtuous Siſter</hi> makes ſuch a Noiſe about, is a Farce, and I ſuppoſe ſhe thought ſo, when ſhe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0558800102:52"/>
ran away with my Father's Footman. Does ſhe imagine, that the Son of ſuch a Scoundrel ſhall enjoy my Fortune?— Then as to a <hi>virtuous Wife,</hi> I know the World too well to expect ſuch a one, but I likewiſe know, that I had rather have <hi>a Part</hi> in a <hi>young Wench,</hi> than the <hi>Whole</hi> of any <hi>old Woman</hi> breathing.</q>—In ſhort, <hi>Sir John</hi> was reſolute, or rather, poſitive. <hi>Miſs Bridoon</hi> was advanc'd to his Bed, and <hi>Conſummatum eſt, rang through the Pariſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>LADY CURIOUS was extremely pretty. Her Eyes ſpoke, and her great Vivacity and Sprightlineſs had attractive Qualities. —An Houſe magnificently furniſh'd.—A Number of Servants, with Coach, Chariot, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were ſo infinitely beyond her Hopes, that her little Head began to turn. Her Conſtitution and Soil were ſo good, that the ſeeds of Example grew up ſurprizingly faſt, and afforded a plentiful Crop of the moſt <hi>faſhionable Follies.</hi> In a ſhort Time, ſhe had contracted a Variety of Acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and vaſtly improv'd in modern Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs.—<hi>Plays, Operas</hi> and <hi>Viſits,</hi> went a conſtant Round, and <hi>Drums, Routs</hi> and <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> employ'd her Time, at Home and Abroad. She had a Paſſion for <hi>Play,</hi> and play'd <hi>very deep.</hi> Here, indeed, her low Birth was conſpicuous, for, not being
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0558800102:53"/>
educated from her Childhood, like <hi>other Ladies</hi> of Quality, in the true Principles of <hi>Gaming,</hi> ſhe made but a ſmall Progreſs in that Science, and play'd <hi>ſo ill,</hi> and loſt <hi>ſo much Money,</hi> that her charming Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany was greatly courted and admir'd.</p>
               <p>SIR JOHN was very indifferent about theſe Matters. He allow'd her <hi>two hundred Pounds</hi> a Year as Pin-Money, but was ſo rigid and exact, that no Art, nor all her <hi>Ladyſhip's</hi> Contrivances, could extract a Shilling more. — <hi>Conyers</hi> knew of large Sums loſt at Cards, and was ſurprized how her Ladyſhip could anſwer ſo many Demands; but at laſt he diſcover'd, that her <hi>Play-Purſe</hi> was <hi>inexhauſtible.</hi>—Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Multitude of Affairs, and the Variety of Employments on her Hands, ſhe found a Time to preſent to <hi>Sir John</hi> a Brace of <hi>fine Boys.</hi> Her Ladyſhip was <hi>Happy,</hi> the old Knight was <hi>Content,</hi> and Family Affairs went on with great Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
               <p>IN about three Months <hi>Conyers</hi> pick'd out this Information from the Steward, and Mrs. <hi>Sieve,</hi> her Ladyſhip's Woman. This laſt threw in ſome <hi>Nods, Winks,</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuendos,</hi> but the Honour of her Lady was always ſacred. Mrs. <hi>Sieve</hi> conceived a good Opinion of <hi>Jack,</hi> and on many Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0558800102:54"/>
gave him Proofs of her Eſteem.— He had felt the fatal Effects of ſuch Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and was determin'd to avoid every Temptation.—He ſhunn'd her Preſence as much as poſſible, and even ſlighted her Favours.—His Conduct was ſuch an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front to her <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Beauty,</hi> that ſhe ſhifted Sides, and became an implacable Enemy.</p>
               <p>THIS kind Creature had laid many Schemes to prepoſſeſs her Lady againſt <hi>Jack.</hi> She inſinuated, that his Impudence had not only dar'd to make Attempts on her <hi>Virtue,</hi> but had even mutter'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on her Ladyſhip. — Fir'd at his Inſolence, my Lady determin'd to have him immediately kicked out, but the artful <hi>Sieve</hi> begg'd of her Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip not to <hi>diſparage</hi> herſelf ſo much as to ſpeak of ſuch an Affair, but to <hi>worm the the Fellow out by Degrees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Reſolution being taken, my Lady never ceaſed teizing <hi>Sir John</hi> till he grew peeviſh.—Mrs. <hi>Sieve</hi> affronted <hi>Jack</hi> openly, and the <hi>Steward</hi> treated him with great Impertinence. <hi>Conyers</hi> found a very viſible Change in the Countenances of the whole Family, and was made very uneaſy in his Duty, but knew not what to aſcribe it to.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0558800102:55"/>
—One Evening, <hi>Sir John</hi> uſed him a little harſhly, but the Humility of <hi>Jack</hi> ſpoke much in his Favour, and oblig'd the <hi>Knight,</hi> with ſome good Humour, to aſk him, <hi>What he had done to my Lady and her Woman?</hi>— I proteſt, Sir, ſaid <hi>Jack,</hi> I have done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. — <q>Nothing! <hi>cry'd Sir John,</hi> Nay then I know your Crime; you can never be forgiven.—Oons! a <hi>Handſome</hi> Fellow of your Age in ſuch a Family as this, and do <hi>Nothing!</hi> — Thou art a ſilly Blockhead, and I am ſorry for it, but, <hi>Travel</hi> you muſt; however, I'm deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd you ſhall ſtay till I get you another <hi>Service,</hi> and have one in your Place.</q>
               </p>
               <p>JACK had been ſo accuſtom'd to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments, that he bore this with great Temper and Reſignation. He inform'd his Friend <hi>Dr. St. Amour</hi> of this Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and told him what was the Occaſion of it, which he had learn'd from the Houſe-Maid. The good Man lifted up his Eyes, begg'd of him to have Patience, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to look out for a more agreeable Employment.</p>
               <p>SOME Days after, <hi>Conyers</hi> was buſy with <hi>Sir John</hi> when Mr. <hi>Sampſon</hi> enter'd. The <hi>Knight</hi> had a great Regard for this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and was extremely Civil to him. <q>Well, Friend <hi>Sampſon, ſaid he,</hi> Time was,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0558800102:56"/>
when we us'd to meet oftner, but this plaguy Gout makes me perform a tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Quarentine you ſee.'—'Ah, <hi>Sir John, reply'd</hi> Mr. <hi>Sampſon,</hi> you are at Anchor in a ſafe Harbour, but I have all your Ailments, and am buffetted about in ſtormy Winds. — 'Not ſo, not ſo, <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd the Knight,</hi> I hope my old Friend and Acquaintance is in no Danger of Shipwreck.—No Misfortunes I hope.'— None, ſaid Mr. <hi>Sampſon,</hi> but what my Temper can bear.—I have loſt my only Child, juſt ſuch a Youth as that, <hi>(point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Jack.)</hi> I have loſt the beſt Part of my Subſtance by the War, and I have found <hi>old Age</hi> and <hi>Infirmities.</hi>—But, is it not juſt, I ſhould reſign with Patience what I enjoy'd and held but at the Will of the Donor?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>MR. SAMPSON, ſaid <hi>Sir John,</hi> you were always a Philoſopher, but I am really concern'd at your Misfortunes. Perhaps ſome Money, at this Time, may have its Uſe, and I wiſh it was in my Power to aſſiſt you, but, really my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily is ſo expenſive, that I am quite poor at preſent. I wiſh I had ſeen you laſt Week, for, 'tis but two Days ago ſince I parted with all my ready Money on a Mortgage.—Truly I am angry at
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0558800102:57"/>
your not acquainting me with your Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes—Indeed I am — and you know the Pleaſure I take in aſſiſting my wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Friends.'—'You are extremely good, <hi>reply'd</hi> Mr. <hi>Sampſon,</hi> but, thank God, I am in no want. When my <hi>Debts</hi> are collected, which are very numerous, I ſhall have more than ſufficient to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain my dear Wife and I, in a comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Manner. Indeed I am ill able to attend my Friends, and much want an honeſt <hi>young Fellow</hi> to aſſiſt me.'—'I believe, <hi>ſaid Sir John,</hi> I am pretty deep in your Books. — The laſt Chriſtening con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd a deal of Wine; but if you have the Bill, I ſhall ſee and diſcharge it.</q>— Mr. <hi>Sampſon</hi> thank'd the <hi>Knight,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd one hundred and forty Pounds, for which <hi>Jack</hi> drew a Receipt for him to ſign. —<q>I proteſt, Sir, <hi>ſaid the Merchant,</hi> your young Man writes a charming Hand, and I dare ſay underſtands Accounts.'— That he does, <hi>anſwer'd Sir John,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely well. He is <hi>honeſt, ſober,</hi> and <hi>diligent,</hi> and I heartily wiſh you had his Equal. What will you give me, Mr. <hi>Sampſon,</hi> if I aſſign him over to you, provided he conſents?—I ſhall give you, <hi>anſwer'd the other,</hi> my ſincere Thanks, and the young Man the beſt Uſage in
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0558800102:58"/>
my Power.'—'In two Words, <hi>reply'd the Knight,</hi> I know of no Fault he has, but being <hi>too virtuous</hi> and <hi>modeſt</hi> for my good Family. My Lady's Maid has ſet my Lady againſt him. I know their Tricks, but I don't mind them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>SOME Queſtions paſs'd, and in leſs than half an Hour the Affair was concluded on. — <hi>Jack</hi> received fifteen Pounds for ſix Months Wages, and wiſhing Sir <hi>John</hi> all Happineſs, once more ſhifted his Station.</p>

               <p>HE was once more happy. He had a Pleaſure from the Countenance of Mr. <hi>Sampſon,</hi> which was open and free, with every Indication of an honeſt and tender Heart. Mrs. <hi>Sampſon</hi> could not refrain a few Tears at the Sight of <hi>Conyers,</hi> for it happen'd that he much reſembled her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Son. She view'd him with Pleaſure, but it was mix'd with Anxiety. She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded him as a <hi>Child,</hi> and he reſpected her as a <hi>Parent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN his Employment he was extremely aſſiduous and careful, and went on very ſucceſsfully in collecting Mr. <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s Debts, and ſettling his Accounts. The good Man was happy; for <hi>Conyers,</hi> as much as poſſible, made all Things eaſy to him. In a ſhort Time he acquir'd their Favour and Confidence, and was perfectly fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar.—The <hi>Boy,</hi> the <hi>very young Man</hi> was quite over. His Thoughts were ſerious, but he acted with Vigour. His Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was decent, and his Converſation chearful and agreeable.

               <p>MRS. <hi>Sampſon</hi> and her Siſter had been Coheireſſes, and had each an Eſtate in *******, of about <hi>Five hundred Pounds</hi> a Year. The Siſter had been married to Mr. <hi>Gold,</hi> a <hi>Turkey</hi> Merchant, who died about four Years ſince, and added <hi>Fifteen thouſand Pounds</hi> to her Fortune. Mrs. <hi>Gold</hi> was near Thirty-ſeven Years of Age, of a noble Preſence, with great <hi>good Nature</hi> and <hi>Prudence.</hi> She continued a Widow in Spite of many Sollicitations, and ſo affectionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lov'd her Siſter, that ſhe remov'd her Habitation to be nearer to her. When Mr. <hi>Sampſon</hi> was in Diſtreſs with his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, Mrs. <hi>Gold</hi> advanc'd him <hi>Six thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds</hi> on his and her Siſter's Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>THE Siſters were almoſt conſtantly with each other, and <hi>Conyers</hi> was always of the Party.—Mrs. <hi>Gold</hi> had <hi>read,</hi> and had an excellent Underſtanding. Mrs. <hi>Sampſon</hi> was a chearful and agreeable Companion. — Her Huſband had ſolid Senſe, and great good Humour; and <hi>Conyers</hi> enliven'd the Converſation by a thouſand pleaſant Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, but with ſuch natural Elegance and Beauty, that greatly pleas'd, improv'd and diverted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:0558800102:64"/>SOMETIMES their Entertainment was of a ſerious Nature, and fell on the Follies of the World; — The mad <hi>Extravagance</hi> of ſome, and the equally mad <hi>Penury</hi> of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.—On <hi>Juſtice, Virtue, Charity,</hi> and the like. — Mrs. <hi>Gold</hi> ſpoke on theſe Heads with great Strength of Reaſon, and Mr. <hi>Conyers</hi> enforced her Arguments by ſundry hiſtorical Paſſages, and by Accidents to which he had been Witneſs. He was a Maſter of the Subject, and, at different Times, went through the <hi>moral</hi> and <hi>ſocial Duties,</hi> with ſuch Spirit and Force, that they were charm'd with his Knowledge, and edified by his Words.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>HAPPY would it be, <hi>ſaid Mrs. Gold,</hi> if all Mankind thought like Mr. <hi>Conyers.'</hi>— And ſtill more ſo, <hi>reply'd her Siſter,</hi> if they <hi>acted</hi> like him, for I verily believe he practiſes his own Doctrine.'—'Madam, <hi>anſwer'd Conyers,</hi> I am extremely happy in your good Opinion; but permit me to ſay, tho' I endeavour, and I hope, do my Duty as I ought, yet I have greatly err'd. I have been <hi>idle;</hi> I have been <hi>extravagant,</hi> and, I ſpeak it to my Shame, I have been <hi>vicious;</hi> but the Goodneſs of this Family ſtrengthens my Reſolution, and confirms me in my honeſt Purpoſes of Amendment.'—'If,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0558800102:65"/>
                     <hi>reply'd Mrs. Gold,</hi> you have been crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, your Confeſſion and Repentance en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes your Worth.'—'Who has not been criminal? <hi>ſaid Mr. Sampſon.</hi> — To commit a Fault is bad, but to perſevere is <hi>infamous.</hi> For aught I know, <hi>Vice</hi> has its Uſe, as it ſets off and heightens the Beauties of <hi>Virtue</hi> to ſuch a Degree, that <hi>Common Senſe,</hi> and even <hi>Ignorance,</hi> muſt be charm'd with it.—'Mr. <hi>Conyers, ſaid Mrs. Gold,</hi> has one Virtue which I wiſh was a little more general. Tho' he has been ſo good, agreeably to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain us with <hi>Perſons</hi> and <hi>Things,</hi> yet has he never dropp'd an harſh Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion againſt <hi>Particulars,</hi> nor has he given Matters an ill natur'd Conſtruction.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>SCANDAL, Madam, <hi>ſaid Conyers,</hi> let it inhabit where it will, is a <hi>mean</hi> and <hi>vulgar Vice.</hi> It is a <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>vile</hi> At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to raiſe our own Reputation on the Ruins of another. When ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Actions of a Man, and paint his Conduct in odious Colours, do they not at the ſame Time modeſtly intimate, that <hi>They are incapable of ſuch Errors?— Pride</hi> ſpeaks; not their Pity. To com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate the <hi>Frailties</hi> and <hi>Weakneſſes</hi> of a <hi>Man,</hi> is the <hi>Duty</hi> of a <hi>Man.</hi> It is his Office to ſet him Right by Tenderneſs
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0558800102:66"/>
and Humanity, and not by Reproach and Slander to lead him more aſtray. Should he continue in his Folly, the wiſeſt Maxim is, to commiſerate his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, and avoid an Imitation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>SOME Evenings they paſs'd their Time at Cards, and ſometimes the Ladies went to a Play, attended by <hi>Conyers.</hi> This gave Riſe to a Variety of pleaſant Chat, where <hi>Jack</hi> ſhew'd his Memory and good Taſte, but it was a conſiderable Time before they diſcover'd he had an excellent Voice. Mrs. <hi>Gold</hi> was fond of Muſick, and he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming a favourite Air,—<q>Bleſs me, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> I proteſt you have it quite perfect,—we muſt inſiſt on your Singing it out.</q>—He made a few Apologies but obey'd.—This was what the Family did not expect, and increaſed their Surprize and Pleaſure.—By degrees he ſhew'd his Skill in the <hi>French</hi> Language, — that he was no Stranger to <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> and that he underſtood <hi>Dancing, Fencing</hi> and <hi>Horſemanſhip.</hi> In a Word, he ſhew'd them what a Gentleman <hi>ought</hi> to be.</p>
               <p>THE Behaviour of <hi>Conyers</hi> puzzled Mrs. <hi>Gold.</hi>—She could not conceive how a Man in his Station could acquire ſo many <hi>genteel Accompliſhments.</hi> She thought there was a Myſtery in it, and when ſhe had juſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0558800102:67"/>
to find it out, <q>Lord bleſs me, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> why ſhould I trouble myſelf about what is not my Concern?</q> At that Inſtant ſhe felt a prodigious Fluſhing in her Face, and ſome Senſations ſhe had not been lately accuſtom'd to. She began to ſuſpect the Cauſe, and with great Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſat down to examine her <hi>Heart,</hi> and <hi>reaſon</hi> with herſelf, — that is — to find out Reaſons to correſpond with her Inclinations. The Truth is, ſhe diſcover'd ſo many, that <hi>Intereſt</hi> and the <hi>Pride of Family,</hi> were fairly routed, and <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Eſteem</hi> got the better. She would not call it <hi>Love,</hi> as ſhe thought it a too ſenſual Term for one of her Years. She own'd ſhe regarded the <hi>Virtues</hi> and <hi>Qualifications</hi> of Mr. <hi>Conyers,</hi> but the <hi>Comelineſs</hi> of his Perſon was merely accidental, and quite out of the Queſtion. However, that Contingent and his <hi>Youth</hi> had certainly <hi>ſome</hi> Weight.</p>
               <p>BE this as it will, her Reſolution was taken, but determin'd not to proceed too raſhly. On a certain Day, when ſhe knew her Siſter would not ſtir out, ſhe wrote her a Card, and begg'd Mr. <hi>Conyers</hi> might be ſent to take care of her to the Play, where ſhe was engaged with ſome Company. <hi>Jack</hi> dreſs'd himſelf properly, and waited on Mrs. <hi>Gold.</hi> He had no Schemes in
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0558800102:68"/>
View, ſo his Actions were <hi>Free,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reſerve. He had a great Regard for the Widow, which made him fond of every Opportunity of obliging her. Perhaps ſhe had obſerved this, and gave it a flattering Conſtruction. He found her moſt neatly dreſs'd, and, for the firſt Time, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly remark'd her Charms.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I AM quite aſham'd, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> to give Mr. <hi>Conyers</hi> ſo much Trouble for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Our Party is broke, but rather than miſs the <hi>Conſcious Lovers,</hi> I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd to beg your Company alone, had not Mrs. <hi>Talkative</hi> and her <hi>Daughter</hi> ſent Word, they'd drink Tea with me.</q>— <hi>Conyers</hi> ſaid, he was ſorry ſhe was diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, but rejoiced at every Occaſion that could ſhew his Readineſs in obeying her Commands. A few Words paſs'd, and he attempted to take his Leave, which ſhe would not permit. <q>After all, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> we can be as well at Home, and my Brother will not expect you till after the Play.</q> A Converſation then began on the Comedy, and many Remarks were made on the odd Situation of <hi>Indiana,</hi> and the noble Conſtancy of <hi>Bevil.</hi> A loud Rap at the Door ſpoke the Arrival of Mrs. and Miſs <hi>Talkative,</hi> and ſtopp'd their Proceedings.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:0558800102:69"/>A NEW Field now open'd. In a ſhort Time all the Tittle-tattle of the Pariſh was diſplay'd. Lord, Mrs. <hi>Gold, you ſurpriſe me.—Not hear of this before!</hi> Not I indeed, Madam. <hi>Dear Madam, I purteſt I've for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got moſt of the Particlers, for the Story is four Days old.</hi> Very ſtrange indeed! <hi>Why, my dear, they were actually caught, but Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony ſalves all.</hi> This Sort of <hi>rational</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment laſted till Tea was produced, which a little eaſed the Thoughts of <hi>Conyers.</hi> He ſeem'd to bend his Eyes and Regard on Miſs <hi>Talkative,</hi> who was very pretty, and had began a Sort of Converſation. Mrs. <hi>Gold</hi> obſerved it; which added not to her Repoſe. She was ſo abſent, that her Tea-Cup ſlip'd from her Hand, and broke to Pieces, which broke off their Chat. Tea finiſh'd, ſhe put on a grave Air, and the Ladies put on their <hi>Capuchins,</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat their Evening Viſits.</p>
               <p>CONYERS, unwittingly, had like to have ſpoil'd all, but Mrs. <hi>Gold's</hi> hinting, <q>
                     <hi>One muſt be civil to ſuch Sort of People,</hi> gave him an Opportunity of ſaying, He won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd of what Uſe they were in the World. The Daughter, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> is pretty, but the eternal Clatter of her little Tongue will give ſome poor Man a great deal of Vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.' 'And yet, <hi>ſaid Mrs. Gold,</hi> her
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0558800102:70"/>
Fortune will get her a Huſband. You Men are all alike, and, I dare ſay, you would ſnap at her in an Inſtant, if you could.' 'I ſhall not, ſaid <hi>Jack,</hi> affirm or deny a Thing I have not thought about, for I neither know the Lady or her Fortune; but really, Madam, I think I ought to have been exempted in your general Cenſure. Were I capable of marrying merely for Money, the Situation I am in, and my Poverty, would excuſe me to the World, but who would excuſe me to my Conſcience? Who would give me Joy of an Equipage, when compell'd to take <hi>Pride, Affectation, Folly,</hi> and <hi>Non-ſenſe</hi> to my Arms? I may be ambitious, but, I aſſure you, Madam, poor as I am, I have not the leaſt <hi>Ambition</hi> of being <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>MRS. GOLD was not diſpleaſed at his Sentiments, and the Converſation turn'd on more diverting Subjects, tho' ſhe, at laſt, very dextrouſly contrived to bring <hi>Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> once more on the Carpet. <q>I own my Surprize, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> that a young Man of your Underſtanding has not found out <hi>one Woman</hi> capable of making you happy and eaſy. Such there are, but you are either too indolent or indifferent, or elſe your Heart is engaged to ſome diſtant

Fair One. — Come, Mr. <hi>Conyers,</hi> be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, and indulge a Curioſity our Sex is ſubject to, and recite your Adventures, for I am apt to believe they muſt be ſomewhat extraordinary. — 'In Truth, Madam, <hi>ſaid Conyers,</hi> they are not worth your Notice; but ſince you command, it is my Duty to obey.</q>
               </p>
               <p>HE then began a Narrative of his Life, and painted his Sufferings in a very moving Manner. He artfully avoided the Place of his Birth, or the leaſt Hint of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as it might occaſion Scandal. He carried her to the Weaver's in <hi>Spittlefields;</hi> conducted her to <hi>France,</hi> and brought her back to <hi>London.</hi> His <hi>Amours</hi> were very delicately handled, but his <hi>Hounſlow</hi> Expedition was quite expunged. He dwelt long on Mr. <hi>Kindly</hi>'s Inſtructions and Letter, and the Miſery he was in in <hi>Surry.</hi> His <hi>Hiſtory</hi> was long, and ſometimes ſo affecting, that Mrs. <hi>Gold</hi> was obliged to make frequent Uſe of her Handkerchief. <hi>She pity'd him becauſe he was unfortunate,</hi> and <hi>he</hi> began to <hi>love her, becauſe</hi> he ſaw <hi>ſhe pity'd him.</hi>—When he had ended, a profound Silence en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued.</p>

who has <hi>Power,</hi> and Inclination equal to it. Will you give me Leave to try my Skill? Permit me, Madam, <hi>ſaid Jack,</hi> to return my moſt humble Acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for your Goodneſs; but as you have required my Sincerity, I ſhall ſtill continue it, and with that honeſt Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom your good Senſe will excuſe. I have no Objections, Madam, to <hi>Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> and have a certain <hi>Conſtancy</hi> in my Nature, that might make me a <hi>good Huſband;</hi> but I cannot anſwer for my Temper, if I did not moſt affectionately <hi>love my Wife.</hi> To have that <hi>Love,</hi> I muſt know her, I muſt converſe with her; I muſt firſt <hi>admire</hi> her Virtues, and <hi>eſteem</hi> her Underſtanding. This, Madam, is not the Work of a Week, or a Month; and to marry otherwiſe, there is a Poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of being <hi>happy,</hi> but the Chances are infinitely againſt me.

not how or what to anſwer.</q> She ſaw him confuſed, and added,—<q>I ſhall make it plainer. Suppoſe for Argument-Sake, I ſhould have ſuch a Notion in my Head, —Do you think you could truly and ſincerely regard me?' Regard you, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, <hi>reply'd Conyers,</hi>— 'Yes, on my Soul, I ſhould for ever <hi>regard, love</hi> and <hi>adore</hi> you! — But, dear Madam, why do you take Pleaſure in tormenting ſo poor an Animal? — Why do you queſtion me like a Priſoner on the Rack, and make me confeſs, what my Safety obliges me to hide?—'But I have done, and can ſcarcely hope your Pardon, for what I've already ſaid.'—'Mr. <hi>Conyers, ſaid ſhe, with a baſhful Air,</hi> I not only pardon, but ſhall endeavour to mitigate your Anxieties. I have ſeen and examin'd your Conduct; I have view'd your Actions; I have read your Heart, and, I think, have diſcover'd in you a Soul incapable of <hi>Meanneſs or Falſhood.</hi>—Though you have no Fortune, I have often thought you deſerv'd one. — I ſpeak to your <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi> and am not afraid of being cenſur'd by it.

               </p>
               <p>SHE hung down her Head, and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently waited a Reply.—<hi>Conyers</hi> gaz'd— his Eyes were fix'd, and his Mouth could only ſeem to ſpeak. At length he roſe up, and throwing aſide all Conſideration, embrac'd Mrs. <hi>Gold</hi> in ſo tender, ſo ardent a Manner, that convinc'd her of his Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, beyond the Utterance of a thouſand Words, and vain Speeches. <q>Confeſs, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> that I have acted like a Woman of <hi>Courage,</hi> by making the firſt Attack; I wiſh my <hi>Prudence</hi> be not more ſuſpected.' Tho', <hi>ſaid Conyers,</hi> the World will talk, yet, believe me, I ſhall give them ſuch a Subject, that our <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Harmony</hi> ſhall be rather <hi>envy'd</hi> than <hi>imitated.</hi> — Give me Leave to call you <hi>my deareſt Life,</hi> and to aſſure you, without Vanity, that you entirely poſſeſs an Heart free from <hi>Flattery, Art,</hi> or <hi>Deceit.</hi> Oh! make me once more happy, and ſay you will be mine.' Mr. <hi>Conyers, ſaid ſhe,</hi> there is my Hand. My Heart you have already. But, no more. You have my Promiſe, and rely on it.' 'Dear Madam, <hi>ſaid Conyers,</hi> let me not ſeem too impatient, by aſking when?' 'Be ſatisfied, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> it ſhall not be long, for I hope ſoon
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0558800102:75"/>
to bring my Brother and Siſter into my Scheme; but I beg your Silence till then.</q>
               </p>
               <p>CONYERS promis'd to be directed by her; and Supper being ſerv'd, a different Converſation began.

               <p>THE Generality of the World regard the Actions of Men, but according to the Event. A proſperous <hi>Villain</hi> may be internally deſpiſed, tho' his Wealth and Grandeur will be outwardly admir'd, and even envy'd.—<hi>Praiſe</hi> is ſacrificed to poor and indigent <hi>Virtue,</hi> but every other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is too frequently neglected.

               </p>
               <p>OUR Friend Mr. <hi>Conyers</hi> could not avoid ſome few Compliments to his <hi>Perſon</hi> and <hi>Abilities,</hi> as they were the Motives of his Advancement; but when he reflected on the Goodneſs of his <hi>Wife</hi> in noticing and rewarding them ſo amply, he diſcover'd, that they proceeded from a ſuperior Cauſe, which, as it reach'd above his Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he could only wonder at, and, by <hi>praiſing</hi> the <hi>Giver,</hi> make Returns of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi> to the <hi>Inſtrument.</hi>—By reaſoning thus, and lowering his own Value as much as he heighten'd the Goodneſs of <hi>Providence,</hi> his Mind became more calm, and his Heart leſs liable to <hi>Vanity.</hi> He was not too elate, or puff'd up; for, by regarding his <hi>Wife</hi> more than her Fortune, the World was compell'd to believe he deſerv'd both.— Never was Woman more happy than Mrs. <hi>Conyers,</hi> and never could a Huſband take more Pains to oblige a Wife.

               </p>
               <p>MR. CONYERS ſtill aſſiſted his Brother <hi>Sampſon,</hi> and having got in moſt of his Debts, and ſettled all his Affairs, propoſed, at the Requeſt of his Wife, to retire to the Country. They agreed to live in a ſmall Town near their Eſtate, and having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided every Houſhold Neceſſary, and a good Collection of Books, they quitted the noiſy City, for the <hi>Peace, Tranquillity</hi> and <hi>Joys</hi> of a Rural Life. He now found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf poſſeſs'd of above Twelve Hundred Pounds a Year, and, calling to his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory the Conduct of Lord <hi>Truegood,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, as near as poſſible, to follow the Example of ſo <hi>worthy</hi> a Nobleman. Like a prudent General, he plann'd out his Operations; he collected his Forces, and aſſign'd to each Part a juſt Proportion. His Diſtribution was exact; but Mrs. <hi>Conyers</hi> changed it a little, by making him ſenſible, that his Scheme had not provided for Sickneſs, and many other Accidents they were liable to. <q>Let us, my Dear, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> live as genteely as you pleaſe; But where is the abſolute Neceſſity of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0558800102:80"/>
ſpending our whole Income? My Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is, to ſave at leaſt <hi>Three hundred Pounds</hi> a Year, to anſwer Contingencies, and aſſiſt a worthy Friend on Occaſion; neither do I ſee how we can well lay out the Remainder. My Life, <hi>ſaid Jack;</hi> you are quite in the Right; then be it ſo: It is but ſtriking out theſe two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary <hi>Horſes, a Servant, one Diſh</hi> a Day, ſomething from the <hi>Wine,</hi> and a little from the Allowance of <hi>Cloaths</hi> and pleaſurable Expences, and the Affair is juſt as you deſire.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THE Behaviour of this Family ſoon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the Eſteem and Reſpect of the neighbouring Gentlemen and Ladies. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Friendſhips were form'd, and a charming Society enlivened every Amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.—Some Gentlemen met twice a Week at the beſt Inn in the Town, to benefit the Houſe, and keep up a proper Intereſt, and our Friend was ſoon invited to be of the Number. It will not be amiſs to mention ſome of this good Company.</p>
               <p>SIR <hi>John Dobſon,</hi> and old <hi>Colonel Manly,</hi> were the principal. The <hi>Knight</hi> had been <hi>Member</hi> for the <hi>County</hi> in three Parliaments, as the <hi>Colonel</hi> had been for the <hi>Town</hi> for almoſt <hi>Forty Years.</hi> Mr. <hi>Leatherhead,</hi> Mr. <hi>Aſh, Doctor Grace,</hi> who was Miniſter of the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0558800102:81"/>
Pariſh, and Mr. <hi>Conyers,</hi> made ſix conſtant Companions. Our Ladies were happy with Mrs. <hi>Grace</hi> and Family, and with Miſs <hi>Lucy Manly</hi> the Daughter of the Colonel, now a moſt amiable Girl of Seventeen Years of Age. Her Wit and Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with her tender and compaſſionate Heart, made her the Joy of her Friends. No Wonder the Colonel was extremely fond, for ſhe was the Child of his Age, and his only one. He ſpoke with Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the vaſt Fortune he intended to leave her, and often ſaid, he almoſt envy'd the happy Man to whoſe Lot ſhe fell.</p>
               <p>WITH great Care and Attention have I examined the original <hi>Memoirs</hi> of this <hi>Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi> but unfortunately found not the leaſt Hint of <hi>Amours,</hi> or, as it is called, the <hi>Gallantry</hi> of Mr. <hi>Conyers,</hi> during his Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the Country. This muſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be a tedious Time to a Reader of <hi>Genius,</hi> who expects at every Page, a well or ill-contrived <hi>Intrigue,</hi> or ſomewhat wonderful or ſurpriſing to raiſe his Imagination, and keep up his Attention.—Tho' I cannot anſwer theſe <hi>valuable Ends,</hi> I cannot paſs in Silence this Space, as my Materials are large, but muſt ſupply the Want of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Adventures in this ſeeming State of Inactivity, with the Subſtance of the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0558800102:82"/>
moſt intereſting Subjects, that made their Evenings paſs <hi>uſefully</hi> and <hi>agreeably</hi> away.</p>
               <p>IN doing this I ſhall ſtick to my uſual Brevity, and treſpaſs as little as poſſible on the Patience of the Good-natur'd. I ſhall not ſummon them to every Aſſembly, but vary the Subject by an <hi>Aſteriſm,</hi> (*) and avoid that Sort of <hi>Connection</hi> that might pin me down to <hi>Form</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies.</hi>

                  <p>IN our laſt Argument, <hi>ſaid</hi> Mr. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyers,</hi> Sir <hi>John</hi> gave us a long Diſſertation on the <hi>Liberty of the Preſs.</hi> I think we all agreed to the Uſefulneſs of it in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and to the Danger of ſuppreſſing any Part; yet I cannot help thinking it a little hard, that a Perſon ſhall have it in his Power to make a Man <hi>ridiculous</hi> whenever he pleaſes to imagine he does Wrong. What are moſt of our <hi>Pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets</hi> and <hi>News Papers</hi> ſtuff'd with, but <hi>Encomiums</hi> on thoſe <hi>out of Place,</hi> and ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous Reflections on thoſe <hi>in?</hi>—Were we to ſhift the Scene, would not the new Miniſtry be <hi>abuſed</hi> like the former, and perhaps, by the ſame Writers?

                  <p>I GRANT you, ſaid Sir <hi>John,</hi> ſome make an ill Uſe of Liberty, and leap beyond the Bounds; if they go too far, the Law is open, and to the Law we muſt leave them. 'Tis very true, ſaid Mr. <hi>Conyers,</hi> but they have found out a jeſuitical Way of evading even the beſt Law. Here are a Parcel of Pamphlets and News-Papers (which he threw on the Table) fill'd with <hi>initial Letters, Daſhes,</hi> and <hi>Stars.</hi> Tho' we clearly ſee the Inſolence and Treaſon, what Jury, as the Law now ſtands, can properly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Author or Printer to loſe his Ears?'— 'Well, well, <hi>ſaid</hi> Sir <hi>John,</hi> no Matter, let them ſcribble on, provided they do not oblige me to believe all their Impertinence.'—Men of Senſe, Sir <hi>John, anſwer'd Conyers,</hi> will always think in that Manner, but how many honeſt well-meaning Gentlemen ſuffer themſelves to be impoſed on, merely for Want of due Attention. Perhaps ſome muſt write thus, or ſtarve. In that Caſe, I ſincerely
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0558800102:86"/>
pity them, yet I hope Mankind have not ſuch vitiated Taſtes, as to be delighted only with <hi>Scandal.</hi> Would a <hi>Writer</hi> fix on a Plan of <hi>Inſtruction.</hi>—Would he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate the <hi>Fear of God,</hi> and <hi>Honour to the King</hi> — Would he endeavour to make us better <hi>Parents,</hi> better <hi>Children,</hi> and better <hi>Friends</hi> to <hi>Society</hi>—Would he employ his <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Learning</hi> to perſuade us to <hi>Unanimity,</hi> and not <hi>Diſcord</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.</hi> Who amongſt us—what honeſt Man, but would <hi>praiſe</hi> and <hi>applaud</hi> him? But to write from Principles of <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Ill-nature,</hi> and to ſow thoſe peſtilent Seeds in the Minds of the Unwary, is certainly a Conduct that even Vice will condemn. To him who writes fluently and well, but with ſuch Intentions, I ſhall only ſay what a noble Lord did of the <hi>Earl of Stafford, That God had given him Talents, but the Devil the Application.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>WERE it poſſible, <hi>ſaid the Doctor,</hi> to reſtrain <hi>the Liberty of the Preſs</hi> without endangering the <hi>Liberty of the People,</hi> I am convinced we ſhould be much hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier and much more free from <hi>Squabbles</hi> and idle <hi>Diſputes;</hi> but the Experiment is of too tender and delicate a Nature, to wiſh ſeeing it attempted, tho' I verily believe <hi>News-Writers</hi> and <hi>Pamphleteers</hi>

are the Collectors of the fifth great Tax in the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>* * *</p>
                  <p>—WHATEVER the <hi>Equity</hi> may be, ſaid Sir <hi>John,</hi> I hope never to ſee a new Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luation for a Land-Tax. Our Acres are pretty well charged already, ſo let them look elſewhere, if they want to raiſe more Money.—Yet, <hi>reply'd</hi> Mr. <hi>Conyers,</hi> all Taxes muſt at laſt center on Land.' I muſt beg Leave, <hi>reply'd the Doctor,</hi> to differ from you.— For Example: Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that a Duty was laid on the Expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of our <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Titles. How could ſuch a Tax affect the Land?'— They travel for <hi>Health</hi> or <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> and I think ought to pay <hi>Fifty</hi> or an <hi>Hundred Pounds</hi> to their own Country, for Permiſſion to ſpend the Remainder of their Fortunes in another. Upon my Word, <hi>ſaid Squire Aſh,</hi> a very notable and reaſonable Scheme! Then, <hi>continued the Doctor,</hi> if every Man, who accepted an Employment of <hi>One hundred Pounds</hi> a Year, was obliged to pay a <hi>Year's Salary</hi> to the State, and a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable Tax on the Commiſſioners of Land and Sea-Officers, would it not raiſe a large Sum, and how would it affect our Lands?— In <hi>Holland</hi> they have what
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0558800102:88"/>
is called a <hi>Collateral Tax,</hi> that is, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heriter of a Fortune in Land or Money, not deſcending to him in a <hi>direct Line,</hi> pays 2 ½ <hi>per Cent.</hi> to the State. When they ſell Lands or Tenements, the Seller and Purchaſer pay two or three <hi>per Cent.</hi> of the Value to the Government.—Thus, Gentlemen, it is plain, there are many Ways of raiſing Money, where Taxes, ſo far from raiſing our <hi>Manufactures,</hi> might be ſo managed, as to go infinitely cheaper to Foreign Markets.</p>
                  <p>I ASSURE you, <hi>cried Colonel Manly,</hi> I never thought my Friend Doctor <hi>Grace,</hi> had ſo calculating an Head, and I dare ſay, were the Miniſtry acquainted with his Genius, he would ſoon have Lawn Sleeves. I am ſo pleaſed with his Money Projects, that I muſt add <hi>one,</hi> which I wonder he forgot. For Example: Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe all the Livings of the <hi>Clergy</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> were to be new valued, and the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy who ſucceed, after a certain Day, were obliged to pay to the Government one Year of that Valuation by four equal Payments in four Years. Would not this likewiſe make a large Fund? And how would it affect our Lands? Permit me to explain my Scheme by Figures.</p>

                  <p>Now, I would value theſe Livings but at Two Hundred Pounds a Year in the <hi>King's New Books,</hi> and where would be the mighty Injuſtice to oblige his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor to pay that Sum in four Years? And how would it affect our Lands?' Were this Chamber, <hi>reply'd the Doctor,</hi> a Chamber of Parliament, I ſhould vaſtly diſappoint the Colonel, by heartily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring in ſuch a Scheme, properly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated, but I ſhould certainly Vote for exempting the poor Clergy. Agreed, <hi>ſaid the Colonel,</hi> ſo let it be reſolved, that no <hi>Clergyman</hi> ſhall be liable to this <hi>New Duty,</hi> who has not <hi>One Hundred Pounds</hi> a Year clear of all Deductions.' 'Raillery apart, ſaid Mr. <hi>Conyers,</hi> I ſincerely think,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0558800102:90"/>
ſomewhat of this Nature ought to be done, and the <hi>Clergy of France</hi> have ſet us very good Examples. The Wiſdom of Government is beſt ſeen in the juſt Partition of Taxes. <hi>To charge them who are rich in this World,</hi> is true Policy, and to eaſe the poor <hi>Labourer,</hi> is equal to it. To leſſen the Tax on the Conſumption of the <hi>Poor,</hi> is, in Fact, an Advantage to the <hi>Rich,</hi> as all Manufactures and Workmanſhip muſt leſſen in Proportion.</p>
                  <p>THE Doctor mention'd, ſaid Sir <hi>John,</hi> ſomething of <hi>poor Clergy.</hi> I am really aſham'd to ſee ſo many, in ſuch a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try as <hi>England,</hi> who appear like Objects of Charity, and thought, that when QUEEN ANNE gave up her <hi>firſt Fruits</hi> to buy <hi>Glebe</hi> and <hi>Impropriated Tythes,</hi> they would all have comfortable Livings; but I am vaſtly diſappointed, nor can I conceive why they are not in a better Situation.' 'All I know, <hi>reply'd the Doctor,</hi> is, that the Truſtees for that uſeful Work have had the <hi>firſt Fruits</hi> and <hi>Tenths</hi> above Thirty Years. They have purchaſed many Glebes, and, I dare ſay, from their great Virtues and high Dignities, every Thing in their Power has been done for the <hi>Good of the</hi> CHURCH, If they have not added more to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0558800102:91"/>
of <hi>poor Clergy,</hi> I muſt ſuppoſe they could get no more to purchaſe, or wanted a Fund.</p>
                  <p>FAR be it from me, ſaid Mr. <hi>Conyers,</hi> to hint the leaſt Reflection on the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or Integrity of Gentlemen in ſuch eminent Stations, but from what the Doctor has ſaid, and from what I have heard on this Subject, I muſt conclude, that there has been no <hi>Miſapplication</hi> of Money. On the contrary, I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd very little has been <hi>apply'd.</hi> If my Intelligence be true, a <hi>Capital,</hi> and the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of a Capital, has been ſuffer'd to <hi>accumulate</hi> to ſo <hi>mighty</hi> a <hi>Sum,</hi> that I am cautious to mention it. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue is certainly large, and ſhould the <hi>Truſtees</hi> not have found out Purchaſes, I ſee no Reaſon but that <hi>Twenty, Thirty,</hi> or <hi>Forty</hi> Pounds in Money, ſhould be given annually to many poor Clergymen, which, I humbly apprehend, would fully anſwer the Intent of the charitable Donor. Whether the <hi>Truſtees</hi> have expended their <hi>whole Fund,</hi> or whether they are enabled to ſupport <hi>Twenty or Two Hundred</hi> Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gymen, I cannot poſitively aſſert; but ſure I am, that as the Wiſdom of the <hi>Legiſlature</hi> would not be leſs manifeſted by a fair and honeſt Enquiry into it;
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0558800102:92"/>
ſo I am equally ſatisfied, that the <hi>Integrity</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> of the <hi>Truſtees</hi> would be thus clearly demonſtrated, and malevolent and clamorous Tongues ſilenced.</p>

                  <p>TRULY, Sir <hi>John, ſaid the Doctor,</hi> I am ſorry Matters were carried ſo far Yeſterday. We had warm Words, very warm Words. In the Name of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, what had <hi>They</hi> or <hi>We</hi> to do in the Affair? If the <hi>French</hi> prevail over us, I am ſorry for it, and pray God it may be otherwiſe. If we beat them, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice and am thankful. But to argue, that ſome Things ought to have been <hi>done,</hi> and that others ought to have been <hi>undone,</hi> is certainly idle, for, I profeſs, I believe we know nothing of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.' 'Right, Right, ſaid Sir <hi>John,</hi> but you know my Rule is, never to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict or diſpute about what I do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, eſpecially when I am convinc'd that my Antagoniſt is equally ignorant.</p>
                  <p>SUCH Diſputants, <hi>ſaid the Colonel,</hi> are the Plague of Society. The more they ſeem <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> the more Miſchief they do, for, as they chooſe, and commonly herd but with People of inferior Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, they paſs current for <hi>vaſt Geniuſes,</hi> and are applauded for their mighty Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings.

I have often laugh'd to hear a Company of honeſt Citizens, fighting over the very Battles I had been in, and minutely mentioning a thouſand Circumſtances that never did or could have happen'd, and have endeavour'd, and ſometimes with Succeſs, to put my good Countrymen right. I remember when I was a young Man, and return'd from the Campaign of 1707, when the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Marlborough</hi> did not fight the <hi>French,</hi> I ſtroll'd into a City Coffee-houſe, where a young pert <hi>Soap-boiler</hi> was moſt eloquently diſplaying his Talents, and diverting his Audience with the <hi>Blunders</hi> and <hi>Miſconduct</hi> of the <hi>Duke.</hi> — I own I was fooliſh enough to be provok'd, and long'd to chaſtize his Inſolence. At laſt, the young Man to illuſtrate his Subject, chalk'd out two Lines on the Table.— Now, Gentlemen, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> here lay the <hi>French,</hi>—and here the Allied Army, with this trifling River between them.—Now, (ſtill pointing with his Finger) why the Devil the <hi>Duke</hi> did not croſs the River, and beat the <hi>French</hi> Scoundrels, is paſt my Comprehenſion." — 'He was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, but I loſt all Patience, for, ſtretching over my Cane, I gave his Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers a pretty ſevere Rebuke.—He roſe
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0558800102:94"/>
in Anger, and demanded a Reaſon, when I very coolly reply'd.—<hi>It was only to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him, that in paſſing a River, an Army might receive a Rap over the Knuckles.</hi> The Laugh of the Company was on my Side, and the poor <hi>Soap-Boiler</hi> look'd mighty ſilly.</p>
                  <p>WHY there it is, ſaid Sir <hi>John,</hi> an honeſt innocent Man can't ſpeak his Mind freely, but up comes a <hi>Red Coat,</hi> and knocks him down. — The Colonel ſays, he was then young and fooliſh, but how many have we of the ſame Stamp, at this Day? — God help us! when we are to be govern'd, or, rather, controul'd by a Standing Army! — 'God help us, indeed, <hi>reply'd the Colonel,</hi> but for my Part, I promiſe you I will never live to ſee that Day.'—'That may be, anſwer'd 'Squire <hi>Aſh;</hi> but really I can't help think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſome People are making large Strides towards it, and where it may end, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven knows! —Is't not a plain Caſe, they want to make us a <hi>military Government,</hi> by raiſing ſuch an <hi>Army,</hi> and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>them</hi> in a fooliſh War on the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,</hi> where, every <hi>News Paper</hi> will tell you, we have not the leaſt Buſineſs? — If we muſt have a War, and be blooded by Taxes, let us, a God's Name, give

                  </p>
                  <p>WELL ſaid, Mr. <hi>Aſh,</hi> reply'd Sir <hi>John,</hi> you ſpeak my Sentiments, and, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Sentiments of every honeſt Man in <hi>Great Britain;</hi> but I am afraid all this mighty <hi>Hurry</hi> and <hi>Noiſe,</hi> and Expence of <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Treaſure,</hi> is more on Account of ſome <hi>G— D—,</hi> than any Good intended to <hi>us.</hi> If they mean a real Advantage to <hi>England,</hi> let them ſend forth her <hi>Wooden Walls</hi> and ſcour the <hi>Ocean.</hi>—We may do ſome Good there, and let <hi>Europe</hi> fight on the Continent to Eternity, provided we keep them out of our own natural Territories; nay, the more they quarrel and knock one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Brains out <hi>Abroad,</hi> the better it is for us at Home. Read our Annals, Colonel. They were glorious Times, when our honeſt <hi>Militia,</hi> headed by <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Gentlemen,</hi> could ſtep out and <hi>beat the French</hi> on their own Ground.' 'Pray, Sir, <hi>ſaid the Colonel,</hi> what Buſineſs had theſe <hi>Country Gentlemen</hi> and gallant <hi>Militia</hi> in <hi>France?</hi> — 'Buſineſs! <hi>reply'd Sir John,</hi> —why, they went to <hi>conquer</hi> and keep the <hi>French</hi> at a Diſtance; and when they had conquer'd, to keep their Conqueſts.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0558800102:96"/>
Had we not NORMANDY, AQUITAIN, ANJOU, and almoſt <hi>Half of France?</hi> Very true, <hi>anſwer'd the Colonel,</hi> and, as if it were done to ſhew us our Folly, a <hi>Woman</hi> drove this <hi>mighty Militia</hi> almoſt out of All.' 'Ay, <hi>ſaid</hi> Mr. <hi>Conyers,</hi> and we were full as Glorious when we <hi>burnt</hi> this poor Woman for a <hi>Witch.</hi> Thoſe, <hi>ſaid the Doctor,</hi> were the Days of glorious Ignorance!' 'Had our Anceſtors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd Part of <hi>France,</hi> or had Provinces deſcended by <hi>Right</hi> to our <hi>Kings,</hi> they were mad to pretend to keep them for the Good of <hi>England.</hi>—Had they erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a <hi>Kingdom</hi> within that <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and given it an Head of Importance and Weight, they would have done wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.' — 'Very well obſerv'd, <hi>cry'd</hi> Mr. <hi>Conyers;</hi> I fear the Church Militant will be too hard for Country Gentlemen.</p>
                  <p>I MUST beg your Patience, <hi>ſaid Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Manly,</hi> for I have a few Words to offer, and hope I ſhall never be call'd on this Subject again.</p>
                  <p>THE Vicinity, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> of <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and the Rivalſhip in <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Trade,</hi> will ever make them natural Enemies to each other.

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0558800102:97"/>
rather lead us to checque the exorbitant Power of others, than to increaſe our own.</p>
                  <p>WHEN LEWIS the XIVth made War on the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and gave his GLORY for the <hi>Reaſon,</hi> it was the Height of true Glory to reſiſt and checque ſuch an unchriſtian Scheme; but unhappily, our CHARLES <hi>the Second</hi> was his Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner.</p>
                  <p>WHEN this mighty <hi>Lewis,</hi> contrary to <hi>Faith</hi> and ſolemn Treaties, gave SPAIN to his <hi>Grandſon,</hi> our Intereſt joined to fruſtrate the Project; but when <hi>Charles</hi> our <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> became Head of the <hi>Empire,</hi> our Intereſt oppoſed his being Maſter of <hi>two</hi> ſuch Monarchies, tho', perhaps, our Policy was <hi>unſound</hi> to ſuffer <hi>Spain</hi> to fall to any Branch of the <hi>Houſe</hi> of BOURBON.</p>
                  <p>IN the preſent War, when <hi>France,</hi> in Violation of the <hi>moſt ſolemn</hi> Engagements, and in the Midſt of profound Peace, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd the <hi>Empire;</hi> — when ſhe had made the QUEEN <hi>of</hi> HUNGARY a Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, even to the Subjects ſhe, or her Family, had oppreſſed the moſt;—when ſhe had near overturned the <hi>great Weight</hi> that kept her <hi>Ambition</hi> from trampling on the <hi>Neck</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> our <hi>Intereſt,</hi> our
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0558800102:98"/>
                     <hi>Happineſs</hi> and our <hi>Honour</hi> compell'd <hi>us</hi> to join againſt her.—If our <hi>little Army</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> was not ſo ſucceſsful as we wiſh'd, they were led on with a <hi>noble Spirit,</hi> they fought like themſelves, and retired from <hi>Numbers,</hi> rather <hi>fatigu'd</hi> than <hi>conquer'd.</hi> — We now know the TRUTH. We now know the Value of HANOVERIAN Troops, tho' <hi>Patriots,</hi> or rather <hi>Party,</hi> deprived us of 15,000, and made <hi>Lewis</hi> Triumph. We know how near the <hi>Few</hi> of our ſmall Army, who fought, were of Routing the whole Strength of the <hi>Grand Monarch.</hi> —We know our Troops <hi>deſerved,</hi> tho' they had not <hi>Victory.</hi>—We now praiſe their <hi>Valour,</hi> but the <hi>French</hi> do more.—They <hi>dread it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IN the Name of GOD, How can our Government, or our <hi>General</hi> act? — If we had not ſent Troops to <hi>Flanders</hi> to convince the World we were hearty in the Cauſe, and in ſome Meaſure, to perſuade the <hi>Dutch</hi> into our Sentiments, what a Load of Scandal would have iſſued from the <hi>Preſs.?</hi> — If our <hi>General</hi> had <hi>tamely</hi> look'd on, and not attempted the Relief of TOURNAY, would not every ſcribling Fellow pour down from his Garret as much Abuſe, as they now Honour him
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0558800102:99"/>
with for acting otherwiſe?—Oh! But we were repulſed at FONTENOY, and have loſt <hi>Flanders.</hi>—What then?—If we argue from Conſequences, we had beſt never <hi>Begin,</hi> becauſe we can never <hi>End.</hi> — In <hi>War,</hi> as in <hi>Law, Trade,</hi> and every other human Project, it ſuffices, that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Action was founded in <hi>Reaſon, Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Honour;</hi> but as to the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, we muſt ſubmit to the Diſpoſer of all Things.</p>
                  <p>KING WILLIAM and <hi>Queen</hi> ANNE'S Wars had the ſame Riſe. Perhaps that <hi>Glorious Monarch</hi> deſerved as much Praiſe in his <hi>Defeats,</hi> as the Great <hi>Marlborough</hi> received for his <hi>Victories.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> did not eſcape Calumny: —<hi>Marlborough</hi> had his Share;— was diſgraced, and even ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iled for Conquering!</p>
                  <p>LET us caſt our Eyes round <hi>Europe,</hi> even in Times of Peace, and ſhall we not find them all arm'd, and greatly arm'd;— and ſhall we ſupinely reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and pay no Regard to our Safety? —Tho' ſome affect to call our Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <hi>a Standing Army,</hi> though the Whole is little more than a <hi>French Grand Guard,</hi> yet we dread from it the Loſs of our <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</hi> — Thank God! I have a good Eſtate, but were our Army double their
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0558800102:100"/>
Numbers, I would not ſell my Land for a Shilling leſs. — All <hi>Europe</hi> think our <hi>Property,</hi> conſequently our <hi>Liberty,</hi> quite ſecure; otherwiſe they would never truſt their <hi>Millions</hi> in our Funds.—This is the <hi>Touch-ſtone</hi> of our <hi>Credit</hi> and <hi>Character</hi> Abroad.—This is the <hi>Barometer</hi> of the State.—Whilſt our Officers are <hi>Natives,</hi> whilſt they are Men of <hi>Family</hi> and <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,</hi> and have their Share in the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Bleſſing,</hi> I think I may poſitively pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce our Liberty is ſafe.—Not to ſpeak in too peremptory a Manner, I will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that an Army, <hi>little</hi> or <hi>great,</hi> is a very uſeleſs, nay a dangerous Thing, without <hi>Experience</hi> and the <hi>ſtricteſt</hi> Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; but God forbid they ſhould ever acquire that Experience in their own Country!—Since <hi>Experience</hi> is abſolutely neceſſary, where ought they learn it but Abroad?</p>
                  <p>IN our private Capacities we muſt keep our Honour and preſerve our Reputation, even ſometimes at the Hazard of our Lives; but who would not hazard more, if poſſible, when his <hi>Property,</hi> his <hi>Family,</hi> and every Thing dear to him, are tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled upon! — A <hi>Nation,</hi> in this, is as a private Man.—We ought to acquire <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,</hi> but be careful to <hi>keep it.</hi>—We
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0558800102:101"/>
muſt make ourſelves <hi>reſpected,</hi> but, by good Conduct, preſerve that <hi>Dignity.</hi>— We ought to love <hi>Peace,</hi> but by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Readineſs for <hi>War,</hi> be able to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the <hi>one</hi> with Honour, or purſue the <hi>other</hi> with Juſtice and Glory.</p>
                  <p>A WORD more, and I have done. I know what Sir <hi>John</hi> means by <hi>German Dominions.</hi> Without entring into what, perhaps, none of us rightly underſtands, I really imagine that a <hi>Monarch</hi> has ſome ſmall Title to the natural Liberty of other Men, and may be allowed the ſame natural Inclinations. I am aſham'd this Argument is ſo often thrown out.— Could I diveſt myſelf of the Duty I owe him as my <hi>Sovereign,</hi> I ſhould ſtill reſpect and honour his <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Valour,</hi> were he but a private Gentleman. Let us not, my Friends, fooliſhly and wantonly condemn, but let us rather endeavour to make his Life <hi>Happy</hi> and <hi>Content,</hi> whilſt Heaven is pleaſed to ſpare him to us. Let us, as free Subjects, <hi>Love him,</hi> and imitate thoſe, over whom he is Abſolute by the Laws, but over whoſe Hearts, his <hi>Clemency</hi> and <hi>Uprightneſs</hi> has eſtabliſhed a more <hi>abſolute Sway.</hi>

                  <p>WHOEVER, <hi>continued he,</hi> conſiders the Dominions of <hi>France,</hi> will imagine they ought not to think of enlarging their Boundaries beyond the <hi>Pyranees,</hi> the <hi>Alps,</hi> and the <hi>Rhine,</hi> as ſuch Conqueſts would be rather expenſive than ſerviceable.—

Their Views, with regard to <hi>Commerce,</hi> have always been traverſed by <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland.</hi>—The Forces they conſtantly keep up, prevent their being diſturbed by their Neighbours on the Continent.— By the vaſt Sums they employ in Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Courts, beſides their known Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidies, they fortify themſelves with the ſtrongeſt Alliances.—As they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to fear at Home, they have but <hi>one Thing</hi> to wiſh for Abroad, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh all their Schemes.—Could the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrian Netherland</hi> be annexed to <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>grand Project</hi> would execute itſelf.</p>
                  <p>For this eſſential Conqueſt <hi>Treaſures</hi> muſt be hoarded, Troops muſt be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, and no Expence ſpared. When this <hi>finiſhing Blow</hi> can be once ſtruck, <hi>France</hi> need not deſire <hi>Univerſal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy.</hi>—If ſhe now maintains <hi>three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Men,</hi> ſhe will then content herſelf with a Quarter of that Number. —When Miſtreſs of the <hi>ten Provinces</hi> of <hi>Flanders,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> muſt act as ſhe ſhall direct.—When aſſured no <hi>War</hi> can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb her <hi>Frontiers,</hi> what <hi>Veſſels</hi> will ſhe not build!— How many Thouſands will then be employ'd at <hi>Sea!</hi> and, who will ſhe have to oppoſe her but <hi>England?</hi>— Their whole <hi>Force</hi> will then be center'd on the <hi>Ocean.</hi>— Caſt your Eyes on the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0558800102:104"/>
Map of <hi>Europe.</hi>—Will ſhe not then have the whole Coaſt from <hi>Oſtend</hi> to St. <hi>Jean de Luz,</hi> beſides <hi>That</hi> in the <hi>Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean?</hi>—She may then, without aiming at <hi>Univerſal Monarchy,</hi> guide, direct, and <hi>give Laws</hi> to every State in <hi>Europe,</hi> free from the Trouble of being <hi>Sovereign</hi> of it.—What would her Glory be, to have MONARCHS for her VASSALS!</p>
                  <p>IT is next to a mathematical Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that this is the favourite Project of <hi>France.</hi> LEWIS <hi>the Fourteenth</hi> attempted it, and became formidable at <hi>Sea,</hi> even to the United Fleets of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> Great and Mighty as they were!— In all human Probability, <hi>Lewis</hi> had ſeen the End of his Wiſhes, had not KING WILLIAM and QUEEN ANNE glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly interpoſed and ſaved <hi>Europe.</hi> They cut him out ſuch warm Work on the <hi>Continent,</hi> and obliged him ſo to waſte the Blood and Treaſure of his People, that his Sinews at laſt relaxed, his darling <hi>Marine</hi> was neglected, and his whole Force became little enough to <hi>defend</hi> the <hi>Heart</hi> of his <hi>Kingdom.</hi>

                  <p>IF what I have ſaid be not critically the Views of <hi>France,</hi> they have certainly Schemes of ſome Affinity to it.—In the preſent War they practiſed another Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to arrive at the ſame End.—They

attack'd the <hi>Empire.</hi> — Could they have cut off the <hi>Head,</hi> they knew the <hi>Limbs</hi> would fall of Courſe.</p>
                  <p>SUCH, Gentlemen, I apprehend, is the Fundamental Maxim of <hi>France.</hi> — To <hi>traverſe</hi> and <hi>fruſtrate</hi> ſuch a pernicious Project, Half our <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Treaſure</hi> would be a cheap Purchaſe. — Our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals are ſanguin'd with the <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> ſlaughtered by <hi>Brother Britains.</hi>— They ſhew the horrid Devaſtation of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil War.</hi> — They point out the bloody Fields in <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland!</hi> —Wherefore all this, but to eſtabliſh and preſerve us in that <hi>Liberty</hi> we ſo happily enjoy, but of which ſome make unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Uſe! — If we have <hi>fought</hi> with, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>throned,</hi> and put our own <hi>Monarchs to Death,</hi> for infringing on our <hi>Liberties,</hi> What ſhould we not do to avoid <hi>Servility</hi> being impoſed on us by <hi>Foreign Tyranny?</hi> ULTIMA RATIO REGUM is the Motto of <hi>French</hi> Cannon.—If <hi>that</hi> be the <hi>laſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument</hi> of the <hi>Moſt Chriſtian Monarch,</hi> certainly it is our <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Buſineſs,</hi> as perfectly to underſtand <hi>that Logick.</hi>

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0558800102:116"/>
we conſider their <hi>Religion.</hi> —Erroneous as their Principles were, they certainly acted agreeable to them.—No doubt the Reſiſtance they made, and the Blood they ſhed, ſtruck that Sort of <hi>Horror</hi> and <hi>Hatred</hi> in our Anceſtors, that is handed down to their Poſterity, and makes, at this Day, Part of our Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.—When we ſpeak of the People, we ought carefully to make a Diſtinction between <hi>Iriſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh,</hi> that is, we ought to regard the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> as ourſelves, becauſe, in Fact, they are our <hi>Brethren</hi> and our <hi>Children;</hi> and ſo to manage the poor <hi>Natives,</hi> who are moſtly <hi>Papiſts,</hi> that by <hi>Clemency</hi> and good <hi>Uſage</hi> we may wean them from ill Habits, and make them <hi>faithful</hi> and <hi>uſeful</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
                     <p>THE Settlements of our Anceſtors in this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and the Number of <hi>Engliſh</hi> that are daily fixing themſelves in the <hi>Law,</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> the <hi>Army,</hi> and in <hi>Civil Employments,</hi> muſt in Time make it a <hi>Proteſtant Country,</hi> and of the higheſt Importance to <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>— An Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of <hi>Three Millions of Subjects,</hi> and above <hi>Ten Millions</hi> of good Acres, is not ſo trivial an Affair as ſome imagine.— If we have <hi>conquered</hi> this Kingdom, Who
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0558800102:117"/>
enjoys the <hi>Conqueſt</hi> but the Deſcendants of the <hi>Engliſh?</hi>—If true Policy requires Lenity and Encouragement to the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered,</hi> undoubtedly the <hi>Conquerors,</hi> who ſettled on the Spot, have at leaſt the ſame Title.—Wherefore did we conquer but to eſtabliſh our <hi>Laws,</hi> our <hi>Religion,</hi> our <hi>Manners,</hi> and our <hi>Liberty,</hi> amongſt a People who greatly wanted all, and to add <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Luſtre,</hi> to the <hi>Throne of England?</hi>—It is true, my Lord, we are Maſters of this Kingdom, but I am afraid we do not reap a <hi>Tenth</hi> of the Advantages it might procure us!</p>
                     <p>OUR whole Conduct favours too much of <hi>Monopoly.</hi> We argue from wrong Principles; for every <hi>Individual,</hi> regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of every other, meaſures the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the Kingdom but by his own private Intereſt. — Thus, a <hi>Cloathing</hi> Town complains dreadfully of the <hi>Decay</hi> of its Trade, without conſidering how much it <hi>increaſes</hi> in another.— <hi>Briſtol</hi> is much out of Humour that the <hi>African</hi> and <hi>Slave-Trade</hi> is ſo conſiderably fall'n; but <hi>Briſtol</hi> forgets to inform us, how greatly it flouriſhes at <hi>Liverpool.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>PROVIDED Trade exiſts, 'tis indifferent to us, as a Nation, where it fixes; but I apprehend, the more Places it inhabits,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0558800102:118"/>
the greater the Chance for its <hi>Increaſing.</hi> —With regard to the Kingdom, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud our Wiſdom in promoting and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging their <hi>Linen Manufacture.</hi>— Their Induſtry has brought this Branch to infinite perfection, which alone en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables them to pay ſo great a Tax to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> as <hi>Twelve Hundred Thouſand Pounds a Year.</hi>—Your Lordſhip will be ſurpriſed at my Mentioning a Tax.—If the expreſs Letter will not allow of the Term, the <hi>real Fact</hi> will juſtify it.—The <hi>Penſions</hi> and <hi>Employments</hi> on this Eſtabliſhment, the large <hi>Fortunes</hi> ſpent in <hi>England,</hi> the great Importation of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commodities, with other Articles that are exactly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, will amount to that Sum, if not to more.</p>
                     <p>DID they want this <hi>Linen</hi> Trade, <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> would want ſo much clear Profit, and <hi>Sileſia, Hamburgh</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> enjoy the Sweets. Your Lordſhip therefore perceives, how much it is the Intereſt of <hi>England,</hi> to cheriſh and countenance this Branch. Should we neglect or clog it by <hi>partial Views,</hi> or unſeaſonable <hi>Parſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> we ſhould irrecoverably loſe a <hi>Mine</hi> more valuable than that of <hi>Gold.</hi> Whilſt we favour <hi>Ireland</hi> in this, it is but Juſt and Right we would be equally
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0558800102:119"/>
kind to our Brethren of <hi>Scotland.</hi> The Field is wide enough for both, and both ought to be ſupported by every <hi>Bounty</hi> we can beſtow.</p>
                     <p>WHAT Laws have we not made, what Expence have we not been at, to prevent the Exportation of <hi>Iriſh Wooll</hi> into Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Nations! — Has it anſwered the End propoſed?—I am ſure it has not— The natural Conſequence of our Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition is, that they ſend, it by Stealth into <hi>France,</hi> where they have a certain Vent.— Is this clandeſtine Trade practiſed in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi>—I fear your Lordſhip cannot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in the Negative.</p>
                     <p>IRELAND could do extremely well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>French Wines;</hi> but I know not the Inconveniencies <hi>France</hi> would be drove to, had ſhe not their <hi>Beef,</hi> their <hi>Tallow, Hides</hi> and <hi>Butter;</hi> but when we add <hi>Wooll,</hi> the <hi>Iriſh</hi> have a Profit in that Commodity; the <hi>French</hi> have a vaſt Gain, but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are as certainly vaſt Loſers.—Were your Lordſhip to examine ſtrictly into the Truth, you would find that the <hi>grand Conteſt</hi> is not ſo much between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> but between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France.</hi> Your Lordſhip would then diſcover, that every <hi>Link</hi> we throw out to <hi>bind Ireland,</hi> not
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0558800102:120"/>
only curtails <hi>their Profits</hi> but our own, and, what is worſe, transferring thoſe Profits into the Arms of <hi>France.</hi>—Was this Matter ſeriouſly conſidered, and it is worth the Thoughts of the wiſeſt amongſt us, <hi>Abbeville</hi> would ſoon be a Deſart, and the <hi>French</hi> obliged to recur to the old Method of buying our Stuffs.</p>
                     <p>AND here, my Lord, permit me to lay open a Piece of <hi>French</hi> Conduct, which is not generally known. <hi>Abbeville</hi> is a Royal Manufacture: To ſupport which, <hi>Wooll</hi> muſt be obtained from <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> at any Price, but the Manufacturers pay only the middle Price of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>King,</hi> that is, the Kingdom in general, pays the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder. By this Method, and by the Cheapneſs of Proviſions, they are able to underſell us in foreign Markets.</p>
                     <p>AMONGST the many Schemes for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining <hi>Iriſh Wooll,</hi> I have met but with <hi>one</hi> that in any Degree can anſwer the End. — The Author propoſes a <hi>large Bounty</hi> on the Exportation of Corn from <hi>Ireland.</hi>—This, <hi>ſays he,</hi> would certainly throw the Inhabitants into <hi>Tillage,</hi> and ſoon convert their <hi>Sheep Walks</hi> into <hi>Corn Fields,</hi> and all the People would be properly employed and ſupported.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="118" facs="tcp:0558800102:121"/>WERE your Lordſhip to view the <hi>Southern</hi> and <hi>Weſtern</hi> Coaſts of this <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> you would be as much charmed with their <hi>Bays</hi> and <hi>Harbours,</hi> as aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to find them of ſuch little Uſe.—Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to themſelves, but leſs to <hi>England.</hi>— Were it poſſible to convince Gentlemen, that, let the <hi>Riches</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> be what it will, <hi>Nine Tenths</hi> would certainly center in <hi>England,</hi> I imagine they could not heſitate a Moment, but, by endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to increaſe it, at the Expence of our <hi>Enemies,</hi> enable them, at laſt, to bear a Proportion, and to contribute to the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies of the <hi>Britiſh Government.</hi>

                     <p>THE common Opinion of the <hi>Lazineſs</hi> of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> is not ſtrictly Juſt.

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0558800102:122"/>
Cloaths, and decent Habitations, greatly Influence the Conſtitution of a Man, and give a Labourer that Vigour and Life ſo neceſſary to his Employment.—Your Lordſhip may aſk, Why it is not ſo in <hi>Ireland?</hi> — The Error, I think, lies in the Generality of the <hi>Landlords.</hi> Here, a Man of large Fortune never <hi>ſees</hi> his <hi>Eſtate,</hi> and will not be troubled with a Multiplicity of Tenants. — He lets the Whole to a few Gentlemen.—Theſe, lett their Parts to others, reſerving a certain Revenue to themſelves.—Theſe again do the ſame in a lower Degree, till, by paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thro' a Dozen, or Twenty Hands, it ſinks the <hi>real Occupiers</hi> into downright <hi>Miſery</hi> and <hi>Wretchedneſs.</hi>—As a Man of ſome Humanity and Tenderneſs for my Fellow Creatures, I moſt heartily wiſh I could as eaſily Point out the <hi>Remedy,</hi> as ſhew the <hi>Diſeaſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>NOTWITHSTANDING their <hi>own</hi> capital Errors, and many of <hi>ours,</hi> they ſeem to ſtruggle through Difficulties with great Reſignation and Patience.

in <hi>Labour, Induſtry</hi> and <hi>true Religion.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready have they reclaimed Thouſands of unhappy Creatures, and added them to the Stock of <hi>faithful Subjects.</hi>—If the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> granted a <hi>Civic Crown</hi> to him who ſaved <hi>one</hi> Citizen, what <hi>Triumphs,</hi> what <hi>Statues</hi> does not this truly <hi>Right</hi> Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend <hi>Prelate</hi> deſerve, for preſerving ſuch Multitudes!—The Reward of <hi>this World</hi> can be but Praiſe; the <hi>juſt Recompence</hi> can only be given in the <hi>other.</hi>—I incloſe to your Lordſhip a full Account of this moſt noble and uſeful <hi>Charity,</hi> now found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a <hi>Charter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>ONE rational Scheme produces others. —Their liberal Subſcriptions for encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging <hi>Huſbandry, Arts, Manufactures,</hi> and, in ſhort, every Branch of <hi>Induſtry</hi> and <hi>uſeful</hi> Knowledge, betrays not an <hi>idle, inactive Spirit,</hi> and the Conſequence is viſible throughout the whole Kingdom. — I ſend your Lordſhip a Liſt of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miums</hi> for the preſent Year.

                     <p>THE Ridicule on the <hi>Iriſh Tone,</hi> or Manner of Speaking, is rather more <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd</hi> than <hi>barbarous.</hi> All Nations have that Folly. — The <hi>Pariſians</hi> make very free with the <hi>Normans, Gaſcoigns,</hi> and other Provinces. — The People of <hi>Rome</hi> banter the common <hi>Venetian Dialect.</hi>— The <hi>Saxons</hi> deſpiſe the <hi>Tone</hi> of other <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man States.</hi> — All <hi>Germany</hi> laugh at the <hi>Low Dutch,</hi> and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> laugh as heartily at the <hi>Flemings.</hi>—Each <hi>Country</hi> in <hi>England</hi> make themſelves <hi>merry</hi> at the Expence of <hi>another;</hi> but all <hi>England</hi> ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule the <hi>Scotch, Welch</hi> and <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and theſe, I ſuppoſe, <hi>return the Compliment.</hi>— Thus we have all the lucky Faculty of finding <hi>Perfection in ourſelves,</hi> and ſeeing the <hi>Contrary</hi> in our Neighbours.</p>
                     <p>WHATEVER might have been the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for holding the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in Contempt, even to <hi>Hatred,</hi> I can truly ſay, thoſe Reaſons muſt have long ſince ceaſed.

are not, as ſome imagine, a <hi>Wen</hi> on the Neck of <hi>England,</hi> that diſgraces our <hi>Form,</hi> and ſucks up our <hi>natural Juices.</hi> No, my Lord; but as it certainly is in our Power to make <hi>them ſo,</hi> it is as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that we <hi>may</hi> and <hi>ought</hi> to render them a <hi>Strength</hi> and a <hi>Support</hi> to the <hi>Britiſh Government.</hi>

               <p>I AM afraid I have carried my Reader too far from the Subject-Matter of this Hiſtory, and try'd his Patience; but I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure him that my Indulgence has been very great; for, at infinite Pains, I have cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail'd the laſt Chapter at leaſt Sixty Pages. —Few know the Difficulty of <hi>Bridling</hi> the <hi>Imagination,</hi> and <hi>Reining back</hi> an hard-mouth'd <hi>Pen.</hi> It ſometimes gets a-head, and, in Spite of all our Skill, runs away with us into <hi>Mire</hi> and <hi>Dirt;</hi> nay, this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute I find my Quill in a Humour to gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop, ſo ſhall ſtop him ſhort in Time.</p>
               <p>THUS we have ſeen the agreeable Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Mr. <hi>Conyers</hi> paſs'd away many Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and thus did he eſtabliſh himſelf in
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0558800102:127"/>
the Affections of his Company, and in the Love of the Inhabitants, by many Acts of generous Charity. <hi>Colonel Manly,</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, held him in great Eſteem, and carried his Friendſhip ſo far, as to promiſe his Intereſt with the <hi>Borough</hi> for a <hi>Seat</hi> in <hi>Parliament</hi> on the firſt Vacancy.</p>
               <p>MR. CONYERS had now experienced perfect Happineſs for above a Year.—He knew the great Secret of enjoying the <hi>good Things of this World,</hi> ſo as not to <hi>abuſe them.</hi>—His <hi>Fortune,</hi> his <hi>faithful</hi> and <hi>agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Companion,</hi> his <hi>Family,</hi> and the <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Reſpect</hi> of all, were the Rewards of his <hi>honeſt</hi> Intentions to <hi>all Mankind.</hi> In a Word, <hi>the Elements in him were ſo mix'd,</hi> that he deſerv'd the honourable Title of <hi>a Man.</hi>— But this World is not made for <hi>permanent</hi> and laſting Joys! — His <hi>Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Tranquillity,</hi> and every <hi>domeſtick Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> vaniſh'd in a Moment, and left him as awaken'd out of a Dream of Bliſs.—He had a Proſpect of an Increaſe to his Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, but the Diſappointment added to his Pains.</p>
               <p>MRS. CONYERS was near Lying-in, but an ignorant Servant Maid telling her a moſt frightful Story of the <hi>Rebellion,</hi> which had juſt then broke out, threw her into a <hi>Fit</hi> and violent Tremor, which brought
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0558800102:128"/>
on an improper Labour. She was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered of a Boy, who died ſoon after, and in four Days the <hi>kind,</hi> the <hi>tender,</hi> the <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate</hi> and <hi>agreeable</hi> Mrs. <hi>Conyers,</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd her Child.</p>
               <p>THE Diſtraction and real Grief of the Family and their Friends is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd. Mr. <hi>Conyers</hi> bore this dreadful Stroke like a <hi>Man,</hi> but <hi>he felt it like a Man.</hi> His Exclamations were few, but his Sighs and the Throbbings of his Heart were without Number. His <hi>inky Coat</hi> was not the only Sign of Sorrow. The invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Tear, the Heavings of his Breaſt, and the Alteration of his Countenance, gave viſible Marks of <hi>ſincere Affliction.</hi>—Let me at once quit the melancholy Subject, and bring my Friend to a State of Mind a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more compoſed and reſigned.—He aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured Mr. and Mrs. <hi>Sampſon</hi> of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Affection and Love, and that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his <hi>deareſt Wife</hi> had made no <hi>Will,</hi> he knew her Intention, and would fulfil it. Accordingly, new Writings were drawn, and he made them a Compliment of <hi>Three thouſand Pounds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HIS gloomy Countenance would have had a much longer Duration, had not the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion</hi> rous'd his Indignation. He thought his Duty to his <hi>Sovereign</hi> call'd him from
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0558800102:129"/>
Inaction, and the Love of his <hi>Country</hi> ſeem'd prior to every other Regard. To beſtow hard Names on <hi>Rebels,</hi> and ſupinely to ſigh at inteſtine War, he judg'd, was <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly</hi> and imprudent. He had no Idea, that the Choice of <hi>Liberty</hi> or <hi>Slavery</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd a Moment's Heſitation. Full of <hi>Freedom</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> he unboſom'd his Thoughts to the Colonel. — <q>My dear Friend, <hi>ſaid this venerable but hearty old Gentleman,</hi> I muſt love you the more for this.—Yes, my dear <hi>Conyers,</hi> go — fight for your Country, and <hi>God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty</hi> preſerve and give you Victory!— Did my great Age permit, I would be your Companion, and ſhare in the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.—I well remember, tho' then a Boy, the Inſolence of a <hi>Popiſh Government.</hi> I remember the <hi>Seven Biſhops</hi> in the Tower. —The Swarms of <hi>Friers</hi> in St. <hi>James</hi>'s Park.— The Sham <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> and a thouſand other Enormities. — Young as I was, I follow'd my Father, and join'd the <hi>Prince of Orange.</hi>—I fought and bled for him and <hi>Liberty</hi> at the <hi>Boyne.</hi> —I fought for <hi>Liberty</hi> and KING GEORGE at <hi>Dumblain,</hi> and what Man, who has a Soul, and a Senſe of our <hi>invaluable Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings,</hi> but would venture, nay lay down his Life for <hi>them?</hi>— Now I am Old and Infirm, but my Heart is good, —indeed
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0558800102:130"/>
it is</q>—The poor Gentleman could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed no farther, for Tears choak'd his Words. Mr. <hi>Conyers</hi> was greatly affected, and ſaid all in his Power to eaſe the <hi>Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel</hi>'s Heart.— <q>You muſt forgive, <hi>ſaid the Colonel,</hi> the Weakneſs of an old Man.— I cannot help it.—But, when I think on Times paſt,—On the Danger our <hi>Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi> has, ſo often, been in, and the noble and ſucceſsful Struggles we have made to defend it.—When I think on theſe Things, my <hi>Pulſe</hi> forgets its Age, and beats as ſtrong as in Youth.—<hi>Good God!</hi>—What is it we <hi>want!</hi>—Is there a <hi>reaſonable Bleſſing</hi> that we do not, or may not enjoy! — Are we blind to our own <hi>Happineſs,</hi> and can ſome, who call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> even think of a <hi>Popiſh King</hi> but with Horror?—Can we be ſo ſtupid as not to ſee the <hi>old,</hi> the <hi>ſtale Trick</hi> of <hi>France?</hi> And muſt ſome of us always fall into ſo weak a Project?—Poor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded Men! But thank God, we have ſtill <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom</hi> ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of their Errors.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>FROM my Soul I wiſh it, <hi>reply'd</hi> Mr. <hi>Conyers,</hi> neither have I the leaſt Doubt. —For my Part, I am determin'd, and will immediately prepare for the <hi>Field.</hi>— I believe, <hi>ſaid the Colonel,</hi> I can aſſiſt
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0558800102:131"/>
you.—Let me ſee—Ay—I have a <hi>Tent,</hi> and every Camp-Neceſſary, in good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for I frequently viſit them to refreſh my Memory. — Theſe are your's, with two excellent Baggage Horſes, and a Baw-Man that underſtands his Buſineſs. —Dear Sir, <hi>ſaid</hi> Mr. <hi>Conyers,</hi> you have made me quite happy.—I am already in the Field. — Softly, ſoftly, <hi>anſwer'd the Colonel,</hi> perhaps I may do ſomewhat more. I would not have you go with <hi>Irregulars,</hi> for it will not be ſo Satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.—A <hi>Noble Duke</hi> is about raiſing a <hi>Regiment</hi> of HORSE.—He does me the Honour to rank me with his intimate Friends, and I will immediately ſend an Expreſs, and write him ſuch a Letter, that, perhaps, ſhall put you in a Light of Honour, and enable you to be <hi>really uſeful.</hi>
                  </q>—Mr. <hi>Conyers</hi> return'd him many Thanks, and he was exact to his Promiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>WE muſt now, <hi>ſaid the Colonel,</hi> think of engaging a few good Volunteers to accompany you to the Regiment, in caſe you ſucceed. We muſt be buſy, and go roundly to work.</q> — In a few Days they fix'd on twenty young Fellows, moſtly Sons of Tenants. — In a ſhort Time the Colonel received a moſt polite and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Anſwer to his Letter. It concluded—
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0558800102:132"/>
                  <q>From the great Character you give Mr. <hi>Conyers,</hi> he cannot fail of being extremely agreeable. I am ſorry I have but a Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancy to offer him. Should this be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of, I beg an Anſwer by Expreſs, and that he would join the Regiment at ***** with all Speed, with whatever good Men he can pick up.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>LIEUTENANT <hi>Conyers, ſaid the Colonel,</hi> I moſt heartily wiſh you Joy.—Now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Matters put on a better Face, and you are equipp'd as you ought to be.— But, Buſtle, Buſtle.—Take Leave of the good People at Home; make your Will, and—<hi>To Horſe and away.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>TAKING Leave, was a Taſk he could wiſh to be excus'd, but it was impoſſible. Mr. <hi>Sampſon</hi> was ſtruck Dumb at the News, but his good Wife loſt all Patience. She could not comprehend the Neceſſity of his going in <hi>Perſon,</hi> when he might by <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty.</hi> She quoted many Examples of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, of Fortunes infinitely ſuperior to his, who contented themſelves with <hi>paying a little Money,</hi> and <hi>drinking Succeſs</hi> to the Cauſe.—<q>Yes, yes, my Dear, <hi>ſaid her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,</hi> they muſt be ſpecial <hi>good Subjects,</hi> who are only <hi>warm</hi> in the Cauſe, by the Quantity of Liquor they drink. I vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently ſuſpect ſuch Sort of People, and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0558800102:133"/>
am not ſorry to find my dear Brother of another Way of Thinking. I am only concern'd that ſuch an unhappy Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhould deprive us of his Company, and throw him into Danger; but I truſt in God, he will return in Safety and with Victory.'—If he muſt go, <hi>reply'd</hi> Mrs. <hi>Sampſon,</hi> I pray God to protect and ſhield him.</q>—The Converſation became more familiar, and by degrees he perſuaded them to excuſe the Ceremony of Parting, which would give Pain, and make him miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
               <p>WITH all imaginable Diligence he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for his Departure. He ſent forward twenty-three Recruits under the Care of two of his Tenants. He left a <hi>Will</hi> with Dr. <hi>Grace,</hi> and a Power with Mr. <hi>Sampſon</hi> to receive his Rents, and remitted Five Hundred Pounds to the Agent of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, that he might draw on him as Occaſions required. He concerted Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with the Colonel, and his Horſes and Baggage filed off by Degrees to the next Town. He invited ſome Friends to Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the next Day, which was <hi>Sunday;</hi> ſo the Family was ſure of him for one Meal more. However, whilſt they were at Church, the Colonel called in his Chariot and accompany'd him, where the Horſes
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0558800102:134"/>
attended. The old Gentleman gave him a proper Letter to <hi>his Grace,</hi> and ſtay'd with him that Night. In the Morning he took a Soldier-like Farewell; ſaw him ſet out for the Regiment, and return'd in the Evening to give Mr. <hi>Sampſon</hi> an Account of their Expedition.</p>

                     <p>I TAKE this firſt Opportunity of fulfilling my Promiſe, by laying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you what my Age and Experience judge neceſſary for your Well-doing.</p>
                     <p>YOU are a Man of <hi>Property,</hi> and now enliſted to fight the Cauſe of <hi>Freedom,</hi> and of <hi>That</hi> MONARCH who has <hi>ever ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported it.</hi>—You are a <hi>Soldier.</hi> You are one of <hi>thoſe</hi> on whom, <hi>under God,</hi> the <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> of this Nation depend. —Conſider the <hi>Dignity</hi> of your Station.— Conſider the <hi>mighty Truſt</hi> repoſed in you. Conſider yourſelf, and it is ſcarcely poſſible you will err in your Conduct.</p>
                     <p>I AM poſitive as to your <hi>perſonal Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,</hi> for your Soul is <hi>humane</hi> and <hi>tender,</hi> and your Tongue is not a <hi>Bragart;</hi> but as your Behaviour in this new Scene of Life is what I am not ſo certain of, your Good-nature will excuſe a little Advice, and attribute my <hi>Trite Maxims,</hi> more
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0558800102:136"/>
to the Warmth of my Friendſhip, than to any Occaſion you may have for them.</p>
                     <p>TO be an <hi>Officer,</hi> there is no Neceſſity of being inſpired with ſupernatural Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents. <hi>Common Senſe,</hi> and the <hi>Deportment</hi> of a Gentleman are ſufficient. The Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of your <hi>Duty,</hi> and the <hi>Military Art,</hi> will come with <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Experience;</hi> but a cloſe Application to the Study is neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>THE Love of the Soldiers is the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of an <hi>Officer;</hi> and to gain <hi>that Love,</hi> the Method is ſhort and eaſy.— <hi>Pay and puniſh where due, but never ſtrike.</hi> — Be free with your Men, but ſuffer them not to be too free with you. An <hi>haughty,</hi> over-bearing Temper, may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed inſpire them with <hi>Fear,</hi> but never with <hi>Affection.</hi> Treat them as <hi>Men,</hi> and they will reſpect you as <hi>their Officer;</hi> but at the ſame Time, be careful that the <hi>Non-commiſſion'd</hi> Officers act in the ſame Manner, and <hi>ſupport</hi> their proper Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, on which all <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Submiſſion</hi> depends.</p>
                     <p>ENDEAVOUR, as much as poſſible, to keep your Men <hi>clean</hi> and <hi>decent;</hi> it gives <hi>Spirits,</hi> and prevents <hi>Drunkenneſs</hi> and <hi>Debauchery.</hi> — Drop in at their Meals,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0558800102:137"/>
taſte their Victuals, encourage them to keep good Meſſes, and reprove where you find them remiſs.</p>
                     <p>BE aſſiduous to learn the <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of a Soldier, and keep your Men diligent at it, yet ſo as not to fatigue them unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily. See that they punctually obey your Commands, but be not too ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous in <hi>trivial Matters.</hi> Believe me, the Men ſoon find out the <hi>Genius</hi> of their Officers, and will never <hi>impoſe</hi> or play Tricks, when they know they cannot do it with <hi>Impunity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>MAKE it a conſtant Rule to <hi>obey</hi> with <hi>Alacrity</hi> and <hi>Chearfulneſs</hi> every Order of your Superiors: Such a Conduct will add to your <hi>Reputation,</hi> and confirm your <hi>Character.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>SLANDER and <hi>Scandal</hi> ſometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate themſelves into Camps, and too frequently attack the moſt Deſerving. Let me beg of you to turn the deaf Ear to <hi>evil Report,</hi> and not be ſpeedily <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced</hi> againſt any Man, much leſs your Commanders.</p>
                     <p>IF an <hi>Officer</hi> need not have all the <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> of a Privy-Counſellor, he ought, at leaſt, to have that Part that enjoins <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy.</hi> The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Proverb is good:— <hi>In a cloſed Mouth no Flies enter.</hi>—Execute
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0558800102:138"/>
your Orders in Silence, and let not the moſt <hi>diſtant Hint,</hi> of the Conduct of the Army, eſcape from your <hi>Lips</hi> or your <hi>Pen.</hi> Should you know nothing parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, your Words muſt be mere Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, and, in all Probability, quite wrong. Should a material Circumſtance come to your Knowledge, what <hi>Infamy</hi> muſt follow your diſcloſing it!</p>
                     <p>COMPANY and <hi>Chearfulneſs</hi> are abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary, but to <hi>drink</hi> to <hi>Exceſs</hi> is inexcuſable. The <hi>Lives</hi> of <hi>Thouſands</hi> depend on the <hi>Sobriety</hi> of <hi>Officers.</hi>—How can a <hi>Drunkard</hi> guide Men truly, when his own Legs <hi>mutiny,</hi> and refuſe his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands?</p>
                     <p>BE <hi>charitable;</hi> be <hi>generous</hi> according to your Power; but ſeldom give <hi>Money</hi> to a Soldier. When you think proper to <hi>Reward</hi> or <hi>Encourage,</hi> there are other Ways infinitely more uſeful to them.</p>
                     <p>RISE early, and examine your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; keep them reaſonably employ'd, and under the <hi>ſtricteſt Diſcipline;</hi> but let your <hi>own Example</hi> keep Pace with your <hi>Precepts.</hi> Have all your Affairs in ſo <hi>nice</hi> and <hi>exact</hi> an Order, as to be always <hi>ready</hi> to march at a Moment's Warning. All Men ought to accuſtom themſelves
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0558800102:139"/>
to <hi>Regularity;</hi> but none requires it more than a <hi>Soldier.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>YOUR natural <hi>good Temper</hi> will prevent your giving <hi>Offence</hi> to any One, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps incline you to bear patiently <hi>thoſe</hi> offered to you; but <hi>have a Care,</hi> and let what will be the Conſequence, permit no Man to <hi>Taunt</hi> or <hi>Inſult</hi>—Should the leaſt Particle of <hi>Contempt</hi> fall on you, quit a Service, where you muſt do <hi>more Harm</hi> than <hi>Good.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>WITH regard to your <hi>preſent Enemies,</hi> hold them not <hi>too cheap.</hi>—Speak of them as Men of an <hi>unhappy Education,</hi> led away by <hi>falſe Maxims,</hi> and prejudiced to <hi>erroneous Principles:</hi> They are, or ought to be, our <hi>Brethren.</hi>—Let your <hi>Humanity</hi> extend to them as far as <hi>Safety</hi> and <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> will permit. If abſolute and <hi>fatal Neceſſity</hi> compels you to ſtrike, let the Sword fall from no other Motive but the <hi>General Good.</hi> — Let it be <hi>effectual,</hi> but <hi>inſtant.</hi> — In that unhappy Caſe drive every <hi>Womaniſh Weakneſs</hi> from your Heart, and conſider, that too much <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> and <hi>Tenderneſs</hi> may be Cruelty to your Country.—The <hi>Action,</hi> or neceſſary Purſuit over, let <hi>Clemency</hi> and <hi>Compaſſion</hi> fill your Breaſt.—Should you <hi>conquer,</hi> be all <hi>Mildneſs</hi> and <hi>Charity.</hi> —Comfort the

Priſoner; aſſiſt the wretched Wounded; ſpeak Peace to deſpairing Souls, and, if poſſible, ſhew them the Joys of <hi>Freedom</hi> and <hi>Liberty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I have done, and diſcharged the Office annexed to <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Friendſhip.</hi> If my Hints are uſeleſs to you, perhaps you may know thoſe to whom they may be of Service.</p>

My Taſk is only relative to the private Character of <hi>Jack Connor,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Conyers.</hi> A <hi>Lawyer</hi> only ſpeaks from his <hi>Brief,</hi> and in all thoſe Pages on which <hi>this Hiſtory</hi> is founded, I find little or no Traces of the Actions of the Times.—I own I met with
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0558800102:143"/>
a Paper, that I ſuppoſe ſerv'd as <hi>Memoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dums</hi> and Hints to Mr. <hi>Conyers.</hi> It was dated like a Journal, but gave me little Inſight into Affairs. I find the Words — <hi>They ſlipp'd by — We march'd to — Miſs'd again — Slipp'd again — Men much harraſs'd —Vaſtly oblig'd to</hi> London <hi>Subſcription—The Inhabitants of ***** deſerve Encouragement, but the City of ***** to be burnt.—Thank God we have got our Troops from</hi> Flanders. —<hi>The</hi> DUKE <hi>to command.—Our People in great Spirits.—Victory or Death.</hi>—Then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd in Capital Letters, CULLODEN 16th APRIL 1746. THEY WERE WEIGH'D IN THE BALLANCE, AND FOUND LIGHT.</p>
               <p>WHEN he reflected on the happy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of the <hi>Glorious Day.</hi>— When he conſidered, that <hi>Freedom, Liberty, Religion,</hi> and <hi>his Majeſty's Auguſt Family</hi> were more firmly eſtabliſh'd and confirmed to <hi>Great Britain.</hi>—That a full Period was put to <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Slaughter,</hi> and to that <hi>unnatural Monſter,</hi> CIVIL WAR, his Heart <hi>exulted,</hi> and his <hi>Joy</hi> was extreme. — He very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly returned his Acknowledgments to <hi>that Providence,</hi> which had ſo often and ſo ſignally preſerved our <hi>invaluable Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges,</hi> and had protected him in the Midſt of ſo many Dangers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:0558800102:144"/>HE wrote a particular Account of this Battle to Mr. <hi>Sampſon</hi> and <hi>Colonel Manly.</hi> He vaſtly extoll'd the <hi>Skill</hi> and <hi>Judgment</hi> of the <hi>General,</hi> and the <hi>Valour</hi> of the Troops. In his Letter to the Colonel, he has theſe remarkable Words:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I THINK I ſee all <hi>England</hi> in a <hi>Joy</hi> next to <hi>Madneſs.</hi> All admire the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct</hi> and <hi>Intrepidity</hi> of <hi>his Royal Highneſs.</hi> They cannot now find <hi>Words</hi> ſufficient to expreſs their Praiſes. But of you, who know the National Infirmity, give me Leave to aſk, <hi>How long will this laſt?</hi> —Will they not ſoon be <hi>equally eager</hi> to <hi>ſtrip him</hi> of his <hi>Laurels?</hi>—Will not <hi>Envy, Malice,</hi> and <hi>Diſaffection</hi> ſoon endeavour to poiſon the Minds of the People, and <hi>blaſt</hi> the Reputation of Him, who riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qued his own to preſerve their <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Properties?</hi>—I fear he muſt expect ſuch Treatment. I doubt our <hi>Gratitude,</hi> and moſt heartily wiſh, for the Honour of the Kingdom, that I may be deceived. This <hi>War,</hi> and the <hi>Danger</hi> of it is over, conſequently the <hi>Inſtruments of Safety,</hi> will ſoon be ſacrific'd to the <hi>Parſimony</hi> of their Purſe, and every <hi>diſbanded Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier</hi> expoſed to the <hi>Inſults</hi> of every Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant. — For my own Part, I ſo much admire the <hi>Military Virtues</hi> of my <hi>Leader,</hi>

               <p>HE greatly commiſerated the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Priſoners, now ſubject to the <hi>injured Laws</hi> of their Country. To avert the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment due to ſuch <hi>Crimes,</hi> was not in his Power; but to make them eaſy, and alleviate their Sorrows, was his daily Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.—He lay'd no Streſs on <hi>Victory,</hi> as it is an uncertain Determination of <hi>Right</hi> or <hi>Wrong;</hi> but he argued in the gentleſt Terms, and endeavour'd to convince them, from <hi>Hiſtory, Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>Experience,</hi> that their <hi>Prejudices</hi> were ill founded. — That, they were <hi>Dupes</hi> to the Politicks of <hi>France,</hi> and acted like <hi>Children</hi> who diſobey the beſt of <hi>Parents.</hi>—That as Criminal as they were, <hi>his Majeſty</hi> was cloathed with <hi>Mercy,</hi> and adviſed an immediate Application to his <hi>Clemency.</hi>—He ſhewed them the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <hi>late King</hi> in 1715, and very judiciouſly referred them to the Memoirs of <hi>Marchal Villars,</hi> and many other <hi>French</hi> Books, for the oppoſite Conduct of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourteenth to his <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Subjects in the <hi>Cevennes,</hi> who had <hi>taken Arms</hi> merely to defend their <hi>Religion,</hi> not to <hi>dethrone</hi> their <hi>Monarch.</hi>—Such a Conduct made Mr. <hi>Conyers</hi> vaſtly beloved, and brought ſome,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0558800102:146"/>
who were <hi>violent,</hi> to think with more <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</hi> He greatly pity'd the <hi>poor Clans,</hi> as they were bred up in a blind and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit Obedience</hi> to their <hi>Chiefs.</hi> He lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe <hi>Gentlemen</hi> who acted from <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> and <hi>Principle,</hi> but regarded thoſe, as the moſt <hi>wicked</hi> of human Beings, whoſe only Motive was <hi>to fiſh in Troubled Waters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>NOT content with this Sort of Behaviour, he endeavoured to remove <hi>our own</hi> Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, and take off that <hi>Acrimony</hi> and <hi>Ill-nature,</hi> which ſome of us are too ſubject to.—He prov'd the <hi>Injuſtice</hi> and <hi>Cruelty</hi> of Branding a <hi>whole Kingdom,</hi> for the Faults of a <hi>Few.</hi> That, even thoſe <hi>Few</hi> were fall'n <hi>Brethren,</hi> and erred in their <hi>Duty,</hi> but from their Zeal to <hi>miſtaken</hi> Opinions. That moſt of them deſerved our Pity more than our Anger. That, ſo far from perpetuating <hi>Animoſity,</hi> all Encouragement and Regard ſhould be ſhewn to the <hi>Good,</hi> and every Scheme ſet on Foot to convert the <hi>Bad.</hi>— Time and proper Management, would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince every Mortal, that, as a <hi>Union</hi> of <hi>Minds</hi> was our <hi>reciprocal</hi> Intereſt, ſo <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Friendſhip</hi> would ſoon make <hi>us, the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate Children of an indulgent Parent.</hi>

                           </opener>
                           <p>You muſt be all convinced, that the unhappy Fate of our Grand-Father <hi>King James</hi> the Second, (of Glorious and Pious Memory) was owing to the <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity</hi> and <hi>Cowardice</hi> of his Fleets and Armies.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="146" facs="tcp:0558800102:149"/>AS your <hi>Cowardice</hi> and <hi>Infidelity</hi> were the Ruin and Subverſion of our auguſt Houſe, we truſt hat the ſame Principles are capable of <hi>reſtoring</hi> us to the Throne of our Anceſtors.</p>
                           <p>TO obviate every Difficulty to theſe our juſt and laudable Purpoſes, we ſhall, by the Authority aforeſaid, convince this Nation, that our Rule will be ſalutary, and extend to the Happineſs of every Individual.</p>
                           <p>THE <hi>Riot</hi> and <hi>Habeas Corpus Acts</hi> are equally dangerous, and ſhall, with the Advice of Friends, be abrogated or ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, until a Regulation can be made, and the <hi>Holy Inquiſition</hi> introduced into the Kingdom.</p>
                           <p>AS the <hi>Grand</hi> and <hi>Petty Juries</hi> are the greateſt Evils of Civil Government, they ſhall be aboliſhed, and the Judges, whom we ſhall think proper to appoint, ſhall finally hear and determine all cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Cauſes.</p>
                           <p>PROCESSES in Civil Affairs are moſt ſhamefully and abominably abuſed. The Deciſion of <hi>Property,</hi> as now managed, is a Matter that greatly affects our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Heart, and until a proper Method can be fixed on for abridging the Laws, we ſhall take the conteſted <hi>Lands</hi> or <hi>Property</hi> into our Care and Guardianſhip.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="147" facs="tcp:0558800102:150"/>THE Inſufficiency of the <hi>Statute</hi> and <hi>Common Law</hi> of <hi>England</hi> abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire an Explaining and a <hi>Diſpenſing</hi> Power. We ſhall therefore, once more, eſtabliſh a <hi>Star Chamber-court</hi> in its fulleſt Extent.</p>
                           <p>THE many Evils ariſing from Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine Marriages is a Scandal to the Nation, and Ruin to many Thouſand Families. To remedy which, we ſhall immediately erect a <hi>Court of Wards,</hi> as in the Days of our illuſtrious Anceſtors.</p>
                           <p>THE Education of Youth is a Matter of the higheſt Importance. Our Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance ſhall watch over thoſe mighty Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge.</hi> Their Learning is too crampt and confined, but by the Aſſiſtance of <hi>Mandamuſes,</hi> we ſhall throw in ſuch Fellow Labourers from the <hi>Sorbonne</hi> and <hi>St. Omers,</hi> as will ſoon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate our grand Deſign.</p>
                           <p>LIBERTY is the greateſt Bleſſing Man can enjoy; but the Abuſe of that Liberty the greateſt Curſe: To avoid the latter, and yet keep ſtrictly to the former, it is our ſincere and determin'd Reſoluion, to indulge every Man in the peaceable and quiet Liberty of THINKING. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, tho' we would ſhew our great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and Lenity, our true Intent and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0558800102:151"/>
Meaning is, That ſhould any Perſon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to do more than merely THINK, he ſhall not only incur our higheſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, but be delivered to the <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Juriſdiction,</hi> over whom we do not pretend to have any Power, conſequently the Door of our natural Clemency will be ſhut againſt him.</p>
                           <p>FROM our unbounded Charity to weak and tender Minds, and in Imitation of our illuſtrious Grandfather, (of bleſſed Memory) it is our firm Reſolution to grant a <hi>plenary Indulgence</hi> and full <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> to all Sects and Religions whatſoever; that they ſhall exerciſe and enjoy all their reſpective Rites and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies in the ampleſt Manner, until the <hi>true and infallible Church</hi> has taken Root, and ſpread its Branches, <hi>but no longer.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>THE Liberty of the Preſs is an Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination in the Sight of God and Man. Such Power in the Hands of Unbelievers and <hi>Hereticks,</hi> gave Riſe to vile Writings and Infinity of Blaſphemies againſt the moſt Higheſt; nay, it has dared to open its Mouth againſt the <hi>Majeſty of Kings:</hi> — To contemn and make odious that great Bulwark of Monarchy, The ancient Syſtem of <hi>Divine, Hereditary</hi> and <hi>inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feaſible

Right</hi> of Princes and Potentates; — To ſtir up the Rabble againſt that mild and peaceable Doctrine of <hi>Non-Reſiſtance</hi> and <hi>Paſſive Obedience;</hi>—To un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine all the Ordinances of our Holy <hi>Mother Church;</hi> — To reproach us with <hi>Idolatry,</hi> Cruelty and Superſtition; and above all, it has been ſo wicked, to ſet before the Vulgar and Ignorant the whole Works of the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Aid of <hi>Hebrew</hi> or <hi>Greek,</hi> to the great Diſcouragement of Learning, and Increaſe of Impiety.—From a thorough Conviction of ſuch horrid Practices we ſhall, in due Time, commiſſion Thirty of our moſt able Eccleſiaſticks to read and examine all Manuſcripts, and licence ſuch only to be printed, which they ſhall judge for the Honour of God, or <hi>our own Benefit.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>AS no true Son of the Church can with Patience hear of the Havock and Devaſtation the Houſe of TUDOR made of her Lands and Revenues, nor of the many Robberies and Impieties commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in thoſe barbarous Times againſt the <hi>Holy See,</hi> and the cloiſtered Saints whom God had ſo plentifully ſcattered over the Land, our Pious Intention is, ſo ſoon as Affairs will permit, to reinſtate our <hi>Holy

                           <p>IN fine, Let us conjure you by the Duty you owe God's Hereditary Vicegerent: By the Love of Peace and Tranquillity, and by the Honour of our ſupreme and infallible Judge, to hear and conſider theſe our real and ſincere Purpoſes, ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped of any the leaſt Diſguiſe.—Conſider our Situation. — Regard our Sword!— Conſider, That the Moſt Chriſtian King is our Support; the Moſt Catholick our Helper; and thoſe in the Mountains Aſſertors of our Right.—Let therefore no <hi>unſanctify'd Biſhop</hi> preach you from your Duty, but remember the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the mighty Happineſs we intend to beſtow upon you, and be aſſured on the Faith of a Family who <hi>never forfeited their Word.</hi>— On the Faith of a Family, whoſe <hi>Virtues</hi> and <hi>Heroick</hi> Deeds are ſo fully recorded in your Hiſtories, that we

               <p>DOMESTICK Peace was once more eſtabliſhed, and the late confuſed and diſtracted Kingdom now more ſenſibly felt the Joys of publick Tranquillity.</p>
               <p>THE War with <hi>France</hi> ſtill raged in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and required the Preſence of thoſe Troops, which a Rebellion had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0558800102:155"/>
to withdraw from their Allies, and the neceſſary Orders were diſpatched for embarking ſundry Corps. Mr. <hi>Conyers</hi> was preſented to a Troop of Dragoons under theſe Orders. He now equipt himſelf in a much better Manner, and was ſo em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, that he had not Time to viſit his Friends; but contented himſelf with tender Letters to Mr. <hi>Sampſon,</hi> Colonel <hi>Manly,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Grace.</hi>—When the Regiments were compleated, the final Orders were given, and Captain <hi>Conyers</hi> attended his Duty.</p>
               <p>HE certainly obſerved a profound Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence on the Military Operations, for I only found ſome Orderly Books, written in his own Hand, which, undoubtedly, every Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer ought to do.</p>
               <p>FOR the Marches and Encampments of the Army, I muſt refer to the Gazettes of the Time.—As I ever conſult the Eaſe of my Reader, he will not condemn my Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, when he conſiders I have no Lights to guide either Him or myſelf into Affairs ſo much above our Knowledge.—However I muſt follow the Glimmerings I have, and purſue him through his Variety of Marches and foraging Parties, till I find him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped near <hi>Maeſtricht.</hi> I muſt attend him in croſſing the <hi>Maeſe</hi> with the Army,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0558800102:156"/>
and encamping in the Vicinity of the <hi>French,</hi> but, even to the Night before the laſt Battle, I have nothing particular to mention.—This Night, indeed, an Affair happened, which makes ſo material a Part of this Hiſtory, that compels a Recital, tho' with my uſual Brevity.</p>
               <p>THE Captain had been ordered, with Detachments from other Regiments, on a Command to <hi>Venlo,</hi> for Forage. Diſputes frequently happen on theſe Occaſions, which the Commanding Officer muſt be extremely careful to prevent.—By an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer's inſiſting to be ſerved out of his Tour, a Quarrel began: The Clamour was great; but the <hi>Captain</hi> running to the Spot, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted his Authority, and directed the Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in the proper Channel. The Officer whoſe Name was <hi>Thornton,</hi> and a Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Dragoons, was much out of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and dropt ſome Words, as much as to ſay—Captain <hi>Conyers</hi> would not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways at the Head of a Command!</p>
               <p>THE Foraging being over, they return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> where the Captain found an Order, from the Adjutant-General, to join the Army as ſpeedily as poſſible, after the Men and Horſes were refreſhed. He communicated this Order to the Officers of the Party, and directed them to join at
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0558800102:157"/>
the Port, preciſely at Two o'Clock in the Morning. Theſe Orders were given to the Men, and he invited the Officers to ſup with him at the <hi>Helmet,</hi> and Lieutenant <hi>Thornton</hi> was of the Party. This Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was younger than Captain <hi>Conyers,</hi> but in his Size, and many other Reſpects, extremely reſembled him. He had a very good Character in the Army, but was too apt to imagine an Affront where none was intended. As he was well liked for many good Qualities, this Fault was imputed to his Youth, and Want of Experience.</p>
               <p>LIEUTENANT <hi>Thomas</hi> was likewiſe of the Company. He was an elderly, rough Sort of a Man, who, from a low Station, had, by Accident, arrived to this Rank. He was educated, and took his Degrees, in a <hi>Stable,</hi> and, forgetful of the <hi>Title</hi> he was honoured with by <hi>his Majeſty</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, ſwore and talked as if ſtill a Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goon.—This Gentleman began the Affair of the Forage, and ſeemed to think that Lieutenant <hi>Thornton</hi> had been injured.— <q>By the L—d, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> if any Man had ſerved me ſo, I'd have ſhewn him the <hi>Difference.</hi>—Sir, <hi>reply'd Mr. Thornton,</hi> I know as well as any Man, <hi>when</hi> I am ill uſed, and ſhall take a proper Time to explain myſelf.'— 'Sir, <hi>ſaid the Captain,</hi>
                     <pb n="155" facs="tcp:0558800102:158"/>
who began to be warm, I don't know the Meaning of all this; but ſhould you imagine any ill Treatment, I beg you will ſhew the Manner, and you ſhall find me vaſtly ready to give you every <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction</hi> in my Power.— 'Spoke, <hi>cry'd Thomas,</hi> like a Gentleman, and a Man of Honour.' — Sir, <hi>ſaid Thornton,</hi> ſince I muſt ſpeak, I muſt tell you, I am a Gentleman of Family and Fortune, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, ſuperior to your ſelf! You inſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me at <hi>Venlo;</hi> you ſtopt my Men in their Duty, in a rude and uncivil Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. This, Sir, may injure my Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Honour, and calls for immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Satisfaction.' — 'That's right, <hi>ſaid Thomas,</hi> the preſent Time is always the beſt, therefore, my Advice is, to take a cool Turn on the <hi>Parade,</hi> and decide the Matter like <hi>Friends</hi> and Men of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.—Thornton</hi> roſe up, as did Captain <hi>Conyers.</hi>
                  </q>—The reſt of the Company in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed, and contrary to all Mr. <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Arguments, obliged them to ſit down in Peace.</p>
               <p>THE young Lieutenant was on fire, and the Captain almoſt as hot; but a little Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection brought him to his Reaſon.—Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, <hi>ſaid the Captain,</hi> I am ſorry for this Affair, and believe I can convince Mr.
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0558800102:159"/>
                  <hi>Thornton</hi> of a miſtaken <hi>Point of Honour.</hi>— <q>By the L—d, <hi>ſaid Thomas,</hi> your only <hi>beſt Way,</hi> is, by the Point of the Sword.</q> —Sir! <hi>ſaid the Captain, with a ſtrong Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis,</hi> Did I affront you, too?—<q>No, Sir, <hi>ſaid Thomas,</hi> not me.'— 'Then, Sir, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd the other,</hi> let me adviſe you, as you regard your Commiſſion, or your Safety, no more to interfere in our Diſputes.</q>— <hi>Thomas</hi> bit his Lips, but, prudently held his Tongue.—<hi>Conyers</hi> turned to Mr. <hi>Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and ſaid,— <q>You have deſired Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, Sir, and it is my Duty to give it, but permit me firſt to ſay, I think you began at the wrong End. What Satisfaction could my <hi>Life</hi> have afforded you, or your <hi>Death</hi> have given me, your Family or Friends? — I hope we have had Time to reflect on the Conſequences of too precipitate a Reſolution.' — 'Sir, <hi>reply'd Thornton,</hi> the Honour of an <hi>Officer</hi> is a tender Point.' — 'I confeſs it, <hi>ſaid the Captain,</hi> and therefore ought to be tenderly uſed.—No Satisfaction, Sir, can equal a Conviction of being in an Error. —Here, Sir, are the Orders I received, and ſubmit to the Gentlemen preſent, if I exceeded them, or ſhewed the leaſt Partiality.</q>—The Company agreed, that he could not avoid acting as he did; <hi>and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0558800102:160"/>
he proceeded:</hi> — <q>As to your Family and Fortune, they are in this Caſe, quite out of the Queſtion. I own, Sir, I was in an Hurry to prevent a Diſpute; but if any Expreſſions of Rudeneſs or Incivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity eſcaped from me, I am ſorry for it, and before theſe Gentlemen, moſt hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily aſk your Pardon. This, Sir, I hope, is the <hi>rational</hi> and juſt <hi>Satisfaction</hi> one Gentleman ought to aſk of another; if <hi>more</hi> is required, I muſt comply, tho' with Reluctance.</q>
               </p>
               <p>ALL the Company, except <hi>Lieutenant Thomas,</hi> who was aſleep, cryed out, — <hi>No Gentleman can deſire more,</hi> and greatly praiſed <hi>Captain Conyers.</hi> — Mr. <hi>Thornton</hi> confeſſed his Error, excuſed himſelf for his Raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and begged that no more might be ſaid about it.—The <hi>Captain,</hi> affectionately embracing him, wiſh'd for an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ſhewing his Regard and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.—<q>What Pity it is, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> that <hi>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial</hi> and <hi>inſignificant</hi> Words ſhould raiſe our Anger, to the Deſtruction of our <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Happineſs,</hi> and that Incendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries are not more ſeverely puniſhed.— Had not this good Company been more prudent than <hi>Two of us,</hi> and honeſter than a <hi>Third,</hi> One might, by this Time, have ſlept with his Fathers, and perhaps
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0558800102:161"/>
both. — But, come, Gentlemen, let us prepare for Duty where <hi>real Honour</hi> calls. Let us fight with the <hi>common Enemy,</hi> but never amongſt ourſelves. — One Bottle more and then.' — 'And then, <hi>ſaid Mr. Thornton,</hi> have at the <hi>French.</hi>
                  </q> — They finiſhed two Bottles with great Harmony, and often drank Succeſs to the DUKE, and preciſely at the Time appointed, marched out of <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> and ſoon arrived at the Camp.</p>
               <p>THIS proved a very <hi>buſy Day,</hi> and made the ſmall Village of LAWFELD Famous.— Thoſe who deſire an Account of the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, muſt not apply to me, for my whole Attention is taken up with Capt. <hi>Conyers.</hi> — When our <hi>Dragoons</hi> were ordered to Charge, the <hi>Captain</hi> did ſingular Service. He reſcued his Major, and a Lieutenant-Colonel of another Regiment.—He ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped ſeveral Parties who were driving to their Ruin, and directed them where to turn their Swords. — His <hi>Head</hi> and his <hi>Hands</hi> were at Work, and in ſhort, as the <hi>French</hi> Memoir Writers phraſe it, <hi>He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Prodigies</hi> of <hi>Valour.</hi>—In the Midſt of this, he ſaw Lieutenant <hi>Thornton,</hi> with the greateſt Bravery, waging unequal War, for he was ſurrounded by three Cavaliers. —In an Inſtant, he flew to his Relief, and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0558800102:162"/>
effectually took Care of one. By this Time Mr. <hi>Thornton</hi> was wounded in many Places, and on the Ground; the <hi>Captain</hi> received a violent Blow on his Head, and two Wounds on his left Shoulder. His Horſe was ſhot, but he manfully defended the Body of his Friend on Foot. Finding the Foe encreaſed, he deſired <hi>Quarters,</hi> and reſigned his Sword to an Officer who had juſt come up.—At firſt he imagined Mr. <hi>Thornton</hi> was killed; but obſerving ſome Signs of Life, he perſuaded ſome of the <hi>French</hi> to carry him to a Place of Safety, and was conducted along with him by the Officer, who was a Gentleman of great Humanity. All poſſible Care was taken of both; and, the Action over, they were ſent to <hi>Tongres</hi> with other Priſoners.</p>
               <p>THE Gentleman to whom he had ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered, was the <hi>Marquis de Briſſac,</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel of a Regiment of Dragoons. His Politeneſs and good Manners, correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his Quality. He daily viſited the Captain, and procured him and Mr. <hi>Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> every Neceſſary.—The Lieutenant had been ſeverely treated, having no leſs than ſeven Wounds in the Head, Shoulders, and Body. Two of them were dangerous, but his Youth and good Conſtitution ſurmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Difficulty. In three Weeks the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0558800102:163"/>
declared him in a fair Way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery; but it would require great Time.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Marquis</hi> was extremely pleaſed, and expreſſed himſelf very genteely on the Occaſion. He aſſured him, that aſſiſting two ſuch valiant Gentlemen was the higheſt Proof of his good Fortune.— <q>Tho' I was not, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> a Witneſs of your Bravery, I am ſure it muſt have been great, but the Courage of the <hi>Captain</hi> in defending you, is what I ſhall ever eſteem and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire him for. To his Valour you really owe your Life, more than to my En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to ſave it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>AS our two Priſoners recovered their Strength, the <hi>Marquis</hi> introduced them to the <hi>Duke d'Ayen,</hi> with other Officers of Family and Diſtinction, and every Polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Reſpect was paid them.— They had now their own Servants and Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and a Credit for Money. In two Months Capt. <hi>Conyers</hi> was in good Health, but his Left Arm was uſeleſs. He got Permiſſion, on his Parole, to go to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, but promiſed his Friend to return ſoon, and, if poſſible, go with him to <hi>Aix-la-Chapelle,</hi> which was neceſſary for both.</p>
               <p>CAPTAIN <hi>Conyers</hi> was received with the greateſt Joy by his Corps, and highly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by his Superiors. He ſpoke of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0558800102:164"/>
Mr. <hi>Thornton</hi> in ſo noble a Manner, that the DUKE gave him a Troop of Dragoons, and Permiſſion to both, to go to <hi>Aix,</hi> or where they thought proper, to eſtabliſh their Healths. Capt. <hi>Thornton</hi> was extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſible of the Bounty and Goodneſs of <hi>his Royal Highneſs,</hi> and affectionately em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing <hi>Conyers,</hi> called him his <hi>Father, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> and <hi>Preſerver,</hi> and vow'd a perpetual Friendſhip. Capt. <hi>Conyers</hi> was not behind Hand, and promis'd to attend him, and, if poſſible, never to part.</p>
               <p>AS ſoon as Capt. <hi>Thornton</hi> was able to travel, the Friends took their Leave of the <hi>Marquis de Briſſac,</hi> the <hi>Duke d'Ayen,</hi> and others, in the politeſt Terms, and teſtified their Gratitude for all the Civilities recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Capt. <hi>Thornton</hi> could not think of going to <hi>Aix</hi> till he had paid his Duty to the <hi>Duke,</hi> and kiſſed that Hand which had ſo nobly rewarded his little Services. He met with a moſt gracious Reception, and in a few Days left the Camp.</p>
               <p>CAPT. <hi>Thornton</hi> was the Second Son of Sir <hi>Roger Thornton,</hi> a Gentleman of large Fortune in <hi>Ireland</hi> and in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and a Member of the Houſe of Commons. He was about Twenty-four Years of Age, ſpoke <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> perfectly well, and underſtood <hi>Drawing,</hi> and thoſe Branches
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0558800102:165"/>
of the Mathematicks, ſo neceſſary to every Officer who chooſes to diſtinguiſh himſelf. Sir <hi>Roger</hi> allowed him Three Hundred Pounds a Year, but on this Occaſion he very liberally ſupplied him. He wrote Capt. <hi>Conyers</hi> a moſt obliging Letter, for his Son had informed him of the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he lay under. The young Captain received many Letters from his Uncle the <hi>Earl of Mountworth,</hi> in which Mr. <hi>Conyers</hi> was always honourably mentioned.</p>
               <p>CAPT. <hi>Thornton</hi> recovered very ſlowly, and Capt. <hi>Conyers</hi>'s Arm proved much worſe than was at firſt imagined. They ſtayed a long Time at <hi>Aix-la-Chapelle</hi> and <hi>Spa,</hi> and were determined to go to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> but the Peace being juſt ſigned, they changed their Reſolution, and ſet out for <hi>France.</hi>

               <p>ON their Arrival at <hi>Paris,</hi> they hired very grand Apartments in the beſt <hi>Hotel.</hi> In a few Days they were prepared to viſit the <hi>Marquis de Briſſac</hi> and the Duke <hi>d'Ayen,</hi> who received them with Marks of the greateſt Reſpect and Eſteem. They were viſited in Return, and ſoon made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Families of the Firſt Diſtinction. The <hi>Marquis</hi> recommended the ableſt Surgeon, and they went on very ſucceſsfully under his Care.</p>
               <p>THEY had been about a Month at <hi>Paris,</hi> when one Day Capt. <hi>Conyers</hi> took it into
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0558800102:167"/>
his Head to dreſs himſelf as formerly, and dine at the <hi>old Ordinary.</hi> The People of the Houſe immediately recollected him, and were much rejoiced at his Return— It ſeems <hi>Paris</hi> had greatly miſs'd the <hi>Engliſh Guineas</hi> that ſo plentifully roll'd about be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the War, and now promiſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that <hi>my Lord Anglais</hi> would ſoon pay the Expence of all their <hi>Fireworks</hi> and Illuminations.—He found none of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Acquaintances at Table; but after Dinner he begg'd the good Woman would accept of a Pot of Coffee, and enquired after them.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>MONSIEUR <hi>Maquereau, ſaid ſhe,</hi> had very bad Fortune at <hi>Play,</hi> and was ſo reduced, that for ſome Time he lived on the Women of the Town; but at laſt he got <hi>Religion</hi> into his Head, and went into <hi>La Trappe.</hi>—The <hi>Chevalier Fanfaron</hi> was very unlucky, for about a Year ago he <hi>died of his Wounds.</hi>'—I ſuppoſe, <hi>ſaid Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyers,</hi> the <hi>Chevalier</hi> had an Affair of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and fell by it.' — 'All I know, <hi>ſaid the Landlady,</hi> is, the <hi>Chevalier</hi> killed a Gentleman one Night on <hi>Pont-Neuf,</hi> and was ſo unfortunate as to be taken and <hi>broke Alive</hi> on the Wheel, at <hi>the Greve.'</hi>—'So much for the Chevalier, <hi>ſaid the Captain,</hi> but you don't tell me
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0558800102:168"/>
a Word of my good Friend <hi>Monſieur Penſé.</hi> I hope no Accident has happened to him.'— 'Ah, poor Gentleman! <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> indeed, he is greatly to be pity'd. 'Tis now juſt two Years ſince the <hi>Archers</hi> got into his Lodgings, took him out of Bed, ſeized all his Papers and Effects, and carry'd them to the <hi>Baſtile.</hi> God knows if he be dead or alive. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body ſaid he was a <hi>Spy</hi> for the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and ſo the poor good Man was ruined.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THE Captain enquired for no more, but finiſhed the Coffee, thank'd the good Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and went in a Hurry to his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. He was vaſtly moved at the Fate of <hi>Penſé,</hi> and determin'd to try his Intereſt to ſave him, if it was not too late.—He ſoon dreſs'd, and follow'd Captain <hi>Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> to the <hi>Marquis</hi>'s, where he had dined. The Company were informed of the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>diſhabillé</hi> and imputed it, and his long Stay, to ſome Affair of <hi>Gallantry,</hi> on which he was heartily railly'd. He railly'd in his Turn, and the Converſation fell into the uſual Channel. The Duke <hi>d'Ayen</hi> came in ſoon after, and in a little Time the whole Company went to the <hi>Opera.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>CAPTAIN <hi>Conyers</hi> took Care to place himſelf next to the <hi>Duke,</hi> and at laſt found an Opportunity of mentioning the Caſe of
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0558800102:169"/>
                  <hi>Penſé.</hi> He concluded with aſſuring his Lordſhip, that he held the Office of a <hi>Spy</hi> in the utmoſt Contempt: <q>But, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> this unhappy Man has formerly render'd me more Services than I can ever repay; therefore I hope your Lordſhip will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Gratitude I owe, and grant a Favour to me, and not to him.'—'I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, <hi>ſaid the Duke,</hi> I never heard of this Man, but all in my Power you may command. I ſhall ſpeak to my Father, <hi>(Marſhal Noailles)</hi> and intereſt myſelf to the utmoſt. Should I ſucceed, you ſhall ſoon hear of it, but my <hi>Silence</hi> will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you of the Impoſſibility.</q>
               </p>
               <p>CONYERS paſs'd four Days in great Anxiety, but the fifth he had a Viſit from the <hi>Duke,</hi> who, after ſome Converſation, told him, his Friend was alive.— <q>Then, my Lord, <hi>ſaid the Captain,</hi> ſo am I. This is a great Point gain'd; but I hope more remains.'— 'Yes, <hi>reply'd the Duke,</hi> I will not keep you longer in Suſpence. The <hi>Marſhal</hi> with ſome Difficulty, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook the Cauſe, and I have brought you an Order to the <hi>Governor,</hi> to deliver Mr. <hi>Penſé</hi> and all his Effects, into your Hands, but with this Injunction, that he quits <hi>Paris</hi> in twenty-four Hours, and <hi>France</hi> in a Week.</q>—The Captain took
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0558800102:170"/>
the Order, and moſt heartily thank'd the Duke.— <q>I know not, <hi>ſaid this Nobleman,</hi> how <hi>Penſé</hi> eſcaped, for he has been a moſt notorious Offender; but his Art was great, and by little Diſcoveries pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted his Time ſo long, that I believe, at laſt, they were aſhamed to hang him. —But I ſee you are impatient to be the Meſſenger of good News, and ſhall only add, that I expect you To-morrow at Dinner.</q>—He was in the higheſt Delight, and immediately drove to the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by Capt. <hi>Thornton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE proper Compliments being paid to the <hi>Governor,</hi> the Captain mentioned Mr. <hi>Penſé,</hi> but was anſwer'd civilly, tho' in a cold unſatisfactory Manner.— <q>Sir, <hi>ſaid the Captain,</hi> I believe I have a Paper in my Hand, that will convince you I am not here to aſk impertinent Queſtions.</q>— When the Governor had read and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully examin'd the <hi>Order,</hi> he behaved quite in another Manner, and directed a Servant to call Mr. <hi>Penſé</hi> to him.—He ſpoke much of the poor Man, but ſeem'd to hint, that all Things conſider'd, he had ſurpriſing good Fortune.—<hi>Penſé</hi> was conducted into the Chamber, but his Countenance was ſo changed, that his Friend ſcarcely knew him.—He bow'd and trembled. — A ſmall
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0558800102:171"/>
Silence intervened, but, fixing his Eyes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently on Captain <hi>Conyers,</hi> and, at laſt, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diting their Evidence, he cry'd out.—<hi>It is he,</hi> and flew to his Arms. He hung on his Neck. He had not Words to teſtify his Amazement. He claſp'd him, and was in an Agony of Joy, till Tears moderated the Exceſs. He ſobb'd, and aſk'd broken Queſtions, every Moment embracing his Friend.—The Scene was very moving, nor could the <hi>Captain</hi> refrain the manly honeſt Tribute of a Tear.</p>
               <p>THE Governor told Mr. <hi>Penſé,</hi> that he was at Liberty to go with the Gentlemen. That his Papers were ſealed up, as was the Value of his Effects in a Box, which he might take with him; but gave him the Orders about quitting the Kingdom. — Mr. <hi>Penſé</hi> made many Compliments, but ſeem'd to wiſh he was out of the Walls, which Half an Hour ſaw done; and the Captain conducted him to his Lodgings.</p>
               <p>AS his Time was to be ſhort in <hi>Paris,</hi> they abridg'd a thouſand Queſtions to each other, and reſerved them for a more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Opportunity, only the <hi>Captain</hi> mention'd the Situation he was in, as to Rank and Fortune, which gave the old Man a moſt ſenſible Pleaſure. — They now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd his <hi>Finances,</hi> and found he had a
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0558800102:172"/>
Remainder of ſix hundred Pounds <hi>Sterling.</hi> They debated on the Application of the Money, but found, that the mere Intereſt would by no Means afford him a decent Maintenance. — <q>My dear Friend, <hi>ſaid Penſé,</hi> let me ſettle this Affair.— Take the Money, and allow me what you think proper, by way of Penſion, during my Life.</q>—Be it ſo, <hi>reply'd the Captain,</hi> and immediately he drew up a little Inſtrument, and gave him a Letter to his Banker in <hi>London,</hi> to honour his Bills for <hi>twenty-five Pounds for every three Months.</hi>—Poor <hi>Penſé</hi> once more ſhed Tears, and could only add —<hi>You are too good, and I am too happy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>MANY Towns were propoſed for his Reſidence, for to <hi>England</hi> he could not ſafely go, and the Captain fixed on <hi>Bruſſels</hi> as a cheap and agreeable Place. Matters being thus adjuſted, they paſs'd the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the Day to their mutual Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; and next Morning <hi>Penſé</hi> bid Adieu to his faithful Friend, and took the Coach to <hi>Liſle,</hi> but not before the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain had obliged him to accept of <hi>Forty Pieces.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>PERHAPS I ought to extol the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature of Capt. <hi>Conyers:</hi> — To paint his Friendſhip in the brighteſt Colours, and to ſhew the Amiableneſs and Self-Satisfaction
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0558800102:173"/>
of a grateful Heart.—By ſo doing, ſhould I not deprive my Reader of the Pleaſure of doing it himſelf? — When I conſult my own Eaſe, 'tis only with a View of indulging his Judgment.</p>

               <p>CAPT. <hi>Thornton</hi> was not yet quite cured; for his Wounds, by ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Irregularities, had frequently opened. Capt. <hi>Conyers</hi> was perfectly recover'd; and as his Regiment had been for ſome Time in <hi>England,</hi> he began to conſider that his Duty required his Preſence. Whilſt he was preparing to attend it, he received a Letter that gave him Pain and Pleaſure. In ſhort, the Regiment was <hi>broke.</hi> He was now his own Maſter, and determin'd to ſtay with his Friend till he was quite fit to Travel.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:0558800102:174"/>
                  <q>SINCE, ſaid he, that I am now at full Liberty, and have an eaſy Fortune, ought I not to think on thoſe Friends to whom I owe my very Being? Perhaps that dear good Man Mr. <hi>Kindly,</hi> or ſome of his Family may want my Aſſiſtance.— Perhaps I may be uſeful to the worthy Lord <hi>Truegood,</hi> or his charming Sons. Heavens! what a Joy muſt I not feel at contributing to their Satisfaction! What Pleaſure will they not receive at ſeeing their little <hi>Jack</hi> completely happy! — Ought I not to think on my Mother? Ought I not to ſeek her out, and relieve her Diſtreſſes? and have I not neglected theſe Duties too long?</q>—Such Thoughts made him glow with alternate Shame and Pleaſure, and determin'd him to viſit <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> as ſoon as poſſible.</p>
               <p>THE Captains paſs'd their Time in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> in the moſt agreeable Manner, and were much reſpected by the Ladies. I find a few Hints that perſuade me, they were not without Amuſements of a delicate Nature; but as the Papers are ſilent as to the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, ſo muſt I.</p>
               <p>IT happen'd that Capt. <hi>Magragh</hi> of Lord <hi>Clare</hi>'s Regiment, had lately taken Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the ſame <hi>Hotel.</hi> This Gentleman thought it his Duty to pay his Reſpects to
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0558800102:175"/>
the two <hi>Engliſh</hi> Officers, and made them a very civil Viſit. They received him in a polite Manner, and in an Hour's Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation found out his <hi>Rank</hi> and his Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. He was of a lively Soldier-like Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and very communicative. His Father had quitted <hi>Ireland,</hi> and follow'd the Fortune of <hi>King James the Second.</hi> He was born in <hi>France,</hi> but ſpoke <hi>Engliſh</hi> with a prodigious <hi>Iriſh</hi> Accent, tho' he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been in that Kingdom. He told them of the vaſt Eſtate his Father loſt in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and how near he was, the other Day, of recovering it. He ſpoke of the War in <hi>Germany</hi> and in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and gave them a Hiſtory of his own Exploits. He men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the Valour of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and without conſidering the <hi>French Policy,</hi> ſeem'd to glory in their being ſent foremoſt on the moſt deſperate Attacks. His Converſation, and the Oddity of his Language, was agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able enough, and made our Friends deſire a further Acquaintance.</p>
               <p>IN a few Days he invited them to a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel Supper, with two other Officers of the <hi>Iriſh Brigade.</hi> The Chat turn'd on War, and Capt. <hi>Magragh</hi> ſpoke very eloquently on <hi>Sieges</hi> and <hi>Battles,</hi> for he could really ſpeak on little elſe.—One of the Officers, in a laughing Way, mention'd ſomething of
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0558800102:176"/>
an unfortunate Expedition into <hi>Spain,</hi> which obliged the Captain to enlarge upon it. <q>Gentlemen, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> I muſt tell you my fatal Story. You muſt know, that my Father's Brother, that is, my Uncle by the <hi>Father's Side,</hi> was a Merchant at <hi>Cadiz.</hi> He was as rich as a thouſand <hi>Jews,</hi> and always promiſed to make me his <hi>Son and Heir,</hi> but — the Devil fire all Prieſts! About ſeventeen or eighteen Years ago, a Son of a Whore, one <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kelly,</hi> came over from <hi>Ireland,</hi> and brought his Siſter with him. She was the Widow of one <hi>Squire Connor,</hi> and young and handſome enough. What will you have of it, but my fooliſh Uncle got acquainted with this <hi>Father Kelly</hi> and his Siſter, and by my own <hi>Sowle</hi> he married her. To be ſure I wrote to my Uncle, and <hi>towld</hi> him what a <hi>Fool</hi> he was, and what a <hi>Rogue</hi> he was to cheat a Gentleman <hi>like me,</hi> and his own <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood.</hi> The old Fellow was very ſaucy, and by my own <hi>Sowle</hi> I had a great Mind to go to <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>beat his Coat.</hi> Well, Gentlemen, about two Years agon I got a Letter from a Friend at <hi>Cadiz,</hi> that my Uncle was growing ſickly; ſo I took Poſt, thinking to make it up with him, but by my <hi>Sowle,</hi> I <hi>was
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0558800102:177"/>
late,</hi> for the old <hi>Teef</hi> hid himſelf under Ground. Now, will you believe it? The Devil take me, and I ſwear by him that made me, if the old Rogue left me a <hi>grey Groat.</hi> I ſpoke to <hi>Madam my Aunt,</hi> and <hi>towld</hi> her of my Journey, and my great Expences, and of the Wrong ſhe did me, and the like, and only begg'd her to let us fairly divide the Money be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us. The Lady began to laugh, but ſaid, ſhe had ſome Commiſeration on me, and made ſome fine Speeches; but the Devil a Farthing would ſhe give but <hi>four hundred Piſtoles.</hi> I took the Money, and giving her a hearty Curſe, wiſh'd her and her <hi>thirty thouſand Pound</hi> at Hell.'—'You had hard Fortune, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, <hi>ſaid Capt. Thornton;</hi> but perhaps ſhe may make you Amends ſome Time or other.' <hi>Sir, reply'd Magragh,</hi> I ſhall never trouble her <hi>no more.</hi> I am now a Captain in the <hi>firſt beſt</hi> Regiment in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope;</hi> I have the <hi>Croſs of St. Lewis,</hi> which the King gave me, becauſe I <hi>wouldn't</hi> be kill'd at <hi>Philipſbourg,</hi> and I have a <hi>Royal</hi> Donation of <hi>three hundred Livres</hi> a Year; ſo, my Dear, what do I want? I love my Friends, and my good Friends love me; and I vow to God, I am as happy as the <hi>King himſelf,</hi> God bleſs him. I
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0558800102:178"/>
love my Countrymen the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and I love the <hi>Engliſh</hi> well enough, but <hi>Faith and Sowle,</hi> they are too hard upon us.</q>
               </p>
               <p>CAPTAIN <hi>Thornton</hi> obſerv'd a peculiar Gravity in the Countenance of his Friend, and thought, by changing the Current of Converſation, to remove it. He try'd many Ways, but <hi>Conyers</hi> ſeem'd loſt in Thought. His Silence gave a ſerious Turn to the Company, and they broke up much ſooner than was intended.</p>
               <p>NEXT Morning Captain <hi>Thornton</hi> had a very early Viſit from Mr. <hi>Conyers,</hi> for he had not ſlept. — <q>My dear <hi>Thornton, ſaid he,</hi> you muſt wonder at my Behaviour, but I inſiſt on your Friendſhip, and beg you will not require an Explanation of the only Thing I cannot divulge.</q>— <hi>Thornton</hi> imagin'd a Quarrel, and roſe in a Hurry to ſtop his going out of the Room. His Friend could not forbear laughing at his ſerious Figure, but aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him on his Honour, that a Quarrel was the leaſt in his Thoughts, the other was pacify'd and returned to his Bed.—<q>I am, <hi>ſaid Conyers,</hi> in the oddeſt Situation, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, ever Man was in. I am far from unhappy; but ſome Doubts and Anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties ſo much torment me, that I cannot be at Peace till they are ſatisfy'd.' 'Dear
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0558800102:179"/>
                     <hi>Conyers, ſaid the other,</hi> I hope you will indulge me with my Share of what gives you Uneaſineſs; I think I have a juſt Claim to it.—'I believe, <hi>reply'd Conyers,</hi> your Friendſhip is ſincere; but my Caſe is of ſuch a Nature, that as you cannot aſſiſt me, I muſt only deſire your Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</q>
               </p>
               <p>HE revolv'd a thouſand Projects to bring about his Affair in the propereſt Manner. He remember'd <hi>Father Kelly,</hi> and call'd back every Circumſtance of his Childhood ſo clearly, that he had not the leaſt Doubt but Mrs. <hi>Magragh</hi> was his Mother.—He reflected on her Features, and brought her Face familiar to his Imagination. He own'd ſhe had not been the tendereſt of Parents, but <hi>Nature</hi> ſpoke, and threw her Faults into the moſt favourable Light. He ardently wiſh'd to embrace her, and, as his filial Affection aroſe, the tender Tear fell down his Cheeks. The good, the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Heart, will not call this an unmanly Weakneſs. — The Senſations of his Soul were natural, and the reſult of an honeſt Mind. At laſt he determin'd on a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to <hi>Cadiz,</hi> and went immediately to Mr. <hi>Waters,</hi> his Banker, for proper Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:0558800102:180"/>WHILST he was ſpeaking to this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman on the neceſſary Credit he might want, he took an Opportunity of aſking him if he knew Mr. <hi>Magragh,</hi> who had been a Merchant at <hi>Cadiz.</hi> 
                  <q>Yes, Sir, <hi>reply'd Mr. Waters,</hi> extremely well, for he was my Correſpondent many Years.' I hear, <hi>ſaid the Captain,</hi> he has left a Widow, and ſhould be glad to know if ſhe be alive.' 'She was ſo, very lately, <hi>anſwer'd the Banker,</hi> for I have had Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from her about ſome Effects remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in my Hands. I aſſure you, ſhe is a very notable Woman, and vaſtly rich.' As for her Riches, <hi>ſaid Conyers,</hi> I have nothing to ſay; but you would much oblige me, by recommending me to her Notice and good Offices, in a friendly Manner; and likewiſe for another Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, wherein you will pleaſe to mention me as her <hi>near Relation.</hi> This laſt I ſhall only make Uſe of, in caſe I find her really ſo.</q> Mr. <hi>Waters</hi> very readily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, and promis'd to be very ſecret in the Affair.</p>
               <p>CAPTAIN <hi>Conyers</hi> was now much eaſier in his Mind, and the Alteration in his Conduct, gave a very ſenſible Pleaſure to his Friend, but it was of ſhort Duration, for he inform'd him, that he was oblig'd
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0558800102:181"/>
to ſet out immediately for <hi>Madrid,</hi> where his Stay ſhould be as ſhort as poſſible. Captain <hi>Thornton</hi> was oblig'd to acquieſce, and Preparations were made for his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. The <hi>Marquis de Briſſac</hi> was ſurpriz'd at the Project of Mr. <hi>Conyers,</hi> but got him Recommendatory Letters to the <hi>French Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,</hi> and advis'd his travelling with the King's Meſſenger, eſpecially as he ſeem'd in Haſte. — A Meſſenger was diſpatch'd the Week following, who had Orders to take particular Care of the Captain.—He took a Servant with him, and, with ſome Reluctance, bid adieu to his Friends.</p>

               <p>AN Account of a Journey, <hi>Poſt,</hi> muſt be very unſatisfactory to a Reader, and tire and fatigue him as much as the Traveller. I ſhall, therefore, avoid the dry, inſipid Relation, and beg of him to ſuppoſe, that no Accident happen'd on the Road, and that our Captain got ſafe to <hi>Madrid</hi> in the uſual Time. I ſhall omit the Civilities ſhew'd by the <hi>French Miniſter,</hi> who advis'd him, in the beſt Manner, for his further Journey to <hi>Cadiz.</hi> He was impatient to be there, and ſo am I.</p>
               <p>ON his Arrival, he waited on Mr. <hi>Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerald,</hi> the Merchant, on whom he had a Credit. This Gentleman received him in the moſt courteous Manner, and inſiſted
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0558800102:183"/>
on his accepting an Apartment in his Houſe. In a Day or two, Captain <hi>Conyers</hi> made an Enquiry about Mrs. <hi>Magragh,</hi> and mention'd a Letter he had for her. The Merchant told him, ſhe was an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Friend, and offering to accompany him, they immediately paid her a Viſit.— Judge, gentle Reader, the Emotions of his Soul, when Mr. <hi>Fitzgerald</hi> preſented him to his <hi>Mother,</hi> for ſuch ſhe really was.— Tho' he was determin'd in his Conduct, and had put on every Reſolution, yet he trembled and grew pale when he ſaluted her; but recovering himſelf, he attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Tremor to the Fatigue of his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, which was eaſily credited. Mrs. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gragh</hi> read the Letter, and with great Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs, aſſur'd him of her Reſpects, and Readineſs to ſerve him. They din'd that Day at Mr. <hi>Fitzgerald</hi>'s, and the Captain endeavour'd to make himſelf as agreeable as poſſible, and few Men could be more ſo. He obſerv'd, that every Body paid Mrs. <hi>Magragh</hi> a particular Reſpect; that ſhe was vaſtly improved, and ſpoke with great Strength of Reaſon and Senſe, tho' in her former Tone of Voice. <hi>Time</hi> had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a few Wrinkles to her Brow, but had taken away very little of the Beauty of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0558800102:184"/>
her Complexion. — He frequently caught himſelf too earneſtly looking at her, and very often met her Eyes.</p>
               <p>NEXT Day the Company din'd at her Houſe. Mirth and Good-humour abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and each ſtrove who ſhould add moſt. Mrs. <hi>Magragh</hi> ſhew'd a more than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Civility to the Captain, and often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, that he had much of the Air of a Gentleman who had been a very <hi>dear Friend</hi> to her and her Family. In a Word, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came familiar, which ſtill made her more agreeable.</p>
               <p>MR. FITZGERALD aſk'd, when they got home, What he had done to the Widow? <q>For, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> ſhe told me in <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> that you had ſuch a <hi>Face,</hi> and ſuch a <hi>Voice,</hi> ſhe could ſcarce keep her Eyes off of you. Faith, Captain, <hi>continued he,</hi> 'twould be very unkind to ſnap up one of our <hi>greateſt Fortunes</hi> at ſo ſhort a Warning, when ſhe has held out half a Dozen <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Sieges.</hi>
                  </q> — Mrs. <hi>Fitzgerald</hi> a little raillied him, <q>But I aſſure you, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> without a Jeſt, I never ſaw Mrs. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gragh</hi> ſo free, and ſo pleas'd with a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman in all my Life.</q>—The Captain laugh'd in his Turn, and each had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to ſay.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:0558800102:185"/>HE thought Matters were pretty ripe for an Explanation, and as Mrs. <hi>Magragh</hi> had given him a general Invitation, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd on a Viſit, and, if poſſible, to open the Scene. Next Morning he went to Breakfaſt with her, and was very kindly received. When the ordinary Chat was over, and her Maid had retir'd, he began to put his Scheme in Practice, but not without many Heſitations.—<q>Madam, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> I never thought to be ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to my Friend Mr. <hi>Waters,</hi> as I find I am, by being introduc'd to a Lady of your Merit, who has certainly afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me more Joy than ever I expected to receive.' — 'This other Letter, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, will a little help me in what I am to ſay.'—'She took the Letter, and very attentively read it, and her Eyes ſeem'd to examine him as carefully.'—'This Letter, Sir, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> informs me, that you are my Relation. I cannot ſay the contrary, but I proteſt I am at a Loſs how it can be. I own I have a very particular Regard for you on account of my Friend's hearty Recommendation.— I confeſs my Eſteem for your Perſon and Behaviour, and as you appear a Gentleman, I ſhould be ſorry to change
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0558800102:186"/>
my Conduct, by your going on any er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous Project.' — 'Give me Leave, Madam, <hi>reply'd the Captain,</hi> to aſſure you on my Honour, I have no Views, other than paying the greateſt Reſpect and <hi>Duty</hi> where I ſo naturally owe them.' — 'I ſhould think myſelf, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> extremely happy to have a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of your <hi>Character</hi> and <hi>Figure.</hi> Tho' I cannot imagine ſuch a Thing poſſible, yet I own there is ſomething that makes me wiſh it, therefore, I beg Sir, you will inform me, and doubt not but it will be to our mutual Satisfaction.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>IS it poſſible, Madam, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> that twenty Years can have worn out all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of my Face?—Can you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get our wretched Situation on the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> in <hi>Ireland?</hi>—Can my poor <hi>blind Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>—'Stop, Sir, <hi>cry'd ſhe,</hi> for Heaven's Sake! — I know not what to think! Good God! —Pray, have Patience, and let me recover my Breath.</q>—Her Agony was extreme, and he was oblig'd to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port her to the Window for Air. — <q>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Heaven, <hi>ſaid ſhe at laſt,</hi> I dare not hope for ſuch a Bleſſing, but let me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, Sir, to pull down your right Stocking.</q> — He inſtantly obey'd, and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0558800102:187"/>
when ſhe diſcover'd a large Mole on his Leg, (which he had never obſerv'd) Yes! <hi>cry'd ſhe,</hi> 'It is my <hi>deareſt,</hi> my ill-us'd <hi>Son.'</hi> —Oh, <hi>Jack!</hi> — and claſping him in her Arms in Tranſport, was, for ſome Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments depriv'd of every Senſe. He em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd her with the ſincereſt Affection, and, for a long While, neither could utter a Syllable.</p>
               <p>ONCE more I muſt indulge the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the kind Reader, and permit him to ſupply, from his own natural Stock, what mine is defective in.—Let him call forth every <hi>tender Idea.</hi> Let him think on the <hi>Affection</hi> of a <hi>Parent;</hi> on the <hi>Love</hi> of a <hi>Child,</hi> and, if he can, let him conceive the mighty Joy at recovering our <hi>long loſt darling Hopes.</hi> Let him do this, and it is poſſible he may have ſome <hi>faint Idea</hi> of what this poor Woman felt. But to paint convulſive Motions, to mark the alternate Complexion, and to ſet down every drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping paſſionate Word, is not in the Power of Mr. <hi>Le Sage, Crebillon, Fielding,</hi> or even a <hi>Ch—t—f—d.</hi>—When the <hi>good-natur'd</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der has finiſh'd his private Reflections, I beg he will go one Step farther, and bring back the <hi>Mother</hi> and <hi>Son</hi> to their wonted Senſe and Underſtanding.</p>

God has been bountiful to you, and moſt merciful to me! — I have not merited his Goodneſs, but ſhall endeavour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his Favour.—I hope I ſhall.—But, my <hi>dear Jack,</hi> give me ſome Account of yourſelf. Tell me of all your Accidents; how you arriv'd to the honourable Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I ſee you in, and why your Name is <hi>Conyers.</hi>—Tell me all, my dear Child, and I ſhall moſt faithfully recount, tho' I bluſh for it, every Part of my Life ſince we parted.— Oh, my Son! Could you have known the Trouble, my Uſage to you has given me, you would pity an unhappy Woman.—But, tell me, my dear <hi>Jack,</hi> can you forgive me?—I fear it is impoſſible.'—'My Conduct, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> ſhall convince my <hi>deareſt Mother,</hi> that I have forgot all Things, but my <hi>Duty</hi> and my <hi>Love.'</hi>—Then, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> I am happy, and my <hi>Love</hi> ſhall reward you.—But no more now. — You muſt change your Quarters, and live with me.—Does Mr. <hi>Waters</hi> know you are my Son?'—'No, Madam, <hi>ſaid the Captain,</hi> he knows no more than what I deſir'd him to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0558800102:189"/>
in his Letter.' — 'That's well, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> neither is it neceſſary he ſhould. I muſt not own you for my Son, as it would contradict what I have always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, but you muſt be my Nephew, the Son of my Siſter, which will ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently warrant my Affection for you.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THIS Matter being ſettled, they went together to Mr. <hi>Fitzgerald</hi>'s. The Family were greatly ſurpris'd and pleas'd when Mrs. <hi>Magragh</hi> preſented her Nephew. She told them the Method he took to diſcover himſelf, and all Compliments were made ſuitable to the Occaſion. That Night he return'd to her Houſe, and the whole Town viſited and congratulated them.</p>

               <p>NO doubt Mrs. <hi>Magragh</hi> was impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to hear the Story of her Son, and begg'd he would begin, and not omit the minuteſt Circumſtances. He obey'd, and carried her through every Scene of his Life, except a few Parts not ſo fit for her to hear, and concluded, by his being a Captain of Dragoons; the Accident that brought him to the Knowledge of her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alive, and how ſoon he determin'd to pay his Duty.—He did not mention his being on <hi>Half-Pay,</hi> leſt ſhe ſhould have inſiſted on his ſtaying at <hi>Cadiz,</hi> which he by no Means intended to do.—He recited all his Adventures in a full and clear Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and ſo pathetically worded his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0558800102:191"/>
that ſhe wept moſt bitterly, but, his good Fortune ſucceeding, a viſible Joy ſpread over her Countenance. — She em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced him a thouſand Times, and bleſt God for reſtoring to her a Son, and a Son of ſuch <hi>Prudence</hi> and ſo many <hi>Virtues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> my dear <hi>Jack,</hi> it is but juſt to recount my own Hiſtory, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you of ſome Things that you are a Stranger to.</p>
               <p>SHE then began from her being a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant at Sir <hi>Roger Thornton</hi>'s. — <q>In this Family, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> I lived very happily. I was <hi>young,</hi> and tolerably <hi>handſome,</hi> and it pleaſed <hi>Sir Roger</hi> to think me more ſo than perhaps I really was. He made me Preſents, ſeem'd very fond of me, was a mighty fine comely Gentleman; and, in ſhort, overcome my fooliſh Weakneſs. I proved with Child, and he married me to <hi>Jerry Connor.</hi> You came into the World with that Name, but my dear <hi>Jack,</hi> your real Father was <hi>Sir Roger Thornton.'</hi>— 'More Wonders! <hi>cry'd her Son,</hi> — Is it poſſible! — She ſeem'd ſurpriſed at his Exclamations, but he inform'd her of his Intimacy with Captain <hi>Thornton,</hi> and of the Accident that brought on their great Friendſhip. She was vaſtly delighted with this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0558800102:192"/>
and charm'd to find <hi>Sir Roger</hi> was ſtill alive.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THIS obliged her to begin a little more particularly, and ſhe continued her Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to the Death of <hi>Jerry Connor,</hi> and the Parting with her Son.—As I have pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced all theſe Facts in the firſt Pages of this Hiſtory, where I imagin'd they naturally came in, I muſt refer my Reader to them, and take up her Story where I dropt it.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>THUS, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> Father <hi>Kelly</hi> and I co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited in a ſcandalous Manner; and the Proofs againſt us were ſo ſtrong and ſo many, that he could not live in the Country. His Uncle the <hi>Biſhop</hi> gave him a good Sum of Money, and a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to a <hi>Prior</hi> of a rich <hi>Convent</hi> in this City. He perſuaded me to go with him, (and I had no Buſineſs to ſtay behind) but he would by no Means conſent to my taking you. I was in the utmoſt Trouble, and could not think of parting with my Child for ever. At laſt he propoſed ſending you to his Brother's in the County of <hi>Galway,</hi> who would take care of your Education, and, at a certain Age, ſend you to <hi>Cadiz.</hi>—The barbarous Wretch laid the Scheme, and expoſed you to periſh on the Road. He was ſo
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0558800102:193"/>
cruel, that he never would give me the leaſt Satisfaction, or let me know what he had done with you. I was too much depending on him to quarrel, and had no other Conſolation but my frequent Tears.</p>
                  <p>WE embark'd at <hi>Cork</hi> in a Ship load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Beef, Tallow,</hi> and <hi>Worſted Stuffs,</hi> and arrived ſafe at this Place. It was agreed I ſhould paſs for his <hi>Siſter,</hi> and the Widow of one Mr. <hi>Connor</hi> of <hi>Clonmell.</hi> He went to the Convent, and deliver'd his Letter to Father <hi>Purcell</hi> the <hi>Prior,</hi> where I believe he was well received, for he return'd vaſtly pleaſed. He was ſoon in the Habit of his <hi>Order,</hi> and provided me a Lodging in a good Family, and made me dreſs in a very decent Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                  <p>I KNOW not how he managed with the <hi>Prior,</hi> but he gave me to underſtand, that I muſt call him my <hi>Uncle,</hi> and be extremely civil when he viſited me, and next Day I had that Honour. Father <hi>Purcell,</hi> or rather my <hi>Uncle,</hi> was a comely, grave Man, of about <hi>Sixty,</hi> vaſtly polite, and courteous, and, ſeemingly, of a moſt <hi>religious</hi> Deportment. However, my pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Brother</hi> ſoon hinted, that I was to be more than <hi>merely civil</hi> to him, if I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0558800102:194"/>
to be maintain'd.—What could I do?—I was compelled to forfeit my <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> that I might ſave my <hi>Reputation.</hi> In ſhort, I comply'd, and my <hi>Brother</hi> and <hi>Uncle</hi> conſtantly viſited me, and were <hi>mighty tender</hi> and <hi>affectionate Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>YOU ſee, my deareſt <hi>Jack,</hi> I hide not from you, even my own Shame.—How are the beſt Inſtitutions perverted! but let us not condemn the <hi>Whole</hi> for the Wickedneſs of a <hi>Few.</hi>—Thus I lived for about four or five Months, and was viſited by the beſt Families, and paid them in Return. I own I was not a fit Companion for People of Fortune; but as I could not converſe in their Manner, I behaved with great <hi>Modeſty</hi> and <hi>Silence.</hi> This procured me a general good Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and made me paſs for what I did not merit.</p>
                  <p>I HAD a Mind to try the Temper of Father <hi>Purcell,</hi> and one Day very gravely hinted an Apprehenſion of my being with Child. The <hi>old Man</hi> ſtared, and was in a ſtrange <hi>Dilemma,</hi> for he had no Notion but Father <hi>Kelly</hi> was my real <hi>Brother.</hi>—He walk'd about the Room in a very penſive Manner, but at laſt — Well, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> if my dear Widow be with Child, I muſt find a Father for it.
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0558800102:195"/>
—Shall I get you a Huſband? — 'I have no Objection, <hi>ſaid I,</hi> provided he be a good one.'—"Leave it to me, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd the Prior;</hi> but it muſt be done in a Hurry, and ſhall inſtantly ſet about it; ſo put on your beſt Airs for a Viſit To-morrow Evening." — 'I took his Advice, but could not forbear laughing at the Oddity of my Scheme, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd where it would end.</p>
                  <p>FATHER PURCELL kept his Word, and introduced Mr. <hi>Magragh.</hi> He ſeem'd a plain good Sort of a Man, of about Fifty-five. He was very ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious and complaiſant, but ſpoke little. In Half an Hour the <hi>Prior</hi> open'd a more intereſting Converſation.— "My dear Niece, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> my good Friend Mr. <hi>Magragh</hi> has often ſeen you, and has communicated his Sentiments to me. No Doubt you are of Age to chuſe for yourſelf; but as I know his Integrity and Worth, I think it my Duty, as a Parent, to adviſe you to receive his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Addreſſes as you ought. — It will be much better than returning to <hi>Ireland."</hi> — 'I bluſh'd, and only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, That I ſhould always be guided by him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="193" facs="tcp:0558800102:196"/>"MADAM, <hi>ſaid Mr. Magragh,</hi> I am a Man in Trade, of a good Character, and an eaſy Fortune. His <hi>Reverence</hi> has told you my Heart, which, if you will be pleaſed to accept, you ſhall command every Thing in my Power." Sir, <hi>ſaid I,</hi> I doubt not your Merit, and as my Uncle is your Friend, I am ſure he means an Happineſs to us both, and ſhall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit myſelf to his Determination.— This, <hi>ſaid the Prior,</hi> is making <hi>Love</hi> like People of Senſe, and not like giddy Children. Come, my <hi>dear Niece,</hi> ſince you leave it to me, give me your Hand. —Here, my good Friend, I beſtow you that ineſtimable Treaſure, a <hi>good Wife.</hi>—Take her, and <hi>I pray God</hi> to bleſs you both."—Mr. <hi>Magragh</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced me very tenderly, and I behaved as I ought.</p>
                  <p>"WELL, Madam, <hi>ſaid the poor Man,</hi> when ſhall I be happy?—When ſhall I call you my own?—Lord, Sir, <hi>ſaid I,</hi> you are ſo preſſing.—I believe a Month or two will be Time enough.—"A Month, <hi>cry'd the Prior;</hi> nay, now you ſpoil all. I hop'd you would have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd To-morrow."—"And I, <hi>ſaid Mr. Magragh,</hi> was thinking on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Minute; for my Maxim is, <hi>Never
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0558800102:197"/>
to put off till To-morrow, what I can do To-day,"</hi>—"'Tis a moſt excellent Rule, <hi>reply'd the Prior,</hi> and let us put it in Practice. What ſay you, my dear Neice?—Shall I perform the <hi>Holy Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice?"</hi>—I bluſh'd, but made no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.—"Silence, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> is a Conſent, therefore let us go to Mr. <hi>Magragh</hi>'s, ſend for a few Friends, and finiſh the Buſineſs."—"His Reverence, <hi>ſaid my Lover,</hi> has been always my Friend."— With ſome Intreaties, I ſuffer'd myſelf to be conducted to his Houſe, where, in the Preſence of my <hi>Brother</hi> and two more, my good <hi>Uncle</hi> perform'd his <hi>Prieſtly Duty,</hi> and made me Miſtreſs of this Habitation.</p>
                  <p>MR. MAGRAGH was really a good-natur'd inoffenſive Man, and very af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately lov'd me. I kept very good Company, I read a good deal, and wrote, and aſſiſted him very much in his Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. By Degrees I grew very expert, and began to <hi>think</hi> and <hi>talk</hi> in a quite different Manner.—My poor Huſband was extremely delighted with my Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and Capacity, and only wanted a <hi>Child</hi> to compleat his Happineſs; but none came, notwithſtanding the <hi>frequent</hi>
                     <pb n="195" facs="tcp:0558800102:198"/>
and <hi>fervent Prayers</hi> of the <hi>holy Prior</hi> and my <hi>pious Brother.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THUS I liv'd for about five Years, with great ſeeming Happineſs; but your Image, and Father <hi>Kelly</hi>'s Perſon, were <hi>too often</hi> preſent to make me really ſo. I dreaded his more than <hi>Brotherly Love;</hi> for he ſometimes viſited at very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Seaſons. I knew his Temper, and, as he began to be ſuſpected on many Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, particularly for ſome Intrigues with <hi>Spaniſh Ladies,</hi> I was in continual Apprehenſions of ſome fatal Accident. Nay, I much fear'd the Jealouſy of the <hi>Prior,</hi> for he gave me ſome Hints. At laſt I miſs'd the Viſits of my <hi>Brother,</hi> and enquir'd after him from my <hi>Uncle.</hi> He ſhook his Head, but no ſatisfactory Anſwer came. I cry'd for my <hi>Brother,</hi> but I never ſaw him ſince.— He was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>murder'd,</hi> or carry'd to the <hi>Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and I violently ſuſpected the <hi>Prior.</hi> —I was really ſorry for his Misfortune, but not diſpleas'd at the Loſs of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. I was much more ſatisfy'd, when, in three Months after, my holy Uncle, Father <hi>Purcell,</hi> departed this Life, and left me to enjoy it with <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>real Happineſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="196" facs="tcp:0558800102:199"/>THESE Impediments to the Tranquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of my Mind being remov'd, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd myſelf more cloſely to the Study of every Thing that might give my Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band Pleaſure. I ſtill improved, and arrived to ſuch Perfection, that he confided all to my Care and Management; and I aver to you, my deareſt <hi>Jack,</hi> that I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deceived him in <hi>any Shape,</hi> after the Death of the <hi>Prior.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>HIS Fortune increas'd very largely, and we liv'd with great <hi>Harmony</hi> and <hi>Content.</hi> The laſt two Years, his Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities made him extremely peeviſh; but I bore all with Patience, and aſſiſted and attended him with the Tenderneſs and Duty of a <hi>good Wife.</hi> The Poor Man was ſenſible of my Regard, and, when he died, I found his Will had made me abſolute Miſtreſs of his whole Fortune.</p>
                  <p>I HAVE reſiſted many Sollicitations from People who call'd themſelves <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</hi> I knew the World too well, to imagine a Woman of my Years had all the Charms they pretended to find in me. I fancy I gueſs'd right, that my <hi>thirty thouſand Pounds</hi> was my principal Beauty.—Now, my dear <hi>Jack,</hi> forget the Injury I did you, and forget my
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0558800102:200"/>
Faults, which I have moſt ſincerely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of, and you ſhall be my <hi>Huſband,</hi> nor will I ever have another.—Tho' we are, unhappily, of different <hi>Religions,</hi> yet, believe me, I am not ſo bigotted to mine, as to deſire a Change in your's. I have learnt by Experience, that the true <hi>End</hi> and <hi>Uſe</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> is to make us <hi>good, virtuous,</hi> and <hi>charitable.</hi>—Since your <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> has taught you the Practice of thoſe <hi>great Duties,</hi> Why ſhould I wiſh you to alter? No, my dear <hi>Jack,</hi> keep ſtrictly to, and be faithful in it.—My Religion did not make me wicked; it was my <hi>Weakneſs</hi> and my Ignorance. Thank <hi>God,</hi> I am now wiſer. I find, my dear Child, that your Duty will ſoon call you from me; but to convince you of the Sincerity of my Love, half my For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune is this Moment your's. When all my Affairs are ſettled, I will follow you to <hi>England,</hi> and you ſhall command the Remainder, allowing me four hundred Pounds a Year during my Life; which will be more than I ſhall have Occaſion for. I hope my deareſt <hi>Jack</hi> is now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd, that I make every Satisfaction in my Power, and that I at laſt prove my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a tender and affectionate Mother.</p>

                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:0558800102:201"/>THE <hi>Captain</hi> moſt ardently embrac'd her, and return'd every Acknowledgement that ſo much Goodneſs deſerv'd. She ſet about her Promiſe immediately, and, in a ſhort Time, gave him Bills on <hi>London</hi> for <hi>fifteen thouſand Pounds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WHILST theſe Matters were tranſacting, he received a Letter from his Friend <hi>Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> declaring his Unhappineſs without him, and preſſing his Return. He like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe received Letters from Colonel <hi>Manly,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Grace.</hi> Theſe gave him great Concern, for they inform'd him of the Death of his old Maſter, good Mr. <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> He had requeſted his Wife to ſettle the Fortune on Captain <hi>Conyers,</hi> at her Death, and ſhe had moſt generouſly exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the proper Deeds, reſerving <hi>two thouſand</hi> Pounds to diſpoſe of as ſhe thought proper.</p>
               <p>HE acquainted his Mother with theſe Matters, and how neceſſary his Preſence was, to take Care of his <hi>Eſtate,</hi> and his Military Poſt. She confeſs'd the Reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of his Deſires, and promiſing to part with him, with as little Regret as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, he prepared to ſet out, the firſt Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, by Sea, to <hi>Marſeilles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SHE gave him many uſeful Inſtructions, and advis'd him to Secrecy with Regard to
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0558800102:202"/>
his Family, and the Obſurity of his Birth. —<q>Tho', <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> you are in Fact more Praiſe-worthy, by having made your For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune with a fair Character, than had it deſcended from your Father; yet the World is made of ſuch <hi>envious Stuff,</hi> they take Pleaſure in leſſening the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of others; yet it is certain <hi>he riſes the Higher with the ſenſible Part of the World, the Lower he ſprung from.</hi>

                  <q>YOUR Fortune, my dear Son, <hi>continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe,</hi> will be now very conſiderable, but let me beg of you to believe, that <hi>no Fortune</hi> can ſtand long againſt <hi>bad Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement.</hi> Be an <hi>Oeconomiſt,</hi> and put your Affairs in ſo regular a Channel, that, in an Inſtant, you may know your <hi>Income</hi> and your <hi>Expences.</hi> Without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity, all will be in Confuſion. Let your <hi>Accounts</hi> and your <hi>Watch</hi> be wound up punctually to a Time, or both will go wrong.—Avoid a Number of idle and ſuperfluous <hi>Servants,</hi> that <hi>eat</hi> out an Eſtate; keep from expenſive <hi>Schemes</hi> and Projects; and trouble, or rather pleaſe, the <hi>Lawyers</hi> as little as poſſible.—Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine to be <hi>happy,</hi> for you know the Means.—One Word more, and I have done.—I gueſs at your Conſtitution by your Complexion, therefore I adviſe you

to <hi>marry,</hi> but ſubmit the Manner to your own Prudence.</q>

               <p>HE was often aſtoniſh'd how ſhe came to <hi>reaſon, ſpeak</hi> and <hi>write</hi> ſo correctly, and could not avoid aſking her the Queſtion. —<q>It is not, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> ſo difficult a Matter as you imagine, though we muſt have ſome Aſſiſtance from Nature.—I very ſeverely felt the Want of theſe Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments, and reſolv'd, if poſſible, to acquire them.—I told you I read much.

I improv'd conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably by the Help of Company, but my own <hi>Project</hi> vaſtly ſhorten'd my Labour.

He wrote to all his Friends, and promis'd to join them as ſoon as poſſible.</p>
               <p>A GOOD Ship being now ready to ſail, he paid his Reſpects to all his Acquaintances at <hi>Cadiz,</hi> and made ſome genteel Preſents, particularly to the Family of Mr. <hi>Fitzge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald.</hi>—All were concern'd at loſing ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite a Companion, and he was loaded with Praiſes and Careſſes. His Mother could not bear it with that Reſignation ſhe at firſt thought; but however, ſhe rais'd her Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and, with many Bleſſings, ſaw him ſet Sail.</p>
               <p>THE Voyage was proſperous, and he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at <hi>Marſeilles</hi> ſafe, and in good Health. He took Poſt for <hi>Paris,</hi> and once more embrac'd his dear Friend Capt. <hi>Thornton,</hi> after an Abſence of eight Months.</p>

                  <hi>Maſter Harry.</hi>—His Heart felt an unuſual Pleaſure; <hi>Joy</hi> ſparkled in his Eyes, and added ſuch Charms to his Converſation, that his Friend proteſted, he believ'd the Gravity of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had only ſerved to give him more Spirits.—<q>Perhaps, <hi>ſaid my Lord,</hi> they were ſo confin'd, when there, that now they ruſh out with greater Force; but be it as it will, I am vaſtly pleas'd to find <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>good Senſe</hi> ſo agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably blended.</q>—<hi>Conyers</hi> made the proper Reply, but retir'd pretty ſoon, for he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Repoſe.</p>
               <p>NEXT Day they viſited their Friends, and a Week was very chearfully employ'd. In this Time, Mr. <hi>Conyers</hi> receiv'd a Letter from his Correſpondent in <hi>London,</hi> 
                  <q>That he had credited him with the Money re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted from <hi>Cadiz;</hi> That he had paid three Bills drawn on him by Mr. <hi>Penſé,</hi> of <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> amounting to <hi>Seventy-five Pounds,</hi> and that his Correſpondent of that City had advis'd him of the Death of the ſaid Mr. <hi>Penſé.</hi>
                  </q>—Captain <hi>Conyers</hi> was much concern'd for the poor Man, but his ſuperior Joy ſoon got the better. He did not think on his Death, as ſo much gained, but determined to employ <hi>Penſé</hi>'s Money to other Purpoſes than his own.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:0558800102:208"/>LORD TRUEGOOD had all the Softneſs and Delicacy of Behaviour; that Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Mankind; that Eaſe, and, at the ſame Time, that <hi>Dignity</hi> in his Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that diſtinguiſhes, or ought to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh the <hi>Nobleman.</hi> He was Generous without Profuſeneſs, Mild without Childiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Courteous to all; but ſupported his Station.

               <p>IT is not to be expreſſed, the hearty and affectionate Manner <hi>Sir Roger Thornton</hi> and <hi>Lord Mountworth</hi> received Captain <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers,</hi> neither is it poſſible to deſcribe the Joys He felt, when he embraced the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of his Life,</hi> and the <hi>Founder of his Happineſs.</hi> Each inſiſted on his living with them, and contended ſtrongly about it, but Captain <hi>Conyers</hi> ended the kind Diſpute by aſſuring them, he had many Reaſons for being in private Lodgings, but hoped they would indulge him the Honour of viſiting with Freedom.—He was preſented to each Family, who could not enough ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the many excellent Qualifications they ſoon found he poſſeſſed. His generous Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour was the Subject of each Day, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0558800102:210"/>
with the Ladies.—<hi>It is juſt</hi> They <hi>ſhould peculiarly admire the</hi> Brave, <hi>when</hi> They only <hi>are capable of rewarding them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>LADY MOUNTWORTH ſtill preſerved a large Reſidue of Beauty. The accuſtom'd Sweetneſs of her Temper, and her good Senſe, remained; but all her Charms ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed tranſplanted, and to blow a-freſh in her Daughter, <hi>Lady Harriot.</hi> She was now about Twenty-four Years of Age; her Beauty was exquiſite, and none could be inſenſible of it; but the <hi>Rectitude</hi> of her Manners, the <hi>Integrity</hi> of her Soul, and the <hi>Affability</hi> of her Behaviour, could not fail of Numbers of Admirers. Perhaps ſhe was too delicate in the Choice of a Huſband, and required more Perfections in a Man, than a <hi>large Fortune</hi> and <hi>high Titles.</hi> She was ſo whimſical and ſingular in her No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that ſhe thought a <hi>rational, tender,</hi> and <hi>faithful Companion,</hi> was infinitely more eſſential to a Scheme of Happineſs, than a Multitude of Servants, and the moſt bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Retinue.—My <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Lady</hi> often raillied this Temper; but as they knew her Underſtanding and Judgment, they always left her Free.</p>
               <p>CAPTAIN <hi>Conyers</hi> admired her Virtues. He was charmed at the <hi>eaſy Elegance</hi> of her Converſation. He gazed on her Beauties,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0558800102:211"/>
and his <hi>Heart</hi> inſenſibly ſtole from him, and became her Property.—Certain it is, <hi>Lady Harriot</hi> began to have Sentiments much in his Favour, and ſome delicate Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and the Conduct of the Eyes, ſoon diſcovered what paſſed in their Souls.</p>
               <p>THO' <hi>Lady Harriot</hi> poſſeſſed his Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, yet his private Affairs were attended to. Lord <hi>Mountworth</hi> was an excellent Adviſer in Money Affairs, as well as other Matters. He therefore begged his <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi>'s Aſſiſtance in the Management of <hi>Twenty Thouſand Pounds,</hi> which brought on a Converſation that diſcovered the <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances</hi> of the <hi>Captain.</hi>—His Money was ſoon diſpoſed of in the Funds, and he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to ſet out for his Eſtate. Whilſt this was doing, he remembered his Promiſe to himſelf, and ſent <hi>Five hundred Pounds</hi> of Mr. <hi>Penſé</hi>'s to the <hi>Correſpondent Society in</hi> London, <hi>for promoting</hi> Engliſh <hi>Proteſtant Schools in</hi> Ireland, but his Name was not mentioned.</p>
               <p>HE likewiſe remembered his old Friend Mr. <hi>Sangfroid</hi> the Surgeon, and after much Enquiry, found him in very <hi>obſcure Lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings.</hi> The <hi>Captain</hi> was dreſſed in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimentals, and <hi>Sangfroid</hi> received him with very great Reſpect.—<q>Sir, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> I am ſorry for your Accident. A <hi>ſlight Touch,</hi>
                     <pb n="209" facs="tcp:0558800102:212"/>
I preſume, but my Care and Diligence, will ſoon make Matters eaſy to you, and you may depend on being quite ſafe in my Hands.</q>—He was going on in the uſual Stile; but the <hi>Captain</hi> with an hearty laugh, cry'd out, <q>Bleſs me, Mr. <hi>Sang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>froid!</hi>—Have you really forgot me?</q>— <hi>Sangfroid</hi> looked up, and ſtaring at him for ſome Time, cry'd,—Forget you!— —<q>Eh!—Oons! I believe 'tis honeſt <hi>Conyers</hi>—Oh God! — Come to my Arms my dear Friend, <hi>ſaid the Captain,</hi> and uſe me as ſuch.</q>—They embraced, and the Surgeon was quite confounded at his Appearance, and teſtify'd his Surprize. —<q>We ſhall, <hi>ſaid Conyers,</hi> have Time enough to talk of that, but at preſent let us think on your Affairs, for you do not ſeem ſo happy as I could wiſh. You have been my kind Benefactor, now try my Gratitude, and honeſtly tell me your Wants, for I fear you have ſome.</q>
               </p>
               <p>POOR <hi>Sangfroid</hi> began a moſt melancholy Story. He told the Variety of Misfortunes he had met with;—he placed them all to the Account of his Folly and Extravagance, and concluded by his being in a poor, wretched Condition.—His Story was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely moving, but it convinced the <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> of the <hi>Miſery</hi> That Man draws on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0558800102:213"/>
who chuſes to be directed by <hi>Paſſions</hi> and <hi>Appetites,</hi> rather than <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Oeconomy.</hi>—However, he was determined to ſerve him, and put <hi>Forty Guineas</hi> into his Hands.—<q>Now, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> this is only for the preſent; when you find a <hi>Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oncy</hi> to be bought, command my Purſe moſt freely.'—'Heavens! <hi>ſaid Sangfroid,</hi> how ill they argue, that call this a <hi>bad World!</hi>—You are in it!—Ten ſuch Men, attone for the Faults of Millions! —My dear Friend, <hi>continued he, with Tears in his Eyes,</hi> I believe ſome Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would advance Two Hundred Pounds, if I had the Remainder I could this Moment purchaſe a Surgeoncy to a Regiment of Guards.—But 'tis impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to expect ſo much Goodneſs.'— Expect, <hi>ſaid Conyers</hi> every Thing from me. Go about it, my Friend, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, and in three Days I ſhall call and finiſh the Affair.</q>—The Captain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed his Promiſe, and with the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of £ 600 Mr. <hi>Sangfroid</hi> was made completely happy.</p>
               <p>HIS next Enquiry was for <hi>Doctor St. Amour;</hi> but he had been lately made a <hi>Biſhop</hi> in <hi>Ireland.</hi> He viſited his good Widow Landlady in <hi>Surry,</hi> whom he made vaſtly happy, by a Preſent of Fifty Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0558800102:214"/>
and an Annuity of Ten Pounds a Year.—He found out that his old Maſter <hi>Monſieur Champignon</hi> had been ſometime dead; and that <hi>Miſs Tonton</hi> having the Guardianſhip of her own Perſon, had wiſely diſpoſed of it to a <hi>Life-Guard</hi> Man.—SIR PETER SHALLOW was ſtill alive, and of the ſame <hi>weak Importance.</hi>—SIR JOHN CU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIOUS was at Reſt, but his Lady was very buſy with a ſecond Huſband, whom ſhe married in her Weeds.—Poor Mrs. CAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NON had failed in ſome of her Annuities, and was obliged to retire to <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> for Cheapneſs.—The BISHOP had long ſince been tranſlated, and his <hi>Works</hi> followed him.—As to many others, whom he knew, he judged it not proper to renew his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, or even inquire after. In a Word, he diſcharged all thoſe <hi>Duties,</hi> that <hi>good Men</hi> recommend, and what <hi>few</hi> prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</p>
               <p>CAPTAIN <hi>Thornton</hi> had been ſo long ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from his Regiment, that he was oblig'd to take Leave of his Friends, and join his Poſt in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and his Father Sir <hi>Roger</hi> had been ſome Time in <hi>Berkſhire</hi> on Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. This encreaſed the Intimacy of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Conyers</hi> with Lord <hi>Mountworth</hi>'s Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, particularly with Lord <hi>Truegood.</hi>— He found out, by Degrees, the Situation
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0558800102:215"/>
of Affairs, and that the young <hi>Lord</hi>'s Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Maſter William</hi> had taken a Fancy to the <hi>Sea Service,</hi> and had diſtinguiſhed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on many late Occaſions as a Captain of a <hi>Man of War,</hi> and was then at his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>WHATEVER good Opinion the Family conceived of Capt. <hi>Conyers,</hi> an Affair hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that did not leſſen it. It ſeems Mr. <hi>Sangfroid</hi> had been at the Captain's Lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings, and was informed of his being at Lord <hi>Mountworth</hi>'s. He followed, and tho' the Captain was not there, yet the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant conducted him into the Chamber where ſat my <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Lady</hi> with <hi>Lady Harriot.</hi> My <hi>Lord,</hi> with his uſual Polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ordered a Chair, and told him he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the Captain every Moment. A little Chat aroſe, which, at laſt, fell on his Friend. —<hi>Sangfroid</hi> was ſilent as to former Times, but mentioned his having been in good Circumſtances, and had rendered ſome Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to Mr. <hi>Conyers.</hi> He then painted out the laſt Action of his Friend, and his real Worth and Honour in ſuch lively Colours, that drew from my <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Lady,</hi> the higheſt <hi>Encomiums</hi> on the Captain. <hi>Lady Harriot</hi> was ſilent, but Pleaſure bluſhed in her Face. — <hi>Sangfroid</hi> waited for ſome Time, but at laſt took his Leave.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:0558800102:216"/>LADY HARRIOT now opened on the Charms of <hi>Gratitude</hi> and true <hi>Generoſity.</hi>— <q>Theſe, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> are the <hi>maſterly Touches</hi> of a <hi>finiſh'd Piece,</hi> and no Character can be compleat without them.—They argue every <hi>humane</hi> Sentiment, and are an <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract of all Virtues.'</hi>—'Your Servant, Lady <hi>Harriot, ſaid my Lord,</hi> and bowed, —I proteſt you would make an excellent Painter. But tell me, my deareſt <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot,</hi> Which would you chuſe to trace, the <hi>Perſon,</hi> or the <hi>Mind</hi> of the Captain?</q> —She bluſhed, but anſwered—<q>You know, <hi>my Lord,</hi> I always ſpeak Truth, and can ill diſguiſe my Heart.—I hope I ſhall not be thought Criminal, when I aſſure your Lordſhip, I would chuſe both his <hi>Perſon</hi> and his <hi>Mind.'</hi>—'And if I can, <hi>ſaid my Lord,</hi> you ſhall have your Choice.'—He then moſt tenderly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced her, and <hi>Lady Mountworth</hi> almoſt wept with Joy.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THE <hi>Captain</hi> was much preſſed to return to the Country, particularly by Colonel <hi>Manly,</hi> who mentioned ſomething of the Borough. It happened that the <hi>Colonel</hi> and <hi>Lord Mountworth</hi> were intimate Friends, ſo was eaſily perſuaded to let his Son <hi>Lord Truegood</hi> accompany the Captain, but not before he had acquainted him with the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0558800102:217"/>
Sentiments of his Siſter, and his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations to ſuch a Match. The poor <hi>Captain</hi> ſcarcely knew how to bid <hi>Adieu</hi> to his dear Lady <hi>Harriot;</hi> but as he had given ſome Hints to Lord <hi>Truegood,</hi> his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip eaſed him in ſo delicate an Affair.— <q>
                     <hi>Lady Harriot, ſaid he,</hi> I muſt beg your Hand to help me to raiſe my Friends for he is <hi>your's</hi> and you <hi>his.</hi>
                  </q>—She ſaluted the Captain, and each attempted to anſwer the other.—<q>Theſe are broken Words, <hi>ſaid my Lord,</hi> but we ſhall piece them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether on our Return.—One Kiſs more. —Now adieu.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THEY went to my <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Lady,</hi> who, as ſoon as acquainted with this Affair, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced Mr. <hi>Conyers,</hi> and looked on him as a Son.—<q>Your Lordſhip, <hi>ſaid the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> is no Stranger to my Fortune, but this Paper contains an Abſtract of it, and I moſt chearfully ſubmit myſelf to your Lordſhip's Determination.</q>—A few Compliments enſued, and <hi>Lord Truegood,</hi> with Capt. <hi>Conyers,</hi> ſtepped into their poſt Chaiſe, and ſoon arrived to the End of their Journey.</p>

               <p>NEVER was Man received with more Affection, particularly by his <hi>Siſter, the Colonel,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Grace.</hi>— It was a Jubilee in the Village.—The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of paſt, and the Enjoyment of preſent Happineſs, occaſioned many Tears. —He paid every Duty to Mrs. <hi>Sampſon,</hi> and ſhe regarded him as her <hi>Brother</hi> and her <hi>Son.</hi> He recited every Circumſtance ſince they parted, and did not forget his Aunt <hi>Magragh</hi> at <hi>Cadiz,</hi> and propoſed her living with her when ſhe arrived in <hi>England.</hi>— Mrs <hi>Sampſon</hi> was extremely pleaſed in his good Fortune; but, as ſhe imagined the <hi>Colonel</hi> wiſhed an Alliance with him, ſhe hinted, that, perhaps, there was more in
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0558800102:219"/>
Store.—<q>Indeed, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> I think you ought to marry; nor do I know a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the World I would ſooner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to you than Miſs <hi>Manly.</hi>— She is grown a Delightful Creature, and is ſo good, I am ſure ſhe would make an excellent Wife. You know the Colonel has Fifteen hundred Pounds a Year, and a great Deal of ready Money. If you will ſet about it, I'il engage it ſhall be done.'—'My dear Siſter, replyed <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers,</hi> I know not how to thank you as I ought; but this Affair is impoſſible.— I am no Stranger to Miſs <hi>Manly</hi>'s Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Merit; but we are not always Maſters of our Inclinations.</q>—He then told her the Hiſtory of his Heart, and ſpoke ſo tenderly on the Charms of <hi>Lady Harriot,</hi> that ſhe entirely agreed with him.</p>
               <p>COLONEL MANLY was ſtill hearty, and tolerably well. He was vaſtly pleaſed at the Figure and Behaviour of <hi>Lord True<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>good.</hi> He ſpoke with great Pleaſure of his <hi>Grandfather</hi> and the preſent <hi>Earl,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him with the utmoſt Affection and Regard. They frequently dined with the <hi>Colonel,</hi> and <hi>Miſs</hi> did the Honours of the Table in ſo polite and well-bred a Manner, that charm'd all, but particularly <hi>Lord
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0558800102:220"/>
Truegood.</hi> He was ſtruck with her Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but the Elegance of her Converſation, firmly fixed every tender Thought.—<hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers</hi> perceived his Lordſhip's Anxiety, and gueſſing the Cauſe, hinted his Suſpicion.— <q>True, <hi>ſaid my Lord,</hi> I own my Love, nor am I aſhamed of it. An Object ſo infinitely worthy, muſt engroſs my Heart. Dear <hi>Conyers,</hi> let me require your Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Aſſiſt me with the <hi>Colonel</hi> and his <hi>deareſt</hi> Daughter, as I aſſiſted you with <hi>Harriot.</hi> I am certain of my Father's Conſent, and I ſhall be the happieſt of Men.</q>—The Captain, who was rejoiced at this Incident, aſſured him of his Intereſt, and the next Day, not only obtained the Colonel's Conſent, but artfully found out from <hi>Miſs,</hi> that my Lord was far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſagreeable to her.—<hi>Lord Truegood</hi> was in Raptures, and the Friendſhip of <hi>Conyers</hi> curtailed a long Courtſhip, which of all People, Men of <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Sincerity</hi> are the leaſt capable of doing for themſelves. The Way being now paved, the Affair went ſmoothly on, and only wanted <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Lady Mountworth</hi>'s Approbation.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Captain</hi> reſigned to the <hi>Colonel</hi> the Promiſe of his Intereſt for a Seat in <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and begged him to transfer it where, ſoon, it would be naturally due. When
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0558800102:221"/>
his Family Affairs were ſettled, they all agreed on a Journey to <hi>London;</hi> and, as the <hi>Colonel</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Sampſon</hi> were infirm, they were obliged to make eaſy Stages. His <hi>Lordſhip</hi> daily made freſh Diſcoveries of the Underſtanding and good Nature of Miſs <hi>Manly,</hi> and ſhe found her Pleaſure and Satisfaction ariſe, the more ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with him.—In ſhort, it is not in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to give more real Joy, than what this good Company felt.</p>
               <p>ON their Arrival in <hi>London,</hi> Captain <hi>Conyers</hi> flew to Lady <hi>Harriot,</hi> and <hi>Lord Truegood</hi> to his Father. One diſcovered his Soul more openly, and the other mentioned, what Lord <hi>Mountworth</hi> and my Lady were charmed to hear.</p>
               <p>MATTERS were in this Situation, when HONOUR attacked the Captain with ſuch Force, as almoſt to unhinge his flattering Hopes. This <hi>buſy Companion</hi> ſeemed to hint, <hi>That he ought in Juſtice to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf known to my Lord before the Marriage; that it would heighten his Character, and prevent the Imputation of an Impoſtor.</hi>— He owned the Truth of this, but at the ſame Time, he looked on his Perſon, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments and Fortune, as very far from Counterfeits. His diſcovering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, gave him no Uneaſineſs, but he dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0558800102:222"/>
that his <hi>Love</hi> might be injured by it; and, as he could by no Means think of putting it to the Hazard, he determined ſtill to be ſilent.—I write the Fact, and will neither approve or condemn this Conduct. The Truth is, <hi>he loved,</hi> and thoſe who have felt that Paſſion, perhaps will make Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowances for the Faults it occaſions.</p>
               <p>WHY ſhould I take up the Time of my kind Reader?—He will naturally ſuppoſe, that Viſits were paid and returned;—That a Settlement was agreed on;—That the Lawyers were Fee'd, and all Neceſſaries done, to the finiſhing a Matter of ſuch Conſequence, but without my Help he will not know that <hi>Lady Harriot</hi>'s Fortune was but Ten Thouſand Pounds.</p>
               <p>Two People, if not <hi>Four,</hi> imagined the Lawyers were very ſlow in their Motions, and the Clerks very dilatory in their Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs. A few Guineas enlivened their Pens, and the happy Day, at laſt came. The Biſhop of—joined all their Hands, and eſtabliſhed the <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Affection of their Souls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>LORD MOUNTWWORTH would not too ſoon diſturb the Pleaſure of his <hi>Sons</hi> and <hi>Daughters,</hi> but in ſix Weeks, he began to think of returning to <hi>Ireland,</hi> from whence he had been abſent three Years. As he
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0558800102:223"/>
found Captain <hi>Conyers</hi> and <hi>Lady Harriot</hi> greatly inclined to go, he adviſed him to keep his Money Matters in ſuch a Readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that he might diſpoſe of it the firſt convenient Opportunity.—<q>Whatever, <hi>ſaid my Lord,</hi> ſome may imagine, let me adviſe you to Purchaſe in that <hi>Kingdom,</hi> but in one of thoſe Counties the leaſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. A Man of your Turn of Mind, will ſoon diſcover the many Advantages. You will build convenient Houſes for the poor People, and ſet them a <hi>Spinning.</hi> You will almoſt compel them to <hi>Induſtry</hi> and <hi>Labour.</hi> They will thrive under you, and your Fortune increaſe in Proportion.</q> —His Lordſhip then gave him an Account of his own Management, (as was formerly related) and aſſured him the People were all content, tho' his annual Income was aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented almoſt One Thouſand Pounds.— —<q>If, <hi>continued he,</hi> a Man takes a Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in viewing the <hi>Trees</hi> he planted, in ſeeing them bloſſom, and in taſting their Fruit, what Joy, what a <hi>rational Joy</hi> muſt he receive, who beholds a Colony of <hi>human Creatures,</hi> eſtabliſhed by his <hi>Care,</hi> flouriſhing by his <hi>Bounty,</hi> and <hi>Bleſſing</hi> his Soul, who <hi>bleſſed them?</hi>— Believe me, my dear Son, no <hi>Earthly Happineſs</hi> can equal this.</q>—The <hi>Captain</hi>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:0558800102:224"/>
was too ſenſible of theſe Truths, not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with my Lord.—His Spirit was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and his Imagination plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out his future Conduct.</p>
               <p>COLONEL MANLY grew impatient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn Home, there, <hi>as he ſaid,</hi> to reſt for ever. <hi>Lady Truegood</hi> could not think of quitting her Father, and the young <hi>Lord</hi> could not part from his deareſt Wife, ſo that the old Gentleman was perfectly happy, when they agreed to accompany him. —He took a moſt tender Leave of all his Friends; but, embracing <hi>Conyers</hi> with Tears of the trueſt Affection, call'd him his <hi>Friend,</hi> his <hi>Soldier,</hi>—but could utter no more than, <hi>Heaven bleſs and protect you,</hi> and retir'd with Eyes full of the tender Paſſion, to which <hi>Lady Mountworth</hi> and <hi>Lady Harriot</hi> moſt liberally ſubſcribed.</p>
               <p>THE Captain took a good Houſe and Garden at <hi>Richmond</hi> for Mrs. <hi>Sampſon,</hi> who promiſed to be moſt careful of Mrs. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gragh</hi> when ſhe arrived. He wrote to his Mother of all his Tranſactions, and gave her full Inſtructions. Every Thing being adjuſted, this chearful and happy Family quitted <hi>London,</hi> and ſet out for <hi>Ireland.</hi>

               <p>THE Journey was made leſs tedious by their ſprightly and agreeable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.—His <hi>Lordſhip</hi> often ſpoke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> but in ſuch a Manner, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the <hi>Prejudices</hi> he ſuppoſed Mr. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers</hi> might have to it.—<q>The Face of the Country, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> is certainly charming, and the <hi>Soil,</hi> the <hi>Rivers,</hi> and the <hi>Climate</hi> abundantly ſupply every Neceſſary for Life. It was formerly ſo <hi>Woody,</hi> that the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations of the Earth were confined, and the Air wanted a Currency, conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it was <hi>very fatal to Strangers.</hi> Now indeed, you will find the other Extreme, and a ſhameful Neglect of Trees; but, as they have promiſed, ſo do they mend every Day.—You will be ſurprized at their Herds of <hi>Cattle.</hi> The City of <hi>Cork</hi> alone, ſlaughters for the <hi>Weſt Indies</hi> above <hi>Eighty Thouſand</hi> every Year. No doubt,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0558800102:226"/>
it is a profitable Branch, but ſo much <hi>Paſturage</hi> depopulates a Country, and makes the common People extremely <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>miſerable.</hi> The Inhabitants ſeem now to have a Reliſh and a Taſte for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, and they feel the Sweets of it. In many Things, no People act Wiſer, and in others it is the Reverſe, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in <hi>Corn.</hi> When a Scarcity happens, they all run to the Plow. Next Year, Corn is a Drugg, the <hi>Dutch</hi> buy it at their own Price, and the poor Farmers are undone. The following Year the Plow is neglected, and Corn again riſes to an exorbitant Price, and then the <hi>Dutch</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn them their own.</q>

                  <p>I AM ſurpriſed, <hi>ſaid Conyers,</hi> that their Experience has not convinced them of the Neceſſity of <hi>Granaries.'</hi>—'They much want them, <hi>replyed my Lord,</hi> but it muſt be an Affair of <hi>Government,</hi> for private Perſons would be ruined in their Fortunes or Characters by ſuch a Scheme.' —By what I have heard, <hi>ſaid Conyers,</hi> it is a plentiful Country, and very <hi>Cheap.</hi>' —'True, <hi>anſwered Lady Harriot,</hi> and yet it is made much <hi>Dearer</hi> than in <hi>England.</hi> If Proviſions be a Third Cheaper, and the Faſhion of the Country obliges the Uſe of <hi>double Quantities,</hi> muſt it not be
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0558800102:227"/>
more Expenſive?'—'Well, well, <hi>ſaid Lady Mountworth,</hi> ſuppoſe it dearer, and that they are not ſo rich as in <hi>England,</hi> they live well, they are a generous hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitable People, and have Spirits and Chearfulneſs, not to be purchaſed by mere Wealth. If they have Faults, ſhew me a Nation without them?'—'My Miſtreſs <hi>ſaid my Lord,</hi> is quite an <hi>Iriſh Woman.</hi>'— I believe, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> my Dear means, I am quite unprejudiced; but, granting I was otherwiſe, ought I not to regard that <hi>Kingdom</hi> that maintains us? I wiſh every one did the ſame, and then their <hi>Poverty</hi> and <hi>Folly</hi> would not be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous.</p>
                  <p>WE are told, <hi>ſaid the Captain,</hi> that the <hi>Engliſh Charter Schools</hi> are in a very flouriſhing Condition, and will, in Time, make it a <hi>Proteſtant Kingdom.</hi>'—'Yes, <hi>replyed my Lord,</hi> they are greatly, and very juſtly encouraged, but it will take Time to complete ſo laudable a Work, and Donations are ſtill wanting.—Tho' it is the <hi>King</hi> of all Charities, yet I think my Plan would much ſhorten it.—Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Legiſlator veſted <hi>One Hundred Thouſand Pounds</hi> in the Hands of a few Truſtees of known Integrity and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be applied in purchaſing Lands
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0558800102:228"/>
in ſome particular Counties, and letting thoſe Lands in ſmall Farms to poor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant <hi>Swiſs or Palatines,</hi> naturalized, and to Proteſtant Huſbandmen of our own Kingdoms. Theſe Farms ſhould be <hi>Rent Free</hi> for three Years; pay a ſmall Matter for three Years more, and raiſe it in ſuch a Proportion, as ſhould be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Equitable, till by Degrees the Lands paid the full Value, but not of the Improved Rent. They ſhould have <hi>Fee Farm Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> but not ſuffered to ſell or alienate the Lands in any Shape, for a certain Number of Years, without the Conſent of the Truſtees.—Such a Scheme, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly executed, would certainly, in the firſt Inſtance, be Expenſive to the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> but it would, as certainly, ſoon fill the Country with <hi>Induſtrious</hi> and <hi>Faithful Subjects,</hi> and return to that <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> a Ten-fold Intereſt.</p>
                  <p>AS ENGLAND, <hi>ſaid the Captain,</hi> has purchaſed that <hi>Kingdom</hi> by much Blood and Treaſure, perhaps they are too ſevere in their Conduct towards it. All confeſs the Policy of <hi>France,</hi> and their conſtant Maxim is, to grant more Privileges to their <hi>conquered Provinces</hi> and <hi>Towns,</hi> than they allow the Interior of the Kingdom.' —'On this, <hi>ſaid my Lord,</hi> I ſhall not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0558800102:229"/>
but, take <hi>Ireland</hi> in General, and you will find them tolerably happy. If all the <hi>proper Uſe</hi> be not made of ſo large a Kingdom, <hi>England</hi> will at laſt diſcover her Error, and rectify it. I muſt ſay for the Honour of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that no Nation ever made, in ſo ſhort a Time, ſuch <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Improvements;</hi> and I muſt add, that <hi>England</hi> has been, in many Inſtances, extremely Generous, and <hi>England</hi> begins already to feel and perceive the Utility of it.</p>
                  <p>AS to FRANCE, <hi>continued my Lord,</hi> I am convinced, that her <hi>great Strength</hi> lies not in the vaſt Superiority of her Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. We are told that <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> are to <hi>France,</hi> as 100 to 107. Her chief Power conſiſts in the equal Diſtribution of Benefits to the <hi>Whole,</hi> and in her Scheme for making a <hi>formerly, divided People,</hi> now Think and Act as <hi>one Man.</hi>—Were we ſo True to our <hi>own Intereſt;</hi>—Were we ſo Induſtrious to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to each other a <hi>reciprocal Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;</hi>—Did we manage every Inch of Territory for the Benefit of the <hi>Whole Community,</hi> and not Sacrifice the <hi>Bounties of Nature</hi> to the private Intereſt of a <hi>Few,</hi> GREAT BRITAIN, in Reality, would hold the <hi>Balance of Europe.</hi>—<hi>Lady Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot</hi>
                     <pb n="227" facs="tcp:0558800102:230"/>
ſmiled, and ſaid, I cannot but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the vaſt Pains my Lord takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Ireland,</hi> when, with all his Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, he cannot change the Nature of Things, but muſt leave them, almoſt where he found them: If he could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade the <hi>Rulers of the State</hi> to think like him, then indeed I ſhould have a Chance of ſeeing <hi>Ireland</hi> planted like a Garden.</p>
                  <p>GIVE me Leave to tell you, <hi>replied my Lord,</hi> that I apprehend it the indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Duty of every <hi>faithful Subject,</hi> to throw out ſuch Information and Hints to the <hi>Government,</hi> as he judges of general Uſe. Should he <hi>err</hi> in his Conjectures, perhaps they may give Birth to ſomewhat really Beneficial. In any Caſe, his <hi>good Intentions</hi> will at leaſt deſerve Praiſe.— I am not ſuch a <hi>Wind-Mill</hi> Fighter, as to pretend to <hi>amend the World,</hi> yet I hope <hi>your Ladyſhip</hi> will indulge me an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to amend my little Share of it, and ſhew others a <hi>good Example.</hi>—Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my Notions, this is almoſt as eſſential a Part of my <hi>Duty,</hi> as to <hi>Fear God and Honour the King,</hi> neither can it juſtly be ſaid, I do <hi>one</hi> or the <hi>other</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</p>

                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:0558800102:231"/>SUCH was the general Run of Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—They pleaſed and inſtructed each other.—They ſpoke of <hi>Things</hi> with Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but of <hi>Perſons</hi> with Good-nature.— They had no Conception of the Joys of turning all into <hi>Ridicule;</hi>—of the Pleaſure of <hi>Sarcaſm,</hi> nor of the Delight of finding out <hi>Faults,</hi> and magnifying them.—No.— They had Souls above the vulgar Topic of <hi>Slander.—They loved Mankind, and Mankind loved them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A YATCHT attended for my Lord and Family, and they arrived ſafe in <hi>Dublin</hi> the 16th of <hi>April,</hi> 1750. They ſtayed a ſhort Time in that City, and then ſet out for BOUNTY-HALL. His Lordſhip's Tenants met him on the Road, and their unfeign'd Joy is paſt Deſcription.</p>
               <p>AS ſoon as <hi>Conyers</hi> perceived the venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Seat, wherein he had experienced ſo much Humanity and ſo many Bleſſings, his Heart ſwell'd with <hi>Gratitude.</hi> Every tender Senſation ruſhed ſo violently on him, that he was ſcarce able to ſpeak. <hi>Lady Harriot</hi> obſerved his Countenance changed, and was dreadfully frightened, as were my <hi>Lord and Lady.</hi> With ſome Difficulty he got into the Houſe, and begged to lye down a few Minutes, and all would be well, but no Perſuaſion could remove <hi>Lady Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot</hi>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:0558800102:232"/>
from his Bed-Side. He indulged his Tears, and permitted them to flow in Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and unperceived by <hi>Lady Harriot.</hi>— In two Hours he was quite recovered, and joined the Family to their inexpreſſible Joy.</p>
               <p>THO' he took Care not to enquire for particular Perſons, yet he ſoon found, that the <hi>Good,</hi> the Honeſt Mr. <hi>Kindly,</hi> had been dead above two Years. This was a morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Blow, and coſt him many Sighs. He had often figured to his Mind the <hi>Joy</hi> the Old Man would receive when he diſcover'd himſelf, which he intended to do, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming his <hi>Old Waiſtcoat</hi> and <hi>tatter'd Bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi>—All the Gratitude he had reſolved to ſhew this <hi>Good Man,</hi> he now determined to tranſplant to his Family.—Mr. <hi>Caſſock</hi> had been Miniſter of the Pariſh Eleven Years, and his Wife was well, and had a fine Family of Children. Theſe he fix'd in his Thoughts.—The old <hi>Butler</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Mathews</hi> were dead.—<hi>Mademoiſelle Le Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre</hi> was old, but lived happily with Mrs. <hi>Caſſock</hi> on a Penſion from my Lord. The Good-natur'd <hi>Groom</hi> was a favourite Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and had a conſiderable Farm, and was well married. <hi>Conyers</hi> determin'd in himſelf to do him Service.—He viewed the Land with the utmoſt Pleaſure, but it was ſo changed, and the Inhabitants and
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0558800102:233"/>
little Houſes ſo alter'd and ſo decent, that all ſeemed Enchantment. With Difficulty could he perſuade himſelf, that <hi>Eighteen Years</hi> could make ſuch a wonderful Change. —Such is the Power of good Management, and ſuch the Effect of Induſtry!</p>
               <p>CAPTAIN CONYERS was in ſuch vaſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, that he fear'd he ſhould diſcover him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf improperly, and determin'd to watch a convenient Opportunity of opening his Heart to my <hi>Lord.</hi>—Thus they liv'd for two Months, when an Addition was made to the general Joy.

               <p>HE ſoon found out, that his Good Friend DOCTOR ST.

told him his Situation, and begg'd his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Aſſiſtance in properly bringing about a Diſcovery to Lord <hi>Mountworth.</hi>— The <hi>Biſhop</hi> took it on himſelf, but an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident turn'd it another Way.</p>
               <p>A FEW Days after his Return, my <hi>Lord</hi> heard of an <hi>Eſtate</hi> to be ſold in the next County, and that the Proprietor was in <hi>Waterford.</hi> He knew the Lands and the Owner, and ſo much wiſh'd to have his Son fix'd there, that he propoſed a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to <hi>Waterford,</hi> as the ſhorteſt and ſureſt Way of coming to an Agreement. No doubt the Ladies were in ſome Trouble, particularly <hi>Lady Harriot,</hi> but his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip raillied them out of ſuch Whimſies, and in three Days ſet out on this Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <p>ON their Arrival at <hi>Waterford,</hi> they were inform'd, that the Gentleman they wanted was then at <hi>Clonmell,</hi> and next Morning they purſued their Journey to that City. In the Evening, they travell'd lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurely on, and my <hi>Lord</hi> was diverting him with a merry Story of his Youth, when ſuddenly Mr. <hi>Conyers</hi> cry'd out, <hi>Great God!</hi> and fainted in the Poſt-Chaiſe. — His <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> in prodigious Trouble, ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the Chaiſe, and all were employed in recovering the Captain. They took him out, and no Houſe being at Hand, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd him to the Hut of a <hi>Beggar.</hi> When his Senſes weree recall'd, what was his
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0558800102:236"/>
Aſtoniſhment at finding himſelf actually placed in his <hi>firſt Habitation!</hi>—He utter'd ſome Words that greatly affected his <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> who imagined a Lightneſs in the Brain, and made him moſt ardently deſire to be in a Place where proper Aſſiſtance could be had.—In a little Time his Spirits ſo much revived, that my Lord hurry'd him into the Chaiſe, and the Beggar had Reaſon to be thankful for the Accident.</p>
               <p>THE CAPTAIN was loſt in Thought. The Idea of former Times was ſo ſtrong, and every childiſh Circumſtance recurr'd ſo clearly to his Memory, that it might have been fatal to him, had not his Eyes given Vent to the Throbbings of his Heart.— This laſted a conſiderable Time; but he was quite himſelf when he arrived at <hi>Clon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>MY <hi>dear Conyers,</hi> ſaid <hi>my Lord,</hi> you give me vaſt Pain; I perceive your Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order is not occaſioned by Sickneſs, but by ſomewhat that oppreſſes your Mind. —Relieve it, I beſeech you, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide in me, not merely as a <hi>Father,</hi> but as a <hi>Friend.</hi>—If my Power or Fortune can give you Eaſe, count it already done. Let me intreat you not to ſtifle your Cares, if you have any, which muſt tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

your Imagination, and keep me on the Rack.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>HEAVEN is my Witneſs, ſaid Mr. <hi>Conyers,</hi> I mean not to give your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> the leaſt Uneaſineſs. But, my Lord, I have ſuch a Tale of Wonder to unfold, that overcomes my Reaſon.—Can you believe, can your Lordſhip imagine, that the Hovel I was juſt now in, was my Dwelling for Years?</q>—My <hi>Lord</hi> thought him diſtracted, and advis'd him to forbear any further Relation, and go to Reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I SEE, <hi>ſaid</hi> Mr. <hi>Conyers,</hi> your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> thinks my Mind is diſturb'd.—'Tis true; but my Reaſon is clear.—Oh, my Lord! I am not capable of injurious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, but that I have deceived you, is certain.' 'My dear Son, <hi>reply'd the good Lord,</hi> I know your Honour, and your Virtue, but I know not of a Deceit.'— Yes, my Lord, <hi>anſwer'd Conyers,</hi> you are my <hi>Father;</hi> — your <hi>Bounty</hi> rais'd me;—your <hi>Humanity</hi> ſupported my Infant Weakneſs;— your <hi>Virtues</hi> form'd my Soul;—the Will of the <hi>Almighty</hi> has conducted my Steps, and now throws at your Feet, the <hi>Poor,</hi> — the <hi>Helpleſs,</hi> —the <hi>Abandon'd</hi> JACK CONNOR.</q>
               </p>
               <p>LORD MOUNTWORTH was all Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.—He forgot Mr. <hi>Conyers</hi> was on his
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0558800102:238"/>
Knees, but gazing, with Eyes of Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at laſt he rais'd him, and look'd again.—When he had fully brought to his Memory the long unthought-of Features of <hi>Jack Connor,</hi> he flew with Tranſport to his Arms.—<q>Gracious Heaven! <hi>cry'd he,</hi> how unſearchable are thy Ways.—Oh, my dear <hi>Jack,</hi> you have amply,—amply rewarded the Kindneſs I have ſhewn you. —You are now mine by every Tie.'— If your Lordſhip, <hi>ſaid Conyers,</hi> can par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the only Fallacy I was ever guilty of, you will, a ſecond Time, give me Life and Being.'—'My dear <hi>Jack, reply'd my Lord,</hi> you every Moment give me new Pleaſure;—I think you are now my ſon more than ever:—But, my Child, tell my impatient Ear how this Wonder has happen'd;—tell me how it is poſſible, when Mr. <hi>Johnſton</hi> was ſo certain of your being drown'd, that I now find, now hold you in my Arms!'—'I ſhall, <hi>anſwer'd</hi> Mr. <hi>Conyers,</hi> moſt faithfully inform your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> of every Part of my Life, but the Hurry of my Spirits is ſo great, and my Imagination, ſo fill'd with the Viciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitudes of my Fortune, that I am unable, at preſent to utter any Part. —All I can now ſay, is, moſt humbly to thank your Lordſhip, for your <hi>Humanity</hi> and <hi>Bounty,</hi>
                     <pb n="236" facs="tcp:0558800102:239"/>
to a <hi>Poor, Diſtreſſed, Helpleſs Infant,</hi> and to beſeech you, to believe, that nothing but <hi>Real Love,</hi> of my deareſt <hi>Harriot,</hi> and the dread of loſing her, could have prevented a ſooner Diſcovery. Forgive this Crime, my Lord, if Love can be a a Crime; and your Lordſhip may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that my <hi>Duty,</hi> my <hi>Gratitude,</hi> and every Sentiment of an <hi>Honeſt Heart,</hi> ſhall for ever wait on you, and on every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for whom you have the leaſt Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip or Regard.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>MY dear Son, <hi>ſaid my Lord,</hi> I can eaſily judge of the pleaſing Anxiety you are in, but retire to Reſt, and may gentle Sleep, reſtore your Peace and Tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; and may Heaven long continue it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Next Morning, Lord <hi>Mountworth</hi> in the moſt affectionate Manner, embraced <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers,</hi> and call'd him his <hi>Son,</hi>—his <hi>Friend.</hi>— <q>Permit me, <hi>ſaid the Captain,</hi> to aſk your Lordſhip, if you can give me any Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Mr. <hi>Johnſton</hi>'s Niece <hi>Nannett?</hi>' —'To the beſt of my Memory, <hi>ſaid my Lord,</hi> ſhe married Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> the Uſher, about the Time you left the School. Your old Maſter died Six Years ago, and Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> continues the former Plan of Tuition, with great Credit.</q>

                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:0558800102:240"/>
                  <q>NOW I am ſatisfied, <hi>ſaid Conyers;</hi> and now give me Leave to recount every Circumſtance of my Story, and your Lordſhip will obſerve the viſible Hand of <hi>Providence</hi> conducting and leading me to the Fruition of the moſt <hi>perfect Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs</hi> this World can afford.—It has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted me to the Arms of the deareſt and <hi>beſt of Wives,</hi> and to the Sight of the nobleſt and <hi>beſt of Men.</hi> —Heaven, I beſeech thee, make me moſt truly thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</q>
               </p>
               <p>HE then began the Narrative of his Life, <q>which, if the Reader has forgot, he has my Permiſſion to read again, for I have not Time to Recapitulate.</q>
               </p>
               <p>EVERY Incident and Change of his Life, gave his Lordſhip freſh Matter for Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; but what ſtruck him the moſt, was his being the Son of <hi>Sir Roger Thornton,</hi> who had married his Siſter.—<q>I ſhall ever, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> admire your Prudence, in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Affairs ſo <hi>ſecret,</hi> and I ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Honour your laudable <hi>Ambition</hi> and <hi>Gratitude.</hi>—When our <hi>dear Harriot</hi> has bleſs'd you with a Child, both ſhe and my dear <hi>Wife</hi> ſhall partake of the Joy your Story has given me, and my Son <hi>Harry,</hi> muſt ſhare in the Pleaſure.—As for <hi>Sir Roger,</hi> he muſt know nothing of
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0558800102:241"/>
it, for he has a <hi>certain Pride</hi> in his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that would ſoon divulge it to the World, and, perhaps, not in its genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine Colours.—For my own Part, my <hi>deareſt Jack,</hi> I am ſo far from being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of your Alliance, that I glory in it; yet, my Son, I would not chuſe to be the conſtant Theme of the <hi>Ignorant.</hi>— TITLES are but the Rewards of <hi>Merit,</hi> but <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Haughtineſs</hi> debaſe them.— <hi>Diſtinctions,</hi> are only Incentives to <hi>Noble Deeds;</hi> and <hi>true Nobility</hi> will ever encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them. — <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Tenderneſs,</hi> are the Characteriſticks of A MAN, and did Mankind love <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> more than <hi>Pride, Falſhood</hi> and <hi>Detraction,</hi> the Occurrences of your Life would <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> their Reſolves, and convince ALL,— That to be REALLY HAPPY, they muſt be TRULY VIRTUOUS.</q>

            <p>YOUR inherent <hi>Good-fooliſhneſs</hi> will natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally imagine I mean <hi>IRELAND.</hi>— This mighty <hi>Monarchy,</hi> for ages governed by Kings of <hi>our Houſe!</hi>—This extenſive <hi>Realm,</hi> famous for the Title of <hi>Iſle of Saints,</hi> the indelible Character of our noble Family! — This <hi>State,</hi> peculiarly che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed and fed by our ſpiritual Father the <hi>Pope!</hi>—And yet, to our Shame be it ſpoken, this, ſo valuable a Part of our Dominions is likely to be <hi>wreſted</hi> from Us. —Yes, <hi>Sir,</hi> we ſhall ſoon loſe our ancient Inheritance, except we exert all our Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and by <hi>vigorous,</hi> and <hi>antiſalutary</hi> Schemes, prevent what muſt be ſo <hi>fatal</hi> to our Intereſt.</p>

            <p>AGAIN we ſtruggled, and followed the <hi>Standard</hi> of your <hi>illuſtrious God-Father,</hi> KING JAMES <hi>the Second.</hi>—Tho' the PRINCE OF ORANGE was our moſt <hi>inveterate Foe;</hi>

            <p>FROM that Time, theſe <hi>Miſcreants</hi> have been but <hi>too careful</hi> in <hi>framing,</hi> and what is worſe, putting in <hi>Execution</hi> ſundry <hi>Laws,</hi> deſtructive of our <hi>antient Rights.</hi> Thus have they proceeded for theſe <hi>ſixty Years,</hi> without the <hi>leaſt Check;</hi> and have ſo <hi>artfully</hi> managed their Affairs, that, withal the <hi>Machinations</hi> and <hi>Contrivances,</hi> of ſundry <hi>Potentates,</hi> your <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Allies,</hi> they never could be brought even to <hi>think</hi> of REBELLION in ſupport of your <hi>Fooliſhneſs,</hi> or <hi>Family,</hi> except with <hi>Horror.</hi>—So <hi>averſe</hi> were theſe <hi>Savages</hi> to your <hi>gentle Sway,</hi> that, whilſt <hi>Numbers</hi> of <hi>our Relations</hi> marched, even into the Heart of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>your Cauſe:</hi> They, <hi>the Proteſtants,</hi> raiſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of <hi>ſixty thouſand</hi> Horſe and Foot, <hi>well armed, regimented,</hi> and moſtly <hi>uniformly cloathed,</hi> and effectually <hi>guarded</hi> IRELAND,

            </p>
            <p>I HAD a Degree of Happineſs, on being informed that in 1742, our <hi>Friends</hi> there were about <hi>ſeven</hi> to <hi>one Enemy.</hi>—But alas, Sir! on further Enquiry, I am, but too well convinced, that in <hi>fifty Years,</hi> you, or your Poſterity, will not have a <hi>ſingle Heart warm in your Cauſe.</hi>—The Encouragement given to Huſbandry, Manufactures, Arts and Sciences, is <hi>monſtrous!</hi> Even beyond what any other Nation <hi>ever did!</hi>—They have <hi>inverted</hi> the whole Order of <hi>Nature;</hi> they have extracted <hi>Corn</hi> from our old <hi>venerable Boggs,</hi> and feed Millions of <hi>Sheep</hi> and <hi>Oxen,</hi> on thoſe Plains, antiently conſecrated to <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>religious</hi> Uſes.—But what will not <hi>Impiety</hi> do?</p>

            <p>I REALLY always imagined that theſe Contributors were of the <hi>loweſt Order</hi> of the People; but great was my Surpriſe to find, at a late Meeting, ſo many of the <hi>firſt Faſhion</hi> and <hi>Reputation</hi> in the Kingdom.

               <salute>Dear Couſin,</salute>
               <dateline>LONDON, <date>1748.</date>
               </dateline>

            <p>IN the laſt I had the Honour of writing to you, I traced out the <hi>Riſe</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs</hi> of WISDOM in your antient Kingdom of IRELAND.—Permit me, a little, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the Subject, and then I ſhall mention my <hi>Ways</hi> for making their <hi>Wiſdom</hi> abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
            <p>SOME of their Wiſe Heads have found out, that <hi>Ireland</hi> contains about <hi>two Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions</hi> of Inhabitants, and they have likewiſe found out, that the <hi>Riches</hi> and <hi>Proſperity</hi> of a Nation are in Proportion to their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants <hi>properly employed.</hi>—Such a Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very was infinitely againſt the <hi>true Intereſt</hi> of our Family.—On this they built, and then computed the Value to the Government of every <hi>induſtrious Individual,</hi> which, I think, they made amount to about <hi>ten Pounds</hi> a Year.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:0558800102:255"/>THEY then proceeded by a Thing called Arithmetick.—<hi>If</hi> ONE <hi>induſtrious Subject— be worth</hi> TEN POUNDS <hi>a Year to the State, —what will be the Value of</hi> TWO MILLIONS of <hi>ſuch Subjects?</hi>—And, ſuch is the Power of Figures! They made it plain that that Number was really worth TWENTY MIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIONS each Year.</p>
            <p>IN order to acquire ſuch <hi>Riches,</hi> the firſt Care of theſe <hi>avaritious Gentry</hi> was to poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the Minds of their Tenants with No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Induſtry.</hi>—No eaſy Taſk! But as they knew, that the <hi>Popiſh Religion,</hi>—their having ſuch Swarms of <hi>Prieſts</hi> to maintain,— their Number of <hi>Holy Days,</hi>—and their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Diſpoſition to <hi>Sauntering,</hi> were ſo many Draw-backs to <hi>Wealth, Honeſty,</hi> and <hi>Cleanlineſs,</hi> it was thought neceſſary to change the <hi>Religion</hi> of the People, and make them ſpurn at our <hi>holy Inſtitutions.</hi>— This cruel Blow has been but too well fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed; — Their <hi>Labour</hi> and <hi>Induſtry</hi> have matched with ſuch gigantick Strides, that within theſe <hi>twenty Years,</hi> the whole Face of the Country is changed.—Now the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller journies on <hi>Roads</hi> the fineſt in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> and repoſes himſelf, not in <hi>Barns,</hi> or <hi>Hovels,</hi> but in good, <hi>clean,</hi> and <hi>commodious</hi> Houſes.—He may in Time be entertained with all the Beauties of the Country,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0558800102:256"/>
heightned and improved by <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry.</hi>—He may behold <hi>uſeful</hi> and <hi>orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental</hi> Structures ariſe; and ſee <hi>Gardens</hi> and Plantations flouriſh.— Theſe indeed would be ſhocking Sights!</p>
            <p>'TIS amazing to obſerve, how the <hi>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial Praemiums</hi> of a little Society in DUBLIN have ſpurred on <hi>greedy Minds.</hi>—Scarcely has any Branch of <hi>Manufacture,</hi> or <hi>uſeful Art,</hi> eſcaped their Notice and <hi>Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>—Such low Creatures are they, that they ranſack even the <hi>Dunghills,</hi> and give Praemiums to the old Women, who gather moſt <hi>Rags to make Paper.</hi>—Should our Schemes oblige the <hi>Rebels</hi> to return to your Obedience, I would except theſe <hi>Fellows</hi> out of the general Pardon.</p>
            <p>WHAT have we not to fear, ſhould <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry,</hi> like other Novelties, become a <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion</hi> in <hi>Ireland.</hi>—INDUSTRY! The <hi>Parent</hi> of every <hi>ſocial Virtue;</hi>—the <hi>Founder</hi> of all <hi>real Honour;</hi>—the <hi>Support</hi> of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> and <hi>Preſerver</hi> of <hi>true Religion!</hi>— PROPERTY is her conſtant Attendant, and LIBERTY gives her Spirits <hi>freely</hi> to enjoy it.—<hi>Virtue, Property,</hi> and <hi>Liberty,</hi> are not Concomitants of our <hi>Conſtitution.</hi> They muſt be <hi>baniſhed,</hi> or your <hi>Fooliſhneſs</hi> will be <hi>depoſed.</hi> Therefore, THE PROTESTANT WORKING SCHOOLS <hi>muſt</hi> be <hi>deſtroyed.</hi>

            <p>THO' it happens, that GREAT-BRITAIN and IRELAND are governed by the ſame <hi>Monarch,</hi> and the ſame <hi>Laws,</hi> and tho' the <hi>principal</hi> Inhabitants of the <hi>latter,</hi> ſpring from the <hi>former,</hi> yet Nature, indulgent to your Intereſt, has <hi>divided</hi> them by a <hi>little Sea.</hi>—Be it therefore our peculiar Care to <hi>divide their Minds,</hi> by encouraging <hi>Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy,</hi> and the ſalutary Seeds of <hi>Deriſion</hi> and <hi>Animoſity.</hi>—By all Means, prevent the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from ever getting the better of their <hi>Prejudices</hi> to the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and keep the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in a perpetual <hi>envious</hi> Diſpoſition to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> For, though we cannot prevent their being IN FACT but <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame People,</hi> this Conduct will give them <hi>two diſtinct Minds,</hi> and make their UNION <hi>uſeleſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>EVERY Inſtrument muſt be employed to keep up the <hi>general Opinion,</hi> that <hi>Ireland</hi> muſt be <hi>bridled</hi> and <hi>curbed.</hi>—Never permit them to diſcover, that it would be <hi>unjuſt</hi> to make <hi>different Laws</hi> for the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> or, that the County of <hi>Surry</hi> ſhould have <hi>leſs Freedom</hi> than the County of <hi>Middleſex;</hi> becauſe the <hi>Thames</hi> divides them.—How

fatal had it been to our <hi>good Cauſe,</hi> and to our faithful Friends, <hi>the Diſturbers of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> had <hi>Ireland</hi> been joined to the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Part of the Weſtern Shore of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land!</hi>—They would then have been <hi>all Proteſtants.</hi>—This Kingdom would have been <hi>Two Thirds</hi> larger than it is,—have had <hi>four or five Millions</hi> more of Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and a proportionable Increaſe of <hi>Taxes</hi> to the Government; conſequently the Government leſs in <hi>Debt,</hi> if at all; or, if in <hi>Debt,</hi> better enabled to pay that Debt. —<hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> would have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupplied with <hi>Iriſh Officers</hi> and <hi>Soldiers,</hi> who happen, though our Relations, not to be the worſt of the Profeſſion.</p>

            <p>I AM in Raptures at the Thought!— Purſue it, Sir, in the Name of <hi>Ignorance;</hi> and inſtantly you will ſee, all their <hi>mighty Fabrick tumble to the Ground,</hi> and your <hi>Fame</hi> will be exalted for ever!—<hi>Ireland</hi> muſt then infallibly become a <hi>Drain</hi> of Riches from <hi>England,</hi> and not a <hi>Source</hi> of <hi>Plenty.</hi>—She may <hi>want Aſſiſtance</hi> from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but will <hi>never be able</hi> to return the Compliment.—Thus enervated, no more can ſhe ſupport <hi>thirty ſeven Regiments</hi> of <hi>Britiſh Subjects,</hi> always ready to obey their <hi>Monarch.</hi>—She may indeed have an Army quartered on her; but <hi>their Pay</hi> muſt iſſue from the ſame Fountain, which ſupplies the Army in <hi>Scotland.</hi>—Her preſent <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentees</hi> muſt then become <hi>Reſident;</hi> for, by <hi>Ruining this,</hi> her <hi>only Branch</hi> of valuable Commerce, ſhe can never ſend out the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0558800102:264"/>
twentieth Part of the <hi>annual Million,</hi> ſhe now beſtows on them.</p>
            <p>'TIS impoſſible to mention the innumer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Advantages ariſing to us from ſuch a <hi>Project</hi> well executed.—ROME would be <hi>glad,</hi> and <hi>France</hi> rejoice at it.—<hi>Ignorance</hi> would <hi>triple</hi> her Number of <hi>Beads. Sloth</hi> would <hi>multiply</hi> her <hi>pleaſant Bogs,</hi> and <hi>Indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> live magnificently in <hi>Smoak,</hi> and <hi>Mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walls!</hi> In fine, all <hi>our Family,</hi> to the moſt diſtant <hi>Relation,</hi> would be <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificently</hi> provided for, and your <hi>Throne</hi> eſtabliſhed, as in the Days of <hi>Roderick O'Connor,</hi> of gallant Memory.</p>
            <p>'TIS in <hi>vain</hi> to attempt in <hi>England</hi> a thorough Reformation in our Favour; but we can always throw in ſuch <hi>Bars</hi> to their <hi>Happineſs,</hi> and ſo <hi>weaken</hi> the <hi>Nerves</hi> and <hi>Sinews</hi> of their Government, that all their <hi>Conqueſts</hi> over us ſhall <hi>avail them little,</hi> or perhaps even become a <hi>Charge</hi> to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>DULLNESS</hi> be praiſed, all Thoughts are now dropt of making <hi>Ireland</hi> a <hi>Corn Country.</hi> I own, I am ſurpriſed their <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi> do not attempt it, as it would ſo much encreaſe their <hi>Tythes.</hi> They have talked of <hi>publick Granaries,</hi> but it was meer Talk; nor ſhall I remind them of it.—Indeed an Attempt was once made to encourage <hi>Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage,</hi> by granting, as in <hi>England,</hi> a <hi>Bounty
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0558800102:265"/>
on Corn exported;</hi> but your <hi>Fooliſhneſs</hi> nobly exerted yourſelf on that Occaſion, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated the <hi>Project.</hi> You rightly judged, that though <hi>Paſturage</hi> employed the <hi>Land,</hi> it was in <hi>no Shape</hi> ſo prejudicial to your <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt</hi> as <hi>Ploughing,</hi> which <hi>fills a Country with laborious Inhabitants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WITHOUT Vanity I may ſay, I gave the firſt <hi>Hint</hi> of <hi>reſtraining Ireland,</hi> with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to WOOLL, and then, I <hi>dexterouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived,</hi> that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> might <hi>ſmuggle</hi> it as well as <hi>themſelves.</hi> The happy Conſequence is, that <hi>Thouſands of the</hi> French <hi>are amuſed in manufacturing of it, whilſt as many of your Rebel Subjects are ſtarving at Home.</hi>—To my great Joy, this cannot <hi>ſuddenly</hi> be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd; for ſo long as the <hi>Iriſh love Mutton,</hi> and feed <hi>Millions of Sheep;</hi> and ſo long as they have <hi>more Wooll,</hi> than their <hi>home Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption requires,</hi> ſo long will they <hi>act</hi> on the Principles of their <hi>Neighbours,</hi> and ſell it to the <hi>beſt Bidder.</hi>—Perhaps your <hi>Fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> will be ſurprized, that ſo large a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom as <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould want <hi>Iriſh</hi> or <hi>Engliſh Wooll:</hi> But—let me wiſper in your Ear.—<hi>All their Wooll cannot make one Piece of Serge.</hi>—Why this is ſo, LEEDS, and every Cloathing Town in <hi>England</hi> can bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter explain than I.—Should they ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt a <hi>Change</hi> in this Matter, let us get a
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0558800102:266"/>
               <hi>Burrough</hi> or two to <hi>petition</hi> againſt it, and order your Brother CLAMOUR to attend.— They are truly, <hi>in this Reſpect,</hi> in <hi>the Way</hi> we wiſh them in; nor do I believe they will alter, till they are convinced, <hi>That it is more eligible to encourage the Subjects of</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>in ſome certain Branches of Trade, than by a contrary Conduct, drive thoſe Branches into the Arms of the common Enemy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>general Rule,</hi> and the moſt ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful is, <hi>eternally</hi> to play <hi>one Part</hi> of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy</hi> againſt the <hi>other,</hi> and conſtantly to keep up <hi>that noble Spirit</hi> of <hi>Grumbling,</hi> and <hi>turning</hi> every Act of their <hi>Government</hi> into <hi>Ridicule.</hi> What MACHIAVEL ſays of a <hi>Prince,</hi> may well be applied to GREAT-BRITAIN and <hi>Ireland.</hi> 
               <q>They ought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things carefully to avoid render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves odious or deſpicable; for ſuch a Conduct protects them from eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Danger.</q>—Could we contrive, not only to make them odious and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable in the Eyes of their <hi>Neighbours,</hi> but likewiſe to each other, how happy ſhould we be!</p>
            <p>MAY our Endeavours proſper! and may your <hi>Fooliſhneſs</hi> once more ſhine on the <hi>Throne</hi> of your <hi>Anceſtors!</hi>—May ENG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND think hardly of SCOTLAND.—May
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0558800102:267"/>
SCOTLAND abuſe IRELAND.—And may IRELAND envy one, and reproach the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther!—May this regular Confuſion have no <hi>End,</hi> until <hi>that Day,</hi> when your <hi>Fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs,</hi> in the Fullneſs of your <hi>Glory,</hi> ſhall ſay, <q>Now indeed are ye all my Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren.</q>
            </p>
            <p>SHOULD the Reverſe happen, and their Wiſdom prevail over us.—Should the PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TESTANT WORKING SCHOOLS in <hi>Ireland</hi> continue to be ſupported by the Charity of <hi>England,</hi> without which they cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt.—Should the Linen Manufacture of that Kingdom, inſtead of being ruined, become more powerfully protected and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by this.—Should they fall on equitable Ways, to prevent exporting Wooll to <hi>France.</hi> In ſhort, ſhould they become Wiſe and Induſtrious, and by the natural Union of the Members to the <hi>Head, aſſiſt</hi> and not <hi>deſtroy each other.</hi> Should theſe come to paſs, what muſt become of Us, and Our numerous Offspring!—For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid it, all ye Gods of Error!—O Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery! all that could remain for us, would be to fly to ROME, AVIGNON, <hi>Boulogn,</hi> or <hi>St. Germains.</hi>—There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moan our <hi>unhappy Fate,</hi> talk of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Splendor, and <hi>live</hi> on the <hi>Bounty of
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0558800102:268"/>
our Relations; for work we cannot, but to beg we are not aſhamed.</hi>—There with my lateſt Breath I ſhall <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>revere</hi> your <hi>Name,</hi> and <hi>expire</hi> in a <hi>Wiſh</hi> for your <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration.</hi> I am with all Duty,</p>
