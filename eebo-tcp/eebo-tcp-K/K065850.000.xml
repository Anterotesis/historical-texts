            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

OF THE
SIXTH Book of the AENEID.</head>
            <div type="section">
               <p>THE Allegorical Interpretation which
the Biſhop of Gloceſter has given of
the Sixth Book of the Aeneid, ſeems
to have been very favourably received by the
Public. Many writers, both at home and
abroad, have mentioned it with approbation,
or at leaſt with eſteem; and I have more than
once heard it alledged, in the converſation of
ſcholars, as an ingenious improvement on the
plain and obvious ſenſe of Virgil. As ſuch,
it is not undeſerving of the notice of a candid
critic; nor can the enquiry be void of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment,
whilſt Virgil is our conſtant theme.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0468400500:4"/>
Whatever may be the fortune of the chace,
we are ſure it will lead us through pleaſant
proſpects and a fine country.</p>
               <p>That I may eſcape the imputation as well
as the danger of miſrepreſenting his Lordſhip's
Hypotheſis, I ſhall expoſe it in his own words.
<q rend="inline">The purpoſe of this Diſcourſe is to ſhew that
Aeneas's adventure to the INFERNAL SHADES,
is no other than a figurative deſcription of
his INITIATION INTO THE MYSTERIES; and
particularly a very exact one of the SPECTA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CLES
of the ELEUSINIAN<note n="1" place="bottom">See Warburton's Diſſertation, &amp;c. in the third volume of Mr. Warton's Virgil. I ſhall quote indifferently that Diſſertation or the Divine Legation itſelf.</note>.</q> This gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
notion is ſupported with ſingular ingenuity,
dreſſed up with an eaſy yet pompous diſplay of
Learning, and delivered in a ſtyle much fitter
for the Hierophant of Eleuſis, than for a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Critic, who is obſerving a remote object
through the medium of a glimmering and
doubtful light: <q>Ibant obſcuri, ſolâ ſub nocte, per umbram.</q>
               </p>
               <p>His Lordſhip naturally enough purſues two
different methods which unite, as he apprehends,
in the ſame concluſion. From general prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
peculiar to himſelf, he infers the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0468400500:5"/>
and even neceſſity of ſuch a Deſcription
of the Myſteries; and from a compariſon of
particular circumſtances he labours to prove
that Virgil has actually introduced it into the
Aeneid. Each of theſe methods ſhall be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
ſeparately.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <p>As the learned Prelate's Opinions branch

eaſy to reſume them in a few words. I ſhall,
however, attempt to give a ſhort idea of thoſe
general principles, which occupy, I know not
how, ſo great a ſhare of the <hi>Divine Legation
of Moſes demonſtrated.</hi>

                  <q type="inline">The whole Syſtem of Paganiſm, of which
the Myſteries were an eſſential part, was
inſtituted by the Antient Lawgivers for the

who intended his immortal Poem for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public

               <p>What a crowd of natural reflections muſt

firſt fathers of rude ſocieties inſtruct their new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made
ſubjects in philoſophy as well as in agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture?
Did they all agree, in Britain as in
Egypt, in Perſia as in Greece, to found theſe

things be? Yes, replies the learned prelate;
they are: <q rend="inline">Egypt was the myſterious mother

Amongſt theſe authors we may obſerve Sanchoniatho, Orpheus, Zaleucus, Charondas, the Oracles of Prophry, and the Hiſtory of Jeffrey of Monmouth.</p>
                     <p>The biſhop has entered the liſts with the tremendous Bentley, who treated the laws of Zaleucus and Charondas as the forgeries of a ſophiſt. A whole ſection of miſtakes or miſrepreſentations is devoted to this controverſy: But Bentley is no more, and W<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>I ſhall, however, diſturb his repoſe, by aſking him on what authority he ſuppoſes that the old language of the Twelve Tables was altered for the conveniency of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ages. The fragments of thoſe laws, collected by Lipſius, Sylburgius, &amp;c. bear the ſtamp of the moſt remote antiquity. Lipſius himſelf (tom. i. p. 206.) was highly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with thoſe <hi>Antiquiſſima Verba:</hi> But what is much more deciſive, Horace (L. II. Ep. i. Ver. 23), Seneca (Epiſtol. 114), and Aulus Gellius (XX. 1), rank thoſe laws amongſt the oldeſt remains of the Latin tongue. Their obſolete language was admired by the lawyers, ridiculed by the wits, and pleaded by the friends of antiquity as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for the frequent obſcurities of that code.</p>
                     <p>Had an adverſary to the <hi>Divine Legation</hi> been guilty of this miſtake, I am afraid it would have been ſtyled an <hi>egregious blunder.</hi>

ſome volumes of controverſy; and ſince I have
peruſed the two thouſand and fourteen pages
of the unfiniſhed <hi>Legation,</hi> I have leſs inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
than ever to ſpin out volumes of laborious
trifles.</p>
               <p>I ſhall, however, venture to point out a fact,
not very agreeable to the favourite notion, that
Paganiſm was entirely the Religion of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate.
The Oracles were not leſs antient, nor
leſs venerable than the Myſteries. Every diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
religious or civil, was ſubmitted to the
deciſion of thoſe infallible tribunals. During
ſeveral ages no war could be undertaken, no
colony founded, without the ſanction of the
Delphic Oracle; the firſt and moſt celebrated
amongſt ſeveral hundred others<note n="6" place="bottom">See Vandale de Oraculis, p. 559. That valuable book contains whatever can now be known of Oracles. I have borrowed his facts; and could with great eaſe have borrowed his quotations.</note>. Here
then we might expect to perceive the directing
hand of the magiſtrate. Yet when we ſtudy
their hiſtory with attention, inſtead of the Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
between Church and State, we can only
diſcover the antient Alliance between the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0468400500:9"/>
Avarice of the Prieſt and the Credulity of the
People.</p>
               <p>For my own part, I am very apt to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Myſteries in the ſame light as the
Oracles. An intimate connection ſubſiſted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them<note n="7" place="bottom">
                     <p>The prophet Alexander, whoſe arts are ſo admirably laid open by Lucian, inſtituted his Oracle and his Myſteries as regular parts of the ſame plan. It is here we may ſay, with the learned Catholic, <q rend="inline">Les nouveaux Saints me font douter des Anciens.</q>

                  </note>: Both were preceded and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with faſts, ſacrifices, and luſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
with myſtic ſights and preternatural
ſounds: But the moſt eſſential preparation for
the ASPIRANT, was a general confeſſion of his
paſt life, which was exacted of him by the Prieſt.
In return for this implicit confidence, the Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
conferred on the Initiated a ſacred cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter;
and promiſed them a peculiar place of
happineſs in the Elyſian fields, whilſt the ſouls
of the Profane (however virtuous they had
been) were wallowing in the mire<note n="8" place="bottom">See Diogen. Laert. vi. 39. &amp; Menag. ad loc.</note>. Nor
did the Prieſts of the Myſteries neglect to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
to the brethren a ſpirit of friendſhip,
and the love of virtue; ſo pleaſing even to the
moſt corrupt minds, and ſo requiſite to render
any ſociety reſpectable in its own eyes. Of all
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0468400500:10"/>
theſe religious ſocieties, that of Eleuſis was the
moſt illuſtrious. From being peculiar to the
inhabitants of Attica, it became at laſt common
to the whole Pagan world. Indeed, I ſhould
ſuſpect that it was much indebted to the genius
of the Athenian writers, who beſtowed fame and
dignity on whatever had the leaſt connection
with their country; nor am I ſurpriſed that
Cicero and Atticus, who were both initiated,
ſhould expreſs themſelves with enthuſiaſm, when
they ſpeak of the ſacred rites of their beloved
Athens.</p>
               <p>But our curioſity is yet unſatisfied; we would
preſs forwards into the ſanctuary; and are eager
to learn, WHAT was the SECRET which was reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Initiated, and to them alone. Many of
the Profane, poſſeſſed of leiſure and ingenuity,
haved tried to gueſs, what has been ſo religiouſly
concealed. The SECRET of each is curious and
philoſophical; for as ſoon as we attempt this
Enquiry, the honour of the Myſteries becomes
our own<note n="9" place="bottom">
                     <p>I ſhall ſum them up in a curious paſſage of the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Freret. <q rend="inline">Les ſectes philoſophiques cherchoient à diviner le Dogme caché ſous le voile des Ceremonies; &amp; tachoient de le ramener chacune à leur doctrine.

of Virgil's Republic, he has no more buſineſs
with the Myſteries of Athens, than with the
laws of Sparta. We will, therefore, reflect a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on the true nature and plan of the Aeneid.</p>
               <p>An Epic Fable muſt be important as well as
intereſting: Great actions, great virtues, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0468400500:13"/>
great diſtreſſes, are the peculiar province of
Heroic Poetry. This rule ſeems to have been
dictated by nature and experience, and is very
different from thoſe chains in which Genius has
been bound by artificial Criticiſm. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
I ſpeak of, is not indeed always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant
on the rank or names of the Perſonages.
Columbus, exploring a new world with three
ſloops and ninety ſailors, is a Hero worthy of
the Epic Muſe; yet our imagination would be
much more ſtrongly affected by the image of a
virtuous Prince ſaved from the ruins of his
country, and conducting his faithful followers
through unknown ſeas and through hoſtile lands.
Such is the Hero of the Aeneid. But his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
ſituation ſuggeſted other beauties to the
Poet, who had an opportunity of adorning his
ſubject with whatever was moſt pleaſing in Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
fable, or moſt illuſtrious in Roman hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.
Aeneas had fought under the walls of
Ilium; and conducted to the Banks of the
Tyber a Colony from which Rome claimed her
origin.</p>
               <p>The character of the Hero is expreſſed by one
of his friends in a few words; and, tho' drawn
by a friend, does not ſeem to be flattered: <q>
                     <l>Rex erat Aeneas nobis; quo juſtior alter,</l>

its ſingularity ſeems to deſerve.</p>
               <p>After Evander had entertained his Gueſts,
with a ſublime ſimplicity, he lamented, that his
age and want of power made him a very uſeleſs
Ally. However, he points out auxiliaries and
a cauſe worthy of a Hero. The Etruſcans, tired
out with the repeated tyrannies of Mezentius,
had driven that monarch from his throne, and
reduced him to implore the protection of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.
Unſatisfied with freedom, the Etruſcans
called loudly for revenge; and, in the Poet's
opinion, revenge was juſtice. <q>
                     <l>Ergo omnis <hi>furiis</hi> ſurrexit Etruria <hi>juſtis</hi>:</l>

Aeneas, with the approbation of Gods and men,
accepts the command of theſe brave rebels, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0468400500:15"/>
puniſhes the Tyrant with the death he ſo well
deſerved. The conduct of Aeneas and the
Etruſcans may, in point of juſtice, ſeem doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to many; the ſentiments of the Poet cannot
appear equivocal to any one. Milton himſelf,
I mean the Milton of the Commonwealth, could
not have aſſerted with more energy the daring
pretenſions of the people, to puniſh as well as
to reſiſt a Tyrant. Such opinions, publiſhed by
a writer, whom we are taught to conſider as the
creature of Auguſtus, have a right to ſurprize
us; yet they are ſtrongly expreſſive of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of the times; the Republic was ſubverted,
but the minds of the Romans were ſtill Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Aeneas's piety has been more generally
confeſſed than admired. St. Evremond laughs
at it, as unſuitable to his own temper. The
Biſhop of Glouceſter defends it, as agreeable to
his own Syſtem of the Lawgiver's Religion.
The French wit was too ſuperficial, the Engliſh
ſcholar too profound, to attend to the plain nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Poet, and the peculiar circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of antient Heroes. WE believe from
faith and reaſon: THEY believed from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of their ſenſes. Aeneas had ſeen the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
Divinities overturning the foundations of
fated Troy. He was perſonally acquainted with
his mother Venus, and with his perſecutor Juno.
Mercury, who commanded him to leave Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0468400500:16"/>
was as preſent to his eyes as Dido, who
ſtrove to detain him. Such a knowledge of
Religion, founded on ſenſe and experience, muſt
inſinuate itſelf into every inſtant of our lives,
and determine every action. All this is, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
fiction; but it is fiction in which we chuſe
to acquieſce, and which we juſtly conſider as the
charm of Poetry. If we allow, that Aeneas
lived in an intimate commerce with ſuperior Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
we muſt likewiſe allow, his love or his
fear, his confidence or his gratitude, towards
thoſe Beings, to diſplay themſelves on every
proper occaſion. Far from thinking Aeneas
too pious, I am ſometimes ſurprized at his
want of faith. Forgetful of the Fates, which
had ſo often and ſo clearly pointed out the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtined
ſhores of Latium, he deliberates, whether
he ſhall not ſit down quietly in the fields of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily.
An apparition of his father is neceſſary
to divert him from this impious and ungene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
deſign.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A Hero's valor will not bear the rude
breath of ſuſpicion; yet has the courage of
Aeneas ſuffered from an unguarded expreſſion
of the Poet:

On every other occaſion, the Trojan chief is

daring without raſhneſs, and prudent without
timidity. In that dreadful night, when Troy
was delivered up to her hoſtile Gods, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
every duty of a Soldier, a Patriot, and
a Son.

To quote other proofs of the ſame nature, would
be to copy the ſix laſt books of the Aeneid. I
cannot, however, forbear mentioning the calm
and ſuperior intrepidity of the Hero, when,
after the perfidy of the Rutuli, and his wound,
he ruſhed again to the field, and reſtored Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory

Had Virgil deſigned to compoſe a POLITICAL
INSTITUTE, the Example of Fenelon, his elegant
Imitator, may give us ſome notion of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in which he would have proceeded. The
preceptor of the Duke of Burgundy profeſſedly
deſigned to educate a prince for the happineſs of
the people. Every incident in his pleaſing Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
is ſubſervient to that great end. The
Goddeſs of Wiſdom, in a human ſhape, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts
her pupil thro' a varied ſeries of inſtructive
adventures; and every adventure is a leſſon or a
warning for Telemachus. The pride of Seſoſtris,
the tyranny of Pygmalion, the perfidy of Adraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,
and the imprudence of Idomeneus, are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played
in their true light. The innocence of the
inhabitants of Boetica, the commerce of Tyre,
and the wiſe laws of Crete and Salentum, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
the prince of the various means by which
a people may be made happy. From the Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus
of Fenelon, I could paſs with pleaſure
to the Cyropoedia of Xenophon. But I ſhould be
led too far from my ſubject, were I to attempt
to lay open the true nature and deſign of that

               <p>His Lordſhip props the legiſlative character of
Aeneas with an additional ſupport: <q rend="inline">Auguſtus,

                  </q> This doctrine of types and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
though true in general, has on this, as
well as on graver occaſions, produced a great
abuſe of reaſon, or at leaſt of reaſoning. To
confine myſelf to Virgil, I ſhall only ſay, that he
was too judicious to compliment the Emperor,
at the expence of good ſenſe and probability.
Every age has its manners; and the poet muſt
ſuit his Hero to the Age, and not the Age to his
Hero. It is eaſy to give inſtances of this truth.
Marc Antony, when defeated and beſieged in
Alexandria, challenged his competitor to decide
their quarrel by a ſingle combat. This was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
by Auguſtus with contempt and deriſion,
as the laſt effort of a deſperate man<note n="8" place="bottom">Plutarch, in Vit. M. Anton. tom. i. 950. Edit. Wechel.</note>; and the
world applauded the prudence of Auguſtus, who
preferred the part of a General to that of a Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator.
The temper and good ſenſe of Virgil
muſt have made him view things in the ſame
light; yet, when Virgil introduces Aeneas in
ſimilar circumſtances, he gives him a quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
conduct. The Hero wiſhes to ſpare the
innocent people, provokes Turnus to a ſingle
combat, and, even after the perfidy and laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat
of the Rutuli, is ſtill ready to riſk his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and victory, againſt the unhappy life and
deſperate fortunes of his Rival. The laws of
Honor are different in different Ages; and a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0468400500:23"/>
which in Auguſtus was decent, would
have covered Aeneas with infamy.</p>
               <p>We may apply this obſervation to the very
caſe of the Eleuſinian Myſteries. Auguſtus was
initiated into them, at a time when Eleuſis was
become the COMMON TEMPLE OF THE UNI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERSE.
The Trojan Hero could not with the

               <p>Notwithſtanding this diſappointment, which is

the Eleuſinian Myſteries. The Critic liſtens to
their converſation; but, alas! Aeneas is only
enquiring, in what part of the garden he may
find his Father's ſhade; to which Muſaeus returns
a very polite anſwer. Anchiſes himſelf is our laſt

               <p>It is obſervable, that the three great Poets of
Rome were all addicted to the Epicurean philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy;
a Syſtem, however, the leaſt ſuited to a

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0468400500:27"/>
Powers of Nature, to ſubſtitute in their room a
dreary void, blind atoms, and indolent Gods. A
Deſcription of the Infernal Shades was incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
with the ideas of a Philoſopher, whoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
boaſted, that he had reſcued the captive
World from the Tyranny of Religion, and the
Fear of a Future State. Theſe ideas, Virgil was
obliged to reject: But he does ſtill more; he
abandons not only the CHANCE of Epicurus, but
even theſe Gods, whom he ſo nobly employs in
the reſt of his Poem, that he may offer to the
Reader's imagination a far more ſpecious and
ſplendid ſett of Ideas.

The more we examine theſe lines, the more we
ſhall feel the ſublime Poetry of them. But they
have likewiſe an air of Philoſophy and even of
Religion, which goes off on a nearer approach.
The mind which is INFUSED<note n="6" place="bottom">Quomodo porro Deus iſte ſi nihil eſſet niſi animus, aut infixus aut <hi>infuſus</hi> eſſet in mundo. <hi>Cicero de Naturâ Deor.</hi> l. i. c. 11.</note> into the ſeveral

with the mighty maſs, ſcarce retains any Property

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0468400500:28"/>
affinity to the Principles, which the impious Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noza
revived rather than invented.</p>
               <p>I am not inſenſible, that we ſhould be ſlow to
ſuſpect, and ſtill ſlower to condemn. The po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
of human language, and the obſcurity of
human ideas, makes it difficult to ſpeak worthily
of THE GREAT FIRST CAUSE. Our moſt reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Poets, in ſtriving to expreſs the preſence
and energy of the Deity, in every part of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,
deviate unwarily into images, which are
ſcarcely diſtinguiſhed from Materialiſm. Thus
our Ethic Poet:
<q>
                     <l>All are but parts of one ſtupendous Whole,</l>
                     <l>Whoſe body Nature is, and God the ſoul<note n="7" place="bottom">Pope's Eſſay on Man, Epiſtle I. ver. 267.</note>;</l>
                  </q>
and ſeveral paſſages of Thomſon require a like
favourable conſtruction. But theſe writers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
that favour, by the ſublime manner in which
they celebrate the great Father of the Univerſe,
and by thoſe effuſions of love and gratitude,
which are inconſiſtent with the Materialiſt's Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem.
Virgil has no ſuch claim to our indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.
THE MIND of the UNIVERSE is rather a
Metaphyſical than a Theological Being. His
intellectual qualities are faintly diſtinguiſhed
from the Powers of Matter, and his moral At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes,
the ſource of all religious worſhip, form
no part of Virgil's creed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:0468400500:29"/>
Yet is this creed approved<note n="8" place="bottom">D. L. vol. I. p. 278.</note> by our Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
Prelate, as free from any mixture of Spino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziſm.
I congratulate his Lordſhip, on his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent
and moderate temper. His Brethren (I
mean thoſe of former times) had much ſharper
eyes for ſpying out a latent Hereſy. Yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
eaſily perſuade myſelf, that Virgil's notions
were ever the creed of a religious Society, like
that of the Myſteries. Luckily, indeed, I have
no occaſion to perſuade myſelf of it; unleſs I
ſhould prefer his Lordſhip's mere authority to
the voice of Antiquity, which aſſures me, that
this Syſtem was either invented or imported into
Greece by Pythagoras; from the writings of
whoſe diſciples Virgil might ſo very naturally
borrow it.</p>
               <p>Anchiſes then proceeds to inform his ſon, that
the ſouls both of men and of animals were of
celeſtial origin, and (as I underſtand him) parts
of the Univerſal Mind; but that by their union
with earthly bodies they contracted ſuch impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
as even Death could not purge away. Many
expiations, continues the venerable ſhade, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite,
before the ſoul, reſtored to its original
Simplicity, is capable of a place in Elyſium.
The far greater part are obliged to reviſit the
upper world, in other characters and in other
bodies; and thus by gradual ſteps to reaſcend
towards their firſt perfection.</p>

                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0468400500:30"/>
This moral Tranſmigration was undoubtedly
taught in the Myſteries. As the Biſhop aſſerts
this from the beſt authority, we are ſurprized at
a ſort of diffidence, unuſual to his Lordſhip,
when he advances things from his own intuitive
knowledge. In one place, this Tranſmigration
is part of the hidden Doctrine of Perfection<note n="9" place="bottom">D. L. vol. I. p. 279.</note>;
in another, it is one of thoſe principles, which
were promiſcuouſly communicated to all<note n="10" place="bottom">Idem, p. 142.</note>.
The truth ſeems to be, that his Lordſhip was
afraid to rank among the ſecrets of the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
what was profeſſed and believed by ſo many
Nations and Philoſophers. The pre-exiſtence of
the human ſoul is a very natural idea; and from
that idea ſpeculations and fables of its ſucceſſive
revolution through various bodies will ariſe.
From Japan to Egypt, the Tranſmigration has
been part of the popular and religious creed<note n="1" place="bottom">See our modern Relations of Japan, China, India, &amp;c. and for Egypt, Herodotus, l. ii.</note>.
Pythagoras<note n="2" place="bottom">Ovid. Metamorph. xv. 69, &amp;c. 158, &amp;c.</note> and Plato<note n="3" place="bottom">Plato in Phaedro &amp; in Republic. l. x.</note> have endeavoured
to demonſtrate the truth of it, by facts, as well
as by arguments.</p>
               <p>Of all theſe viſions (which ſhould have been
confined to the Poets) none is more pleaſing and
ſublime, than that which Virgil has invented.

the Ceremonies. With the aſſiſtance of Meur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius<note n="5" place="bottom">Meurſii Eleuſinia, five de Cereris Eleuſinae ſacro.</note>, he pours out a torrent of Erudition to
convince us, that the ſcenes thro' which Aeneas
paſſed in his deſcent to the Shades, were the
ſame as were repreſented to the Aſpirants in the
Celebration of the Eleuſinian Myſteries. From
thence, his Lordſhip draws his great concluſion,
That the Deſcent is no more than an emblem
of the Hero's Initiation.</p>
               <p>A ſtaunch Polemic will feed a diſpute, by
dwelling on every acceſſary circumſtance, whilſt
a candid Critic will confine himſelf to the more
eſſential points of it. I ſhall, therefore, readily
allow, what I believe may in general be true,
that the Myſteries exhibited a theatrical repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation
of all that was believed or imagined
of the lower world; that the Aſpirant was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
through the mimic ſcenes of Erebus, Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarus,
and Elyſium; and that a warm Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſt,
in deſcribing theſe awful Spectacles, might
expreſs himſelf as if he had actually viſited the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0468400500:32"/>
infernal Regions<note n="6" place="bottom">See D. L. vol. I. particularly p. 280.</note>. All this I can allow, and
yet allow nothing to the Biſhop of Glouceſter's
Hypotheſis. It is not ſurpriſing that the COPY
was like the ORIGINAL; but it ſtill remains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined,
WHETHER VIRGIL INTENDED TO
DESCRIBE THE ORIGINAL OR THE COPY.</p>
               <p>Lear and Garrick, when on the ſtage, are the
ſame; nor is it poſſible to diſtinguiſh the Player
from the Monarch. In the Green-room, or after
the repreſentation, we eaſily perceive, what the
warmth of fancy and the juſtneſs of imitation
had concealed from us. In the ſame manner it
is from extrinſical circumſtances, that we may
expect the diſcovery of Virgil's Allegory. Every
one of thoſe circumſtances perſuades me, that
Virgil deſcribed a real, not a mimic world, and
that the Scene lay in the Infernal Shades, and
not in the Temple of Ceres.</p>
               <p>The ſingularity of the Cumoean Shores muſt
be preſent to every traveller who has once ſeen
them. To a ſuperſtitious mind, the thin cruſt,
vaſt cavities, ſulphureous ſteams, poiſonous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations,
and fiery torrents, may ſeem to trace
out the narrow Confine of the two Worlds.
The lake Avernus was the chief object of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
horror; the black Woods which ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, when Virgil firſt came to Naples, were
perfectly ſuited to feed the ſuperſtition of the
People<note n="7" place="bottom">Strabo, l. v. p. 168.</note>. It was generally believed, that this
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0468400500:33"/>
deadly flood was the entrance of Hell<note n="8" place="bottom">Silius Italicus, l. xii.</note>; and
an Oracle was once eſtabliſhed on its banks,
which pretended, by magic rites, to call up the
departed Spirits<note n="9" place="bottom">Diod. Sicul. l. iv. p. 267. edit. Weſſeling.</note>. Aeneas, who revolved a
more daring enterpriſe, addreſſes himſelf to the
Prieſteſs of thoſe dark Regions. Their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
may perhaps inform us, whether an Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,
or a deſcent to the Shades, was the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of this enterprize. She endeavours to deter
the Hero, by ſetting before him all the dangers
of his raſh undertaking:
<q>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe particulars are abſolutely irreconcileable
with the idea of Initiation, but perfectly agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to that of a real deſcent. That every ſtep,
and every inſtant, may lead us to the grave is a
melancholy truth. The Myſteries were only
open at ſtated times, a few days at moſt in the
courſe of a year. The mimic deſcent of the
Myſteries was laborious and dangerous, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to light eaſy and certain. In real death,
this order is inverted:
<q>
                     <l>Pauci, quos aequus amavit</l>
                     <l>Jupiter, aut ardens evexit ad aethera virtus,</l>

Theſe Heroes, as we learn from the ſpeech of
Aeneas, were Hercules, Orpheus, Caſtor and
Pollux, Theſeus, and Pirithous. Of all theſe,
Antiquity believed, that before their death they
had ſeen the habitations of the dead; nor, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
will any of the circumſtances tally with a
ſuppoſed Initiation. The adventure of Eury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,
the alternate life of the brothers, and the
forcible intruſion of Alcides, Theſeus, and Piri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thous,
would mock the endeavours of the moſt

he has enriched this myſterious diſcovery
with many collateral arguments, which would
for ever have eſcaped all inferior Critics. In the
caſe of Hercules, for inſtance, he demonſtrates,
that the Initiation and the deſcent to the Shades
were the ſame thing, becauſe an Antient has

               <p>There is, however, a ſingle circumſtance, in
the narration of Virgil, which has juſtly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
Critics, unacquainted with any, but the

Virgil has borrowed, as uſual, from Homer,
his Epiſode of the Infernal Shades, and, as uſual,
has infinitely improved what the Grecian had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.
If, among a profuſion of beauties, I
durſt venture to point out the moſt ſtriking
beauties of the Sixth Book, I ſhould perhaps ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
1. That after accompanying the Hero
through the ſilent realms of Night and Chaos,
we ſee with aſtoniſhment and pleaſure a new Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
burſting upon us; 2. That we examine,
with a delight which ſprings from the love of
Virtue, the juſt empire of Minos; in which the
apparent irregularities of the preſent Syſtem are
corrected; where the Patriot who died for his
Country is happy, and the Tyrant who oppreſſed
it is miſerable. 3. As we intereſt ourſelves in
the Hero's fortunes, we ſhare his feelings: The
melancholy Palinurus, the wretched Deiphobus,
the indignant Dido; the Grecian Kings, who
tremble at his preſence, and the venerable An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſes,
who embraces his pious ſon, and diſplays
to his ſight the future glories of his race; all
theſe objects affects us with a variety of pleaſing
ſenſations.</p>
               <p>Let us for a moment obey the mandate of
our great Critic, and conſider theſe awful ſcenes
as a mimic ſhew, exhibited in the Temple of
Ceres, by the contrivance of the Prieſt, or, if he
pleaſes, of the Legiſlator. Whatever was ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
(I appeal to every reader of taſte), what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

               <p>The end of Philoſophy is Truth; the end of

which adds new beauties to the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;
I aſſiſt in perſuading myſelf, that it is juſt;
and could almoſt ſhew the ſame indulgence to
the Critic's as to the Poet's fiction. But ſhould
a grave Doctor lay out fourſcore pages, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
away the ſenſe and ſpirit of Virgil, I
ſhould have every inducement to believe, that
Virgil's ſoul was very different from the Doctor's.</p>

waited on his Lordſhip, through the
ſeveral ſtages of an intricate Hypotheſis. He
muſt now permit me to alledge two very ſimple
reaſons, which perſuade me, that Virgil has not
revealed the Secret of the Eleuſinian Myſteries;
the firſt is HIS IGNORANCE, and the ſecond HIS
DISCRETION.</p>
               <p n="1">I. As his Lordſhip has not made the ſmalleſt
attempt to prove that Virgil was himſelf ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0468400500:39"/>
it is plain that he ſuppoſed it, as a thing
of courſe. Had he any right to ſuppoſe it? By
no means: That ceremony might naturally
enough finiſh the education of a young Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian;
but a Barbarian, a Roman, would moſt
probably paſs through life without directing his
devotion to the foreign rites of Eleuſis.</p>
               <p>The Philoſophical ſentiments of Virgil were
ſtill more unlikely to inſpire him with that kind
of devotion. It is well known that he was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
Epicurean<note n="4" place="bottom">See the Life of Virgil by Donatus, the Sixth Eclogue, and the Second Georgic, ver. 490.</note>; and a very natural An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy
ſubſiſted between the Epicureans and the
Managers of the Myſteries. The Celebration
opened with a ſolemn excommunication of thoſe
Atheiſtical Philoſophers, who were commanded
to retire, and to leave that holy place for pious
Believers<note n="5" place="bottom">Lucian in Alexandro, p. 489.</note>; the zeal of the people was ready
to enforce this admonition. I will not deny, that
curioſity might ſometimes tempt an Epicurean
to pry into theſe ſecret rites; and that gratitude,
fear, or other motives, might engage the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians
to admit ſo irreligious an Aſpirant. Atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus
was initiated at Eleuſis; but Atticus was the
Friend and Benefactor of Athens<note n="6" place="bottom">Cornel. Nepos, in Vit Attici, c. 2, 3, 4.</note>. Theſe
extraordinary exceptions may be proved, but
muſt not be ſuppoſed.</p>

Nay, more; I am ſtrongly inclined to think
that Virgil was never out of Italy till the laſt
year of his life. I am ſenſible, that it is not eaſy
to prove a negative propoſition, more eſpecially
when the materials of our knowledge are ſo very
few and ſo very defective<note n="7" place="bottom">The Life of Virgil, attributed to Donatus, contains many characteriſtic particulars; but which are loſt in confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and diſgraced with a mixture of abſurd ſtories, ſuch as none but a Monk of the darker ages could either invent or believe. I always conſidered them as the interpolations of ſome more recent writer; and am confirmed in that opinion, by the life of Virgil, pure from thoſe additions, which Mr. Spence lately publiſhed, from a Florence MS. at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Mr. Holdſworth's valuable obſervations on Virgil.</note>; and yet by glanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our eye over the ſeveral periods of Virgil's
life, we may perhaps attain a ſort of probability,
which ought to have ſome weight, ſince nothing
can be thrown into the oppoſite ſcale.</p>
               <p>Altho' Virgil's father was hardly of a lower
rank than Horace's, yet the peculiar character of
the latter afforded his fon a much ſuperior edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:
Virgil did not enjoy the ſame opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
of obſerving mankind on the great The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre
of Rome, or of purſuing Philoſophy, in her
favourite ſhades of the Academy.<q>

                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0468400500:41"/>
The ſphere of Virgil's education did not extend
beyond Mantua, Cremona, Milan and Naples<note n="9" place="bottom">Donat. in Virgil.</note>.</p>
               <p>After the accidents of civil war had introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Virgil to the knowledge of the Great, he
paſſed a few years at Rome, in a ſtate of depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
the JUVENUM NOBILIUM CLIENS<note n="10" place="bottom">Horat l. IV. od. xii.</note>.
It was during that time that he compoſed his
Eclogues, the haſty productions of a Muſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of far greater things<note n="1" place="bottom">Donat. in Virgil.</note>.</p>
               <p>By the liberality of Auguſtus and his cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
Virgil ſoon became poſſeſſed of an affluent
fortune<note n="2" place="bottom">Prope <hi>Centies Seſtertium,</hi> about eighty thouſand pounds.</note>. He compoſed the Georgics and
the Aeneid, in his elegant Villas of Campania
and Sicily; and ſeldom quitted thoſe pleaſing
retreats even to come to Rome<note n="3" place="bottom">Donat. in Virgil.</note>.</p>
               <p>After he had finiſhed the Aeneid, he reſolved
on a journey into Greece and Aſia, to employ
three years in reviſing and perfecting that Poem,
and to devote the remainder of his life to the
ſtudy of Philoſophy<note n="4" place="bottom">Id. ibid.</note>. He was at Athens,
with Auguſtus, in the ſummer of AVC 735;
and whilſt Auguſtus was at Athens, the Eleuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian
Myſteries were celebrated<note n="5" place="bottom">They always began the fifteenth of the Attic month Boedromion, and laſted nine days. Thoſe who take the trouble of calculating the Athenian Calendar, on the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples laid down by Mr. Dodwell (de Cyclis Antiquis) and by Dr. Halley, will find, that A V C. Varr. 735, the 15th of Boedromion coincided with the 24th of Auguſt of the Julian year. But if we may believe Dion Caſſius, the Celebration was this year anticipated, on account of Auguſtus and the Indian Philoſopher. L. LIV. p. 739. edit. Reimar.</note>. It is not
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0468400500:42"/>
impoſſible, that Virgil might then be initiated,
as well as the Indian Philoſopher<note n="6" place="bottom">Strabo, l. xv. p. 720.</note>; but the
Aeneid could receive no improvement from his
newly-acquired knowledge. He was taken ill
at Megara. The journey encreaſed his diſorder,
and he expired at Brunduſium, the twenty-ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
of September of the ſame year 735<note n="7" place="bottom">Donat. in Virgil.</note>.</p>
               <p>Should it then appear probable, that Virgil
had no opportunity of learning the SECRET of
the Myſteries, it will be ſomething more than
probable, that he has not revealed what he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

without making a Journey to Athens: ſince
thoſe Myſteries had been brought to Rome long
before<note n="8" place="bottom">D. L. vol. I. p. 188.</note>. Here indeed I ſhould be apt to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
ſome miſtake, or, at leaſt, a want of preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

and Caſaubon<note n="10" place="bottom">Caſaubon ad Scriptor. Hiſt. Auguſt. p. 25.</note>, men tolerably verſed in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,
aſſure me, that indeed ſome Grecian
Ceremonies of Ceres had been practiſed at Rome
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0468400500:43"/>
from the earlieſt Ages; but that the Myſteries
of Eleuſis were never introduced into that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital,
either by the Emperor Hadrian, or by
any other: And I am the more induced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that theſe rites were not imported in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil's
time, as the accurate Suetonius ſpeaks of
an unſucceſsful attempt for that purpoſe, made
by the Emperor Claudius, above threeſcore years
after Virgil's death<note n="1" place="bottom">Sueton. in Claud. c. 25.</note>.</p>

I ſincerely acquit the Biſhop of Gloceſter of any

               <p>An Apology! an Allegory! Such artifices

               <p>Theſe lines belong to an Ode of Horace,

That Death in our Country's cauſe is pleaſant

the Myſteries of Ceres ought not to be diſcloſed,
are ideas which have no apparent connection.

An inſufficient Apology for the few, who dare
judge from their own feelings. I ſhall not deny,
that the irregular notes of an untutored Muſe
have ſometimes delighted me. We can very
ſeldom be diſpleaſed with the unconſtrained
workings of Nature. But the Liberty of an Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law

ſole maſter of the Roman World in the year
724; but it was not till the year 729, that,
having changed the civil adminiſtration, and
pacified the Weſtern provinces, he had leiſure
to turn his Views towards the Eaſt. From that
time, Horace, in compliance with the Public

to revenge the manes of Craſſus<note n="10" place="bottom">Horat. l. I. od. ii. L. III. od. v. L. II. ſerm. i. v. 15, &amp;c.</note>. The
cautious Policy of Auguſtus, ſtill averſe to war,

               <p>To reſume my Idea, which depended on this
long deduction of Circumſtances; when Horace
compoſed the ſecond ode of his third Book, the
Aeneid, and particularly the Sixth Book, were
already known to the Public. The deteſtation
of the Wretch who reveals the Myſteries of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,
though expreſſed in general terms, muſt
be applied by all Rome to the author of the
Sixth Book of the Aeneid. Can we ſeriouſly
ſuppoſe, THAT HORACE WOULD HAVE BRANDED
WITH SUCH WANT ON IN FAMY, ONE OF THE MEN
IN THE WORLD WHOM HE LOVED AND HONOURED
THE MOST<note n="6" place="bottom">Horat. l. I. od. iii. L. I. ſerm. v. ver. 39, &amp;c.</note>?</p>

                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0468400500:50"/>
Nothing remains to ſay, except that Horace
was himſelf ignorant of his friend's allegorical
meaning, which the Biſhop of Gloceſter has
ſince revealed to the World. It may be ſo;
yet, for my own part, I ſhould be very well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with underſtanding Virgil no better than
Horace did.</p>
               <p>It is perhaps ſome ſuch fooliſh fondneſs for
Antiquity, which inclines me to doubt, whether
the BISHOP OF GLOCESTER has really united
the ſevere ſenſe of ARISTOTLE with the ſublime
imagination of LONGINUS. Yet a judicious
Critic, (who is now, I believe, ARCHDEACON
OF GLOCESTER) aſſures the Public, that his
Patron's mere amuſements have done much
more than the joint labours of the two Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians.
I ſhall conclude theſe obſervations with
a remarkable paſſage from the Archdeacon's
Dedication<note n="7" place="bottom">See the Dedication of Horace's Epiſtle to Auguſtus, with an Engliſh Commentary and Notes.</note>: <q rend="inline">It was not enough, in YOUR
ENLARGED VIEW OF THINGS, to reſtore
either of theſe models (ARISTOTLE or LON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GINUS)
to their original ſplendor. They were
both to be revived; or rather A NEW ORI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GINAL
PLAN OF CRITICISM to be ſtruck
out, WHICH SHOULD UNITE THE VIRTUES OF
EACH OF THEM. This Experiment was
made on the two greateſt of our own Poets
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0468400500:51"/>
(Shakeſpeare and Pope), and by reflecting all
the LIGHTS OF THE IMAGINATION ON THE
SEVEREST REASON, every thing was affected
which the warmeſt admirer of antient art
could promiſe himſelf from ſuch a union.
BUT YOU WENT FARTHER: By joining to

            <p>I WAS not ignorant, that, ſeveral years
ſince, the Rev. Dr. Jortin had favoured
the Public, with a DISSERTATION ON THE
STATE OF THE DEAD, AS DESCRIBED BY HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MER
AND VIRGIL<note n="1" place="bottom">Six Diſſertations on Different Subjects, publiſhed in a Volume in Octavo, in the year 1755, It is the Sixth Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertation, p. 207-324.</note>: But the Book is now
grown ſo ſcarce, that I was not able to procure
a ſight of it till after theſe Papers had been
already ſent to the preſs. I found Dr. Jortin's
performance, as I expected, moderate, learned,
and critical. Among a variety of ingenious
obſervations, there are two or three which are
very cloſely connected with my preſent ſubject.</p>
            <p>I had paſſed over in ſilence one argument of
the Biſhop of Gloceſter, or rather of Scarron
and the Biſhop of Gloceſter; ſince the former
found the Remark, and the latter furniſhed the
Inference.
<q>Diſcite juſtitiam moniti, &amp; non temnere Divos,</q>
cries the unfortunate Phlegyas. In the midſt
of his torments, he preaches Juſtice and Piety,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0468400500:53"/>
like Ixion in Pindar. A very uſeful piece of
advice, ſays the French Buffoon, for thoſe who
were already damned to all Eternity:
<q>
                  <l>Cette ſentence eſt bonne &amp; belle:</l>
                  <l>Mais en enfer, de quoi ſert elle?</l>
               </q>
From this judicious piece of Criticiſm his
Lordſhip argues, that Phlegyas was preaching
not to the Dead, but to the Living; and that
Virgil is only deſcribing the Mimic Tartarus,
which was exhibited at Eleuſis for the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Initiated.</p>
            <p>I ſhall tranſcribe one or two of the reaſons,
which Dr. Jortin condeſcends to oppoſe to Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron's
Criticiſm.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">
                  <p>To preach to the Damned, ſays he, is la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
in vain. And what if it is? It might
be part of his puniſhment, to exhort himſelf
and others, when exhortations were too late.
This admonition, as far as it relates to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and his companions in miſery, is to be
looked upon not ſo much as an admonition
to amend, but as a bitter ſarcaſm, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
of paſt iniquities.</p>
                  <p>It is labour in vain. But in the poetical
ſyſtem, it ſeems to have been the occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Damned to labour in vain, to
catch at meat and drink that fled from
them, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:0468400500:54"/>
His inſtruction, like that of Ixion in
Pindar, might be for the uſe of the living.
You will ſay, <hi>how can that be?</hi> Surely no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more eaſy and intelligible. The
Muſes hear him—The Muſes reveal it to
the Poet, and the inſpired Poet reveals it
to mankind. And ſo much for Phlegyas
and Monſieur Scarron.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>It is prettily obſerved by Dr. Jortin, <q rend="inline">That
Virgil, after having ſhone out with full ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
through the Sixth Book, ſets at laſt in a
cloud.</q> The IVORY GATE puzzles every
Commentator, and grieves every lover of Virgil:
Yet it affords no advantages to the Biſhop of
Gloceſter. The objection preſſes as hard on
the notion of an Initiation, as on that of a real
Deſcent to the Shades. <q rend="inline">The troubleſome
concluſion ſtill remains as it was; and from
the manner in which the Hero is diſmiſſed
after the Ceremonies, we learn, that in thoſe
Initiations, the Machinery, and the whole
Shew, was (in the Poet's opinion) a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation
of things, which had no truth or
reality.</q>
               <q>
                  <l>Altera candenti perfecta nitens elephanto:</l>
                  <l>Sed <hi>FALSA</hi> ad coelum mittunt <hi>INSOMNIA</hi> manes.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">Dreams in general, may be called <hi>vain</hi> and
<hi>deceitful, ſomnia vana,</hi> or <hi>ſomnia falſa,</hi> if
you will, as they are oppoſed to the <hi>real</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:0468400500:55"/>
objects, which preſent themſelves to us when
we are awake. But when <hi>falſe</hi> dreams are
oppoſed to <hi>true</hi> ones, there the Epithet <hi>falſa</hi>
has another meaning. True dreams repreſent
what is real, and ſhew what is true; falſe
dreams repreſent things, which are not, or
which are not true. Thus Homer and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,
and many other poets, and indeed the
nature of the thing, diſtinguiſh them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Dr. Jortin, though with reluctance, acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſces
in the common opinion, that by ſix un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky
lines, Virgil is deſtroying the beautiful
Syſtem, which it had coſt him eight hundred
to raiſe. He explains too this prepoſterous
conduct, by the uſual expedient of the Poet's
Epicureiſm. I only differ from him in attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting
to haſte and indiſcretion, what he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
as the reſult of deſign.</p>
            <p>Another reaſon, both new and ingenious, is
aſſigned by Dr. Jortin, for Virgil explaining
away his Hero's deſcent into an idle dream.
<q rend="inline">All communication with the Dead, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal
powers, &amp;c. belonged to the Art
Magic, and Magic was held in abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by the Romans.</q> Yet if it was held in
ABOMINATION, it was ſuppoſed to be real. A
writer would not have made his court to James
the firſt, by repreſenting the ſtories of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft
as the Phantoms of an over-heated Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0468400500:56"/>
Whilſt I am writing, a ſudden thought oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs
to me, which, rude and imperfect as it is,
I ſhall venture to throw out to the Public. It
is this. After Virgil, in imitation of Homer,
had deſcribed the two Gates of Sleep, the Horn
and the Ivory, he again takes up the firſt in a
different ſenſe:
<q>QUA VERIS FACILIS DATUR EXITUS UMBRIS.</q>
The TRUE SHADES, VERAE UMBRAE, were thoſe
airy forms which were continually ſent to animate
new bodies, ſuch light and almoſt immaterial
Natures as could without difficulty paſs through
a thin tranſparent ſubſtance. In this new ſenſe,
Aeneas and the Sybill, who were ſtill incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered
with a load of fleſh, could not pretend to
the prerogative of TRUE SHADES. In their
paſſage over Styx, they had almoſt ſunk Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron's
boat.<q>
                  <l>Gemuit ſub pondere cymba</l>
                  <l>Sutilis, &amp; multam accepit rimoſa paludem.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Some other Expedient was requiſite for their
return; and ſince the Horn Gate would not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
them an eaſy diſmiſſion, the other paſſage,
which was adorned with poliſhed Ivory, was
the only one that remained either for them, or
for the Poet.</p>
            <p>By this explanation, we ſave Virgil's judge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment
and religion, though I muſt own, at the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0468400500:57"/>
expence of an uncommon harſhneſs and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity
of expreſſion. Let it only be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered,
that thoſe, who, in deſperate caſes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
with modeſty, have a right to be heard
with indulgence.</p>
