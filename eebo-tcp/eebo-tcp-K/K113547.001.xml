            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>MY Bookſeller having informed me that there was no collection of Engliſh Poetry among us, of any eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I thought a few Hours ſpent in making a proper ſelection would not be ill beſtowed. Compilations of this kind are chiefly deſigned for ſuch as either want leiſure, ſkill, or fortune, to chooſe for themſelves; for perſons whoſe profeſſions turn them to different purſuits, or who, not yet arrived at ſufficient maturity, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a guide to direct their application. To our youth, particularly, a publication
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0531100301:3"/>
of this ſort may be uſeful; ſince, if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled with any ſhare of judgement, it may at once unite precept and example, ſhew them what is beautiful, and inform them why it is ſo: I therefore offer this, to the beſt of my judgement, as the beſt collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that has yet appeared: though, as taſtes are various, numbers will be of a very different opinion. Many perhaps may wiſh to ſee in it the poems of their favourite Authors, others may wiſh that I had ſelected from works leſs generally read, and others ſtill may wiſh, that I had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from their own. But my deſign was to give a uſeful, unaffected compila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; one that might tend to advance the reader's taſte, and not impreſs him with exalted ideas of mine. Nothing ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and yet ſo abſurd, as affectation in criticiſm. The deſire of being thought to
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0531100301:4"/>
have a more diſcerning taſte than others, has often led writers to labour after error, and to be foremoſt in promoting deformity. In this compilation I run but few riſques of that kind; every poem here is well known, and poſſeſſed, or the public has been long miſtaken, of peculiar merit: every poem has, as Ariſtotle expreſſes it, a beginning, a middle, and an end, in which, however trifling the rule may ſeem, moſt of the poetry in our language is deficient: I claim no merit in the choice, as it was obvious, for in all languages the beſt productions are moſt eaſily found. As to the ſhort introductory criticiſms to each poem, they are rather deſigned for boys than men; for it will be ſeen that I declined all refinement, ſatisfied with being obvious and ſincere. In ſhort, if this work be uſeful in ſchools, or amuſing in
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0531100301:5"/>
the cloſet, the merit all belongs to others; I have nothing to boaſt, and, at beſt, can expect, not applauſe, but pardon.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>This ſeems to be Mr. Pope's moſt finiſhed produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and is, perhaps, the moſt perfect in our language. It exhibits ſtronger powers of imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, more harmony of numbers, and a greater knowledge of the world, than any other of this poet's works: and it is probable, if our country were called upon to ſhew a ſpecimen of their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius to foreigners, this would be the work here fixed upon.</p>

            <head>AN ELEGY, Written in a Country Church Yard.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>This is a very fine poem, but overloaded with epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thet. The heroic meaſure with alternate rhime is very properly adapted to the ſolemnity of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as it is the ſloweſt movement that our language admits of.

            <argument>
               <p>Few poems have done more honour to Engliſh ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius than this. There is in it a ſtrain of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical thinking that was, at that time, new in our poetry.

            <argument>
               <p>The ſeverity of this ſatire, and the excellence of its verſification, give it a diſtinguiſhed rank in this ſpecies of compoſition. At preſent, an ordinary reader would ſcarce ſuppoſe that Shadwell, who is here meant by Mac Flecknoe, was worth being chaſtiſed, and that Dryden's deſcending to ſuch game was like an eagle's ſtooping to catch flies. The truth, however, is, Shadwell, at one time, held divided reputation with this great poet. Every age produces its faſhionable dunces, who, by following the tranſient topic, or humour, of the day, ſupply talkative ignorance with materials for converſation.</p>
            </argument>
            <l>ALL human things are ſubject to decay,</l>

            <l>In proſe and verſe was own'd, without diſpute,</l>
            <l>Through all the realms of Nonſenſe, abſolute.</l>

            <argument>
               <p>Here follows one of the beſt verſified poems in our language, and the moſt maſterly produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its author. The ſeverity with which Walpole is here treated, was in conſequence of that miniſter's having refuſed to provide for Swift in England, when applied to for that purpoſe in the year 1725 (if I remember right). The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of a poet, however, gave Walpole very little uneaſineſs. A man whoſe ſchemes, like this miniſter's, ſeldom extended beyond the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of the year, but little regarded the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of poſterity.</p>

He was ſuſpected of joining in a conveyance with Sir John Blunt, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete 50,000l. of that director's eſtate, forfeited to the South-Sea company by act of parliament. The company recovered the 50,000 l. againſt Ward; but he ſet up prior conveyances of his real eſtate to his brother and ſon, and concealed all his perſonal, which was computed to be 150,000 l. Theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances being alſo ſet aſide by a bill in Chancery, Ward was impriſoned, and hazarded the forfeiture of his life by not giving in his effects till the laſt day, which was that of his examination. During his confinement, his amuſement was to give poiſon to dogs and cats, and ſee them expire by flower or quicker torments. To ſum up the worth of this gentleman at the ſeveral aera's of his life; at his ſtanding in the pillory he was worth above 200,000 l. at his commitment to priſon he was worth 150,000 l. but has ſince been ſo far diminiſhed in his reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as to be thought a worſe man by 50 or 60,000 l.</p>
                     <p>Fr. Chartres, a man infamous for all manner of vice. When he was an enſign in the army, he was drummed out of the regiment for a cheat: he was next baniſhed Bruſſels, and drummed out of Ghent on the ſame account. After a hundred tricks at the gaming tables, he took to lending of money at exorbitant intereſt, and on great penalties, accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulating praemium, intereſt, and capital, into a new capital, and ſeizing, to a minute, when the payments became due. In a word, by a conſtant attention to the vices, wants, and follies of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, he acquired an immenſe fortune. His houſe was a perpetual bawdy-houſe. He was twice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for rapes, and pardoned; but, the laſt time, not without impriſonment in Newgate, and large confiſcations. He died in Scotland in 1731, aged 62. The populace, at his funeral, raiſed a great riot, almoſt tore the body out of the coffin, and caſt dead dogs, &amp;c. into the grave along with it.

            <argument>
               <p>The following eclogues, written by Mr. Collins, are very pretty: the images, it muſt be owned, are not very local; for the paſtoral ſubject could not well admit of it. The deſcription of Aſiatic mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, and manners, is a ſubject as yet unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted amongſt us, and, I believe, capable of furniſhing a great variety of poetical imagery.</p>
            </argument>
            <l>YE Perſian maids, attend your poet's lays,</l>

            <l>For you thoſe flowers her fragrant hands beſtow,</l>
            <l>And yours the love that kings delight to know.</l>
            <l>Yet think not theſe, all-beauteous as they are,</l>
            <l>The beſt kind bleſſings Heaven can grant the fair!</l>
