            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> AM not ignorant, that <hi>as Times and the Humour of People go,</hi> it is a bold Adventure to write a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Volume of any thing; nor is the Succeſs of a Firſt Part any Rule to expect Succeſs to a Second. On the Contrary, it is rather a Rule to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct it. The modern Readers of Books ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a general Opinion <hi>which they entertain, like a fundamental Principle in Reading,</hi> That Second Parts never come up to the Spirit of the Firſt; tho' perhaps here they may find an Exception to that Rule.</p>
            <p>This was the Fate of that excellent Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em of Mr. <hi>Milton<hi>'s, call'd, <hi>Paradiſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain'd;</hi> which, whether by the Error of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Fame, or the real Value of the Thing, could never obtain to be nam'd with <hi>the Firſt.</hi>
                  </hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:1032900302:3"/>
Mr. <hi>Milton</hi> himſelf differ'd from the whole World in his Opinion about it, affirm'd that it was by much the better Poem, and gave this Reaſon for the general Diſlike, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That People had a common Senſe of the Loſs of Paradiſe, but had not an equal Guſt for the Regaining of it; but his Judgment, however good, could not prevail.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſay but little of the Reaſon why People may like or diſlike the preſent Work. The firſt Part of it gives the Story of Two very bad Wives; it would be ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly fooliſh and unjuſt, to take Exceptions at my repreſenting the Women ſo bad, as if I was partial againſt the Sex; but becauſe ſome may be weak enough to do ſo, for want of underſtanding the Connexion of the Story, ſuch are deſir'd to obſerve the clear Reaſon of it, as follows.</p>
            <p>The Reproof is upon Husbands for omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Family Worſhip, and pretending the Fault is in their Wives; it was abſolutely neceſſary then to repreſent Two Wives ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitably bad, eminent for their Oppoſition to every thing that was good in their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, and in a Word, extravagantly wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to ſhew that even in theſe extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Caſes, the Husband ought not to omit his Duty, and to infer, that if not in theſe Caſes, certainly not in Caſes leſs difficult, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1032900302:4"/>
in no Caſe at all. This is the true and only Reaſon of bringing Two ſuch bad Wives upon the Stage, as is alſo obſerv'd at large by Way of Note, upon that Part afterward, to which I refer.</p>
            <p>If Novelty had only recomended the Firſt Part, then indeed we might ſuggeſt, that the Thoughts of People being once entertain'd, could no more be pleas'd again with the ſame Scheme: But this can no way affect us here; for if Novelty, <hi>the modern Vice of the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Palate,</hi> is to jugde of our Performance, the whole Scene now preſented, is ſo perfectly new, ſo entirely differing from all that went before, and ſo eminently directed to another Species of Readers, that it ſeems to be more new than it would have been, if no other Part had been publiſh'd before it; nay, to any conſidering People that reflect upon the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Scenes of Human Life, and the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Stations we are plac'd in, and Parts we act, while we are paſſing over this Stage; it cannot but be known, that there are Follies to be expoſed, Dangers to be caution'd againſt, and Advices to be given, particularly adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſeveral Stages of Life.</p>
            <p>Upon this Account, inſtead of ſuggeſting that a Second Volume of this Work ſhould be leſs neceſſary than the Firſt, I cannot but think they would either of them be imperfect
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1032900302:5"/>
without the other; and if the <hi>Turkiſh Spy,</hi> and ſuch other Books, from the known Varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of them, have pleaſed and diverted the World, even to the Seventh or Eight Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume: If this Subject is leſs pleaſing, and fails of running the ſame Length with thoſe looſer Works, it muſt be becauſe People have leſs Pleaſure in Things that are inſtructing, than in Things merely humouring and divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; leſs Patience in bearing a juſt Reproof, and leſs Humility in applying it to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves than they ought to have.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſs there are Duties in our relative Stations of every Sort, one to another, Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties from Parents to Children, and from Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to Servants, as well as from Children to Parents, and from Servants to Maſters; and it muſt be own'd by all that look narrowly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe Things, that as on the one hand there are great Miſtakes committed in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of themſelves and their Families, by Parents and Maſters, ſo there is perhaps leſs ſaid upon theſe neceſſary Heads in publick than upon any other; even the beſt Writers upon the Relative Duties, have ſeemed to be wholly ſilent upon this Subject: whether they did not ſee into the Want of it, or thought it was a Point ſo nice, that their Readers could not bear, or what other Thing has been the Hindrance, I know not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:1032900302:6"/>
Correction! the moſt neceſſary Part of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily-Government, and the beſt Part of Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, how difficult a Thing is it! How lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle underſtood! How generally wrong apply'd! Omitted in neceſſary, and adminiſtred in unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Caſes! The Nature, Reaſon, and End of it miſtaken! the Meaſure of it taken not from the Circumſtances of the Childrens Offences, but from our own Tempers at that Time! How is it mingled with our Paſſions, and ſmother'd by our Affections, and in either Caſe the Uſe of it entirely deſtroy'd! and what Advantage, to get above Correction, do Children make of the Miſtakes of their Parents in correcting them!</p>
            <p>Miſtaken Parents may here be ſet to rights in ſome of the moſt dangerous Parts of that difficult Duty of correcting their Children: Here will be ſhewn how inconſiſtent it is with the great and weighty Office of a Parent to conceal the Paſſions in their Rebukes, or to let their want of Temper add to the Weight of their Hands: Here they will be inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in what Frame they ought to be when they Correct, and from what Principle their Hands muſt be lifted up to ſtrike their own Fleſh and Blood: How they are to exhort, inſtruct, expoſtulate, perſwade, with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Teſtimonies of Affection, all the while
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1032900302:7"/>
they are correcting: How inconſiſtent with correcting a Child, the Noiſe, the Rage, the Fury of our Paſſions are; and how often the true Parent corrects with more Tears in his own Eyes, than he brings out of the Eyes of the Child he chaſtiſes; and yet here he will ſee that this Tenderneſs muſt not be permitted, to prevent or withold that wholſom Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which Duty to the Child calls for, and which, if it be with-held, deſtroys the Force of every other Part of his Education.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſay nothing more of what is here publiſhed, but this: The ſame Deſire of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Good, which mov'd the Firſt Part, has been ſincerely and principally the Occaſion of writing this Part. With all poſſible Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Thankfulneſs, I acknowledge and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I have had the ſame Preſence and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance; and I cannot but hope for the ſame Bleſſing and Succeſs; and with the Comfort and Confidence of this, I chearfully ſend it into the World, not concern'd at all at the Oppoſition it ſhall meet with from the Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and Unworthineſs of its Author.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS Diſcourſe is too much of Hiſtory, and was occaſioned by an unhappy Quarrel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Man and his Wife, both ſober religious Perſons, about their religious Conduct in their Family.</p>
               <p>The Husband provok'd by ſome raſh Words of his Wife's, and eſpecially by her ſpeaking ſlightingly of his performing Family-Worſhip, takes the worſt Method in the World with himſelf, fling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away in a Paſſion, without calling his Reaſon and Conſcience of Duty to his Aſſiſtance, and goes A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, having not called his Family together to Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Prayer, as was before his conſtant Practice; and being gotten into a Field near his Houſe, when he had the Advantage of converſing with himſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being heard; his Paſſion being not much abated,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1032900302:9"/>
you may ſuppoſe, he fell to reaſoning himſelf <hi>out of</hi> his Duty, inſtead of <hi>into it,</hi> and to forming Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to juſtify his laying aſide the Thoughts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming it for the future.</p>
               <p>What can I do, <hi>ſays he,</hi> when a Woman is arriv'd to ſuch a height as to make a Mock of me in my own Family? She has brought Things to ſuch a paſs, that I do not think it is my Duty to pray among them any more; ſhe openly told me, <hi>before my Children,</hi> that I need not give my ſelf the Trouble to keep up the Ceremony; that they none of them value it; that they hate the Offering for the ſake of the Prieſt; and that they care not to join with me, they can ſerve God to more Purpoſe without me. <hi>Why,</hi> I don't think it is my Duty; certainly God does not expect I ſhould worſhip him in ſuch Company; I am not to caſt my Pearls before Swine: Beſides, where there is no Charity, no Unity, what ſignifies Duty? what Worſhip can there be, that can be acceptable to God or comfortable to me? I'll trouble my ſelf no more about them; and as to its being my Duty, I think I am fairly diſcharged of it; at her Door be the Sin, who has been the Cauſe of it; as I am not the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Breach, ſo neither will the Conſequence lie at my Door; I'll perform my Duty by my ſelf, and let them take their own Courſe.</p>
               <p>With this kind of Diſcourſe he ſatisfied himſelf for the preſent; the Devil, no doubt, aſſiſting; and coming home to his Family, took no Notice at the uſual Time of Family-Worſhip, but went unconcerned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Buſineſs; ſat down to Dinner at the Time of it, and at Night ſtay'd abroad till it was time to go to Supper.</p>
               <p>After Supper, his Wife, (who kept up her Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as high as he) calls her Maid to bring her a Candle, and away ſhe goes to Bed, taking no No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of him, or of the uſual Family-Order.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:1032900302:10"/>
It was a little unnatural to him, <hi>as it had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual</hi> to cloſe the Day thus, without either his Duty to God, or any Society with his Wife; And, <hi>as he ſaid afterwards,</hi> had ſhe ſpoken but one kind Word to him, or given him but a ſociable Look, he had forgot all, and gone on again in his Duty, as he uſed to have done: But ſhe unwarily and imprudently prompting his Diſguſt, and throwing Oil inſtead of Water into the Fire, enrag'd him again, and aſſiſted the Temptation, to confirm him in the wicked Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of neglecting of his Duty.</p>
               <p>The Breach was now made, and every thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to make it wider: The Man went to Bed ſome time after; but as ſhe was aſleep when he came to Bed, ſo he was aſleep when ſhe roſe, and they had no Interval or Opportunity of Converſation to allay their Heat, or bring them together: Thus they went on with their Diſcontent, and continued two or three Days hardly in ſpeaking Terms one with another; during which time, as there was no Reconciliation of their fooliſh Breach, ſo it may eaſily be ſuppoſed there was no complyance with one another in the Matter of religious Duty: But the Family Orders dropp'd, and Religion ſeem'd wholly laid aſide; and that which was ſtill worſe, the Diſorders of their Minds was ſo great, that it broke in upon their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Duties, as well as their publick, and one was neglected as well as the other. Indeed it might have been concluded, that had either of them retired to their private Duties; had they gone into their Cloſet and look'd up for Direction what to do, the ſecret Ejaculation would have ſtrongly moved them to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Frame, and ſoon have returned them to their Duty, and reſtored them to one another.</p>
               <p>A little time it is true, reſtor'd them to better Terms of Living together, the paſſionate Part cool'd again, and they converſed a little more

               <p>It was to be obſerved, that as they had now <hi>as it were</hi> lay'd aſide their Family-Worſhip, ſo in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing, their Family Peace vaniſhed; they were continually quarrelling, and falling out with one another; their Humours joſtled in every Trifle, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding one another's Sincerity, Affection, Integrity, on every little Occaſion; reproaching the leaſt Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage, reviling one another with Bitterneſs, and forgetting nothing that might tend to make them diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable to one another; peeviſh, waſpiſh and fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, even when they agreed beſt, and ſcandalouſly furious, and hot when they fell out.</p>

It happen'd once, that a Diſcourſe began between the Father and Mother about the Eclipſe of the Sun, which fell out in <hi>April</hi> 22. 1715.</p>
               <p>The Eclipſe of the Sun was the Subject of all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation at that time, having been, as is well known, ſo Total, and the Darkneſs ſo great, as that the like had not been known in that Age, or ſome hundreds of Years before.</p>
               <p>The Wife had enquired of her Husband, what the Nature of the Thing was, and he was deſcribing it to her and the Children in a familiar way; and, as I ſaid, that a kind of Reflection upon one another was the uſual Iſſue of their common Diſcourſe, ſo it was there; the Husband tells her, that the Moon was like a croſs Wife, that when ſhe was out of Humour, could Thwart and Eclipſe her Husband whenever ſhe pleaſed; and that if an ill Wife ſtood in the Way, the brighteſt Husband could not ſhine.</p>
               <p>She flew in a Paſſion at this, and being of a ſharp Wit, you do well, <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> to carry your Emblem to a ſuitable height; <hi>I warrant,</hi> you think a Wife, like the Moon, has no Light but what ſhe borrows from her Husband, and that we can only ſhine by Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; it is neceſſary then you ſhould know, ſhe can Eclipſe him when ſhe pleaſes.</p>

               <p>All this while here was no Abatement on one ſide or other, and both of them dreadfully miſtaken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their Duty; they wrangl'd thus upon every Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and this laſt Dialogue is only given as a Skerch of their almoſt daily Converſation: Their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication was poiſon'd by the Breach in their Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and like the ſweet Dews which falling into the Sea, become Salt like the Ocean; ſo the moſt caſual innocent Diſcourſe between them, generally iſſued in a Broil: yet none of theſe Diſcourſes brought them together, as they might have done; or convinc'd them that both were in the Wrong, ſo as to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd a Return to their Duty, or at leaſt a Truce, that they might not have let their Contention have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred their religious Performance. But Paſſion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing, they continued in a dreadful Courſe of Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion, and reſtraining Prayer before God.</p>
               <p>It was alſo obſervable, that while thus they laid aſide the Appearance of Religion in their Families,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1032900302:15"/>
it abated in the reſt of their Converſation, and they grew entirely careleſs, living as it were without God in the World; the Decay of Family-Worſhip, like a Gan-green in the religious Body, ſpread it ſelf from one Limb to another, till it affected the Vitals, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved mortal. In a word, it deſtroyed the Senſe of Duty and Religion in their whole Lives.</p>
               <p>And as Sin entred in by this Breach, ſo it made way for every other Breach; which made them more and more peeviſh, waſpiſh, apt to quarrel and ſnarle at the leaſt Occaſion; removed all that Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Converſation and Harmony of Affection that was between them before, and the Houſe became deſtitute, not of Religion only, but of every pleaſant thing.</p>
               <p>It happen'd ſome time after this, that this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had an intimate Friend, who liv'd Thirty or Forty Miles off in the Country, who had likewiſe a Wife that had brought him almoſt into the ſame Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, tho' from a differing Occaſion; for ſhe was a profane, irreligious, and negligent Perſon, as to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, from her Original; by Education a Mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Deſpiſer of all that was Good, and one who did her utmoſt to diſcourage her Husband, who was a good Man, from all his Meaſures in the religious Government of himſelf, or of his Family.</p>
               <p>He had had a great Quarrel with his Wife about her Conduct, and her reproaching him for doing his Duty; and ſhe had ſaid ſome ſuch ſhocking Things to him, that almoſt conquer'd his Reſolutions in the Matter of his Duty; almoſt the ſame Temptation of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to him, as had been the Caſe of the other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon mentioned before: For a while, this good Man began to waver in his Reſolution; but his Senſe of Duty return'd upon him too ſtrongly to be reſiſted, and he maſter'd all the Difficulties that were before him; reſolv'd, that let Satan and a perverſe Woman
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1032900302:16"/>
do their utmoſt, he would not live without the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Service of God in his Houſe: And ſo he went on with his Duty in ſpight of all his Wife's Clamour, made his whole Houſe ſubmit to it, and condemn her for oppoſing it, as we ſhall hear more particularly preſently.</p>
               <p>This good Man coming to Town, and meeting with his old Friend, of whom we have been ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and both being intimate Chriſtians as well as Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, it was not long before they began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe about religious Affairs, as well as Things uſual in common Diſcourſe; both being alſo too full of their reſpective Family Grievances, to be long toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before they unboſom'd themſelves to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which produc'd the following Dialogue.</p>

                  <p>Why, I'll give you a Paſſage or two; you muſt know, that for three or four Days while our Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding was upon the Wheel, and a pretty many Friends in the Houſe, ſome of the neighbouring Clergy were continually there; either the Miniſter of the Pariſh, or of the next Pariſh, or a Gentleman's Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain that liv'd about a Mile off; and once or twice a Presbyterian Clergyman, who kept the Meeting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe in the Town, and to whom I found not Sir <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> . . . . . . only, but even the Miniſter of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh behav'd very reſpectfully; and as he was a Man of Worth and a very good Scholar, they were very intimate together. While theſe were there, as I ſaid, there was always ſome or other to ſay the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1032900302:26"/>
Grace, as they call it, at Table. But as for Prayers at Night, that was never offer'd, or perhaps thought on.</p>
                  <p>It happen'd at length we all ſat down to Table without a Chaplain, and as Sir <hi>Richard</hi> made no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to ſtand up, ſo no ſooner was the Dinner ſet on, and the Ladies plac'd, but my Lady . . . . . . had her Knife in a boil'd Turkey, and we all fell to work as decently, and with as little regard to him whoſe Hand fill'd us, as any Pack of Hounds in the Country.</p>

                  <p>Well, you ſhall hear how ſhe ſerv'd me, and how handſomely ſhe was ſerv'd for it by her own Brother: She kept her Word with me about a Week; but one Evening, as we were at Supper, ſhe made a Motion to me, and ſeem'd to ſmile: I kept my Countenance as long as ſhe kept it from being taken Notice of; but ſhe took care to let Sir <hi>Richard</hi> ..... ſee her, who, as he was a merry Man, and full of good Humour, would needs know what the Matter was; ſhe points to me, <hi>Let him tell you,</hi> ſays ſhe, for he won't let me. Sir <hi>Richard</hi> preſs'd me, and I bluſh'd as red as the Colour of Blood would allow; at length my Wife ſaid,</p>
                  <p>Nay, Mr. ...... it is not ſuch a mighty Thing, you may tell it.</p>
                  <p>No, my Dear, ſaid I, I am ſure I ſhan't; and I am ſure you won't.</p>
                  <p>This made the Caſe worſe, for they were doubly importunate then; and Sir <hi>Richard,</hi> who always thought it had been ſome little Jeſt or other, lays hold of his Siſter, and ſwore ſhe ſhould tell him.</p>
                  <p>I interceeded with him and perſuaded him, told him ſhe had engag'd to me not to ſpeak of it, and I hop'd he would not make her break the firſt Promiſe that ever I ask'd her to make, ſince ſhe was my Wife.</p>
                  <p>My Wife turn'd upon me, and would have me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh her Promiſe; I told her I could not; in a Word, it began to warm us on all Hands, and my Wife in particular, told me I us'd her ill.</p>
                  <p>My Dear, ſaid I, 'tis very hard you ſhould ſay ſo, when you know you are only deſir'd to conceal one of my Faults.</p>
                  <p>I know no Fault in it, ſays ſhe; and if it be, I deſire to conceal none of your Faults.</p>
                  <p>But if you don't <hi>my Dear,</hi> ſaid I, you will expoſe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1032900302:29"/>
me very much, for you will find I have a great many Faults worſe than this, that I hope no Body ſhall know but your ſelf.</p>
                  <p>She was afraid I had, <hi>ſhe ſaid;</hi> and this had given her ſuch a Surfeit of me, that if the reſt were much worſe, ſhe was afraid they would give her a Vomit, that would bring up all her Love.</p>
                  <p>My Dear, <hi>ſaid I,</hi> I hope that lies too deep for ſuch a ſlight Operation. I was going to ſay more, but I ſaw ſhe was in a Rage, ſo I forbore.</p>
                  <p>She anſwered, I don't know whether it does or no; and with thoſe Words roſe from the Table and went up Stairs.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Richard. . . . . .</hi> the beſt humour'd Man in the World, run and took hold of her, ſwore ſhe ſhould not go, and drag'd her back a good way, but ſhe flung from him; I followed her, but ſhe was too nimble for me, and got into her Room, and with flinging the Door after her, and I too near her, ſtruck me on the Noſe, and ſet me a bleeding moſt violently.</p>
                  <p>You may be ſure this Carriage and my Bleeding ſpoil'd our Mirth, and indeed our Supper; nor could my Lady. . . . . or another Siſter prevail with her to come out of her Chamber, or let me in for ſome Hours; indeed, when ſhe heard of my Bleeding, and had opened the Door after I was gone down, and ſeen how much I had bleed upon the Stair-head be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Servant could be call'd with a Baſon and Towel, ſhe was much concerned, and ſent her Maid down to ſee how I did.</p>
                  <p>In the Interim of this Sir <hi>Richard,</hi> who appeared very much concern'd at what had had happen'd, came to me, and ſmiling ſaid, Brother, I am very ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that I ſhould be inſtrumental to put my Siſter out of Humour, eſpecially with you; and I muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, I never knew her ſo much out in her Behaviour in my Life.</p>

Sir, <hi>ſaid I,</hi> it would have been no Trouble to me, if it had not been that the Thing itſelf was from ſomething I had fooliſhly let fall, which if ſhe had told in her Way, would have made you think me wanting in my Reſpect to you, which of all Things in the World I would give no occaſion for, having been treated ſo obligingly by you, ever ſince I had the Honour to be related to you.</p>
                  <p>Come Brother, ſays Sir <hi>Richard,</hi> here's my Hand and my Word, it ſhall move no ſuch Imaginations in me; beſides, I would not have preſs'd her, if I had thought in the leaſt it had related to me.</p>
                  <p>Indeed Sir <hi>Richard,</hi> ſaid I, it had not the leaſt Diſreſpect in it to you; yet I freely own, I ſhould not have ſaid it, no not to my own Wife.</p>
                  <p>And I freely own, <hi>ſays he,</hi> my Siſter is in the wrong if it be ſo, for it's hard a Man cannot ſpeak a Word in his Bed-Chamber to his own Wife, but ſhe muſt betray him; O theſe Wives, ſays he ſmiling, are ſuch Boſom Friends! There's my Wife, ſays he, pointing to his Lady, is juſt ſuch another Privy-Counſel-keeper.</p>
                  <p>Well, Sir <hi>Richard. . . . . . .</hi> ſaid I, however, I hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily ask your Pardon for what I ſaid, whether ſhe tells it or not; and I acknowledge it was what did not become me to ſay, nor was it any of my Buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>Says Sir <hi>Richard,</hi> Let it be what it will, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I know it or no, I give you my Promiſe, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I will not take any thing ill from you.</p>

                  <p>Come, come, ſaid Sir <hi>Richard,</hi> let's talk no more of it.</p>
                  <p>This paſs'd on; we ſpent the Evening well enough, but no Wife appear'd, neither was ſhe to be ſpoke with till almoſt Bed-time.</p>
                  <p>When I had Admittance, ſhe made me a Bow, ask'd me <hi>how I did?</hi> ſaid ſhe was ſorry the Door ſtruck me, and behav'd mighty mannerly, <hi>but not a bit kindly;</hi> ſhe hardly knew how to differ with me; we had not been long enough married to know how to manage a Broil, ſo we carry'd it aukwardly and ſhy; I went to her and kiſs'd her; ſhe made me a Curteſy as if I had been a Stranger ſaluting her; and thus it paſs'd off till the next Day.</p>
                  <p>In the Morning ſhe asked me if I intended to dine from her again? I ſaid, <hi>No my Dear,</hi> and ſmil'd, at which ſhe ſeem'd very well pleas'd.</p>

                  <p>I could eaſily ſee my Wife was ſurpriz'd, but ſhe could not imagine which Way her Secret came out.</p>

After Dinner Sir <hi>Richard</hi> . . . . ſtood up, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd Thanks with the ſame Gravity, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately my Wife offer'd to withdraw.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Richard,</hi> who happen'd to ſit next her, caught hold of her; <hi>Siſter,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I hope you are not angry ſtill?</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>I was going to ſpeak; <hi>Pray Brother,</hi> ſays Sir <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, leave it to me; it's my Quarrel, and I'll have no Seconds. Indeed Siſter,</hi> ſays he, <hi>it's bad to be miſtaken once, but you have the Misfortune to be</hi> twice wrong; <hi>for THERE's the falſe Siſter that told your Story,</hi> pointing to his Lady, <hi>and whether ſhe had it from my Brother or you, none knows better than your ſelf.</hi> She was going to Reply, when Sir <hi>Richard</hi> put in thus; <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'I have but one Requeſt to you Siſter, <hi>ſays he,</hi> and that is, that you will never ſpeak a Word of the Unkindneſs of it, as you call it, on either Hand; I am ſo far from taking it ill, that I am more glad it happen'd, than if you had given me 500 <hi>l: Why Siſter,</hi> continued he, tho' I am looſe enough and wicked enough in other Things, yet do we not all own that GOD gives us our Daily Bread?

                  <p>But now, as I told you, our Houſe being finiſh'd, we prepar'd to Remove, and here began my Difficulty; the looſe profane Life we had led began to be too familiar to me; and this join'd with the

Diſcouragements of a Wife that I knew had no Taſte of religious Things, made me cold in the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of my Duty, and we began to live juſt as we did before.</p>
                  <p>It continued thus above four Months; at laſt an odd Accident, <hi>as my Wife call'd it,</hi> but a wonderful good Providence to me, <hi>as I call'd it,</hi> gave a Turn to us, a Way by which I had the leaſt Expectation of any ſuch Thing; for it made my Wife, tho' with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt Affection to the thing, be the firſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of it to me.</p>

                  <p>My Wife had an old Uncle, her Father's own Brother, who was a Miniſter, and who lived farther in the Country, who about this Time came to our Town to ſee us; he had been a Week or two at Sir <hi>Richard's,</hi> and then came to ſee his Neice, <hi>my Wife,</hi> and to ſtay three or four Days, as was his Cuſtom; he was rich, and had no Heirs but my Wife and her Siſter; and as ſhe expects a good Lift from him when he dies, ſhe was mighty obſervant and reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him.</p>

                  <p>Well, I laid up her Words in my Heart, <hi>(viz.)

                  <p>Upon a ſerious Reflection in this Manner on the Neglect of my own Duty, and how juſtly ſhe had reproach'd me with her <hi>not having hindered me,</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved that as this good Man was likely to begin ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

up good Order and Worſhip of GOD in my Houſe, I would endeavour to keep it up when he was gone: And another Circumſtance happened to make this Work eaſier to me than I expected.</p>
                  <p>It happened that our Uncle the Miniſter had not been two Days in the Houſe, but he was taken very Lame of the Gout; and after that had lock'd him in for near two Months, he fell into an Ague, which held him almoſt two more; ſo that we had his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany near four Months, to my great Satisfaction, and no leſs to the Affliction of my Wife.</p>
                  <p>The good old Man being Lame, as above, call'd me to him one Morning, and told me he deſir'd to ſpeak with me; when he began very ſeriouſly to talk with me upon the Subject of <hi>Family Worſhip,</hi> and we talk'd of it in the following Manner.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>Here the <hi>Miniſter</hi> broke off, he ſaw her dull, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, and without any Reliſh of what he had ſaid, and that the Anſwers ſhe had made were, as it were extorted from her, not at all Natural, or ſpoken with any Freedom; and ſo he, told me when we talk'd.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1032900302:44"/>
However, Couſin, ſays he, I have made the way clear for you to begin that Work, which is your Duty; and I hope you will have no Obſtruction from your Wife.</p>
                  <p>This good Man ſtay'd, as I told you, about four Months, and when he began to be well again, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd to go Home; but the Evening before he went away, he call'd me to him, and as my Wife was ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by him before, he directed his Speech to us both—He made a ſhort, but very ſignificant Diſcourſe, of the Neceſſity and Advantage of a religious Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Government, an orderly Houſhold, and the ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſt Examples to our Servants and Children; and the Duty upon Maſters of Families to worſhip GOD in a publick manner, for the Advantage, Example, and Encouragement of all under their Roof—And after this he turn'd to me, and with a kind of an Air of Reproof, but very reſpectful, he put me in mind, how the weight of all his Diſcourſe was upon me; that I was the Head of the Family, and anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for the Government and Management of it, as well Civil as Religious. I know, Couſin, ſays he, you are but new marry'd, and perhaps your Wife and you may not yet have enquired of one another, what of this kind may be your Duty: But as I have taken upon me to preſs you to this Work, as your Duty, I take it upon me likewiſe to anſwer for your Wife, that ſhe will not be any Hindrance to you; nay, ſhe has own'd to me, that ſhe is deſirous of it, and will do all that lies in her to encourage you in it.</p>
                  <p>I made him a Bow, and told him, I was very glad of it; that indeed I had always been educated in a religious Family, and that I had never omitted my Duty in that Matter till ſince I was marry'd; but however, that I did not in the leaſt charge the Neglect upon my Wife. I told him it was true, that I never had propos'd it to her, and ſo I did not know her Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1032900302:45"/>
of thoſe things; but I acknowledg'd that was my Fault, and that I was exceeding glad that ſhe had ſo happily prevented me; and that ſince ſhe deſir'd it of me, I was ſure I never willingly deny'd her any thing ſhe deſir'd, much leſs ſhould I do it in a thing that was as much my Inclination as my Duty.</p>
                  <p>I aſſure you, Couſin, ſaid he, your Wife deſires it, and gave me leave to tell you ſo; I hope ſhe will confirm what I ſay; Do you not, <hi>Neice,</hi> ſays he turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her? At which ſhe made a Bow to him, as her Conſent; but I thought then I ſaw a kind of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt in her Countenance of the whole Diſcourſe, and particularly, of that Part, of her being deſirous of it; at which I ſaw ſhe plainly ſmil'd. However, in a word, the good Man made us both promiſe, that as he had been our Chaplain now for four Months, and brought the Servants to a Courſe of good Order and Family-Worſhip, that now it ſhould be conſtantly kept up.</p>
                  <p>For my part, I never made a Promiſe with greater Satisfaction in my Life, and thought my ſelf gotten over the greateſt Difficulty that ever was upon me, <hi>(viz.)</hi> of bringing my Wife to conſent. But I little thought how much I was miſtaken.</p>
                  <p>When my Wife was gone, I thank'd the good Gentleman very ſincerely, and told him how glad I was of the Step he had taken; yet I own'd to him, that I thought my Wife had come into it rather to oblige him, than from any ſincere Regard to the Duty it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>I ſee that plainly, Couſin, ſaid he, but do you go on; it is your Part to do your Duty, whether ſhe likes, or conſents or not. And beſides, ſaid he, you do not know, but in time ſhe may be convinc'd, as I hope ſhe will. At which he repeated theſe words, <hi>How knoweſt thou, O Man, but thou mayeſt gain thy Wife.</hi> And thus we ended this Diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:1032900302:46"/>
The next Day our good Chaplain being gone; as my Wife and I was ſitting together after Dinner, I ſaid to her; Well, my Dear, do you remember what we promis'd to do to Night, are you of the ſame Mind?</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>What Mind, ſaid ſhe?</p>
                     <p>Why, that we ſhould keep up the Order of the Houſe, and go to Prayer every Night and Morning.</p>
                     <p>Ay, ay, ſays ſhe, I am juſt in the ſame Mind now as I was then.</p>

                  <p>Why, as I told you, my Temptation was the ſame with yours; and perhaps the Arguments againſt my Duty were ſtronger, for I had no Family, no Children but one half a Year old; ſo it naturally of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to me thus, Why <hi>let her alone,</hi> if ſhe will be a Heathen, and die like a Heathen, what can I do? I muſt retire my ſelf; ſeeing ſhe will not let me pray with her, I muſt pray by my ſelf, and pray for her; and wait the Time when it may pleaſe GOD to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim her, and then I may ſet up Family-Worſhip a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: This went a great way with me, and I argued juſt as you did, that it was not my Duty to offer the Worſhip of GOD to the Contempt of a Scoffer; that there could be no Compoſure, no Engagement of the Affections, no Energy in Prayer, where I knew I was ridicul'd and laugh'd at by her that ſhould join with me; and, <hi>in a Word,</hi> that it was impoſſible I ſhould pray to my own Edification, or to the Profit of others in ſuch a Circumſtance, and therefore I would not pray at all.</p>

                  <p>But after my Paſſion was abated, I conſider'd calmly, that for me to omit my Duty, becauſe my Wife would nor do hers, had no manner of Cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with it ſelf, any more than that I ſhould not eat my Meat if my Wife would not eat hers; I look'd upon praying to GOD, as not my indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable Duty only, but as an ineſtimable Privilege, and that to abate it for the Miſtake of a weak or wicked Woman, was to puniſh my ſelf, not to puniſh her: I remembered an unhappy Accident which happen'd in the Town where I live, That a poor Man, a Shoe-maker, who had a very turbulent provoking Wife, and being driven into Paſſions and Deſparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by her wicked Uſage of him, ſtab'd himſelf with his Knife; it came freſh into my Mind how univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally all the Neighbours condemned him as guilty of Self-Murder; and how in particular I was one of the forwardeſt to cenſure him on that very Account, and to ſay, that to kill himſelf becauſe his Wife was unkind, was making one Affliction two, ſo was irrational; and which was worſe, made her Sin againſt him be an occaſion of his Sin againſt GOD and himſelf, which was a horrible Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: As I thought upon this, I then argued with my ſelf thus; By this Woman's Unkindneſs, I am rob'd of the Comfort of my Family, and of the Expectation I had from her as a Relation; but if I omit my Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I then rob my ſelf of my Peace, ſin againſt GOD and my Family, and open a Door to all manner of Sin and Diſtraction.</p>

               <p>THE Conference between the Two Friends in the laſt Dialogue, left them almoſt in the ſame Condition; both of them being oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Performance of their Family Duty by their Wives, and both of them reſolv'd to go on in the Way of their Duty, and to keep up the Worſhip of GOD in their Families, whether their Wives would or not.</p>
               <p>For the Diſcourſe of the Country Gentleman had opened the Eyes of the Citizen; and he reſolved to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:1032900302:60"/>
follow his Example; tho' as he had moſt eaſily given up his Duty at firſt, ſo he had far the greater Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in bringing his Family to a Compliance after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as will preſently appear.</p>
               <p>When he came home the ſame Evening from his Friend, he ſat penſive and melancholy a good while, muſing with himſelf what Courſe he ſhould take with his Wife; his Reſolution to take upon himſelf the Government of his Family had not failed him, but he was ſo ruffled by his Wife before in the Caſe of his Performance, that he hardly knew in what manner to go about it, nor how to manage it; he was loth to ſhut his Wife out of the Room, and yet was afraid of her going away, and taking away thoſe Three Children with her, who, as was ſaid, had ſided with her againſt him, and who he was reſolved ſhould attend him at his publick Worſhip; however, it ſo happened to his great Mortification, that going but out of the Room into a Cloſet for ſome particular Occaſion, his Wife in the Interval goes away with her youngeſt Son, and her two eldeſt Daughters, and retiring to her own Apartment, continued there near an Hour.</p>
               <p>This ſo ſurprized, and which was worſe, ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed him, that together with ſome unkind Words which paſs'd afterwards between him and his Wife, and which put him into a violent Paſſion, he was quite unfitted for his Duty for that Night; and, <hi>as he ſaid afterwords,</hi> it had ſo diſcouraged him, that he was almoſt at the Point to have given over the happy Reſolution he had taken of returning to his Family Performance; however, it quite broke off his Thoughts of it, <hi>as I ſaid,</hi> for <hi>that Night.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Morning he compoſed his Mind as well as he could, and reſolved to enter upon his Work, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Wife conſented or not; and yet being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to have it all managed, as it ought to be, in a lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:1032900302:61"/>
and Chriſtian Manner, if he could, he reſolved to diſcourſe with his Wife firſt, if poſſible, to bring her to Compliance with him, and to a Senſe of her Duty both to GOD and her Husband; and I think the following Diſcourſe was before they were up, or at leaſt before they were come out of their Chamber.</p>

                  <p>Liberty of Conſcience relates to different Ways of Worſhip, but is not concern'd in the Diſpute between Worſhip in general, and no Worſhip at all; there's no Toleration to be an Arheiſt, to deny GOD or abandon Religion.</p>

                  <p>I'll oblige them to give their Attendance to Family Orders; I am ſure it is their Duty; they may pray by themſelves at other Times, and I hope they will.</p>

                  <speaker>Husb.</speaker>
                  <p>Family Worſhip is an undoubted Duty, if they don't think ſo, it is time they were taught better.</p>

                  <p>Well, <hi>my Dear,</hi> I am ſatisfy'd, I hope you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Nature of Prayer to be ſuch, that as we have a heavenly Pattern ſet us in the Scripture, to direct our Form, ſo we have a merciful heavenly Father to pray to, who is pleas'd to paſs over our Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections and accept us for the Sincerity of our Hearts, not the Aptneſs or Excellence of our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions.</p>

                  <speaker>Da.</speaker>
                  <p>If it was not ſo, Sir, very few ought to ſay their own Words when they pray.</p>

                  <speaker>Fa.</speaker>
                  <p>It is true, my Dear, and tho' Forms of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er may be uſeful to help the Tongue, eſpecially with reſpect to the Edification of thoſe that hear; yet, bleſſed be GOD, that he hears the Thoughts of the Heart, when the Tongue has no Words to expreſs it ſelf by, or Forms to aſſiſt it in ſpeaking.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Da.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, you always told us, that whatever Form we prayed by, GOD would hear us if we prayed with Sincerity and Faith in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Fa.</speaker>
                  <p>I did ſo, and I have the Scripture to ſupport it; <hi>Whatſoever ye ask the Father in my Name, believing that you ſhall receive it, you ſhall receive it.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>

                  <p>I don't remember, <hi>Sir,</hi> that in all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I am forbid to join in Prayer with any, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Words, or for any perſonal Defect or Infirmity; my Buſineſs is to ſee that I am ſincere my ſelf.</p>

                  <p>Very true, <hi>Child,</hi> if they that pray are not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere in what they ſay, it is their Fault; thoſe that join may be accepted, when he whoſe Words they join with may be rejected; elſe we ſhould have a dreadful Task in Prayer, and ſuch Confuſion of Thoughts muſt follow, as would deſtroy the Nature of the Duty; for we ſhould never know when we were to be accepted and when not.</p>

                  <p>Well, <hi>my Dear,</hi> the Spirit of GOD will help your Infirmities, you muſt pray for the Aſſiſtance of the Spirit: but I ſhall talk to thee of that another Time.</p>

               <p>Upon this Diſcourſe the Father diſmiſs'd the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, charging them not to fail to be always ready when he ſhould call to Prayer.

The Caſe is plain, I am reſolved to ſerve and worſhip GOD in my Family; I hope and believe I ſhall pleaſe, and be accepted of him, tho' it ſeems I can't pleaſe my Wife; I do not ask your Attendance, till you will be pleaſed to join in a Chriſtian manner, with a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Charity and Devotion; the laſt towards GOD, and the firſt towards your Husband.</p>

                     <hi>My Dear,</hi> I hope for your being in a better Mind in GOD's due time; in the mean time it is not fit that your Error ſhould interrupt their Duty; neither can I ſatisfy my ſelf to ſuffer it.</p>

               <p>His Wife went away in a great Paſſion, and ſaid ſome things to him at parting which I care not to mention, and which grieved the good Man extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but he made her no Reply.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the Man went on with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1032900302:75"/>
Order, and had the Worſhip of GOD, as Reading the Scriptures, ſinging Pſalms, and Prayer, regularly and conſtantly perform'd; his Children at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended conſtantly and chearfully; but his Wife never.</p>
               <p>It had indeed been ſome Trouble to his Mind, that for ſome time after the Breach above-mention'd, he had ſhut the Door of his Parlour when he went to Prayers; which he had not only done to keep his Wife out, but had told her too, <hi>as before;</hi> and ſhe had twice, or three times, come down to the Door, and finding it lock'd, went back again.</p>
               <p>He had found her ſo Paſſionate, and ſo fill'd with Contempt of his Performance, that it was his real Belief her Deſign was at firſt to give him ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance, to behave with ſome Indecency, or at leaſt to take hold of ſome Expreſſion of his, more unguarded perhaps than ordinary, to upbraid him with, and perhaps to make a Mock of among the Children, as ſhe had done once or twice before; and therefore thought it better to have her abſent, at leaſt till ſhe was come to a better Temper. But after ſome time, and finding her, as I ſaid, come two or three times down to the Door, he began to conſider, <hi>that</hi> it was not for him to judge of what Temper ſhe came in; <hi>that</hi> to ſhut her out was not only unkind, but was depriving her of an Opportunity of being convinc'd; that perhaps when ſhe might come with a Deſign to ſcoff at or inſult him, GOD might di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect ſomething to touch her Thoughts, that might turn her Affections to him, and remove her Pride and want of Charity all at once, and ſo make the very Thing that ſhe had deſpiſed, be the Means of her Reformation: And as theſe were Things which above every thing elſe he deſired, he was exceedingly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled that he had ſhut the Door.</p>
               <p>If he was concern'd on theſe Accounts, and upon
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:1032900302:76"/>
Debates only with himſelf, that Concern was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly encreaſed, when he underſtood by his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that the laſt time her Mother came down and found the Door faſt, ſhe had been crying vehemently in her Chamber for ſome Hours after; this mov'd him exceedingly: for he was a very kind and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Husband to her, and he reſolved never to faſten the Door again, and order'd his Daughter to let her Mother know the Door was never lock'd, but always left a little open, even without the Latch being touch'd: However, his Wife never offer'd to come down after the Door was left open.</p>
               <p>It may be eaſily believ'd, that while this Breach continued in religious Things, the Family Peace, as to common Affairs, went all to wreck; the Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Husband and Wife were perfectly chang'd to one another; no Smiles, no pleaſant Word, no kind Thing paſs'd between them; but a Cloud of Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly and Diſcontent, and an Air of Eſtrangement ſpread it ſelf over the whole Family; every little Diſpute broke out into a Feud, every Feud was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on to the extreameſt height; and, in a word, there was very little room, if any, for the poor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of conjugal Affection to ſhew it ſelf: So cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain is it, that where the religious Peace is broken, no other Peace can long continue.</p>
               <p>This afflicted the Husband's Mind to the laſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; and not the Wife only, but all the Family per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it. As to his Wife, ſhe kept it more to her ſelf, and continued to carry it with an unſociable haughtineſs of Temper; if he offer'd to ſpeak of it, ſhe would always put a ſhort End to the Diſcourſe; tell him, ſhe had nothing to ſay to him; or flying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from him, or perhaps ſay ſome very paſſionate thing that put an End to it; ſo that ſhe would never enter into any Diſcourſe with him; ſhe ſeemed to live altogether in her Chamber retir'd from all Com
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:1032900302:77"/>
pany, and came down into her Family, as if it were with Reluctance; and more by the Neceſſity of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering her Servants and Houſhold-Affairs, than by Choice, or from any Pleaſure ſhe took among them; and as this had not only continued a long time, but ſeemed to have no viſible Proſpect of any Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it gave her. Husband a moſt unſufferable Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</p>
               <p>But alas! the good Man's Affliction was far from ending there, and the Tragical Part of the Family is yet behind.</p>
               <p>I could have been very glad to have brought this poor weak, but proud Woman upon the Stage, as a Penitent, acknowledging her Miſtake in Duty, for miſuſing her Husband; and her Miſtake in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for deſpiſing the ſincere humble Performance of her Husband in Matters of Duty in his Family; and for obſtructing that, <hi>for want of Charity,</hi> which every ſober Chriſtian would rejoice in <hi>(viz.)</hi> to ſee GOD ſerv'd, honour'd and worſhip'd in their Family, and their Children brought up in the conſtant Exerciſe of thoſe religious Duties, which their natural Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to their Maker calls for.</p>
               <p>But the Truth of this Hiſtory forbids, and I muſt be forced to record this unhappy Wife as a ſad <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento</hi> againſt ſpiritual or religious Pride, and to be an Evidence of the exceeding Difficulty of reſtoring a Phariſaical Hypocrite to Repentance.</p>
               <p>The Man's Affliction, as I have ſaid, was viſible; but yet he had ſome Comfort within himſelf, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, that he was in the Way of his Duty; and the Satisfaction he had in his recovering from that wicked Step he had at firſt taken, of neglecting his Family, and throwing up the Practice of what he knew to be his Duty, was a very great and conſtant Support to him.</p>
               <p>He had alſo the Satisfaction to ſee, that all his
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:1032900302:78"/>
Children joined with him heartily, and ſeemed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in the Meaſures he had taken for the Order and Regularity of the Houſe; and the eldeſt Daughter, a good ſober, and well-enclin'd Child, would often ſay to him, Dear Father, perſwade my Mother to come down to Prayers.</p>
               <p>He would be very cautious of ſaying any thing to the Child that ſeem'd to reflect on her Mother; but one Day the Child ſaying ſo to him, he anſwered; My Dear, I am very ſorry your Mother does not come down, do you perſwade her to it, I ſhould be very glad to have her come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Said the Daughter,</hi> ſhall I go and tell her you ſent me to deſire her to come?</p>
               <p>Ay do, my Dear, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> with all my Heart.</p>
               <p>The Child went, and when her Father ask'd her what her Mother ſaid, ſhe could not anſwer him, but broke out into Tears; her Father underſtood it.</p>
               <p>Well, my Dear, <hi>ſaid her Father,</hi> don't let it trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thee, I ſee how it is, we muſt wait GOD's time.</p>
               <p>He fail'd not to take all Opportunities to ſpeak to her himſelf after this; but found his Wife, as he thought, had taken a new Method; for as before ſhe would always anſwer him with ſomething very ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur'd and unkind, ſo now tho' ſhe were ever ſo free in Diſcourſe of other Things, when ever he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſpeak of this Affair, ſhe would not anſwer one Word.</p>
               <p>Theſe things continued about three Quarters of a Year, and far from abating by length of Time, as Family Heats between Husband and Wife ordinarily do; on the contrary, they took Root like a ſtrong Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, by the Length of their Duration.</p>
               <p>At length his Wife was taken Ill; the Man was exceedingly afflicted at his Wife's Sickneſs, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially as he ſaw ſome Danger of Death; and it almoſt diſtracted his Thoughts to think ſhe ſhould die
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:1032900302:79"/>
without being reconciled to him; her Diſtemper at firſt appeared a kind of a Lethargick Fever, which, as it prey'd upon her Spirits one way, and brought her very low, ſo it kept her dozing, and uncapable to be talk'd with, another way.</p>
               <p>He often attempted to ſpeak to her. but found ſhe would not anſwer a Word; or if ſhe did, it was either to deſire him not to trouble her, or ſomething quite remote from what he ſaid; by which he found that ſhe was too much ſtupify'd by the Diſtemper to talk, and unwilling to diſcourſe when ſhe was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
               <p>The Diſtemper however in about three Weeks time abated, and ſhe began to get Strength, but no Life came into her Temper, no Chearfulneſs into her Spirits; but a deep Melancholy ſeemed to ſucceed the Fever; and one Morning the Phyſician that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended her came to her Husband, and ask'd him if he knew any extraordinary Trouble ſhe had upon her Spirits? Her Husband ſaid no, no extraordinary one; But why do you ask me that Queſtion, ſays he with great Concern? Why, ſays the Doctor, becauſe I fear ſhe has a little Spice of Diſorder in her Head, and if we do not prevent it, ſhe will be in danger of a confirm'd Melancholy.</p>
               <p>It is impoſſible to expreſs the Concern this put him in, and he began to enter into a ſerious Conſultation with the Doctor, who had ſpoke cantiouſly, becauſe he would not ſurprize him; but the Apothecary came down immediately after, and with leſs Prudence ſaid aloud to the Doctor, who ask'd how ſhe did? <hi>Do,</hi> ſays he, <hi>why ſhe is mad, quite diſtracted, we muſt get ſome Help immediately to tie her in the Bed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Her Husband, who had by the Prudence of the Doctor entertained only an Apprehenſion of the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſuch a thing as remote, and poſſible to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:1032900302:80"/>
when he heard what the Apothecary ſaid, ſpoke not a Word, but ſunk down on the Floor.</p>
               <p>The Phyſician being at Hand, they were not ſo much at a Loſs for applying proper Remedies; but it was ſo long e'er they recovered him, that the Doctor himſelf was once of the Opinion that he was dead, and was going out of the Room; but ſome Signs of Life appearing ſoon after, they went on with their Applications, and opening a Vein, the Blood flowing, recovered him to Life, but left him very ill, which was followed by a Fever, and that threw him into the Small-Pox, which it ſeems he had not had, and from which he did not recover without great Danger of his Life.</p>
               <p>There was a ſad Family we may be ſure, while the Maſter and Miſtreſs of the Family remained in theſe Circumſtances: But however, the Husband recovered with the help of Time; but the Wife grew worſe, till he was obliged to have her removed out of the Houſe for a Time; and as it is allowed that a melancholy Lunacy is the hardeſt to cure, ſo indeed they found it here, for ſhe lay above a Year under the Hands of the Phyſician, without much Appearance of Alteration, except at Intervals, ſcarce knowing, or at leaſt not noticing her own Children or Husband.</p>
               <p>It was obſervable, that during her Diſtemper, ſhe was always reading the Bible and religious Books, but would never talk with any Body otherwiſe than of common Things; and during the whole Time, was never heard ſo much as once to mention the Breach with her Husband; and when ſhe was thought well enough to go home again, it appeared ſhe had forgot it as perfectly as if ſhe had never known any thing of it; nor had ſhe forgotten that only, but even her Family and common Things, her Husband having removed to another Dwelling; ſhe
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:1032900302:81"/>
did not ſo much as know that it was not the ſame Houſe ſhe had lived in before; ſhe knew her Husband and Children indeed, but did not know any of the Servants; no, not enough to diſtinguiſh who had been before her Illneſs, or who had come after.</p>
               <p>This filled her Husband with dreadful Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that her Diſtemper was not removed; but as he communicated his Fears to the Phyſician, he ſaid it was a ſign that it would entirely remove at laſt; but ſhe continued a long time in but a very indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Condition, much altered in her Temper, and often ſubject to little Returns of Melancholy; but in her Family ſhe liv'd orderly, and kept in a very good Diſpoſition, as to the religious Part; and if ſhe had any Remembrances of the Breach that had been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on, ſhe kept it to her ſelf, for ſhe never would diſcover that ſhe received any Notion of it in her Thoughts; ſhe attended Duly on the Orders of the Family, appeared very ſerious at the Times of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and never offered to diſlike or reflect upon, much leſs to mock or ſcoff at her Husband's Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the leaſt.</p>
               <p>Her Children were warn'd by their Father, never to endeavour to put her in mind of former Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; no, not ſo much as in Curioſity to try whether ſhe really remembered any thing or not; which Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders they very punctually obſerved.</p>
               <p>It was not long after this, when the Country Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, whoſe Story makes a Part in the former Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, came to Town; and as their Caſes were ſo exactly alike when they had laſt diſcourſed upon the Subject of their Family Circumſtances, ſo they had kept up a conſtant Correſpondence by Letters; but now at their meeting they enter into Particulars more at large; which as near as poſſible is continued in the following Diſcourſe.</p>

                  <p>That is true, but it would have been a greater Comfort to me to have known that ſhe had been made truly ſenſible of the Sin of her former Conduct, that ſhe had repented heartily of it, and that ſhe had received Comfort in the Hope of Forgiveneſs.</p>

                  <p>Pray let me hear your Opinion in ſuch a Caſe; I cannot think GOD will lay to our Charge the Sins committed in a diſtracted Condition, when the Body is demented, and has not the Uſe of Reaſon to guide it; when Conſcience is put out of its Office, and can neither accuſe or excuſe; when the Soul is no more a Free Agent, and the Creature is reduced to the meer ſenſative Life.</p>

Pray what is the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:1032900302:84"/>
Difference between ſuch a Condition, and one dying without Repentance? I look upon my Wife as one dead, for while the Soul is diſabled in its Operations, ſhe is dead to all thoſe Things which are neceſſary to a true Penitent; ſuch as Sorrow for the Sin, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of the Evil of it, asking Pardon of GOD, acting Faith on the Blood of CHRIST for Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Reſolutions to reform, and the like; theſe it is impoſſible ſhe ſhould have any Part in, and therefore ſhe ſeems to me to be juſt in the ſame State as one dying impenitent.</p>

That, as before, you are not ſure that ſhe had no Intervals, in which GOD might ſpeak to her Soul, and her Soul fly to and embrace her Saviour with effectual Relentings, and ſaving Dependance on him for Salvation; all which might be acted in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as I doubt not it often is in the very Article of Death; witneſs the <hi>Thief upon the Croſs;</hi> and this might much better be in the Time of her Sickneſs, tho' the Diſtraction of her State ſince that, may have given her no room to diſcover it. 2. And then you have this Comfort, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſhe is ſtill alive; and tho' ſhe has given no Teſtimonies of the remembring the Error of her former Life, to repent of it; ſhe has yet ſhewn that ſhe has alſo no Remembrances of her former Miſtakes to renew them, ſhe begins upon a new Scheme of Life, acts quite another Part; and who knows but that in Time GOD may call to her mind her former Evils, and give her Repentance ſtill; ſo that you have no Reaſon either Way to look on her as one loſt.</p>

                        <p>That is neither in your Power to work, nor in hers to act, till he that gave her too much Wit gives her more Grace. But of all the Creatures that ever I met with, I never ſaw her equal; why, ſhe is worſe than I am.</p>

                  <p>Well, <hi>Suſan,</hi> thou haſt done right, and carry it on as far as you can; I have taken care he ſhall not come after her; I'll ſee if I can't bring her to her Senſes, and make her go home; ſhe does not treat him honourably indeed.</p>

                  <p>Why no, you could not expect it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, how ſhould he ſend after you, when you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge he does not know where you are.</p>

                  <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yes, yes,</hi> he knows where I am well enough.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>How is that! what have you ſent him Word?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                  <p>No indeed, not I.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>Nay, if you had, I know no Harm there would have been in it; only that I ſhould have thought you had acted a wiſer Part in that, than I think you did in coming away.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                  <p>But you could not have believ'd ſuch a thing, of one that you call Siſter; do you think ſuch Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Spirit is in the Blood of your Family?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>Why truly, <hi>Siſter,</hi> we are a hot paſſionate Brood, that is true indeed; but I muſt tell you, for my own Part, my being ſo violently paſſionate, is one of the Things that I as much hate my ſelf for, as for any thing I have about me; and I have often thought that one time or other that furious Temper of mine will bring me to ruin; make me commit Murther, or ſome Miſchief or other that will make me miſerable all the Days of my Life; and I hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſh none of my Relations would give way to their Rage, as I have done, and ſtill do, <hi>GOD for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Well,</hi> I hope you will govern your Temper, for all that, tho' I cannot mine.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>But, Siſter, you muſt govern your Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per too, or elſe you may ruin your ſelf as well as I.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                  <p>Nay, I have done that already.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>I hope not, Siſter; I would fain have you think a little, and put an end to this Breach with your Husband; certainly you cannot have had reaſon to carry it ſo far.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                  <p>What are you on his Side already? I ſuppoſe
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:1032900302:110"/>
he has ſent ſome Body to tell his Tale for him.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>No, really Siſter; I take the Story from no Body, but from your own Mouth, and juſt as you tell it your ſelf; and ſure you would not tell it to your own Diſadvantage.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                  <p>I told you nothing but what was true.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                  <p>Why ſhould yo do ſo, do I uſe to ſpeak untrue?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <hi>No,</hi> Siſter; but really I fancy'd you ſaid more againſt your ſelf than was your due; for I could not think it was poſſible you could differ, and part with your Husband upon ſuch an Occaſion only, as you ſaid you did; and from ſuch a Husband too as I think he is.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Well,</hi> you muſt believe what you pleaſe, but I did for all that.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>Why then you acted about two Degrees worſe than a Madwoman.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Why ſo?</hi> I am not in a Condition to go to <hi>Bedlam,</hi> at leaſt I do not ſee it?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>Why truly, Siſter; if ſuch a Cauſe ſhould come before us at the Quarter-Seſſions; I muſt own, that as there is no Law to puniſh bad Wives, and ſuch a Caſe as yours is was ſcarce ever heard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I ſhould certainly move my Brother Juſtices to Vote her Lunatick, and commit the Woman to <hi>Bedlam.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                  <p>You would be very unjuſt then.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>Indeed I think not, Siſter; I hope you do not take my Plainneſs-amiſs?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                  <p>No, not I; but I think you are a little Partial.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>Nay, there you wrong me too; how can I be Partial, when I take the Story as you tell it your ſelf.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                  <p>Becauſe you Cenſure me, as if I was in all the Fault.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>That's becauſe I am impartial; nay, 'tis
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:1032900302:111"/>
a Proof of my being ſo; for it cannot be ſuppoſed I would give my Opinion againſt my own Siſter, if I was not impartial; it is a ſtrong Argument that the Reaſon and Nature of the Thing is againſt you, when I am convinc'd of the Fault's being in you, by the very things you ſay in your own Vindication.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                  <p>But there may be Faults on both Sides, Brother.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>Let whoſe will be the Fault, yours is the Folly; for as a Man cannot put away his Wife, but for the capital Crime of Adultery; ſhe muſt be a great Fool that will put her ſelf away, when ſhe is guilty of no Fault at all.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                  <p>I put my ſelf away! you miſtake me, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire from an unreaſonable burthenſome Humour.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>We will talk of that afterwards, <hi>Siſter,</hi> if you will; but I would fain convince you, if you will give me Leave, of one Miſtake in your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, which perhaps you are not ſenſible of.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                  <p>What is that?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>Why it is this; that as there is no Rule in GOD's Law to direct a Woman, upon what Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions ſhe may part from her Husband, the Law of the Man being ſuppoſed to ſtand for both; ſo there is a manifeſt Difference between the Caſes; and a Woman cannot part with her Husband, but with a greater Diſadvantage to her ſelf, than it is to the Man to put her away.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                  <p>Why ſo pray?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>The Caſe is plain; the Woman's parting from her Husband is eaſier to do, but liable to more Hazards, when done; I'll explain my ſelf immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately in both: 1. <hi>It is eaſier to do;</hi> if a Woman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to part with her Husband, ſhe has nothing to do but to open the Door and go out; he can neither by Force, nor by Law prevent her, nor fetch her home again: But if the Man reſolves to put his Wife
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:1032900302:112"/>
from him, he can do it no way but by a formal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution; if he bids her be gone. ſhe may anſwer ſhe won't go; if he forces her out, ſhe may come in again; nay, the Law will force him to take her in, till he has made his turning her out legal.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <hi>So then,</hi> you think we have the Advantage; but you Men have Ways enough to be even with us.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>For the 2<hi>d,</hi> the Turn is on our ſide: As the <hi>Difficulty</hi> is on the <hi>Husband</hi>'s Part, the <hi>Scandal</hi> is on the <hi>Woman's;</hi> for as it is very well known ſhe cannot be forc'd away but for Adultery, ſo it is preſently taken for granted ſhe is guilty, if ſhe is gone.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                  <p>What? tho' ſhe goes by her Choice, not by his Force?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>Who will know the Particulars, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd to the Number that will know the general; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Body knows in general <hi>that they are parted,</hi> but not one in fifty will enquire into, or hear of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the Cauſe between the Woman and her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, or ask whether <hi>ſhe went away,</hi> or <hi>he ſent her</hi> away?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                  <p>It is true, the Diſadvantage is of our Side, but what's this to my Caſe?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>Truly, Siſter, it applies very aptly thus, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That then a wiſe Woman ſhould never part from her Husband, but upon the greateſt Neceſſity, and with the moſt juſtifiable Reaſons in the World.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                  <p>I don't know but you may be in the right in that; but I don't know that it touches my Caſe; for I do not know that this will be call'd a Parting from my Husband for good and all.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>It is not the Time will alter the Crime; no, nor will it remove the Scandal, Siſter, it is that I am arguing upon.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                  <p>Nay, I don't know for what Time it may be neither, if he carries it thus.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, how does he carry it? I don't ſee he minds you; I find he leaves you to your own Courſe.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                  <p>That's true, I am come away, and he troubles not his Head about it, as I ſee, nor intends to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himſelf, ſo we are not likely to come together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in haſte.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>Trouble himſelf! <hi>No indeed,</hi> and <hi>as I hear</hi> he reſolves never to trouble his Head about you again, unleſs you come home as you ought to do, and as it is your known Duty to do; nor can you blame him, for you acknowledge that you gave him the Occaſion; and I muſt own Siſter, that in all ſuch Caſes, they who gave the firſt Provocation, ought to make the firſt Submiſſion.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

               </sp>

               </sp>

                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>

                  <p>I never told you I was a good Wife.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>But I can tell you, that if you are not you ought to be a good Wife.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>Nay, Siſter, it is you that go on your own Way, the Man is at home.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                  <p>What do you infer from that?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>I infer, that he is where he ought to be; and you are where you ought not to be.</p>

                  <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                  <p>Dear Brother, be plain with me, are you talking from him, and for him, or is it only an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental Diſcourſe, as I thought it was?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>Truly Siſter, I will be plain; I have ſeen your Husband, and he has ſo convinc'd me of your being in the wrong, that I reſolv'd for your ſake to talk with you, and perſuade you to act with more Prudence; you know theſe are Things quite out of my Way, but I profeſs I think talking with you, and hearing of your Conduct with your Husband, has done more to make me ſerious, than all the teaching I had in my Life.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                  <p>I make you ſerious! you make me ſmile to hear you talk of being ſerious, and eſpecially at my making you ſo.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>In Troth Siſter, your Extream of Atheiſm,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:1032900302:115"/>
is enough to make an Infidel religious; why you act as if you believ'd there was neither God or Devil, Hell or Heaven, and that we were to reckon for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the next World, that we do in this; and tho' Siſter I am a poor wicked, profligate, unthinking Wretch my ſelf, yet I know I am ſo, and that I ought to be otherwiſe; <hi>B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T YO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                     </hi> are worſe than a Heathen in this, that you deſpiſe being religious, as a thing quite below you; for GOD ſake, Siſter, let you and I both think a little what will become of us.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                  <p>Bleſs me! that ever my eldeſt Brother, the well-known Sir <hi>Richard —</hi> ſhould turn Parſon! why I never heard ſuch a Sermon in the Houſe in my Life; you need not have told me you had ſeen my Husband, why if I had heard you talk thus before, I would have ſworn you had been talking to my Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and he had been preaching Repentance to you; come, come, Brother, tell me what he ſays.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>He ſays, Siſter, what I could never have believ'd; he tells me you are a Deſpiſer of all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, what News is that to you? What have I to do with Religion, or you either?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>It's true, Siſter, I have heard that Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have no Souls; but I never thought you believ'd it till now.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                  <p>I hate him, and all his religious Impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; you know thoſe Things never were reliſh'd in our Family.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>To our Shame be it ſpoken Siſter.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                  <p>Not at all! I think 'tis much to our Credit, for then we are ſure we have no Hypocrites.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>Siſter; upon my Word, your Way of talking has been the moſt of a Sermon to me that ever I heard in my Life; you really make my very Blood run chill, and my Joints tremble; it's true, I have not been religious, GOD pardon me, but I
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:1032900302:116"/>
never thought my ſelf the better for it, or to be commended for it; there is a great deal of Difference Siſter, between one that practices no religious Part, and one that deſpiſes Religion it ſelf; and I doubt that is juſt the Difference between you and I.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                  <p>I don't trouble my ſelf about Religion, nor do I intend to trouble my ſelf about it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>Why then your Husband has not ſlander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                  <p>But he might have held his Tongue, and not endeavour'd to blacken his Wife.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>Why really <hi>Siſter,</hi> you do him Wrong, he is the backwardeſt Man alive to ſpeak it of you; but did not you own it to me your ſelf, when you and I talk'd laſt?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                  <p>What did I own?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>Why truly you own'd what I could hardly believe, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That all the Quarrel between you and your Husband, was becauſe he is too religious; that he kept up the Worſhip of GOD in the Houſe, and prays, and reads the Bible in the Family.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, and ſo it was; I had rather behalf hear him ſing a Song.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>I vow <hi>Siſter,</hi> you aſtoniſh me! I thought there had been nothing wickeder than I in the World; you need not talk of your Husband expoſing you.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                  <p>But I do talk of it for all that.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich,</speaker>
                  <p>But I'll do him ſo much Juſtice, that he conceals your Folly as much as poſſible; nor would he own the Reaſon of your leaving him, till I extorted it from him, by telling him that you told me your ſelf that you left him for nothing, but becauſe you could not bear his going to Prayers; tho' indeed <hi>Siſter,</hi> I always thought you had jeſted.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                  <p>Not I, why ſhould you think I jeſted? Did you think I would come away from my Husband in Jeſt?</p>

                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>Why I thought it was impoſſible any Woman in <hi>Earneſt,</hi> could leave a Husband upon ſuch an Occaſion, much leſs own it when ſhe had done; and when I mentioned it to your Husband, he would have perſuaded me that it was ſome other thing you had taken ill from him, and that he hoped ſome time or other you would forget it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, and did he preach a long Sermon to you? Come, tell me what he ſaid.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>I aſſure you Siſter, you have preach'd a Sermon to me, that I believe will ſtick to me as long as I live.</p>

                  <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                  <p>I preach! what have I ſaid to you? I hate Preaching, you know it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>Truly Siſter, I cannot repeat what you have ſaid; but you have expoſed the Folly and Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of an irreligious Converſation ſo much by your practiſing it, that I reſolve from this Time to amend my Life, and change my whole Practice, Society, and Converſation: GOD forgive me what is paſt; and if he will give me Grace to follow my Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I will be quite another Man than ever you knew me.</p>

               <sp>

                  <p>No <hi>Siſter,</hi> tho' your Husband ſaid ſome Things that touch'd me very cloſe; yet the Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in me, is not from him, but from you; and I am really allarm'd by your Deſperation, like a Man that I have heard of, who was made a true Convert to Religion by ſeeing the Devil.</p>

                  <p>Do! go Home like a Woman of Senſe, like a Wife, and like a Chriſtian, and do your Duty in your Family, and among your Children; did ever Woman leave her Husband and Children, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, only becauſe the honeſt Man pray'd to GOD with her, and perhaps for her?

                  <p>I can aſſure you if you ſtay till he fetches you, it will be long before you get Home.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                  <p>And I'll never go to him if he don't, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not if he does.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>But who does the Duty of a Relation then all this while?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, is there no Duty of his Side?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, <hi>Siſter,</hi> there is; but he is not out of his Duty, the Scripture and the Marriage Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract obliges him to love his Wife, and provide for his Wife; but I confeſs I do not find that it obliges him, when ſhe runs-away from him, to run after her, to perſwade her to come Home again; eſpecially when he has given no juſt Reaſon for her Elopement.</p>

                  <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                  <p>And does he think it is not his Duty to come after me?</p>

                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, Siſter, I will tell you ſo far what he ſays; tho' I aſſure you I am not commiſſion'd from him to tell it you, or meddle with it; he ſays, you are gone from him, he has not put you from him; that he is at Home in his Family, which is his Place, and his Duty; that he gave you no Provocation to

go away, and that his Buſineſs is not to force you back; that his Doors and his Arms are always open to receive you, if you pleaſe to return to your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and to your Habitation; that if not, he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits to it as an Affliction, but that he can do no more, or concern himſelf no farther in it; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, Siſter, what can he do more? I am amaz'd at you!</p>

                  <p>He ſays, he will do any thing in the World that he can do, which is not inconſiſtent with his Conſcience and his Duty, in order to engage your Affections to him; but upon my Word, Siſter, if you inſiſt upon his breaking off his religious Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Family, you cannot expect it of him: <hi>Why,</hi> it would be Perſecution, and he ought to die a Martyr, rather than comply with it.</p>

                  <p>I can't ſay you have done; while you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in a ſeparate Condition from him, and that on Account of his Family Orders; is not that preſſing him in the moſt forcible manner that you are able to do, to lay them down? and if he has any Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to you, and any Deſire to have your Company, as no doubt he has, is it not laying a ſtrong Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before him to throw off thoſe things to oblige you? I believe you cannot ſay, but he has been a very tender obliging Husband.</p>

                  <p>Siſter, Siſter, you are reſolv'd to make a Chriſtian of me, by making a Devil of your ſelf. Here I am, your poor wicked horrid Brother! 'tis too true; and among my ſporting Companions, I have been the Scandal of my Neighbours; more abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and more ravingly wicked than any Man in the Country: I acknowledge it, Siſter, I am aſham'd of it, I abhor my ſelf every time I look back upon it; and, Siſter, 'twould be juſt, if my Maker, whoſe Name I have blaſphem'd, whoſe Goodneſs I have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus'd, ſhould give me up, even now, after I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of the Brutality and Wickedneſs of it, to fall again into the ſame deteſtable Crimes: But believe me, Siſter, your telling me I ſhall do ſo again, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larms my very Soul; I hope I ſhall make you a falſe Prophet in that Part; tho' the Warning you give me, I acknowledge, is very ſeaſonable: But, as I ſaid before, Siſter, every Word you ſay is an Inſtruction; and tho' I am very ſorry the Teacher ſhould be my Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, yet I muſt own it is an excellent Leſſon to me, to ſee one in the World wickeder than my ſelf.</p>

                  <p>It's true, Siſter, it is not much to that Caſe, but it is to me: However, we'll leave that, and talk about you and your Husband, if you will give me room to ſay any thing that may be of uſe to you, and may tend to reconcile you to your Duty, and bring you together again; but if you are reſolved to be obſtinate, what can I do for you?</p>

                  <p>Your whole Diſcourſe runs as if you had no Deſign of reconciling; for you lay all the Blame on one Side, and he is in no Fault in your Opinion: Is that the way to bring us together?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, if he is in no Fault, how can I help that? If he is, let me hear it; I have had the whole Story from your ſelf, and I han't heard you charge him with any thing. I confeſs, when you told me your ſelf, that you broke from him for no other Reaſon, but that you could not bear the Burthen of his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities, as you called it, I did not believe you; but thought that ſome other thing had happen'd between you, and that you were willing to conceal the true Occaſion.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>Becauſe, <hi>as I ſaid before, Siſter,</hi> I did not think it poſſible any Woman in the World could be ſo mad to call that an Offence, which all the World, even the wickedeſt Part of it, value People for; much leſs, that you who always paſs'd for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Woman, and a Woman of Senſe, could act ſuch a wild, diſtracted Part, as to come away for ſuch a thing as that, from the beſt Husband in the World.</p>

                  <p>I am amaz'd then, <hi>Siſter,</hi> at what you mean, by ſaying, I lay all the Fault on one Side.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, Siſter, if I do, it is from your own Mouth; but pray tell me any thing you have to ſay to your Husband, that you can charge on him as a Fault.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                  <p>Why did he let me come away? Why did he not oblige me ſo much, as to ſtay with me that Night when I deſired him?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>Siſter, if I may take the Story from your own Mouth, you acknowledg'd to me that he broke from you but for a Quarter of an Hour, to go down to pray with his Family, the Servants being call'd together, and ſtaying for him: Now this is the main Point again; <hi>He believes</hi> it is his Duty, <hi>you would</hi> have him omit it; his Conſcience tells him, <hi>he muſt not</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it; his Wife ſays, he <hi>muſt</hi> omit it to oblige her: In this caſe, I think I muſt quote ſome Scripture too, <hi>Whether it is meet for a Man to obey GOD rather than his Wife, judge you?</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                  <p>He might have oblig'd me for once, it had not been ſuch a Matter.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>Siſter, you and I have made a ſmall matter of Conſcience; but with Men of Principles and of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion it is quite otherwiſe; and I frankly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to you, they are in the right, and we are dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:1032900302:124"/>
miſtaken. I ſee it plainly now, Siſter; very plainly; a Man once touch'd with a Senſe of his Duty to his Maker, will, like <hi>Daniel,</hi> die rather than omit it: But you could not ſee into the Reaſon of thoſe things, and therefore took it unkindly of him; another Wife would have embrac'd, and lov'd him for it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                  <p>I ſee into the reaſon of it! No, not I, nor don't deſire to trouble my ſelf about it: But this I can ſee, I can ſee when a Husband carries it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligingly or brutiſhly.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>But, Siſter; do you really think that the little Unkindneſs you complain of, had it been real and unjuſtifiable in him, juſtifies your parting and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating from your Husband? can your anſwer it to GOD or Man?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                  <p>It juſtifies it to me and that's enough; I am accountable to no Body.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>I differ there from you too—You will find you are accountable to ſome Body: But to let that paſs, it cannot juſtify it to your ſelf, becauſe 'tis a Breach of your Obligation, without an Offence.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                  <p>Is it no Offence?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>It puts me in mind, Siſter, of what I have often obſerv'd in many Families, tho' I never expected to ſee an Example of it ſo near home; that indeed moſt of the Family Breaches in the World, are begun in the verieſt Trifles, the moſt ridiculous, ſimple, inſignificant Differences imaginable: Don't you remember our Neighbour, Mr. <hi>Bar—t;</hi> his Father, old Juſtice <hi>Bar—t,</hi> parted from his Wife, Mr. <hi>Bar—t</hi>'s Mother, about 20 Year before he dy'd, upon a Quarrel between them upon this fooliſh Queſtion; Whether ſhe would not lead him about if he ſhould be blind, when he was an old Man? <hi>She ſaid,</hi> ſhe would not: And, <hi>he ſaid,</hi> 'twas unkind. <hi>She ſaid,</hi> 'twas Work for a Servant. And, <hi>he ſaid,</hi> ſhe
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:1032900302:125"/>
did not love him; for if ſhe did, ſhe wou'd not truſt him to a Servant. And ſo one Word brought in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, the Devil blowing the Coals, till the Fire of Contention flam'd out: He ſtruck her in a Rage: She threw ſomething at him in the ſame Paſſion; and he growing furious, Curs'd her; and falling on his Knees, wiſh'd ſomething very terrible to himſelf if he liv'd another Day with her; ſhe lifts up her Hands and her Eyes and ſays, <hi>AMEN</hi> to it: and ſo they parted.</p>

                  <p>I think they were in the right of it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>Do you ſo, Siſter, I don't think you ſpeak as you mean; do you remember what ſad Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences it had upon the Family?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>

                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>I'll put you in mind of it then, Siſter; the poor old Lady was a good quiet minded Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and repented heartily of her Paſſion, tho' ſhe was not the Cauſe of the Quarrel; however, ſhe came to him and acknowledg'd her Fault, and beg'd his Pardon, and told him, ſhe was ready to do it on her Knees: That ſhe would come and live with him whenever he deſir'd it, but was afraid to preſs him to it, becauſe of the Imprecations he had made upon himſelf. At laſt ſhe dyed, and made a very penitent Chriſtian End, warning all that ſhould hear of her, to beware of raiſing Feuds in their Families upon ſlight Occaſions. The old Man had ſtood it out againſt GOD and Man till then; but hearing of his Wife's Death, and the Manner of it, went mad, and in one of his Fits, deſtroyed himſelf.</p>

                  <speaker>Siſt.</speaker>
                  <p>What's all this to me?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>I'll tell you what it is to you; 'tis a fair Warning, and indeed an Exhortation to you, not to lay a Foundation of ruining your Family, for ſuch little Quarrels, ſuch unjuſtifiable Things. I was but
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:1032900302:126"/>
a little Boy when old Juſtice <hi>Bar—t</hi> hang'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but I remember the People uſed to ſay, it was a juſt Judgment of GOD upon him, for the treating his Wife in ſuch a barbarous manner for ſuch a fooliſh thing, that had nothing of Provocation in it; and I think yours is really worſe. Here you are parted with your Husband, and have left your Family (and in Confuſion enough to be ſure) and all becauſe he ſtay'd a Quarter of an Hour away from you, when you deſir'd his Company; and this without allowing for the Neceſſity he was under, in Point of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to deny you that Quarter of an Hour: Without allowing for its being his Duty to go; and which is more, without conſidering, that it was your Duty to have gone with him.</p>

                  <p>All you ſay ſignifies nothing, he might have gone away afterward; 'tis the Unkindneſs of the Matter which made the Impreſſion; I hate him hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily ever ſince.</p>

                  <p>Do, Siſter; but remember, you will not be ſo well able to bear your own Reproaches, when your Conſcience, perhaps very late, ſhall come to tell you what you ought to have done; how you ruin'd your ſelf, your Family, your two innocent Children, and your Husband; and for what a ſordid Notion your Paſſions, aſſiſted by the Devil, carry'd you on to ſuch a dreadful Extremity: I entreat you, Siſter, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it, and remember, that tho' I have gone but a little way in my Reflections, <hi>I hope they ſhall encreaſe;</hi> yet 'tis the Anguiſh of my very Soul, that I have ſold my ſelf, as it were, to the Devil, for the moſt empty unſatisfying Things called <hi>Pleaſures,</hi> that can be imagin'd, and that in themſelves cannot bear the Name of Pleaſures: That to gratify the Madneſs of Youth I have given a full Swing to every Appetite, an unreſtrain'd Liberty to every Paſſion, and a Looſe to the wicked Guſt of an unbridled perverſe Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: If you were able to know, how loathſome theſe things look now, when I hope my Judgment is a little at Liberty to diſcern better, you would ſee nothing in all the Pleaſure of Life, but Madneſs, Folly, and a making ſad Work for Repentance: And let me add, Siſter, that 'tis my Opinion, that this is a great part of the unſufferable Torments of Hell, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that they ſee with dreadful Self-Reproaches,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:1032900302:128"/>
for what ſordid Trifles, what empty abhor'd and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous things, they have forfeited the higheſt Felicity, and loſt themſelves, Soul and Body, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. I am but a mean Teacher, Siſter, you have been a good Inſtructor to me, tho' you have no Senſe of it your ſelf; I pray GOD open your Eyes.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>The Siſter was partly provok'd and partly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this ſurprizing Diſcourſe of her Brother; and falling out into Tears, their Diſcourſe ended, and Sir <hi>Richard</hi> went away, going ſoon after to find her Husband, with whom he hop'd to have a long Diſcourſe, relating both to his Siſter and to himſelf.</p>
               <p>But he was diſappointed; for when he came to her Husband's Houſe, he was juſt gone away for <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> Sir <hi>Richard</hi> was ſo diſturb'd at his being gone, that he could hardly be perſwaded from riding after him; but the Servant aſſur'd him it would be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to overtake him, ſo he gave it over.</p>
               <p>The Servant wrote an Account of it to his Maſter, as is related in the former Dialogue; and that Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance added to his eager Deſire of coming Home, not doubting but ſomething extraordinary had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd about his Wife; and it was happy enough that he had theſe Apprehenſions, on account of what fell out afterward, and which ſhall be related in its Courſe.</p>
               <p>But Sir <hi>Richard</hi>'s Buſineſs was of another kind; we have ſeen what Diſcourſe he had been engag'd in with his Siſter; the ſerious and kind Arguings he made uſe of to move her to a Senſe of her Duty to her Husband, to her Family, and indeed to her ſelf; and eſpecially what Anſwers ſhe gave him: How profane, even blaſphemous; but particularly, taſting of a Mind perfectly deſtitute of the Knowledge of good Things, and of any Deſire to be inſtructed; contemning GOD, Religion, Duty, the Worſhip of GOD, or the common Regard to his Commands.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:1032900302:129"/>
Sir <hi>Richard</hi> was a Man as void of Religion as cou'd well be ſuppos'd of any Man bred up in a Chriſtian Country: He was a drunken, ſwearing, ranting Gentleman; a Man of Pleaſure; kept his Hounds and Horſes, lov'd his Sport and his Bottle, and had his Companions for the Purpoſe; drank hard, kept great Company; and, in a word, ſwam down the common Stream of Vice, as a Man that never look'd behind him. As to Religion, he us'd to ſay, he had as much as a Gentleman of 2000 <hi>l.</hi> a Year had Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for; he knew very little of it, and minded it leſs; nor was there the leaſt Concern about ſuch Things to be ſeen in the Family.</p>
               <p>But otherwiſe, he was a Man of a clear Head; underſtood the World and himſelf perfectly well; was, as is ſaid before, of an excellent Temper, eaſily reaſon'd into or out of any thing; very ſincere, and without any ill Meaning to his Neighbours; benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent to his Tenants; compaſſionate to all; and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, not from a Principle of Religion, but of meer good Nature.</p>
               <p>When firſt he took Notice of this Breach between his Siſter and her Husband, he was extreamly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd to make it up: But when he come to know the Reaſon of it, he was extreamly ſurpriz'd; his Reaſon dictated, that the Husband was in the right, that GOD was to be worſhip'd: and he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſh'd, that a Woman ſhould make it a Crime, or a Thing to diſlike any Man for: Devolving thoſe Things in his Mind, and being by the natural Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the Convictions which were offer'd by his Reaſon, led to take Part with her Husband; that Conſequence came back upon himſelf, and brought the Conviction cloſer to his own Caſe.</p>
               <p>Immediately after he came out of his Siſter's Chamber therefore, he went into his own Parlour, where muſing a while upon what they had been talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:1032900302:130"/>
of; Well, ſays he, it's plain my Brother is right, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>

                  </gap> thus for doing what every Body muſt own is <hi>HIS D<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>TY</hi> to do. While he revolv'd the Caſe thus in his Mind, the word <hi>D<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>TY</hi> ſeem'd to bear a kind of Emphaſis in it more than ordinary, and hung upon his Lips. She is a Brute, ſays he to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for it was his <hi>D<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>TY;</hi> he ought not to omit it to gratify her, for it was his <hi>D<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>TY;</hi> he muſt have acted againſt his Conſcience if he had done other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, for he knew it was his <hi>D<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>TY.</hi> This followed him ſo much, and the word <hi>D<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>TY</hi> lay upon his Thoughts ſo much, that he could think of nothing elſe; and ſometime after, taking a Walk in his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, he began to talk to himſelf thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let me ſee, I juſtify this Man upon the Foot of this Word D<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>TY;</hi> What is <hi>D<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>TY?</hi> And what <hi>Sence are we to take the Word in, as it is uſed in this Caſe?</hi> Do I underſtand it my ſelf? Then he revolv'd it in his Thoughts farther, thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Duty</hi> is a Debt, not of Money to be paid, but of Service to be done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Duty</hi> is a Homage; 'tis due from a <hi>Vaſſal</hi> to its Lord; a <hi>Subject</hi> to its Sovereign; a <hi>Creature</hi> to its Maker; and indeed from <hi>all Creatures</hi> to their Maker.</p>
               <p>He halted there; and with a kind of a Smile, but with juſt Reflection, added; <hi>Now I ſhall hook my ſelf in;</hi> I need not enquire much about it; <hi>I am ſure I have done</hi> none of my <hi>Duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I have paid</hi> no Homage <hi>to him that made me; I am an ungrateful, unthankful Dog to him that has given me Life, Eſtate, and every thing I have in the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I have liv'd as if there was nothing due from me,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am a Gentleman. Well, ſays he, <hi>I love my Brother —; tho' I do not do</hi> my <hi>D<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>TY, I muſt acknowledge he does</hi> his, <hi>and I can't but value him for it;</hi> and <hi>that Brute my Siſter, what can ſhe be made of, that</hi>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:1032900302:131"/>
                  <hi>ſhe ſhould break with him for that</hi> which he does, and which we all <hi>ought to bluſh for</hi> not doing; <hi>I'll go and talk to her about it again, ſure I ſhall make her change her mad Reſolutions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All this was upon the Diſcourſe already related; and he had by this little turning the Thing in his Thoughts, mightily poſſeſs'd himſelf with the Notion of our Serving and Worſhipping GOD, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Homage due to him, and a Debt moſt reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be paid.</p>
               <p>The Power of Natural Religion having gone thus far, he was prepar'd by it to have an aweful Reverence for the ſerious Part of Religion, and a Love to thoſe that practiſed it; and we have ſeen ſince, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs and Wickedneſs of his Siſter brought him to a Horror of her Practice; eſpecially that kind of triumphing in Sin, which both ſhe and he too had been always guilty of before; it's true, he was not yet brought to a Senſe of the Nature of ſinning againſt GOD, the Offence againſt Divine Love, the inſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sovereign Mercy, and acting in Rebellion to the Dominion of Grace in the Heart: In a Word, he was not come to the two great Fundamentals of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Faith and Repentance; but we ſhall ſoon ſee him advance.</p>
               <p>The wicked and blaſphemous Anſwers his Siſter gave to every thing that he offer'd to ſay in Defence of Religion; fill'd him with Horror; his Soul abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated to ſee Religion, the Name and Worſhip of GOD made a Jeſt, and the Honour due to GOD his Maker treated with Contempt; and yet he own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf to be a Creature void of all Religion him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; it was true, that the pleading for Religion was perfectly caſual to him, but his Reaſon told him he was right: And it was a Shock to his very Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding at laſt to think, that he was then ſtrong pleading for what he did not practiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:1032900302:132"/>
Wherefore it often retorted upon him, even in their very Diſcourſe, <hi>I am telling her of D<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>TY, what is her D<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>TY,</hi> and <hi>of her Husband doing his D<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>TY: But what is my D<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>TY? And why do I not enquire a little</hi> about that? This Reflection brought that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion again from him, mention'd a little before, p. 108. when he told her ſhe had been preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, and her Words were as good as a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; for, ſays he, <hi>you have expoſed the Folly and Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of an irreligious Converſation ſo much, by your Way of practiſing it, that I reſolve from this Time to amend my Life,</hi> &amp;c. And this he repeated often to himſelf.</p>
               <p>This I may venture to call a full Conviction; and ſhe gave him abundance of other Occaſions to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe it ſeveral Times after the firſt; for ſhe talk'd ſo profanely and had ſuch horrid Expreſſions, that I have not thought it proper to leave them upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, or to acquaint the Mouths of <hi>young Readers</hi> eſpecially, with the very Sound of the Words; it's enough to tell you, that ſhe ſtruck him with a kind of Terror, to hear her blaſpheme and inſult her Maker; and he was carry'd to that length by it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, as to deſire her, as civilly as his Paſſion would allow him, to leave his Houſe; telling her very plainly, that he could not ſuffer his Maker to be treated at that rate in his Hearing, or under his Roof.</p>
               <p>But the good Knight, for ſuch I may now begin to call him, receiv'd a Wound from her in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his Convictions, that had like to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Mortal to his Reformation, and to have driven him back to his former looſe Courſe of Life, merely by Deſpair.</p>
               <p>This was, when ſhe told him, upon his ſaying he would pray for her, that he might as well <hi>let it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone;</hi> intimating, that his Prayers would not be heard;
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:1032900302:133"/>
for, ſays ſhe, <hi>The Prayer of the Wicked is an Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> &amp;c. See <hi>p.</hi> 112. This Expreſſion, as it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd there, was a Stab to his Heart, and he ſtop'd in his Diſcourſe, look'd Pale, and his Siſter was fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, thinking he would have fainted. He recovered indeed, and talk'd a great while with her. But the Arrow was ſhot into his Vitals, and the Poiſon drunk up his Spirits; he haſten'd the Diſcourſe with his Siſter, and went away to have found her Husband, as before; and this was the reaſon that made him ſo uneaſy, when he found his Brother-in-Law was gone to <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Trouble encreas'd upon him ſome Days, and brought him to a dangerous Criſis; he began diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt his own Peace from the fatal Text, as he call'd it, which that <hi>wicked Inſtructor,</hi> his Siſter, had preached from; and he brought it to this dreadful Concluſion:</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">
                     <p>"I am a <hi>WICKED Creature,</hi> that's out of Doubt, never was a worſe, this wretched Branch of my own unhappy <hi>STEM</hi> excepted; <hi>WICKED</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond others; And to aggravate his Character to himſelf, he reckons up its parts thus: <hi>I am a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Swearer, a common Drunkard, a Blaſphemer of the Name of GOD, a Deſpiſer of all Religion, that have lived in the Omiſſion of all that can be called Duty, and in a general Neglect of Religion all my Days. If I am not included in the word WICKED, then there is no wicked Man in the World.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>"The Premiſes being thus plain, the Conſequence is upon me, my <hi>Prayer would be an abomination to GOD.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>"Why then, <hi>ſays he,</hi> I muſt not pray at all; and if I cannot pray, all my Thoughts about Religion are at a full Stop; I am <hi>juſt where I was</hi>—And here he mus'd a while.</p>
                     <p>"<hi>Juſt where I was,</hi> ſays he, <hi>and Where's that?</hi> A
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:1032900302:134"/>
Rebel to GOD, a Villain to a merciful Creator, a Reprobate condemned to be ſo ſtill; forbid to pray to that GOD for Mercy, againſt whom I have behav'd ſo wickedly; unworthy his Mercy, and ſhut out from asking it.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>At this full Stop, at this dreadful Period, this poor Gentleman was come; and having miſs'd his Friend, from whom he hop'd to have had ſome Comfort and Direction, he came back very melancholly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</p>
               <p>His Diſorder was viſible to all the Houſe; his Lady thought him not well; his Servants thought him out of Humour; his Siſter thought he was angry with her; <hi>which, by the way made a downright Quarrel afterward;</hi> when Gentlemen came to ſee him, he excuſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as indiſpoſed, juſt ſpoke to them, and beg'd their Pardon to retire; he went out no where; kept no Company; in a Word, he was given up to Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly and Deſpair.</p>
               <p>It continued thus with him ſeveral Days; during which Time he had no Aſſiſtance but from his own Thoughts, however he oftentimes argued ſtrongly with himſelf, that certainly it did not conſiſt with the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Nature of GOD to forbid Sinners to repent, and to forbid them when they were Penitent, to pray for Forgiveneſs. But ſtill as theſe were but Reaſonings within himſelf, and here was a poſitive Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, it overwhelm'd all his Arguments, and left him always in the utmoſt Diſcouragement.</p>
               <p>Poor Gentleman, he had had no religious Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to have Recourſe to; no Inſtructions of ancient Parents, which lie as a Fund or Magazine of Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and tho' they ſleep for many Years, yet often revive to the Conſolation and Direction of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning Prodigal; his Parents had been all like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who had bred him up as they had been bred themſelves, more to good Manners, than to good
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:1032900302:135"/>
Principles, more to Letters than to Religion. Nay, ſo ignorant and ſo remote had he been led on from any ſacred Knowledge, that the Scripture, which is the Treaſure of Wiſdom and Knowledge to the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, the Fountain of Comfort, and the Reſtorer of Life to the oppreſs'd Mind, had little Effect here; he had but little of it in his Head, and conſequently little of it could occur to him on ſuch a ſolemn and needful Occaſion.</p>
               <p>However, as when GOD will ſpeak to the Heart by his Spirit, he never wants a Miniſter, ſo it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened here; this Gentleman had ſome Books, but not many, and fewer ſtill of ſuch Books as were ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his preſent Purpoſe: But ruminating upon theſe Things one Day in his Cloſet, he found an old, torn, dirty imperfect Book, written by he knew not who, and perhaps ſcarce ever look'd upon in that Place for many Years, entitled, <hi>The Excellency and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſefulneſs of Reading the Scriptures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Author in purſuing his Diſcourſe, tells a Story of a Man who was made to deſpair even to Rage and almoſt to Self-deſtruction, by reading the 15th Verſe of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> I. and going no farther, when the very next Verſe would have comforted him, and did ſo it ſeems afterwards. The Words of the 15th Verſe are thus; <hi>When you ſpread forth your Hands, I will hide mine Eyes from you; yea, when you make many Prayers, I will not hear; your Hands are full of Blood.</hi> This put the poor Man, <hi>ſays the Story,</hi> into ſuch a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>age of Deſpair, that on a ſudden he threw his Bible into the Fire, and run about with his Hands lifted up in the Air, crying out, he was caſt off, was damn'd, was a Reprobate, and that GOD would not hear his Prayer if he went about it; and that therefore it was to no Purpoſe for him to pray at all. The Story was ſo appoſite to Sir <hi>Richard</hi>'s Caſe, that he ſtew to the Bible, and read the Verſe, with the four Verſes before it, which
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:1032900302:136"/>
are all to the ſame Purpoſe, and had almoſt fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame Snare the poor Man did, of whom the Story was told, for he could not with-hold his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: But ſtopping at the Verſe, ſaid to himſelf, Who can blame the poor Man? my Caſe is the ſame, juſt the ſame; and if this Scripture is to be believ'd, <hi>I am undone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He kept the little old torn Book in his Hand, and tho' he was under an unexpreſſible Concern, he was willing to know what became of the Man; when the Story goes on thus: A good Miniſter in the Neighbourhood coming to viſit him while he was in this Extremity, ask'd him from what Occaſion he had taken up his deſpairing Thoughts? <hi>From reading the Bible, ſays the Man; I wiſh I had never ſeen it. The Bible! ſays the Miniſter,</hi> that's impoſſible! Yes, yes, ſays the Man, 'twas from reading the Bible. It ſhall never be ſaid, <hi>ſays the Miniſter,</hi> that reading the Word of GOD ever made a Man deſpair; it has awaken'd and alarm'd many a Sinner, <hi>ſays he,</hi> but it always led them by the Hand to Comfort at the ſame time; and I am here, <hi>ſays he,</hi> to vindicate the Word of GOD from that Scandal, and do affirm that there is not a Word of Terror in the Bible, without a Word of Comfort near hand to it. <hi>Come Friend,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Where did you read? Nay, I know not,</hi> ſays the Man! <hi>What were the Words,</hi> ſays the Miniſter? The Man repeats the Words; <hi>Very well,</hi> ſays the Miniſter, <hi>come let me ſee the Bible. Nay,</hi> ſays the Man, <hi>I have not the Bible, it is burnt; I immediately threw it into the Fire, for I could not bear to read any farther.</hi> The Miniſter pulls a Bible out of his Pocket and gives him; <hi>Come,</hi> ſays he, <hi>let me ſee what were the Words you are ſo terrify'd with?</hi> Look there, <hi>ſays the poor deſpairing Creature,</hi> and turns him to the five ſequent Verſes of the 1ſt of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at the 10th. The Miniſter knowing the Place, ſtands up and gives GOD Thanks for vindicating the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:1032900302:137"/>
Honour of the Goſpel, in directing this Man to quote a Place ſo qualify'd to make good what he had affirm'd in Defence of the Goſpel of Peace; and pray'd aloud that GOD would open the poor Man's Eyes to ſee and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Comfort from the Promiſes, as well as to fear and be diſmay'd at the Threatnings of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; when he had ſaid this, <hi>Come hither Friend,</hi> ſaid he, look you here; Why had you not Patience to read on the three next Verſes, ſtay now and read them for thy Comfort, <hi>Ver.</hi> 16, 18, 19. <hi>Waſh ye—Make ye clean, put away the Evil of your Doings from before mine Eyes; ceaſe to do Evil,</hi> learn to do well. <hi>Come now, let us reaſon together, ſaith the LORD; tho' your Sins be as Scarlet, they ſhall be as white as Snow; tho' they be red like Crimſon, they ſhall be like Wool; if ye be willing and obedient, ye ſhall eat the good of the Land:</hi> Having read the Words to him, he added, Here's Comfort, if you can ſay you repent of your Sins and reform; <hi>Ceaſe to do Evil,</hi> and <hi>learn to do well;</hi> the Promiſes of GOD are pledg'd to you, that you ſhall be forgiven; and that <hi>tho' your Sins be as Scarlet, they ſhall be whiter than Snow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Story goes on thro' many Particulars, but the Sum of it is, that the Man was comforted, the Word of GOD and the Mercy of GOD vindicated, and a clear View given to every penitent Sinner of the Way to Life and Salvation.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Richard</hi> read this Story with great Satisfaction, and it kept his Mind in a State of Quiet, tho' not with any great degree of Comfort till his Friend came home from <hi>London,</hi> of which we ſhall hear farther in in its time.</p>
               <p>But to return to his Siſter; after the laſt Dialogue between Sir <hi>Richard</hi> and her, ſhe had made ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions in the Family, that had not been very o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliging; particularly ſhe had fallen out with Sir <hi>Richard</hi>'s Lady, which put an end to their Friendſhip,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:1032900302:138"/>
and removed her from the Houſe: The Caſe was thus:</p>
               <p>My Lady — was a quiet, peaceable, good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour'd Perſon; not over and above ſerious: but far from a deſpiſer of Religion; and ſhe coming in to her Siſter's Chamber, as ſoon as Sir <hi>Richard</hi> was gone, found her in Tears, as was ſaid before, when Sir <hi>Richard</hi> left her; it ſeems her Crying was the Effect of Rage more than Grief, at what Sir <hi>Richard</hi> had ſaid to her; and ſhe falls out with the Lady upon the Subject of Sir <hi>Richard</hi>'s ill treating of her; and, among the reſt, rally'd his being turn'd ſo Religious all of a ſudden.</p>
               <p>My Lady heard her peaceably 'till ſhe began to banter Sir <hi>Richard</hi>'s talking Religiouſly; when ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the following Diſcourſe with her.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady.</speaker>
                  <p>Indeed Siſter, I am glad to hear you ſay Sir <hi>Richard</hi> talks Religiouſly; I think it would be happy for us all, if we were more Religious than we are.</p>

                  <p>Indeed Siſter you have but ſaved me the labour of deſiring tha favour of you, for I deſire none of God's Enemies in my Houſe; you had been welcome upon any other Occaſion: I wiſh you Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and that you may know your own Intereſt both as to God and Man.</p>

They had not many more Words about it; but taking her Brother at his word, ſhe went away the ſame Day in Diſguſt, and not reſolving preſently whether to go, ſhe ſtay'd at a Neighbour's Houſe two or three Days; in which Time ſhe went once down to her own Houſe: She knew indeed her Husband was not at Home, but ſhe had a mind to ſee the Children and talk with her Nurſe, who it ſeems ſhe heard had been at Sir <hi>Richard</hi>'s.</p>
               <p>The old Nurſe was over-joy'd to ſee her, and treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her with abundance of <hi>God bleſs you's, Madam,</hi> as was the poor Woman's way; and it was believ'd, if her Husband had been at Home, ſhe might have been prevail'd with to ſtay; but ſhe broke away again, tho' the poor old Nurſe fell down of her Knees to her, to entreat her to ſtay.</p>
               <p>Being gone thus in a wild Humour, enrag'd that her Brother had, as it were, turn'd her out of Doors; ſhe paſſes by a good ſober Houſe in the Town, where ſhe might have been welcome, and would have had good Advice, and went to the Houſe of one of her old Companions, about two Miles off; who was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ten times more the Child of Hell than her ſelf.</p>
               <p>Here ſhe told her Tale, and had a She-Devil at her Elbow to ſay <hi>YES</hi> to all ſhe affirm'd, and <hi>AMEN</hi> to all ſhe reſolved; that prompted her to be worſe than ever the Devil, <hi>for want of an Agent,</hi> perhaps, had an Opportunity to deſire her to be; till at laſt, ſhe made her ſo wicked, that ſhe was frighted with her own Picture, and was brought to reflect upon her ſelf, and repent, by thoſe very Steps the Devil took to ruin her.</p>
               <p>It would be a ſad, and far from a diverting Story, to give an Account of all the mad Steps theſe two Creatures took together, I do not mean as to common Vices; ſhe was too much a Gentlewoman to behave her ſelf ſcandalouſly; nor was any thing of that kind
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:1032900302:142"/>
ever ſuggeſted, that I have met with. But her Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt at her Brother, her Averſion to her Husband, and her Contempt of all that was ſober and religious, was carried up by the Aſſiſtance of this Companion of hers, to ſuch a height, that ſhe deſpiſed all Advice, was deaf to the Importunities of her Friends, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of her Husband as ſhall be farther related pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently.</p>
               <p>This Companion of hers took that common, but fooliſh way, that many think the beſt Method of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliging their Friends, <hi>(viz.)</hi> of agreeing, and ſaying Yes, to every thing, Right or Wrong; ſhe had been intimate with this Gentlewoman from her Youth, and bred up juſt in the ſame looſe untaught manner; as to any thing religious, a perfect Stranger; as to Senſe, ſhe was <hi>like her ſelf,</hi> a Toy, gay and vain, empty of all that was Good; as fooliſh and as profane as her Heart could wiſh. Here ſhe was perfectly eaſy, for no Body was friendly enough to admoniſh her, or ſincere e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to adviſe her; and ſhe liv'd to ſee, and to acknowledge, how empty and inſignificant that Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is, that is not honeſt enough to bear, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enough to give Reproof.</p>
               <p>This She-Friend, among the reſt of her Follies, had accuſtom'd her ſelf to a moſt abominable Looſeneſs of the Tongue, and gave her ſelf ſuch a Latitude of ill Words, that ſhe ſcarce ſpoke ten Words without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixing ſome of them by way of Ornament; a Cuſtom grown up of late to ſuch a height, that it is become the Vice of our Converſation; while at the ſame Time it is ſo faſhionable too, that ſuch People think it adorns their Speech, and that their Language is not polite or genteel without it.</p>
               <p>Among the reſt of her fooliſh Phraſes, ſhe had this in particular, <hi>Poiſon it;</hi> or if ſpoken of any Perſon, <hi>Poiſon him,</hi> or <hi>Poiſon her;</hi> this was grown ſo frequent and ſo familiar to her Tongue, that it became the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:1032900302:143"/>
very Catch-word of all her Diſcourſe; nothing came without it, tho' in it ſelf an unmuſical, courſe, and odd Saying, ſcarce ever uſed by any before her: if her Coffee or her Tea was too hot, or too cold, 'twas always the ſame; <hi>O Poiſon it,</hi> 'tis <hi>naſty Stuff.</hi> If ſhe talk'd to her Servants, 'twas <hi>Poiſon them</hi> at every word, if ſhe did not like any thing: So that in ſhort, it run through all her Diſcourſe, and yet the fooliſh Creature had no Thoughts of ill, when ſhe ſaid it; meant nothing, would not have hurt any Body, much leſs <hi>poiſon'd them;</hi> but the Word had gain'd upon her Fancy, ſhe lik'd it for a Word to be toſs'd upon her Tongue; ſhe thought it ſat well upon her Speech; and in a word, ſhe had let it grow upon her to a Habit, ſo that it was meerly natural to her. Our unhappy La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy being now in the Family, they grew intimate to be ſure, and in their Converſation ſhe fail'd not to tell this new Confident all her Grievances; firſt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her Uncle, the good old Miniſter, and his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all the Houſe to Prayers. And <hi>you know,</hi> Madam, ſays ſhe, <hi>how I hate their Prieſt-Craft,</hi> and <hi>the wheed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ways that theſe Parſons take to make themſelves the Heads of Peoples Families, and to make us think them all Saints; yet as I expect to be the old Man's Heir, and he has a good Eſtate, what could I do? You know,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, <hi>a Body would not differ with an old Fool, and ſo diſoblige him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>NO, Poiſon him,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>one would bear any thing on that account.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then, Madam, <hi>ſays the Lady,</hi> he carried it on ſo long, that my poor Fool of a Husband, pretends to like it; and when the Parſon was gone, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to be Chaplain himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O Poiſon</hi> the old Fellow, <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> what did he ſtay ſo long for?</p>
               <p>Why, Madam, ſays the other, he was Lame of the Gout, and we could not be rid of him ſooner: Nor

               <p>She was ſurpriz'd very much, when ſhe heard he was below Stairs; and had ſhe not had the evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit at her Elbow in her wicked Adviſer, ſhe had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly gone down to him, and Home with him; nay, had ſhe done the firſt, ſhe could not have reſiſted the laſt; he had reſolv'd to treat her with ſo much Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and ſuch paſſionate Perſwaſions, that ſhe muſt have been a Tyrant to her ſelf, and a very Monſter of her Sex, if ſhe had refuſed him.</p>

                  <p>Yes, Sir, I come this Minute from her, and I am ſure my Miſtreſs would have come to you, Sir, at firſt Word, if that wicked Creature had not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred her.</p>
               </sp>
               <stage>It ſeems he had had an Account from ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body how Things went, and how he might expect to be treated; and that a Warrant from my Lord Chief Juſtice might be wanted: So he furniſh'd himſelf according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</stage>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Husb.</speaker>
                  <p>Well <hi>Suſan,</hi> I'll deal with her well enough; but in the mean time do you go up to your Miſtreſs, deſire her not to be frightned, I am not come to give her any Diſturbance; if ſhe would have been pleas'd to let me ſpeak with her, I ſhould have treated her very kindly: But ſince ſhe is prevail'd upon to be ſo unkind, I will offer her no Violence, though I have Power to do it, <hi>as you ſee;</hi> nor would I have meddled with this Firebrand if ſhe had not treated me rudely.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>
                  <hi>Suſan</hi> went up, but before ſhe came her Miſtreſs had heard what had paſs'd, and was in a terrible Fright; there was a Pair of Back-Stairs, and a Door at the Stair-head, at which ſhe might have got away: But the Door was lock'd, and the Servants were all ſo enrag'd at her, that though ſhe enquir'd of them for the Key, no body would give it her: So finding no way to eſcape, ſhe ſat trembling, and expecting every Minute her Husband, or the Conſtable, ſhould come up and take her away by force.</p>
               <p>But he had no Mind to expoſe her ſo much, nor to
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:1032900302:152"/>
diſorder her at all, his Deſign being to uſe all the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions and Entreaties he could, if poſſible to bring her to a kind and willing Complyance; ſo he went away, and bad <hi>Suſan</hi> tell her, he would come again another Day when her Surprize was over.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Suſan</hi> deliver'd her Meſſage with all the comforting Expreſſions to her Miſtreſs that ſhe was able. But ſhe had thrown herſelf on the Bed, and would not ſpeak a Word. So the Cavalcade ended; her Husband went away, and the Conſtable kept the Lady's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion in Cuſtody, and carry'd her away with him.</p>
               <p>She was now left alone, her Spirits were in a Flame, and ſhe ſeem'd to talk Wildly and Extravagantly, like one diſcompoſed in the higheſt Degree. Poor <hi>Suſan,</hi> though ſhe was diſmiſt, would not leave her in that Condition, but ſat by her all the Afternoon, and watch'd her all Night; for <hi>Suſan</hi> was afraid ſhe might do her ſelf ſome Miſchief.</p>
               <p>But alas, her Head run upon worſe things; the Devil had loſt his Agent, and was now fain to do his Work himſelf; and indeed, finding his Advantage, he laid hold of it: Her Paſſion, the Devil's beſt han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and by which he takes the faſteſt hold of us all, was in a violent Ferment; and nothing was ſo hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid but ſhe was capable to entertain a Notion of it, and approve it.</p>
               <p>The Object of her higheſt Averſion now was her Husband; the Affront offer'd her was ſuch, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could appeale her, nothing be a Satisfaction to her; the Sleep ſhe took in the Night gave no Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to abate her Fury, but ſhe meditated Revenge with an implacable and an unalterable Reſolution.</p>
               <p>While ſhe was thus playing with the edg'd Tools of her own Paſſions, dangerous Weapons they are! the Queſtion preſents to her Thoughts <hi>what ſhould ſhe do,</hi> once or twice, as ſhe own'd afterwards? The Devil prompted her to go home to him, and in the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:1032900302:153"/>
Night to ſet the Houſe a Fire. But ſhe had not Courage fot that. <hi>No,</hi> ſaid ſhe to her ſelf, <hi>uſing her Companion's wicked WORD;</hi> No, <hi>Poiſon him;</hi> I won't do that, I may burn the Children too.</p>
               <p>The dreadful Word which her profligate Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion had us'd without any Meaning, or at leaſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Thought of Miſchief, continually rung now in her Ears; it only dwelt upon the Tongue before; but the ſubtil Deceiver handed it into her enflam'd Inclination, and plac'd it in Ambuſcade there; it was for ſome Days working up to a height, the Words follow'd her like a Voice, <hi>Poiſon him, poiſon him:</hi> At firſt ſhe ſtarted at the Suggeſtion, and ſeem'd frighted at the Thoughts of ſuch a horrid Thing; but he that ſet it at Work, ply'd it ſo cloſe, that ſhe thought ſhe heard no other Sound for ſome time, but that, <hi>Poiſon him, poiſon him;</hi> and as her wicked Companion had made the ugly unſounding horrid Word familiar to her; ſo her new Tempter begun by degrees to make the Fact familiar to her alſo; and firſt ſhe por'd upon the Practicableneſs of the Thing, her Head run Night and Day upon the Methods of doing it, and of concealing it; ſhe found all eaſy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; he that prompted her to do it, preſented her with a great variety of practicable Schemes; ſo that finding no great Difficulty in the Thing, and that it would, as ſhe ſuppos'd, anſwer her End, ſhe came to a Point, and in a Word, ſhe took up the horrid Reſolution to <hi>POISON her Husband.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was not long after ſhe had reſolv'd upon this horrid Fact, but ſhe prepar'd for the Execution: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"And one Morning ſhe calls her Maid <hi>Suſan,</hi> and with a moſt compleat Face of Hypocriſy tells her, ſhe had conſider'd her Circumſtances, and found Things were run to ſuch a height, that truly ſhe was loth all the Fault of ruining the Family ſhould lie upon her; and ſhe could find in her Heart, if
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:1032900302:154"/>
her Husband and ſhe could come to any reaſonable Conditions, that ſhe might be ſatisfyed ſhe ſhould not be ill uſed after it, ſhe would go and live at home again.</q>
               </p>
               <p>O Madam, <hi>ſays Suſan,</hi> if God would put it into your Heart, I dare ſay my Maſter would do any thing you ſhould deſire of him.</p>
               <p>And will you go to him, <hi>Suſan,</hi> and tell him I deſire to ſpeak with him?</p>
               <p>Yes Madam, with all my Heart; I am ſure he will come.</p>
               <p>Well <hi>Suſan,</hi> to Morrow Morning you ſhall go.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Suſan</hi> rejoyces, and was ſo elevated with the Thoughts of it, that ſhe did nothing but cry for Joy all that Afternoon; but little did the poor Wench i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine that ſhe was to be the Inſtrument of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, to betray an Innocent Gentleman to be murthered.</p>
               <p>At this Meeting, and under the colour of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, did this enrag'd Woman wickedly reſolve to give her Husband Poiſon in a Diſh of <hi>Chocolate,</hi> and it ſeems had furniſh'd her ſelf with the Materials for that Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>It is hardly poſſible for any one that has not been engag'd in ſuch dreadful Work as this, to expreſs, or indeed to conceive of the Horror and Confuſion of her Spirits all that Day, and all the Night; neither her Reaſon, or her Affection, not the Natural Pity of a Mother for her Children, or the Tenderneſs of her Sex as a Woman, took any Place with her; but ſhe went to Bed, nay and to Sleep, with the helliſh Reſolution of deſtroying her Husband; and was ſo far guilty of intentional Murther, as it is poſſible for any one to be that had not actually made the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
               <p>She had not been long aſleep but her diſturb'd Imagination working ſtill upon the ſame Subject, ſhe dream'd her ſelf into the very Fact.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:1032900302:155"/>
She dream'd that her Husband came to her, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Meſſage ſhe had ſent by <hi>Suſan;</hi> that ſhe entertain'd him with a ſhew of Tenderneſs and Kindneſs; that he kiſt her, and told her, he was very ſorry ſhe would not ſee him laſt time he came; that he had reſolved to be reconciled to her, and that the Terms ſhould be her own, for he could have no Comfort or Satisfaction without her; that if ſhe was offended; he would ask her Pardon, and would abate all acknowledgment on her Part.</p>
               <p>In her very Dream ſhe fancy'd her Conſcience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd her with the reflection upon her Wicked Reſolution; and bad her ask her ſelf how ſhe could be ſo Treacherous to one, that after all ſhe had done, treated her in ſo obliging a manner.</p>
               <p>Yet it ſeems ſhe got over it all, for though ſhe did not dream of her actually giving him the Poiſon, and his drinking it; yet, at ſome diſtance of Time, for <hi>ſhe awaked between,</hi> ſhe dream'd ſhe ſaw her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and her Two Children lye dead upon the Floor, and that ſome body ask'd, How it all hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened? and a Servant that ſtood by anſwer'd, That no body could tell: When on a ſuddain, ſhe thought ſhe ſaw a black Cloud, and heard a Voice as loud as Thunder out of it, which ſaid, <hi>That wicked Woman, his Wife, has Poiſon'd him and her own Children, let her be taken, and let her be burn'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not to be wondred at if ſhe wak'd in a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Fright; ſhe skreek'd and cry'd in ſuch a manner that frighted all the Houſe; the Servants riſe and come to her, and an Ancient Woman in particular, that lay near her Chamber, came in firſt, and ask'd her, <hi>What was the Matter?</hi> When they came in ſhe was ſitting upright in her Bed, but Trembling and Staring in a dreadful Manner: However, it being ſome time after her crying out, before they could get out of their Beds to come to her, ſhe was tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:1032900302:156"/>
awake, and had recover'd her ſelf ſo far as to know that it was but a Dream, before they ask'd her what was the Matter.</p>
               <p>This gave her ſome immediate Relief, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly it brought her to ſo much preſence of Mind as to conceal the Particulars; and when they ask'd her what it was ſhe dream'd? She ſaid, ſhe dream'd her Two Children were murther'd: which was true.</p>
               <p>Though ſhe recover'd from her firſt Surprize, yet ſhe remain'd very ill all the Night, and all the next Day; and particularly was overwhelm'd with Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly, ſpeaking very little, and receiving no manner of Suſtenance: <hi>Suſan</hi> ſtay'd with her, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to divert her; but ſhe was capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving no Comfort from her, and often bid her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, and ſit in the next Room within Call.</p>
               <p>In thoſe Intervals when <hi>Suſan</hi> had left her, ſhe began to reflect upon her ſelf, and would fly out with ſuch Words as theſe; What a Monſter am I? What a length has the Devil gone with me! Murther my Husband! What, my own Fleſh and Blood! Nay, and murther my little dear Innocent Children! Horrid Wretch! <hi>It's True, I had not intended to murther them:</hi> But <hi>would it not have been murthering them, to kill their Father?</hi> It's true alſo, <hi>I have not murther'd him;</hi> but I had <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolv'd it, my Soul had conſented to it,</hi> and I <hi>am as guilty as if I had done it:</hi> Nay, <hi>I have been murthering him theſe three Weeks paſt, I have murther'd that Peace and Satisfaction which it was my part to preſerve and and encreaſe to him;</hi> I have tormented <hi>and griev'd his very Soul; I have kill'd all his Joy, all his Comfort that he was to have had in a Wife; I am a Murtherer every way, a vile abominable Monſter, and Murtherer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then ſhe gave ſome vent to her Paſſion by Crying; after which, throwing her ſelf on the Bed, and her Fright and Diſorder having kept her waking moſt part of the Night, ſhe fell aſleep, but in ſo diſorder'd

a Manner, and with ſo much Confuſion upon her Thoughts, that ſhe ſtarted every now and then, as if ſhe had been terrify'd with ſome Apparition.</p>
               <p>At length ſhe got up again, and walking about the Room, but ſtill confuſed with ſtrange Diſtraction of Thoughts; on a ſudden a caſual Storm happening abroad, it lightned, and a terrible Clap of Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der follow'd; ſhe was ſo frightned at this, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Relation it had to the other part of her Dream, that ſhe ſwoon'd and fell down on the Floor, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeaking a Word.</p>

                  <hi>Suſan,</hi> who ſat in the next Room before, but had come in while ſhe was on the Bed, run and took her up, and lay'd her on the Bed again; but it was long e're they brought her to her ſelf: When ſhe began to come to her ſelf, ſhe asked <hi>Suſan</hi> if ſhe heard the Thunder?</p>
               <p>Yes, Madam, ſays <hi>Suſan,</hi> it was a dreadful Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and the Lightning was ſo terrible, Madam, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> it frighted me out of my Wits.</p>

                  <p>Dear Madam, do not afflict your ſelf, and your Family, and more; will you give me leave to let my Maſter know you intend to come home?</p>

               </sp>
               <p>Honeſt <hi>Suſan</hi> ſent her Maſter Word of all that had happen'd, and of all the Diſcourſe, by a very truſty Meſſenger. But when the Meſſenger came to his Houſe he was not at home: <hi>Suſan</hi> uneaſie, for fear her Miſtreſs's Mind ſhould alter, pack'd up all their things they had, and ſending to borrow Sir <hi>Richard</hi>'s Coach, gets her Miſtreſs, who was now wholly in her diſpoſing, and carries her directly home.</p>
               <p>It ſeems Sir <hi>Richard</hi> and her Husband were gone to deliver the Wretch out of Cuſtody, who they had taken up, ſhe having humbled her ſelf, and promiſed to uſe her Endeavour to perſwade the other Lady to return home; and it ſeems ſhe came home to her Houſe juſt as <hi>Suſan</hi> was helping her Miſtreſs down Stairs. She ſent <hi>Suſan</hi> word, ſhe would ſpeak with her Miſtreſs before ſhe went: But <hi>Suſan</hi> bad the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant tell her, that her Miſtreſs had nothing to ſay to her. So ſhe came away, brought her Miſtreſs home, carry'd her up Stairs in her Arms, for ſhe was very Ill, and put her to Bed.</p>
               <p>When ſhe had done thus, ſhe ſent far and near for her Maſter, but he could not be found a good while, which perplex'd <hi>Suſan</hi> very much: But at laſt her Maſter came home, and Sir <hi>Richard</hi> with him.</p>
               <p>Her Maſter had but juſt Patience to hear <hi>Suſan</hi> tell part of her Story, and then run up Stairs to his Wife: She was ſo weak ſhe could hardly raiſe herſelf upon the Bed; but ſhe took him in her Arms, ask'd him Pardon in the moſt paſſionate Terms, 'till he could bear it no longer; and 'till he oblig'd her to ſay not a Word more of it. He told her, Sir <hi>Richard</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:1032900302:160"/>
                  <hi>My Dear,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>I am not able to ſpeak to him now; but tell him, I am ſenſible I have uſed him very Ill; and I will ask him Pardon, and my Lady too.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Richard</hi> would fain have ſeen her; but ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to be excuſed for that Night, for ſhe was very Ill and deſired a little Reſt.</p>
               <p>She was now brought home to her Family; but as this was not done 'till ſhe was touch'd from Heaven with a Senſe of her Sins, ſo it was evident in her, that the firſt Effect of real Conviction, is an immediate Return to a Senſe of Duty: She had broke over all the Obligations and Bounds of her Conjugal Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as a Conſequence of her Rebellion againſt God; and as ſoon as ever ſhe was ſtruck with a Senſe of her Sin againſt God, it carry'd her immediately back into the Courſe of her Relative Duty.</p>
               <p>We muſt now leave her for a while, and go back to Sir <hi>Richard,</hi> who was now as wonderful an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Grace of God, as his Siſter; and both of them firſt touch'd with a Senſe of their Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by the Deformity and odious Appearance of others worſe than themſelves; that is to ſay, he from his Siſter, and his Siſter from her abominable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Richard,</hi> as I obſerv'd, had been in a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable Condition upon the Occaſion of his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's caſting out a Text of Scripture in her Diſcourſe, which though ſhe deſign'd in a Banter, was made a terrible Text to him, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that the <hi>Prayer of the Wicked is an Abomination:</hi> From whence he fell, firſt, to examining his own Condition; and with too much Reaſon, to be ſure, concluded himſelf a wicked abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Perſon; and from thence he infer'd that he was forbid to pray to God, that his Prayer would but provoke God the more, and be an Abomination.</p>
               <p>I have given an Account by what Accident he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd ſome Comfort. But ſtill he was in great Pain

of Mind, and moſt impatient 'till his Brother in Law came home, who, <hi>as before,</hi> was then gone to <hi>London:</hi> As ſoon as he came, they met, and he unboſom'd himſelf to him, as in the following Dialogue.</p>

                  <p>That's very right, and I'm glad of it, for ſhe deſerves to be made an Example, on many Accounts. But what will you do with your Wife?

                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>You are right Brother; it's all want of Education, or rather the Fruit of that helliſh Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we were both of us bleſs'd with. Alas! Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, old Sir <hi>Richard,</hi> my Father, he is in his Grave; he was our Father, and we ſhould cover his Aſhes: But this was our Caſe, he never was the Man that ſaid a Word to us about Religion, or any Thing ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in his Life; he perfectly abandon'd us to Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Servants, Tutors and Chaplains; who rather gratify'd our Vices, to engage our Affections to them, than inſtructed or reproved us, when they found us do ill. We had, in a Word, no manner of Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but that of going to School at firſt, to do little more than Play and get bad Words.</p>

                  <p>Well, Sir <hi>Richard;</hi> Grace was promiſed, and is given to rectify Nature.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>Ay, come Brother, this is what I want to talk with you about; I have been educated as ill as my Siſter, and have gone as great a Length as ſhe can have done; what may I take my Caſe to be? You have hopes of her, but I have had ſad Thoughts about my ſelf.</p>

                  <p>Sad and ſerious Reflections are ſome of the firſt Diſcoveries of GOD's Grace being at Work in the Heart.</p>

                  <p>I wiſh you would explain your ſelf, what you mean by GOD's Grace, and by its Working in the Heart; I have had ſomething working in my Heart, but I cannot think it to be GOD's Grace.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>Becauſe it was raiſed there by a wicked Inſtrument; does the Devil <hi>think you</hi> work for GOD?</p>

                  <p>GOD can make uſe of what Inſtrument he pleaſes, and can make even the Devil himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental to his Work; but pray, what mean you by the Devil being an Inſtrument?</p>

                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, I have told you what I mean; how your Siſter's artheiſtical Carriage, and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous horrid Expreſſions made my Blood run chill in my Veins, and my very Heart tremble within me; In ſeeing her dreadful Condition, my own was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to me, and it made this Reflection in my Thoughts; Lord! what a Wretch am I? this Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and I am of one and the ſame Education and Growth in Wickedneſs, ſhe one way, and I another; it's evident, ſhe is ſet on Fire of Hell, and I am the ſame in Kind and in Degree too, only in another manner excited; my Conſcience bids me reprove her; but theſe very Reproofs turn upon me again, and reproach me with moſt of the ſame Crimes which I reprove her for.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>Nay, when I reprov'd her, and ſhe laugh'd at me, and told me, how odd, how abſurd it was out of my Mouth, and what had I to do to talk of Religion, it touch'd my very Soul; which anſwer'd, as it were within me, That's very true; <hi>What have ye to do to tread my Courts, or to take my Name into your Mouths?</hi>

                  <p>I cannot ſay I will prove it to be the Spirit mathematically, but I'll prove to you that it can be nothing elſe; <hi>Of our ſelves we can do nothing: Not I, but the Grace of GOD,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 10.

in the Hearts of Men: The original Love of GOD <hi>to us,</hi> in making us Veſſels of Mercy and not of Wrath; in ſhewing Pity and Compaſſion to us while we were yet in our Blood, and making us Heirs of Salvation: And then the Love of GOD <hi>IN <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> working our Souls up even involuntarily and without our own Agency, at leaſt without any that we can account for, to love him, drawing out our Affections, and engaging us to love him.

                  <p>Sir, this is <hi>indeed</hi> a Myſtery; and a Myſtery hid from Ages, but it is revealed to us by the Spirit of GOD: and this I ſhall prove to you very plainly by the Word of GOD, where the Myſtery of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is called a Diſpenſation of Grace; Epheſ. 3. 2. <hi>If ye have heard of the Diſpenſation of the Grace of GOD.</hi> Ver. 3. <hi>How that by Revelation he made known to me the Myſtery.</hi> Ver. 5. <hi>Which in other Ages was not made known to the Sons of Men, as it is now revealed by the Spirit.</hi> Here it is evident, the Myſtery of GOD's Goodneſs and Love to a loſt World, is call'd the <hi>Grace of GOD;</hi> the revealing this, is called <hi>a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of Grace;</hi> and the Revealer the bleſſed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, is <hi>the Spirit of GOD.</hi>

                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>But what is the Myſtery? You read there, that <hi>he made known a Myſtery,</hi> and this Myſtery <hi>is revealed by the Spirit;</hi> pray what Myſtery is that?</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Bro.</speaker>
                  <p>Be pleas'd to read on, Sir, Ver. 5. <hi>That the</hi> Gentiles <hi>ſhould be Fellow-Heirs, and Partakers of the Promiſe in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This was the Myſtery of the Goſpel, and is therefore called the Revelation of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel Grace. <hi>The Caſe was thus:</hi> The Promiſes of GOD were at firſt all made to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and they
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:1032900302:168"/>
underſtood all the reſt of the World to be excluded: But now when by the Coming and Suffering of Jeſus Chriſt, the Vail of the Temple was rent, and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration taken away, Men were call'd upon <hi>every where to repent,</hi> and were taught, that they ſhould be all equally made Children by Adoption, as if they had been ſo by Birth; and <hi>if Children, then Heirs.</hi> This was the Myſtery of the Goſpel, and was now laid open, and was <hi>revealed by the Spirit of GOD;</hi> ſignifying, that <hi>the</hi> Gentiles <hi>were made Partakers of the Promiſe in Chriſt, by the Goſpel.</hi>

                  <speaker>Bro.</speaker>
                  <p>Very clearly thus: That the Convictions of Sin upon your Mind, all the Reflections you make upon your paſt Life, be they occaſion'd by what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of Cauſes ſoever; all the ſecret Averſions and Abhorrence of paſt Follies, and every ſecret De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to alter, amend, and change your Courſe; every degree of Regret, Shame and Self-Reproach, which (as you will find) your Thoughts will be fill'd with on theſe Occaſions, are a Degree of the Diſpenſation of the Grace of GOD to you; revealed to, or wrought in you by his Spirit.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>And does this Grace and this Spirit work theſe Convictions, and theſe repenting Thoughts, and theſe Reſolutions to reform in our Minds, by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary Agency, and without our Concurrence?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Bro.</speaker>
                  <p>Dear Sir, let me be very cautious of running you ſo early, into thoſe dangerous Niceties and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions between what we can do, and our being able to do nothing. It is moſt true, that we can do nothing as we ought to do: But we are commanded to repent, to break off our Sins, to ceaſe to do evil, to learn to do well; theſe are all Scripture-Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and the Bible is full of them. Be it then, that the Spirit works this all in us, before we can do
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:1032900302:169"/>
any Thing, ot be it that our Duty and Endeavour is accepted, or at leaſt our concurring with his Work; certainly we are bid to work, to give diligent heed; we are called upon to turn to GOD, and to pray; and it is our Duty: Let the Operations of inviſible Grace be what they will, and direct how they will, we muſt be labouring and working, that <hi>this Grace of GOD may not be in vain.</hi> Nay, this very Grace of GOD prompts us to do thus, as is expreſly ſaid, Tit. 2. 11, 12. <hi>The Grace of GOD that bringeth Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, hath appeared unto all Men, teaching us, that denying <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs and worldly Luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent World:</hi> So that we are not allowed, on Pretence of the Spirit working all in us, to ſit ſtill and do nothing; this would be to <hi>ſin, becauſe Grace abounds.</hi>

                  <p>I begin to underſtand you, and what you ſay affects my Mind wonderfully; eſpecially when you put me in hopes, that theſe ſecret Struggles I feel, are from an Operation of the Spirit of GOD. But is that poſſible? Will the Spirit of GOD work ſuch things in the Mind of one ſo harden'd, ſo abandon'd to all that's wicked, as I have been!</p>

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:1032900302:170"/>
the Scripture full of Reaſons for this Method, of laying hold of the worſt and greateſt Sinner; <hi>the Whole need not the Phyſician:</hi> It's true, this is meant of thoſe who had Conceit of their being whole, as the <hi>Phariſee;</hi> but it reaches the Caſe we are upon: Chriſt came as the Phyſician, to heal thoſe who were moſt dangerouſly ſick; to juſtify ſuch <hi>Publicans</hi> as durſt not go up to the Temple to pray; to receive ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digals who were yet afar off.</p>

                  <p>None of all the Inſtances I have read of come up, in my Opinion, to mine; I have run ſuch a horrid Courſe of all kinds of Wickedneſs, that I ſee none of them can come up to it: I will not doubt but as you ſay, infinite Goodneſs can forgive more Sins than a finite Being can commit.

                  <p>You muſt explain your ſelf, I am as ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant in thoſe things as a little Child; and you ſee
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:1032900302:171"/>
I expoſe my Ignorance to you without any Scruple: You muſt talk to me as if you were inſtructing a Child; all my Infant-Work is yet to do.</p>

                  <speaker>Bro.</speaker>
                  <p>My Meaning is this: You have had Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon your Mind for ſome Time; you have been mov'd to reflect upon your ſelf for the Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your paſt Life; and to ſpeak of thoſe things you us'd to call Pleaſures, with the greateſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; and of your Delight in them with the greateſt Deteſtation: I do not doubt you were ſincere in it, you had no occaſion to be otherways with me.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>My Sincerity to you, I hope, admits no Queſtion; whether my Heart may not be inſincere and deceive me, that I cannot anſwer for.</p>

                  <p>That's what I'm upon; I ſay, <hi>Try the Spirits,</hi> whether do all theſe Motions tend? Do they carry you on to humble Repentings for Sin paſt, and holy Reſolutions for time to come? If this Work puts you forward to Reformation, to a change of Life, to a Love of the Name and Ways of God, and of the People of God; in a Word, if it apparently directs to Holineſs, it is the Work of the Spirit of God, there is no room to doubt it; 'tis a Diſpenſation of the Grace of God to you, by the Operation of the Spirit: It muſt be ſo, there is no other Influence either able, or by the Nature of things enclin'd to work in ſuch a Manner; and you have great Reaſon to rejoyce in it.</p>

                  <p>Alas! I rejoyce! is it poſſible for me to hope? and without Hope is there any rejoycing?</p>

                  <p>The lower you are in the Eſteem of your Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent Thoughts, the nearer you are to the Gate of Hope: Remember the <hi>Publican,</hi> he durſt not go forward to the Temple to Pray.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>There you touch my very Soul again: why that wicked Creature wounded me there ſo deep that it entirely robb'd me of all my Hope; ſhe was
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:1032900302:172"/>
a true Inſtrument of the Devil in that; for as he is in the worſt kind of Deſpair himſelf, he labours to puſh every one elſe into the ſame Condition; that in their Reflections upon Sin, they may commit the more; for I am very ſenſible 'tis a great Sin to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, 'tis a Diſhonour to the Power and Omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Divince Mercy.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Bro.</speaker>
                  <p>I ſuppoſe that was, when ſhe banter'd pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanely about your praying to God for her, and told you 'twould ſignifie nothing.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>That had been nothing; for what ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Words of a fooliſh enraged Creature: But when ſhe repeated that Scripture, <hi>The Prayer of the Wicked is an Abomination to the Lord;</hi> it was like a Dart ſtruck through the Liver. I knew that was the Word of God, tho' it was ſpoken out of the Mouth of an Evil Meſſenger; my Heart ſunk within me at the Words; I quitted talking to her as ſoon as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and while I did talk I hardly minded what I ſaid, my Thoughts were ſo harraſs'd; then I came out to ſeek for you, but you were gone to <hi>London,</hi> and what to do I knew not.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Bro.</speaker>
                  <p>I am very ſorry I was gone; but I hope the ſame Spirit of God, who was working Convictions in your Mind, gave you Comfort.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>Indeed Brother I receiv'd but ſmall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; I look'd upon my ſelf in the ſame Condition as King <hi>Saul</hi> was, when he ſaid, the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> were upon him, and God was departed from him; the Weight of my Convictions lay upon me, and I look'd upon my ſelf as ſhut out from the Gate; one whom God would not hear, as <hi>Saul</hi> ſaid; and that in a Word, that I was forbid to pray to him; and it wrought ſuch a Dejection upon my Mind, that I could ſcarce hold up; my Wife and all my Family took notice of it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Bro.</speaker>
                  <p>It was well no ſtrong Temptation preſented
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:1032900302:173"/>
while you were under thoſe Troubles.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>I ſuppoſe they were really Temptations, for I was often preſs'd in my Thoughts to give over my Concern about it, to go to the Tavern, or a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting, or a Hunting, and drive away theſe melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly Thoughts: But it was all like Muſick to a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful Heart, that ſerv'd but to make it more heavy; and I had no taſte of thoſe things, though they were formerly my greateſt Delight: But all that follow'd me during this whole time, was the Words of the <hi>Publican,</hi> whoſe Story you mention'd juſt now, and the Words would often break from me with a kind of involuntary Emotion, <hi>Lord be Merciful to me a Sinner.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Very well;</hi> and was it not the Powerful Grace of God <hi>think you,</hi> that preſerv'd thoſe Averſions in you againſt your former Delights; that took away your Taſte of thoſe Things, and the Guſt of your Appetite from your Pleaſures; that ſeaſon'd your Soul with Godly Sorrow, that by the Sadneſs of the Countenance the Heart might be made better? Dare you ſay that it was by your own Strength, that thoſe things which were doubtleſs laid in your way as Snares, proved no Temptation to you?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>My Strength! How is it poſſible that I ſhould have the leaſt Strength to any thing that is Good, who have given up my ſelf to all that's wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, through the whole Courſe of my Life?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Bro.</speaker>
                  <p>Very well. Then the Powerful Grace of God muſt have ſupplied you: Give him the Honour of his own Work; let him have all the Praiſe.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>How can I praiſe him, that cannot pray to him; that am not admitted to take his Name into my Mouth: Whoſe Prayer is an Abomination? Why he may ſtrike me dead if I ſhould offer to look up to him. How can I praiſe him?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Bro.</speaker>
                  <p>That's all a Deluſion of the Devil; and I muſt
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:1032900302:174"/>
ſay, 'tis one of his moſt old-faſhion'd Temptations. You ſaid, it came out of the Mouth of one of his Agents; did you not? Why ſhould you then ſuffer it to take any hold of you?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>It is the Word of God for all that.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Bro.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, ſo it was the Word of God with which the Devil tempted the Son of God; his ſecond Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was ſupported in that manner, <hi>For it is written,</hi> or, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord;</hi> which is the ſame Thing: But you muſt explain one Scripture by another, and take the Word of God in the General Meaning, as well as in the Literal Expreſſion.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>Theſe are things I underſtand not. Is not the Thing Plain? Are not the Words Expreſs? If they have any other Signification, let me hear it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Bro.</speaker>
                  <p>It is true, a wicked Man, while reſolving to continue in his Sins, his Prayer is an Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the Reaſon is evident: He mocks God, and the Word is expreſs in that, <hi>God will not be mocked;</hi> that is, it is an Abomination to him to be mocked, he will revenge it, and do his own Honour Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>Is this the true meaning of that Place; and how ſhall I be ſatisfied that it is ſo?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Bro.</speaker>
                  <p>By farther ſearching into the Scriptures, and by the general Purpoſe of God in the Goſpel. It is evident, the whole Scope of the Goſpel, and of the Diſpenſation of Grace, which I have mention'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is to perſwade Sinners to Repent and Turn to God. Innumerable Texts might be quoted to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you of this; but it ſeems needleſs: If Sinners are to turn to God, and yet are ſhut out from God, from praying for his Grace to turn them, and for his Pardon; how ſhall they turn?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>That's very true; but ſhew me ſome op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Caſe to this, that may overthrow the Force of its Literal Senſe.</p>

                  <speaker>Bro.</speaker>
                  <p>I'll ſhew you ſeveral; firſt, take the Story of <hi>Simon</hi> the <hi>Sorcerer;</hi> an eminent Caſe, and exactly the Oppoſite to what you are upon; <hi>Simon</hi> was <hi>a WICK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ED</hi> Man, that muſt be allow'd to an Extream, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what can be thought of here; a Sorcerer, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurer, one that dealt immediately with the Devil, of whom the Apoſtle teſtifies afterward, that he was <hi>in the Gall of Bitterneſs, and the Bond of Iniquity,</hi> and that <hi>his Heart was not right in the Sight of God.</hi> If any Man alive was in the Predicament of One whoſe Prayer is an Abomination, <hi>Simon</hi> was the Man: Yet obſerve what <hi>Peter,</hi> the bleſſed Preacher of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſays to him, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 22. <hi>Repent therefore of this thy Wickedneſs, and Pray God, if perhaps the Thought of thine Heart may be forgiven thee.</hi> Now Sir, what think you? May <hi>Simon</hi> the <hi>Sorcerer</hi> pray to God, and may not you?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>You have brought a ſtrange Caſe, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, and it grows upon my Mind, if I take you right, it is thus, then; That if I am convinc'd of my Sin, regret my paſt Life, and in a ſincere Abhorrence of my paſt Offences, reſolve to reform and become a New Man, I may be aſſur'd that I am permitted to pray to God; to ask Pardon, Bleſſing, Aſſiſtance, Support, and every thing that I want.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Bro.</speaker>
                  <p>You have ſtated it right, and I am ſure, I have the Authority of God's Word to confirm it: I'll give you the ſame Text which was mention'd in our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Diſcourſe, which you ſaid you found in the Book about reading the Scriptures, 1. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 15. There are 5 Verſes, from 11. to the 16. full of God's Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of, and Abominating the Sacrifices, <hi>that is,</hi> the Prayers of Men who continued in their Sins; the laſt runs thus, <hi>When ye ſpread forth your Hands I will hide mine Eyes from you; yea, when ye make many Prayers, I will not hear.</hi> This is a dreadful Scripture; what can be the Reaſon of it? the next Words explain it,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:1032900302:176"/>
                     <hi>Your Hands are full of Blood.</hi> This is plain, full of Sin unrepented of, and Sins to come reſolved on; to what purpoſe can ſuch Creatures pray?</p>
                  <p>But read the next Verſe, and there you ſee the Terms on which GOD is always ready to hear the worſt of Sinners; Ver. 16, 17. <hi>Waſh ye, make you clean, put away the Evil of your Doings from before mine Eyes; ceaſe to do evil, learn to do well: Come now, let us reaſon together.</hi> The meaning of this is as clear as the Light; come repenting, reſolving to break off from your Sins, and GOD will then accept your Offering: and then follows the gracious Promiſe; <hi>Tho' your Sins be as Scarlet, they ſhall be whiter than Snow, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>Dear Brother; bleſſed be GOD for theſe Scriptures, and GOD's Bleſſing be upon you for your clear and comforting Expoſition. Now I ſee my Way clear, I ſee the Gate of Heaven open'd, it muſt be my own Fault, if I do not fly thither for Help and Comfort; I am ſure I am a Penitent; for my Soul abhors the Sins of my paſt Life; and if he that has wrought this Part in me, will ſupport my Mind in the Purſuit of it, I hope I ſhall continue to abhor it. And this is what I ſhall pray for with as earneſt a Deſire, even as for Pardon it ſelf.</p>

               <stage>Sir <hi>Richard</hi> diſcover'd all the while he was ſpeaking, a ſtrange unuſual Satisfaction and Joy in his Diſcourſe; and when he had done, he embrac'd him very affectionately.</stage>

                  <p>I would recommend earneſtly to you, the Reading of the Scriptures, and ſearching for the Meaning and Coherence of every Thing, one with another. Study them, as well as read them; and as they are a Treaſure of Wiſdom and heavenly Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,

                  <p>I have a great deal of work to do, I have a wicked Heart to ſtruggle with and reform, wicked Habits to correct, a wicked Courſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation to change, a wicked Wife to perſwade and win over, if poſſible; a wicked Family to reform and correct: Alas! what Work is here for me to do, Brother?</p>

                  <p>But this is the Conſequence of <hi>late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> Brother; how happy are they, and how much leſs Struggle have they who look into their own Hearts early, and begin this Work betimes; ſo much earlier is their Work, and ſo much greater their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>

                  <p>That's very true, but you are not of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, you are but a young Man, not two and thirty; you may have many Days to live, and may if GOD pleaſe, be an Honour to his Ways, and be honour'd by him, to be a great Encouragement to others to look up to him, tho' it ſhould be later than you do it: I wiſh the eminent Appearance of GOD's Grace in your Caſe, may be made uſe of as a Summons to other Gentlemen, to turn their Eyes inward and ſee into their Follies, and into the wretched Life moſt of them live at this time.</p>

                  <speaker>Bro.</speaker>
                  <p>I hope you will not find ſo much Loſs in that as you may imagine.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>It's no Grievance to me at all, there is nothing in all the Mirth that I have been given up to, but what is now as nauteous to me as ever it was pleaſant. The Wit, the Gayety, and the Revelling which they uſe ſtill, and which was my whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy, is to me ſo diſagreeable, and has been ſo for this Week paſt, that I cannot bear the Thoughts of it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Bro.</speaker>

                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>I know not what I may attain to, as to the Comfort of a religious Life Brother, that's a very remote Thing to me yet; but I am ſure I have Work of another kind before me, I have Buſineſs enough to employ me more Years than I can life; to mourn for the Vanity and abhorr'd Practices I have liv'd in for thirty Years paſt.</p>

                  <speaker>Bro.</speaker>
                  <p>But that Affliction will have more Joy in it than all the Pleaſures of Sin, which are indeed Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of but a ſhort Continuance. There is a Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in Repentance, which none can deſcribe but they who have had the Experience of it, and which none can give but he alone, who gives Repentance.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>I know nothing of that yet, but this I know, I have more ſecret Joy in my Mind from this Reflection, <hi>viz.</hi> that a ſtop is put to that helliſh wretched Courſe of Life I have liv'd for ſome Years paſt, than all the Enjoyment of this World ever was
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:1032900302:179"/>
able to give; and I would not exchange that Joy for all that I can ſee with my Eyes. Methinks I am like one Shipwreck'd, and that being ſunk twice in the Water, is taken by the Hair of the Head by ſome kind unlook'd-for Hand, juſt in the Moment as he was ſinking the laſt Time, and brought up into a Boat and ſet on Shore.</p>

                  <p>I am like one taken off of a Rack, and laid in a Bed of Roſes; I never knew what it was to have the leaſt Enjoyment before, without the Gnawings of that <hi>Worm that never dies,</hi> without a Fire burning in my Soul, even the ſame Flame that ſhall never be quench'd: Do they call it Pleaſure! I am aſtoniſh'd now to think how I did to call it ſo my ſelf; for I had nothing but Bitterneſs and Reflection in it all. How often have I torn my Fleſh almoſt for Rage, at my being ſo much a Fool to be drunk, and for ſeveral other little Follies which thoſe Exceſſes were often attended with; and yet in all that, there was no Repentance; no Senſe of its being a Sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt GOD; no Thought of its being injurious to my Soul; no regard to its being a Fire, that in the End would burn into the loweſt Hell.</p>

               <p>It pleaſed GOD this Gentleman did not live many Years; but while he did live, he encreas'd in Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Knowledge, and the Fear of GOD; he reform'd his Houſe, brought up his Children in a moſt excellent and Chriſtian Manner, and made a moſt exact Regulation in his Family; and he did this with ſo much Conduct, and behaved to all Men ſo much like himſelf, and ſo far from any thing melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, phlegmatical or ſullen, which are the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes

               <head>Brief Notes on the foregoing three Dialogues.</head>
               <p>I Should make no Notes upon theſe Dialogues, the Book being ſo crowded that I can very ill ſpare Room for them, but I am aware that Differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Men and their Wives are ſuch nice Things to handle, that it will be very difficult to avoid the Cenſure of ſome People on one Side or other: The <hi>LADIES, if they are enclin'd to find Fault,</hi> will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſay, I am partial to the Sex, and give them the worſt End of the Staff, making them more the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of Family-Breaches than their Husbands; and making their Husbands treat them ſo much more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and religiouſly than moſt Husbands in ſuch provoking Caſes do; that it looks as if I was teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men how to manage their Wives.</p>
               <p>The Men perhaps may on the other hand, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, that I have treated them ill; which I ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in its Place, when I come to ſpeak of paſſionate Fathers and Husbands; which when the ſame Ladies read alſo, they will be leſs apt to think me partial.</p>
               <p>But to ſpeak to every Thing in its Place thro' this whole Part, it will be eaſy for an impartial Eye to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern the Deſign of the Work; which is this, and no other, <hi>(viz.)</hi> to let every one have ſomething for their own Caution and Direction.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:1032900302:182"/>
(1.) The wretched Trifles which are <hi>ſometimes</hi> the Occaſion of fatal Breaches in Families; how ſimply, how weakly, and indeed how wickedly ſuch People act when they run little Family Bickerings up by raſh and imprudent Degrees, from ſuch unforeſeen Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings, and by ſuch haſty and bitter Words, to real Quarrels.</p>
               <p>And (2.) how ſuch Quarrels, however ſmall in their Beginnings, are oftentimes fatal in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences to the whole Family.</p>
               <p>In the managing theſe Breaches will be diſcover'd, how particularly fatal they are to all Family-Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; how deſtructive to that moſt eſſential Part of it, I mean, <hi>Family-Worſhip;</hi> and how ruinous in the Example to Children, Servants, and all that are any way acquainted with, or concern'd in the Family: Theſe Things being not only the chief, but indeed the true and only Deſign of theſe Dialogues, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but hope that all impartial Readers will keep their Eyes principally upon that Part; and then they will not enquire which Side the Story bears hardeſt upon, the <hi>Man</hi> or the <hi>Woman.</hi> I hope both may ſee their Duty here, and yet before they come to the End of the Book, I believe the Women will find the Hiſtory will do Juſtice to their Sex too, and that it will appear, as I believe, <hi>(without Flattery)</hi> is true in general, that there are more religious Wives than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Husbands. I wiſh and pray, that what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated here may increaſe the Number of both.</p>
               <p>Another Inſtruction I cannot omit to repeat here, and to preſs Husbands again to obſerve it; <hi>and this I profeſs to be the true Reaſon of bringing the Story of</hi> two deficient Wives <hi>upon the Stage (viz.)</hi> that as it is true, that Husbands and Maſters of Families <hi>too often</hi> make uſe of Trifles as Occaſions to them to omit their Duty, <hi>SO</hi> they too often throw the Blame of it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Wives. Here <hi>now</hi> they will be mov'd to
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:1032900302:183"/>
ſee, (1.) That in the Caſe of real Provocation and Oppoſition, and that of the worſt Kinds, even of Wives deſpiſing and mocking at it, they are yet by no means juſtify'd in laying down and omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Duty. (2.) How much leſs then ſhould they ſeek Occaſions and Pretences to argue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out of their Duty, and load their Wives with the Blame, when indeed the Occaſion is in themſelves.</p>
               <p>But the moſt uſeful and moſt ſignificant Thing to be learn'd out of this Part of the Work, and which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually concerns both Husbands and Wives, is ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to avoid ſudden Cavils and Diſputes between themſelves about Trifles, in which often <hi>the Devil blowing the Coals,</hi> the Paſſions take Fire, and it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes to a terrible Flame; when perhaps neither Side had at firſt the leaſt Deſign or Thought of a Quarrel.</p>
               <p>I perſwade my ſelf, none are ſo inſenſible of the Truth of the Occaſion <hi>as to ſay,</hi> it does not often ſo happen: Perhaps in our Story, the Husbands are brought in talking more mildly and patiently than moſt Husbands do, and as ſome may think, than moſt Husbands can do in like Caſes of Provocation. <hi>B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T let none be offended at that,</hi> for this is ſo far from a Compliment to the Men, that it is really a Satyr up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; letting them ſee, how they <hi>O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>GHT to act</hi> in the worſt Caſes; and giving their Wives too much Occaſion to ſhow them the real Difference between what <hi>they do</hi> and what <hi>they ſhould do:</hi> And if on the other hand, ſome Wives here are brought in as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly and more than ordinarily provoking; the Application is ſtill againſt the Husbands, who too often are leſs patient, when their Pretence of Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation does nothing near come up to this Copy.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE liv'd in the City of <hi>London,</hi> a Family circumſtanc'd in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner: The Maſter of the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was a ſubſtantial trading Man, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the World, <hi>as we ſay,</hi> a Man in very flouriſhing Circumſtances, that got Money apace, and had the Proſpect of raiſing a good Eſtate for his Children, by his Trade; he had a very ſmall Beginning, but what he had was raiſed from little or nothing, being the Fruit of God's Bleſſing upon a great deal of Induſtry, and about 30 Years Application.</p>
               <p>He had been marry'd to a very good Wife: But ſhe dy'd too early to have any great ſhare in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation of her Chilren, the eldeſt being not above ſeven years Old when they loſt their Mother.</p>
               <p>The Man was a ſober honeſt Man, made an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of being very Religious; by his general Conduct had obtain'd a very good Character, and was well reſpected among his Neighbours: But in his
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:1032900302:185"/>
Family he could by no means paſs for a Man of the beſt Temper in the World: He was froward and waſpiſh, very poſitive and haſty, ſoon put into a Paſſion, and very unhappily raſh, and violent in his Paſſion; and, <hi>as to ſuch Tempers it often happens,</hi> he fail'd not oftentimes both to do and ſay Things in his Paſſion, which he would be very ſorry for when his Temper cool'd: When he came to himſelf, he was convinc'd, <hi>as we ſhall ſee in his Story,</hi> that he had taken wrong Meaſures: and that being hurry'd on by the Torrent of his Paſſions, he had been leſs a Man, leſs a Chriſtian, leſs a Friend, leſs a Neighbour, leſs a Parent, than he ought to have been; and in a Word, that almoſt all his Children were ruin'd, or injur'd, and he robbed of the Comfort of them, by the Miſtakes committed in their Education, and by the Heat of his miſguided Anger.</p>
               <p>Yet the Man was of himſelf, and when himſelf, an Excellent Perſon, extreamly affectionate and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; lov'd his Children, and meant every thing for their Good: But wanting Judgment to direct him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Government of his Family, not chooſing out proper Perſons to adviſe with in the doing it, and then being impatient in bearing the Excurſions of his Children, who, for want of early Diſcipline, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oon grew ungovernable: Theſe Things all conſpir'd to make him very unhappy, and his Children too; and his Unhappineſs appeared in nothing more than this, that none of his Children gave him any hopes of their Behaviour; nor indeed could they, unleſs they forc'd their Way, as it were, over the Belly of their Father's Injunctions, and ſeem'd diſobedient to him in his moſt Poſitive, and almoſt Tyrannical Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily Government.</p>
               <p>This Caſe before me, of the Citizen and his Family, had many Things in it very unhappy both to the Parent and to the Children, which a little early
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:1032900302:186"/>
Conduct might have prevented in both, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The want of a Mother in the Family, was a Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune both to the Father and to the Children; tho' as Things were manag'd, the Father ſupplied that Want as well as in ſuch a Caſe could be expected, committing his Children to a good, grave, ſober, and religious Woman, a near Relation of his Wife's; who was poor, and depended upon him, and who he pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in a kind of Superintendency over his Family, while his Children were very young.</p>
               <p>This Gentlewoman was diligent in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Houſe, as could be expected; faithful, frugal, and <hi>to the beſt of her Judgment,</hi> manag'd eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing both for his Advantage, and the Advantage of his Family. But as ſhe neither had the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, much leſs the Affection of a Mother; ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had ſhe the Temper, the Patience, the Concern, which are natural to the Conduct of a Mother; neither had her Authority an Influence upon the Children equal to that of a Mother; and beſides, ſhe was as Paſſionate as the Father.</p>
               <p>However, while they were little, Things went pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty well in the Family; ſhe took a Houſwifely Care of them as to Food, Cloathing, Phyſick, and the like: <hi>But alas!</hi> when we come to talk of the Duty of a Mother, in the more ſerious Part of Children's Education, ſuch as inſtilling betimes Religious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; forming early Ideas of the Nature of God, and of our Homage and Duty to him; the Power of Perſwaſion, to prevail calmly on the Minds of Children by Argument, ſuitable to their Capacities, and ſuited to their Temper; watching over them with an Affectionate Care, leſt they receiv'd Evil Impreſſions from the Company and Example of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; warning them, reproving them, reſtraining them, gently drawing them off from the Evil, and engaging them by all the Arts, and honeſt Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:1032900302:187"/>
of an Affectionate Mother, to what was their Duty; theſe, in which conſiſts very much of the Advantages of Education, were all wholly wanting.</p>
               <p>I will not ſay it was wanting from the Negligence of the Perſon, ſo much as from a kind of Natural Impoſſibility: Perhaps theſe things <hi>cannot</hi> be found in any thing but a Parent, as being built upon the Affections and Tenderneſs of a Mother only; and capable of being form'd upon no other Foundation than that of Nature, and natural Duty.</p>
               <p>On the contrary to this, the Children were brought up in a general Way, without much Judgment, and with no great Aſſiſtance from Affection. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a Man of Buſineſs, left it wholly to his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneſs, and found himſelf little concern'd, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any of her Complaints, to correct them; which he did in a Manner that ſeem'd rather to be the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of his Paſſion, than of a meek and calm Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for their Good; which is the main, and perhaps the only juſt End of Correction.</p>
               <p>This intemperate Conduct of the Father, had a double Effect upon the Children: (1.) that it cauſed them to hate the Government, and even the Perſon of their Houſe Tyrant <hi>(ſuch they call'd her when they grow up.)</hi> who they look'd upon as the malicious Cauſe of their Father's Anger, which often appear'd to be ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated by her Manner of repreſenting Things to him; when a candid and juſt Information, perhaps, would have had a different Effect. (2.) It made their Father terrible to them, by which they ſtood in a kind of Awe of him, far different from what was Filial, and which conſiſts with the Duty and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Children; but help'd to eſtrange them rather than engage them: And they grew up by theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to ſhun their Father as a furious dreadful Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, and not at all either to deſire or delight in him; which is the only effectual Method to enforce
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:1032900302:188"/>
the Commands and Inſtructions of a Father upon his Children.</p>
               <p>As this eſtrang'd the Children from their Father, ſo in increas'd his Severity to them; and in a Word, there was ſo little Calmneſs on one ſide, and ſo little Inſtruction on the other, that <hi>in a manner</hi> it wore out what we call Affection, on both ſides; eſpecially that endearing Part which alone unites the Souls of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and Children, and which ſo much aſſiſts in the Inſtructing of Children, as to give a far greater Force to the Words of a dear and tender Parent, to a loving, dutiful and affectionate Child, than can be poſſible in the Blows and Stripes of a Father govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by his Authority purely; for as <hi>Reproof enters far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into a wiſe Man, than an Hundred Stripes into as Fool;</hi> ſo doubtleſs the Perſwaſions, the Arguments, the Obligation of a Father to a Child, when once that Child is convinc'd that his Father loves him, acts for his Advantage, and aims wiſely for his Good on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, muſt go a great way farther with an Ingenious Temper, than meer Blows with Paſſion and Heat of Anger can ever do.</p>
               <p>The Father too late found his Miſtake, and that his Paſſion in Correcting his Children had quite ruin'd all that which was to be call'd Inſtruction; that they were rather terrify'd and frighted at his Fury, than influenced by his Perſwaſion: That this way of treating them was ſo far from engaging their Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to him, or making them love and delight in him, that it made them ſhun and avoid him; that his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger being ſo much their Terror, it made his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny their Averſion, and they were always mute when he came into the Room to them.</p>
               <p>By this he loſt all the Power of Inſtruction, his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments made no Impreſſion upon their Reaſon; his Perſwaſions were of, no Force to byaſs their Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; nay, it rather obſtructed their Compliance,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:1032900302:189"/>
and created an Averſion to the Precepts of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from the diſlilke they had to his paſſionate U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of them: As he had made his Paſſion the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of his Government, ſo their Fear was the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of their Obedience; and this was ſo far from winning upon the Judgment of his Children, that it rather ſtupifyed their Underſtandings, and made them incapable of getting Good by the Inſtructions of their Parents.</p>
               <p>It happen'd one time, that a good grave Chriſtian, a Neighbour of this Man's, coming by his Houſe, heard a terrible Noiſe of Blows, and the Cries of a Boy mingled with the Voice of a Man, threatning, calling Names, and ſaying on Blows in an unuſual Manner; and gueſſing what it was, for he knew the Diſpoſition of the Perſon, he knocks hard at the Door.</p>
               <p>Knocking at the Door gave the poor Boy ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, for the Father leaves off beating his Son, and comes with a little Cane in his Hand to open the Door, but ſo out of Breath that he could ſcarce ſpeak. The good Neighbour made the Diſcourſe of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Buſineſs ſerve for the Reaſon of his Knocking at the Door, and did not ſeem to purpoſe ſpeaking of the Caſe in Hand: But after other Diſcourſe acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental, the Father preſented him an Opportunity; for when he began to ſpeak of other Buſineſs, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to talk of his wicked Son, as he call'd him, and of his own Heat, thus:</p>

                  <p>Before I anſwer that, give me leave to tell you, that I diſtinguiſh between Anger and Rage; there is Diſpleaſure and there is Paſſion: I may be diſpleas'd with my Son when he commits an Offence; for no good Man but is diſpleas'd at every Thing that is ſinful; but when that Diſpleaſure riſes up to Paſſion, 'tis quite another thing; Paſſion is but a kind of ſhort Madneſs, and has no relation to the Duty of correcting our Children; 'tis a Frenzy.</p>
                  <l>Anger is Madneſs, and as ſtrong</l>

                  <speaker>Neigh.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, Sir, the End of Correction is to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Child, not giving vent to a Provocation; if you correct your Child or your Servant otherwiſe, you only gratify your Paſſion; you can't be ſaid to correct.</p>

                  <p>I am glad you put that Queſtion, for I think you do not know in the leaſt what it is. Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is ſhowing the Child our Diſpleaſure at his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: And this is done, Firſt, By Reproof. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Inſtruction. Thirdly, Puniſhment. For I take them to be all but Part of Correction. The Reproof is perform'd generally in Words of Diſpleaſure, in which we are particularly to take care to be angry, and ſin not: <hi>That is to ſay,</hi> ſhow your Diſpleaſure at the Crime, <hi>be angry;</hi> but let not that Diſpleaſure cun you out into a Paſſion, into Indecency and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,

                  <speaker>Neigh.</speaker>
                  <p>After the Reproof, Inſtruction is the next Duty of a Parent; which is no more or leſs than an Exhortation, which the Parent ſhould always give the Child to reform.</p>

                  <p>And do you think I can ſtand and make a long Story to him, to inſtruct and exhort, as you call it, when I am to correct him? Why, firſt of all, he is ſuch a harden'd young Rogue, he would laugh at it all; he would not mind a Word of it, no, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member a Word of it half an Hour after, but go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and mock at it, and do the ſame Thing again, till he forces me to make him remember, by his feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Smart of it.</p>

                  <p>I find you talk of your Boy, as if he had no Capacity of receiving Inſtruction; that he has no Senſe but that of Feeling; or Paſſion, but of Fear; and ſo you expect to reform him as you break a Horſe. Now I muſt tell you your own Alluſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides its being unnatural and unchriſtian, as to your Child, is againſt you too, even as to a Horſe; for you ought not beat a Horſe in a Paſſion any more than a Child; but with Management and Art, that he may be taught to know at the ſame Time what 'tis for, and how he may avoid it: And the ill timing of Blows by the Heat of Paſſion, even to a Horſe, makes him worſe, not better, and has coſt many a Man his Life. <hi>For Example:</hi> A Horſe ſtumbles per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps on plain Ground, the fooliſh Rider flies into a Paſſion; <hi>a Dog! a Toad!</hi> ſays he, <hi>What ſtumble upon ſmooth Ground!</hi> and then lays on upon the Horſe. The next time the Horſe ſtumbles, he runs away for fear of more Blows, and perhaps falls and throws his Rider, and it may be breaks his Neck. Pray who is to blame, the Man or the Horſe? And this Uſage teaches a Horſe to do it; ſo that ſome Horſes when they happen to ſtumble, they'll run forward let the Ground be proper or improper for it; and I tell you, many a Man has had his Bones broke by that very thing; I appeal to your own Knowledge.</p>

                  <speaker>Fa.</speaker>
                  <p>That's very true, I confeſs; I have obſerv'd it in a Horſe, but never with ſuch a Reflection as you make of it; but I own, it requires Judgment and Skill in breaking a Horſe, and to diſpoſe the Blows ſo as to bring the Creature to our Hand.</p>

                  <p>And much more ſurely in the Caſe of a Child than of a Horſe; Blows are to inſtruct, and calm Words with them help that Inſtruction, and ſometimes abate, if not totally prevent the Blows.</p>

                  <p>Why then you underſtand nothing at all of the Duty of correcting a Child; Blows have no Voice that a Child can underſtand, without having them explain'd: Whenever you correct your Child, you ſhould firſt explain to him the Nature of the Offence, lay before him his Sin againſt GOD, in breaking in upon his Duty to his Parents. The Sin of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Crime you have found him commiting, <hi>ſuppoſe of Lying,</hi> or <hi>Stealing,</hi> or <hi>whatever it be;</hi> you ſhould then with an affectionate Tenderneſs, tell him the Neceſſity you are in to correct him, to ſave his Soul from Death; how loth you are to do it; how ſorry to have ſuch an Occaſion; how fooliſh and unkind to himſelf it is to oblige his Father to do this, ſo much againſt his Will. Theſe Diſcourſes will ſink deeper in his Mind than all your Stripes, and to an ingenuous Spirit it will be worſe than Correction, and your Blows may be the fewer. <hi>For,</hi> as before, <hi>Reproof enters farther into a wiſe Man, than an hundred Stripes into a Fool;</hi> and it will be the ſame in a wiſe Child. Dr. <hi>Busby,</hi> the famous School-maſter of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> School, us'd always while he was correcting the Boy for a Fault, to ſay this Sentence to them, <hi>Caſtego te, non quod odium habeo ſed amem,</hi> I chaſtiſe thee, not that I hate thee, but becauſe I love thee.</p>

                  <p>I readily acknowledge that the Scripture

ſeems to be more ſilent in this Caſe than in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of like Conſequence; and yet the Scripture is not altogether empty of Directions: But it is true, that Children are ſo apt to lay hold of every Thing that they can but ſuppoſe abates their Obſervance of the Subjection they are commanded to be in to their Parents, that the Wiſdom of the Apoſtles was not a little ſeen, in touching more lightly than ordinary the Danger of Parents Miſtakes, in the Manner of their exerciſing their Authority. But, as I ſaid, the Nature of the Thing directs it ſo evidently, that there ſeems to be no Occaſion of inculcating it ſo expreſly; the natural Affection <hi>to,</hi> and the Concern and Care of all Fathers <hi>for the Welfare of</hi> their Children, makes it rational, that Correction muſt conſiſt with thoſe Tenderneſſes; and what Share have our Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in thoſe Paternal Principles?

                  <p>I cannot abate a Tittle: <hi>No Anger!</hi> no, not the leaſt in Correction; the Nature of the Office of a Father is inconſiſtent with it: It may be Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on indeed, but it is not Paternal; a Father's Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection muſt be all in Love, meer Kindneſs and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs; if one Spark of Anger be in your Breaſt, touch not your Child, at your Peril be it: For the Principles are directly contrary, and will claſh; and in a Word, cannot be conſiſtent one with another. Beſides, by being calm and cool in your Correction, you leave room for the Pleading of your Children; perhaps, ſometimes for a juſt Vindication, which in your Paſſion you will not allow: Perhaps ſometimes you may ſee leſs Reaſon for Correction than at firſt you imagin'd, and that the Blows might be ſpar'd; for Parents, like the great Parent of the World

                  <p>It is true, a Man may be ſo provok'd, that he cannot help being angry; but he can help corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting his Child, while that Anger is upon him; he may defer the Execution, when he cannot defer the Sentence. Nor can I ſay, but even that Anger which cannot be help'd or ſuppreſs'd is an Evil, be the Cauſe ever ſo provoking: But to go about to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the Child while the Fit of Anger is not off, is making that ſmaller Evil a very great one. I once ſaw a Father act in a Manner which I would recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend as an Example to all Chriſtian Parents: He was provok'd exceedingly by an inſolent and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Child in a trifling Matter, but to ſuch a height, as to give his Father very ſaucy and undutiful Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. The Father, with a Smile of Compaſſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Folly, return'd thus: <hi>SON, if I was not very angry with you, I would teach you better Manners this Minute; but I'll give my ſelf Time till to morrow.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to morrow, the Son relented, humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and prevented the Correction he would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have had.</p>

                  <p>I corrected him for ſtaying on that Errand, and for nothing elſe; and conſidering how often he had been corrected for the ſame Fault, I think he deſerv'd it very well.</p>

                  <p>So you will, and it's the mark of a ſerious Correction when the Parent is afflicted as much as the Child is corrected; that's a true Paternal Spirit; and I muſt tell you, there's a great many teaching Circumſtances in a ſerious Father's correcting a Child: When he is calling the Child to an account for his Offences, how naturally does it occur, that if God ſhould thus enter into judgment with us all, what would be our Portion! when he concludes that the Child deſerves Correction, it immediately occurs again, if GOD ſhould deal with us as we deſerve, how ſhould we ſtand before him! When he corrects, he remembers how GOD's Correction is leſs than our Iniquity deſerves, that there is no proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Crime and the Puniſhment! When the Child ſtretches out its Hand for Mercy and Pardon, how juſt an Emblem is it of our Penitent Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to GOD for Forgiveneſs of our Sins? I know nothing in the World ſo fruitful of profitable Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:1032900302:218"/>
as the Authority of a Father in Correcting, and the Compaſſion of a Father in Forbearing his Child. The Reluctance of the Mind with which we correct our Children, the Joy we have to find them Innocent when we fear them Guilty; alas, when Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion intervenes, all this is loſt; the end is deſtroy'd, the Child ſuffers, the Father ſins, and the Benefit of Correction is loſt entirely.</p>

                  <p>Poor Child! he ſat crying upon a Stone juſt without the Door a good while, and by and by it rain'd; and there he ſat till he was thorough wet, and till I cry'd as faſt within Doors as he did with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Doors; and I had no more Power to keep my Vow, than I had Power to refrain making it; ſo one wicked Thing follows another, and both gives us Occaſion for Repentance; and theſe Things break the Peace of my very Soul.</p>

                  <p>I'll tell you a ſhort Story, like yours; I knew a good Man, but ſubject to like Paſſions with you, that upon ſome unkind provoking Words of his Wife, went out of his Houſe, and wiſh'd it might fall on his Head if ever he came into it again. He had a Family of Children, to whom he was a render Father; neither was he an unkind Husband to his Wife, and ſhe was a very loving affectionate Wife to him; but a ſudden Breach happen'd: Nor was the thing about which it happen'd of any great Value or Conſequence proportion'd to ſo much Heat; but Words on one hand begat Words on the other, and both paſſionate at that Time; in ſhort, the Man went away, and kept away two Days, and ſo long his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt kept his Paſſion up. But when the Heat cool'd, and the Man conſider'd what dreadful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences to his Family muſt neceſſarily attend the keeping ſuch a Vow, he immediately came to this concluſion; I have ſinn'd greatly in making this raſh Vow, but I muſt continue to ſin as long as I live, if I keep it; I'll caſt my ſelf upon GOD's Mercy and ask Pardon for my Sin, and venture the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; for it is my unqueſtion'd Duty, not to caſt off my Wife and Children.</p>

In this Frame the good Man went comfortably, tho' penitently home to his Wife, who received him with the ſame Temper as he came in: I think I need ſay no more to your Caſe than tell you this Story, only add one Thing for your Obſervation; the good Man I ſpeak of was too ſincere in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, ever to make any more ſuch raſh Wiſhes: I hope you underſtand the Application of the Story, as well as the Parallel of it.</p>

her Conſent; that ſhe had given him an account already that ſhe could not marry that Perſon, and hoped he would not take it ill from her that ſhe could not do it. <hi>He minded little what ſhe ſaid,</hi> but about Eleven a Clock brings the Perſon up to her, and leaves them together. The Man addreſs'd himſelf handſomely enough to her: But ſhe, reſolving to take the occaſion to extricate herſelf, told him, <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'<hi>That</hi> ſhe deſir'd to be very plain with him, and hop'd he would not take it ill, ſeeing there was a neceſſity for it: <hi>That</hi> ſhe had ſome Reaſons why ſhe could not comply with his Deſire; <hi>that</hi> ſhe hop'd he would not deſire to marry her againſt her Will: <hi>That</hi> it was not any deſign to affront him that ſhe uſed this freedom with him; and <hi>that</hi> if her Father would have been pleaſed to do it for her, ſhe would gladly have been excuſed, but ſhe had no other remedy; and if he had any real Reſpect for her, <hi>ſhe beg'd</hi> he would not urge her Father about it any more; for as it was her ſettled Reſolution never to have him his preſſing her Father to it was to no purpoſe as to the thing it ſelf, and would only make a breach between her Father and her, which could be no Service to him; and with this ſhe related to him all that had paſs'd between her Father and her.</q>

                  <p>Why, his eldeſt Son was a young Man of very promiſing Parts, and an extraordinary Charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: As for the reſt of his Sons, <hi>for he has two more,</hi> who were then in his Favour; they were really worthleſs in their Qualifications, and the World ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected little from them, and indeed found little: As their Father was their Terror, when young, he was their Averſion when they were grown up; there was between them, neither Affection, Reverence, Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Society; they fear'd, and therefore hated him; they ſhew'd evidently that they had a Contempt of his Conduct, only an Apprehenſion of his Reſentment in point of Intereſt; and all this was the Effect of a furious, abſolute, raſh, paſſionate Conduct in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; the farther Effect of it you ſhall ſee after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>

                  <p>Truly the Caſe of the Eldeſt is ſevere e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; for tho the young Man <hi>is in the Wrong ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly,</hi> yet it is ſo viſible a Judgment upon his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that, as I ſaid, he may really read his Sin in his Puniſhment: The young Man was bred in a gentlemanly Manner by him, only with this Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that he was always ſo abſolute a Tyrant in his

Family, and made himſelf ſo terrible by his Paſſions, among his Children, that it could ſcarce be expected he ſhould ever have any Comfort in any of them; for he never taught them any Obedience but that of Slaves, I mean the Obedience of Fear; and this made them naturally Diſrepectful to their Father, when they came to be remov'd out of the Reach of that Fear; and tho this could not be, without manifeſt Breach of Duty in the Children, yet the Father had great Cauſe to reflect upon himſelf, and to reverence the Juſtice of that Providence which made his own unlawful Paſſions, as a Father, be the real Cauſe of the ſinful Diſobedience of his Children.</p>

                  <p>I own the Father is to be blam'd, but the Son alſo is inexcuſable; and I am the warmer upon that Head, becauſe I know the Example is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in its Nature; and if the Crime is not truly repreſented with the Fact, Children are but too apt to ſet the laſt up for an Example, without enquiring into the firſt. It is a certain Rule, and all ſober re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Children will adhere to and acknowledge it, that tho the Parent may fail of his Duty to his Child, yet that by no means diſpenſes with the Duty of a Child, becauſe the Child's Obedience is not found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Father's Conduct, but upon the Laws of Nature. A Son can never argue that the breach of Duty in his Father is a Superſedeas to his Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Obedience of Children to Parents is a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law; 'tis a firſt Principle, neither Humanity or Chriſtianity can ſubſiſt without it; nor can any Defect in the Conduct of the Father diſcharge that Duty; for this Reaſon I think this Perſon's Son inexcuſably to blame, whatever his Father's Conduct was; and, at the ſame Time, that we muſt condemn the Father's

                  <p>I am ſure my Account is right, becauſe I have heard both Sides. The young Man had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to Marry a certain Lady, whom he had lov'd for ſome Years. The Father abſolutely refuſed to give his Conſent, and charges him upon his Duty not to do it. The young Man tells him he will obey him, ſince he is ſo abſolute, tho he thinks it very hard, and ſuſpecting his Father deſign'd another for him, who he did not like; he adds to his Father, that if he will not let him have her he deſign'd to have, he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd he never will have any Body elſe, and that he will not Marry at all.</p>
                  <p>This enraged the Father to that degree, that he flew out into a violent Paſſion at his Son; told him he would renounce his Relation to him, that he would have nothing to do with as long as he liv'd; that he would not own him to be his Son, and that, if he beg'd his Bread, he ſhould not come to him for Relief; for if he did, he would charge a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable with him, and ſend him to the Houſe of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; and bid him go out of his Houſe.</p>
                  <p>The Son, as he ſaid, afterwards, <hi>for he repented of this Raſhneſs of his Temper,</hi> inheriting a Share of the ſame Paſſion from his Father, <hi>was ſo provoked too,</hi> that, according to his Father's Command, he remov'd the next Day in a formal Manner from his Father's Houſe with all his Books, for he was a Scholar, and whatever he call'd his own. His Father, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his Paſſion, ſearch'd his Boxes or Trunks, as if he had been a Thief; told him he did well to remove voluntarily, that he might not be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd to kick him out of Doors; that he would entertain no ſuch Rebel in his Family, tho every

                  <p>In conjunction with this Rebel, his other Son (and the laſt we have to ſpeak of) became a meer Rake, a common Scandal in his Morals, and extravagant to the laſt Degree. The two Sons held together, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Companions as well in their Vices as in their Behaviour to their Father; and to ſuch a degree of Stupidity did they bring him, that, in a word, they dipp'd deep into his Caſh to ſupport their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies: The youngeſt had the keeping of his trading Caſh; and it happen'd one Day, that his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther looking over his Caſh-Book, to ſee if there was Money enough to anſwer ſome Payment he had to make, found the Caſh-Book not ballanc'd, or made up, and call'd his younger Son to make it up.

No, ſays his Father, how much have you? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd him ſurlily, he did not know. Well, ſays his Father, go make it up and let me know. He ſhuffl'd it off a good while, till his Father began to be out of Humour; for he could be angry with him, tho he could not with the eldeſt: However, to be ſhort, the Caſe was, that the eldeſt had confederated with the other ſo far as to get about 600 <hi>l.</hi> of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Money away, and when it could be conceal'd no longer, he runs away from him.</p>

Storm of ill Uſage? I wanted to be both out of this, and out of the Way of that wicked Company that had been a Temptation to me: and this was it made me propoſe to my Father a Voyage to the <hi>Indies,</hi> in hopes, if ever I did come back again, to have been entirely free from both.</p>

                        <p>I reſolve, GOD willing, to live quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Life; my Father has taught me more by his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>govern'd Paſſion, and ill-guided Affection, than ever he taught me by Inſtruction in his Life.</p>

                        <p>Dear Brother, my Father's Weakneſs ſhould be our Affliction; I am ſure it is mine, and may be inſtructing many ways to us: GOD has many ways to teach and bring us to a Senſe of our Duty that we do not think of; natural Affection bids us Pity and Pray for our Father, and yet Duty and the Laws of GOD, bid us learn to avoid the Follies he may be guilty of.</p>

                        <p>Indeed Siſter, I never lov'd my Father before; I muſt own, I hated and deſpiſed him always till now; I thought his furious Paſſions were brutiſh and unnatural; his Treatment of us who were his own
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:1032900302:262"/>
Children, unreaſonable and unjuſt; that he did not uſe us like Chriſtians, much leſs like Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and that I was under no Obligations of Duty and Reſpect to him, for that very reaſon. But now I come to ſee this unnatural Carriage of my Brother, I ſee likewiſe my own Follies and Madneſs in other Things; I ſee it in that too, that I ſhould think, becauſe my Father is but a Man and ſubject to violent Paſſions, and perhaps ſuch as I may think Unjuſt, that therefore I muſt be a Beaſt, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw my Affection from him that gave me Being; That becauſe my Father is not a Saint, therefore I muſt be a Devil: My Notion of theſe Things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Siſter, are quite chang'd; I pity my Father's Infirmities, I am ſorry for his Provocations, and love him in a different Manner now from what I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood before. On the other hand, I think my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Conduct the moſt to be abhor'd of all that I ever met with; and I doubt not, but he will repent it, with a ſad Heart.</p>

                        <p>Dear Siſter, there goes a great deal more than moſt People think of to a true and ſincere Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and one thing is, to make Acknowledgment to the Perſons injur'd; I would, with all my Heart, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge all my undutiful, diſreſpectful Carriage to my Father; but he is of ſuch a Temper, that he
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:1032900302:263"/>
is not capable to receive ſuch an Acknowledgment; if I ſhould ask him Pardon, he would but Jeſt at it, and ſcorn me, and perhaps refuſe it, and curſe me; I am in ſuch a ſtrait I know not what to do.</p>
                     </sp>

                        <p>Why, you ſay you gave my Father no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation now.</p>

                     <sp>

                        <p>No, no, I do not mean this; I have nothing to ask Pardon for in this, for I gave not the leaſt Cauſe of Offence, much leſs did I give any Cauſe for ſuch bitter Words: But I ſpeak of all the formen Part of our Conduct, when my Brother uſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult him, and I too; I am ſenſible it was the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Thing I could be able to do, let my Father's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct be what it will; and I remember that terrible Scripture with many a terrible Reproach upon my ſelf, <hi>Curſed be he that ſetteth light by his Father and Mother:</hi> This is what I would ask him Pardon for; but there is no doing it.</p>

                        <p>But Siſter, what ſhall we do about this raſh, fooliſh Creature my Brother? I would fain prevent methinks, his Letter coming to my Father's Hands, as well for his own ſake, for I am ſure my Father will never forgive him; as for my Father's ſake, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it muſt needs grieve and exaſperate him to the laſt Degree; for I know how he loves him.</p>

                        <p>I do not ſee that's poſſible; for if any Letter be left for him, no body dares open it, and there is no knowing it from another: Beſides Brother, why ſhould you deſire it, you know my Father's preſent Diſguſt at you is, that he thinks you have been the

The good old Woman took this Opportunity of the good Diſpoſition he was in, to repreſent to him how much happier both he and his whole Family would be, in this Chriſtian dutiful engaging Treatment of one another, than in continual Breaches and Diſcontents; and particularly preſs'd him to conſider how ſinful, as well as how miſchievous to his Family, his own violent Paſſions had been, and in particular how far they had conbributed to the Diſaſters of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and the Diſorders of his Children, tho their Diſobedience was to be laid at their own Door alſo. He bore it with much more Temper than ſhe expected; and told her, with great Earneſtneſs, he was very ſenſible, that his ungovern'd Paſſion in the Conduct of his Children, <hi>eſpecially when they were young,</hi> had laid the Foundation of all the reſt; that it had deſtroy'd the Affection of his Children, and brought them from a filial Fear of diſpleaſing him, to a Slave-like Terror at his being diſpleaſed, which were two very great Extreams.</p>
                  <p>Why, truly, Sir, <hi>ſays the pious Woman,</hi> if I may be ſo free, and <hi>none of your Children being preſent to hear me,</hi> I fear it has; and 'tis a hard Matter for Children to think that their Paſſions ſhould have no room in their Conduct, as well as their Parents. And that, as your Son <hi>James</hi> ſaid <hi>very religiouſly,</hi> a Father's omitting his Duty gives no Allowance to the Son to fail in his Reſpect: 'Tis true, <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> Children ought not to fail in their Duty, on pretence of the Miſcarriages of their Parents; <hi>but it is true alſo,</hi> that few Children have ſo much Regard to their Parents, or Senſe of their Duty, as to conſider it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>adds the good Woman,</hi> Parents ſhould be very careful that they do not, by their Paſſions, put Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes into the Mouths of their Children, and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to reaſon them out of their Duty.</p>

                     <hi>Says the Father,</hi> I am convinc'd that I laid an early Foundation, in the Education of my Children, to have had them all Rebels, both to GOD and their Father, and now you ſee how they fly in my Face for it.</p>
                  <p>Here the good Woman took an Opportunity to ſpeak to him of his two other Sons; but there being no room for running back too far at that Time, ſhe let it alone for the preſent, but never gave it over, with the Aſſiſtance of their penitent Son, till the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was reconcil'd to them all; nor did it take up much Time, for ſhe follow'd her Diſcourſe, not only with religious Arguments, but with earneſt Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, till ſhe brought him to be very willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them; and ſhe uſed the ſame Earneſtneſs to perſwade the Children, and to convince them that it was their Duty to ſubmit to their Father, tho they were in the right. Thus ſhe happily brought about a perfect Reconciliation, and they are now a very comfortable, pleaſant Family; and I hear ſince, that even that wicked Creature, that uſed his Father ſo ill, has ſent over very penitent Letters from <hi>Jamaica, where it ſeems he went,</hi> expreſſing his Senſe of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude to, and horrid Treatment of his Father, and begging him to forgive him.</p>

                  <p>Yes, indeed, and that in ſuch a Manner as few Servants ever were; but I muſt confeſs, I believe, if all Servants in ſuch Places did their Duty like her, it would ſpread Religion thro' the World in a ſecret and imperceptible Manner, for ought I know, equal to all other Means that GOD has appointed for it.</p>

               <p>THE Gentlelman having in the foregoing Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, promis'd to give his Friend, at their next Meeting, the Story of a faithful religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Maid-Servant, the Father was very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient to hear it; and accordingly being met, as by their Appointment, the next Night his Friend began the following Relation, embelliſh'd with a great many uſeful Digreſſions, all fit to be apply'd the ſame Way.</p>
               <p>There was a Family, <hi>ſays he,</hi> in the Out Part of the City, of whom it may be ſaid, they were as odly circumſtanc'd for the Production of any thing proper to this Work, as any Family could be imagin'd to be.</p>
               <p>They were of middling Circumſtances as to Wealth, not conſiderably Rich, and yet far from Poor: The Father was of an Employment in one of the publick Offices belonging to Sea-Affairs, which, in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:1032900302:276"/>
of his Buſineſs, brought abundance of Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny continually to his Houſe, and that too, Company of the worſt Sort, as to Sobriety and Modeſty, as well in Words and Geſtures as ordinary Behaviour: This had a very unhappy Effect upon the Behaviour of his Children, made his Daughters bold and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and his Sons wicked; and even familiar with Vice, as ſuch ſort of People muſt be.</p>
               <p>The Family was as void of Religion, as it is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſuppoſe a Family can be in a Country where any thing of Religion is nationally profeſt. Their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation was ſo far from being religious, that it was ſcarce Sober; perfectly Prophane and Looſe; nothing of the Practiſe of Religion, no, not ſo much as the Show of it; for either Father or Mother were hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ever known to go to Church, from one End of the Year to t'other.</p>
               <p>The Sabbath-Day was generally among them a Day of Company and Diverſion, and they ſeldom din'd alone; after Dinner the Time was generally ſpent in drinking by the Father, and either in ſleep or walking in the Fields by the Mother and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: Now and then, by accident, or as Company came in and propoſed it, the Children might perhaps go to Church, but very ſeldom.</p>
               <p>Their Diſcourſe, as the Converſation of ſuch Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies generally is, was a meer Complication of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and Vanity, to ſay no worſe; a Collection of ill Language, Oaths, taking the Name of GOD in vain, and all kinds of looſe, leud, and wicked Talk.</p>
               <p>They had a Houſe full of Children, having no leſs than four Daughters and five Sons, and they were moſt of them grown up to be near Men and Women, except one Son and one Daughter; the Son was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three or four Years old, and the Daughter ſix; and it can hardly be doubted but the Children were all of them following after their Father and Mother,

as faſt as it could be imagin'd Children ſhould, who had no other kind of Education than the wicked Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of their Parents.</p>
               <p>The little Son was juſt entring upon the Stage of Life; could talk, and run about and play with Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours Children, which came to the Houſe. His Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caus'd him at firſt to be carry'd to School Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Afternoon, rather to be out of the Way, than that they ſuppos'd he could learn much ſo young.</p>
               <p>It was a little ſenſible Child for its Age, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny little remarkable Diſcoveries of its being more than ordinarily ſo, were every Day made by its Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Diſcourſes; which the Mother, tho a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man perfectly void of all Capacity of making juſt Obſervations from that Parents, yet, as Parents often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times tire us with telling long Stories of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs of their Children, when there's little or nothing extraordinary in them; ſo it was here; his Mother, who was mighty fond of this Boy, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually telling People one ſimple Story or another of the extraordinary Wit, cunning Queſtions, and apt Anſwers of this Child; tho perhaps, at that Time, little more than what was common. It was one Day, when, upon ſome particular Occaſion, they had an Entertainment of ſome Friends in the Houſe, that after Dinner the Mother was making her ſelf merry with this little Boy's Prattle, and asking him a great many little Queſtions, to divert her ſelf and the Company; and the Boy as inquiſitive as ſhe, ask'd many little Queſtions too, not much to the Purpoſe, but ſufficient to ſet the Mother, and thoſe about it, a laughing, which was all the Mother wanted.</p>
               <p>There was a plain, rough, honeſt and ſober Man among the Company, a Captain of a Ship; and he not ſeeing ſo much Jeſt in the Matter as the Woman made of it, the Mother was a little tart upon him, and told him, ſhe ſuppos'd he was none of the fond
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:1032900302:278"/>
Fathers: <hi>Yes, he was,</hi> he ſaid; <hi>but he did not ſee the Jest was worth ſo much Laugh.</hi> Juſt at that Moment the Child ſaid ſomething, or ask'd the Mother ſome Queſtion or other, that pleas'd the Company mightily. Why, Captain, <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> was not that a ſtrange Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion for a Child of three Years old? Madam, <hi>ſays the Captain,</hi> that is not all my Objection; but, if I may be plain with you, methinks the Child asks wiſer Queſtions than its Mother, pray why don't you ask him fitter Queſtions? O dear! <hi>ſays the Mother,</hi> I ſuppoſe you would have me ask him, who made him: He will learn his Catechiſe when he comes to Church. <hi>Says the Captain blantly,</hi> If he don't learn it at Church till his Mother carries him thither, it may be late enough. It's no great matter, <hi>ſays ſhe (with an Air of Prophaneneſs)</hi> whether ever he goes there or no; there's no great loſs in it. Like Mother, like Son, <hi>ſays the Captain, jeſting, but yet a little rough,</hi> he's in a fair Way to be a hopeful Man with ſuch Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. He may ſerve, <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> for a Sea Captain; he may ſoon have Religion enough for a <hi>Tarpaulin.</hi> Yes, Madam, <hi>replies the Captain;</hi> I ſuppoſe you'll teach him to ſwear by the Compaſs. The Boy look'd ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly upon the Captain, while he was ſpeaking, and without any Heſitation, ſays very gravely to him, <hi>I won't ſwear.</hi> The Captain was affected with what the Child ſaid, and particularly with the Manner of his ſpeaking of it; for on a ſuddain the Child turn'd from his Mirth, and look'd as ſerious and ſurly as could be; and the Captain asking him, <hi>What do you ſay, my Dear;</hi> he anſwer'd again as gravely, <hi>I won't ſwear;</hi> and look'd as if he was near crying; but the Mother carry'd it all off with Rallery and Jeſt at the Captain. Now Madam, <hi>ſays the Captain,</hi> there's more in that one Word the Child ſaid, and his Way of ſpeaking it, than in all that you have laught ſo much at. How fooliſh it is to talk ſo to Children! <hi>ſays his</hi>

                  <hi>Mother,</hi> why you'll make the Child cry, <hi>Captain;</hi> what do you mean? I ſhan't make the Child cry, <hi>ſays he,</hi> but the Child almoſt makes me cry; it's pity that Child ſhould not be taught; it grieves me for him: <hi>She banter'd him ſtill,</hi> O you are ſo religious <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> now you are on Shore, I warrant, when you are at Sea, you can thunder like a <hi>North Wind;</hi> what would you have me teach him at this Age? I'll venture a Wager, <hi>ſays the Captain,</hi> if you ask him <hi>who made him,</hi> he does not know. Come, <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> you ſhall ſee I'll try him, <hi>My Dear,</hi> ſays the brutiſh Wretch to the Child, (pointing to a little Kitten that he had been playing with) <hi>Who made that Cat?</hi> The Boy had taken in ſome little Idea's ſuitable to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, from what the Captain had ſaid, and had been very attentive to him; and when his Mother ask'd him that Queſtion, <hi>ſtair'd at her</hi> as if he had been frighted: What ails the Child, <hi>ſays the Mother?</hi> Nay, what ails his Mother, <hi>ſays the Captain?</hi> I never heard any thing ſo abominable in my Life; upon this, the Child fell a crying. The Mother, far from being touch'd with any reflex Thought upon what ſhe had ſaid, fell to work to quiet the Child; but ſtill ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the Captain with the ridiculous Stuff, <hi>as ſhe call'd it,</hi> of talking ſo to Children, and asking them ſuch Queſtions as they underſtood nothing of: Well, well, <hi>ſays he,</hi> you have ask'd him a wiſer Queſtion than any of them, and I think the Child has anſwer'd you as well. Nay, <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> he has not anſwer'd me at all. Not anſwer'd you! <hi>ſays the Captain,</hi> I think he has effectually anſwer'd. Why, <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> he did nothing but cry. Well, and what do you think he cry'd for, <hi>ſays the Captain?</hi> Nay, what do I know? <hi>ſays the Mother;</hi> you made him cry, I think: No, no, Madam, <hi>ſays the Captain,</hi> he cry'd to hear his Mother talk ſo prophanely. Was that it, <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> think you? You ſhall ſee, I'll ask him again and he
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:1032900302:280"/>
won't cry, and that will prove you are miſtaken. If you ask him ſuch a vile Queſtion again, <hi>ſays the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain very warmly,</hi> I am ſatisfy'd he will cry again, or GOD will put ſome Words in the Infant's Mouth to anſwer you; for out of the Mouths of ſuch as theſe <hi>he has ordain'd Praiſe.</hi> Nay, <hi>ſays ſhe, not at all touch'd ſtill,</hi> if you come to propheſy, Captain, we have an opportunity to know whether you are a falſe Prophet or a true. I don't Propheſy, <hi>ſays he,</hi> but I hope he will. I'll try your Gift, <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> and impudently ask'd the Child again, <hi>who made that Cat?</hi> The Boy did not cry, but ſaid nothing. The Captain look'd ſteadily on the Child, and the Child look'd ſteadily on its Mother. Now, Captain, <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> where's your Gift of Propheſy? You ſee he don't cry, nor he don't ſpeak; why don't you anſwer me <hi>JACKY? ſays the Mother.</hi> Let him alone, <hi>ſays the Captain,</hi> he is big with it, he will bring out ſomething preſently: The Child heſitated two or three Times, and then look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up in his Mother's Face, <hi>ſays he,</hi> very gravely, <hi>Who made you, Mother?</hi> The Captain pulling off his Hat, <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'Bleſſed be GOD, <hi>ſays he aloud,</hi> that has not left himſelf without a Witneſs againſt his Enemies, even in the Mouths that are not yet open'd.</q>

               <p>This Diſcourſe, as it may be well ſuppos'd, put all the reſt of the Company to a little ſtand, and the Mirth ceas'd with every Body but the Mother: <hi>But ſhe</hi> having not the leaſt Impreſſion made upon her, turn'd it all into Jeſt and Banter; and ſo the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation chang'd for a while, and the Captain enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd himſelf with the reſt of the Company. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd, he fell into Talk with a Gentlewoman, who was a Relation to the Family, who he found was much ſoberer than the reſt of the Company, and very religious; and they had not been long in Diſcourſe, but the Gentlewoman took Notice of his Battle with the Mother of the Child, and <hi>told him,</hi> ſhe thought
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:1032900302:281"/>
what he ſaid <hi>was very juſt,</hi> and ſhe wondred that her Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin was not ſtartled at what the Child had anſwer'd; for, <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> it was very ſurprizing. Alas! Madam, <hi>ſays the Captain,</hi> ſhe is paſs'd all that, and it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſhe ſhould be mov'd by any thing, till he <hi>that made the Child ſpeak,</hi> ſpeaks to her: But, <hi>ſays he,</hi> there is certainly ſomething extraordinary in that Child; and if it had pleaſed GOD it had been born in a religious Family, I dare ſay it would have been a very religious good Child. Well Sir, <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> but I hope you do not confine the Grace of GOD; there may be a Principle founded in the Heart of the Child, <hi>I hope,</hi> by inviſible Grace, without the Agency of Parents one way or other. That's true, <hi>ſays the Captain, ſhaking his Head,</hi> but how ſhall it work! a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Education, againſt Example, without Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, without Reproof, without Encouragement. <hi>O,</hi> Sir, <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> I do not ſay but the outward Helps are all wanting here: but we muſt not confine the Work of the Spirit of GOD to Means only; that would be, to own Religion to be only the Profeſſion of our Education, whereas that <hi>Wind bloweth where it liſteth.</hi> The Captain was greatly ſurpriz'd to find a Perſon of ſuch Judgment in religious Things in ſuch Company, where indeed he did not expect it; and was very deſirous to enter into farther Diſcourſe with her, about the Child and its Mother: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing retired to a Corner of the Room, he entred into a very cloſe Diſcourſe with her about it: <hi>He told her,</hi> that he was greatly mov'd at what the Child had ſaid; That he knew little of its Mother, having only come into the Family as his Buſineſs called him there. But you, Madam, <hi>ſays he,</hi> that I perceive are related to the Family, for they call you Couſin; and as I find, have a Senſe of Religion upon your Mind; methinks you cannot be without ſome Concern for this poor Lamb, which is to be brought up on the

very Borders of Hell, as I may call it. Indeed, Sir, <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> I have had many a ſad Thought about him. The Child has ſomething extraordinary in him, and that more than you have had Opportunity to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</p>

Grace, of which you were ſpeaking, Madam, who ſingles out the Object of Mercy where-ever he pleaſes; and it is a Teſtimony to the Divine Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of Religion, that it is not the Effect of Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, or of the Prejudices of Education; clamour'd into our Heads by Nurſes, and whipt into us by School-miſtreſſes, Mothers and Pedagogues while we are little, and then whin'd into us by the Parſons, as we grow up: That it is not owing to the Mechaniſm of the Spirit, working by the Artifice of Words up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Senſes and Paſſions; but that a religious Awe of GOD, a religious Abhorrence of Evil, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Rectitude of the Deſires and Affections may be, and oftentimes is, wrought in the Mind, not only where no Example, Inſtruction, or other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſion intervenes to attach the Mind; but even in oppoſition of the evil Examples of Parents and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructors.</p>

                  <p>We had a very pleaſant Paſſage with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that, the other Day: This <hi>honest Maid</hi> had been talking to him, it ſeems, about ſpeaking bad Words, and how wicked they were that took GOD's Name in vain, and mingled their Diſcourſe with Swearing and Curſing: The Boy too had ask'd abundance of pretty little innocent Queſtions of her, and ſhe was ſtill, buſy with him, talking to him of theſe. Things all the while ſhe was dreſſing him; when there came in two or three Gentlemen, I think they were Lieutenants of a Man of War, or ſuch ſort of People, to dine with her Maſter; and walking to and again in the Room where ſhe was, they diverted themſelves with talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the little Boy, and to the Maid; but mingled their Words ſo continually with horrid Oaths, Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and Damning, that the poor.

                  <p>She did it prettily enough, and ſo as not to offend them neither: They ask'd the Child ſome Queſtion or other, but ſwore ſo terribly, even while they were ſpeaking to the Child, that the Boy hardly knew what to make of it. The good Girl took the Opportunity, and ſaid, but very modeſtly, <hi>O!

                  <p>Why, no Body ask'd him a good while about that, till after he was quiet and merry again; and then jeſting with him, his Mother call'd him and ask'd him what was the Reaſon he would not go to Church?

Yes, <hi>he ſaid,</hi> they did; and he would not go to Church; the Maid preſently recollected the Paſſage, and told the Story.

it is from the Hand of GOD upon him; and that Providence has determin'd ſome thing extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary about him; and tho I am a perfect Stranger to them all, yet I cannot but be concern'd, that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Helps may not be wanting; I have heard what you have done already, and I do this to encourage you to go on.</p>

                  <p>Why, Sir, I am but a ſilly Creature; but
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:1032900302:296"/>
I'll tell you a Paſſage of my obſervation, and the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of it: I have taught my <hi>little Maſter</hi> to know his Letters, and ſpell a little, as well as I could out of my own Bible; <hi>for they have given him neither</hi> Horn-book <hi>or</hi> Primmer; and one Day, when they had dreſs'd him up in this new Habit, and made as much Game with him as they thought fit, they ſent him up to me to undreſs him: I happen'd to have a little Time, and I ſaid to him, <hi>Come,</hi> my Dear, <hi>will you ſay your Book now? Yes, Margy,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſo he calls me:</hi> So I took down the Book, and went to look the Place where I us'd to teach him; but the Book open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accidentally at another Place, the Child claps both his Hands upon the Leaves, as if he had been at play, and began to look upon the Book: <hi>No,</hi> my Dear, ſays I, <hi>that is not the Place;</hi> let me look your Leſſon. <hi>No,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I will learn my Book here.</hi> I would have turn'd it over again, but he would not ſtir away his Hands: <hi>Here,</hi> Margy, <hi>here,</hi> ſays he. <hi>What just here,</hi> my Dear, ſaid I. <hi>Yes,</hi> ſays he, <hi>just here, just here;</hi> and puts his Finger to a Line, as if he had known it: I was a little ſurpriz'd, becauſe I know he could not read a Word, nor know any thing of what was before him; but it came into my Thought that I would ſee what it was the Child pointed ſo at; for I ſee him ſo poſitive, that I ſay it a little ſurpriz'd me; but I was more ſurpriz'd, when I found the Words were in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 16. <hi>Woe is unto me, if I preach not the Goſpel:</hi> Well, thought I to my ſelf, this Child will certainly be a Miniſter.</p>

                  <p>She will have every Day new Things to lay up in her Heart, as well as theſe; for the Child is every Hour ſaying ſomething or other extraordinary.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, Madam, there is another Thing is yet more wonderful to me than all this, and that is, that ſuch remarkable Paſſages as theſe, in a Child ſo young, does not work ſome great Alteration in the Family: Why, ſuch a Child is enough to make a whole Family ſerious, if they were the prophaneſt Wretches in Nature before.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Couſ.</speaker>
                  <p>Really, Sir, it is ſo; but it has a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Effect here; the Mother of this Child is ſo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually harden'd againſt all manner of Conviction, that nothing affects her; and while it is ſo, how ſhould it touch any of the reſt of the Family?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>Certainly it will firſt or laſt.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Couſ.</speaker>
                  <p>I ſee no Signal of it; ſhe ridicules it all, and they by her Example; and if at any Time ſome of them are a little concern'd, it wears off again, as I told you of one of the Siſters; and the Mother laughs them our of every thing that is ſerious.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>'Tis a ſad Thing; but I cannot but think it will be otherwiſe at laſt; if this Boy proves ſuch a Preacher of Righteouſneſs to them, as <hi>he ſeems to be,</hi> it will certainly have ſome Effect upon ſome of them, one Time or other, tho it may not juſt now: Pray what ſays the Father to it?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Couſ.</speaker>
                  <p>Why really, Sir, the Father is Maſter of more Senſe, and more Modeſty than the Mother, or than any of the Children; and he is not ſo harden'd as they are to banter and make a Jeſt of Religion.</p>

                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>I think ſo of him, and that made me ask what he ſays to it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Couſ.</speaker>
                  <p>But then, Sir, you know his Infirmity, that he is almoſt always in drink.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, he is oblig'd to keep Company with theſe great Men, there's Admiral — and Captain —, and the Commiſſioners of the —, and he cannot get away from them.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Couſ.</speaker>
                  <p>No, indeed, his Servants are generlly fain to fetch him away Head and Heels, as if he was dead.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>He can have no room for ſerious Things, in ſuch a conſtant Courſe of a wicked Life, if he were never ſo well inclin'd.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Couſ.</speaker>
                  <p>Truly the Man has a Senſe of Religion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Mind at other Times, and he hates mortally to hear his Wife talk ſo prophanely as ſhe ordinarily does, and will often reprove her for it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>And how does ſhe take it?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Couſ.</speaker>
                  <p>Take it! truly ſhe does not take it at all; ſhe rallies him with his Drunkenneſs, and his Fits of Repentance between it; and then talks the more prophanely for his Admonition.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>Why that is the juſt Conſequence of a Man reproving Sin, that is not reform'd himſelf.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Couſ.</speaker>
                  <p>So ſhe tells him; and asks him how long his Fit of Repentance will laſt.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>Then I fancy he is apt to talk penitently when it is over.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Conſ.</speaker>
                  <p>Exceedingly indeed; he will call himſelf all the drunken Sots, and wicked, curſed Wretches that he can think of, the next Morning after he has been drunk, and repent, and cry, and beg GOD to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him; it is hardly to be deſcrib'd how he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves himſelf.</p>

                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>And makes a thouſand Promiſes that he will never be drunk again.</p>

                  <p>Ay, ay, and ſolemn Vows and Reſolutions; and I dare ſay intends to keep them too.</p>

                  <p>Two or three Days! alas, not through the ſame Day they were made in, oftentimes; if that wretched Company comes to him, or ſends for him, he will be as bad the ſame Night.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>Why does he not avoid them?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Couſ.</speaker>
                  <p>He often ſays he will, but he has no Power to refrain.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>And he is loath to diſoblige them; for they are People he gets well by, another way.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Couſ.</speaker>
                  <p>Ay, that's true; but there is a ſecret ſtrong Inclination within too, which bids him go, and not only ſo, but bids him drink when he is there; and this I look upon to be the worſt Part of the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the hardeſt for him ever to get over.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, but you ſay he does not do as his Wife does, at worſt; he does not contemn GOD and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as ſhe does.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Couſ.</speaker>
                  <p>No, indeed; on the contrary, drunk or ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber he abhors it in her, and can't abide to hear her talk ſo.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>And how does he carry it to this Child?</p>

                  <p>O he loves it moſt paſſionately, and loves it for theſe very Things that we are talking of; and often tells the Mother GOD has taken that Child from her; that ſhe is left to breed up all the reſt for the Devil, but that this Child will live to reprove her, and will be able to teach them all; and 'tis he keeps the Maid <hi>Margaret</hi> in the Houſe, the Mother wou'd have turn'd her away elſe long ago, for ſhe hates the Maid becauſe ſhe teaches the Child good Things.</p>

                  <p>I warrant the Father will be ſome Time or other reform'd, perhaps by this very Child.</p>

               <head>The Fourth DIALOGUE.</head>
               <p>THIS Diſcourſe ended here; <hi>Margaret</hi> went up Stairs with the Child, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain went away, and the Gentlewoman, who it ſeems lay in the Houſe that Night, went to the reſt of the Company; but <hi>Margaret,</hi> as ſhe was bid to do, laid up theſe Things in her Heart, and apply'd her ſelf with more Diligence than ever, to inſtruct and teach the Child; and particularly, ſhe brought him to be able to read very prettily, before any Body in the Houſe knew that he could tell the Letters when he ſaw them; for tho, as I ſaid, he was carry'd to School to an old Woman in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, it was more to be out of the Way, when they had any thing elſe for his Maid to do, than for any thing they thought he ſhould learn; and beſides, it was chiefly before <hi>Margaret</hi> came, that they ſent him to School, and he very ſeldom went afterward.</p>
               <p>As ſhe taught him to read, ſo ſhe taught him to know Things proper for a Child ſo young to know; ſhe fill'd his young Thoughts with an Awe and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence of GOD; a love of every thing that was Good and Religious; ſhe taught him ſeveral little Prayers for Night and Morning, and poſſeſt him with juſt Notions of it being his Duty to pray to GOD to bleſs him, and keep him; and that it was a wicked Thing to lye down to ſleep without kneeling down, and praying to GOD to keep him while he was aſleep; or to be dreſs'd in the Morning, without praying to GOD to bleſs him in the Day.</p>
               <p>She had before taught him to believe, that it was
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:1032900302:301"/>
a very wicked Thing to mention the Name of GOD upon common Occaſions; and that, when the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that play'd with him did ſo, they were wicked Children; and abundance of ſuch Things as theſe, ſuitable to the Capacity of the Child, and of his Years; and ſhe always obſerv'd, and it was an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to her, that the Child was ſo exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly pleaſed, and eager for her little Diſcourſes and Inſtructions to it, that it would leave its Play at any time to go up Stairs with <hi>Margy;</hi> and at other Times would hale and pull her from his Mother, or any Body elſe, crying <hi>Margy, Margy,</hi> up Stairs, up Stairs; ſo that <hi>Margaret</hi> never wanted Opportunity, and yet no Body in the Houſe perceiv'd it; for when ever the Child call'd <hi>Margy</hi> to go up Stairs, no Body would hinder her, ſuppoſing he wanted her on other Occaſions.</p>
               <p>While ſhe was talking to him one Day, of the wicked Children uſing bad Words, and taking GOD's Name in vain at their Play: The Child ſtop'd her; but <hi>Margy, ſays he,</hi> it is not a wicked Thing to call for <hi>O GOD</hi> when One an't well, or any thing hurts, <hi>is it not, Margy?</hi> Yes, my Dear, <hi>ſays</hi> Margaret, we muſt never call upon GOD but with Reverence, to help, and bleſs, and aſſiſt us, as you do in your Prayers, my Dear. Why, <hi>Margy, ſays the Child,</hi> won't <hi>O GOD</hi> come and help them when they cry out ſo, and they ben't well? <hi>No,</hi> my Dear, <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> if he ſhould, it would <hi>fright them dreadfully,</hi> not help them; and ſo ſhe went on to explain to him, as well as ſhe could get him to underſtand it, the Wickedneſs of that unhappy Cuſtom, which many People have of cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out <hi>O GOD!</hi> in their Pain, or upon any Suprize; and the Difference between that Way of uſing the Name of GOD, and an awful ſolemn uſing it in his Prayers; but ſhe could not make the Child a great while leave off joyning the Word <hi>GOD</hi> with the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:1032900302:302"/>
great O as one Word, and as <hi>a Subſtantive:</hi> So ſhe let him alone in that, as a Thing of no Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
               <p>But <hi>one Day,</hi> as he was liſt'ning very attentively to her, and ſhe talking of its being a wicked Thing for People to cry out <hi>O GOD!</hi> when they were in Pain, except it was in a ſolemn way: He ſays to her, But <hi>Margy,</hi> was it a wicked Thing when my <hi>Mamma</hi> call'd for <hi>O GOD?</hi> The Maid was at a little Surprize, for ſhe was loath to give the Child an Idea of his Parent's doing wicked Thinys; ſo at firſt ſhe ſaid nothing: but he was never to be left unanſwer'd in any Queſtion he ask'd, for he would not leave it; he ask'd her again and again, and then teiz'd her with, was it <hi>Margy?</hi> Was it? Was it? and would not be put by. At laſt, the Maid was forc'd to ſay, <hi>Yes it was indeed.</hi> At which the Child fell a crying.</p>
               <p>It was ſome Time after this, that his Mother had another Fit of the Cholick, as it ſeems ſhe frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had, and was in great Pain; and the Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man their Couſin, who we have mention'd before, was ſent for, as ſhe uſually was on thoſe Occaſions, to be aſſiſting to her: And ſtill when the Pains of the Cholick affected her Nerves, and made her ſtart, or grip'd her Stomach, as 'tis known is the Caſe in that violent Diſtemper, ſhe, according to her profane Uſage, ſtill cried out <hi>O GOD!</hi> And once in particular, having more Pain than ordinary, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated it four times together, without any other Words, as faſt as her Tongue could ſpeak it: The Child was in the Chamber, but was at play at a Window on the other ſide of the Room, a good way from her. When he firſt heard his Mother cry out <hi>O God,</hi> he ſtop'd his Play, and turning about, ſtood ſtock ſtill, looking very gravely at his Mother; But when he heard her repeat the Words four times
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:1032900302:303"/>
together in a kind of a Paſſion, <hi>as above,</hi> he ran to the Bed ſide to her; <hi>MAMMA! ſaid he;</hi> what d'ye ſay? ſays his Mother, <hi>Don't call O GOD Mamma,</hi> ſays the Child; why, ſays his Mother, what's the Matter? Why, <hi>he won't come Mamma,</hi> ſays the Child: Won't he Sirrah, <hi>ſays his Mother,</hi> how do you know he won't? The Boy ſtood ſtill a good while, hammering his Thoughts to bring out what he had in his Mind; at laſt, ſays he, <hi>If O GOD ſhould come,</hi> Mamma, <hi>you would be afraid.</hi> Well, and would not you he afraid too? ſays his Mother: <hi>Yes, Mamma,</hi> ſays the Child: And mus'd a while, and then brings it out, <hi>A-but I don't call him Mamma:</hi> The Mother, had ſhe had a Heart leſs obſtinate and inſenſible than an Idiot, would have been mov'd with it; but ſhe put it off and ſpoke angrily to the Child, to be rid of him: However, he was not to be put off, neither with good Words or bad; but after a little Stop, he falls to it again. <hi>Mamma,</hi> ſays he, <hi>don't call O GOD, no more, Mamma.</hi> Well, well, ſays his Mother, be quiet. <hi>Won't you then,</hi> Mamma, <hi>ſays the Boy?</hi> She would not promiſe a great while; but the Boy pull'd her, and teiz'd her with, <hi>Won't you,</hi> Mamma, <hi>Won't you,</hi> Mamma? At laſt, to be rid of him, ſhe ſaid, <hi>Well, I won't then.</hi> No more, <hi>Mamma?</hi> ſays the Boy. Well, <hi>no more</hi> then, ſays his Mother. <hi>Never no more,</hi> Mamma? ſays the Boy: The Boy's mad, I think, <hi>ſays his Mother;</hi> take him away a little ſome body; where's his Maid? Well, the Boy would not be taken away till ſhe had ſaid, <hi>Never no more;</hi> and then he went away quietly.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the Boy was gone, the good Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who was by, burſt out into Tears, ſhe could hold no longer. <hi>Couſin,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>are you not at all concern'd at what this little Child has ſaid to you.</hi> No not I, <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> what ſhould I be concern'd at it for? I don't mind ſuch Prattle; what ſignifies what Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:1032900302:304"/>
ſay at three or four Year old? <hi>Why, Couſin,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>do you think this Child could ſay all this to you of meer Prattle</hi> and <hi>from meer Nature? Do you think there's nothing elſe in it?</hi> What elſe can there be in it, <hi>ſays the Mother?</hi> What ſtrange thing would you make of it? <hi>INDEED CO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SIN, ſays ſhe,</hi> I ſhould think <hi>it was a Reproof ſent from Heaven to me.</hi> And certainly this little Creature could not ſay all this of it ſelf: <hi>ſays the Mother,</hi> I know <hi>Margy</hi> is always talking her litt'e idle Stories to the Child; but if I thought ſhe had the Impudence to teach him to talk thus to me, I'd take care to rid the Houſe of her. You miſtake me quite, <hi>replies her Couſin,</hi> I don't think 'tis from <hi>Margy, but from him that made</hi> Margy. And <hi>I'll tell you,</hi> Couſin, <hi>if you do not look upon it to be ſo too, I think you will be much in the Wrong.</hi> I don't trouble my Head about it, not I, ſays the Mother.</p>
               <p>While they were talking of this, in comes the Child's Father; and after asking his Wife how ſhe did, and ſpeaking to his Couſin a little, he ask'd, <hi>Where's my Boy?</hi> And this introduc'd a ſhort Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe among them all, about what had happen'd: <hi>Says his Wife,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Your Boy! <hi>Your Maſter you mean;</hi> he is but juſt gone.</p>

                  <p>What d'ye mean by <hi>my Maſter,</hi> ſays he, <hi>jeſting?</hi> I have no Maſter, as I know of, but my Wife.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mother.</speaker>
                  <p>Nay, if he ben't <hi>your Maſter,</hi> it ſeems he is to be <hi>mine.</hi> Truly, your Son has been Chatechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing me this Morning at a ſtrange Rate.</p>

               <p>All this while, tho the Father of the Child ſeem'd a little affected juſt at the Time, while any thing was freſh upon his Mind, yet the Mother <hi>ſaid true enough in that;</hi> he was one that <hi>confeſs'd all</hi> and <hi>reform'd none.</hi> He was always crying out upon himſelf, what a wicked Wretch he was, and how wicked a Family he had, and how all his Children were bred up for the Devil; and every now and then he would cry, <hi>The Lord have Mercy upon him,</hi> and <hi>GOD forgive him.</hi> But ſtill he continued a poor drunken, ſwearing Creature, that was never the better for all his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; and the Family went on juſt as they were before.</p>
               <p>The little Boy, choſen by Providence from the Bowels of ſuch a wicked Race, and ſingl'd out as a Mark of divine ſpecial free Love, went on <hi>as before,</hi> and grew in <hi>favour both with GOD and Man;</hi> Wonderful Marks of early Piety appear'd in him, as
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:1032900302:311"/>
ſoon as his Years would admit: The Father, tho' he had little or nothing in him of GOD, yet had been ſo well pleaſed with what he found the Maid had done for the Child, that he reſolv'd ſhe ſhould not be remov'd from him; and the Mother hating the Wench for her religious Care of the Child, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to turn her away. This Strife between the Father and Mother remov'd the Bleſſing of the Child from them both, for a Time; and that, which <hi>had GOD's Grace concur'd,</hi> would have been a Means to awaken and reſtore them all, was made a Bleſſing to another Family; for the Mother was ſo provok'd at the Reproof theſe Things had been to her, and that her Husband would not conſent to her putting away the Maid, that ſhe began to hate the Child as well as the Wench; and the Father perceiving it, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to ſend the Child, <hi>and the Maid with it,</hi> into the Country. The Mother, it ſeems, being glad to be rid of them both, was very willing they ſhould go; ſo they were ſent to a Brother of the Father's at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> where the poor Maid did not change at all for the Better as to Religion; for the Family was not one Jot more religious than the other, only, of the two, they were a little modeſter and better na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd People.</p>
               <p>The Boy growing a little bigger, now began to run about, and play with ſuch other Children as were ſuitable to him in Years; but was ſo nice in his Company, that if any of the Children he was with, uſed bad Words, he wou'd not keep them Company, nor play with them any more. There happen'd to come a Lady to viſit at the Houſe, who brought a little pretty Boy with her; and the two Children were playing together a while, when, on a ſuddain, the Child came away from the other, and would not play with him any longer, for any Perſwaſions they could uſe: The Lady wanted to know the Reaſon.
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:1032900302:312"/>
                  <hi>Says the Child,</hi> He is a wicked Boy, he ſays bad Words: The Lady wanted to know what Words they were the Child had ſpoken; the Boy would not anſwer; they preſs'd him earneſtly, but he would not ſpeak: After long perſwading, he told them, <hi>He was afraid to ſay the Words;</hi> nor could they make him ſay the Words over again; for he told them, <hi>he muſt never ſpeak thoſe Words, but when he ſaid his Prayers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Abundance of ſuch Inſtances he gave of his early Senſe of Religion, while he ſtay'd at this Place, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that he reform'd two Girls in the Family where he was, and their Example reform'd their Mother; but their Stories are too long for this Work, even the very little Boys, that play'd with him, were the better for him; and the Children would go Home again and tell their Parents what a little Boy they play'd with; that if any Boy uſed wicked Words, ſaid <hi>O LORD,</hi> or <hi>O GOD,</hi> or any naughty Word, he would beat them, and put them out of his Company. This brought the Childrens Mothers from all Parts of the Town to ſee this wonderful Child, and he became ſo well known round the Country, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny came from other Towns to ſee and talk with him, to ſatisfy their Curioſity: All this while the Maid continu'd to take a great deal of Care of him; ſhe taught him his Catechiſe diligently, and the firſt Principles of Religion; and the Miniſter took a deal of pleaſure in talking with him, and inſtructing him, in ſhort he was ſo inquiſitive in religious Matters, ſo ſerious and ſo agreeably improving, that any one that had a Senſe of Religion muſt needs be delighted with him. He began now to be a great Boy, and it was time for him to go to School; ſo, after about three Years tending him, honeſt <hi>Margy</hi> was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs'd, and the Boy was taken Home to his Father and Mother again.</p>

                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:1032900302:313"/>
By what has been ſaid, Notice may be taken how ſignally the Providence of GOD provided Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Opportunity for religious Knowledge in the Infancy of this Child; ſo that, tho it was brought forth in a Family where there was no Advantages of Education to be had, yet the Child gain'd a ſtock of Knowledge above his Years, which added to his ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Inclination, and ſteady Purſuit of early Piety, made him an extraordinary Child every way, and this is indeed the Reaſon of my telling this Part of the Child's Story, <hi>(viz.)</hi> To record the ſignal Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of that Providence, which, as in its original Decrees, it ſingles out Objects of Mercy from Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, where no Fear of GOD is; ſo it does not how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever illuminate the Minds of thoſe ſo ſingl'd out by meer Inſpiration and miraculous Revelation; but furniſhes the ordinary Means of Inſtruction, letting us know that Education and inſtructing of Children in the Knowledge of GOD, and the moſt early Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence of Religion, is not the Duty of Parents on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but is the ordinary Means which GOD has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the reaching the Hearts of thoſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who are ſingl'd out by him for his own Service. But to return to the Story:</p>
               <p>The Father of this Child having now gotten his Son home again, put him to School to learn Latin at a Grammar School in the Neighbourhood; and as he was acquainted much among Sea-faring Men, a Captain of a Ship, that came home from <hi>Berbadoes,</hi> brought him home a little Negro Boy about 14 Year old: The Boy, it ſeems, was born in that Iſland, and yet he ſpoke but imperfect <hi>Engliſh,</hi> however, as he was of a ſuitable Age for ſuch Work, he appointed him to wait upon his little Son.</p>
               <p>The Child, however acceptable abroad, as I have obſerv'd, yet was ſo far from winning upon his own Family, by his religious and ſober Carriage, that his
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:1032900302:314"/>
Mother had ſlighted him for ſome Years; and his Brothers and Siſters did the ſame by her Example; his Father only moſt affectionately lov'd him; and tho his Son's religious Life had no ſaving Influence upon him, at leaſt not for a great while, yet it had a great effect upon his Morals; for it abated in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the uſe of Swearing, and ill Words, meerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could not think of being reprov'd by his own Son; indeed it partly civilliz'd the whole Family, for he would never fail to reprove them all, and that very roughly too in his Way; only it had this Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in its Effect, that as his Brothers and Siſters ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him for it, ſo his Father lov'd him for it moſt paſſionately.</p>
               <p>The young Negro being now to be his Comrade; the firſt Day or two after he had him, <hi>truly he turn'd him away,</hi> and would have <hi>nothing to do with him:</hi> His Father coming to hear it; <hi>I warrant you,</hi> ſays his Father, this young black Rogue has had ſome ugly Words in his Mouth, either he has ſworn, or taken GOD's Name in vain, or ſome ſuch Thing, and if he has, <hi>Jack</hi> will ne'er endure him again; ſo he caus'd the Child to be ask'd, and he told his Father he had ſaid ſuch dreadful Words as he never heard in his Life; it ſeems he had uſed the common Phraſe of the Iſland where he was born, <hi>Dam him,</hi> or ſuch like: Upon this, the Father call'd the Boy to him, and told him how the Caſe was, that <hi>Toby (ſo the Negro was call'd)</hi> was not a Chriſtian, and did not <hi>know GOD,</hi> and therefore did not know it was a Sin; but that he ſhould be ſoundly whipp'd for it, and then he would do it no more.</p>
               <p>His Son ſeem'd very well ſatisfy'd with that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; but ſaid, <hi>No,</hi> if he did not know it was a Sin, he ſhould not be whipp'd for it the firſt Time; but that he ſhould be told then what GOD was, and that it was a Sin to uſe ſuch Words, and then if he
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:1032900302:315"/>
broke the Law that was ſet him, he made his Father promiſe him that he would have him be whipp'd foundly: Upon this, and his Father promiſing, he he took the Negro to him again.</p>
               <p>But to ſee how he uſed this Boy! how he examin'd him! inſtructed him! talk'd to him! could it be all ſet down, it would be very inſtructing; but it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible: however, one of their Diſcourſes being ſomething publick, may be uſeful for its particular variety.</p>

               <p>Every Diſcourſe between theſe two ended in ſuch Broils as theſe; he was always left touch'd with a Senſe of good Things, and Convictions of his own wicked Life; ſhe always was hard, inſolent in her Wickedneſs, and deſpiſing good Things to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that, as is ſaid, ſhe hated the poor honeſt Wench mortally, for inſtructing her Child; and cou'd not endure the Child it ſelf, becauſe of the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle innocent Reproofs he always gave her, and others about her; and now the Boy began to grow up, and be able to argue and talk of good Things, it ſet her perfectly raging againſt him.</p>
               <p>However, partly by the wonderful Effect of GOD's Grace in the Child, and partly by the horrid Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of his Wife, the Child's Father was brought to a full Stop in his courſe of Sin from this very Day; and firſt, being under ſtrong Convictions, on the looking ſeriouſly into himſelf, he effectually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd his Life, and from a common Swearer and Drunkard, became a grave, ſober, and perfectly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd Man, <hi>as to that Part I mean;</hi> he left off his Company entirely, and drank neither Wine or ſtrong

Drink, or at leaſt ſo little, as not to be in the leaſt danger of Intemperance; and to ſwearing, his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation was ſo ſerious, that not an ill Word was ever after heard to come out of his Mouth: On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, he was reſerv'd, ſerious, retir'd much alone, and grew a little melancholly; his Wife, after her uſual manner, banter'd it, and treated him with all poſſible Scorn and Contempt, eſpecially at firſt; ſhe told him it would ſoon be over with him, and the next Time ſuch a Captain came, it would be all at an end, <hi>naming a Gentleman who us'd to come to the Houſe, and who drank exceſſive hard.</hi> However, her Husband convinc'd her that ſhe was in the wrong; for that Gentleman came, and three or four more with him, and all hard Drinkers, like himſelf; and her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, who was oblig'd to be with them and entertain them, did ſo; he gave them what Wine they would have, made them a great Bowl of Punch, and they were merry after their own wont; but as to himſelf, he told them in ſo many Words, he had reſolv'd to leave off drinking, and he muſt be excus'd, he would not drink as he had done; ſo he ſat with them, drank now and then a Glaſs, but no Perſwaſion could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with him, tho they uſed both ſmooth Words, and rough Words with him, to drink as he us'd to do.</p>

               <p>The Husband had now brought his Reformation to a bleſſed and comfortable length; and as to the Gentlemen, which ſhe told him would be diſoblig'd, they uſed him very kindly: When they ſaw he was reſolute in it, they left off importuning him to drink; and knowing that he did it on Principles of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Reformation, they reſpected him openly, the more for it, and rather abated in drinking themſelves, by his Example, than prompted him to drink beyond what he was willing to take; ſo that he found his Work very eaſy, after he had once ſet reſolutely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it.</p>
               <p>But the Alteration of his Way of living had a little of the other Effect, which his Wife ſpoke of, upon him; for, <hi>firſt,</hi> he found a ſtrong Inclination in him to drink, and, <hi>as he call'd it,</hi> he had an irreſiſtible Guſt in his Appetite, preſſing him, like violent Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, to ſtrong Liquor of every kind; and this he had a great deal of Difficulty to ſtruggle with: It pleas'd GOD however, to fortify his Reſolution in this
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:1032900302:327"/>
Caſe, by an accidental Word from the Scriptures: He was very penſive and melancholly one Day, upon the violent Motion which he felt in his Stomach to drink; he felt his Appetite craving and eager, and his Stomach out of order: He had taken a Glaſs of Wine or two, and he found himſelf better after it; but for want of Quantity, the Deſire return'd as fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious as ever, and he was ſcarce able to reſiſt it: He conſider'd, if he comply'd again, he was undone, and ſhould return to all his former Exceſſes; and if he did not gratify his Stomach, he was intollerably ſick, and what to do, he knew not: In this Interval, his little Son came into the Room, being juſt come from School, and had a Book in his Hand; he calls to him, and asks him what Book he had in his Hand: His Son told him, <hi>It was the Bible:</hi> Come hither then, <hi>ſays he,</hi> and ſit down and read a Chapter to me. The Boy asks him where he ſhould read. Any where, <hi>ſays his Father,</hi> where GOD ſhall direct thee. The Boy ſits down, and providentially pitches upon the viiith Chapter of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and reads it to his Father; when he came to the 13th Verſe, his Father bad him read that Verſe again, which he did, <hi>If ye live after the Fleſh, ye ſhall die;</hi> but <hi>if ye, through the Spirit, do mortify the Deeds of the Body, ye ſhall live.</hi> He bid him ſtop there, and read no more; my Work is plain, <hi>ſays he,</hi> I muſt mortify theſe Deeds of the Body, if I expect to live.</p>
               <p>With theſe Reſolutions he gain'd ſome Ground of his Appetite; but it threw him into an aguiſh Indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and he grew much out of order; however, he reſolv'd upon this, that Life or Death was before him, and that not only Death in the ordinary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of that Word, but eternal Death, Soul, and Body; and he reſolv'd to keep his Ground, whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was the Conſequence; and to aſſiſt his Health, he remov'd into the Country.</p>

               <p>The Work of GOD upon the Heart of this poor Savage was ſtrong, and its Progreſſion wonderful; his Repentance appear'd to be founded in the Senſe
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:1032900302:335"/>
of GOD's Mercy, the beſt Motive to the beſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; and of all that he underſtood of GOD's Mercy, this affected him moſt, that he would hear and forgive ſuch a poor black wicked Creature, ſuch a deſpicable loſt Wretch as he. This brought Tears in his Eyes, melted his Heart; and tho he was as ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant as meer Nature can be ſuppos'd to be, yet his Conviction led him the right Way, to the right End of Convictions, <hi>(viz.)</hi> to Admiration and Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the Goodneſs of GOD, and then to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition and true Repentance for his Sin.</p>
               <p>But his poor pious Teacher was as full as his Heart could hold with it; he was affected to an extream not to be expreſs'd, but was at a ſad Loſs how to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect any farther: He wept and cry'd over poor <hi>Toby</hi> every Day; but he was too young; he did know what to ſay to him; and the poor Negro ask'd him a thouſand Queſtions every Day, that he knew not how to anſwer: GOD had been pleas'd to touch this poor Creature's Heart, and make him a ſincere Convert, and this poor Child was all the Inſtructor he had, and he could go but a little Way with him: They were always together, and <hi>Toby</hi> made the Child ſay his Prayers over to him, and teach him; and he learnt <hi>Toby</hi> the Lord's Prayer, and the two little Prayers which <hi>Margy</hi> taught him; and ſtill the black Boy, who was older than the other, was ſo inquiſitive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to good Things, that the white Boy could not fully anſwer him; for, poor Child, he had had no Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor himſelf, but the honeſt religious Maid, except the Miniſter at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> and he was not acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed long with him, ſo that he was at a great Loſs.</p>
               <p>But Providence, which never leaves ſuch Work as this unfiniſh'd, ſoon aſſiſted them both; for his Father not liking the Accommodations they had there, very well, took a new Lodging; and it happen'd that they found in the Houſe a Lodger, an antient good Lady, as
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:1032900302:336"/>
eminent for her great Knowledge in Religion, as her exact religious and holy Life and Converſation.</p>
               <p>It was impoſſible that ſuch a Boy as this could be long in the Houſe, and not be diſcover'd to this good Woman; ſhe obſerv'd very often that <hi>Toby</hi> and his little Maſter were with their Heads cloſe together, both of them looking over one and the ſame Book; ſo ſhe begins with him <hi>one Day</hi> thus:</p>

               <p>Note, <hi>At about four Years end, the Captain, mention'd before, return'd from a long tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Voyage in the</hi> Eaſt-Indies, <hi>and very rich; and the first Thing he did, he enquir'd out</hi> Margy, <hi>and examin'd her and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman the Couſin (ſpoken of above) about what ſhe had done with the Child, and how ſhe had diſcharg'd her ſelf of the Work he hired her for: And having a faithful Account of her extraordinary Conduct, and how ſhe had brought the Child up, he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd her,</hi> as he ſaid, <hi>that ſhe might bring up his own as well, for he had four ſmall Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, his Wife dying while he was Abroad; and</hi> Margy <hi>made as religious a Wife as ſhe had done a Servant, and liv'd like a Lady, as we ſhall hear by and by.</hi>

                  <p>It is true; 'tis a ſad Thing for Parents to lead their Children into Wickedneſs, at the very Time when they ſhould lay Foundations of Piety and Vertue in their Minds; but tho this is one of the great Things no doubt you now repent of, yet you may have the Comfort ſtill, to ſee the Grace of GOD recover them, and it is not too late for you to uſe ſome Means for their Reformation.</p>

                  <p>I am perſwaded you need not be afraid for him; GOD that ſingled him out in ſuch a Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from his Infancy, and that gave him a Spirit and Courage to withſtand, and reprove the Prophaneneſs even of his own Mother, will ſecure him from the power of any Temptation; he will be rather a means to do good to them, than they to do hurt to him.</p>

                  <speaker>Fa.</speaker>
                  <p>Alas! his Mother! ſhe is the worſt Enemy the Child can have; ſhe hates him already, for thoſe little Turns and Reproofs he has given her, which I told you of; and in ſhort, becauſe he will not be as wicked as the reſt of them.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady.</speaker>
                  <p>But GOD may turn her Heart; and then ſhe will hate her ſelf and love the Child; and ſtill ſhe is his Mother; I would leave him to her, and truſt his Soul in the Hands of GOD.</p>

                  <p>I ſhall have no Peace to do ſo, becauſe I know the Tenderneſs of the Child's Temper; they, like the Men of <hi>Sodom</hi> to <hi>Lot,</hi> will vex his righteous Soul from Day to Day; they will be an early Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction to him, if they are not a Temptation to him.</p>

way; leave, as I ſaid, what you will give him, out of their reach, that they may not wrong him; and empower ſome particular Friend to take Care of him ſo far, that if the Child is ill uſed and deſires to be remov'd, that Friend may take care of him; but let it be a religious conſcientious Perſon, or none at all.</p>

               </sp>
               <p>The Father liv'd not above half a Year after this; but made a very Chriſtian and religious End; being a moſt ſincerely humbled Penitent for his paſt Life; frequently bleſſing GOD for the firſt Alarms he received in his wicked Courſes, by the Reproof of that little Child. But neither his reformed Life, or his religious Death, had any immediate Influence upon his Wife, or any of the reſt of his Children; nay when his Will was open'd and read, ſhe was rather enraged than affected with a Clauſe in it, which took the diſpoſal of his youngeſt Son <hi>John</hi> out of her Hands, and left him to be diſpoſed by <hi>Margy —</hi> that was the Captain's Wife, formerly the Child's Maid, and by the Lady <hi>Barbara —,</hi> that was the Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, with whom he had the Diſcourſe above, about the diſpoſing of the Child: And it was thus expreſs'd in his Will, <hi>I do hereby empower them to enquire into the Treatment my ſaid Child meets with under his own Relations, and to remove him if he is willing to be removed, and that they ſee Cauſe; according to a written Paper of Directions, ſign'd and ſeal'd by my own Hand and Seal, declaring what ſhall be eſteem'd a ſufficient Cauſe for ſuch a removing my Child; which Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi>
                  <pb n="334" facs="tcp:1032900302:345"/>
                  <hi>I have left in the Hands of the ſaid Mrs.</hi> Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret — <hi>and the Lady</hi> Barbara —. The Mother was exceedingly uneaſy at this Clauſe about the Child; and it rather encreas'd than abated the Averſion ſhe had before conceiv'd to him: And this made her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the willinger to leave the Boy in the Country, where it ſeems his Father had got a School for him, and had left him and the black Boy a little before he dy'd, recommending him earneſtly to the pious La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, who was the Lodger in the Houſe, and who promiſed to take as much care of him as if he was her own.</p>
               <p>And indeed there was no need to recommend him to her; for the Child recommended himſelf to her, by the Sweetneſs of his Diſpoſition, the Sobriety of his Carriage, and his continual hanging about her to ask religious Queſtions, and talk of ſerious Things with her; which, as it was exceeding delightful to her, ſo it was all his Diverſion; for when other Boys were at Play, this was his Recreation, and he drunk in Knowledge like Water; for his Search after In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction was ſo earneſt, that nothing was loſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him.</p>
               <p>It pleaſed GOD ſo to order Things for the early furniſhing Inſtruction to this Child, that (1.) this Lady, who was a Perſon of very good Quality was without any Family but two Servants, and ſo was perfectly at Leiſure to give, as it were, her whole Time to the Advantage of his Education. (2.) That ſhe was a Lady of vaſt Knowledge and Capacity, join'd with admirable Experience, and a moſt excellent Chriſtian. And (3.) that ſhe took ſo much delight in the Child, and in his Inſtruction, that it was an unſpeakable Affliction to her, when he was taken away from the School by his Mother; which was not, however, till ſomewhat more than two Years.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="335" facs="tcp:1032900302:346"/>
In this Time he had acquir'd a Knowledge, and Experience in religious Matters above his Years; and as he received Inſtruction himſelf from this pious Lady, ſo he brought up under him his Negro Boy, in the Knowledge of Religion, and the Practice of it too. Nor did the good Lady ſpare any Pains, or think it below her to inſtruct the poor Negro; and her favourite Boy would often deſire her to do it, when any thing the Negro ask'd was too hard for him; by which ſhe was a Means at leaſt, to make the poor Savage Creature an Example of GOD's wonderful Grace, in revealing himſelf to his Soul, and bringing him from Darkneſs to Light. Among the many Diſcourſes which happen'd between her and the Child, I think one more than ordinarily worth recording, which happen'd ſoon after the Child was come back from the Burial of his Father.</p>
               <p>She had been up in her Chamber ſomething longer than her uſual Time; and as ſhe came down Stairs, ſhe ſaw her little Scholar ſitting alone in one of the Parlours, looking very Melancholy; and as ſhe thought, he either was, or had been crying; ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently imagin'd, as was moſt natural to his Caſe, that the Child was thinking of his Father, and perhaps caſt down to be left alone among Strangers, and no Father to have recourſe to as uſual; ſo ſhe thought ſhe would ſpeak chearfully to him. <hi>My Jacky,</hi> ſays ſhe (ſo ſhe had call'd him for ſome time) what's the Matter my Dear? Come, you muſt not be caſt down Child, what have you been crying for?</p>
               <p>The Boy made her no Anſwer, but cry'd again; for he was not crying when ſhe call'd to him, tho he had been crying ſome time before.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady.</speaker>
                  <p>Come, my Dear; you muſt not grieve your ſelf, you will make your ſelf Sick: Did not you and I talk the other Day before your Father dy'd, of the great Duty of Reſignation to the Will of GOD; do you remember it?</p>

                  <p>Well, my Dear, then practiſe it now. You muſt not only reſign your Father, but your ſelf; for you know, my Dear, you muſt die too, as well as your Father.</p>

                  <speaker>Lady.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, and how do you think any one can die with Comfort? There is no Temper in the World fit to die in, or that we can die comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in, but that of Reſignation and Adherence; and they are in one reſpect both the ſame.</p>

                  <speaker>Boy.</speaker>
                  <p>I don't cry for my Father, I believe he is gone to Heaven; he told me he ſhould go to Heaven, and bid me not cry for him.</p>

                  <p>I cry for my Mother.</p>

                  <speaker>Lady.</speaker>
                  <p>Why doeſt cry for thy Mother, my Dear?</p>

                  <p>Do Folks go to Heaven, that do as my dear Mother does?</p>

                  <speaker>Lady.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, my Dear, what does ſhe do?</p>

                  <p>O! ſhe ſays ſuch Words, it frights me.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady.</speaker>
                  <p>My Dear, if your Mother ſays bad Words, you muſt not learn them, or think they are not bad Words becauſe it is your Mother.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Boy.</speaker>
                  <p>But ſure if it was ſo wicked a Thing to ſay ſuch Words, my Mother would not do it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady.</speaker>
                  <p>It may be ſhe might, my Dear, in a Paſſion.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Boy.</speaker>
                  <p>What, my Dear Mother!</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady.</speaker>
                  <p>It may be ſhe was in a Paſſion Child, when ſhe did ſo; Folks ſay Words ſometimes when they are provok'd, which they would not ſay at another time.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Boy.</speaker>
                  <p>O then, it is not a wicked thing to ſay bad Words, if they are in a Paſſion, is it?</p>
               </sp>
               <stage>The Boy look'd a little chearful at that, as if he had gotten an Excuſe for his Mother.</stage>

<pb n="337" facs="tcp:1032900302:348"/>
ſo neither; Paſſion may be the Cauſe, but it is far from being an Excuſe; 'tis rather making two Sins of one.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Boy.</speaker>
                  <p>You ſaid, it may be ſhe might be in a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>

                  <speaker>Lady.</speaker>
                  <p>I ſaid ſo Child, becauſe many People in a Paſſion, or when they are provoked, will ſay Words, and do Things which they do not approve, and are ſorry for after.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Boy.</speaker>
                  <p>But why do they do ſo, if it be not that it is leſs a Sin than at another Time?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady.</speaker>
                  <p>Child, they do it becauſe Paſſion tranſports them to do they know not what.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Boy.</speaker>
                  <p>Why then the Paſſion makes it a greater Sin, not a leſs, don't it?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes it does ſo: But what doeſt thou cry for again, was thy Mother in a Paſſion?</p>

               <stage>The Boy cries again.</stage>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Boy.</speaker>
                  <p>My Mother is always in a Paſſion then, for ſhe always uſes thoſe ſad words.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, but may be ſhe is ſorry for it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, my Dear, and repents.</p>

                  <p>No, no, my Mother does not repent.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Boy.</speaker>
                  <p>Becauſe ſhe does it again every Day; and I remember <hi>Margy</hi> told me a great while ago, that to repent of my Sins, was to be ſorry for them, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake them; and that if I did not forſake them, I might be ſure I had not repented.</p>

                  <speaker>Lady.</speaker>

                  <speaker>Boy.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, and I ſhall never forget it as long as I live; for I have always Sins to repent of; and they always put me in mind of poor <hi>Margy?</hi>

                  <p>Poor <hi>Margy</hi> was a good Maid to thee, ſhe was better to thee than ten Mothers; don't you love her for it?</p>

                  <speaker>Lady.</speaker>
                  <p>You muſt pray for your Mother, my Dear, that GOD would touch her Heart.</p>

                  <p>So I do every Day, but I did more than that.</p>

                  <speaker>Boy.</speaker>
                  <p>I told my Mother that it was not good to uſe ſuch Words; and that I was afraid GOD would be angry with her for it.</p>

                  <p>I cry'd; and ſaid, what I ſhould not have ſaid, becauſe ſhe was my Mother, for I know I ſhould Honour my Mother; I told her, I had heard my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſay, that ſhe would make GOD angry with her, and all of us for her ſake; for ſhe broke GOD's Commands her ſelf, and taught us all to do ſo too.</p>

And the next Day, the Maid ask'd me what I had done to my Mother? <hi>Why,</hi> ſays I, <hi>what have I done to her?</hi> Nay, I don't know, <hi>ſaid the Maid,</hi> but you anger'd her ſo, ſhe has been crying and ſighing all Night al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, and will let no Body ſpeak to her; and I can aſſure you, that you will be ſent away to School for it to morrow; for <hi>your Siſter</hi> Judith <hi>ſays,</hi> you are not fit to be ſuffer'd in the Houſe.

I would repent now, but 'tis too late, and then ſhe dy'd.</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>Yes, I had been crying about her, but not for the Dream, for I ſaw it was but a Dream; but the Thoughts that my dear Mother ſhould not go to Heaven, has almoſt broke my Heart before that Dream, and I cry'd about that a great while, and it makes my Heart tremble every Time I think of it.</p>

on her Death-bed indeed, and very near her End; but ſuch a Penitent as the like had not been known by any that converſt with her; and upon enquiry, it appear'd that ſhe had been ſtruck with a Senſe of her Condition for ſome Time before ſhe was taken ſick, and that it began immediately upon that affectionate Diſcourſe the Child had with her, mention'd before, when he went to kiſs her, and ſaid, <hi>Dear Mother, don't break GOD's Commands,</hi> and particularly when he told her, <hi>that he was ſure no Body could go to Heaven that did ſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She had lain ſome Time under the Horror of her firſt Convictions, and in a ſad deſpairing Condition, which began the ſame Evening the Boy had ſpoke to her; and this it ſeems was the Reaſon of the Boy's being ſent away, which was not done by his Mother's Order, but by his eldeſt Siſter, who was no more ſenſible of the Nature of the Thing, than one given over, and therefore hated the Child for having griev'd and vex'd his Mother with his impertinent and ſaucy Diſcourſe, <hi>as ſhe call'd it,</hi> and therefore took upon her to ſend the Child away, which her Mother was very much diſpleas'd at when ſhe knew it.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The Child was ſo full of the Affliction of ſeeing his Mother ſo ill, that he could ſcarce ſpeak; but when he heard her ſpeak of her Repentance, he pull'd out his little Bible: Come, my Dear, <hi>ſays his Mother,</hi> what has GOD directed thee to look for there, I ſhall take every Thing that comes from thee to be by the ſpecial Inſtance of the Divine Spirit.

               <p>A few Days after this Diſcourſe the Mother dy'd, and made a very happy and comfortable End; and the poor Child was left in an unhappy ill-guided Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, where he was capable of doing no Good, or of receiving any. After ſome Time the Family ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, and this Child with one of his Siſters were, at their own Requeſt, ſent down to the Houſe where he was before, and where he had ſo happily fallen into the Hands of that good Lady, who acted the Part of a Mother, and indeed more than a Mother with him before.</p>
               <p>Here he was a Means of not only reforming, but effectually turning his Siſter to be the moſt ſerious and religious young Woman imaginable; and this he did by a continual following her with Reproofs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Diſcourſes, and conſtant Perſuaſions to pray to GOD, and to read the Scripture, and to leave off all looſe Words, as ſcandalous and unbecoming. And here he, with the Aſſiſtance of the Teachings and Inſtructions of the good Lady, brought the poor Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro Boy <hi>Toby,</hi> who it ſeems his Father had given to
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:1032900302:363"/>
him to be his own, to be an extraordinary Chriſtian; and ſo knowing in religious Principles, Doctrines, and Rules of Practice, that he was the Wonder of all that convers'd with him; all which he conſtantly acknowledged to be owing, under GOD, to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and affectionate Care of his <hi>little Governour,</hi> for <hi>ſo he always call'd him;</hi> I mean, the Child that was then become his Maſter.</p>
               <p>It was farther obſervable of this Negro Boy, that after he had been by the Exhortations and unwearied Pains of that good Lady, fully inſtructed in the Knowledge of Religion, ſhe cauſed him at his own Deſire, and with the Conſent of his little Governour, to be ſolemnly baptiz'd: Upon which Occaſion, he made ſuch a Confeſſion of his Faith in Chriſt, and of the Reaſons why he deſir'd to be baptiz'd, as gave great Satisfaction to the Miniſter who baptized him, and to all that heard it. But altho his being baptiz'd and becoming a real Chriſtian, gave him a Title to his Liberty, ſo as that he was no more a Slave to ſerve without Wages; yet he would never accept of that Advantage, nor by any Means leave his Maſter, or become a Servant for Wages, till his Maſter was grown up and voluntarily gave him his Diſmiſs.</p>
               <p>After the Child had been ſome Time longer in this Place, the Captain, of whom mention was made in the beginning of this Story, and who had marry'd his Maid <hi>Margy,</hi> having Notice of the Death of his Mother, come to ſee him. It ſeems the good Lady who had taken ſo much the voluntary Charge of him, <hi>for it was no otherwiſe,</hi> had found Means to let the Captain know how his Father had, at his Death, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended his Son to his Care, together with his Wife; and it ſeems the Lady being now to remove, and the Child growing to be pretty big, ſhe thought the guiding of him a little beyond her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement, at leaſt ſingly, and ſo ſhe deſir'd the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

to come and conſult about his farther Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <head>The Fifth DIALOGUE.</head>
               <p>BEfore I come to ſpeak of the Meaſures taken by the Captain, which will finiſh the Story of the Boy, and does not go much farther, it will be very entertaining to go back a little to the Story of his Maid <hi>Margy,</hi> who it pleaſed GOD to make the firſt Inſtructor of this Child, as has been obſerv'd already: How the Captain, after his rough manner, beſpoke her conſtant Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the teaching and inſtructing this Child, and gave her Money to encourage her; which he call'd <hi>Hiring her for GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The honeſt Wench needed none of thoſe warm Engagements, her Affection to the Child was ſuch as led her many times to ſhed Tears over him, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the ſad Condition ſhe ſaw him expoſed to, and how miſerable an Education he was like to have; and as ſhe told the Captain when he gave her that Money, ſhe thought it would break her Heart to think what Example, what guiding, and what dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Temptations the poor Child would be expoſed to as it grew up, ſo ſhe was the moſt anxious Creature in the World, when ſhe had the Teaching of him, leſt ſhe ſhould not be able to prevent the evil Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions ſuch Things might make upon him, after ſhe ſhould be oblig'd to leave him.</p>

                  <pb n="354" facs="tcp:1032900302:365"/>
But as he grew up he deliver'd her from thoſe Fears, and ſhe had the Satisfaction to have a faithful Account from the Child's Father <hi>while he lived,</hi> not only that he had been preſerv'd himſelf, but how he had been a Means to do Good to others; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, how he had a great Hand in the convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing him <hi>(the Father)</hi> of the deſperate Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Life, and of bringing him to a ſerious and ſincere Repentance.</p>
               <p>Providence ſome time after this, carry'd this Maid into the Country, by the Accident of a Family ſhe ſerv'd in for ſome Years; ſo that ſhe was not at that Time acquainted with what occur'd in this Family; and particularly, did not hear of the Enquiry made after her on the following Occaſion.</p>
               <p>The Captain had been at Sea, as was ſaid, and going a trading Voyage to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> had been kept out no leſs than four Years; but to make amends for the Length of Time he was out, he came home exceeding rich; he was ſo far from being unmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of the little Boy, who he had in ſo affectionate a manner recommended to this Maid <hi>Margy,</hi> that during his being abroad, he wrote twice to his Wife to enquire after the Child, and to know in particular, if <hi>Margy</hi> did her Duty to him; and if ſhe did, to give her a Sum of Money which he order'd for that purpoſe. The firſt time the Captain's Wife found <hi>Margy</hi> with the Child in her Care, and gave her the Money; but the ſecond time <hi>Margy</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd from the Child, and gone as I have ſaid, into the Country to another Service, the Captain's Wife could not find her, which very much troubl'd her; for hearing ſhe was gone from the Child, ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to hire her into her own Houſe, to look after her own Children.</p>
               <p>This was <hi>Margy</hi>'s Loſs and the Captain's Wife's alſo. At firſt it was <hi>Margy</hi>'s Loſs, becauſe ſhe had
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:1032900302:366"/>
not the Money which was intended for her, and it was the Family's Loſs becauſe they miſs'd of ſo good and ſo faithful a Servant in the Houſe among the Children, which were then very young; but the Loſs was fully repair'd at laſt.</p>
               <p>After ſome time the Captain came Home, and brought a vaſt Wealth with him, God had been pleas'd to give him great Succeſs abroad, and he came home reſolv'd to go no more to Sea. But he had, with all his Succeſs, the bad News to receive at his coming Home, that his Wife was dead; which was a great Affliction to him, ſhe being both a very good Wife to him, and a very tender, careful, conſcientious Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to his Children.</p>
               <p>He had not long conſider'd the Circumſtances of his Family and Children, and the Want they ſtood in of a careful, faithful Hand to guide and bring them up, but he bethought himſelf of honeſt <hi>Margy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He enquir'd, and ſoon found ſhe was gone ſome time from the Child ſhe had the Charge of, and this made him deſirous to find her out; but he could by no means hear whither ſhe was gone. However, that he might have ſome account of her Conduct, and how ſhe had diſcharg'd her ſelf of the Truſt he committed to her, he apply'd himſelf to the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman who was preſent when he engag'd her, and gave her the Money to take Charge of the Child; whom in the former Dialogue we call'd the <hi>Couſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He had from her the whole Hiſtory of the Family, and particularly, of <hi>Margy</hi>'s Behaviour, and how careful ſhe had been of the Child, and with what good Succeſs her Care had been bleſs'd, <hi>as has been ſaid.</hi> He alſo learn'd from her, that the ſecond Sum of Money which he had ſent her, had not been paid her, becauſe neither his Wife nor ſhe her ſelf, could by any Means hear whither the Maid was gone.</p>
               <p>It troubled the Captain exceedingly that he could
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:1032900302:367"/>
not hear of her, becauſe upon the Loſs of his Wife, he had alter'd his Reſolution of not going to Sea any more; but was greatly concern'd who to leave the Government of his Children to in his Abſence; and being not only a tender Father, as to their being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for, but a moſt religious Father, as to their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well inſtructed, he would have given any thing in the World to have left his Children in the Conduct of ſuch a Servant as <hi>Margy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It happen'd in this Juncture, that the Captain go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Water in a Wherry from his Ship, which lay about <hi>Deptford;</hi> the Boat accidentally run foul of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Boat, in which there was a Maid and a Child. The Maid appear'd very much frighted at the Boat's falling foul of another; and the Captain ſaid to her, Sweet-heart do not be afraid, there is no Danger. She made no Anſwer, being ſtill in ſome Diſorder, and particularly afraid for the Child that was with her; yet he obſerv'd afterwards that ſhe bow'd two or three times to him very reſpectfully.</p>
               <p>The Boats being clear, the Captain's Boat, which was Oars, and conſequently had two Watermen, went before the Maid's Boat, which was but a Scul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler; and as he paſſed by, looking at the Wench, he thought he knew her Face, but did not call to mind who ſhe was; however, he had not gone far, but he recollected his Memory, and it came into his thoughts that it was <hi>Margy:</hi> Upon which he ſtop'd the Boat, and ſpoke to her, and ſoon found that it was <hi>Margy</hi> indeed.</p>
               <p>He ask'd her where ſhe liv'd; and ſhe told him in the Country, not far from <hi>Warwick.</hi> He ask'd her, if ſhe had that Child in keeping? ſhe ſaid, Yes, and two more: That her Maſter, who was a Baronet, and his Lady, were both at <hi>Greenwich;</hi> and ſhe was ſent up to their Lodging in <hi>London</hi> with that Child, becauſe it was not well. He enquir'd where her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:1032900302:368"/>
Lodging was; and told her, he muſt needs ſpeak with her; and that if ſhe could be ſpar'd to come to his Houſe the next Day, he deſir'd ſhe would, and bring the Gentlewoman with her laſt ſpoken of, who was with her when he firſt ſpoke to her. She told him, ſhe believ'd ſhe could not be ſpar'd ſo ſoon; but that the firſt Day ſhe could get any Time ſhe would wait on him. And as he was going away ſhe told him, ſhe humbly thank'd him for his having been ſo mindful of her, as to ſend her a Sum of Money, which ſhe was in no Means able to deſerve. He told her, part of his Buſineſs was to enquire what ſhe had done to deſerve it; and that tho he did not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion but ſhe had done her Part, yet he wanted the Satisfaction of knowing what Succeſs ſhe had: Then he ask'd her, how much ſhe had receiv'd; ſhe told him, five Guineas. Well <hi>Margy,</hi> ſaid he, but you were to blame not to leave word whither you were gone; for I ſent you Ten more, but my Wife could by no Means find you out; however, ſays he, it ſhall not be your Loſs.</p>
               <p>He row'd away again, but could not be ſatisfy'd to leave her till he had talk'd with her effectually; ſo he row'd back a ſecond time, and ask'd her, if ſhe could not as well be ſpar'd now as at another time for half an Hour's Diſcourſe, or thereabouts; and that being near the Place where the Gentlewoman liv'd, if ſhe would land and go thither, he would come to her to the Houſe; ſhe readily agreed to it, and he came accordingly: Where the following Dialogue may give ſome Account of their Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>Well <hi>Margy, ſays the Captain,</hi> you know who I hir'd you for; what Account can you give of your Service?</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Marg.</speaker>

                  <p>No indeed, Sir, on the contrary, he ſoon learn'd more than I was able to teach him.</p>

                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>

                  <p>Sir, he has taught Religion and good Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to old and young; he has reform'd I know not how many Children that have been only his Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates; he has inſtructed old and young; People have come far and near to enquire about him: and he has converted his Father, confounded his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and much reform'd two of his Siſters; and yet he is not now 12 Year old: And they are not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out good Reaſon to believe that his Mother, who is ſurely one of the moſt harden'd and obſtinate Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures under the Sun, is at a little ſtand, and check'd in her uſual Courſe of Profaneneſs by him.</p>

                  <p>Alas Sir! what is all this to my part? I have no Pretence to any Share in it; he is taught from Heaven, and would have been all that he is now, if he had never ſeen my Face.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, if I ſhould, I think ſhe deſerves the Reſpect and Affection of any thing that loves and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:1032900302:373"/>
a Principle not to be imitated in the World.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Couſ.</speaker>
                  <p>Nay, Sir, if you will do ſo, I doubt not but her Lady will conſent to diſmiſs her; and, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, I have been afraid you have that in your Thoughts.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>I do not ſay I have it in my Thoughts; but if I ſhould, I ſhould do it purely for my Children: She that has been ſuch a voluntary Mother to that Child, from a meer Principle of Conſcience, cannot fail to be a Mother to my Children, if I ſhould add ſuch an Obligation as that of making her my Wife; beſides, ſhe is to be valu'd for her exact Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Couſ.</speaker>
                  <p>Nay, Captain, ſhe wants nothing to make her a compleat Wife, but Money; for, I aſſure you, ſhe came of a very good Family, and has been very well bred, tho her Parents are low; and yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not adviſe to it, for many Reaſons.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>I know not what your Reaſons are; you ſay ſhe wants nothing but Money, and I want every thing but Money; and ſhe is then the beſt Wife for me, and I am the beſt Husband for her; but theſe Things are remote, and may never happen; in the mean Time, I am ſure my Children want ſuch a Mother, tho I do not want ſuch a Wife.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Couſ.</speaker>
                  <p>There are abundance of Changes and Unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes always attend ſuch unequal Marriages; I would never adviſe any good Man to expoſe himſelf to the hazard of the Change of his Opinion.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>You bring me involuntarily into ſuch a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; I tell you plainly I have no ſuch View.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Couſ.</speaker>
                  <p>But I am afraid for you, and was from the Beginning, and that made me mention it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>If ever I ſhould think of ſuch a Thing, I ſhall do it from a Principle that is not apt to change; I can have Wives enough with good Fortunes, my own Circumſtances make it rational to expect I
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:1032900302:374"/>
could; but then I ruſh like a Horſe into the Battle, and venture upon I know not what; I know <hi>Margy</hi> has a Principle of Virtue and of Religion, and is Miſtreſs of the beſt Family-Conduct that ever I met with, and this is what I want in a Wife more than Money.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Couſ.</speaker>
                  <p>But why may not a Woman be found as well qualify'd with a Fortune as without; I cannot ſee the Reaſon of that.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>That's true, it is poſſible; but where is the Perſon, and how great is the Hazard? Here I know, is the Woman that is ſo qualify'd; and if ſhe be not rich, if I can make her rich, is it not the ſame thing?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Couſ.</speaker>
                  <p>You lay a great Streſs upon the Wife's Part, as if your whole Happineſs depended upon her.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>Indeed I think it does ſo, but eſpecially mine, who have four Children to be taken care of Soul and Body; if I have a Wife that neglects my Children, I am undone, I ſhall abhor the Sight of her.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Couſ.</speaker>
                  <p>Nay, I confeſs <hi>Margy</hi> ſeems to be qualify'd for that Work; ſhe will love your Children, I dare ſay.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>I know this of <hi>Margy,</hi> that if ſhe ſhould not take care of them from a Principle of Affection, ſhe will from a Principle of Conſcience; I do not expect ſhe ſhould have the Affection of a Mother, but I dare ſay ſhe will do the Duty of a Mother.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Couſ.</speaker>
                  <p>GOD forbid I ſhould injure <hi>Margy</hi> ſo much as to go about to leſſen your Value for her, either as a Wife, or as a Servant; I verily think ſhe will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve as well as any One in her Circumſtances: But I am for your own Sake, and your Family's Sake, moving you againſt ſuch a kind of Marriage in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as unequal and apt to be unhappy.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, Madam, that is not my preſent Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; my Deſire at preſent is to get her to take the

Charge of my Family upon her, while I am abroad; and I beg two Things of you.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Couſ.</speaker>
                  <p>Any thing, Sir, but to make a Propoſal of Marriage for you.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>I don't offer it now, nor do I think of it, if ſhe will but come and take Care of my Children; I am a going abroad.</p>

                  <p>I ſee plainly you will have her afterward, and of the two, you had better take her before; for a Widower marrying his own Maid, is not a Thing the cleareſt from Reflection of any in the World.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>I had reſolv'd ſo indeed, while my Wife was alive; but I have loſt the Delight of my Eyes, and ſince that I have chang'd my Mind, and reſolve to go to the <hi>Indies</hi> again, and this makes me ſo willing to have this Maid to manage my Children.</p>

                  <p>I aſſure you there is not; I do not purpoſe ſo much as to mention it to her.</p>

                  <p>I deſire you would talk to <hi>Margy</hi> again, and get her if you can; and if ſhe will not come without it, go to her Lady, and ſee if you can obtain her Conſent to it; perhaps when ſhe knows the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, ſhe will part with her.</p>

                  <p>I won't ſay one Word of the reſt.</p>

The Gentlewoman accordingly went the next Morning to <hi>Margy,</hi> where her Lady being not come up from <hi>Greenwich,</hi> ſhe had full Leiſure to diſcourſe with her, and between them began the following Dialogue.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Couſ.</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Margy,</hi> I fancy you wonder a little what has brought me to ſee you this Morning.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Marg.</speaker>
                  <p>So I do Madam, I hope you have no bad News; pray is my old little Governour well? have you heard from him?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Couſ.</speaker>
                  <p>No, <hi>Margy,</hi> I have no bad News; I have not heard lately; I believe he is well, he is in the Country; but I came to talk with you about Yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day's Buſineſs, and your refuſing to ſerve Capt. —; you know <hi>Margy</hi> he has been very civil to you, without the leaſt Obligation, and if I am not miſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, he made you a very fine Compliment Yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, upon the old Account of your Service to my little Couſin, your Governour, as you call him.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Marg.</speaker>
                  <p>Indeed, Madam, that is very true; he gave me a Sum I was aſham'd to receive, and what to do I know not; I would as willingly come into his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, as into any Family I know in the World, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I know he is a very religious good Man, and has four poor Motherleſs Children, prettily brought up hitherto; for his Wife was an extraordinary Mother, and the Children are quite out of all Management now, and may be ruin'd: But what can I do, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, to come away from my Lady without any juſt Cauſe, and a Lady that not only uſes me well, but depends upon me for the Managing her Family, and eſpecially of her Children? I think 'tis the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Part a Servant can do.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Couſ.</speaker>
                  <p>I do not know what to ſay to that, <hi>Margy;</hi> but it muſt be done if it be poſſible; the Captain has ſo much Dependance upon it, that he will never think his Children taken due Care of, unleſs they are
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:1032900302:377"/>
in your Hands: I believe you may have any Wages you will ask of him; nay, I have Power to offer you, that whatever Wages you have here, he will double it, therefore do not be in a ſtrait about it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Marg.</speaker>
                  <p>If I was free, Madam, I ſhould be in no ſtrait; for I ſhould undertake it as ſoon as you had ſpoken of it; and as I am not free, Madam, I am in no ſtrait neither, for I cannot do it with a ſafe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and no Body ſhould be in a ſtrait to refuſe every thing on that Account.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Couſ.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, but <hi>Margy,</hi> what if I ſhould get your Lady's Conſent?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Marg.</speaker>
                  <p>That's quite another Caſe, Madam; if my Lady is willing, I ought in juſtice to ſerve the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's Family before any other; for I have many Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations on me which you know of, both from him and his Wife too, when ſhe was living.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Couſ.</speaker>
                  <p>Well <hi>Margy,</hi> I know you have; but the Captain does not inſiſt upon that, you know he gave you that Money on another Account; he gave it firſt to engage you to do your Part conſcienciouſly with my little Kinſman, and after, as a Reward for your faithful diſcharge of your Duty; I wiſh all faithful Servants had the like Encouragement.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Marg.</speaker>
                  <p>I did nothing but what was my Duty, and what that dear little Creature would have forc'd any one almoſt to do.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Couſ.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, it is an Encouragement however to all Servants to be honeſt and careful, and to diſcharge their Duty well; you ſee GOD will find Ways to have them rewarded even in this World, and if they who are concern'd will not do it, Strangers ſhall; the Captain had no more Concern in that Child, or in that Family, than you had, before you were their Servant, only did it in a Principle of generous Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the Soul of the poor Child, who he ſaw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon'd by its own Parents.</p>

                  <speaker>Marg.</speaker>
                  <p>I know it, Madam, it was all Charity in him; but I look farther, I think it was all from a higher Hand, both to the Child and to me: I am perſwaded that Child has been the peculiar Care of Heaven from its Infancy; and as to me, I bleſs GOD I ever had the Charge of him; not that I have done the Child ſo much good as another might have done it; but I am ſure the Child has been a Means to do me a great deal of good, it had ſomething of the higheſt Principles of Chriſtianity in it from the very Cradle.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Couſ.</speaker>
                  <p>Now <hi>Margy,</hi> it is from the ſame Principle of Chriſtian Affection to the Soul of his own Children, beſides his fatherly Concern for them, that the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain deſires you to come and take Care of them; their Mother is gone, and he talks of going to Sea again, tho if his Wife had liv'd, he did not intend it; and he cannot go away with any Peace, if his Children are not left in ſome Hand that he can be eaſy with.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Marg.</speaker>
                  <p>It is a great Charge, Madam, for me to take upon me; if there was but one, I could do it pretty well, and ſhould do my Endeavour; but four Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and all of them ſmall Ones, is a Burthen too heavy for me.</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>He will let you have what Help you can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, <hi>Margy;</hi> you ſhall have no leſs than two Servants under you; he only wants you to have the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Marg.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, Madam, I can ſay no more than this, if my Lady, that I am now with, diſmiſſes me, I ſhall be willing to do what I can.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>The Couſin was faithful to her Word, and took not the leaſt Notice of her Diſcourſe with the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; neither would ſhe ſay any more to her at that Time, reſolving to talk with her Miſtreſs, and knowing where the Lady was at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> ſhe immediately takes Boat and goes down to her, and tells her the

whole Story of <hi>Margy</hi> and the Captain, as it related to the Child ſhe had tended before, and the Captain's Deſire now to have her for the Conduct of his own Children; and, Madam, <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> I come from the Captain to beg your Ladyſhip's Conſent to part with her.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady.</speaker>
                  <p>Indeed, Madam, you come of the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome Meſſage in the World; the Captain is in the right to deſire her, and ſignifies to me that he is <hi>a true Father</hi> to his Children; but I ſhould be <hi>as ill a Mother</hi> to mine if I ſhould part with her, for ſure there never was ſuch a Servant in any One's Houſe, and therefore, Madam, if you have any Senſe of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, do not attempt to rob me of a Servant that I take to be as <hi>Jacob</hi> was to the Houſe of <hi>Laban, (viz.)</hi> a Bleſſing to my Family.</p>

                  <speaker>Lady.</speaker>
                  <p>Nay, Madam, I hope you will not tamper with her, to entice her away.</p>

                  <p>One of her Rules is, that when a Maid-Servant takes upon her to tend little Children, it is her Duty to inſtruct and teach them, as well as tend and wait upon them. I wiſh all Maid-Servants ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the ſame Method.</p>

                  <p>On the contrary, they teach Children little ſimple Songs, bad Words, ill Habits and Cuſtoms; but this Wench is ſuch a conſcientious Creature, ſhe makes Children Chriſtians even before they know what a Chriſtian is; ſhe teaches them the Fear and Knowledge of GOD, even before ſhe is able to make them read.</p>

I'll tell you a ſhort Story of her.</p>
                  <p>I made the Child lie with me one Night, <hi>Margy</hi> being away, and I put her to Bed my ſelf, not caring to truſt any other Servant; when I had almoſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs'd her, ſhe pull'd me, and pull'd me two or three Times, and I could not imagine what the Child meant: At laſt ſhe look'd up in my Face very ſteadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but ſaid nothing; and ſtill I did not underſtand the Child. When ſhe could find no way to make me know what ſhe meant without ſpeaking, ſhe ſays two or three times over, <hi>Down Mamma, down Mamma: Down My Dear, ſaid I,</hi> what muſt I ſit down for? She pulls me again; <hi>Down Mamma,</hi> ſays ſhe: ſo I ſat down upon a little Stool; <hi>No, down here Mamma,</hi> ſays the Child, looking on one ſide of the Stool. So ſtupid a Fool was I all this while that I could not yet imagine what the Child meant! So it ſaid again, <hi>Down here Mamma,</hi> and points to the Floor; not dreaming yet what ſhe meant, I laugh'd at her; <hi>What, muſt I ſit upon the Floor?</hi> ye ſimple little Rogue you, <hi>ſaid I;</hi> no, no, I'll ſit here. With that the Child looking mighty grave, and a little tending to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards crying, ſays to me, <hi>Down ſo Mamma,</hi> and claps down upon its Knees. This a little ſtartled me: O <hi>my Dear,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>I did not underſtand thee: Come then, kneel down and ſay your Prayers.</hi> It would not do yet, this was not what the Child meant. <hi>No Mamma,</hi> ſays the Child, <hi>you kneel down, ſay Prayers.</hi>

At laſt I ſaid, why? <hi>my Dear,</hi> why muſt I ſay Prayers? <hi>Becauſe</hi> Margy <hi>is gone Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> ſays the Child. Why, my Dear, ſays I, does <hi>Margy</hi> kneel down ſo always and ſay Prayers when you go to Bed? <hi>Yes Mamma,</hi> ſays the Child, <hi>and me too.</hi> I ſaid nothing awhile; for indeed my Heart was full: But after a little more ſtop, ſays the Child, Mamma, <hi>May we go to Bed without ſay Prayers?</hi> No, no, my Dear, ſays I; tho GOD knows, my Heart reproaches me, that I had done it many a Time. The Child continu'd to teize me again; <hi>Do then Mamma,</hi> ſays ſhe, and pulls me by the Apron. Then Tears burſt out of my Eyes in ſpight of my Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and I took the poor little Creature in my Arms, and kneel'd down with it, and pray'd to GOD to bleſs it as well as I could; for I was hardly able to ſpeak a Word.</p>

To cut ſhort this Part of the Story, the End of which is to inſtruct Servants in what is their Duty, when little Children come into their Hands, that they are to do more than Dreſs and Undreſs them: and to encourage them to it, I ſay this was the End of this Part. But to cut it ſhort; when <hi>Margy</hi> had heard by her Lady, that there had been ſome Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the Captain making her his Wife, ſhe was more averſe to going away than before, reſolving not to be a Servant in his Family upon any Terms whatſoever: So the Diſcourſe of thoſe Things broke off, and it was not till two Year after, that the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain returning again from Sea, found her out and marry'd her. Indeed ſhe was his Wife when the Youth (for he was then 14 Year old,) who ſhe had firſt brought up, being Fatherleſs and Motherleſs, <hi>as is noted above,</hi> was, by the Courſe of his Father's Will, left to the Care of the Captain; and he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how grateful it would be to his Wife, as well as from a ſincere Affection to the Child, took him Home, and made him like one of his own.</p>
               <p>Here he was uſed with ſuch an Affection, ſuch Tenderneſs, and ſuch Care, that he was far from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any Loſs either of Father or Mother; and after <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  <p>His Wife, in the firſt Part of their living together, bore great part of the Weight, and many a terrible Storm ſhe went thorough with him; which tho' it was very grievous to her, yet ſhe had not that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern upon her, as ſhe had after ſhe had Children; for, <hi>as I have heard her often ſay,</hi> ſhe had not for 20 Years one quiet Day, for fear, that in ſome of his Paſſions, he ſhould ruin one or other of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and perhaps by ſome unhappy Blow kill one of them, which would have finiſhed the Ruin of her Husband and Family.</p>

                     <pb n="379" facs="tcp:1032900302:390"/>
In this Diſtreſs ſhe had need of all her Prudence, tho' ſhe was Miſtreſs of a great deal; and indeed Providence had bleſs'd her with a great deal of Temper, Courage and Wiſdom to know how to act in theſe Exceſſes of her Husband's Paſſions, and how to skreen her Children from the evil Conſequences of it.</p>
                  <p>While they were young, the Weight of their Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation lay wholly upon her; for tho' he was a Man of good Senſe, when he was himſelf, yet he was ſo often out of the Government of himſelf, by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of his Temper, that it was not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected he could do much in the <hi>Inſtruction</hi> of his Children, for whom he did ſo little by <hi>Example.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the other Hand, all Family-Religion was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly deſtroy'd; for tho' at firſt the Man began well enough, and having been religiouſly educated, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in his Family like one reſolv'd to have a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order'd Houſe, yet as our Paſſions like a ſtrong Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper always encreaſe with our Years, ſo the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions perhaps returning oftner, as his Family and Buſineſs encreaſed, and eſpecially by his giving way to them, they gained more upon him, as he grew older: His Fits of Rage returned oftner, dwelt longer upon him, made him more and more ſubject to be provoked, and longer a cooling, when heated; till in ſhort it became a meer Diſeaſe in his Blood, a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order of his Conſtitution, and not only could not be cur'd, but render'd his Temper almoſt unconver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable.</p>
                  <p>Among other Effects of this Poſſeſſion, <hi>for it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd little leſs,</hi> one was this, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That it deſtroy'd the very Face of Order and Religion in the Family.</p>

The Bar fell out of his Hand, and he fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a violent Trembling, as if he had been in the cold Fit of an Ague. His Wife, who was not far off, hearing the Child cry Murther, came running into the Room terribly frighted, you may be ſure, not doubting but he had done the Child ſome Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief; but ſhe ſoon found her Husband more the Object of her Concern than the Child; for he ſtood in that Poſture, like one amaz'd, ſtupid, and ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs for a good while. She run immediately to ferch ſomething to give him, and with much difficulty ſhe got him to take what ſhe brought him, and to ſit down.</p>
                  <p>It was more than an Hour before he came to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf enough to ſpeak, and when he did ſo, the firſt Queſtion he ask'd was, <hi>Is the Child alive?</hi> His Wife who knew from the Boy himſelf, that his Father had not ſtruck him, anſwer'd with ſome ſurprize at the Queſtion, <hi>Alive,</hi> my Dear! <hi>yes; why do you ask ſuch a Queſtion?

                  <p>I'll give you ſome ſhort Inſtances of it in this Family, which perhaps may ſerve as well to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Conduct of the Wife, as to leave an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to all Maſters of Families not to give way to the Violence of their own ungovern'd Follies. Her Husband, by the Violence of his Temper, embroil'd himſelf ſeveral Times, and on ſeveral Occaſions, in very unhappy Quarrels; I do not mean ſuch as were to be decided <hi>by Hand,</hi> or that requir'd him to uſe his Sword, <hi>as a Gentleman;</hi> for being a Citizen, he wore no Sword, nor had he much occaſion to deal with thoſe that did.</p>

                  <p>No, no; I do not underſtand you ſo; if he had ſhown his paſſionate Temper among Gentlemen, as you ſay he did to Others, he might have found a ſhort Way out of the World, and put his Family ſoon out of their Pain.</p>

                  <p>Why, ſhe got Friends to go and make up Breaches, and repair Damages, where it was poſſible to make them up; and that ſhe did ſo often, till ſhe was tir'd with it; and finding no End of the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, there being no hopes to put an end to the Cauſe, ſhe perſuaded him firſt to take his eldeſt Son into his Buſineſs, and after ſome time, his ſecond Son, and then to leave it quite off to them, and retire.</p>

                  <p>Truly, not without many a rude ſcuffle with his Temper, and indeed with her Sons too; for the Father, tho' he was not inſenſible of his own paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate

                  <p>Why, truly, it did look ſomewhat hard; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as it was done deliberately, and with a mature Acknowledgement that he was unfit to converſe with the World, by reaſon of his want of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of himſelf, and that it was finiſh'd and done ſome Time, it could not be reaſonable to turn the young Men out of Buſineſs again, tho' it was at the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of their Father.</p>

                  <p>However, his Violence, and their Unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to diſoblige or obſtruct their Father, made all Things eaſy that way. It happen'd one Day, that he had been at <hi>London</hi> with his Sons, and in their Ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, for he had taken a Houſe at ſome diſtance from the Town; but when he went to Town, uſed to go and ſit in his Sons Compting-Houſe, to do any Buſineſs of his own, or divert himſelf with them: Here he ſaw their Buſineſs went on flouriſhing and ſucceſsful, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another Rate than ever it did under his Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and a ſtrange Uneaſineſs poſſeſt his Mind at the Sight; inſtead of rejoycing that his Sons minded their Buſineſs, agreed, and went Hand in Hand, that they Throve well, and that Buſineſs flowed in upon them; I ſay, inſtead of rejoycing at this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of his Family, which a true Father of his Children would have eſteem'd his own, a Spirit of Envy and Diſcontent ſeized him, and he went away chagrine and melancholy.</p>
                  <p>When he came Home, his Wife perceiv'd a Cloud of Diſcontent ſat upon his Countenance; and tho' ſhe was full of Apprehenſion that he was under ſome violent Diſturbance, yet being willing to abate it as much as poſſible, ſhe went chearfully to him, and ſmiling, ask'd him how he did; he gave her little or no Anſwer at firſt, but after ſome other little En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries,
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:1032900302:402"/>
he flew out upon her with the greateſt Fury imaginable, told her, it was ſhe that had ſupplanted him in his Buſineſs, made him an Invalid to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and a Penſioner to his Children; that her Sons were engroſſing the Wealth of the Family, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that Encreaſe which was his Right; and that ſhe had confederated with them to draw him into a Snare, but added, that he would break all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances that were made uſe of to abuſe him.</p>
                  <p>She could eaſily have anſwer'd every Objection, and with great Diſadvantage to him; but ſhe ſaw he was out of Temper, and ſhe had too much Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to throw Oil into the Fire; but ſhe anſwer'd calmly, that as far as ſhe had any Hand in it, ſhe could not but ſee that it was for his Advantage, and the good of his Family, that ſhe had acted; but that ſhe would, with the ſame Zeal, join with him to break any Contrivance that was for his hurt.</p>

                     <p>Why, <hi>ſays he,</hi> do you talk ſo? Is it not to my hurt to ſee my Sons ſet above me, and, as it were, poſſeſſing my Inheritance before it falls to them? Could they not have ſtaid till my Head was laid?</p>

                     <stage>He goes out of the Room in a great Rage.</stage>
                  </q>
                  <p>Now it is to be obſerv'd here, that the Wife had acted with ſuch Prudence, in the transferring the Trade and Stock to her Sons, <hi>as above,</hi> that ſhe had reſerv'd the whole Stock, with all the Improvements to be their Father's, and to be given up to him when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he demanded it; and tho' all went in their Names, yet they were obliged by Writing to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render it all into their Father's Hand, and only to be allow'd ſuch Expences, and Charges, and Allowan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as had been ſettled between them, not letting the Father know one Word of it: But he having convey'd and made over every thing to them, ſhe, without telling him of it, took a Declaration of Truſt back again from her Sons, expreſſing the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Truſt alſo. And as ſhe had done this, becauſe ſhe knew his changeable Diſpoſition and fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Temper, ſo ſhe was not ſo much concern'd at the Conſequence of his preſent Paſſion, becauſe ſhe knew her Sons would behave as became them, when their Father came to them, whatever want of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per he might ſhow to them; however, ſhe immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſent them Word of what had paſs'd, and what they might expect, that they might not be ſurpriz'd.</p>
                  <p>It was but a few Minutes afterwards, but he came himſelf, and entering the Warehouſe, he found his Sons both there, but very buſy with Cuſtomers, ſo he went into the Compting-houſe, and ſat ſtill a while; but his Paſſion was too hot to be kept within Bounds, and his eldeſt Son, who ſaw by his Countenance that his Father was very much diſturbed, made all the Diſpatch poſſible to get clear of the People he
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:1032900302:408"/>
was engag'd with, leſt his Father ſhould call, and ſhould break out into a Paſſion that might expoſe him.</p>
                  <p>It was not long before his Father, <hi>who could hold no longer,</hi> calls him, and he comes immediately. The Dialogue was very ſhort, but very warm on one Side; and had not all poſſible Occaſion been taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, by the Conduct of both his Sons, the Temper he was in at that Time would have made an Uproar even in the Street. He began with the eldeſt Son as ſoon as he came but to the Door of the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſe thus:</p>

                  <p>He was not touch'd with it at all at firſt; but taking his Sons, <hi>as it were,</hi> at their Words, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately took Poſſeſſion of the Books and Caſh, and the Sons, with the greateſt Calmneſs and apparent Satisfaction, threw off their Hats, and put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the Poſture of Servants: His greateſt Diſſatisfaction was, that he could not have the leaſt Occaſion to be angry.</p>
                  <p>After he had chaft his Mind as much, and indeed more than the Caſe would bear, and had thus em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſs'd himſelf into the Hurry of the World again; ſo that he ſaw himſelf, in a few Moments, a Man remov'd from a pleaſant agreeable Retreat, fully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd again in a vaſt Crowd of Incumbrances; the Proſpect began to appear leſs agreeable to him than he thought it before, and full of Diſcontent he comes away, having been perfectly diſappointed of the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel which he expected to have with his two Sons.</p>
                  <p>When he came Home again, he thinks to gratify the Fury of his Temper upon his Wife; his Spirits were in agitation, and Nature requir'd to give them a Vent ſomewhere; the ſubmiſſive reſpectful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of his Sons had effectually diſappointed him there, and even for want of an Object, he reſolves to fall upon his Wife; accordingly, as ſoon as he comes Home, he begins with her, very hot and angry ſtill.</p>
