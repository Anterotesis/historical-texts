            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING by ſeveral years of continual ſtudy treaſured in my mind a great number of principles and ideas, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by frequent exerciſe the power of applying them with propriety, and combining them with readineſs, I reſolved to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1098200104:3"/>
quit the univerſity, where I conſidered myſelf as a gem hidden in the mine, and to mingle in the croud of publick life. I was naturally attracted by the company of thoſe who were of the ſame age with myſelf, and finding that my academical gravity contributed very little to my reputation, applied my faculties to jocularity and burleſque. Thus, in a ſhort time, I had heated my imagination to ſuch a ſtate of activity and ebullition, that upon every occaſion it fumed away in burſts of wit, and evaporations of gaiety. I became on a ſudden the idol of the coffee-houſe, was in one winter ſollicited to accept the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentſhip of five clubs, was dragged by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to every new play, and quoted in every controverſy upon theatrical merit; was in every publick place ſurrounded by a multitude of humble auditors, who retailed in other places of reſort my maxims and my jeſts, and was boaſted as their intimate and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion by many, who had no other pretenſions to my acquaintance, than that they had drank chocolate in the ſame room.</p>
                     <p>YOU will not wonder, Mr. RAMBLER, that I mention my ſucceſs with ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1098200104:4"/>
of triumph and elevation. Perhaps no kind of ſuperiority is more flattering or alluring than that which is conferred by the powers of converſation, by extemporaneous ſprightlineſs of fancy, copiouſneſs of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and fertility of ſentiment. In other exertions of genius, the greateſt part of the praiſe is unknown and unenjoyed; the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, indeed, ſpreads his reputation to a wider extent, but receives little pleaſure or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from the diffuſion of his name, and only obtains a kind of nominal ſovereignty over regions which pay no tribute. The col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquial wit has always his own radiance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected on himſelf, and enjoys all the pleaſure which he beſtows; he finds his power con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by every one that approaches him, ſees friendſhip kindling with rapture, and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſwelling into praiſe.</p>
                     <p>THE deſire which every man feels of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance and eſteem is ſo much gratified by finding an aſſembly, at his entrance, brighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with gladneſs and huſhed with expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the recollection of ſuch diſtinctions can ſcarcely fail to be pleaſing whenſoever it is innocent. And my conſcience does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1098200104:5"/>
me with any mean or criminal effects of vanity; ſince I always employed my influence on the ſide of virtue, and never ſacrificed my underſtanding or my religion to the pleaſure of applauſe.</p>
                     <p>THERE were many whom either the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of enjoying my pleaſantry, or the pride of being thought to enjoy it, brought often into my company; but I was careſſed in a particular manner by <hi>Demochares,</hi> a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of a large eſtate, and a liberal diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. My fortune was by no means exube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and therefore I was not diſpleaſed with a friend who was willing to be entertained at his own charge. I became by daily invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions habituated to his table, and, as he had perſuaded himſelf to believe my acquaintance neceſſary to the character of elegance, which he was deſirous of eſtabliſhing, I lived in all the luxury of affluence without expence or dependence, and paſſed my life in a perpetual reciprocation of pleaſure with men whom ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of accompliſhments or deſire of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement crouded about us.</p>
                     <p>BUT all power has its ſphere of activity, beyond which it produces no effect. <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chares</hi>
                        <pb n="5" facs="tcp:1098200104:6"/>
being called by his affairs into the country, imagined that he ſhould encreaſe his reputation and popularity by coming among his neighbours accompanied by a man whoſe abilities were ſo generally allowed. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port preſently ſpread thro' half the county that <hi>Demochares</hi> was arrived, and had brought with him the celebrated <hi>Hilarius,</hi> by whom ſuch merriment would be excited, as had never been enjoyed or conceived before. I knew, indeed, the purpoſe for which I was invited, and, as men do not look diligently out for poſſible miſcarriages, was pleaſed to find myſelf courted upon principles of intereſt, and conſidered as capable of reconciling fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, compoſing feuds, and uniting a whole province in ſocial happineſs.</p>
                     <p>AFTER a few days ſpent in adjuſting his domeſtick regulations, <hi>Demochares</hi> invited all the gentlemen of his neighbourhood to dinner, and did not forget to hint how much my preſence was expected to heighten the pleaſure of the feaſt. He informed me what prejudices my reputation had raiſed in my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and repreſented the ſatisfaction with which he ſhould ſee me kindle up the blaze
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1098200104:7"/>
of merriment, and ſhould remark the various effects that my fire would have upon ſuch diverſity of matter.</p>
                     <p>THIS declaration, by which he intended to quicken my vivacity, filled me with ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. I felt an ambition of ſhining, which I never knew before; and was therefore em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſed with an unuſual fear of diſgrace. I paſſed the night in planning out to myſelf the converſation of the coming day; recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected all my topicks of raillery, propoſed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſubjects of ridicule, prepared ſmart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies to a thouſand queſtions, accommodated anſwers to imaginary repartees, and formed a magazine of remarks, apophthegms, tales, and illuſtrations.</p>
                     <p>THE morning broke at laſt in the midſt of theſe buſy meditations. I roſe with the palpitations of a champion on the day of combat; and, notwithſtanding all my efforts, found my ſpirits ſunk under the weight of expectation. The company ſoon after began to drop in, and every one, at his entrance, was introduced to <hi>Hilarius.</hi> What concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the inhabitants of this region had formed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1098200104:8"/>
of a wit, I cannot yet diſcover, but obſerved that they all ſeemed after the regular exchange of compliments to turn away diſappointed, and that while we waited for dinner, they caſt their eyes firſt upon me, and then upon each other, like a theatrical aſſembly waiting for a ſhew.</p>
                     <p>FROM the uneaſineſs of this ſituation, I was relieved by the dinner, and as every atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was taken up by the buſineſs of the hour, I ſunk quietly to a level with the reſt of the company. But no ſooner were the diſhes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, than inſtead of chearful confidence and familiar prattle, an univerſal ſilence again ſhewed their expectation of ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual performane. My friend endeavoured to rouſe them by healths and queſtions, but they anſwered him with great brevity, and immediately relapſed into their former taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnity.</p>
                     <p>I HAD waited in hope of ſome opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to divert them, but could find no paſs opened for a ſingle ſally; and who can be merry without an object of mirth? After a few faint efforts, which produced neither ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1098200104:9"/>
nor oppoſition, I was content to min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle with the maſs, to put round the glaſs in ſilence, and ſolace myſelf with my own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations.</p>
                     <p>MY friend looked round him; the gueſts ſtared at one another; and if now and then a few ſyllables were uttered with timidity and heſitation, there was none ready to make any reply. All our faculties were frozen, and every minute took away from our capacity of pleaſing, and diſpoſition to be pleaſed. Thus paſſed the hours to which ſo much happineſs was decreed; the hours which had, by a kind of open proclamation, been devoted to wit, to mirth, and to <hi>Hilarius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>AT laſt the night came on, and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of parting freed us from the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of each other. I heard them as they walked along the court murmuring at the loſs of the day, and enquiring whether any man would pay a ſecond viſit to a houſe haunted by a wit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Demochares,</hi> whoſe Benevolence is greater than his penetration, having flattered his hopes with the ſecondary honour which he
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1098200104:10"/>
was to gain by my ſprightlineſs and elegance, and the affection with which he ſhould be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for a perpetual banquet of gaiety, was not able to conceal his vexation and reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor would eaſily be perſuaded but that I had ſacrificed his intereſt to fullenneſs and caprice, had ſtudiouſly endeavoured to diſguſt his gueſts, and ſuppreſſed my powers of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting, in obſtinate and premeditated ſilence. I am informed that the reproach of their ill reception is divided by the gentlemen of the country between us; ſome being of opinion that my friend is deluded by an impoſtor, who, though he has found ſome art of gaining his favour, is afraid to ſpeak before men of more penetration; and others concluding that I think only <hi>London</hi> the proper theatre of my abilities, and diſdain to exert my ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius for the praiſe of ruſticks.</p>
                     <p>I BELIEVE, Mr. RAMBLER, that it has ſometimes happened to others, who have the good or ill fortune to be celebrated for wits, to fall under the ſame cenſures upon the like occaſions. I hope therefore that you will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any miſrepreſentations of ſuch failures, by remarking that invention is not wholly at
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1098200104:11"/>
the command of its poſſeſſor; that the power of pleaſing is very often obſtructed by the deſire; that all expectation leſſens ſurprize, yet ſome ſurprize is neceſſary to gaiety; and that thoſe who deſire to partake of the pleaſure of wit muſt contribute to its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, ſince the mind ſtagnates without external ventilation, and that efferveſcence of the fancy, which flaſhes into tranſport, can be raſed only by the infuſion of diſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ideas.</p>

years of ripened manhood, then the better and more pleaſing part of old age." The peruſal of this paſſage, having excited in me a train of reflections on the ſtate of man, the inceſſant fluctuation of his wiſhes, the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual change of his diſpoſition to all external objects, and the thoughtleſneſs with which he floats along the ſtream of time, I ſunk in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſlumber amidſt my meditations, and, on a ſudden, found my ears filled with the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult of labour, the ſhouts of alacrity, the ſhrieks of alarm, the whiſtle of winds, and the daſh of waters.</p>

of ſecurity, than the care of the pilot, whom it was always in our power to chooſe among great numbers that offered their direction and aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>I THEN looked round with anxious eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: and firſt turning my eyes behind me, ſaw a ſtream flowing through flowery iſlands, which every one that ſailed along ſeemed to behold with pleaſure; but no ſooner touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than the current, which, though not noiſy or turbulent, was yet irreſiſtible, bore him away. Beyond theſe iſlands all was dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nor could any of the paſſengers deſcribe the ſhore at which he firſt embarked.</p>
               <p>BEFORE me, and each other ſide, was an expanſe of waters violently agitated, and covered with ſo thick a miſt, that the moſt perſpicacious eye could ſee but a little way. It appeared to be full of rocks and whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pools, for many ſunk unexpectedly while they were courting the gale with full ſails, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting thoſe whom they had left behind. So numerous, indeed, were the dangers, and ſo thick the darkneſs, that no caution could confer ſecurity. Yet there were many, who,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1098200104:14"/>
by falſe intelligence, betrayed their followers into whirlpools, or by violence puſhed thoſe whom they found in their way againſt the rocks.</p>
               <p>THE current was invariable and inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mountable; but though it was impoſſible to ſail againſt it, or to return to the place that was once paſſed, yet it was not ſo violent as to allow no opportunities for dexterity or courage, ſince, though none could retreat back from danger, yet they might often avoid it by oblique direction.</p>
               <p>IT was, however, not very common to ſteer with much care or prudence; for, by ſome univerſal infatuation, every man appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to think himſelf ſafe, though he ſaw his conſorts every moment ſinking round him; and no ſooner had the waves cloſed over them, than their fate and their miſconduct were forgotten; the voyage was perſued with the ſame jocund confidence; every man congratulated himſelf upon the ſoundneſs of his veſſel, and believed himſelf able to ſtem the whirlpool in which his friend was ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or glide over the rocks on which he was
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1098200104:15"/>
daſhed; nor was it often obſerved that the ſight of a wreck made any man change his courſe; if he turned aſide for a moment, he ſoon forgot the rudder, and left himſelf again to the diſpoſal of chance.</p>
               <p>THIS negligence did not proceed from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference, or from wearineſs of their preſent condition; for not one of thoſe, who thus ruſhed upon deſtruction, failed, when he was ſinking, to call loudly upon his aſſociates for that help which could not now be given him; and many ſpent their laſt moments in caution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others againſt the folly, by which they were intercepted in the midſt of their courſe. Their benevolence was ſometimes praiſed, but their admonitions were unregarded.</p>
               <p>THE veſſels, in which we had embarked, being confeſſedly unequal to the turbulence of the ſtream of life, were viſibly impaired in the courſe of the voyage; ſo that every paſſenger was certain, that how long ſoever he might, by favourable accidents, or by inceſſant vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, be preſerved, he muſt ſink at laſt.</p>
               <p>THIS neceſſity of periſhing might have been
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1098200104:16"/>
expected to ſadden the gay, and intimidate the daring, at leaſt to keep the melancholy and timorous in perpetual torments, and hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them from any enjoyment of the varieties and gratifications which nature offered them as the ſolace of their labours; yet in effect none ſeemed leſs to expect deſtruction than thoſe to whom it was moſt dreadful; they all had the art of concealing their danger from themſelves; and thoſe who knew their inability to bear the ſight of the terrors that embarraſſed their way, took care never to look forward, but found ſome amuſement for the preſent moment, and generally enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained themſelves by playing with HOPE, who was the conſtant aſſociate of the voyage of life.</p>
               <p>YET all that HOPE ventured to promiſe, even to thoſe whom ſhe favoured moſt, was, not that they ſhould eſcape, but that they ſhould ſink laſt; and with this promiſe every one was ſatisfied, though he laughed at the reſt for ſeeming to believe it. HOPE, indeed, apparently mocked the credulity of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions; for in proportion as their veſſels grew leaky, ſhe redoubled her aſſurances of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1098200104:17"/>
ſafety; and none were more buſy in making proviſions for a long voyage, than they, whom all but themſelves ſaw likely to periſh ſoon by irreparable decay.</p>
               <p>IN the midſt of the current of life was the <hi>gulph of</hi> INTEMPERANCE, a dreadful whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pool, interſperſed with rocks, of which the pointed crags were concealed under water, and the tops covered with herbage, on which EASE ſpread couches of repoſe, and with ſhades, where PLEASURE warbled the ſong of invitation. Within ſight of theſe rocks all who ſailed on the ocean of life muſt neceſſarily paſs. REASON, indeed, was always at hand to ſteer the paſſengers through a narrow out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let by which they might eſcape; but very few could, by her intreaties or remonſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, be induced to put the rudder into her hand, without ſtipulating that ſhe ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach ſo near unto the rocks of PLEASURE, that they might ſolace themſelves with a ſhort enjoyment of that delicious region, after which they always determined to perſue their courſe without any other deviation.</p>
               <p>REASON was too often prevailed upon ſo
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1098200104:18"/>
far by theſe promiſes, as to venture her charge within the eddy of the gulph of IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TEMPERANCE, where, indeed, the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution was weak, but yet interrupted the courſe of the veſſel, and drew it, by inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible rotations, towards the centre. She then repented her temerity, and with all her force endeavoured to retreat; but the draught of the gulph was generally too ſtrong to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; and the paſſenger, having danced in circles with a pleaſing and giddy velocity, was at laſt overwhelmed and loſt. Thoſe few whom REASON was able to extricate, generally ſuffered ſo many ſhocks upon the points which ſhot out from the rocks of PLEASURE, that they were unable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue their courſe with the ſame ſtrength and facility as before, but floated along timorouſly and feebly, endangered by every breeze, and ſhattered by every ruffle of the water, till they ſunk, by ſlow degrees, after long ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, and innumerable expedients, always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining at their own folly, and warning others againſt the firſt approach to the gulph of IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TEMPERANCE.</p>
               <p>THERE were artiſts who profeſſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1098200104:19"/>
the breaches and ſtop the leaks of the veſſels which had been ſhattered on the rocks of PLEASURE. Many appeared to have great confidence in their ſkill, and ſome, indeed, were preſerved by it from ſinking, who had received only a ſingle blow; but I remarked that few veſſels laſted long which had been much repaired, nor was it found that the artiſts themſelves continued afloat longer than thoſe who had leaſt of their aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>THE only advantage, which, in the voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of life, the cautious had above the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, was, that they ſunk later, and more ſuddenly; for they paſſed forward till they had ſometimes ſeen all thoſe in whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany they had iſſued from the ſtreights of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, periſh in the way, and at laſt were overſet by a croſs breeze, without the toil of reſiſtance, or the anguiſh of expectation. But ſuch as had often fallen againſt the rocks of PLEASURE, commonly ſubſided by ſenſible degrees, contended long with the encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing waters, and haraſſed themſelves by la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours that ſcarce HOPE herſelf could flatter with ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:1098200104:20"/>
AS I was looking upon the various fate of the multitude about me, I was ſuddenly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed with an admonition from ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Power, "Gaze not idly upon others when thou thyſelf art ſinking. Whence is this thoughtleſs tranquillity, when thou and they are equally endangered?" I look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſeeing the gulph of INTEMPE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RANCE before me, ſtarted and awaked.</p>

               <p>CURIOSITY is one of the permanent and certain characteriſticks of a vigorous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ellect, to which every advance into knowledge opens new proſpects, and produces new incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to farther progreſs. All the attainments poſſible in our preſent ſtate are evidently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adequate to our capacities of enjoyment; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt ſerves no purpoſe but that of kindling ambition, diſcovery has no effect but of raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1098200104:21"/>
expectation; the gratification of one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire encourages another, and after all our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, ſtudies, and enquiries, we are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally at the ſame diſtance from the completion of our ſchemes, have ſtill ſome wiſh impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate to be ſatisfied, and ſome faculty reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and mutinous for want of employment.</p>
               <p>THE deſire of knowledge, though it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten animated by extrinſick and adventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious motives, ſeems on many occaſions to operate without ſubordination to any other principle; we are eager to ſee and hear, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intention of referring our obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to a farther end; we climb a mountain for a proſpect of the plain; we run to the ſtrand in a ſtorm, that we may contemplate the agitation of the water; we range from city to city, though we profeſs neither archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture nor fortification; we croſs ſeas only to view nature in nakedneſs, or magnificence in ruins; we are equally allured by novelty of every kind, by a deſart or a palace, a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taract or a cavern, by every thing rude, and every thing poliſhed, every thing great and every thing little; we do not ſee a thicket
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1098200104:22"/>
but with ſome temptation to enter it, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark an inſect flying before us but with an inclination to perſue it.</p>
               <p>THIS paſſion is, perhaps, regularly height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened in proportion as the powers of the mind are elevated and enlarged. <hi>Lucan</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore introduces <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſpeaking with dignity ſuitable to the grandeur of his deſigns and the extent of his capacity, when he declares to the high prieſt of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that he has no deſire equally powerful with that of finding the origin of the <hi>Nile,</hi> and that he would quit all the projects of the civil war for a ſight of thoſe fountains which had been ſo long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed. And <hi>Homer,</hi> when he would furniſh the <hi>Sirens</hi> with a temptation, to which his hero, renowned for wiſdom, might yield without diſgrace, makes them declare, that none ever departed from them but with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of knowledge.</p>
               <p>THERE is, indeed, ſcarce any kind of ideal acquirement which may not be applied to ſome uſe, or which may not at leaſt gratify pride with occaſional ſuperiority; but who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever attends the motions of his own mind
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1098200104:23"/>
will find, that upon the firſt appearance of an object, or the firſt ſtart of a queſtion, his inclination to a nearer view, or more accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate diſcuſſion, precedes all thoughts of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, or of competition; and that his deſires take wing by inſtantaneous impulſe, though their flight may be invigorated, or their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts renewed, by ſubſequent conſiderations. The gratification of curioſity rather frees us from uneaſineſs than confers pleaſure; we are more pained by ignorance than delighted by inſtruction. Curioſity is the thirſt of the ſoul; it inflames and torments us, and makes us taſte every thing with joy, however other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe inſipid, by which it may be quenched.</p>
               <p>IT is evident that the earlieſt ſearchers after knowledge muſt have propoſed knowledge only as their reward; and that ſcience, though perhaps the nurſling of intereſt, was the daughter of curioſity: for who can believe that they who firſt watched the courſe of the ſtars, foreſaw the uſe of their diſcoveries to the facilitation of commerce, or the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuration of time? They were delighted with the ſplendor of the nocturnal ſkies, they found that the lights changed their places, what they
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1098200104:24"/>
admired they were anxious to underſtand, and in time traced their revolutions.</p>
               <p>THERE are, indeed, beings in the form of men, who appear ſatisfied with their intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual poſſeſſions, and ſeem to live without deſire of enlarging their conceptions; before whom the world paſſes without notice, and who are equally unmoved by nature or by art.</p>
               <p>THIS negligence is ſometimes only the temporary effect of a predominant paſſion; a lover finds no inclination to travel any path, but that which leads to the habitation of his miſtreſs; a trader can ſpare little attention to common occurrences, when his fortune is endangered by a ſtorm. It is frequently the conſequence of a total immerſion in ſenſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: corporeal pleaſures may be indulged till the memory of every other kind of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs is obliterated; the mind long habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to a lethargick and quieſcent ſtate, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to wake to the toil of thinking; and though ſhe may ſometimes be diſturbed by the obtruſion of new ideas, ſhrinks back again to ignorance and reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:1098200104:25"/>
BUT, indeed, if we except them to whom the continual taſk of procuring the ſupports of life, denies all opportunities of deviation from their own narrow track, the number of ſuch as live without the ardour of enquiry, is very ſmall, though many content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with cheap amuſements, and waſte their lives in reſearches of no importance.</p>
               <p>THERE is no ſnare more dangerous to buſy and excurſive minds, than the cobwebs of petty inquiſitiveneſs, which entangle them in trivial employments and minute ſtudies, and detain them in a middle ſtate between the tediouſneſs of total inactivity, and the fatigue of laborious efforts, enchant them at once with eaſe and novelty, and vitiate them with the luxury of learning. The neceſſity of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomething, and the fear of undertaking much, ſinks the hiſtorian to a genealogiſt, the philoſopher to a journaliſt of the weather, and the mathematician to a conſtructer of dials.</p>
               <p>IT is happy when thoſe who cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves to be idle, nor reſolve to be
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1098200104:26"/>
induſtrious, are at leaſt employed without injury to others; but it ſeldom happens that we can contain ourſelves long in a neutral ſtate, or forbear to ſink into vice, when we are no longer ſoaring towards virtue.</p>
               <p>NUGACULUS was diſtinguiſhed in his ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier years by an uncommon livelineſs of imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, quickneſs of ſagacity, and extent of knowledge. When after having paſſed through the uſual methods of education, he entered into life, he applied himſelf with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inquiſitiveneſs to examine the various motives of human actions, the complicated influence of mingled affections, the different modifications of intereſt and ambition, and the various cauſes of miſcarriage and ſucceſs both in public and private affairs.</p>
               <p>THOUGH his friends did not diſcover to what purpoſe all theſe obſervations were col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, or how <hi>Nugaculus</hi> would much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove his virtue or his fortune by an inceſſant attention to changes of countenance, burſts of inconſideration, ſallies of paſſion, and all the other caſualties by which he uſed to trace a character, yet they could not deny the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1098200104:27"/>
ſtudy of human nature to be worthy of a wiſe man; they therefore flattered his vanity, applauded his diſcoveries, and liſtened with ſubmiſſive modeſty to his lectures on the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of inclination, the weakneſs of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves, and the inſtability of temper, to his account of the various motives which agitate the mind, and his ridicule of the modern dream of a ruling paſſion.</p>
               <p>SUCH was the firſt incitement of <hi>Nuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus</hi> to a cloſe inſpection into the conduct of mankind. He had no intereſt in view, and therefore no deſign of ſupplantation; he had no malevolence, and therefore detected faults without any intention to expoſe them; but having once found the art of engaging his attention upon others, he had no inclination to call it back to himſelf, but has paſſed his time in keeping a watchful eye upon every riſing character, and lived upon a ſmall eſtate without any thought of encreaſing it.</p>
               <p>HE is, by continual application, become a general maſter of ſecret hiſtory, and can give an account of the intrigues, private marriages, competitions, and ſtratagems of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1098200104:28"/>
half a century. He knows the mortgages upon every man's eſtate, the terms upon which every ſpendthrift raiſes his money, the real and reputed fortune of every lady, the jointure ſtipulated by every contract, and the expectations of every family from maiden aunts and childleſs acquaintances. He can relate the economy of every houſe, knows how much one man's cellar is robbed by his butler, and the land of another underlet by his ſteward; he can tell where the manor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe is falling, though large ſums are yearly paid for repairs; and where the tenants are felling woods without the conſent of the owner.</p>
               <p>TO obtain all this intelligence he is inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertently guilty of a thouſand acts of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery. He ſees no man's ſervant without draining him of his truſt; he enters no family without flattering the children into diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries; he is a perpetual ſpy upon the doors of his neighbours; and knows, by long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, at whatever diſtance, the looks of a creditor, a borrower, a lover, and a pimp.</p>
               <p>NUGACULUS is not ill-natured, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1098200104:29"/>
his induſtry has not hither to been very miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous to others, or dangerous to himſelf; but ſince he cannot enjoy this knowledge but by diſcovering it, and, if he had no other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to loquacity, is obliged to traffick like the chymiſts, and purchaſe one ſecret with another, he is every day more hated as he is more known; for he is conſidered by great numbers as one that has their fame and their happineſs in his power, and no man can much love him of whom he lives in fear.</p>
               <p>THUS has an intention, innocent at firſt, if not laudable, the intention of regulating his own behaviour by the experience of others, betrayed <hi>Nugaculus</hi> not only to a fooliſh, but vicious waſte of a life which might have been honourably paſſed in public ſervices, or dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtic virtues. Such is the fate of all exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive deſires, and ſuch the conſequence of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the mind to employments that engroſs, but do not improve it.</p>

               <p>THE apparent inſufficiency of every individual to his own happineſs or ſafety, compels us to ſeek from one another aſſiſtance and ſupport. The neceſſity of joint efforts for the execution of any great or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive deſign, the variety of powers diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeminated in the ſpecies, and the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the defects and excellencies of different perſons, demand an interchange of help, and communication of intelligence, and by frequent reciprocations of beneficence, unite mankind in ſociety and friendſhip.</p>
               <p>IF it can be imagined that there ever was a time when the inhabitants of any country were in a ſtate of equality, without diſtinction of rank, or peculiarity of poſſeſſions, it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to believe that every man was then loved in proportion as he could contribute by his ſtrength, or his ſkill, to the ſupply of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1098200104:31"/>
wants; that there was little room for pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh diſlike, or capricious favour; that the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction then admitted into the heart, was rather eſteem than tenderneſs; and that kindneſs was only purchaſed by benefits. But when by force or policy, by wiſdom or by fortune, property and ſuperiority were introduced and eſtabliſhed, ſo that many were condemned to labour for the ſupport of a few, then they whoſe poſſeſſions ſwelled above their wants, naturally laid out their ſuper fluities upon pleaſure; and thoſe who could not gain friendſhip by neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary offices, endeavoured to promote their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt by luxurious gratifications, and to create need, which they might be courted to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</p>
               <p>THE deſires of mankind are ſo much more numerous than their attainments, and the capacity of imagination ſo much larger than actual enjoyment, that no power of beſtowing can equal expectation. Every diſtant appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of advantage muſt therefore excite ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles and competitions; that which can be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained only by one will be deſired by multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, while there remain multitudes unſatisfied with their allotment; and he who cannot hope
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1098200104:32"/>
to ſucceed by real ſervices, and either finds no room for the exertion of great qualities, or perceives himſelf excelled by his rivals, will have recourſe to other expedients, will endeavour to become agreeable where he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be important, and learn, by degrees, to number the <hi>art of pleaſing</hi> among the moſt uſeful ſtudies, and moſt valuable acquiſitions.</p>
               <p>THIS art, like others, is cultivated in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to its uſefulneſs, and will always flouriſh moſt where it is moſt rewarded: for this reaſon we find it practiſed with great aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiduity under abſolute governments, where honours and riches are in the hands of one man, whom all endeavour to propitiate, and who ſoon becomes ſo much accuſtomed to compliance and officiouſneſs, as not eaſily to find, in the moſt delicate addreſs, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty which is neceſſary to procure attention.</p>
               <p>IT is diſcovered by a very few experiments, that no man is much pleaſed with a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, who does not encreaſe, in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, his fondneſs of himſelf; and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he that wiſhes rather to be led forward to proſperity by the gentle hand of favour,

than to force his way by labour and merit, muſt conſider with more care how to diſplay his patron's excellencies than his own; that whenever he approaches, he may fill the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination with pleaſing dreams, and chaſe away diſguſt and wearineſs by a perpetual ſucceſſion of delightful images.</p>
               <p>THIS may, indeed, ſometimes be effected by turning the attention upon advantages which are really poſſeſſed, or upon proſpects which reaſon ſpreads before hope; for, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever can deſerve or require to be courted has generally, either from nature or from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, gifts, which he may review with ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and of which when he is artfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called to the contemplation, he will ſeldom be diſpleaſed.</p>
               <p>BUT thoſe who have once degraded their underſtanding to an application only to the paſſions, and who have learned to derive hope from any other ſources than induſtry and virtue, ſeldom retain dignity and magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity ſufficient to defend them againſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant recurrence of temptation to falſhood. He that is too deſirous to be loved will ſoon
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1098200104:34"/>
learn to flatter, and when he has exhauſted all the variations of honeſt praiſe, and can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light no longer with the civility of truth, he will invent new topics of panegyric, and break out into raptures at virtues and beauties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred by himſelf.</p>
               <p>THE drudgeries of dependence would, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, be aggravated by hopeleſneſs of ſucceſs, if no indulgence was allowed to adulation. He that will obſtinately confine his patron to hear only the commendations which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, will ſoon be forced to give way to others that regale him with more compaſs of muſic. The greateſt human virtue bears no proportion to human vanity. We always think ourſelves better than we are, and are generally deſirous that others ſhould think us ſtill better than we think ourſelves. To praiſe us for actions, or diſpoſitions, which deſerve praiſe, is not to confer a benefit, but to pay a tribute. We have always pretenſions to fame, which, in our own hearts, we know to be diſputable, and which we are deſirous to ſtrengthen by a new fuffrage; we have always hopes which we ſuſpect to be falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1098200104:35"/>
and of which we eagerly ſnatch at every confirmation.</p>
               <p>IT may, indeed, be proper to make the firſt approaches under the conduct of truth, and to ſecure credit to future encomiums, by ſuch praiſe as may be ratified by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; but the mind once habituated to the luſciouſneſs of eulogy, becomes in a ſhort time nice and faſtidious, and like a vitiated palate is inceſſantly calling for higher grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications.</p>
               <p>IT is ſcarcely credible how far diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be dazzled by the miſt of pride, and wiſdom infatuated by the intoxica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of flattery; or how low the genius may deſcend by ſucceſſive gradations of ſervility, and how ſwiftly it may fall down the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice of falſhood. No man can, indeed, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve without indignation, on what names, both of antient and modern times, the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt exuberance of praiſe has been laviſhed, and by what hands it has been beſtowed. It has never yet been found, that the tyrant, the plunderer, the oppreſſor, the moſt hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of the hateful, the moſt profligate of the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1098200104:36"/>
profligate, have been denied any celebrations which they were willing to purchaſe, or that wickedneſs and folly have not found corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent flatterers through all their ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, except when they have been aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated with avarice or poverty, and have want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either inclination or ability to hire a pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyriſt.</p>
               <p>AS there is no character ſo deformed as to fright away from it the proſtitutes of praiſe, there is no degree of encomiaſtic veneration which pride has refuſed. The emperors of <hi>Rome</hi> ſuffered themſelves to be worſhiped in their lives with altars and ſacrifice; and in an age more enlightened the terms peculiar to the praiſe and worſhip of the Supreme Being, have been applied to wretches whom it was the reproach of humanity to number among men; and whom nothing but riches or power hindered thoſe that read or wrote their deifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, from hunting into the toils of juſtice, as diſturbers of the peace of nature.</p>
               <p>THERE are, indeed, many among the poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical flatterers, who muſt be reſigned to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy without vindication, and whom we muſt
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1098200104:37"/>
confeſs to have deſerted the cauſe of virtue for pay; They have committed, againſt full conviction, the crime of obliterating the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions between good and evil, and, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of oppoſing the encroachments of vice, have incited her progreſs, and celebrated her conqueſts. But there is a lower claſs of ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cophants, whoſe underſtanding has not made them capable of equal guilt. Every man of high rank is ſurrounded with numbers, who have no other rule of thought or action, than his maxims, and his conduct; whom the honour of being numbered among his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, reconciles to all his vices, and all his abſurdities; and who eaſily perſuade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to eſteem him, by whoſe regard they conſider themſelves as diſtinguiſhed and exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>IT is dangerous for mean minds to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture themſelve within the ſphere of greatneſs. Stupidity is ſoon blinded by the ſplendour of wealth, and cowardice is eaſily fettered in the ſhackles of dependence. To ſolicit patron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, is, at leaſt in the event, to ſet virtue to ſale. None can be pleaſed without praiſe, and few can be praiſed without falſhood;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1098200104:38"/>
few can be affiduous without ſervility, and none can be ſervile without corruption.</p>

               <p>I Was lately conſidering among other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of ſpeculation, the new attempt of an <hi>univerſal regiſter,</hi> an office, in which every man may lodge an account of his ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities and wants, of whatever he deſires to purchaſe, or to ſell. My imagination ſoon preſented to me the latitude to which this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign may be extended by integrity and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, and the advantages which may be juſtly hoped from a general mart of intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, when once its reputation ſhall be ſo eſtabliſhed, that neither reproach nor fraud ſhall be feared from it; when an application to it ſhall not be cenſured as the laſt reſource of deſperation, nor its informations ſuſpected as the fortuitious ſuggeſtions of men obliged
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1098200104:39"/>
not to appear ignorant. A place where every exuberance may be diſcharged, and every deficiency ſupplied, where every law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful paſſion may find its gratifications, and every honeſt curioſity receive ſatisfaction, where the ſtock of a nation, pecuniary and intellectual, may be brought together, and where all conditions of humanity may hope to find relief, pleaſure, and accommodation, muſt equally deſerve the attention of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant and philoſopher, of him who mingles in the tumult of buſineſs, and him who only lives to amuſe himſelf with the various em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments and purſuits of others. Nor will it be an uninſtructing ſchool to the greateſt maſters of method and diſpatch, if ſuch mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity can be preſerved from embarraſment, and ſuch tumult from inaccuracy.</p>
               <p>WHILE I was concerting this ſplendid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and filling my thoughts with its regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, its conveniencies, its variety, and its conſequences, I ſunk gradually into ſlumber; but the ſame images, though leſs diſtinct, ſtill continued to float upon my fancy. I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived myſelf at the gate of an immenſe edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, where innumerable multitudes were
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1098200104:40"/>
paſſing without confuſion; every face on which I fixed my eyes, ſeemed ſettled in the contemplation of ſome important purpoſe, and every foot was haſtened by eagerneſs and expectation. I followed the croud without knowing whither I ſhould be drawn, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained a while in the unpleaſing ſtate of an idler where all other beings were buſy, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place every moment to thoſe who had more importance in their looks. Aſhamed to ſtand ignorant, and afraid to aſk queſtions, at laſt I ſaw a lady ſweeping by me, whom, by the quickneſs of her eyes, the agility of her ſteps, and a mixture of levity and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, I knew to be my long loved pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectreſs, CURIOSITY. "Great goddeſs," ſaid I, "may thy votary be permitted to implore thy favour; if thou haſt been my directreſs from the firſt dawn of reaſon, if I have followed thee through the maze of life with invariable fidelity, if I have turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to every new call, and quitted at thy nod one perſuit for another, if I have never ſtopped at the invitations of fortune, nor forgot thy authority in the bowers of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, inform me now whither chance has conducted me."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:1098200104:41"/>
"THOU art now," replied the ſmiling power, "in the preſence of JUSTICE, and of TRUTH, whom the father of gods and men has ſent down to regiſter the demands and pretenſions of mankind, that the world may at laſt be reduced to order, and that none may complain hereafter of beîng doomed to taſks for which they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified, of poſſeſſing faculties for which they cannot find employment, or virtues that languiſh unobſerved for want of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to exert them, of being encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered with ſuperfluities which they would willingly reſign, or of waſting away in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires which ought to be ſatisfied. JUSTICE is now to examine every man's wiſhes, and TRUTH is to record them; let us ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and obſerve the progreſs of this great tranſaction."</p>
               <p>SHE then moved forward, and TRUTH, who knew her among the moſt faithful of her followers, beckoned her to advance, till we were placed near the ſeat of JUSTICE. The firſt who required the aſſiſtance of the office, came forward with a ſlow pace, and tumour of dignity, and ſhaking a weighty purſe in his
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1098200104:42"/>
hand, demanded to be regiſtred by TRUTH, as the MECAENAS of the preſentage, the chief encourager of literary merit, to whom men of learning and wit might apply in any exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence or diſtreſs with certainty of ſuccour. JUSTICE very mildly enquired whether he had calculated the expence of ſuch a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? whether he had been informed what number of petitioners would ſwarm about him? whether he could diſtinguiſh idleneſs and negligence from calamity, oſtentation from knowledge, or vivacity from wit? To theſe queſtions he ſeemed not well provided with a reply, but repeated his deſire to be recorded a patron. JUSTICE then offered to regiſter his propoſal on theſe conditions, that he ſhould never ſuffer himſelf to be flattered; that he ſhould never delay an audience when he had nothing to do; and that he ſhould never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage followers without intending to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them. Theſe terms were too hard to be accepted; for what, ſaid he, is the end of patronage, but the pleaſure of reading de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications, holding multitudes in ſuſpenſe, and enjoying their hopes, their fears, and their anxiety, flattering them to aſſiduity, and, at laſt, diſmiſſing them for impatience? JUSTICE
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1098200104:43"/>
heard his confeſſion, and ordered his name to be poſted upon the gate among cheats, and robbers, and publick nuiſances, which all were by that notice warned to avoid.</p>
               <p>ANOTHER required to be made known as the diſcoverer of a new art of education, by which languages and ſciences might be taught to all capacities, and all inclinations, without fear of puniſhment, pain of confinement, loſs of any part of the gay mien of ignorance, or any obſtruction of the neceſſary progreſs in dreſs, dancing, or cards.</p>
               <p>JUSTICE and TRUTH did not trouble this great adept with many enquiries; but finding his addreſs aukward, and his ſpeech barbarous, ordered him to be regiſtred as a tall fellow who wanted employment, and might ſerve in any poſt where the knowledge of reading and writing was not required</p>
               <p>A MAN of a very great and philoſophic aſpect required notice to be given of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to ſet out a certain day, on a ſubma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine voyage, and of his willingneſs to take in paſſengers for no more than double the price
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1098200104:44"/>
at which they might ſail above water. His deſire was granted, and he retired to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient ſtand in expectation of filling his ſhip, and growing rich in a ſhort time by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy, ſafety, and expedition of the paſſage.</p>
               <p>ANOTHER deſired to advertiſe the curious that he had, for the advancement of true knowledge, contrived an optical inſtrument, by which thoſe who laid out their induſtry on memorials of the changes of the wind, might obſerve the direction of the weathercocks on the hither ſide of the lunar world.</p>
               <p>ANOTHER wiſhed to be known as the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of an invention, by which cities or king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms might be made warm in winter by a ſingle fire, a kettle, and pipe. Another had a vehicle by which a man might bid defiance to floods, and continue floating in an inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without any inconvenience till the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhould ſubſide. JUSTICE conſidered theſe projects as of no importance but to their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and therefore ſcarcely condeſcended to examine them; but TRUTH refuſed to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them into the regiſter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:1098200104:45"/>
TWENTY different pretenders came in one hour to give notice of an univerſal medicine, by which all diſeaſes might be cured or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, and life protracted beyond the age of NESTOR. But JUSTICE informed them, that one univerſal medicine was ſufficient, and ſhe would delay the notification of her office, till ſhe ſaw who could longeſt preſerve his own life.</p>
               <p>A THOUSAND other claims and offers were exhibited and examined. I remarked among this mighty multitude, that, of intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual advantages, many had great exube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and few confeſſed any want; of every art there were a hundred profeſſors for a ſingle pupil: but of other attainments, ſuch as riches, honours, and preſerments, I found none that had too much, but thouſands and ten thouſands that thought themſelves intitled to a larger dividend.</p>
               <p>IT often happened that old miſers, and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men married at the cloſe of life, advertiſed their want of children; nor was it uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon for thoſe who had a numerous offspring,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:1098200104:46"/>
to give notice of a ſon or daughter to be ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; but though appearances promiſed well on both ſides, the bargain ſeldom ſucceeded; for they ſoon loſt their inclination to adopted chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and proclaimed their intentions to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote ſome ſcheme of public charity; a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand propoſals were immediately made, among which they heſitated till death precluded the deciſion.</p>
               <p>AS I ſtood looking on this ſcene of confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, TRUTH condeſcended to aſk me what was my buſineſs at her office? I was ſtruck with the unexpected queſtion, and awaked by my efforts to anſwer it.</p>

               <p>IT is neceſſary to the ſucceſs of flattery, that it be accommodated to particular circumſtances or characters, and enter the heart on that ſide where the paſſions ſtand ready to receive it. A lady ſeldom liſtens with attention to any praiſe but that of her beauty; a trader always expects to hear of his influence at the bank, his importance on the exchange, the height of his credit, and the extent of his traffick; and the author will ſcarcely be pleaſed without ſome lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the neglect of learning, the conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies againſt genius, and the ſlow progreſs of merit, or ſome praiſes of the diſintereſtedneſs and magnanimity of thoſe who encounter poverty and contempt in the cauſe of knowledge, and truſt for the reward of their labours to the judgment and gratitude of poſterity.</p>
               <p>AN aſſurance of unfading laurels, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal reputation, is the ſettled reciprocation of civility between amicable writers; to raiſe

                  <hi>monuments more durable than braſs, and more conſpicuous than pyramids,</hi> has been long the common boaſt of literature; but among the innumerable architects that erect columns to themſelves, far the greateſt part, either for want of durable materials, or of art to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them, ſee their edifices periſh as they are towering to completion, and thoſe few that for a while attract the eye of mankind, are generally weak in the foundation, and ſoon ſink by the ſaps of time.</p>

                  </q> Of the innumerable authors whoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances are thus treaſured up in magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent obſcurity, moſt are undoubtedly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, becauſe they never deſerved to be remembred, and owed the honours which they once obtained, not to judgment or to genius, to labour or to art, but to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of faction, the ſtratagems of intrigue, or the ſervility of adulation.</p>
               <p>NOTHING is more common than to find men whoſe works are now totally neglected, mentioned with praiſes by their contempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as the oracles of their age, and the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators of ſcience. Curioſity is naturally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, their volumes after long enquiry are found, but ſeldom reward the labour of the ſearch. Every period of time has produced theſe bubbles of artificial fame, which are
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1098200104:50"/>
kept up a while by the breath of faſhion, and then break at once and are annihilated. The learned often bewail the loſs of ancient wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters whoſe characters have ſurvived their works; but, perhaps, if we could now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve them, we ſhould find them only the <hi>Granvilles, Montagues, Stepneys,</hi> and <hi>Sheffields</hi> of their time, and wonder by what infatua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or caprice they could riſe to notice.</p>
               <p>IT cannot, however, be denied, that many have ſunk into oblivion, whom it were unjuſt to number with this deſpicable claſs. Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous kinds of literary fame ſeem deſtined to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious meaſures of duration. Some ſpread in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to exuberance with a very ſpeedy growth, but ſoon wither and decay; ſome riſe more ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but laſt long. <hi>Parnaſſus</hi> has its flowers of tranſient fragrance, as well as its oaks of towering height, and its laurels of eternal verdure.</p>
               <p>AMONG thoſe whoſe reputation is exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a ſhort time by its own luxuriance, are the writers who take advantage of ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent incidents and characters which ſtrongly intereſt the paſſions, and engage univerſal
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:1098200104:51"/>
attention. It is not difficult to obtain rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, when we diſcuſs a queſtion which every one is deſirous to underſtand, which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated in every aſſembly, and has divided the nation into parties; or when we diſplay the faults or virtues of him, whoſe public conduct has made almoſt every man his enemy or his friend. To the quick circulation of ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions all the motives of intereſt and vanity concur; the diſputant enlarges his knowledge, the zealot animates his paſſion, and every man is deſirous to inform himſelf concerning af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs ſo vehemently agitated and variouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented.</p>
               <p>IT is ſcarcely to be imagined, through how many ſubordinations of intereſt, the ardour of party is diffuſed; and what multitudes fancy themſelves affected by every ſatire or pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrick on a man of eminence. Whoever has, at any time, taken occaſion to mention him with praiſe or blame, whoever happens to love or hate any of his adherents, is deſirous to confirm his opinion, and to ſtrengthen his party, and diligently peruſes every paper from which he can hope for ſentiments like his own. An object, however ſmall in itſelf, if placed
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:1098200104:52"/>
near to the eye, will engroſs all the rays of light; and a tranſaction, however trivial, ſwells into importance, when it preſſes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately on our attention. He that ſhall peruſe the political pamphlets of any paſt reign, will wonder why they were ſo generally pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed, ſo eagerly read, or ſo loudly praiſed; many of the performances which had power to inflame factions, and fill a kingdom with confuſion, have now very little effect upon a frigid critick, and the time is coming, when the compoſitions of later hirelings ſhall lie equally deſpiſed and forgotten. In propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as thoſe who write on temporary ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, are exalted above their merit at firſt, they are afterwards depreſſed below it; nor can the brighteſt elegance of diction, or moſt artful ſubtilty of reaſoning, hope for much eſteem from thoſe whoſe regard is no longer quickened by intereſt or by pride.</p>
               <p>IT is, indeed, the fate of controvertiſts, even when they contend for philoſophical or theological truth, to be ſoon laid aſide and ſlighted. Either the queſtion is decided; and there is no more place for doubt and oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or mankind deſpair of underſtanding it,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:1098200104:53"/>
and grow weary of diſturbance, content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with quiet ignorance, and refuſe to be haraſſed with labours which they have no hopes of recompenſing with knowledge.</p>
               <p>THE authors of new diſcoveries may ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expect to be reckoned among thoſe, whoſe writings are ſecure of veneration: yet it often happens that the general reception of a doctrine obſcures the books in which it was delivered. When any tenet is generally received and adopted as an incontrovertible principle, we ſeldom look back to the arguments upon which it was firſt eſtabliſhed, or can bear that tediouſneſs of deduction, and multiplicity of evidence, by which its author was forced to reconcile it to prejudice, and fortify it in the weakneſs of novelty againſt obſtinacy and envy.</p>
               <p>IT is well known how much of our philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy is derived from <hi>Boyle</hi>'s diſcovery of the qualities of the air; yet of thoſe who now adopt or enlarge his theory, very few have read the detail of his experiments. His name is, indeed, reverenced; but his works are neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected; we are contented to know, that he
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:1098200104:54"/>
conquered his opponents, without enquiring what cavils were produced againſt him, or by what proofs they were confuted.</p>
               <p>SOME writers apply themſelves to ſtudies boundleſs and inexhauſtible, as experiments and natural philoſophy. Theſe are always loſt in ſucceſſive compilations, as new advances are made, and former obſervations become more familiar. Others ſpend their lives in remarks on language, or explanations of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, and only afford materials for lexico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers and commentators; theſe are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves overwhelmed by ſubſequent collectors, who equally deſtroy the memory of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors by amplification, tranſpoſition, or contraction. Every new ſyſtem of nature gives birth to a ſwarm of expoſitors, whoſe buſineſs is to explain and illuſtrate it, and who can hope to exiſt no longer than the founder of their ſect preſerves his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</p>
               <p>THERE are, indeed, few kinds of compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition from which an author, however learned or ingenious, can hope a long continuance of fame. He who has carefully ſtudied human
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:1098200104:55"/>
nature, and can well deſcribe it, may with moſt reaſon flatter his ambition. <hi>Bacon,</hi> among all his pretenſions to the regard of poſterity, ſeems to have pleaſed himſelf chiefly with his eſſays, <hi>which come home to mens buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and boſoms,</hi> and of which, therefore, he declares his expectation, that they <hi>will live as long as books laſt.</hi> It may, however, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy an honeſt and benevolent mind to have been uſeful, though leſs conſpicuous; nor will he that extends his hopes to higher rewards, be ſo much anxious to obtain praiſe, as to diſcharge the duty which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence aſſigns him.</p>

               <p>AMONG the various cenſures, which the unavoidable compariſon of my performances with thoſe of my predeceſſors has produced, there is none more general than that of uniformity. Many of my readers remark the want of thoſe changes of colours, which formerly fed the attention with unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted novelty, and of that intermixture of ſubjects, or alternation of manner, by which other writers relieved wearineſs, and awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed expectation.</p>
               <p>I HAVE, indeed, hitherto avoided the practice of uniting gay and ſolemn ſubjects in the ſame paper, becauſe it ſeems abſurd for an author to counteract himſelf, to preſs at once with equal force upon both parts of the intellectual balance, and give medicines, which, like the double poiſon of <hi>Dryden,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the force of one another.

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:1098200104:57"/>
to elevate; but have imagined it an uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs attempt to diſturb merriment by ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or interrupt ſeriouſneſs by drollery.

                                 <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
                              </opener>
                              <p>THOUGH, as my mamma tells me, I am too young to talk at the table, I have great pleaſure in liſtening to the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of learned men, eſpecially when they diſcourſe of things which I do not underſtand; and have, therefore, been of late particularly delighted with many diſputes about the <hi>alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the ſtile,</hi> which, they ſay, is to be made by act of parliament.</p>
                              <p>ONE day, when my mamma was gone out of the room, I aſked a very great ſcholar what the ſtile was. He told me, he was afraid I ſhould hardly underſtand him when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me, that it was the ſtated and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed method of computing time. It was not,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:1098200104:58"/>
indeed, likely that I ſhould underſtand him; for I never yet knew time computed in my life, nor can imagine why we ſhould be at ſo much trouble to count what we cannot keep. He did not tell me whether we are to count the time paſt, or the time to come; but I have conſidered them both by myſelf, and think it as fooliſh to count time that is gone, as money that is ſpent; and as for the time which is to come, it only ſeems farther off by counting; and therefore when any pleaſure is promiſed me, I always think of the time as little as I can.</p>
                              <p>I HAVE ſince liſtened very attentively to every one that talked upon this ſubject, of whom the greater part ſeem not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it better than myſelf; for though they often hint how much the nation has been miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, and rejoice that we are at laſt grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wiſer than our anceſtors, I have never been able to diſcover from them, that any body has died ſooner or been married later for counting time wrong; and, therefore, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to fancy, that there was great buſtle with little conſequence.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="58" facs="tcp:1098200104:59"/>
AT laſt two friends of my papa, Mr. <hi>Cycle</hi> and Mr. <hi>Starlight,</hi> being, it ſeems, both of high learning, and able to make an almanack, began to talk about the new ſtile. Sweet Mr. <hi>Starlight</hi>—I am ſure I ſhall love his name as long as I live; for he told <hi>Cycle</hi> roundly, with a fierce look, that we ſhould never be right without a <hi>year of confuſion.</hi> Dear Mr. RAM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BLER, did you ever hear any thing ſo charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? a whole year of confuſion! When there has been a rout at mamma's, I have thought one night of confuſion worth a thouſand nights of reſt; and ſurely if I can but ſee a year of confuſion, a whole year, of cards in one room, and dancings in another, here a feaſt, and there a maſquerade, and plays, and coaches, and hurries, and meſſages, and milan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and raps at the door, and viſits, and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, and new faſhions, I ſhall not care what they do with the reſt of the time, nor whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they count it by the old ſtile or the new; for I am reſolved to break looſe from the nurſery in the tumult, and play my part among the reſt; and it will be ſtrange if I cannot get a huſband and a chariot in the year of confuſion.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="59" facs="tcp:1098200104:60"/>
CYCLE, who is neither ſo young nor ſo handſome as <hi>Starlight,</hi> very gravely main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that all the perplexity may be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by leaping over eleven days in the reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and indeed, if it ſhould come only to this, I think the new ſtile is a delightful thing; for my mamma ſays I ſhall go to court when I am ſixteen, and if they can but contrive of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to leap over eleven days together, the months of reſtraint will ſoon be at an end. It is ſtrange, that with all the plots that have been laid againſt time, they could never kill it by act of parliament before. Dear Sir, if you have any vote or intereſt, get them but for once to deſtroy eleven months, and then I ſhall be as old as ſome married ladies. But this is deſired only if you think they will not comply with Mr. <hi>Starlight</hi>'s ſcheme; for nothing ſurely could pleaſe me like a year of confuſion, when I ſhall no longer be fixed this hour to my pen and the next to my needle, or wait at home for the dancing-maſter one day, and the next for the muſick-maſter, but run from ball to ball, and from drum to drum; and ſpend all my time without taſks, and without account, and go out without

                                 <salute>Mr. RAMBLER,</salute>
                              </opener>
                              <p>I WAS ſeized this morning with an unuſual penſiveneſs, and finding that books only ſerved to heighten it, took a ramble into the fields, in hopes of relief and invigoration from the keenneſs of the air, and brightneſs of the ſun.</p>
                              <p>AS I wandered wrapped up in thought, my eyes were ſtruck with the hoſpital for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of deſerted infants, which I ſurveyed with pleaſure, till by a natural train of ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I began to reflect on the fate of the mothers. For to what ſhelter can they fly? Only to the arms of their betrayer, which perhaps are now no longer open to receive them; and then how quick muſt be the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition from deluded virtue to ſhameleſs guilt,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:1098200104:62"/>
and from ſhameleſs guilt to hopeleſs wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs?</p>
                              <p>THE anguiſh that I felt, left me no reſt till had, by your means, addreſſed myſelf to the publick on behalf of thoſe forlorn creatures, the women of the town; whoſe miſery here, might ſatisfy the moſt rigorous cenſor, and whoſe participation of our common nature might purely induce us to endeavour, at leaſt, their preſervation from eternal puniſhment.</p>
                              <p>THESE were all once, if not virtuous, at leaſt innocent; and might ſtill have continued blameleſs and eaſy, but for the arts and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations of thoſe whoſe rank, fortune, or education, furniſhed them with means to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt or to delude them. Let the libertine reflect a moment on the ſituation of that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who being forſaken by her betrayer, is reduced to the neceſſity of turning proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute for bread, and judge of the enormity of his guilt by the evils which it produces.</p>
                              <p>IT cannot be doubted but that numbers follow this dreadful courſe of life, with ſhame, horror, and regret; but, where can they hope
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:1098200104:63"/>
for refuge? "<hi>The world is not their friend, nor the world's law.</hi>" Their ſighs, and tears, and groans, are criminal in the eye of their tyrants, the bully and the bawd, who fatten on their miſery, and threaten them with want or a gaol, if they ſhew the leaſt deſign of eſcaping from their bondage.</p>
                              <p>"TO wipe all tears from off all faces," is a taſk too hard for mortals; but to alleviate misfortunes is often within the moſt limited power: yet the opportunities which every day affords of relieving the moſt wretched of human beings are overlooked and neglected, with equal diſregard of policy and goodneſs.</p>
                              <p>THERE are places, indeed, ſet apart, to which theſe unhappy creatures may reſort, when the diſeaſes of incontinence ſeize upon them; but, if they obtain a cure, to what are they reduced? Either to return with the ſmall remains of beauty to their former guilt, or periſh in the ſtreets with nakedneſs and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                              <p>HOW frequently have the gay and thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, in their evening frolicks, ſeen a band of theſe miſerable females, covered with rags,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:1098200104:64"/>
ſhivering with cold, and pining with hunger; and, without either pitying their calamities, or reflecting upon the cruelty of thoſe who perhaps firſt ſeduced them by careſſes of fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or magnificence of promiſes, go on to reduce others to the ſame wretchedneſs by the ſame means?</p>
                              <p>TO ſtop the increaſe of this deplorable mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, is undoubtedly the firſt and moſt preſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſideration. To prevent evil is the great end of government, the end for which vigilance and ſeverity are properly employed. But ſurely thoſe whom paſſion or intereſt have already depraved, have ſome claim to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, from beings equally frail and fallible with themſelves. Nor will they long groan in their preſent afflictions, if none were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe them relief, but who owe their exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the ſame diſtreſs only to their wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and their virtue.</p>

               <p>AN ancient poet, unreaſonably diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the preſent ſtate of things, which his ſyſtem of opinions obliged him to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in its worſt form, has obſerved of the earth, "that its greater part is covered by the uninhabitable ocean; that of the reſt ſome is encumbered with naked mountains, and ſome loſt under barren ſands; ſome ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with unintermitted heat, and ſome pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified with perpetual froſt; ſo that only a few regions remain for the production of fruits, the paſture of cattle, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation of man."</p>
               <p>THE ſame obſervation may be transferred to the time allotted us in our preſent ſtate. When we have deducted all that is abſorbed in ſleep, all that is inevitably appropriated to the demands of nature, or irreſiſtibly engroſſed
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:1098200104:66"/>
by the tyranny of cuſtom; all that paſſes in regulating the ſuperficial decorations of life, or is given up in the reciprocations of civility to the diſpoſal of others; all that is torn from us by violence of diſeaſe, or ſtolen impercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibly away by laſſitude and languor; we ſhall find that part of our duration very ſmall of which we can truly call ourſelves maſters, or which we can ſpend wholly at our own choice. Many of our hours are loſt in a rotation of petty cares, in a conſtant recurrence of the ſame employments; many of our proviſions for eaſe or happineſs are always exhauſted by the preſent day; and a great part of our exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence ſerves no other purpoſe, than that of enabling us to enjoy the reſt.</p>
               <p>OF the few moments which are left in our diſpoſal, it may reaſonably be expected, that we ſhould be ſo frugal, as to let none of them ſlip from us without ſome equivalent; and perhaps it might be found, that as the earth, however ſtreightened by rocks or waters, is capable of producing more than all its inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants are able to conſume, our lives, though much contracted by incidental diſtraction, and inevitable avocations, would yet afford us a
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1098200104:67"/>
large ſpace vacant to the exerciſe of our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and our virtue; that we want not time, but diligence, for great performances; and that we ſquander much of our allowance, even think it ſparing and inſufficient.</p>
               <p>THIS natural and neceſſary comminution of our lives, perhaps, often makes us inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the negligence with which we ſuffer them to ſlide away; we never conſider our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as poſſeſſed at once of time ſufficient for any great deſign, and therefore indulge ourſelves in fortuitous amuſements. We think it unneceſſary to take an account of a few ſupernumerary moments, which, however employed, could have produced little advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and which were expoſed to a thouſand chances of diſturbance and interruption.</p>
               <p>IT is obſervable, that either by nature or by habit, our underſtandings are fitted to images of a certain extent, to which we adjuſt great things by diviſion, and little things by accumulation. Of extenſive ſurfaces we can only take a ſurvey, as the parts ſucceed one another; and atoms we cannot perceive, till they are united into maſſes. Thus we break
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:1098200104:68"/>
the vaſt periods of time into centuries and years; and thus, if we would know the amount of moments, we muſt agglomerate them into days and weeks.</p>
               <p>THE proverbial oracles of our parſimonious anceſtors have informed us, that the fatal waſte of fortune is by ſmall expences, by the profu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſums too little ſingly to alarm our caution, and which we never ſuffer ourſelves to conſider together. Of the ſame kind is the prodigality of life; he that hopes to look back hereafter with ſatisfaction upon paſt years, muſt learn to know the preſent value of ſingle minutes, and endeavour to let no particle of time fall uſeleſs to the ground.</p>
               <p>IT is uſual for thoſe who are adviſed to the perſuit of any ſtudy, or the attainment of any new qualification, to look upon themſelves as required to change the general courſe of their conduct, to diſmiſs buſineſs, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude pleaſure, and to devote their days and nights to a particular attention. But all common degrees of excellence are attainable at a lower price; he that ſhould ſteadily and reſolutely aſſign to any ſcience or language
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:1098200104:69"/>
thoſe interſtitial vacancies which intervene in the moſt crouded variety of diverſion or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, would find every day new irradia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of knowledge, and diſcover how much more is to be hoped from frequency and perſeverance than from violent efforts, and ſudden deſires; efforts which are ſoon remitted when they encounter difficulty, and deſires which, if they are indulged too often will ſhake off the authority of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and range capriciouſly from one object to another.</p>
               <p>THE diſpoſition to defer every important deſign to a time of leiſure, and a ſtate of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled uniformity, proceeds generally from a falſe eſtimate of the human powers. If we except thoſe gigantick and ſtupendous intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences who are ſaid to graſp a ſyſtem by intui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and bound forward from one ſeries of concluſions to another, without regular ſteps through intermediate propoſitions, the moſt ſucceſsful ſtudents make their advances in knowledge by ſhort flights, between each of which the mind may lie at reſt. For every ſingle act of progreſſion a ſhort time is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:1098200104:70"/>
and it is only neceſſary, that whenever that time is afforded, it be well employed.</p>
               <p>FEW minds will be long confined to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere and laborious meditation; and when a ſucceſsful attack on knowledge has been made, the ſtudent recreates himſelf with the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of his conqueſt, and forbears another incurſion, till the new-acquired truth has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come familiar, and his curioſity calls upon him for freſh gratifications. Whether the time of intermiſſion is ſpent in company, or in ſolitude, in neceſſary buſineſs, or in volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary levities, the underſtanding is equally abſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from the object of enquiry; but, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, if it be detained by occupations leſs pleaſing, it returns again to ſtudy with greater alacrity, than when it is glutted with ideal pleaſures, and ſurfeited with intemperance of application. He that will not ſuffer himſelf to be diſcouraged by fancied impoſſibilities, may ſometimes find his abilities invigorated by the neceſſity of exerting them in ſhort inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, as the force of a current is encreaſed by the contraction of its chanel.</p>
               <p>FROM ſome cauſe like this, it has probably

A great part of the life of <hi>Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> was one continual peregrination; ill ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with the gifts of fortune, and led from city to city, and from kingdom to kingdom, by the hopes of patrons and preferment, hopes which always flattered and always deceived him; he yet found means by unſhaken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, and a vigilant improvement of thoſe hours, which, in the midſt of the moſt reſtleſs activity, will remain unengaged, to write more than another in the ſame condition would have hoped to read. Compelled by want to attendance and ſolicitation, and ſo much verſed in common life, that he has tranſmitted to us the moſt perfect delineation of the manners of his age, he joined to his knowledge of the world, ſuch application to books, that he will ſtand for ever in the firſt rank of literary heroes.

                        <salute>SIR,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>THOUGH you ſeem to have taken a view ſufficiently extenſive of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of life, and have employed much of your ſpeculation on mournful ſubjects, you have not yet exhauſted the whole ſtock of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man infelicity. There is ſtill a ſpecies of wretchedneſs which eſcapes your obſervation, though it might ſupply you with many ſage remarks, and ſalutary cautions.</p>
                     <p>I CANNOT but imagine the ſtart of atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion awakened by this welcome hint; and at this inſtant ſee the rambler ſnuffing his candle, rubbing his ſpectacles, ſtirring his fire, lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

out interruption, and ſettling himſelf in his eaſy chair, that he may enjoy a new ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity without diſturbance. For, whether it be, that continued ſickneſs or misfortune has acquainted you only with the bitterneſs of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; or that you imagine none but yourſelf able to diſcover what I ſuppoſe has been ſeen and felt by all the inhabitants of the world: whether you intend your writings as antidotal to the levity and merriment with which your rivals endeavour to attract the favour of the publick; or fancy that you have ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular powers of dolorous declamation, and <hi>warble out your groans</hi> with uncommon ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance or energy; it is certain, that, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be your ſubject, melancholy for the moſt part burſts in upon your ſpeculation, your gaiety is quickly overcaſt, and though your readers may be flattered with hopes of pleaſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, they are ſeldom diſmiſſed but with heavy hearts.</p>
                     <p>THAT I may therefore gratify you with an imitation of your own ſyllables of ſadneſs, I will inform you that I was condemned by ſome diſaſtrous influence to be an only ſon, born to the apparent proſpect of a large for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:1098200104:75"/>
and allotted to my parents at that time of life when ſatiety of common diverſions al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the mind to indulge parental affection with greater intenſeneſs. My birth was cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated by the tenants with feaſts, and dances, and bagpipes; congratulations were ſent from every family within ten miles round; and my parents diſcovered in my firſt cries ſuch tokens of future virtue and underſtanding, that they declared themſelves determined to devote the remaining part of life to my happineſs, and the encreaſe of their eſtate.</p>
                     <p>THE abilities of my father and mother were not perceptibly unequal, and educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had given neither much advantage over the other. They had both kept good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, rattled in chariots, glittered in play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, and danced at court, and were both expert in the games that were in their time ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, called in as auxiliaries againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſion of thought.</p>
                     <p>WHEN there is ſuch a parity between two perſons aſſociated for life, the dejection which the huſband, if he be not completely ſtupid, muſt always ſuffer for want of ſuperiority,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:1098200104:76"/>
ſinks him to ſubmiſſiveneſs. My mamma, therefore, governed the family without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul; and except that my father ſtill retained ſome authority in the ſtables, and now and then, after a ſupernumerary bottle, broke a looking-glaſs or china diſh to prove his ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, the whole courſe of the year was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by her direction, the ſervants received from her all their orders, and the tenants were continued or diſmiſſed at her diſcretion.</p>
                     <p>SHE therefore thought herſelf entitled to the ſuperintendence of her ſon's education; and when my father, at the inſtigation of the parſon, faintly propoſed that I ſhould be ſent to ſchool, very poſitively told him, that ſhe would not ſuffer ſo fine a child to be ruined; that ſhe never knew any boys at a grammar-ſchool that could come into a room without bluſhing, or ſit at the table without ſome auk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward uneaſineſs; that they were always put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelves into danger by boiſterous plays, or vitiating their behaviour with mean company; and that, for her part, ſhe would rather follow me to the grave than ſee me tear my cloaths, and hang down my head, and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:1098200104:77"/>
ſneak about with dirty ſhoes and blotted fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, hair unpowdered, and a hat uncocked.</p>
                     <p>MY father, who had no other end in his propoſal than to appear wiſe and manly, ſoon acquieſced, ſince I was not to live by my learning; for, indeed, he had known very few ſtudents that had not ſome ſtiffneſs in their manner. They therefore agreed, that a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick tutor ſhould be procured, and hired an honeſt gentleman of mean converſation and narrow ſentiments, but whom, having paſſed the common forms of literary education, they implicitly concluded qualified to teach all that was to be learned from a ſcholar. He thought himſelf ſufficiently exalted by being placed at the ſame table with his pupil, and had no other view than to perpetuate his felicity by unlimited reverence, and the utmoſt flexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of ſubmiſſion to all my mother's opinions and caprices. He therefore frequently took away my book, leſt I ſhould mope with too much application, charged me never to write without turning up my ruffles, and generally bruſhed my coat before he diſmiſſed me into the parlour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="77" facs="tcp:1098200104:78"/>
                        <hi>HE</hi> had, indeed, no occaſion to complain of too burdenſome an employment; for my mother very judiciouſly conſidered, that I was not likely to grow politer in his company, and therefore ſuffered me not to paſs any more time in his apartment than my leſſon required. When I was ſummoned to my taſk, ſhe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally enjoined me not to get any of my tutor's ways, who was ſeldom mentioned before me but for practices to be avoided. I was every moment admoniſhed not to lean on my chair, croſs my legs, or ſwing my hands like my tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; and once my mother very ſeriouſly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berated upon his total diſmiſſion, becauſe I began, ſhe faid, to learn his manner of ſticking on my hat, and had his bend in my ſhoulders, and his totter in my gait.</p>
                     <p>SUCH, however, was her care, that I eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped all theſe depravities; and when I was only twelve years old, had rid myſelf of every ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of childiſh diffidence. I was cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated round the country for the petulance of my remarks, and the quickneſs of my replies; and many a ſcholar five years older than myſelf have I daſhed into confuſion by the ſteadineſs
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:1098200104:79"/>
of my countenance, ſilenced by my readineſs of repartee, and tortured with envy by the addreſs with which I picked up a fan, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented a ſnuff-box, or received an empty tea-cup.</p>
                     <p>AT thirteen I was ſo completely ſkilled in all the niceties of dreſs, that I could not only enumerate all the variety of ſilks, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the product of a <hi>French</hi> loom, but dart my eye through a numerous company, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve every deviation from the reigning mode. I was univerſally ſkilful in all the changes of expenſive finery; but, as they ſay, every one has ſomething to which he is particularly born, was eminently knowing in <hi>Bruſſels</hi> lace.</p>
                     <p>THE next year ſaw me advanced to the truſt and power of adjuſting the ceremonial of an aſſembly. Every one received his partner from my hand, and to me every ſtranger ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied for introduction. My heart now diſdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the inſtructions of a tutor, who was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with a ſmall annuity for life, and left me qualified, in my own opinion, to govern myſelf.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="79" facs="tcp:1098200104:80"/>
IN a ſhort time I came to <hi>London,</hi> and as my father was well known among the higher claſſes of life, ſoon obtained admiſſion to the moſt ſplendid aſſemblies, and moſt crouded card-tables. Here I found myſelf univerſally careſſed and applauded: the ladies praiſed the fancy of my cloaths, the beauty of my form, and the ſoftneſs of my voice; endeavoured in every place to force themſelves upon my no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; and invited by a thouſand oblique ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations my attendance to the play-houſe, and my ſalutations in the park. I was now happy to the utmoſt extent of my conception; I paſſed every morning in dreſs, every afternoon in viſits, and every night in ſome ſelect aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, where neither care nor knowledge were ſuffered to moleſt us.</p>
                     <p>AFTER a few years, however, theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights became familiar, and I had leiſure to look round me with more attention. I then found that my flatterers had very little power to relieve the languor of ſatiety, or recreate wearineſs, by varied amuſement; and therefore endeavoured to enlarge the ſphere of my plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and to try what ſatisfaction might be
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:1098200104:81"/>
found in the ſociety of men. I will not deny the mortification with which I perceived, that every man, whoſe name I had heard mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with reſpect, received me with a kind of tenderneſs nearly bordering on compaſſion; and that thoſe whoſe reputation was not well eſtabliſhed, thought it neceſſary to juſtify their underſtandings, by treating me with contempt. One of theſe witlings elevated his creſt, by aſking me in a full coffee-houſe the price of patches; and another whiſpered, that he won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered why miſs <hi>Friſk</hi> did not keep me that afternoon to watch her ſquirrel.</p>
                     <p>WHEN I found myſelf thus hunted from all maſculine converſation by thoſe who were themſelves barely admitted, I returned to the ladies, and reſolved to dedicate my life to their ſervice and their pleaſure. But I find that I have now loſt my charms. Of thoſe with whom I entered the gay world, ſome are married, ſome have retired, and ſome have ſo much changed their opinion, that they ſcarcely pay any regard to my civilities, if there is any other man in the place. The new flight of beauties to whom I have made addreſſes, ſuffer me to pay the treat, and then titter with
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:1098200104:82"/>
boys. So that I now find myſelf welcome only to a few grave ladies, who, unacquainted with all that gives either uſe or dignity to life, are content to paſs their hours between their bed and their cards, without eſteem from the old, or reverence from the young.</p>
                     <p>I CANNOT but think, Mr. RAMBLER, that I have reaſon to complain; for ſurely the females ought to pay ſome regard to the age of him whoſe youth was paſſed in endeavours to pleaſe them. They that encourage folly in the boy have no right to puniſh it in the man. Yet I find, that though they laviſh their firſt fondneſs upon pertneſs and gaiety, they ſoon transfer their regard to other qualities, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefully abandon their adorers to dream out their laſt years in ſtupidity and contempt.</p>

               <p>THAT to pleaſe the Lord and Father of the univerſe, is the ſupreme intereſt of created and dependent beings, as it is eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved, has been univerſally confeſſed; and ſince all rational agents are conſcious of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neglected or violated thoſe duties which are preſcribed to them, the fear of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, rejected, or puniſhed by God, has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways burdened and oppreſſed the human mind. The expiation of crimes, and renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the forfeited hopes of divine favour, has therefore conſtituted a large part of every religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:1098200104:84"/>
THE various methods of propitiation and atonement which fear and folly have dictated, or artifice and intereſt tolerated in the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent parts of the world, however they may ſometimes reproach or degrade humanity, at leaſt ſhew the general conſent of all ages and nations in their opinion of the mercy and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cability of the divine nature. That God will forgive, may, indeed, be eſtabliſhed as the firſt and fundamental truth of religion; for though the knowledge of his exiſtence is the origin of philoſophy, yet, without the belief of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, it would have very little influence upon our moral conduct. There could be no proſpect of enjoying the protection or regard of him, whom the leaſt deviation from recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude made inexorable for ever; and every man would naturally withdraw his thoughts from the contemplation of a Creator, whom he muſt conſider as a governor too pure to be pleaſed, and too ſevere to be pacified; as an enemy infinitely wiſe, and infinitely powerful, whom he could neither deceive, eſcape, nor reſiſt.</p>
               <p>WHERE there is no hope, there can be no
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:1098200104:85"/>
endeavour. A conſtant and unfailing obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is above the reach of terreſtrial diligence; and therefore the progreſs of life could only have been the natural deſcent of negligent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair from crime to crime, had not the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal perſuaſion of forgiveneſs to be obtained by proper means of reconciliation recalled thoſe to the paths of virtue whom their paſſions had ſolicited aſide; and animated to new attempts, and firmer perſeverance, thoſe whom difficulty had diſcouraged, or negligence ſurpriſed.</p>
               <p>IN ages and regions ſo disjoined from each other, that there can ſcarcely be imagined any communication of ſentiments either by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce or tradition, has prevailed a general and uniform expectation of propitiating God by corporal auſterities, of anticipating his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance by voluntary inflictions, and appeaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his juſtice by a ſpeedy and chearful ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to a leſs penalty when a greater is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred.</p>
               <p>INCORPORATED minds will always feel ſome inclination towards exterior acts, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual obſervances. Ideas not repreſented by ſenſible objects are fleeting, variable, and eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſcent.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:1098200104:86"/>
We are not able to judge of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of conviction which operated at any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular time upon our own thoughts, but as it is recorded by ſome certain and definite effect. He that reviews his life in order to determine the probability of his acceptance with God, if he could once eſtabliſh the neceſſary propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between crimes and ſufferings, might ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely reſt upon his performance of the expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but while ſafety remains the reward only of mental purity, he is always afraid leſt he ſhould decide too ſoon in his own favour; leſt he ſhould not have felt the pangs of true contrition; leſt he ſhould miſtake ſatiety for abhorrence, or imagine that his paſſions are ſubdued when they are only ſleeping.</p>
               <p>FROM this natural and reaſonable diffidence aroſe, in humble and timorous piety, a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to confound penance with repentance, to repoſe on human determinations, and to receive from ſome judicial ſentence the ſtated and regular aſſignment of reconciliatory pain. We are never willing to be without reſource; we ſeek in the knowledge of others a ſuccour for our own ignorance, and are ready to truſt
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:1098200104:87"/>
any that will undertake to direct us when we have no confidence in ourſelves.</p>
               <p>THIS deſire to aſcertain by ſome outward marks the ſtate of the ſoul, and this willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to calm the conſcience by ſome ſettled method, have produced, as they are diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in their effects by various tempers and principles, moſt of the diſquiſitions and rules, the doubts and ſolutions, that have embarraſſed the doctrine of repentance, and perplexed ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and flexible minds with innumerable ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples concerning the neceſſary meaſures of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and adequate degrees of ſelf-abhorrence; and theſe rules corrupted by fraud, or debaſed by credulity, have, by the common reſiliency of the mind from one extreme to another, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited others to an open contempt of all ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diary ordinances, all prudential caution, and the whole diſcipline of regulated piety.</p>
               <p>REPENTANCE, however difficult to be practiſed, is, if it be explained without ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, eaſily underſtood. <hi>Repentance is the relinquiſhment of any practice from the conviction that it has offended God.</hi> Sorrow, and fear, and anxiety, are properly not parts, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncts
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:1098200104:88"/>
of repentance; yet they are ſo cloſely connected with it, that they cannot eaſily be ſeparated; for they not only mark its ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity but promote its efficacy.</p>
               <p>NO man commits any act of negligence or obſtinacy, by which his preſent ſafety or hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs is endangered, without feeling the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of remorſe. He who is fully convinced, that he ſuffers by his own failure, can never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to trace back his miſcarriage to its firſt cauſe, to image to himſelf a contrary beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and to form involuntary reſolutions againſt the like fault, even when he knows that he ſhall never again have the power of committing it. No man finds himſelf in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger without ſuch trepidations of impatience as leave all human means of ſafety behind them: he that has once caught an alarm of terror, is every moment ſeized with uſeleſs anxieties, always adding one ſecurity to another, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling with ſudden doubts, and diſtracted by the perpetual occurrence of new expedients. If, therefore, he whoſe crimes have deprived him of the favour of God, can reflect upon his conduct without diſturbance, or can at will baniſh the reflection; if he who conſiders
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:1098200104:89"/>
himſelf as ſuſpended over the abyſs of eternal perdition only by the thread of life, which muſt ſoon part by its own weakneſs, and which the wing of every minute may divide, can caſt his eyes round him without ſhuddering with horror, or panting for ſecurity; what can he judge of himſelf but that he is not yet awaked to ſufficient conviction, ſince every loſs is more lamented than the loſs of the divine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and every danger more dreaded than the danger of final condemnation?</p>
               <p>RETIREMENT from the cares and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the world has been often recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended as uſeful to repentance. This at leaſt is evident, that every one retires, whenever ratiocination and recollection are required on other occaſions: and ſurely the retroſpect of life, the diſentanglement of actions compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated with innumerable circumſtances, and diffuſed in various relations, the diſcovery of the primary movements of the heart, and the extirpation of luſts and appetites deeply rooted, and widely ſpread, may be allowed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ſome ſeceſſion from ſport and noiſe, and buſineſs and folly. Some ſuſpenſion of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon affairs, ſome pauſe of temporal pain and

pleaſure, is doubtleſs neceſſary to him that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberates for eternity, who is forming the only plan in which miſcarriage cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, and examining the only queſtion in which miſtake cannot be rectified.</p>
               <p>AUSTERITIES and mortifications are means by which the mind is invigorated and rouſed, by which the attractions of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure are interrupted, and the chains of ſenſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity are broken. It is obſerved by one of the fathers, that <hi>he who reſtrains himſelf in the uſe of things lawful, will never encroach upon things forbidden.</hi> Abſtinence, if nothing more, is, at leaſt, a cautious retreat from the utmoſt verge of permiſſion, and confers that ſecurity which cannot be reaſonably hoped by him that dares always to hover over the precipice of deſtruction, or delights to approach the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which he knows it fatal to partake. Auſterity is the proper antidote to indulgence; the diſeaſes of mind as well as body are cured by contraries, and to contraries we ſhould readily have recourſe, if we dreaded guilt as we dread pain.</p>
               <p>THE completion and ſum of repentance is
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:1098200104:91"/>
a change of life. That ſorrow which dictates no caution, that fear which does not quicken our eſcape, that auſterity which fails to rectily our affections, are vain and unavailing. But ſorrow and terror muſt naturally precede reformation; for what other cauſe can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it? He, therefore, that feels himſelf al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed by his conſcience, anxious for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of a better ſtate, and afflicted by the memory of his paſt faults, may juſtly conclude, that the great work of repentance is begun, and hope by retirement and prayer, the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and religious means of ſtrengthening his conviction, to impreſs upon his mind ſuch a ſenſe of the divine preſence, as may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power the blandiſhments of ſecular delights, and enable him to advance from one degree of holineſs to another, till death ſhall ſet him free from miſery and temptation. <q>

               <p>IT has been obſerved, by long experience, that late ſprings produce the greateſt plenty. The delay of blooms and fragrance, of verdure and breezes, is for the moſt part liberally recompenſed by the exuberance and fecundity of the enſuing ſeaſons; the bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms which lie concealed till the year is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, and the ſun is high, eſcape thoſe chilling blaſts, and nocturnal froſts, which are often fatal to early luxuriance, prey upon the firſt ſmiles of vernal beauty, deſtroy the feeble principles of vegetable life, intercept the fruit in the gem, and beat down the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers unopened to the ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:1098200104:93"/>
I AM afraid there is little hope of perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the young and ſprightly part of my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, upon whom the ſpring naturally forces my attention, to learn from the great proceſs of nature, the difference between diligence and hurry, between ſpeed and precipitation; to proſecute their deſigns with calmneſs, to watch the concurrence of opportunity, and endeavour to find the lucky moment which they cannot make. Youth is the time of enterprize and hope; having yet had no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of comparing our force with any oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing power, we naturally form preſumptions in our own favour, and imagine that obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and impediment will give way before us. The firſt repulſes rather inflame vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence than teach prudence; a brave and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous mind is long before it ſuſpects its own weakneſs, or ſubmits to ſap the difficulties which it purpoſed to ſubdue by ſtorm, and expected to overbear in the violence of its courſe. Before diſappointments have enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the dictates of philoſophy, we believe it in our power to ſhorten the interval between the firſt cauſe and the laſt effect; we laugh at the timorous delays of plodding induſtry, and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:1098200104:94"/>
fancy that by encreaſing the fire, we can at pleaſure accelerate the projection.</p>
               <p>AT our entrance into the world, when health and vigour give us fair promiſes of time ſufficient for the regular maturation of all our ſchemes, and a long enjoyment of all our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions, we are eager to ſeize the preſent moment, to pluck every gratification within our reach without ſuffering it to ripen into perfection, and to croud all the varieties of delight into a narrow compaſs: but age ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom fails to change our conduct; we grow commonly negligent of time in proportion as we have leſs remaining, and ſuffer the laſt part of life to ſteal from us in languid prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations for ſome future undertaking, or in ſlow approaches to ſome remote advantage, in weak hopes of ſome fortuitous occurrence, or in drowſy equilibrations of undetermined counſel. Whether it be that the aged, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taſted the pleaſures of man's condition, and found them falſe and deluſive, become leſs anxious for their attainment; or that frequent miſcarriages have depreſſed them to deſpair, and frozen them to inactivity; or that, like all other objects of terror, death ſhocks them
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:1098200104:95"/>
more as it advances upon them, and they are afraid of reminding themſelves of their decay, or to diſcover to their own hearts, that the time of trifling is paſt.</p>
               <p>A PERPETUAL conflict with our natural deſires ſeems to be the lot of our preſent ſtate. In youth we require ſomething of the tardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and frigidity of age; and in age, we muſt labour to recal the fire and impetuoſity of youth; in youth we muſt learn to expect, and in age to enjoy.</p>
               <p>THE torment of expectation is, indeed, not eaſily to be born at a time when every idea of gratification fires the blood, and flaſhes on the fancy; when the heart is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant to every freſh form of delight, and has no rival engagements to withdraw it from the importunities of a new deſire. Yet ſince the fear of miſſing what we ſeek muſt always be proportionable to the advantage that we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from poſſeſſing it, the paſſions, even in this tempeſtuous ſtate, might be ſomewhat moderated and reſtrained by frequent inculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the miſchief of temerity, and the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:1098200104:96"/>
of loſing that which we endeavour to ſeize before our time.</p>
               <p>HE that too early aſpires to honours, muſt reſolve to encounter not only the oppoſition of intereſt, but the malignity of envy. He that is too eager to be rich, generally endangers his fortune in wild adventures, and uncertain projects; and he that haſtens too ſpeedily to reputation, often endeavours to ſupport his character by artifices and fallacies, decks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in colours which quickly fade, or in plumes which accident may ſhake off, or competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion pluck away.</p>
               <p>THE uncertainty and danger of early emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence has been extended by ſome, even to the gifts of nature; and an opinion has been long conceived, that quickneſs of invention, accuracy of judgment, or extent of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, appearing in an uncommon degree be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the uſual time, preſage a ſhort life. Even thoſe who are leſs inclined to form general concluſions, from inſtances which by their own nature muſt be rare, have yet been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to prognoſticate no ſuitable progreſs from the firſt ſallies of rapid wits; but have
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:1098200104:97"/>
obſerved, that after a ſhort effort they either loiter or faint, and ſuffer themſelves to be ſurpaſſed by the equal and regular perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ſlower underſtandings.</p>
               <p>IT, indeed, frequently happens, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe abates diligence. He that finds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to have performed more than was demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is contented to ſpare the labour of unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary performances, and ſits down to enjoy at eaſe his ſuperſluities of honour. He whom ſucceſs has made confident of his abilities, eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allows himſelf the privilege of negligence, and looks contemptuouſly on the gradual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances of a rival, whom he imagines himſelf able to leave behind him whenever he ſhall again ſummon his force to the conteſt. But long intervals of pleaſure diſſipate attention, and weaken conſtancy; nor is it eaſy for him that has ſunk from diligence into ſloth to rouſe out of his lethargy, to recollect his notions, rekindle his curioſity, and engage with his former ardour in the toils of ſtudy.</p>
               <p>EVEN that friendſhip which intends the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of genius, too often tends to obſtruct it. The pleaſure of being careſſed, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:1098200104:98"/>
and admired, eaſily ſeduces the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from literary ſolitude. He is ready to follow the call which ſummons him tohear his own praiſe, and which, perhaps, at once flatters appetites with certainty of pleaſures, and his ambition with hopes of patronage; pleaſures which he conceives inexhauſtible, and hopes which he has not yet learned to diſtruſt.</p>
               <p>THESE evils, indeed, are by no means to be imputed to nature, or to be conſidered as inſeparable from an early diſplay of uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon abilities. They may be certainly eſcaped by prudence and reſolution, and muſt therefore be recounted rather as conſolations to thoſe who are leſs liberally endowed, than as diſcouragements to ſuch as are born with uncommon qualities. Beauty is well known to draw after it the perſecutions of imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, to incite the artifices of envy, and to raiſe the flames of unlawful love; yet among the ladies whom prudence or modeſty have made moſt eminent, who has ever complained of the inconveniencies or the dangers of an amiable form? or who would have purchaſed ſafety by the loſs of beauty?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:1098200104:99"/>
NEITHER grace of perſon, nor vigour of underſtanding, are to be regarded otherwiſe than as bleſſings, as means of happineſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged by the Supreme Benefactor; but the advantages of either may be loſt by too much eagerneſs to obtain them. A thouſand beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in their firſt bloſſom, by an imprudent expoſure to the open world, have ſuddenly withered at the blaſt of infamy; and men who might have ſubjected new regions to the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of learning have been lured by the praiſe of their firſt productions from academical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, and waſted their days in vice and dependence. The virgin who too ſoon aſpires to celebrity and conqueſt, periſhes by childiſh vanity, ignorant credulity, or guiltleſs indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. The genius who catches at laurels and preferment before his time, mocks the hopes that he had excited, and loſes thoſe years which might have been moſt uſefully employed, the years of youth, of ſpirit, and vivacity.</p>
               <p>IT is one of the innumerable abſurdities of pride, that we are never more impatient of direction, than in that part of liſe when we
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:1098200104:100"/>
need it moſt; we are in haſte to meet ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies whom we have not ſtrength to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and to undertake taſks which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perform: and as he that once miſcarries, does not eaſily perſuade mankind to favour or obſerve another attempt, an ineffectual ſtruggle for fame is often followed by perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual obſcurity.</p>

               <p>WE are taught by <hi>Celſus,</hi> that health is beſt preſerved by avoiding ſettled ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of life, and deviating ſometimes into ſlight aberrations from the ſtrict laws of medicine by varying the proportions of food and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, interrupting the ſucceſſions of reſt and labour, and mingling hardſhips with indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. The body, long accuſtomed to ſtated quantities, and uniform periods, is ſoon diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the ſmalleſt irregularity; and ſince we cannot exempt ourſelves wholly from the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:1098200104:101"/>
power of accident, nor adjuſt every day by the balance or barometer, but muſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times depart from rigid accuracy in compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with neceſſary affairs, or ſtrong inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he that too long obſerves nice punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alities, and condemns himſelf to voluntary imbecillity, will not long eſcape the miſeries of diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>THE ſame laxity of regimen is equally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to intellectual health, to a conſtant enjoyment of gaiety, and perpetual ſuſcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of occaſional pleaſure. He that by long confinement to the ſame company whom perhaps ſimilitude of taſte brought firſt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, has been accuſtomed to hear only the echo of his own ſentiments, quickly contracts his faculties, and makes a thouſand things offenſive that are in themſelves indifferent; he ſoon bars all the common avenues of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and has no part in the general diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions or gratifications of mankind.</p>
               <p>IN things which are not immediately ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to religious or moral conſideration, it is dangerous to be too long or too rigidly in the right. Senſibility may, by an inceſſant atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:1098200104:102"/>
to elegance and propriety, be quickened to a tenderneſs inconſiſtent with the condition of humanity, irritable by the ſmalleſt aſperity, and vulnerable by the gentleſt touch. He that pleaſes himſelf too much with minute ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs, and ſubmits to endure nothing in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations attendance, or addreſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the utmoſt point of perfection, will, whenever he enters the croud of life, be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed with innumerable diſtreſſes, from which thoſe who have not in the ſame manner en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed their ſenſations find no diſturbance. His exotick ſoftneſs will ſhrink at the coarſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of vulgar felicity, like a plant tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted to northern nurſeries, from the dews and ſunſhine of the tropical regions.</p>
               <p>THERE will always be a wide interval be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween practical and ideal excellence; and he, therefore, that allows not himſelf to be ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed while he can perceive any error or defect, muſt refer his hopes of eaſe to ſome other pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of exiſtence. It is well known, that, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to a microſcope, the ſmootheſt poliſh of the moſt ſolid bodies diſcovers cavities and prominences; and that the ſofteſt bloom of roſeate virginity repels the eye with excreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cences
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:1098200104:103"/>
and diſcolorations. The perceptions as well as the ſenſes may be improved to our own diſquiet, and we may, by diligent culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the powers of diſlike, raiſe in time an artificial faſtidiouſneſs, which ſhall fill the imagination with phantoms of turpitude, ſhew us the naked ſkeleton of every delight, and preſent us only with the pains of pleaſure, and the deformities of beauty.</p>
               <p>PEEVISHNESS, indeed, would perhaps very little diſturb the peace of mankind, were it always the conſequence of ſuperfluous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy; for it is the privilege only of deep re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, or lively fancy, to deſtroy happineſs by art and refinement. But by a continual indulgence of a particular humour, or by a long enjoyment of undiſputed ſuperiority, the dull and thoughtleſs may likewiſe acquire the power of tormenting themſelves and others, and become ſufficiently ridiculous or hateful, to thoſe who are within ſight of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, or reach of their influence.</p>
               <p>THEY that have grown old in a ſingle ſtate are generally found to be moroſe, fretful, and captious; tenacious of their own practices and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:1098200104:104"/>
maxims; ſoon offended by contradiction or negligence; and impatient of any aſſociation, but with ſuch as will watch their nod, give up all claim to choice and reaſon, and ſubmit themſelves to unlimited authority. Such is the effect of having lived without the neceſſity of conſulting any inclination but their own.</p>
               <p>THE iraſcibility of this claſs of tyrants is generally exerted upon petty provocations, ſuch as are incident to underſtandings not far extended beyond the inſtincts of animal life; but unhappily he that fixes his attention on things always before him, will never have long ceſſations of anger. There are many vete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans of luxury, upon whom every noon brings a paroxyſm of violence, fury, and execration; they never ſit down to their dinner without finding the meat ſo injudiciouſly bought, or ſo unſkilfully dreſſed, ſuch blunders in the ſeaſoning, or ſuch improprieties in the ſawce, as can ſcarcely be expiated without blood; and, in the tranſports of reſentment, make very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle diſtinctions between guilt and innocence, but let fly their menaces, or growl out their diſcontent upon all whom ſortune expoſes to the ſtorm.</p>

IT is not eaſy to imagine a more unhappy condition than that of dependence on a peeviſh man. In every other ſtate of inferiority the certainty of pleaſing is perpetually increaſed by a fuller knowledge of our duty; and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and confidence are ſtrengthened by every new act of truſt, and proof of fidelity. But peeviſhneſs ſacrifices to a momentary of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence the obſequiouſneſs or uſefulneſs of half a life, and as more is performed encreaſes her exactions.</p>
               <p>CHRYSALUS gained a fortune by trade, and retired into the country; and, having a brother burdened by the number of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, adopted one of his ſons. The boy was diſmiſſed with many prudent admonitions; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of his father's inability to maintain him in his native rank; cautioned againſt all oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the opinions or precepts of his uncle; and animated to perſeverance by the hopes of ſupporting the honour of the family, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topping his elder brother. He had a natural ductility of mind, without much warmth of affection, or elevation of ſentiment; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore readily complied with every variety of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:1098200104:106"/>
caprice; patiently endured contradictory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs; heard falſe accuſations without pain, and opprobrious reproaches without reply; laughed obſtreperouſly at the ninetieth repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of a joke; aſked queſtions about the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal decay of trade; admired the ſtrength of thoſe heads by which the price of ſtocks is changed and adjuſted; and behaved with ſuch prudence and circumſpection, that after ſix years the will was made, and <hi>Juvenculus</hi> was declared heir. But unhappily, a month after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, retiring at night from his uncle's chamber, he left the door open behind him: the old man tore his will, and being then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptibly delining, for want of time to delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, left his money to a trading company.</p>
               <p>WHEN female minds are imbittered by age or ſolitude, their malignity is generally exerted in a rigorous and ſpiteful ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendence of domeſtic trifles. <hi>Eriphile</hi> has employed her eloquence for twenty years up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the degeneracy of ſervants, the naſtineſs of her houſe, the ruin of her furniture, the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of preſerving tapeſtry from the moths, and the careleſneſs of the ſluts whom ſhe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys in bruſhing it. It is her buſineſs every
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:1098200104:107"/>
morning to viſit all the rooms, in hopes of finding a chair without its cover, a window ſhut or open contrary to her orders, a ſpot on the hearth, or a feather on the floor, that the reſt of the day may be juſtifiably ſpent in taunts of contempt, and vociferations of anger. She lives for no other purpoſe but to preſerve the neatneſs of a houſe and gardens, and feels ther inclination to pleaſure, nor aſpiration after virtue, while ſhe is engroſſed by the great em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of keeping gravel from graſs, and wainſcot from duſt. Of three amiable nieces ſhe has declared herſelf an irreconcileable enemy to one, becauſe ſhe broke off a tulip with her hoop; to another, becauſe ſhe ſpilt her coffee on a turkey carpet; and to the third, becauſe ſhe let a wet dog run into the parlour. She has broken off her intercourſe of viſits, becauſe company makes a houſe dirty; and reſolves to confine herſelf more to her own affairs, and to live no longer in mire by fooliſh lenity and indulgence.</p>
               <p>PEEVISHNESS is generally the vice of nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row minds, and, except when it is the effect of anguiſh and diſeaſe, by which the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is broken, and the mind made too feeble
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:1098200104:108"/>
to bear the lighteſt addition to its miſeries, proceeds from an unreaſonable perſuaſion of the importance of trifles. The proper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy againſt it is, to conſider the dignity of human nature, and the folly of ſuffering per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation and uneaſineſs from failures unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of our notice.</p>
               <p>HE that reſigns his peace to little caſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ſuffers the courſe of his life to be interrupted by fortuitous inadvertencies, or trivial offences, delivers up himſelf to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the wind, and loſes all that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and equanimity which conſtitute the chief praiſe of a wiſe man.</p>
               <p>THE province of prudence lies between the greateſt things and the leaſt; ſome ſurpaſs our power by their magnitude, and ſome eſcape our notice by their number and their frequency. But the indiſpenſable buſineſs of life will afford ſufficient exerciſe to every under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; and ſuch is the limitation of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man powers, that by attention to trifles we muſt let things of importance paſs unobſerved: when we examine a mite with a glaſs, we ſee nothing but a mite.</p>

THAT it is every man's intereſt to be pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will need little proof: that it is his intereſt to pleaſe others, experience will inform him. It is therefore not leſs neceſſary to happineſs than to virtue, that he rid his mind of paſſions which make him uneaſy to himſelf, and hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the world, which enchain his intellects, and obſtruct his improvement.</p>

                     <p>I Know not whether it is always a proof of innocence to treat cenſure with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. We owe ſo much reverence to the wiſdom of mankind, as juſtly to wiſh, that our own opinion of our merit may be ratified by the concurrence of other ſuffrages; and ſince guilt and infamy muſt have the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:1098200104:110"/>
upon intelligences unable to pierce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond external appearance, and influenced often rather by example than precept, we are obliged to refute a falſe charge, leſt we ſhould countenance the crime which we have never committed. To turn away from an accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with ſupercilious ſilence, is equally in the power of him that is hardened by villiany, and inſpirited by innocence. The wall of braſs which <hi>Horace</hi> erects upon a clear conſcience, may be ſometimes raiſed by impudence or power; and we ſhould always wiſh to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the dignity of virtue by adorning her with graces which wickedneſs cannot aſſume.</p>
                     <p>FOR this reaſon I have determined no longer to endure, with either patient or ſullen reſignation, a reproach, which is, at leaſt in my opinion, unjuſt; but will lay my caſe honeſtly before you, that you or your readers may at length decide it.</p>
                     <p>WHETHER you will be able to preſerve your boaſted impartiality, when you hear, that I am conſidered as an adverſary by half the ſemale world, you may ſurely pardon me for doubting, notwithſtanding the veneration to which you may imagine yourſelf en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:1098200104:111"/>
by your age, your learning, your abſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, or your virtue. Beauty, Mr. RAM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BLER, has often overpowered the reſolutions of the firm, and the reaſonings of the wiſe, rouſed the old to ſenſibility, and ſubdued the rigorous to ſoftneſs.</p>
                     <p>I AM one of thoſe unhappy beings, who have been marked out as huſbands for many different women, and deliberated a hundred times on the brink of matrimony. I have diſcuſſed all the nuptial preliminaries ſo often, that I can repeat the forms in which join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are ſettled, pin-money ſecured, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions for younger children aſcertained; but am at laſt doomed by general conſent to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſolitude, and excluded by an irreverſible decree from all hopes of connubial felicity. I am pointed out by every mother, as a man whoſe viſits cannot be admitted without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach; who raiſes hopes only to embitter diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment, and makes offers only to ſeduce girls into a waſte of that part of life, in which they might gain advantageous matches, and become miſtreſſes and mothers.</p>
                     <p>I HOPE you will think, that ſome part of this penal ſeverity may juſtly be remitted,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:1098200104:112"/>
when I inform you, that I never yet profeſſed love to a woman without ſincere intentions of marriage; that I have never continued an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of intimacy from the hour that my inclination changed, but to preſerve her whom I was leaving from the ſhock of abruptneſs, or the ignominy of contempt; that I always en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to give the ladies an opportunity of ſeeming to diſcard me; and that I never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook a miſtreſs for larger fortune, or brighter beauty, but becauſe I diſcovered ſome irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity in her conduct, or ſome depravity in her mind; not becauſe I was charmed by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, but becauſe I was offended by herſelf.</p>
                     <p>I WAS very early tired of that ſucceſſion of amuſements by which the thoughts of moſt young men are diſſipated and enfeebled, and had not long glittered in the ſplendour of an ample patrimony before I wiſhed for the calm and ſerenity of domeſtick happineſs. Youth is naturally delighted with ſprightlineſs and ardour, and therefore I breathed out the ſighs of my firſt affection at the feet of the gay, the ſparkling, the vivacious <hi>Ferocula.</hi> I fancied to myſelf a perpetual ſource of happineſs in wit never exhauſted, and ſpirit never depreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:1098200104:113"/>
looked with veneration on her readineſs of expedients, contempt of difficulty, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of addreſs, and promptitude of reply; conſidered her as exempt by ſome prerogative of nature from the weakneſs and timidity of female minds; and congratulated myſelf upon a companion ſuperior to all common troubles and embarraſſments. I was, indeed, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what diſturbed by the unſhaken perſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with which ſhe enforced her demands of an unreaſonable ſettlement; but ſhould have conſented to paſs my life in her arms, had not my curioſity led me to a croud gathered in the ſtreet, where I found <hi>Ferocula,</hi> in the preſence of hundreds, diſputing for ſix-pence with a chairman. I ſaw her in ſo little need of aſſiſtance, that it was no breach of the laws of chivalry to forbear interpoſition, and I ſpared myſelf therefore the ſhame of owning her acquaintance. I forgot ſome point of ceremony at our next interview, and ſoon provoked her to forbid me her preſence.</p>
                     <p>MY next attempt was upon a lady of great eminence for learning and philoſophy. I had frequently obſerved the barrenneſs and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of connubial converſation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:1098200104:114"/>
thought highly of my own prudence and diſcernment when I ſelected from a multitude of wealthy beauties, the deep-read <hi>Miſothea,</hi> who declared herſelf the inexorable enemy of ignorant pertneſs, and puerile levity; and ſcarcely condeſcended to make tea, but for the linguiſt, the geometrician, the aſtronomer, or the poet. The queen of the <hi>Amazons</hi> was only to be gained by the hero who could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer her in ſingle combat; and <hi>Miſothea</hi>'s heart was only to bleſs the ſcholar who could overpower her by diſputation. Amidſt the fondeſt tranſports of courtſhip ſhe could call for a definition of terms, and treated every argument with contempt that could not be reduced to regular ſyllogiſm. You may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imagine, that I wiſhed this courtſhip at an end; but when I deſired her to ſhorten my torments, and fix the day of my felicity, we were led into a long converſation, in which <hi>Miſothea</hi> endeavoured to demonſtrate the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of attributing choice and ſelf-direction to any human being. It was not difficult to diſcover the danger of committing myſelf for ever to the arms of one who might at any time miſtake the dictates of paſſion, or the calls of appetite, for the decree of fate; or
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:1098200104:115"/>
conſider cuckoldom as neceſſary to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſyſtem, as a link in the everlaſting chain of ſucceſſive cauſes. I therefore told her, that deſtiny had ordained us to part; and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhould have torn me from her but the talons of neceſſity.</p>
                     <p>I THEN ſolicited the regard of the calm, the prudent, the oeconomical <hi>Sophronia,</hi> a lady who conſidered wit as dangerous, and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as ſuperfluous; and thought that the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who kept her houſe clean, and her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts exact, took receipts for every payment, and could find them at a ſudden call, enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red nicely after the condition of the tenants, read the price of ſtocks once a week, and purchaſed every thing at the beſt market, could want no accompliſhments neceſſary to the happineſs of a wiſe man. She diſcourſed with great ſolemnity on the care and vigilance which the ſuperintendance of a family de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; obſerved how many were ruined by confidence in ſervants; and told me, that ſhe never expected honeſty but from a ſtrong cheſt, and that the beſt ſtorekeeper was the miſtreſs's eye. Many ſuch oracles of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity ſhe uttered, and made every day new
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:1098200104:116"/>
improvements in her ſchemes for the regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her ſervants, and the diſtribution of her time. I was convinced, that whatever I might ſuffer from <hi>Sophronia,</hi> I ſhould eſcape poverty; and we therefore proceeded to adjuſt the ſettlements according to her own rule, <hi>fair and ſoftly.</hi> But one morning her maid came to me in tears to intreat my intereſt for a reconciliation to her miſtreſs, who had turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her out at night for breaking ſix teeth in a tortoiſe-ſhell comb: ſhe had attended her lady from a diſtant province, and having not lived long enough to ſave much money, was deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute among ſtrangers, and though of a good family, in danger of periſhing in the ſtreets, or of being compelled by hunger to proſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I made no ſcruple of promiſing to reſtore her; but upon my firſt application to <hi>Sophronia</hi> was anſwered with an air which called for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, that if ſhe neglected her own af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, I might ſuſpect her of neglecting mine; that the comb ſtood her in three half-crowns; that no ſervant ſhould wrong her twice; and that indeed, ſhe took the firſt opportunity of parting with <hi>Phyllida,</hi> becauſe, though ſhe was honeſt, her conſtitution was bad, and ſhe thought her very likely to fall ſick. Of our
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:1098200104:117"/>
conference I need not tell you the effect; it furely may be forgiven me, if on this occaſion I forgot the decency of common forms.</p>
                     <p>FROM two more ladies I was diſengaged by finding, that they entertained my rivals at the ſame time, and determined their choice by the liberality of our ſettlements. Another I thought myſelf juſtified in forſaking, becauſe ſhe gave my attorney a bribe to favour her in the bargain; another, becauſe I could never ſoften her to tenderneſs, till ſhe heard that moſt of my family had died young; and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, becauſe to encreaſe her fortune by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, ſhe repreſented her ſiſter as lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing and conſumptive.</p>
                     <p>I SHALL in another letter give the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of my hiſtory of courtſhip. I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume that I ſhould hitherto have injured the majeſty of female virtue, had I not hoped to transfer my affection to higher merit.</p>

               <p>POWER and ſuperiority are ſo flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and delightful, that, fraught with temptation and expoſed to danger as they are, ſcarcely any virtue is ſo cautious, or any pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſo timorous, as to decline them. Even thoſe that have moſt reverence for the laws of right, are pleaſed with ſhewing that not fear, but choice, regulates their behaviour; and would be thought to comply, rather than obey. We love to overlook the boundaries which we do not wiſh to paſs; and, as the <hi>Roman</hi> ſatiriſt remarks, he that has no deſign to take the life of another, is yet glad to have it in his hands.</p>
               <p>FROM the ſame principle, tending yet more to degeneracy and corruption, proceeds the deſire of inveſting lawful authority with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and governing by force rather than per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion. Pride is unwilling to believe the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:1098200104:119"/>
neceſſity of aſſigning any other reaſon than her own will; and would rather maintain the moſt equitable claims by violence and penalties, than deſcend from the dignity of command to diſpute and expoſtulation.</p>
               <p>IT may, I think, be ſuſpected, that this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical pride has ſometimes found its way into legiſlative aſſemblies, and mingled with deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berations upon property and life. A ſlight peruſal of the laws by which the meaſures of vindictive and coercive juſtice are eſtabliſhed, will diſcover ſo many diſproportions between crimes and puniſhments, ſuch capricious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions of guilt, and ſuch confuſion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſneſs and ſeverity, as can ſcarcely be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to have been produced by publick wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſincerely and calmly ſtudious of publick happineſs.</p>
               <p>THE learned, the judicious, the pious <hi>Boerhaave</hi> relates, that he never ſaw a crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal dragged to execution without aſking himſelf, "Who knows whether this man is not leſs culpable than me?" On the days when the priſons of this city are emptied into the grave, let every ſpectator of the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:1098200104:120"/>
proceſſion put the ſame queſtion to his own heart. How few among thoſe that croud in thouſands to the legal maſſacre, and look with careleſſneſs, perhaps with triumph, on the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt exacerbations of human miſery, would then be able to return without horror and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection? For, who can congratulate himſelf upon a life paſſed without ſome act more miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous to the peace or proſperity of others, than the theft of a piece of money?</p>
               <p>IT has been always the practice, when any particular ſpecies of robbery becomes preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and common, to endeavour its ſuppreſſion by capital denunciations. Thus, one gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of malefactors is commonly cut off, and their ſucceſſors are frighted into new expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents; the art of thievery is augmented with greater variety of fraud, and ſubtilized to higher degrees of dexterity, and more occult methods of conveyance. The law then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news the perſuit in the heat of anger, and overtakes the offender again with death. By this practice, capital inflictions are multiplied, and crimes very different in their degrees of enormity are equally ſubjected to the ſevereſt
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:1098200104:121"/>
puniſhment that man has the power of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing upon man.</p>
               <p>THE lawgiver is undoubtedly allowed to eſtimate the malignity of an offence, not merely by the loſs or pain which ſingle acts may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, but by the general alarm and anxiety ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the fear of miſchief, and inſecurity of poſſeſſion: he therefore exerciſes the right which ſocieties are ſuppoſed to have over the lives of thoſe that compoſe them, not ſimply to puniſh a tranſgreſſion, but to maintain order, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve quiet; he enforces thoſe laws with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity that are moſt in danger of violation, as the commander of a garriſon doubles the guard on that ſide which is threatened by the enemy.</p>
               <p>THIS method has been long tried, but tried with ſo little ſucceſs, that rapine and violence are hourly encreaſing; yet few ſeem willing to deſpair of its efficacy, and of thoſe who employ their ſpeculations upon the preſent corruption of the people, ſome propoſe the introduction of more horrid, lingering, and terrifick puniſhments; ſome are inclined to
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:1098200104:122"/>
accelerate the executions; ſome to diſcourage pardons; and all ſeem to think that lenity has given confidence to wickedneſs, and that we can only be reſcued from the talons of robbery by inflexible rigour, and ſanguinary juſtice.</p>
               <p>YET ſince the right of ſetting an uncertain and arbitrary value upon life has been diſputed, and ſince experience of paſt times gives us lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reaſon to hope that any reformation will be effected by a periodical havock of our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low beings, perhaps it will not be uſeleſs to conſider what conſequences might ariſe from relaxations of the law, and a more rational and equitable proportion of penalties to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences.</p>
               <p>DEATH is, as one of the ancients obſerves, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>of dreadful things the moſt dreadful</hi>; an evil, beyond which, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be threatened by ſublunary power, or feared from human enmity or vengeance. This terror ſhould, therefore, be reſerved as the laſt reſort of authority, as the ſtrongeſt and moſt operative of prohibitory ſanctions, and placed before the treaſure of life, to guard from invaſion what cannot be reſtored. To
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:1098200104:123"/>
equal robbery with murder is to reduce mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to robbery, to confound in common minds the gradations of injury, and incite the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of a greater crime, to prevent the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of a leſs. If only murder were puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with death, very few robbers would ſtain their hands in blood; but when, by the laſt act of cruelty no new danger is incurred, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſecurity may probably be obtained, upon what principle ſhall we bid them forbear?</p>
               <p>IT may be urged, that the ſentence is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten mitigated to ſimple robbery; but ſurely this is to confeſs, that our laws are unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in our own opinion; and, indeed, it may be obſerved, that all but murderers have, at their laſt hour, the common ſenſations of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind pleading in their favour.</p>
               <p>FROM this conviction of the inequality of the puniſhments to the offence proceeds the frequent ſolicitation of pardons. They who would rejoice at the correction of a thief, are yet ſhocked at the thought of deſtroying him. His crime ſhrinks to nothing compared, with
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:1098200104:124"/>
his miſery; and ſeverity defeats itſelf by exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting pity.</p>
               <p>THE gibbet, indeed, certainly diſables thoſe who die upon it from infeſting the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity; but their death ſeems not to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute more to the reformation of their aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates than any other method of ſeparation. A thief ſeldom paſſes much of his time in recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection or anticipation, but from robbery haft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens to riot, and from riot to robbery; nor, when the grave cloſes upon his companion, has any other care than to find another.</p>
               <p>THE frequency of capital puniſhments therefore rarely hinders the commiſſion of a crime, but naturally and commonly prevents its detection, and is, if we reaſon only upon pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential principles, chiefly for that reaſon to be avoided. Whatever may be urged by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuiſts or politicians, the greater part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, as they can never think, that to pick the pocket, and to pierce the heart, is equally cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, will ſcarcely believe, that two male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors ſo different in guilt can be juſtly doom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſame puniſhment; nor is the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:1098200104:125"/>
of ſubmitting the conſcience to human laws ſo plainly evinced, ſo clearly ſtated, or ſo generally allowed, but that the pious, the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the juſt, will always ſcruple to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with the community in an act which their private judgment cannot approve.</p>
               <p>HE who knows not how often rigorous laws produce total impunity, and how many crimes are concealed and forgotten for fear of hurrying the offender to that ſtate in which there is no repentance, has converſed very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle with mankind. And whatever epithets of reproach or contempt this compaſſion may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur from thoſe who confound cruelty with firmneſs, I know not whether any wiſe man would wiſh it leſs powerful, or leſs extenſive.</p>
               <p>IF thoſe whom the wiſdom of our laws has condemned to die, had been detected in their rudiments of robbery, they might by proper diſcipline, and uſeful labour, have been diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled from their habits, and by eſcaping all the temptations to ſubſequent crimes, have paſſed their days in reparation, and penitence; and detected they might all have been, had the proſecutors been certain, that their lives
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:1098200104:126"/>
would have been ſpared. I believe, every thief will confeſs, that he has been more than once ſeized and diſmiſſed; and that he has ſometimes ventured upon capital crimes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knew, that thoſe whom he injured would rather connive at his eſcape, than cloud their minds with the horrors of his death.</p>
               <p>ALL laws againſt crimes are ineffectual, unleſs ſome will inform, and ſome will proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute; but till we mitigate the penalties for mere violations of property, information will always be hated, and proſecution dreaded. The heart of a good man cannot but recoil at the thought of puniſhing a ſlight injury with death; eſpecially when he remembers, that the thief might have procured ſafety by another crime, from which he was reſtrained only by his remaining virtue.</p>
               <p>THE obligations to aſſiſt the exerciſe of publick juſtice are indeed ſtrong; but they will certainly be overpowered by tenderneſs for life. What is puniſhed with ſeverity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to our ideas of adequate retribution, will be ſeldom diſcovered; and multitudes will be ſuffered to advance from crime to crime, till
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:1098200104:127"/>
they deſerve death, becauſe if they had been early proſecuted, they would have ſuffered death before they deſerved it.</p>
               <p>THIS ſcheme of invigorating the laws by relaxation, and extirpating wickedneſs by le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, is ſo remote from common practice, that I might reaſonably fear to expoſe it to the publick, could it be ſupported only by my own obſervations: I ſhall, therefore, by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribing it to its author, Sir <hi>Thomas More,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to procure it that attention, which I wiſh always paid to prudence, to juſtice, and to mercy.</p>

                     <p>I Sit down in purſuance of my late engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to recount the remaining part of the adventures that befel me in my long queſt of conjugal felicity, which, though I have not yet been ſo happy as to obtain it, I have at leaſt endeavoured to deſerve by unwearied di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, without ſuffering from repeated diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments any abatement of my hope or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of my activity.</p>
                     <p>YOU muſt have obſerved in the world a ſpecies of mortals who employ themſelves in promoting matrimony, and without any viſible motive of intereſt or vanity, without any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable impulſe of malice or benevolence,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:1098200104:129"/>
without any reaſon, but that they want ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of attention, and topicks of converſation, are inceſſantly buſy in procuring wives and huſbands, fill the ears of every ſingle man and woman with ſome convenient match, and when they are informed of your age and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, offer a partner of life with the ſame readineſs, and the ſame indifference, as a ſaleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, when he has taken meaſure by his eye, fits his cuſtomer with a coat.</p>
                     <p>IT might be expected that they ſhould ſoon be diſcouraged from this officious interpoſition by reſentment or contempt; and that every man ſhould determine the choice on which ſo much of his happineſs muſt depend, by his own judgment and obſervation: yet it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that as theſe propoſals are generally made with a ſhew of kindneſs, they ſeldom pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke anger, but are at worſt heard with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and forgotten. They influence weak minds to approbation; for many are ſure to find in a new acquaintance, whatever qualities report has taught them to expect; and in more powerful and active underſtandings they excite curioſity, and ſometimes by a lucky
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:1098200104:130"/>
chance bring perſons of ſimilar tempers within the attraction of each other.</p>
                     <p>I WAS known to poſſeſs a fortune, and to want a wife; and therefore was frequently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by theſe hymeneal ſolicitors, with whoſe importunity I was ſometimes diverted, and ſometimes perplexed; for they contended for me as vulturs for a carcaſe; each employed all his eloquence, and all his artifices, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force and promote his own ſcheme, from the ſucceſs of which he was to receive no other advantage than the pleaſure of defeating others equally eager, and equally induſtrious.</p>
                     <p>AN invitation to ſup with one of thoſe buſy friends, made me by a concerted chance ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with <hi>Camilla,</hi> by whom it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that I ſhould be ſuddenly and irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly enſlaved. The lady, whom the ſame kindneſs had brought without her own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence into the liſts of love, ſeemed to think me at leaſt worthy of the honour of captivity; and exerted the power, both of her eyes and wit, with ſo much art and ſpirit, that though I had been too often deceived by appearances to devote myſelf irrevocably at the firſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:1098200104:131"/>
yet I could not ſuppreſs ſome raptures of admiration, and flutters of deſire. I was eaſily perſuaded to make nearer approaches; but ſoon diſcovered, that an union with <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milla</hi> was not much to be wiſhed. <hi>Camilla</hi> profeſſed a boundleſs contempt for the folly, levity, ignorance, and impertinence of her own ſex; and very frequently expreſſed her wonder, that men of learning or experience could ſubmit to trifle away life, with beings incapable of ſolid thought. In mixed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, ſhe always aſſociated with the men, and declared her ſatisfaction when the ladies retired. If any ſhort excurſion into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was propoſed, ſhe commonly inſiſted upon the excluſion of women from the party; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, where they were admitted, the time was waſted in frothy compliments, weak in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences, and idle ceremonies. To ſhew the greatneſs of her mind, ſhe avoided all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the faſhion; and to boaſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundity of her knowledge, miſtook the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous textures of ſilk, confounded tabbies with damaſks, and ſent for ribbands by wrong names. She deſpiſed the commerce of ſtated viſits, a farce of empty form without inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and congratulated herſelf, that ſhe never
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:1098200104:132"/>
learned the low ſtile of meſſage-cards. She often applauded the noble ſentiment of <hi>Plato,</hi> who rejoiced that he was born a man rather than a woman; proclaimed her approbation of <hi>Swift</hi>'s opinion, that women are only a higher ſpecies of monkies; and confeſſed, that when ſhe conſidered the behaviour, or heard the converſation, of her ſex, ſhe could not but forgive the <hi>Turks</hi> for ſuſpecting them to want ſouls.</p>
                     <p>IT was the joy and pride of <hi>Camilla</hi> to have provoked, by this inſolence, all the rage of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and all the perſecutions of calumny; nor was ſhe ever more elevated with her own ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority, than when ſhe talked of female anger, and female cunning. Well, ſays ſhe, has nature provided that ſuch virulence ſhould be diſabled by folly, and ſuch cruelty be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by impotence.</p>
                     <p>CAMILLA doubtleſs expected, that what ſhe loſt on one ſide, ſhe ſhould gain on the other; and imagined that every male heart would be open to a lady, who made ſuch ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous advances to the borders of virility. But man, ungrateful man, inſtead of ſpringing forward to meet her, ſhrunk back at her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:1098200104:133"/>
She was perſecuted by the ladies as a deſerter, and at beſt received by the men only as a fugitive. I, for my part, amuſed myſelf a while with her fopperies, but novelty ſoon gave way to deteſtation, for nothing out of the common order of nature can be long borne. I had no inclination to a wife who had the rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedneſs of man without his force, and the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of woman without her ſoftneſs; nor could I think it my quiet and honour to be truſted to ſuch audacious virtue as was hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly courting danger, and ſoliciting aſſault.</p>
                     <p>MY next miſtreſs was <hi>Nitella,</hi> a lady of gentle mien, and ſoft voice, always ſpeaking to approve, and ready to receive direction from thoſe with whom chance had brought her into company. In <hi>Nitella</hi> I promiſed myſelf an eaſy friend, with whom I might loiter away the day without diſturbance or altercation. I therefore ſoon reſolved to addreſs her, but was diſcouraged from proſecuting my courtſhip by obſerving, that her apartments were ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly regular; and that, unleſs ſhe had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of my viſit, ſhe was never to be ſeen. There is a kind of anxious cleanlineſs which I have always noted as the characteriſtick of a
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:1098200104:134"/>
ſlattern; it is the ſuperfluous ſcrupuloſity of guilt, dreading diſcovery, and ſhunning ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion: it is the violence of an effort againſt habit, which, being impelled by external mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, cannot ſtop at the middle point.</p>
                     <p>NITELLA was always tricked out rather with nicety than with elegance; and ſeldom could forbear to diſcover by her uneaſineſs and conſtraint, that her attention was burdened, and her imagination engroſſed: I therefore concluded, that being only occaſionally and ambitiouſly dreſſed, ſhe was not familiarized to her own ornaments. There are ſo many competitors for the ſame of cleanlineſs, that it is not hard to gain information of thoſe that fail, from thoſe that deſire to excel: I quickly found, that <hi>Nitella</hi> paſſed her time between finery and dirt; and was always in a wrapper, night-cap, and ſlippers, when ſhe was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corated for immediate ſhew.</p>
                     <p>I WAS then led by my evil deſtiny to <hi>Charybdis,</hi> who never neglected an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ſeizing a new prey when it came with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in her reach. I thought myſelf quickly made happy by a permiſſion to attend her to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick places; and pleaſed my own vanity with
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:1098200104:135"/>
imagining the envy which I ſhould raiſe in a thouſand hearts, by appearing as the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged favourite of <hi>Charybdis.</hi> She ſoon after hinted her intention to take a ramble for a fortnight, into a part of the kingdom which ſhe had never ſeen. I ſolicited the happineſs of accompanying her, which, after a ſhort reluctance, was indulged me. She had no other curioſity in her journey, than after all poſſible means of expence; and was every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment taking occaſion to mention ſome deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, which I knew it my duty upon ſuch notices to procure.</p>
                     <p>AFTER our return, being now more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar, ſhe told me, whenever we met, of ſome new diverſion; at night ſhe had always notice of a charming company that would breakfaſt in the gardens; and in the morning ſhe had been informed of ſome new ſong in the opera, ſome new dreſs at the play-houſe, or ſome performer at a concert whom ſhe long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to hear. Her intelligence was ſuch, that there never was a ſhew, to which ſhe did not ſummon me on the ſecond day; and as ſhe hated a croud, and could not go alone, I was obliged to attend at ſome intermediate hour,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:1098200104:136"/>
and pay the price of a whole company. When we paſſed the ſtreets, ſhe was often charmed with ſome trinket in the toy-ſhops; and from moderate deſires of ſeals and ſnuff-boxes, roſe, by degrees, to gold and diamonds. I now began to find the ſmile of <hi>Charybdis</hi> too coſtly for a private purſe, and added one more to ſix and forty lovers, whoſe fortune and patience her rapacity had exhauſted.</p>
                     <p>IMPERIA then took poſſeſſion of my affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; but kept them only for a ſhort time. She had newly inherited a large fortune, and, having ſpent the early part of her life in the peruſal of romances, brought with her into the gay world all the pride of <hi>Cleopatra</hi>; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected nothing leſs than vows, altars, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices; and thought her charms diſhonoured, and her power infringed, by the ſofteſt oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to her ſentiments, or the ſmalleſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of her commands. Time might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed cure this ſpecies of pride in a mind not naturally undiſcerning, and vitiated only by falſe repreſentations; but the operations of time are ſlow; and I therefore left her to grow wiſe at leiſure, or to continue in error at her own expence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="136" facs="tcp:1098200104:137"/>
THUS I have hitherto, in ſpite of myſelf, paſſed my life in frozen celibacy. My friends, indeed, often tell me, that I flatter my ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination with higher hopes than human nature can gratify; that I dreſs up an ideal charmer in all the radiance of perfection, and then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the world to look for the ſame excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in corporeal beauty. But ſurely, Mr. RAMBLER, it is not madneſs to hope for ſome terreſtrial lady unſtained with the ſpots which I have been deſcribing; at leaſt, I am reſolved to purſue my ſearch; for I am ſo far from thinking meanly of marriage, that I believe it able to afford the higheſt happineſs decreed to our preſent ſtate; and if after all theſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages I find a woman that fills up my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, you ſhall hear once more from</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>I Was the ſecond ſon of a country gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man by the daughter of a wealthy citizen of <hi>London.</hi> My father, having by his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage freed the eſtate from a heavy mortgage, and paid his ſiſters their portions, thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf diſcharged from all obligation to farther thought, and entitled to ſpend the reſt of his life in rural pleaſures. He therefore ſpared nothing that might contribute to the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his felicity; he procured the beſt guns and horſes that the kingdom could ſupply, paid large ſalaries to his groom and huntſman, and became the envy of the county for the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of his hounds. But above all his other attainments, he was eminent for a breed of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:1098200104:139"/>
pointers and ſetting dogs, which by long and vigilant cultivation he had ſo much improved, that not a partridge or heathcock could reſt in ſecurity, and game of whatever ſpecies that dared to light upon his manor, was beaten down by his ſhot, or covered with his nets.</p>
                     <p>MY elder brother was very early initiated in the chace, and at an age when other boys are <hi>creeping like ſnails unwillingly to ſchool,</hi> he could wind the horn, beat the buſhes, bound over hedges, and ſwim rivers. When the huntſman one day broke his leg, he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied his place with equal abilities, and came home with the ſcut in his hat, amidſt the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations of the whole village. I being either delicate, or timorous, leſs deſirous of honour, or leſs capable of ſylvan heroiſm, was always the favourite of my mother; becauſe I kept my coat clean, and my complexion free from freckles, and did not come home like my brother mired and tanned, nor carry corn in my hat to the horſe, nor bring dirty curs into the parlour.</p>
                     <p>MY mother had not been taught to amuſe herſelf with books, and being much inclined
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:1098200104:140"/>
to deſpiſe the ignorance and barbarity of the country ladies, diſdained to learn their ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or converſation, and had made no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to the notions which ſhe had brought from the precincts of <hi>Cornhill.</hi> She was, therefore, always recounting the glories of the city; enumerating the ſucceſſion of mayors; celebrating the magnificence of the banquets at <hi>Guildhall</hi>; and relating the civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties paid her at the companies feaſts by men, of whom ſome are now made aldermen, ſome have fined for ſheriffs, and none are worth leſs than forty thouſand pounds. She frequently diſplaid her father's greatneſs; told of the large bills which he had paid at ſight; of the ſums for which his word would paſs upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change; the heaps of gold which he uſed on <hi>Saturday</hi> night to toſs about with a ſhovel; the extent of his warehouſe, and the ſtrength of his doors; and when ſhe relaxed her ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination with lower ſubjects, deſcribed the furniture of their country-houſe, or repeated the wit of the clerks and porters.</p>
                     <p>BY theſe narratives I was fired with the ſplendor and dignity of <hi>London,</hi> and of trade. I therefore devoted myſelf to a ſhop, and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:1098200104:141"/>
warmed my imagination from year to year with enquiries about the privileges of a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the power of the common council, the dignity of a wholeſale dealer, and the grandeur of mayoralty, to which my mother aſſured me that many had arrived who began the world with leſs than myſelf.</p>
                     <p>I WAS very impatient to enter into a path, which led to ſuch honour and felicity; but was forced for a time to endure ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of my eagerneſs, for it was my grandfather's maxim, that <hi>a young man ſeldom makes much money, who is out of his time before two-and-twenty.</hi> They thought it neceſſary, therefore, to keep me at home till the proper age, without any other employment than that of learning merchants accounts, and the art of regulating books; but at length the tedious days elapſed, I was tranſplanted to town, and, with great ſatisfaction to myſelf, bound to a haberdaſher.</p>
                     <p>MY maſter, who had no conception of any virtue, merit, or dignity, but that of being rich, had all the good qualities which naturally ariſe from a cloſe and unwearied attention to
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:1098200104:142"/>
the main chance: his deſire to gain wealth was ſo well tempered by the vanity of ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, that without any other principle of action, he lived in the eſteem of the whole commercial world; and was always treated with reſpect by the only men, whoſe good opinion he valued or ſolicited, thoſe who were univerſally allowed to be richer than himſelf.</p>
                     <p>BY his inſtructions I learned in a few weeks to handle a yard with great dexterity, to wind tape neatly upon the ends of my fingers, and to make up parcels with exact frugality of paper and packthread; and ſoon caught from my fellow apprentices, the true grace of a counter bow, the careleſs air with which a ſmall pair of ſcales is to be held between the fingers, and the vigour and ſprightlineſs with which the box, after the ribband has been cut, is returned into its place. Having no deſire of any higher employment, and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, applying all my powers to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of my trade, I was quickly maſter of all that could be known, became a critick in ſmall wares, contrived new variations of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, and new mixtures of colours, and was
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:1098200104:143"/>
ſometimes conſulted by the weavers when they projected faſhions for the enſuing ſpring.</p>
                     <p>WITH all theſe accompliſhments, in the fourth year of my apprenticeſhip, I paid a viſit to my friends in the country, where I expected to be received as a new ornament of the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and conſulted by the neighbouring gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as a maſter of pecuniary knowledge, and by the ladies as an oracle of the mode. But unhappily at the firſt publick table to which I was invited, appeared a ſtudent of the temple, and an officer of the guards, who looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me with a ſmile of contempt, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed at once all my hopes of diſtinction, ſo that I durſt hardly raiſe my eyes for fear of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countering their ſuperiority of mien. Nor was my courage revived by any opportunities of diſplaying my knowledge; for the templar entertained the company for part of the day with hiſtorical narratives, and political obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations; and the colonel afterwards detailed the adventures of a birth-night, told the claims and expectations of the courtiers, and gave an account of aſſemblies, gardens, and diverſions. I, indeed, eſſayed to fill up a pauſe in a parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary debate with a ſaint mention of trade,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:1098200104:144"/>
and <hi>Spaniards</hi>; and once attempted with ſome wramth, to correct a groſs miſtake about a ſilver breaſt-knot; but neither of my antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts ſeemed to think a reply neceſſary; they reſumed their diſcourſe without emotion, and again engroſſed the attention of the company; nor did one of the ladies appear deſirous to know my opinion of her dreſs, or to hear how long the carnation ſhot with white that was then new amongſt them had been antiquated in town.</p>
                     <p>AS I knew that neither of theſe gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had more money than myſelf, I could not diſcover what had depreſſed me in their preſence; nor why they were conſidered by others as more worthy of attention and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect; and therefore reſolved, when we met again, to rouſe my ſpirit, and force myſelf into notice. I went very early to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weekly meeting, and was entertaining a ſmall circle very ſucceſsfully with a minute repreſentation of my lord mayor's ſhew, when the colonel entered careleſs and gay, ſat down with a kind of unceremonious civility, and without appearing to intend any interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, drew my audience away to the other
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:1098200104:145"/>
part of the room, to which I had not the courage to follow them. Soon after came in the lawyer, not indeed with the ſame attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mien, but with greater powers of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; and by one or other the company was ſo happily amuſed, that I was neither heard nor ſeen, nor was able to give any other proof of my exiſtence than that I put round the glaſs, and was in my turn permitted to name the toaſt.</p>
                     <p>MY mother indeed endeavoured to comfort me in my vexation, by telling me, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps theſe ſhowy talkers were hardly able to pay every one his own; that he who has mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in his pocket needs not care what any man ſays of him; that, if I minded my trade, the time would come when lawyers and ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers would be glad to borrow out of my purſe; and that it is fine, when a man can ſet his hands to his ſides, and ſay he is worth forty thouſand pounds every day of the year. Theſe, and many more ſuch conſolations and encouragements, I received from my good mother, which however did not much allay my uneaſineſs; for, having by ſome accident heard, that the country ladies deſpiſed her as a
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:1098200104:146"/>
cit, I had therefore no longer much reverence for her opinions, but conſidered her as one whoſe ignorance and prejudice had hurried me, though without ill intentions, into a ſtate of meanneſs and ignominy, from which I could not find any poſſibility of riſing to the rank which my anceſtors had always held.</p>
                     <p>I RETURNED, however, to my maſter, and buſied myſelf among thread, and ſilk, and laces, but without my former chearfulneſs or ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity. I had now no longer any felicity in contemplating the exact diſpoſition of my powdered curls, the equal plaits of my ruffles, or the gloſſy blackneſs of my ſhoes; nor heard with my former elevation thoſe compliments which ladies ſometimes condeſcended to pay me upon my readineſs in twiſting a paper, or counting out the change. The term of <hi>Young man,</hi> with which I was ſometimes honoured as I carried a parcel to the door of a coach, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured my imagination; I grew negligent of my perſon, and ſullen in my temper, often miſtook the demands of the cuſtomers, treated their caprices and objections with contempt, and received and diſmiſſed them with ſurly ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="146" facs="tcp:1098200104:147"/>
My maſter was afraid leſt the ſhop ſhould ſuffer by this change of my behaviour, and, therefore, after ſome expoſtulations, poſted me in the warehouſe, and preſerved me from the danger and reproach of deſertion, to which my diſcontent would certainly have urged me, had I continued any longer behind the counter.</p>
                     <p>In the ſixth year of my ſervitude my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther died of drunken joy, for having run down a fox that had baffled all the packs in the province. I was now heir, and with the hearty conſent of my maſter commenced gentleman. The adventures in which my new character engaged me ſhall be communicated in another letter, by, Sir,</p>

                     <p>NOTHING has more retarded the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of learning than the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of vulgar minds to ridicule and vilify what they cannot comprehend. All induſtry muſt be excited by hope; and as the ſtudent often propoſes no other reward to himſelf than praiſe, he is eaſily diſcouraged by contempt and inſult. He who brings with him into a clamorous multitude the timidity of recluſe ſpeculation, and has never hardened his front in publick life, nor accuſtomed his paſſions to the viciſſitudes and accidents, the triumphs and defeats of mixed converſation, will bluſh at the ſtare of petulant incredulity, and ſuffer himſelf to be driven, by a burſt of laughter, from the fortreſſes of demonſtration. The mechaniſt will be afraid to aſſert before hardy contradiction, the poſſibility of tearing down

bulwarks with a ſilk-worm's thread; and the aſtronomer of relating the rapidity of light, the diſtance of the fixed ſtars, and the height of the lunar mountains.</p>
                     <p>IF I could by any efforts have ſhaken off this cowardice, I had not ſheltered myſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a borrowed name, nor applied to you for the means of communicating to the public the theory of a garret; a ſubject which, except ſome ſlight and tranſient ſtrictures, has been hitherto neglected by thoſe who were beſt qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to adorn it, either for want of leiſure to proſecute the various reſearches in which a nice diſcuſſion muſt neceſſarily engage them, or becauſe it requires ſuch diverſity of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and ſuch extent of curioſity, as is ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be found in any ſingle intellect; or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps others, having more ſagacity than myſelf, foreſaw the tumults which would be raiſed againſt them, and conſidering that it was vain to write what they durſt not publiſh, confined their knowledge to their own breaſts, and abandoned prejudice and folly to the direction of chance.</p>
                     <p>THAT the profeſſors of literature generally
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:1098200104:150"/>
reſide in the higheſt ſtories, has been immemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially obſerved. The wiſdom of the ancients was well acquainted with the intellectual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of an elevated ſituation: why elſe were the <hi>Muſes</hi> ſtationed on <hi>Olympus</hi> or <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſus</hi> by thoſe who could with equal right have raiſed them bowers in the vale of <hi>Tempe,</hi> or erected their altars among the flexures of <hi>Meander?</hi> Why was <hi>Jove</hi> himſelf nurſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a mountain? or why did the gooddeſſes, when the prize of beauty was conteſted, try the cauſe upon the top of <hi>Ida?</hi> Such were the fictions by which the great maſters of the earlier ages endeavoured to inculcate to poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity the importance of a garret, which, though they had been long obſcured by the negligence and ignorance of ſucceeding times, were well enforced by the celebrated ſymbol of <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi>

                     <p>THE inſtitution has, indeed, continued to our own time; the garret is ſtill the uſual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle of the philoſopher and poet; but this, like many ancient cuſtoms, is perpetuated only by an accidental imitation, without knowledge of the original reaſon for which it was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed. <hi>Cauſa latet</hi>; <hi>res eſt notiſſima.</hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures have, indeed, been advanced con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe habitations of literature, but
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:1098200104:152"/>
without much ſatisfaction to the judicious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer. Some have imagined, that the garret is generally choſen by the wits, as moſt eaſily rented; and concluded that no man rejoices in his aereal abode, but on the days of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Others ſuſpect, that a garret is chiefly convenient, as it is remoter than any other part of the houſe from the outer door, which is often obſerved to be infeſted by viſitants, who talk inceſſantly of beer, or linen, or a coat, and repeat the ſame ſounds every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſometimes again in the afternoon, without any variation, except that they grow daily more importunate and clamorous, and raiſe their voices in time from mournful murmurs to raging vociferations. This eternal monotony is always deteſtable to a man whoſe chief pleaſure is to enlarge his knowledge, and vary his ideas. Others talk of freedom from noiſe, and abſtraction from common buſineſs or amuſements; and ſome, yet more viſionary, tell us that the faculties are inlarged by open proſpects, and that the fancy is more at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, when the eye ranges without confinement.</p>
                     <p>THESE conveniencies may perhaps all be found in a well choſen garret; but ſurely they
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:1098200104:153"/>
cannot be ſuppoſed ſufficiently important to have operated unvariably upon different cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, diſtant ages, and ſeparate nations. Of an univerſal practice, there muſt ſtill be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed an univerſal cauſe, which, however re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condite and abſtruſe, may be perhaps reſerved to make me illuſtrious by its diſcovery, and you by its promulgation.</p>
                     <p>IT is univerſally known, that the faculties of the mind are invigorated or weakened by the ſtate of the body, and that the body is in a great meaſure regulated by the various com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the ambient element. The ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the air in the production or cure of corporal maladies have been acknowledged from the time of <hi>Hippocrates</hi>; but no man has yet ſufficiently conſidered how far it may influence the operations of the genius, though every day affords inſtances of local under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, of wits and reaſoners, whoſe facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are adapted to ſome ſingle ſpot, and who, when they are removed to any other place ſink at once into ſilence and ſtupidity. I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by a long ſeries of obſervations, that invention and elocution ſuffer great impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from denſe and impure vapours, and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:1098200104:154"/>
that the tenuity of a defecated air at a proper diſtance from the ſurface of the earth, accele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates the fancy, and ſets at liberty thoſe intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual powers which were before ſhackled by too ſtrong attraction, and unable to expand themſelves under the preſſure of a groſs at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere. I have found dulneſs to quicken into ſentiment in a thin ether, as water, though not very hot, boils in a receiver part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exhauſted; and heads in appearance empty have teemed with notions upon riſing ground, as the flaccid ſides of a football would have ſwelled out into ſtiffneſs and extenſion.</p>
                     <p>FOR this reaſon I never think myſelf quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to judge deciſively of any man's faculties, whom I have only known in one degree of elevation; but take ſome opportunity of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending him from the cellar to the garret, and try upon him all the various degrees of rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and condenſation, tenſion and laxity. If he is neither vivacious aloft, nor ſerious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, I then conſider him as hopeleſs; but as it ſeldom happens, that I do not find the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to which the texture of his brain is fitted, I accommodate him in time with a tube of mercury, firſt marking the point moſt favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:1098200104:155"/>
to his intellects, according to rules which I have long ſtudied, and which I may, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, reveal to mankind in a complete treatiſe of barometrical pneumatology.</p>
                     <p>ANOTHER cauſe of the gaiety and ſpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of the dwellers in garrets is probably the encreaſe of that vertiginous motion, with which we are carried round by the diurnal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution of the earth. The power of agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the ſpirits is well known; every man has felt his heart lightened in a rapid ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle, or on a galloping horſe; and nothing is plainer, than that he who towers to the fifth ſtory, is whirled through more ſpace by every circumrotation, than another that grovels upon the ground-floor. The nations between the tropicks, are known to be fiery, inconſtant, inventive, and fanciful, becauſe, living at the utmoſt length of the earth's diameter, they are carried about with more ſwiftneſs than thoſe whom nature has placed nearer to the poles; and therefore, as it becomes a wiſe man to ſtruggle with the inconveniences of his country, whenever celerity and acuteneſs are requiſite, we muſt actuate our languor by taking a few turns round the center in a garret.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="155" facs="tcp:1098200104:156"/>
IF you imagine that I aſcribe to air and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion effects which they cannot produce, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you to conſult your own memory, and conſider whether you have never known a man acquire reputation in his garret, which, when fortune or a patron had placed him upon the firſt floor, he was unable to maintain; and who never recovered his former vigour of underſtanding till he was reſtored to his original ſituation. That a garret will make every man a wit, I am very far from ſuppoſing; I know there are ſome who would continue blockheads even on the ſummit of the <hi>Andes,</hi> or on the pic of <hi>Teneriffe.</hi> But let not any man be conſidered as unimproveable till this potent remedy has been tried; for perhaps, he was formed to be great only in a garret, as the joiner of <hi>Aretaeus</hi> was rational in no other place but his own ſhop.</p>
                     <p>I THINK a frequent removal to various diſtances from the center ſo neceſſary to a juſt eſtimate of intellectual abilities, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of ſo great uſe in education, that if I hoped that the public could be perſuaded to ſo expenſive an experiment, I would propoſe,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:1098200104:157"/>
that there ſhould be a cavern dug, and a tower erected, like thoſe which <hi>Bacon</hi> deſcribes in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s houſe, for the expanſion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centration of underſtanding, according to the exigence of different employments, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions. Perhaps ſome that fume away in meditations upon time and ſpace in the tower, might compoſe tables of intereſt at a certain depth; and he that upon level ground ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates in ſilence, or creeps in narrative, might, at the height of half a mile, ferment into merriment, ſparkle with repartee, and froth with declamation.</p>
                     <p>ADDISON obſerves that we may find the heat of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s climate, in ſome lines of his <hi>Georgic:</hi> ſo, when I read a compoſition, I immediately determine the height of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's habitation. As an elaborate perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is commonly ſaid to ſmell of the lamp, my commendation of a noble thought, a ſprightly fally, or a bold figure, is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it freſh from the garret; an expreſſion which would break from me upon the peruſal of moſt of your papers, did I not believe, that you ſometimes quit the garret, and aſcend into the cock-loft.</p>

                  <hi>CICERO</hi> has, with his uſual elegance and magnificence of language, attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in his relation of the dream of <hi>Scipio,</hi> to depreciate thoſe honours for which he himſelf appears to have panted with reſtleſs and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate ſolicitude, by ſhewing within what nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row limits all that fame and celebrity which man can hope from men is circumſcribed.</p>
               <p>"YOU ſee," ſays <hi>Africanus,</hi> pointing at the earth from the celeſtial regions, "that the globe aſſigned to the reſidence and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation of human beings is of ſmall dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: how then can you obtain from the praiſe of men, any glory worthy of a wiſh? Of this little world the inhabited parts are neither numerous nor wide; even the ſpots where men are found are broken by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening deſarts; and the nations are ſo ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:1098200104:159"/>
as that nothing can be tranſmitted from one to another. With the people of the ſouth, by whom the oppoſite part of the earth is poſſeſſed, you have no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; and by how ſmall a tract do you communicate with the countries of the north? The territory which you inhabit is no more than a ſcanty iſland, incloſed by a ſmall body of water, to which you give the name of the great ſea, and the <hi>Atlantick</hi> ocean. And even in this known and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented continent, what hope can you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain, that your renown will paſs the ſtream of <hi>Ganges,</hi> or the cliffs of <hi>Caucaſus?</hi> or by whom will your name be uttered in the extremities of the north or ſouth, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the riſing or the ſetting ſun? So nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is the ſpace to which your fame can be propagated, and even there how long will it remain?"</p>
               <p>HE then proceeds to aſſign natural cauſes why fame is not only narrow in its extent, but ſhort in its duration; he obſerves the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the computation of time in earth and heaven, and declares, that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:1098200104:160"/>
to the celeſtial chronology, no human honours can laſt a ſingle year.</p>
               <p>SUCH are the objections by which <hi>Tully</hi> has made a ſhew of diſcouraging the perſuit of fame; objections which ſufficiently diſcover his tenderneſs and regard for his darling phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom. <hi>Homer,</hi> when the plan of his poem made the death of <hi>Patroclus</hi> neceſſary, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, at leaſt, that he ſhould die with honour; and, therefore, brought down againſt him the patron god of <hi>Troy,</hi> and left to <hi>Hector</hi> only the mean taſk of giving the laſt blow to an enemy whom a divine hand had diſabled from reſiſtance. Thus <hi>Tully</hi> ennobles fame, which he profeſſes to degrade by oppoſing it to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial happineſs; he confines not its extent but by the boundaries of nature, nor contracts its duration but by repreſenting it ſmall in the eſtimation of ſuperior beings. He ſtill admits it the higheſt and nobleſt of terreſtrial objects, and alleges little more againſt it, than that it is neither without end, nor without limits.</p>
               <p>WHAT might be the effect of theſe obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations conveyed in <hi>Ciceronian</hi> eloquence to <hi>Roman</hi> underſtandings, cannot be determined;
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:1098200104:161"/>
but few of thoſe who ſhall in the preſent age read my humble verſion will find themſelves much depreſſed in their hopes, or retarded in their deſigns; for I am not inclined to believe, that they who among us paſs their lives in the cultivating of knowledge, or the acquiſition of power, have very anxiouſly enquired what opinions prevail on the farther banks of the <hi>Ganges,</hi> or have invigorated any effort by the deſire of ſpreading their renown among the clans of <hi>Caucaſus.</hi> The hopes and fears of modern minds are content to range in a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower compaſs; a ſingle nation, and a few years, have generally ſufficient amplitude to fill our imagination.</p>
               <p>A LITTLE conſideration will indeed teach us, that fame has other limits than mountains and oceans; and that he who places happineſs in the frequent repetition of his name, may ſpend his life in propagating it, without any danger of weeping for new worlds, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of paſſing the <hi>Atlantick</hi> ſea.</p>
               <p>THE numbers to whom any real and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible good or evil can be derived by the greateſt power, or moſt active diligence, are
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:1098200104:162"/>
inconſiderable; and where neither benefit nor miſchief operate, the only motive to the mention or remembrance of others is curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; a paſſion, which, though in ſome degree univerſally aſſociated with reaſon, is eaſily confined, overborn, or diverted from any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular object.</p>
               <p>AMONG the lower claſſes of mankind, there will be found very little deſire of any other knowledge, than what may contribute imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to the relief of ſome preſſing uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or the attainment of ſome near advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. The <hi>Turks</hi> are ſaid to hear with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a propoſal to walk out, only that they may walk back; and enquire, why any man ſhould labour for nothing: ſo thoſe whoſe condition has always reſtrained them to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of their own neceſſities, and who have been accuſtomed to look forward only to a ſmall diſtance, will ſcarcely underſtand, why nights and days ſhould be ſpent in ſtudies, which end in new ſtudies, and which, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Malherbe</hi>'s obſervation, do not tend to leſſen the price of bread; nor will the trader or manufacturer eaſily be perſuaded, that much pleaſure can ariſe from the mere know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:1098200104:163"/>
of actions, performed in remote regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or in diſtant times; or that any thing can deſerve their enquiry, of which <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>, we can only hear the report, but which cannot influence our lives by any conſequences.</p>
               <p>THE truth is, that very few have leiſure from indiſpenſable buſineſs, to employ their thoughts upon narrative or characters; and among thoſe to whom fortune has given the liberty of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more by their own choice, many create to themſelves engagements, by the indulgence of ſome petty ambition, the admiſſion of ſome inſatiable deſire, or the toleration of ſome predominant paſſion. The man whoſe whole wiſh is to accumulate money, has no other care than to collect intereſt, to eſtimate ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, and to enquire for mortgages: the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver diſdains to turn his ear to any other name than that of <hi>Corinna</hi>; and the courtier thinks the hour loſt, which is not ſpent in promoting his intereſt, and facilitating his advancement. The adventures of valour, and the diſcoveries of ſcience, will find a cold reception, when they are obtruded upon an attention, thus
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:1098200104:164"/>
buſy with its favourite amuſement, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patent of interruption or diſturbance.</p>
               <p>BUT not only ſuch employments as ſeduce attention by the appearance of dignity, or the promiſe of happineſs, may reſtrain the mind from excurſion and enquiry; curioſity may be equally deſtroyed by leſs formidable enemies; it may be diſſipated in trifles, or congealed by indolence. The ſportſmen and the men of dreſs have their heads filled with a fox or a horſe-race, a feather or a ball; and live in ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of every thing beſide, with as much content as he that heaps up gold, or ſolicits preferment, digs the field, or beats the anvil; and ſome dream out their days without plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or buſineſs, without joy or ſorrow, nor ever rouſe from their lethargy to hear or think.</p>
               <p>EVEN of thoſe who have dedicated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to knowledge, the far greater part have confined their curioſity to a few objects, and have very little inclination to promote any fame, but that of which their own ſtudies entitle them to partake. The naturaliſt has no deſire to know the opinions or conjectures
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:1098200104:165"/>
of the philologer: the botaniſt looks upon the aſtronomer, as a being unworthy of his regard: the lawyer ſcarcely hears the name of a phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician without contempt; and he that is growing great and happy by electrifying a bottle, wonders how the world can be engaged by trifling prattle about war or peace.</p>
               <p>IF, therefore, he that imagines the world filled with his actions and praiſes, ſhall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct from the number of his encomiaſts, all thoſe who are placed below the flight of fame, and who hear in the vallies of life no other voice than that of neceſſity; all thoſe who imagine themſelves too important to regard him, and conſider the mention of his name, as an uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of their time; all who are too much, or too little, pleaſed with themſelves, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to any thing external; all who are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by pleaſure, or chained down by pain, to unvaried ideas; all who are with-held from attending his triumph by different perſuits; and all who ſlumber in univerſal negligence; he will find his renown ſtreightened by nearer bounds than the rocks of <hi>Caucaſus,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that no man can be venerable or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:1098200104:166"/>
but to a ſmall part of his fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>THAT we may not languiſh in our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours after excellence, it is neceſſary, that, as <hi>Africanus</hi> counſels his deſcendant, "we raiſe our eyes to higher proſpects, and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate our future and eternal ſtate, without giving up our hearts to the praiſe of crouds, or fixing our hopes on ſuch rewards as hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man power can beſtow."</p>

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:1098200104:167"/>
think thoſe writers friends to human happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who endeavour to excite in either ſex a general contempt or ſuſpicion of the other. To perſuade them who are entering the world, and looking abroad for a ſuitable aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate, that all are equally vicious, or equally ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous; that they who truſt are certainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed, and they who eſteem are always diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed; is not to awaken judgment, but to inflame temerity. Without hope there can be no caution. Thoſe who are convinced, that no reaſon for preference can be found, will never haraſs their thoughts with doubt and deliberation; they will reſolve, ſince they are doomed to miſery, that no needleſs anxiety ſhall diſturb their quiet; they will plunge at hazard into the croud, and ſnatch the firſt hand that ſhall be held toward them.</p>
                     <p>THAT the world is over-run with vice, cannot be denied; but vice, however predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant, has not yet gained an unlimited do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion. Simple and unmingled good is not in our power, but we may generally eſcape a greater evil by ſuffering a leſs; and therefore, thoſe who undertake to initiate the young and ignorant in the knowledge of life, ſhould
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:1098200104:168"/>
be careful to inculcate the poſſibility of virtue and happineſs, and to encourage endeavours by proſpects of ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>YOU perhaps do not ſuſpect, that theſe are the ſentiments of one who has been ſubject for many years to all the hardſhips of antiquated virginity; has been long accuſtomed to the coldneſs of neglect, and the petulance of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult; has been mortified in full aſſemblies by enquiries after forgotten faſhions, games long diſuſed, and wits and beauties of ancient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown; has been invited, with malicious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, to the ſecond wedding of many ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintances; has been ridiculed by two gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of coquets in whiſpers intended to be heard; and been long conſidered by the airy and gay, as too venerable for familiarity, and too wiſe for pleaſure. It is indeed natural for injury to provoke anger, and by continual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition to produce an habitual aſperity; yet I have hitherto ſtruggled with ſo much vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance againſt my pride, and my reſentment, that I have preſerved my temper uncorrupted. I have not yet made it any part of my employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to collect ſentences againſt marriage; nor am inclined to leſſen the number of the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:1098200104:169"/>
few friends whom time has left me, by obſtructing that happineſs which I cannot partake, and venting my vexation in cenſures of the forwardneſs and indiſcretion of girls, or the inconſtancy, taſteleſneſs, and perfidy of men.</p>
                     <p>IT is, indeed, not very difficult to bear that condition to which we are not condemned by neceſſity, but induced by obſervation and choice; and therefore I, perhaps, have never yet felt all the malignity with which a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach edged with the appellation of old maid ſwells ſome of thoſe hearts in which it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed. I was not condemned in my youth to ſolitude, either by indigence or deformity, nor paſſed the earlier part of life without the flattery of courtſhip, and the joys of triumph. I have danced the round of gaiety amidſt the murmurs of envy, and gratulations of applauſe; been attended from pleaſure to pleaſure by the great, the ſprightly, and the vain; and ſeen my regard ſolicited by the obſequiouſneſs of gallantry, the gaiety of wit, and the timi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of love. If, therefore, I am yet a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to nuptial happineſs, I ſuffer only the conſequences of my own reſolves, and can
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:1098200104:170"/>
look back upon the ſucceſſion of lovers whoſe addreſſes I have rejected, without grief and without malice.</p>
                     <p>WHEN my name firſt began to be inſcribed upon glaſſes, I was honoured with the amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous profeſſions of the gay <hi>Venuſtulus,</hi> a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who, being the only ſon of a wealthy family, had been educated in all the wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of expence, and ſoftneſs of effeminacy. He was beautiful in his perſon, and eaſy in his addreſs, and, therefore, ſoon gained upon my eye at an age when the ſight is very little over-ruled by the underſtanding. He had not any power in himſelf of gladdening or amuſing; but ſupplied his want of converſation by treats and diverſions; and his chief art of courtſhip was to fill the mind of his miſtreſs with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, rambles, muſick, and ſhews. We were often engaged in ſhort excurſions to gardens and ſeats, and I was for a while pleaſed with the care which <hi>Venuſtulus</hi> diſcovered in ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring me from any appearance of danger or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of miſchance. He never failed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend caution to his coachman, or to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe the waterman a reward if he landed us ſafe; and always contrived to return by day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:1098200104:171"/>
for fear of robbers. This extraordinary ſolicitude was repreſented for a time as the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of his tenderneſs for me, but fear is too ſtrong for continued hypocriſy. I ſoon diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, that <hi>Venuſtulus</hi> had the cowardice as well as elegance of a female. His imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was perpetually clouded with terrors, and he could ſcarcely refrain from ſcreams and outcries at any accidental ſurprize. He durſt not enter a room if a rat was heard behind the wainſcoat, nor croſs a field where the cattle were friſking in the ſunſhine; the leaſt breeze that waved upon the river was a ſtorm, and every clamour in the ſtreet was a cry of fire. I have ſeen him loſe his colour when my ſquirrel had broke his chain; and was forced to throw water in his face on the ſudden entrance of a black cat. Compaſſion once obliged me to drive away with my fan, a beetle that kept him in diſtreſs, and chide off a dog that yelped at his heels, to which he would gladly have given up me to facilitate his own eſcape. Women naturally expect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and protection from a lover or a huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and therefore you will not think me culpable in refuſing a wretch, who would have burdened life with unneceſſary fears,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:1098200104:172"/>
and flown to me for that ſuccour which it was his duty to have given.</p>
                     <p>MY next lover was <hi>Fungoſo,</hi> the ſon of a ſtockjobber, whoſe viſits my friends, by the importunity of perſuaſion, prevailed upon me to allow. <hi>Fungoſo</hi> was no very ſuitable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion; for, having been bred in a counting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, he ſpoke a language unintelligible in any other place. He had no deſire of any reputation, but that of an acute prognoſtica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the changes in the funds; nor had any means of raiſing merriment, but by telling how ſomebody was over-reached in a bargain by his father. He was, however, a youth of great ſobriety and prudence, and frequently inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us how carefully he would improve my fortune. I was not in haſte to conclude the match, but was ſo much awed by my parents, that I durſt not diſmiſs him, and might, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, have been doomed for ever to the groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of pedlary, and the jargon of uſury, had not a fraud been diſcovered in the ſettlement, which ſet me free from the perſecution of groveling pride, and pecuniary impudence.</p>
                     <p>I WAS afterwards ſix months without any
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:1098200104:173"/>
particular notice, but at laſt became the idol of the glittering <hi>Floſculus,</hi> who preſcribed the mode of embroidery to all the fops of his time, and varied at pleaſure the cock of every hat, and the ſleeve of every coat, that appeared in faſhionable aſſemblies. <hi>Floſculus</hi> made ſome impreſſion upon my heart by a compliment which few ladies can hear without emotion; he commended my ſkill in dreſs, my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ſuiting colours, and my art in diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ornaments. But <hi>Floſculus</hi> was too much engaged by his own elegance, to be ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attentive to the duties of a lover, or to pleaſe with varied praiſe an ear made delicate by riot of adulation. He expected to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid part of his tribute, and ſtaid away three days, becauſe I neglected to take notice of a new coat. I quickly found, that <hi>Floſculus</hi> was rather a rival than an admirer; and that we ſhould probably live in a perpetual ſtruggle of emulous finery, and ſpend our lives in ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems to be firſt in the faſhion.</p>
                     <p>I HAD ſoon after the honour at a feaſt of attracting the eyes of <hi>Dentatus,</hi> one of thoſe human beings whoſe only happineſs is to dine. <hi>Dentatus</hi> regaled me with foreign varieties,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:1098200104:174"/>
told me of meaſures that he had laid for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the beſt cook in <hi>France,</hi> and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me with bills of fare, preſcribed the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement of diſhes, and taught me two ſaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces invented by himſelf. At length, ſuch is the uncertainty of human happineſs, I declared my opinion too haſtily upon a pie made under his own direction; after which he grew ſo cold and negligent, that he was eaſily diſmiſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>MANY other lovers, or pretended lovers, I have had the honour to lead a while in triumph. But two of them I drove from me by diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, that they had no taſte or knowledge in muſick; three I diſmiſſed, becauſe they were drunkards; two, becauſe they paid their addreſſes at the ſame time to other ladies; and ſix, becauſe they attempted to influence my choice, by bribing my maid. Two more I diſcarded at the ſecond viſit, for obſcene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions; and five for drollery on religion. In the latter part of my reign, I ſentenced two to perpetual exile, for offering me ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by which the children of a former marriage would have been injured; four, for repreſenting falſly the value of their eſtates;
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:1098200104:175"/>
three, for concealing their debts; and one, for raiſing the rent of a decrepit tenant.</p>
                     <p>I have now ſent you a narrative, which the ladies may oppoſe to the tale of <hi>Hymenaeus.</hi> I mean not to depreciate the ſex, which has produced poets and philoſophers, heroes and martyrs; but will not ſuffer the riſing gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of beauties to be dejected by partial ſatire; or to imagine, that thoſe who cenſure them, have not likewiſe their follies, and their vices. I do not yet believe happineſs unattainable in marriage though I have never yet been able to find a man, with whom I could prudently venture an inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble union. It is neceſſary to expoſe faults, that their deformity may be ſeen; but the reproach ought not to be extended beyond the crime, nor either ſex to be condemned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome women, or men, are indelicate, or diſhoneſt.</p>

               <p>IN the reign of <hi>Jenghiz Can,</hi> conqueror of the eaſt, in the city of <hi>Samarcand,</hi> lived <hi>Nouradin</hi> the merchant, renowned through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the regions of <hi>India</hi> for the extent of his commerce, and the integrity of his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. His warehouſes were filled with all the commodities of the remoteſt nations; every rarity of nature, every curioſity of art, whatever was valuable, whatever was uſeful, haſted to his hand. The ſtreets were croud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his carriages; the ſea was covered with his ſhips; the ſtreams of <hi>Oxus</hi> were wearied with conveyance, and every breeze of the ſky waſted wealth to <hi>Nouradin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:1098200104:177"/>
AT length <hi>Nouradin</hi> felt himſelf ſeized with a ſlow malady, which he firſt endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to divert by application, and afterwards to relieve by luxury and indulgence; but finding his ſtrength every day leſs, he was at laſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, and called for help upon the ſages of phyſick; they filled his apartments with alexipharmicks, reſtoratives, and eſſential vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; the pearls of the ocean were diſſolved, the ſpices of <hi>Arabia</hi> were diſtilled, and all the powers of nature were employed, to give new ſpirits to his nerves, and new balſam to his blood. <hi>Nouradin</hi> was for ſome time amuſed with promiſes, invigorated with cordials, or ſoothed with anodynes; but the diſeaſe prey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon his vitals, and he ſoon diſcovered with indignation, that health was not to be bought. He was confined to his chamber, deſerted by his phyſicians, and rarely viſited by his friends; but his unwillingneſs to die flattered him long with hopes of life.</p>
               <p>AT length, having paſſed the night in te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious languor, he called to him <hi>Almamoulin,</hi> his only ſon; and, diſmiſſing his attendants, "My ſon," ſays he, "behold here the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:1098200104:178"/>
weakneſs and fragility of man; look back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a few days, thy father was great and happy, freſh as the vernal roſe, and ſtrong as the cedar of the mountain; the nations of <hi>Aſia</hi> drank his dews, and art and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce delighted in his ſhade. Malevolence beheld me, and ſighed: His root, ſhe cried, is fixed in the depths; it is watered by the fountains of <hi>Oxus</hi>; it ſends out branches afar, and bids defiance to the blaſt; pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence reclines againſt his trunk, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity dances on his top. Now, <hi>Almamou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> look upon me withering and proſtrate; look upon me, and attend. I have traffick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I have proſpered, I have rioted in gain; my houſe is ſplendid, my ſervants are nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous; yet I diſplayed only a ſmall part of my riches; the reſt, which I was hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered from enjoying by the fear of raiſing envy, or tempting rapacity, I have piled in towers, I have buried in caverns, I have hidden in ſecret repoſitories, which this ſcroll will diſcover. My purpoſe was, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ten months more ſpent in commerce, to have withdrawn my wealth to a ſafer country; to have given ſeven years to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and feſtivity, and the remaining part
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:1098200104:179"/>
of my days to ſolitude and repentance; but the hand of death is upon me; a frigori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick torpor encroaches upon my veins; I am now leaving the produce of my toil, which it muſt be thy buſineſs to enjoy with wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom." The thought of leaving his wealth filled <hi>Nouradin</hi> with ſuch grief, that he fell into convulſions, became delirious, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired.</p>
               <p>ALMAMOULIN, who loved his father, was touched a while with honeſt ſorrow, and ſat two hours in profound meditation, without peruſing the paper which he held in his hand. He then retired to his own chamber, as over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born with affliction, and there read the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventory of his new poſſeſſions, which ſwelled his heart with ſuch tranſports, that he no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger lamented his father's death. He was now ſufficiently compoſed to order a funeral of modeſt magnificence, ſuitable at once to the rank of <hi>Nouradin</hi>'s profeſſion, and the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his wealth. The two next nights he ſpent in viſiting the tower and the caverns, and found the treaſures greater to his eye than to his imagination.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:1098200104:180"/>
ALMAMOULIN had been bred to the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of exact frugality, and had often looked with envy on the finery and expences of other young men: he therefore believed, that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs was now in his power, ſince he could obtain all of which he had hitherto been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to regret the want. He reſolved to give a looſe to his deſires, to revel in enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and feel pain or uneaſineſs no more.</p>
               <p>HE immediately procured a ſplendid equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, dreſſed his ſervants in rich embroidery, and covered his horſes with golden capariſons. He ſhowered down ſilver on the populace, and ſuffered their acclamations to ſwell him with inſolence. The nobles ſaw him with anger, the wiſe men of the ſtate combined againſt him, the leaders of armies threatened his deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Almamoulin</hi> was informed of his danger: he put on the robe of mourning in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his enemies, and appeaſed them with gold, and gems, and ſupplication.</p>
               <p>HE then ſought to ſtrengthen himſelf, by an alliance with the princes of <hi>Tartary,</hi> and offered the price of kingdoms, for a wife of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:1098200104:181"/>
noble birth. His ſuit was generally rejected, and his preſents refuſed; but a princeſs of <hi>Aſtracan</hi> once condeſcended to admit him to her preſence. She received him ſitting on a throne, attired in the robe of royalty, and ſhining with the jewels of <hi>Golconda</hi>; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ſparkled in her eyes, and dignity tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered on her forehead. <hi>Almamoulin</hi> approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and trembled. She ſaw his confuſion, and diſdained him: How, ſays ſhe, dares the wretch hope my obedience, who thus ſhrinks at my glance? Retire, and enjoy thy riches in forbid oſtentation; thou waſt born to be wealthy, but never canſt be great.</p>
               <p>HE then contracted his deſires to more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and domeſtick pleaſures. He built pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces, he laid out gardens, he changed the face of the land, he tranſplanted foreſts, he levelled mountains, opened proſpects into diſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, poured fountains from the tops of tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets, and rolled rivers through new chanels.</p>
               <p>THESE amuſements pleaſed him for a time; but languor and wearineſs ſoon invaded him. His bowers loſt their fragrance, and the waters murmured without notice. He purchaſed
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:1098200104:182"/>
large tracts of land in diſtant provinces, adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with houſes of pleaſure, and diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied them with accommodations for different ſeaſons. Change of place at firſt relieved his ſatiety, but all the novelties of ſituation were ſoon exhauſted; he found his heart vacant, and his deſires, for want of external objects, ravaging himſelf.</p>
               <p>HE therefore returned to <hi>Samarcand,</hi> and ſet open his doors to thoſe whom idleneſs ſends out in ſearch of pleaſure. His tables were always covered with delicacies; wines of every vintage ſparkled in his bowls, and his lamps ſcattered perfumes. The ſound of the lute, and the voice of the ſinger, chaſed away ſadneſs; every hour was crouded with pleaſure; and the day ended and began with feaſts and dances, and revelry and merriment. <hi>Almamoulin</hi> cried out, "I have at laſt found the uſe of riches; I am ſurrounded by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, who view my greatneſs without envy; and I enjoy at once the raptures of popularity, and the ſafety of an obſcure ſtation. What trouble can he feel, whom all are ſtudious to pleaſe, that they may be
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:1098200104:183"/>
repaid with pleaſure? What danger can he dread, to whom every man is a friend?"</p>
               <p>SUCH were the thoughts of <hi>Almamoulin,</hi> as he looked down from a gallery upon the gay aſſembly, regaling at his expence; but in the midſt of this ſoliloquy, an officer of juſtice en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the houſe, and, in the form of legal cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſummoned <hi>Almamoulin</hi> to appear before the emperor. The gueſts ſtood a while aghaſt, then ſtole imperceptible away, and he was led off without a ſingle voice to witneſs his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity. He now found one of his moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent viſitants, accuſing him of treaſon in hopes of ſharing his confiſcation; yet, unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronized and unſupported, he cleared himſelf by the openneſs of innocence, and the conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of truth; he was diſmiſſed with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and his accuſer periſhed in priſon.</p>
               <p>ALMAMOULIN now perceived with how little reaſon he had hoped for juſtice or fidelity from thoſe who live only to gratify their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and, being now weary with vain experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon life and fruitleſs ſearches after felicity, he had recourſe to a ſage, who, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpending his youth in travel and obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:1098200104:184"/>
had retired from all human cares, to a ſmall habitation on the banks of <hi>Oxus,</hi> where he converſed only with ſuch as ſolicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his counſel. "Brother," ſaid the philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, "thou haſt ſuffered thy reaſon to be deluded by idle hopes, and fallacious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances. Having long looked with deſire upon riches, thou hadſt taught thyſelf to think them more valuable than nature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned them, and to expect from them, what experience has now taught thee, that they cannot give. That they do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer wiſdom, thou mayſt be convinced, by conſidering at how dear a price they tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee, upon thy firſt entrance into the world, to purchaſe the empty ſound of vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar acclamation. That they cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow fortitude or magnanimity, that man may be certain, who ſtood trembling at <hi>Aſtracan,</hi> before a being not naturally ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to himſelf. That they will not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply unexhauſted pleaſure, the recollection of forſaken palaces, and neglected gardens, will eaſily inform thee. That they rarely purchaſe friends, thou didſt ſoon diſcover, when thou wert left to ſtand thy tryal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenanced and alone. Yet think not
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:1098200104:185"/>
riches uſeleſs; there are purpoſes, to which a wiſe man may be delighted to apply them; they may, by a rational diſtribution to thoſe who want them, eaſe the pains of helpleſs diſeaſe, ſtill the throbs of reſtleſs anxiety, relieve innocence from oppreſſion, and raiſe imbecillity to chearfulneſs and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour. This they will enable thee to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, and this will afford the only happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ordained for our preſent ſtate, the confidence of divine favour, and the hope of future rewards."</p>

               <p>I Have been informed by a letter, from one of the univerſities, that among the youth from whom the next ſwarm of reaſoners is to learn philoſophy, and the next flight of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to hear elegies and ſonnets, there are many, who, inſtead of endeavouring by books and meditation to form their own opinions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves with the ſecondary know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which a convenient bench in a coffee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe can ſupply; and, without any examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or diſtinction, adopt the criticiſms and remarks, which happen to drop from thoſe, who have riſen, by merit or fortune, to repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and authority.</p>
               <p>THESE humble retailers of knowledge my correſpondent ſtigmatizes with the name of <hi>Echoes</hi>; and ſeems deſirous, that they ſhould
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:1098200104:187"/>
be made aſhamed of lazy ſubmiſſion, and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated to attempts after new diſcoveries, and original ſentiments.</p>
               <p>IT is very natural for young men to be vehement, acrimonious, and ſevere. For, as they ſeldom comprehend at once all the conſequences of a poſition, or perceive the difficulties by which cooler and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced reaſoners are reſtrained from confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, they form their concluſions with great precipitance; as they ſee nothing that can darken or embarraſs the queſtion, they expect to find their own opinion univerſally preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and are inclined to impute uncertainty and heſitation to want of honeſty, rather than of knowledge. I may, perhaps, therefore be reproached by my lively correſpondent, when it ſhall be found, that I have no inclination to perſecute theſe collectors of fortuitous knowledge with the ſeverity required; yet, as I am now too old to be much terrified or pained by haſty cenſure, I ſhall not be afraid of taking into protection thoſe whom I think condemned without a ſufficient knowledge of their cauſe.</p>
               <p>

HE that adopts the ſentiments of another, whom he has reaſon to believe wiſer than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, is only to be blamed, when he claims the honours which are not due but to the author, and endeavours to deceive the world into praiſe and veneration. For, to learn, is the proper buſineſs of youth; and whether we encreaſe our knowledge by books, or by converſation, we are equally indebted to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>THE greater part of ſtudents are not born with abilities, to conſtruct ſyſtems, or advance knowledge; nor can have any hope beyond that of becoming intelligent hearers in the ſchools of art, of being able to comprehend what others diſcover, and to remember what others teach. Even thoſe to whom Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has allotted greater ſtrength of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, can expect only to improve a ſingle ſcience. In every other part of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they muſt be content to follow opinions, which they are not able to examine; and, even in that which they claim as peculiarly their own, can ſeldom add more than ſome ſmall particle of knowledge, to the hereditary
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:1098200104:189"/>
ſtock devolved to them from ancient times, the collective labour of a thouſand intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects.</p>
               <p>IN ſcience, which being fixed and limited, admits of no other variety than ſuch as ariſes from new methods of diſtribution, or new arts of illuſtration, the neceſſity of following the traces of our predeceſſors is indiſputably evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; but there appears no reaſon, why ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination ſhould be ſubject to the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint. It might be conceived, that of thoſe who profeſs to forſake the narrow paths of truth every one may deviate towards a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent point, ſince though rectitude is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and fixed, obliquity may be infinitely diverſified. The fields of ſcience are narrow, ſo that they who travel them, muſt either follow or meet one another; but in the boundleſs regions of poſſibility, which fiction claims for her dominion, there are ſurely a thouſand receſſes unexplored, a thouſand flowers unplucked, a thouſand fountains unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, combinations of imagery yet unob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and races of ideal inhabitants not hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto deſcribed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:1098200104:190"/>
YET, whatever hope may perſuade, or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon evince, experience can boaſt of very few additions to ancient fable. The wars of <hi>Troy,</hi> and the travels of <hi>Ulyſſes,</hi> have furniſhed almoſt all ſucceeding poets with incidents, chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters, and ſentiments. The <hi>Romans</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to have attempted little more than to diſplay in their own tongue the inventions of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> There is, in all their writings, ſuch a perpetual recurrence of alluſions to the tales of the fabulous age, that they muſt be confeſſed often to want that power of giving pleaſure which novelty ſupplies; nor can we wonder, that they excelled ſo much in the graces of diction, when we conſider how rarely they were employed in ſearch of new thoughts.</p>
               <p>THE warmeſt admirers of the great <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuan</hi> poet can extol him for little more than the ſkill with which he has, by making his hero both a traveller and a warrior, united the beauties of the <hi>Iliad</hi> and <hi>Odyſſey</hi> in one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition: yet his judgment was perhaps ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times overborn by his avarice of the <hi>Homeric</hi> treaſures; and, for fear of ſuffering a ſparkling
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:1098200104:191"/>
ornament to be loſt, he has inſerted it where it cannot ſhine with its original ſplendor.</p>
               <p>WHEN <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> viſited the infernal regions, he found, that among the heroes that periſhed at <hi>Troy,</hi> his competitor <hi>Ajax,</hi> who, when the arms of <hi>Achilles</hi> were adjudged to <hi>Ulyſſes,</hi> died by his own hand in the madneſs of diſappointment. He ſtill appeared to reſent, as on earth, his loſs and diſgrace. <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> endeavoured to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify him with praiſes and ſubmiſſion; but <hi>Ajax</hi> walked away without reply. This paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage has always been conſidered as eminently beautiful; becauſe <hi>Ajax</hi> the haughty chief, the unlettered ſoldier, of unſhaken courage, of immoveable conſtancy, but without the power of recommending his own virtues by eloquence, or enforcing his aſſertions by any other argument than the ſword, had no way of making his anger known, but by gloomy ſullenneſs, and dumb ferocity. His hatred of a man whom he conceived to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated him only by volubility of tongue, was therefore naturally ſhewn by ſilence more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous and piercing than any words that ſo rude an orator could have found, and by which
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:1098200104:192"/>
he gave his enemy no opportunity of exerting the only power in which he was ſuperior.</p>
               <p>WHEN <hi>Aeneas</hi> is ſent by <hi>Virgil</hi> to viſit the ſhades, he meets with <hi>Dido</hi> the queen of <hi>Carthage</hi> whom his perfidy had hurried to the grave; he accoſts her with tenderneſs and excuſes; but the lady turns away like <hi>Ajax</hi> in mute diſdain. She turns away like <hi>Ajax,</hi> but ſhe reſembles him in none of thoſe quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which give either dignity or propriety to ſilence. She might, without any departure from the tenour of her conduct, have burſt out like other injured women into clamour, reproach, and denunciation; but <hi>Virgil</hi> had his imagination full of <hi>Ajax,</hi> and therefore could not prevail on himſelf to teach <hi>Dido</hi> any other mode of reſentment.</p>
               <p>IF <hi>Virgil</hi> could be thus ſeduced by imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there will be little hope, that common wits ſhould eſcape; and accordingly we find, that beſides the univerſal and acknowledged practice of copying the ancients, there has prevailed in every age a particular ſpecies of fiction. At one time all truth was conveyed in allegory; at another, nothing was ſeen but
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:1098200104:193"/>
in a viſion; at one period, all the poets fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed ſheep, and every event produced a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toral; at another they buſied themſelves wholly in giving directions to a painter.</p>
               <p>IT is indeed eaſy to conceive why any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion ſhould become popular, by which idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is favoured, and imbecillity aſſiſted; but ſurely no man of genius can much applaud himſelf for repeating a tale with which the audience is already tired, and which could bring no honour to any but its inventor.</p>
               <p>THERE are, I think, two ſchemes of writing, on which the laborious wits of the preſent time employ their faculties. One is the adaptation of ſenſe to all the rhymes which our language can ſupply to ſome word, that makes the burden of the ſtanza; but this, as it has been only uſed in a kind of amorous burleſque, can ſcarcely be cenſured with much acrimony. The other is the imitation of <hi>Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer,</hi> which, by the influence of ſome men of learning and genius, ſeems likely to gain upon the age, and therefore deſerves to be more attentively conſidered.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:1098200104:194"/>
TO imitate the fictions and ſentiments of <hi>Spenſer</hi> can incur no reproach, for allegory is perhaps one of the moſt pleaſing vehicles of inſtruction. But I am very far from extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame reſpect to his diction or his ſtanza. His ſtile was in his own time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be vicious, ſo darkened with old words and peculiarities of phraſe, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from common uſe, that <hi>Johnſon</hi> boldly pronounces him to have written no language. His ſtanza is at once difficult and unpleaſing; tireſome to the ear by its uniformity, and to the attention by its length. It was at firſt form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in imitation of the <hi>Italian</hi> poets, without due regard to the genius of our language. The <hi>Italians</hi> have ſo little variety of termination, that they were forced to contrive ſuch a ſtanza as might admit the greateſt number of ſimilar rhymes; but our words end with ſo much diverſity, that it is ſeldom convenient for us to bring more than two of the ſame ſound together. If it be juſtly obſerved by <hi>Milton,</hi> that rhyme obliges poets to expreſs their thoughts in improper terms, theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proprieties muſt always be multiplied, as the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:1098200104:195"/>
difficulty of rhyme is encreaſed by long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catenations.</p>
               <p>THE imitators of <hi>Spenſer</hi> are indeed not very rigid cenſors of themſelves, for they ſeem to conclude, that when they have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured their lines with a few obſolete ſyllables, they have accompliſhed their deſign, without conſidering that they ought not only to admit words, but to avoid new. The laws of imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation are broken by every word introduced ſince the time of <hi>Spenſer,</hi> as the character of <hi>Hector</hi> is violated by quoting <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the play. It would indeed be difficult to exclude from a long poem all modern phraſes, though it is eaſy to ſprinkle it with gleanings of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity. Perhaps, however, the ſtile of <hi>Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer</hi> might by long labour be juſtly copied; but life is ſurely given us for higher purpoſes than to gather what our anceſtors have wiſely thrown away, and to learn what is of no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, but becauſe it has been forgotten.</p>

               <p>NOTHING is more ſubject to miſtake and diſappointment than an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipated judgment concerning the eaſineſs or difficulty of any undertaking, whether we form our opinion from the performances of others, or from abſtracted contemplation of the thing to be attempted.</p>
               <p>WHATEVER is done ſkilfully appears to be done with eaſe; and art, when it is once matured to habit, vaniſhes from obſervation. We are therefore more powerfully excited to emulation, by thoſe who have attained the higheſt degree of excellence, and whom we can therefore with leaſt reaſon hope to equal.</p>
               <p>IN adjuſting the probability of ſucceſs by a previous conſideration of the undertaking, we
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:1098200104:197"/>
are equally in danger of deceiving ourſelves. It is never eaſy, nor often poſſible, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe the ſeries of any proceſs, with all its cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, incidents, and variations, in a ſpeculative ſcheme. Experience ſoon ſhews us the tortuoſities of imaginary rectitude, the complications of ſimplicity, and the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perities of ſmoothneſs. Sudden difficulties often ſtart up from the ambuſhes of art, ſtop the career of activity, repreſs the gaiety of confidence, and when we imagine ourſelves almoſt at the end of our labours, drive us back to new plans and different meaſures.</p>
               <p>THERE are many things which we every day ſee others unable to perform, and perhaps have even ourſelves miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried in attempting; and yet can hardly allow to be difficult; nor can we forbear to wonder afreſh at every new failure, or to promiſe certainty of ſucceſs to our next eſſay; but when we try, the ſame hindrances recur, the ſame inability is perceived, and the vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of diſappointment muſt again be ſuffered.</p>
               <p>OF the various kinds of ſpeaking or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which ſerve neceſſity, or promote plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:1098200104:198"/>
none appears ſo artleſs or eaſy as ſimple narration; for what ſhould make him that knows the whole order and progreſs of an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair unable to relate it? Yet we hourly find ſuch as endeavour to entertain or inſtruct us by recitals, clouding the facts which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to illuſtrate, and loſing themſelves and their auditors in wilds and mazes, in digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and confuſion. When we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulated ourſelves upon a new opportunity of enquiry, and new means of information; it often happens, that without deſigning either deceit or concealment, without ignorance of the fact, or unwillingneſs to diſcloſe it, the relator fills the ear with empty ſounds, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſes the attention with fruitleſs impatience, and diſturbs the imagination by a tumult of events, without order of time, or train of conſequence.</p>
               <p>IT is natural to believe upon the ſame principle, that no writer has a more eaſy taſk than the hiſtorian. The philoſopher has the works of omniſcience to examine; and is therefore engaged in diſquiſitions, to which finite intellects are utterly unequal. The poet truſts to his invention, and is not only in
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:1098200104:199"/>
danger of thoſe inconſiſtencies, to which every one is expoſed by departure from truth; but may be cenſured as well for defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies of matter, as for irregularity of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, or impropriety of ornament. But the happy hiſtorian has no other labour than of gathering what tradition pours down before him, or records treaſure for his uſe. He has only the actions and deſigns of men like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to conceive and to relate; he is not to form, but copy characters, and therefore is not blamed for the inconſiſtency of ſtateſmen, the injuſtice of tyrants, or the cowardice of commanders. The difficulty of making va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety conſiſtent, or uniting probability with ſurprize, needs not to diſtrub him; the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and actions of his perſonages are already fixed; his materials are provided and put into his hands, and he is at leiſure to employ all his powers in arranging and diſplaying them.</p>
               <p>YET, even with theſe advantages, very few in any age have been able to raiſe themſelves to reputation by writing hiſtories; and among the innumerable authors, who fill every na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with accounts of their anceſtors, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to ttanſmit to futurity the events of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:1098200104:200"/>
their own time, the greater part, when faſhion and novelty have ceaſed to recommend them, are of no other uſe than chronological me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials, which neceſſity may ſometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire to be conſulted, but which fright away curioſity, and diſguſt delicacy.</p>
               <p>IT has been obſerved, that our nation, which has produced ſo many authors eminent for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every other ſpecies of literary excellence, has been hitherto remarkably barren of hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical genius; and ſo far has this defect raiſed prejudices againſt us, that ſome have doubted, whether an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> can ſtop at that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diocrity of ſtile, or confine his mind to that even tenour of imagination, which narrative requires.</p>
               <p>THEY who can believe that nature has ſo capriciouſly diſtributed underſtanding, have ſurely no claim to the honour of ſerious conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. The inhabitants of the ſame country have oppoſite characters in different ages; the prevalence or neglect of any particular ſtudy can proceed only from the accidental influence of ſome temporary cauſe; and if we have fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in hiſtory, we can have failed only becauſe
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:1098200104:201"/>
hiſtory has not hitherto been diligently cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated.</p>
               <p>BUT how is it evident, that we have not hiſtorians among us, whom we may venture to place in compariſon with any that the neighbouring nations can produce? The at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of <hi>Raleigh</hi> is deſervedly celebrated for the labour of his reſearches, and the elegance of his ſtile; but he has endeavoured to exert his judgment more than his genius, to ſelect facts, rather than adorn them; and has produced an hiſtorical diſſertation, but ſeldom riſen to the majeſty of hiſtory.</p>
               <p>THE work of <hi>Clarendon</hi> deſerves more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard. His diction is indeed neither exact in itſelf, nor ſuited to the purpoſe of hiſtory. It is the effuſion of a mind crouded with ideas, and deſirous of imparting them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore always accumulating words, and involv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one clauſe and ſentence in another. But there is dignity in his negligence, a rude in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>artificial majeſty, which, without the nicety of laboured elegance, ſwells the mind by its plenitude and diffuſion. His narration is not perhaps ſufficiently rapid, being ſtopped
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:1098200104:202"/>
too frequently by particularities, which, though they might ſtrike the author who was preſent at the tranſactions, will not equally detain the attention of poſterity. But his ignorance or careleſneſs of the art of writing are amply compenſated by his knowledge of nature and of policy; the wiſdom of his maxims, the juſtneſs of his reaſonings, and the variety, diſtinctneſs, and ſtrength of his characters.</p>
               <p>BUT none of our writers can, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, juſtly conteſt the ſuperiority of <hi>Knolles,</hi> who, in his hiſtory of the <hi>Turks,</hi> has diſplayed all the excellencies that narration can admit. His ſtile, though ſomewhat obſcured by time, and ſometimes vitiated by falſe wit, is pure, nervous, elevated, and clear. A wonderful multiplicity of events is ſo artfully arranged, and ſo diſtinctly explained, that each facilitates the knowledge of the next. Whenever a new perſonage is introduced, the reader is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by his character for his actions; when a nation is firſt attacked, or city beſieged, he is made acquainted with its hiſtory, or ſituation; ſo that a great part of the world is brought under his view. The deſcriptions of this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor are without minuteneſs, and the digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:1098200104:203"/>
without oſtentation. Collateral events are ſo artfully woven into the contexture of his principal ſtory, that they cannot be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined, without leaving it lacerated and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. There is nothing turgid in his dignity, nor ſuperfluous in his copiouſneſs. His ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions only, which he feigns, like the ancient hiſtorians, to have been pronounced on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable occaſions, are tedious and languid; and ſince they are merely the voluntary ſports of imagination, prove how much the moſt ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious and ſkilful may be miſtaken, in the eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of their own powers.</p>
               <p>NOTHING could have ſunk this author in obſcurity, but the remoteneſs and barbarity of the people, whoſe ſtory he relates. It ſeldom happens, that all circumſtances concur to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs or fame. The nation, which produced this great hiſtorian, has the grief of ſeeing his genius employed upon a foreign and uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting ſubject; and that writer, who might have ſecured perpetuity to his name, by a hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of his own country, has expoſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the danger of oblivion, by recounting enterprizes and revolutions, of which none deſire to be informed.</p>

                     <p>THOUGH I have ſo long found my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf deluded by projects of honour and diſtinction, that I often reſolve to admit them no more into my heart; yet how determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately ſoever excluded, they always recover their dominion by force or ſtratagem; and whenever, after the ſhorteſt relaxation of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilance, reaſon and caution return to their charge, they find hope again in poſſeſſion, with all her train of pleaſures dancing about her.</p>
                     <p>EVEN while I am preparing to write a hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of diſappointed expectations; I cannot forbear to flatter myſelf, that you and your

readers are impatient for my performance; and that the ſons of learning have laid down ſeveral of your late papers with diſcontent, when they found that <hi>Miſocapelus</hi> had delayed to continue his narrative.</p>
                     <p>BUT the deſire of gratifying the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that I have raiſed, is not the only mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of this relation, which, having once pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed it, I think myſelf no longer at liberty to forbear. For however I may have wiſhed to clear myſelf from every other adheſion of trade, I hope I ſhall be always wiſe enough to retain my punctuality, and amidſt all my new arts of politeneſs, continue to deſpiſe negligence, and deteſt falſhood.</p>
                     <p>WHEN the death of my brother had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed me from the duties of a ſhop, I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered myſelf as reſtored to the rights of my birth, and entitled to the rank and reception, which my anceſtors obtained. I was, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, embarraſſed with many difficulties at my firſt re-entrance into the world; for my haſte to be a gentleman inclined me to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate meaſures; and every accident that forced me back towards my old ſtation, was
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:1098200104:206"/>
conſidered by me, as an obſtruction of my happineſs.</p>
                     <p>IT was no common grief and indignation, that I found my former companions ſtill da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to claim my notice, and the journeymen and apprentices ſometimes pulling me by the ſleeve as I was walking the ſtreet; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any terror of my new ſword, which was, notwithſtanding, of an uncommon ſize, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting me to partake of a bottle at the old houſe, and entertaining me with hiſtories of the girls in the neighbourhood. I had always, in my officinal ſtate, been kept in awe by lace and embroidery; and imagined that to fright away theſe unwelcome familiarities, nothing was neceſſary, but that I ſhould, by ſplendor of dreſs, proclaim my re-union with a higher rank. I therefore ſent for my taylor; ordered a ſuit with twice the uſual quantity of lace; and, that I might not let my perſecutors en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their confidence, by the habit of accoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, ſtaid at home till it was made.</p>
                     <p>THIS week of confinement I paſſed in practiſing a forbidding frown, a ſmile of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion, a ſlight ſalutation, and an abrupt
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:1098200104:207"/>
departure; and in four mornings was able to turn upon my heel, with ſo much levity and ſprightlineſs, that I made no doubt of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging all publick attempts upon my dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. I therefore iſſued forth in my new coat, with a reſolution of dazzling intimacy to a fitter diſtance; and pleaſed myſelf with the timidity and reverence, which I ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs upon all who had hitherto preſumed to haraſs me with their freedoms. But, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was the cauſe, I did not find myſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with any new degree of reſpect; thoſe whom I intended to drive from me, ventured to advance with their uſual phraſes of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence; and thoſe whoſe acquaintance I ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited, grew more ſupercilious and reſerved. I began ſoon to repent the expence, by which I had procured no advantage, and to ſuſpect, that a ſhining dreſs, like a weighty weapon, has no force in itſelf, but owes all its efficacy to him that wears it.</p>
                     <p>MANY were the mortifications and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, which I was condemned to ſuffer in my initiation to politeneſs. I was ſo much tortured by the inceſſant civilities of my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, that I never paſſed through that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:1098200104:208"/>
of the city but in a chair with the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains drawn; and at laſt left my lodgings, and fixed myſelf in the verge of the court. Here I endeavoured to be thought a gentleman juſt returned from his travels, and was pleaſed to have my landlord believe, that I was in ſome danger from importunate creditors; but this ſcheme was quickly defeated by a formal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation ſent to offer me, though I had now retired from buſineſs, the freedom of my company.</p>
                     <p>I WAS now detected in trade, and therefore reſolved to ſtay no longer. I hired another apartment, and changed my ſervants. Here I lived very happily for three months, and, with ſecret ſatisfaction, often overheard the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily celebrating the greatneſs and felicity of the eſquire; though the converſation ſeldom ended without ſome complaint of my covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, or ſome remark upon my language, or my gait. I now began to venture into the publick walks, and to know the faces of nobles and beauties; but could not obſerve, without wonder, as I paſſed by them, how frequently they were talking of a taylor. I longed, however, to be admitted to converſation, and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:1098200104:209"/>
was ſomewhat weary of walking in crouds without a companion, yet continued to come and go with the reſt, till a lady whom I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to protect in a crouded paſſage, as ſhe was about to ſtep into her chariot, thanked me for my civility, and told me, that, as ſhe had often diſtinguiſhed me for my modeſt and reſpectful behaviour, whenever I ſet up for myſelf, I might expect to ſee her among my firſt cuſtomers.</p>
                     <p>HERE was an end of all my ambulatory projects. I indeed ſometimes entered the walks again, but was always blaſted by this deſtructive lady, whoſe miſchievous genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity recommended me to her acquaintance. Being therefore forced to practiſe my adſciti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious character upon another ſtage, I betook myſelf to a coffee-houſe frequented by wits, among whom I learned in a ſhort time the cant of criticiſm, and talked ſo loudly and volubly of nature, and manners, and ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and diction, and ſimilies, and contraſts, and action, and pronunciation, that I was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten deſired to lead the hiſs and clap, and was feared and hated by the players and the poets. Many a ſentence have I hiſſed, which I did
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:1098200104:210"/>
not underſtand, and many a groan have I ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, when the ladies were weeping in the boxes. At laſt a malignant author, whoſe performance I had perſecuted through the nine nights, wrote an epigram upon <hi>Tape</hi> the critick, which drove me from the pit for ever.</p>
                     <p>MY deſire to be a fine gentleman ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued: I therefore, after a ſhort ſuſpenſe, choſe a new ſet of friends at the gaming table, and was for ſome time pleaſed with the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility and openneſs with which I found my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf treated. I was indeed obliged to play, but, being naturally timorous and vigilant, was never ſurpriſed into large ſums. What might have been the conſequence of long fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity with theſe plunderers, I had not an opportunity of knowing; for one night the conſtables entered and ſeized us, and I was once more compelled to ſink into my former condition, by ſending for my old maſter to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt my character.</p>
                     <p>WHEN I was deliberating to what new qualifications I ſhould aſpire, I was ſummoned
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:1098200104:211"/>
into the country, by an account of my father's death. Here I had hopes of being able to diſtinguiſh myſelf, and to ſupport the honour of my family. I therefore bought guns and horſes, and, contrary to the expectation of the tenants, encreaſed the ſalary of the huntſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. But when I entered the field, it was ſoon diſcovered, that I was not deſtined to the glories of the chace. I was afraid of thorns in the thicket, and of dirt in the marſh; I ſhivered on the brink of a river while the ſportſmen croſſed it, and trembled at the ſight of a five-bar gate. When the ſport and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger were over, I was ſtill equally diſconcerted; for I was effeminate, though not delicate, and could only join a feebly whiſpering voice in the clamours of their triumph.</p>
                     <p>A FALL, by which my ribs were broken, ſoon recalled me to domeſtick pleaſures, and I exerted all my art to obtain the favour of the neighbouring ladies; but where-ever I came, there was always ſome unlucky converſation upon ribbands, fillets, pins, or thread, which drove all my ſtock of compliments out of my memory, and overwhelmed me with ſhame and dejection.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="211" facs="tcp:1098200104:212"/>
THUS I paſſed the ten firſt years after the death of my brother, in which I have learned at laſt to repreſs that ambition, which I could never gratify; and, inſtead of waſting more of my life in vain endeavours after accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which, if not early acquired, no endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours can obtain, I ſhall confine my care to thoſe higher excellencies which are in every man's power; and though I cannot enchant affection by elegance and eaſe, hope to ſecure eſteem by honeſty and truth.</p>

               <p>THE ſeaſon of the year is now come in which the theatres are ſhut, and the card-tables forſaken; the regions of luxury are for a while unpeopled, and pleaſure leads out her votaries to groves and gardens, to ſtill ſcenes and erratick gratifications. Thoſe who have paſſed many months in a continual tumult of diverſion; who have never opened their eyes in the morning, but upon ſome new appointment; nor ſlept at night without a dream of dances, muſick, and good hands, or of ſoft ſighs, languiſhing looks, and humble ſupplications; muſt now retire to diſtant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, where the ſirens of flattery are ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be heard, where beauty ſparkles without praiſe or envy, and wit is repeated only by the echo.</p>

AS I think it one of the moſt important duties of ſocial benevolence to give warning of the approach of calamity when by timely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention it may be turned aſide, or by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory meaſures be more eaſily endured, I cannot feel the encreaſing warmth, or obſerve the lengthening days, without conſidering the condition of my fair readers, who are now preparing to leave all that has ſo long filled up their hours, all from which they have been accuſtomed to hope for delight; and who, till faſhion proclaims the liberty of returning to the ſeats of mirth and elegance, muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the rugged 'ſquire, the ſober houſewife, the loud huntſman, or the formal parſon, the roar of obſtreperous jollity, or the dulneſs of prudential inſtruction; without any retreat, but to the gloom of ſolitude, where they will yet find greater inconveniencies, and muſt learn, however unwillingly, to endure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>IN winter, the life of the polite and gay, may be ſaid to roll on with a ſtrong and rapid current; they float along from pleaſure to pleaſure, without the trouble of regulating
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:1098200104:215"/>
their own motions, and perſue the courſe of the ſtream in all the felicity of inattention; content that they find themſelves in progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and careleſs whither they are going. But the months of ſummer are a kind of ſleeping ſtagnation without wind or tide, where they are left to force themſelves for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by their own labour, and to direct their paſſage by their own ſkill; and where, if they have not ſome internal principle of activity, they muſt be ſtranded upon ſhallows, or lie torpid in a perpetual calm.</p>
               <p>THERE are, indeed, ſome to whom this univerſal diſſolution of gay ſocieties affords a welcome opportunity of quitting without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, the poſt which they have found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unable to maintain; and of ſeeming to retreat only at the call of nature, from aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies where, after a ſhort triumph of uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted ſuperiority, they are overpowered by ſome new intruder of ſofter elegance or ſprightlier vivacity. By theſe, hopeleſs of vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and yet aſhamed to confeſs a conqueſt, the ſummer is regarded as a releaſe from the fatiguing ſervice of celebrity, a diſmiſſion to more certain joys and a ſafer empire. They now
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:1098200104:216"/>
ſolace themſelves with the influence which they ſhall obtain, where they have no rival to fear; and with the luſtre which they ſhall effuſe, when nothing can be ſeen of brighter ſplendour. They image, while they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for their journey, the admiration with which the ruſticks will croud about them; plan the laws of a new aſſembly; or contrive to delude provincial ignorance with a fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious mode. A thouſand pleaſing expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſwarm in the fancy; and all the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching weeks are filled with diſtinctions, honours, and authority.</p>
               <p>BUT others, who have lately entered the world, or have yet had no proofs of its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy and deſertion, are cut off by this cruel interruption from the enjoyment of their prerogatives, and doomed to loſe four months in unactive obſcurity. Many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints do vexation and deſire extort from theſe exiled tyrants of the town, againſt the inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable ſun, who perſues his courſe without any regard to love or beauty; and viſits either tropick at the ſtated time, whether ſhunned or courted, deprecated or implored.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:1098200104:217"/>
TO them who leave the places of publick reſort in the full bloom of reputation, and withdraw from admiration, courtſhip; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and applauſe; a rural triumph can give nothing equivalent. The praiſe of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and the ſubjection of weakneſs, are little regarded by beauties who have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to more important conqueſts, and more valuable panegyricks. Nor indeed ſhould the powers which have made havock in the theatres, or borne down rivalry in courts, be degraded to a mean attack upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travelled heir, or ignoble conteſt with the ruddy milk-maid.</p>
               <p>HOW then muſt four long months be worn away? Four months, in which there will be no routes, no ſhews, no ridottos; in which viſits muſt be regulated by the weather, and aſſemblies will depend upon the moon! The Platoniſts imagine, that the future puniſhment of thoſe who have in this life debaſed their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by ſubjection to their ſenſes, and have preferred the groſs gratifications of lewdneſs and luxury, to the pure and ſublime felicity of virtue and contemplation, will ariſe from
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:1098200104:218"/>
the predominance and ſolicitations of the ſame appetites, in a ſtate which can furniſh no means of appeaſing them. I cannot but ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect that this month, bright with ſunſhine, and fragrant with perfumes; this month, which covers the meadow with verdure, and decks the gardens with all the mixtures of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorifick radiance; this month, from which the man of fancy expects new infuſions of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, and the naturaliſt new ſcenes of obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; this month will chain down multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes to the <hi>Platonick</hi> penance of deſire with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out enjoyment, and hurry them from the higheſt ſatisfactions, which they have yet learned to conceive, into a ſtate of hopeleſs wiſhes and pining recollection, where the eye of vanity will look round for admiration to no purpoſe, and the hand of avarice ſhuffle cards in a bower with ineffectual dexterity.</p>
               <p>FROM the tediouſneſs of this melancholy ſuſpenſion of life, I would willingly preſerve thoſe who are expoſed to it, only by inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; who want not inclination to wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or virtue, though they have been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipated by negligence, or miſled by example: and who would gladly find the way to rational
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:1098200104:219"/>
happineſs, though it ſhould be neceſſary to ſtruggle with habit, and abandon faſhion. To theſe many arts of ſpending time might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended, which would neither ſadden the preſent hour with wearineſs, nor the future with repentance.</p>
               <p>IT would ſeem impoſſible to a ſolitary ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culatiſt, that a human being can want em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. To be born in ignorance with a capacity of knowledge, and to be placed in the midſt of a world filled with variety, perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally preſſing upon the ſenſes and irritating cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, is ſurely a ſufficient ſecurity againſt the languiſhment of inattention. Novelty is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed neceſſary to preſerve eagerneſs and ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity; but art and nature have ſtores inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtible by human intellects; and every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment produces ſomething new to him, who has quickened his faculties by diligent obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>SOME ſtudies, for which the country and the ſummer afford peculiar opportunities, I ſhall perhaps endeavour to recommend in a future eſſay; but if there be any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion not apt to admit unaccuſtomed
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:1098200104:220"/>
ideas, or any attention ſo ſtubborn and infle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xible, as not eaſily to comply with new direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, even theſe obſtructions cannot exclude the pleaſure of application; for there is a higher and nobler employment, to which all faculties are adapted by him who gave them. The duties of religion, ſincerely and regularly performed, will always be ſufficient to exalt the meaneſt, and to exerciſe the higheſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. That mind will never be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, which is frequently recalled by ſtated duties to meditations on eternal intereſts; nor can any hour be long, which is ſpent in obtaining ſome new qualification for celeſtial happineſs.</p>

Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, a licentious and vagrant faculty, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſceptible of limitations, and impatient of reſtraint, has always endeavoured to baffle the logician, to perplex the conſines of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and burſt the incloſures of regularity, There is therefore ſcarcely any ſpecies of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, of which we can tell what is its eſſence, and what are its conſtituents; every new genius produces ſome innovation, which, when invented and approved, ſubverts the rules which the practice of foregoing authors had eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>COMEDY has been particularly unpropi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to definers; for though perhaps they might properly have contented themſelves, with declaring it to be <hi>ſuch a dramatic re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of human life, as may excite mirth,</hi> they have embarraſſed their definition with
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:1098200104:223"/>
the means by which the comic writers attain their end, without conſidering that the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious methods of exhilarating their audience, not being limited by nature, cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed in precept. Thus, ſome make comedy a repreſentation of mean, and others of bad men; ſome think that its eſſence conſiſts in the unimportance, others in the fictitiouſneſs, of the tranſaction. But any man's reflections will inform him, that every dramatic com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition which raiſes mirth is comic; and that, to raiſe mirth, it is by no means univerſally neceſſary, that the perſonages ſhould be either mean or corrupt, nor always requiſite, that the action ſhould be trivial, nor ever, that it ſhould be fictitious.</p>
               <p>IF the two kinds of dramatick poetry had been defined only by their effects upon the mind, ſome abſurdities might have been prevented, with which the compoſitions of our greateſt poets are diſgraced, who, for want of ſome ſettled ideas and accurate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions, have unhappily confounded tragic with comic ſentiments. They ſeem to have thought, that as the meanneſs of perſonages conſtituted comedy, their greatneſs was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:1098200104:224"/>
to form a tragedy; and that nothing was neceſſary to dignity and ſeriouſneſs, but that they ſhould croud the ſcene with mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, and generals, and guards; and make them talk, at certain intervals, of the downfal of kingdoms, and the rout of armies. They have not conſidered, that thoughts or inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in themſelves ridiculous, grow ſtill more groteſque by the ſolemnity of ſuch cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters; that reaſon and nature are uniform and inflexible; and that what is deſpicable and abſurd, will not, by any aſſociation with ſplendid titles, become rational or great; that the moſt important affairs, by an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of an unſeaſonable levity, may be made contemptible; and that the robes of royalty can give no protection to nonſenſe or to folly.</p>
               <p>"COMEDY," ſays <hi>Horace,</hi> "ſometimes raiſes her voice;" and tragedy may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe on proper occaſions abate her dignity; but as the comic perſonages can only depart from their familiarity of ſtile, when the more violent paſſions are put in motion, the heroes and queens of tragedy ſhould never deſcend to trifle, but in the hours of eaſe, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions

               <p>IN this ſcene, every circumſtance concurs to turn tragedy to farce. The wild abſurdity of the expedient; the contemptible ſubjection of the lover; the folly of obliging him to read the letter only becauſe it ought to have been concealed from him; the frequent interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of amorous impatience; the faint ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulations of a voluntary ſlave; the imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous haughtineſs of a tyrant without power; the deep reflection of the yielding rebel upon fate and free-will; and his wiſe wiſh to loſe his reaſon as ſoon as he finds himſelf about to do what he cannot perſuade his reaſon to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, are ſurely ſufficient to awaken the moſt torpid riſibility.</p>
               <p>THERE is ſcarce a tragedy of the laſt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:1098200104:230"/>
which has not debaſed its moſt important incidents, and polluted its moſt ſerious inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locutions with buffoonry and meanneſs; but though perhaps it cannot be pretended that the preſent age has added much to the force and efficacy of the drama, it has at leaſt been able to eſcape many faults, which either igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance had overlooked, or indulgence had licenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The later tragedies indeed have faults of another kind, perhaps more deſtructive to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, though leſs open to cenſure. That per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual tumor of phraſe with which every thought is now expreſſed by every perſonage, the paucity of adventures which regularity ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, and the unvaried equality of flowing dialogue, has taken away from our preſent writers almoſt all that dominion over the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which was the boaſt of their predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors. Yet they may at leaſt claim this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, that they avoid groſs faults, and that if they cannot often move terror or pity, they are always careful not to provoke laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

                              <p>AMONG other topicks of converſation which your papers ſupply, I was lately engaged in a diſcuſſion of the character given by <hi>Tranquilla</hi> of her lover <hi>Venuſtulus,</hi> whom, notwithſtanding the ſeverity of his miſtreſs, the greater number ſeemed inclined to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit of unmanly or culpable timidity.</p>
                              <p>ONE of the company remarked, that pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ought to be diſtinguiſhed from fear; and that if <hi>Venuſtulus</hi> was afraid of nocturnal adventures, no man who conſidered how much every avenue of the town was infeſted with robbers could think him blameable; for why ſhould life be hazarded without proſpect of
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:1098200104:232"/>
honour or advantage? Another was of opinion, that a brave man might be afraid of croſſing the river in the calmeſt weather; and declared, that, for his part, while there were coaches and a bridge, he would never be ſeen totter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a wooden caſe, out of which he might be thrown by any irregular agitation, or which might be overſet by accident, or negligence, or by the force of a ſudden guſt, or the ruſh of a larger veſſel. It was his cuſtom, he ſaid, to keep the ſecurity of day-light, and dry ground; for it was a maxim with him, that no wiſe man ever periſhed by water, or was loſt in the dark.</p>
                              <p>THE next was humbly of opinion, that if <hi>Tranquilla</hi> had ſeen, like him, the cattle run roaring about the meadows in the hot months, ſhe would not have thought meanly of her lover for not venturing his ſafety among them. His neighbour then told us, that for his part he was not aſhamed to confeſs, that he could not ſee a rat, though it was dead, without pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation; that he had been driven ſix times out of his lodging either by rats or mice; and that he always had a bed in the cloſet for his ſervants, whom he called up whenever the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:1098200104:233"/>
enemy was in motion. Another wondered that any man ſhould think himſelf diſgraced by a precipitate retreat from a dog; for there was always a poſſibility that a dog might be mad; and that ſurely, though there was no danger but of being bit by a fierce animal, there was more wiſdom in flight than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt. By all theſe declarations another was encouraged to confeſs, that if he had been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the honour of paying his addreſſes to <hi>Tranquilla,</hi> he ſhould have been likely to incur the ſame cenſure; for among all the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals upon which nature has impreſſed defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and horror, there was none whom he durſt not encounter rather than a beetle.</p>
                              <p>THUS, Sir, tho' cowardice is univerſally defined too cloſe and anxious an attention to perſonal ſafety, there will be found ſcarcely any fear, however exceſſive in its Degree, or unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable in its object, which will be allowed to characterize a coward. Fear is a paſſion which every man feels ſo frequently predominant in his own breaſt, that he is unwilling to hear it cenſured with great aſperity; and, perhaps, if we confeſs the truth, the ſame reſtraint which would hinder a man from declaiming
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:1098200104:234"/>
againſt the frauds of any employment among thoſe who profeſs it, ſhould with-hold him from treating fear with contempt among human be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
                              <p>YET ſince fortitude is one of thoſe virtues which the condition of our nature makes hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary, I think you cannot better direct your admonitions than againſt ſuperfluous and panick terrors. Fear is indeed implanted in us as a preſervative from evil; but its duty, like that of other paſſions, is not to overbear rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but to aſſiſt it; nor ſhould it be ſuffered to tyrannize in the imagination, to blind the diſcernment, or obſtruct activity, to raiſe phantoms of horror, or beſet life with ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerary diſtreſſes.</p>
                              <p>TO be always afraid of loſing life, is, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſcarcely to enjoy a life that can deſerve the care of preſervation. He that once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulges idle fears will never be at reſt. Our preſent ſtate admits only of a kind of nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſecurity; we muſt conclude ourſelves ſafe when we ſee no danger, or none inadequate to our powers of oppoſition. Death indeed continually hovers about us, but hovers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:1098200104:235"/>
unſeen, unleſs we ſharpen our ſight by uſeleſs curioſity.</p>
                              <p>THERE is always a point at which caution, however ſolicitous, muſt limit its preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, becauſe one terror often counteracts another. I once knew one of the ſpeculatiſts of cowardice whoſe reigning diſturbance was the dread of houſe-breakers. His enquiries were for nine years employed upon the beſt method of barring a window, or a door; and many an hour has he ſpent in eſtabliſhing the preference of a bolt to a lock. He had at laſt, by the daily ſuperaddition of new expedients, contrived a door which could never be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; for one bar was ſecured by another with ſuch intricacy of ſubordination, that he was himſelf not always able to diſengage them in the proper method. He was happy in this fortification, till being aſked how he would eſcape if he was threatened by fire, he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, that with all his care, and all his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, he had only been aſſiſting his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. He then immediately tore off his bolts, and now leaves at night his outer door half locked, that he may not by his own folly periſh in the flames.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="235" facs="tcp:1098200104:236"/>
THERE is one ſpecies of terror which thoſe who are unwilling to ſuffer the reproach of cowardice have wiſely dignified with the name of <hi>antipathy.</hi> A man who talks with intrepidity of the monſters of the wilderneſs while they are out of ſight, will readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs his <hi>antipathy</hi> to a mole, a weaſel, or a frog. He has indeed no dread of harm from an inſect or a worm, but his <hi>antipathy</hi> turns him pale whenever they approach him. He believes that a boat will tranſport him with as much ſafety as his neighbours, but he cannot conquer his <hi>antipathy</hi> to the water. Thus he goes on without any reproach from his own reflections, and every day multiplies <hi>antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies,</hi> till he becomes contemptible to others and burdenſome to himſelf.</p>
                              <p>IT is indeed certain, that impreſſions of dread may ſometimes be unluckily made by objects not in themſelves juſtly formidable; but when fear is diſcovered to be groundleſs, it is to be eradicated like other falſe opinions, and <hi>antipathies</hi> are generally ſuperable by a ſingle effort. He that has been taught to ſhud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at a mouſe, if he can perſuade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:1098200104:237"/>
to riſque one encounter, will find his own ſuperiority, and exchange his terrors for the pride of conqueſt.</p>

                              <p>AMONG the ladies who pleaſe themſelves with ſplendid furniture, or elegant entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is a practice, if not univerſal, yet every common, to aſk every gueſt how he likes the carved work of the cornice, or the figures of the tapeſtry; the china at the table, or the plate on the ſide-board; and on all occaſions to enquire his opinion of their judgment and their choice. <hi>Melania</hi> has laid her new watch
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:1098200104:238"/>
in the window nineteen times, that ſhe may deſire me to look upon it. <hi>Calliſta</hi> has an art of dropping her ſnuff-box by drawing out her handkerchief, that when I pick it up, I may admire it; and <hi>Fulgentia</hi> has conducted me, by miſtake, into the wrong room, at every viſit I have paid ſince her picture was put into a new frame.</p>
                              <p>I HOPE, Mr. RAMBLER, you will inform them, that no man ſhould be denied the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of ſilence, or tortured to falſe declarations; and that though ladies may juſtly claim to be exempt from rudeneſs, they have no right to force unwilling civilities.

                              <p>YOUR great predeceſſor, the Spectator, endeavoured to diffuſe among his fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male readers a deſire of knowledge; nor can I charge you, though you do not ſeem equally attentive to the ladies, with endeavouring to diſcourage them from any laudable perſuit. But however either he or you may excite our curioſity, you have not yet informed us how it may be gratified.

                  <hi>POLITIAN,</hi> a name eminent among the reſtorers of polite literature, when he publiſhed a collection of epigrams, prefix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to many of them the year of his age at which they were compoſed. He might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign by this information, either to boaſt the early maturity of his genius, or to conciliate indulgence to the puerility of his performances. But whatever was his intent, it is remarked by <hi>Scaliger,</hi> that he very little promoted his own reputation, becauſe he fell below the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe which his firſt productions had given, and in the latter part of life ſeldom equalled the ſallies of his youth.</p>
               <p>IT is not uncommon for thoſe who at their firſt entrance into the world were diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for eminent attainments or ſuperior abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to diſappoint the hopes which they had
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:1098200104:242"/>
raiſed, and to end in neglect and obſcurity that life which they began in celebrity and honour. To the long catalogue of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies of old age, which moral and ſatirical writers have ſo copiouſly diſplayed, may be often added the loſs of fame.</p>
               <p>THE advance of the human mind towards any object of laudable perſuit, may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the progreſs of a body driven by a blow. It moves for a time with great velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and vigour, but the force of the firſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe is perpetually decreaſing, and though it ſhould encounter no obſtacle capable of quell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it by a ſudden ſtop, the reſiſtance of the medium through which it paſſes, and the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent inequalities of the ſmootheſt ſurface will in a ſhort time by continued retardation wholly overpower it. Some hindrances will be found in every road of life, but he that fixes his eyes upon any thing at a diſtance neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loſes ſight of all that fills up the interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate ſpace, and therefore ſets forward with alacrity and confidence, nor ſuſpects a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand obſtacles by which he afterwards finds his paſſage embarraſſed and obſtructed. Some are indeed ſtopt at once in their career by a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:1098200104:243"/>
ſhock of calamity, or diverted to a different direction by the croſs impulſe of ſome violent paſſion; but far the greater part languiſh by ſlow degrees, deviate at firſt into ſlight obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, and themſelves ſcarcely perceive at what time their ardour forſook them, or when they loſt ſight of their original deſign.</p>
               <p>WEARINESS and negligence are perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally prevailing by ſilent encroachments, aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by different cauſes, and not obſerved till they cannot, without great difficulty, be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. Labour neceſſarily requires pauſes of eaſe and relaxation, and the deliciouſneſs of eaſe commonly makes us unwilling to return to labour. We, perhaps, prevail upon our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to renew our attempts, but eagerly liſten to every argument for frequent interpoſitions of amuſement; for when indolence has once entered upon the mind, it can ſcarcely be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed but by ſuch efforts as very few are found willing to exert.</p>
               <p>IT is the fate of induſtry to be equally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered by miſcarriage and ſucceſs, by confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and deſpondency. He that engages in a great undertaking with a falſe opinion of its
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:1098200104:244"/>
facility, or too high conceptions of his own ſtrength, is eaſily diſcouraged by the firſt hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance of his advances, becauſe he had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelf an equal and perpetual progreſſion without impediment or diſturbance; when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected interruptions break in upon him, he is in the ſtate of a man ſurpriſed by a tempeſt where he purpoſed only to baſk in the calm, or ſport in the ſhallows.</p>
               <p>IT is not only common to find the difficulty of an enterprize greater, but the profit leſs, than hope had pictured it. Youth enters the world with very happy prejudices in her own favour. She imagines herſelf not only certain of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing every adventure, but of obtaining thoſe rewards which the accompliſhment may deſerve. She is not eaſily perſuaded to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the force of merit can be reſiſted by obſtinacy and avarice, or its luſtre darkened by envy and malignity. She has not yet learned that the moſt evident claims to praiſe or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment may be rejected by malice againſt conviction, or by indolence without exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; that they may be ſometimes defeated by artifices, and ſometimes overborn by clamour; that in the mingled numbers of mankind,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:1098200104:245"/>
many need no other provocation to enmity than that they find themſelves excelled; that others have ceaſed their curioſity, and conſider every man who fills the mouth of report with a new name, as an intruder upon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, and diſturber of their repoſe; that ſome are engaged in complications of intereſt which they imagine endangered by every innovation; that many yield themſelves up implicitly to every report which hatred diſſeminates or folly ſcatters; and that whoever aſpires to the notice of the publick, he has in almoſt every man an enemy and a rival; and muſt ſtruggle with the oppoſition of the daring, and elude the ſtratagems of the timorous, muſt quicken the frigid and ſoften the obdurate, muſt reclaim perverſeneſs and inform ſtupidity.</p>
               <p>IT is no wonder that when the proſpect of reward has vaniſhed, the zeal of enterprize ſhould ceaſe; for who would perſevere to cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate the ſoil which he has, after long labour, diſcovered to be barren? He who had pleaſed himſelf with anticipated praiſes, and expected that he ſhould meet in every place with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage or friendſhip, will ſoon remit his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, when he finds that from thoſe who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:1098200104:246"/>
to be conſidered as his admirers nothing can be hoped but cold civility, and that many refuſe to own his excellence, leſt they ſhould be too juſtly expected to reward it.</p>
               <p>A MAN thus cut off from the proſpect of that port to which his addreſs and fortitude had been employed to ſteer him, often aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons himſelf to chance and to the wind, and glides careleſs and idle down the current of life, without reſolution to make another effort, till he is ſwallowed up by the gulph of mortality.</p>
               <p>OTHERS are betrayed to the ſame deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of themſelves by a contrary fallacy. It was ſaid of <hi>Hannibal</hi> that he wanted nothing to the completion of his martial virtues, but that when he had gained a victory he ſhould know how to uſe it. The folly of deſiſting too ſoon from ſucceſsful labours, and the haſte of enjoying advantages before they are ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, is often fatal to men of impetuous deſire, and ardent imagination, to men whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of uncommon powers fills them with preſumption, and who, having born op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition down before them, and left emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:1098200104:247"/>
panting behind, are early perſuaded to imagine that they have reached the heights of perfection, and that now being no longer in danger from competitors, they may paſs the reſt of their days in the enjoyment of their acquiſitions, in contemplation of their own ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority, and in attention to their own praiſes, and look unconcerned from their eminence upon the toils and contentions of meaner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
               <p>IT is not ſufficiently conſidered in the hour of exultation, that all human excellence is comparative; that no man performs much but in proportion to what others accompliſh, or to the time and opportunities which have been allowed him; and that he who ſtops at any point of excellence is every day ſinking in eſtimation, becauſe his improvement grows continually more incommenſurate to his life. Yet, as no man willingly quits opinions favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to himſelf, they who have once been juſtly celebrated, imagine that they ſtill have the ſame pretenſions to regard, and ſeldom perceive the diminution of their character while there is time to recover it. Nothing then remains but murmurs and remorſe; for
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:1098200104:248"/>
if the ſpendthrift's poverty be imbittered by the reflection that he once was rich, how muſt the idler's obſcurity be clouded by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membering that he once had luſtre!</p>
               <p>THESE errors all ariſe from an original miſtake of the true motives of action. He that never extends his view beyond the praiſes or rewards of men, will be dejected by neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and envy, or infatuated by honours and applauſe. But the conſideration that life is only depoſited in his hands to be employed in obedience to a Maſter who will regard his endeavours not his ſucceſs, would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved him from trivial elations and diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and enabled him to proceed with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and chearfulneſs, neither enervated by commendation, nor intimidated by cenſure.</p>

               <p>THE writers who have undertaken the taſk of reconciling mankind to their preſent ſtate, and of relieving the diſcontent produced by the various diſtribution of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial advantages, very frequently remind us that we judge too haſtily of good and evil, that we view only the ſuperficies of life, and determine of the whole by a very ſmall part; and that in the condition of men it frequently happens, that grief and fear, anxiety and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, lie hid under the golden robes of proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the gloom of calamity is cheared by ſecret radiations of hope and comfort; as in the works of nature the bog is ſometimes

               <p>WE are either born with ſuch diſſimilitude of temper and inclinations, or receive ſo many of our ideas and opinions from the ſtate of life in which we are engaged, and the particular objects by which we are ſurrounded, that the griefs and cares of one part of mankind ſeem to the other hypocriſy, folly, and affectation. Every claſs of ſociety has its cant of lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is underſtood or regarded by none but themſelves; and every part of life has its uneaſineſſes, which thoſe who do not feel them will not commiſerate. An event which ſpreads terror and diſtraction over half the commercial world, that aſſembles the trading companies in councils and committees, and ſinks the hearts and ſhakes the nerves of a thouſand ſtockjobbers, is read by the landlord and the farmer with frigid indifference. An affair of love which fills the young breaſt with inceſſant alternations of hope and fear, and ſteals away the night and day from every other
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:1098200104:252"/>
pleaſure or employment, is regarded by them whoſe paſſions time has extinguiſhed, as a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial amuſement, which can properly raiſe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther joy, nor ſorrow, and which, though it may be ſuffered to fill the vacuity of an idle moment, ſhould always give way to prudence or intereſt.</p>
               <p>HE that never had any other deſire than to fill a cheſt with money, or to add another manour to his eſtate, who never grieved but at a bad mortgage, or entered a company but to make a bargain, would be aſtoniſhed to hear of beings known among the polite and gay by the denomination of wits. How would he gape with curioſity, or grin with contempt, at the mention of beings who have no wiſh but to ſpeak what was never ſpoke before; who if they happen to inherit wealth, often exhauſt their patrimonies in treating thoſe who will hear them talk; and if they are poor, neglect a thouſand opportunities of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving their fortunes for the pleaſure of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king others laugh? How ſlowly would he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that there are men who would rather loſe a legacy than the reputation of a diſtich; who think it leſs diſgrace to want money than
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:1098200104:253"/>
repartee; whom the vexation of having been foiled in a conteſt of raillery is ſometimes ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to deprive of ſleep; and who would eſteem it a lighter evil to miſs a profitable bargain by ſome accidental delay, than not to have thought of a ſmart reply till the time of producing it was paſt? How little would he ſuſpect that this child of idleneſs and frolick enters every aſſembly with a beating boſom, like a litigant on the day of deciſion, and revolves the probability of applauſe with all the anxiety of a conſpirator whoſe fate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the next night; that at the hour of retirement he often carries home, amidſt all his airy negligence, a heart lacerated with envy, or depreſſed with diſappointment; and immures himſelf in his cloſet, that he may diſencumber his memory at leiſure, review the progreſs of the day, ſtate with accuracy his loſs or gain of reputation, and examine the cauſes of his failure or ſucceſs?</p>
               <p>AND yet more remote from common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions are the numerous and reſtleſs anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, by which female happineſs is particularly diſturbed. A ſolitary philoſopher would ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine ladies born with an exemption from care
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:1098200104:254"/>
and ſorrow, lulled in perpetual ſecurity, and feaſted with unmingled pleaſure; for what can interrupt the content of thoſe, upon whom one age has laboured after another to confer honours, and accumulate immunities; thoſe to whom rudeneſs is infamy, and inſult is cowardice; whoſe eye commands the brave, and whoſe ſmile ſoftens the ſevere; whom the ſailor travels to adorn, the ſoldier bleeds to defend, and the poet wears out life to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate; who claim tribute from every art and ſcience, and for whom all who approach them endeavour to multiply delights, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring from them any return but willingneſs to be pleaſed?</p>
               <p>SURELY, among theſe favourites of nature, thus unacquainted with toil and danger, feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city muſt have fixed her reſidence; they muſt know only the changes of more vivid or more gentle joys; their life muſt always move either to the ſlow or ſprightly melody of the lyre of gladneſs; they can never aſſemble but to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or retire but to peace.</p>
               <p>SUCH would be the thoughts of every man who ſhould hover at a diſtance round the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:1098200104:255"/>
world, and know it only by conjecture and ſpeculation. But experience will ſoon diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver how eaſily thoſe are diſguſted who have been made nice by plenty, and tender by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence. He will ſoon ſee to how many dangers power is expoſed which has no other guard than youth and beauty, and how eaſily that tranquillity is moleſted which can only be ſoothed with the ſongs of flattery. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to ſupply wants as faſt as an idle ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination may be able to form them, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all inconveniencies by which elegance refined into impatience may be offended. None are ſo hard to pleaſe as thoſe whom ſatiety of pleaſure makes weary of themſelves; nor any ſo readily provoked as thoſe who have been always courted with an emulation of civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p>THERE are indeed ſome ſtrokes which the envy of fate aims immediately at the fair. The miſtreſs of <hi>Catullus</hi> wept for her ſparrow many centuries ago, and lapdogs will be ſometimes ſick in the preſent age. The moſt faſhionable brocade is ſubject to ſtains; a pinner, the pride of <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> may be torn by a careleſs waſher; a picture may drop from a watch; or the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:1098200104:256"/>
of a new ſuit may be interrupted on the firſt day of its enjoyment, and all diſtinctions of dreſs unexpectedly obliterated by a general mourning.</p>
               <p>SUCH is the ſtate of every age, every ſex, and every condition; all have their cares, either from nature or from folly: and whoever therefore finds himſelf inclined to envy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, ſhould remember that he knows not the real condition which he deſires to obtain, but is certain that by indulging a vicious paſſion, he muſt leſſen that happineſs which he thinks already too ſparingly beſtowed.</p>

               <p>THE greater part of moraliſts, like other writers, inſtead of caſting their eyes abroad into the living world, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to form from their own obſervations new maxims of practice and new hints of theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, content their curioſity with that ſecondary knowledge which the peruſal of books affords, and think themſelves entitled to reverence and to fame by a new arrangement of an ancient ſyſtem, or new illuſtration of eſtabliſhed prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. The ſage precepts of the firſt inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the world are tranſmitted from age to age with little variation, and echoed from one
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:1098200104:258"/>
author to another, not perhaps without ſome loſs of their original force at every repercuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>I KNOW not whether any other reaſon than this idleneſs of imitation can be aſſigned for that uniform and conſtant partiality, by which ſome vices have hitherto eſcaped cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and ſome virtues wanted recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nor can I diſcover why elſe we have been warned only againſt part of our enemies, while the reſt have been ſuffered to ſteal up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us without notice; or why on one ſide the heart has been doubly fortified, while it has lain open on the other to the incurſions of error, and the ravages of vice.</p>
               <p>AMONG the favourite topicks of moral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, may be numbered the dangers and miſcarriages of imprudent boldneſs, the folly of attempts beyond our power, and the neceſſity of modeſt diffidence and cautious deliberation. Every page of every philoſopher is crouded with examples of temerity that ſunk under burthens which ſhe laid upon herſelf, and called out enemies to battle by whom ſhe was deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:1098200104:259"/>
THEIR remarks are certainly too juſt to be diſputed, and too ſalutary to be rejected; but there is likewiſe ſome danger leſt timorous prudence ſhould be too ſtrongly inculcated, leſt courage and enterprize ſhould be wholly repreſſed, and the mind congealed in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual inactivity by the fatal influence of fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorifick wiſdom.</p>
               <p>EVERY man ſhould, indeed, carefully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare his force with his undertaking; for though we ought not to live only for our own ſakes, or act with regard folely to our own advantage, and though therefore danger or difficulty ſhould not be avoided merely becauſe we may expoſe ourſelves to miſery or diſgrace; yet it may be juſtly required of us, not to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard our lives, or throw away our labour, upon inadequate and hopeleſs deſigns, ſince we might by a more juſt eſtimate of our abilities have become more uſeful to mankind.</p>
               <p>THERR is, doubtleſs, an irrational con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of danger which approaches very near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the folly, if not the guilt, of ſuicide: there is a ridiculous perſeverance in imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:1098200104:260"/>
ſchemes, which is juſtly puniſhed with ignominy and reproach. But in the wide regions of probability which are the proper province of prudence and election, there is always room to deviate on either ſide of rectitude without ruſhing againſt apparent abſurdity; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the inclinations of nature, or the impreſſions of precept, the daring and the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious may move in different directions without touching upon raſhneſs or cowardice.</p>
               <p>THAT there is a middle path which it is every man's duty to find, and to obſerve, is unanimouſly confeſſed; but it is likewiſe uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally acknowledged that this middle path is ſo narrow, that it cannot eaſily be diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo little beaten that there are no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain marks by which it can be followed; the care therefore of all thoſe who have undertaken conduct others has been, that whenever they decline into obliquities, they ſhould be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to tend towards the ſide of ſafety.</p>
               <p>IT can, indeed, raiſe no wonder that te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merity has been generally cenſured; for it is one of the vices with which few can be charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and which therefore great numbers are
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:1098200104:261"/>
ready to condemn. It is the vice of noble and generous minds, the exuberance of mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity, and the ebullition of genius; and is therefore not regarded with much tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, becauſe it never flatters us by that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of ſoftneſs and imbeciility which is commonly neceſſary to conciliate compaſſion. But if the ſame attention had been applied to the ſearch of arguments againſt cold deſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, againſt the mean and cowardly dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liction of ourſelves, and the folly of preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing impoſſibilities, and anticipating fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, I know not whether many would not have been rouſed to uſefulneſs, who, having been taught to confound prudence with timi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, never ventured to excel left they ſhould unfortunately fail.</p>
               <p>IT is always neceſſary to diſtinguiſh our own intereſt from that of others, and that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction will perhaps aſſiſt us in fixing the juſt limits of caution and adventurouſneſs. In an undertaking that involves the happineſs, or the ſafety of many, we have certainly no right to hazard more than is allowed by thoſe who partake the dangers; but where only our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves can ſuffer by miſcarriage, we are not
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:1098200104:262"/>
confined within ſuch narrow limits; and ſtill leſs is the reproach of temerity, when num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers will receive advantage by ſucceſs, and only one be incommoded by failure.</p>
               <p>MEN are generally willing to hear precepts by which eaſe is favoured; and as no reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is raiſed by general repreſentations of human folly, even in thoſe who are moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently jealous of comparative reputation, we confeſs, without reluctance, that vain man is ignorant of his own weakneſs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore frequently preſumes to attempt what he can never accompliſh; but it ought like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be remembered, that he is no leſs ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of his own powers, and might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have accompliſhed a thouſand deſigns, which the prejudices of cowardice reſtrained him from attempting.</p>
               <p>IT is obſerved in the golden verſes of <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras,</hi> that <hi>Power is never far from neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.</hi> The vigour of the human mind quickly appears, when there is no longer any place for doubt and heſitation, when diffidence is abſorbed in the ſenſe of danger or over-whelmed by ſome reſiſtleſs paſſion. We then
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:1098200104:263"/>
ſoon diſcover, that difficulty is, for the moſt part, the daughter of idleneſs, that the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles with which our way ſeemed to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed were only phantoms, which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved real becauſe we durſt not advance to a cloſe examination; and we learn that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to determine without experience how much conſtancy may endure, or diligence per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</p>
               <p>BUT whatever pleaſure may be found in the review of diſtreſſes when art or courage has ſurmounted them, few will be perſuaded to wiſh that they may be awakened by want or terror to the conviction of their own abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Every one ſhould therefore endeavour to invigorate himſelf by reaſon and reflection, and determine to exert, in any laudable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, the latent force that nature may have repoſited in him againſt the hour of exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, before external compulſion ſhall tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture him to diligence. It is below the dignity of a reaſonable being to owe that ſtrength to neceſſity which ought always to act at the call of choice, or to need any other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to induſtry and perſeverance than the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of performing the duties of his condition.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="263" facs="tcp:1098200104:264"/>
REFLECTIONS that may at leaſt drive away deſpair, cannot eaſily be wanting to him who has taken a ſurvey of the world, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders how much life is now advanced beyond the ſtate of naked, undiſciplined, uninſtructed nature. Whatever has been effected for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience or elegance, while it was yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, was believed impoſſible; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would never have been attempted, had not ſome, more daring than the reſt, adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to bid defiance to prejudice and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Nor is there yet any reaſon to doubt that the ſame labour would be rewarded with the ſame ſucceſs. There are certainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable qualities in the products of nature yet undiſcovered, and innumerable combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the powers of art yet untried. It is the duty of every man to endeavour that ſomething may be added by his induſtry to the hereditary aggregate of knowledge and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. To add much can indeed be the lot of few, but to add ſomething, however little, every one may hope; and of every honeſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour it is certain, that, however unſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, it will be at laſt rewarded.</p>

                     <p>YOU have very lately obſerved that in the numerous ſubdiviſions of the world, every claſs and order of mankind have joys and ſorrows of their own; we all feel hourly pain and pleaſure from events which paſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heeded before other eyes, but can ſcarcely communicate our perceptions to minds preoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied by different objects, any more than the delight of well diſpoſed colours or harmonious
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:1098200104:266"/>
ſounds can be imparted to ſuch as want the ſenſes of hearing or of ſight.</p>
                     <p>I AM ſo ſtrongly convinced of the juſtneſs of this remark, and have on ſo many occaſions diſcovered with how little attention pride looks upon calamity of which ſhe thinks her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf not in danger, and indolence liſtens to complaint when it is not echoed by her own remembrance, that though I am about to lay the occurrences of my life before you, I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion whether you will condeſcend to peruſe my narrative, or without the help of ſome fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male ſpeculatiſt be able to underſtand it.</p>
                     <p>I WAS bern a beauty. From the dawn of reaſon I had my regard turned wholly upon myſelf, nor can recollect any thing earlier than praiſe and admiration. My mother, whoſe face had luckily advanced her to a condition above her birth, thought no evil ſo great as deformity. She had not the power of imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any other defect than a cloudy complexion, or diſproportionate features; and therefore contemplated me as an aſſemblage of all that could raiſe envy or deſire, and predicted with
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:1098200104:267"/>
triumphant fondneſs the extent of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, and the number of my ſlaves.</p>
                     <p>SHE never mentioned any of my young acquaintance before me, but to remark how much they fell below my perfection; how one would have had a fineface but that her eyes were without luſtre; how another ſtruck the ſight at a diſtance, but wanted my hair and teeth at a nearer view; another diſgraced an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant ſhape with a brown ſkin; ſome had ſhort fingers, and others had dimples in a wrong place.</p>
                     <p>AS ſhe expected no happineſs nor advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage but from beauty, ſhe thought nothing but beauty worthy of her care; and her maternal kindneſs was chiefly exerciſed in contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to protect me from any accident that might deface me with a ſcar, or ſtain me with a freckle: ſhe never thought me ſufficiently ſhaded from the ſun, or ſcreened from the fire. She was ſevere or indulgent with no other intention than the preſervation of my form; ſhe excuſed me from work, leſt I ſhould learn to hang down my head, or harden my finger with a needle; ſhe ſnatched away my book,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:1098200104:268"/>
becauſe a young lady in the neighbourhood had made her eyes red with reading by a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle; but ſhe would ſcarcely ſuffer me to eat, leſt I ſhould ſpoil my ſhape, nor to walk, leſt I ſhould ſwell my ancle with a ſprain. At night I was accurately ſurveyed from head to foot, leſt I ſhould have ſuffered any diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my charms in the adventures of the day; and was never permitted to ſleep, till I had paſſed through the coſmetick diſcipline, part of which was a regular luſtration per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with bean-flower water and may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dews; my hair was perfumed with variety of unguents, by ſome of which it was to be thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, and by others to be curled. The ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my hands was ſecured by medicated gloves, and my boſom rubbed with a pomade prepared by my mother, of virtue to diſcuſs pimples, and clear diſcolorations.</p>
                     <p>I WAS always called up early, becauſe the morning air gives a freſhneſs to the cheeks; but I was placed behind a curtain in my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's chamber, becauſe the neck is eaſily tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the riſing ſun. I was then dreſſed with a thouſand precautions, and again heard my own praiſes, and triumphed in the compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:1098200104:269"/>
and prognoſtications of all that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached me.</p>
                     <p>MY mother was not ſo much prepoſſeſſed with an opinion of my natural excellencies as not to think ſome cultivation neceſſary to their completion. She took care that I ſhould want none of the accompliſhments included in female education, or conſidered as neceſſary in faſhionable life. I was looked upon in my ninth year as the chief ornament of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing-maſter's ball, and Mr. <hi>Ariet</hi> uſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach his other ſcholars with my perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances on the harpſichord. At twelve I was remarkable for playing my cards with great elegance of manner, and accuracy of judgment.</p>
                     <p>AT laſt the time came when my mother thought me perfect in my exerciſes, and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to diſplay in the open world thoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments which had yet only been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in ſelect parties, or domeſtic aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies. Preparations were therefore made for my appearance on a publick night, which ſhe conſidered as the moſt important and cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical moment of my life. She cannot be
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:1098200104:270"/>
charged with neglecting any means of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, or leaving any thing to chance which prudence could aſcertain. Every orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was tried in every poſition, every friend was conſulted about the colour of my dreſs, and the manteaumakers were haraſſed with directions and alterations.</p>
                     <p>AT laſt the night arrived from which my future life was to be reckoned. I was dreſſed and ſent out to conquer, with a heart beating like that of an old knight errant at his firſt fally. Scholars have told me of a <hi>Spartan</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, who, when ſhe armed her ſon for battle, bade him bring back his ſhield or be brought upon it. My venerable parent diſmiſſed me to a field, in her opinion of equal glory, with a command to ſhew that I was her daughter, and not to return without a lover.</p>
                     <p>I WENT, and was received like other pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing novelties with a tumult of applauſe. Every man who valued himſelf upon the graces of his perſon, or the elegance of his addreſs, crouded about me, and wit and ſplendor contended for my notice. I was delightfully fatigued with inceſſant civilities, which were made
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:1098200104:271"/>
more pleaſing by the apparent envy of thoſe whom my preſence expoſed to neglect. I returned with an attendant equal in rank and wealth to my utmoſt wiſhes, and from this time ſtood in the firſt rank of beauty, was followed by gazers in the mall, celebrated in the papers of the day, imitated by all who endeavoured to riſe into faſhion, and cenſured by thoſe whom age or diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment forced to retire.</p>
                     <p>MY mother, who pleaſed herſelf with the hopes of ſeeing my exaltation, dreſſed me with all the exuberance of finery; and when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to her that a fortune might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected proportionate to my appearance, told me that ſhe ſhould ſcorn the reptile who could enquire after the fortune of a girl like me. She adviſed me to proſecute my victories, and time would certainly bring me a captive who might deſerve the honour of being enchained for ever.</p>
                     <p>MY lovers were indeed ſo numerous, that I had no other care than that of determining to whom I ſhould ſeem to give the prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. But having been ſteadily and induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:1098200104:272"/>
inſtructed to preſerve my heart from any impreſſions which might hinder me from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting my intereſt, I acted with leſs embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſment, becauſe my choice was regulated by principles more clear and certain than the caprice of approbation. When I had ſingled out one from the reſt as more worthy of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, I proceeded in my meaſures by the rules of art; and yet when the ardour of the firſt viſits was ſpent, generally found a ſudden declenſion of my influence; I felt in myſelf the want of ſome power to diverſify amuſement, and enliven converſation, and could not but ſuſpect that my mind failed in performing the promiſes of my face. This opinion was ſoon confirmed by one of my lovers, who married <hi>Lavinia</hi> with leſs beauty and fortune than mine, becauſe he thought a wife ought to have qualities which might make her amiable when her bloom was paſt.</p>
                     <p>THE vanity of my mother would not ſuffer her to diſcover any defect in one that had been formed by her inſtructions, and had all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence which ſhe herſelf could boaſt. She told me that nothing ſo much hindered the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:1098200104:273"/>
advancement of women as literature and wit, which generally frightened away thoſe that could make the beſt ſettlements, and drew about them a needy tribe of poets and philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, that filled their heads with wild notions of content, and contemplation, and virtuous obſcurity. She therefore enjoined me to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove my minuet ſtep with a new <hi>French</hi> dancing-maſter, and wait the event of the next birth-night.</p>
                     <p>I HAD now almoſt completed my nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth year: if my charms had loſt any of their ſoftneſs, it was more than compenſated by additional dignity; and if the attractions of innocence were impaired, their place was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by the arts of allurement. I was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore preparing for a new attack, without any abatement of my confidence, when in the midſt of my hopes and ſchemes, I was ſeized by that dreadful malady which has ſo often put a ſudden end to the tyranny of beauty. I recovered my health after a long confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but when I looked again on that face which had been often fluſhed with tranſport at its own reflexion, and ſaw all that I had learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to value, all that I had endeavoured to
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:1098200104:274"/>
improve, all that had procured me honours or praiſes, irrecoverably deſtroyed, I ſunk at once into melancholy and deſpondence. My pain was not much confoled or alleviated by my mother, who grieved that I had not loſt my life together with my beauty, and declared, that ſhe thought a young woman diveſted of her charms had nothing for which thoſe who loved her could deſire to ſave her from the grave.</p>
                     <p>HAVING thus continued my relation to the period from which my life took a new courſe, I ſhall conclude it in another letter, if by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing this you ſhew any regard for the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence of,</p>

               <p>THERE is ſcarcely any ſentiment in which, amidſt the innumerable varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of inclination that nature or accident have ſcattered in the world, we find greater numbers concurring than in the wiſh for riches; a wiſh indeed ſo prevalent that it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as univerſal and tranſcendental, as the deſire in which all other deſires are included, and of which the various purpoſes which actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate mankind are only ſubordinate ſpecies and different modifications.</p>
               <p>WEALTH is indeed the general center of inclination, the point to which all minds pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve an invariable tendency, and from which they afterwards diverge in numberleſs dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:1098200104:276"/>
Whatever is the remote or ultimate deſign, the immediate care is to be rich; and in whatever enjoyment we intend finally to acquieſce, we ſeldom conſider it as attainable but by the means of money. Of wealth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all unanimouſly confeſs the value, nor is there any diſagreement but about the uſe.</p>
               <p>NO deſire can be formed which riches do not aſſiſt us to gratify. He that places his happineſs in ſplendid equipage or numerous dependents, in refined praiſe or popular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, in the accumulation of curioſities or the revels of luxury, in ſplendid edifices or wide plantations, muſt ſtill either by birth or acquiſition poſſeſs riches. They may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the elemental principles of pleaſure, which may be combined with endleſs diverſity; as the eſſential and neceſſary ſubſtance, of which only the form is left to be adjuſted by choice.</p>
               <p>THE neceſſity of riches being thus appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, it is not wonderful that almoſt every mind has been employed in endeavours to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire them; that multitudes have vied with each other in arts by which life is furniſhed
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:1098200104:277"/>
with accommodations, and which therefore mankind may reaſonably be expected to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>IT had indeed been happy, if this predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant appetite had operated only in concurrence with virtue, by influencing none but thoſe who were zealous to deſerve what they were eager to poſſeſs, and had abilities to improve their own fortunes by contributing to the eaſe or happineſs of others. To have riches and to have merit would then have been the ſame, and ſucceſs might reaſonably have been conſidered as a proof of excellence.</p>
               <p>BUT we do not find that any of the wiſhes of men keep a ſtated proportion to their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of attainment. Many envy and deſire wealth, who can never procure it by honeſt induſtry or uſeful knowledge. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore turn their eyes about to examine what other methods can be ſound of gaining that which none, however impotent or worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, will be content to want.</p>
               <p>A LITTLE enquiry will diſcover that there are nearer ways to profit than through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricacies
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:1098200104:278"/>
of art, or up the ſteeps of labour; that what wiſdom and virtue ſcarcely receive at the cloſe of life, as the recompence of long toil and repeated efforts, is brought within the reach of ſubtilty and diſhoneſty by more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditious and compendious meaſures: that the wealth of credulity is an open prey to falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; and that the poſſeſſions of ignorance and imbecillity are eaſily ſtolen away by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances of ſecret artifice, or ſeized by the gripe of unreſiſted violence.</p>
               <p>IT is likewiſe not hard to diſcover, that riches always procure protection for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they dazzle the eyes of enquiry, divert the celerity of purſuit, or appeaſe the ferocity of vengeance. When any man is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conteſtably known to have large poſſeſſions, very few think it requiſite to enquire by what practices they were obtained; the reſentment of mankind rages only againſt the ſtruggles of feeble and timorous corruption, but when it has ſurmounted the firſt oppoſition, it is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſupported by favour, and animated by applauſe.</p>
               <p>THE proſpect of gaining ſpeedily what is
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:1098200104:279"/>
ardently deſired, and the certainty of obtaining by every acceſſion of advantage an addition of ſecurity, have ſo far prevailed upon the paſſions of mankind, that the peace of life is deſtroyed by a general and inceſſant ſtruggle for riches. It is obſerved of gold, by an old epigramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, that <hi>to have it is to be in fear, and to want it is to be in ſorrow.</hi> There is no condition which is not diſquieted either with the care of gaining or of keeping money; and the race of man may be divided in a political eſtimate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe who are practiſing fraud, and thoſe who are repelling it.</p>
               <p>IF we conſider the preſent ſtate of the world, it will be found, that all confidence is loſt among mankind, that no man ventures to act where money can be endangered, upon the faith of another. It is impoſſible to ſee the long ſcrolls in which every contract is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, with all their appendages of ſeals and atteſtation, without wondering at the depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of thoſe beings, who muſt be reſtrained from violation of promiſe by ſuch formal and publick evidences, and precluded from equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation and ſubterfuge by ſuch punctilious minuteneſs. Among all the ſatires to which
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:1098200104:280"/>
folly and wickedneſs have given occaſion, none is equally ſevere with a bond or a ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>OF the various arts by which riches may be obtained, the greater part are at the firſt view irrreconcileable with the laws of virtue; ſome are openly flagitious, and practiſed not only in neglect, but in defiance of faith and juſtice; and the reſt are on every ſide ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled with dubious tendencies, and ſo beſet with perpetual temptations, that very few, even of thoſe who are not yet abandoned, are able to preſerve their innocence, or can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any other claim to pardon than that they have deviated from the right leſs than others, and have ſooner and more diligently endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to return.</p>
               <p>ONE of the chief characteriſticks of the golden age, of the age in which neither care nor danger had intruded on mankind, is the community of poſſeſſions: ſtrife and fraud were totally excluded, and every turbulent paſſion was ſtilled, by plenty and equality. Such were indeed happy times, but ſuch times can return no more. Community of poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:1098200104:281"/>
muſt always include ſpontaneity of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction; for what is only to be obtained by labour, muſt be of right the property of him by whoſe labour it is gained. And while a rightful claim to pleaſure or to affluence muſt be procured either by ſlow induſtry or uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hazard, there will always be multitudes whom cowardice or impatience will incite to more ſafe and more ſpeedy methods, who will ſtrive to pluck the fruit without cultivating the tree, and to ſhare the advantages of victory without partaking the danger of the battle.</p>
               <p>IN later ages, the conviction of the danger to which virtue is expoſed while the mind continues open to the influence of riches, has determined many to vows of perpetual pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; they have ſuppreſſed deſire by cutting off the poſſibility of gratification, and ſecured their peace by deſtroying the enemy whom they had no hope of reducing to quiet ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. But by debarring themſelves from evil, they have reſcinded many opportunities of good; they have too often ſunk into in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>activity and uſeleſſneſs; and though they have forborn to injure ſociety, have not fully paid their contributions to its happineſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="281" facs="tcp:1098200104:282"/>
WHILE riches are ſo neceſſary to preſent convenience, and ſo much more eaſily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by crimes than virtues, the mind can only be ſecured from yielding to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual impulſe of covetouſneſs by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderation of unchangeable and eternal motives. Gold will generally turn the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual balance, when weighed only againſt reputation; but will be light and ineffectual when the opopoſite ſcale is charged with juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, veracity, and piety.</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>I Was bred a ſcholar, and having paſſed the uſual courſe of education at leaſt with common proficiency and credit, I found it neceſſary to employ for the ſupport of life that learning which I had almoſt exhauſted my little fortune in acquiring. The lucrative profeſſions drew my regard with equal at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction: each had its peculiar advantages and inconveniences; each preſented ideas which excited my curioſity, and each impoſed duties which terrified my apprehenſion.</p>
                     <p>THERE is no temper more unpropitious to intereſt than deſultory application and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:1098200104:284"/>
enquiry, by which the deſires are held in a perpetual equipoiſe, and the mind fluctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates between different purpoſes without deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. I had books of every kind round me, among which I divided my time as ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price or accident directed. I often ſpent the firſt hours of the day, in conſidering to what ſtudy I ſhould devote the reſt; and at laſt when I was haraſſed with deliberation, ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up any author that lay upon the table, or perhaps, fled to a coffee-houſe for deliverance from the anxiety of irreſolution, and the gloomineſs of ſolitude. But, when my atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion happened to be vigorous, and my intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects unclouded, I ranged from art to art, from writer to writer, and have diſtributed a ſingle hour among <hi>Chryſoſtom, Galen, Homer, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clid,</hi> and <hi>Juſtinian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>IN the mean time my little patrimony grew imperceptibly leſs till I was at laſt rouſed from my literary ſlumber by the impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of a creditor, whoſe importunity obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged me to pacify him with ſo large a ſum that what remained was not ſufficient to ſupport me more than eight months. I hope you will not reproach me with avarice or cowardice
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:1098200104:285"/>
if I acknowledge that I now thought myſelf in danger of diſtreſs, and obliged to endeavour after ſome certain competence.</p>
                     <p>THERE have been heroes of negligence, who have laid the price of their laſt acre in a drawer, and, without the leaſt interruption of their tranquillity or abatement of their expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, taken out one piece after another, till there was no more remaining. But I was not born to ſuch dignity of imprudence, or ſuch exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation above the cares and neceſſities of life: I therefore immediately engaged my friends to procure me a little employment, which might ſet me free from the dread of poverty, and afford me time to plan out ſome final ſcheme of laſting advantage.</p>
                     <p>MY friends, whoſe kindneſs had never riſen into much ſolicitude, and who had neither inclination nor opportunity to know the ſtate of my revenues, were ſtruck with honeſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation at the confeſſion of my uneaſineſs, and immediately promiſed their endeavours for my extrication. They did not ſuffer their kindneſs to languiſh by delay, but in the firſt ardour of their zeal proſecuted their enquiries
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:1098200104:286"/>
with ſuch ſucceſs, that in leſs than a month I was perplexed with variety of offers and contrariety of proſpects.</p>
                     <p>I HAD however no time for long pauſes of conſideration; and therefore ſoon reſolved to accept the office of inſtructing a young nobleman in the houſe of his father: I went to the ſeat at which the family then happened to reſide, was received with great politeneſs, and invited to enter immediately on my charge. The terms offered were ſuch as I ſhould willingly have accepted, though my circumſtances had allowed me greater liberty of choice: the reſpect with which I was treated flattered my vanity; and perhaps, the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of the apartments, and the luxury of the table, were not wholly without their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. I immediately complied with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals, and received the young lord into my care.</p>
                     <p>HAVING no deſire to gain more than I ſhould truly deſerve, I very diligently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted my undertaking, and had the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of diſcovering in my pupil a flexible temper, a quick apprehenſion, and a retentive
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:1098200104:287"/>
memory. I did not much doubt that my care would, in time, produce a wiſe and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful counſellor to the ſtate, though my labours were ſomewhat obſtructed by want of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the neceſſity of complying with the freaks of negligence, and of waiting patiently for the lucky moment of voluntary attention. To a man, whoſe imagination was filled with the dignity of knowledge, and to whom a ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious life had made all the common amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments inſipid and contemptible, it was not very eaſy to ſuppreſs his indignation, when he ſaw himſelf forſaken in the midſt of his lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for an opportunity to catch an inſect, and found his inſtructions debarred from acceſs to the intellectual faculties by the memory of a childiſh frolick, or the deſire of a new play-thing.</p>
                     <p>THOSE vexations, however, would have recurred leſs frequently, had not his mamma, by entreating at one time that he ſhould be excuſed from his taſk as a reward for ſome petty compliance, and with-holding him from his book at another to gratify herſelf or her vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitants with his vivacity, ſhewn him that every thing was more pleaſing and more important
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:1098200104:288"/>
than knowledge, and that ſtudy was to be endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red rather than choſen, and was only the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thoſe hours which pleaſure left vacant, or diſcipline uſurped.</p>
                     <p>I THOUGHT it my duty to complain, in tender terms, of theſe frequent avocations; but was anſwered, that rank and fortune might reaſonably hope for ſome indulgence; that the retardation of my pupil's progreſs would not be imputed to any negligence or inability of mine; and that with the ſucceſs which ſatisfied every body elſe, I might ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfy myſelf. I had now done my duty, and without more remonſtrances, continued to inculcate my precepts whenever they would be heard, gained every day new influence, and found that by degrees my ſcholar began to feel the quick impulſes of curioſity, and the honeſt ardour of ſtudious ambition.</p>
                     <p>AT length it was reſolved to paſs a winter in <hi>London.</hi> The lady had too much fondneſs for her ſon to live five months without him, and too high an opinion of his wit and learning to refuſe her vanity the gratification of exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting him to the publick. I remonſtrated
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:1098200104:289"/>
againſt too early an acquaintance with cards and company; but with a ſoft contempt of my ignorance and pedantry, ſhe ſaid that he had been already confined too long to ſolitary ſtudy, and it was now time to ſhew him the world; that nothing was more a brand of meanneſs than baſhful timidity; that gay free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and elegant aſſurance were only to be gained by mixed converſation, a frequent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with ſtrangers, and a timely intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to ſplendid aſſemblies; and ſhe had more than once obſerved, that his forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and complaiſance began to deſert him, that he was ſilent when he had not ſomething of conſequence to ſay, bluſhed whenever he happened to find himſelf miſtaken, and hung down his head in the preſence of ladies, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that readineſs of reply and activity of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiouſneſs remarkable in young gentlemen that are bred in <hi>London.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>AGAIN I found reſiſtance hopeleſs, and again therefore I thought it proper to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. We entered the coach, and in four days were placed in the gayeſt and moſt magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent region of the town. My pupil, who had for ſeveral years lived at a remote ſeat,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:1098200104:290"/>
was immediately dazzled with a thouſand beams of novelty and ſhew. His imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was filled with the perpetual tumult of pleaſure that paſſed before him, and it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to allure him from the window, or to overpower by any charm of eloquence the rattle of coaches, and the ſounds which echoed from the doors in the neighbourhood. In three days his attention, which he began to regain, was diſturbed by a rich ſuit, in which he was equipped for the reception of company, and which, having been long accuſtomed to a plain dreſs, he could not at firſt ſurvey without ecſtaſy.</p>
                     <p>THE arrival of the family was now for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally notified; every hour of every day brought more intimate or more diſtant ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance to the door; and my pupil was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcriminately introduced to all, that he might accuſtom himſelf to change of faces, and be rid with ſpeed of his ruſtick diffidence. He has eaſily endeared himſelf to his mother by the ſpeedy acquiſition or recovery of her dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling qualities; his eyes ſparkle at a numerous aſſembly, and his heart dances at the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ball. He has at once caught the
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:1098200104:291"/>
infection of high life, and has no other teſt of principles or actions than the quality of thoſe to whom they are aſcribed. He begins al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready to look down on me with ſuperiority, and ſubmits to one ſhort leſſon in a week, as an act of condeſcenſion rather than obedience, for he is of opinion, that no tutor is properly qualified who cannot ſpeak <hi>French</hi>; and having formerly learned a few familiar phraſes from his ſiſter's governeſs, he is every day ſoliciting his mamma to procure him a foreign footman, that he may grow polite by his converſation. I am yet not inſulted, but find myſelf likely to become ſoon a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous incumbrance, for my ſcholar has now no time for ſcience, or for virtue; and the lady yeſterday declared him ſo much the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite of every company, that ſhe was afraid he would not have an hour in the day to dance and fence.</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>YOU have ſhewn by the publication of my letter, that you think the life of <hi>Victoria</hi> not wholly unworthy of the notice of a philoſopher: I ſhall therefore continue my narrative, without any apology for unimpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance which you have dignified, or for inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacies which you are to correct.</p>
                     <p>WHEN my life appeared to be no longer in danger, and as much of my ſtrength was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered as enabled me to bear the agitation of a coach, I was placed at a lodging in a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring village, to which my mother diſmiſſed
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:1098200104:293"/>
me with a faint embrace, having repeated her command not to expoſe my face too ſoon to the ſun or wind, and told me, that with care I might perhaps become tolerable again. The proſpect of being tolerable had very little power to elevate the imagination of one who had ſo long been accuſtomed to praiſe and ecſtacy; but it was ſome ſatisfaction to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from my mother, who was inceſſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ringing the knell of departed beauty, and never entered my room without the whine of condolence, or the growl of anger. She of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten wandered over my face, as travellers over the ruins of a celebrated city, to note every place which had once been remarkable for a happy feature. She condeſcended to viſit my retirement, but always left me more melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly; for after a thouſand trifling enquiries about my diet, and a minute examination of my looks, ſhe generally concluded with a ſigh that I ſhould never more be fit to be ſeen.</p>
                     <p>AT laſt I was permitted to return home, but found no great improvement of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; for I was impriſoned in my chamber as a criminal, whoſe appearance would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace my friends, and condemned to be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:1098200104:294"/>
into new beauty. Every experiment which the officiouſneſs of folly could communicate, or the credulity of ignorance believe, was tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon me. Sometimes I was covered with emollients, by which it was expected that all the ſcars would be filled, and my cheeks plumped up to their ſormer ſmoothneſs; and ſometimes I was puniſhed with artificial ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coriations, in hopes of gaining new graces with a new ſkin. The coſmetick ſcience was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted upon me; but who can repair the ruins of nature? My mother was forced to give me reſt at laſt, and abandon me to the fate of a fallen toaſt, whoſe fortune ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a hopeleſs game, no longer worthy of ſolicitude or attention.</p>
                     <p>THE condition of a young woman who has never thought or heard of any other excellence than beauty, and whom the ſudden blaſt of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe wrinkles in her bloom, is, indeed, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently calamitous. She is at once deprived of all that gave her eminence or power; of all that elated her pride, or animated her activity; all that filled her days with pleaſure and her nights with hope; all that gave gladneſs to the preſent hour, or brightened her proſpects of
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:1098200104:295"/>
futurity. It is perhaps, not in the power of a man whoſe attention has been divided by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of purſuits, and who has not been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to derive from others much of his happineſs, to image to himſelf ſuch helpleſs deſtitution, ſuch diſmal inanity. Every object of pleaſing contemplation, is at once ſnatched away, and the ſoul finds every receptacle of ideas empty, or filled only with the memory of joys that can return no more. All is gloomy privation, or impotent deſire; the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of anticipation ſlumber in deſpondency, or the powers of pleaſure mutiny for employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>I WAS ſo little able to find entertainment for myſelf, that I was forced in a ſhort time to venture abroad, as the ſolitary ſavage is driven by hunger from his cavern. I entered with all the humility of diſgrace into aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, where I had lately ſparkled with gaiety, and towered with triumph. I was not wholly without hope, that dejection had miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented me to myſelf, and that the remains of my former face might yet have ſome attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and influence: But the firſt circle of viſits convinced me, that my reign was at an end;
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:1098200104:296"/>
that life and death were no longer in my hands; that I was no more to practiſe the glance of command, or the frown of prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, to receive the tribute of ſighs and praiſes, or be ſoothed with the gentle mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs of amorous timidity. My opinion was now unheard, and my propoſals were unregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the narrowneſs of my knowledge, and the meanneſs of my ſentiments, were eaſily diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, when the eyes were no longer engaged againſt the judgment; and it was obſerved, by thoſe who had formerly been charmed with my vivacious loquacity, that my underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was impaired as well as my face, and that I was no longer qualified to fill a place in any company but a party at cards.</p>
                     <p>IT is ſcarcely to be imagined how ſoon the mind ſinks to a level with the condition. I, who had long conſidered all who approached me as vaſſals condemned to regulate their pleaſures by my eyes, and haraſs their inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for my entertainment, was in leſs than three weeks reduced to receive a ticket with profeſſions of obligation; to catch with eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at a compliment; and to watch with all the anxiouſneſs of dependance, leſt any little
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:1098200104:297"/>
civility that was paid me ſhould paſs unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged.</p>
                     <p>THOUGH the negligence of the men was not very pleaſing when compared with vows and adoration, yet it was far more ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than the inſolence of my own ſex. For the firſt ten months after my return into the world, I never entered a ſingle houſe in which the memory of my downfal was not revived. At one place I was congratulated on my eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape with life; at another I heard of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of early inoculation; by ſome I have been told in expreſs terms, that I am yet not without my charms; others have whiſpered at my entrance, This is the celebrated beauty. One told me of a waſh that would ſmooth the ſkin; and another offered me her chair that I might not front the light. Some ſoothed me with the obſervation that none can tell how ſoon my caſe may be her own; and ſome thought it proper to receive me with mournful tenderneſs, formal condolence, and conſolatory blandiſhments.</p>
                     <p>THUS was I every day haraſſed with all the ſtratagems of well-bred malignity; yet inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:1098200104:298"/>
was more tolerable than ſolitude, and I therefore perſiſted to keep my time at the doors of my acquaintance, without gratifying them with any appearance of reſentment or depreſſion. I expected that their exultation would in time vapour away; that the joy of their ſuperiority would end with its novelty; and that I ſhould be ſuffered to glide along in my preſent form among the nameleſs multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude whom nature never intended to excite envy or admiration, nor enabled to delight the eye or inflame the heart.</p>
                     <p>THIS was naturally to be expected, and this I began to experience. But when I was no longer agitated by the perpetual ardour of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance and effort of perſeverance, I found more ſenſibly the want of thoſe entertainments which had formerly delighted me; the day roſe upon me without an engagement, and the evening cloſed in its natural gloom, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſummoning me to a concert or a ball. None had any care to find amuſements for me, and I had no power of amuſing myſelf. Idleneſs expoſed me to melancholy, and life began to languiſh in motionleſs indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>

                        <pb n="298" facs="tcp:1098200104:299"/>
MISERY and ſhame are nearly allied. It was not without many ſtruggles that I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on myſelf to confeſs my uneaſineſs to <hi>Euphemia,</hi> the only friend who had never pained me with comfort or with pity. I at laſt laid my calamities before her, rather to eaſe my heart than receive aſſiſtance. "We muſt diſtinguiſh, ſaid ſhe, my <hi>Victoria,</hi> thoſe evils which are impoſed by provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, from thoſe to which we ourſelves give the power of hurting us. Of your calamity, a ſmall part is the infliction of heaven, the reſt is little more than the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſion of idle diſcontent. You have loſt that which may indeed ſometimes contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to happineſs, but to which happineſs is by no means inſeparably annexed. You have loſt what the greater number of the human race never have poſſeſſed; what thoſe on whom it is beſtowed for the moſt part poſſeſs in vain; and what you, while it was yours, knew not how to uſe: You have only loſt early what the laws of nature for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid you to keep long, and have loſt it while your mind is yet flexible, and while you have time to ſubſtitute more valuable and
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:1098200104:300"/>
more durable excellencies. Conſider your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, my <hi>Victoria,</hi> as a being born to know, to reaſon, and to act; riſe at once from your dream of melancholy to wiſdom and to piety; you will find that there are other charms than thoſe of beauty, and other joys than the praiſe of fools."</p>

               <p>I Sat yeſterday morning employed in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berating on which, among the various ſubjects that occurred to my imagination, I ſhould beſtow the paper of to-day. After a ſhort effort of meditation which by nothing was determined, I grew every moment more irreſolute, my ideas wandered from the firſt intention, and I rather wiſhed to think, than thought, upon any ſettled ſubject; till at laſt I was awakened from this dream of ſtudy by a ſummons from the preſs: the time was come for which I had been thus negligently purpoſing to provide, and, however dubious or ſluggiſh, I was now neceſſitated to write.</p>
               <p>THOUGH to a writer whoſe deſign is ſo
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:1098200104:302"/>
comprehenſive and miſcellaneous, that he may accommodate himſelf with a topick from every ſcene of life, or view of nature, it is no great aggravation of his taſk to be obliged to a ſudden compoſition, yet I could not forbear to reproach myſelf for having ſo long neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what was unavoidably to be done, and of which every moment's idleneſs increaſed the difficulty. There was however ſome pleaſure in reflecting that I, who had only trifled till diligence was neceſſary, might ſtill congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate myſelf upon my ſuperiority to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, who have trifled till diligence is vain; who can by no degree of activity or reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion recover the opportunities which have ſlipped away; and who are condemned by their own careleſneſs to hopeleſs calamity and barren ſorrow.</p>
               <p>THE folly of allowing ourſelves to delay what we know cannot be finally eſcaped, is one of the general weakneſſes, which in ſpite of the inſtruction of moraliſts, and the remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances of reaſon, prevail to a greater or leſs degree in almoſt every mind: even they who moſt ſteadily withſtand it, find it, if not the moſt violent, the moſt pertinacious of their
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:1098200104:303"/>
paſſions, always renewing its attacks, and though often vanquiſhed, never deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>IT is indeed natural to have particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the time preſent, and to be moſt ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous for that which is by its nearneſs enabled to make the ſtrongeſt impreſſions. When therefore any ſharp pain is to be ſuffered, or any formidable danger to be incurred, we can ſcarcely exempt ourſelves wholly from the ſeducements of imagination; we readily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that another day will bring ſome ſupport or advantage which we now want; and are eaſily perſuaded, that the moment of neceſſity which we deſire never to arrive, is at a great diſtance from us.</p>
               <p>THUS life is languiſhed away in the gloom of anxiety, and conſumed in collecting reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution which the next morning diſſipates; in forming purpoſes which we ſcarcely hope to keep; and reconciling ourſelves to our own cowardice by excuſes, which, while we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them, we know to be abſurd. Our firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is by the continual contemplation of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery hourly impaired; every ſubmiſſion to our fear enlarges its dominion; we not only waſte
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:1098200104:304"/>
that time in which the evil we dread might have been ſuffered and ſurmounted, but even where procraſtination produces no abſolute encreaſe of our difficulties, make them leſs ſuperable to ourſelves by habitual terrors. When evils cannot be avoided, it is wiſe to contract the interval of expectation; to meet the miſchiefs which will overtake us if we fly; and ſuffer only their real malignity without the conflicts of doubt and anguiſh of anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>TO act is far eaſier than to ſuffer, yet we every day ſee the progreſs of life retarded by the <hi>vis inertiae,</hi> the mere repugnance to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and find multitudes repining at the want of that which nothing but idleneſs hinders them from enjoying. The caſe of <hi>Tantalus,</hi> in the region of poetick puniſhment, was ſomewhat to be pitied, becauſe the fruits that hung about him retired from his hand; but what tenderneſs can be claimed by thoſe who though perhaps they ſuffer the pains of <hi>Tanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> will never lift their hands for their own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief?</p>
               <p>THERE is nothing more common among
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:1098200104:305"/>
this torpid generation than murmurs and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints; murmurs at uneaſineſs which only vacancy and ſuſpicion expoſe them to feel, and complaints of diſtreſſes which it is in their own power to remove. Lazineſs is commonly aſſociated with timidity. Either fear originally prohibits endeavours by infuſing deſpair of ſucceſs; or the frequent failure of irreſolute ſtruggles, and the conſtant deſire of avoiding labour, impreſs by degrees falſe ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors on the mind. But fear, whether natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or acquired, when once it has full poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the fancy never fails to employ it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on viſions of calamity, ſuch as if they are not ſoon diſſipated by uſeful employment, will ſoon overcaſt it with horrors, and imbitter life not only with thoſe miſeries by which all earthly beings are really more or leſs tormented, but with thoſe which do not yet exiſt, and which can only be diſcerned by the perſpicacity of cowardice.</p>
               <p>AMONG all who ſacrifice future advant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to preſent inclination, ſcarcely any gain ſo little as thoſe that ſuffer themſelves to freeze in idleneſs. Others are corrupted by ſome enjoyment of more or leſs power to
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:1098200104:306"/>
gratify the paſſions; but to neglect our duties, merely to avoid the labour of performing them, a labour which is always punctually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, is ſurely to ſink under weak temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. Idleneſs never can ſecure tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity; the call of reaſon and of conſcience will pierce the cloſeſt pavilion of the ſluggard, and, though it may not have force to drive him from his down, will be loud enough to hinder him from ſleep. Thoſe moments which he cannot reſolve to make uſeful by devoting them to the great buſineſs of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, will ſtill be uſurped by powers that will not leave them to his diſpoſal; remorſe and vexation will ſeize upon them, and forbid him to enjoy what he is ſo deſirous to appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate.</p>
               <p>THERE are other cauſes of inactivity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to more active faculties and more acute diſcernment. He to whom many objects of perſuit ariſe at the ſame time, will frequently heſitate between different deſires, till a rival has precluded him, or change his courſe as new attractions prevail, and haraſs himſelf without advancing. He who ſees different ways to the ſame end, will, unleſs he
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:1098200104:307"/>
watches carefully over his own conduct, lay out too much of his attention upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of probabilities, and the adjuſtment of expedients, and pauſe in the choice of his road, till ſome accident intercepts his journey. He whoſe penetration extends to remote conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, and who, whenever he applies his attention to any deſign, diſcovers new pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects of advantage, and new poſſibilities of improvement, will not eaſily be perſuaded that his project is ripe for execution; but will ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradd one contrivance to another, endeavour to unite various purpoſes in one operation, multiply complications, and refine niceties, till he is entangled in his own ſcheme, and bewildered in the perplexity of various inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. He will reſolve to unite all the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of ſituation in a new purchaſe, and waſte his life in roving to no purpoſe from province to province. He will hope in the ſame houſe to obtain every convenience, and draw plans and ſtudy <hi>Palladio,</hi> but never lay a ſtone. He will attempt a treatiſe on ſome important ſubject, and amaſs materials, conſult au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and ſtudy all the dependent and colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral parts of learning, but never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude himſelf qualified to write. He that has
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:1098200104:308"/>
abilities to conceive perfection, will not eaſily be content without it; and ſince perfection cannot be reached, will loſe the opportunity of doing well in the vain hope of unattain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able excellence.</p>
               <p>THE certainty that life cannot be long, and the probability that it will be much ſhorter than nature allows, ought to awaken every man to the active proſecution of whatever he is deſirous to perform. It is true that no dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence can aſcertain ſucceſs; death may inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the ſwifteſt career; but he who is cut off in the execution of an honeſt undertaking, has at leaſt the honour of falling in his rank, and has fought the battle, though he miſſed the victory.</p>

IN queſtions difficult or dangerous it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed natural to repoſe upon authority, and, when fear happens to predominate, upon the authority of thoſe whom we do not in general think wiſer than ourſelves.

Vanity might be expected to operate on thoſe who are not reſtrained by any more powerful paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; the mere pleaſure of acknowledging no ſuperior might ſometimes produce ſlight ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities, or the hope of gaining ſome new degree of happineſs awaken the mind to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention or experiment.</p>
               <p>IF in any caſe the ſhackles of preſcription could be wholly ſhaken off, and the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion left to act without controul, on what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:1098200104:311"/>
ſhould it be expected, but in the ſelec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of lawful pleaſure? Pleaſure, of which the eſſence is choice; which compulſion diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates from every thing to which nature has united it; and which owes not only its vigour but its being to the ſmiles of liberty. Yet we ſee that the ſenſes, as well as the reaſon, are regulated by credulity; and that moſt will feel, or ſay that they feel, the gratifications which others have taught them to expect.</p>
               <p>AT this time of univerſal migration, when almoſt every one, confiderable enough to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract regard, has retired, or is preparing with all the earneſtneſs of diſtreſs to retire, into the country; when nothing is to be heard but the hopes of ſpeedy departure, or the complaints of involuntary delay; I have often been tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to enquire what happineſs to be gained, or what inconvenience to be avoided, by this ſtated receſſion. Of the birds of paſſage, ſome follow the ſummer, and ſome the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe they live upon ſuſtenance which only ſummer or winter can ſupply; but of the annual flight of human rovers it is much har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to aſſign the reaſon, becauſe they do not appear either to find or ſeek any thing which
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:1098200104:312"/>
is not equally afforded by the town and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
               <p>I BELIEVE, that many of theſe fugitives may have heard of men whoſe continual wiſh was for the quiet of retirement, who watched every opportunity to ſteal away from obſervation, to forſake the croud, and delight themſelves with <hi>the ſociety of ſolitude.</hi> There is indeed ſcarcely any writer who has not celebrated the happineſs of rural privacy, and delighted himſelf and his reader with the melody of birds, the whiſper of groves, and the murmur of rivulets; nor any man emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for extent of capacity, or greatneſs of exploits that has not left behind him ſome me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials of lonely wiſdom, and ſilent dignity.</p>
               <p>BUT almoſt all abſurdity of conduct ariſes from the imitation of thoſe whom we cannot reſemble. Thoſe who thus teſtified their wearineſs of tumult and hurry, and haſted with ſo much eagerneſs to the leiſure of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, were either men overwhelmed with the preſſure of difficult employments, haraſſed with importunities, and diſtracted with mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity; or men wholly engroſſed by ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:1098200104:313"/>
ſciences, who having no other end of life but to learn and teach, found their ſearches interrupted by the common commerce of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, and their reaſonings disjointed by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent interruptions. Such men might rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably fly to that eaſe and convenience which their condition allowed them to find only in the country. The ſtateſman who devoted the greater part of his time to the publick, was deſirous of keeping the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in his own power; the general ruffled with dangers, wearied with labours, and ſtunned with acclamations, gladly ſnatched an interval of ſilence and relaxation; the naturaliſt was unhappy where the works of providence were not always before him; the reaſoner could adjuſt his ſyſtems only where his mind was free from the intruſion of outward objects.</p>
               <p>SUCH examples of ſolitude very few of thoſe who are now haſtening from the town, have any pretenſions to plead in their own juſtification, ſince they cannot pretend either weariueſs of labour, or deſire of knowledge. They purpoſe nothing more than to quit one ſcene of idleneſs for another, and after having trifled in publick to ſleep in ſecrecy. The
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:1098200104:314"/>
utmoſt that they can hope to gain is the change of ridiculouſneſs to obſcurity, and the privilege of having fewer witneſſes to a life of folly. He who is not ſufficiently important to be diſturbed in his purſuits, but ſpends all his hours according to his own inclination, and has more hours than his mental faculties ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him to fill either with enjoyment or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, can have nothing to demand of ſhades and valleys. As bravery is ſaid to be a pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oply, inſignificancy is always a ſhelter.</p>
               <p>THERE are however pleaſures and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages in a rural ſituation, which are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to philoſophers and heroes. The freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the air, the verdure of the woods, the paint of the meadows, and the unexhauſted variety which ſummer ſcatters upon the earth, may eaſily give delight to an unlearned ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator. It is not neceſſary that he who looks with pleaſure on the colours of a flower ſhould ſtudy the principles of vegetation, or that the <hi>Ptolemaick</hi> and <hi>Copernican</hi> ſyſtem ſhould be compared before the light of the ſun can glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, or its warmth invigorate. Novelty is itſelf a ſource of gratification, and <hi>Milton</hi> juſtly obſerves, that to him who has been long
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:1098200104:315"/>
pent up in cities no rural object can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, which will not gladden ſome of his ſenſes with refreſhment.</p>
               <p>YET even theſe eaſy pleaſures are miſſed by the greater part of thoſe who waſte their ſummer in the country. Should any man purſue his acquaintances to their retreats, he would find few of them liſtening to <hi>Philomel,</hi> loitering in woods, or plucking daiſies, catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the healthy gale of the morning, or watch<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing the gentle coruſcations of declining day. Some will be diſcovered at a window by the road ſide, rejoicing when a new cloud of duſt gathers towards them, as at the approach of a momentary ſupply of converſation, and a ſhort relief from the tediouſneſs of unideal vacancy. Others are placed in the adjacent villages, where they look only upon houſes as in the reſt of the year, with no change of objects but what a remove to any new ſtreet in <hi>London</hi> might have given them. The ſame ſet of acquaintances ſtill ſettle together, and the form of life is not otherwiſe diverſified than by doing the ſame things in a different place. They pay and receive viſits in the uſual form, they frequent the walks in the
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:1098200104:316"/>
morning, they deal cards at night, they attend to the ſame tattle, and dance with the ſame partners; nor can they at their return to their former habitation congratulate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on any other advantage, than that they have paſſed their time like others of the ſame rank; and have the ſame right to talk of the happineſs and beauty of the country, of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs which they never felt, and beauty which they never regarded.</p>
               <p>TO be able to procure its own entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to ſubſiſt upon its own ſtock, is not the prerogative of every mind. There are indeed underſtandings ſo fertile and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive, that they can always feed reflection with new ſupplies, and ſuffer nothing from the precluſion of adventitious amuſements; as ſome cities have within their own walls en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed ground enough to feed their inhabitants in a ſiege. But others live only from day to day, and muſt be conſtantly enabled, by fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign ſupplies, to keep out the encroachments of languor and ſtupidity. Such could not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be blamed for hovering within reach of their uſual pleaſures, more than any other animal for not quitting its native element,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:1098200104:317"/>
were not their faculties contracted by their own fault. But let not thoſe who go into the country, merely becauſe they dare not be left alone at home, boaſt their love of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or their qualifications for ſolitude; nor pretend that they receive inſtantaneous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions of wiſdom from the <hi>Dryads,</hi> and are able, when they leave ſmoke and noiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, to act, or think, or reaſon for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>

               <p>THE regard which they whoſe abilities are employed in the works of imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation claim from the reſt of mankind ariſes in a great meaſure from their influence on fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity. Rank may be conſerred by princes, and wealth bequeathed by miſers or by rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; but the honours of a laſting name and a title to the veneration of diſtant ages only the ſons of learning have the power of beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:1098200104:318"/>
While therefore the love of fame is a motive of action, while it continues one of the characteriſticks of rational nature to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline oblivion, authors never can be wholly overlooked in the ſearch after happineſs, nor become contemptible but by their own fault.</p>
               <p>THE man who conſiders himſelf as conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted the ultimate judge of diſputable cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, as entruſted with the diſtribution of the laſt terreſtrial rewards of merit, ought ſurely to ſummon all his fortitude to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of his integrity, and reſolve to diſcharge an office of ſuch dignity and importance with the moſt vigilant caution and ſcrupulous juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. To deliver examples to poſterity, and to regulate the opinion of future times, is no ſlight or trivial undertaking; nor is it eaſy to commit more atrocious treaſon againſt the great republick of humanity, than by falſify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its records and miſguiding its decrees.</p>
               <p>TO ſcatter praiſe or blame without regard to juſtice, is to deſtroy the diſtinction of good and evil. Many have no other teſt of actions than general opinion; and all are ſo far influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:1098200104:319"/>
by a ſenſe of reputation, that they are often reſtrained by fear of reproach, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by hope of honour, when other princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples have loſt their power; nor can any ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of proſtitution promote general depravity more than that which deſtroys the value of praiſe, by ſhewing that it may be acquired without deſerving it, and, which by ſetting free the active and ambitious who muſt always determine the fate of others, from the dread of infamy, lets looſe the rapacity of power, and weakens the only authority by which greatneſs is controlled.</p>
               <p>PRAISE, like gold and diamonds, owes its value only to its ſcarcity. It muſt become cheap as it becomes vulgar, and will no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger raiſe expectation, or animate enterprize. It is therefore not only neceſſary, that wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, even when it is not ſafe to cenſure it, be denied applauſe, but that goodneſs be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended only in proportion to its degree; and that the garlands, due to the great benefactors of mankind, be not ſuffered to fade upon the brow of him who can boaſt only petty ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices and eaſy virtues.</p>
               <p>HAD theſe maxims been univerſally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:1098200104:320"/>
how much would have been added to the taſk of dedication, the work on which all the power of modern wit has been exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. How few of theſe initial panegyricks had appeared, if the author had been obliged firſt to find a man of virtue, then to know the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct ſpecies and degree of his deſert, and at laſt to pay him only the honours which he might juſtly claim. It is much eaſier to learn the name of the laſt man whom chance has exalted to wealth and power, to obtain by the intervention of ſome of his domeſticks the privilege of addreſſing him, or to venture on an addreſs without any previous ſolicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in confidence of the general acceptance of flattery; and after having heaped upon him all the virtues to which philoſophy has aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a name, inform him how much more might be truly ſaid, did not the fear of giving pain to his modeſty repreſs the raptures of wonder and the zeal of veneration.</p>
               <p>NOTHING has ſo much degraded litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from its natural rank, as the practice of indecent and promiſcuous dedication; for what credit can he expect who profeſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the hireling of vanity, however profligate,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:1098200104:321"/>
and without ſhame or ſcruple celebrates the worthleſs, dignifies the mean, and gives to the corrupt licentious and oppreſſive the ornaments which ought only to add grace to truth and lovelineſs to innocence? Every other kind of fraud or adulteration, however ſhameful, however miſchievous, is certainly far leſs deteſtable than the crime of counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting characters, and fixing the ſtamp of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terary ſanction, upon the droſs and refuſe of the world.</p>
               <p>I WOULD not, yet overwhelm the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors with the whole load of infamy, of which part, perhaps the greater part, ought to fall upon their patrons. If he that hires a bravo partakes the guilt of murder, why ſhould he who bribes a flatterer hope to be exempted from the ſhame of falſhood? The unhappy dedicator is ſeldom without ſome motives which obſtruct, though not deſtroy the liberty of choice; he is perhaps oppreſſed by miſeries which he hopes to relieve, or infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by ambition which he expects to gratify. But the patron has no incitements equally violent; he can receive only a ſhort gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with which nothing but ſtupidity could
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:1098200104:322"/>
diſpoſe him to be pleaſed. The real ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which praiſe can afford is by repeating aloud the whiſpers of conſcience, and by ſhewing us that we have not endeavoured to deſerve well in vain. Every other enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium is, to an intelligent mind, ſatire and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach; the celebration of theſe virtues which we feel ourſelves to want, can only impreſs a quicker ſenſe of our own defects, and ſhew that we have not yet ſatisfied the expectations of the world, by forcing us to obſerve how much fiction muſt contribute to the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our character.</p>
               <p>YET perhaps the patron himſelf may have ſome claim to indulgence; for it does not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways happen, that the encomiaſt has been much encouraged to his attempt. Many a hapleſs author, when his book, and perhaps his dedication, was ready for the preſs, has waited long before any one would pay the price of proſtitution, or conſent to hear the praiſes deſtined to inſure his name againſt the caſualties of time; and many a complaint has been vented againſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline of learning, and neglect of genius, when either parſimonious prudence had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:1098200104:323"/>
expence, or honeſt indignation reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed falſhood. But if at laſt, after long enquiry and innumerable diſappointments, he finds a lord willing to hear of his own eloquence and taſte, a ſtateſman deſirous of knowing how a friendly hiſtorian will repreſent his conduct, or a lady delighted to leave to the world ſome memorial of her wit and beauty, ſuch weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs cannot be cenſured as an inſtance of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormous depravity. It can ſcarcely be expected but the wiſeſt man may by a diligent ſolicitor be ſurpriſed in the hour of weakneſs, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to ſolace vexation, or invigorate hope with the muſick of flattery.</p>
               <p>TO cenſure all dedications as adulatory and ſervile, would diſcover rather envy than juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. Praiſe is the tribute of merit, and he that has inconteſtably diſtinguiſhed himſelf by any publick performance, has a right to all the honours which the publick can beſtow. To men thus raiſed above the reſt of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, there is no need that the book or its author ſhould have any particular relation: that the patron is known to deſerve reſpect, is ſufficient to vindicate him that pays it. To the ſame regard from particular perſons pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:1098200104:324"/>
virtue and leſs conſpicuous excellence may be ſometimes entitled. An author may with great propriety inſcribe his work to him by whoſe encouragement it was undertaken, or by whoſe liberality he has been enabled to proſecute it; and may juſtly rejoice in his own fortitude when he dares to reſcue merit from obſcurity. <q>
                     <l>Acribus exemplis videor te cludere: miſce</l>
                     <l>Ergo aliquid noſtris de moribus.—</l>
                  </q> I know not whether greater relaxation may not be indulged, and whether hope as well as gratitude may not unblameably produce a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication; but let the writer who pours out his praiſes only to propitiate power, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the attention of greatneſs, be cautious leſt his deſire betray him to exuberant eulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies. We are naturally more apt to pleaſe ourſelves with the future than the paſt, and while we luxuriate in expectation, may be eaſily perſuaded to purchaſe what we yet rate only by imagination, at a higher price than experience will warrant.</p>
               <p>BUT no private views or perſonal regard can diſcharge any man from his general obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:1098200104:325"/>
to virtue and to truth. It may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in the various combinations of life that a good man may receive favours from one who, notwithſtanding his accidental beneficence, cannot be juſtly propoſed to the imitation of others, and whom, therefore, he muſt find ſome other way of rewarding than by publick celebrations. Self-love has indeed many pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of ſeducement, but it ſurely ought not to exalt us to equality with the collective body of mankind, or perſuade us that a benefit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on us is equivalent to every other vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Yet many upon falſe principles of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude have ventured to extol wretches whom all but their dependents numbered among the reproaches of the ſpecies, and whom they would likewiſe have beheld with the ſame ſcorn had they not been hired to diſhoneſt approbation.</p>
               <p>TO encourage merit with praiſe is the great buſineſs of literature; but praiſe muſt loſe its influence, by unjuſt or negligent diſtribution; and he that impairs its value may be charged with miſapplication of the power that genius puts into his hands, and with ſquandering on guilt the recompence of virtue.</p>
