            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A SUMMARY VIEW OF THE ENGLISH, SCOTS, and IRISH STAGES.</head>
            <p>THE utility and dignity of the Stage, when properly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted, has never been diſputed in any age or nation, by men of liberal ſentiments in church or ſtate; ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamatory blaſts of enthuſiaſm have indeed, at different times, made virulent, yet feeble attacks, ſome faint remains of theſe now and then iſſue <hi>officially</hi> from Tottenham-court-road and Moorfields inſtructors; but even they only utter invectives to preſerve cuſtom and affected ſanctity, while their hearers, as well as themſelves, laugh at the unneceſſary frivolous delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: the ſtage ſhould not complain of this abuſe, as every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution may be, and certainly is, miſconducted as well as miſrepreſented; indeed as to the ſcandalous, irrational, and moſt illiberal Roman act, adopted ridiculouſly by our legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which ſtigmatizes performers, while not only the matter and manner of their performances have been, and are legally authorized and univerſally encouraged, it deſerves general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and theatrical contempt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Roſcius, Cicero</hi>'s idol, if his profeſſion could be originally deemed bad, ſhould receive no credit from excellence in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing an infamous path; as well might a dexterous highway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man claim praiſe for excelling in actions totally unſufferable.</p>
            <p>Some three years ſince, I publickly invited a bigotted preacher in Scotland, to bring <hi>one</hi> text of ſcripture in corroboration of his rigid opinions; I aſked, if dramatic compoſitions were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with ſtrict chriſtianity, why Saint Paul ſhould have quoted from a Greek author in that ſphere? with ſome other pinching interrogations, which appeared unanſwerable, and occaſioned, what I did not wiſh or mean, the defection of many ſubſcribers to this perſon's preaching, a manifeſt temporal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to him.</p>
            <p>In the courſe of what I have to offer I ſhall be deſultory, conſequently unmethodical; I ſhall produce nothing which does not, in my idea, deſerve notice; but as to arrangement I ſhall let circumſtances and anecdotes fall in as they may, the

               </gap>ubs, ſome gleams of ſunſhine, many ſelf-deluſions, more relative ones, and rigid inſpection into ſocial connections, have made me, I preſume, a tolerable judge of the ſubject I now enter upon.</p>
            <p>From every hiſtorical circumſtance, we have reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that ſuch entertainments as a theatre affords, could not be in a ſtate of regularity or elegance for many years after their exiſtence: the reformation in its infancy, the grand Spaniſh invaſion, not only threatened but proſecuted; theſe, and other ſucceeding circumſtances, all contributed to prevent that juſtice of exhibition for <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi>'s inimitable produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which they deſerved; no amendment could be expected in the quibbling, ſanctified, pedantic, witch-hunting period of <hi>James</hi> the Firſt; as to the miſerable monarch his ſon <hi>Charles,</hi> his time of royalty was ſo perplexed, ſo turbulent, and ſo fatal to himſelf, nothing gentle, elegant, amuſing, or inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive could poſſibly prevail: <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s prevalence, though a glorious aera for the nation, was very unfavourable, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily ſo to the drama after the interregnum, if I may ſo call an admirable and ſpirited adminiſtration of government.</p>
            <p>A volatile, and we may add politic monarch came forward, who perceiving a ſettled gloom on the nation, determined to work a change by introducing the levity of wit, the glare of ſhow, the ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t of gallantry, and a general plan of diſſipation, to ſhake off attention from matters of ſerious concern; if ever the ſtage was proſtituted it was at this time, amidſt a flow of great, of original powerful genius. <hi>Dryden</hi> may ſtand a proof of the whole, who ranted pompouſly, enthuſiaſtically in his tragedies, and deſcended to the loweſt, moſt fulſome ſtuff in his comedies: however in this reign we may commence the firſt degree of theatrical excellence as to performers; and upon a retroſpect, we find great uniformity in the <hi>caſt</hi> of plays, as it is phraſed, every one, like a good ſoldier, kept his place, and by not being <hi>miſplaced,</hi> we may conclude, made a <hi>good</hi> figure; nay, from the beſt accounts, we are taught to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſo, even the printed dramas ſtrengthen this opinion; and this is one of the beſt methods to judge by, both compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively and deciſively, as in examining the preſent ſtage here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after

               </gap>on.</p>
            <p>The aera of <hi>Wilkes, Booth,</hi> and <hi>Cibber,</hi> has been highly bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zened, and there is reaſon to credit tradition in many points; but from the imitators of them I have ſeen (who though they had by no means equal execution, certainly poſſeſſed their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) it was offenſive to chaſte criticiſm; thus <hi>Quin</hi>'s turgid ſwell was derived from <hi>Booth,</hi> who catched his from <hi>Betterton</hi>; young <hi>Cibber</hi>'s caricature grimace, and ſnip-ſnap expreſſion, were but the remnants of his father's oddity; and the late Mr. <hi>Giffard</hi>'s genteel comedy, which he valued himſelf upon, was but a coſtive retail of that formal gentility, which obtained for Mr. <hi>Wilkes</hi> (when full-bottomed wigs, mechanic utterance and ſtiff deportment were in faſhion) general applauſe.</p>
            <p>From their time to Mr. <hi>Garrick</hi>'s introduction of nature upon the ſtage, dramatic entertainments were miſerably man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled amidſt wretched anarchy and moſt diſgraceful manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The Iriſh ſtage, till Mr. <hi>Sheridan</hi>'s aſſuming the reins of direction, was, from all I have been able to learn, ſcarce worth mention; in my own remembrance, four <hi>Elrington</hi>'s, the moſt deplorable manglers of dialogue, ſerious or comic, that ever diſgraced a Theatre-Royal, monopolized all the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal characters; the women were perfect mop-ſqueezers, and the decorations mere puppet-ſhow trumpery: Mr. <hi>Sheridan</hi> laboured for, and in a great meaſure effected, a reformation; if his execution as an actor had been equal to his judgement, and his general ſucce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ſpirit, his condeſcenſion to performers, and his zeal for the ſtage, he would have made ere now a very genteel fortune; but being in ſome points capricious, and rather too fond of rigid exerciſe of authority, he incurred, at various times, very prejudicial public reſentment; and though ſupported by many friends, he was frequently attacked both by public and private foes, 'till at length from a r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>iculous attachment to court principles, (for he was wonderfully fond of a ſmile at the caſtle levees) he drew upon himſelf a ſtorm which blighted all his faireſt hopes, and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>re away with it the fruit of much labour and ſeveral favourable harveſts.</p>
            <p>To this gentleman (for whom I ſhall always entertain a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per degree of reſpect) I ſtand indebted for an introduction to the ſtage, an introduction more like that of a friend than a manager, from whom, had I choſen to ſtay in his theatre, I
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0664401000:6"/>

               </gap>beral encouragement. Here, to anticipate any biographical manufacturer, who might in future, as actor or author, gibbet me up to the view of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, I ſhall give an impartial narrative of my coming into, and general progreſs thro' life, which will naturally take in, by connexions, ſome ſchool-fellows and public cotemporaries, whom I wiſh to preſerve from miſrepreſentation as much as I do myſelf.</p>
            <p>Without any boaſt of parentage, ſuffice it to ſay my father had the general repute of an honeſt man, who, without any brilliance of parts, poſſeſſed a ſhare of ſenſe to command re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, he had ſeen much of the world, and from thence laid in a ſtock of liberal notions; by forty years ſervice in the army, during which time he had ſeen many coxcombs of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, titles, or intereſt, put over his head, he obtained a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's commiſſion; in this ſtation, moſt unfortunately for me, he died when I was but ſeventeen, he was bleſſed with a wife, and I with a mother, who by invariable conduct proved her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a worthy pattern of both characters.</p>
            <p>The 23d of October, 1728, gave me to this mortal ſtage; my ſtate of infancy was moſt affectionately attended to, and by unremitting care, an imperfect conſtitution rendered very ſtrong; at ten, or a little after, I was put under the care of Mr. Butler, a clergyman, who kept a grammar-ſchool in Digges-ſtreet, Dublin; here my firſt acquaintance and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy began with Meſſrs. <hi>Moſſop</hi> and <hi>Dexter,</hi> both within a year of my age; Mr. <hi>Moſſop</hi>'s father reſiding at his rectory, his ſon Henry was ſent to the care of an uncle, who then kept a bookſeller's ſhop, this uncle put him to Mr. <hi>Butler</hi>'s ſchool, and lodged him at an obſcure butcher's in an obſcure market, as I preſume for cheapneſs ſake; not very happy in his ſituation, he frequently, by leave, paſſed a few days at my father's with me, and being of a grave caſt was much liked by all the family as well as myſelf.</p>
            <p>During the ſpace of five years we were inſeparable, and, as I thought, that kind of eſteem daily grew upon us which ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom terminates but with life. At fifteen I had the misfortune to obtain a commiſſion in the ſame regiment with my father, the inconveniency of which ſtation I did not experience till the death of my beſt friend brought it to light; indeed before that melancholy event I began to diſlike the ſchool of Mars, which was then, and I am afraid is too much ſo ſtill, a ſcene of diſſipation and exceſs, exceedingly dangerous for a young unformed mind poſſeſſed of warm paſſions.</p>
            <p>In the year of the rebellion, a camp of 5000 men was formed at Bennet's-bridge, near Kilkenny, which tho' a pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhow, was certainly an idle affair, diſcipline being in a moſt relaxed ſtate; our marchings and counter-marchings, our
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0664401000:7"/>
ſweatings and our ſwimmings, were almoſt as laughable as Major <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>urgeon</hi>'s expedition to Acton, Ealing, &amp;c. however we furniſhed many important paragraphs for the Dublin news<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>papers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one of which I well remember, though we were but fifty miles from the capital, killed 500 of us by an epidemical diſtemper, which had never been heard of in the camp; a ſtrong proof of what authentic intelligence thoſe political ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicles convey.</p>
            <p>From Bennet's-bridge we returned to Dublin duty, here I found Meſſrs. <hi>Moſſop</hi> and <hi>Dexter</hi> members of Trinity-college; the former complained grievouſly at the narrowneſs of his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance; lamenting his diſcontent, in a romantic fit of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, I gave him my commiſſion, purpoſing to accompliſh my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for the church; this circumſtance he has often mentioned, as I have been informed, however he had not intereſt to get the tran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

From Dublin we were ordered into ſeparate quarters, the company I belonged to was deſtined for Caſhell, neither the Captain nor Lieutenant at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending —a pretty circumſtance in time of war! the care of a hundred men fell to my ſhare; the route pointed out our way, and we purſued it with commendable regularity, ſave, as I ſuſpected, the plunder of ſome hen-rooſts; on our arrival at Caſhell, a well ſituated, pleaſant, plentiful city, I received a complimentary meſſage from the new mayor, who was that day giving a feaſt on commencing magiſtracy, to partake of the feſtivity.—I attended, was received with moſt polite hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality, and found myſelf immediately acquainted with near thirty leading gentlemen; thus far was well, but it being a kind of cuſtom in that county to drink a viſiter's ſenſes away, I ſuſtained a moſt formidable attack, ſurrounded by ſeaſoned veterans; at length my prudence, head, and heels gave way, and I fell a ſacrifice to Bacchus, but not till three Aldermen and two Parſons had previouſly fallen proſtrate.</p>
            <p>This was rather an unfavourable commencement; but dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſtay in the place afterwards, I kept rather aloof, and was better enabled thereto by paſſing much time in the family of a gentleman who had three very agreeable daughters, one of whom, tho' at leaſt twelve years older than myſelf, had rearly captivated me; however, Cupid perhaps thinking me a trifling conqueſt, let me for that time eſcape. Dr. <hi>Price,</hi> then Archbiſhop of the ſee, was another ſtrong motive of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention from exceſs, for as that liberal-minded prelate very condeſcendingly gave me a general invitation to his palace, and to ride with him, which took place every fair morning. I was edifyingly drawn from the company of thoſe who prefer hunting and the bottle to every mental enjoyment.</p>
            <p>I was not above four months in this very agreeable, and I may add, profitable ſituation, till my party was ordered to Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſale,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0664401000:8"/>
where a large number of French priſoners were rather refractory. At Corke I found two hundred of thoſe gently waiting to be conducted to Kinſale by me, I took them in charge, but never recollected, till we had marched eight miles, that there was not a grain of ammunition in the whole party; however nothing amiſs happened.</p>
            <p>At Kinſale diſcipline took place, and the young officers were commendably attentive, but being altogether in a meſs we miſled one another abominably, both as to expences and conſtitutions; our propenſity to diſſipation was conſiderably increaſed by the good-natured volatility of Capt. <hi>Henry Boyle Walſingham,</hi> ſon of the then Speaker of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, whoſe unbounded good-nature, and uncommon flow of ſpirits, rendered him amiably deluſive; and perſons who had little but their pay, endeavouring to aſſociate with him, ran into difficulties, which however his generoſity, having a large income beſides a captain's commiſſion, often removed.</p>
            <p>I cannot pay a juſt tribute to the merits of this young gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, taken out of life too ſoon, as with a few more years, and reflection, he would have been a very compleat ornament of ſociety, and a moſt valuable friend to his country.</p>
            <p>While we were at Kinſale together, an account reached us that liberty was given to raiſe two regiments for the Dutch ſervice; being tired of a life ſo inactive in the military view as ours then was, we determined to apply for commiſſions of an advanced rank in one of thoſe regiments, he promiſed to take me by the hand, which would have inſured me ſucceſs, and even offered to aſſiſt with money if any thing of that kind ſeemed neceſſary. The Dutch deſign being dropped on a view of peace, I was fooliſh enough to give a hundred guineas for advance of rank in the ſame regiment, without conſidering it took me from a ſtation wherein I ſtood ſecure from reduction, and placed me in one of the four additional companies, which about eight months after were reduced; here I found myſelf within the penurious limits of half-pay; I had a right to ſome freehold property, but being under age could not diſpoſe of it, and was cheated out of the rent, all but a trifle, by a kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh tenant.</p>
            <p>Here I flew to the ſtage, without any great affection for it as a performer, and found a moſt gentleman-like reception from Mr. <hi>Sheridan,</hi> who judiciouſly recommended <hi>Aboan,</hi> in <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A ſeaſon and a half paſſed without one ſymptom of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition to urge for parts, and at a time when Mr. <hi>Sheridan</hi> had
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0664401000:9"/>
marked out a very reputable caſt for me I declined; ſo preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate a retreat was in a great meaſure occaſioned by receiving a letter, that an uncle of mine, till then totally unknown to me even by name, had died in the Eaſt-Indies, and left me 800 l. this gave me a turn for domeſtic life, as the ſale of my little freehold was likely, excluſive of a 500 l. mortgage, to produce me 700 l. more. When of age, I was adviſed, that on coming to London, or by ſending proper authority, I might receive my Indian legacy; deſirous of ſeeing the Engliſh ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital I ſet out.</p>
            <p>Here I ſhall return a little.—During my connection with the Dublin theatre, I received a letter from Mr. <hi>Moſſop,</hi> then in London, that he had been drawn from Ireland by the invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an uncle, who, as he ſaid, would do nothing material for him; that he had offered himſelf to Mr. <hi>Garrick</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rich,</hi> who both (the latter is not ſurpriſing) deemed him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy acceptance, and therefore requeſted I would mention him to Mr. <hi>Sheridan</hi>; I did, and was informed that a Mr. <hi>Marſhall,</hi> with whom we were both intimate, had previouſly mentioned the matter; I was aſked ſome queſtions, which I anſwered with all the friendſhip and impartiality (my ever fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite principle) would allow. Mr. <hi>Sheridan,</hi> always above en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, gave him a cordial invitation; he came over and had his choice of parts, he very judiciouſly choſe <hi>Zanga,</hi> in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,</hi> and diſplayed in it an aſtoniſhing degree of beautiful wildneſs; his amazing powers of voice were clearly perceived and unanimouſly approved; his action was what in a great meaſure it ever remained, forced, aukward, and unpictureſque; his emphaſis mechanical and laborious; however, a whole pit full of collegians terrified criticiſm from any exertion for two nights; and indeed, his merit went ſo far before his faults, that the encouragement, tho' enthuſiaſtic, was right.</p>
            <p>The ſame week which produced Mr. <hi>Moſſop</hi> to public view, furniſhed the ſtage with another very conſiderable ornament, Mr. <hi>Digges,</hi> who had been an officer; a young gentleman furniſhed with very agreeable and eſſential requiſites, ſuch as a graceful perſon, a comely countenance, marking eyes, and a full-toned, diſtinct, tho' not harmonious voice.</p>
            <p>Theſe two competitors ſet off in the race of fame nearly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and emulated with becoming ſpirit; however, Mr. <hi>Moſſop,</hi> both in diligence and powers, rather outſtripped his competitor, tho' Mr. <hi>Digges</hi> has ſince ſhown himſelf a much more general performer. By ſo powerful a reinforcement Mr. <hi>Sheridan</hi> had a brilliant ſeaſon, nor did he, as has been prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed ſince, bind riſing merit to a kind of an apprenticeſhip, upon penurious terms, he rewarded them liberally, and brought them forward with rapid ſpeed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0664401000:10"/>A ludicrous inſtance of Mr. <hi>Moſſop</hi>'s capricious haughtineſs may, out of many, be produced; after performing the part of <hi>Zanga</hi> three nights, he choſe <hi>Richard</hi> for a fourth appearance, and moſt unaccountably dreſſed the character in puckered white ſattin; Mr. <hi>Sheridan,</hi> very juſtly obſerving that it had a moſt coxcombly appearance, the remark reached Mr. <hi>Moſſop</hi>'s ear, who next morning went to the manager's room, and moſt empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically addreſſed him thus:
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Mr. <hi>She—ri—dan,</hi> I hear you ſaid I dreſſed <hi>Richard</hi> like a <hi>cox—comb</hi>; that is an <hi>af—front</hi>; you wear a ſword, pull it out of the <hi>ſcab—bard,</hi> I'll draw mine, and thruſt it into your <hi>bel—ly.</hi>"</q>
This furious attack was ſmiled off, and had an amicable concluſion.</p>
            <p>A circumſtance here ſtrikes recollection painfully, which is, that ſucceſs, in leſs than a month, raiſed my ſchool-fellow ſo high on tragedy-ſtilts, that a moſt ungracious reſerve prevailed in his deportment, and even to me he was the great man tho' civil. Tho' I ever admired merit, and reſpected pre-eminence, I never did, nor never will, idolize either; this he wanted in both reſpects; I would not flatter, my friendſhip forbad it; he grew ſhy according to the dictates of his pride; thus fell gradually into decay, what I wiſhed, a permanent friendſhip. I may have been too ready to catch offence, but he certainly was too ready to furniſh cauſe; I was rather concerned at ſuch a divorce of an early regard, yet I believe we ſtill entertained good wiſhes for each other, and am willing to ſtile it the jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of two oddities, who had not forbearance ſufficient for each others foibles.</p>
            <p>This ſuppoſed defection of a friend haſtened my expedition to England; I reached Cheſter at a time when Mr. <hi>Macklin</hi> had brought an excellent company to that city, knowing ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the members, and wiſhing to know others, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted my journey a matter of three months, which paſſed pleaſantly and rationally, ſave too great expence, loſs of time, and a near chance of matrimony, which would then have been peculiarly indiſcreet. One leading defect of my diſpoſition has been procraſtination, which has operated moſt powerfully; however I was not totally idle, for during my ſtay I altered <hi>Ben Johnſon's Sejanus,</hi> which I ſhall ſpeak of in future. Juſt previous to ſetting off for London, Mr. <hi>Derrick,</hi> another early acquaintance, purſued my ſteps, not liking the avocation he was placed to, <hi>viz.</hi> that of a linen-draper; very bare of caſh, and little acquainted, I was obliged to ſtand forth for him, which I had great pleaſure in doing.</p>
            <p>Soon after coming to London, for ſake of better air, I took lodgings at Richmond, Mr. <hi>Derrick</hi> remained with me there near a year, and was moſt of the time uſing his admirable talents for puſhing into an extenſive acquaintance, while I, waited with philoſophic patience, tho' not proper oeconomy,

               </gap> the employment of my pen. A ſtrong degree of thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical frenzy having ſeized poor <hi>Derrick,</hi> who, contrary to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               </gap> ſenſe, and void of every executive requiſite, would make a ſtage attempt; in friendly compaſſion I prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on him to aſſume a character wherein his diminutive and deformed figure would not be ſo laughable; he, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence murdered <hi>Gloſter</hi> in <hi>Jane Shore,</hi> and I believe convinced himſelf, a well as the audience, that he could never be beara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for I recollect no ſimilar attempt—well for the ſtage if many others had followed ſo ſenſible an example!</p>
            <p>During my ſtay at Richmond I publiſhed the alteration of <hi>Johnſon's Sejanus,</hi> and from a connection my father had with the <hi>Orrery</hi> family, I dedicated it to the late Earl <hi>John,</hi> whoſe literary abilities, and extreme liberal turn of mind, reflected honour on nobility, and even on the name of <hi>Boyle</hi>; being ever of a diſtant nature in matters of this ſort, I referred preſentation of the copy to Mr. <hi>Derrick,</hi> who never was better pleaſed than when employed in this manner; he brought me a verbal account that my piece was politely received, and that his Lordſhip wiſhed to ſee me at his houſe, then in Leiceſter-fields; I obeyed the ſummons, and never experienced more affability or good ſenſe than at this interview: he was pleaſed to ſay that I had given <hi>ſome</hi> marks of genius, but feared, if I ſhould in future ſhew <hi>much improved</hi> abilities, they would be but of little advantage, for (as he emphatically obſerved) the fountain-head of critical taſte was frozen and benumbed; if you have a turn for politics, continues his Lordſhip, and will proſtitute principle to profit, either for or againſt adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſome lucrative conſequences will doubtleſs enſue; but if you are an honeſt principled writer, ten to one but <hi>laudatur &amp; alget</hi> is a proper motto for you: how far I have found this veri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ied I won't pretend to ſay, but heartily wiſh I had been fated to uſe an awl and end ſooner than the pen, for nothing but a penſioned defender of government, a ſycophant to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagers, or a ſlave to bookſellers, can do any thing more than crawl.</p>
            <p>In about a week after I had ſeen Lord <hi>Orrery,</hi> I received from him a letter, with an order on Mr. <hi>Hoare,</hi> his banker, for twenty guineas, and an obſervation,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"that he wiſhed more ſubſtantial approbation to attend every future production of mine."</q>
After this (the only profit from dedication I ever experienced, and indeed did not expect) I never ſaw his Lordſhip.</p>
            <p>However, Mr. <hi>Derrick</hi> made ſuch good uſe of his firſt viſit, that he purſued, and at length—miraculous to think!—drew his Lordſhip, as well as ſome other diſtinguiſhed characters,

               </gap>nto a cordial epiſtolary correſpondence. A little after this period, I was ſaluted with an account that my legacy was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived and payable; but how was I ſurprized to find, that three <hi>honeſt</hi> lawyers here, had, upon peruſing my uncle's will, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained away 600l. out of the 800l. I expected; this diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable ſtroke precipitated me into freſh diſſipation, which ſhortly narrowed my circumſtances much, and occaſio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed me to accept an engagement for Mr. <hi>Simpſon's</hi> theatre at Bath.</p>
            <p>Before my expedition thither (under the gothic management of one Mr. <hi>Phillip</hi>'s, an old theatrical coxcomb, vain of play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and covetous of money) I had the pleaſure to ſee both town houſes in a very reputable ſtate of performance; but as to tragedy (ſave ſome of Mr. <hi>Garrick</hi>'s peculiar parts, if I may ſo ſpeak) Covent-garden was much ſuperior, in comedy Drury-lane claimed manifeſt precedence; there never was a more maſterly performance than <hi>Every Man in his Humour,</hi> from <hi>Kitely</hi> to <hi>Caſh,</hi> every part was ſupported with a proportional degree of pleaſant propriety.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Moſſop,</hi> who had reached the Engliſh ſtage, had the Dublin audiences approbation cordially, therefore eſſentially confirmed here; yet though he poſſeſſed undoubted merit, ſome ſhare of what may be ſtiled good fortune, attended him in both places, for what the Iriſh <hi>Collegians</hi> began with, animation, the London <hi>Templars</hi> finiſhed with zeal; would he had been as friendly to himſelf as the public was to his endeavours. Here, as in Dublin, too much ill-concerted expence attended his pride, yet I cannot recollect his circumſtances were, at this period, ſo much reduced as thoſe of ſome other ſucceſsful knights-errant of the ſtage I have known; no intimacy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed between us, conſiderably owing, I believe, to my rigid remembrance of his ſudden contemptible exaltation of deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>When arrived at <hi>Bath,</hi> where the campaign was begun, I found a very imperfect odd jumbled crew, and according to many of the undertakings <hi>I</hi> was forced upon, moſt of my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours only tended to make the groupe more ridiculous; for being chiefly in a much varied capital line, I muſt neceſſarily have been often capitally wrong; however, in the moſt unjuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifiable attempts, I always met with forbearance, without the aid of a ſingle puff, or any ſupport from perſonal acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, for I neither ſought, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<q rend="inline margQuotes">"for, ſays he, the people of faſhion come here only to tipple water, or game; and as to the town's people they underſtand little ſave extortion;"</q>
two points I found amply confirmed.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ſeaſon I produced <hi>Zaphira,</hi> a tragedy, on the ſame ſtory of Dr. <hi>Brown's Barbaroſſa,</hi> but performed before that gentleman's piece came out at <hi>Drury-lane,</hi> it was better repreſented, and better received than the <hi>Sultan,</hi> though with leſs profit to me. The ſame ſeaſon I fitted up an alteration of <hi>Shakeſpeare's Richard</hi> the <hi>Second,</hi> which, though incumbered with too many characters of importance, to be adequately ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by a country company (for ſuch <hi>Bath</hi> might then be called) was alſo very well received; indeed the performance of one Miſs <hi>Ibbot,</hi> the beſt <hi>declamatory</hi> actreſs I ever heard, contributed much to the piece's reputation. The manuſcripts of theſe two tragedies have, I know not how, been purloined from me.</p>
            <p>During ſummer, between the ſecond and third ſeaſons at <hi>Bath,</hi> I came to <hi>London,</hi> and found Mr. <hi>Derrick</hi> ſtudying law and practical philoſophy in that agreeable academy the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Several theatrical manoeuvres were practiſed to make me uneaſy, but finding me vulnerable only thro' the ſides of my friends, I was ſo cloſely attacked that way, that an entire breach enſued; and at the end of the ſeaſon I parted with the managers, as they ſtiled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, on terms not the moſt polite, however I was well pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to get rid of ſuch a diſagreeable ſhuffling connection, and wiſhing to ſee <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> a city I had heard much of, I went thither without any public view.</p>
            <p>The place, upon examination, anſwered the deſcription I had heard of it, in the diſpoſal of ſtreets, and elegance of buildings, as well as in briſkneſs of trade and opulence of merchants. I was unexpectedly invited, by ſome gentlemen who had ſeen me in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to ſtay a few months, and aſſiſt ſome perſons of reſpectable families in the proper pronunciation of <hi>Engliſh</hi>; ſome gentlemen of the univerſity ſoon after ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to me for the ſame purpoſe; I undertook the taſk with ſome reluctance, but at length went through it pleaſingly and profitably. Juſt before my departure, it was intimated to me,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0664401000:15"/>
by perſons of ſome influence, that if I would ſettle there, it was more than probable, that a profeſſorſhip for Engliſh ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory might be obtained for me, with a ſettled ſalary, and the advantage of pupils, which I make no doubt would have turned out a comfortable eſtabliſhment; yet, ſtrange is the mind of man, tho' from early years I had wiſhed for a calm retreat, now a very eligible and practicable one appeared, a ſudden wandering ſeized my brain, and I <hi>would</hi> ſet off for <hi>London</hi>; but not without returning warm and grateful acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for favours received, and thoſe propoſed.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Glaſgow</hi> I went to <hi>Carliſle,</hi> over a country rather wild, but good road rendered it agreeable; at <hi>Carliſle,</hi> which is a pretty little agreeable city, peopled with genteel affable inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, but not much enriched with trade, I expected a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance from <hi>Ireland</hi> thro' <hi>London</hi>; I waited a fortnight with patience, then received information that my draft had been evaded; highly chagrined at this, and being ever more prone to revenge injuries on myſelf than other people, I precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tately, in the heat of vexation, joined a company of <hi>Theſpians,</hi> then exhibiting there. This is the only ſcene of real theatrical wretchedneſs, both as to performance and finances I ever met, indeed from the former nothing of the latter could be expected; however I was only a pitying ſpectator of ſurrounding woes, for ſome remains of caſh, and a tolerable benefit, brought me through bareably.</p>
            <p>By means of the philoſophy I always poſſeſſed, upon a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reflection, time would have paſſed agreeably enough here, had not ſympathetic feelings for the penury around me rather encumbered it; two men of the company were rational and well behaved, my landlord Boniface had a ſmart prattling agreeable daughter, and there was lodged in the houſe a very affable young French priſoner; by theſe, with two or three honeſt blades of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> my mind, though not improved, was innocently, and often chearfully, relaxed.</p>
            <p>At the end of five weeks, I received an invitation from Mr. <hi>Whitley,</hi> whom I heard of as, and found to be, a reputable, buſtling, judicious manager, alſo a good actor in his line, out of which the ſtate of his company often forced him, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſometimes inclination; yet this admitted, it is only what much greater performers have been guilty of; many conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable towns have been, and are much indebted to him for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity, good dreſſes, and as ſuitable decorations as they could expect; he alſo deſerves praiſe for ſuſtaining the ſtage with ſpirited reſolution againſt much malevolence and many oppreſſive attacks.</p>
            <p>I took the road to <hi>Scarbro',</hi> which place, as I ſtaid there only a week, I ſhould not now have mentioned but for the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ludicrous affair:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0664401000:16"/>On my road thither, I ſet up at a ſmall houſe, in a ſmall village called <hi>Kirkleatham,</hi> here I fell in, for want of better company, with half a dozen farmers, and ſome ſervants of Mr. <hi>Turner,</hi> lord of the manor; as it has been always an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variable rule with me to conform to the humours of every <hi>ſtrange</hi> company, as one method of knowing the general diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of mankind, I ſaid as they did; this conformity, pleaſing even to brutes, with ſome compliments on Mr. <hi>Turner,</hi> obtained me the titles of honeſt fellow, hearty cock, &amp;c. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by ſeveral ſlaps on the ſhoulder, and ſqueezes by the hand, which, from their roughneſs, I would moſt gladly have excuſed; however this ſocial ſunſhine did not laſt long, for happening to pull out my handkerchief, a piece of paper dropped, on which a perſon had traced out my road from <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſle,</hi> and ſpecified the towns, to prevent my miſtaking a due direction; from <hi>Sunderland,</hi> to the place I have mentioned, is all on the ſea-coaſt.</p>
            <p>Happening to go out of the room, this paper was picked up by one who, for a miracle, could read; they had, while I ſaw my horſe diſpatch a feed of oats, laid their politic noddles together, and, as I found, had diſcovered me to be a <hi>French Spy.</hi> On coming in I perceived looks of great diſtance, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, and curioſity; ſilence reigned for about a minute, when my making the trite obſervation that it was a right <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> meeting;
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Look ye there, ſays the one-eyed clerk of the pariſh, did not I tell ye, neighbours, there are <hi>French Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes</hi> about;"</q>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"ay, ſays another, turning to his right-hand man, I told thee, Giles, the pig-tail was ſuſpicious, and doſt ſee what a ſkeleton it is—he never eat beef or plum-pudding in his life."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Not by any means comprehending theſe disjointed remarks, I applied to my landlord for an explanation; who ſaid,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"we all ſuſpect thee to be a <hi>French Spy,</hi> tho', for my part. I can't ſay but you have called for ſupper like an <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and drank like one; but our pariſh clerk and ſchool-maſter, and the reſt of the neighbours, ſuſpect you to be what I have ſaid; now as I am <hi>conſtable</hi> and magiſtrate, d'ye ſee, in his worſhip's abſence, who is gone to <hi>Richmond</hi> races, I muſt look ſharp;"</q>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Right, Mr. <hi>Conſtable,</hi> ſays a ſmart prig in a green coat and coachman-like wig, 'tis time to be wigilance, I was born a cockney, and know that there man is as ſure <hi>French</hi> as I ſit at this here table; I have a right to be cunning; a'ant I groom to a Juſtice of Peace? and was'nt I whipper-in to the <hi>Lord Chancellor</hi>? ſure I ſhould know law."</q>
In warmth I exclaimed, whip the <hi>Lord Chancellor</hi> and <hi>'Squire</hi> too, for having ſuch fools as you about them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0664401000:17"/>High treaſon was now echoed thro' the room, for calling, a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, retired with no ſmall apprehenſions in their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. My ſupper now approached, and rather laughing upon recollection at ſo ridiculous an affair, I ſat down to it with good appetite, aſking my landlord to partake, who, with the reſolution of a Caeſar, joined me in the attack, declaring he did not think I would do him any harm.</p>
            <p>My room being guarded all night by a couple of ſtout la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers, who firſt ſearched my pockets, and pilfered, as I found afterwards, two very good razors; in the morning I was conducted on horſeback, for there was no juſtice nearer than eight miles: this was the firſt, and indeed the laſt time, I was ever admired by females for my beauty, but they, I ſuppoſe, thinking the rope about my neck, where e'er we paſſed, pitifully exclaimed,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"he's a likely weel far'd mon; its a pity of him, I hope as how may get off;"</q>
on our road too, the tender-hearted conſtable, with a moſt ſolemn face, told me it was a pity that men ſhould be hanged, but it could not be helped, and adviſed me to prepare for the worſt; I have a regard for you, ſays he, for you made me a good reckoning.</p>
            <p>When we came before the juſtice, at a place called <hi>Ayton,</hi> or vulgarly <hi>Yatton,</hi> the matter was ſettled at once, by my ſhowing ſome letters I had about me, particularly one from a gentleman whoſe perſon and hand-writing he both knew. After a ſharp rebuff, and ſome ſevere ſtrictures from his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, upon the conſtable's ill-timed activity, we departed; Mr. <hi>Longſtaff,</hi> with all the penitence and politeneſs which defeated vermin of the law are capable of, declared that we muſt not part till we had drank friends, I rather declined this ceremony, but complied to ſave worſe trouble; half a crown's worth of punch was called for, with ſome cold beef, &amp;c. &amp;c. ſeveral lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicrous obſervations paſſed from my companions, among the reſt, my landlord declared,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"that unleſs I would drink a glaſs of forgiveneſs to the pariſh clerk, who had cauſed all this, he knew the poor man ſo well, his conſcience would not let him ſleep for putting an innocent man in the way of <hi>hanging</hi>; for, continues he, if his worſhip had been as fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh as we folks of <hi>Kirkleatham,</hi> who knows what might have happened?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>Our repaſt over, and a general forgiveneſs both for ſoul and body offered on my ſide, my rejoiced conductor paid the reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning; I offered to be <hi>Yorkſhire club,</hi> but, with a ſide inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he told me, it was not out of <hi>his pocket,</hi> the <hi>pariſh</hi> ſhould pay it, ay, and <hi>his</hi> time, the attendants, horſe-hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0664401000:18"/>
will make up about forty ſhillings—I know how to make up a conſtable's bill. After two glaſſes of the ſecond bowl I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, without a grain of reſentment, and I dare ſay my friends ſtaid, at the <hi>pariſh expence,</hi> till they were as happy as princes.</p>
            <p>Having obſerved that I ſhould, at preſent, only make bare mention of <hi>Scarbro',</hi> let us paſs at once to <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> and open to view a convenient, though not an elegant theatre, with a very good apparatus, and a tolerable company: the ſeaſon was ſucceſsful beyond my expectation, the performers were cordial, (eaſy circumſtances promote good humour) the town's people were affable and ſocial; indeed I never met with more eaſe amidſt opulence, more induſtry with leſs ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſhneſs, or more critical taſte with ſteady judgement, than in this flouriſhing mart of trade; (the great capital excepted) the audiences are liberal without levity, and good-natured without weakneſs.</p>
            <p>During the ſeaſon I produced a <hi>dramatic ſatire</hi> called the <hi>Mentaliſt,</hi> which thro' the uncommonly excellent performance of Mr. <hi>Ryder</hi> (now a <hi>reſpectable</hi> manager, and deſerving actor, in one of the <hi>Dublin</hi> theatres) met a truly favourable recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and rendered me pecuniary advantage.</p>
            <p>By the ſcandalous artifices of a perſon whom I had eſſentially ſerved at <hi>Bath,</hi> by tittle-tattle miſrepreſentations carried to both ſides, near the cloſe of the ſeaſon, a difference, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſerious in its nature, aroſe between Mr. <hi>Whitley</hi> and me; from what I ſoon diſcovered, I found, and acknowledged then, as I do now, that he behaved with ſpirit and candour, while I proceeded with cenſurable impetuoſity, though I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve no animoſity remained on either ſide. At the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the ſeaſon I left his party, determining <hi>again</hi> for Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now, for ſome time, drop myſelf, to purſue Mr. <hi>Moſſop,</hi> and the general circumſtances of the ſtage.—In the theatre both male and female performers are, in general, the moſt diſcontented mortals breathing, the top want to be higher, and the bottom want to be top; I know a performer of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed abilities (no matter for his name) who, four and twenty years ago, lamentingly told me, that he had but one guinea and a half per week;
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"now, continues he, if I could but riſe to <hi>four</hi> guineas I ſhould reach my utmoſt ambition."</q>
This ſame perſon, by ſome happy requiſites, and about ſeven years practice, without a grain of diligence, attained to twice the extent of his wiſh, yet was then as poor, or poorer than when he firſt complained; he has ſince trebled the advantages of his firſt idea, yet though he may live more luxuriantly, I cannot learn that he either has, or ever had, much money to ſpare.</p>

            <p>Hence Meſſrs. <hi>Barry</hi> and <hi>Woodward</hi> who had money to loſe, loſt it; and my old ſchool-fellow, who had little more than public merit and private character to ſacrifice, impaired both very much. During the greateſt part of his mock monarchy he was but ruler of a crew not much above the mendicant tribe; if he had pompous dreſſes for himſelf, an unlimited round of characters, ſome quality acquaintance, (who ſtripped him of more by private gaming than they ſerved him in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic) and the free exerciſe of his own infallible opinion he was happy, though hourly ſolicited by ſtarving actors, and daily watched by keen-ſcented bailiffs; he proſtituted native honeſty, which I am ſure he poſſeſſed, to inſuperable pride and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable obſtinacy. When the diſpoſal of parts was in his own power, thinking the <hi>king's</hi> name a <hi>tower of defence,</hi> he undertook as many things out of his way as he did in it, hence, in the general view, he reſembled a man who wears a ſuit of cloaths of contraſt materials, look at his right ſide he is velvet and elegance, turn to his left, he is coarſe frize, which tho' warm and convenient is offenſively miſplaced.</p>
            <p>For ſome ſeaſons this unhappy, and in the main, <hi>great</hi> man, maintained painful, unprofitable, and perturbed authority; he was all through an entire ſlave to his paſſions, and moſt part of the time a priſoner to his circumſtances; and he who thought one half, if not all mankind, beneath him, could, for occaſional forbearance, bribe and truckle to the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible raſcally ſet of the human ſpecies—need the word <hi>bailiffs</hi> be added</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0664401000:20"/>However paradoxical this may appear, it is certainly true, and ſhows how very contradictory the human heart is often to itſelf; after toiling through much more than I am able, or think neceſſary to relate (<hi>outlines</hi> of miſery are ſufficient) he was ſeized with a malignant fever, which, unfortunately for himſelf, and I may add for all his well-wiſhers, did not take him off, yet ſhattered his conſtitution ſo much, that, to my immediate knowledge, he could never have made in public a figure equal to his original abilities; of this I ſhall mention more, and more properly hereafter.</p>
            <p>My next trip from <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> was to join a company, as it was called, of kidnapped comedians, picked up from <hi>London, Dublin,</hi> &amp;c. led by one <hi>Bardin,</hi> a noted adventurer, who, without any conſent obtained from the magiſtrates, moſt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly and impudently intruded himſelf and unhappy Co. upon the town of <hi>Liverpool</hi>; where the <hi>wiſe Mayor</hi> had, at that time, conceived a <hi>wiſe</hi> prejudice againſt theatrical perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, why or wherefore he knew not, but power is power however uſed. A ſet of people, who innocent with regard to their general intentions, were decoyed there by threats of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, curiouſly fabricated in the chicanery of law; the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers were not only intimidated, but their finances were ſo much reduced, that they neither knew how to return, or how to ſtay upon <hi>honeſt</hi> principles; indeed, I believe two or three were capable of <hi>any</hi> retreat, not poſſeſſing the laſt-mentioned ingredient.</p>
            <p>The principle of ſelf-defence, in the firſt place, and a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial concern for perſons trepanned into a premunire, made me ſtrike out a rational evaſion of that childiſh, or rancorous law, which makes that in common proſecutable, which a <hi>Royal Patent</hi> can ſanctify; my ſcheme was, to ſtile, and to occupy the <hi>theatre</hi> as a ſchool of <hi>Oratory,</hi> for the explanation of moral and practical philoſophy, both according to the ancients and moderns; to render this plauſible, and indeed incontroverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as to both law, equity, and common ſenſe, I gave before each of the pieces, a ſhort introductory lecture upon the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſubject and tendency of the play; a point not amiſs to be practiſed here, inſtead of farcical unmeaning prologues.</p>
            <p>For ſix or ſeven nights that we performed, our little hovel was filled, and every thing bore a pleaſing proſpect as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, nor did any ſtorm immediately threaten our quiet; but Mr. <hi>Mayor</hi>—a wonderful man! thinking the territory of his juriſdiction was invaded, <hi>determined</hi> (ſenſe or no ſenſe) to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the ſame kind of entertainment in winter, which, at a moſt improper ſeaſon (the ſummer) he was an encourager of: to ſay a diſagreeable truth, it was, on good authority, reported that the <hi>London</hi> company, who had been excluded that ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, had interpoſed to effect our excluſion, which took place
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0664401000:21"/>
accordingly, but not in the ungenteel tyranical manner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by our adverſaries; for ſorry am I to ſay, that the late Mr. <hi>Holland,</hi> going from <hi>Mancheſter</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> took <hi>Liverpool</hi> in his way, and offered <hi>liberally</hi> to lay a gentleman, who told me of it, live guineas, that the <hi>itenerants</hi>—what was he at the time? would all be <hi>ſhop'd</hi> (his polite phraſe) in leſs than a week. He was deceived in this point, and would have been in the whole of his expectations, had not a miſerable illiterate wretch, who has ſince played at <hi>Drury-lane,</hi> on being interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated <hi>how he lived,</hi> anſwered, <hi>by the ſtage</hi>; which was equally mean and falſe, mean as he had been inſtructed otherwiſe, and falſe, as it was impoſſible he could <hi>live</hi> by what he in no ſhape underſtood.</p>
            <p>On the day before our defeat (from the above paltry expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation) took place, our valorous manager, ever renowned for being the firſt in, and the firſt out of a ſcrape, ſecreted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as I was credibly informed, in a coal-houſe; and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who now fancies himſelf the paragon of actors—oh dire neceſſity of the ſtage!—ſculked out of town, accompanied by a flimzy female, his <hi>then</hi> wife.</p>
            <p>The noble group of heroes and heroines diſſolved, ſome ſcrambled back to <hi>London,</hi> with this ſmall difference of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, that ſeveral who came down in the coach were glad to return in the baſket; others ſwam upon credit to <hi>Dublin</hi>; while Mr. <hi>Hurſt,</hi> of <hi>Drury-lane,</hi> and I remained; we gave two or three lectures, were indulged with genteel audiences, and put ſome eſſential pounds in our pockets: I alſo delivered two for ſervants, as they are ſtiled, of the company, who I underſtood to be pennyleſs; they were, by this effort, to my very great ſatisfaction, decently relieved; thus ended an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, well conceived, miſerably conducted, and pitifully marred.</p>
            <p>From this mingled ſcene of laughter and woe I went to <hi>Cheſter,</hi> where I again met Mr. <hi>Whitley</hi>; having ſeveral cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial and reſpectable friends in the city, I reſolved to paſs ſome time there as a private viſiter. At my leiſure hours I wrote the <hi>Modiſh Wife,</hi> and though I had no connection with, or emolument from the company, I gave my manuſcript to the manager to uſe it he choſe it; he received the offer po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litely, and got the piece up with care; it was very well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and moſt kindly received for four nights, though full three quarters of an hour longer of performance than in its preſent ſtate; Mr. <hi>Hurſt,</hi> who did a material part, can teſtify this.</p>
            <p>During my ſtay I alſo pieced together a little interlude, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated for an admirable ſet of children, called the <hi>Fairy Court</hi>; this trifle was ſo excellently preſented, ſo indeſcribably ſupported by the little ones, eſpecially by one Miſs <hi>Wheeler,</hi>

            <p>At this period, being near <hi>Dublin,</hi> I was much inclined to viſit my native ſoil, but a freſh and material diſappointment irritated me to a new theatrical expedition, to which I was the more readily induced by the formation of a new company, ſet on foot by two perſons I wiſhed extremely well; I joined the infant ſociety, which was very regular, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>Having, by my own deſire, and on the utmoſt terms of friendſhip, quitted this connection juſt when profits began to be conſiderable, I went from <hi>Scarbro'</hi> (a place like <hi>Bath</hi>) made up in the ſummer of fantaſtical people of quality, and ravenous tradeſmen, who prey on them, let me except how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the ſea-faring part, who are blunt, hoſpitable, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere.</p>
            <p>I now went, once more ſick of public life, to an agreeable and reaſonable market-town, about twenty miles from <hi>York,</hi> called <hi>Malton,</hi> remained there a year, and married a moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving female—excuſe a ſigh and tear to her loved memory— I remained in this domeſtic retreat four years, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced from the inhabitants (ſave <hi>one</hi> with whom I had ſome dealings in the <hi>bill way</hi>) very kind friendly treatment, as alſo from ſome leading gentlemen in the neighbourhood.

            <p>With eſſential philoſophy I looked forward and endeavoured to avoid caſting a glance behind, notwithſtanding a peeviſh ſtate of circumſtances urged perturbation; at this time I waited on Mr. <hi>Foote,</hi> who had the following <hi>comedy</hi> (recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the late Sir <hi>Francis Delaval</hi>) two years in his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion; he waved bringing it out, pleading the inſufficiency of his company to do a five act piec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

equal to every idea of matrimonial happineſs, whoſe loved memory no revolutions, fortunate or adverſe, will ever eraze; great indeed have been the prejudices of mind and circumſtances, accruing from this very fatal and moſt unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected cataſtrophe, health, recollection, and every mental ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion were for ſome months thrown into abſolute confuſion.</p>
            <p>About a <hi>fortnight</hi> before Mr. <hi>Foote</hi>'s theatre began, I was ſtruck with an information that he had no more occaſion for my aſſiſtance; this, at a time of peculiar embarraſſment, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſment known to the manager, was what I could not at that time account for, nor have I to the preſent moment a ſingle idea of explanation.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding I was thus unaccountably detached from a place my warm wiſhes, and utmoſt endeavours were attached to, I wrote intentionally for Mr. <hi>Weſton,</hi> the <hi>Panthe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The ſeaſon before my ſeparation from Mr. <hi>Foote,</hi> I was aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by a moſt friendly line from Mr. <hi>Moſſop,</hi> wiſhing to ſee me at an appointed hour, at Foreſt's Coffee-houſe, Charing-croſs; though ſo long at a diſtance I punctually and cheerfully attended; he received me <hi>like</hi> and I hope as a friend, talked of his theatre in <hi>Dublin,</hi> aſked my connection and ſalary with Mr. <hi>Foote</hi>; I gave him faithful information; he ſounded my inclination for <hi>Dublin</hi> in a theatrical capacity; and ſuggeſted not only my aſſiſtance to raiſe recruits but to accept the ſtile of manager-depute; I declined all but the recommendation of ſome performers, and even there told him I ſuppoſed they would expect collateral ſecurity for payment of their ſalaries; here the great man broke out in the ſyllabled utterance of the word <hi>ſe—cu—ri—ty</hi>; however I ſent two of diligence and

merit to him, warning them of his ſituation, as I never choſe nor ever will be a kidnapper in any ſhape; his being arreſted put an end to the negociation. Two days before he got into <hi>ſalva cuſtodia</hi> (a circumſtance I very ſincerely lamented) in a <hi>tete a tete,</hi> I aſked him why he did not cloſe with one houſe or the other <hi>here?</hi> he obſerved that Mrs. <hi>Yates</hi> was the only thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical lady who could play conſonantly with him, that ſhe was then at <hi>Covent-garden,</hi> and as there was a <hi>particular</hi> reaſon why he could not properly be where Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> was manager (the reaſon I don't chuſe to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>elate) he was indifferent about en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging: I then ſuggeſted his obtaining, which he certainly might have done, licence for ſix nights at Mr. <hi>Foote</hi>'s, after the ſeaſon, by which I told him he might at leaſt get 500l. and if his original powers remained, by preſenting himſelf to public view, might oblige the managers of either houſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with his terms.</p>
            <p>Whether conſcious of that natural inward decay, I plainly ſaw, or rather more plainly heard, or whether through native pride, he replied thus,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"old ſchool-fellow and friend, I would not appear at Mr. <hi>Foote</hi>'s theatre in <hi>London</hi> to clear 1000l. in the time you mention."</q>
—here is a great light thrown on character. After the circumſtance of his bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptcy I ſaw him not, but heard that he paſſed his time depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly in the ſouth of <hi>France</hi>—diſmal ſituation for a proud man! when he returned here I know not, nor did I know of his precipitate decline, however of his penury and obſcure death I painfully heard too ſoon; Mr. <hi>Garrick,</hi> I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, offered to bury him, but an <hi>uncle,</hi> moſt generouſly, took that enormous taſk to himſelf. Here we place to reſt an actor of as great natural powers as ever graced the ſtage for tragedy, and as great defects as ever caſt a damp on merit even in that ſtile—ſhall we, in oppoſition to that charitable maxim, <hi>de mortuis nil niſi bonum,</hi> enter a little into private character, as I wiſh to be done by myſelf, ſo will I do in this caſe, with truth and brevity.</p>
            <p>As a ſchool-boy he was diligent in ſtudy, good-natured, and ſtrictly honeſt, but rather abſtracted; as a member of the college he was tolerably oeconomical, free from debauchery and equally attentive as at ſchool; tranſplanted to the ſtage he almoſt inſtantaneouſly grew ſelf-ſufficient and arrogant, having very little money to command before, and ruſhing into what I may call a profuſion for him, he forgot not only h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>As to his connections with the female ſex I will ſay no more than this, that at the age of eighteen he had, as far as I could judge, a juſt and generous idea of their influence; but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencing

a great man he was intimidated at marriage, fearing any invaſion of lordly rule; however, by credible informa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tions he was a dupe to artful females, eſpecially an old noble lady in <hi>Dublin,</hi> who uſed to make a tolerable audience for her <hi>dear Harry,</hi> as ſhe ſtiled him, and after the play ſtripped him at her route of twice what her intereſt had procured; thus ſtarving actors were deprived of their ſalaries, and the daped imperious manager was worn out of all circumſtances.</p>
            <p>Of his management it may be ſaid, he never conſulted any thing but ſelf, not ſo much for gain as ſelfiſh vanity; from the whole it may be collected that he had original integrity ſtrongly planted in his breaſt, that he was by nature a gentleman, by opportunity and aſſiduity a ſcholar, by uncommon requiſites a great actor, and by particular failings a very reprehenſible man; I arde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat both were very confined; the former ſhould never have uttered a tender ſentiment, the latter ſhould have been entirely limited to pathetic and generous characters; Mr. <hi>Powell</hi>'s <hi>Macbeth</hi> was

boyiſh to the laſt degree, and Mr. <hi>Holland</hi> making love was totally prepoſterous; yet were theſe two the main props of the ſtage in a variety of inconſiſtent lights; death letting fall the curtain of mortality cloſed their ſcenes of action.</p>
            <p>What remained? Mr. <hi>Garrick</hi> ever excepted, and Mr. <hi>Barry</hi> alſo, while he has half a leg to ſtand or hop on.—Mr. <hi>Reddiſh</hi> ſteps forth in <hi>Alexander</hi> when <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> is as far, as with credit to himſelf, or juſtice to the public, he ſhould go in <hi>that</hi> play; Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> did every thing at the other houſe, and every thing the ſame way; Mr. <hi>Cantherley,</hi> another <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital</hi> actor, has figured away in <hi>Hamlet</hi> when <hi>Laertes</hi> would rather overload him; Mr. <hi>Brereton</hi> has—I won't mention for his ſake what he has done; Mr. <hi>Benſley</hi> went to ſchool or college, as I have been informed, with Mr. <hi>Colman,</hi> ſo of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity muſt be as exquiſite in acting as the late manager was, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I promiſed to give ſome light into the <hi>managerical</hi> artifice in making actors ſo exceedingly ridiculous and metamorphoſable; an actor <hi>really</hi> capital is miſſed by the audience, and therefore will have adequate terms, without being under ſlaviſh ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the manager; if therefore an hungry appetite for ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plays, however mangled, prevails through the public, and a man for ſeven or eight pounds per week is ſent on to bungle through principal parts, which, properly ſuſtained, would deſerve twice that ſum, ſo much is really, or ſuppoſed to be, ſaved; beſides a <hi>ſtop-gap</hi> of this kind, ſhould he aſſume any importance, is immediately removed, becauſe next ours may ſucceed him without any public complaint; thus actors and audiences are brought effectually into the gripe of pattentees.</p>

            <p>Here a remark occurs—after Mr. <hi>Moſſop</hi> quitted the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ſtage, his original part of <hi>Barbaroſſa,</hi> which he ſhone ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly in, was ſupplied by Mr. <hi>Branſby,</hi> a worthy man, and very decent actor in his road; Mr. <hi>Moſſop,</hi> with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence I have already mentioned, aſked an acquaintance in <hi>Dublin,</hi> if he could think
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>who</hi> was his <hi>ſucceſſor</hi> in one of his principal parts?"</q>
receiving no anſwer, he imperiouſly, but ſatirically continued,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"the <hi>frigid Branſby</hi> NOW <hi>repreſents Barbaroſſa</hi>;"</q>
incapable politicians have expoſed themſelves as miniſters of ſtate, and why not actors vainly, miſtakenly, or compulſively, render themſelves, or be rendered pitiable and contemptible objects.</p>
            <p>I could point out a number of faults in decorum and enun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, but preſuming I ſhall be deemed rather ſevere for ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much as I have done, I ſhall contract myſelf on theſe points, and only obſerve, that in reſpect of the former, I have frequently and lately, ſeen the ſide wings of a chamber con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued three or four minutes through a grove, a garden ſcene, &amp;c. I have ſeen gothic pillars leading to a ſummer-houſe, and wood wings to a hall; I have obſerved attendant lords and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies pay no more attention or reſpect to their principals, than if they were merely leading puppets; I have obſerved friends aſſiſt <hi>Oreſtes</hi> in his madneſs without a gleam of concern in their countenances; and even pages neglect the trains of queens, though ſpreading thoſe royal ornaments is the only purpoſe they are ſent on for, and indeed neceſſary for a dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified diſplay of figure.</p>
            <p>In point of enunciation the blunders are innumerable, and as to emphaſis the miſapplication incredible, take one inſtance for all; from head to foot it is now become faſhionable, if the words <hi>thou</hi> or <hi>thy</hi> are uttered, to mark them ſtrongly without
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0664401000:29"/>
any doubt of meaning; as for inſtance, our preſent tragedy orators, in ſaying, give me thy hand, though no hand but one is meant, childiſhly, or rather pedantically, pronounce <hi>thy</hi> hand—<hi>thou</hi> art a villain; this, without compariſon, ſhould be directly oppoſite, thou art a <hi>villain</hi>; but theſe, and many other eſſentials, are below the notice of all accompliſhed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible performers, who are as repugnant to the tickling of criticiſm, as a country girl to the approaches of her lover in early hours of cour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſhip.</p>
            <p>Action, one moſt graceful and expletive ornament, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt totally neglected as to correctneſs; a needleſs extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant miſplaced expanſion of arms, is ſubſtituted for that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptive and impreſſive diſpoſition of limbs, which renders the meaning more obvious and delights the view; if the wings of a paper kite (an emblem of ſome arms on the ſtage) did not move ſo invariably, even they would be more diverting.</p>
            <p>Among the heroines, a ſtrange exertion of maſculine geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures take places, which though it may enforce expreſſion, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys eſſential delicacy; there is alſo a dreadful miſapplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here, ſuch as pointing to the ground, or depreſſing the hand when elevation of the heart or mind is expreſſed.</p>
            <p>Standing further back than where the curtain falls, is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other conſtant and very prejudicial error, as in that ſituation the voice is devoured, and the features are obſcured, nay, ſometimes rendered ſcarce diſtinguiſhable, it is alſo very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectionable for thoſe who do, or apologize for, capital parts, to monopolize what they think the moſt favourable points of view; thus a great man ſtands full fronted to the pit, while another character, perhaps of conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>quence, is obliged to ſpeak with his back three parts to the audience, forming a picture rude and unſatisfactory; characters too, in general, pay too little at<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ention to each other, male and female acquaintances in pit or boxes, too often call off eyes that ſhould be rivetted to the ſubject and buſineſs of the ſtage.</p>
            <p>I have freely, and perhaps it will be thought ſeverely, as I have determined to ſacrifice all other feelings at the ſhrine of truth, expoſed the lamentable declenſion of <hi>capital</hi> merit, it behoves me to give ſome reaſon: muſical pieces have been a moſt detrimental alternative, and pantomime, with luxuriant ſcenery, have nearly ſwallowed up all regard for intrinſic ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, and ſmothered every generous, uſeful ſympathetic feeling.</p>
            <p>Before I quit this part of my ſubject, a part diſagreeably inſiſted on, I think it a duty to congratulate the public, the patentees, and the performers, that ſo diſpaſſionate a regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor is appointed at <hi>Covent-garden,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Hall,</hi> whoſe head and heart, from particular knowledge, I can farely pronounce capable of ornamenting any ſtation, except that of a politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, there impartiality and liberal feelings are an obſtacle; I
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0664401000:30"/>
ſincerely wiſh, for the credit of the ſtage, that every performer either would, or was obliged to keep ſo uniformly within their powers as this gentleman does; I cannot be unreaſonable enough to wiſh <hi>every</hi> ſon of the buſkin to underſtand his author ſo well, that never was nor can be.</p>
            <p>Of Mr. <hi>Garrick</hi>'s management, the policy and ſucceſs have been ſo long and ſo univerſally known, that it will ſuffice as a proof of his generalſhip to ſay, that he has often, particularly of late, gained conqueſts without many front rank men; ſorry are all true lovers of the <hi>drama,</hi> that he has condeſcended to call upon, as mercenaries or allies, the patched coat, wooden ſword, Fete Champetre, &amp;c. there is not a ſingle article of that ſort but renders capital acting merit unneceſſary; ſuffer a mourning friend of the ſtage to utter this lamentable truth with emphatic feeling.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Foote</hi>'s inſtitution, extremely peculiar in its nature, is ſcarce deſcribable, I believe he does not wiſh it ſo; if in his temple of Momus, local characters, temporary ſarcaſms, and biting witticiſms, enriched with caricature features and gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mace, will do, the whole end is anſwered; and indeed no place of public exhibition ever anſwered the purpoſe ſo well; let me not here be ſuppoſed ſcanty or churl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſh of praiſe, ſince, according to my own opinion, there is more wit, ſatire, ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and pleaſantry, in the comic productions in this ſwallow ſeaſon theatre, than either of the winter ones, conſidering the quantity of matter produced.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh, Scots,</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſtages, viewed as to critical taſte, a very ſhort opinion will let in ſufficient light upon the whole.</p>
            <p>In <hi>London</hi> the audience are judicious, forbearing, and fond of catching beauties, ready to make every allowance, ſlow to find fault, keen to ſeize all occaſions of applauſe, tardy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, yet treated properly eaſy to forgive; they know beſt what is right, and yet will ſooneſt forgive what is wrong; they are prone to the dignity, but not the malevolence of criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Scotland</hi> they well know bad performance, and bear it with inconceivable ſufferance in public, yet are ſure to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it in private; and if a public conviction generally takes place it is rigorouſly enforced: the point of criticiſm in which they are moſt judicious is declamation, here judgement holds a very nice ſcale, and among them would ſooner gain applauſe for a cool deliberate ſentiment, well delivered, than for all the enthuſiaſtic rants of <hi>Lee,</hi> poured forth with force; their idea of players, in a private capacity, has been much, but juſtly vitiated by the miſconduct of individuals, who, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der public favour and great emoluments, for that place, have ſhamefully evaded the engagements of honeſty, I could name
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0664401000:31"/>
particulars but wiſh to be excuſed; however, be it enough to ſay, that thoſe who ſhould have preſerved the ſtage from ſhame in that part of the world, and had it moſt in their power, have laboured moſt for its reprobation.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Dublin ſtage,</hi> which has been a moſt excellent nurſery for this metropolis, a variety of ſtorms has aſſailed it; ſome owing to proud obſtinate managers, others to proud luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant managers, and ſeveral to proud ignorant managers; to ſay truth, though they are excellent critics in the <hi>Hibernian</hi> metropolis, yet the warmth of paſſion occaſions unwarrantable prejudice and ſavage oppoſition; ſupport is equally violent, and a ſtranger has exceeding fair hoſpitable play: they, as well as we here, have been, from vic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The taſte of <hi>Bath,</hi> in and out of the theatre, is frippery, governed by coxcombly faſhion; people of conſequence there think dramatic entertainments mere time killing amuſement: the box cuſtomers are inattentive and inſolent; the pit and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries, made up of their domeſtics or tradeſmen, are ſubmiſſive and ignorant; if a Lady of Quality <hi>commands,</hi> (a caſe common there) <hi>that</hi> play muſt be liked.

            <p>
               <hi>York</hi> is good-naturedly dull; audiences there are remarkable for fixing public regard on individuals, whom they pronounce incomparable; they are a kind of parents to ſuch actors, and maintain them from youth to grey hairs, even againſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; private character, much to the city's honour, is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly conſidered, and, when good, is ſure to be patronized. Mr. <hi>Wilkinſon,</hi> the preſent pattentee, has given, in a few years, much ſpirit both to the theatre, performers and frequenters of it.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the ſtage—My ſchool fellows <hi>Deuter</hi> and <hi>Derrick</hi> paid the debt of nature under the age of thirty; the former was placid in public and private life, gave no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar offence or pleaſure on or off the ſtage; he was liberal, a gentleman, and a ſcholar; an unhappy matrimonal connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion breaking his temper broke his heart.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Derrick,</hi> when aſtoniſhingly choſen maſter of the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies at <hi>Bath,</hi> without a ſingle requiſite for the place, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed a grateful return, and actually began to make it; but being involved amongſt ladies of eaſy virtue, he ſoon forgot his friend, and ſacrificed his unhappy life to the ſhrine of <hi>Venus.</hi>

                     <p>Very likely, Sir, but to hazard life and limb without hopes of a penſion, is to be mere knights-errant.</p>

                     <p>True; and you have a right to all the favour I can ſhow, for reſcuing me from thoſe whiſker'd huſſars at Warbourg:—what think you therefore of being provided with a good wife?</p>

                     <p>And a ſad ſuppoſition, too Sir, I think, for if ſhe had lived in Scotland, ſome century ago, her looks would have brought her to the faggot for a witch.</p>

                     <p>Has ſhe ſo, Sir? that makes a very great alteration, why ſhe is not half ſo diſagreeable as ſhe was—your honour's humble ſervant is not ſo nice,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0664401000:37"/>
but he can find roſes and lillies in the ſolemn hue of old gold, and the harmony of the ſpheres from chinking of guinea; sbut, Sir, there's one rub ſtill, if I ſhould make prize of this old crazy galleon, I muſt try to keep her above water, as the cargo is to ſink with her; if I could but keep the gold, and ſend her to the bottom, it would be making a good cruiſe of it.</p>

                     <p>Ah, Sir, I muſt be a dull ſcholar, indeed, not to have learned from you how to tickle female ears; and the view of a ſnug retreat, will make me encounter wrinkled cheeks, ſunk eyes, tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs gums, and grey hairs, with as much alacrity as if youth and beauty were the prize.</p>

                     <p>Well obſerved, ſhe is a neceſſary agent, and muſt not be loſt; ſhould ſhe know you in your diſguiſe, you muſt have recourſe to your old method of lying; and if that won't prevail, my purſe ſhall produce ſome irreſiſtable arguments; ſhe is a politic jade, and ſeems to know the value of a few guineas extremely well.</p>

                     <speaker>Fuſee</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, truly, I believe ſhe does, Sir, and tho' poſſeſſed of a nimble tongue, can always be ſilent when intereſt tips her the wink.</p>

                     <p>you muſt not imagine that every cuſtom I conform to commands my approbation; but as peculiarities, however rational, are rather offenſive to the general eye, why ſhould a man render him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf diſagreeably wiſer than his neighbours; it is a peeviſh characteriſtic of age, to idolize the modes of its youth, for my part, I think revolutions in taſte neceſſary; and cannot ſuppoſe, that either the morals, or underſtandings of mankind are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured by a ſocial conformity.</p>

                     <p>To confeſs the truth I believe it may; and among us ſoldiers it is no more than duty; by our commiſſions we are ranked under the banners of fame and beauty, to render the cauſe of the former ſervice, and the dictates of the latter obedience.</p>

                     <p>Touch, why ſhe has ſhot it through and through with Cupid's arrows; made a perfect riddle of it, and, notwithſtanding my love of freedom, I begin to think that matrimony alone can work its cure.</p>

                     <p>Ha! ha! ha! what the gay, gallant, and univerſal lover Colonel Parapet monopolized by a ſingle happy fair one? after all, my friend, I am afraid that roving, diſſipated heart of thine will hardly bear limitation.</p>

                     <p>Why ſo, Sir Charles; when that limitation proceeds from choice; gallantry is a pretty agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able amuſement for ſome years, at a man's firſt entrance into life; but like other light appendages of youth, ſhould give place to more ſerious enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

                     <p>You are right—and ſure no mortal had ever greater contraſt's to deal with; as to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, being young, handſome, ſprightly, and good natured, it is not a diſagreeable point to flatter her vanity; but the old beldam is quite intolerable: however I have warm hopes of getting her off my hands immediately.</p>

I ſhall be ſtill the more like a fine gentleman, and at worſt may make a brazen front ſtand for the unfurniſhed inſide, that's ſome comfort, however; and has been the road to preferment of many an enterpriſing blade,—Soft, let me recollect my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, for what is a military man without his plan of operations.—Fuſee, ſays my maſter, I know women, and he that courts a widow muſt throw aſide modeſty—I know that too, Sir, ſays I, for I have courted, ah, and married, ſeveral of your honours oceaſional widows.—Well, no matter for that, Fuſee, this mother Buſy muſt be taken off at all events; ſhe has received a letter to prepare her for your reception; praiſe her beauty, be very fond, and the buſineſs is done—ay, and when it is done, a hopeful bargain I ſhall have; there will be no need of any death's head but her face; I ſhall never ſee it in a morning but it will put me in mind of the other world; and, to ſay the truth, I have not much inclination to think that way yet; but, damn it, the hopes of plunder have made many a man run his head againſt cannon balls; then why ſhould I be afraid of a witch? ſo moſt engaging, glib-tongued ancient Lady—have at you.</p>

                     <p>Why, my Lord, it is part of a ſoldier's profeſſion; the indulgence of peace for his fatigues in war, and it would be ungrateful to reject the bleſſing; beſides, Mars and Venus ſhould never be divorced; for whatever may be ſaid of glory's charms, I believe there is more courage derived from the influence of corporeal beauty, than from the love of fame; nor can any better reaſon be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, why Britons are the braveſt of men, than that nature has bleſſed them with the faireſt of women.</p>

                  <stage>SIR CHARLES and the COLONEL.</stage>
                  <p>DEAR Colonel, this unexpected rival of yours adds to my own perplexity; but from the idea I have of your miſtreſs, I think your happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in no danger.</p>
                  <sp>

                     <p>There it is; every man thinks his own caſe worſt; miſchief on it, I am chiefly vexed, that after ſuch experience I ſhould let any attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have power to perplex me—however I threw what objections I could in the way.</p>

                     <speaker>Col.</speaker>
                     <p>Why I gave as unfavourable an idea as I could of the family—nay, went ſo far as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict my heart in regard of Emmeline's beauty and merit—but, Sir Charles, in my confuſion I had forgot to tell you that Lady Charlotte's expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition into the country is upon a treaty of marriage.</p>

                     <p>Sdeath! it cannot be! what, after permitting my addreſſes with moſt engaging con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion; after intimating I was not diſagreeable to her, and giving delicate hopes of a happy iſſue; after all this to change without the ſmalleſt pretext of offence, or aſſigning the ſlighteſt reaſon.</p>

                     <p>So, my friend, it appears at preſent—you know the brother could not have any view, and he mentioned it with a tender ſenſe of your diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.</p>

                     <p>I am afraid, Sir Charles, that revenge will light upon yourſelf—faſhion and ſpirit will only laugh at your ſincere eaſy diſpoſition.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir Char.</speaker>
                     <p>Shall I therefore tamely bear ſuch an inſult to my heart and affections? if I can't pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the match I'll at leaſt render it as diſagreeable as may be; I'll take poſt for the Earl's tomorrow morning, lay my previous claim before him, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid her inconſtancy, and, if the new lover ſhould have ſpirit enough to appear, convince him I am not that commodious paſſive utenſil ſhe would make of me.</p>

                     <speaker>Col.</speaker>
                     <p>I applaud your reſolution; and if you have any occaſion for an auxiliary ſword you know where to find it: in the mean time I think you had better find Lord Frederic and receive fuller infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation from him; beſides, if you can detain him for the evening it may be of ſingular ſervice to me.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir Char.</speaker>
                     <p>The latter motive alone is ſufficient to excite my diligence; for, reſt aſſured, dear Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, that whatever my croſs ſtars deſign for me, I heartily wiſh your affairs may feel the influence of a propitious planet.</p>

                     <p>Sir Charles good morning—I have, according to promiſe, prepared a letter for my ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Charlotte, wherein I have enlarged upon your previous pretenſions as much as poſſible.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir Char.</speaker>
                     <p>I am infinitely obliged to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; but upon ſecond thought, I have determined not to offend Lady Charlotte by a viſit.</p>

                     <speaker>L. Charlo.</speaker>
                     <p>Your reſolution ſo warmly urged is very ſoon changed, Sir.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir Char.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, my Lord, upon cool deliberation, I think it better not to proceed any further in the affair; 'tis poſſible I might have interpreted the Lady's good nature too partially in my own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; and as freedom of choice is undoubtedly juſt, it would be rude and cruel to interrupt her preſent ſcheme of happineſs.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. Charlo.</speaker>
                     <p>You are of a very happy diſpoſition, Sir Charles, that can ſo ſoon, and ſo coolly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile an affair which ſeemed ſo intereſting—</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir Cha.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, my Lord, I am tolerably philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical in theſe matters; beſides, to own the truth, I had, amongſt other converſation, talked ſo much of love to Lady Charlotte that I fancied our hearts engaged when there was nothing meant, I believe, but a little faſhionable gallantry.</p>
