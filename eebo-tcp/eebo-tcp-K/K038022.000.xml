            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Short, ſenſible, and to the purpoſe! I like it well; and, from it's contents, believe I ſhall not give your rhetoric, child, much trouble, as I find myſelf more than half inclined to give my conſent already.</p>

                  <p>Her good wiſhes for my happineſs, Sir, may make her perhaps freer than is becoming; you muſt excuſe her, therefore, for my ſake: and as I have no reaſon to doubt the ſincerity of Sir John, let me pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail on you to ſee him; for I confeſs he won my heart when I had not a hand to give him.</p>

                  <p>Well, Sir; but will it not be time enough to refuſe when he makes the requeſt?</p>

                  <speaker>Sir Jacob.</speaker>
                  <p>No, child; a requeſt in money-matters is better prevented than refuſed: Therefore you had better ſend and let him know I am at home, and ſhall be glad to ſee him; and the ſooner the better; for delays, I find, are dangerous.</p>

                  <p>And now I'm alone, I may ſafely examine neighbour Heeltap's rent; for "Count money, they ſay, after your father;" aye, and weigh it too, as the world goes, if you would avoid being cheated: And yet, after all our care and caution, a light guinea, I ſee
<stage>[taking one in his hand],</stage> will be creeping in. This knave of a Criſpin had but five pounds to pay me for a whole year's rent, and three out of the five I ſee are ſhort

<stage>[as he returns to the table, hears a knocking.]</stage> Mercy on me! what vile noiſe is that I hear? Upon theſe occaſions, a man's money

                  <speaker>Sir Jacob.</speaker>
                  <p>She has no money, Sir John; a right philoſopher; ſhe carries all ſhe has about her. But then ſhe's a girl of ſuch prudence—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir John.</speaker>
                  <p>And that's a rare quality in this age.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Jacob.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, ſhe is prudence itſelf; writes an admirable hand, and caſts accounts like a broker.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir John.</speaker>
                  <p>Uncommon talents theſe.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Jacob.</speaker>
                  <p>And then ſhe works with her needle like a nun.</p>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Jacob.</speaker>
                  <p>And, in my mind, as good, if not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually better, than money. Why, prudence is worth at leaſt a hundred a-year, and a hundred a-year in the three and a half <hi>per cent.</hi> is worth 3000l. there's one item. Writing will ſave a ſteward's wages; that's 50l. a-year; and, in the three and a half <hi>per cent.</hi> is worth at leaſt 1500l; there's another item. Needlework is dear now; her needlework is worth at leaſt 60l. a-year; 60l. a-year, long annuities, is 1500l. more. So you ſee, Sir John, there's a fortune of 6000l. paid down at once; no bonds, no mortgages, all ready money; prompt payment, Mr. Wentworth.</p>

                  <speaker>Wentworth.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, Sir Jacob; I know you are the moſt fortunate man in the world, in having ſuch a ſon-in-law; in himſelf amiable, in his family noble, in his fortune independent.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir Jacob.</speaker>
                  <p>Say you ſo? why then, if he ſettles her fortune upon her for life, and his own upon firſt and other ſons in tail-male, I think I may venture to give my conſent without further enquiry. And ſo, Sir John, and daughter Flavia
<stage>[as they come forward],</stage> as the making of others happy is two and a half <hi>per cent.</hi> better than making one's ſelf ſo; why, you have my conſent to marry when you pleaſe. In the mean time, that I may not retract, being old, and have gotten but a ſhallow memory, with your leave, Sir John, we will enter into a bit of a contract, which our friend Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth here will witneſs on your part, and I on that of my daughter.</p>

                  <p>NEVER, ſure, was Hounſlow poſt-horſe more weary in going a double ſtage, than I in waiting for this ſame maſter of mine. After a journey, to <hi>take</hi> ſome refreſhment ſuits moſt travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers; yet he <hi>takes</hi> nothing here, but his portmanteau and humble ſervant, then inſtantly ſets out to pay a viſit to a covetous old dog of a miſer, who knowing perſons of my rank and order are at board-wages, would ſooner ſee a ſtranger break his neck in his houſe than his faſt. I can bear this airy diet no longer; I will e'en go and appeaſe the angry tumults within, by finding ſome diverſion for my teeth
<stage>[going, ſtops].</stage> But who have we here?</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>Arrah! my dear maſter, your portman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau is ſo mortal heavy, and little Timſey has padded ſo far with it, he muſt be after giving his ſhoulders a holiday awhile

                  <speaker>Trimwell.</speaker>
                  <p>An excellent Hotel, Sir, I aſſure you: Good beds, handſome furniture, a man-cook, and civil waiters; lodging ſit for an Ambaſſador at leaſt.</p>

                  <p>It being my misfortune (as it is that of many others) to have the appetite of a gentleman, without the eſtate, I am; and in my ſervices, Sir— <hi>clock-like</hi>—to be ſet a-going either backward or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, at a maſter's pleaſure.</p>

                  <speaker>Trimwell.</speaker>
                  <p>Coming, Sir, of a running generation, I have been of the trade ever ſince I could go.</p>

                  <speaker>Trimwell.</speaker>
                  <p>Even ſo, Sir. My father was ticket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter to one of the inns of court; my mother went out a-waſhing; and, when with-child of me, a few ſhirts being miſſing from one of her cuſtomers, out of pure modeſty, ſhe fairly run the country; ſo that you ſee, Sir, I was born to my trade, and have it by birth and education.</p>

                  <p>Let me ſee; three guineas a-month, and a bachelor's ſineture place? No bad circumſtance this of the port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manteau, I think; times are preſſing, and behoves men of my induſtry to look about them.

And as you ſay you have ſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him, if you ſhould chance to meet him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſee him, let me intreat you to tell him, that if he merits the hand he aſpires to, Sir John Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour expects to hear from him as a man of honour ought, who glories in being his rival, and hope my
