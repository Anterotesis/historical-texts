            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE eager and almoſt univerſal Curioſity, which the late <hi>Inſtallation</hi> of the <hi>Knights of the Order of the Garter</hi> excited in the <hi>Publick,</hi> ſeemed in a manner to command our Attention, and juſtify our Endeavors to exhibit a Repreſentation of it in the following Maſque: The Difficulty was to give an adequate Idea, in a ſmall Compaſs, of the various Circumſtances of this great Solemnity, conſiſting of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtallation, Proceſſion,</hi> and <hi>Feaſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The late Mr. <hi>Gilbert Weſt,</hi> publiſhed, ſome Years ago, a Dramatick Poem called <hi>The Inſtitution of the Order of the Garter,</hi> which has been much admired: It was, however, impoſſible to bring it on the Stage as it was originally written, becauſe, though rich in Machinery, it was little more than a Poem in Dialogue without
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0628600500:5"/>
Action: Some ſelect Parts of it however, with a few neceſſary Alterations, and the Addition of ſome comic Scenes, were thought a proper Vehicle for the different Ceremonies of this great Feſtival. The Scene is laid in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, who was the Founder of the Order, after having reſtored that of the <hi>Knights of the Round Table,</hi> which we have ſuppoſed, with ſome Writers, to be continued at the Inſtitution of the Garter.</p>
            <p>No Expence has been ſpared, nor, we hope, any Object of Attention overlooked, which might conduce to make the following Maſque as ſhort, as various, and as faithful to the original Inſtitution as poſſible.</p>
            <p>The Songs, Choruſes, and Serious Dialogue are publiſhed, that they may be better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood from the Stage. The comic Parts which are intended merely for the Preparation of the principal Scenes, are not printed, as they would loſe much of their Effect by being ſeparated from the Action of the Performer.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Weſt,</hi> in order to give a greater Variety and to introduce ſome particular Characters into
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0628600500:6"/>
his Poem, has taken (as he acknowleges in a Note) the Advantage of a Licence uſually allowed to Poets, of departing a little from Chronology, and poſtponing the Inſtitution of the Order for a few Years.</p>
            <p>Under the Sanction of this Authority, we have ventured to make uſe of the ſame poetical Licence, by throwing the Inſtitution of the Order as many Years backward, as Mr. <hi>Weſt</hi> has brought it forward. We have made the Black Prince nine Years younger than he was, when he was Knighted; and we flatter ourſelves that this Anachroniſm will be excuſed for the Sake of the Application.</p>
            <p>Some other Liberties of leſs Conſequence are neceſſarily taken for the Sake of rendering the whole more Theatrical; we have had too long an Experience of the publick Indulgence, not to know that they will be readily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked, ſhould the reſt of the Performance have the good Fortune to be approved.</p>

               <hi>The following</hi> EXTRACTS <hi>from</hi> Selden's Titles of Honor, <hi>and</hi> Aſhmole's Order of the Garter, <hi>are inſerted to ſhew the Authority upon which we have founded ſome Part of our</hi> Inſtallation.</head>
            <q>
               <p>AND ſo much the rather alſo, becauſe we know by others of our own country, that in the ſelf-ſame year, a ſolemn and great meeting of Knights was appointed by the King at Windſor Caſtle, for the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up of his <hi>Round Table</hi> there, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And it ſeems that out of the plot and purpoſe of this <hi>Round Table</hi> at Windſor, erected in the ſame year wherein the Order of the New Garter was inſtituted and appointed to be celebrated on St. George's day of the ſame year, as we may collect out of Froiſſart alſo, the Order itſelf had chief part at leaſt of its original. And the other traditions touching the Garter of the Queen, or of the Counteſs of Kent and Saliſbury, may well ſtand with this, thus far, that the word and the uſe of the Garter, began as the traditions ſuppoſe, but that the Order was raiſed chiefly out of this of the <hi>Round Table</hi> of that time, as out of a Seminary. For the <hi>Round Table</hi> was in ſpecial uſe in thoſe ages, for the drawing together of the braver Knights and Ladies, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Froiſſart likewiſe ſays, <hi>Et ordonna</hi> (Edward the Third) <hi>que d'an en an le jour Saint Gregore, s'en feroit la feſte dedans le chateau de Vindeſore, le quell chateau le Roy Artur avoit fait faire autreffois edifier et in icelui tenir la noble Table ronde,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>King Edward the Third having deſigned to reſtore the honor of the <hi>Round Table,</hi> held a juſte at Windſor, in the 18th year of his reign, (but there is an old manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript chronicle that has theſe words: King Edward in his 19th year begun his <hi>Round Table,</hi> and ordained the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0628600500:21"/>
day annually to be kept there at Whitſuntide) and this meeting, in truth, occaſioned the foundation of the moſt noble Order of the Garter, as ſhall be noted by and by.</p>
               <bibl>
                  <hi>Aſhmole,</hi> edit. 1672, pag. 96.</bibl>
            </q>
            <q>
               <p>He (Edward the Third) did thereupon firſt deſign (as being invited thereto by its antient fame) the reſtauration of King Arthur's <hi>Round Table,</hi> which he exhibited with magnificent haſtiludes and general juſts, to invite hither the gallant and active ſpirits from abroad; and upon diſcovery of their courage and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the exerciſe of arms, to draw them to his party, and oblige them to himſelf.</p>
               <p>Though King Edward ſo far advanced the honor of a Garter, as that the Order did derive its title and denomination from it; yet it is moſt evident, that he founded this more famous Order, not to give reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to, or perpetuate an effeminate occaſion, but to adorn martial virtue with honor, rewards, and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor: to increaſe virtue and valour in the hearts of his nobility; or, as Andrew du Cheſne ſaith, to honor military virtue with ſome glorious favours and rewards; that ſo true nobility (as is noted in the preface to the black book of the Order) after long and hazardous adventures, ſhould not enviouſly be deprived of that honor which it hath really deſerved; and that active and hardy youth might not want a ſpur in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of virtue, which is to be eſteemed glorious and eternal.</p>
               <p>Upon theſe grounds no doubt does our learned Selden affirm, that this Order was raiſed chiefly out of the <hi>Round Table</hi> of that time (the Knights thereof being in the flower of that age) as out of a ſeminary. </p>
