            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>BEfore we come to give an Account of this our New Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod for the Diſcovery of the Longitude, both by Sea and Land, which we here take leave humbly to propoſe to the Conſideration of the Publick, we think it reaſonable to premiſe ſomewhat by way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction: To give ſome Account of the Nature of the Problem before us; to ſpeak a little of the Methods hitherto try'd, and the Reaſons of their ill Succeſs; and to add a brief Hiſtorical Narration, from what Occaſions and by what Steps this
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0161901100:5"/>
our Method was firſt diſcover'd, and has arriv'd at its preſent Degree of Maturity.</p>
            <p>As to the Problem it ſelf, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of the Longitude; it is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this: To diſcover in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure a like ſure way of frequently knowing, how far we are diſtant, on the Earth Spherical Surface, in Degrees, from any known Meridian, Eaſtward or Weſtward; as we can eaſily know, almoſt at any time, how far we are diſtant, in Degrees, on the ſame Surface, from the middle Circle or Equator, Northward or Southward. Now in this Caſe it muſt be noted, that as the Diurnal Motion does naturally imply fixed Poles, and a fixed Equator; which infer a different Meridian Altitude of thoſe Poles, and of that Equator, and by conſequence of all the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Bodies, in different Latitudes; which different Altitude may in clear Weather be eaſily obſerv'd by proper
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0161901100:6"/>
Inſtruments, and thereby that Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude may be readily diſcovered; ſo does not the ſame Diurnal Motion at all imply any <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> whence the Longitude may be diſcover'd to us: Becauſe the ſame Parallel ſtill bears, through its whole Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, the ſame Relation to thoſe Poles and that Equator, without any Difference. The Diurnal Motion therefore, which affords an obvious Foundation for the Invention of the Latitude of every Place on the Earth, affords us no ſuch Foundation for the Invention of the Longitude of the ſame Places. Nor is it therefore an eaſy Problem, either aſtronomical or practical to diſcover the ſame.</p>
            <p>As to the Methods hitherto tryed, they are either Celeſtial, or Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial; and may be reduc'd to theſe Seven, Four that are <hi>Celeſtial,</hi> and Three that are <hi>Terreſtrial.</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>(1) The Eclipſes of the Moon.</item>
                  <item>(2) The Eclipſes of the Sun.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0161901100:7"/>
(3) The Eclipſes of Jupiters Planets.</item>
                  <item>(4) The Motion of the Moon.</item>
                  <item>(5) The Variation of the Needle.</item>
                  <item>(6) Clocks, or Watches.</item>
                  <item>(7) The Log Line or Dead Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, The Eclipſes of the Moon are uſeful for the Longitude. For its Immerſions into the Earths Shadow, its neareſt Diſtances to that Center, and its Emerſions therefrom, are all at diſtinct and known Points of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute time. So that where and when they can be nicely obſerv'd; and the Difference of the apparent times at every Meridian noted; the reſpective Longitudes of thoſe Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may be thereby found in time; and by allowing 15 Degrees of the Equator to an Hour, may be found in Degrees alſo.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in the ſame manner may the Eclipſes of the Sun be made uſe of; eſpecially as now improv'd by our great Aſtronomer Mr. <hi>Flamſteeds</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0161901100:8"/>
               <hi>Conſtruction</hi> of them; and as they will, we hope, be farther improv'd by Mr. <hi>Whiſtons</hi> actual <hi>Exhibition</hi> of them, in his Inſtrument, juſt ready for Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication. Which Method, by the Difference of the apparent time of any Part of the Eclipſe in different Places, gives the Difference of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridians, or of Longitude in the like manner as before.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Eclipſes of Jupiters Satellits afford another like Method for the Diſcovery of the Longitude; and that on the ſame Foundation with thoſe of the Moon.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the Motion of the Moon, with its Diſtance from the Sun, or rather its Appulſe to and Occultation of thoſe fixed Stars that ly along its Courſe, is another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Method for this purpoſe; and is of the ſame Nature with the Eclipſes of the Sun as to this matter.</p>
            <p>Theſe Four may juſtly be called <hi>Celeſtial,</hi> or <hi>Aſtronomical</hi> Methods of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0161901100:9"/>
diſcovering the Longitude, becauſe they make uſe of the Celeſtial Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, or of the Stars in order to that End. The Three <hi>Terreſtrial</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods are as follows.</p>
            <p>5ly, The Variation of the Needle from the North is now, eſpecially ſince Dr. <hi>Halleys</hi> noble Obſervations and Map thereto relating, become one Method for the Diſcovery of the Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude; particularly in thoſe Parts, where that Variation is beſt known, and the North and South Poſition of its Lines are moſt remarkable. For by croſſing the Meridians there, you alſo croſs the Curves of equal Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation, and diſcover in ſome meaſure your Longitude thereby.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, The Uſe of Clocks or Watches at Sea is another Method; and was attempted by the famous <hi>Hugenius.</hi> And indeed if they could be exactly kept to an even motion, and ſo ſhew the Hour at any one certain place at Land; the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0161901100:10"/>
of the Time known by that Clock or Watch, with the apparent time at the Ship known by the Sun or Stars, or another Clock or Watch regulated by them, would diſcover the Longitude from the Place to which that firſt Clock or Watch was adjuſted, in time, and ſo, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in Degrees alſo.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, The Log-line and Dead Reckning, when all fails, is the laſt Remedy in this caſe; and from thence the Seamen gueſs, as well as they can, by the Angle and length of their Courſe, what Longitude and Latitude they are in: And when by Obſervation they find their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in Latitude, they conclude up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a proportionable one in Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude alſo. And ſo for want of a ſure Guide, either Celeſtial or Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtial, they are forc'd to depend on this; which yet is, as well as the reſt, very uncertain and inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0161901100:11"/>
For to come to the Reaſons of the ſmall Succeſs of theſe ſeveral Methods.</p>
            <p>As to the two firſt, the Eclipſes of the Sun and Moon; to ſay nothing here of the ſlowneſs of the Moon's Motion, which renders any great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of exactneſs impoſſible; or of the difficulty of Calculation and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, eſpecially in the Sun's E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſes; and of Obſervations in both: The ſingle rareneſs of theſe Eclipſes, which is not ſeldom made ſtill rarer by cloudy Weather, renders them of very little uſe in Navigation.</p>
            <p>As to the third Method, by the Eclipſes of <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s Planets; this muſt be own'd of much greater uſe: Since the quickneſs of their Motion, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as to the innermoſt, makes the Moment of their Immerſion into, or Emerſion from <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s Shadow ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſtinct and nice; and their fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency, which is almoſt one for every Day, renders them fit for the conſtant uſes of Navigation. Nor
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0161901100:12"/>
have we hitherto had any other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod ſo uſeful at Land as this. Yet are there great Difficulties belonging to this Method; eſpecially at Sea. The beſt Tables of their Motions are hitherto too imperfect to be at all times depended on, as to the exact abſolute Time of their Celebration: And they require Teleſcopes of ſuch a length as have not hitherto been manageable at Sea, in that ſtate of Toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and Agitation, which Ships there are ſubject to: Which difficulties, added to the impoſſibility of ſeeing theſe Eclipſes for about three Months every Year, when <hi>Jupiter</hi> is near the Sun, renders this Method at preſent of ſmall uſe in Navigation.</p>
            <p>Nor can the fourth Method, or the diſtance of the Moon from the Sun, with its Appulſe to, or Occultation of thoſe fixed Stars, which lye along its courſe, give us the Longitude to ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient exactneſs. For, to ſay nothing here of the ſlowneſs of the Moon's
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0161901100:13"/>
Motion, the want of the utmoſt accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of even the place of ſome of theſe fixed Stars themſelves, and of the Sun it ſelf; or of the neceſſity of the uſe of ſmaller Teleſcopes, even in this Caſe, as well as of the trouble of the Calculation and Conſtruction, which are leſſer Difficulties here alſo; 'Tis plain the Theory of the Moon, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in ſome poſitions, is not exact enough hitherto for our purpoſe; as not ſerving for this Longitude nearer than to two or three Degrees: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Seamen want it within one Degree, or leſs. Tho' indeed it muſt be allow'd, that if the Moon's The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory could be once ſo far perfected, that its place might be with certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty calculated nearer than to two Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes of a Degree, this would be a very uſeful Method in order to the Diſcovery of the Longitude at Sea. Which Improvement therefore of it's Theory is a thing highly deſireable in Aſtronomy.</p>
            <p>

We come now to the <hi>Terreſtrial</hi> Methods, and to thoſe difficulties which render them alſo incapable of diſcovering the Longitude, with that certainty, and to that degree of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs, which the purpoſes of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation require. Thus the Curve lines of the Variation of the Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, which is the firſt Terreſtrial Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, are of ſmall uſe, becauſe the Laws of that Variation are not yet brought to a ſufficient certainty, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the moſt uſeful endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of Dr. <hi>Halley</hi> in that Matter: The Neighbourhood of Iron Mines, of Iron, or of Loadſtones themſelves, does ſometimes diſturb the general Rules, and deceive the Obſervers of that Variation: The Poſition of thoſe Curves, too far Eaſtward and Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, in a great part of the World, renders this Variation uſeleſs as to any general Diſcovery of the Longitude: and even there where the Poſition of theſe Curves is the moſt advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0161901100:15"/>
as it is about the Cape of Good Hope, and a conſiderable way on both ſides of it, yet is the diſtance of thoſe Curves for the difference of one De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Variation, about 100 Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphical Miles, <hi>i. e.</hi> near two Degrees of a great Circle; and ſo this Method is incapable of ſhewing the Longitude very nicely in any Caſe whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Thus the ſecond Terreſtrial Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, by Clocks or Watches, tho' the eaſieſt to underſtand and practice of all others, has been ſo long in vain attempted at Sea, that we ſee little Hopes of its great uſefulneſs there. Watches are ſo influenc'd by heat and cold, moiſture and drought; and their ſmall Springs, Wheels, and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vets are ſo incapable of that degree of exactneſs, which is here requir'd, that we believe all wiſe Men give up their Hopes from them in this Matter. Clocks, govern'd by long Pendulum's, go much truer: But then the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Gravity in different Latitudes,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0161901100:16"/>
the lengthening of the Pendulum-rod by heat, and ſhortening it by cold; together with the different moiſture of the Air, and the toſſings of the Ship, all put together, are circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſo unpromiſing, that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Wiſe Men are almoſt out of hope of Succeſs from this Method alſo.</p>
            <p>And as for the Log-Line, and Dead-Reckoning, which is the third Terreſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Method, they were the known defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencies of this common way, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd by Storms, and Currents, and the Inaccuracies of the way it ſelf, and of even the Latitude, as commonly taken; together with the too frequent and enduring cloudy Weather, when they can take no Latitude at all; which have occaſion'd the Seamen to deſire ſome other Aſſiſtance for the Diſcovery before us.</p>
            <p>We now come to our laſt Buſineſs, <hi>viz.</hi> to give the World a ſhort Hiſtory of our own Propoſal; from what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0161901100:17"/>
and by what ſteps this our Method was firſt diſcover'd, and has arriv'd at its preſent degree of Matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. As to which matter, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is to know, that ſomewhat above a Year ago, Mr. <hi>Whiſton</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> with ſome other common Friends, ſpent part of an Afternoon and the Evening together. Mr. <hi>Ditton</hi> took an occaſion, among other common diſcourſe, to obſerve to Mr. <hi>Whiſton,</hi> that <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'The nature of Sounds would afford a method, true at leaſt in Theory, for the diſcovery of the Longitude';</q> ſince <hi>The difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the apparent time, where the Sound is made, and where it is heard; abating on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the time for its diffuſion, which was now well known; is the difference of the Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude of thoſe two Places in time.</hi> Mr. <hi>Whiſton</hi> immediately own'd the truth of the Propoſition, and added, <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'That as to the Propagation of Sounds, he remembred to have himſelf plainly
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0161901100:18"/>
heard the Exploſion of great Guns about 90 or 100 Miles, <hi>viz.</hi> when the <hi>French</hi> Fleet was engag'd with Ours, off <hi>Beachy-head</hi> in <hi>Suſſex;</hi> [which was <hi>A.D.</hi> 1690.] and himſelf was at <hi>Cambridge;</hi> and that he had been inform'd, that in one of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Wars, the ſound of the like Exploſions had been heard in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the very middle of <hi>England,</hi> at a much greater diſtance. Upon this, Mr. <hi>Whiſton,</hi> when they part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, told Mr. <hi>Ditton,</hi> that he took the thing to be ſo conſiderable, that tho it had been diſcourſed of in mix'd Company, after an unguard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed manner, yet he look'd on it as fit to be conceal'd; ſince no body could tell, what Improvements might on farther Conſideration be built upon ſuch a Foundation.'</q> Which Advice Mr. <hi>Ditton</hi> follow'd; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly deſir'd and obtain'd the Silence of thoſe, that had then heard,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0161901100:19"/>
what had paſs'd. This Propoſition about Sounds, and their diſtant Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation, with reſpect to the Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, did upon this ſo fix it ſelf in Mr. <hi>Whiſton</hi>'s Mind, and did occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſuch Improvements there, that in leſs than two Days time he brought a ſmall Paper to Mr. <hi>Ditton,</hi> contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Scheme, how that Theory of Mr. <hi>Ditton</hi>'s about Sounds might be reduc'd to Practice, and be actually apply'd to the diſcovery of the Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude at Sea; which was then not much unlike the former branch of the following Eſſay, only more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect: Which Scheme Mr. <hi>Ditton</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd of. Soon after this Mr. <hi>Ditton</hi> imparted this Diſcovery to a very good Friend, belonging to the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty, in order to gain farther light as to its practicableneſs at Sea; and that proper Queſtions might by him be ask'd of Seafaring Men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating thereto, without any Suſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0161901100:20"/>
which could not well be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed if we our ſelves had ask'd them; eſpecially ſince the Notion was then got abroad, that we had a Project about the Longitude to propoſe to the World. The reſult of this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry was, that thoſe Sea-men our Friend enquir'd of, did not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to have heard Sounds at Sea any whit near ſo far as the before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Examples ſhew'd they had been heard at Land; which difficulty put ſome ſtop to our Progreſs for a little while. However, at laſt, after farther enquiry, the final reſult was this, That tho' Sounds were not ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily either at Sea or Land heard very far, yet that was not at Sea, more than at Land, any certain Argument, that they could not ſpread ſo far; becauſe Sounds had been heard a full Degree at leaſt, or 60 Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphical Miles over Sea, even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any extraordinary Contrivance,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0161901100:21"/>
either at the ſounding Body, or the Ear; both which were yet, for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, capable of great improvements, in order to the enlargement of that diſtance. So that the Objection ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the ſpreading of Sounds at Sea ſeem'd to be in a manner over, and we at liberty to proſecute our Deſign, as before, of diſcovering the Longitude by means of it. About this time Mr. <hi>Whiſton</hi> diſcover'd and propos'd a great Improvement of his own to this Method; <hi>viz.</hi> That the Guns, which were to make the Exploſions in the former Caſe, might alſo carry Shells, full of Powder, or ſuch other combuſtible Matter, as would take fire at the utmoſt Alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; and thereby certainly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly exhibit the point of the Azi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muth, and the Diſtance of the ſounding Body; and ſo join the uſe of the Eye and Ear together for the ſame purpoſe. Tho' at the firſt he muſt
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0161901100:22"/>
own he ſuſpected, that the Apparent Diameter of that Light or Fire would in great diſtances be ſo ſmall, as not to be there viſible. In this very junc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a day of extraordinary Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works happen'd [it was the Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving day for the Peace, <hi>July</hi> 7th, 1713.] the Contemplation of which, did much revive and encourage this Notion: and the certain Account he ſoon had, that thoſe Fire-works, nay, the ſmall Stars, into which the Rock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets commonly reſolv'd themſelves, were plainly viſible no leſs than 20 Miles, put an end to his doubts im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately; and made him very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, that ſuch large Shells as might be fir'd at a vaſtly greater height, would for certain be viſible for about 100 Miles; which he look'd on as nearly the limit of Sounds alſo, as to any purpoſes of Longitude. This Improvement of Mr. <hi>Whiſton</hi>'s, which was alſo then for the main the ſame
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0161901100:23"/>
with the ſecond Branch now contain'd in this Paper, was alſo approv'd of by Mr. <hi>Ditton,</hi> and agreed to as fit to be a part of the former Deſign for the Diſcovery of the Longitude at Sea. Mr. <hi>Ditton</hi> did farther add, for Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, a ſure Method of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonometrical Calculation, to aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from the Obſervations the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Difference of Meridians (and by conſequence the Difference of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude in Degrees) between the Ship's Place, and that of Exploſion; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out computing the Time of the Sound's propagation: but ſince this Method is ſomewhat more operoſe than that, which is propos'd hereafter, he chooſes to omit it. He did alſo firſt obſerve that great Uſe of our Method at Land, in the Surveying of Countries, for the Perfection of Geography; which was alſo readily taken notice of by Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton,</hi> and afterward by Dr. <hi>Halley,</hi> and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0161901100:24"/>
that both of their own accord, upon our firſt communication of our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to them. For when Matters were brought to ſo hopeful a Poſture, and neceſſary Tables were preparing for the actual Practice of the whole Method, we began to think of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating to the Publick, that we had a new Diſcovery, as to the Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, to propoſe to the World. Which we ſoon did, by our Letter inſerted in the Paper call'd the <hi>Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi> of <hi>July</hi> 14. and repeated by another in the ſame Author's Paper call'd the <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> of <hi>December</hi> 10. following. Having before commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated the matter to the illuſtrious Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton,</hi> as we did afterward to thoſe great Men, Dr. <hi>Clarke</hi> Rector of St. <hi>James</hi>'s, Dr. <hi>Halley</hi> of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cotes</hi> of <hi>Cambridge.</hi> How far we profited by this Communication, and what their Opinions were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our Method, we need not
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0161901100:25"/>
ſay: becauſe we do not give Account here of every occaſional Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, either of our own or others; and becauſe we now publiſh the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Method, as it ſtands at preſent, to the whole World, for every one's open Judgment, and the farther Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements of the skilful. Only ſo far their Opinions and Declarations appear to have been on our ſide, that upon hearing what they and we had to ſay, the Committee of the Houſe of Commons, which was appointed to inquire into this matter, came unanimouſly to a Reſolution in our Favour; and the Legiſlature have thereupon thought fit to paſs an Act, appointing a noble Reward for ſuch as ſhall diſcover a better Method than has been hitherto us'd for the finding the Longitude. Which Reward, whether we have any juſt Claim to, in whole or in part, we do hereby intirely ſubmit to the Sagacity and

                  <hi>The Solution of the Problem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let a great Gun, with a Shell that will take Fire at its utmoſt Altitude, be diſcharg'd perpendicularly 6440 Feet high above the Surface of the Sea, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Night exactly at 12 a-Clock, at all convenient Diſtances and Situations, and from known Places. This Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge will, by the Diſtance and Point of the Compaſs of its Sound, nearly give the Longitude and Latitude to all Places or Ships within the hearing thereof: And it will, by the ſame Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and Azimuth of its Light or Fire, exactly give the ſame Longitude and Latitude to all Places or Ships within the Sight thereof; according to the foregoing Lemmata. <hi>Q.EI.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For Example: Let us ſuppoſe an Hull fixed in a known place, 30 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees more Weſtward than the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian of <hi>London;</hi> and that every Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night its Great Gun is diſcharged, as before; and that a Ship ſailing by at
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0161901100:60"/>
54′ 40″ after Eleven, ſees the Fire or Light 30′ above the Horizon; <hi>i. e.</hi> by a foregoing Table, at 60 Minutes, or Geographical Miles diſtance. It was therefore 12 a Clock at the Hull, when it was only 11 h. 55′ at the Ship. So that the difference of time is 5′ and the difference of Longitude upon the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator 1° 15′ and the Ships Longitude from the Meridian of <hi>London</hi> is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by known to be 31° 15′ Weſtward.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe alſo that the Weather be ſuch that only the ſound can be heard, and that it proves to be ſo weak as to be juſtly eſteem'd 60 Geographi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Miles, or one Degree of a great Circle, diſtant. This Diſtance an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to 5′ of time, for the interval of the Propagation of the Sound: which therefore, if it be heard juſt at 12 a Clock at the Ship, will imply that when the Exploſion was made it was at the Ship only 55′ paſt eleven, the ſame moment that it was full 12 at the Hull; and that therefore the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0161901100:61"/>
difference of Meridians is the ſame as before, viz. 5′ in time, or 1° 15′ up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Equator, Weſtward.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe farther, that the Light be ſeen at the ſame time that the Sound is heard; with no other than the ſmall difference of the ſlowneſs of the Sound, in compariſon of the inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous motion of the Light; and that the difference of time between the moſt elevated appearance of the Light and the hearing of the Sound; (which may be eaſily and exactly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd by any tolerable movement whatſoever, or by a Pendulum, that vibrates half Seconds:) be found to be 4′ 40″ or, which is all one, that the intire difference of the Exploſion made, and of the Sound heard, be 5′ in time. This difference will imply the diſtance of the Ship from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploſion to be 60 Geographical Miles. And if the ſound is heard at the Ship 54′ 40″<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after Eleven, the difference of Longitude upon the Equator will
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0161901100:62"/>
ſtill be 1° 15′ and the real Longitude from <hi>London</hi> will be 31° 15′ Weſtward, as before.</p>
               <p>If the Azimuth of the Fire or Light be alſo obſerv'd, take with your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes from your Scale the true diſtance, 60 Minutes, or Miles, and ſet it from the place of the Hull, on the true Angle, in any large Map or Sea-Chart. This will determine the very Point where the Ship is, both for Longitude and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. The ſame thing may be done for the Sound, in caſe the Point of the Compaſs be obſerv'd alſo.</p>
               <p>If the Latitude of the Ship be known, take the known diſtance, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the means of the Light or Fire ſeen, or, if the Weather be too Fog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy for that, of the Sound heard; and let it croſs the known parallel of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude in the Chart; and this will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the Longitude. The like is to be done for the Latitude, were the Longitude firſt known. But that not being the uſual caſe, it needs not be
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0161901100:63"/>
farther inſiſted on. Nor need we ſhew how all this may be done by Calculation alſo: ſince thoſe that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand any thing of Navigation can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be to ſeek therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>N.B.</hi> In caſe ſome parts of the Ocean prove ſo very deep and rough that no Hulls can be fixed in them, the way to recover the Longitude, which may be by this means interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is rightly propoſed by Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> himſelf, in his Paper delivered in to the Committee of the Houſe of Commons, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſail obliquely from the laſt Hull into the Parallel of the next, and ſo along the ſame; till up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on approaching to that next Hull the Longitude be anew recover'd, and the Voyage be continued as before. Nor is this Interruption of any conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; becauſe it cannot happen but in places where there is no Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and where Seamen are under no concern for the knowledge of the Longitude.</p>

            <p n="1">(1.) IF in all proper Roads of Ships ſuch a great Gun be plac'd and diſcharg'd, exactly every Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, whether on Shoars, or Iſlands, or in Hulls, at the Diſtances of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 600 Geographical Miles or 10 Degrees, All Ships that ſail with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in any tolerable Diſtance may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly every Week or Ten Days thereby correct their Reckoning, and know their Longitude, as well as Latitude, even when the Heavens are not clear enough to make Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Obſervations for either.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) The Ordinary Watches, Movements, or Log-Lines in Ships, when thus Corrected and Adjuſted, once in a Week or Ten Days, will

well enough ſhew the Longitude du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring every one of thoſe ſhort Diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces between the Hulls; and ſo will render the knowledge thereof ſtill more univerſal.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) If one ſuch Row of Hulls be any where found too defective, a double Row may there be laid, Pair by Pair, in the ſame [or equidiſtant] Meridians; with proper Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Sounds, or the Light, to prevent miſtaking one Row for the other. Nor will there, in this Caſe, be room for almoſt any Uncertainty, ſince even in Cloudy Weather, as much as the Wind carries away the Sound of any one, ſo much will it uſually bring the Sound of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) If it be any where neceſſary, Maſts may be Erected upon Hollow Empty Veſſels, with White Spheres at their Tops; and theſe Veſſels may be fix'd in proper Places, at
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0161901100:66"/>
equal Diſtances between the Hulls, for the more ſure guiding the Ships in Places of Danger. And ſince from the Top of any Maſt that is 88 Feet High, the Top of another as high may be diſcovered at the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of 20 Miles, there will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be occaſion for more of theſe Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels any where than one every 120 Miles: Nor will theſe Maſts and Veſſels be any Annual Charges at all.</p>

(7.) If in any clear Night a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Number of ſuch Exploſions were made at proper Diſtances in any Country, and convey'd in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from one to another; ſo that the Second Gun were fired when the Light of the Firſt was ſeen, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; with the Obſervation of the exact apparent Times when they were made, when the Light was ſeen, what Angle, or how long that Light was above the Horizon, and what Azimuth it had; both the Longitude and Latitude, as well as the Diſtance and Poſition of all theſe Places, might by this means be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily determin'd at Land; eſpecially if the Experiments were repeated ſeveral times, and were compar'd one with another.

            <p>
               <hi>N.B.</hi> This Method of Survey is no hard Thing in Practice, even to thoſe that know little of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks: For any Right Angle, ſet by a Plummet or Level, with Two Pins or Points, for the Eye and for the Object, does by the Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its Sides give the Angle above the Horizon; by the Angle its Horizontal Side makes with the Meridian, it gives the Azimuth; and by the Interval of Time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Light and Sound, it gives the Diſtance of every Place from that of Exploſion, according to the Figure following. <pb n="71" facs="tcp:0161901100:70"/>

Nor is there, we think, any way yet diſcover'd of ſurveying Countries and Kingdoms that can compare with this, either for Expedition, Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty or Cheapneſs. A Specimen of which we hope ſoon to give the World in an Actual Survey of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and their Coaſts hereby; if the Publick pleaſe to give us Encouragement and Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance therein.</p>
            <p n="8">(8.) The way of caſting a Shell 6440 Feet high is very eaſy: for the ſame Force or Charge of Gun-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that will caſt any Shell 12880 Feet for its utmoſt Random, at the Elevation of 45 Degrees, will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly caſt the ſame Shell perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly upward 6440 Feet, as we have already obſerv'd. And ſince the time of this entire perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Projection, or Aſcent and Deſcent
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0161901100:72"/>
together, is 40″, or ſome very ſmall Matter more; on Account of the Reſiſtance of the Air; We have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſure Way of Adjuſting the ſame Projection to that Height; <hi>viz.</hi> by obſerving what Quantity of Powder will caſt the Shell high enough to ſtay very little above 40″ in the Air, before it falls to the Ground.</p>
            <p n="9">(9.) This Method of firing Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or other combuſtible Matter, at, or very near the utmoſt Height of 6440 Feet, may be well enough put in practice, even tho' ſome conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Error ſhould be committed in the adjuſting the Fuſee to give Fire in 20″. Since the Miſtake of even a Fifth Part, or Four entire Seconds, in that Caſe, would produce but an Error of the 25th Part of the whole Altitude: and the Miſtake of a Tenth Part, or Two Seconds, would occaſion an Alteration of no more than the Hundredth Part thereof.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0161901100:73"/>
This is evident, becauſe this Time belongs to the higheſt Part of the Projectils Motion, which is the ſloweſt: And becauſe the Lines deſcrib'd by all Aſcending and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending Bodies are ſtill in a Dupli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Proportion of the Times of ſuch their Aſcent and Deſcent.</p>
            <p n="10">(10.) If one or more Rows of ſuch Hulls were laid in the ſame or Equidiſtant Meridians, Southward or otherways, Ships might with greater Safety than formerly go to diſcover thoſe Parts of the Globe which are hitherto undiſcover'd. Nor can we at preſent gueſs what Advantages may thereby accrue to the Parts of the World already diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>
            <p n="11">(11.) Every one of theſe Hulls may be Places of Obſervation as to the Variation of the Needle, to the Currents, to the Soil, the Fowls, the Fiſhes, and other <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the

            <p n="12">(12.) As this Method ought to be put in Practice by the Conſent of all Trading Nations; ſo ought every one of the Hulls employ'd therein to have a legal Protection from them all; And it ought to be a great Crime with every one of them, if any other Ships either injure them, or endeavour to imitate their Explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, for the Amuſement and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of any.</p>
            <p n="13">(13.) Since the Charges of the Powder for each Gun will be very ſmall; ſince the Shells and their Contents come to no great Price neither; ſince the Perſons employ'd in the Hulls may be in part taken out of ſuch Places where they are

maintain'd at the Publick Charge already; and ſo will require only ſome Additional Rewards, or Future Privileges for ſuch their Service; And ſince the Land-Exploſions, which will be much the moſt nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, will be withal much the cheapeſt; It will appear, upon the Whole, that the Annual or Conſtant Expences of this Method will be comparatively very ſmall and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable: eſpecially if they are, as they ought to be, equally diſtributed among the ſeveral Trading Nations of the World.</p>

               <head>The Advantages of this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod.</head>
               <item>(1.) THIS Method requires no Depth of Aſtronomy, no Nicety in Inſtruments, and but ſeldom any Celeſtial Obſervations at all, either as to the Latitude, or the Hour at the Ship; and ſo is to even the common Sailors the <hi>moſt Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>(2.) It does generally determine the very Place of the Ship, both as to <hi>Longitude</hi> and <hi>Latitude</hi> at once, and ſo is the <hi>moſt Compendious.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>(3.) It does generally determine the very Place to a few Miles, at the fartheſt; and ſo is the <hi>moſt Accurate.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>(4.) It affords Help even in Clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Foggy Weather, when no Celeſtial Obſervations can be made, and the <hi>Latitude</hi> it ſelf cannot be otherwiſe found, and ſo is the <hi>moſt General.</hi>
               </item>

                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:0161901100:77"/>
(5.) It will frequently afford a double Obſervation Two ſucceſſive Nights, from the ſame Hull to the ſame Ship, and ſo is the <hi>moſt ſecure.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>(6.) It will commonly afford a double way of Obſervation at the ſame time, by the Eye and by the Ear, which will confirm or correct one another; and ſo is the <hi>moſt certain.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>(7.) The more inaccurate Branch, by the Sound, is not only more uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal than the other; but is alſo much more exact than any Method formerly diſcover'd: So that in the very worſt Circumſtances this way is certainly the <hi>very beſt.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>(8.) It is the moſt undoubted and exact where there is the greateſt Want and Danger: And if it ſhould at all be deficient, it is there only where there is no Danger, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any occaſion for knowing the Longitude, as has been ſhew'd alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. So that on all Accounts it is plainly the <hi>moſt Uſeful</hi> and <hi>Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous.</hi>

            <p>IT is farther humbly propos'd to the Learned, Whether it may not be proper for all Nations, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Occaſion, to agree upon one <hi>firſt Meridian,</hi> or beginning of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude,</hi> for the common Benefit of <hi>Geography?</hi> And whether it may not be proper, in that Caſe, to fix it to the <hi>Pike of Tenariff,</hi> as the moſt noted Place already; and as the Place whence the Higheſt and moſt generally uſeful Exploſion muſt in this Method be made every Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night continually for the Diſcovery of the <hi>Longitude</hi> it ſelf?</p>
