            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>'TIS now almoſt ſeven Years, ſince I happen'd to ſay one Morning to a certain Perſon diſtinguiſh'd by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Quality, that wherever the <hi>Italian Opera</hi> had come, it had driven out Poetry from that Nation, and not only Poetry, but the very Taſt of Poetry, and of all the politer Arts; and that if the ſame Protection and Encouragement were continued to the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pera,</hi> by which it was then ſupported, the ſame
<pb facs="tcp:0143100400:3"/>
Calamity would befal <hi>Great Britain</hi> which had happen'd to the Neighbouring Nations. As 'tis hard to find a Man more quick or more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating, than the Perſon to whom I ſpoke this; he immediately enter'd into that Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſoon after withdrew that Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement which he had given to the <hi>Italians.</hi> All that I foretold, and more than all hath happen'd. For ſuch Things, ſuch monſtrous Things have been lately writ, and ſuch mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Judgments paſs'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that what has been formerly ſaid has been ſufficiently confirm'd, that 'tis impoſſible an Author can be ſo very fooliſh, but he will find more ſtupid Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.</p>
            <p>A moſt notorious Inſtance of this Depravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Genius and Taſt, is the Eſſay upon which the following Reflections are writ, and the Approbation which it has met with. I will not deny but that there are two or three Paſſages in it with which I am not diſpleas'd; but what are two or three Paſſages as to the whole?</p>
            <q>
               <l>Fit Chaerilus ille</l>
               <l>Quem bis ter<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> bonum cum riſu miror.</l>
            </q>
            <p>The approving two or Three Paſſages amongſt a multitude of bad ones, is by no means ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to an Author. That little that is
<pb facs="tcp:0143100400:4"/>
good in him does but ſet off its contrary, and make it appear more extravagant. The Thoughts, Expreſſions, and Numbers of this Eſſay are for the moſt part but very indifferent, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different and execrable in Poetry are all one. But what is worſe than all the rest, we find throughout the whole a deplorable want of that very Quality, which ought principally to appear in it, which is Judgment; and I have no Notion that where there is ſo great a want of Judgment, there can be any Genius.</p>
            <p>However, I had not publiſh'd the following Letter, but had ſuffer'd his Readers to have bugg'd themſelves in the Approbation of a Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet ſo very undeſerving, if I had not found things in it that have provok'd my Scorn, tho' not my Indignation. For I not only found my ſelf attack'd without any manner of Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on my ſide, and attack'd in my Perſon, inſtead of my Writings, by one who is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Stranger to me, and at a time when all the World knew that I was perſecuted by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, I not only ſaw that this was attempted in a clandeſtine manner with the utmoſt Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood and Calumny, but found that all this was done by a little affected Hypocrite, who had nothing in his mouth at the ſame time but <hi>Truth, Candor, Friendſhip, good Nature, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,</hi> and <hi>Magnanimity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0143100400:5"/>
'Tis for this Reaſon that I have publiſh'd the following Letter, in which if I have not treated the Author of the Eſſay with my uſual Candor, he may thank himſelf and this good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur'd Town. For having obſerv'd with no little Aſtoniſhment, that Perſons have been cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd for ill Nature, who have attempted to diſplay the Errors of Authors undeſervedly ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful; tho' they have done this with all i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginable Candor, and with the best and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt Deſigns, which are the doing Juſtice, the Diſcovery of Truth, and the Improvement of Arts; while Writers of Lampoons and infamous Libels, whoſe Anonymous Authors have lain lurking in the dark, ſometimes in Clubs, and ſometimes ſolitary, like ſo many common Rogues and Footpads, to ruin the Fortunes, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Reputations of others; have been ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs'd and bugg'd by their thoughtleſs Applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and treated as if they had been the moſt vertuous and the beſt natur'd Men in the World; having obſerv'd all this with no little aſtoniſhment, I at laſt found out the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it, which is, becauſe the Attempts of Libellers and Lampooners hurt only thoſe whom they attack, and delight the reſt of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; whereas they who expoſe by a juſt Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm the Abſurdities of fooliſh fortunate Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, attack all thoſe who commend and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire thoſe Authors, and diſturb perhaps by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening their Eyes, no fewer than a thouſand
<pb facs="tcp:0143100400:6"/>
Fops in the good Opinion which they have conceiv'd of themſelves. 'Tis for this Reaſon that I have endeavour'd to comply with this wiſe and good natur'd general Diſpoſition of Minds, and to make amends for the Ill-nature of my Criticiſm, by the Allurements of my <hi>Satyr.</hi>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Here ſend you my Anſwer to the two Queſtions which I lately received from you, which are whether the Eſſay upon Criticiſm, which I lately ſent you is like to take in Town, and who is the Author of that anonymous Rhapſody.</p>
            <p>In anſwer to the firſt Queſtion, my Opinion is that it will take very well. For the ſame thing is true of great Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Men, which has been obſerv'd of particular Perſons; and that is, that when Genius thinks fit to depart from among them, good Taſte never cares to be very long after it. When the <hi>Italian</hi> Opera drove Poetry from out this Iſland, Criticiſm thought it a very great Impertinence for her to ſtay long behind. Beſides that the elegant Tranſlations of the <hi>Italian</hi> Opera's, which Mr. <hi>Tonſon</hi> has publiſhed by the moſt eminent Hands, have prepared People to like any thing that is of an equal Merit with thoſe Tranſlations, and with <hi>Tom Sternhold</hi>'s Verſion.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond <hi>Quaere,</hi> Mr.<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc> _____ </desc>
               </gap>  is of Opinion that this Eſſay was writ by ſome experienced judicious Perſon, who knows what Quantity of baſe Alloy is at this Juncture requiſite to debaſe the Coin of <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> and reduce it to the current Standard. But I am inclin'd to believe that it was writ by ſome young, or ſome raw Author, for the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Reaſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, He diſcovers in every Page a Sufficiency that is far beyond his little Ability; and hath raſhly undertaken a Task which is infinitely above his Force; a Task that is only fit for the Author, with the juſt Encomium of whoſe Eſſay my Lord <hi>Roſcommon</hi> begins his own.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0143100400:9"/>
               <l>Happy that Author whoſe correct Eſſay</l>
               <l>Repairs ſo well our old <hi>Horatian</hi> way.</l>
            </q>
            <p>There is nothing more wrong, more low, or more incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect than this Rhapſody upon Criticiſm. The Author all along taxes others with Faults of which he is more guilty himſelf. He tells us in the very two firſt Lines, that</p>
            <q>
               <l>'Tis hard to ſay if greater want of Skill</l>
               <l>Appear in writing, or in judging ill.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Now whereas others have been at ſome Pains and Thought to ſhew each of theſe wants of Skill ſeparately and diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, his comprehenſive Soul hath moſt ingeniouſly contriv'd to ſhew them both in a ſupreme Degree together.</p>
            <p>Secondly, While this little Author ſtruts and affects the Dictatorian Air, he plainly ſhews that at the ſame time he is under the Rod; and that while he pretends to give Laws to others, he is himſelf a pedantick Slave to Authority and Opinion, of which I ſhall give ſome Inſtances.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of his Eſſay he lays down this Maxim:</p>
            <q>
               <l>Let ſuch teach others who themſelves excel;</l>
               <l>And cenſure others who have written well.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Where he would inſinuate, that they alone are fit to be Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks who have ſhewn themſelves great Poets. And he brings in <hi>Pliny</hi> to confirm by his Authority the Truth of a Precept, which is denied by matter of Fact, and by the Experience of above Two thouſand Years.</p>
            <q>
               <l>De Pictore, Sculptore, Fictore niſi Artifex judicare non poteſt.</l>
            </q>
            <p>It has been obſerved by Writers of Politicks, That they who have ſucceeded beſt in theſe kind of Writings, have never been either Governours of Provinces, or Miniſters of State, as <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in <hi>Greece, Machiavel</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and in this Iſland <hi>Harrington.</hi> I will not ſay that this may be applied to Criticks. There are and have been very good ones who have been great Poets, as <hi>Horace</hi> in <hi>Italy, Boileau</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and in <hi>Great Britain</hi> my Lord <hi>Roſcommon,</hi> and a living noble Author. Nay I am fully convinc'd, that there never was an admirable Poet, but he was a great Critick. For what can be more abſurd than to imagine, that any Man can excel in any Art, or Buſineſs, or Profeſſion, who
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0143100400:10"/>
does not underſtand that Profeſſion, Art, or Buſineſs. Now he who underſtands the Art of Poetry is a Critick in Poetry. But this is undeniable at the ſame time, that there have been Criticks, who have been approv'd of by all the World, who never meddled with Poetry. Was <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf, the very Father of <hi>Criticks,</hi> a Poet? Why yes, 'tis pretended that there is a Fragment of an Ode, which was writ by him, remaining in <hi>Athenaeus.</hi> But is that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to denominate him a Poet? Did he ever write either Tragedy or Epick Poem? And yet how freely did he cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure both Tragick and Epick Poets? <hi>Dionyſius Halicarnaſſaeus,</hi> and <hi>Dionyſius Longinus</hi> among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Quintilian</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Romans</hi> were free Cenſurers, yet no Poets. And ſo are <hi>Boſſu</hi> and <hi>Dacier</hi> at preſent among the <hi>French.</hi> And what is ſtill more remarkable, is, that this young Author forgets himſelf to that degree, as to commend <hi>Longinus</hi> and <hi>Quintilian</hi> for accompliſh'd Criticks contrary to his own Precept.</p>
            <p>Another Inſtance which I ſhall give of his being a Slave to Authority and Opinion, is the ſervile Deference which he pays to the Ancients.</p>

            <p>For the <hi>French</hi>-man with an inſolent Stupidity contemn'd and blaſphem'd, even thoſe Hero's of Antiquity, whoſe Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings are admirable and Divine: This Eſſayer deifies Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, whoſe Writings are but tolerable and indifferent. <hi>Boileau,</hi> as a reaſonable Man, took the Path that lay in the middle of the two Extremes, as we ſhall ſee by what follows.</p>
            <q>For what remains, ſays he, I would not have any one think, that in this number of ancient Writers approv'd of by all Ages, 'tis my Intention to comprehend ſome Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0143100400:11"/>
who indeed are ancient, but who have only acquir'd a moderate Eſteem, as <hi>Lycophron, Nonnus, Silius Italicus,</hi> and the Author of the Tragedies which are attributed to <hi>Seneca,</hi> to whom in my mind we may not only boldly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare, but juſtly prefer ſeveral of the modern Writers. I only admit into that exalted Rank that ſmall number of admirable Writers, whoſe Name alone is their Panegyrick, as <hi>Homer, Plato, Cicero, Virgil, &amp;c.</hi> And I do not regulate the Eſteem which I have for them, by that length of Time which their Works have laſted, but by the number of Years which they have been admir'd; of which 'tis convenient to advertiſe a great many People, who otherwiſe perhaps might indiſcreetly believe, what Monſieur <hi>Perrault</hi> has a mind to inſinuate, that we commend the Ancients for no other Reaſon, but becauſe they are Ancients; and blame the Moderns for no other Reaſon, but becauſe they are Moderns; which is utterly falſe; ſince there are ſeveral among the Ancients whom we do not admire, and ſeveral among the Moderns whom all the World extols. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity of a Writer is no certain proof of his Merit; but the ancient and conſtant Admiration which all the World has had for his Writings, is a certain and infallible proof that we ought to admire them. <hi>Boileau</hi> Reflect. the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> on <hi>Longinus.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>Thus hath <hi>Boileau</hi> determin'd this matter like a dextrous Diſtinguiſher, and a moſt rightful Judge. If I may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to ſpeak my Sentiments after ſo great a Maſter, I muſt freely declare my Opinion, that of all the Poets a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Graecians,</hi> I only admire <hi>Homer, Sophocles, Pindar,</hi> and <hi>Euripides,</hi> tho' I am very much pleas'd with ſome of the reſt; and of all the Poets among the <hi>Romans,</hi> I admire on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Horace,</hi> and ſome parts of <hi>Lucretius</hi>; tho' I am very much pleas'd with <hi>Catullus, Tibullus, Terence,</hi> and others. For as for <hi>Lycophron, Nonnus, Apollonius Rhodius, Valerius Flaccus, Silius Italicus, Statius,</hi> I prefer the <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe lost</hi> of <hi>Milton</hi> before them all together: Nay I will go yet farther, and declare, that tho' I muſt freely own, that <hi>Virgil</hi> has infinitely the Advantage of <hi>Milton,</hi> in the wonderful Contrivance of his Poem, in the Harmony of his Verſification, and in the conſtant Tenor of his Majeſty, and his Elevation; yet that <hi>Milton</hi> in ſome particular parts of his Poem has the Advantage of <hi>Virgil,</hi> and of Mankind.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0143100400:12"/>
And tho' I can by no means believe <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> to be of equal Merit with <hi>Sophocles</hi> or <hi>Euripides,</hi> for which I ſhall give my Reaſons in another place; yet this I can ſay for the Honour of my Countryman, and of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> that there are ſeveral ſingle Scenes in <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> which I prefer to all the Tragedies put together of which <hi>Seneca</hi> is accounted the Author.</p>
            <p>I ſhall give one more Inſtance, by which it will appear that while this Youngſter is pretending to give Laws, he behaves himſelf like one who is ſtill in awe of the Rod; that he admires the Ancients, becauſe his Maſter tells him that they muſt be admir'd; and that if the Ancients were his Contemporaries, and produc'd the ſame Writings now which they did formerly, he would uſe them with the ſame Inſolence with which he treats his Contemporaries. In the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Page of this Eſſay, he gives a verboſe and indigeſted Encomium of the firſt <hi>Graecian</hi> Criticks, but forgets and contradicts himſelf before he comes to the bottom of that very Page. For, ſays he,</p>
            <q>
               <l>The gen'rous Critick fann'd the Poet's Fire,</l>
               <l>And taught the World with Reaſon to admire;</l>
               <l>Then Criticiſm, the Muſes Handmaid, proud</l>
               <l>To dreſs her Charms, and make her more belov'd:</l>
               <l>But following Wits from that Intention ſtray'd,</l>
               <l>Who could not win the Miſtreſs, woo'd the Maid,</l>
               <l>Set up themſelves, and drove a ſep'rate Trade.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Never was any thing more obſcure and confus'd than the foregoing Rhimes; but if there is any meaning in them, it muſt be that which follows.</p>
            <p>At firſt Poets and Criticks were all one; and theſe Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets made uſe of their Criticiſm only to make their Poetry more charming, and more accompliſh'd. But the Wits who immediately follow'd after them, deviated from the Deſign of their Predeceſſors; and not being able to attain to Poetry, took up a Reſolution to drive a ſeparate Trade, and to ſet up only for Criticks. If this is not his meaning, I ſhould be glad to hear in Proſe, and in plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> what his meaning is; for Rhime has been always a wicked Abettor and Concealer of Nonſenſe. But if this is his meaning, then I deſire to make theſe two Remarks, Firſt, that the ancienteſt Criticks among the <hi>Graecians</hi> were not
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0143100400:13"/>
Poets, as we obſerv'd before; and Secondly, that if <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> and <hi>Dionyſius Halicarnaſſaeus,</hi> and others were now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, and their excellent Criticiſms were now firſt to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, it would be objected to thoſe great Men, in order to diſqualify them for Criticks, that they were no Verſifyers. And it is plain from the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Page that another Objection would be made to them: For when he comes there to ſpeak of the Moderns, he tells us,</p>
            <q>
               <l>Some dryly plain, without Invention's Aid,</l>
               <l>Write dull Receipts how Poems may be made.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Now it being evident, that the Criticiſms of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and of <hi>Dionyſius Halicarnaſſaeus</hi> are writ with a great deal of Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, 'tis manifeſt that if thoſe two Criticks had writ but yeſterday, they would be accus'd to day of being drily plain, and of writing dull Receipts.</p>
            <p>But a third infallible mark of a young Author, is, that he hath done in this Eſſay what School-boys do by their Exerciſes, he hath borrow'd both from Living and Dead, and particularly from the Authors of the two famous Eſſays upon Poetry and Tranſlated Verſe; but ſo borrow'd, that he ſeems to have the very Reverſe of <hi>Midas</hi>'s noble Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For as the courſeſt and the dulleſt Metals, were upon the touch of that <hi>Lydian</hi> Monarch immediately chang'd into fine Gold; ſo the fineſt Gold upon this Author's handling it, in a moment loſes both its luſtre and its weight, and is immediately turn'd to Lead.</p>
            <p>A fourth thing that ſhews him a young man, is the not knowing his own mind, and his frequent Contradictions of himſelf. His Title ſeems to promiſe an Eſſay upon Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm in general, which afterwards dwindles to an Eſſay upon Criticiſm in Poetry. And after all, he is all along giving Rules, ſuch as they are, for Writing rather than Judging. In the beginning of the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Page the Rules are nothing but Nature.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Theſe Rules of old diſcover'd, not devis'd,</l>
               <l>Are Nature ſtill, but Nature methodiz'd.</l>
            </q>
            <p>But no ſooner is he come to the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Page, but the Rules and Nature are two different things.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0143100400:14"/>
               <l>When firſt great <hi>Maro,</hi> in his boundleſs mind.</l>
               <l>A Work t'outlaſt immortal <hi>Rome</hi> deſign'd,</l>
               <l>Perhaps he ſeem'd above the Critick's Law,</l>
               <l>And but from Nature's Fountains ſcorn'd to draw.</l>
            </q>
            <p>But in the laſt Line of this very Paragraph they are the ſame things again.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Learn hence for ancient Rules and just Eſteem,</l>
               <l>To copy Nature is to copy them.</l>
            </q>
            <p>But to this he will anſwer, That he is guilty of no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, that he is only ſhewing that <hi>Virgil</hi> was guilty of Error and Ignorance; who firſt abſurdly began to write his <hi>Aeneis,</hi> and afterwards ſate down to learn the Rules of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; which when he began to write that Poem, he took to be things diſtinct from Nature; but that after he had wrote part of it, he fell to the reading of <hi>Homer,</hi> and that undeceiv'd him. That while he is talking of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and Ignorance, he is making a Parade of his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Wiſdom and Knowledge; and not contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf, but <hi>Virgil,</hi> or rather making him appear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with and contradicting himſelf: for that tho' <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi> took the Rules and Nature to be diſtinct from each other, for his own part he is wiſer, and knows better things. Now is not this a very modeſt and a very judicious Gentleman?</p>
            <p>A fifth Sign of his being a young Author is his being almoſt perpetually in the wrong. And here in relation to the foregoing paſſage, I might deſire to ask him one or two civil Queſtions. Firſt, who acquainted him with that noble Particularity of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Life, that he deſigned to write his <hi>Aeneis</hi> without Art? Had he it from ancient or modern Authors, or does he owe it to a noble Effort of his own ſagacious Soul? If <hi>Virgil</hi> had ſo little Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Rules of his own Art, and ſo very little true Judgment within him, as to be capable of ſuch an Extravagance, an Extravagance which, ſays this Eſſayer, nothing but the reading of <hi>Homer</hi> was able to correct, how comes he ſo far to have ſurpaſs'd his Maſter in the admirable Contrivance of his Poem. But ſecondly, what
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0143100400:15"/>
does he mean by <hi>Maro</hi>'s deſigning a Work to outlaſt immortal <hi>Rome?</hi> Does he pretend to put that Figure, call'd a Bull upon <hi>Virgil?</hi> Or would he ambitiouſly have it paſs for his own? 'Tis no wonder that one who is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of imputing ſo great an Extravagance to <hi>Virgil,</hi> ſhould be capable of writing himſelf without any manner of meaning.</p>
            <p>Whenever we find a Simile, the firſt Line of it is like a Warning-piece, to give us notice that ſomething ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary falſe or fooliſh is to follow. We have one in the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Page, where the former and the latter part have not the leaſt relation, and bear not the leaſt proportion to one another.</p>
            <q>
               <l>As on the Land while here the Ocean gains,</l>
               <l>In other Parts it leaves wide ſandy Plains:</l>
               <l>Thus in the Soul while Memory prevails,</l>
               <l>The ſolid Power of Underſtanding fails;</l>
               <l>Where Beams of warm Imagination play,</l>
               <l>The Memory's ſoft Figures melt away.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Here the Soul in the third Verſe is made to anſwer to Land in the firſt, and Memory to Ocean, which in the fourth Verſe is chang'd for Underſtanding; tho' in this Simile the Author ſhews neither Memory nor Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; for there are as many Abſurdities in it as there are Lines. At this rate a man may make a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Similes in an hour! Any thing may become like to any thing. <hi>Jungentur jam Gryphes Equis.</hi> But what a thoughtleſs Creature is this Eſſayer, to deny in theſe very Rhimes, by which he pretends to ſhew both Poetry and Criticiſm, the co-exiſtence of thoſe Qualities, without which 'tis impoſſible to be both Poet and Critick? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, how wrong is this; and how many Perſons have I known who have had all theſe Qualities at the ſame time in a very great degree? What follows is more wrong and more abſurd:</p>
            <q>
               <l>One Science only will one Genius fit,</l>
               <l>So vast is Art, ſo narrow Human Wit.</l>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0143100400:16"/>
Is not this a rare Pretender to Poetry and Criticiſm, who talks at this rate, when all the World knows that 'tis impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for a Man with only one Science to be either Poet or Critick? Which is ſo much the more unlucky, becauſe the very Fathers of Poetry and Criticiſm <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> whom he mentions ſo often in this Eſſay, are believed to have had all the Sciences. 'Tis now between Two and three thouſand Years ſince <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> wrote his Morals, his Politicks, his Rhetorick, and his Poetick; and three of theſe are the very beſt in their kinds to this very day, and have infinitely the Advantage of all thoſe ſeveral thouſand Treatiſes that have been writ ſince. What fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows is ſtill more falſe and more abominable.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Not only bounded to peculiar Arts,</l>
               <l>But ev'n in thoſe confin'd to ſingle Parts.</l>
            </q>
            <p>What a wretched narrow Soul hath this Eſſayer? And what a thoughtleſs one—when <hi>Homer,</hi> whom he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſo often in this Eſſay, had as admirable a Talent for Pleaſantry, as he had a Genius equal to the moſt exalted Poetry? To come to the <hi>Romans, Horace</hi> is famous both for Elevation and Pleaſantry. <hi>Virgil</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in his <hi>Bucolicks</hi> and <hi>Georgicks,</hi> as well as he did in his <hi>Aeneis.</hi> To deſcend to the Moderns, <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> had a very good Genius for Tragedy, and a very good Talent for Comedy. And ſince him <hi>Otway</hi> had likewiſe a Talent for both.</p>
            <p>But in the next Page there is likewiſe a Simile; and therefore we may be ſure, as we obſerv'd above, that moſt of that Page is one continued Abſurdity. P. 7.</p>
            <q>

               <l>By her just Standard, which is ſtill the ſame;</l>
               <l>Unerring Nature ſtill divinely bright,</l>
               <l>One clear, unchang'd, and univerſal Light,</l>

               </l>
            </q>
            <p>Now here would I fain ask one or two Queſtions? Is he giving Rules here for Judging or for Writing? And is he preſcribing thoſe Rules to the Knowing or the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant?
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0143100400:17"/>
If he ſays to the Knowing, what is it that he tells them here? That they muſt judge according to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or write according to Nature. Now does he tell them any thing in this that they did not know before? Well, but he ſays, he is laying down theſe Rules for the Ignorant; why then I humbly conceive that he ought to have told them what he means by Nature, and what it is to write or to judge according to Nature. For by expreſſing himſelf at the rate that he does, he neither ſays any thing to the Learned which they did not know before, nor any thing to the Ignorant which they can poſſibly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand. <hi>Horace</hi> proceeded in a very different Method from this, when he was to acquaint the <hi>Piſo</hi>'s what was the principal Source of good Writing, he not only told them that it was moral Philoſophy,</p>
            <q>
               <l>Scribendi recte, ſapere est &amp; principium &amp; Fons,</l>
            </q>
            <p>But pointed to the very Books where they might find that moral Philoſophy,</p>
            <q>
               <l>Rem tibi Socraticae poterant oſtendere Chartae.</l>
            </q>
            <p>So that in one we have a clear and perſpicuous Precept, and in the other an obſcure and unintelligible Jargon. But let us go on.</p>
            <q>
               <l>That Art is best which moſt reſembles her,</l>
               <l>Which ſtill preſides, yet never does appear.</l>
            </q>
            <p>That is, as much as to ſay, <hi>Artis est celare artem,</hi> the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Subject that Pedants give their Boys to make Themes and Declamations upon. Is not this a noble Diſcovery? Well but now for the Simile;</p>
            <q>
               <l>In ſome fair Body thus the ſprightly Soul</l>

            <p>Now cannot I for my Soul conceive the reciprocal <hi>Aid</hi> that there is between Wit and Judgment. For tho' I can eaſily conceive how Judgment may keep Wit in her.

            <q>Poets like Painters not having the Skill to draw Nature without Art, hide their want of Art with a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abundance of Art.</q>
            <p>In the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Page we have another Simile, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly another Abſurdity.</p>
            <q>

            </q>
            <p>Which is borrow'd from the Eſſay on Poetry.</p>
            <q>
               <l>True Wit is everlaſting like the Sun,</l>
            </q>
            <p>But awkardly borrow'd, and utterly ſpoil'd in the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val. For what can Expreſſion be properly ſaid to ſhine upon? True Wit, or Genius; for that the noble Author means, as is plain from ſeveral parts of his Poem, ſhines thro' and diſcovers it ſelf by the Expreſſion; but Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, at the very beſt, can but ſhine with a borrow'd Light, like the Moon and the reſt of the Planets, whereas Genius ſhines and flames with its own Celeſtial Fire.</p>
            <p>His Inſtructions, his Aſſertions, his Commendations, his Cenſures, his Advice, wherever they are his own, are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther falſe or trivial, or both. Such is that in the beginning of the twelfth Page.</p>
            <q>
               <l>And tho' the Ancients thus their Rules invade,</l>
               <l>As Kings diſpenſe with Laws themſelves have made.</l>
               <l>Moderns beware.</l>

               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0143100400:21"/>
Thus is this Eſſayer for a double Diſpenſing Power in Kings and ancient Authors, and is for making the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns doubly Slaves, Slaves in their Actions, and Slaves in their Writings. But as we boldly deny that Kings have either Power to make Laws, or to diſpenſe with them after they are made; ſo thoſe Laws of Writing were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made by the Ancients, nor can thoſe Ancients diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with them. As they are the Laws of Nature, and not of Men, as he has himſelf hinted in the beginning of the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Page.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Thoſe Rules of old diſcover'd, not devis'd,</l>
               <l>Are Nature ſtill, but Nature methodiz'd.</l>
            </q>
            <p>They are eternal and irrevocable, and never to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens'd with but by Nature that made them; and the only Rule for that Diſpenſation is this, that a leſs Law may be violated to avoid the infringing of a greater; and 'tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually the Duty both of Ancients and Moderns, to break thro' a leſs important Rule, when without that Infringe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a greater muſt be violated, or the great End of all the Rules neglected. The great End of all the Rules is to inſtruct, and the ſubordinate End is to pleaſe, by moving of Paſſion, and particularly that kind of Paſſion which ought chiefly to reign in that ſort of Poetry in which the Poet writes. Now 'tis a Rule in Poetry, that the notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Events of Hiſtory are not to be falſifyed, nor the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods of Time tranſpos'd or confounded. And yet <hi>Virgil</hi> in the fourth of his <hi>Aeneis,</hi> broke thro' this Rule at once by a bold and a judicious Anachroniſm, in order to make his Poem more admirable, and the more to exalt the Glory of the <hi>Roman</hi> Name. Whatever the Ancients juſtly did, the Moderns may juſtly do. 'Tis ridiculous and pedan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick to imagine, that the natural Powers of the Soul were ſtronger or more excellent in the Ancients than they are in the Moderns. And as to Experience we have vaſtly the Advantage of them. When we conſider Experience, as my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> obſerves, we are properly the Ancients, who live in the elder Ages of the World, and have the Advantage of the Knowledge of Three thouſand Years over the firſt Writers. Not but that at the ſame time that I aſſert the Equality of Faculties in the Moderns,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0143100400:22"/>
and the Advantage of their Experience, I freely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the actual Preheminence that ſeveral of the Ancients have over the Moderns; but I have ſufficiently ſhewn in the <hi>Advancement of Modern Poetry,</hi> that that actual Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence proceeded from accidental Cauſes, and not from any Superiority of Faculties in thoſe ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.</p>

I will not deny but that <hi>Waller</hi> has Sweetneſs, and <hi>Denham</hi> Force; but their good and their ſhining Qualities are ſo ſophiſticated and debauch'd with theſe modern Vices of Conceit, and Point, and Turn, and Epigram, that 'tis impoſſible they can affect in an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary manner thoſe who have been long acquainted with the Ancients.</p>
            <p>There is in the 38<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and the 39<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Pages another Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency, which I deſire to lay before the Reader. In the 38<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Page he ſpeaks of <hi>Horace</hi> thus:</p>
            <q>
               <l>He who ſupreme in Judgment as in Wit,</l>

            </q>
            <p>Before he goes ten Lines farther, he forgets himſelf, and commends <hi>Longinus</hi> for the very contrary Quality for which he commended <hi>Horace,</hi> and for the very ſame thing for which he condemns his Contemporaries.</p>
            <q>
               <l>The Muſes ſure <hi>Longinus</hi> did inſpire,</l>

            </q>
            <p>He commends <hi>Horace</hi> for judging cooly in Verſe, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tols <hi>Longinus</hi> for criticizing with Fire in Proſe. What a miſerable Slave is this Author to Opinion? Can any thing be more plain, than that he condemns his Contempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for no other reaſon but becauſe they are his Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraries; and commends <hi>Longinus</hi> for no other reaſon but becauſe he has been approv'd of by others. For why ſhould not a modern Critick imitate the great Qualities of <hi>Longinus</hi>; and when he treats of a Subject which is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime, treat of it ſublimely? Now he who writes any thing with Sublimity, let it be Proſe or Verſe, let it be Criticiſm or Poetry, writes ſometimes with Fury, as <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginus</hi> hath ſhewn both by his Doctrine and his Example in the firſt Chapter of his Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>But pray who are theſe Moderns that judge with Fury, and write with Flegm? Who are they that have writ both Criticiſm and Poetry, who have not in their Poetry ſhewn a thouſand times this Eſſayer's Fire?

And they who are alive cannot poſſibly tell whether that period hath happen'd or not: If that period has not yet happen'd; yet 'tis not the Obſoleteneſs of Language which makes a Poet fall from the Reputation which he once enjoy'd, provided the Language in which that Poet wrote was at the Time of his Writing come to be capable of Harmony. For <hi>Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi> is obſolete, yet is ſtill renown'd. That which makes an Author fall from his former Reputation, is, ſays <hi>Boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leau,</hi> in his ſeventh Reflection upon <hi>Longinus,</hi> his not
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0143100400:27"/>
having attain'd to that Point of Solidity and Perfection, which are neceſſary to give a never dying Eſteem to his Works. For Example, ſays he, the Latin Tongue in which <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> wrote, was already very much alter'd in the Time of <hi>Quintilian</hi> and of <hi>Aulus Gellius</hi>; and yet <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> were more eſteem'd when thoſe Criticks wrote, than they were in their own Age, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had as it were by their Writings fix'd the <hi>Roman</hi> Language, having attain'd to that Point of Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and Perfection which I have mention'd above.</p>
            <p>If we reflect upon that miſerable Taſt which reigns now among our Readers, and that want of Genius which is ſo deplorable in our preſent Writers, and that Taſt and Genius daily more and more decline, we may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being Prophets foretel, according to the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd Obſervation of the Solidity and Perfection of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems, that the Language is not like to alter to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage of thoſe Poets, whoſe Works are the only Remains of them here below. But be that as it will, yet this is certain, that Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> had one Quality in his Language, which <hi>Chaucer</hi> had not, and which muſt always remain. For having acquir'd ſome Juſtneſs of Numbers, and ſome Truth of Harmony and of Verſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, to which <hi>Chaucer</hi> thro' the Rudeneſs of the Language, or want of Ear, or want of Experience, or rather perhaps a mixture of all, could not poſſibly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that Juſtneſs of Numbers, and Truth of Harmony and of Verſification can never be deſtroy'd by any altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Language; and therefore Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> whatever alteration happens to the Language, can never be like to <hi>Chaucer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherever this Gentleman talks of Wit, he is ſure to ſay ſomething that is very fooliſh, as Page 29.</p>
            <q>
               <l>What is this Wit that does our Cares employ,</l>
               <l>The Owner's Wife that other Men enjoy?</l>
               <l>The more his Trouble as the more admir'd,</l>
               <l>Where wanted ſcorn'd, and envy'd where acquir'd.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Here again I deſire leave to ask two or three Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions. Firſt, how can Wit be ſcorn'd where it is not? Is not this a Figure frequently employ'd in <hi>Hibernian</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0143100400:28"/>
Land? The Perſon who wants this Wit may indeed be ſcorn'd; but ſuch a Contempt declares the Honour that the Contemner has for Wit. But ſecondly, what does he mean by acquir'd Wit? Does he mean Genius by the word Wit, or Conceit and Point? If he means Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, that is certainly never to be acquir'd; and the Perſon who ſhould pretend to acquire it, would be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſecure from Envy. But if by Wit he means Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit and Point, thoſe are things that ought never to be in Poetry, unleſs by chance ſometimes in the Epigram, or in Comedy, where it is proper to the Character and the Occaſion; and ev'n in Comedy it ought always to give place to Humour, and ev'n to be loſt and abſorp'd in that, according to the Precept of the noble Author of the <hi>Eſſay on Poetry.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>That ſilly thing Men call ſheer Wit avoid,</l>
               <l>With which our Age ſo nauſeouſly is cloy'd;</l>
               <l>Humour is all, Wit ſhould be only brought</l>
               <l>To turn agreeably ſome proper Thought.</l>
            </q>
            <p>In the beginning of the 33<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Page there is a Couplet of Advice, the firſt line of which is very impertinent, and the ſecond very wrong.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Be ſilent always when you doubt your Senſe.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Now who are the Perſons to whom he is giving Advice here? Why, to Poets or Criticks, or both; but the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to whom he ought to be ſpeaking are Criticks, that is, People who pretend to inſtruct others. But can any man of common Senſe want to be told, that he ought not to pretend to inſtruct others, as long as he doubts of the Truth of his own Precepts?</p>
            <p>But what can be more wrong or more abſurd than the latter Verſe of the Couplet?</p>
            <q>
               <l>Speak when you're ſure, yet ſpeak with Diffidence.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Now I ſhould think that when a man is ſure, 'tis his Duty to ſpeak with a modeſt Aſſurance; ſince in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing otherwiſe he betrays the Truth, eſpecially when he
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0143100400:29"/>
ſpeaks to thoſe who are guided more by Imagination than they are by Judgment, which is the Caſe of three parts of the World, and three parts of the other Part.</p>
            <p>He is ſo great a Lover of Falſhood, that whenever he has a mind to calumniate his Contemporaries, he up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braids them with ſome Defect, which is juſt contrary to ſome good Quality for which all their Friends and their Acquaintance commend them. As for Example, if a Man is remarkable for the extraordinary Deference which he pays to the Opinions and the Remonſtrances of his Friends, him he Libels for his Impatience under Reproof. On the contrary, if he has a mind to extol the Ancients, he paſſes by either thro' Envy or Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance all the great Qualities which they have, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tols them for ſome peculiar one, the very want of which is known to all the World to be their Infirmity and their Defect. Thus in the 37<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Page he takes occaſion to commend <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> for what he wrote in Phyſicks, a great deal of which is ſo juſtly cenſur'd and condemn'd ev'n by the ſame learned and judicious Men, who allow his <hi>Aethicks,</hi> his <hi>Politicks,</hi> his <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> and his <hi>Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi> to be worthy of the greateſt Philoſopher. And here as the Commendation which he gives him is falſe, the manner of giving it is ſtill more falſe. For, ſays he,</p>
            <q>
               <l>Not only Nature did his Laws obey,</l>
               <l>But Fancy's boundleſs Empire own'd his Sway.</l>
            </q>
            <p>The Expreſſion in the firſt Verſe is not only abſurd, but blaſphemous. The Laws of Nature are unalterable and indiſpenſable but by God himſelf; and the greateſt Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to which the wiſeſt Philoſopher can attain, is not to controul, but to obey Nature.</p>
            <p>In the Libel upon King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, he has not only endeavour'd to brand the Memory of that Prince for ſomething which is utterly falſe, but for ſomething which if it had been true had been an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence in that Prince. For <hi>Wits,</hi> ſays he, in that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch's Reign had Penſions, when all the World knows that it was one of the Faults of that Reign that none
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0143100400:30"/>
of the politer Arts were then encourag'd. For of this we may be ſure, that whenever we have a Prince and Miniſters, who truly underſtand either their own Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, or that of the Publick, Arts and Learning will be then encourag'd; I mean not ſpeciouſly and pretended<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but really and ſincerely.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>France</hi> pretended to encourage Arts by allowing Penſions to ſome few Profeſſors of them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as at the ſame time he was and is doing a thing, which has a natural Tendency to the driving them out of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi> For by kindling and proſecuting an unjuſt War thro' ſo many different Nations, he has gone a very great way towards the barbarizing the Chriſtian World; and the Arts would have been at a much greater height, than they are now, without any manner of Encouragement from him, if they had been ſuffer'd to have enjoy'd the Quiet of an univerſal Peace. In the ſame manner ſome Perſons of Quality in <hi>Great Britain</hi> have been kind to ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Profeſſors of Poetry; but at the very ſame time, by not only introducing the <hi>Italian</hi> Opera among us, but by continuing conſtant Encouragers of it to this very day, they are doing a thing which will drive the very Art it ſelf out of the Kingdom, as it has been already driven out of every other Nation; and are depriving their Favourite Authors of more than ever they yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd upon them. Any great Miniſter would now have a glorious Opportunity of being a true Encourager of Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and ev'ry other generous Art, by repreſenting ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually to her Majeſty the Miſchief that the <hi>Italians</hi> do both to her Subjects, and to the Arts, and ſo driving thoſe melodious Ballad-Singers out of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>But to return to the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, from which I may ſeem to have in ſome meaſure digreſs'd; there was then indeed a favourable regard ſhewn to Wit, but no real Encouragement. <hi>Butler</hi> was ſtarv'd at the ſame time that the King had his Book in his Poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket. Another great Wit lay ſeven Years in Priſon for an inconſiderable Debt, and <hi>Otway</hi> dar'd not to ſhew his Head for fear of the ſame Fate. Theſe are ſome of the Glories of that Reign according to this Author. For if it be a Vice in a Prince to encourage an Art, 'tis a Vertue
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0143100400:31"/>
to neglect it. What a wretched Creature is this Pretender to Criticiſm and Poetry to keep ſuch a pother about an Art, the Encouragement of which he imputes as Infamy to King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second?</p>
            <p>Well! but he tells us that not only</p>
            <q>
               <l>The Wits had Penſions, but young Lords had Wit.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Here in the compaſs of one poor Line are two deviliſh Bobs for the Court. But 'tis no eaſy matter to tell which way the latter ſquinting Reflection looks. For if he pretends to reflect upon that Prince, for receiving Perſons of Quality who had Wit into his Court, can any thing be more imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent than twice in one Line to libel a Monarch for being favourable to that very thing, which he takes ſo much pains in this very Book to recommend to the World? If he means that the young Lords of the Court who pretended to Wit had it not, can any thing be more arrogant than to fly in the Face of all Mankind, and to contradict almoſt the only thing in which all ſorts of People agree, ev'n in this divided Age, <hi>Britons</hi> and Foreigners, Proteſtants and Papiſts, Whigs and Tories, Churchmen and Diſſenters, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to reflect upon Perſons whoſe very Names are their Panegyricks? The young Lords who had Wit in the Court of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, are theſe: The young former Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> the young Earl of <hi>Mulgrave</hi> now Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> the young Lord <hi>Buckhurſt</hi> afterwards Earl of <hi>Dorſet</hi> and <hi>Middleſex,</hi> and the young Marqueſs of <hi>Halifax</hi>; the young Earl of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> the young Lord <hi>Vaughan</hi> now Lord <hi>Carbury,</hi> and ſeveral others. If the looking favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably upon young Perſons of Quality who had Wit, may be imputed as Scandal to the Court of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, that Court was certainly the moſt ſcandalous one in <hi>Europe.</hi> But if he ſays on the other ſide that 'tis diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to a Prince to be miſtaken in this Point, and to look with a favourable Eye on Pretenders inſtead of real Maſters; to that all the World with one accord wlll an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that never Prince had a clearer Reputation in this Point.</p>
            <p>Thus are his Aſſertions, and his Precepts frequently falſe or trivial, or both, his Thoughts very often crude and abortive, his Expreſſions abſurd, his Numbers often harſh
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0143100400:32"/>
and unmuſical, without Cadence and without Variety, his Rhimes trivial and common. He dictates perpetually, and pretends to give Law without any thing of the Simplicity or Majeſty of a Legiſlator, and pronounces Sentence with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any thing of the Plainneſs or Clearneſs, or Gravity of a Judge. Inſtead of Simplicity we have little Conceit and Epigram, and Affectation. Inſtead of Majeſty we have ſomething that is very mean, and inſtead of Gravity we have ſomething that is very boyiſh. And inſtead of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuity and lucid Order, we have but too often Obſcurity and Confuſion.</p>
            <p>But what moſt ſhews him a very young Author, is, that with all theſe Faults and this Weakneſs he has the Inſolence of a Hero, and is a downright Bully of <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> who is ev'ry moment thundr'ing out Fool, Sot, Fop, Coxcomb, Blockhead, and thinks to hide his want of Senſe by his pretended Contempt of others, as a Hector does his want of Courage by his perpetual bluſtring and roaring; and is ſagaciouſly of Opinion, that he arrogates ſo much Senſe to himſelf as he imputes Folly to other People.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Thus a wild <hi>Tartar</hi> when he ſpies</l>
               <l>A Man that's handſome, valiant, wiſe,</l>
               <l>Thinks if he kills him to inherit</l>
               <l>His Wit, his Beauty, and his Spirit,</l>
               <l>As if juſt ſo much he enjoy'd</l>
               <l>As in another he deſtroy'd.</l>
            </q>
            <p>By what he ſays Page the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, and his returning to the Charge, Page 34, his particular Pique ſeems to be at People of Quality, for whom he appears to have a very great Contempt, I mean for the Authors of that Rank; as if a Man were to aſſert his Title to <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> by proving himſelf a Plebeian in <hi>Great Britain</hi>; or as if an <hi>Engliſh</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign by making a Man honourable, made him dull. Good Gods, how abſolute would our Princes be at that rate! when they would have the very Underſtandings of their Subjects at their diſpoſal, and would need only to prefer the Diſobedient to chaſtiſe them.</p>
            <p>I hope, I may without offence, gently put young Mr. <hi>Bays</hi> in mind, that the Subordination which is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to the Government of the World requires
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0143100400:33"/>
that Reſpect ſhould be paid to Perſons of Quality, ev'n where Eſteem cannot be paid to them; but that in this caſe they both may and ought to have our Reſpect and Eſteem together. For I know very few People of Quality who have applied themſelves to Poetry, who have not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded; on the other ſide 'tis known to all the World that ſome of them have been admirable. For nothing is more certain than that ſuppoſing equal Talent and equal Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, a Man of Quality has great Advantages over the reſt of Men. But can any thing be more ſtupidly impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and impertinent, than that this little Gentleman ſhould rail thus at the Writings of People of Quality in this very Eſſay, the one half of which he has borrow'd from two noble Authors, and appropriated it to himſelf, by the ſame Method by which a <hi>Jack-pudding</hi> engroſſes a Sack-poſſet, <hi>viz.</hi> by mingling ſome Beaſtlineſs with it, which does not fail to render it nauſeous to thoſe who made it. This extraordinary Proceeding of borrowing and railing puts me in mind of a Paſſage in Mr. <hi>Cowley.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>'Tis now become the frugal Faſhion</l>
               <l>Rather to bide than pay the Obligation;</l>
               <l>Nay Wrongs and Outrages we do,</l>
               <l>Lest Men ſhould think we Owe.</l>
            </q>
            <p>But the Men of Quality, as they want not the Diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will have the Satisfaction to ſee, that as there is a great deal of Venom in this little Gentleman's Temper, Nature has very wiſely corrected it with a great deal of Dulneſs.</p>
            <q>
               <l>His rankest Libels lull aſleep his Foes,</l>
               <l>As Vipers blood in Treacle makes us doſe.</l>
            </q>
            <p>As there is no Creature in Nature ſo venomous, there is nothing ſo ſtupid and ſo impotent as a hunch-back'd Toad; and a Man muſt be very quiet and very paſſive, and ſtand ſtill to let him faſten his Teeth and his Claws, or be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd ſleeping by him, before that Animal can have any power to hurt him.</p>
            <p>Thus in order to find out his outward Perſon, have we taken a Survey of his inward Man, in his ſeveral noble Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0143100400:34"/>
and Vertues, his Poetry, his Criticiſm, his Modeſty, his Humility, his Gratitude, and his good Breeding. Let us now take a Survey of his Politicks, and his Religion, not by any means by way of Reflection; for Poetry and Criticiſm are of no Party, and of no Religion, but only to find who he is.</p>
            <p>I find then that in the compaſs of one Page, which is the thirty firſt, he has Libell'd two Monarchs and two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The two Monarchs are King <hi>Charles</hi> and King <hi>William:</hi> The two Nations are the <hi>Dutch</hi> and our own. The <hi>Dutch</hi> we are told are a parcel of Sharpers, and we are downright Bubbles and Fools. King <hi>Charles</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond was too much a Libertine, and too much an Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rager of Wit for him; King <hi>William</hi> the Third was too much a <hi>Socinian.</hi> But tho' he has without Mercy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd the Reigns of the foremention'd Monarchs, he is graciouſly pleas'd to paſs over in ſilence that which comes between them. In the beginning of the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Page, we find what that is which ſo happily reconcil'd him to it, and that was the Diſpenſing Pow'r, which was ſet on foot in order to introduce and to eſtabliſh Popery, and to make it the National Religion. Now I humbly conceive that he who Libels our Confederates, muſt be by Politicks a <hi>Jacobite</hi>; and he who Libels all the Proteſtant Kings that we have had in this Iſland theſe threeſcore Years, and who juſtifies the Diſpenſing Pow'r ſo long after we are free'd from it, a Pow'r which as was hinted above was ſet on foot on purpoſe to introduce Popery: He who juſtifies this when he lyes under the Tye of no Neceſſity, nor ev'n Conveniency to approve of it, muſt, I humbly conceive, derive his Religion from St. <hi>Omer</hi>'s, as he ſeems to have done his Humanity and his Criticiſm; and is, I ſuppoſe, politickly ſetting up for Poet-Laureat againſt the coming over of the Pretender, which by his Inſolence he ſeems to believe approaching, as People of his Capacity are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally very ſanguine.</p>
            <p>Let us now ſee if we can find any thing in his Rhimes, which may direct us to his Coffee-houſe, or to his Bookſellers. By his taking three Opportunities to commend Mr. <hi>Dryden,</hi> in ſo ſmall a compaſs as p. 23, 27, 28, I fancy we may hear of him at <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s Head, or at <hi>Will</hi>'s, for to revive old Quarrels which
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0143100400:35"/>
have been long out of doors, and to renew the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Poetical Wars wag'd formerly between Sir <hi>R. B.</hi> Mr. <hi>L. M.</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dryden,</hi> can be agreeable to none but a very few of the Frequenters of thoſe Places. This is to run counter to his own Direction; for he tells us Page 27. that formerly</p>
            <q>
               <l>Pride, Malice, Folly against <hi>Dryden</hi> roſe</l>
               <l>In various ſhapes of Parſons, Criticks, Beaus.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Upon which, Page 28, he gives this grave Advice,</p>
            <q>
               <l>Be thou the first true Merit to befriend,</l>
               <l>His Praiſe is lost who ſtays till all commend.</l>
            </q>
            <p>The appearing in Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s behalf now is too late. 'Tis like offering a Man's ſelf for a Second, after the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal has been whipp'd through the Lungs. Now Mr. <hi>Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> is dead, he commends him with the reſt of the World. But if this little Gentleman had been his Contemporary thirty Years ago, why then I can tell a very damn'd ſhape that Pride and Malice, and Folly would have appear'd in againſt Mr. <hi>Dryden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For his Acquaintance he names Mr. <hi>Walſh.</hi> I had the good Fortune to know Mr. <hi>Walſh</hi> very well; who was a learned, candid, judicious Gentleman. But he had by no means the Qualification which this Author reckons abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to a Critick; it being certain that Mr. <hi>Walſh</hi> was like this Eſſayer a very indifferent Poet; but he was a Man of a very good Underſtanding, in ſpight of his being a Beau. He lov'd to be well dreſs'd, as <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimant</hi> ſays, and thought it no Diſparagement to his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; and I remember a little young Gentleman, with all the Qualifications which we have found to be in this Author, whom Mr. <hi>Walſh</hi> us'd ſometimes to take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Company as a double Foil to his Perſon, and his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity. It has been obſerv'd that of late Years a certain Spectre exactly in the ſhape of that little Gentleman, has haunted a certain ancient Wit, and has been by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Covent-Garden</hi> ſtyl'd his evil Genius. For it hath been extremely remarkable, that while that Spectre hath haunted that ancient Wit, he has never been able to write
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0143100400:36"/>
or talk like himſelf: Which has by no means happen'd by any Decay of his natural Parts, but by the wonderful Pow'r of Magick. For as ſoon as the dumb Conjurer has been employ'd to lay the Spectre for three or four months, either in the midſt of the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> or the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of <hi>Windſor-Foreſt,</hi> the old Gentleman has ſtrait been his own Man as perfectly as ever he was in his Life.</p>
            <p>And now if you have a mind to enquire between <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-Hill</hi> and <hi>Ockingham,</hi> for a young, ſquab, ſhort Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, with the forementioned Qualifications, an eternal Writer of Amorous Paſtoral Madrigals, and the very Bow of the God of Love, you will be ſoon directed to him. And pray as ſoon as you have taken a Survey of him, tell me whether he is a proper Author to make per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Reflections on others; and tell him if he does not like my Perſon, 'tis becauſe he is an ungrateful Creature, ſince his Conſcience tells him, that I have been always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely delighted with his: So delighted, that I have lately drawn a very graphical Picture of it; but I believe I ſhall keep the <hi>Dutch</hi> Piece from ever ſeeing the Light, as a certain old Gentleman in <hi>Windſor-Forest</hi> would have done by the Original, if he durſt have been half as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial to his own Draught as I have been to mine. This little Author may extol the Ancients as much and as long as he pleaſes, but he has reaſon to thank the good Gods that he was born a Modern. For had he been born of <hi>Graecian</hi> Parents, and his Father by conſequence had by Law had the abſolute Diſpoſal of him, his Life had been no longer than that of one of his Poems, the Life of half a day. Inſtead of ſetting his Picture to ſhow, I have taken a keener Revenge, and expos'd his Intellectuals, as duly conſidering that let the Perſon of a Gentleman of his Parts be never ſo contemptible, his inward Man is ten times more ridiculous; it being impoſſible that his outward Form, tho' it ſhould be that of downright Monkey, ſhould differ ſo much from human Shape, as his immaterial unthinking part does from human Underſtanding. How agreeable it is to be in a Libel with ſo much good Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as I have been, with two great Monarchs, two mighty Nations, and eſpecially the People of Quality of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and this Libel compos'd by a little Gentleman, who has writ a Panegyrick upon himſelf!

                  <hi>Horace</hi> has giv'n a Precept, which may be quoted by undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing People to keep this in countenance.</p>

               </q>
               <p>For he bids the Perſon to whom this is directed conſult Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but then he does three things, which vaſtly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh him from the Writer of the Eſſay: For firſt he makes it very plain what ſort of Perſon this is to whom he directs himſelf, and that is <hi>Doctus Imitator,</hi> one who is both Poet and Critick, Dramatick Poet, and Dramatick Critick; one who writes Plays, and underſtands the Rules, and knows the Secrets of his Art; notwithſtanding which, he may be ignorant of that important one, which <hi>Horace</hi> is about to diſcover to him; or in caſe he does already know it, he may want to be put in mind of it, becauſe his Intereſt, as we ſhall find anon, is a ſtrong Temptation to deviate from it. But ſecondly <hi>Horace</hi> tells us very intelligibly what he
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0143100400:38"/>
means by Nature here, and that is, human Life, and the manners of Men. Thirdly, he makes it as clear as the Sun, what it is to follow Nature in giving a draught of human Life, and of the manners of Men, and that is not to draw after particular Men, who are but Copies and imperfect Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of the great univerſal Pattern; but to conſult that innate Original, and that univerſal Idea, which the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor has fix'd in the minds of ev'ry reaſonable Creature, and ſo to make a true and a juſt Draught. For as ev'ry Copy deviates from the Original both in Life and Grace, and Reſemblance, a Poet who deſigns to give a true Draught of human Life and Manners, muſt conſult the univerſal Idea, and not particular Perſons. For Example, when a Poet would draw the Character of a covetous or a revengeful perſon, he is not to draw after <hi>Lucius</hi> or <hi>Caius</hi>; but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the univerſal pattern within him, and there to behold what Revenge or Covetouſneſs would do in ſuch and ſuch Natures, upon ſuch and ſuch Occaſions. For if he draws after <hi>Lucius</hi> or <hi>Caius,</hi> the workings of Revenge and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs in theſe two, being but Copies and imperfect Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of their workings according to the univerſal <hi>Idea,</hi> and the Poet degenerating in his Draught ev'n from thoſe faint and imperfect Copies, whenever a juſt and diſcerning Judge comes to compare that Draught with the Original within him, he immediately finds that that Draught falls extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhort of the Truth of Nature, and immediately diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves of it, as a ſecond, ungraceful, faint, unreſembling Copy. Agreeable to this is that paſſage of the moſt diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Author of the Eſſay upon Poetry.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>If once the Juſtneſs of each part is lost,</l>
                  <l>Well may we laugh, but at the Poet's cost.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Thus <hi>Horace</hi> here ſpeaks to the Knowing, yet tells them ſomething that ſeveral of them want to be taught, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral to be put in mind of. For it has been a Complaint of Two thouſand Years ſtanding, that Poets have been us'd to violate their Subjects, and to force their Characters out of complaiſance to their Actors, that is, to their Intereſt. Moſt of the Writers for the Stage in my time, have not only adapted their Characters to their Actors, but thoſe Actors have as it were ſate for them. For which reaſon the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0143100400:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Luſtre of the moſt ſhining of their Characters muſt decay with the Actors, while thoſe of <hi>Sophocles, Euripides, Terence,</hi> and <hi>Ben Johnſon</hi> will eternally remain.</p>

               <p>2. <hi>Still green with</hi> Bays <hi>each ancient Altar ſtands,</hi> p. 13.</p>
               <p>If Mr. <hi>Bays</hi> ſhould ſay here that by each ancient Altar he does not mean ev'ry ancient Poet, but only thoſe few who have been admir'd by all ſucceeding Ages; to this I anſwer, that beſides that the Expreſſion will by no means bear this Senſe, it appears plainly from the two firſt lines of p. 12. that he ſpeaks of the Ancients in general.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>And tho' the Ancients thus their Rules invade,</l>

                  </l>
               </q>
               <p>I think nothing can be more plain, than that here he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers all the Ancients before all the Moderns, treating the former as ſo many Monarchs and Legiſlators at the ſame time in the Regions of Senſe, and the latter as ſo many Slaves. Beſides that theſe Verſes manifeſtly relate rather to the indifferent Poets among the Ancients, than to thoſe who are admirable; for the indifferent ones have moſt and oftneſt invaded the Rules, Indeed they have ſcarce ever obſerv'd them; as <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> have ſcarce ever tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs'd them.</p>
