            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE kind Reception this Book has met with from the Publick, appears by nothing more than the quick Sale of the former Editions: There have not been many Phyſick Books, in Reſpect to the large Number that have been publiſh'd, of which Three Thouſand Copies have in ſo ſhort a Time been diſpos'd of; but its having been well received, and ſo much call'd for, ſince out of <hi>Print,</hi> is not the only Motive of reprinting it; the great good the Medicines preſcribed in it have done and daily do to abundance of People afflicted with Diſeaſes of the <hi>Head, Brain,</hi> and <hi>Nerves,</hi> as alſo to thoſe oppreſs'd with <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly</hi> and <hi>Vapours,</hi> is another of much greater weight; for it being reaſonable to believe there are many hundreds of Perſons troubled with thoſe Diſeaſes, who have not yet ſeen it, and who by reading it may meet with their Cure, as vaſt Numbers have already done, I thought my ſelf for their Sakes, as well as my own Advantage, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to ſend it again to the Preſs; and upon looking it over carefully with that Intention, I did not find occaſion for any very material Additions, and therefore omitted ſome of ſlight Conſequence I might have made, purely becauſe thoſe who have bought the other Editions, might not think themſelves impos'd upon or be obliged to buy this Fourth, which for that Reaſonis ſent into the World again exactly as before, ſome very few Corrections excepted.</p>
            <p>Of all the Diſeaſes incident to Mankind, there are none more dangerous and mortal than thoſe of the <hi>Head,</hi> and <hi>Brain,</hi> and this my Experience in the Cure of thoſe Diſeaſes has convinced me of, tho' I muſt do my ſelf Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice in declaring, that I have had as few Patients miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carryed, conſidering the Number I have in my Time at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ended, as perhaps any Phyſician before me: And have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ured ſome who have been ſo very bad, through delay or
<pb facs="tcp:0510901800:4"/>improper Medicines, that there was ſcarce a Probability of reſtoring. The Melancholly Circumſtances of Perſons ſo afflicted, is matter of great Concern, becauſe we daily find ignorant Men, who would be thought Doctors, tampering in thoſe Diſeaſes, as if there were no danger in them at all; but this in our days is but what was in the days of our Predeceſſors, tho' more now than then, the Art of Phyſick being ſurely never more abuſed than at this time, and that becauſe there is no Puniſhment inflicted on them beſides Reproach, which they ſo little care for, that from their wonted Aſſurance they nothing leſs than laugh at.</p>
            <p>The mature Conſideration of this, and the Miſchiefs I my ſelf have ſeen in my Practice, by inſignificant or impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Medicines and Management, together with the Succeſs I have had in many deſperate Diſeaſes of the <hi>Head,</hi> firſt put me upon writing this Treatiſe, this Fourth Edition of which, I am in hopes will be as kindly accepted by thoſe ſo afflicted, as I am ſure they will upon Tryal find the Methods and Medicines directed to, anſwer what is ſaid of them.</p>
            <p>The Title Page tells you, It is a Treatiſe of Diſeaſes of the <hi>Head, Brain,</hi> and <hi>Nerves;</hi> and ſo it is, but as the Eyes, Noſe, Tongue, Teeth, Gums, Jaws and Palate, go to the making up of the Head, the Reader may expect perhaps, I have treated of them alſo, which he will not find done, and that becauſe it was no way material here, any further than that in Chapter the 12th, where I ſpeak of Catarrhs or Defluxions, I have ſhewn how thoſe Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours affect thoſe Parts, and that many times by the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thoſe Humours, thoſe Parts are relieved.</p>
            <p>To this Treatiſe of Diſeaſes of the <hi>Head,</hi> I have ſubjoined a Diſcourſe on <hi>Melancholly</hi> and <hi>Vapours,</hi> which tho' they are not properly Head Diſeaſes, yet bear ſuch analogy to them, or at leaſt ſo far affect either the <hi>Head, Brain, Nerves,</hi> or all, that they come properly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be conſidered here; and I perſwade my ſelf the
<pb facs="tcp:0510901800:5"/>Account given of them, will not fall very, ſhort of any Performance of the like Nature, at leaſtwiſe as to the main thing, I mean, the Curative Part, which however, will be better underſtood upon the Patient's Experience than by any thing I can ſay.</p>
            <p>I had put my Name and Place of Habitation to this Book, but that I foreſaw it might not be ſo well as let alone in this cenſorious Age, therefore reſolved againſt it, not that I have any reaſon, I thank God, to conceal my ſelf, or need be aſhamed either of one or the other; but to ſupply that want, I have taken Care to make what I have written the more Plain and Intelligible, having, in each Diſeaſe, not only preſcrib'd what Methods are to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and Medicines I have found uſeful to many, but alſo directed, at the end of the Book, where thoſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar ones I have preſcribed in it, and always found to ſtand me in ſtead on the moſt urgent Occaſions are to be had, I me an by thoſe who do not underſtand how, or care not to take the trouble of preparing them themſelves; which by being taken and uſed at the Book directs, will by the Help of God, work a perfect Cure, and the Patients have no Occaſion to trouble either themſelves or me, for any further Advice or Direction.</p>
            <p>This I thought good to hint, with an Aſſurance that what is written about the ſeveral Diſtempers, is what the Patients afflicted, too truely find, and alſo that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies for Cure, are well adapted, replete with Power to effect what is ſaid of them, and which I have the Vanity to believe, the Patient will, in ſome meaſure, give Credit to, upon the bear reading what he will find written, tho' I am not ſo weak as to expect anything that is or can be ſaid of them, will or can convince him like his making Tryal of them himſelf, my Encomiums on 'em, falling far ſhort of what his own Experiencing will prove they deſerve. Therefore the Reader is deſired to ſuſpend his Opinion of the Book and Medicines, till he has Read the
<pb facs="tcp:0510901800:6"/>former, and Tryed the latter, whatever he judges of the Author, who conceives, let what will be ſaid or thought of him, by the Method he has taken to ſerve the Publick and Himſelf, if matters not, if what is ſaid and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in the Book, anſwer but the Patient's End.</p>

               <p>THERE are Two ſorts of Head-ach, the Recent or New, and Inveterate or Old Head-ach: The former laſts but for a time only; and is either from Cold, hard Drinking, heat of the Sun, violent Exerciſe, or the like; and goes away as thoſe Occaſions wear off. The other is conſtant or laſting, with
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0510901800:8"/>very little abatement or intermiſſion, is hard to be eas'd, and which on light Occaſions, has Extream ſharp Fits, ſo that the Patient cannot endure any Noiſe or vehement Motion, or ſcarce any Light, but deſires to lye in the Dark, and be ſtill; for Noiſe, if it be great, renders him almoſt craz'd. But tho', as in ſome, the Inveterate, or Old Head-ach, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues always more or leſs, in others, it goes away and returns by Fits.</p>
               <p>They are both underſtood by the ſame common Name of the Heach-ach, but are vaſtly different as to Cure, the firſt going away upon the occaſion ceaſing, as I have already ſaid, the other, being of long ſtanding, is inveterate, and with difficulty removed; it being cauſed either thro' much Blood, Diſorder of the Stomach, or ſharp Humours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained within or without the Skull, inflaming the Head, and depraving the Senſe. If the Pain be attended with Heavineſs, it comes of Plenitude: If with pricking and ſhooting, it proceeds from ſharp Cholerick Humours: If the Head ſeems diſtended without Heavineſs and Beating, Wind is the Cauſe; but if with Beating, there is Inflammation in the Films of the Brain: If there be a Heavineſs with Diſtention, it ſhews Plenitude of Humours within the Films: If the Pain be outward, it is in the Films that cover the Scull; but if inward, and at the Roots of the Eyes, the Films that cover the Brain are griev'd. The external Pain is in the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricranium</hi> or the Membrane without the Scull, and comes for the moſt part from external Cold, becauſe a cold part will eaſily ſuffer from the like Quality; the internal Pain is always in the <hi>Meninges</hi> or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Membranes.</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0510901800:9"/>
               <p>But as the Head-ach, inveterate or old, proceeds chiefly from inward Cauſes, either from ſome fault in the Head it ſelf, or diſorder of the Stomach, I ſhall ſpeak only of that, the recent Head-ach, as already ſaid, going away of it ſelf upon a little Reſt and Regularity, without any Medicines.</p>
               <p>If the Pain proceeds from the Head eſſentially, there will be no Intermiſſion, but a continual Pain, or if the Pain does remit, it is but for a little time, and returneth again.</p>
               <p>If it proceeds from the Stomach, the Pain will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ceaſe, and return again; alſo the Appetite will decay, eſpecially if the Stomach abounds much with Flegm; but if the Stomach abounds much with Choller, there will be a Bitterneſs in the Mouth, a gnawing Pain of the Stomach, a <hi>Nauſea</hi> or loathing of Food, trembling of the Heart and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, which are much increaſed after ſleep.</p>
               <p>If the Head-ach proceeds from the Head eſſentially, I always give my following Cephalick purging Pills, which never fail moving off thoſe Humours that infeſt the Brain and its <hi>Meninges,</hi> whereby the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient has inſtant eaſe.</p>
               <p>But when the Head-ach proceeds from the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, I ever give my Emetick Pouder, preſently to be preſcrib'd, which gently and ſafely, yet thorough, ly, evacuates the offending Cauſe, and ſets the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to rights, more eſpecially if in each Caſe my Cephalick Elixir, prepar'd as follows, on the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate days be alſo taken.</p>

               <p>By the Signs before given, any one that is afflicted with the Head-ach may diſtinguiſh and know his Caſe, and accordingly with the Medicines preſcrib'd may have his Cure, they having been long expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienc'd by the Author to be the moſt effectual in thoſe Caſes. The Pills are to be taken three at a time over Night, which will the next Morning give four, five, or ſix eaſy Stools: Warm Water-gruel, Broth, Poſſet-drink or Tea, are Liquors pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to be drank as they operate, and the Patient keeping a little warm the days he takes them will be the better. They may be repeated twice or thrice in a Week, as there is Occaſion, as alſo muſt be the Emetick Pouder, which is to be taken by thoſe whoſe Stomachs being foul, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are the Cauſe of the Head-ach; but as the Pills are to be taken at Night, the Pouder is to be taken in a Morning in a Spoonful of Water-gruel, with the ſame Obſervation and Care as directed for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Pills.</p>
               <p>And on the intermediate days of taking either the Cephalick Pills, or Emetick Pouder, it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the Patient to take the Cephalick Elixir, Forty or Fifty Drops at a time, every Night and Morning in a Glaſs of Wine, Ale, Beer, Tea, Coffee or what other Liquor, pleaſes beſt, which together with the Pills or Pouder will have wonderful Effects in altering and regulating thoſe Humours that create the Diſorder and Pain in the Head.</p>

               <p>A young Lady of One and twenty Years of Age, the only Daughter of a worthy Gentleman, had been afflicted with a violent Pain of the Head from a Child, which ſhe was ſeldom or never free from, and when it was at the worſt would cauſe Vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the Megrim.</head>
               <p>THE Megrim is a vehement Pain in one half of the Head, either on the Right or Left ſide thereof, afflicting either the <hi>Teguments</hi> without the Scull, or the <hi>Meninges</hi> of the Brain within, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Quality and coming near the Nature of the Old Head-ach, ſpoken of in the 'foregoing Chapter. If it be without the Scull, the Part pain'd is moſt commonly ſo ſore that the Patient can hardly bear its being touch'd; if it be within the Scull, that Soreneſs is wanting, and the Pain is the more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Sometimes the Pain is more towards the <hi>Occiput</hi> or hinder part of the Head, and ſometimes more toward the <hi>Sinciput</hi> or fore part of the Head, or near the Root of the Eye on that ſide which is, pain'd. If it be accidental, it never afflicts the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient but upon extraordinary Occaſions; but if it be habitual, it returns either at ſet periods of Time, or keeps an uncertain irregular Courſe, being excited without any apparent Cauſe, continuing long and with that vehemency that the Patient thinks it will diſtract him.</p>
               <p>From theſe Signs it appears, that as the Megrim is from like Cauſes of the Head-ach, ſpoken of in the laſt Chapter, ſo the Cure is to be attempted; and tho' many Authors have preſcribed many Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines both for one and the other, yet they allow they are to be remedied, if ſuch a thing be to be done, with the ſame Medicines, which I alſo have experienced; and the beſt to do it, that ever I met with, are what I have recommended in the former Chapter, and which if the Patient keeps to, I mean
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0510901800:15"/>both Pills, Pouder, and Elixir, the former to be taken as mention'd, alternarely, that is, one time the Pills, the next time the Pouder, and ſo on, and the Elixir the days on which neither the Pills or Pouder are taken, will undoubtedly free the Patient therefrom, if it be in the Power of Medicine to do it. I have performed the Cure by them in ſeveral; and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in a Gentlewoman who about the time her Monthly Viſits left her, was ſo afflicted with the Megrim, ſometimes of one ſide of the Head, at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times on the other, that ſhe had very little Eaſe Night or Day; She relating her Caſe to me, I gave her both my Pills, Pouder, and Elixir, which in five Weeks carryed off her Pain perfectly, ſo that ſhe was, and is as free from it as ever in her Life, tho' it is many Months ſince.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP III.</hi> Of the Vertigo, Giddineſs or Swimming of the Head.</head>
               <p>THE Vertigo, Giddineſs or Swimming of the Head, is a Diſeaſe in the Cavities of the Brain, cauſing the Patient to think all things turn round, and many times cauſes him to ſtagger and reel, and ſometimes to fall down, the Brain and Senſes being diſturb'd, but often times without any Pain, by a preternatural Exagitation and Commotion, yet depriving not the Patient of either Senſe or Motion.</p>
               <p>This Diſeaſe is twofold, one <hi>Simple,</hi> wherein the Sight remains unhurt, the other <hi>Complex,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Sight is darkened, as it were, with a Miſt or Cloud, and is call'd <hi>Scotoma.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Signs by which the Vertigo is known, is, by what has been ſaid, only when the Diſeaſe is recent
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0510901800:16"/>or but gentle, the Patient ſeldom falls, but ſtaggers as it were, a little, and is confounded in his Mind by a certain kind of Amazement, from the ſudden Exagitation of the Animal Spirits, ſo that if he be walking he knows not where he is, but muſt be forc'd to ſtand ſtill to conſult the place of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Station, whither he is going and what is the Occaſion, becauſe a ſtrange kind of Forgetfulneſs ſeizes him, notwithſtanding all this while his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Senſes are not ſo diſturbed, but that he knows he is about Buſineſs, tho' the particulars be forgotten, which after a little pauſe he recollects again, and becomes perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Sometimes, as already ſaid, this Affect is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with Dimneſs and Darkneſs of the Sight, repreſenting variety of Colours, and things to look double and treble, in which Caſe not only all the other Symptoms are exiſtent, but the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution or Rotation of Things ſeem to be with a great Violence or Vehemency, inſomuch that when the Paroxyſm ſeizes the Patient, he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily fall, unleſs he catches hold of ſomething to ſupport himſelf.</p>
               <p>This Diſeaſe happens chiefly in Winter, and to People that are faſting, and is of very dangerous Conſequence if not in time remedied; for it comes from Blood and Humours in the Brain, but chiefly from cold Humours and flatulent Vapours ariſing from the Stomach or other inferior Parts, cauſing a continual Pain in the Head, Noiſe in the Ears, Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Senſes, Loſs of Smelling and ſometimes of Taſting; and if it comes by conſent of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, then there follows a gnawing Pain of the Stomach, Trembling, and ſometimes Vomiting, with a bad Digeſtion.</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0510901800:17"/>
               <p>When the Vertigo has been of long ſtanding, it generally terminates in a <hi>Scotoma</hi> and too quickly then changes into pernicious Diſeaſes, as the Falling Sickneſs and Apoplexy. If it happens to old People it is the more dangerous, becauſe of the Weakneſs of their Brain, Smallneſs of their Heat and their abounding much with Flegm. If in any that have this Diſeaſe, Things appear to their Eyes bloody and reddiſh, it foretells Madneſs; if purple Colour, the Falling Sickneſs eſpecially ſuch as have the <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toma,</hi> or dark Vertigo. Sometimes the Cauſe of a Vertigo has been from a Bladder of Water contain'd in one of the Ventricles of the Brain, caſt off from the vitiated Blood thither, and is ſeldom if ever curable, tho' the Patient at the ſame time Eats, Drinks, and Digeſts well. I never knew one cured when it had been ſo, but have been an Eye Witneſs to thoſe that have dyed thereof, and one particular Man of Seventy odd Years of Age who was diſſected, who, tho' he was troubled with a Vertigo, was otherwiſe conſtantly in perfect Health. At firſt the Fits came upon him but two or three times a Year, afterwards they came once a Month, and as he grew older and older, the Diſeaſe grew ſtronger and ſtronger, and the Paroxyſms more frequent and of longer continuance, till at length he had a Fit once a Week: The laſt Fit he had, he complain'd that all things turn'd round violently, and altho' he lean'd upon a Table, call'd out vehemently for ſome body to hold him, for elſe he ſhould fall by the haſty turning round of Things. He deſired to go to Bed forthwith, which he did, and whilſt he lay ſtill, he ſeem'd to be ſomewhat pacify'd; but upon the leaſt turning of his Head or any part of his Body, he cryed out that the Bed
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0510901800:18"/>and Houſe would be turned topſy turvy; and all this while he had no Convulſion, Frenzy or Madneſs, or the leaſt appearance of a Fever, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept about four or five Hours before his Death. As I ſaid before, when this Man's Head was open'd, there was found a Bladder of Water about the bigneſs of a Pigeon's Egg, lying in the 'foremoſt Ventricle of the Brain, which alone was the Cauſe of his Death. The Cure of a Vertigo, if it be ſimple, is not very difficult, it being to be done moſt commonly by Medicines that diſcuſs the flatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Spirits, which trouble the Ventricles of the Brain, or that ſtill and quiet the too great Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the Animal Spirits, and that comfort and ſtrengthen the Brain that is hurt or weaken'd by the ſaid Flatulency and Irregularities of the Spirits. The firſt is perform'd by heating Cephalicks in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly and outwardly, which have Power to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſs any Ventoſity lodged in the Cortex of the Brain.

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of Forgetfulneſs or Dotage.</head>
               <p>FOrgetfulneſs is a Diſeaſe proceeding from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lign Vapours, or an over hot, or over cold and moiſt Temperament of the Brain, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Animal Spirits either too Volatile, that the Thoughts are not to be contracted, or elſe too Torpid, diminiſhing the natural Heat, that the Perſon is dull, ſluggiſh, has no Memory, and can think of nothing as he ſhould.</p>
               <p>The Cauſes of thoſe malign Vapours, or over hot, or cold and moiſt Temperament of the Brain, are either Natural or Preternatural: If they proceed
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0510901800:21"/>from Natural Cauſes, as ſometimes they do, from an ill Conformity of the Head and Brain, or over great Thickneſs of the ſame, or from too ſtrait or wide Paſſages, by which the Spirits are either too much compreſſed or dilated, they are ſcarcely to be remedied. But if the Cauſes be from Polſon taken, or too many Narcotick Medicines, or from over Watchings, too much Care, bad Air, Sickneſs, or the like, they may in time be remedied; but if from Falls or Blows, that the Brain is concuſſed, and the Animal Spirits diſſipated or ſpent, are incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for in Youth they breed Folly, and in People of Years Dotage,</p>
               <p>But Dotage does not happen altogether to old People neither, for as it is a Depravation of the Fancy and Rational Faculty, ariſing from an Irregular Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſm of the Brain, by a Fault of the Animal Spirits which are clouded, darken'd, made black, thick, and opacous, young People may be liable to it as well as old. The Signs of Dotage in the beginning of the Diſtemper, are perceived by the Patient's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much more Talkative than uſual, (eſpecially thoſe that are of few Words when they are well) and in thoſe that uſed to be very Taltative when well, it is perceived by their ſitting very mute, taking no Notice of any thing, and as it were thinking intentively on ſomething, tho' when ask'd, can give no Account of what. In the height of Dotage, in a mild temper'd Perſon, there is Fierce. neſs, Ribaldry and Scurrilous Language, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Eyes quick, they being affected by Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0510901800:22"/>and fooliſh, the Patient being apt to be buſied about Toys and Trifles, if not down-right Folly, which ſhews the principal Faculties of the Mind are extreamly depraved.</p>
               <p>Theſe Diſeaſes are commonly without any Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger attending as to Life, but if they happen to Children very young, they oftentimes make the Child a Fool; but taken in time are to be cured, and ſo are they many times in People of Years, but not always, as ſhewn before. I have known, when they have been taken in time, that a proper Vomit and a Volatile Specifick hath rouſed up Nature's Force, that the Patient hath recovered, and found his Spirits more Vigete, Lively, and his Memory quicker than at any time before, and that by taking my Emetick Pouder preſcrib'd in Chapter Firſt, and my Vertiginous Spirit in Chapter the Third, and that in the Particular Caſe following.</p>
               <p>A Gentleman of a Brisk and Airy Temper, quick Wit and Ingenuity, and of an Excellent Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Judgment and Memory, fell firſt into For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs and Loſs of Memory, and after into a Dotage upon ſome Trouble of Mind, inſomuch, that he would talk very fooliſhly, ask the ſame Queſtion over and over, and would ſometimes, without any Cauſe, fall a Laughing, at other times Crying, juſt like a Child, which ſhew'd that his Intellectuals were really much deprav'd, inſomuch that I greatly queſtioned whether I could do him any Service; however, upon his Friends earneſt deſire I would try, I ſent him Three Papers of my Emetick Pouder, and a Bottle of my Vertiginous Spirit, with Directions for his taking One of the Papers every other Morning, and Fifty Drops of the Spirit every Morning beſides, and alſo every

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0510901800:24"/>for the other Intentions, both preſcribed in Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Firſt, they doing all, as it were, at once, I mean without any other Medicine, if the Pouder be repeated Twice or Thrice in a Week, in a Morning, and the Elixir taken as therein directed. But where there is a perfect Madneſs and Diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, other Methods muſt be taken, as Cupping with Scarifications, large Bleedings, Glyſters, Bliſters, Hypnoticks, frequent Purging and Vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, to do which two laſt, nothing, I ſay, can be more prevalent than my Cephalick Pills and Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Pouder, given alternately as often as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient's ſtrength can bear them.</p>
               <p>I know there are many who pretend to Cure Madneſs by ſome particular Methods, others by ſuch and ſuch a peculiar Specifick, but with what Succeſs they know beſt. One came to me once in behalf of a Friend of her's, a Man that had been diſtracted for many Years, and had been in Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, and other Places for Cure, but to no Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. I told the Meſſenger the beſt Medicines I knew for Cure, were my Emetick Pouder and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalick purging Pills, ſome of both which I gave her, with Directions to give him One Paper of the Emetick Pouder one Day, and reſting the next Day, to give Four of the purging Pills the Day following, and ſo every other Day the Pouder or Pills, which was done, and the patient was much better; but coming for more, the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger told me they were adviſed to give him the following Drink, as one of the moſt certain Specificks for Madneſs m the World. I anſwer'd I could not tell what Extraordinary Vertues were in it, but they might give it notwithſtanding his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king my Pouder and Pills, which they did, and the

However, that the Publick may be the better for knowing it, if there be any thing of what is ſaid in it, I here give the Preſcription juſt as they related it to me.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of the Lethargy, Caras, or Sleepy Diſeaſes.</head>
               <p>THE Lethargy is a Diſeaſe known by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients being continually ſluggiſh, and ſleepy, ſcarcely anſwering if often ſpoke to, only opening their Eyes and ſhutting them again, without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the leaſt notice of any thing that was ſaid to them; and ſo inclin'd to ſleep are they, that if you ſhake them and rouſe them ever ſo much, they will hardly wake, or at leaſtwiſe long, but deſire to ſleep, and are never ſatisfy'd without it, or indeed with it; ſo that the Animal Spirits are, as it were, bound and lock'd up by extraordinary Obſtructions, there being attending a gentle Fever, an high Pulſe, and Breath weak; the Cauſe is from too much Flegm, cooling the Brain in its Windings and hindmoſt Cells, which occaſions the profound Sleep, and the putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Humour being extreamly ſharp and fretting occaſions the Fever, which is in a manner perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual; and the ſlowneſs of Breath is cauſed from the Affection of the Nerves of the <hi>Thorax</hi> or Breaſt.</p>
               <p>The Lethargy differs from the <hi>Carus,</hi> becauſe in a <hi>Carus</hi> there is no Fever. It differs from a <hi>Catelepſis,</hi> becauſe in that the Eyes, when the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſleeps are open, and in the Lethargy ſhut.</p>
               <p>All ſleepy Diſeaſes, if of long continuance, and thoſe happen in Fat, Groſs, and Old People, are generally incurable, and by how much deeper the Sleep is, or the Patient the harder to wake, by ſo much the more is the Diſeaſe dangerous, and that eſpecially if it happens after the going off of an Acute Diſeaſe; and if the ſleepy Diſeaſe be exquiſite, and the Strength decays and waſtes, it is certainly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be cured. But if it happens to one that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0510901800:27"/>is Young, and in the Heat of Summer, and the Animal Functions be not much impair'd, and all the Natural Evacuations be perfect, there may be a Cure; to accompliſh which, Evacuations by Bleeding, Bliſtering and Purging, muſt be made, the latter not by any thing better than my Cepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Pills preſcrib'd in Chapter the firſt; and then for a Specifick to repercuſs the Humour that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends, and ſtrengthen the Brain, I cannot adviſe a more prevalent Preparation than my Volatile Eſſence following; which diſcharges the Animal Spirits of their Burthen, and quickens them to an immenſe Degree. The Method to be obſerved is this: Firſt let the Patient Bleed in the Arm Twelve Ounces, or according as he is in Age and Strength. After that apply a ſtrong large Bliſter to his Neck, or rather between his Shoulders; then the next Night, or next Morning, which he pleaſes, let him take Four of the Cephalick Pills, which will gently purge him, and every Night and every Morning, (excepting the Nights and Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings he takes the Pills) as alſo about Four in the Afternoon, let him take Sixty Drops of my Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Eſſence in a Diſh of Tea, or which is more effectual, in a Diſh of the Infuſion of Roſemary, Lavender, Carraway Seeds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> directed in Chapter the Third, which if followed ſtrictly and the Patient's Noſtrils and Temples be rubb'd ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times a Day with a little of the Volatile Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and a few Drops of it ſnuff'd up his Noſe now and then, will undoubtedly, by the Bleſſing of God, bring him to himſelf, if he be curable, and prevent the Diſtemper for the future, if the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines be but for a time continued.</p>

               <p>THE Coma is a great Deſire and Inclination to Sleep, but with an utter inability to do it, ariſing from Narcotick Vapours which infeſt the Brain and induce the drowſy or ſleepy Indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, yet at the ſame time ſo trouble and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet the Mind, that they cannot ſleep at all, but wink with their Eyes and often open them, having a doting kind of Diſcourſe, attended with an inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Motion of the Hands and Thighs.</p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0510901800:29"/>
               <p>It is cauſed ſometimes by a great weakneſs of the Faculties of the Body, either from ſome grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Diſeaſe and violent Pains, or from immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Evacuations, which have diſſipated the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits. Unnatural Watchings, are when the common external ſenſe is wearied beyond due or juſt meaſure, ariſing from the continual uninterrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Influx of the Spirits into the Organs, as we find when we have over tired our ſelves by much Walking, Running or Riding, we cannot ſleep, tho' we greatly want and deſire it, but tumble, and toſs and ſtretch.</p>
               <p>Unnatural Watchings are alſo occaſioned by too much Light, Noiſe, Cares of the Mind, being too thoughtful or intent upon Matters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which hinder Sleep, alſo Pains, Coughs, Fluxes, a hot Diſtemper of the Brain, hot, ſharp, and ſalt Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, which twitch and diſturb the Spirits and <hi>Meninges</hi> of the Brain, making People uneaſy and reſtleſs; or from difect of ſuch natural Vapours, as procure Reſt to the Animal Spirits, which long Abſtinence from Food will cauſe, as alſo Eating too much, eſpecially Suppers.</p>
               <p>When Watchings proceed from a Diſeaſe, and become a Coma of long ſtanding, the Cure is very doubtful, eſpecially if they have their Speech hindred, or when they breathe, a murmuring Noiſe be heard in the Throat, or a thin Humour diſtils out of the Noſtrils, or the Patient not able to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low without difficulty, for in thoſe Caſes it is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, or at leaſt they degenerate into a Lethargy or Frenzy,</p>
               <p>The Cure of a Coma or unnatural Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as they proceed from an Humour or internal Cauſe, that interrupts the Quietude of the Spirits,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0510901800:30"/>is beſt accompliſh'd, eſpecially in the Coma, by my Cephalick purging Pills and Cephalick Elixir, preſcribed in Chapter the Firſt; and which if ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as therein directed, will carry off thoſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending Humours, that the Patient will have his Natural Reſt, without taking Opiates and other Narcotick Medicines, which, as they only palliate the Diſtemper, and give eaſe but for a while, do in the end rather injure than relieve.</p>

               <p>THE Apoplexy is a Diſeaſe of the Brain, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly depriving the whole Body of Senſe and Motion. <hi>Riolanus</hi> defines it to be an Abolition of Senſe and Motion, with Reſpiration hurt, which at laſt brings Snorting and Suffocation, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of thick Flegm flowing out of the Funnel, and obſtructing the <hi>Larynx</hi> or Wind-pipe, which alſo oftentimes and unexpectedly invades all the Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Brain, but eſpecially the Fourth Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, wherein, unleſs the Matter be diſcuſſed in the Spinal Marrow, Death unavoidably follows. <hi>Ferne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> ſays, that an Apoplexy is a Diſeaſe bred by an Obſtruction of the <hi>Rete Mirabile,</hi> the Afflux of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial blood out of the Heart into the Brain, being thereby intercepted. <hi>Willis</hi> ſays the Senſe of the Word Apoplexy denotes Percuſſion, and by reaſon of the ſtupendious Quality of the Diſtemper, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining, as it were ſomething ſupernatural, it is call'd Sideration or Blaſting; for thoſe ſtruck there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, are, as it were, Planet ſtruck, or ſtruck with an inviſible Power, falling ſuddenly to the Ground, and being depriv'd both of Senſe and Motion; and the whole Animal Function ceaſing,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0510901800:31"/>(ſave that they breathe) they lye for a long ſeaſon as if Dead, and ſometimes, yea too often, are dead indeed, (many of which I hope to ſhew might have been, and how others may be preſerv'd) but if they revive, they are many times taken with an Univerſal Palſy, or elſe with the Palſy of one Side. <hi>Riverius</hi> ſays it is a moſt deep Sleep, and a total Privation of Senſe and Motion, Breathing excepted, wherein the Patient neither opens his Eyes, anſwers, or feels, when he is ſpoken to, or hurt, breathing alſo with difficulty.</p>
               <p>The Apoplexy is either accidental, coming of a ſudden, and falling indifferently upon any Man, tho' not at all pre-diſpos'd thereto, for which by the way, no Preventative Method can be inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; or it is habitual, from a conſtant Diſpoſition in ſome People, becauſe of which they are at firſt only exerciſed with light approaches thereof, or rather Symptoms; afterwards the Paroxyſms are evident, but gentle; but at length they become more obvious and grievous, and of which at laſt they for the moſt part dye.</p>
               <p>The Apoplexy is diſtinguiſh'd according to its Degrees, into Gentle, Strong and Strongeſt: The Gentle, is that wherein the Patient breathes free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and eaſily becomes ſenſible again. The Strong. Apoplexy is that wherein the Patient breathes with very great Difficulty, and, as it were, with Violence, Snorting and Foaming at the Mouth. The Strongeſt and moſt Dangerous, is that in which all Senſe and Motion immediately ceaſe throughout the whole Body, the Breath alſo being ſtop'd. In this there is neither Snorting nor Foaming, but the Patients lye as if perfectly Dead; but if they do not quickly recover, they ought not to be buried
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0510901800:32"/>before Three Days be over, it having been known that ſome ſo ſeized have in that ſpace of Time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viv'd again.</p>
               <p>The Signs of an Apoplexy are Swoonings, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times falling Suddenly and ſometimes by Degrees, Senſe, Motion, and Voice, being many times ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, ſometimes only diminiſh'd, Reſpiration alone, and that with much difficulty, remaining. Some Perſons Sleep deeply, and, as it were, Snort or Snore; the looſen'd Limbs being lift up, fall down with their own weight, in the manner of dead Perſons, and their Eyes are either wide open or quite ſhut, the Pulſe at the ſame time being ſtrong and full, which has deceived many in the Prognoſticks of this Diſeaſe; in many there is a Relaxation of the Sphincter Muſcles of the <hi>Anus</hi> and Bladder, ſo that the Excrements and Urine come away invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily and inſenſibly.</p>
               <p>An Apoplexy very ſeldom gives any Warning of its approach, unleſs in Perſons ſubject to Lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies or Vertigoes, which in many are Fore-runners of this Diſeaſe, as alſo, in ſome, are Dimneſs of Sight, Trembling of the whole Body, Incubus or Night-mare often afflicting, gnaſhing of the Teeth in ſleep, and an unuſal Heavineſs of the Body. It has likewiſe by many been obſerved, that ſmoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much Tobacco, has cauſed in ſome Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the Apoplexy, and they give Inſtances of ſuch being ſeized while they have been ſmoaking, and dyed; and this they aſcribe to its Narcotick Quality, and ſay by that means it is Injurious to the Brain, and conſequently diſpoſes to Apoplexies: But I am of another Opinion as to the thing in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; for if Tobacco had ſuch a pernicious Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the many Years it has been in Vogue, and the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0510901800:33"/>Multitudes of People of all ſorts that have taken it, would have diſcovered it in an eminent Degree, and have oblig'd the World to leave ſmoaking it long ago as deleterious. But on the contrary, very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny People live to a great Age, and in as good a State of Health, tho' they have long and immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately uſed it, as thoſe that take it not. It muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be allowed that it is not agreeable to all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, but the ſame may be ſaid of almoſt every thing elſe, whether Food or Phyſick; and tho' we have had Inſtances of ſome dying of Apoplexies that have taken Tobacco, yet it does not follow, that Tobacco was the Cauſe. And I preſume no wiſe Man will conclude from a few Inſtances of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeableneſs of any one thing to ſome Men, when vaſt Numbers of them on the contrary ſide may be brought to warrant its Uſe, that it ought univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally to be avoided, or branded with a note of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy. My Senſe of Tobacco is, That in thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons with whom it is found to agree, 'tis a very good Drainer of Humours, and ſo may ſupply the place of Iſſues, or at leaſt that fewer of them may be neceſſary to thoſe who abound with Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture; for by its irritating, and occaſionally enlarging (from the great Afflux of the <hi>Saliva</hi>) the Secretory Ducts of the Glandules about the Mouth, as 'tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident there muſt be a great Diſcharge, ſo a great Diverſion is made from the Brain (tho' I allow the greateſt part of the Matter comes not immediately from thence, but out of the Blood) whence 'tis ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeable that the Perſons who take it, ſhould drink but moderately, leaſt otherwiſe they do themſelves more Hurt by the Supply, than they can receive Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by the Diſcharge. But there is another reaſon why Tobacco may be uſeful to thoſe who are diſpos'd or ſubject to Apoplexies, I mean to thoſe to whom
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0510901800:34"/>it is agreeable) and that is by the Vellication the Smoke of it impreſſes on the Nerves of the Mouth, which it makes to contract, ſo that by conſent of Parts the whole Brain is analogouſly affected, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by if the Brain happens to be more lax than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, and is dispos'd to receive a Flux of Blood or Serum, as it will be after a Perſon has had and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped one Fit, it will prove a very uſeful Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration towards reſtoring the Tone of it, and thereby preventing the Admiſſion of Heterogenous Particles into the Tubes of the Nerves, which cauſe the Symptoms.</p>
               <p>And ſince I have ſpoken about Tobacco, I will add a Word or Two concerning Snuff, which, as it cauſes not, through its frequent Uſe, any Sternu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or ſneezing, to thoſe who take it conſtantly, is very prejudicial; and where immoderately taken, by ſome Perſons of ſome Conſtitutions, ſo relaxes the Tone of the Brain, as to diſpoſe to Apoplexies, and that becauſe the Matter of it is groſs, and apt to lye long about the Extremities of the Olfactory Nerves, ſo as continually to affect them, eſpecially where they are ever and anon ſupply'd with more, which keeps the Pores of thoſe Nerves continually open. It is the Opinion of a very great Phyſician, That Snuff, as now a days uſed, renders thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that take it, liable not only to Apoplexies, but alſo to the Danger of receiving the Peſtilence, if any ſuch Diſtemper ſhould reign, (which God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid) and that much ſooner than others, ſince from the Symptoms, the Peſtilence appears to ſeize the Brain particularly; and the ſudden Fate upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of thoſe that without any preceding Indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fition have, whilſt the laſt Sickneſs raged, fallen down in the Streets, was doubtleſs from the Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential Miaſms, being eaſily and at once admitted
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0510901800:35"/>into the Brain by the Olfactory or Smelling Nerves, render'd more open and lax by the profuſe taking of Snuff in thoſe Days; thoſe People that uſed it moſt, being the ſooneſt and in the moſt fatal manner, ſeized with that Diſeaſe. It may here be urged, that many, who then uſed it, received no apparent Injury, or do thoſe that take it now a-days find any harm by it: Be it ſo, I think the Objection may as well be urged in favour of immoderate Drinking, many who long indulg'd themſelves in that practice, having yet liv'd to a great Age, when however it is evident that many more have much ſhortened their Lives by it. But tho' Peſtilencies, (from which Thanks be to God we are at preſent free) or Apoplexies may not be occaſion'd by the profuſe taking of Snuff, yet the Vertigo and other Diſtempers which we find debilitate or hurt the Brain, may reaſonably be ſuppos'd from that pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice principally to ariſe.</p>
               <p>The Cauſes of the Apoplexy we have accounted for, and alſo the Signs: I ſhall now ſpeak of its Seat, and then of its Prevention and Cure. The Seat of an Apoplexy is without doubt in the more inward receſs of the Brain, to wit, the <hi>Corpus Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſum,</hi> and the proximate and immediate Subject of the Diſeaſe, is the Animal Spirits inhabiting therein, for that the Underſtanding, Imagination and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe are ſo deeply affected as to be perfectly darken'd, and to ſuffer a total eclipſe; but the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Subject of this Diſaffection is thought to be the middle part of the Brain; becauſe from, thence the Inſtincts of all Spontaneous Motions proceed, and in this the Perception of all ſenſible things are terminated.</p>
               <p>From Hiſtories and Anatomical Obſervations of Perſons dying of an Apoplexy, Blood has been
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0510901800:36"/>found extravaſated, or out of its proper Veſſels, here and there hi great Clots, compreſſing the Subſtance of the Brain. In others the <hi>Serous Colluvies</hi> have overflow'd the whole Head. In others a large Bladder of Water has been found in one of the Ventricles, compreſſing the ſmaller Paſſages; from which Obſervations it may be concluded, that the principal places ſorely affected are not the greater Ventricles, but the middle marrowy Subſtance of the Brain and Cerebel, which is every where Porus and endued with very many minute Paſſages, that both the Vital Spirits may flow in thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Blood, and the Animal Spirits may flow forth.</p>
               <p>The Cure of the Apoplexy is twofold, in the Fit, or out of the Fit; the Cure out of the Fit, is properly ſpeaking preventative, of which I ſhall treat after I have ſhewn what is to be done in the Fit.</p>
               <p>The Patient being in a Fit, whether it proceeds from the Blood let out of the Veſſels, or a Serous or watery Humour, or the breaking of an Impoſthume in the Brain, or other inviſible Cauſe, the Cure muſt not be the leſs neglected; therefore immediately ſet the Patient as upright as may be, for ſome Hours, (for the Diſeaſe being a ſleepy one, if the Patient ſhould be put to Bed it might incline more to ſleep, which is expreſly againſt the Intention of Cure) and let him Blood plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully, for nothing is more capable of ſooner relieving, and this Diſtemper of all others, requires the moſt ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Remedy, for the Diſention both of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiferous Veſſels, and Habit of the Parts, being thro' Bleeding remov'd, the Fibres which conſtitute both, muſt be preſumed to contract themſelves by their Tonick Motion, but eſpecially thoſe in the Habit. Afterwards, or while this is doing, ſome proper Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutatory muſt be blown up the Noſtrils with a Quil, the beſt of which I ever knew inſtantly to bring the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0510901800:37"/>Patient to himſelf being my following Apoplectick Species, the Virtues of which in one particular Caſe I will here give you.</p>
               <p>A Gentleman being ſeized with an Apoplectick Fit, ſeveral Phyſicians and Surgeons were call'd by the By-ſtanders, they all immediately endeavoured to let him Blood, but he would not Bleed, at length ſome one by, who knew I had Medicines for Fits and Diſtempers of the Head, came for me, and told me the Man was dead; if ſo, I ſaid, I could not ſetch him to Life; but, it being the common ſaying when there is danger, that the Patient is either dead or; dying, in hopes the Meſſenger might be miſtaken, away I went, taking with me a little of my Apople<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick Species. When I got thither I beheld the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Object as one dead indeed, he lying ſo very ſtupified, as that no Life could be perceived to be in him, and as a dead Man I look'd upon him. Bleed I found he would not, nor could any thing be got down his Throat, therefore I inſtantly blew a little of my Species forcibly up his Noſtrils, by which means he a little while after began to ſtir, I then blew up a little more, upon which a large Evacuation of Pus, Water, and Viſcous Matter mix'd with Blood, was immediately made, whereupon he a little revived, and being almoſt come to himſelf, a very great Flux of Blood (near upon a Quart) preſently followed thro' his Noſtrils, ſo that in about an Hours time or a little more, after the uſe of the Species, he perfectly recovered from his Fit, his Underſtanding, Speech and Senſes being all reſtor'd. This Danger being over, the next thing to be conſidered for him was how to prevent any more Fits for the future; therefore I order'd him my Cephalick Pills and Cephalick Elixir preſcrib'd in Chapter the Firſt, to be taken as there directed, which had the deſir'd effect.</p>

               <p>As the Recovering a Patient out of a Fit of the Apoplexy, when there is ſo much Danger, and Life is ſo imminently threaten'd, is a very happy thing, ſo to prevent the Fits for the future, or ſecure thoſe from them, that have the Symptoms of them, is not a much leſs good Service; for we have ſeen and known many that have had one Fit after another, and each Fit more dangerous, till at length Life hath been carried away indeed, therefore tho' it be difficult to prevent the Fits, yet I perſuade my ſelf, if the Patient follow the Rules I ſhall lay down, he will not only be ſecured from more, while he is taking the Medicines, but will find the very Cauſe of the Diſeaſe taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſo effectually, that upon his deſiſting to take them he will hear no more of his Malady.</p>
               <p>Therefore let ſuch that are ſubject to the Apoplexy, or in fear of that Diſeaſe, take Three of my Gepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Pills every fourth or fifth Morning, which will gently purge him, calling away Humours from the Blood which infeſt the Brain; and thoſe Mornings he does not take the Pills, he is to take Ffty Drops of my Cephalick Elixir in a Glaſs of fair Water, or mix'd with a little Wine, if the Water be too raw for his Stomach; as alſo the ſame Doſe every Night going to Bed; which Elixir is a Specifick Midicine, corroborating the Head, Brain and Spirits, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Blood in due order.

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of the Palſy and other Nervous Diſeaſes.</head>
               <p>THE Palſy is a Reſolution or Relaxation of the Nerves from their due Habit, by which means Motion and Senſe, ſometimes one only, ſometimes both together, in the whole Body, or in ſome Part or Parts thereof, cannot be uſed or exerciſed after their due manner.</p>
               <p>It is a Diſeaſe either perfect, in which Senſe and Motion are quite loſt and gone, or imperfect, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Senſe or Motion are only decay'd or diminiſh'd, ſo as to occaſion a Trembling or Shaking of the Parts affected, and in this latter, if the Diminution be but ſmall, it cannot be properly call'd a Palſy, but a <hi>Stupor</hi> or a Numbneſs, which however is commonly the Fore-runner of a true Palſy.</p>
               <p>A Palſy may be either from the hurt of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Faculty, the Senſe remaining ſound, or from the hurt of the Senſitive, the Motive remaining well. The Cauſe may be either from a Solution of Unity in the Nerves, as by a Bruiſe from a Fall or Blow, or by a Wound, or from a Relaxation of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Back, ſuddenly cauſed, or it may come from innate Cauſes, or cold pituitous Humours, which relax and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0510901800:41"/>diſſolve the Tone of the Nerves, or from ſtraitneſs or narrowneſs of the Nerves cauſed by Obſtructions, or by Conſtipation from ſome Tumour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or from thin, ſharp, ſerous and windy Humours moved in the Bowels, not only to the beginning of the Orifices of the Nerves, but to the very Muſcles and Tendons; or it may proceed from Cauſes external and foreign, as from Narcoticks, or Poiſons, immeaſurably drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrong Liquors, the taking of Henbane, Opium, Quickſilver, Antimony, Arſnick, or the like. To the external Cauſes may alſo be added the exceſs of Heat or Cold; by the firſt of which the Spirits are waſted and ſpent, and by the latter they are obſtructed in their Paſſages by Congelation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or it comes by Conſent of Parts, and that for the moſt Part in Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butick Habits of Body, but the general Cauſes of a Palſy, are all thoſe which hinder the Paſſages of the Animal Spirits into the Nerves and Muſcles, and in whatever part they are interrupted from flowing, there will be a Palſy in that Part, it being impoſſible for the Nerves to act or perform their Function as they ought, without being ſufficiently fill'd and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigorated by the Spirits.</p>
               <p>In whatever place, I ſay, this Hindrance happens, whether about the Spinal Marrow, or about the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugations or Branches of the Nerves proceeding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, it cauſes a Palſy either of more or fewer Parts, according as the Nerves affected are more general or particular.</p>
               <p>If the Nerves that take their riſe near the Brain, or in the beginning of their Paſſage from the Brain, or the ſpinal Marrow lying juſt under the Brain, be hurt or affected, there is commonly a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Palſy, wherein alſo Breathing, the Voice, Speech, and Swallowing with ſome excreſſive Motions do ſuffer hurt. But if the Hurt is in the following Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0510901800:42"/>of this Marrow, it makes thoſe Members only paralytick, into which its Branches or Nerves are inſerted: But the Palſy is ſo much the more general by how much the effect of the ſaid ſpinal Marrow is near to the Brain, or Original of the Nerves.</p>
               <p>If the Eye be affected with the Palſy, the viſive Nerves are originally hurt, as alſo the <hi>Cerebrum</hi> it ſelf. If the Tongue is Paralytick, the Conjugation of Nerves ſerving the Tongue is hurt, and the Speech is alſo defective, and by reaſon of its Community with the Auditory Nerve, if the defect be ſo great as to cauſe a Total loſs of Speech, the Patient is for the moſt part Deaf alſo. If there be a Palſy of the Larynx, Jaws, Midriff, as alſo of the Bladder and Fundament, the Nerves of the ſixth and ſeventh Conjugations, are hurt about their Original. If there be a defect of the Voice, the Recurrent Nerve is affected. If there be a defect in Swallowing, the Nerves that go to the Muſcles of the Jaws are hurt; if there be danger of Suffocation, the Nerves that go to the Midriff are hurt, tho' the Midriff (the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Breathing) can otherwiſe, in ſome ſort, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form its Office, for that it receives Nerves alſo from the Spinal Marrow.</p>
               <p>If the Sphincter Muſcles of the Bladder and Anus be paralytick, there follows an involuntary voiding of Urine and the Excrements, the Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of Nerves ſupplying thoſe Parts, being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally affected or hurt.</p>
               <p>If the Palſy is in the Legs, the Nerves affected are about the bottom of the Spinal Marrow, and the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the <hi>Os Sacrum.</hi> And thus we muſt ſearch out for the place whence the Nerves ſpring, which are diſperſed to thoſe Parts affected with the Palſy, and that being known, the Cure is the eaſier accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed. From theſe things it is apparent what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugation
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0510901800:43"/>of Nerves are moſt affected, when the Palſy is in this or that Part only; but when there is an univerſal Palſy, there is, for the moſt part, an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the whole <hi>Genus Nervoſum</hi> or Nervous Syſtem, which comes to paſs from one or more of the Cauſes already mentioned.</p>
               <p>The Signs of the Palſy are manifeſt, to wit, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation of Senſe and Motion of the Parts; the Eye, if that be affected, is weakned and depraved on that ſide where the Part is affected for want of Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the Speech is much alter'd; the Urine is moſt times white and thin by means of Obſtructions. If it comes from a Blow, Fall, Wound, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or upon an Apoplexy, Lethargy, Carus, or other Effects of the Brain or <hi>Genus Nervoſum,</hi> it will not quickly be cured; no more will the Palſy in young People pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from a cold and moiſt matter, becauſe of the diſſimilitude of the Diſeaſe to the Nature of ſuch Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients. The Palſy in old People is never perfectly cured, becauſe they want Natural Heat; and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate Palſy is moſt commonly incurable.</p>
               <p>The Cure of the Palſy therefore is uncertain, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as is the Cauſe and Strength of the Diſeaſe, and Conſtitution of the Patient; nor is it in any cured but by firſt and chiefly altering the whole habit of the Body, rectifying the diſcracy of the Blood, and removing the Morbifick Matter offending, and that at laſt by ſtrengthening the Parts hurt, that they may for the future be able to reſiſt all other Aſſaults of the Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>To do this, Medicines muſt be both inwardly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and outwardly apply'd. Authors have not been ſparing in their Preſcriptions for that purpoſe, there being numbers of them to be met with; but it is to be doubted many of them would be found to be of very little, if any, effect; I have known many of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0510901800:44"/>the (reputed) celebrated ones made uſe of, but the Benefit was not equivalent to the Trouble, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed can I ſay any one of the many I have met with, have come near anſwering their Characters, tho' I my ſelf have uſed them with the ſtricteſt Care and Obſervation, which put me upon conſidering how to find out thoſe that might be effectual, and which I have accompliſh'd ſo far, as to cure in many Caſes of that kind, I might ſay moſt; and even in invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Palſies, by a conſtant Application of thoſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, I know not what effects may be produced, it may be more than I am willing to ſay, or the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient expect.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> Of the Epilepſy or Falling-Sickneſs, alſo Convulſions and Cramp.</head>
               <p>THE Epilepſy or Falling-Sickneſs, is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive Motion of the whole Body, coming by Fits, depriving the Sick ſuddenly both of Reaſon and Senſe, wherein the whole Body is contracted. <hi>Galen</hi> calls the Falling-Sickneſs always a Convulſion, but improperly, for it is not a true Convulſion, but a Convulſive Motion of the whole Body, wherein all the External and Internal Senſes are aboliſh'd.</p>
               <p>It is call'd the Falling-Sickneſs, becauſe many times the Perſons afflicted, fall down when their Fits come upon them; it is alſo call'd <hi>Morbus Sacer,</hi> either becauſe it doth contaminate, as it were, the Sacred Soul or Life, or becauſe it is ſeated in the Head, the Sacred Temple of the Soul, as Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers ſay, or elſe call'd ſo from the Greatneſs of the Diſeaſe, or rather becauſe it is a Diſeaſe not often cured (if it be inveterate) by Humane Help, but by Divine Aid. It is alſo by Authors call'd <hi>Morbus Herculeus,</hi> and that either becauſe <hi>Hercules,</hi> as the Poets feign, was taken with this Diſtemper, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is hard, like his Labours, and difficult to cure. Others call it <hi>Morbus Puerilis,</hi> becauſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren when they begin to have Teeth, are often ſeized with this Diſeaſe, alſo <hi>Morbus Comitialis,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it takes Men on a ſudden when they are in
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0510901800:48"/>Company; alſo <hi>Morbus Lunaticus,</hi> becauſe People are generally ſeized with it, at certain times of the Moon, as the New and Full; likewiſe <hi>Morbus Sonticus,</hi> becauſe it is a Diſtemper that much afflicts and hurts the Perſon who has it.</p>
               <p>When the Fit comes, the Patient falls down, is plucked up together, trembles, turns about, ſnorts, crys out, and foams at the Mouth, and makes a kind of roaring or howling Noiſe, claſhing or gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and cloſing his Teeth, faſt ſhutting and holding together his Fingers, voiding his Urine and Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments inſenſibly, and foaming at Mouth froth, like the White of an Egg work'd with a Wisk.</p>
               <p>It is cauſed of groſs Flegm, or ſharp Choler, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing the Paſſage of the Spirits in the Ventricles of the Brain, which within pulls or twinges the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Nerves, and thereby cauſes a ſtraitning of the Paſſage, by which there follows a drawing back and ſhutting up of the Animal Spirits which cauſe Senſe; from defect of which there follows immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately all the Symptoms of this Diſeaſe, and by which the Parts ſuffer a Convulſive Motion.</p>
               <p>Tho' what has been ſaid to be the Cauſe, yet there are many afflicted with this Diſeaſe Heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, from the ſame Diſeaſy Principle in their Parents, ſo that they bring it into the World with them; but upon general Obſervation it is a Diſeaſe chiefly oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by ſome Poſterous Accident.</p>
               <p>There are differences of this Diſeaſe according to its Cauſe, and the Conſtitution it ſeizes on. One is recent, or but newly begun, the other inveterate and of long ſtanding. There is alſo another more mild, in which ſome certain Parts ſuffer only a Convulſion; or elſe more grievous, wherein there is a Convulſion of the whole Body. Another is periodical, coming once or twice a Year or once or twice a Month, at New
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0510901800:49"/>or full Moon, or oftner, but always keeping its certain times, tho' others again I have known to be ſurpriz'd with the Fits unawares.</p>
               <p>It is a Diſeaſe to ſome, from an Epileptick Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in the Brain, to others from a preceding Cauſe in the inferior Parts, to others from Diſtempers of the Stomach, to others from Worms, to others from the Womb, and to others from hurts of the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Parts; it never ſeizes ſome till they are grown up in Years, and others never but in their Infancy; but tho' it moſt commonly happens to Children, yet it ſometimes afflicts grown Perſons, and it is remark'd by <hi>Galen</hi> to be a Diſeaſe incurable if it takes them after the Age of Twenty five Years.</p>
               <p>The Cure of this Diſeaſe is twofold, when the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe is upon them, and when the Fit is over.</p>
               <p>When the Fit is upon them, Authors adviſe to give a few Drops of Spirit of Hartshorn, Caſtor, or the like, in a Glaſs of fair Water, and to ſmell to the ſame, rubbing the Noſtrils a little with it, or with Oil of Amber. And when the Fit is over, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it for the future, they order Bliſters, Gliſters, Purges, Vomits, Cuppings, and the like, and give Specificks inwardly, which they preſcribe, but they are ſo numerous that it is inconſiſtent with the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity I deſign in this Treatiſe, to note them, as 'tis judg'd they would, many of them at leaſt, be as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant if I did.</p>
               <p>I have attended many Patients in my time both in and out of the Fits, and tho' I have uſed many things recommended, I could not find any thing come near my Epileptick Spirit following, both to recover Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients when in Fits, and to rectify the Indiſpoſition of the Parts in order to prevent them for the future. But the Method I uſe when I ſee any one in a Fit, is this, I immediately blow a little of my Apoplectick
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0510901800:50"/>Species, preſcrib'd in Chapter the 8th, up each Noſtril, and give inwardly a few Drops of the Epileptick Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as Thirty to a grown Perſon, and Five or Six to Children, in a Glaſs of fair Water, rubbing the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils, Temples, top of the Head and Nape of the Neck with a little of the Spirit alſo, which almoſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, as ſoon as the Species begin to operate, brings the Patient out of the Fit. After that is done, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Fits for the future, I firſt purge the Patient with my Cephalick Pills preſcrib'd in the 1ſt Chapter, giving them, as there directed, according to Age or Strength, every third or fourth Day; and in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate days, I give Thirty, Forty or Fifty Drops of my Epileptick Spirit, every Night and Morning in a Glaſs of fair Water, which is the beſt Vehicle; and order the top of the Head, Nape of the Neck, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Back-bone, to be rubb'd with my <hi>Nerve Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> preſcrib'd in the 9th Chapter, every Night and Morning, which wonderfully corrects and alters the Humours of the Body, and ſtrengthens the whole Man, eſpecially if the courſe be continued for ſome time after the time the Fits uſually return, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſcarce One Patient in Twenty, where the Diſeaſe is not Hereditary, will by this Method ever fail of being cured.</p>

               <p>The like good Service will theſe Medicines I have now mentioned do in Convulſions, which is a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe from a forced Contraction of the Nerves and Muſcles towards their Original, which is the Brain and Spinal Marrow, wherein the voluntary Motion of the Joints is hurt, the natural form and ſituation is deprav'd or changed, and the Parts affected are annoyed with a moſt ſharp Pain.</p>
               <p>There are Four kinds of Convulſions, one when the whole Body is bended or drawn forward, another when the whole Body is convulſed and drawn back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, another when the Convulſion is equally both ways, ſo that the whole Body is ſtiff like a Stake, that it cannot be moved any way, and the other is when it happens to a particular Part, as the Hands, Arms, Legs, Thighs, Hips, and ſometimes remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble when it happens to the Bowels, Stomach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When it happens to the Hands, Arms, Legs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is what is call'd the Cramp.</p>
               <p>The Brain is oftentimes affected in this Diſeaſe, and ſometimes the Marrow of the Back or <hi>Spina Medullae,</hi> as alſo the Nerves and Muſcles as ſaid before.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0510901800:52"/>The Signs are manifeſt, and the Cauſes many, as from Wounds, loſs of much Blood, cold Humours, Flegm, the taking of Hellebore, Drunkenneſs, Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting, pricking a Nerve or Tendon, Worms, biting of venemous Beaſts, or the like. But be the Cauſe from what it will, I could never find the Cure bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or ſooner accompliſh'd than by the Method and Medicines a little before mentioned and preſcribed, which if followed as directed for the Falling-Sickneſs, anſwers the Intention ſo much, as I may preſume to ſay nothing can do more. And one thing I can't but note before I leave this Chapter, which is, that for the Cramp of the Legs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which many People are often troubled with, there is not a better Medicine upon Earth to bathe with, than my <hi>Nerve Fotus,</hi> mentioned in the 9th Chapter, as they that uſe it will ſay.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Of the Incubus or Night-Mare.</head>
               <p>THE Night-mare, or, as ſome call it, the Hag, is a Nocturnal Diſeaſe ariſing from thick Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours which chiefly obſtruct the hinder part of the Brain, by which the Flux of Animal Spirits being ſtop'd, Breathing is hindred, the Voice intercepted, and the Body ſo oppreſs'd (as it were between ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and waking) with a weight lying upon the Breaſt and holding faſt the Man, that, notwithſtanding all his Endeavours, the whole Faculty of moving ſeems for a ſeaſon to be aboliſhed.</p>
               <p>I ſay, in the time of the Fit, the Patient endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and ſtrives with vehemency to ſtir, move, and ſhake off his Burden, but in vain; for when the Fit is off, and he comes to himſelf, he find's he is not moved an Hair's breadth, but lyes in the ſame Place and Poſture, tho' he thought he ſtruggled ſtrongly with what oppreſs'd him, and that he cry'd out, when indeed
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0510901800:53"/>he never ſpoke one Word; but becauſe of the great Oppreſſion about the Heart and Midriff, and fear of Suffocation, he commonly groans, and thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes the Weight of his Affliction with Fear and Terror. And tho' this Diſeaſe ſo ſtrongly ſeizes the univerſal Man in the Fit, as to aboliſh all manner of external Motion, yet it hurts the Underſtanding and internal Senſes but little, nor indeed the common Senſe of Feeling, becauſe if any one, being by, does but touch or pull the Patient, tho he be in the heighth of the Fit, he will immediately come to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and perfectly remember and tell all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the Affliction.</p>
               <p>As from the great oppreſſion the Patient groans, ſo alſo are the inward Senſes of many ſo diſturb'd, as that they believe it was a Spirit that held them, or that they were hag-ridden (whence comes the Name) or that ſome Witch or Devil, ſometimes in one Shape, ſometimes in another, as of a Dog, a Cat, Bear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> lyes upon and oppreſſes them, and will poſſitively tell you, and themſelves verily believe it, that they ſtruck the Devil or Witch, when at the ſame time they never ſtirr'd their Hands or Arms, as aforeſaid, an Hair's breadth from the Place.</p>
               <p>This Diſeaſe happens to thoſe who ſleep on their Back, and rarely to thoſe who ſleep on their Sides Thoſe who have this Diſeaſe much and often, are in danger of falling into the Apoplexy, Vertigo, Madneſs Palſy, or Epilepſy; many Children dye of this Di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſeaſe in the Night, by reaſon of abundance of thick Vapours ariſing from the Milk they ſuck, by which means many Nurſes have been hardly and unjuſtly cenſured for Over-laying their Nurſeries, when i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Indications of the Cure of this Diſtemper are threefold: Firſt the Humour or Matter that interrupts the Flux of the Animal Spirits is to be removed, which is done by proper evacuating Medicines. Secondly, the diſcraſy of the Blood is to be rectified and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to its preſtine ſtate of Health, which is done by Specifick and Alterative Medicines. Thirdly, the Parts affected and weaken'd by the Force of the Morbifick Matter, are to be ſtrengthen'd; to do which, the ſame Order and Method, and the ſame Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that I have recommended in the laſt Chapter, for the Cure of the Falling Sickneſs, are moſt proper, tho' truly, Medicines leſs in Power and Virtue than they are endued with, might in this Diſeaſe ſerve the turn; tho' I cannot but ſay as they are the moſt powerful, ſo they are more certain and ſpeedy in their Operation, and leſs of them than others will ſuffice to compleat the Cure. I do therefore for thoſe Reaſons recommend them, and aſſure the Patient that he will not be miſtaken in his Expectations of a Cure by their Uſe,</p>

               <p>A Catarrh or Defluxion, or as ſome call it, a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation, is a flowing of ſome Excrementitious Humours from the Brain to the lower Parts, as to the Eyes, Noſe, Mouth, Palate, Throat, Lungs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that the Brain is chiefly affected, the concoctive Faculty of it being hurt, or the expulſive Faculty irritated and ſtirred up, from an abundant Repletion
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0510901800:55"/>of Flegmatick Rheum, either generated in the Brain from the hurt of the concoctive Faculty, or through the fault of the Brain it ſelf.</p>
               <p>There are many kinds of thoſe Rheums, ſome more thick, others more thin, ſome acrid and ſalt, others more ſweet, ſome flow more violently, others more ſlowly. If it be hot, 'tis ſharp and thin, flowing by the Noſe and Mouth, the Forehead and Face are hot, and the Noſe many times ſwells. If it be cold, there is a Pain and Dulneſs of the Head; the Humour that floweth down is not ſharp or pricking, but the Patient is drowſy, his Eyes dazle, his Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thick, his Noſtrils ſtop'd, all his Senſes dull, his Eyes and his whole Body heavy and lumpiſh, and each of theſe is more or leſs, as the Humour falleth more or leſs upon that Part: If the Rheum falls upon the Eyes, they look red, ſwell'd and ſore, da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maging the Sight if not ſoon cured; if upon the Noſe, there is Stoppage of the Noſtrils, loſs of Smell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Noſtrils are ſore, by the ſharpneſs of the Humour, and violent Sneezings follow; if it falls upon the Ears, it cauſes Pain in them, Deafneſs, and oftentimes Impoſthumes; if it deſcends upon the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, it cauſes Inflammation of it, Relaxation of the <hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of Melancholly; its Nature, Cauſe, and Cure.</head>
               <p>THO' Melancholly cannot be ſtrictly ſaid to be a Diſeaſe of the Head, yet as the Head is oftentimes diſturbed by it, it comes properly enough to be ſpoken of here.</p>
               <p>Melancholly, or as ſome call it, the Hippo, is a ſort of Dotage ariſing from diſturbd Phantaſms, fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0510901800:58"/>the Perſon afflicted with anxious Thoughts and Solitarineſs, being, as it were, ingulphed therein, with Penſiveneſs, Fury, or Fever; ſome are afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a deep Sadneſs or Penſiveneſs, without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Cauſe, and a long continued Silence, or elſe an incongruous Talk at random of ſome particular Thing. It is cauſed by a Diſtemper of the Animal Spirits, hurt by a Malancholly Phantaſm or Vapour, made miſty, opacous, thick, and dark, almoſt fix'd and immoveable, and from thence it is that Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly People are Tenacious; for that all kinds of Objects are fix'd in their Minds, according to the Condition and Quality of the deprav'd Spirits; and this is acquired either from a default in the Brain, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining from its genuine Whiteneſs, and generating ſuch like Spirits, or from a default of the Blood and Vital Spirits, or from ſome degenerate Melancholly Matter, as Humour, Vapour, or both, mingled with the Blood and Spirits. If it proceeds from the Brain, it is known by Sadneſs, Fearfulneſs, Hatred, and other ſtrange Imaginations; ſome think themſelves Beaſts, ſome one thing, ſome another; ſome would kill themſelves, others are afraid, ſome laugh, ſome weep, ſome prophecy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which ſhews it is from Melancholly Blood.</p>
               <p>The Species or Kinds of Melancholly are many, as firſt, that of the Brain, when it declines in Quality or Subſtance from its Purity and Cleanneſs, which is known by a perpetual and vehement Doting, ariſing either externally, from ſtrange Fancy and Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as from Fear, Diſpair, and ſuch like ſad Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of the Mind, which dry up the radical Moiſture, and cauſe Cares, Watchings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, from a Melancholly Humour gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Head, either by ſome cold or dry Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter left behind in the Brain, after ſome hot Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0510901800:59"/>the thinner part of the Matter being reſolv'd and gone; or from a Melancholly Habit and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, either Hereditary from the Parents Blood, or from a cold and dry, or hot and dry Diſpoſition of the Body, cauſing either Doting with Laughter, or a dull Slothfulneſs, or Anger, Diſcontent and Peeviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> Another kind of Melancholly is that of the whole Body, the Blood having acquired a Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly Habit, diſtributing the ſame to all the Parts, and then to the Brain; this is known becauſe the Dotage or Delirium is indeed continual, but ſo that it is with ſome Exaſperations and Remiſſions, with general Signs of a Melancholly Habit.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> There is another ſort of that Diſtemper, calld the Melancholly of the Heart, when the Vital Spirits that are there bred, by reaſon of a cold and dry Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, are made impure.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>4thly,</hi> There is that which is Hypochondriacal, wherein Melancholly Juice either cold and ſerous, or aduſt and burnt, in the Branches of the <hi>Vena Porta,</hi> is gathered together in the Hypochondria, (which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions the moſt common ſort of Melancholly, from whence, time after time, black Melancholly Vapours are continually ſent forth to corrupt the Animal Spirits in the Brain; and this is known by its ſeizing the Patient by Intervals and certain Seaſons, but in its approach, it ſurprizes without any Notice, except by windy Belchings and a Pain diſtending the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, with Anxiety of Mind, Difficulty of Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, Palpitation of the Heart, Immoveableneſs of the Tongue, Miſt or Darkneſs before the Eyes, Noiſe in the Ears, and a Stupidity or Benumbedneſs in both Arms. Theſe Melancholly Vapours or Humours, are tranſmitted from the Hypochondria to the Brain, either by the Orifice of the Stomach,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0510901800:60"/>as ſome imagine, or elſe by the Branches of the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> where they cloud and darken the Spirits.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <hi>5thly,</hi> There is Melancholly of the Womb in Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which is diſcovered by a Pain in the Left-ſide, and a manifeſt Pulſe and Beating in the Back near the <hi>Diaphragm,</hi> being cauſed by Stoppage of the Courſes, or other Natural Evacuations.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <hi>6thly,</hi> There is a Melancholly from Love, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned either from Philters or Love Potions, or elſe from a Luſtful Appetite, or Deſire of Venery, cauſed from an hot Conſtitution, and an over abundance of Seed; in which Caſe the Fancy is not fix'd upon one Perſon, but the Patient by Fits delights to be in the Company of Men promiſcuouſly, talks leudly, and is ready to call them to her, tho' before, and at other times, ſhe is very Chaſte and Modeſt.</p>
               <p>But as the ſort of Melancholly which generally afflicts People, is that of the Hypochonders, it may not be amiſs to ſay ſomething more at large of its Nature, and after that of its Cauſe, before I come to ſhew the Cure of it.</p>
               <p>Hypochondriack Melancholly is a Collection of filthy and vicious Humours in the Branches of the <hi>Vena Porta, Caeliacal</hi> and <hi>Meſenterical</hi> Arteries, by reaſon of a Fault of the Concoction of the Spleen, without Putrifaction, thence ſending many Vapours, cauſing imminent Symptoms. 'Tis call'd Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondriacal, becauſe it poſſeſſes the place of both Hypochonders, <hi>viz.</hi> that part of the Body, which under the Baſtard or ſhort Ribs, reaches as far as the Loins, on both ſides, comprehending with the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles the Bowels themſelves, and call'd Melancholly, when the Brain is affected by Conſent.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that are afflicted with Hypochondriack Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly, find a Rawneſs, Windineſs, ſharp Belchings, Crudities, Burning, and Pain of the Stomach and Sides,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0510901800:61"/>which are pluck'd upwards, and ſometimes inflamed; the Belly is bound, ſleep little, and that with trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome Dreams, Sadneſs, given to be Thoughtful, Idle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe are the general Symptoms, but the more particular ones, which People afflicted find more or leſs, according as they are of Conſtitution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ranged as follow, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <item>V. Urine ſometimes thin and pale like Water, and ſometimes thick and troubled with now and then a Sediment of red Sand.</item>
                  <item>VI. A Motion of Wind in the left Hypochonder cauſing great Pain.</item>
                  <item>VII. Anxiety, cauſed by Wind diſtending the Hypochonders, thereby cauſing a ſtraitneſs in thoſe Parts, which have Nerves from the ſixth Conjuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</item>
                  <item>VIII. A Palpitation of the Heart, either from the Malignity of the Vapours in the Part, or by Conſent of the Stomach.</item>
                  <item>IX. A beating in the Left Hypochonder, cauſed either by the great Pulſation of the <hi>Caeliacal</hi> Branch of the Arteries after Anger or violent Motion, or by the Compreſſion of the Arteries in the <hi>Meſentery,</hi> by the Glandules being more than ordinarily extended.</item>
                  <item>X. A Dryneſs in the Mouth, Tongue and Palate, by reaſon of hot Vapours aſcending through the Gullet and rough Artery.</item>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0510901800:62"/>
                  <item>XI. A Difficulty of Breathing, both by reaſon of the Affection of the Nerves dedicated to the Muſcles of the Breaſt, and of the Affuſion of evil Matter into the Spaces of the Muſcles.</item>
                  <item>XII. A Perturbation of the Brain from Vapours reſolv'd, which if they be obſcure they darken the Spirits, and cauſe Melancholly Dotage; if dry, an <hi>Epilepſy</hi> and Watchings; and if many, the Vertigo and a Fear of Strangling, or Stupidity.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Theſe are the Symptoms of Hypochondriack Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly, but all of them are rarely to be ſeen in one Perſon, the moſt certain Symptoms that always attend, are Grippings and Wind in the Bowels, a weak Stomach, and ſometimes a very keen one, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiveneſs, Belchings, Palpitation of the Heart, Pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations of the Head, and a diſturb'd or uneaſy Mind.</p>
               <p>The Symptoms being thus premiſed, let us now inquire more particularly after their Cauſe. The firſt Cauſe is a Vicious Acid in the Stomach, inlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Appetite, but unfit for Digeſtion, hence enſues an Acid Crudity in the firſt Paſſages, which depraves the Craſis of the Blood, prevents the due ſeparation of the Volatile Spirits; upon which the Lymphatick Juice becomes Acid, and the Bileous Juice In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the Sources of all the preceding Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, ſince Wind, Noiſe, Griping in the Guts, and. Coſtiveneſs, are the natural Reſult of a Viſcous Acid in the firſt Paſſages; as alſo Fluſhings in the Face, ariſing from its Efferveſſence with the Bile. The Convulſions of the Nervous Membranes in ſeveral Parts of the Body, are the Effects of its Irritation; its Crudity impairs the due Fermentation of the Blood, and cauſes a Palpitation of the Heart, and difficulty in Breathing; it depraves the Nutritious Juice of the Bowels, which ſettles into hard Swellings, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0510901800:63"/>a Degeneracy and Auſterity in the Spirits; hence Fear, Melancholly, irregular Thoughts, and uncouth Emotions enſue.</p>
               <p>The Procatartick or remote Cauſes that promote Crudities, are Acid Liquors, or Salt Victuals, or ſuch as are dried in the Smoak; both which par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Acid Spirit of Salt or Soot; want of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to promote Digeſtion, and the ſpeedy Aſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Chyle; Nocturnal Study or Care; exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Blood and rendring the Lympha Acid, which at length brings on a Nervous <hi>Atrophy;</hi> this Diſeaſe being an Enemy to the Nervous Syſtem.</p>
               <p>So much for the Symptoms and Cauſes of the Hypochondriack Diſeaſe, which is generally obſerv'd to happen to Scorbutick Bodies, and to People of the beſt Senſe and good Underſtanding, it being ſeldom ſeen that Fools and Blockheads are troubled with that Diſtemper.</p>
               <p>This Diſeaſe is truly difficult to Cure, by reaſon of the mighty Heap of Symptoms that commonly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Perſons afflicted with it; it is ſeldom mortal, but of very long continuance, ſometimes laſting even the whole period of Life, for which Reaſon it is call'd <hi>The Diſgrace of Phyſicians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be attended with continual Pain and Giddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Head, it gives fears of the <hi>Epilepſy, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy,</hi> or Blindneſs. If it be accompanyed with a moderate Flux of the Belly, (for it is good to be looſe, bad to be coſtive) Vomiting, or Haemorrhoids, it is good, but if thoſe Fluxes continue long, it is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. Sometimes the Patient ſeems to be cured, and then in a few Months it returns again: It is much eaſier cured if taken in the beginning, and happening to People neither in a full, or declining Age; alſo Men are eaſier cured than Women; the Fat and Fair, than the Lean and Swarthy.</p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:0510901800:64"/>
               <p>The Cure of this Diſtemper conſiſts primarily and peculiarly in opening all Obſtructions in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, Bowels and other Paſſages, by which the Digeſtions may be perfected and good Chyle aſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated. Secondly in tempering the Evil Quality of the Humours. Thirdly in evacuating the Morbifick Matter. Fourthly in altering the Habit of the Body, and ſtrengthening the weakened Parts.</p>
               <p>To accompliſh theſe Four Intentions, Authors preſcribe more Medicines than there are Symptoms, and which for any one to follow, would rather per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex than profit. Some run altogether on Steel Courſes, and preſcribe them promiſcuouſly to all; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are much devoted to Teſtaceous Pouders, which they call Sweetners; others again to Acids, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in oppoſition to Alcalies. Some are for Volatile Salts and Spirits, others for fix'd Salts and Cardiacks; ſome highly applaud Emeticks, others condemn them, and cry up Catharticks; others are for Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, others for Aperitives. And thus do they vary as their Opinions or Inclinations lead them, without conſidering with that mature Judgment they ought, or making juſt Obſervations; which is the reaſon ſo few are cured, or ſo ordinarily relieved.</p>
               <p>But as the whole Cure of this Diſtemper hinges upon the Four Points mentioned, when thoſe Points are maturely conſidered, and Medicines accordingly adapted, it is not to be doubted but the end will be accompliſh'd; and to ſpeak truly, I never found, where the Patient was ſteady in the Method pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed him, but that in the End a Cure was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
               <p>To do this, I rely upon the Two Medicines follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>viz.</hi> my <hi>Hypochondriacum Digeſtivum,</hi> and <hi>Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis Corroborans.</hi> The firſt anſwers the Three firſt Intentions of Cure, and the ſecond the laſt: But as
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0510901800:65"/>this Diſeaſe is moſt commonly Chronick and laſting, they muſt be taken for ſome time together, or elſe a Cure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cannot be expected, at leaſt wiſe to be durable, it being the Nature of it to return again, if the Cauſe be not totally removed, and the Tone of the Parts fully recovered: Therefore the Patient is firſt to take my <hi>Hypochondriacum Digeſtivum</hi> for ſo long time as that he finds no Remains of the Diſeaſe, but is free in every Reſpect from each particular Symptom, and this he may expect to find in about Five or Six Weeks time, if the Diſeaſe be not very inveterate; and when the Symptoms are off, he is to take my <hi>Pulvis Corroborans</hi> to ſtrengthen the Tone of the Parts, the Craſis of the Blood being beforehand brought to rights; and that he is to continue for about Three, Four or Five Weeks, or longer if he finds any remaining Weakneſs, or other Indiſpoſition to give him fear of a return of his Illneſs.</p>

               <p>He may go abroad with theſe Medicines, and by all means ſhould uſe Exerciſe, during the whole time of his taking them, and none like that of the Horſe, to ride every Forenoon, about two Hours after ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, for an Hour or two, which procures him an Appetite to his Dinner; and to ride again about two Hours more, which facilitates Digeſtion, and beſides that, will, by the ſhaking, ſtir up, for natural Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, thoſe ſtagnating Juices which would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſubſide. But by riding I do not mean he muſt ride hard, either to tire or ſweat, but <hi>ad ruborem ſed non ſudorem,</hi> and ſo as to be as eaſy and lightſome when he gets off his Horſe, as when he got on. He may eat freſh Meat, and that Heartily, all ſorts of Herbs, Fruits, or the like, that are agreeable, and drink now and then a Glaſs, Two or Three of good Red Wine, ſuch as <hi>Florence, Viana, Portugal,</hi> or <hi>French</hi> Wine; and for his conſtant Drink he muſt take Wine and Water, inſtead of Malt Liquors, all which if he obſerves, and alſo follows his Medicines and Riding daily, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, his Cure will certainly be effected, as he him

By this means I have cured many, and ſome whoſe Caſes were very inveterate, and as believed by thoſe they had before applyed to for help, incurable. I could give Inſtances of ſeveral with their Names, but the former being inconſiſtent with the deſigned Brevity of this Treatiſe, and being prohibited the latter, I ſhall only inſert one Caſe, and conclude this Chapter.</p>
               <p>A Gentleman highly Scorbutick, fell into a Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly with Pains in the Hypochondria, which afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him for a long time, vitiated all the Juices of his Body, and wholly ſubverted the Concoctions, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that he had moſt of the worſt Symptoms men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to attend that Diſtemper, as fluſhing Heats, Pains in the Head, Wind, Belchings, Tremblings, Horrors, Frights, and the like, for which he had Purged times without number, Bled, and taken An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſcorbuticks of all kinds, with all the Teſtaceous Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which are reckoned Sweetners; had paſſed thro' long Courſes of Steel, drank all ſorts of Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; had ſuffered the Pennance of Seatons, Iſſues, Bliſters, and Cuppings to eaſe his Head, which uſed very much to be diſordered, till at length being quite tired out by his Diſeaſe and Medicines, he reſolved to deſiſt, and as patiently as he could, wait for his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed departure, which he was certain to himſelf could not be long, his Illneſs being ſuch, as Nature, to his thinking, could not long ſubſiſt under. Thus being in a manner, quite worn out, and lamenting his hard Fortune to a Friend, that came to ſee him, who had been my Patient, he told him what I had done for him and others in Diſtempers of the Head, and adviſed him to conſult me, which he did, and whom

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of Vapours or Hyſterick Fits; their real Cauſe and Cure.</head>
               <p>WHAT I have ſaid in the Chapter before, of Hypochondriack Melancholly, gives ſome Idea of the Diſtemper I am now about to ſpeak of, tho' I am not of the Opinion of <hi>Sylvius</hi> and <hi>Willis,</hi> who alledge that the Difference between them is ſo little, that they are taken to be one and the ſame. I ſay I am not of their Opinion, becauſe the ſame Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines that Cure the one, have no effect on the other, and that becauſe they affect different Sexes from dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Cauſes, tho' I muſt allow, that there is an Analogy between them in ſome Symptoms, and from ſome Cauſes, but yet ſo far from being general, that it is but in ſome few Particulars; the Symptoms of Vapours or Hyſterick Diſeaſes, being incident to the Female Sex chiefly, in the manner Men cannot have them, and are ſo numerous that a Day will ſcarce be ſufficient to reckon them up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Democritus</hi> in an Epiſtle to <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> ſaid, <hi>That the Womb was the Cauſe of Six Hundred Miſeries, and of innumerable Calamities,</hi> and among them reckons Hyſterick Fits or Vapours, whence it is plain, he concludes that they ariſe from a diſtemperature of the Womb, concerning which, I ſhall by and by ſpeak.</p>
               <p>The Vapours or Hyſterick Fits, together with the Hypochondriack Diſeaſe, are the moſt frequent of all Chronick Diſtempers; the Vapours few Women are wholly free from, more or leſs; and thoſe Men that lead Sedentary Lives and Study hard, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly afflicted with Hypochondriack Melancholly.</p>
               <p>The Vapours or Hyſterick Fits, are not only fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to Women, but are ſo wonderfully various,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0510901800:71"/>that they reſemble almoſt all the Diſeaſes poor Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals are ſubject to; for whatever Parts they ſeat themſelves in, they preſently produce ſuch Symptoms as belong to thoſe Parts when primarily affected with a real Diſtemper: As for Inſtance, if the Vapours ſeize the Head, they produce ſome Diſorder or other there; or if the Spirits, ſome violent Commotions of Mind are preſently occaſioned, and ſo of the reſt.</p>
               <p>This Diſtemper is call'd the Hyſterick or Uterine Paſſion, becauſe the Authors that firſt wrote about it, thought that the Womb was principally affected in it, by reaſon it commonly invaded Maids, married Women, and Widows both old and young, which Opinion is not fully agreed to, tho' we can't but ſay it is fomented and ſuſtained, by a Fault that is in the Womb, as well as the other Viſcera, which the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it by Medicines adapted to the Womb demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, yet it principally proceeds from a Fault in the Blood and Spirits, injured by bad Humours, from Cold, ill Food, Traſh, and the like, which ſtagnating by the Patient's Sedentary or Idle Life, depraves the Blood, and gives it a bad Diſpoſition, able to produce the Hyſterick Paſſion; of which by treating we mean not one, but a whole Army of Diſtempers, at leaſt in outward ſhew, it being a Diſeaſe that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces Head-achs, Giddineſs, Convulſive Motions Palpitations of the Heart, Rumblings and Agitations of the Stomach and Guts, Difficulty of Breathing Hickup, loſs of Senſes both External and Internal, by which Phyſicians ſpeak of them under divers Heads tho' they be from one and the ſame Cauſe.</p>
               <p>This Diſtemper call'd Vapours or Hyſterick Paſſion in Women, is not always attended with the ſam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Number of Symptoms, nor are the Symptoms th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ſame, or equally violent in all, for in ſome the Suffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Difficulty of Breathing are but ſlight, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:0510901800:72"/>others very ſevere; therefore in deſcribing the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, it is not to be underſtood that they are leſs the Vapours, becauſe they have not all of them, for ſome feel the Symptoms as aforeſaid in the Head, and there is Giodineſs, Swimming, Pain, and the like. In others, the Vital parts are affected, which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſo great a Palpitation of the Heart, that the Patient verily believes the By-ſtanders may hear the ſound of the Heart thumping upon the Ribs. Some it affects ſo, as to cauſe Coughing without intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but they expectorate nothing. Sometimes the Vapoury Humours fall upon the Parts between the Stomach a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d Bowels and occaſion violent Pain, much like the <hi>Illiack Paſſion,</hi> and cauſe the Women to Vomit a green matter like porraceous Bile. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Spirits are ſo ſeized, that the Patient is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with great Anguiſh of Mind, and wholly diſpairs of Recovery with Dejections, and as it were a certain Deſperation. Sometimes this Diſeaſe falls upon the Kidneys, and cauſes Pain like the Stone, or Stone Cholick. Sometimes it falls on the Bladder (tho' ſeldom) and ſtops the Urine, as if there was a Stone there. Sometimes it falls upon the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and cauſes continual Vomiting, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times upon the Bowels, and then a Looſeneſs follows, but generally no Pain accompanies either of theſe Symptoms, tho oftentimes in both, the green Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour aforementioned, appears either by Vomit or Stool.</p>
               <p>And as this Diſeaſe afflicts almoſt all the inward Parts, ſo ſometimes it ſeizes all the outward Parts and Muſculous Fleſh, occaſioning Pain, and ſometimes a Tumour in the Jaws, Shoulders, Hands, Thighs and Legs, of which kind, that Tumour which ſwells <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>heſe Pains and Swellings, afflicting the outward Parts,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0510901800:73"/>chiefly ſeize thoſe Women that are in a manner quite deſtroy'd by a long Series and Force of the Vapours.</p>
               <p>But amongſt all the Torments of this Diſeaſe, there is none ſo common as a Pain in the Back, which moſt certainly all Women feel, how little ſoever they are afflicted with the Vapours. It is alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, that after the Pains are gone off, there is ſuch a ſtiffneſs of the Parts, or Numbneſs or Soreneſs, as if beaten, ſo that the Patient cannot bear to have the Places touch'd; but this Tenderneſs goes off by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. And this amongſt the reſt is worth obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That all Hyſterick Women complain of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and Sinking of the Spirits, who when they would ſhew the place where the ſinking of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits is, point to the Region of the Lungs.</p>
               <p>Yet of all the Symptoms that attend this Diſeaſe, nothing is more common or inſeparable, and more ſhews the Patient to be troubled with Vapours, than that their Urine is as clear as Rock-water, and comes away, when they make it, in a plentiful quantity-eſpecially when they have juſt before found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves faint, ill, or ſickiſh. Moreover, Women much troubled with Vapours belch up ill Fumes as often as they eat, tho' they only eat moderately, and as they have an Appetite. Alſo they ſometimes in their Fits laugh exceedingly, and ſome times cry as much, without any real Cauſe for either.</p>
               <p>The efficient Cauſe of this Diſeaſe, in my Opinion, proceeds from a Confuſion of the Spirits; the origin and antecedent Cauſe of which Confuſion, is the weak Conſtitution of the Spirits and <hi>Genus Nervoſum,</hi> and that weak Conſtitution injured as before ſaid, is the Cauſe of the many Symptoms that are attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as we have in ſomewhat particular terms ennumerated.</p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:0510901800:74"/>
               <p>As to the Prognoſticks, this Diſeaſe ſeldom kills the Patient, yet ſometimes it ſnatches them away when the Fit is intenſe and laſts very long, or elſe draws on an Apoplexy or Syncope.</p>
               <p>Of the ſeveral degrees of the Vapours or Hyſterick Fits, <hi>That</hi> is the worſt, in which many Parts ſuffer Convulſions, and the Exerciſe of the Senſes is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted; but <hi>That</hi> is ſlighter, where the Mind is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched, or the right uſe of it not taken away, and but one or two Parts are convulſed, eſpecially if the Vital Functions remain entire. In ancient People it is hardly curable, becauſe in them the Habit is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted; in young Women it ſometimes ceaſes of it ſelf, as they grow in Years, or when they begin to have Chindren. Hyſterick Fits are dangerous to Women with Child, and in Child-bed, to the firſt for fear of miſcarrying, and to the laſt by reaſon of their Weakneſs got in Labour.</p>
               <p>The Cure of the Vapours is twofold, in the Fit, eſpecially when it is violent and of long duration, and out of the Fits, to prevent their coming again. Authors to bring the Patient out of the Fit, adviſe hard rubbing in the lower Parts, and Scarification in the Hips; they recommend likewiſe the pulling out the Hairs, the twiſting of the Fingers, the putting to the Noſe Foeted things, as Aſſafaetida, Galbanum, burnt Feathers or Leather, Brimſtone lighted, the Smoak of Tobacco, Spirit, or Salt of Hartshorn, Armoniack, ſharp Snuff, of white Hellebore, Eupho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bium, or the like, ſome of which have done, and may do good, when the Fit is not very extream; but in all Caſes of Deſperation, and alſo where the Fit is not very violent, (becauſe the ſooner the Patient is brought out of the Fit the better) I uſe my Apople<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick Species preſcribed in the 8th Chapter aforego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blowing a very little of it up each Noſtril, which
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0510901800:75"/>inſtantly brings the Patient to her ſelf, that ſhe is not ſo fatigued, nor her Spirits ſo worn or ſpent, as they generally are if the Fit continues for a long time; this and this alone I have uſed times without Number, with all the ſucceſs imaginable, and therefore can and do with the more freedom recommend it, it being, I believe, the only thing to ſave Life, where there is danger, in any ſudden Fit of any kind, in Old or Young.</p>
               <p>I was once call'd to a Lady, taken of a ſudden with a Fit of the Vapours, which ſhe had been many Years ſubject to, tho' nothing near ſo violent as then; ſeveral Surgeons were inſtantly call'd, as well as Neighbours and Friends, who when they came, thought ſhe was dying, ſome that ſhe was dead, no Life or Breath, to appearance, being left. The Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons bled her, uſed Oil of Amber, Spirit of Harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn, and the like, but nothing moved her. I came after ſhe was blooded, and ſeeing her Caſe, and the Conſternation all about her were in, immediately blew up into each Noſtril, with a Quill, a little o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
