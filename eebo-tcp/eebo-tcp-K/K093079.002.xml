            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>WHEN approach'd by the fair dewy fingers of Spring,</l>
               <l>Swelling buds open firſt, and look gay,</l>
               <l>When the birds on the boughs by their mates ſit and ſing,</l>
               <l>And are danc'd by the breeze on each ſpray:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>When gently deſcending, the rain in ſoft ſhowers,</l>
               <l>With its moiſture refreſhes the ground,</l>
               <l>And the drops, as they hang on the plants and the flowers,</l>
               <l>Like rich gems beam a luſtre around:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>When the wood-pigeons ſit on the branches and cooe,</l>
               <l>And the cuckow proclaims with his voice,</l>
               <l>That Nature marks this for the ſeaſon to wooe,</l>
               <l>And for all that can love to rejoice:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>In a cottage at night may I ſpend all my time,</l>
               <l>In the fields and the meadows all day,</l>
               <l>With a maiden whoſe charms are as yet in their prime,</l>

               <l>View the far diſtant hills which the ſun beams adorn,</l>
               <l>Then ariſe, and our cottage forſake.</l>

               <l>Let us there all vain thoughts and ambition defy,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>While the bee flies from bloſſom to bloſſom and ſips,</l>

               <l>Let me hang on her neck, and ſo taſte from her lips</l>
               <l>The rich cordial that thrills to the heart.</l>

Now, th' impetuous torrents riſe;</l>
               <l>The hoarſe-aſcending deluge roars:</l>
               <l>Down ruſh the cataracts from the ſkies;</l>
               <l>The ſwelling waves o'erwhelm the ſhores.</l>
               <l>Juſt, O God, is thy decree!</l>

               <l>Lo, Hate and Envy, ſea-entomb'd,</l>
               <l>And Rage with Luſt in ruin ſleep;</l>
               <l>And ſcoffing Luxury is doom'd</l>
               <l>To glut the vaſt and ravenous deep!—</l>
               <l>In vain from Fate th' aſtoniſh'd remnant flies:—</l>

               <l>The tottering cliffs no more the floods controul;</l>
               <l>Sea following ſea ingulphs the ball:</l>
               <l>O'er the ſunk hills the watry mountains roll,</l>
               <l>And wide Deſtruction ſwallows all:</l>

               <l>Thus while the frowning ſhepherd pour'd along</l>
               <l>The deep impetuous torrent of his ſong;</l>
               <l>Saul, ſtung by dire deſpair,</l>

               <l>A cold and agonizing ſweat diſtill'd:</l>
               <l>Then, foaming with unutterable ſmart.</l>

               <l>Unaw'd by conſcience, of no gods afraid,</l>
               <l>Ne juſtice rul'd his heart, ne mercy ſway'd.</l>
               <l>Some held him kin to that abhorred race,</l>

               <l>But he, perdy, far other tale did feign,</l>

               <l>Clear, without ſpot, as ſummer's cloudleſs ſky.</l>

               <l>At length by hope embolden'd to reveal,</l>
               <l>The labouring ſecret dropped from his tong.</l>

               <l>Framing new trains when nought mote ſerve his old.</l>

                  <l>Here was my refuge.—All the live-long night</l>
                  <l>Penſive by one pale loneſome lamp we ſat,</l>

                  <l>And the ſhrill craſh of foreſts from without.</l>
                  <l>Soon as the morning dawn'd, the craggy height</l>

                  <l>His ruſtic temple ſtood, and moſs-grown croſs</l>
                  <l>(The ſacred object of his pious prayers)</l>

               <l>That o'er yon caverns ſtretch your pendent ſhade,</l>
               <l>Where ſacred Silence lulls the rural vale,</l>
               <l>And Love in whiſpers tells his tender tale,</l>
               <l>Ye lonely rocks, ye ſtreams that ever flow,</l>
               <l>Still as my tears, and conſtant as my woe,</l>
               <l>To you behold the wretched Laura flies,</l>
               <l>And haunts thoſe ſeats from whence her ſorrows riſe;</l>
               <l>Where, loſt to love, how often has ſhe ſtray'd?</l>
               <l>When the fond lover led his bluſhing maid,</l>
               <l>When his ſoft lips, too eloquent his art,</l>
               <l>Pour'd the warm wiſh, and breath'd out all his heart.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Ah once lov'd ſeats, your pleaſing ſcenes are o'er,</l>

While through your ſolitary paths I rove,</l>
               <l>A prey to grief, to ſickneſs, and to love.</l>
               <l>Tho' gentle Zephyrs fan the bending bowers,</l>

               <l>'Twas ere the blooming ſweets of May</l>
               <l>Had loſt their freſheſt hues,</l>
               <l>When every flower on every hill,</l>
               <l>In every vale, had drank its fill</l>
               <l>Of ſunſhine, and of dews.</l>
            </lg>

               <l>In ſhort, 'twas that ſweet ſeaſon's prime</l>
               <l>When Spring gives up the reins of Time</l>
               <l>To Summer's glowing hand,</l>
               <l>And doubting mortals hardly know,</l>
               <l>By whoſe command the breezes blow</l>
               <l>Which fan the ſmiling land.</l>
