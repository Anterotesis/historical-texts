            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IN the following little Treatiſe, intended for the Uſe of Children, the Author has endeavoured to ſet down his Meaning juſt as he would explain it by Word of Mouth, to a young Perſon an intire ſtranger to Muſick, enlarging and more minutely expreſſing many Things, which, to Perſons of maturer Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might have been explained in fewer Words. It is hoped, therefore, that the critical Reader will not take Exception to the Imperfections of Style, or Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tology that may have been occaſioned by this Method of treating the Subject. If in other Reſpects it ſhall be found to anſwer the Purpoſe of Inſtruction, this is all that is aimed at.</p>
            <p>The Author, however, that he may not ſeem to make much ado about no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, begs leave to aſſure his Readers, that, inſignificant as his Method of hit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Diſtances may appear to ſome, it has nevertheleſs been practiſed, by ſeveral Perſons, with great Succeſs. He therefore flatters himſelf, that the young Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, for whoſe Uſe the following Rules were drawn up, will not eſteem them unworthy their Conſideration, eſpecially when they ſhall find that this Method of learning Muſick requires very little Time in Compariſon of the old Method of Sol fa-ing.</p>
            <p>It is not alledged or pretended that a Child may comprehend theſe Rules of himſelf without the Aſſiſtance of ſome underſtanding Perſon, who, by reading them over with him, ſhall teach him how to apply them—neither does he ſay that they are ſufficient to make a ſkilful Muſician; nor does he recommend them to ſuch Children as are bred Muſicians by Profeſſion; but to ſuch only as cannot be allowed Time enough from their other School Studies to learn Muſick in the regular Way, but yet may be enabled in a little Time, by this Method, to bear a CHORUS PART in the Service of God.</p>

               <head>RULE III.</head>
               <p>If one Half-Tone is found between the 3d and 4th Notes of the Key, and the other between the 7th and 8th (commonly called the 4th and 8th Places) then it is a Sharp Key.</p>

               <p>The following Rule will explain this.</p>

Before I can give the Learner an Example of this Rule, he muſt be well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Nature of the Cliffs; which, from their Situation on the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of a Line, readily determine the Name of each Note. For Example:</p>
               <p>Whatever Line in a Stave ſhall have the C Cliff marked upon it, at the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, muſt be called C, and all the other Lines and Spaces muſt take their Names from it, riſing in alphabetical Order.

               <p>There are but 3 Cliffs in Muſick, Viz.</p>

               <p>Secondly the C Cliff marked <gap reason="music">
                     <desc>〈♫〉</desc>
                  </gap>. It is called Tenor, Contratenor, or Soprano Cliff, according to the Line on which it is placed; which Line (being made C by the Cliff) is in the ſame Octave with the loweſt C in the G Cliff marked <gap reason="music">

               <p>The eaſieſt Method of hitting the Diſtances is practiſed by thoſe who play on the <hi>French</hi> Horn, or Trumpet: for as the Tones from thoſe Inſtruments are not form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Fingering, like others, but only by the Lips and Breath; ſo the Idea of paſſing from Note to Note muſt be much the ſame as in Singing. They com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſound the Key-Note of their Inſtrument, and its 3d, 5th, and Octave, backwards and forwards, in tuning, before they begin to play any Piece, and ſtrictly obſerve what Lines or Spaces thoſe Notes (the 3d, 5th, and 8th) ſhould be placed, according to the Cliff they play in; for, as they muſt keep the Sound of their Key Note in Idea, ſo they readily from thence ſound the 3d, 5th, and Octave, having uſed their Ear to thoſe Diſtances, which, like Steps, convey the Performer to all other Notes of the muſical Scale. Before the Young Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner ſtudies the following Examples, he muſt accuſtom himſelf (by Ear only, and without Notes) to ſound, firſt, the ſharp 3d, and the 5th, and 8th, and then the flat 3d, and the 5th, and 8th, to any given Note; which any Perſon, who has the leaſt Knowledge of Muſick, can teach him, by firſt ſounding them for him to imitate. Let him likewiſe be uſed to ſound the 5th and Octave to any given Note, miſſing the 3d, as <gap reason="music">
                     <desc>〈♫〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈♫〉</desc>
                  </gap> And if he finds it difficult to hit a 3d, let him ſuppoſe a Note between the given Note and the 3d, as <gap reason="music">
                     <desc>〈♫〉</desc>
                  </gap> To find the Tone of a 7th let him ſuppoſe the Octave before it, as <gap reason="music">

                  </gap> To hit a 6th, let him ſuppoſe the 5th firſt, as <gap reason="music">

A Sharp is marked ♯, and makes every Note, before which it is ſet, half a Note or Tone higher.</p>
               <p>When any Note (having a b or ♯ ſet at the Beginning of its Line or Space) is required by the Melody to be ſung as if there was no b or ♯, then this Mark ♮ (called a Natural) is placed before it.</p>

               <p>N. B. The following ſhort Example is not intended to be ſung (for it is not agreeable to the Rules of Modulation to aſcend gradually the 4 upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Notes of a Flat Key) but is merely ſpeculative, to ſhew the Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Half-Notes. <gap reason="music">

               </p>
               <p>Refer to the 5th Rule for the Explanation, which will lie as follows:
<list>
                     <item>From the Key-Note C to D is a Whole-Tone,</item>
                     <item>and from D to E is a Whole-Tone,</item>
                     <item>but from D to E b is but Half a Tone, for the b, marked at the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Space, makes E Half a Tone lower, and conſequently Half a Tone near D. N. B. This Half-Note is between the 2d and 3d commonly called the 3d Place.</item>
                     <item>Then from E b to F muſt be a Whole-Tone, becauſe, from E, without the b, to F, according to the 5th Rule, is an Half-Tone.</item>
                     <item>From F to G is a Whole-Tone, and</item>
                     <item>from G to A is a Whole-Tone, but from G to A b (the b be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing marked on the Space of the Octave below) is but Half a Tone. N. B. This is between the 5th and 6th, called the 6th Place.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Then from A b to B b is a whole Tone, for as they both have a Flat (A on the Space, and B on the Line of their Octaves below) ſo are they both brought an Half-Tone lower, and conſequently are ſtill the ſame Diſtance from each other, which the 5th Rule mentions. Then from B b to C is a Whole-Tone, the B being made Half a Tone further from C by the b; this therefore, according to the 4th Rule, muſt be a Flat Key, having one Half-Note between the 2d and 3d, and the other between the 5th and 6th.</p>
               <p>Let the Learner be very careful to ſound the 7th a Whole-Tone below the Octave; for, after ſinging in a Sharp Key, he will be very liable to make it only Half a Note lower.</p>

                     <item>From E to F is Half a Tone, but to F ♯ (the ♯ placed at the Beginning of the Line, making it Half a Tone higher) is a Whole-Tone.</item>

                     <item>From A to B is a Whole-Tone.</item>
                     <item>From B to C is Half a Tone, but a ♯ being placed on the Space of the Octave below makes C Half a Tone higher, ſo it is conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a Whole-Note from B to C ♯.</item>
                     <item>From C ♯ to D is Half a Tone, C being made Half a Note higher, and nearer D by the ♯; ſo that, as this Half-Tone is between the 7th and 8th, and the other between the 3d and 4th, it muſt be a Sharp Key, according to the 3d Rule.</item>

               <p>Refer again to the 5th Rule, beginning with the Key-Note B, as follows:
<list>
                     <item>From B to C is Half a Tone, but from B to C ♯ is a Whole-Tone.</item>
                     <item>From C ♯ to D can be but Half a Tone, becauſe from C Natural to D is a Whole-Tone.<note>N. B. Between the 2d and 3d.</note>
                     </item>
                     <item>From D to E is a Whole-Tone.</item>
                     <item>From E to F ♯ is a Whole-Tone, the ♯ removing F Half a Tone higher and further from E.</item>
                     <item>From F ♯ to G is but Half a Tone, the ♯ removing F Half a Note higher, and nearer to G. <note>N. B. Between the 5th and 6th.</note>
                     </item>
                     <item>From G to A is a Whole-Tone; and</item>
                     <item>from A to B is a Whole-Tone: therefore this Example, according to the 4th Rule, muſt be a Flat Key, having one Half-Tone between the 2d and 3d, and the other between the 5th and 6th.</item>

               </p>
               <p>In the ſame Manner are all other Keys to be proved, the Key-Note being found by the 7th Rule.</p>
               <p>The next Thing to be conſidered is TIME, or the Length of Notes, which the following Table will ſhew.</p>

                     <desc>〈♫〉</desc>
                  </gap> Quavers, which are as long as 16 <gap reason="music">

                  </gap> Semiquavers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0062600600:12"/>
Every Piece of Muſick, having 4 Crotchets in a Bar, is ſaid to be in COMMON-TIME, and has generally this Mark C put at the Beginning of the Stave.</p>
               <p>thus <gap reason="music">
                     <desc>〈♫〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </p>
               <p>For the more exact keeping of this Meaſure, it is uſual to beat with the Hand at the Beginning of every Bar, and to keep it down during one Half of the Bar; viz. while you count 1 and 2, and to hold it up while you count 3 and 4, the remaining Half of the Bar.</p>
               <p>When a Piece of Muſick has 3 Crotchets in a Bar, it is then called triple Time, and is marked at the Beginning of a Stave <gap reason="music">
                     <desc>〈♫〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </p>
               <p>In beating of this Time, you muſt count the 2 firſt Crotchets with your Hand down, and the 3d with your Hand up.</p>
               <p>The next material Thing to be conſidered in vocal Muſick, is the ſpeaking of the Words diſtinct and plain; which alone, and not the Singing quick (a falſe Notion which too much prevails in Choir Muſick) can add Spirit to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance; but this, if the Student's own Genius does not direct him, muſt be taught by a good Maſter, as it cannot ſo eaſily be explained in Writing.</p>
               <p>To conclude, I muſt adviſe the Learner to chooſe the eaſieſt and ſloweſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions to begin his Practice with, ſuch as common Pſalm Tunes, and other ſlow Movements.</p>
               <p>A further and compleat Underſtanding of vocal Muſick, can only be acquired by being long converſant in the Science.</p>
