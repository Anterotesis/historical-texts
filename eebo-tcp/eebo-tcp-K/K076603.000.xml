            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Chaplain, Mr. <hi>Seaton,</hi> has lately publiſh'd an <hi>Eſſay on the Eternity of the Son of God,</hi> addreſs'd to the Laity of this City; and written, I muſt confeſs, in a cool and ſober Manner; but as it were in Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of ſuch your Lordſhip's Proceedings: I think it cannot, on all theſe Accounts, be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for me, who ſo greatly diſſent from your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and your Chaplain in theſe Matters, to addreſs this Paper to your Lordſhip, and therein to lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you and the Chriſtian World a fair Collection of the ſacred and primitive Teſtimonies concerning this important Point; I mean, whether God the Father be the only Eternal Being, the only Eternal God; or whether the Son and Holy Spirit be alſo Eternal Beings, or be <hi>Coeternal</hi> with the Father, as all the real <hi>Trinitarians</hi> aſſert. I ſay <hi>real Trinitarians</hi> only: for as for the nominal or modal Trinitarians, which alſo include the <hi>Sabellians</hi> and <hi>Socinians,</hi> and are now the moſt numerous, who ſay the Son and Spirit are not really different from, but are, or make up, together with the Father, the One Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal God, there is no room for the Queſtion among them at all: It being the abſurdeſt Thing in the World to ſuppoſe that God is not coeternal to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, tho' the Expreſſion be ſomewhat extraordinary. Now, in order to ſatisfy your Lordſhip and the World in this Matter, I ſhall beg Leave at preſent to wave the common Method of diſputing, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing, and pleading, and drawing uncertain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences on either Side, and ſhall ſet down, inſtead thereof, a Collection of thoſe original Texts and Teſtimonies which relate to this important Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; that ſo every one may, with his own natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral common Senſe and Judgment, and without Fear of being impos'd upon by modern Inferences, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially pronounce on which Side the ſuperior E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence lies. Your Lordſhip well knows that Truth is beſt diſcover'd by the open, fair, and ſolemn Way of Proceedings in Courts of Juſtice; where the Evidence for Facts is ſtill enquir'd into and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd from Eye and Ear-Witneſſes, or from the authentick Records themſelves produc'd in Court;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0267201100:4"/>
where the Judges determine of thoſe Facts intirely by that original Evidence; and where all that the Pleaders <hi>allege</hi> about thoſe Facts goes for nothing, any farther than it is thus <hi>proved.</hi> Now, what was the Doctrine of our Bleſſed Saviour and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, or what was the Chriſtian Faith in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is certainly at this Day an ancient Fact; and no otherwiſe to be now known but by ancient Evidence, primitive Witneſſes, and original Records ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining. To theſe therefore do I ſolemnly Appeal in the preſent Queſtion; and by theſe and theſe only do I reſolve to be determin'd therein. And this Method is ſo evidently fair and reaſonable, that I cannot but hope that your Lordſhip and all equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Enquirers will alſo approve of it, and be willing to be determin'd by it. Nor do I mean this with Regard to the preſent Doctrine, or the real and ſtrict <hi>Coeternity</hi> of the Son and Holy Spirit to the Father only; but with Regard to all the like controverted Points in Chriſtianity alſo: which can, I think, be no other way ſo authentickly, ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactorily, and ſo peaceably determined among Chriſtians as by this Procedure; eſpecially while in this Method the Meaning of doubtful Words and Phraſes are to be ſtated no otherwiſe than by the ancient Uſe of the ſame; and no modern Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Evaſions unſupported by Antiquity, will be admitted: and where no later Tranſlations will be of Weight, any farther than they are ſupported by the primary Senſe of the Original, in the Ages wherein the Books themſelves were written.</p>
            <p>I therefore, upon this Occaſion, in the moſt, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and open Manner, in the Behalf of my ſelf and of others of my Opinion, as to the Points now in Diſpute among us, do, before your Lordſhip, and before the Chriſtian World, invite all the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and learned <hi>Athanaſians</hi> to come into this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal; I mean, that omitting all the Paſſions, the Tricks, the Subtilties, the Diſtinctions and Evaſions of the Pleaders or <hi>Diſputers of this World,</hi> they will join with us in a calm, a fair, an authentick, a friendly, and a Chriſtian Examination of theſe Points in the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0267201100:5"/>
Bible and primitive Antiquity; and in drawing up, after ſuch an Examination, an upright, impartial, and full Collection of all the ancient Texts and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies, before the Days of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> which concern the ſame; to be by joint Conſent laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the World; with the bare ſumming up the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence on both Sides, as the Judges themſelves do in their Courts, without any other Comments or Colours of our own whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Thus, for Example, the whole Chriſtian Church, My Lord, did ever, and does ſtill unanimouſly own, that there is but <hi>One,</hi> Eternal, Omnipotent, Inviſible, and Almighty <hi>God</hi>; the original Cauſe and Creator of all other Beings: While many of the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> now affirm, that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, taken together, are that <hi>One God</hi>; and we, on the other Side, aſſert that God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and He alone, is that <hi>One God.</hi> Here, My Lord, we inſiſt, that the preſent <hi>Trinitarians</hi> may produce all thoſe original Texts of Scripture, all thoſe ancient Creeds, and all thoſe primitive Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, which affirm the former: and we will be oblig'd to produce, in the ſame Manner, all thoſe original Texts of Scripture, all thoſe ancient Creeds, and all thoſe primitive Teſtimonies which affirm the latter: And this is deſir'd as to both Sides, without the Admiſſion of any novel Diſtinctions, Evaſions, or Inferences whatſoever: that ſo Chriſtian People may have the Cauſe wholly before them, and may be enabled to determine ſairly and impartially on which Side the <hi>ſuperior Evidence</hi> appears to be; by which ſuperior Evidence all certainly ought to be guided in ſuch Matters. And the like Procedure I would recommend in all parallel Caſes whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
            <p>And indeed, My Lord, this ſeems to me to be the only honeſt and Chriſtian Method of diſentang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling theſe and the like Points from the Sophiſtry of captious Arguments, Replies, and Rejoinders, with which the Writers of Controverſy do on all Sides, more or leſs, perplex and puzzle, but not properly ſatisfy their Readers. And this Method,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0267201100:6"/>
I confeſs, My Lord, I have had principally in my Eye from the very Beginning of my Concern in the preſent Controverſy; tho' the Pamphlets written againſt me have ſometimes turn'd me from that my main Deſign, and, as it were, forc'd me, in ſome Degree, to comply with the common Method. I now therefore, My Lord, intend to reaſſume what I at firſt propos'd to my ſelf; and, as I have lately, which Your Lordſhip will ſee by the enclos'd, laid the State of the Old Chriſtian Doxologies before the World, exactly as I found it in the New Teſtament, and in the moſt early Antiquity; without pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, from any Reaſonings of my own, to introduce one ſingle Form, different from what I there found upon Record; So do I here deſign to lay before Your Lordſhip and the World, with equal Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, what I meet with in the firſt Ages concerning this important Point of the ſtrict <hi>Coeternity</hi> of the Son and Holy Spirit to the Father. I ſay, the ſtrict <hi>Coeternity</hi> only; for as to the Preexiſtence of our Saviour before all <hi>Time,</hi> and all <hi>Ages,</hi> even thoſe the Antients called <hi>Eternal Times,</hi> with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Tit. I. 2.</note> or <hi>before the World</hi> with all its Creatures and Ages <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,</hi> as our Verſion well renders that Paſſage, this is not the Queſtion. <note place="margin">Heb. I. 2.</note> It being allowed on both Sides that this World, with all its Creatures and Ages whatſoever, were <hi>made,</hi> under the Father, by the Son; who muſt therefore, of Neceſſity, be before the ſame, without the leaſt Conſequence to be thence deduc'd that he was therefore <hi>really eternal,</hi> or truly <hi>coeternal</hi> with his Father.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>N.B.</hi> I do not quote the ſmaller Epiſtles of <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> nor ſome pretended Paſſages out of <hi>Hippolytus, Dionyſius Alexandrinus, &amp;c.</hi> they being liable to too many Objections as to their Genuineneſs, to bear any Weight in this or any ſuch Controverſy what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
            <p>I begin with thoſe Texts of Scripture which Your Lordſhip's Chaplain, Mr. <hi>Seaton,</hi> has cited for the <hi>Eternity of the Son:</hi> and ſhall ſet them down both as they ſtand in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bible, and as they more authentickly appear in the Septuagint Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0267201100:7"/>
which alone was made Use of by Chriſt and his Apoſtles. To which I ſhall add what other Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages occur in the Bible or earlieſt Antiquity, that ſeem moſt to favour the ſame Eternity, till the very Days of <hi>Athanaſius.</hi>

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0267201100:23"/>

We own but One God, who is alone Unbegotten, who is alone E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, who is alone without Beginning, who is alone the true God, who alone has Immortality, who alone is Wiſe, who alone is Good, who alone is the Potentate, who is the Judge, the Orderer and Diſpoſer of all Things: Immutable and Unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable, Righteous and Good, the God of the Law and the Prophets, and of the new Covenant; who begat his only begotten Son before the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan: By whom he made the Ages and the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe. Begat him, we mean, not in Appearance only, but Reality; giving him his Subſiſtence by his own Will; the Immutable, and Unalterable, and Perfect Creature of God, but not as one of the ordinary Creatures: A Being begotten by him, but not as one of the ordinary Beings which were begotten. Not that this Being begotten was an Emanation, as was the Doctrine of <hi>Valentinus</hi>; nor, as <hi>Manichaeus</hi> ſuppos'd, is the Being begotten a Conſubſtantial Part of the Father: Nor, as <hi>Sabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> who divided the Unity, and call'd him both Son and Father: Nor, as <hi>Hieraeas,</hi> Light from a Light, or as one Lamp divided into two: Nor, as one that before was, yet afterward was begotten, or created into a Son. As even you your ſelf, Bleſſed Father, in the midſt of the Church, and in the Aſſembly of the Clergy, have frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected thoſe who introduc'd theſe Opinions. But, as we ſay, that he was Created by the Will of God before Time, and before the World began; and that he receiv'd his Life, and his Being, and all his Glory from the Father. For the Father, when he made him Heir of all Things, did not deprive himſelf of any Thing which he has in himſelf, without being begotten. For He is the Fountain of all Things. Wherefore there are three Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and God himſelf, who is the Cauſe of all Things, is alone without Beginning. But the Son being begotten by the Father before Time, and created and founded before the World began, was not before he was begotten; but he alone, as
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0267201100:24"/>
begotten before Time by the Father, did really ſubſiſt; for he is not eternal, or co-eternal, or unbegotten as the Father is; nor has he his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence together with the Father, as ſome ſay; who after a ſort introduce two unbegotten Principles; but God is ſo before all Things as the only Being, and the Beginning of all Things. <hi>Wherefore he is before his Son, as we have learn'd from you, when you have preach'd in the midſt of the Church.</hi> In as much, therefore, as he has his Being, and all his Glory, and his Life from God; and all Things are deliver'd to him, thence is God his Origin and Governor; for he governs him as his God, and as being <hi>Prior</hi> to him. But if that Expreſſion, <hi>From him</hi>; and that, <hi>From the Womb</hi>; and that, <hi>I came out from the Father, and come</hi>; are underſtood as implying his being a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantial Part of him, as an Emanation; the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is a compound Being, capable of Diviſion, and Mutable; and, indeed, according to them, a Body: And ſo, as far as their Notions extend, the Incorporeal God is liable to Corporeal Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</p>

               <note place="margin">Heb. i. 2.</note> or that firſt Conſtitution of Things which was made or ordain'd by him under the Father: That he was to be the <hi>Father of the future Age,</hi> or <hi>World to come,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Heb. ii. 5.</note> which we call the <hi>laſt Age,</hi> or <hi>Days of the Meſſiah</hi>: That his Origin was <hi>of Old, from the Beginning of the World:</hi> That he <hi>was</hi> in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and was <hi>with God</hi> his Father in the very <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning</hi> of Things; nay, had <hi>Glory with his Father before the World was:</hi> That he was <hi>before all Things</hi>; that he was the <hi>firſt,</hi> and will be the <hi>laſt:</hi> That he was <hi>Alpha,</hi> and will be <hi>Omega:</hi> And that ſome of theſe Expreſſions are the ſame, or very like to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0267201100:26"/>
thoſe, by which the abſolute Eternity of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is in other Places ſuppos'd to be expreſs'd; which laſt Obſervation, however, is only here taken for granted, without Proof: It no Way ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing that the ſacred Writers meddle, beyond our Faculties, with any ſuch abſolute Eternity, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>a parte ante,</hi> or <hi>a parte poſt,</hi> as the School-men have ſince done; and yet without the Proof of that Point all this Evidence is very inconſiderable.</p>
            <p>It muſt alſo be remembred, that the ancient Chriſtians ever allow'd that the Expreſſions in the Old Teſtament, concerning the inviſible Father, whenever there was a viſible Perſon appear'd, were ſpoken by the Son, as the <hi>Image of that inviſible God,</hi> or as repreſenting and perſonating the Father, as his Miniſter and Vicegerent among Men: and that they never look'd on them as true, in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Senſe, of the Son himſelf, but of the Father only: Nor did they ever draw ſuch Conſequences from thoſe Texts as do the Moderns.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Melchiſedek</hi> is, indeed, ſaid to have <hi>neither Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Days, nor End of Life,</hi> when he is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as a Type of Chriſt's earlieſt Origin and lateſt Duration; but this certainly without the leaſt Pretence to any proper Eternity of his at all. So that the known Books of the Old and New Teſtament, as underſtood before the Days of <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius,</hi> ſeem to have no proper Evidence at all for the real Eternity of the Son of God. As for <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycarp</hi>'s and <hi>Juſtin</hi>'s Expreſſions of Chriſt, that he is the <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

               </gap>, the <hi>eternal</hi> Prieſt, or High Prieſt, no wiſe Man will thence gather any Thing about the real Eternity of the Son, before he was an <hi>High Prieſt.</hi> The Author of the Recognitions also ſpeaks of the Eternity of the Son, and calls him the <hi>eternal Chriſt</hi>: But then, it is well known, that he did not thereby mean his real Co-eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>a parte ante,</hi> with his Father: Nay, it has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd already, that of all the Ancients he is the moſt expreſs for his being a Creature; and he therefore hereby rather gives us a Rule how we ought to explain ſuch Words in other ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0267201100:27"/>
while they ſeldom or never mean, by ſuch Expreſſions, more than from the Beginning of the World, or to the End of it. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> does, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſay not only that Chriſt was God's <hi>eternal Word,</hi> but that he was <hi>unmade,</hi> or, as I ſuppoſe he means, <hi>not made out of nothing,</hi> as he ſuppoſed Men to be; that he did <hi>always co-exiſt with God,</hi> and was <hi>ever with him</hi>; and avoided ſaying that God <hi>created him,</hi> which the reſt uſed freely to ſay in thoſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: All this makes it very probable that this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did believe the Eternity of the Son, in ſome Sort or other. But then, it muſt not be diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, that even <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> as we have ſeen, owns him a derived Being, produc'd by his Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all other Beings: Which ſeems hardly recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable to an abſolute Co-eternity: And that this Sort of Eternity of the <hi>Word,</hi> which we meet with in ſome ſuch Philoſophers of the ſecond, third, and fourth Century, is quite another Thing from the real <hi>Co-eternity of the Son</hi> under our preſent Conſideration: As is moſt obvious in the ancient Accounts of that Matter. Their Notion was plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this; that all other Beings were made out of nothing; but that the Son was in a ſubtile man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>in</hi> his Father, virtually, potentially, or, as his internal Word and Wiſdom from all Eternity; and that a little before the Creation, and not ſooner, this Word was, in an ineffable manner, begotten or created, out of his Subſtance, into a real ſubſiſting Being, or Perſon: So that the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies for this Sort of Eternity, which alone we find even till a good while after the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> it ſelf, are a Demonſtration that the <hi>real Co-eternity</hi> of the Son with the Father, or his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>eternal Generation,</hi> was then utterly unknown among Chriſtians. Nor does even this metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, this virtual, or potential, or internal Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Son ever appear in the ſacred Writings; in the ancient Creeds or Liturgies; or in any of the Apoſtolical Fathers. Whereby 'tis plain, that it is no Part of the Sacred, the Apoſtolical, or the Chriſtian Doctrine; and no more than a Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0267201100:28"/>
or Hypotheſis of ſome ancient Chriſtian Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopers. Whether <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, even in his younger Years, before he was throughly inſtructed in Chriſtianity, that Chriſt was really <hi>eternal,</hi> it is not certain: Becauſe the Epithet <hi>eternal</hi> in the former Paſſage cited from him does not always denote a real Eternity, and may belong to the Father and not to the Son; and if <hi>Clement</hi> did once call him the <hi>eternal Light</hi> in a Poem, the Latitude of ſuch Writings, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of that romantick Piece aſcrib'd to him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which this Phraſe is inſerted, ſtill more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbids us to draw any ſuch ſettled Concluſion from it: Eſpecially when he elſewhere moſt plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid, he was the <hi>firſt created Wiſdom of God</hi>; and in another Work, directly <hi>depreſs'd him into the Rank of a Creature</hi>; as we have already ſeen. So that unleſs we believe ſuch Authors had a Fancy that a common <hi>Creature,</hi> or the World it ſelf, might be <hi>co-eternal to its Creator,</hi> we muſt not quote them for the Son's proper Co-eternity to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

               </gap> The firſt of which does ſeldom or never ſignify a proper Eternity; the ſecond not always; and the third, and that alone, always does ſo; 'tis very remarkable that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Apoſtolical Fathers never, in this Caſe of the Antiquity of the Son, uſe any but the firſt; none of thoſe before the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> more than the firſt, and very rarely the ſecond; while <hi>Athanaſius</hi> and his Followers, and none before them, directly ventur'd on the third Way of Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and called the Son <hi>Co-eternal.</hi> Which how it cou'd happen, if the proper <hi>Co eternity</hi> of the Son to the Father were then all along the known Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſtianity, I do by no Means under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. Briefly, in the fourth Century we find this Co-eternity plainly aſſerted; we find obſcure In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timations about a ſubtile Sort of Eternity in the third and latter Part of the ſecond; but in the former Part of the ſecond, and the firſt Century we loſe all certain Footſteps of any Eternity whatſoever: Which Obſervation renders this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence for the <hi>Co-eternity,</hi> even tho' we had no oppoſite Evidence to weigh on the other Side, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding weak and precarious.</p>
            <p>But then, as to the original Evidence againſt this <hi>Co-eternity</hi> of the Son, and for his <hi>voluntary Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or <hi>Creation</hi> by the Power of the Father, before the World began, the Sum of it is as follows.</p>
            <p>That the Son was not an underiv'd, unorigina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, independent and, in that Senſe, an Eternal Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but truly derived from, and produced, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by the Father, is the unanimous Voice of all Chriſtian Antiquity, both in and after the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Age; and is not directly deny'd by any <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſian</hi> at this Day. Now, how a confeſſedly deriv'd, produc'd, and begotten Being; an Only-begotten
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0267201100:30"/>
Son, ſhould be really coeternal with his underiv'd, unbegotten, and neceſſarily-exiſting Author, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer, and Father, I cannot poſſibly underſtand.</p>
            <p>That the Son was alſo <hi>voluntarily begotten</hi> by the Power of the Father, we have the plain and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Teſtimonies of the Apoſtles themſelves in their Conſtitutions, of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> of the Author of the Recognitions of <hi>Clement,</hi> of <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> of <hi>Tatian,</hi> of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> of <hi>Novatian,</hi> of <hi>Lactantius,</hi> of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> and of the Presbyters and Deacons of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria</hi>; without the leaſt Syllable, that any one Chriſtian thought of his being deriv'd from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the Moderns pretend, by <hi>Neceſſity of Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That he was alſo <hi>created</hi> by God the Father, is alſo moſt evident in all Sacred and Chriſtian Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. This Doctrine begins from <hi>Solomon</hi> in the Old Teſtament, as explain'd by the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation; and is continued by the Son of <hi>Sirach,</hi> and <hi>Philo</hi> the Jew, to the Writers of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, <hi>Peter, Paul, John, Hermas</hi>; the Apoſtles in general, in their Conſtitutions; all theſe in the firſt Century: Thence it paſſes down to <hi>Ignatius,</hi> to the Author of the Recognitions of <hi>Clement,</hi> to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin Martyr, Melito, Tatian,</hi> and <hi>Athenagoras,</hi> in the ſecon'd Century: And from all theſe it comes down to <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Alexandria, Tertullian, Origen, Gregory</hi> of <hi>Neocoeſarea, Novatian, Cyprian, Dionyſius</hi> of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria, Theognoſtus,</hi> and <hi>Methodius,</hi> in the 3d Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury; to <hi>Lactantius</hi> and <hi>Euſebius,</hi> and to the <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian</hi> Presbyters and Deacons, nay, even to <hi>Athanaſius</hi> himſelf in the fourth Century; and this, ſo far as we know, without any one Perſon's excepting againſt the Word <hi>Created,</hi> as improper, 'till <hi>Athanaſius</hi>: without any one's aſſerting that the Son was <hi>uncreated,</hi> till he did it: and with the direct Aſſertion of ſeveral, that he was a <hi>Creature,</hi> a Being <hi>made</hi> by the Father; tho' vaſtly ſuperior to all other Creatures or Beings made by him.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>voluntary Generation</hi> or <hi>Creation</hi> of the Son, (for I take them to mean the ſame Thing) was a little before the Creation of the World alſo, is the only natural Import of almoſt all, and the direct Aſſertion of ſome of the Teſtimonies; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Contradiction of any one Chriſtian Writer
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0267201100:31"/>
alſo, that I know of, till the fourth Century, or the Days of <hi>Athanaſius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Body of the Church, even in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the fourth Century, nay, even at and ſome Years after the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> it ſelf, knew nothing of any real Eternity of the Son; nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd that he was a Being begotten or created by the Will and Power of God, a little before the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the World, is very plain from the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies here produc'd. So that 'tis hard to ſay what ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Evidence the real Trinitarians have gone up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when they have ſo long made the World believe that the Son is truly <hi>Coeternal</hi> with the Father; and this as a prime Article eſtabliſh'd at the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> nay, as a fundamental Doctrine of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity it ſelf; ſince, whatever Authority there may be for the <hi>potential</hi> or <hi>metaphyſick,</hi> there ſeems to be directly none at all for this <hi>real Coeternity,</hi> or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>eternal Generation,</hi> 'till a good while after the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> Nor would the great and learned <hi>Euſebius,</hi> when he wrote by the Direction of the Council of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and ſeveral Years after that of <hi>Nice,</hi> have ventur'd openly to charge <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus</hi> with Hereſy, for ſaying that Chriſt was <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>eternal,</hi> if that his Eternity had been the known De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> or indeed the known Doctrine of the Church, either in that or in the foregoing Ages of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>That this Coeternity of the Son is a very ſtrange Doctrine to ſuch as have the Unity of God for the Foundation of their Religion; ſuch as all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs, the Jews, and the Chriſtians ever had, will be granted by all. That therefore there was a great Occaſion for a clear and expreſs Declaration of this Eternity of the Son, if it were true, is very evident: while yet neither the Scriptures, nor the Apoſtolical Conſtitutions, nor any ancient Creeds whatſoever, have any one ſuch clear Declaration; nay, have many ſuch clear Declarations concerning One only true or eternal God, <note place="margin">Rom. I. 20 1 Tim. 1.17.</note> One only <hi>eternal Power and Godhead,</hi> One only <hi>King of Ages, or eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, immortal, inviſible, the only wiſe God,</hi> as ſuppoſes
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0267201100:32"/>
the contrary; eſpecially while they add to thoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations, that this One God is no other than the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Thus all the old Creeds or Confeſſions of Faith do begin with this as the firſt Doctrine of Chriſtianity, <hi>I believe in One God the Father</hi>; or as the Baptiſmal Creed itſelf expreſſes it, <note place="margin">Conſtitut. 7.41.</note> 
               <hi>I believe in One unbegotten Being, the only true God Almighty, the Father of Christ</hi>; while what they ſay of the Son has not the leaſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation of either his Coequality or Coeternity, but the contrary; which is particularly the Caſe of the original Creed beforemention'd, where the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle concerning the Son begins thus: <hi>I believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the only begotten Son of God, the Firſt-born of the whole Creation; who, before the Ages, was begotten by the good Pleaſure of the Father</hi>; which ſeems to me an authentick, a ſacred, and an undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Teſtimony againſt any real Coeternity of the Son to the Father.</p>
            <p>Nor indeed, My Lord, are the Expreſſions all along uſed in the foregoing Collection of Texts and Teſtimonies capable of any fair Senſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with this Coeternity, ſince many of them directly confute the ſame. Thus the Apoſtolical Conſtitutions affirm, That God the Father is <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally One only</hi>; or, <hi>The Only Eternal Being</hi>: That thoſe are Hereticks who ſay [as do the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> in Effect] that God is <hi>three,</hi> or <hi>manifold</hi>; or that there are <hi>three Gods, coeternal with one another.</hi> The Apoſtles <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> by calling Chriſt the <hi>Firſt-born of the whole Creation,</hi> and the <hi>Beginning of the Creation of God,</hi> do in the moſt plain, uſual, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Senſe of the Words, and as they were under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in the firſt Ages; [eſpecially, if we conſider the Alluſion theſe Paſſages bear to the Text in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> as then underſtood by all, <hi>The Lord crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me, the Beginning of his Ways</hi>] directly affirm that Chriſt was <hi>the firſt Being God created.</hi> The Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> directly affirms, that God <hi>made</hi> Chriſt; which in the fourth Century was reckon'd ſo hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodox, that this Epiſtle was in ſome Places ſeldom read in publick, and that partly out of the Dread of ſuch an Expreſſion; as <hi>Philaſtrius</hi> aſſures us.<note place="margin">De Haeret.

profeſs that Chriſt was a <hi>Creature,</hi> or a <hi>Being made</hi> by God. <hi>Novatian</hi> alſo, or the acute but unknown Author of the Book concerning the <hi>Trinity,</hi> affirms that God the Father is the <hi>only eternal God,</hi> to whom no other Being can be ſo much as compar'd; that the Son was then begotten when <hi>it pleaſed the Father</hi>; who, and who alone, was <hi>prior</hi> to him; and that as a neceſſary Conſequence from his being his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Dionyſius</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> directly affirms Chriſt to have been a <hi>Creature</hi>; and ſuppoſes not only a Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the Subſiſtences of the Father and Son, but a Diverſity of <hi>Subſtance,</hi> an Inferiority of <hi>Power,</hi> and a Difference of <hi>Glory</hi>; ſo that he, as well as many others, ſeems not to have had ſo much as a Notion of a metaphyſick Eternity. <hi>Theognoſtus</hi> alſo declar'd, that the Son was a <hi>Creature.

            </p>
            <p>And here, My Lord, give me Leave to wiſh, heartily to wiſh, that theſe ancient Texts and Teſtimonies, thus plainly produc'd before you in this one important Article, might ſo far influence Your Lordſhip, as to engage you to endeavour that the ſame Method might be taken in the other Branches of this and all other the like Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies among Chriſtians: That Your Lordſhip, who has had long ſo conſiderable a Hand in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Management of Affairs, Sacred and Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical, as well as Temporal and Civil, in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; might be a happy Means of bringing all the Parts of our old genuine Chriſtianity to ſuch a fair, open, and impartial Examination, as I have here propos'd, and endeavour'd to exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy in theſe Papers; that ſo, Party, Faction, and Prejudice laid aſide, all honeſt and ſober Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians might, in a peaceable Manner, unite toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into ſuch <hi>Societies, for promoting Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,</hi>

            <p>It has hitherto been Your Lordſhip's great Glory to have ſupported and encourag'd that Church of <hi>England</hi> in which you was educated; and the World has great Reaſon to believe, by your dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly religious Attendance on the Church's Liturgy at Home; as well as by your alike devout week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Attendance on the ſame publick Service at Church; either of which, in our Age, I am ſorry to ſay it, is but too uncommon in Perſons of your Lordſhip's Quality; that you are in earneſt in ſuch your Support and Encouragement thereof; or that you do it becauſe you believe this Church to be truly agreeable to the Primitive State of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. Would it not therefore, My Lord, be ſtill more highly honourable for your Lordſhip, to be a Means of making a more careful Review of our Doctrine, Worſhip, Practice, and Diſcipline? That ſo the ſame Church, which has long been the Glory and Bulwark of the Proteſtant Religion, even in it's preſent imperfect State, may firſt of all the reſt be exactly conform'd to the Perfection of the Chriſtian Settlement; and ſo may be the great Exemplar and Pattern of all the other Churches, as they become gradually ſenſible of the Neceſſity of ſuch a farther Reformation?
