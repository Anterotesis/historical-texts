            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I firmly adhere to the Opinion of the Learned Dr. <hi>Willis,</hi> who with great reaſon, places the Origine of this Diſeaſe among the effects of the <hi>Brain</hi> and the <hi>Genus Nervoſum,</hi> alledging, that certain <hi>Recrements</hi> of the <hi>Nervous</hi> Humour, falling from the Brain by the <hi>Nerves,</hi> and paſſing thence into the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentry</hi> and other <hi>Foldings</hi> of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> are there amaſs'd and heaped together, which if they are ſo groſs, thick and <hi>viſcous,</hi> that they cannot be received and ſent away by the <hi>Lymphaducts,</hi> or diſtill'd out into the Cavities of the <hi>Inteſtines,</hi> by the ſmall Branches of the Veſſels, then <hi>Stagnating</hi> and being heaped together by degrees into thoſe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0198200500:16"/>Parts, they ariſe at length to an <hi>irritative</hi> plenitude: And afterward that Matter becoming more degenerate, and more offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive by <hi>Stagnation,</hi> and growing turged on ſome occaſion; or of its own accord or elſe fermenting with the <hi>Salino-fix'd Humour,</hi> ſent thither from the <hi>Blood,</hi> will torture the Patient with very troubleſome and painful <hi>Corrugations</hi> in the Branches of the <hi>Nerves</hi> and Nervous <hi>Fibres,</hi> with which the <hi>Meſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery</hi> is innumerably furniſh'd: Which ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of them, do ſeldom or never ceaſe till the <hi>fermenting Matter</hi> is either diſcuſs'd, or <hi>expreſs'd</hi> into the Cavities of the Inteſtines, or at length by Care and the Application of proper Medicines, they are utterly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued.</p>

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0198200500:17"/>by ſome Men falſly imputed to have its reſidence in the Gut <hi>Colon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Michael Etmuller,</hi> late Profeſſor of Phyſick in the Univerſity of <hi>Leiptſick,</hi> ſays, Cholick Pains and Gripings in the great Guts, are chiefly felt in the <hi>Colon,</hi> eſpecially in that part of it towards the circumference of the Belly, upon the Left-ſide, where 'tis ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and incurvated, and conſequently more liable to the blaſt and ſhocks of Wind, and more apt to ſtop the Circulation of the Excrements, and cauſe their Swelling up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a hard or ſoft <hi>Tumor.</hi> This Pain and Tumor is frequently imputed to the <hi>Spleen,</hi> but erroneouſly; for the <hi>Colon,</hi> ſays he, is its uſual and proper Seat; and ſometimes it veers about to the Right-ſide of the Belly, upon the outermoſt Circumference, where the ſame <hi>Colon</hi> purſues its Courſe.</p>
            <p>Sometimes theſe Pains reach only the Small Guts, and then their Station is about the <hi>Navel</hi> and Centre of the Belly, and are much more violent than thoſe in the Great Guts; if they range not beyond the <hi>Duodenum,</hi> or the beginning of the <hi>Jejunum,</hi> they are felt in the <hi>Loins,</hi> and are often mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken for <hi>Nephritick</hi> Pains, or thoſe cauſed by the Convulſion of the <hi>Meſenterick</hi> Nerves, or Tumors, or Ulcers in the <hi>Pancreas.</hi> I dare not ſay any of theſe Opinions are He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terodox, becauſe ſometime or other Pains do poſſeſs all the Parts above mention'd.</p>
            <p>However, for very good Reaſons grounded upon many Experiments in Anatomy, I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here chiefly to Doctor <hi>Willis,</hi> who ſays, The Part in Human Bodies <hi>primarily</hi> affected in the Cholick, is the <hi>Meſentery,</hi> and its Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous <hi>Foldings</hi> under the Navel, which cauſes
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0198200500:18"/>cruel Pain, as if a Stake was ſtuck there, or a Piercer were making a Hole: Beſides, round about, almoſt in the whole <hi>Abdomen,</hi> by reaſon of the <hi>Inteſtines</hi> being <hi>variouſly</hi> drawn forward and backward, at the ſame time in different Places, wandring Pains ſhoot this way and that way; and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Fibres</hi> being diſcompoſed or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, as well in thoſe Parts as in the <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary</hi> Veſſels, the Belly is in a manner al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways bound, and there follows ſometimes a ſupperſſion of Urine, or very little is made. Beſides, the <hi>Duodenum</hi> the Gall Bladder with its Channels and the bottom of the Stomach being affected with a <hi>Cramp,</hi> and their <hi>Fibres</hi> being drawn upward, a frequent Vomiting with a copious caſting up Matter of Yellow or Greeniſh colour often happens during the Fit.</p>
            <p>In a Fit of the Cholick, alſo beſides Pains of the Belly, there are likewiſe violent Pains of the <hi>Loins,</hi> raging in the 1ower parts of the <hi>Back,</hi> which certainly cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the <hi>irritation of any Inteſtine;</hi> but its eaſy to conceive they may ariſe from a <hi>Morbific</hi> Cauſe lodg'd in the <hi>Meſentery:</hi> For inaſmuch as ſeveral conſiderable <hi>Nerves</hi> of the Loins enter into the great <hi>Nervous fold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of the <hi>Meſentery;</hi> ſo from hence, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly painful Convulſions are conveyed by <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> from one Part to another; but its alſo probable, that certain <hi>Recrements</hi> of the Back likewiſe, and of the Loins, are derived into the <hi>Meſentery</hi> by this Paſſage, and that in ſome ſort, for this reaſon, <hi>Scorbutical</hi> Perſons are ſo very obnoxious to Gripes of the Belly, and Looſeneſs that attends it, which confirms me in the Opinion that the Nervous <hi>Flexus</hi>

            <p>The general method for the Cure of this Diſeaſe, is, firſt to give preſent Eaſe in the <hi>Paroxiſms,</hi> and then proceed to a Cure. To accompliſh both theſe <hi>Intentions,</hi> 'tis uſual in the firſt place to apply ſtinking and ſtrong ſmelling things to the Noſtrils, the <hi>Effluvia</hi>'s of which, repreſs and reduce to order the Spirits which are grown too <hi>Wild,</hi> and apt to make <hi>exorbitant</hi> efforts; nay, and diſcuſs their <hi>Heterogeneous</hi> combination, and often wholly exterminate it. <hi>Aſſa Faetida, Caſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reum, Galbanum,</hi> tyed in a fine Cloth and held to the Noſtrils are proper; alſo <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges</hi> Feathers, or old <hi>Shoes</hi> burnt, or <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur</hi> kindled; alſo the <hi>Spirit and Oil of Soot and Harts-horn</hi> often give Eaſe; but the chief Indication in this Diſeaſe, is to <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> the Blood which is the fountain of the Spirits; which being done, the invigorated Spirits can preſerve that order which is agreeable to the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of the whole Body, and the particular Parts. And therefore when the <hi>Ataxy</hi> of the Spirits has vitiated the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours by long continuance, you muſt firſt <hi>leſſen</hi> the Humours ſo corrupted, by <hi>bleeding</hi> and <hi>Purging</hi> if the Patient has ſufficient strength, before you endeavour to invigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>The Third, and which I take to be the true Cauſe of the <hi>Caeliack Cholick,</hi> is, the Obſtruction of the <hi>Meſenteraick</hi> Veins which hinder the paſſage of the <hi>Chyle</hi> to the <hi>Liver,</hi> or the Obſtruction of the <hi>Glandules</hi> of the <hi>Meſentery,</hi> and therefore muſt of neceſſity be ejected by the Belly.

'Tis eaſily diſcover'd whether the Diſeaſe came by ſome violent Medicine, Poiſon, or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive Dyet.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Internal</hi> Cauſes are known by the <hi>Quality</hi> of the Humours that are ejected.

            <p>In the <hi>Beginning</hi> of the Cure, you ought to aſſiſt <hi>Evacuations</hi> with gentle, cooling, and cleanſing Clyſters, eſpecially <hi>Milk</hi> Clyſters,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0198200500:73"/>with <hi>Venice Treacle,</hi> or <hi>Diaſcordium</hi> diſſolved in them are always uſeful. It's proper to <hi>breathe</hi> a Vein, to cool the burnt and boiled Blood, but let it be done with Diſcretion, Twice or Thrice, if the Strength be not impaired by the Firſt. Endeavour to qualify the ſharpneſs of the Humours after this manner. <hi>Waters of Plantane, Purſlane and Mint of each two Ounces: Syrup of Quinces, and dried Roſes, of each one Ounce; Syrup of Vinegary, half an Ounce, mix them, and diſſolve therein two Scruples of Theriack Andromachi, and ſix Drops of Oil of Vitriol:</hi> Give now and then a Spoonful. But if the Patient has ſome <hi>Eaſe,</hi> and if the Symptoms abate or diſappear, take great care that they dont <hi>ſuddenly</hi> return, to your Amazement and the Deſtruction of the Patient, as it ſometimes happens <hi>unforeſeen</hi> in this Caſe. Therefore Nouriſh him and Strengthen his Stomach, ſays moſt of our Eminent Phyſicians, with a Reſtoring <hi>Opiate,</hi> compounded in or after this Method. <hi>Gelly of Harts-Horn made with Canary Wine, four Ounces, Conſerve of Roſes, Burrage, Bugloſs and Clove Gilly-Flowers, of each one Ounce: Confectio Alkermes, half an Ounce, Citron Bark and Nutmegs, Candied, of each three Drams; Eſſence of Cloves, Mace, Nutmegs and Cinamon, of each three Drops, and with the Syrup of Clove Gilly-Flowers make On Opiate;</hi> of which muſt be taken the quantity of a Hazle Nut or more, Mornings and Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
