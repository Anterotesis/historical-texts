            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>MY Muſe choſe to make this Univerſal Addreſs, hoping, among the numerous Crowd, to find ſome Souls Great enough to protect her againſt the Carping Malice of the Vulgar World; who think it a proof of their Senſe, to diſlike every thing that is writ by Women. I was the more induc'd to this General Application, from the Uſage I have met on all ſides.</p>
            <p>A Play ſecretly introduc'd to the Houſe, whilſt the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor remains unknown, is approv'd by every Body: The Actors cry it up, and are in expectation of a great Run; the Bookſeller of a Second Edition, and the Scribler of a Sixth Night: But if by chance the Plot's diſcover'd, and the Brat found Fatherleſs, immediately it flags in the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe that extoll'd it before, and the Bookſeller falls in his Price, with this Reaſon only, <hi>It is a Woman's.</hi> Thus they alter their Judgment, by the Eſteem they have for the Author, tho' the Play is ſtill the ſame. They ne'er re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect, that we have had ſome Male-Productions of this kind, void of Plot and Wit, and full as inſipid as ever a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's of us all.</p>
            <p>I can't forbear inſerting a Story which my Bookſeller, that printed my <hi>Gameſter,</hi> told me, of a Spark that had ſeen my <hi>Gameſter</hi> three or four times, and lik'd it extremely: Having bought one of the Books, ask'd who the Author was; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing told, a Woman, threw down the Book, and put up his Money, ſaying, he had ſpent too much after it already, and was ſure if the Town had known that, it wou'd never have run ten days. No doubt this was a Wit in his own Eyes. It is ſuch as theſe that rob us of that which inſpires the Poet, Praiſe. And it is ſuch as theſe made him that Printed my Comedy call'd, <hi>Love's Contrivance;</hi> or, <hi>Medin</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:0048401500:3"/>
               <hi>cin Malgre lui,</hi> put two Letters of a wrong Name to it; which tho' it was the height of Injuſtice to me, yet his impoſing on the Town turn'd to account with him; and thus paſſing for a Man's, it has been play'd at leaſt a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times.</p>
            <p>And why this Wrath againſt the Womens Works? Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you'll anſwer, becauſe they meddle with things out of their Sphere: But I ſay, no; for ſince the Poet is born, why not a Woman as well as a Man? Not that I wou'd derogate from thoſe great Men who have a Genius, and Learning to improve that Genius: I only object againſt thoſe ill-natur'd Criticks, who wanting both, think they have a ſufficient claim to Senſe, by railing at what they don't underſtand. Some have arm'd themſelves with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution not to like the Play they paid to ſee; and if in ſpite of Spleen they have been pleas'd againſt their Will, have maliciouſly reported it was none of mine, but given me by ſome Gentleman: Nay, even my own Sex, which ſhou'd aſſert our Prerogative againſt ſuch Detractors, are often backward to encourage a Female Pen.</p>
            <p>Wou'd theſe profeſt Enemies but conſider what Examples we have had of Women that excell'd in all Arts; in Muſick, Painting, Poetry; alſo in War: Nay, to our immortal Praiſe, what Empreſſes and Queens have fill'd the World? What cannot <hi>England</hi> boaſt from Women? The mighty <hi>Romans</hi> felt the Power of <hi>Boadicea</hi>'s Arm; <hi>Eliza</hi> made <hi>Spain</hi> trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but <hi>ANN,</hi> the greateſt of the Three, has ſhook the Man that aim'd at Univerſal Sway. After naming this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, the Glory of our Sex, ſure none will ſpitefully cavil at the following Scenes, purely becauſe a Woman writ'em. This I dare venture to ſay in their behalf, there is a Plot and Story in them, I hope will entertain the Reader; which is the utmoſt Ambition of,</p>

                  <p>Yes, Sir, I have lately made ſome moral Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the Uncertainty of worldly Pleaſures.

                  <p>You brought me into the Danger; I came wounded off, and have no hopes of Cure, but from your roving Temper. You weigh the Sex alike, and without a Pang may give me leave to try my Fortune with her.</p>

                  <p>Faith, 'tis a kind of intricate Story, but you muſt be ſatisfied. I have been bred a Soldier of Fortune, and am to this Day ignorant who my Parents were.

expreſs'd a thouſand Thanks. The old Man grew In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive, who I was, and whence I came. I frankly told him the Story of my Life: He ſtood amaz'd, and ask'd me fifty Queſtions, and ſeem'd ſurpriz'd at every Anſwer.</p>

                  <speaker>Bel.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, he has ever ſince been mighty fond of me, and forc'd Money upon me, which I could ſcarcely make him take my Note for.</p>

                  <p>Quite contrary: His generous Carriage has oblig'd me to ſwear to him, never to attempt to marry her, if ſhe ſhould conſent without his leave, which he ſeems ſtill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe to.

                  <p>That's another Injunction of the old Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's, to procure the Writings of an Eſtate out of her Hands, that her Husband cheated a Relation of his of.
