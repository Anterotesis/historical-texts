            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

PARLIAMENT.</head>
            <head type="sub">In a LETTER to a Friend in the Country.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOUR laſt Letter expreſſes your great Concerns and Fears about the Deſign now on foot for the Alteration of the <hi>Act for the frequent Meeting and Calling of Parliaments</hi> in one Particular, that is, the Changing the <hi>Term</hi> for <hi>Elections</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> from <hi>three</hi> to <hi>more</hi> Years; and at the ſame time gives me an Account of the ſeveral <hi>Objections,</hi> which make the greateſt Noiſe around you upon that Subject. The ſame <hi>Fears,</hi> and the ſame <hi>Objections,</hi> I find to be very common, and very warmly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated in all Converſations here in Town.</p>
            <p>For my ſelf, I acknowledge that it is with <hi>me,</hi> in <hi>this</hi> Caſe, as it is in many others of Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; the <hi>firſt Surprize</hi> gave me the like <hi>Uneaſineſs</hi> to what you expreſs: But I am very well ſatisfied, that the moſt likely Way to cure that Uneaſineſs, is, to debate the Matter as Friends; and to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, Whether that <hi>Surprize</hi> be the Force of <hi>meer Prejudice,</hi> or of good Judgment. And for this, I am very ſure, I am in one Reſpect, at leaſt, well qualified, That as to my own private Advantage, or Intereſt, it is not of the leaſt Importance to me, Whether the <hi>Parliament</hi> may, with the Conſent of the <hi>King,</hi> ſit <hi>three</hi> Years, or <hi>ſeven</hi> Years, or <hi>twenty</hi> Years. I have no Deſigns, nor Views; no <hi>Piques,</hi> nor <hi>Reſentments;</hi> to incline me one way or other: And therefore, if you will put your ſelf into the ſame <hi>Poſture</hi> of Mind, we will, if you pleaſe, enter upon this Subject.</p>
            <p>In all <hi>Debates</hi> of this Nature, there are <hi>Two</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Points, which will comprehend under them all other Particulars. The <hi>One</hi> is, Whether the Thing propoſed be <hi>lawful,</hi> with regard to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of our Conſtitution? The <hi>Other</hi> is, Whether it be <hi>expedient,</hi> or <hi>uſeful,</hi> to the Good Ends which ought always to be in the View of thoſe who make Laws?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lawfulneſs</hi> of the Thing can't be denied by any Perſons, tho' never ſo great Enemies to the doing it. Nor do I find, amongſt all the <hi>Topicks</hi> employed againſt it, that any thing of Moment is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> againſt the Right or Authority of the <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Legiſlature</hi> to do it. It is no more <hi>a Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental</hi> of our <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> That a <hi>New Parliament</hi> muſt be ſummon'd every <hi>three Years,</hi> than at any other Interval. It is equally juſt, as far as <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> are concern'd, for the <hi>King, Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> to ſix it for <hi>one</hi> Term, as for <hi>another:</hi> And if it were not out of their <hi>Right</hi> to make that <hi>Great Alteration,</hi> which fix'd it for <hi>three</hi> Years, it certainly cannot be out of their <hi>Right</hi> to make a much leſs <hi>Alteration,</hi> by fixing it once more to another Term.</p>
            <p>As to the Senſe and Mind of the Electors, the Truth of the Matter is this: They are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to have no other View in their Choice of Perſons, than to ſend ſuch to Parliament as they think beſt qualified, by their Eſtates, Wiſdom and Integrity, to do whatever is to be done in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, without regard to the Time of their Sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting there. And there is no other End in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting Repreſentatives, but that they, from Time to Time, may make, and alter Laws, in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as beſt to conſult and promote the Good of the whole Community: The very Election is, and muſt be ſuppoſed to impower the Elected Perſons, faithfully, and impartially, to do every Thing that is neceſſary, or expedient, for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and Eſtabliſhment of the Common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, whether it falls in with the Humours or Opinions of the Electors, or not. This brings us to the only Point to be conſider'd, when any <hi>Alteration</hi> of a former <hi>Changeable Law</hi> is propoſed; and that is, Whether, (all Things conſider'd,) it be <hi>Expedient</hi> and <hi>Uſeful?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And of this, as far as the Time paſt is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, <hi>Experience</hi> is the beſt Judge. When a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0084401700:2"/>
               <hi>Law</hi> hath been long tried, and the <hi>Conſequences</hi> and <hi>Effects</hi> of it in a Nation, have been many Years open and ſenſible, it requires but little Thought to judge, whether it be beſt to continue it in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Reſpect, as it is, or to model it anew. And now, if you pleaſe, we will conſider the <hi>Effect</hi> the <hi>Triennial Elections</hi> have had amongſt our ſelves at <hi>Home;</hi> and then it will be proper to think of the <hi>Effect</hi> they have had, and ſtill muſt naturally have, <hi>Abroad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At <hi>Home,</hi> the leaſt Evil is, that the <hi>Tempers</hi> and <hi>Spirits</hi> of Men are put into a <hi>Fermen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> and boil'd up into a <hi>Rage,</hi> which never is cooled, becauſe the Returns, at which this <hi>Rage</hi> is uſeful to ſome Perſons or other, are ſo <hi>quick,</hi> that it is not <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> in ſuch Men to <hi>let</hi> it ceaſe; nor perhaps poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for them to <hi>make</hi> it ceaſe, even if they were willing to do ſo. <hi>Riots, Tumults, Mutual Abuſes, odious Nick-Names, Perſonal Affronts,</hi> are kept alive and warm, from <hi>Three</hi> Year to <hi>Three</hi> Year, by Men of Deſign and Dexterity in the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of other Men's <hi>Paſſions;</hi> improved and heighten'd by ſuch <hi>quick Returns:</hi> Theſe are what we ſee and feel of the <hi>Effects</hi> of it upon the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of a Nation, that if ever it is ruined, can be ruined by nothing but its divided Affections and Intereſts.</p>
            <p>Beſides this, there could not be contrived a Method more effectual to the Debauchery of the Subject's <hi>Morals,</hi> not only in <hi>one,</hi> but in <hi>all,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, than <hi>this</hi> hath proved. <hi>Bribery,</hi> known and open, (without a Remedy) which ſuppoſeth a Corruption of Mind, and naturally leads to an Inſenſibility to every thing Great and Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and by Degrees, to a perfect Diſregard to every thing Sacred and Uſeful. A Scene of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Intemperance encouraged and paid for in many Places, for fear <hi>Friendſhip</hi> ſhould cool, if it be not kept hot by ſuch Methods.—And the Crimes that often accompany <hi>this,</hi> need not be mentioned. The leaſt is a General Diſpoſition in Men to leave the Thoughts of Diligence and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry in their Buſineſs, for the more agreeable Entertainments of Idleneſs, and a luxurious Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary.</p>
            <p>I do not ſuppoſe or argue that this <hi>Alteration</hi> of the <hi>Term</hi> will put a full Stop to this Corruption of <hi>Morals,</hi> either as to <hi>Bribery,</hi> or to the other Inſtances named. But it is certain that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns being not ſo quick, the Tempers of Men muſt, in the Nature of Things, become much more eaſy to one another by Degrees; which is itſelf an Advantage greatly to be valued. It is certain, that the <hi>Scent</hi> of <hi>Bribery</hi> cannot be ſo ſtrong, nor the Avowal of it ſo conſtant, when there is ſuch an Intermiſſion. And, as for that never-ceaſing Current of <hi>Debauchery,</hi> requiſite for ſo frequent Elections, it muſt be this way inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted; and, in a good Degree, broken into. The Crimes often accompanying it muſt diminiſh: And the <hi>Men,</hi> brought up to laborious Callings, muſt exchange their <hi>Idleneſs</hi> for Induſtry; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come much more uſeful to their Families and the <hi>Publick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I mention not the Ruin both of the Eſtates and Morals of <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> ſo frequently <hi>Candidates</hi> at our Elections: They know beſt how well they can bear ſuch Evils; and whether it tends to make themſelves better <hi>Patriots</hi> to their Country, or better Fathers to their own Families, that they are to make their Way by ſo quick Returns of <hi>Bribery</hi> and <hi>Corruption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have hitherto conſidered the ill Effect of theſe evil Conſequences at home, ſuppoſing them to terminate in the Concerns of <hi>Private</hi> Men. But this Suppoſition is not to be continued. For you will ſee preſently, that all theſe Things have a viſible Influence upon the <hi>Publick.</hi> The General <hi>Topick</hi> amongſt the Adverſaries of this <hi>Alteration,</hi> as well <hi>thoſe</hi> who <hi>hate,</hi> as thoſe who <hi>love, Liberty;</hi> truly ſo called, is, the <hi>ſeeming</hi> Advantage of this Part of the <hi>Act</hi> to that great and lovely Good. I call it <hi>ſeeming;</hi> becauſe, as it never was deſigned at firſt, by many of the moſt zealous Promoters of it, for any thing but to <hi>cramp</hi> the Endeavours of a <hi>Good Prince,</hi> for the ſettling our <hi>Liberties:</hi> So it hath never had any better laſting Effect that Way, than they deſign'd it ſhould have; but, as I think, viſibly tends, in its Conſequences, to the Deſtruction of our legal Liberties. The Reaſon is ſhort and plain. Nothing in the World can make Men more ſupinely negligent of the Publick Intereſt, or diſpoſe them more to receive their Chains, than a State of <hi>Bribery, Corruption, Debauchery</hi> and <hi>Idleneſs.</hi> And this is the conſtant State of moſt of our <hi>Electors,</hi> meerly thro' the quick Returns, and the pleaſing Proſpect of <hi>Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> The more laſting and uninterrupted this <hi>State</hi> is, the leſs ſenſible are they of the <hi>Evils</hi> it inclines them to. They are by degrees brought to think the <hi>higheſt Bidder</hi> to have the beſt Right to their <hi>Votes.</hi> And will act in Time agreeably to that Thought, whether the <hi>Money</hi> be offer'd them from Abroad, or at Home. The little Interruption to their Vices and their Expectations, is the Thing which makes the Danger ſo great: And this is owing to the frequent Returns of <hi>Elections,</hi> at ſo ſhort, certain, Periods of Time.</p>
            <p>Nor doth this Argument touch the <hi>Electors</hi> only, but the <hi>Elected</hi> alſo, to a very great degree. For as long as Humane Nature is capable of <hi>Corruption;</hi> as long as there is a <hi>Probability,</hi> or even a <hi>Poſſibility,</hi> of any Part of Mankind being induced to ſell their Country and their Poſterity, for a preſent Advantage to themſelves; ſo long it is evident to a Demonſtration, that <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> who have, by ſo frequent Returns of <hi>Chargeable Elections,</hi> exhauſted their Eſtate, and impoveriſhed their Families, will be much more likely to ſeek, or to embrace Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of re-imburſing themſelves, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting their own immediate Ruin, at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the publick <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Security;</hi> much more likely I ſay, to act this Part, than if the <hi>Term</hi> were made longer; and if by that Means they might hope to be at reſt from Expence for a much longer Time.</p>
            <p>Add to this, that <hi>Perſonal</hi> and <hi>Party-Revenge,</hi> which is, of all others, the moſt ſtrong <hi>Principle</hi> in the Bulk of <hi>Men,</hi> never fails to actuate both the <hi>Candidates</hi> and the <hi>Electors.</hi> If ever our Ruin be effected, it is too probable <hi>this</hi> will be the great Engine of it. And let every one judge, whether any thing could be deviſed more likely, either to raiſe, or actuate, or preſerve that Spirit in its Keenneſs and Bitterneſs, than the <hi>Triennial</hi> Returns of <hi>Elections,</hi> and the Expectation of them: Or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any thing can give us any <hi>Reſpite</hi> from that Spirit, and its fatal Conſequences, but an <hi>Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of thoſe <hi>Returns</hi> to a longer Diſtance.</p>
            <p>There is another Conſideration very well worth mentioning on this Subject, which is the Diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of Juſtice in the Countries: It is manifeſt, that nothing hath diverted the Courſe of it from its proper <hi>Current,</hi> ſo much as the <hi>Party-Views</hi> of Men, kept up to ſuch a Degree by the expected Returns of <hi>frequent Elections;</hi> and that nothing can recall it again, but ſome Reſt from thoſe Views which turn'd it aſide. Men will not have
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0084401700:3"/>
the Temptation, and therefore not the Inclination, either to ſuſpend Juſtice, or to act contrary to it, in many of thoſe Inſtances, in which now their conſtant Hopes or Fears, actuated by the <hi>Frequency</hi> of <hi>Elections,</hi> are too apt to draw them aſide. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, when ſome Intermiſſion is given to the Heats and Quarrels of Neighbours, the Occaſions and Opportunities of Partiality or Injuſtice, muſt, in good meaſure, ceaſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Effects</hi> which I have now gone over are but too certain, as they are the natural Product of the Paſſions of Men, in a divided Nation; and they are <hi>Evils,</hi> which will be, by degrees, at leaſt very much abated by the preſent Deſign.</p>
            <p>We have hitherto conſider'd our <hi>Triennial Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> their Influence upon <hi>Us</hi> at <hi>Home.</hi> Now, let us conſider what Effect They have had, and ſtill natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally have, <hi>Abroad.</hi> And here it muſt be remembred, that We are a Nation, not ſeparated in Intereſt (as We are in Situation) from the reſt of <hi>Europe.</hi> We have Enemies at Home, acting in Concert with Enemies Abroad: And <hi>Friends</hi> Abroad, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regard to whoſe Intereſts and Alliances, We muſt ſooner or later, become a Sacrifice to thoſe Enemies. We have a <hi>Pretender</hi> to guard againſt; Many here are his profeſs'd Friends; and many more act either blindly or deſignedly with Thoſe who are ſo; bearing a ſenſible part in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, and ever encouraging, or at leaſt, not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging, Them. That which keeps up the Views of thoſe Abroad, who think it their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, to make us the Scene of <hi>Civil War,</hi> if not a <hi>Province</hi> to themſelves, under that <hi>Pretender; That,</hi> I ſay, alone, which keeps up their Views, is, the knowing They have <hi>Friends</hi> here; and the finding that theſe Friends are never in deſpair, but always repreſenting their Cauſe, as promiſing well. And that which keeps them in this Temper, is, the conſtant Expectation of <hi>New Elections,</hi> in which They hope for more, but are certain at leaſt, of <hi>this</hi> Advantage, that our Heats, and Hatreds, and Deſire of Revenge, are ſtill perpetuated and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. This is conſtantly repreſented abroad; and with ſuch Succeſs, that They who wiſh Evil to our Happy Eſtabliſhment, ſeem really to believe it; and they who wiſh well to it, receive Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion enough from it, to look upon Us with Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as a <hi>People,</hi> always fluctuating and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. It was this great diſadvantage, ariſing from our Condition at home, that brought King <hi>William</hi> to make a <hi>Peace,</hi> even againſt his own good Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and his own great Views; for which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be urged, but that diſtreſs, to which our wretched and uneaſy State here, had reduced his Affairs. And no wonder now if after that great Unhappineſs, and what is ſtill more dreadful, after a late Fatal Experience, the beſt Friends we have <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,</hi> cannot be ſo confident of us, as our Intereſt makes it requiſite they ſhould be. In a Word, Our <hi>Enemies</hi> both <hi>Abroad,</hi> and at <hi>Home,</hi> can't be reduc'd even one ſtep towards a ſtate of <hi>Deſpair,</hi> in the Methods We are in at preſent: Nor our beſt Friends be throughly aſſured of our ſecure Eſtate: The <hi>Former</hi> muſt look upon us ſtill, with a good degree of Contempt; and the <hi>Latter</hi> with a great deal of Uneaſineſs and Diffidence, till We have ſome reſting Time, to Settle, not only the <hi>Tempers,</hi> but the Affairs, and the Intereſts of this Nation: Which never will be done, as there is Reaſon to fear, as long as <hi>Parliaments</hi> continue limited to the preſent Term.</p>
            <p>This puts me in mind of another very material Point, which tho' abſolutely neceſſary to procure Us the Confidence of our Friends, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Reſpect from our Enemies; yet ſeems im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be Effected without a greater ſteddineſs of Counſels, a more uninterrupted Application to publick Buſineſs, and a more Mature and Diſinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted Deliberation, than the Experience we have had of frequent <hi>Elections</hi> gives room to hope for: This is the Paying off the <hi>Debts</hi> of the <hi>Nation,</hi> which muſt otherwiſe Eat out the very Vitals of the Publick, and expoſe Us to the greateſt Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from ſuch foreign Powers, as are uſing the moſt violent Methods to be before hand with Us in this ſignal Advantage. To work out this inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate Evil, there appears but one Method, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with the Faith of Parliamentary Securities (which ought to be preſerved inviolable) and at the ſame time, free from the Odium of impoſing new Taxes on the Country, and in which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the Landed, and the Monied Intereſt, would be likely to join, without eithers thinking themſelves in the leaſt aggrieved. This is to Raiſe and Support the Publick Credit to ſuch a Height, as may enable the Government to Borrow, at a <hi>lower</hi> Intereſt, what may Pay off ſuch Debts as carry a <hi>greater;</hi> which was attempted laſt Year, but hindred by the Rebellion. Now Experience ſhews, that publick Credit will be ſubject to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Fluctuations and Inequalities, or even fall to an Ebb from whence it is next to impoſſible to make it re-aſcend, while the Meaſures of one three Years are liable to be Unravell'd and Reverſed by the Three next ſucceeding, and thoſe again by the next; and whilſt under the Shelter of frequent Elections, ſuch Tumults, Commotions and Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, are Introduced, as, however oppoſite in themſelves, conſpire in ſhaking the Foundation of all Government, keep Mens Minds in ſuſpence, and make them look on every Thing as precari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that is any ways involved with the Publick.</p>
            <p>After many <hi>Enquiries,</hi> I can meet with but one <hi>Good Event,</hi> in favour of the <hi>Triennial Term</hi> for <hi>Elections,</hi> which a long Experience hath furniſh'd us with: And that is, that it is ſuppos'd to have been the occaſion of throwing out the Deſtructive <hi>Bill</hi> of <hi>Commerce;</hi> ſome <hi>Gentlemen</hi> not daring to Vote for it out of fear, of their next <hi>Elections.</hi> But this you will ſee, cuts both ways. For, as <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> may by accident, not do a <hi>Bad</hi> thing for fear of their <hi>Next Election;</hi> ſo it is as plain, that they may, as often, not do the moſt neceſſary <hi>good</hi> thing, if it happens to be <hi>Unpopular,</hi> for the ſame fear. So that this holds at leaſt equally <hi>againſt</hi> that Bill, as <hi>for</hi> it. But then many, who knew thoſe Times, will deny the <hi>Fact,</hi> and affirm, that a multitude of <hi>little Piques,</hi> and <hi>great Paſſions,</hi> concurr'd in that Affair; and that the <hi>Awe</hi> of <hi>Electors,</hi> happen'd at that time to have but little Share in it. Private Hiſtory would be uſeful to us upon this occaſion. But <hi>this</hi> We all ſaw in <hi>publick,</hi> that however that Fear might then be ſuppos'd to work ſo far, as to hinder thoſe few <hi>Gentlemen</hi> from openly eſpouſing that <hi>fatal Bill;</hi> it did not work ſo far, as to keep them immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from entering into an <hi>Addreſs,</hi> and Voting for ſuch <hi>Methods,</hi> as muſt have been as <hi>Fatal,</hi> as that Bill it ſelf, if Providence had not interpoſed. What would it have avail'd us, that the <hi>Bill</hi> had not paſs'd <hi>then,</hi> if theſe Deſigns, at the ſame Time on Foot, had prevail'd? And what doth it avail to ſay, that the <hi>Triennial Term</hi> did Us that good, (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it ſo,) when it is plain, it had not the Power to preſerve that Good; and that the ſame Perſons, who ſeem'd to fear it, yet were induc'd to <hi>undo</hi> their own Work, and to enter into Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which muſt have ended in the ſame Evils,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0084401700:4"/>
and indeed, in Univerſal Deſtruction? It ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies little, therefore, whether this was the great occaſion of that <hi>lucky Incident</hi> or not; becauſe it is plain it had not power enough to hinder the Ill Effects of that <hi>Bill,</hi> in another Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod: Nor would have hindred them, had not ſomething elſe intervened. But ſuppoſing it had; certainly <hi>that</hi> one particular, ſo purely acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, cannot be ſet againſt a <hi>Train</hi> of Conſtant, and too certain, Evil Conſequences, which we feel every Day we live. Theſe <hi>Evil Conſequences,</hi> are ſo many undeniable-Arguments for an <hi>Alteration</hi> of it; and weigh exceedingly and particularly at this Juncture, when all our Happineſs depends upon the <hi>Firm Eſtabliſhment</hi> of our <hi>Excellent King,</hi> upon this Throne; when all our Enemies at Home and Abroad, viſibly place their Hopes in our Diſturbances, owing to nothing ſo much as to the conſtant Expectation of <hi>Triennial Elections;</hi> when all our true Friends, both here and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, wait with Impatience to ſee our Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty firmly and throughly Eſtabliſhed: When the going on with proper Meaſures, for ſuch Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, has been unavoidably put off, by the Attention given to the Rebellion, and ſo the longer Continuance of this Parliament is become particularly neceſſary; And when We all may obſerve, if We pleaſe, that, tho' the <hi>Rebellion</hi> be in great Meaſure quell'd, yet, the <hi>Spirit</hi> of it, is ſo far from being lay'd aſleep, that it walks about ſtill, even at Noon-day, in defiance of all <hi>Authority;</hi> and with a ſtrubborneſs, never to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a ſettled Deſpair, without ſome ſuch <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,</hi> as is now talk'd of.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Particulars,</hi> I ſay, are ſo many undeniable Arguments, for an <hi>Alteration</hi> of the <hi>Term</hi> of <hi>Years</hi> fix'd in the <hi>Act,</hi> unleſs it ſhall appear that the <hi>Objections</hi> againſt doing it, are of more Weight and Importance. Thoſe which I have been able to hear of, together with ſuch as you tell me are moſt talk'd of in the Country, We will now juſt run over.</p>
            <p>The moſt general Objection (and that which ſeems in reality to lye at the Bottom of all the reſt) is, that this Step will be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>popular among the Electors, and raiſe ſuch a Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour all over the Nation, as muſt for ever ſink the Intereſt of thoſe who have any Share in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting it. To this I anſwer, that it will wholly depend on the Parliament it ſelf, to render this proceeding Popular, or Unpopular, by the right or wrong Uſe they ſhall make of the Prolongation thereby accruing to themſelves. If their After-behaviour ſhould be ſuch, as to ſhew they had no wiſer, nor more generous View in making this Alteration, than merely to ſave themſelves the hazard, trouble and expence of a New Election, they muſt, no doubt, be content to reap the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of their Selfiſhneſs, by forfeiting all Title to the future good Will of their Electors. But if their Zeal and Induſtry for promoting the Eaſe and Safety of the Nation, ſhall appear to riſe in proportion to the Time allowed them for accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing the great Work they have begun, the <hi>End</hi> will ſufficiently commend the <hi>Means;</hi> and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages ariſing to the whole Kingdom from this Change, will eaſily Reconcile it to all ſuch, with whom a good Man ought ever to wiſh to Maintain the Character of Popularity. It will certainly be in the Power of thoſe who moſt apprehend the Odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, and Unpopularity of this Action, to Secure it from all poſſible Miſ-repreſentations, by making Uſe of the Power it will bring with it, to juſt and wiſe Purpoſes; to eaſe the Debts, to perfect the Tranquility, and to perpetuate the Peace of the Nation. Raiſing Money by <hi>Taxes</hi> upon <hi>Land,</hi> Windows, Soap, or any thing elſe, is always <hi>Unpopular,</hi> and always raiſes <hi>Clamours,</hi> when it is firſt reſolved upon. Every thing that hath been done for the Security of His preſent <hi>Majeſty;</hi> the ſuſpending the <hi>Habeas Corpus Act,</hi> without which We muſt have been deſtroyed; the grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Him a Power to Raiſe, and Hire, Forces for his own, and the Nation's Defence; the putting his <hi>Friends</hi> into any Poſſibility of conſulting his Safety and Honour; Every particular of this ſort hath been repreſented all over the Nation, in ſuch Colours, that it hath been highly <hi>unpopular,</hi> and been attended with great <hi>Clamours:</hi> But Neceſſity and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedience are the things to be conſider'd in all ſuch Points. <hi>Theſe</hi> will always make things <hi>pleaſing</hi> to the true Friends of the Nation. But in order to be <hi>popular</hi> with the <hi>King's</hi> Enemies, the firſt Step he muſt take, muſt be, to lay down his <hi>Crown;</hi> and if his <hi>Miniſters</hi> be reſolved to be moved by <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,</hi> they muſt reſign their <hi>Poſts,</hi> and yield up all Power to thoſe who wiſh to deſtroy them. The only Conſideration is, whether the Nation's Affairs require a thing to be done: When <hi>that</hi> is fix'd, <hi>Popular</hi> or <hi>Unpopular, Clamours</hi> or <hi>no Clamours,</hi> ought not to affect any farther, than about the <hi>manner</hi> of doing it. Every thing that touches particular Men's Purſes, or retrenches from their Luxury, will generally be <hi>Unpopular</hi> with thoſe Men: But a little Time makes ſuch things eaſy, when the <hi>Publick</hi> finds it's Advantage in it, and Men's Paſſions have had Time to cool.</p>
            <p>Another thing which I find generally ſhews it ſelf, at firſt hearing of the <hi>Deſign,</hi> is, an <hi>Uneaſineſs,</hi> as if <hi>this</hi> were <hi>Repealing the Act:</hi> When, in truth, I will venture to affirm, that it is ſo far from <hi>that,</hi> that it is indeed Reſtoring it to its beſt Deſign; and making it effectual to all that Good which was originally purpoſed, and intended, by any of thoſe <hi>honeſt Patriots</hi> who joined in the firſt framing of it. The Deſigns were, that a <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England</hi> ſhould not be <hi>without</hi> a <hi>Parliament;</hi> and that <hi>one</hi> and the ſame <hi>Parliament</hi> ſhould have a <hi>Term</hi> fixed, beyond which it ſhould not be in the Power of the <hi>Prince</hi> to continue it. And in both theſe reſpects the <hi>Act</hi> will be left as it was. All the Difference is, that the <hi>Parliament</hi> then in being, thought <hi>Three Years</hi> the proper Term. Experience hath aſſured us of a Multitude of Evils proceeding from ſo quick a <hi>Return</hi> of <hi>Elections.</hi> And therefore, in that part of the <hi>Act,</hi> and in <hi>that</hi> only, is the <hi>Alteration</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, in order to remedy or abate thoſe <hi>Evils,</hi> without bringing in greater.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Another</hi> Reaſon againſt it, is taken from a Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of ſome private and perſonal Views in the <hi>King's Miniſters;</hi> as if the whole Aim were to eſtabliſh themſelves, for ſo much longer time, in their Power. But I obſerve, that the ſame Perſons who make this <hi>Objection,</hi> generally contradict it, by affirming that the <hi>Miniſters</hi> have nothing to fear, and that this preſent Deſign is wholly <hi>unneceſſary,</hi> becauſe a Court may be ſure of another <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Commons,</hi> to their Mind. They muſt think the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> very weak, not to ſee this, which is ſo plain, that the Influence of a <hi>Court</hi> hath hardly ever fail'd in this Point, tho' at the ſame time, the Gentlemen who make this Objection, are apt to inſinuate the neceſſity of ſome Meaſures for this purpoſe, which cannot be very agreeable to an honeſt and incorrupt Miniſtry. However, in the Opinion of ſuch as allow this, it cannot be having a View to <hi>Themſelves,</hi> but a general View to the <hi>Nation</hi> at <hi>Home,</hi> and to the Intereſt and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0084401700:5"/>
Glory of it <hi>Abroad,</hi> which engageth the Miniſters in this Deſign. They who know the Nature of ſuch Affairs, judge the contrary, that <hi>Miniſters,</hi> as to their own private Intereſt, might more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly find their Account in <hi>New Parliaments,</hi> than in <hi>One continued.</hi> Experience ſhews, that the moſt <hi>Courtly Parliaments</hi> have turn'd <hi>Uncourtly</hi> in their long ſitting. And therefore, this Deſign can't be neceſſary for any private ſelf-intereſted Views of their own, becauſe it is allowed, that ſuch Ends, (if they have any,) might be ſerv'd as well, at leaſt, in the former Method, as in this. They, who find a <hi>Biaſs</hi> in their Minds, againſt every thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by a <hi>Court,</hi> let it be what it will, ſhould conſider, in this Caſe, whether it be not probable that the preſent Views and Deſigns are of a <hi>Publick Nature,</hi> rather than of a <hi>Private;</hi> and ſhould act accordingly, without prejudice, or affection, as they think it requiſite, or not, for the Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>King,</hi> and the <hi>Nation;</hi> and for the more effectual deſtroying all the Hopes of the Enemies of both.</p>
            <p>The moſt powerful <hi>Objection</hi> of all, is, that the <hi>Alteration</hi> now deſign'd, may make it much more likely, that under a <hi>Bad Prince,</hi> ſometime or other, <hi>Arbitrary Power</hi> may b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> is faſhioned to <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Juſtice;</hi> and whoſe great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry upon all Occaſions is, what our Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and what our Laws require of <hi>Him.</hi> We have a <hi>Prince,</hi> in View, to ſucceed Him, whoſe <hi>Native Honour</hi> and <hi>Integrity,</hi> guard Him againſt all ſuſpicion. But I grant, this may not always be our Happineſs, either in <hi>Poſſeſſion,</hi> or in <hi>Proſpect.</hi> And therefore if this <hi>All<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>eration</hi> could be proved, I ſhould be moved another way, than I am at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: There will be more
<hi>Time,</hi> I acknowledge, in any one particular <hi>Parliament,</hi> for <hi>Attempts</hi> to be made that way. But, as I think, not at all more likely to ſucceed. On the contrary, there is more likelihood, that <hi>Gentlem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </hi> ſhould by degrees, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come even ready to part with a Conſtitution, for which there muſt be ſuch Contention by <hi>Bribery,</hi> and all the <hi>Arts</hi> of Iniquity, every <hi>Three Years,</hi> than if it were otherwiſe. And then again, ſuppoſing a <hi>Parliament</hi> choſen for <hi>Three Years</hi> only; a <hi>Prince</hi> reſolutely bent upon doing it in a <hi>Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

One may venture to affirm, that a <hi>Parliament</hi> which keeps its Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for <hi>Three Years,</hi> will diſcourage the making any ſuch Attempts for the remaining <hi>Four.</hi> And, to give an Inſtance, if I remember right, the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> which gave up the <hi>Liberties</hi> of <hi>Sweden,</hi> gave that Fatal ſtroke within the <hi>Term</hi> of <hi>Three Years</hi>

               </hi> can be bad enough for ſuch a Deſign, they will firſt take care, at the time of Election, to ſet up Perſons capable of the ſame bad Deſign. And then, there is no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Three</hi> or <hi>Seven Years.</hi> Only, here remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, what I have before obſerv'd to you, that the quick Returns of <hi>Trienn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

One might appeal to any who know the World, whether it be not more probable (as I have urged already,) that the <hi>Elected Gentlemen</hi> themſelves, impoveriſh'd by ſo frequent Returns of their great <hi>Charges,</hi> will be inclined to liſten to the Offer made them, with ſo pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a View, than if the Returns were not ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent; and beſides this, whether the Influence that way, from the powerful motive of <hi>Party-Revenge,</hi> will not have vaſtly more weight, when it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap> rouſed and irritated, and ſet on Fire, by ſo quick <hi>Returns</hi> of <hi>Contention,</hi> than if it were otherwiſe. And, what is of great moment, in my opinion, ſince it is plain that every Inſtance of wickedneſs, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>med by the quick <hi>Returns</hi> of <hi>Elections;</hi> there muſt be much greater Encouragement to a <hi>Foreign Enemy,</hi> to interpoſe with his Money, to purchaſe our Ruine, in a <hi>Triennial Choice,</hi> than in a <hi>Septennial.</hi> Eſpecially now, before we are well ſettled upon that Bottom which is the only Foundation of our Happineſs. It is well known how far the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Powers intermeddle in the Elections of <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> and with how much ſucceſs they ſend their Agents and Factors to them; and what an abuſe of Liberty this Corruption has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced in thoſe Countries, all the World can teſtify: Nor can we think the Election of a Britiſh Parliament, ſo very indifferent a thing to ſome neighbouring Powers, eſpecially, at certain Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, that they ſhould think One or Two Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Thouſand Pounds miſapplied, in purchaſing Votes to their Mind. And I can ſay, that this is no whimſical Suppoſition, becauſe I have my ſelf ſeen an <hi>Intercepted Letter,</hi> written from hence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>France,</hi> juſt before the laſt <hi>Election,</hi> by a Friend to the <hi>Pretender,</hi> who had taken the <hi>Oaths</hi> to King <hi>George,</hi> plainly hinting both that ſuch a thing was then expected from the King of <hi>France,</hi> and that he did not doubt the <hi>Succeſs</hi> of it. I think, this alone is enough to allarm any true Lover of his Country, in the preſent Situation of our Affairs, and of thoſe of all <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is one more <hi>Objection,</hi> I hear, is often urged, That <hi>We</hi> ſhould have ſeverely blamed ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in the late <hi>Adminiſtration:</hi> Nay, that great Horror was expreſs'd, at the very ſuppoſition of the thing, at that time; I grant this, and that the Horror was juſt and reaſonable. But upon what was this founded? Not upon the unlawfulneſs of the thing it ſelf; not upon the Impoſſibility of it's ever being fit to be done; but upon a too well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded Aſſurance, that they who were then in Power muſt have meant it, whenever they did it, for the ſame end, to which their other Acts tended, and that was, the utter Ruine of the <hi>Grand-Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> and of all the Hopes of our beſt <hi>Friends</hi> Abroad, and the inſpiring full Vigour into the Cauſe of <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>Pretender.</hi> This was the Ground of all juſt dread upon that Head. Had it been ſo, that they had deſign'd it manifeſtly for the firmer Security of the <hi>Proteſtant Succeſſion</hi> here, and the greater ſupport of the <hi>Grand Alliance</hi> abroad, no true <hi>Britain</hi> could have had ground of Complaint, but muſt have acknowledg'd, if it tended, and was n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

And my reaſon for believing ſo, is, that they did not at all want it; nay, that it would have done them more Hurt than Good. Their Deſigns were ſuch as were to be manag'd ſolely by Artifice. The great <hi>Engines</hi> they made uſe of for keeping up a Spirit, againſt all Truth and Right, were thoſe very <hi>Mobbs, Riots,</hi> and <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults,</hi> which alone could keep a Multitude in ſuch a Ferment, as to make them admire, and preſs for their own Ruine. They thought it their Intereſt to govern by the <hi>Paſſions</hi> of the Crowd: And were very peculiarly dextrous in the Management of them. They were poſſeſs'd of the full Cry, and Noiſe of the Nation, and likely, in all probability, ſo to continue: This was a much ſurer Hold to <hi>Them,</hi> and to <hi>their</hi> Deſigns, than the Continuance of One and the ſame <hi>Parliament:</hi> And therefore, they never attempted it. But certainly, as that ſame Spirit, which was then raiſed for the Service of the <hi>Pretender,</hi> made it <hi>unneceſſary</hi> for <hi>them;</hi> ſo, it being ſtill alive, and full of evil Influences upon our Happineſs, this makes it highly prudent in <hi>Others,</hi> to do <hi>that</hi> in order to ſuppreſs and extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate it, which <hi>They,</hi> in their Wiſdom, would not do, for fear of quieting what they expected Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit from. <hi>Their</hi> ſecurity conſiſted in keeping up that vile Spirit to the Heighth. It is the ſecurity of the <hi>King</hi> and his Government, to have a ſtop put to it, and to remove every Opportunity that may give <hi>Fuel</hi> and <hi>Encouragement</hi> to it, as far as is conſiſtent with the Conſtitution and Liberties of the Nation.</p>
            <p>All theſe <hi>Conſiderations</hi> put together, have, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, wholly taken off my <hi>Firſt Surprize.</hi> And the ſame Conſiderations make me hope, that all true Friends to the <hi>King,</hi> and to the <hi>Publick Happineſs,</hi> (which now depends entirely upon the firm <hi>Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment</hi> of the preſent Royal Family) will not let their <hi>General Suſpicion,</hi> or their <hi>Particular Biaſs,</hi> have ſuch Power over them, as to move them, to join with their own <hi>Enemies,</hi> in a <hi>Point,</hi> in which if they ſhould, by any unforeſeen Accident, have <hi>Succeſs,</hi> I am confident, they would very heartily, as well as fruitleſly <hi>repe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>And this is one very good Reaſon, why <hi>All,</hi> who truly wiſh well to that <hi>Settlement,</hi> ſhould unite in the <hi>Alteration</hi> of that which is the <hi>Chief,</hi> if not the <hi>Only,</hi> thing left to keep up the Spirits and Deſigns of its Enemies. But if, when it is in our Power, to put ſome Stop to our preſent <hi>Corruptions</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions,</hi> and to eſtabliſh the <hi>Glory</hi> of our <hi>King,</hi> and the Happineſs of our Country, in a Method per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly confident with all our Rights and Liberties, we are guided by the Inſinuations of thoſe who hate us, and refuſe to do it, we muſt thank our ſelves for all that follows. It will lie at our Door to anſwer for all the Conſequences of ſuch a Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. From <hi>theſe,</hi> with whom we join in it, we have no Returns to expect, but Contempt, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, and Inſults.</p>
            <p>In fine, I can conſider the <hi>Triennial Return</hi> of our <hi>Elections,</hi> no otherwiſe, than as what hath made us, and ſtill continues us, the moſt Divided and moſt Corrupted of <hi>Nations;</hi> what was at firſt by many contrived, and ſtill in its own Nature tends to oppoſe the Deſigns of the <hi>Beſt Kings,</hi> and to promote thoſe of the <hi>Worſt;</hi> leading to an univerſal Debauchery of the Manners and Tempers of the <hi>Electors,</hi> as well as to make the <hi>Elected</hi> themſelves weary enough of ſuch perpetual Conteſts and Charge, to incline ſome Time or other to <hi>Thoughts</hi> which would not otherwiſe find Admittance; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluencing the <hi>People</hi> to think eaſily of becoming a Prey to the <hi>Higheſt Bidder;</hi> keeping up the <hi>Spirits</hi> of our <hi>Common Enemies,</hi> and creating Diffidence and Uneaſineſs in our <hi>beſt Friends;</hi> introducing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing all Exceſſes of Violence and Mutual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; ſerving a <hi>Multitude</hi> of <hi>bad</hi> Purpoſes, which have a peculiar Malignity at this particular Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, without having <hi>one</hi> good Effect, fit to be named in Oppoſition to them: And all this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the <hi>Shortneſs</hi> of the <hi>Interval</hi> allowed, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to put an End to ſuch Evils, or to cultivate any thing that is Good.
