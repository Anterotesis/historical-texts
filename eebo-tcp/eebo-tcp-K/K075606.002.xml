            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It may be conjectured that he was of the Roman Catholic perſuaſion, being ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary to Queen Mary the wife of James the Second, and one who followed the fortunes of his abdicating maſter. How long he continued in this ſervice is unknown, but he was in England in the reign of Queen Anne, and recommended the ſubject of Mr. Pope's "Rape of the Lock" to that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, who on its publication addreſſed it to him.

               <head>ECLOGUE II.</head>
               <byline>BY MR. NAHUM TATE<note n="*" place="bottom">Born about the middle of the reign of king Charles II. in the kingdom of Ireland, where he received his education. He was made poet laureat to king William, upon the death of Shadwell, and held that place till the acceſſion of George I. on whom he lived to write the firſt birth-day ode, which is executed with unuſual ſpirit. He was a man of good-nature, great probity, and competent learning; but ſo extremely modeſt, that he was never able to make his fortune, or to raiſe himſelf above neceſſity. The earl of Dorſet was his patron; but the chief uſe he made of him was, to ſcreen himſelf from the perſecution of his creditors. He died in the Mint, Auguſt 12, 1716; and was ſucceeded in the laurel by Mr. Euſden. He was the author of nine dramatic per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, a great number of poems, and of a verſion of the Pſalms in conjunction with Dr. Nicholas Brady. He was a man of wit and parts, yet not thought to poſſeſs any very great genius, as being deficient in what is its firſt character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtic, namely, invention. Thus far the Biographical Dicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary.—His miſcellaneous poems are enumerated by Jacob, who ſays, Tate's poem on the Death of Queen Anne, which was one of the laſt, is
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"one of the beſt poems he ever wrote."</q>
His ſhare in the
"Second Part of Abſalom and Achitophel"
is far from inconſiderable; and may be ſeen in the Engliſh Poets, vol. XIII. p. 160.
He publiſhed alſo "Memorials for the Learned, collected out of eminent Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors in Hiſtory, &amp;c. 1686,"
8vo. and his
"Propoſal for regulating of the Stage and Stage Plays, Feb. 6, 1698,"
is among Biſhop Gibſon's MSS. in the Lambeth Library. N.</note>.</byline>

"Fifteen Diſcourſes occaſionally delivered before the Univerſity of Oxford. By William Adams, M.A. late ſtudent of Chriſt Church, and rector of Staunton upon Wye in Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire. Publiſhed by Henry Sacheverell, D.D. 1716."
This volume, of which a ſecond edition was publiſhed the ſame year, is inſcribed to Richard Hopton, eſq. knight of the ſhire for the county of Hereford, to whom Mr. Adams had been tutor at Chriſt Church; an employment be appears to have been well qualified for diſcharging. In his younger years he gave many admirable ſpecimens of his polite genius, in his accurate performances in Poetry and Oratory; and had afterwards the honour to be choſen his maſter Dr. Buſby's firſt Catachetical Lecturer in Oxford. To anſwer the pious and charitable deſign of that great founder of learning, he bent the whole courſe of his ſtudies to Divinity, of which he is ſaid to have drawn out a comprehenſive and uſeful plan which at his death he directed his executors to deſtroy, with all his MSS. except the volume of Diſcourſes, which appeared by his expreſs injunction.

                  <p>This Eclogue is wholly paſtoral, and conſiſts of the contention of two ſhepherds, Thyrſis and Corydon; to the hearing of which Mcliboeus was invited by Daphnis, and thus relates it.</p>

               <l>WHILE Daphnis ſate beneath a whiſpering ſhade,</l>
               <l>Thyrſis and Corydon together fed</l>

                     <q rend="inline">"Sir William Temple was deſcended from a younger branch of a family of that name, ſeated at Temple Hall in Leiceſterſhire. His grandfather was ſecretary to the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate earl of Eſſex, favourite of queen Elizabeth, and his father was Sir John Temple, maſter of the rolls in Ireland. He was as much above the common level of politicians, as he was above the herd of authors. He diſplayed his great abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities in ſeveral important treaties and negotiations, the moſt conſiderable of which was the bringing to a happy concluſion the famous triple league betwixt England, Sweden, and Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. This alliance, though the moſt prudent ſtep ever taken by Charles II. was ſoon defeated by the Cabal, a ſet of men who were as great a diſgrace to their country, as Sir William Temple was an honour to it. He was ſtrongly ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to go over to Holland, in order to break that league which he had a little before concluded: but he was too much a patriot to yield to any ſolicitations of that kind; and choſe to retire into the country, where he was much better employed in writing his excellent
"Obſervations on the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Provinces,"
and other elegant works. Few authors have been more read, or more juſtly admired, than Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Temple. He diſplays his great knowledge of book<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> by the beſt poet and the beſt divine of her age. Dr. Jeremy Taylor addreſſed his diſcourſe
"on the nature and effects of friendſhip" to this lady; and Mr. Cowley has celebrated her memory, in an Ode particularly diſtinguiſhed by the very learned and ſagacious editor of his "Select Works."—The induſtrious Mr. Langbaine ſays,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"ſhe was one that equalled the Leſbian Sappho, and Roman Sulpicia: as they were praiſed by Horace, Martial, Auſonius, and other antient poets; ſo was this lady commended by the earls of Orrery and Roſcommon, by Cowley, Flatman, and other eminent poets."</q>
Sir John Denham added a fifth act to her tragedy of "Horace," which was performed at court by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of quality, in 1678. In the prologue, ſpoken by the duke of Monmouth, it was obſerved, that
<q>

                     <l>" Horace did riſe above a Roman ſtate."</l>
                  </q>
The commendation ſhe received from Lord Roſcommon is thus handſomely returned by Mrs. Philipps:
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Lord Roſcommon is certainly one of the moſt promiſing young noblemen in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. He has paraphraſed a Pſalm admirably; and a ſcene of Paſtor Fido very finely, in ſome places much better than Sir Richard Fanſhaw.

It begins thus:
<q>
                     <l>" Dear happy groves, and you the dark retreat</l>
                     <l>" Of ſilent horrour, Reſt's eternal ſeat."</l>
                  </q>
From theſe lines, which are ſince ſomewhat mended, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that he did not think a work of two hours fit to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the eye of criticiſm without reviſal. When Mrs. Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipps was in Ireland, ſome ladies, that had ſeen her tranſlation of Pompey, reſolved to bring it on the ſtage at Dublin; and, to promote their deſign, Lord Roſcommon gave them a prologue, and Sir Edward Dering an epilogue; "which," ſays ſhe,

            <head>ARISTAEUS<note n="*" place="bottom">Ariſtaeus was ſon of Cyrene, daughter to one of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient kings of Arcadia; and by Apollo as was believed or at leaſt reported. His birth was concealed, and he was ſent to be privately brought up among the ſhepherds of Arcadia; where, grown a man, he applied himſelf wholly to the cares and ſtores of a country life, in all which he ſucceeded, ſo as to grow renowned for his knowledge and wealth. He was eſteemed the firſt inventor of cheeſe, oil, and honey, or rather of the art of hiving bees, which before were wild, and their ſtocks found only by chance and in hollow trees. For this he was worſhiped among the Arcadians as ſon of Apollo, and as other inventors of things neceſſary or moſt uſeful to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man life. He fell in love with Eurydice newly eſpouſed to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheus; and by his purſuit of her was the occaſion of her death, being bitten by a ſnake as ſhe fled from him. This was followed by the death of Orpheus after a long and incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable grief, whereupon Ariſtaeus was by the nymphs, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of Eurydice, plagued in all his ſtores, but moſt of all in his bees, of which he was fondeſt, till he loſt them all, and was in deſpair ever to recover them: but, by the advice of his mother and of Proteus, to whom ſhe ſent him, he came to find out both the true cauſe of his loſs, and means of retrieving it.

For copies of this and the following poem I am indebted to a volume in the Lambeth Library, 39. 6. 13. fol. moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligingly communicated by Dr. Ducarel.—The Reader will not be diſpleaſed at being preſented with two Latin poems (though perhaps of no ſuperior excellence) by ſo capital a writer. By the ſecond of them it appears that in 1662 he had the degree of B.A. and had obtained a fellowſhip; though neither of thoſe academical honours attended has name in 1661. One of his earlieſt productions (written in 1650, the year he went to College) is already printed in vol. I. p. 181. with a prologue and two epilogues to "The Duke of Guiſe," none of which are in any edition of his works. If theſe poems had come to light before the publication of Dr. Johnſon's excellent Life of Dryden, that judicious Biographer would certainly have made ſome alteration in the following paragraph:—<q rend="inline">"At the univerſity he does not appear to have been eager of <hi>poetical</hi> diſtinction, or to have laviſhed his <hi>early wit</hi> either on fictitious ſubjects or publick occaſions. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably conſidered that he who purpoſed to be an author, ought firſt to be a ſtudent. He obtained, whatever was the reaſon, <hi>no fellowſhip</hi> in the College. Why he was excluded, cannot now be known, and it is vain to gueſs; had he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf injured, he knew how to complain. In the Life of Pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tarch he mentions his education in the College with gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude; but in a prologue at Oxford, he has theſe lines:
<q>
                        <l>Oxford to him a dearer name ſhall be</l>
                        <l>Than his own mother-univerſity;</l>
                        <l>Thebes did his rude unknowing youth engage:</l>
                        <l>He chooſes Athens in his riper age.</l>
                     </q>

               <l>Cromwell had much to ſay in his defence:</l>

               <l>Reproves ill-manners, and reforms the times,</l>
               <l>How am I then to blame, when all I write</l>
               <l>Is honeſt rage, not prejudice or ſpite?</l>
               <l>Truth is my aim, with truth I ſhall impeach;</l>
               <l>And I'll ſpare none that comes within its reach.</l>
               <l>On then, my Muſe—the world before thee lies—</l>

            <head>TO THE EARL OF MIDDLETON<note n="*" place="bottom">Charles Middleton, the ſecond earl of that title, and baron Clairmont, was ſecretary of ſtate for Scotland from the year 1684 to the Revolution; when he followed king James into France, and was attainted by the Scots parliament in 1695. He married lady Catharine daughter of Robert earl of Cardigan, by whom he had two ſons, John lord Clair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, and Charles Middleton, <abbr>eſq</abbr> who were both taken at ſea by admiral Byng, in the deſcent which the French in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended upon Scotland in 1708; but, by the queen's orders, they were ſoon releaſed, and died in France without iſſue. Their father was alſo aboard in that armament. He had two daughters; lady-Elizabeth, wife of Edward, ſon of James earl of Perth; and lady Mary, wife of ſir John Gifford, knight.—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"He is one of the pleaſanteſt companions in the world."</q>
 Macky.—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Sir William Temple told me, he was a very valuable man; and a good ſcholar I once ſaw him."</q> 
SWIFT, MS.—In Harl. MSS. are ſeveral of his letters to the earl of Oxford; in one of which, 1729, he thus recommends the chevalier Ramſay:
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"To a great deal of erudition he joins as many and great good qualities as I ever met in any man."</q>
In another, he tells lord Oxford, who wiſhed to exchange ſome literary curioſities with the French king,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"You are too modeſt; and that is not the way to deal with the people of <hi>this</hi> country."</q>—An affecting ſtory of the honourable Charles Middleton (ſecond ſon of the earl) is related by the counteſs of Pomfret, in Duncombe's collection of Letters, vol. II. p. 125. 2d edit. N.</note>.</head>

In 1678 he was tutor to the ſon of Judge Thurland, and in 1681 to a ſon of Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Hickes. By the advice of Sir William and the aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of Dr. Lower, he applied, for about a year, to the ſtudy of phyſic; but, poetry being predominant, he haſtened to London, and became a perfect votary to the bottle, yet without ſinking into the debauchery of his contemporary wits. As he was of a very different turn from his father, the character of the old parſon, at the end of his works, is ſuppoſed to have been deſigned for him. It is perhaps the moſt extravagant caricature that ever was drawn. He was patronized by the earl of Kingſton, who would have made him his chaplain if he would have qualified himſelf. He lived with the earl, however, till his death, which was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by the ſmall-pox, Dec. 9, 1683. He was parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly eſteemed by Mr. Dryden; who has done him great juſtice in "Verſes to his Memory," (Engliſh Poets, vol. XIV. p. 161.)

            <head>REMEDY OF LOVE.</head>
            <byline>BY JOHN EVELYN<note n="*" place="bottom">Son of the great natural philoſopher, and born at Sayes-Court near Deptford, upon the 14th of January 1654, and was there educated with great care. He was ſent to Oxford in the year 1666, where he remained in the houſe of Dr. Bathurſt, then preſident of Trinity-college, before he was admitted a gentleman-commoner, which was in Eaſter-term 1688. It is not clear at what time he left Oxford; but Mr. Wood ſeems to be poſitive that he took no degree there, but returned to his father's houſe, and proſecuted his ſtudies under his directions. It is ſuppoſed, however, that, during his reſidence in Trinity-college, he wrote that elegant Greek poem, which is prefixed to the ſecond edition of the Sylva; and is a noble proof of the ſtrength of his genius and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful progreſs in learning in the early part of his life. He diſcovered his proficiency ſoon afterwards, both in the ancient and modern languages, by his elegant tranſlations; as well as his intimate acquaintance with the Muſes, in ſome original poems, which were much admired. His works will be mentioned preſently. He married Martha, daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and co-heireſs of Richard Spencer, <abbr>eſq</abbr> and, having a head as well turned for buſineſs as ſtudy, became one of the commiſſioners of the revenue in Ireland. He would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably have been advanced to higher employments, if he had lived; but he died at his houſe in London, upon the 24th of March 1698, in the 45th year of his age. He was father of the late ſir John Evelyn, who was born at Sayes-Court upon the 2d of March 1681, and created a baronet by letters patent, bearing date July 30th, 1713. This gentleman's productions in the literary way were, 1.
"Of Gardens, four books, firſt written in Latin verſe by Renatus Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinus, and now made Engliſh by John Evelyn, <abbr>eſq</abbr>"
1673, 8vo. Conſidering how much he muſt have been obliged to hear of gardens and plantations, we need not wonder that he ſhould employ himſelf upon this ſubject. His father an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed the ſecond book of this tranſlation to his Sylva. 2.
"The life of Alexander the Great, tranſlated from the Greek of Plutarch."
This was printed in the fourth volume of Plutarch's Lives by ſeveral hands. 3.
"The hiſtory of the grand viſiers, Mahomet and Achmet Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>progli; of the three laſt grand ſeigniors, their ſultanas, and chief favourites; with the moſt ſecret intrigues of the ſeraglio."
1677, 8vo. This was a tranſlation from the French, and has been eſteemed an entertaining and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive hiſtory. He was alſo author of ſeveral occaſional poems, the beſt of which are here preſerved. N.</note>, ESQ.</byline>

"Norfolk Drollery; or, a compleat col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the neweſt ſongs, jovial poems, and catches, &amp;c. 1673."
His head was engraved by Gaywood, with the following inſcription, preſerved in Mr. Walpole's Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of engravers:

                     <l>" The printer's profit, not my pride,</l>

Theſe lines have miſled Mr. Granger, who too haſtily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that the facetious author muſt of courſe have been a <hi>dramatic</hi> writer. His "Merry Play" was evidently no other than his "Norfolk Drollery." Though very poſſibly he poſſeſſed a

            <byline>BY MR. JOSEPH HALL<note n="†" place="bottom">The reader is here preſented with a beautiful poem, at preſent entirely unknown, by the ingenious and learned di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine who early in life diſtinguiſhed himſelf by his
"Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demiarum, Satires in ſix books, 1597" (reprinted at Oxford 1753, 8vo).
He was born and educated at Aſhby-de-la-Zouch; and at 15 was ſent to Emanuel College, Cambridge, where he regularly obtained his degrees and a fellowſhip, and read the rhetoric lecture in the public ſchools for two years with great applauſe. In the prologue to the
"Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demiarum," he calls himſelf the firſt ſatyriſt in the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh language;
<q>
                     <l>" I firſt adventure; follow me who liſt,</l>

About 1596 he was preſented to the rectory of Halſted in Suffolk, and ſoon after married a wiſe with whom he lived happily 49 years. In 1605, he accompanied ſir Edward Bacon to the Spa, where he compoſed his ſecond
"Century of Meditations."
In 1612, he took the degree of D.D. obtained the donative of Waltham Holy Croſs in Eſſex, and a little before had been made chaplain to prince Henry; was made a prebendary of the collegiate church of Wolve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He was committed to the Tower on the 30th of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary, whence in June 1642 he was releaſed on giving 5000l. bail. Withdrawing to Norwich, he lived there in tolerable quiet till April 1643. But then, the order for ſequeſtering no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious delinquents being paſſed, in which he was included by name, all his rents were ſtopped, and he had nothing to live on but what the parliament allowed him; all the while ſuffering the greateſt inconveniences, which he has given an account of in a piece, intitled his "Hard Meaſure." In the year 1647, he retired to a little eſtate, which he rented at Higham near Norwich; and in this retirement he ended his life on the 8th of September 1656, in the 82d year of his age. He was buried in the church-yard of that pariſh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any memorial: for in his will he has this paſſage,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"I do not hold God's houſe a meet repoſitory for the dead bodies of the greateſt faints."</q>
He is univerſally allowed to have been a man of great wit and learning, and of as great meekneſs, modeſty, and piety. He was ſo great a lover of ſtudy, that he earneſtly wiſhed his health would have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him to do it even to exceſs. His works, beſides the Satires above-mentioned, make in all five volumes in folio and quarto; and
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"are filled, ſays Mr. Bayle, with fine thoughts, excellent morality, and a great deal of piety."</q>
His writings ſhew, that he was very zealous againſt popery; neither was he more favourable to thoſe who ſeparated from the mother-church without an extreme neceſſity. He la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the diviſions of proteſtants, and wrote ſomething with a view of putting an end to them. N.</note>.</byline>

            <l>OF all heaven's judgments, that was ſure the worſt,</l>
            <l>When our bold fathers were at Babel curſt:</l>
            <l>Man, to whoſe race this glorious orb was given,</l>
            <l>Nature's lov'd darling, and the joy of heaven,</l>
            <l>Whoſe powerful voice the ſubject world obey'd,</l>
            <l>And gods were pleas'd with the diſcourſe he made;</l>
            <l>He, who before did every form excel,</l>
            <l>Beneath the moſt ignoble creature fell:</l>
            <l>Every vile beaſt through the wide earth can rove,</l>
            <l>And, where the ſenſe invites, declare his love!</l>

            <l>And one ſhort language ſerves for every place:</l>
            <l>But ſuch a price did that preſumption coſt,</l>
            <l>That half our lives in trifling words are loſt.</l>
            <l>Nor can their utmoſt force and power expreſs</l>
            <l>The ſoul's ideas in their native dreſs.</l>
            <l>Knowledge, that godlike orn'ment of the mind,</l>
            <l>To the ſmall ſpot where it is born 's confin'd.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:0771900502:158"/>But he, brave youth, the toilſome fate repeals,</l>
            <l>While his learn'd pen myſterious truth reveals.</l>
            <l>So did, of old, the cloven tongues deſcend;</l>
            <l>And Heaven's commands to every ear extend.</l>
            <l>And 'twas but juſt that all th' aſtoniſh'd throng</l>
            <l>Should underſtand the Galileans tongue,</l>
            <l>God's ſacred law was for all Iſrael made;</l>
            <l>And in plain terms, to every tribe diſplay'd.</l>
            <l>On marble pillars, his Almighty hands,</l>
            <l>In letters large, wrote the divine commands:</l>
            <l>But ſcarce they were ſo much in pieces broke,</l>
            <l>When Moſes' wrath the people did provoke,</l>
            <l>As has the ſacred cowl been torn and rent,</l>
            <l>T' explain what the All-wiſe Dictator meant.</l>
            <l>But now, t' our Egypt the great Prophet 's come;</l>
            <l>And eloquent Aaron tells the joyful doom.</l>
            <l>From the worſt ſlavery at laſt we 're freed,</l>
            <l>And ſhall no more with ſtripes from error bleed;</l>
            <l>The learned Simon has th' hard taſk ſubdued;</l>
            <l>And holy tables the third time renew'd.</l>
            <l>Sinai be bleſs'd, where was receiv'd the law</l>
            <l>That ought to keep the rebel world in awe;</l>
            <l>And bleſs'd be he that taught us to invoke</l>
            <l>God's awful name, as God to Moſes ſpoke.</l>
            <l>Nor does he merit leſs, who could ſo well</l>
            <l>From foreign language his great dictates tell:</l>
            <l>In our cold clime the pregnant ſoul lay hid;</l>
            <l>No virtual power mov'd the prolific ſeed,</l>
            <l>Till his kind genial heat preſerv'd it warm;</l>
            <l>And to perfection wrought the noble form.</l>

            <l>But he, at laſt, a full return has made.</l>
            <l>Raiſe up, ye tuneful bards, your voices raiſe,</l>

            <l>And all ye Nimrod's mighty ſons rejoice,</l>
            <l>While ev'ry workman knows the builder's voice.</l>
            <l>In Shinar's plain the lofty tower may riſe,</l>

            <l>In its own nature Truth is ſo divine,</l>
            <l>No ſacred powers oppoſe this great deſign;</l>
            <l>So dark a veil obſcur'd her reverend head,</l>
            <l>The wiſeſt travellers knew not where to tread,</l>
            <l>Blind zeal and mad enthuſiaſts ſhew'd the way,</l>

From this period he wrote many poems; but thoſe, though excellent in their kind (and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, it is ſaid, to have filled at leaſt ſix volumes) were loſt to the world, by being introduced with no advantage. He had ſo ſtrong a propenſity to groveling, that his acquaintance were generally of ſuch a caſt as could be of no ſervice to him; and thoſe in higher life he addreſſed by letters, not having ſufficient confidence or politeneſs to converſe familiarly with them; a freedom to which he was intitled by the power of his genius. His genius was not confined to poetry only; but he had a taſte for painting, muſic, and heraldry, with the latter of which he was well acquainted. Many of his poems are in the Gent. Mag. ſigned Y. and Alceus. In 1743 he publiſhed his "Albion's Triumph," an ode on the battle of Dettingen; and in or about 1745 wrote an admirable poem called "The Deity," which Mr. Pope declared, on its publication, contained many lines of which he ſhould not be aſhamed.

A cupola was deſigned 30 feet higher than the roof, which would have been ſeen at ſea; and a ſtreet was intended leading from the Weſt end of the chathedral to the centre of the front. The length of the whole is 328 feet. A park was alſo projected ten miles in circumference; but the death of the king pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the progreſs and execution of this noble plan. The palace is at preſent converted into a commodious priſon for French priſoners of war. See Warton's Deſcription of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter, p. 11. N.</note>.</head>

            <head>THE COURT-PROSPECT.</head>
            <byline>BY MR. CHARLES HOPKINS<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Son of Ezekiel biſhop of Londonderry (who married the lady Araminta one of the 4 daughters of John lord Robartes of Truro afterwards earl of Radnor). He was born at Exeter; but, his father being taken chaplain to Ireland by lord Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bartes when lord lieutenant in 1669, our poet received the early part of his education at Trinity College, Dublin; and afterwards was a ſtudent at Cambridge. On the rebellion in Ireland in 1688, he returned thither, and exerted his early valour in the cauſe of his country, religion, and liberty. When public tranquillity was reſtored, he came again into England, and fell into an acquaintance with gentlemen of the beſt wit, whoſe age and genius were moſt agreeable to his own. In 1694 he publiſhed ſome
"Epiſtolary Poems and Tranſlations," which will all be inſerted in this volume; and in 1695 he ſhewed his genius as a dramatic writer by "Pyrrhus king of Egypt," a tragedy, to which Mr. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greve wrote the epilogue (ſee Engliſh Poets, vol. XXIX. p. 84).
He publiſhed that year "The Hiſtory of Love," a connexion of ſelect fables from Ovid's Metamorphoſes, 1695; which, by the ſweetneſs of his numbers and eaſineſs of his thoughts, procured him conſiderable reputation. With Mr. Dryden in particular he became a great favourite. He after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards publiſhed the "Art of Love," which, Jacob ſays,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"added to his fame, and happily brought him acquainted with the earl of Dorſet and other perſons of diſtinction, who were fond of his company, through the agreeableneſs of his temper and the pleaſantry of his converſation. It was in his power to have made his fortune in any ſcene of life; but he was always more ready to ſerve others than mindful of his own affairs; and, by the exceſſes of hard drinking, and a too paſſionate fondneſs for the fair ſex, he died a martyr to the cauſe in the 36th year of his age."</q>
I ſhall preſerve in this collection an admirable Hymn
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten about an hour before his death, when in great pain."</q>
His "Court-Proſpect," in which many of the principal no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility are very handſomely complimented, is called by Jacob <q rend="inline">"an excellent piece;"</q> and of his other poems he adds,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"that they are all remarkable for the purity of their diction, and the harmony of their numbers."</q>
Mr. Hopkins was alſo the author of two other tragedies;
"Boadicea Queen of Britain," 1697;
and
"Friendſhip improved, or the Female Warrior," with a humorous prologue, comparing a poet to a merchant, a compariſon which will hold in moſt part<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>culars except that of accumulating wealth.
Our author, who was at Londonderry when this tragedy came out, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed it to Edward Coke of Norfolk, eſquire, in a dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, dated Nov. 1. 1699, ſo modeſt and pathetic that I am perſuaded I ſhall ſtand excuſed if I print it at full length:<q rend="inline">
                        <p>"The greateſt, and indeed almoſt the only, advantage a poet reaps from what he writes, is the opportunities he meets with of making himſelf known to the beſt and greateſt men of his age. A play is firſt made public in the theatre; and when it comes to the preſs, if any one has ſpoken kindly and favourably of it in the repreſentation, the poet chooſes him for his patron, he having before (according to the author's conſtruction) choſen him for his poet. The diſtance I am at from the city, and even from the kingdom too, will keep me ignorant for ſome time what ſucceſs this play (which I humbly offer to your patronage) may meet with. If the town is pleaſed with it, I ſhall be pleaſed with myſelf for pleaſing them; if they condemn it, I ſhall be apt to conclude ſo many in the right, rather than my ſingle ſelf. You ſaw it in manuſcript; and I have this early and auſpicious advantage, that you approve of it. Boadicea pleaſed them; and I received a very great additional ſatisfaction, when I underſtood how particularly it pleaſed you. I will not go to compare that play and this together, nor follow the cuſtom of reckoning the laſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance beſt, and ſhewing the greateſt fondneſs of the youngeſt brat. The rhyme was the only thing that recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended that; and, for aught I know, the only thing too that can recommend this. I could wiſh for ſomething diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing in it, becauſe it is ſacred to you, and I ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be known to you at advantage. If the pains in writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will endear it to you, it coſt me much more than the former. It has ſome ſort of deſign beſides (ſuch as it is); but I was never very guilty of plotting. I can hardly keep the characters in my play from being as honeſt and ſincere as I would be myſelf in a dedication. A vicious character diſturbs me while I draw it, and it grates me to delineate a villain. 'Tis certain no poet can excite any paſſion in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if he does not feel it firſt in himſelf. Who then will chooſe to deſcribe diſcontent, envy, or revenge, when they may have ſuch fair fields as honour and virtue to range in? All there is bright before them, and the flight the Muſe takes the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Such characters, artfully and juſtly drawn, will excite the good and great to be patrons; and ſuch patrons as you, Sir, will ſoon teach poets to draw ſuch characters. You are endowed with all the bleſſings of Nature and Fortune; and you are as liberal of the gifts of the latter to others, as ſhe has been to you. So great is your eſtate, it would be unwieldy to have it more; and ſuch good uſe is made of it, that Envy does not wiſh it leſs. It is not conſumed in vain and ſuperfluous equipage; but laid out in maintaining the old, open Engliſh hoſpitality. Deſert in want is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied; and Honeſty in diſtreſs is ſuccoured and ſuſtained; great without titles, and good above greatneſs; rich, rather to others than yourſelf; and ſeeming only as your own ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard. Your inclinations and endeavours are the general good of mankind; and none ever went from you diſſatisfied; delighted in obliging others, and pleaſed to ſee them pleaſed with your bounty. Wiſhing the welfare of all men, and ſpeaking well of all men, is a ſure way to meet with an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal return of good will and good wiſhes. He doubly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys his fortune, who has it wiſhed double by all that know him. Among the prayers of others, accept of the praiſes of the poet; humbly and heartily, though feebly, offered. I now begin to experience how much the mind may be influenced by the body. My Muſe is confined, at preſent, to a weak and ſickly tenement; and the winter ſeaſon will go near to over-bear her, together with her houſhold. There are ſtorms and tempeſts to beat her down, or froſts to bind her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

He was afterwards elected preacher at one of the city churches; but the biſhop of London refuſed to admit him, as he was a popular preacher among the Fanatics. He then obtained St. Mary's church at Exeter, was countenanced by biſhop Ward, and much admired for the comelineſs of his perſon and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of preaching. The lord Robartes in particular was ſo pleaſed with him that he gave him one of his daughters in marriage, took him chaplain to Ireland in 1669, gave him the deanry of Raphoe, and recommended him ſo effectually to his ſucceſſor lord Berkeley, that he was conſecrated biſhop of Raphoe October 27, 1671, and tranſlated to Londonderry in 1681. Driven thence by the forces under the earl of Tyrconnel in 1688, he retired into England, and was elected miniſter of Aldermanbury in September 1689, where he died on the 19th of June 1690. He publiſhed expoſitions on the Lord's Prayer and Ten Commandments, and five ſingle Sermons. N.</note>. Thus the thanks for paſt favours are only petitions for more; as ſome men

               <p>SOME writers perhaps may expect the thanks and favour of the nobility, after attempting their praiſe; but I am rather afraid of having incurred their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure; they whom I have mentioned, I doubt, may with more reaſon find fault with me, than they whom I have omitted; for it is better not to be drawn at all, than to be drawn imperfectly and lamely. The poet, however, has the ſame excuſe with the painter; that art cannot equal nature; nor the pencil, nor the pen, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent a copy that comes up to her original. The buſineſs of a poet is to pleaſe; and he is very unhappy who gives offence where he deſigns acknowledgments or reſpects. The whole body of the nobility of England would be a boundleſs ſubject; painters own they find it more difficult to give a true and lively air and poſture to a picture; to place the legs, and duly proportion all the parts, than to draw the face, and take the likeneſs: but this piece was only intended for an half-length, and that too is only a rough draught, and in miniature. Though the following lines may want an excuſe with the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0771900502:192"/>
I will not deſpair of pardon from the nobles to whom it was deſigned; and if I have failed in deſcribing their greatneſs, I have at the ſame time given them an opportunity of ſhewing their goodneſs.</p>

                     <l>The ſight of her own goddeſs makes her bold.</l>
                     <l>She comes—o'er fields of ſtanding corn ſhe walks,</l>
                     <l>Not cruſh'd the tender ears, nor bent the ſtalks;</l>
                     <l>Her march attended with a numerous train,</l>

            <head>TO WALTER MOYLE<note n="*" place="bottom">This ingenious writer was born in Cornwall, 1672. After paſſing ſome years at Oxford, he was removed to the Temple, where he entered deeply into the nobler parts of the law;
<q rend="inline margQuotes">("for there was a drudgery, ſays Mr. Hammond, in the law-lucrative, which he could not ſubmit to.")</q>
Here firſt he formed an intimacy with Dryden, Hammond, Hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins, and other contemporary wits. He was for ſome time a member of parliament, where he always acted a very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and diſintereſted part; and afterwards retired to his ſeat at Bake in Cornwall, where he applied himſelf very diligently to ſtudy; and died June 9, 1721. Two volumes of his poſt humous writings were publiſhed in 1726; and thoſe he had printed in his life-time were collected in 1727 by his friend Mr. Hammond, who wrote his Life. N.</note>, ESQ.</head>

                  <p>To this gentleman Mr. Hopkins inſcribed his

                        </gap>ication written to a book, but a book written to a dedication; which, however, is the niceſt part a writer has to manage; for the moſt deſerving men are the moſt averſe to be told ſo, and what would pleaſe all their friends and acquaintance would diſpleaſe themſelves; which makes the poet at a loſs whether to diſſatisfy one or many, his readers or his patron. But, ſince I have already found it eaſier to you to oblige, than to receive thanks for an obligation; to do no violence to your modeſty, I muſt do one to my own juſtice, and deſiſt from a theme which I could ſo willingly enlarge upon, but you ſo unwillingly read. I ſhall ſay little of the following eſſays, either of the originals I tranſlated them from, or the tranſlations: one thing in general I find from my own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; that where there is moſt life and ſpirit in the author, the tranſlator is carried on with the greater vigour and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity, as a man ſwims faſter in a ſtream than a ſtanding water; but where the original is flat and low, the tranſlator muſt be at the pains to raiſe him; ſo that the beſt things are the eaſieſt to be done, and the dulleſt the moſt difficult. It were preſumption in one of my years, to pretend to give an account of the authors whom I have choſen, or their works; to commend their excellences, or condemn their faults: and of the two, I dare venture to ſay the leaſt of Ovid; when he himſelf, and all that he has written, have been already ſo well and ſo fully treated of in Mr. Dryden's preface before his epiſtles. But I cannot chooſe but wonder, that a book ſo extremely delightful, ſo ſoft and ſweet, as Tibullus, has lain ſo long unattempted; but there is a friend of ours, whom I hope he has been all along reſerved for, and then he will be in the beſt hands he could have fallen into. Of the three ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies that I have ventured on, the firſt, from toward the middle to the end, and the whole third, pleaſed me infinitely; the ſecond I did merely for the ſake of the laſt ten or twelve lines. Tibullus moſt, certainly, have felt all he wrote, for he could never have feigned ſo much paſſion ſo well; and I am apt to believe it was not his poetry made him ſo fond and tender a lover, but rather his love that made him ſo ſweet and excellent a poet. Were it not that I ſhould take him out of better hands, I would have attempted to have engliſhed him all; for I flatter myſelf with a fancy, that, in ſome things, I am ſomewhat of his temper; and how far ſhort ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I come or him in his poetry, I reſemble him but too nearly in ſome other circumſtances. I was almoſt running into a complaint, that would have been both unjuſt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful; for, ſince I knew you, all occaſion of complaint has been taken from me. Your acquaintance would have been of itſelf ſufficient to endear you to any man; but your favours to me began with, and even out-ran, your acquaintance. I dare not proceed, though on a ſubject which I am very loth to leave; permit me to add only this, that ſince moſt who ever wrote have ſometimes ſtood in need of favours from other men, and ſince the ſame fortune has attended me, I am glad, however, that it threw me on you to receive them, than whom I know none I could have been more willingly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to for them.

I have borrowed the examples to every paſſion from thoſe ſtories which I thought the moſt pleaſing in Ovid, where certainly the moſt pleaſing were to be met with: ſome few places in every ſtory I have tranſlated, but for the moſt part I have only kept him in view; I have gone on with him and left him where I thought it proper, and by that means have avoided the abſurdities of his Metamorphoſes; ſave only that of Pigmalion's ſtatue, but that was a Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſis that pleaſed me. It was a delightful ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize to ſee life breathed into an inanimate beauty, as it would be a killing affliction to ſee it taken away from one already animated: it would occaſion as much joy and wonder to have a Dutcheſs of GRAFTON made by Art (if Art could do it) as it would cauſe conſternation to have the Gods unmake one. But thoſe miracles of

Art are now ceaſed; and none but the Heavenly Artiſt could have drawn you, who has drawn you ſo that he has left the painter and the poet at a loſs to copy you. As to the ſucceſs of this poem, I hope I am ſecure, ſince it is ſacred in general to the Fair Sex, and committed in particular to the protection of the Faireſt. If they are once pleaſed, who will dare to find fault? or diſoblige them by diſliking what they approve? Under the ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of your Grace's patronage I ſhall ſtand, like Aeneas, guarded by the Goddeſs of Love; and no Diomedes ſhall be found as deſperate as the firſt to wound me through you. Thus, as all dedicating poets, who write more to raiſe their own reputation than their patrons, I have taken the moſt effectual means to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh mine; and doubt not to make a ſtrong party, ſince every Lover will defend what is ſacred to the Lovely. Your Grace's moſt devoted, moſt humble ſervant,</p>

            <head>AN EPISTLE TO A FRIEND;</head>
            <byline>BY MR. JOHN HOPKINS<note n="*" place="bottom">Another ſon of the good biſhop of Londonderry; born Jan. 1, 1675. Like his elder brother, his poetry was princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally on ſubjects of Love; like him too, his proſpects in life appear to have terminated unfortunately. He publiſhed in 1698
"The Triumphs of Peace, or the Glories of Naſſau; a pindarie poem occaſioned by the concluſion of the peace between the Confederacy and France; written at the time of his grace the duke of Ormond's entrance into Dublin."
<q rend="inline">"The deſign of this poem, the author ſays in his preface, begins, after the method of Pindar, to one great man, and riſes to another; firſt touches the duke, then celebrates the actions of the king, and ſo returns to the praiſes of the duke again."</q>—But the principal performance of Mr. J. Hopkins was
"Amaſia, or the Works of the Muſes, a collection of poems in three volumes, 1700."
Each of theſe little vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes is divided into three books, and each book is inſcribed to ſome beautiful patroneſs; amongſt whom the dutcheſs of Grafton ſtands foremoſt. The laſt book is inſcribed
"To the memory of Amaſia," whom he addreſſes throughout theſe volumes in the character of Sylvius.
There is a vein of ſeriouſneſs, if not of poetry, runs through the whole perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Many of Ovid's ſtories are very decently imitated; <q rend="inline">"moſt of them, he ſays, have been very well performed by my brother, and publiſhed ſome years ſince; mine were written in another kingdom before I knew of his."</q> In one of his dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations he tells the lady Olimpia Robartes, <q rend="inline">"Your ladyſhip's father, the late earl of Radnor, when governor of Ireland, was the kind patron to mine: he raiſed him to the firſt ſteps by which he afterwards aſcended to the dignities he bore; to thoſe, which rendered his labours more conſpi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Theſe, and yet greater temporal honours, your family heaped on him, by making even me in ſome ſort related and allied to you, by his inter-marriage with your ſiſter the lady Araminta. How imprudent a vanity is it in me to boaſt a father ſo meritorious! how may I be aſhamed to prove myſelf his ſon, by poetry, that only qualification he ſo much excelled in, but yet eſteemed no excellence. I bring but a bad proof of birth, laying my claim in that only thing he would not own. Theſe are, however, Madam, but the products of immaturer years; and riper age may, I hope, bring forth more ſolid works."</q>—I have never ſeen any other of his writings; nor have been able to collect any farther particulars of his life, but have a portrait of him under his poetical name of Sylvius.

            <head>SONG,</head>
            <byline>BY LORD CUTTS<note n="*" place="bottom">A ſoldier of moſt hardy bravery in king William's wars. He was ſon of Richard Cutts, eſq. of Matching in Eſſex, where the family were ſettled about the time of Henry the ſixth, and had a great eſtate. He entered early into the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the duke of Monmouth, was aid-de-camp to the Duke of Lorrain in Hungary, and ſignalized himſelf in a very extraordinary manner at the taking of Buda by the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts in 1686; which important place had been for near a century and a half in the hands of the Turks. Mr. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſon, in a Latin poem worthy of the Auguſtan age, (Muſae Anglicanae, Vol. II. p. 2,) plainly hints at Mr. Cutts's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed bravery at that ſiege. Returning to England at the Revolution, he had a regiment of foot; was created Baron of Gowran in Ireland, Dec. 6, 1699; appointed Governor of the Iſle of Wight, April 14, 1693; was made a Major-ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; and, when the aſſaſſination project was diſcovered, 1695-6, was captain of the King's guard. He was Colonel of the Coldſtream, or ſecond regiment of guards, in 1701; when Mr. Steele, who was indebted to his intereſt for a mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary commiſſion, inſcribed to him his firſt work,
"The Chriſtian Hero."
On the Acceſſion of Queen Anne, he was made a Lieutenant-general of the forces in Holland; Commander in Chief of the forces in Ireland, under the Duke of Ormond, March 23, 1704-5; and afterwards one of the Lords Juſtices of that kingdom, to keep him out of the way of action, a circumſtance which broke his heart. He died at Dublin, Jan. 26, 1706-7, and is buried there in the cathedral of Chriſt Church. He wrote a poem on the Death of Q. Mary (which is printed among the Court Poems); and publiſhed, in 1687, "Poetical Exerciſes, written upon ſeveral occaſions, and dedicated to her royal highneſs Mary princeſs of Orange; licenſed March 23, 1686-7, Roger L'Eſtrange." It contains, beſides the dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ſigned J. Cutts, verſes to that princeſs; a poem on wiſdom, another to Mr Waller on his commending it; ſeven more copies of verſes (one of them called
"La Muſe Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier,"
which has been aſcribed to Lord Peterborough, and as ſuch mentioned by Mr. Walpole in the liſt of that nobleman's writings) and eleven ſongs; the whole compoſing but a very thin volume; which is by no means ſo ſcarce as Mr. Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pole ſuppoſes it to be. The author ſpeaks of having more pieces by him. N.</note>.</byline>

VIII. p. 183, Mr. Waller's verſes on the Elegy here printed; and in p. 229, another copy on Mrs. Wharton's "Paraphraſe on the Lord's Prayer." His two cantos of Divine Poeſy, p. 223, were "occaſioned upon ſight of the 53d chapter of Iſaiah, turned into verſe "by Mrs. Wharton." Her "Verſes to Mr. Waller" are mentioned by Ballard; and her tranſlation of "Penelope to Ulyſſes" is printed in Tonſon's edition of Ovid's Epiſtles. In 1681, ſhe was in France on account of her health, as appears from ſeveral letters to her huſband; about 1682, ſhe held a correſpondence by letters with Dr. Gilbert Burnet, many of which are made public. Dr. Burnet wrote ſeveral poems, which he ſent her. She died at Adderbury, Oct. 29, 1685; and was buried at Winchenden. N.</note>.</byline>

               <l>The fear of Death is by our folly brought,</l>
