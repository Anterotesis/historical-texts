            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <lg>
                  <l>A Grove there was, by nature made,</l>
                  <l>Of trees that form'd a pleaſing ſhade;</l>
                  <l>Where warbled, ever free from care,</l>
                  <l>The wing'd muſicians of the air.</l>
                  <l>Here tun'd the Nightingale her throat;</l>
                  <l>The Thruſh there thrill'd her piercing note;</l>
                  <l>The Finch, Lark, Linnet, all agree</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>Two amorous Sparrows choſe this place;</l>
                  <l>The ſofteſt of the feather'd race:</l>

                  <l>Leſs fam'd for ſinging than for love.</l>
                  <l>The ſongſters warbled ſweet; while they</l>
                  <l>As ſweetly bill'd their time away.</l>
                  <l>So cloſely ſeated were the two,</l>

                  <l>The twig was tender where they ſate,</l>
                  <l>And bent beneath their little weight;</l>

                     <pb n="206" facs="tcp:0646900203:208"/>But ſcarcely in their lives was known</l>

                  <l>The caſtle, where theſe lovers lay;</l>
                  <l>Was in a hollow oak, they ſay:</l>

               <l>IN this ſmall work, all nature's wonders ſee,</l>
               <l>The ſoften'd features of philoſophy.</l>
               <l>In truth by eaſy ſteps you here advance,</l>
               <l>Truth is diverting, as the beſt romance.</l>
               <l>Long had theſe arts to ſages been confin'd,</l>
               <l>None ſaw their beauty, till by poring blind;</l>
               <l>By ſtudying ſpent, like men that cram too full,</l>
               <l>From Wiſdom's feaſt they roſe not chear'd, but dull:</l>
               <l>The gay and airy ſmil'd to ſee 'em grave,</l>
               <l>And fled ſuch wiſdom like Trophonius' cave.</l>
               <l>Juſtly they thought they might thoſe arts deſpiſe,</l>
               <l>Which made men ſullen, ere they could be wiſe.</l>

               <l>Tho' deep the bottom, yet the ſtream is clear.</l>
               <l>Your flutt'ring ſex ſtill valued ſcience leſs;</l>
               <l>Careleſs of any but the arts of dreſs.</l>
               <l>Their uſeleſs time was idly thrown away</l>
               <l>On empty novels, or ſome new-born play;</l>
               <l>The beſt, perhaps, a few looſe hours might ſpare</l>
               <l>For ſome unmeaning thing, miſcall'd a pray'r.</l>
               <l>In vain the glitt'ring orbs, each ſtarry night,</l>
               <l>With mingling blazes ſhed a flood of light:</l>
               <l>Each nymph with cold indiff'rence ſaw 'em riſe;</l>
               <l>And, taught by fops, to them preferr'd her eyes.</l>
               <l>None thought the ſtars were ſuns ſo widely ſown,</l>
               <l>None dreamt of other worlds, beſides our own.</l>
               <l>Well might they boaſt their charms, when ev'ry fair</l>
               <l>Thought this world all; and her's the brighteſt here.</l>
               <l>Ah! quit not the large thoughts this book inſpires,</l>
               <l>For thoſe thin trifles which your ſex admires:</l>

               <l>That reaſon is not to themſelves confin'd.</l>

               <l>Who thought ſo greatly of her eyes before,</l>
               <l>Bid her read this, and then be vain no more.</l>
               <l>How poor ev'n you, who reign without controul,</l>
               <l>If we except the beauties of your ſoul!</l>

                              <p n="1">
                                 <hi>1ſt,</hi> By the general tenor of his eſſays on <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> and the <hi>freedom of wit and humour,</hi> it appears that his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal deſign was to recommend the <hi>way of ridicule,</hi> (as he calls it) for the <hi>inveſtigation</hi> of truth, and <hi>detection</hi> of falſehood, not only in <hi>moral</hi> but <hi>religious</hi> ſubjects.</p>
                              <p n="2">
                                 <hi>2dly,</hi> It appears no leſs evident, that in the courſe of his reaſonings on this queſtion, he confounds two things which are in their nature and conſequences entirely different. Theſe are <hi>ridicule</hi> and <hi>good-humour:</hi> the latter acknowledged by all to be the beſt <hi>mediator</hi> in every debate; the former no leſs regarded by moſt, as an <hi>embroiler</hi> and <hi>incendiary.</hi> Tho' he ſets out with a formal profeſſion of proving the efficacy of wit, humour, and ridicule, in the inveſtigation of truth, yet by ſhifting and mixing his terms, he generally ſlides inſenſibly into mere encomiums on good-breeding, chearfulneſs, urbanity, and free enquiry. This indeed keeps ſomething like an argument on foot, and amuſes the ſuperficial reader; but to a more obſervant eye diſcovers a very contemptible defect, either of ſincerity or penetration.</p>
                              <p>The queſtion concerning ridicule may be thus not improperly ſtated, <hi>Whether doubtful propoſitions of any kind can be determined by the application of ridicule?</hi> Much might be ſaid on this queſtion; but a few words will make the matter clear to an unprejudiced mind.</p>
                              <p>The diſapprobation or contempt which certain objects raiſe in the mind of man, is a particular mode of paſſion. The objects of this paſſion are <hi>apparent</hi> falſehood, incongruity, or impropriety of ſome particular kinds. Thus, the object of <hi>fear</hi> is <hi>apparent</hi> danger: the object of <hi>anger</hi> is <hi>apparent</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury. But who hath ever dreamt of exalting the paſſions of fear and anger into a <hi>ſtandard</hi> or <hi>teſt</hi> of <hi>real</hi> danger and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury? The deſign muſt have been rejected as abſurd, becauſe it is the work of reaſon <hi>only,</hi> to correct and fix the paſſions on their proper objects. The caſe is parallel: <hi>apparent</hi> or <hi>ſeeming</hi> falſehoods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are the objects of contempt; but it is the work of reaſon <hi>only,</hi> to determine whether the <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed</hi> falſehood be <hi>real</hi> or <hi>fictitious.</hi> But it is ſaid,
<q>The <hi>ſenſe of ridicule</hi> can never be miſtaken.</q>
—Why, no more can the <hi>ſenſe of danger,</hi> or the <hi>ſenſe of injury.</hi>— "What, do men never <hi>fear</hi> or <hi>reſent</hi> without reaſon?"— Yes, very commonly: but they as often <hi>deſpiſe</hi> and <hi>laugh</hi> without reaſon. Thus before any thing can be determined in either caſe, reaſon, and reaſon only, muſt examine circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, ſeparate ideas, decide upon, reſtrain, and correct the paſſion.</p>
                              <p>Hence it follows, that the way of <hi>ridicule,</hi> of late ſo much celebrated, is in fact no more than a ſpecies of elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; and that too the <hi>loweſt</hi> of all others: ſo <hi>Tully</hi> juſtly calls it, <hi>tenuiſſimus ingenii fructus.</hi> It applies to a paſſion, and therefore can go no farther in the inveſtigation of truth, than any of thoſe arts which tend to raiſe love, pity, terror, rage or hatred in the heart of man. Conſequently, his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip might have tranſplanted the whole <hi>ſyſtem of rhetorick</hi> into his new ſcheme, with the ſame propriety as he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced the <hi>way of ridicule</hi> itſelf. A hopeful project this, for the propagation of truth!</p>
                              <p>As this ſeems to be the real nature of ridicule, it hath been generally diſcouraged by <hi>philoſophers</hi> and <hi>divines,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with every other mode of eloquence, when applied to <hi>controverted opinions.</hi> This diſcouragement, from what is ſaid above, appears to have been rational and juſt: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the charge laid againſt <hi>divines</hi> with regard to this affair by a zealous admirer of Lord <hi>Shaftſbury</hi> (ſee a note on the <hi>Pleaſures of Imagination, Book III.)</hi> ſeems entirely ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. The diſtinction which the ſame author hath attempted with reſpect to the influence of ridicule, between <hi>ſpeculative</hi> and <hi>moral</hi> truths, ſeems no better founded.
