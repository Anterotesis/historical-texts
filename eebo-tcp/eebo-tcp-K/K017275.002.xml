            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>"MAMMA," ſaid Roſamond, after a long ſilence, "do you know, what I have been thinking of all this time?"</p>
            <p>"No, my dear.—What?"</p>
            <p>"Why, mamma, about my couſin Bell's birth-day; do you know what day it is?"</p>
            <p>"No, I don't remember."</p>
            <p>"Dear mother! don't you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member its the 22d of December; and her birth-day is the day after to - morrow?—Don't you recollect now? But you never remember
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1291100302:3"/>about birth-days, mamma: that was juſt what I was thinking of, that you never remember my ſiſter Laura's birth-day, or—or—or <hi>mine,</hi> mamma."</p>
            <p>"What do you mean, my dear? I remember your birth-day perfectly well."</p>
            <p>"Indeed! but you never <hi>keep</hi> it though."</p>
            <p>"What do you mean by keeping your birth-day?"</p>
            <p>"Oh, mamma, you know very well—as Bell's birth-day is kept.—In the firſt place there is a great dinner."</p>
            <p>"And can Bell eat more upon her birth-day than upon any other day?"</p>
            <p>"No; nor I ſhould not mind about the dinner, except the mince pies. But Bell has a great many nice things; I don't mean nice eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1291100302:4"/>things, but nice new playthings given to her always on her birth-day; and every body drinks her health, and ſhe's ſo happy."</p>
            <p>"But ſtay, Roſamond, how you jumble things together! Is it every body's drinking her health that makes her ſo happy; or the new playthings, or the nice mince pies? I can eaſily believe that ſhe is happy whilſt ſhe is eating a mince pie, or whilſt ſhe is playing; but how does every body's drinking her health at dinner make her happy?"</p>
            <p>Roſamond pauſed, and then ſaid ſhe did not know. "But," added ſhe, "the <hi>nice new</hi> playthings, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther!"</p>
            <p>"But why the nice <hi>new</hi> play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things? Did you like them only becauſe they were <hi>new?"</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:1291100302:5"/>
"Not <hi>only—I</hi> do not like play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things <hi>only</hi> becauſe they are new, but Bell <hi>does</hi> I believe—for that puts me in mind—Do you know, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhe had a great drawer full of <hi>old</hi> playthings that ſhe never uſed, and ſhe ſaid that they were good for nothing becauſe they were <hi>old;</hi> but I thought many of them were good for a great deal more than the new ones.—Now you ſhall be judge, mamma; I'll tell you all that was in the drawer."</p>
            <p>"Nay, Roſamond, thank you, not juſt now; I have not time to liſten to you."</p>
            <p>"Well then, mamma, the day after to-morrow I can ſhew you the drawer: I want you to be judge very much, becauſe I am ſure I was in the right.—And, mother," added Roſamond, ſtopping her as ſhe was
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1291100302:6"/>going out of the room, "will you—not not now, but when you've time—will you tell me why you never keep my birth-day—why you never make any difference between that day and any other day?"</p>
            <p>"And will you, Roſamond—not now, but when you have time to think about it—tell me why I ſhould make any difference between your birth-day and any other day?"</p>
            <p>Roſamond thought—but ſhe could not find out any reaſon: beſides, ſhe ſuddenly recollected that ſhe had not time to think any longer, for there was a certain work baſket to be finiſhed, which ſhe was making for her couſin Bell, as a preſent upon her birth-day. The work was at a ſtand for want of ſome filigree paper, and as her mother was going out ſhe aſked her to take her with her, that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1291100302:7"/>ſhe might buy ſome.—Her ſiſter Laura went with them.</p>
            <p>"Siſter," ſaid Roſamond, as they were walking along, "what have you done with your half-guinea?"</p>
            <p>"I have it in my pocket."</p>
            <p>"Dear! you will keep it for ever in your pocket: you know my god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother when ſhe gave it to you ſaid you would keep it longer than I ſhould keep mine; and I know what ſhe thought by her look at the time.—I heard her ſay ſomething to my mother."</p>
            <p>"Yes," ſaid Laura, ſmiling, "ſhe whiſpered ſo loud that I could not help hearing her too: ſhe ſaid I was a little miſer."</p>
            <p>"But did not you hear her ſay that I was very <hi>generous?</hi> and ſhe'll ſee that ſhe was not miſtaken.—I hope ſhe'll be by when I give my
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1291100302:8"/>baſket to Bell—won't it be beautiful?—there is to be a wreath of myrtle, you know, round the handle, and a froſt ground, and then the medal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions—"</p>
            <p>"Stay," interrupted her ſiſter; for Roſamond, anticipating the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of her work-baſket, talked and walked ſo faſt, that ſhe had paſſed, without perceiving it, the ſhop where the filigree paper was to be bought.—They turned back. Now it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that the ſhop was the corner houſe of a ſtreet, and one of the windows looked out into a narrow lane: a coach full of ladies ſtopped at the door juſt before they went in, ſo that no one had time immediately to think of Roſamond and her fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree paper, and ſhe went to the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, where ſhe ſaw that her ſiſter
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1291100302:9"/>Laura was looking earneſtly at ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that was paſſing in the lane.</p>
            <p>Oppoſite to the window, at the door of a poor looking houſe, there was ſitting a little girl weaving lace. Her bobbins moved as quick as lightning and ſhe never once looked up from her work.</p>
            <p>"Is not ſhe very induſtrious?" ſaid Laura; "and very honeſt too," added ſhe in a minute afterwards; for juſt then, a baker with a baſket of rolls on his head paſſed, and by accident one of the rolls fell cloſe to the little girl: ſhe took it up eagerly, looked at it as if ſhe was very hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, then put aſide her work, and ran after the baker to return it to him.</p>
            <p>Whilſt ſhe was gone, a footman in a livery laced with ſilver, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the coach that ſtood at the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1291100302:10"/>ſhop door, as he was lounging with one of his companions, chanced to ſpy the weaving pillow, which ſhe had left upon a ſtone before the door. To divert himſelf (for idle people do miſchief often to divert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) he took up the pillow, and entangled all the bobbins. The little girl came back out of breath to her work; but what was her ſuprize and ſorrow to find it ſpoiled: ſhe twiſted and untwiſted, placed and replaced the bobbins, whilſt the footman ſtood laughing at her diſtreſs. She got up gently, and was retiring into the houſe, when the ſilver-laced footman ſtopped her, ſaying inſolently—"Sit ſtill, child."</p>
            <p>"I muſt go to my mother, ſir," ſaid the child; "beſides, you have ſpoiled all my lace—I can't ſtay."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:1291100302:11"/>
"Can't you," ſaid the brutal footman, ſnatching her weaving pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low again; "I'll teach you to complain of me." And he broke off, one after another, all the bob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins, put them in his pocket, rolled her weaving pillow down the dirty lane, then jumped up behind his miſtreſs's coach, and was out of ſight in an inſtant.</p>
            <p>"Poor girl!" exclaimed Roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, no longer able to reſtrain her indignation at this injuſtice: "Poor little girl!"</p>
            <p>At this inſtant her mother ſaid to Roſamond—"Come now, my dear, if you want this filigree paper buy it."</p>
            <p>"Yes, madam," ſaid Roſamond; and the idea of what her godmother and her couſin Bell would think of her generoſity, ruſhed again upon
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1291100302:12"/>her imagination. All her feelings of pity were immediately ſuppreſſed. Satisfied with beſtowing another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation upon the <hi>"Poor little girl,"</hi> ſhe went to ſpend her half-guinea upon her filigree baſket. In the mean time ſhe that was called the <hi>"little miſer,"</hi> beckoned to the poor girl, and opening the window ſaid, pointing to the cuſhion, "Is it quite ſpoiled?"</p>
            <p>"Quite! quite ſpoiled! and I can't, nor mother neither, buy ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and I can't do any thing elſe for my bread."—A few, but very few, tears fell as ſhe ſaid this.</p>
            <p>"How much would another coſt?" ſaid Laura.</p>
            <p>"Oh, a great—<hi>great</hi> deal."</p>
            <p>"More than that?" ſaid Laura, holding up her half-guinea.</p>
            <p>"Oh, no."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:1291100302:13"/>
"Then you can buy another with that," ſaid Laura, dropping the half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinea into her hand, and ſhe ſhut the window before the child could find words to thank her; but not before ſhe ſaw a look of joy and gratitude, which gave Laura more pleaſure probably than all the praiſe which could have been beſtowed upon her generoſity.</p>
            <p>Late on the morning of her cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin's birth day, Roſamond finiſhed her work-baſket. The carriage was at the door—Laura came run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to call her; her father's voice was heard at the ſame inſtant; ſo ſhe was obliged to go down with her baſket but half wrapped up in ſilver paper, a circumſtance at which ſhe was a good deal diſconcerted; for the pleaſure of ſurpriſing Bell would be utterly loſt if one bit of the fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1291100302:14"/>ſhould peep out before the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per time. As the carriage went on, Roſamond pulled the paper to one ſide and to the other, and by each of the four corners.</p>
            <p>"It will never do, my dear," ſaid her father, who had been watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her operations; "I am afraid you will never make a ſheet of paper cover a box which is twice as large as itſelf."</p>
            <p>"It is not a box, father," ſaid Roſamond, a little peeviſhly; "its a baſket."</p>
            <p>"Let us look at this baſket," ſaid he, taking it out of her unwilling hands; for ſhe knew of what frail materials it was made, and ſhe dreaded its coming to pieces under her father's examination.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:1291100302:15"/>
He took hold of the handle rather roughly, and ſtarting off the coach ſeat, ſhe cried—</p>
            <p>"Oh, ſir! father! ſir! you will ſpoil it indeed!" ſaid ſhe with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed vehemence, when, after drawing aſide the veil of ſilver paper, ſhe ſaw him graſp the myrtle-wreathed handle.</p>
            <p>"Indeed, ſir, you will ſpoil the poor handle."</p>
            <p>"But what is the uſe of <hi>the poor handle,"</hi> ſaid her father, "if we are not to take hold of it? And pray," continued he, turning the baſket round with his finger and thumb, rather in a diſreſpectful manner—"pray is this the thing you have been about all this week? I have ſeen you all this week dabbling with paſte and rags, I could not conceive what you were about—Is this the thing?"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:1291100302:16"/>
"Yes, ſir—You think then that I have waſted my time, becauſe the baſket is of no uſe: but then it is for a preſent for my couſin Bell."</p>
            <p>"Your couſin Bell will be very much obliged to you for a preſent that is of no uſe; you had better have given her the purple jar."</p>
            <p>"Oh, father! I thought you had forgotten that—it was two years ago; I'm not ſo ſilly now. But Bell will like the baſket I know, though it is of no uſe."</p>
            <p>"Then you think Bell is ſillier <hi>now,</hi> than you were two years ago.—Well, perhaps that is true; but how comes it, Roſamond, now that you are ſo wiſe, that you are fond of ſuch a ſilly perſon?"</p>
            <p>"<hi>I,</hi> father?" ſaid Roſamond, heſitating; "I don't think I am <hi>very</hi> fond of her."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:1291100302:17"/>
"I did not ſay <hi>very</hi> fond."</p>
            <p>"Well, but I don't think I am at all fond of her."</p>
            <p>"But you have ſpent a whole week in making this thing for her."</p>
            <p>"Yes, and all my half-guinea beſides."</p>
            <p>"Yet you think her ſilly, and you are not fond of her at all; and you ſay you know this thing will be of no uſe to her."</p>
            <p>"But it is her birth-day, ſir; and I am ſure ſhe will <hi>expect</hi> ſomething, and every body elſe will give her ſomething."</p>
            <p>"Then your reaſons for giving are becauſe ſhe expects you to give her ſomething. And will you, or can you, or ſhould you always give, merely becauſe others <hi>expect,</hi> or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſomebody elſe gives?"</p>
            <p>"Always!—no, not always."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:1291100302:18"/>
"Oh, only on birth-days."</p>
            <p>Roſamond, laughing, "Now you are making a joke of me, papa, I ſee; but I thought you liked that people ſhould be generous—my god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother ſaid that ſhe did."</p>
            <p>"So do I, full as well as your godmother; but we have not yet quite ſettled what it is to be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous."</p>
            <p>"Why, is it not generous to make preſents?" ſaid Roſamond.</p>
            <p>"That is a queſtion which it would take up a great deal of time to anſwer.—But, for inſtance, to make a preſent of a thing that you know can be of no uſe, to a perſon you neither love nor eſteem, becauſe it is her birth-day, and becauſe every body gives her ſomething, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe expects ſomething, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe your godmother ſays ſhe likes
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1291100302:19"/>that people ſhould be generous, ſeems to me, my dear Roſamond, to be, ſince I muſt ſay it, rather more like folly than generoſity."</p>
            <p>Roſamond looked down upon the baſket, and was ſilent.</p>
            <p>"Then I am a fool! am I?" ſaid ſhe, looking up at laſt.</p>
            <p>"Becauſe you have made <hi>one</hi> miſtake?—No. If you have ſenſe enough to ſee your own miſtakes, and can afterwards avoid them, you will never be a fool."</p>
            <p>Here the carriage ſtopped, and Roſamond recollected that the baſket was uncovered.</p>
            <p>Now we muſt obſerve, that Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamond's father had not been too ſevere upon Bell when he called her a ſilly girl.—From her infancy ſhe had been humoured; and at eight years old ſhe had the misfortune to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1291100302:20"/>be a ſpoiled child: ſhe was idle, fretful and ſelfiſh, ſo that nothing could make her happy. On her birth-day ſhe expected, however, to be perfectly happy. Every body in the houſe tried to pleaſe her, and they ſucceeded ſo well, that between breakfaſt and dinner ſhe had only ſix fits of crying. The cauſe of five of theſe fits no one could diſcover; but the laſt, and moſt lamentable, was occaſioned by a diſappointment about a worked muſlin frock. Her mother had promiſed her a new frock, and accordingly at dreſſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time her maid brought it to her, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming—"See here miſs! what your mamma has ſent you on your birth-day—Here's a frock fit for a queen—if it had but lace round the cuffs."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:1291100302:21"/>
"And why has not it lace round the cuffs? mamma ſaid it ſhould."</p>
            <p>"Yes, but miſtreſs was diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed about the lace; it is not come home."</p>
            <p>"Not come home, indeed! and didn't they know it was my birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day? But then I ſay I won't wear it without the lace—I can't wear it without the lace—and I won't."</p>
            <p>The lace, however, could not be had; and Bell at length ſubmitted to let the frock be put on. "Come, Miſs Bell, dry your eyes," ſaid the maid who <hi>educated</hi> her; "dry your eyes, and I'll tell you ſomething that will pleaſe you."</p>
            <p>"What, then?" ſaid the child, pouting and ſobbing.</p>
            <p>"Why—but you muſt not tell that I told you."</p>
            <p>"No—but if I am aſked?"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:1291100302:22"/>
"Why, if you are aſked, you muſt tell the truth to be ſure.—So I'll hold my tongue, miſs."</p>
            <p>"Nay, tell me though, and I'll never tell—if I <hi>am</hi> aſked."</p>
            <p>"Well, then," ſaid the maid, "your couſin Roſamond is come, and has brought you the moſt <hi>beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifulleſt</hi> thing you ever ſaw in your life; but you are not to know any thing about it till after dinner, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe wants to ſurpriſe you; and miſtreſs has put it in her wardrobe till after dinner."</p>
            <p>"Till after dinner!" repeated Bell, impatiently; "I can't wait till then, I muſt ſee it this minute."</p>
            <p>The maid refuſed her ſeveral times, till Bell burſt into another fit of crying, and the maid, fearing that her miſtreſs would be angry with <hi>her,</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:1291100302:23"/>if Bell's eyes were red at dinner-time, conſented to ſhew her the baſket.</p>
            <p>"How pretty!—But let me have it in my own hands." ſaid Bell as the maid held the baſket up out of her reach.</p>
            <p>"Oh no, you muſt not touch it; for if you ſhould ſpoil it what would become of me?"</p>
            <p>"Become of you, indeed!" ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed the ſpoiled child, who never conſidered any thing but her own immediate gratification—"Become of <hi>you,</hi> indeed! what ſignifies that—I ſhan't ſpoil it; and I will have it in my own hands.—If you don't hold it down for me directly, I'll tell that you ſhewed it to me."</p>
            <p>"Then you won't ſnatch it?"</p>
            <p>"No, no, I won't indeed," ſaid Bell; but ſhe had learned from her maid a total diſregard of truth.—
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1291100302:24"/>She ſnatched the baſket the moment it was within her reach; a ſtruggle enſued, in which the handle and lid were torn off, and one of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dallions cruſhed inwards, before the little fury returned to her ſenſes. Calmed at this ſight, the next queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was, how ſhe ſhould conceal the miſchief which ſhe had done. After many attempts the handle and lid were replaced, the baſket was put exactly in the ſame ſpot in which it had ſtood before, and the maid charged the child "<hi>to look as if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was the matter."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We hope that both children and parents will here pauſe for a moment to reflect.—The habits of tyranny, meanneſs, and falſehood, which chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren acquire from living with bad ſervants, are ſcarcely ever conquered
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1291100302:25"/>in the whole courſe of their future lives.</p>
            <p>After ſhutting up the baſket they left the room, and in the adjoining paſſage they found a poor girl wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a ſmall parcel in her hand.</p>
            <p>"What's your buſineſs?" ſaid the maid.</p>
            <p>"I have brought home the lace, madam, that was beſpoke for the young lady."</p>
            <p>"Oh, you have, have you, at laſt?" ſaid Bell; "and pray why didn't you bring it ſooner?"</p>
            <p>The girl was going to anſwer, but the maid interrupted her, ſaying—"Come, come, none of your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes; you are a little idle good for nothing thing, to diſappoint Miſs Bell upon her birth-day.—But now you have brought it, let us look at
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1291100302:26"/>it." The little girl gave the lace without reply, and the maid deſired her to go about her buſineſs, and not to expect to be paid; for that her miſtreſs could not ſee any body, <hi>becauſe</hi> ſhe was in a room full of company.</p>
            <p>"May I call again, madam, this afternoon?" ſaid the child, timidly.</p>
            <p>"Lord bleſs my ſtars!" replied the maid, "what makes people ſo poor, I <hi>wonders!</hi> I wiſh miſtreſs would buy her lace at the warehouſe, as I told her, and not of theſe folks.—Call again! yes, to be ſure—I believe you'd call, call, call twenty times for two-pence.</p>
            <p>However ungraciouſly the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to call again was granted, it was received with gratitude: the little girl departed with a chearful countenance: and Bell teized her
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1291100302:27"/>maid till ſhe got her to ſew the long wiſhed for lace upon her cuffs.</p>
            <p>Unfortunate Bell!—All dinner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time paſſed, and people were ſo hungry, ſo buſy, or ſo ſtupid, that not an eye obſerved her favourite piece of finery. Till at length ſhe was no longer able to conceal her impatience, and turning to Laura, who ſat next to her, ſhe ſaid—"You have no lace upon your cuffs; look how beautiful mine is!—Is not it? Don't you wiſh your mamma could afford to give you ſome like it?—But you can't get any if ſhe would, for this was made on purpoſe for me on my birth-day, and nobody can get a bit more any where, if they would give the world for it."</p>
            <p>"But cannot the perſon who made it," ſaid Laura, "make any more like it?"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:1291100302:28"/>
"No, no, no!" cried Bell; for ſhe had already learned, either from her maid or her mother, the mean pride which values things not for being really pretty or uſeful, but for being ſuch as nobody elſe can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure.</p>
            <p>"Nobody can get any like it, I ſay," repeated Bell; "Nobody in all London can make it but one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and that perſon will never make a bit for any body but me, I am ſure—mamma won't let her if I aſk her not."</p>
            <p>"Very well," ſaid Laura, coolly, "I do not want any of it; you need not be ſo violent: I aſſure you that I don't want any of it."</p>
            <p>"Yes, but you do though," ſaid Bell, more angrily.</p>
            <p>"No, indeed," ſaid Laura, ſmil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:1291100302:29"/>
"You do in the bottom of your heart; but you ſay you don't to plague me, I know," cried Bell, ſwelling with diſappointed vanity.— "It is pretty for all that, and it coſt a great deal of money too, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body ſhall have any like it if they cried their eyes out."</p>
            <p>Laura received this ſentence in ſilence—Roſamond ſmiled. And at her ſmile the ill-ſuppreſſed rage of the ſpoiled child burſt forth into the ſeventh and loudeſt fit of crying which had been heard upon her birth-day.</p>
            <p>"What's the matter, my pet?" cried her mother; "Come to me, and tell me what's the matter."</p>
            <p>Bell ran roaring to her mother; but no otherwiſe explained the cauſe of her ſorrow than by tearing the fine lace, with frantic geſtures, from
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1291100302:30"/>her cuffs, and throwing the fragments into her mother's lap.</p>
            <p>"Oh! the lace, child!—are you mad?" ſaid her mother, catching hold of both her hands. "Your beautiful lace, my dear love—do you know how much it coſt?"</p>
            <p>"I don't care how much it coſt—it is not beautiful, and I'll have none of it," replied Bell, ſobbing—"for it is not beautiful."</p>
            <p>"But it is beautiful," retorted her mother; "I choſe the pattern myſelf.—Who has put it into your head, child, to diſlike it?—Was it Nancy?"</p>
            <p>"No, not Nancy, but <hi>them,</hi> mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma," ſaid Bell, pointing to Laura and Roſamond.</p>
            <p>"Oh fie! don't <hi>point,"</hi> ſaid her mother, putting down her ſtubborn finger; "nor ſay <hi>them,</hi> like Nancy;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1291100302:31"/>I am ſure you miſunderſtood—Miſs Laura, I am ſure, did not mean any ſuch thing."</p>
            <p>"No, madam; and I did not ſay any ſuch thing that I recollect," ſaid Laura, gently.</p>
            <p>"Oh no, indeed!" cried Roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, warmly riſing in her ſiſter's defence. But no defence or expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was to be heard, for every body had now gathered round Bell to dry her tears, and to comfort her for the miſchief ſhe had done to her own cuffs.</p>
            <p>They ſucceeded ſo well, that in about a quarter of an hour the young lady's eyes, and the reddened arches over her eyebrows came to their natural colour; and the buſineſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus happily huſhed up, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as a reward to her daughter for her good humour, begged that Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamond
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1291100302:32"/>would now be ſo good as to produce her "charming pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent."</p>
            <p>Roſamond, followed by all the company, amongſt whom to her great joy was her godmother, proceeded to the dreſſing-room.</p>
            <p>"Now I am ſure," thought ſhe, "Bell will be ſurpriſed, and my godmother will ſee ſhe was right about my generoſity."</p>
            <p>The doors of the wardrobe were opened with due ceremony, and the filigree baſket appeared in all its glory.</p>
            <p>"Well, this is a charming pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent indeed!" ſaid the godmother, who was one of the company; "<hi>My</hi> Roſamond knows how to make pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents." And as ſhe ſpoke ſhe took hold of the baſket, to lift it down to the admiring audience. Scarcely had
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1291100302:33"/>ſhe touched it when lo! the myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle wreath, the medallions, all drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped—the baſket fell to the ground, and only the handle remained in her hand.</p>
            <p>All eyes were fixed upon the wreck. Exclamations of ſorrow were heard in various tones; and "Who can have done this?" was all that Roſamond could ſay. Bell ſtood in ſullen ſilence, which ſhe obſtinately preſerved in the midſt of the enquiries which were made about the diſaſter. At length the ſervants were ſummoned, and amongſt them Nancy, Miſs Bell's maid and gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: ſhe affected much ſurpriſe when ſhe ſaw what had befallen the baſket, and declared that ſhe knew nothing of the matter, but that ſhe had ſeen her miſtreſs in the morning put it quite ſafe into the wardrobe;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1291100302:34"/>and that, for her part, ſhe had never touched it, or thought of touching it, in her born days—"Nor Miſs Bell neither, ma'am, I can anſwer for her; for ſhe never knew of its being there, becauſe I never ſo much as mentioned it to her, that there was ſuch a thing in the houſe, becauſe I knew Miſs Roſamond wanted to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe her with the ſecret—ſo I never mentioned a ſentence of it—Did I, Miſs Bell?"</p>
            <p>Bell, putting on the deceitful look which her maid had taught her, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered boldly, <hi>No;</hi> but ſhe had hold of Roſamond's hand, and at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſhe uttered this falſehood ſhe ſqueezed it terribly.</p>
            <p>"Why do you ſqueeze my hand ſo?" ſaid Roſamond, in a low voice; "What are you afraid of?"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:1291100302:35"/>
"Afraid of!" cried Bell, turning angrily; "I'm not afraid of any thing—I've nothing to be afraid about."</p>
            <p>"Nay, I did not ſay you had," whiſpered Roſamond; "But only if you did by accident—You know what I mean—I ſhould not be angry if you did—Only ſay ſo."</p>
            <p>"I ſay I did not!" cried Bell, furiouſly; "Mamma!—Mamma!—Nancy! my couſin Roſamond won't believe me! that's very hard—It's very rude! and I won't bear it—I won't."</p>
            <p>"Don't be angry, love—don't;" ſaid the maid.</p>
            <p>"Nobody ſuſpects you, darling;" ſaid her mother.—"But ſhe has too much ſenſibility.—Don't cry, love, nobody ſuſpected you."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:1291100302:36"/>
"But you know," continued ſhe, turning to the maid, "ſomebody muſt have done this, and I muſt know how it was done; Miſs Roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond's charming preſent muſt not be ſpoiled in this way, in my houſe, without my taking proper notice of it.—I aſſure you I am very angry about it, Roſamond."</p>
            <p>Roſamond did not rejoice in her anger, and had nearly made a ſad miſtake, by ſpeaking loud her thoughts—<hi>"I was very fooliſh</hi>—" ſhe began and ſtopped.</p>
            <p>"Ma'am," cried the maid, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, "I'll venture to ſay I know who did it."</p>
            <p>"Who?" ſaid every one eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>"Who?" ſaid Bell, trembling.</p>
            <p>"Why, Miſs, don't you recollect that little girl with the lace, that we
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1291100302:37"/>ſaw peeping about in the paſſage: I'm ſure ſhe muſt have done it, for here ſhe was by herſelf half an hour or more, and not another creature has been in miſtreſs's dreſſing-room, to my certain knowledge, ſince morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Thoſe ſort of people have ſo much curioſity, I'm ſure ſhe muſt have been meddling with it;" added the maid.</p>
            <p>"Oh yes, that's the thing," ſaid the miſtreſs, decidedly.—"Well, Miſs Roſamond, for your comfort, ſhe ſhall never come into my houſe again."</p>
            <p>"Oh, that would not comfort me at all," ſaid Roſamond; "beſides, we are not ſure that ſhe did it; and if—" A ſingle knock at the door was heard at this inſtant: it was the little girl, who came to be paid for her lace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:1291100302:38"/>
"Call her in," ſaid the lady of the houſe; "let us ſee her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly."</p>
            <p>The maid, who was afraid that the girl's innocence would appear if ſhe were produced, heſitated; but upon her miſtreſs's repeating her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, ſhe was forced to obey.</p>
            <p>The child came in with a look of ſimplicity; but when ſhe ſaw the room full of company ſhe was a little abaſhed. Roſamond and Laura look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at her, and at one another with ſurpriſe; for it was the ſame little girl whom they had ſeen weaving lace.</p>
            <p>"Is not it ſhe?" whiſpered Roſa mond to her ſiſter.</p>
            <p>"Yes it is; but huſh," ſaid Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, "ſhe does not know us.—Don't ſay a word, let us hear what ſhe will ſay." Laura got behind the reſt of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1291100302:39"/>the company as ſhe ſpoke, ſo that the little girl could not ſee her.</p>
            <p>"Vaſtly well!" ſaid Bell's mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; "I am waiting to ſee how long you will have the aſſurance to ſtand there with that innocent look. Did you ever ſee that baſket be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?"</p>
            <p>"Yes; ma'am;" ſaid the girl.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>"Yes, ma'am,"</hi> cried the maid, "and what elſe do you know about it?—You had better confeſs it at once, and Miſtreſs perhaps will ſay no more about it."</p>
            <p>"Yes, do confeſs it;" added Bell, earneſtly.</p>
            <p>"Confeſs what, madam?" ſaid the little girl; "I never touched the baſket, madam."</p>
            <p>"You never <hi>touched</hi> it; but you confeſs," interrupted Bell's mother, that you <hi>did ſee</hi> it before—And pray
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1291100302:40"/>how came you to ſee it? you muſt have opened my wardrobe."</p>
            <p>"No, indeed, madam," ſaid the little girl; "but I was waiting in the paſſage, ma'am, and this door was partly open; and looking at the maid, you know, I could not help ſeeing it."</p>
            <p>"Why, how could you ſee it through the doors of my wardrobe?" rejoined the lady.</p>
            <p>The maid, frightened, pulled the little girl by the ſleeve.</p>
            <p>"Anſwer me," ſaid the lady, "where did you ſee this baſket?"</p>
            <p>Another ſtronger pull.</p>
            <p>"I ſaw it, madam, in her hands," looking at the maid; "and—"</p>
            <p>"Well, and what became of it afterwards?"</p>
            <p>"Ma'am," heſitating, "Miſs pulled, and by accident—I believe, I
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1291100302:41"/>ſaw, ma'am—Miſs, you know what I ſaw."</p>
            <p>"I do not know—I do not know: and if I did—you had no buſineſs there—and mamma won't believe you, I am ſure."</p>
            <p>But every body elſe did, and their eyes were fixed upon Bell in a manner which made her feel rather aſhamed.</p>
            <p>"What do you all look at me ſo for?—Why do you all look ſo? —And am I to be ſhamed upon my birth-day?" cried ſhe, burſting into a roar of paſſion; "And all for this naſty thing!" added ſhe, puſhing away the remains of the baſket, and looking angrily at Roſamond.</p>
            <p>"Bell; Bell! Oh fie! fie! now I <hi>am</hi> aſhamed of you—that's quite rude to your couſin," ſaid her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who was more ſhocked at her daughter's want of politeneſs than at
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1291100302:42"/>her falſehood. -"Take her away, Nancy, till ſhe has done crying;" added ſhe to the maid, who accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly carried off her pupil.</p>
            <p>Roſamond, during this ſcene, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially at the moment when her preſent was puſhed away with ſuch diſdain, had been making reflections upon the nature of true generoſity. A ſmile from her father, who ſtood by, a ſilent ſpectator of the cataſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trophe of the filigree baſket, gave riſe to theſe reflections; nor were they entirely diſſipated by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence of the reſt of the company, nor even by the praiſes of her god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother, who to conſole her ſaid—'Well, my dear Roſamond, I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire your generous ſpirit. You know I prophecied that your half-guinea would be gone the ſooneſt—Did I not, Laura?" ſaid ſhe, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1291100302:43"/>in a ſarcaſtic tone to where ſhe thought Laura was.—"Where is Laura? I don't ſee her."</p>
            <p>Laura came forward.</p>
            <p>"You are too <hi>prudent</hi> to throw away your money like your ſiſter; your half-guinea, I'll anſwer for it, is ſnug in your pocket—Is it not?"</p>
            <p>"No, madam;" anſwered ſhe, in a low voice. But low as the voice was, the poor little lace-girl heard it; and now for the firſt time, fixing her eyes upon Laura, recollected her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactreſs.</p>
            <p>"Oh, that's the young lady!" ſhe exclaimed, in a tone of joyful gratitude—"The good!—good young lady, who gave me the half-guinea, and would not ſtay to be thanked for it—but I <hi>will</hi> thank her now."</p>
            <p>

"The half-guinea, Laura!" ſaid her godmother—"What is all this?"</p>
            <p>"I'll tell you, madam, if you pleaſe;" ſaid the little girl.</p>
            <p>It was not in expectation of being praiſed for it, that Laura had been generous, and therefore every body was really touched with the hiſtory of the weaving-pillow; and whilſt they praiſed, felt a certain degree of reſpect, which is not always felt by thoſe who pour forth eulogiums. <hi>Reſpect</hi> is not an improper word, even applied to a child of Laura's age; for let the age or ſituation of the perſon be what it may, they command reſpect who deſerve it.</p>

            <p>"The thing I like the beſt of all others, father," ſaid Roſamond, half pleaſed, half vexed; "What is that I wonder?—You don't mean <hi>praiſe,</hi> do you, ſir?"</p>

MONTAGUE ſpent the ſummer of the year 1795 at Clif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, with their ſon Frederick, and their two daughters, Sophia and Marianne—They had taken much care of the education of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, nor were they ever tempted by any motive of perſonal convenience, or temporary amuſement, to hazard the permanent happineſs of their pupils.</p>
            <p>Senſible of the extreme importance of early impreſſions, and of the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:1291100302:81"/>influence of external circumſtances in forming the character, and the manners, they were now anxious that the variety of new ideas, and new objects, which would ſtrike the minds of their children, ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in a juſt point of view.</p>
            <p>"Let children ſee, and judge for themſelves," is often inconſiderately ſaid.—Where children ſee only a "part," they cannot judge of the "whole"—and from the ſuperficial view which they can have in ſhort viſits, and deſultory converſation, they can form only a falſe eſtimate of the objects of human happineſs, a falſe notion of the nature of ſociety, and falſe opinions of characters.—For theſe reaſons Mr. and Mrs. Montague were particularly cautious in the choice of their acquaintance, as they were well aware, that whatever paſſed in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:1291100302:82"/>before their children, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came part of their education.—When they came to Clifton, they wiſhed to have had a houſe entirely to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but as they came late in the ſeaſon, almoſt all the lodging houſes were full, and for a few weeks they were obliged to remain in a houſe in which ſome of the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were already occupied.</p>
            <p>During the firſt fortnight, they ſcarcely ſaw or heard any thing of one of the families, who lodged on the ſame floor with them.—An elderly Quaker, and his ſiſter Birtha, were their ſilent neighbours.—The bloom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing complexion of the lady, had indeed attracted the attention of the children, as they caught a glimpſe of her face when ſhe was getting into her carriage to go out upon the Downs.—They could
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:1291100302:83"/>ſcarcely believe that ſhe came to the Wells on account of her health.—Beſides her blooming complexion, the delicate white of her garments had ſtruck them with admiration, and they obſerved that her brother carefully guarded theſe from the wheel of the carriage as he handed her in.—From this circumſtance, and from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent countenance of the old gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, they concluded, that he was very fond of his ſiſter—that they were certainly very happy, only they never ſpoke, and could be ſeen but for a moment.</p>
            <p>Not ſo the maiden lady who occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied the ground floor.—On the ſtairs, in the paſſages, at her window, ſhe was continually viſible, and ſhe ſeemed to poſſeſs the art of being preſent in all theſe places at once.—Her voice was eternally to be heard, and it was
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:1291100302:84"/>not particularly melodious. The very firſt day ſhe met Mrs. Montague's children on the ſtairs, ſhe ſtopped to tell Marianne, that ſhe was a charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dear! and a charming little dear! to kiſs her, to enquire her name, and to inform her that her own name was "Mrs. Thereſa Tattle;" a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of which there was little danger of their long remaining in ignorance, for in the courſe of one morning at leaſt twenty ſingle, and as many double raps at the door, were ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by vociferations of "Mrs. Thereſa's Tattle's ſervant!"—"Mrs. Thereſa Tattle at home?"—"Mrs. Thereſa Tattle not at home."</p>
            <p>No perſon at the Wells was often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er at home and abroad than Mrs. Tattle; ſhe had, as ſhe deemed it, the happineſs to have a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive acquaintance reſiding at Clif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton—ſhe
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:1291100302:85"/>had for years kept a regiſter of arrivals. She regularly conſulted the ſubſcriptions to the circulating libraries, and the liſts at the Ball and the Pump-Rooms; ſo, that with a memory unincumbered with litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and free from all domeſtic cares, ſhe contrived to retain a moſt aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing and correct liſt of births, deaths, and marriages, together with all the anecdotes, amuſing, inſtructive, or ſcandalous, which are neceſſary to the converſation of a water-drinking place, and eſſential to the character of a "very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant woman."</p>
            <p>"A very pleaſant woman," Mrs. Tattle was uſually called, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of her accompliſhments, ſhe was eager to introduce herſelf to the acquaintance of her new neighbours; having, with her ordinary expedition,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:1291100302:86"/>collected from their ſervants, by means of her own, all that could be known, or rather all that could be told, about them. The name of Montague, at all events, ſhe knew was a good name, and juſtified her courting this acquaintance. She courted it firſt by nods, and becks, and ſmiles, at Marianne, whenever ſhe met her; and Marianne, who was a very little girl, began pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to nod and ſmile in return; perſuaded, that a lady who ſmiled ſo much, could not be ill-natured. Beſides, Mrs. Thereſa's parlour door was ſometimes left more than half open, to afford a view of a green parrot. Marianne ſometimes paſſed very ſlowly by this door. One morning it was left quite wide open, ſhe ſtopped to ſay "Pretty Poll," and immediately Mrs. Tattle begged
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:1291100302:87"/>ſhe would do her the honour to walk in and ſee "Pretty Poll;" at the ſame time taking the liberty to offer her a piece of iced plumb cake.</p>
            <p>The next day Mrs. Thereſa Tattle did herſelf the honour to wait upon Mrs. Montague, "to apologiſe for the liberty ſhe had taken, in inviting Mrs. Montague's charming Miſs Marianne into her apartment to ſee "Pretty Poll;" and for the ſtill greater liberty ſhe had taken in offering her a piece of plumb cake, inconſiderate creature that ſhe was! which might poſſibly have diſagreed with her, and which certainly were liberties ſhe never ſhould have been induced to take, if ſhe had not been unaccountably bewitched by Miſs Marianne's ſtriking, though highly flattering reſemblance, to a young gentleman, an officer, with whom
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:1291100302:88"/>ſhe had danced; ſhe was ſorry to ſay, now nearly twelve years ago, at the races in—ſhire, of the name of Montague, a moſt reſpectable young man, and of a moſt reſpectable fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, with which, in a remote de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, ſhe might preſume to ſay, ſhe herſelf was ſomeway connected, having the honour to be nearly related to the Jones's of Merioneth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, who were couſins to the Manwairings, of Bedfordſhire, who married into the family of the Griffiths's, the eldeſt branch of which ſhe underſtood had the honour to be couſin german to Mr. Montague, on which account ſhe had been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient to pay a viſit ſo likely to be productive of moſt agreeable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, in the acquiſition of an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, whoſe ſociety muſt do her infinite honour."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:1291100302:89"/>
Having thus happily accompliſhed her firſt viſit, there ſeemed little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of eſcaping Mrs. Tattle's far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acquaintance. In the courſe of the firſt week, ſhe only hinted to Mr. Montague, that "ſome people thought his ſyſtem of education ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther odd, that ſhe ſhould be obliged to him if he would, ſome time or other, when he had nothing elſe to do, juſt ſit down and make her underſtand his notions, that ſhe might have ſomething to ſay to her acquaintance, as ſhe always wiſhed to have when ſhe heard any friend attacked, or any friend's opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions."</p>
            <p>Mr. Montague declining to ſit down and make this lady underſtand a ſyſtem of education only to give her ſomething to ſay, and ſhewing unaccountable indifference about the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:1291100302:90"/>attacks with which he was threatened, Mrs. Tattle next ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed herſelf to Mrs. Montague, prophecying, in a moſt ſerious whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, "that the charming Miſs Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianne would ſhortly and inevitably grow quite crooked, if ſhe were not immediately provided with a back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, a French dancing-maſter, and a pair of ſtocks." This alarming whiſper could not, however, have a permanent effect upon Mrs. Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue's underſtanding, becauſe, three days afterwards, Mrs. Thereſa, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the moſt anxious inſpection, miſtook the hip and ſhoulder which ſhould have been the higheſt. This danger vaniſhing, Mrs. Tattle pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, with a rueful length of face, and formal preface, "heſitated to aſſure Mrs. Montague, that ſhe was greatly diſtreſſed about her daughter
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:1291100302:91"/>Sophy; that ſhe was convinced her lungs were affected; and that ſhe certainly ought to drink the waters morning and evening; and above all things, muſt keep one of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiroſſa lozenges conſtantly in her mouth, and directly conſult Dr. Cardimum, the beſt phyſician in the world, and the perſon ſhe would ſend for herſelf upon her death bed; becauſe, to her certain knowledge, he had recovered a young lady, a relation of her own, after ſhe had loſt one whole globe of her lungs."</p>
            <p>The medical opinion of a lady of ſo much anatomical preciſion, could not have much weight; nor was this univerſal adviſer more ſucceſsful in an attempt to introduce a tutor to Frederick, who, "ſhe apprehended, muſt want one to perfect him in the Latin and Greek, and dead lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:1291100302:92"/>of which ſhe obſerved it would be impertinent for a woman to talk, only ſhe might venture to repeat what ſhe had heard ſaid by good authority, that a competency of the dead tongues could be had no where but at a public ſchool, or elſe from a private tutor, who had been abroad (after the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of a claſſical education, finiſhed in one of the Univerſities) with a good family, without which intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, it was idle to think of reaping ſolid advantages from any continental tour; all which requiſites ſhe could, from perſonal knowledge, aver concentrated in the gentleman ſhe had the honour to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, as having been tutor to a young nobleman, who had now no farther occaſion for him, being,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:1291100302:93"/>unfortunately, for himſelf and his family, killed in an untimely duel.</p>
            <p>All her ſuggeſtions being loſt upon theſe unthinking parents, Mrs. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa Tattle's powers were next tried upon the children, and preſently her ſucceſs was apparent. On Sophy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſhe could not make any impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, though ſhe had expended on her ſome of her fineſt ſtrokes of flattery-Sophy, though very deſirous of the approbation of her friends, was not very ſolicitous to win the favour of ſtrangers. She was about thirteen, that dangerous age at which ill edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated girls, in their anxiety to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play their accompliſhments, are apt to become dependent for applauſe upon the praiſe of every idle viſitor; when the habits not being formed, and the aftention being ſuddenly turned to dreſs and manners, girls are
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:1291100302:94"/>apt to affect and imitate, indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, every thing that they fancy to be agreeable.</p>
            <p>Sophy, whoſe taſte had been cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated at the ſame time with her powers of reaſoning, was not liable to fall into theſe errors; ſhe found that ſhe could pleaſe thoſe whom ſhe wiſhed to pleaſe, without affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be any thing but what ſhe really was; and her friends liſtened to what ſhe ſaid, though ſhe never repeated the ſentiments, or adopted the phraſes, which ſhe might eaſily have caught from the converſation of thoſe who were older, or more faſhionable than herſelf. This word faſhionable, Mrs. Thereſa Tattle knew had uſually a great effect even at thirteen, but ſhe had not obſerved that it had much power upon Sophy; nor were her documents concerning grace and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:1291100302:95"/>manners, much attended to. Her mother had taught Sophy, that it was beſt to let herſelf alone, and not to diſtort either her perſon or her mind, in acquiring grimace, which nothing but the faſhion of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can ſupport, and which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways detected and deſpiſed by peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of real good ſenſe and polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>"Bleſs me!" ſaid Mrs. Tattle to herſelf, "if I had ſuch a tall daughter, and ſo unformed, before my eyes from morning to night, it would certainly break my poor heart. Thank God I am not a mother! Miſs Marianne for me, if I was!"</p>
            <p>Miſs Marianne had heard ſo often from Mrs. Tattle that ſhe was charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that ſhe could not help believing it; and from being a very pleaſing, unaffected little girl, ſhe in a ſhort
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:1291100302:96"/>time grew ſo conceited, that ſhe could neither ſpeak, look, move, or be ſilent, without imagining that every body was, or ought to be, looking at her; and when Mrs. Thereſa ſaw that Mrs. Montague looked very grave upon theſe occaſions, ſhe, to repair the ill ſhe had done, would ſay, after praiſing Marianne's hair or her eyes, "Oh, but little ladies ſhould never think about their beauty you know; nobody loves any body you know for being handſome, but for being good." People muſt think children are very ſilly, or elſe they can never have reflected upon the nature of belief in their own minds, if they imagine that children will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the words that are ſaid to them by way of moral, when the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, manner, and every conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitant circumſtance tell them a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:1291100302:97"/>tale. Children are excellent phyſiognomiſts, they quickly learn the univerſal language of looks, and what is ſaid of them always makes a greater impreſſion than what is ſaid to them; a truth of which thoſe prudent people ſurely cannot be aware, who comfort themſelves and apologize to parents by ſaying, "O but I would not ſay ſo and ſo to the child."</p>
            <p>Mrs. Thereſa had ſeldom ſaid to Frederick Montague, "that he had a vaſt deal of drollery, and was a moſt incomparable Mimic;" but ſhe had ſaid ſo of him in whiſpers, which magnified the ſound to his imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if not to his ear. He was a boy of much vivacity, and had conſiderable abilities; but his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite for vulgar praiſe had not yet been ſurfeited; even Mrs. Thereſa
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:1291100302:98"/>Tattle's flattery pleaſed him, and he exerted himſelf for her entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo much, that he became quite a buffoon. Inſtead of obſerving characters and manners, that he might judge of them and form his own, he now watched every perſon he ſaw, that he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect ſome foible, or catch ſome ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity in their geſture or pronuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which he might ſucceſsfully mimic.</p>
            <p>Alarmed by the rapid progreſs of theſe evils, Mr. and Mrs. Montague, who, from the firſt day that they had been honoured with Mrs. Tattle's viſit, had begun to look out for new lodgings, were now extremely impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to decamp. They were not people who, from the weak fear of offending a ſilly acquaintance, would hazard the happineſs of their family.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:1291100302:99"/>They had heard of a houſe in the country which was likely to ſuit them, and they determined to go directly to look at it. As they were to be abſent all day, they foreſaw their officious neighbour would probably interfere with their children. They did not chooſe to exact any promiſe from them which they might be tempted to break, and therefore they only ſaid at parting, "If Mrs. Thereſa Tattle ſhould aſk you to come to her, do as you think proper."</p>
            <p>Scarcely had Mrs. Montague's car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage gone out of hearing, when a note was brought directed to "Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick Montague, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> junior," which he immediately opened, and read as follows:</p>
            <p>"Mrs. Thereſa Tattle preſents her very beſt compliments to the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Mr. Frederick Montague; ſhe
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:1291100302:100"/>hopes he will have the charity to drink tea with her this evening, and bring his charming ſiſter Marianne with him, as Mrs. Thereſa will be quite alone, with a ſhocking head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach, and is ſenſible her nerves are affected; and Dr. Cardimum ſays, that (eſpecially in Mrs. T. T's. caſe) it is downright death to nervous patients to be alone an inſtant; ſhe therefore truſts Mr. Frederick will not refuſe to come and make her laugh.</p>
            <p>"Mrs. Thereſa has taken care to provide a few macaroons for her little favourite, who ſaid ſhe was particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly fond of them the other day.</p>
            <p>"Mrs. Thereſa hopes they will all come at ſix, or before; not forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Miſs Sophy, if ſhe will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to be of the party."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:1291100302:101"/>
At the firſt reading of this note, "the entertaining" Mr. Frederick, and the charming Miſs Marianne, laughed heartily, and looked at Sophy as if they were afraid that ſhe ſhould think it poſſible they could like ſuch groſs flattery; but upon a ſecond peruſal Marianne obſerved, that it certainly was good-natured of Mrs. Thereſa to remember the macaroons; and Frederick allowed, that it was wrong to laugh at the poor woman becauſe ſhe had the head-ach. Then twiſting the note in his fingers, he appealed to Sophy: "Well, Sophy, leave off drawing for an inſtant, and tell us what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer can we ſend?" "Can! we can ſend what anſwer we pleaſe." "Yes, I know that," ſaid Frederick; "I would refuſe if I could, but we ought
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:1291100302:102"/>not to do any thing rude, ſhould we? ſo I think we might as well go." "Hey! becauſe we could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe if we would, I ſay."</p>
            <p>"You have made ſuch confuſion, replied Sophy, between "could n't," and "would n't," and "ſhould n't," that I can't underſtand you; ſurely they are all different things."</p>
            <p>"Different! no," cried Frederick, "could, would, ſhould, might, or ought," are all the ſame thing in the Latin grammar; all of 'em ſigns of the potential mood, you know."</p>
            <p>Sophy, whoſe powers of reaſoning were not to be confounded even by quotations from the Latin grammar, looked up ſoberly from her drawing, and anſwered, "That very likely thoſe words might be ſigns of the ſame thing in the Latin grammar,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:1291100302:103"/>but that ſhe believed they meant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly different things in real life."</p>
            <p>"That's juſt as people pleaſe," ſaid her ſophiſtical brother, "you know words mean nothing in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. If I choſe to call my hat my cadwallader, you would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand me juſt as well, after I had once explained it to you, that by cadwallader I meant this black thing that I put upon my head; cadwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lader and that would then be juſt the ſame thing to you."</p>
            <p>"Then why have two words for the ſame thing?" ſaid Sophy; "and what has this to do with could and ſhould? You wanted to prove"—</p>
            <p>"I wanted to prove," interrupted Frederick, "that it's not worth while to diſpute for two hours about two
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:1291100302:104"/>words. Do keep to the point, Sophy, and don't diſpute with me."</p>
            <p>"I was not diſputing, I was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning."</p>
            <p>"Well, reaſoning or diſputing. Women have no buſineſs to do either, for how ſhould they know how to chop logic like men."</p>
            <p>At this contemptuous ſarcaſm up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her ſex, Sophy's colour roſe. "There!" cried Frederick, exulting, "Now we ſhall ſee a philoſophereſs in a paſſion. I'd give ſixpence, half price for a harlequin entertainment, to ſee Sophy in a paſſion. Now Marianne, look at her bruſh dab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ſo faſt in the water!"</p>
            <p>Sophy, who could not eaſily bear to be laughed at, with ſome little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, ſaid, "Brother, I wiſh," —"There! There!" cried Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:1291100302:105"/>pointing to the colour which roſe in her cheek almoſt to her temples; "Riſing! Riſing! Riſing! Look at the thermometer. Blood heat! Blood! Fever heat! Boiling water heat! Marianne."</p>
            <p>"Then," ſaid Sophy, ſmiling, "you ſhould ſtand a little farther off, both of you; leave the thermometer to itſelf for a little while; give it time to cool. It will come down to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate by the time you look again."</p>
            <p>"Oh, brother," cried Marianne, "ſhe's ſo good humour'd, don't teize her any more; and don't draw heads upon her paper; and don't ſtretch her rubber out; and don't let us dirty any more of her bruſhes: See! the ſides of her tumbler are all manner of colours."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:1291100302:106"/>
"Oh, I only mixed red, blue, green, and yellow, to ſhew you, Marianne, that all colours mixed together make white. But ſhe is temperate now, and I won't plague her; ſhe ſhall chop logic if ſhe likes it, though ſhe is a woman."</p>
            <p>"But that's not fair, brother," ſaid Marianne, to ſay woman in that way. I'm ſure Sophy found out how to tie that difficult knot which papa ſhewed to us yeſterday, long before you did, though you are a man." "Not long," ſaid Frederick; "beſides, that was only a conjuring trick."</p>
            <p>"It was very ingenious, though," ſaid Marianne, "and papa ſaid ſo; and beſides, ſhe underſtood the rule of three, which was no conjuring trick, better than you did, though,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:1291100302:107"/>ſhe is a woman; and ſhe may reaſon too, mamma ſays."</p>
            <p>"Very well, let her reaſon away," ſaid the provoking wit; "all I have to ſay is, ſhe'll never be able to make a pudding." "Why not, pray bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther," enquired Sophy, looking up again very gravely. "Why, you know papa himſelf the other day at dinner, ſaid, that that woman who talks Greek and Latin as well as I do, is a fool after all; and that ſhe had better have learned ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing uſeful; and Mrs. Tattle ſaid ſhe'd anſwer for it ſhe did not know, how to make a pudding."</p>
            <p>"Well, but I am not talking Greek and Latin, am I?"</p>
            <p>"No; but you are drawing, and that's the ſame thing."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:1291100302:108"/>
"The ſame thing! O Frederick," ſaid little Marianne, laughing.</p>
            <p>"You may laugh, but I ſay it is the ſame ſort of thing. Women that are always drawing, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, never know how to make puddings; Mrs. Thereſa Tattle ſaid ſo when I ſhewed her Sophy's beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful drawing yeſterday."</p>
            <p>"Mrs. Thereſa Tattle might ſay ſo," replied Sophy, calmly, "but I do not perceive the reaſon, brother, why drawing ſhould prevent me from learning how to make a pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding."</p>
            <p>"Well, I ſay you'll never learn to make a good pudding."</p>
            <p>"I have learned," continued Sophy, who was mixing her colours, "to mix ſuch and ſuch colours together to make the colour that I want, and why
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:1291100302:109"/>ſhould I not be able to learn to mix flour and butter, and ſugar and egg together, to make the taſte that I want?"</p>
            <p>"Oh, but mixing will never do, unleſs you know the quantities, like a cook; and you would never learn the right quantities."</p>
            <p>"How did the cook learn them, cannot I learn them as ſhe did?"</p>
            <p>"Yes, but you'd never do it exactly, and mind the ſpoonfuls rightly, by the receipt, like a cook, exactly."</p>
            <p>"Indeed! indeed but ſhe would," cried Marianne eagerly, "and a great deal more exactly, for Mamma has taught her to weigh and meaſure things very carefully; and when I was ill, ſhe always weighed my bark ſo nicely, and dropped my drops
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:1291100302:110"/>ſo carefully; not like the cook. When Mamma took me down to ſee her make a cake once, I ſaw her ſpoonfuls, and her ounces, and her handfuls; ſhe daſhed and ſplaſhed without minding exactneſs, or the receipt, or any thing. I'm ſure Sophy would make a much better pudding, if exactneſs only is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing."</p>
            <p>"Well, granting that ſhe could make the beſt pudding in the whole world, what does that ſignify? I ſay ſhe never would, ſo it comes to the ſame thing."</p>
            <p>"Never would! how can you tell that, brother?"</p>
            <p>"Never would! how can you tell that, brother?"</p>

            <p>A KNOCK at the door from Mrs. Thereſa Tattle's ſervant, recalled Marianne to the buſineſs of the day.</p>
            <p>"There," ſaid Frederick, "we have ſent no anſwer all this time. It's neceſſary to think of that in a minute."</p>
            <p>The ſervant came with his miſtreſs's compliments, to let the young ladies and Mr. Frederick know that ſhe was waiting tea for them.</p>
            <p>

"Waiting! then we muſt go," ſaid Frederick.</p>
            <p>The ſervant opened the door wider to let him paſs, and Marianne thought ſhe muſt follow her brother, ſo they went down ſtairs together, whilſt So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy gave her own meſſage to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and quietly ſtaid at her uſual occupations.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Tattle was ſeated at her tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, with a large plate of macaroons beſide her, when Frederick and Marianne entered. She was "de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted" they were come, and "grieved" not to ſee Miſs Sophy along with them. Marianne co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured a little, for though ſhe had precipitately followed her brother, and though he had quieted her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience for a moment, by ſaying, "You know Papa and Mamma told us to do what we thought beſt;"
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:1291100302:115"/>yet ſhe did not feel quite pleaſed with herſelf; and it was not till after Mrs. Thereſa had exhauſted all her compliments, and half her maca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roons, that ſhe could reſtore her ſpirits to their uſual height.</p>
            <p>"Come, Mr. Frederick," ſaid ſhe, after tea, "you promiſed to make me laugh; and nobody can make me laugh ſo well as yourſelf."</p>
            <p>"Oh, brother," ſaid Marianne, "ſhew Mrs. Thereſa Dr. Carbuncle eating his dinner, and I'll be Mrs. Carbuncle."</p>

               <p>"Now brother, ſuppoſe that it is after dinner," ſaid Marianne, "and ſhew us how the doctor goes to ſleep."</p>
               <p>Frederick threw himſelf back in an arm chair, leaning his head back, with his mouth open, ſnoring; nodded from time to time; croſſed and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſſed his legs; tried to waken himſelf by twitching his wig, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:1291100302:120"/>his collar, blowing his noſe, and wrapping on the lid of his ſnuff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>box.</p>
               <p>All which infinitely diverted Mrs. Tattle; who, when ſhe could ſtop herſelf from laughing, "declared it made her ſigh too, to think of the life poor Mrs. Carbuncle led with that man, and all for nothing too; for her jointure was nothing, next to nothing, though a great thing to be ſure her friends thought for her, when ſhe was only Sally Ridgeway, before ſhe was married. Such a wife as ſhe makes! continued Mrs. Thereſa, lifting up her hands and eyes to Heaven, and ſo much as ſhe has gone through, the brute ought to be aſhamed of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf if he does not leave her ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing extraordinary in his will; for, turn it which way ſhe will, ſhe can never keep a carriage, or live like
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:1291100302:121"/>any body elſe, on her jointure, after all. She tells me, poor ſoul! a ſad proſpect after her huſband's death, to look forward to, inſtead of being comfortable, as her friends expected; and ſhe, poor young thing, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no better when they married her. People ſhould look into theſe things before hand, or never marry at all, I ſay, Miſs Marianne."</p>
               <p>Miſs Marianne, who did not clearly comprehend this affair of the jointure, or the reaſon why Mrs. Carbuncle would be ſo unhappy after her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's death, turned to Frederick, who was at that inſtant ſtudying Mrs. Thereſa as a future character to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mic, "Brother," ſaid Marianne, "now ſing an Italian ſong for us, like Miſs Croker. Pray, Miſs Croker, favour us with a ſong. Mrs. Thereſa Tattle has never had the pleaſure of hearing

               <p>"Oh, ho!" ſaid Mrs. Tattle, in a more complacent tone, "the boy takes me for Miſs Birtha Eden, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive;" and, flattered to be taken in the dark by a chimney ſweeper, for a young and handſome lady, Mrs. Thereſa laughed, and informed him, "that they had miſtaken the room; that they muſt go up another pair of ſtairs, and turn to the left."</p>
               <p>The chimney ſweeper with the ſqueaking voice, bowed, thanked her ladyſhip for this information, ſaid, "Good night to ye quality;" and they both moved towards the door.</p>
               <p>"Stay," ſaid Mrs. Tattle, whoſe curioſity was excited, "What can the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:1291100302:134"/>Edens want with chimney ſweepers at this time o'night, I wonder? Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topher, did you hear any thing about it?" ſaid the lady to her footman, who was now lighting the candles.</p>
               <p>"Upon my word, ma'am," ſaid the ſervant, "I can't ſay, but I'll ſtep down below and enquire. I heard them talking about it in the kitchen, but I only got a word here and there, for I was hunting for the ſnuff-diſh, as I knew it muſt be for candles, when I heard the bell ring, ma'am, ſo I thought to find the ſnuff-diſh before I anſwered the bell, for I knew it muſt be for candles you rang. But if you pleaſe I'll ſtep down now, ma'am, and ſee about the chimney-ſweeps."</p>
               <p>"Yes, ſtep down, do, and Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topher, bring up the cowſlip wine, and ſome more macaroons for my lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Marianne."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:1291100302:135"/>
Marianne withdrew rather coldly from a kiſs which Mrs. Tattle was going to give her, for ſhe was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſurpriſed at the familiarity with which this lady talked to her foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. She had not been uſed to theſe manners in her father and mother, and ſhe did not like them.</p>
               <p>"Well," ſaid Mrs. Tattle to Chriſtopher, who was now returned, "what is the news?"</p>
               <p>"Ma'am, the little fellow with the ſqueaking voice has been telling me the whole ſtory. The other morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ma'am, early, he and the other were down the hill, ſweeping in Paradiſe-row; thoſe chimnies, they ſay, are difficult; and the ſquare fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, ma'am, the biggeſt of the two boys, got wedged in the chimney; the other little fellow was up at the top at
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:1291100302:136"/>the time, and he heard the cry, but in his fright and all he did not know what to do, ma'am, for he looked about from the top of the chimney, and not a ſoul could he ſee ſtirring, but a few that he could not make mind his ſcreech. The boy within almoſt ſtifling too. So he ſcreeched, and ſcreeched, all he could; and by the greateſt chance in life, ma'am, old Mr. Eden was juſt going down the hill to fetch his morning walk."</p>
               <p>"Aye," interrupted Mrs. Thereſa, "friend Ephraim is one of your early riſers."</p>
               <p>"Well," ſaid Marianne, impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlently.</p>
               <p>"So, ma'am, hearing the ſcreech, he turns and ſees the ſweep, and the moment he underſtands the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:1291100302:137"/>
"I'm ſure he muſt have taken ſome time to underſtand it," interpoſed Mrs. Tattle, "for he's the ſloweſt creature breathing, and the deafeſt in company. Go on, Chriſtopher. So the Sweep did make him hear?"</p>
               <p>"So he ſays, ma'am; and ſo the old gentleman went in and pulled the boy out of the chimney, with much ado, ma'am."</p>
               <p>"Bleſs me!" exclaimed Mrs. Thereſa, but did old Eden go up the chimney himſelf after the boy, wig and all?"</p>
               <p>"Why, ma'am," ſaid Chriſtopher, with a look of great delight, "that was all as one, as the very 'dentical words I put to the boy myſelf when he telled me his ſtory. But, ma'am, that was what I could n't get out of him neither, rightly, for he is a
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:1291100302:138"/>churl; the big boy that was ſtuck in the chimney, I mean, for when I put the queſtion to him about the wig, laughing like, he would n't take it laughing like at all, but would only make anſwer to us like a bear, "He ſaved my life, that's all I know;" and this over again, ma'am, to all the kitchen round, that croſs-queſtioned him. So when I finds him ſo ſtupid and ill-mannered like (for I offered him a ſhilling, ma'am, myſelf, to tell about the wig) but he put it back in a ways that did not become ſuch as he, to no lady's butler, ma'am: whereupon I turns to the ſlim fellow, and he's ſmarterer and more manner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ma'am, with a tongue in his head for his betters, but he could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve me my queſtion neither, for he was up at the top of the chimney the beſt part o' the time; and when he
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:1291100302:139"/>came down, Mr. Eden had his wig on, but had his arm all bare and bloody, ma'am."</p>
               <p>"Poor Mr. Eden!" exclaimed Marianne.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Miſs," continued the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, "and the chimney-ſweep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was ſo bruiſed, and muſt have been killed."</p>
               <p>"Well, well! but he's alive now; go on with your ſtory, Chriſtopher," ſaid Mrs. T. "Chimney ſweepers get wedged in chimnies every day, its part of their trade, and its a happy thing when they come off with a few bruiſes. To be ſure," added ſhe, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving that both Frederick and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianne looked diſpleaſed at this ſpeech, "to be ſure, if one may be lieve this ſtory, there was ſome real danger."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:1291100302:140"/>
"Real danger! yes, indeed," ſaid Marianne, "and I'm ſure I think Mr. Eden was very good."</p>
               <p>"Certainly, it was a moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable action, and quite providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial; ſo I ſhall take an opportunity of ſaying, when I tell the ſtory in all companies; and the boy may thank his kind ſtars, I'm ſure, to the end of his days for ſuch an eſcape. But pray, Chriſtopher," ſaid ſhe, perſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in her converſation with Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topher, who was now laying the cloth for ſupper, "Pray which houſe was it in Paradiſe-row? where the Eagles, or the Miſs Ropers lodge? or which?"</p>
               <p>"It was at my lady Batterſby's, ma'am."</p>
               <p>"Ha! ha!" cried Mrs. Thereſa, "I thought we ſhould get to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the affair at laſt. This is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent!
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:1291100302:141"/>This will make an admirable ſtory for my lady Batterſby the next time I ſee her. Theſe Quakers are ſo ſly!—Old Eden I know has long wanted to get himſelf introduced in that houſe, and a charming charitable expedient he hit upon! My lady Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſby will enjoy this of all things."</p>

            <p>"NOW," continued Mrs. Thereſa, turning to Frederick, as ſoon as the ſervant had left the room, "now, Mr. Frederick Montague, I have a favour—ſuch a favour to aſk of you—its a favour which only you can grant; you have ſuch talents, and would do the thing ſo admirably! and my lady Batterſby would quite adore you for it. She will do me the honour to be here to ſpend an evening to-morrow. I'm convinced Mr. and Mrs. Montague will find themſelves obliged to ſtay out
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:1291100302:143"/>another day; and I ſo long to ſhew you off to her ladyſhip; and your doctor Carbuncle, and your counſellor Puff, and your Miſs Croker, and all your charming characters. You muſt let me introduce you to her ladyſhip to-morrow evening. Promiſe me."—</p>
            <p>"Oh, ma'am," ſaid Frederick, "I cannot promiſe you any ſuch thing, indeed. I am much obliged to you, but I cannot come indeed."</p>
            <p>"Why not, my dear ſir? Why not? You don't think I mean you ſhould promiſe, if you are certain your Papa and Mamma will be home."</p>
            <p>"If they do come home I will aſk them about it," ſaid Frederick, heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating for though he by no means wiſhed to accept of the invitation, he had not yet acquired the neceſſary power of ſaying NO decidedly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:1291100302:144"/>
"Aſk them!" repeated Mrs. Thereſa, "my dear ſir, at your age, muſt you aſk your Papa and Mamma about ſuch things?"</p>
            <p>"Muſt! no ma'am," ſaid Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick; "but I ſaid I would; I know I need not, becauſe my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and mother always let me judge for myſelf about every thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt."</p>
            <p>"And about this I am ſure," cried Marianne; Papa and Mamma you know, juſt as they were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away, ſaid, "If Mrs. Thereſa aſks you to come, do as you think beſt."</p>
            <p>"Well then," ſaid Mrs. Thereſa, "you know it reſts with your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, if you may do as you pleaſe."</p>
            <p>"To be ſure I may, madam," ſaid Frederick, colouring from that
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:1291100302:145"/>ſpecies of emotion which is juſtly called falſe ſhame, which often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers real ſhame, "to be ſure, ma'am, I may do as I pleaſe."</p>
            <p>"Then I may make ſure of you," ſaid Mrs. Thereſa, "for now it would be down right rudeneſs to tell a lady you won't do as ſhe pleaſes. Mr. Frederick Montague, I'm ſure, is too well bred a young gentleman to do ſo impolite, ſo ungallant a thing!"</p>
            <p>The jarcon of politeneſs and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry is frequently brought by the ſilly acquaintance of young people, to confuſe their ſimple morality and clear good ſenſe. A new and unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible ſyſtem is preſented to them, in a language foreign to their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and contradictory to their feelings. They heſitate between new motives and old principles; from the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:1291100302:146"/>fear of being thought ignorant, they become affected; and from the dread of being thought to be children, act like fools. But all this they feel, only when they are in the company of ſuch people as Mrs. Thereſa Tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</p>
            <p>"Ma'am," Frederick began, "I don't mean to be rude, but I hope you'll excuſe me from coming to drink tea with you to-morrow, becauſe my father and mother are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with lady Batterſby, and may be they might not like—</p>
            <p>"Take care, take care," ſaid Mrs. Thereſa, laughing at his perplexity, you want to get off from obliging me, and you don't know how. You had very nearly made a moſt ſhocking blunder, in putting it all upon poor lady Batterſby. Now you know its impoſſible Mr. and Mrs. Montague
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:1291100302:147"/>could have in nature, the ſlighteſt objection to my introducing you to my lady Batterſby at my own houſe; for don't you know, that beſides her ladyſhip's many unexceptionable qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, which one need not talk of, ſhe is couſin, but once removed to the Trotters of Lancaſhire, your mother's great favourites. And there is not a perſon at the Wells, I'll venture to ſay, could be of more advantage to your ſiſter Sophy, in the way of part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, when ſhe comes to go to the balls, which it's to be ſuppoſed ſhe will ſome time or other; and as you are ſo good a brother, that's a thing to be looked to, you know. Beſides, as to yourſelf, there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing her ladyſhip delights in ſo much as in a good mimic; and ſhe'll quite adore you!"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:1291100302:148"/>
"But I don't want her to adore me, ma'am," ſaid Frederick, bluntly; then correcting himſelf, added, "I mean for being a mimic."</p>
            <p>"Why not, my love, between friends can there be any harm in ſhewing one's talents, you that have ſuch talents to ſhew? She'll keep your ſecret, I'll anſwer for her; and, added ſhe, you need n't be afraid of her criticiſm, for between you and I, ſhe's no great critic, ſo you'll come. Well, thank you, that's ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled. How you have made me beg and pray; but you know your own value, I ſee, as you entertaining people always do. One muſt aſk a wit, like a fine ſinger, ſo often. Well, but now for the favour I was going to aſk you."</p>
            <p>Frederick looked ſurpriſed, for he thought that the favour of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:1291100302:149"/>was what ſhe meant; but ſhe explained herſelf farther.</p>
            <p>"The old Quaker who lodges above, Old Ephraim Eden, my lady Batterſby and I have ſo much diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion about him, he is the beſt cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, the oddeſt creature! If you were but to ſee him come into the rooms with thoſe ſtiff ſkirts, or walking with his eternal ſiſter Birtha, and his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting broad brimmed hat, one knows him a mile off. But then his voice, and way, and all together, if one could get them to the life, they'd be better than any thing on the ſtage; better even than any thing I've ſeen to-night; and I think you'd make a capital Quaker for my lady Batterſby; but then the thing is, one can never get to hear the old Quiz talk. Now you who have ſo much invention and cleverneſs; I have no invention my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:1291100302:150"/>but could not you hit upon ſome way of getting to ſee him, ſo that you might get him by heart. I'm ſure you, who are ſo quick, would only want to ſee him, and hear for half a minute, to be able to take him off, ſo as to kill one with laughing. But I have no invention.</p>
            <p>"Oh, as to the invention," ſaid Frederick, "I know an admirable way of doing the thing, if that was all. But then remember, I don't ſay I will do the thing, for I will not. But I know a way of getting up into his room, and ſeeing him, without his knowing I was there."</p>
            <p>"O tell it me, you charming clever creature!"</p>
            <p>"But remember, I do not ſay I will do it."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:1291100302:151"/>
"Well, well, let us hear it, and you ſhall do as you pleaſe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards."</p>
            <p>"Merciful goodneſs!" exclaimed Mrs. Tattle, "do my ears deceive me? I declare I looked round and thought the ſqueaking chimney ſweeper was in the room!"</p>
            <p>"So did I, Frederick, I declare," cried Marianne, laughing, "I never heard any thing ſo like his voice in my life."</p>
            <p>Frederick imitated the ſqueaking voice of this chimney ſweeper to great perfection.</p>
            <p>"Now," continued he, "this fellow is juſt my height; the old Quaker, if my face were blackened, and if I were to change cloaths with the chimney ſweeper, I'll anſwer for it he would never know me."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:1291100302:152"/>
"Oh, its an admirable invention, I give you infinite credit for it!" ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed Mrs. Thereſa. "It ſhall, it muſt be done: I'll ring, and have the fellow up this minute."</p>
            <p>"Oh, no; do not ring," ſaid Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick, ſtopping her hand, "I don't mean to do it. You know you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed that I ſhould do as I pleaſed; I only told you my invention."</p>
            <p>"Well, well, but only let me ring and aſk whether the chimney ſweepers are below: you ſhall do as you pleaſe afterwards."</p>
            <p>"Chriſtopher, ſhut the door; Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topher," ſaid ſhe to the ſervant, who came up when ſhe rang, "Pray are the ſweeps gone yet?"</p>
            <p>"No, ma'am."</p>
            <p>"But have they been up to old Eden yet."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:1291100302:153"/>
"Oh, no, ma'am; nor be not to go till the bell rings, for Miſs Birtha, ma'am, was aſleep, laying down, and her brother would n't have her wakened on no account what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomever; he came down his ſelf to the kitchen to the ſweeps though; but would n't have, as I heard him ſay, his ſiſter waked for no account. But Miſs Birtha's bell will ring, when ſhe wakens, for the ſweeps, ma'am, t'was ſhe wanted to ſee the boy as her brother ſaved, and I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſent for 'em to give 'em ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing charitable, ma'am."</p>
            <p>"Well, never mind your ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions," ſaid Mrs. Thereſa, "run down this very minute to the little ſqueaking chimney ſweep, and ſend him up to me. Quick, but don't let the other bear come up with him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:1291100302:154"/>
Chriſtopher, who had curioſity as well as his miſtreſs, when he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the chimney ſweeper, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed his own ſtay in the room by ſweeping the hearth, throwing down the tongs and ſhovel, and picking them up again.</p>
            <p>"That will do, Chriſtopher; Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topher, that will do I ſay;" Mrs. Thereſa repeated in vain. She was obliged to ſay, "Chriſtopher you may go," before he would depart.</p>
            <p>"Now," ſaid ſhe to Frederick, "ſtep in here to the next room, with this candle, and you'll be equipped in an inſtant. Only juſt change cloaths with the boy; only juſt let me ſee what a charming chimney ſweeper you'd make; you ſhall do as you pleaſe afterwards."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:1291100302:155"/>
"Well, I'll only change cloaths with him juſt to ſhew you for one minute."</p>
            <p>"But," ſaid Marianne to Mrs. Thereſa, whilſt Frederick was changing his cloaths, "I think Frederick is right about"—</p>
            <p>"About what, love?"</p>
            <p>"I think he is in the right not to go up, though he can do it ſo eaſily, to ſee that gentleman, I mean on purpoſe to mimic and laugh at him afterwards; I don't think that would be quite right."</p>
            <p>"Why, pray, Miſs Marianne?"</p>
            <p>"Why, becauſe he is ſo good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to his ſiſter. He would not let her be wakened."</p>
            <p>"Dear, its eaſy to be good in ſuch little things; and he won't have long
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:1291100302:156"/>to be good to her neither; for I don't think ſhe'll trouble him long in this world any how."</p>
            <p>"What do you mean?" ſaid Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianne.</p>
            <p>"That ſhe'll die, child."</p>
            <p>"Die! die with that beautiful colour in her cheeks! How ſorry her poor, poor brother will be. But ſhe will not die, I'm ſure, for ſhe walks about, and runs up ſtairs ſo lightly! O you muſt be quite entirely miſtaken, I hope."</p>
            <p>"If I'm miſtaken, Dr. Panado Cardimum's miſtaken too then, that's my comfort. He ſays, unleſs the waters work a miracle, ſhe ſtands a bad chance; and ſhe won't follow my advice, and conſult the doctor for her health."</p>
            <p>"He would frighten her to death, perhaps," ſaid Marianne. "I hope
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:1291100302:157"/>Frederick won't go up to diſturb her."</p>
            <p>"Lud, child, you are turned ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleton all of a ſudden, how can your brother diſturb her more than the real chimney ſweeper?"</p>
            <p>"But I don't think its right," per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted Marianne, "and I ſhall tell him ſo."</p>
            <p>"Nay, Miſs Marianne, I don't commend you now; young ladies ſhould not be ſo forward to give opinions and advice to their elder brothers unaſked; and Mr. Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, and I, I preſume, muſt know what's right, as well as Miſs Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianne. Huſh! here he is! O the capital figure, cried Mrs. Thereſa! Bravo! bravo! cried ſhe, as Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick entered in the chimney ſweeper's dreſs, and as he ſpoke, ſaying,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:1291100302:158"/>
"I'm afraid, pleaſe your ladyſhip, to dirty your ladyſhip's carpet."</p>
            <p>She broke out into immoderate raptures, calling him "her charming chimney ſweeper!" and repeating that ſhe knew before hand the character would do for him.</p>
            <p>She inſtantly rung the bell, in ſpite of all expoſtulation—ordered Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topher to ſend up the other chimney ſweeper—triumphed in obſerving, that Chriſtopher did not in the leaſt know Frederick when he came into the room; and offered to lay any wager that the other chimney ſweeper would miſtake him for his companion.—And ſo he did: and when Frederick ſpoke, the voice was ſo very like, that it was ſcarcely poſſible that he ſhould have perceived the difference.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:1291100302:159"/>
Marianne was diverted by this ſcene, but ſhe ſtarted, when in the midſt of it they heard a bell ring.</p>
            <p>"That's the lady's bell, and we muſt go," ſaid the blunt chimney ſweeper.</p>
            <p>"Go, then, about your buſineſs, and here's a ſhilling for you to drink, my honeſt fellow. I did not know you were ſo much bruiſed when I firſt ſaw you—I won't detain you. Go," ſaid ſhe, puſhing Frederick towards the door.</p>
            <p>Marianne ſprang forward to ſpeak to him, but Mrs. Thereſa kept her off; and though Frederick reſiſted, the lady ſhut the door upon him by ſuperior force; and having locked it, there was no retreat.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Tattle, and Marianne, waited impatiently for Frederick's return.</p>
            <p>

"I hear them," cried Marianne. "I hear them coming down ſtairs."</p>
            <p>They liſtened again, and all was ſilent.</p>
            <p>At length they heard ſuddenly a great noiſe of many ſteps, and many voices in confuſion in the hall.</p>
            <p>"Merciful!" exclaimed Mrs. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſa, "it muſt be your father and mother come back."</p>
            <p>Marianne ran to unlock the room door, and Mrs. Thereſa followed her into the hall.</p>
            <p>The hall was rather dark, but under the lamp a crowd of people. All the ſervants in the houſe were gathered together.</p>
            <p>As Mrs. Thereſa approached, the crowd opened in ſilence, and ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held in the midſt Frederick, blood ſtreaming from his face; his head
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:1291100302:161"/>was held by Chriſtopher, and the chimney ſweeper was holding a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for him.</p>
            <p>"Merciful! Gracious Heaven! what will become of me!" exclaimed Mrs. Thereſa. "Bleeding! good God! he'll bleed to death! Can nobody think of any thing that will ſtop blood in a minute? A key—a large key down his back; a key—has nobody a key? Mr. and Mrs. Montague will be here before he has done bleeding. A key! Cobwebs! a puff-ball! for mercy's ſake! Can nobody think of any thing that will ſtop blood in a minute! Gracious me! he'll bleed to death, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve!"</p>
            <p>"He'll bleed to death! O my brother!" cried Marianne, catching hold of the words, and terrified, ſhe
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:1291100302:162"/>ran up ſtairs, crying, "Sophy! O Sophy! come down this minute, or he'll be dead! my brother's bleeding to death.—Sophy! Sophy! come down, or he'll be dead!"</p>
            <p>"Let go the baſon, you," ſaid Chriſtopher, pulling the baſon out of the chimney ſweeper's hand, who had all this time ſtood in ſilence, "you are not fit to hold the baſon for a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman."</p>
            <p>"Let him hold it," ſaid Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, "he did not mean to hurt me."</p>
            <p>"That's more than he deſerves. I'm certain ſure he might have known well enough it was Mr. Frederick all the time, and he'd no buſineſs to go to fight—ſuch a one as he, with a gentleman."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:1291100302:163"/>
"I did not know he was a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man," ſaid the chimney ſweeper, "How could I?"</p>
            <p>"How could he indeed?" ſaid Frederick, "he ſhall hold the baſon."</p>
            <p>"Gracious me! I'm glad to hear him ſpeak like himſelf again, at any rate," cried Mrs. Thereſa. "Lord bleſs us! and here comes Miſs So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy too."</p>
            <p>"Sophy!" cried Frederick, "Oh, Sophy! don't you come—don't look at me, you'll deſpiſe me."</p>
            <p>"My brother! where! where!" ſaid Sophy, looking, as ſhe thought, at the two chimney ſweepers.</p>
            <p>"Its Frederick," ſaid Marianne, "that's my brother."</p>
            <p>"Miſs Sophy, don't be alarmed," Mrs. Thereſa began, "but gracious goodneſs, I wiſh Miſs Birtha"—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:1291100302:164"/>
At this inſtant, a female figure in white appeared upon the ſtairs; ſhe paſſed ſwiftly on, whilſt every one gave way before her.</p>
            <p>"Oh, Miſs Birtha!" cried Mrs. Thereſa, catching hold of her gown to ſtop her as ſhe came near Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick, "Oh, Miſs Eden, your beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful India muſlin!—take care of the chimney ſweeper, for Heaven's ſake." —But ſhe preſſed forwards.</p>
            <p>"Its my brother; will he die?" cried Marianne, throwing her arms round her, and looking up as if to a being of a ſuperior order, "Will he bleed to death?"</p>
            <p>"No, my love!" anſwered a ſweet voice, "do not frighten thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf."</p>
            <p>"I've done bleeding," ſaid Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:1291100302:165"/>
"Dear me, Miſs Marianne, if you would not make ſuch a rout," cried Mrs. Tattle. "Miſs Birtha, its no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a frolic. You ſee Mr. Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick Montague only in a maſquerade dreſs. Nothing in the world but a frolic, ma'am. You ſee he ſtops bleeding. I was frightened out of my wits at firſt; I thought it was his eye, but I ſee it is only his noſe; all's well that ends well. Mr. Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, we'll keep your counſel. Pray, ma'am, let us aſk no queſtions, its only a boyiſh frolic. Come Mr. Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick this way, into my room, and I'll give you a towel, and ſome clean water, and you can get rid of this maſquerade dreſs. Make haſte, for fear your father and mother ſhould pop in upon us."</p>
            <p>"Do not be afraid of thy father and mother, they are ſurely thy beſt
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:1291100302:166"/>friends," ſaid a mild voice. It was the voice of an elderly gentleman who now ſtood behind Frederick.</p>
            <p>"Oh, ſir! Oh, Mr. Eden!" ſaid Frederick, turning to him—</p>
            <p>"Don't betray me! for goodneſs ſake, ſay nothing about me," whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered Mrs. Tattle.</p>
            <p>"I am not thinking about you—Let me ſpeak," cried he, puſhing away her hand, which ſtopped his mouth, "I ſhall ſay nothing about you, I promiſe you," ſaid Frederick, with a look of contempt.</p>
            <p>"No, but for your own ſake, my dear ſir, your Papa and Mamma! Bleſs me! is not that Mrs. Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue's carriage?"</p>
            <p>"My brother, ma'am," ſaid So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, "is not afraid of my father and mother's coming back. Let him
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:1291100302:167"/>ſpeak—he was going to ſpeak the truth."</p>
            <p>"To be ſure, Miſs Sophy, I would n't hinder him from ſpeaking the truth; but its not proper, I preſume, ma'am, to ſpeak truth at all times, and in all places, and before every body, ſervants and all. I only want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ma'am, to hinder your brother from expoſing himſelf. A hall, I apprehend, is not a proper place for explanations."</p>
            <p>"Here," ſaid Mr. Eden, opening the door of his room, which was on the oppoſite ſide of the hall to Mrs. Tattle's, "Here is a place," ſaid he to Frederick, "where thou mayeſt ſpeak the truth at all times, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every body."</p>
            <p>"Nay, my room's at Mr. Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick Montague's ſervice, and my
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:1291100302:168"/>door's open too. This way, pray," ſaid ſhe, pulling his arm.</p>
            <p>But Frederick broke from her, and followed Mr. Eden.</p>
            <p>"Oh, Sir, will you forgive me!" cried he.</p>
            <p>"Forgive thee!—and what have I to forgive?"</p>
            <p>"Forgive, brother, without aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what," ſaid Birtha, ſmiling.</p>
            <p>"He ſhall know all," cried Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick; "all that concerns myſelf, I mean. Sir, I diſguiſed myſelf in this dreſs; I came up to your room to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night on purpoſe to ſee you, without your knowing it, that I might mimic you. The chimney ſweeper—where is he?" ſaid Frederick, looking round, and he ran into the hall to ſee for him—"May he come in? he may—he is a brave, an honeſt, good, grateful boy. He never gueſſed who I was;
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:1291100302:169"/>after we left you, we went down to the kitchen together, and there I, fool that I was, for the pleaſure of making Mr. Chriſtopher and the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants laugh, began to mimic you. This boy ſaid, he would not ſtand by and hear you laughed at;—that you had ſaved his life;—that I ought to be aſhamed of myſelf;—that you had juſt given me half-a-crown:—and ſo you had;—but I went on, and told him, I'd knock him down if he ſaid another word.—He did—I gave the firſt blow—we fought—I came to the ground—the ſervants pulled me up again.—They found out, I don't know how, that I was not a chimney ſweeper—the reſt you ſaw. And now can you forgive me, Sir," ſaid Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick to Mr. Eden, ſeizing hold of his hand.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:1291100302:170"/>
"The other hand, friend," ſaid the Quaker, gently withdrawing his right hand, which every body now obſerved being much ſwelled, he put it in his boſom again—"This hand and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come," ſaid he, offering his other hand to Frederick, and ſhaking his with a ſmile.</p>
            <p>"O that other hand!" ſaid Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, "that was hurt I remember.— How ill I have behaved—extremely ill.—But this is a leſſon that I ſhall never forget as long as I live. I hope for the future I ſhall behave like a gentleman."</p>
            <p>"And like a man—and like a good man, I am ſure thou wilt," ſaid the good Quaker, ſhaking Frederick's hand affectionately, "or I am much miſtaken friend in that black counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:1291100302:171"/>
"You are not miſtaken," cried Marianne, "Frederick will never be perſuaded again by any body to do what he does not think right; and now, brother, you may waſh your black countenance."</p>
            <p>Juſt when Frederick had got rid of half his black countenance, a double knock was heard at the door. It was Mr. and Mrs. Montague—who went into the hall to meet them.</p>
            <p>"What will you do now?" whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered Mrs. Thereſa to Frederick, as his father and mother came into the room.</p>
            <p>"A chimney ſweeper! covered with blood!" exclaimed Mr. and Mrs. Montague.</p>
            <p>"Father, I am Frederick," ſaid he, ſtepping forward towards them as they ſtood in aſtoniſhment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:1291100302:172"/>
"Frederick! my ſon!"</p>
            <p>'Yes, mother, I'm not hurt half ſo much as I deſerve; I'll tell you—"</p>
            <p>"Nay," interrupted Birtha, "let my brother tell the ſtory this time, thou haſt told it once, and told it well—no one but my brother could tell it better."</p>
            <p>"A ſtory never tells ſo well the ſecond time, to be ſure," ſaid Mrs. Thereſa, "but Mr. Eden will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly make the beſt of it."</p>
            <p>Without taking any notice of Mrs. Tattle, or her apprehenſive looks, Mr. Eden explained all that he knew of the affair in a few words, "your ſon," concluded he, "will quickly put off this dirty dreſs—the dreſs hath not ſtained the mind—that is fair and honourable. When he felt himſelf in the wrong, he ſaid ſo; nor was he in haſte to conceal his adventure from
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:1291100302:173"/>his father; this made me think well of both father and ſon. I ſpeak plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, friend, for that is beſt. But what is become of the other chimney ſweeper? he will want to go home," ſaid Mr. Eden, turning to Mrs. Thereſa.</p>
            <p>Without making any reply, ſhe hurried out of the room as faſt as poſſible, and returned in a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with a look of extreme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation,</p>
            <p>"Good Heaven! here is a cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrophe, indeed!—now indeed, Mr. Frederick, your Papa and Mamma, have reaſon to be angry. A new ſuit of cloaths!—the bare-faced villain!—gone!—no ſign of them in my cloſet, or any where—the door was locked—he muſt have gone up the chimney, out upon the leads, and ſo
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:1291100302:174"/>eſcaped; but Chriſtopher is after him. I proteſt, Mrs. Montague, you take it too quietly.—The wretch!—a new ſuit of cloaths, blue coat and buff waiſtcoat.—I never heard of ſuch a thing!—I declare, Mr. Montague, you are vaſtly good now not to be in a paſſion," added Mrs. Thereſa.</p>
            <p>"Madam," replied Mr. Montague, with a look of much civil contempt, "I think the loſs of a ſuit of cloaths, and even the diſgrace that my ſon has been brought to this evening, fortunate circumſtances in his educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He will, I am perſuaded, judge and act for himſelf more wiſely in future; nor will he be tempted to offend againſt humanity, for the ſake of being called, "The beſt Mimic in the World."</p>
