            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>Some learned men of Athens ſeeing Paul ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to engage in diſpute with every one, undertook
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1033500102:18"/>him: but not underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, ſome cried, he was a prating, babbling fellow; others, that he came to diſcover ſome ſtrange God to them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he frequently men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Jeſus and the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
                  <p>After this they brought him before the magiſtrates, to be examined what new religion it was he taught: for all that they had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1033500102:19"/>heard was new and ſtrange, and therefore they deſired to have a full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all. Paul being at full liberty to ſpeak, ſaid, — 'I perceive, O Athenians, that ye have a great number of idols; for as I paſſed by and ſaw your ſuperſtitious devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I found an altar with this inſcription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. This GOD therefore,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1033500102:20"/>whom you acknowledge not to know, yet profeſs to worſhip, is he whom I preach, the inviſible God of heaven and earth, who cannot be contained in temples of man's making; nor can any image made by man be a proper object of his worſhip; he being ſo far from wanting our help, that it is he that gives to all their life and all that they have: And from one
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1033500102:21"/>man he hath made a whole world of men, appointing times and places in great order. And the end of all this is, that they ſhould ſeek after their Creator and worſhip him, who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed near every one of us, even as the Soul that ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates us.</p>
                  <p>For our life, motion, and ſubſiſtance are wholly thro' him, according to that which one of your own poets hath ſaid.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:1033500102:22"/>God therefore being our Creator, we cannot in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſuppoſe him to be the work of our hands, ſuch as a piece of gold, ſilver, or a ſtone graved. This time of ignorance hath laſted long; but now God calls you are to repentance, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing determined the way by which all the world ſhall be judged; that is, by receiving or refuſing the faith of Chriſt; who
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1033500102:23"/>being rais'd from the dead, is offered to all men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in.'</p>
                  <p>When they heard him mention the reſurrection, the Epicureans eſpecially, who denied a future ſtate, fell a laughing at him; others ſaid, we will hear thee about this another time: and ſo Paul left them.</p>

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1033500102:26"/>as were ſick, or poſſeſſed with devils, they were immediately healed: The exorciſts, I ſay, ſeeing this, they alſo attempted to caſt out devils by uſing the name of JESUS; among whom were the ſeven ſons of one Scaeva a Jew, one of the chief of the families of the prieſts, who adjur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the evil ſpirit in the name of Jeſus, were thus anſwered by the poſſeſſed,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1033500102:27"/>'<hi>Jeſus I know, and Paul I know;</hi> but you come not with any authority from Jeſus, who hath given it to Paul.'</p>
                  <p>And the man who was poſſeſſed fell furiouſly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and was too hard for them; tearing off their clothes, and wounding them, ſo that they were glad to ſly from him.</p>
                  <p>This being ſoon rumour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among the Jews and

                  <p>PAUL having been brought before king Agrippa to anſwer to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers complaints made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him by the Jews in general, as a moſt notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous malefactor; and after Feſtus, a noble orator, had open'd his caſe in an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1033500102:32"/>ſpeech before the court; Agrippa told Paul he had liberty to ſpeak: who deſiring ſilence of the audience, began with this apology for himſelf:</p>
                  <p>'I cannot but think my ſelf happy, O king Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa, in that I am permitted to make my defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the accuſation laid by the Jews before your Majeſty, whom I know to be a perfect maſter of the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1033500102:33"/>Jewiſh laws and cuſtoms: for which reaſon I beg your patience.</p>
                  <p>He then acquaints the king with the manner of his life from his youth; of his being bred a Phariſee, of his being accuſed for aſſerting the reſurrection of the dead; appeals to him why it ſhould be thought a thing incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that God, who is omnipotent, ſhould raiſe
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1033500102:34"/>the dead. Confeſſes his own former unbelief; the havock that he made amongſt the church; his extraordinary converſion; and many other things, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating both to himſelf and to the goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt. And at laſt asked king Agrippa this queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; '<hi>Believeſt thou the prophets, O king?</hi> I am ſatisfied thou doſt; and knoweſt their predictions to be fulfilled.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:1033500102:35"/>This was ſo home a challenge to Agrippa, that in the publick preſence he declared, that Paul had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt perſuaded him to be a Chriſtian.</p>

                  <p>Sailing from thence, they came in fight of the ſland of Cyprus, where they were to lie by a
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1033500102:39"/>while; but the winds pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting, they paſſed the ſeas of Cilicia and Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylia, and came to Mira, a maritime city of Lycia. Here Julius finding a large ſhip bound for Italy, took his priſoners on board her, and with much ado made Salome, a city of Crete: from whence, after they had been long beating at ſea with contrary winds, and very ſtormy weather,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1033500102:40"/>they arrived at Fair-ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, near Laſca; where Paul would have perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed captain Julius to wait for more ſeaſonable wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but he preferring the maſter of the ſhip's judgment, they put to ſea, intending to reach Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice, a harbour of Creto, where there was ſafe rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and there to winter; and they having a light gale of ſouth, they queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1033500102:41"/>not in the leaſt of gaining their point.</p>
                  <p>But they ſoon found themſelves miſtaken; for the wind ſuddenly tacking about, blew ſo very hard at north eaſt; that they were forced to hand all their ſails, and let her drive before the wind. And coming under a little iſland called Clauda, they had like to have loſt their boat; but with much ado
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:1033500102:42"/>recovering it, they hoiſted it into the ſhip.</p>
                  <p>The next day, the ſtorm continuing, they were forced to cut away their maſts, and throw all their tackle overboard, and ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten their ſhip. The ſtorm ſtill increaſing, and neither ſun nor ſtars for many days appearing, they gave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves over for loſt.</p>
                  <p>Which Paul perceiving, he told them that he had
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:1033500102:43"/>ſeen a viſion, which aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him that not a ſoul of them ſhould be loſt, tho' the ſhip ſhould.</p>
                  <p>The ſhip thus driving for fourteen days at the mercy of the winds and waves, about midnight the ſailors fanſied they were near land; and throwing the lead, they ſounded, and found it twenty fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms, then fifteen, and it ſtill ſhaling, and being
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:1033500102:44"/>night, they apprehended they might ſtrike upon ſome ſhelves in the dark, ſo they let go four anchors aſtern, and waited for day.</p>
                  <p>And now the ſeamen reſolving to ſhift for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, had hoiſted the boat overboard, under pretence of mooring the ſhip ahead as they had done aſtern: but Paul perceiving their deſign, told captain Julius, that if the ſailors were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:1033500102:45"/>to quit the ſhip, they ſhould be in danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all loſt. Upon this the ſoldiers, to prevent their deſign, cut the ropes, and let the boat go adrift.</p>
                  <p>Now Paul perſuades them on board to take ſome refreſhment. The number of all that were in the ſhip was two hundred ſeventy ſix, including ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and paſſengers.</p>
                  <p>In the ſpace between
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:1033500102:46"/>that and day-break, they all eat and drank, and were refreſhed; having had no leiſure or thought of eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a conſiderable time before. After this refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they ſell chearfully to work, unloading the ſhip not only of goods but of the proviſions, and throwing them into the ſea.</p>
                  <p>When it was day, they diſcovered a creak and a
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1033500102:47"/>haven, into which they endeavoured to put; and when they had weighed the anchors, they made to the ſhore, and run the ſhip aground, where ſhe ſoon bulg'd. The captain then ordered the priſoners that could ſwim to throw themſelves into the ſea firſt; and the reſt on bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken pieces got ſafe to land: where when they were all arrived, they knew the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:1033500102:48"/>place to be the iſland Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lita, or. Malta.</p>
                  <p>The iſlanders ſeeing them in diſtreſs, treated them with great humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; making fires to warm their wet and weary limbs. But whilſt they were dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and warming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, a viper, driven from her hole by the heat of the fire, leaped out and faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Paul's hand: which when the natives,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:1033500102:49"/>ſaw, they concluded him guilty of murder, and that divine vengeance had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued him to that place, to die by the bite of this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous creature: but he ſhook it off into the fire, and felt no harm. On ſeeing this, they preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alter'd their opinion, and concluded him a God.</p>

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:1033500102:51"/>large and beautiful; the wainſcoting, carvings, ſhelves, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> are of nice workmanſhip; but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding there is a large collection of books in it the ſhelves appear ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thin, and thoſe lock'd up in a profound ſilence; ſome lolling faſt aſleep one way, and ſome another.</p>
                  <p>Theſe books were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the uſe of the clergy belonging to the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:1033500102:52"/>cathedral: but what from the height of its ſituation, which is half way up the cupola; and the dulneſs of its company, conſiſting moſily of a parcel of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated, muſt, crabbed old authors; makes it very ſeldom viſited by them. Their chief uſe now is to be made a publick ſhew of (like ſo many monſters) to ſtrangers, country peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and little maſters and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:1033500102:53"/>miſſes; who, whenever they come to ſee this fine Library, muſt always take care to go into the room on tiptoe, for fear of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbing any of theſe drou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy old gentlemen.</p>
                  <p>The floor of this room is very curious, being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid, without peg or nail, with ſo much art and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity, that it really looks very beautiful.</p>
                  <p>There is alſo a fine pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:1033500102:54"/>in it, of the right re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Henry Compton, late lord biſhop of London.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Model of St. Peter's at Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was taken by Sir Chriſtopher Wren from the church of St. Peter at Rome, whilſt he reſided there; and from this, with ſome alterations, our cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral of St. Paul was built:
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:1033500102:55"/>he having took care to correct in the latter, what he ſaw a blemiſh in the former. This model ſtands in a large room, where thoſe who are curious may examine it. 'Tis a fine piece, though now fallen ſomewhat to decay.</p>
                  <p>As to the great Bell and Clock, I have. ſpoke of them before in the firſt Volume, pag. 77. to which
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:1033500102:56"/>I muſt refer my young readers; and ſhall only add, that the way to them is both dark and ſomewhat difficult to aſcend, and therefore not adviſable for my young readers to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture up, without a proper guide. Beſides, ſhould the clock happen to ſtrike whilſt they are in the bell loſt, the ſound is ſo ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſingly loud and ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thoſe who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accuſtomed
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:1033500102:57"/>to it, that they would imagine it would rend the very tower all to pieces.</p>
                  <p>There is one thing more which is obſervable, that this clock is wound up once a day, which gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally takes up an hour's time: and as 'tis then ſet, it is looked upon to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry exact.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, You are ſhewn the grand Geometrical
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:1033500102:58"/>Staircaſe; which is a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and wonderful piece of workmanſhip, and ſo artfully contrived, that the ſupport of the whole prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally depends on the foot-ſtone only. This, and the ſtone ſtaircaſe at Hampton. court, are the only two of the kind that are to be met with in any of our publick buildings.</p>
                  <p>To give a more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular account of its beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:1033500102:59"/>would require the judgment of one who is converſant in the ſcience, to which I muſt ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly acknowledge my ſelf a ſtranger.</p>

                  <p>THE pillars of the church that ſupport the roof, are two ranges, with their entablature and beautiful arches, whereby the body of the church and choir are divided into
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:1033500102:61"/>three iſles. The roof of each is adorn'd with arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and ſpacious periphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of enrichments; as ſhields, leaves, chaplets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> admirably carved in ſtone.</p>
                  <p>At the weſt end of the church there are three doors which lead to the above iſles; from each of which you have a beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful proſpect the whole length of the church,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:1033500102:62"/>without any interception from the pillars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Juſt within the door of the north iſle, on the left hand, is the morning pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er chapel, where divine ſervice is performed every day in the week, excepting Sundays: from Lady-day to Michaelmas, at ſix in the morning; and from Michaelmas to Lay-day, at ſeven. In the north tower is the bell for calling people to prayers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:1033500102:63"/>The front of this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel has a very beautiful skreen of curious wainſcot, and adorn'd with twelve columns; their entabla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, arched pediments, and the royal arms, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with cherubims, and each pediment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween four vaſes, all cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly carved; and the skreen is ſenced with iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work.</p>
                  <p>Next to the morning
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1033500102:64"/>prayer chapel is the Lord Mayor's veſtry; to which he generally repairs with his attendants, before he takes his ſeat in the choir: and then divine ſervice immediately begins.</p>
                  <p>At the entrance of the ſouth iſle, on the right hand, is the door that leads to the geometrical ſtaircaſe: Next to that is the biſhop of London's ſpiritual court; which has

A little beyond this court, on the left hand, is a beautiful marble font; which for largeneſs, the fineneſs of its marble, and curious workmanſhip, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels all others; for which reaſon, I thought the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it would not be

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:1033500102:92"/>balcony, a hundred and thirty three feet; and from the balcony to the top of the flame, is thirty eight feet: And the height of the whole Monument from the ground, beſides the vault and foundation, to the top of the flame, is two hundred and two feet; the circumference of the ſhaft forty ſeven feet and a half; its dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter from without the

               <p>This building loftily ſhews itſelf above the houſes, and gives a gallant proſpect for many miles round, to thoſe that are
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:1033500102:96"/>in the balcony; ſo that many people have the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity to go up, and look about them from thence. The perſon appointed to keep it is allowed a ſalary for his attendance, beſides the money people give him: The price demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is <hi>Twopence each perſon.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the careted figures in he weſt front.</head>
               <p>THE ſide towards the ſtreet hath a repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the deſtruction of the city by the fire, and the rebuilding of it again, by ſeveral curiouſly engraven figures made in full proportion.</p>
               <p>Firſt is the figure of a
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:1033500102:100"/>woman repreſenting Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, ſitting on ruins, in a moſt diſconſolate poſture, her head hanging down, and her hair all looſe about her, the ſword lying by her, and her left hand careleſly laid upon it. A ſecond figure is Time with his wings and bald head, coming behind her, and gently lifting her up. Another female figure on the ſide of her, laying
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:1033500102:101"/>her hand upon her, and with a ſcepter winged in her other hand, directing her to look upwards; for it points up to two beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful goddeſſes ſitting in the clouds; one leaning on a cornucopia, denoting Plenty: the other having a palm-branch in her hand, ſignifying Victory or Triumph. Underneath this figure of London in the midſt of the ruins is
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:1033500102:102"/>a dragon with his paw upon the ſhield of a red croſs, the arms of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don: Over her head are repreſented houſes burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and flames breaking out thro' the windows; behind her citizens look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, and ſome of them lifting up their hands.</p>
               <p>Oppoſite to theſe figures is a pavement of ſtone, rais'd with three or four ſteps; on which appears
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:1033500102:103"/>king Charles the ſecond in a Roman habit, with a truncheon in his right hand, and a laurel about his head; coming towards the woman in the deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poſture aforeſaid; and giving orders to two or three others to deſcend the ſteps towards her. The firit hath wings on her head, and a crown of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked boys dancing; and in her hand ſomething re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:1033500102:104"/>an harp. Then another figure of one go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the ſteps, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing her, repreſenting Architect; ſhewing a ſcheme, or model for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>building the city, held in the right hand; and the leſt holding a ſquare and compaſſes. Behind theſe two ſtands another figure holding up an hat, denot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Liberty. Next be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the king is the duke
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:1033500102:105"/>of York, holding a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land ready to crown the riſing city, and a ſword lifted up in the other hand to deſend her. Behind this a third figure, with and earl's coronet on his head. A fourth, behind all, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a lion with a bridle in his mouth. Over theſe figures is repreſented an houſe in building, and a labourer going up a ladder with an hodd upon his
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:1033500102:106"/>back. Laſtly, underneath the ſtone pavement where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the king ſtands, is a good figure of envy, peeping forth, gnawing an heart.</p>
