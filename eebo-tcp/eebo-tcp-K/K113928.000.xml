            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To the Revd. Mr. WARTON.</head>
            <p>SIR,</p>
            <p>YOU will have no reaſon to be either alarmed or offended at a mode of addreſs, which every reader has a right to adopt. The author of a book upon a ſubject deſigned for and attractive of public attention gives a general challenge. If his facts and opinions ſtand the teſt of a fair and candid enquiry, he is entitled to univerſal patronage and approbation: if not, contempt and oblivion ſhould be his fate. The "History of Engliſh Poetry" ſtands high in public estimation; the ſubject is equally curious, intereſting, and abſtruſe: much, very much, of its ſucceſs is, undoubtedly, to be aſcribed to the opinion generally entertained of your veracity and care as a historian; and upon an idea ſo univerſal, ſo ſatisfactory, and hitherto ſo undisturbed, it may ſeem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidious not to have been content entirely to rely. I, however, Sir, am ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what too reſtleſs in my enquiries, too deſirous of being able to judge for myſelf, to be ſatisfyed either with a writers reputation, or with the opinion of the world; at leaſt, when I have it in my power to learn how deſervedly that reputation has been acquired, or how juſtly that opinion is formed. In purſuit of theſe objects, I have read and examined your great and important work with ſome degree of attention and accuracy; and I now preſent you with the reſult of my enquiries: the public discloſure of which will not, I flatter myſelf, either to you, or your numerous readers, prove an unacceptable ſervice. If, in ſome few inſtances, I may be thought to have betrayed a warmth of expreſſion, from which reputation ſo high, abilities ſo uncommon, and a profeſſion ſo ſacred, ought to have been wholely exempt, let me, once for all, obſerve, that, having no other object in view, no other end to anſwer, than truth and justice, I neither wiſh nor intend to conſider you otherwiſe than as author of the work in question. Perſonal motives I cannot poſſibly have been influenced by, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0531700300:4"/>utterly disavow. And were you able to falſify every charge I have here brought againſt you, whatever might be your ſeverity, I ſhould kiſs the rod with reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and even pleaſure: as, I aſſure you, the ſatisfaction I ſhould have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, in finding your work entirely free from error, would have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely beyond any I can be ſuppoſed to feel, in thus making myſelf the public inſtrument of its detection.</p>

               <head>VOL. I. </head>
               <p>Preface</p>
               <p>Page vi.</p>
               <p>That "ſome perhaps will be of opinion, that theſe annals ought to have commenced with a view of Saxon poetry," is a very natural and judicious conjecture. "The legitimate illustration of that jejune and intricate ſubject," would undoubtedly "have doubled 'your' labour," and required, I fear, a more profound and extenſive erudition, as well as a more penetrating judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than were, perhaps, neceſſary for the aera whence you have thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to deduce this important history. "That the Saxon language is familiar only to a few learned antiquaries, that our Saxon poems are little more than religious rhapſodies, and that ſcarce any compoſitions remain marked with the native images of that people in their pagan ſtate <note n="(1)" place="bottom">It may ſeem a very extraordinary idea in a Christian minister, and who is not only the historian of poets, but a poet hisſelf, that theſe people could not have a poetical genius, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not pagans; and that religion and poetry are incompatible. The notion, however ſtrange, may yet in ſome degree be juſt: The Saxons, like many other nations, really ſeem to have got very little "by the <hi>ſwop.</hi>"</note>, we will readyly allow; becauſe, admitting the poſitions to be true, they prove nothing; they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly harmleſs: But, "that the Saxon poetry has NO CONNECTION with the nature and purpoſe of 'your' PRESENT UNDERTAKING," is an aſſertion, one may ſafely venture to ſay, as new as it is ill-grounded, and full of mischief. Though the great revolution produced by the Norman invaders effected "that ſignal change in our policy, conſtitution, and public manners," which has in its conſequences "reached modern times," yet neither the Saxon people nor the Saxon tongue was thereby eradicated. You, Sir, have ſometimes been a blographer; and did you ever find it neceſſary to commence the ſtory of your hero at the 15th or 16th year of his age, and to aſſert that the time of his birth and infancy had no connection with the ſtory of his life, becauſe, forſooth, he was become a very different perſon when grown up and ſent to college, from what he was when born, breeched, and ſent to ſchool? And yet one may well doubt, whether ſuch an apology would not have anſwered your purpoſe juſt as effectually in that caſe, as your reaſon for declining to enter upon the ſtate of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0531700300:5"/>the Saxon poetry does in this. The truth is, that the origin and fundamental principles, as well of our language as of our poetry, are to be ſought for among the remains of the Saxon literature <note n="(2)" place="bottom">You admit this by the very firſt page of your history; you doubtleſs perceived your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſistency, though you did not, I ſuppoſe, expect that any of your readers would do ſo.</note>; and he who ſhall tell us that the Engliſh and Saxon languages have not ſort of connection with each other, is either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived hisſelf, or finds it his intereſt to deceive others,—by ſheltering his own ignorance or inactivity under a formidable and laboured ſhew of difficulty and uſeleſsneſs, equally viſionary, deluſive, and pernicious.</p>
               <p>P. viii.</p>
               <p>Whether you have gratifyed "the reader of taſte," by your exertions on this ſubject, I know not; but of this I am confident, that "the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarian" will have greater reaſon to be disſatisfyed with being perplexed or misled, than to thank you for having engaged in a taſk for which it will appear you have been ſo little qualifyed.</p>
               <p>I ſhall paſs by the two diſſertations which precede your history without obſervation <note n="(3)" place="bottom">You have ſomewhere obſerved, that we have a kind of malicious pleaſure in detecting the ſecret reſources and petty thefts of a great writer; and the remark is juſt and natural, with reſpect to the pleaſure; which does not, I truſt, ſo much reſult from malice, as from a ſecret re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to truth, and an indignant warmth at ſeeing the daw ſtrut abroad in his ſtolen plumes. Whatever may be the cauſe, I ſhall in the courſe of this enquiry have many opportunities or proving the justice of the obſervation. And, firſtly, you will be pleaſed to take notice, that the greateſt and beſt part of your note <hi>(t)</hi> (Diſ. I. ſign. a. 4. <hi>b.</hi>) in which you, with an equal parade of ingenuity and learning, account for an interpolation, by Geoffrey of Monmouth, into his translation of the Britiſh history, has been found to be almoſt literally <hi>borrowed</hi> from Mr. Cartes preface to the firſt vol. of his History of England. I have likewiſe ſome little reaſon to ſuppoſe, though I do not think worth my while to prove, that you owe more obligation to Sheltons translation of Wottons View of Dr. Hickeses Theſaurus, than to the Theſaurus itsſelf.</note>; not that I think them altogether juſt and proper, but becauſe I find that a ſtrict examination would require greater leiſure, and more intenſe application, as well as a more frequent reference to the numerous and uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon books there quoted (many of which I have, by the way, much reaſon to ſuſpect you never conſulted, nor even ever ſaw) than I am at preſent either wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or able to devote to it. I do not, at the ſame time, wiſh to detract from whatever merit you may have in this ingenious ſtructure: I onely deſire the reader to be particularly cautious and distruſtful, as he wanders over theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive regions of FABLE and ROMANCE. One may, however, venture to aſſert, that, let your facts and reaſonings in the firſt of theſe diſſertations be ever ſo juſt, yet will they by no means prove any thing like what you produce them for,—the introduction of romantic fiction into Europe; which is rather to be ſought for in the history of the Gauls, or other Celtic nations, who were ſettled
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0531700300:6"/>in Europe ſome thouſand years before you ſuppoſe the Goths to have arrived in this part of the world, and had doubtleſs "a very ſufficient ſtock of lies of their own growth <note n="(4)" place="bottom">Tyrwhitt <hi>verſus</hi> Warburton. Supplement to Shakſpeare, i. 373.</note>," without being beholden to Aſiatic adventurers.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not give myſelf the trouble to minute <hi>every</hi> inaccuracy I might dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover in the citations you have introduced from the old metrical legends, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween your 7th and 26th page: I take it for granted they are juſt as correct as I ſhall prove others to be, which you have given from MSS. in the Cotton and Harleian libraries; many of which, as one may eaſyly perceive, by your method of quoting, referring to, or registering them, you have certainly never ſeen.</p>
               <p>P. 26.</p>
               <p>One cannot help taking notice of your frequent forewardneſs in deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the age of poetical compoſitions, or the MSS. which contain them. In this page you produce a love-ſong, the oldeſt you can discover, which you "would place before or about the year 1200." This you cite from a MS. appearing, as you elſewhere <note n="(5)" place="bottom">P. 28.</note> tell us, to be of the hand-writing of the reign of king Edward the firſt: but <hi>an Elegy upon his</hi> DEATH, which you have printed, in another place <note n="(6)" place="bottom">P. 103.</note>, from this very MS. might have ſerved to ſhew you the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity of dating it in his LIFE-TIME. The truth is, the book evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to have been written in the reign of his ſon and ſucceſſor; and there is not the leaſt reaſon for concluding any poem in it to be much older than the year 1300.</p>
               <p>The Revd. Dr. Percy (now lord biſhop of Dromore), whoſe knowlege in theſe matters ſeems pretty much upon a level with your own, has brought its age down ſo low as the reign of king Richard II. <note n="(7)" place="bottom">Reliques of Ancient Poetry, ii. 3.</note>
               </p>
               <p>I cannot, willingly, dismiſs this ſame love-ſong, without giving a ſpecimen or two of the extreme correctneſs with which it is printed, and the extreme pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety with which it is explained.</p>
               <p>"With lokkes lefliche and longe." <hi>Lefliche,</hi> you ſay, is "lively;" and a moſt curious explanation to be ſure it is! The <hi>lively locks</hi> of a young lady! Charming creature! ſhe muſt have been a perfect Meduſa! But, poſſibly, you mistook <hi>lokkes</hi> for <hi>looks;</hi> and then we have the <hi>lively and</hi> long <hi>looks</hi> of the ſaid fair one! If this famous history of yours ſhould have the great and unmerited good fortune to come to a ſecond edition, you will do well to ſubtract one fault, by correcting <hi>lively</hi> to <hi>lovely;</hi> and another, by writing <hi>lure lumes</hi> inſtead of <hi>bire limmes:</hi> for though old poetry may be the ſame thing to you, ſenſe or nonſenſe, it may not be ſo to every one who is tempted to look into your book. The great blank, a few lines
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0531700300:7"/>further, you may fill up with the little word <hi>wes:</hi> but, indeed, you would do much better to get a freſh tranſcript, as there are fifty other mistakes in the copy you have printed: and all the reſt of the extracts from this and every other MS. throughout the volume, and indeed the whole work, are in the ſame predicament. It would, moreover, be as well, not to call the verſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning "Hyrdmen [hem] hatieth ant vch mones hyne," a different ballad from that on the lawyers; as, had you inſpected the MS. inſtead of the catalogue, you would have found both to be one and the ſame piece.</p>
               <p>P. 43, 44, 45, 46.</p>
               <p>We are here favoured with a ſatyrical ballad upon Richard king of the Romans, brother to our Henry III. preſerved in the above MS. which you, in a note, tell us you "had tranſcribed from the Britiſh Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeum, and written the explanations upon, BEFORE 'you' knew that it was printed in the SECOND [FIRST] edition of Doctor Percy's Ballads."—Now, Mr. Warton, liſten to me for a ſingle moment, and <hi>"mark how a plain tale ſhall put you down."</hi> Dr. (now Bp.) Percy, in printing this ſong, has taken ſome liberties with the orthography and language (and where is the piece with which he has not taken ſuch liberties?) in particular, he has altered the word <hi>cop</hi> 
                  <note n="(8)" place="bottom">
                     <p>"Sire Simond de Montfort hath ſuore by ys <hi>cop," i. e.</hi> cap or head. Thus, in the ancient Erench romance of Girart de Vienne, MS.</p>

                  </note>, which he did <hi>not</hi> underſtand, to <hi>fot,</hi> which, it is to be ſuppoſed, he <hi>did.</hi> In this alteration, and indeed throughout the whole poem, YOU, Mr. Warton, have followed him with a moſt literal and ſervile exactneſs. Still, however, you might have eſcaped undetected, and have pilfered "your ingenious friend and fellow-labourer" with ſafety; but, unluckyly, his lordſhips accuracy, being much of a piece with your own, ſuffered him to omit a complete ſtanza; which could not poſſibly have eluded the obſervation of a ſecond copyiſt: but I look in vain for it in YOUR (different) tranſcript. However, as it may be ſome ſmall conſolation to you in this unfortunate dilemma, I will here give it you.</p>

This omiſſion of the ingenious prelate is the more aſtoniſhing, not onely as the verſe immediately follows what he has copyed, but becauſe Mr. Wanley ſays, in his catalogue, that the ſong expreſsly mentions prince Edward, which it onely does in this verſe <note n="(9)" place="bottom">At p. 103, is another poem [the Elegy on Ed.

If the ſecond, then I am to enquire where a romance is to be found, any way near that age, or, indeed, of any other, which treats of Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bizond, independent of the history of Charlemagne? and, excepting, perhaps, a book or two of the acts of Godfrey and Baldwin, where are theſe favourite romances of Solyman, Nouraddin, the caliphs, the ſoldans, Egypt, and Syria, which cut ſuch a pompous figure in the above extract? Shall I like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe give you the trouble to recollect your authority for making the whole body of the troubadours of Provence take up arms, and follow their barons, "in prodigious multitudes," to the conqueſt of Jeruſalem? That ſome few of theſe poets, in the ſervice and courts of princes, ſhould be permitted to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany their lords to the cruſade, and that others, of inferior rank, might enter into and mix with the army, may be, and I fancy is, very true: but that a ſingle province ſhould, at that or any other time, contain ſuch <hi>prodigious multitudes</hi> of itinerant minſtrels, is an aſſertion as hypothetic and inſupportable, as it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible and abſurd.

               <p>"The ſtory of Patient Griſilde was the invention of Boccacio." Hardyly and boldly aſſerted.—Blind Bayard never heſitates at a leap. From the circumſtance of there being every reaſon to conclude that Boccace was NOT the author of this ſtory, you very rationally conclude he WAS. In the year 1373 (and not 1374) the Decameron fell into the hands of Petrarch, who tells Boccace, in a letter, he was ſo much affected with this tale, that he had trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated it into Latin; adding, that it had always pleaſed him <hi>when he had heard
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0531700300:16"/>it many years before</hi> 
                  <note n="(19)" place="bottom">See Mr. Tyrwhitts Chaucer, iv. 157.</note>; a ſufficient proof that Boccace was not the author. And it would, indeed, appear very ſtrange, if Petrarch had not payed his friend ſome compliment upon the invention of ſo intereſting a ſtory, if he had not been fully appriſed that it was <hi>not</hi> HIS. Beſides, it is well enough known that this is far from being the onely tale in the Decameron, of which Boccace was not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventor. The fable of Chaucers interview with Petrarch having been juſtly exploded and given up by every other perſon, YOU are now "inclined to think that he (Chaucer) was one of thoſe friends to whom Petrarch uſed to relate it (<hi>i. e.</hi> the ſtory of Griſilde) at Padua;" and "this," you ſay, "ſeems ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently pointed out in the words of the prologue;" becauſe the Clerk of Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enford, who tells the ſtory, there ſays, that HE "lernid it at 'Padow of <hi>this</hi> worthie clerke." A moſt convincing and ſatisfactory circumſtance truely! But Petrarch does not inform us that he ever uſed to relate the ſtory to his friends at Padua, or anywhere elſe: he onely ſays, he had ſhewn his translation of it to one of them: and from this verſion, which would, moſt probably, be longer and more circumſtantial than Boccacios (and if you think proper, you have it in your power to compare them) there can be little doubt that Chaucer took the ſtory, believing it to be Petrarchs own, and knowing it was not Boccacios.</p>

               <p>I will here, with your good leave, tranſcribe a very curious note from the foot of this page.</p>
               <p>"I have mentioned a Latin romance of Alexander's life, as printed by Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick Corſellis, about 1468. ſupr. vol. i. p. 131. [where you tell us it is "without date."] On examination, that impreſſion is ſaid to be finiſhed Decemb. 17, 1468. Unluckily, the ſeventeenth day of December was a Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day that year. A manifeſt proof that the name of Corſellis was forged."</p>
               <p>And upon this correction and inevitable concluſion, I ſhall beg leave to hazard a couple of inſignificant remarks. The firſt is, I much doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any ſuch book as you refer to, appearing or pretending to be printed by Corſellis in the above year; becauſe, if there be, and we can onely get rid of your "manifeſt proof," I think its existence will go a great way to eſtabliſh not onely the identity of the man, but his reſidence and practice at
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0531700300:18"/>Oxford in that very early period: a circumſtance ſo much to the credit of Alma Mater, that I am ſurpriſed one of her old fostered children ſhould have ſo readyly given it up, on the ſlight ground of a printers devil finiſhing a book upon a Sunday!</p>
               <p>But are you <hi>certain,</hi> Mr. Warton, that the 17th day of Decem. 1468 <hi>was</hi> a Sunday? Becauſe I have (and this is my 2d remark) ſome reaſon to believe that it was not; and I'll tell you why:—It was a SATURDAY; the laſt day of the week; the moſt likely of all others for the finiſhing of a laborious work: "a manifeſt proof that the name of Corſellis was NOT forged." For, ſurely, "the colluſion holds good in the exchange."—The Sunday letter for this part of the year, which was leap year (and I appeal to every one capable of calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating it) was B. Sunday muſt, therefor, neceſſaryly fall upon the EIGHTEENTH day of the above month; as any pariſh-clerk is able to inform you. How prudent, Mr. Warton, you ſee it is, always to eſtabliſh your premiſſes upon a ſure foundation, before you venture to draw a concluſion which may, in the end, prove the overthrow of its creator.</p>

               <p>"John Scogan is commonly ſuppoſed to have been a cotemporary of Chaucer, but this is a mistake. He was educated at Oriel college in Oxford; and being an excellent mimic, and of great pleaſantry in converſation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the favourite buffoon of the court of Edward the fourth, in which he paſſed the greateſt part of his life." You could ſcarcely have give the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman a more particular deſcription, if you had enjoyed the pleaſure of a <hi>tête-à-tête</hi> with him. But where is your authority for it? Marry, in "SCOGGINS JESTS;" an admirable ſource, truely, to draw the history of a mans life from. So may the lives of Foote, Garrick, and Sir John Fielding, be compiled, by ſome future Warton, from the jeſt-books extant under their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective names. But let us examine the account. This Scogan, or Scoggin, it ſeems was a buffoon in the court of Edward the fourth: how, then, came Falſtaff to break his head, "at the court gate, when he was a crack not thus high;" this was in John of Gaunts time, when Jack "was page to Thomas Mowbray, duke of Norfolk <note n="(22)" place="bottom">2d pt. of Hen. IV. a. iii. ſc. 1.</note>" O! this no doubt, you will ſay, is Shak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeares own anachroniſm. Ben Jonſon, however, who was as likely to know the fact as you are, expreſsly tells us that Scogan was
<q>
                     <l>— a fine gentleman, and a maſter of arts</l>
                     <l>Of HENRY THE FOURTHS times, that made disguiſes</l>

                  </q>
And this ſeems to be true; for we have a <hi>moral balade royal</hi> from "Scogan, unto the lordes and gentlemen of the kynges houſe," and which muſt, as you obſerve, have been written before the year 1447 (meaning, I ſuppoſe, 1412) in his old age, and printed, as you yourſelf tell us, by Caxton, who was, doubtleſs, ſufficiently acquainted with his identity and character; and there is, likewiſe, another from Chaucer to him.

                     <p>If the above MORAL BALADE be "the dulleſt ſermon that ever was written," and if it, and other things equally dull, be the whole of Scogans poetical remains, whence ariſes your authority for giving him the very familiar appellation of "our JOCULAR BARD?" ſince, by your own account, his <hi>jeſts</hi> and his <hi>poetry</hi> had not the remoteſt connection. It is not unlikely, however, (to allow you all poſſible juſtice) that, in thus ſumming up his character in two words, you had your eye upon the following ingenious compoſition, which he wrote at Oxford, on taking his degree of A.

For a little enquiry or attention muſt have informed you, that the true name of the poet Scogan was HENRY, and not JOHN. This Mr. Tyrwhitt has clearly ſhewn, and thence (perhaps rather too haſtyly) inferred that the ſtory of Scogan the jeſter was an abſurd and improbable fiction; nay, he has even (contrary to his uſual candour) gone ſo far as to call the jeſt-book, of which you have ſo exalted an opinion, "a collection of <hi>fooliſh</hi> ſtories." The merits of the work I ſhall leave to be ſettled between yourſelves; but this really learned and ingenious gentleman will not, I truſt, take it amiſs, if I ſhall venture to aſſert, that there <hi>actually was</hi> ſuch a perſon as JOHN SCOGAN; a totally distinct character from Henry, the poet; and who, though no "jocular bard," (unleſs you will allow the extract in the note ſufficient to authoriſe the title) muſt, in my mind, have been "a fellow of infinite jeſt, of moſt excellent fancy." I do not, in forming this opinion, rely altogether upon your friend Dr. Andrew Borde; though it will appear, that the account given by him is not entirely void of probability <note n="(25)" place="bottom">This writer informs us, he had "heard ſay, that Scogin did come of an honeſt ſtock, no kindred, and that his friends did ſet him to ſchoole at Oxford, where he did continue till he was made master of art."

He is there frequently called TOM, by Sir William Nevyle, and is introduced to court as his fool: poſſibly, however, this might have been the common appellation of ſuch characters: we ſtill ſay TOM FOOL.

This name and circumſtance (if not from Chattertons poem) are entirely of your own invention. And how is it poſſible that ROWLEYS MEMOIRS ſhould be compoſed in 1460, when he ſpeaks of king Edward IV. as the reigning prince, who did not attain the crown till the following year; and expreſsly mentions his Briſtow tragedy: the relation of an event which, according to your own account, did not happen before 1463 (or, as you afterwards correct yourſelf, 1462 or 1461)?</p>

               <p>"The HISTORY OF THE SEVEN CHAMPIONS, a book compiled in the reign of JAMES THE FIRST, by one Richard Johnſon, and containing ſome of the capital fictions of the old Arabian romance." It is ſomewhat extraordinary, if this work were written no ſooner, that the AUTHOR of the OBSERVATIONS ON SPENSERS FAIRY QUEEN ſhould have repreſented it as one of thoſe "miraculous books" which were ſo highly faſhionable in the reign of queen Elizabeth, and even as having been of great aſſistance to Spenſer in the formation of that poem. But I well know who corrected him; and I likewiſe believe that <hi>the correcter</hi> knew very little more of the matter than <hi>the corrected.</hi> The fact is, that both the author of the Obſervations and the author of the History of Engliſh Poetry <hi>is</hi> wrong. For, 1ſt. The History of the Seven Champions was not written ſo early as the Fairy Queen: and, 2dly. It was not "compiled in the reign of James the firſt." The firſt poſition is not, indeed, quite ſo eaſy to prove, nor, as you yourſelf here ſuppoſe the contrary, do I much care whether it be true or not: but the other is certain, "The Seven Champions of Chriſtendom" being quoted, as a popular book, by Meres, in his WITS TREASURY, printed in 1598. With reſpect to its containing any fiction of Arabian romance, you ſhould, I think, firſt adduce ſome ſuch romance, containing ſimilar fictions with the Seven Champions, which is a mere olio from Guy, Bevis, and other old Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh romances and ſtory-books.</p>

This is, ſurely, the moſt curious paſſage that was ever yet found in a history! Any other perſon than yourſelf would have na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſuppoſed that a non-existent character could not have written a book; and, if he had ſayed any thing, would have told his readers that ſuch a one, under ſuch an aſſumed name, did ſo and ſo. But it ſeems to be your chief ſtudy (if you ſtudy at all) to court abſurdity, rather than to avoid it: Here being no leſs than three choice blunders in little more than ſo many lines.

I have, indeed, ſometimes thought that the truely learned Mr. Tyrwhitt might have furniſhed you with this piece of information: But, if you had received many ſuch fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours from him, your book would have cut a very different ſigure from what it does; and I ſhould have been deprived of the honour of addreſsing you upon the ſubject.

I might, indeed, have remained in perpetual ignorance, if I had not acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally caſt my eye upon the 15th page of the 10th volume of the laſt edition of Shakſpeare; where I find the ingenious Dr. Farmer quoting this very ſonnet, and referring to Wyatts translation with all the particularities you could have deſired.

               <p>Such a ſhuffleing, nonſenſical paragraph was, I firmly believe, never put together ſince the invention of letters. That which I do not, and which, I think, no one can, underſtand, I ſhall not meddle with.

NOW YOU, Mr. Warton, who, to be ſure, muſt be an incomparable judge of what you never ſaw, pronounce it near a century more modern, becauſe, forſooth, it only <hi>refers</hi> the poem to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0531700300:34"/>that age (which it certainly does not) and gives no "poſitive indication" of ſuch a date (which it certainly does). But if the book had been evidently written in Edward the ſeconds time, the ſame abſuid plea would have ſerved you. There is not one MS. out of a hundred that has any "poſitive indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation" of the particular period in which it has been written; and yet people who are in the practice of inſpecting and comparing MSS. of different ages, can aſſign to each its proper date, nearly as well as it they had ſound it in the book. But what is all this to you, who know nothing either of ancient writing or of ancient language? For I will venture to ſay, that the ſtile of this very compoſition beſpeaks it at leaſt a hundred years older than the <hi>Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>browne Mayde,</hi> which, not onely without, but againſt, all authority, you have thrown ſo far back as the reign of Henry VI.

O yes, I beg your pardon, but there was:—To lengthen and ſtuff your work, which without ſuch ingenious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances, ſuch adventitious helps, you could never have been able to ſpin out to three large quarto volumes before you come to Spenſers Fairy Queen: The OBSERVATIONS on which (for I ſuppoſe you will of courſe lug in the whole of your former work; and, indeed, as it is entirely forgotten, and may therefor ſafely appear as new matter, one cannot disapprove your oeconomy) will naturally make the ſubject of a <hi>fourth;</hi> and thus you will proceed, I ſuppoſed, with a volume a year, ſo long as the credulity of the public will keep you in countenance. I love to ſpeak out, Mr. Warton; I really believe you will not, willingly, cloſe the work ſo long as you can make a ſingle guinea by it <note n="(39)" place="bottom">I am not unaware that you have informed us of the fourth volume being in the preſs, which will complete the work; but they who put implicit faith in ſuch aſſurances can never have ſeen, or muſt have entirely forget, the following advertiſement at the end of the ſecond edition of your POEMS (1779), and which was, doubtleſs, inſerted in the news-papers of that year:—"SPEEDILY will be publiſhed, by the ſame Author, the <hi>Third</hi> and LAST Volume of the History of Engliſh Poetry: In which the Subject will be carried [<hi>brought,</hi> I ſuppoſe you mean] down to the Commencement of the PRESENT Century."

               <p>How modeſt! how ingenuous!—But, indeed, I ought to apologiſe for this and the other long extracts I have taken the liberty of producing from your celebrated history; however, as the mode has been adopted, rather for the ſake of giving you fair play, and doing you SUBSTANTIAL JUSTICE, than with a view to injure the rapid ſale of the work, you will, I flatter myſelf, have no inclination to be displeaſed at it. But, to return:—And ſo you really thought it neceſſary to go back a full hundred years to <hi>new-write</hi> the History of Engliſh Poetry during that period. A moſt ſystematical historian, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs! What would any of Mr. Humes readers have thought of him, if in the middle of Henry the eighths reign he had <hi>ſtopped to recall their attention</hi> to a new history of the reign of Henry the ſixth? What could there poſſibly be in the ſtate of our language and poetry, at the period you had got to, which could require, could authoriſe, could justify, or even excuſe, your going back a hundred years to begin your ſtory anew? That which you affect "to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe," with reſpect to the language having received no improvement between the two periods, is a glaring inconſistency. You wilfully forget, as you wiſh your readers to do, that there has been a SURREY and a WYATT juſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. If any other perſon had advanced ſuch a groundleſs and abſurd po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, you muſt have taken him for either a fool or a madman. But the truth, Mr. Warton, the truth is, that you knew nothing of this romance when you might properly enough have introduced it, (not in the reign of Henry VI. for that is an age it does not belong to;) you were as entirely ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the existence of ſuch a poet as <hi>Laurence Minot,</hi> before you ſaw Mr. Tyrwhitts Chaucer (which, by the way, was publiſhed ſoon enough for you to have made a better uſe of it <note n="(40)" place="bottom">It appeared three years before the publication of your ſecond volume: in the body of which it is, I believe, never once mentioned.</note>, as you ſtill are of his marit. I know that theſe communications were made to you after the publication of your ſecond volume; but you were reſolved, it ſeems, to drag them, at all events, neck and heels, into your third; and, I am ready to confeſs, they well anſwer the purpoſe for which you introduced them:—they ſtuff your book!

I will venture to aſſure you (and I do not care a farthing whether you believe me or not) that the writing of this book is as old, at leaſt, as the time of king Richard the ſecond.

This ingenious conjecture comes, to be ſure, with perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſistency from one who has already produced large extracts from theſe very poems, as ſpecimens of the compoſition of Edward the ſeconds time. But, ingenious as it is, it contains neither probability nor truth. All the above romances are extant in MSS. above 300 years old; and, one of them, at leaſt, (Sir Bevis) excepting the typographical incorrectneſs of the old printed copy, differs no otherwiſe from it than in its orthography, and the ſlight variations inſeparable from repeated tranſcription. The ancient MS. copy of <hi>Richard Cuer de Lion</hi> is as long, at leaſt, as, if not longer than, the old <hi>editions:</hi> but whether the printed copies agree with the MSS. or not, is a matter of very little conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to your hypotheſis.

This is actually the caſe with reſpect to SIR GUY: there are two diſtinct translations, both very old; one of which is, line for line, the ſame with the printed copy. But it will not be found that the phraſeology or ſtile is more poliſhed, or the ſtory more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifyed or intricate, in the editions, than they are in the MSS. Simplicity, indeed, is a fault, of which few people will have reaſon to complain in the peruſal of an old metrical romance, let its antiquity be what it may. I ſhall
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0531700300:38"/>take the liberty to obſerve, in paſsing, that the printed copy of SIR GUY does NOT begin, ITHEN the tyme that God was borne, as you, implicitly following AMES, but, according to your conſtant practice, concealing the name of your informant, have been pleaſed to aſſert <note n="(41)" place="bottom">Ames has printed <hi>Ithen</hi> for <hi>Sithen.</hi>

               <p>Although you tell us you have ſeen a fragment of the book whence. "The Carol brynging in the bores head" is taken, yet was I not without very ſtrong ſuſpicions that you were indebted, as well for this ſame carol, as for the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters colophon—not to the book itsſelf, but—to your honeſt, industrious, uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and ungratefully requited, friend and aſſistant, Thomas Hearne, in his notes and ſpicilege upon William of Newbury, who had likewiſe, as it appeared, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed you with the anecdote from Hollinshed (p. 745). Theſe ſuſpicions were not weakened on finding, by a compariſon of you and your authority, that ſayed carol and colophon were printed with your uſual accuracy. But, upon fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reflection, I am half inclined to question the justice of the above ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions; for it rather ſeems to me, that you have been, on this occaſion, GUILTY OF PRIVATELY STEALING—from YOURSELF. And I'll tell you how. In that very humourous trifle, intitled and called, "A COMPANION TO THE GUIDE, AND A GUIDE TO THE COMPANION," I ſee that you have inſerted the whole of Mr. Hearnes account <hi>verbatim,</hi> and with a circumſtance which might, elſewhere, have been more to your honour:—you have given a minute and accurate reference to your real authority. I ſay <hi>elſewhere;</hi> for it is, in this place, done merely with a view to raiſe a laugh at the expence of that moſt worthy and reſpectable antiquary; whom, I rather think, you have, in the above piece, made ſomewhat too-many attempts to ridicule; forgetting, perhaps, that though he was leſs poliſhed in his taſte, and leſs elegant in his diction than ſome more modern writers, few, if any of them, can boaſt of ſuch a ſacred regard to truth, and of ſuch unimpeached integrity. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his errors are, there is one, in which I wiſh you had imitated him as ſucceſsfully as you have done in many others of a leſs important and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable nature:—he has never been detected in a wilful falſehood; nor been ever charged with the ſlighteſt misrepreſentation of the minuteſt fact.</p>
               <p>Leſt the number and uniformity of theſe dry expostulations ſhould render them too flat and tedious to yourſelf, or my other gentle readers, I ſhall make bold to break the chain, and endeavour to enliven you and them with an old Chriſtmas carol upon bringing up the BOARS HEAD, very different from that printed by Wynken de Worde, and now, for the firſt time, faithfully publiſhed from an ancient MS. in my own poſſeſſion.</p>

               <p>Well, Mr. Warton, you have at length got us dragged though HELL, into which we found ourſelves ſo unexpectedly plunged; and now, perhaps, you will (after I have recovered my fright and breath) give me leave to aſk you a ſingle queſtion: To what purpoſe is all this long diſſertation upon <hi>Dante?</hi> What poſſible connection is there between the <hi>Divina Comedia,</hi> and the History of Engliſh Poetry? "Pough, fool! it fills my book up, do'n't it?" Very true, ſir, it certainly does ſo; and, I think, THAT, from you, is ſuch an unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable argument for the neceſſity of this ſort of manoeuvre, that I rather wonder you have not favoured us with a ſimilar account of every epic or other poem of which you know anything, or know nothing ('tis all the ſame), from Homer to Milton. Truſt me, I admire your modesty, though, doubtleſs, we ſhall have more anon. But pray, as you have entertained us with ſo many Italian quotations, give me leave to aſk you, how long it may be ſince you became master of that language? becauſe I have heared, that, once upon a time, when you were ambitious of displaying your erudition, in the OBSER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VATIONS ON SPENSERS FAIRY QUEEN, by an extract from Taſſo, (—Taſſo in the original!—) you unfortunately laid hold of a <hi>wrong ſtanza,</hi> which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned much mirth among thoſe wicked wits, who are ſo maliciously dispoſed as not to ſuffer a man of genius to enjoy the credit of talents and learning which he does not poſſeſs.</p>

               <p>I trouble you, Mr. Warton, with this long extract, becauſe it is ſo very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting, and I have ſuch a great deal to ſay to you upon it, that nothing leſs, perhaps, would have anſwered either your purpoſe or mine.</p>
               <p>Though I never met with the "LIFE OF SIR MELIADO," nor with any other notice of it, I muſt be content to ſuppoſe it to have actually been where you ſay it was. But you ought, certainly, to have been better acquainted with it before you had ſo peremptoryly decided upon the meaning of the word "BRITTISH," which, with equal abſurdity and preſumption, you would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine to BRETAGNE or Britany in France. To be ſure, you are rather got into your Iriſh ſtile when you attempt to prove that BRITISH does NOT mean ENG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LISH, as no one, I believe, excepting yourſelf, could poſſibly have imagined that it did. It is, at the ſame time, very curious, to find a perſon, who either is, or pretends to be, a ſcholar, hardyly contending that this country was never called BRITAIN, nor its inhabitants BRITISH! That the ſun gives no light, and the night brings no darkneſ! The notion is, in the utmoſt degree, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible and abſurd. Armorica was by the French called LA PETITE BRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAGNE, by us, LITTLE BRITAIN, merely to distinguiſh it from the iland of GREAT BRITAIN, by the ſtiled LA GRANDE BRETAGNE. The name BRITISH <hi>may,</hi> for aught I know, be common to both countries, but I firmly believe the inhabitants of BRITANY were never ſo called, much leſs <hi>distinguiſhed,</hi> by any writer, Engliſh of foreign, before the ſagacious Mr. Warton <note n="(52)" place="bottom">If there be any ſuch book as "The Life of Sir Meliado," it is, without doubt, the romance of MELIADUS DE LEONNOIS, a petty king in GREAT BRITAIN, and one of the knights of the Round Table; whoſe ſtory was translated out of French into Italian, and printed at Venice in 1558 and 1559, in two volumes octavo.</note>. But, let the word BRITISH mean what it will, how does it connect with or apply to the quotation from Nicholas Antonio? He ſays nothing at all about BRITISH; he expreſly tells us, that Martorell pretended to have translated the romance of Tirante, "EX ANGLICA," out of ENGLISH. I have not, in the whole
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0531700300:47"/>courſe of this ſtrange history, been aſtoniſhed at any-thing more than at your aſſertion that "the hero is a gentleman of BRETAGNE." Becauſe I can onely conclude it to be a gueſs; and it happens to be as lucky as it was bold. You are not quite ſo fortunate, however, in your equally dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical poſition, that "the book was FIRST WRITTEN IN THE LANGUAGE OF THAT COUNTRY:" than which nothing can be more inſupportable, more ill-grounded, or more falſe. I muſt, indeed, confeſs, that it was not without reaſon you concluded every one to be as ignorant about the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as yourſelf; and that you might ſafely advance whatever you choſe without the ſmalleſt fear of detection. But, alas! how miſerably have you been deceived! John or Joanot Martorell, the author of the above romance of TIRANT LO BLANCH (which, by the way, was not printed at Valencia in 1480, but at Barcelona in 1497, and no where elſe during the 15th century) in his dedication thereof to Don Ferdinand, prince of Portugal, and duke of Viſeo, brother of Alphonſus V. and then (<hi>ſci.</hi> in 1460) preſumptive heir to the crown, to which his ſon Emanuel afterwards ſucceeded, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively declares, that the history and acts of the ſaid TIRANT were written in the Engliſh tongue, <hi>"EN LENGUA ANGLESA;"</hi> that he had TRANSLATED them out of THAT LANGUAGE into PORTUGUESE, at the direct inſtance of the above prince, who thought, that, as he (Martorell) had been ſometime in England, "<hi>EN LA ILLA DE ANGLETERRA</hi> 
                  <note n="(53)" place="bottom">In the ſuite, perhaps, of Peter duke of Coimbra, one of the ſons of John I. who was here in the third year of king Henry VI. (1425) at whoſe court he was magnificently enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and made a knight of the Garter: An honour which Martorell has conferred upon the hero of his romance, whom he ſuppoſes to be the firſt that received it. As to prince Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand, though he might never be in England, it is not improbable that he underſtood ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the language; being grandſon of Philippa, ſister of our Henry IV. and wife of the above John. He dyed in 1471, aged thirty; ſo that he could not well have been more than nineteen when he impoſed the taſk of this translation upon Martorell.</note>, he would know the tongue better than others; that he had ſince translated the book out of Portugueſe into his native dialect the VALENCIAN <note n="(54)" place="bottom">He onely lived, it appears, to finiſh the three firſt books; the fourth and laſt part is ſayed to be translated <hi>"a pregaries de la noble ſenyora dona yſabel de loriç, per lo magnifich caualler moſſen marti iohau de galba."</hi>
                  </note>; and apologiſes for the defects of his verſion, as being in ſome meaſure occaſioned by the peculiar difficulties of the Engliſh language, which he had, in many places, found it impracticable to translate. But, as you appear to underſtand Valencian <note n="(55)" place="bottom">See before, p. 30.</note>, I ſhall give you his own words: <hi>"Car ſi d'faliments algu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s hi ſon certament ſenyor nes en part cauſa da dita LENGUA A<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>GLESA de la qual en algunes partides es inpoſſible poder be girar los vocables."</hi> It is ſtrange enough, that an author, more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of Martorells conſequence, who is ſtiled <hi>"lo magnifich e virtuos ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valler,"</hi> ſhould have the conſidence to impoſe upon his patron not onely a feigned original, but a feigned command to translate it, and an imaginary translation too. This is an enigma we cannot at preſent ſolve. It is not impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, however, that Martorell might actually pick up ſome part of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject during his reſidence in England. What makes this conjecture the leſs
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0531700300:48"/>improbable is the uſe he has made of the ſtory of <hi>"Comte gillem de uaroych",</hi> (Guy of Warwick) which we know to have been then extant in Engliſh. The origin of THE GARTER, the magnificent celebration of the nuptials of the king of England (alluding, moſt likely, to thoſe of Richard II.) with the king of France's daughter, and ſome few other particulars, he may, undoubtedly, have got here: Though one might, perhaps, be led to think that he has derived his principal information on theſe heads from old Froiſſart, a favourite historian during the continuance of chivalry. But, independent of his own aſſertions, the venial deceits of a romantic age, there is the ſtrongeſt and moſt concluſive evidence, as well intrinſic as extrinſic, that Martorell, whether he wrote firſt in Portugueſe or Valencian, was the original author. As to the work itſelf, it is a moſt ingenious and admirable performance, well deſerving the praiſes beſtowed upon it by Cervantes <note n="(56)" place="bottom">See <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> p. 1. l. 1. c: 6. The romance of Tirante was, early in the 16th century, translated into Castilian; from thence into Italian, and about 30 or 40 years ago into French. The two latter translators were entire ſtrangers to the original, of which there is not, perhaps, more than one ſingle copy known to be extant.</note>, and much beyond any thing of the kind ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in England, or even (if one dare venture to ſay it) capable of being ſo.</p>
               <p>You will not deſire me to take further notice of your aſſertion, that this romance was firſt written in the language of Britany. I have, I think, ſayed enough to make you completely aſhamed of yourſelf, if you have a particle of modesty in your compoſition. But what credit, let me aſk, is a reader to place in the reveries and confident declarations of ſo ignorant, ſo falſe, and ſo conceited a writer?</p>
               <p>Your HYPOTHESIS, as you call it, is ſo falſe, ſo groundleſs, ſo viſionary, and abſurd, that I am equally willing to believe it your own, and to leave you in peacable poſſeſſion of it. Neither have I any thing, at preſent, to ſay to "the moſt learned and ingenious M. La Croze;" of whom I muſt with ſhame acknowlege, I never before heared: If, therefor, it be ſuch an amazing happyneſs to find one ſingle perſon in the whole world of the ſame opinion with yourſelf, enjoy it.</p>
               <p>That "our king Arthur" might be "ſometimes called Arthur of Little: Brittayne," as he is ſuppoſed to have been king of both countries, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable enough, though I do not believe it. I am, however, ready to allow that "there is a romance with that title," which may, for any thing I know to the contrary, have been "reprinted in 1609." But they who told you that ſhould, at the ſame time, have informed you that Arthur of Little Britain, the hero of that romance, is a very different perſon from king Arthur of Great Britain.

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0531700300:51"/>chiefly confined to matter of opinion, will be thought rather trifleing than important, rather innocent than dangerous. Even the <hi>errors</hi> of SUCH MEN are intitled to reſpect. And, for the later periods of our literary history, who is there ſo well informed, ſo judicious, or ſo liberal, as the worthy and amiable writer of the "Eſſay on the Learning of Shakeſpeare?" Thus aſſiſted, Mr. War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, you might, probably, render your work, in reality, what you have had the modesty to entitle it. Not that I have, after all, the ſlighteſt expectation of your taking any further trouble about the matter; unleſs, indeed, the ſale of the reviſed work ſhould appear likely to produce you ſome conſiderable advantage. However, you are equally obliged to me for my good advice, whether you embrace it or not. And as I am ſatisfyed that you will continue to write upon the ſubject, ſo long as you can find materials, however, flimſy, or purchaſers, however ſimple, I beg leave to recommend to a reſpectable department in your <hi>ſeventh</hi> volume, or rather to a volume or two of its own, a Virgin Article for which I have higheſt regard:—The Poetical Annals of the Britiſh Nurſery:—With two learned Differtations—I. On the origin and uſe of the ancient <hi>Lullabies;</hi> II. On the GESTA ROMANORUM of the Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery—Mother Gooſe's Tales. You could not reaſonably deſire a more ample field for the display of your amazing erudition in all its branches. Your "epiſode" (and the more "disproportionate" it is, the better) on a thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, which, as you very juſtly obſerve, is "of the loweſt ſpecies, and the higheſt antiquity," will be allowed to comprehend the whole history of the genuine mode of ſcenic repreſentiation, from Thespis to Flockton; interſperſed with a variety of ſurpriſing obſervations, and unheared of facts. Theſe will eke out many a looſe and eaſy page; while your disquiſitions upon Puerile Architecture, or the art of conſtructing Castles of Cards, will not onely involve the riſe, progreſs, and grand arcana of Free-maſonry, which are all compriſed in this curious and antique proceſs, but give you, at the ſame time, a fine op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of exhibiting your whole fund of knowlege in the ſcience, of which you have induced us to believe that you are perfect master; and by not writing, at leaſt not publiſhing, your promiſed work, have been wiſe enough not to undeceive us. One cannot eaſyly imagine a more pleaſing or fruitful ſubject, nor a historian better qualifyed to do it justice; unleſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, your want of fidelity and care may be thought an inſuperable objection: But I am not without hope that even the preſent addreſs will have the good fortune to make you a little more cautious on thoſe heads in your future lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubrations.</p>
