            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <byline>By a FRIEND.</byline>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>LUTARCH,</hi> that juſtly admired philoſopher, who has greatly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged the world by his writings, and, amongſt theſe, by the many curious <hi>Apophthegms</hi> he has given us of the wiſe and good men of antiquity, tells us, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That Socrates, meeting one day with Menon, whom he conſidered as a man well exerciſed in all the varieties of converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as a great proficient in ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative wiſdom, aſk'd him, WHAT IS VIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUE? And that Menon anſwer'd, There were proper virtues for Youth and Old-age,
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0244701300:3"/>
for Man and Woman, for Magiſtrate and Private perſon, for Maſter and Servant. An anſwer, which (the writer ſays) excited the admiration and applauſe of Socrates."</q>
            </p>
            <p>But, what would this wiſe heathen have ſaid, and how much greater would have been his tranſport, had his friend Menon, by way of anſwer, preſented him with writings, in which he had entered minutely into <hi>the nature of the Virtues</hi> proper for ſuch different <hi>Ages, Sexes,</hi> and <hi>Stations;</hi> had he deſcribed theſe ſocial ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, ſo <hi>affectingly,</hi> as to command atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo <hi>accurately,</hi> as to prevent miſtake, and ſo <hi>invitingly,</hi> as to engage imitation!</p>
            <p>But a delineation of moral Virtue, like this, was beyond the powers of human <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> and the utmoſt efforts of antient <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.</hi> And it is to REVELATION (that <hi>greater light</hi> to rule the moral world) that we owe the more perfect knowledge, not only of <hi>Religion,</hi> in matters relative to GOD, but of <hi>Virtue</hi> alſo, in matters relative to <hi>ourſelves, and one another.</hi> No wonder, therefore, that what Menon only mentioned in the general, and what even So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates could not have deſcribed juſtly in the particulars, ſhould have been executed in theſe
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0244701300:4"/>
latter times, with greater clearneſs and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion.</p>
            <p>And yet, whatever improvements have been made by Chriſtians in the ſyſtem of Moral Duty; how powerfully ſoever men are now exhorted to act like <hi>reaſonable</hi> and <hi>religious</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; how ſtrongly ſoever thoſe exhortations are enforced by the ſurer and more animating ſanctions of the Goſpel; yet—is it not too viſible, that immorality and irreligion ſtill ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in the lives of <hi>many,</hi> and, perhaps, (dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thought!) of the <hi>majority?</hi> And ſhall not every man, who is convinced of the real im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of virtuous principles and practices, and of the very frequent apoſtaſy from them, ſtand forth, and prevent, as far as in him lies, this alarming degeneracy from growing more prevalent?</p>
            <p>Many (it is acknowledged, with pleaſure and with gratitude) have been the laudable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of writers, in our own country, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this end; and theſe both from the <hi>clergy</hi> and <hi>laity.</hi> And a valuable acceſſion has been made, within the laſt fourteen years, by an author modeſtly <hi>anonymous,</hi> in his Three Works called, PAMELA, CLARISSA, and

Sir CHARLES GRANDISON! Works, which amiably illuſtrate, and ſtrongly enforce, the proper Virtues of <hi>Man and Woman, Parent and Child, Old-age and Youth, Maſter and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant!</hi> Each of them commuicated in <hi>a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular collection of Familiar Letters,</hi>

            <p>With ſuch a knowledge of life and manners, as is diſplayed in thoſe Works; with a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to entertain with wit, and enliven with humour, as well as to correct with delicacy, and exhort with dignity; we cannot but greatly reſpect the man, who, in an age <hi>like this,</hi> has attempted to ſteal upon the world <hi>reformation,</hi> under the notion of <hi>amuſement;</hi> who has found the expedient of engaging the <hi>private attention</hi> of thoſe, who put themſelves out of the reach of <hi>public exhortation;</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing to their <hi>cloſets</hi> thoſe who fly from the <hi>pulpit;</hi> and there, under the gay air, and captivating ſemblance of a <hi>Novel,</hi> tempting
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0244701300:6"/>
them to the peruſal of many a perſuaſive <hi>Sermon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In order to render theſe Letters more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely uſeful, in this volume are collected their various important <hi>Maxims,</hi> digeſted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their general heads; with <hi>references</hi> from each Maxim to its proper volume and page. A work this, that has not been more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of trouble, than (I preſume) it will be of entertainment and advantage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sententious Maxims</hi> and <hi>Moral Aphoriſms,</hi> col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting into a point, and conciſely, but ſtrongly, expreſſing <hi>elevated thoughts, beautiful ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> or <hi>inſtructive leſſons,</hi> have always been well received by the public. They have been conſidered as the firſt ſtrokes of a picture, in which are ſeen the juſtneſs and beauty of the painter's deſign, though it has not the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring.</p>
            <p>The <hi>maxims of ſtate,</hi> for inſtance, drawn up by Lord HALIFAX, have been greatly eſteemed; as being the reſult of long expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and ſound policy. And the <hi>maxims</hi> of ROCHEFOUCAULT have met with a reception perhaps too favourable; as their tendency
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0244701300:7"/>
ſeems to be, to <hi>diſgrace human nature,</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all the virtues.</hi> And indeed the tranſlator of them ſays, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I muſt confeſs, I have not read any thing in this age, that has given me a greater <hi>contempt</hi> for man."</q>
            </p>
            <p>The very reverſe of this, is the plan on which the following Maxims are grounded; namely, on <hi>the real</hi> dignity <hi>of human nature,</hi> in order to animate man to act up to his genuine greatneſs. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"It exhibits man, as he really is; a compound, probationary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: fallen indeed from the primitive <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> of his nature, yet ſtill great and amiable in the <hi>ſincerity</hi> of his virtues: fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently rebelling againſt the ſacred laws of reaſon and revelation, and then always an enemy to his own happineſs, and the peace of ſociety: But ſometimes ſo worthily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the graces and the gifts of heaven, as to ſecure the bleſſing of others, and the applauſe of his own mind; and advancing, within his proper ſphere of action, the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of himſelf and his fellow-creatures, by a life exemplary in all the duties of a Man and of a Chriſtian!"</q>
            </p>
            <p>Such is the great plan, ſuch the benevolent
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0244701300:8"/>
ſcheme, of thoſe three collections of <hi>Familiar Letters;</hi> which have been already tranſlated into ſeveral foreign languages, and received in our own country with uncommon favour. But as the <hi>narrative</hi> part of thoſe Letters was only meant as a vehicle for the <hi>inſtructive,</hi> no wonder that many readers, who are deſirous of fixing in their minds thoſe maxims which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve notice diſtinct from the ſtory that firſt introduced them, ſhould have often wiſhed and preſſed to ſee them ſeparate from that chain of engaging incidents that will ſometimes ſteal the moſt fixed attention from its purſuit of ſerious truth.</p>
            <p>For the uſe therefore of all ſuch as are deſirous of <hi>repeatedly inculcating</hi> on their own minds, and the minds of others, the import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant <hi>Maxims,</hi> which thoſe three works con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; and who would <hi>refer</hi> themſelves oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally to the volumes for the illuſtration of theſe maxims; this <hi>General Index</hi> both of <hi>Maxims</hi> and of <hi>References</hi> is now offered to the public in one pocket volume.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only remark farther, that the <hi>Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> may be conſidered as the LIVES of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny eminent perſons, and this collection of
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0244701300:9"/>
               <hi>Maxims,</hi> as the MORALS. And I preſume, to add, with all due deference to the ſentiments of others;—that <hi>Theſe Lives and Morals</hi> will perhaps laſt as long, probably be as much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, and certainly prove much more exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively beneficial (as they deſcribe perſons ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary in <hi>private</hi> and <hi>common</hi> life), than the <hi>Lives and Morals</hi> of the HEROES of the truly illuſtrious philoſopher mentioned in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Preface.</p>

                  <p>THE love of praiſe, and to be flattered and admired, which predominates in the ſex, from ſixteen to ſixty, gives the men great advantages over them, iv. 465. [407].</p>
                  <p>The readineſs with which women are apt to forgive the men who have deceived other women;</p>
                  <p>And that inconſiderate notion of too many of them, <hi>that a reformed rake makes the beſt husband,</hi> are great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements to vile men to continue their profligacy, iv. 466, &amp; ſeq. [407, &amp; ſeq].</p>
                  <p>Virtue and Sobriety are ſurely as beautiful parts of a man's character as of a woman's. The moſt abandon'd of men think theſe Graces indiſpenſable in the women they hope to marry—Shall women of prudence diſpenſe with them in the men they chooſe for partners for life? iv. 467. [408].</p>
                  <p>The fooliſh vanity which ſome women have in the hopes of reforming a wild young fellow, which others of their ſex have in vain tried to do, has often coſt them the happineſs of their lives; and given, at the ſame time, great encouragement to men to continue in their guilt; and to add, to their other vices, that of hypocriſy, if they think the object a prize worth feigning for, iv. 467, 468. [409].</p>
                  <p>The cruelty of women to an unhappy creature, who has been betrayed by the perfidy of her Lover; while they ſcruple not to admit among them the vile ſeducer, is another great encouragement to baſe and artful men, iv. 468. [409].</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>A YOUNG Woman, of whatever degree, who keeps men at a modeſt diſtance, will be ſure to be the more valued for it, even by thoſe who had formed deſigns upon her honour, i. 9. [8].</p>
                  <p>A truly worthy and modeſt Young Woman will value herſelf more on being deſcended from honeſt parents, though poor, than if ſhe were high-born, and her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents unworthy, i. 11. [9].</p>
                  <p>The Young Woman who, at the requeſt of her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended lover, keeps ſecret the indecencies offered to her by him, encourages him to repeat them, i. 26, 27. [22].</p>
                  <p>The anger of a ſuperior to a Young Woman, who has had the virtue to repulſe him, is to be conſidered by her as her glory, i. 28. [23].</p>

                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0244701300:13"/>
She that is more aſhamed of diſhoneſty than of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, will not be eaſily overcome, i. 29. 44, 45. [24. 54].</p>
                  <p>A Young Woman whoſe virtue has been once attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet throws herſelf into the ſame perſon's company, or continues where he is, when ſhe can avoid it, ought to charge herſelf with the conſequences, if ſhe receives new indignities, i. 50. 93. [41. 72, 73.] iii. 254. [201].</p>
                  <p>Thoſe things diſgrace not men, in the eye of the world, which ruin Women, i. 54. [44].</p>
                  <p>The man who is capable of rudeneſs to a Woman, to whom he profeſſes honourable love, ought to be reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as an huſband, by a Woman of virtue and ſpirit, for his ſake, as well as for the ſake of her own honour, i. 64. [52, 53].</p>
                  <p>How much better is it by good fame and integrity, to get every one's good word but one, than by pleaſing that one, to incur the cenſure of every-body elſe! i. 70. [57].</p>
                  <p>A man profeſſing honour to a Woman, has it gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in his power to convince her of his ſincerity by more than words, i. 228. [181.]</p>
                  <p>Wicked men will ſtoop to the moſt degrading mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to obtain a favourite end, i. 338. [270].</p>
                  <p>If a Woman knows a man to be a libertine, yet will, without ſcruple, give him her company, he will think half the ceremony between them is over; and will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably only want an opportunity to make her repent of her confidence in him, iii. 230. [182].</p>
                  <p>When a man wiſhes a Young Woman of inferior cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances to confide in his <hi>Honour,</hi> he ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite, and not leave it to her to explain, in her own perhaps <hi>too</hi> hopeful way, what he means by the word. In ſhort, the word <hi>Marriage</hi> is as ſoon ſpoken as the word <hi>Honour,</hi> iii. 437. [345].</p>
                  <p>Men frequently take little liberties with Women; and as thoſe are received, are encouraged or diſcouraged from greater; ſo that it is in a Woman's power, effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to over-awe an audacious preſumer; and obtain even ſuch a one's good opinion and eſteem, iii. 469 to 473. [371 to 375].</p>
                  <p>A Young Woman will be in leſs danger when ſhe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0244701300:14"/>
rather fears an enemy in the acquaintance ſhe favours of the other ſex, than hopes a friend; eſpecially as ſo much depends upon the iſſue either of her doubt, or of her confidence, iv. 446. [390].</p>
                  <p>A prudent Woman will not want to be reminded, with regard to her conduct to fops, coxcombs, and pretty fellows, that ſhe is not always ſecure in their company, by her ſuperior good ſenſe; ſince good Generals truſting to their ſtrength and ſkill, have been often defeated by a weak enemy, iv. 447. [391].</p>
                  <p>The wife of a ſelf-admirer muſt expect a very cold and negligent huſband, iv. 448. [392].</p>
                  <p>The Young Woman who will admit into her company any man who ſhall be of opinion, and know it to be <hi>hers,</hi> that it is his province to aſk, hers to deny, will expoſe her reputation, if not her virtue, to great riſques, iv. 449. [393].</p>
                  <p>Preſuming men are always ready to conſtrue every little civility in their own favour, <hi>ibid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Men have generally more hardneſs of heart than Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; whence the latter, when they meet not with men of honour, engage upon very unequal terms, iv. 454. [397].</p>
                  <p>It is ſo cuſtomary with Men to make promiſes and vows, and to ſet light by them when made, that a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ought not to regard any thing they either ſay or vow, that carries not demonſtration with it, <hi>ibid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The difference in the education of men and Women, muſt give the former great advantages over the latter, even where genius's are equal, <hi>ibid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A man who is worthy of the Woman he pretends to love, needs not, generally ſpeaking, take indirect means to obtain her in marriage, iv. 455. [398].</p>
                  <p>Hope, in material caſes, ſhould never be unaccom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by fear, iv. 458. [400].</p>
                  <p>When a Young Woman begins to find in her own heart an inclination to a man, pretending love to her; then, if he be not a man of undoubted honour, is her danger doubled, as ought to be her vigilance; ſince ſhe has <hi>herſelf</hi> to guard againſt, as well as him; iv. 458. [401].</p>
                  <p>A prudent Woman will not truſt to her lover's mercy
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0244701300:15"/>
or honour, but to her own diſcretion; and the rather, as, if he mean well, he himſelf will value her the more for it; if not well, ſhe will detect him the ſooner, <hi>ibid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The doubt which a Woman has of her lover's honour is needful, not only to preſerve her own, but his. If ſhe wrongs him, ſhe can make him amends by inſtances of greater confidence, when ſhe pleaſes: But if yeſterday ſhe granted him little favours, he will not allow her this day to recede; till at laſt, perhaps, ſhe puts herſelf out of her own power into his, in order to manifeſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted-on generoſity of her affection for him, iv. 460. [402.]</p>
                  <p>There have been caſes, where a man himſelf, purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the dictates of his encroaching paſſion, and finding a Woman conceding, has taken advantages, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably at firſt he did not preſume to think of, <hi>ibid.</hi>

                  <p>SLEEP is an admirable nouriſher both to the once young, and the twice young, iv. 329. [285].</p>
                  <p>It is a moſt inconſiderate, fooliſh, and pernicious cuſtom in nurſes, to awaken the Child from its nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſleep, for fear it ſhould ſuffer from hunger, <hi>ibid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nurſes, by cramming and ſtuffing the little bowels of Infants till they are ready to burſt, occaſion indigeſtions, which turn to bad humours, <hi>ibid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Infants can have no corrupt taſte to gratify. All in them is pure, as out of the hand of nature: the food therefore that is given them ſhould be plain; all that is not ſo, muſt vitiate and offend:</p>
                  <p>How bad then is the cuſtom which nurſes have, to mix wine or ſpirituous liquors, however ſmall in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, in their liquid food, on pretence of breaking the wind generated in their bowels! iv. 328. [286.]</p>
                  <p>Children ſhould not be uſed to phyſic. That given them by way of precaution, as it is called, introduces the neceſſity of phyſic. Would a parent beget a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order where there is none? or, by frequent uſe, render the ſalutary force of medicine ineffectual when it was wanted? <hi>ibid.</hi>

                  <p>Every creature has its natural or inſtinctive pointings, as they may be called, teaching it to chooſe its good, and to avoid what is hartful to it.

The wiſeſt ought not to be above attending to the firſt rules for the management of Infants. If the Child has not good health (and are not early rules the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that bleſſing?) its animal functions will play but poorly thro' weak and crazy organs, iv. 330. [287].</p>
                  <p>At two or three years old, or before, the Buds of Childrens minds will begin to open, a watchful Parent will then be employed, like a ſkilful gardener, in defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the flower from blights, and aſſiſting it thro' its ſeveral ſtages to perfection, <hi>ibid.</hi>

                  <p>A FINE or genteel Education is generally of more diſſervice than benefit to a young woman of no fortune, i. 125. [99].</p>
                  <p>People in a high condition generally ſo educate their children, as not to ſuffer them to bear the leaſt contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to their violent wills; which indulgence, as they grow up, multiplies not only their own diſquiets, but thoſe of every one elſe, who have, concerns with them, i. 406. [ii. 32].</p>
                  <p>Tutors ſhould treat their pupils, with regard to ſuch of their faulty habits as cannot eaſily be eradicated, as prudent phyſicians do their patients in chronical caſes; rather with gentle palliatives than harſh extirpatives; which, by means of the reſiſtance given to them by the habit, may create ſuch ferments as may utterly defeat their intention, iv. 305. [265].</p>
                  <p>A generous mind will chooſe to win youth to do its
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0244701300:31"/>
duty, by mildneſs and good uſage, rather than by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, iv. 332. [289].</p>
                  <p>It muſt be painful to ſuch a one to be always incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating on his children or pupils, the doctrine of ſelf-denial, in caſes of an indifferent nature, by methods quite grievous to his own, <hi>ibid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Encouragements given to children, ſhould, however, be innocent ones; and not ſuch as ſhould lead to lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury, either of food or apparel, <hi>ibid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Almighty, by rewards and puniſhments, makes it our intereſt, as well as our duty, to obey him; and can we propoſe to ourſelves, for the government of our children, a better example? <hi>ibid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We muſt not expect from children, at an early age, that they ſhould diſtinguiſh beyond facts, iv. 333. [290].</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Grown</hi> people have an eye to the reward for ſervice performed; nor will deſerve to be thought leſs good or virtuous, that they do a painful duty, and even that they ſubmit to be ſervants, for the reward's ſake, <hi>ibid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Self-denial is indeed an excellent doctrine to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated into children's minds; and it muſt be done early too; but we muſt not be too ſevere in enforcing it; for a duty too rigidly inſiſted on, will make it odious, iv. 334. [290].</p>
                  <p>A child ſhould not be either compelled or induced by rewards, to endeavour to maſter a ſtudy or byaſs (that is not an indiſpenſable requiſite to his future life or morals) to which it ſhews a natural or riveted aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, iv. 335. [292].</p>
                  <p>If the Education and Studies of children were ſuited to their inclinations and capacities, many would be made uſeful members of ſociety, that otherwiſe would make no figure in it, iv. 336. [292].</p>
                  <p>If, as the child grows up, its mind can be raiſed from the love of the reward, to the love of its duty for the duty's ſake, it ſhould by all means be done, iv. 336. [293].</p>
                  <p>The child which can be brought to prefer its duty to its appetites, (<hi>as Mr. Locke propoſes it ſhould</hi>) wants but little of the ſelf-denial of the wiſeſt philoſopher, <hi>ibid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the child refuſes obedience, the parent muſt inſiſt
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0244701300:32"/>
upon it: The neceſſity of uſing ſeverity may be the iſſue: A wiſe parent will therefore make as few things as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible neceſſary parts of its duty, except they are likely to affect its future morals, iv. 337. [293].</p>

                  <p>An acquaintance with the muſes, in the Education of youth, contributes not a little to ſoften the manners. It gives a delicate turn to the imagination, and a kind of poliſh to the mind in ſeverer ſtudies, iv. 353. [308].</p>
                  <p>However, it is not to wiſhed, that a youth ſhould have ſuch ſtrong inclinations that way, as to make that delightful amuſement his predominant paſſion; ſince we ſee very few poets whoſe warm imaginations do not run away with their judgments, iv. 354. [308].</p>
                  <p>And yet, in order to learn the dead languages in their purity, it will be neceſſary to ſtudy the antient poets; which cannot fail of giving youth a reliſh for poetry in general, <hi>ibid.</hi>

                  <p>It will be a ſecurer as well as more laudable method, for parents to inſiſt upon the regular behaviour of the whole family, than to expect that the child and its tutor ſhall be the only good ones in it, iv. 355. [310].</p>
                  <p>Nor is this ſo difficult to be effected, as ſome may imagine. If, on the hiring of a new ſervant, ſobriety of manners, and a virtuous converſation be inſiſted upon, as indiſpenſible conditions of their continuing in their ſervice; and if the principals take care to ſupport their injunctions by their own example, it would be ſeen, that if their ſervice did not find them good, it would make them ſo, iv. 356.

                  <p>And why ſhould not this be thought a practicable ſcheme, when it is conſidered, that ſervants, when taken, are generally at years of diſcretion; and have the ſtrong tie of intereſt, ſuperadded to the duty we require of them, to influence them; and which they muſt needs know (let them have contracted habits ever ſo evil) are as right for them to diſcharge, as for us to exact from them? iv. 356, 357.

                  <p>There may be a decent pride in humility, iv. 303. [264].</p>
                  <p>A young lady may behave with ſo much true dignity, as ſhall command reſpect by the turn of her eye, ſooner than by aſſuming ſpeech, <hi>ibid.</hi>

                  <p>Next, we are to be indulged and favoured at SCHOOL. Our learning generally ſucceeds with us accordingly; and we reward our maſters as we did our nurſes, with greater inſtances of our inſolence than obſervance, ii. 346. [314].</p>
                  <p>After our wiſe parents have <hi>bribed</hi> our way thro' the cuſtomary forms, we are brought home, very little im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved in our learning; and then our PARENTS take their deſerved turn, <hi>ibid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After we have, perhaps, half broken their hearts, a WIFE is looked out for the young man. Family and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune are the firſt motives; affection, if at all to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0244701300:49"/>
the laſt. And two people thus educated, thus from their infancy indulged (the woman, in her way no leſs humoured, and even more neglected in her educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than the man) are brought together; and what can be expected, but that they ſhould moſt cordially join, when married, to plague each other? <hi>ibid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither of them having ever been ſubject to controul, nor hardly to contradiction, the man cannot bear it from one, whoſe new relation to him, and vow of obedience, he thinks ſhould oblige her to yield up her will entirely to his, ii. 347. [315].</p>
                  <p>The lady, well-read in nothing, perhaps, but romances, thinks it very ungallant, now, for the firſt time to be controuled, and that by the man from whom ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected nothing but tenderneſs, <hi>ibid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So great the difference between what they both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect <hi>from,</hi> and find <hi>in,</hi> each other, no wonder that miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtandings happen; that theſe ripen into quarrels; that acts of unkindneſs paſs, <hi>ibid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Appeals to parents and guardians often enſue. If by mediation of friends a reconciliation takes place, it hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ever holds; for why? The fault is in the <hi>minds</hi> of both, and neither of them thinks ſo;</p>
                  <p>Whence the wound, not permitted to be probed, is but ſkinned over; and, at laſt breaks out with more violence than before;</p>
                  <p>Separate beds are often the conſequence: Perhaps elopements; guilty ones ſometimes: If not an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querable indifference; poſſibly, averſion, <hi>ibid.</hi>

and deeming every inſtance of diſcretion and prudence, and even too often of virtue, an act of rebellion againſt its uſurped authority, iii. 77. [61].</p>

                  <p>Wrong methods taken with a generous ſpirit, in a ſuppoſed beginning Love, are often the means of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the event moſt dreaded; and which, perhaps, but for thoſe wrong methods, would have come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, iv. 251.

                  <p>The paſſion which is generally dignified by the name of Love, and which puts its votaries upon a thouſand extravagancies, uſually owes its Being rather to ungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned fancy, than to ſolid judgment, iv. 459. [401].</p>
                  <p>Were we to judge of it by the conſequences that uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally attend it, it ought rather to be called raſhneſs, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, weakneſs, any thing, but Love, <hi>ibid.</hi>

                  <p>SHE who can glory in the honeſty of her poor pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, is likely to be ſuperior to Temptations, i. 20. [16].</p>
                  <p>Temptations are ſore things; but without them, we know not ourſelves, nor what we are able to do, i. 29. [24].</p>
                  <p>Temptations ſhould be avoided. It is preſumptuous to truſt to our own ſtrength, i. 29. 56. [24. 46].</p>
                  <p>Women who give way to Temptation, contribute all in their power to make libertines think the whole ſex alike, i. 109. [85].</p>
                  <p>A generous woman tempted by her ſuperior, may not be proof againſt his kindneſs, tho' ſhe might againſt his anger. Such an one therefore ſhould fly from a Tempter, that can change his behaviour to her from the one to the other, i. 133. [106].</p>
                  <p>An honeſt heart is not to be truſted with itſelf in bad company, i. 243. [193].</p>
                  <p>None are tried or tempted beyond the power given them to reſiſt, i. 287. [229].</p>

                  <p>The age of young gentlemen, from ſixteen to twenty-one, an improper one to ſet out upon their travels; and why, iv. 430. [376].</p>
                  <p>Mr. Locke thinks from ſeven to fourteen, a much more eligible one, <hi>ibid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the reaſons he gives for this age determine not, he propoſes, that the young man's Travelling be ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, till that more ſedate time of life, when he may travel without a tutor, and be able to make his own obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and is thoroughly acquainted with the laws and faſhions, the natural and moral advantages and defects, of his own country, iv. 431. [376, 377].</p>
                  <p>Pamela deſcants on the advantages a youth may reap by home travelling, before he enters upon a foreign tour; propoſing the age of fourteen or fifteen for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning it, by excurſions in the ſummer months, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his other ſtudies, and as a diverſion to him, <hi>ibid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>She is of opinion, that theſe excurſions might be made to moſt advantage in company of his father, as well as tutor, and gives her reaſon for it, <hi>ibid.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>That the young man viſit the ſea-coaſts, as well as inland parts of Great Britain and Ireland, and the other principal circumjacent iſlands, iv. 432, 433. [378].</p>
                  <p>That he look into the art of navigation; the curious ſtructure of a ſhip, as he is a native of the greateſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime kingdom in the world: From which knowlege, tho' but in theory, he will be taught to love and value the Britiſh ſailors, an uſeful and brave ſet of men, who
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0244701300:86"/>
are the natural defence and ſafeguard of the realm, iv. 433. [378].</p>
                  <p>With the advantages which he will obtain by this knowlege of his own country, he will be qualified to go abroad, and be better able to judge of the different cuſtoms, manners, and forms of government of foreign countries, iv. 433. [379].</p>
                  <p>All his enquiries will be pertinent and manly: All occaſions of that ignorant wonder, which expoſes to ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule the raw young men ſent abroad, would be taken away. He would make the beſt acquaintance, having ſomething to inform them of in relation to his own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, in return for the information they give him of theirs. He would contract worthy friendſhips, and be looked upon as one of the riſing genius's of his country, <hi>ibid.</hi>

                  <p>The love of a man who chooſes a woman for the beauties of her mind, will be augmented, if ſhe juſtifies his motive by her prudent conduct, tho' thoſe of perſon fade, ii. 169. [170].</p>
                  <p>An high fortune is but an accidental advantage, and ſet againſt the riches of the mind, and an unblemiſhed virtue, weighs little in the ſcale, ii. 185. [183].</p>
                  <p>The great, tho' at the time they may be diſpleaſed that they are not obliged in an unjuſt command, will, generally, when they conſider the caſe, value the more for it the ſervant or humble friend who diſobliges them from principle, ii. 337. [306].</p>
                  <p>Women of birth and education who forfeit their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, are much more inexcuſable, than thoſe of meaner degree, who have not had the opportunities they have had, of knowing their duty, iv. 239. [207].</p>
                  <p>The failure of the latter may proceed from ignorance; but that of the well-bred will be attributed to inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or appetite; and, not to mention ſuperior motives to duty, what a diſgrace does that bring upon their ſex, what a triumph does it give to the other? iv. 204. 207.

                  <p>MR. <hi>B. acquaints his Pamela with what his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his wife's behaviour to him, would have been, had ſhe been a princeſs; as follows:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I muſt have been morally ſure, <hi>ſays he,</hi> that ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred me to all other men. She muſt have borne with my imperfections. She muſt have ſtudied my temper: And if ever ſhe had any points to carry, any deſire of overcoming, it muſt have been by ſweetneſs and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance:</p>
                  <p>And yet, <hi>ſays he,</hi> not ſuch a ſlaviſh one, as ſhould make her condeſcenſion ſeem to be rather the effect of her inſenſibility, than of her judgment and affection:</p>
                  <p>I ſhould have thought I ought not to have deſired any thing of her, that was not reaſonable to be complied with; and that then ſhe ſhould have ſhewn no reluctance, uneaſineſs, or doubt, to oblige me, even at half a word;</p>
                  <p>Yet if I were not always in the right, I ſhould expect that ſhe ſhould bear with me, if ſhe ſaw me determined; and that ſhe ſhould expoſtulate with me on the right ſide of compliance;</p>
                  <p>This would have ſhewn me, that ſhe differed from me, not for contradiction ſake; but deſired to convince me for my own; and that I ſhould another time take fitter reſolutions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:0244701300:90"/>
In all companies ſhe muſt have ſhewn, that ſhe had an high opinion of, and regard for me, whether altogether deſerved, or not.</p>
                  <p>And this the rather, as ſuch a regard would be not only a reputation, but a ſecurity to herſelf; ſince, if libertines ever attempt a married woman, their firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement, next to their own vanity, ariſes from her known indifference to, or contempt of, her huſband.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould have expected, therefore, that ſhe would draw a kind veil over my faults: That ſuch as ſhe could not hide, ſhe would endeavour to extenuate; and ſhew to every one, that I had <hi>her</hi> good opinion, whatever liberties the world took with my character.</p>
                  <p>She muſt have valued my friends for my ſake; been chearful and eaſy, whomſoever I brought home with me; and whatever faults ſhe had obſerved in me, have never blamed me before company; much leſs, with ſuch an air, as ſhould have ſhewn, that ſhe had a better opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of her own judgment than of mine.</p>
                  <p>I know, <hi>proceeds he,</hi> my own imperfections: They are many and great; yet I will not allow that they ſhould excuſe thoſe of my Wife; or give her room to imagine I will bear faults in her, which ſhe <hi>can</hi> rectify, becauſe ſhe ſees greater in me.</p>
                  <p>Upon the whole, I expect, <hi>adds he to his Pamela,</hi> that you will bear with me, till, and only till, you find me capable of returning inſult for condeſcenſion; and till you think I ſhall be ſo mean, as to be the gentler for negligent or pertinacious treatment.</p>
                  <p>And then (your behaviour ſuch) I ſhould ſcorn my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, if there were one privilege of a Wife, that a princeſs, were ſhe my Wife, might expect to be indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, that I would not allow to you, ii. 349, <hi>&amp; ſeq.</hi> [316, <hi>&amp; ſeq.</hi>]</p>

                  <p>EVERY one's eyes are upon the conduct, the viſits, the viſitors of a young Lady made early independent, i. 120. [125].</p>
                  <p>Encroaching and deſigning men make an artillery of a woman's hopes and fears, and play it upon her at their pleaſure, i. 122. [126].</p>
                  <p>Artful men frequently endeavour to entangle thoughtleſs women by bold ſuppoſals and offers, and, if not checked, to reckon upon ſilence as conceſſion, i. 143. [149].</p>
                  <p>Women ſhould be cautious how they give up their own ſex in converſation with the other, in articles that relate to delicacy, i. 177. 267. [183. 276, 277].</p>
                  <p>Women, however prudent and reſerved, ſhould be careful that they do not give the man they intend to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage, reaſon to think that they balance on other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions, i. 194, 195. 200. [i. 202. 208. iii. 173].</p>
                  <p>Men who want to get a woman into their power, ſeldom ſcruple the means, i. 241. [250].</p>
                  <p>A woman who lends an ear to a Seducer, may, by <hi>gentle</hi> words, be <hi>inſenſibly</hi> drawn in to the perpetration of the moſt <hi>violent</hi> acts, ii. 162. [248].</p>
                  <p>When women once enter themſelves as Lovers, there is hardly any receding, ii. 209. iii. 153. [ii. 293. iii. 289, 290].</p>
                  <p>The man can have no good deſign, who affects to a meek-ſpirited woman an anger which is evidently ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nageable, ii. 274. [iii. 13].</p>
                  <p>A daughter ought to look upon a man, who would tempt her to go off with him clandeſtinely, as the vileſt and moſt ſelfiſh of ſeducers, ii. 279. [iii. 18.]</p>
                  <p>The woman who will correſpond with a known Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertine, indirectly defies him to do his worſt, ii. 319. v. 68. [iii. 56. v. 318].</p>
                  <p>A woman who is above flattery, and deſpiſes all praiſe but that which flows from the approbation of her own

heart, is, <hi>morally ſpeaking,</hi> out of the reach of ſeduction, ii. 337. [iii. 73].</p>
                  <p>Women ought to be careful not to give cauſe to the man they love, to think lightly of them, for favours, granted even to himſelf, which may be ſuppoſed to ſpring from natural weakneſs, ii. 345. [iii. 81].</p>
                  <p>Women ought not to think gentleneſs of heart de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable in a man, ii. 397. vi. 401. [iii. 130. vii. 333].</p>
                  <p>That man's natural diſpoſition is to be ſuſpected, whoſe politeneſs is not regular, nor conſtant, nor wrought into habit; but appears only in fits, ſtarts, and ſallies, iii. 7. [152].</p>
                  <p>An acknowleged Love ſanctifies every little freedom; and little freedoms beget great ones, iii. 24. [168].</p>
                  <p>To give a woman an high opinion of her own ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, is the meaſure that a deſigning man often takes to bring her to his will, iii. 25. [168].</p>
                  <p>I love, when I dig a pit, <hi>ſays Lovelace,</hi> to have my prey tumble in with ſecure feet and open eyes; for then a man can look down upon her with an O-ho, charmer! how came you there? iii. 25. [168].</p>
                  <p>A woman in courtſhip, for her own ſake, ſhould ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have to the man ſhe intends to marry, as to ſhew the world, that ſhe thinks him worthy of reſpect, iii. 30. [173].</p>
                  <p>Libertines conſider all thoſe of the Sex over whom they obtain a power, as fair prize, iii. 103. iv. 156. [iii. 242. iv. 355].</p>
                  <p>There ſeldom can be <hi>peculiarity</hi> in the love of a rakiſh heart, iii. 106. [245].</p>
                  <p>The confidence which a woman places in a man, for his reſpectful behaviour to her, ought to be withdrawn the moment ſhe ſees in him an abatement of that reverence or reſpect, which begot her confidence, iii. 153. [290].</p>
                  <p>If a woman be not angry at indecent pictures or verſes ſhewn her by a Libertine, but ſmiles at them, ſhe may blame herſelf, if ſhe ſuffer from his after-attempts, iii. 145. [282].</p>

Even innocent freedoms are not to be allowed to a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertine, iii. 146. [282].</p>
                  <p>To be puniſhed by the conſequences of our own choice, what a moral, <hi>inſultingly ſays Lovelace,</hi> lies there! iii. 148. v. 13. [285. v. 259].</p>

                  <p>The man who complains of the diſtance a Lady keeps him at, wants to come <hi>too near,</hi> iii. 150. [289].</p>
                  <p>A man who means honourably will not be fond of treading in crooked paths, iii. 156. [293].</p>
                  <p>How vain a thing is it for a woman, who has put her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the power of a man, to ſay, what ſhe <hi>will</hi> or will <hi>not</hi> do! iii. 158. [294, 295].</p>

                  <p>The man who makes a flagrant, tho' unſucceſsful at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and is forgiven, or expoſtulated with, meets with encouragement to renew it at an opportunity which he may think more favourable, iii. 188. 269. iv. 134. <hi>See alſo</hi> iii. 21.

                  <p>Women of penetration, falling <hi>accidentally</hi> into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with a Libertine and his aſſociates, will make them reflecting-glaſſes to one another for her own ſervice, iii. 211. [343].</p>
                  <p>One devious ſtep, at firſt ſetting out, frequently leads a perſon into a wilderneſs of doubt and error, iii. 250. [iv. 37].</p>

                  <p>Libertines, in order the better to carry on their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns upon the unwary of the Female Sex, <hi>particularly againſt thoſe who are prudiſh,</hi> frequently make pretences to <hi>Platonic Love,</hi> iii. 357. [iv. 142].</p>

him, let her beware of an encroacher, iii. 361. [iv. 146].</p>
                  <p>The Libertine, who by his ſpecious behaviour can lay aſleep a woman's ſuſpicion and caution, is in the way to complete all his views, iii. 390. [iv. 175].</p>
                  <p>If a woman will keep company with a man who has reaſon to think himſelf ſuſpected by her, <hi>I am ſure, ſays Lovelace,</hi> it is a very hopeful ſign, <hi>ibid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Women are apt to allow too much to a kneeling Lover, iv. 26. [215].</p>
                  <p>Nine parts in ten of women who fall, <hi>ſays Lovelace,</hi> owe their diſgrace to their own vanity, or levity, or to want of circumſpection and proper reſerve, iv. 46. [237].</p>
                  <p>Libertines, <hi>equally tyrannical and ſuſpicious,</hi> expect that a wife ſhould have no will, no eyes, no love, no hate, but at their direction, iv. 57. [248].</p>
                  <p>Travelling together gives opportunities of familiarity between the Sexes, <hi>ſays Lovelace,</hi> iv. 62. [253]. <hi>Women therefore ſhould be choice of the company they travel with.</hi>

                  <p>Women ſhould be early taught to think highly of their ſex; for pride, <hi>as Lovelace ſays,</hi> is an excellent ſubſtitute to virtue, iv. 117. [313].</p>
                  <p>A woman of the brighteſt talents, who throws herſelf into the power of a Libertine, brings into queſtion thoſe talents, as well as her diſcretion, not only with himſelf, but with his lewd companions, to whom, in ſecret tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, he will be proud to ſhew his prize, iv. 146. vi. 131.

                  <p>A man, whatever are his profeſſions, always thinks the worſe of a woman, who forgives him for making an attempt on her virtue, v. 49. [297].</p>
                  <p>A man, who offers indecencies to a woman, depends for ſecrecy and forgiveneſs upon his own confidence, and her baſhfulneſs, v. 70. [320].</p>

The woman who in Courtſhip treats haughtily or ill the man ſhe intends to have, gives room for the world to think, either, That ſhe has a mean opinion of him, a high one of herſelf, vi. 305- [vii. 231.]—</p>

                  <p>Such a woman gives reaſon to free livers to ſuppoſe (and to preſume upon it) that the man to whom ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to give her hand has no ſhare in her heart, vi, 305. [vii. 232].</p>

                  <p>That by inſiſting on little points, ſhe aims not to come at, or to ſecure, great ones, perhaps not proper to be carried:</p>
                  <p>Nor leaves room to ſuppoſe that ſhe thinks ſhe has ſo much cauſe to doubt her own merit, as to make it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to put her Lover upon diſagreeable or arrogant trials:</p>
                  <p>But lets reaſon be the principal guide of her actions:</p>
                  <p>And then ſhe will hardly ever fail of that reſpect which will make her judgment <hi>after</hi> marriage conſulted, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with a preference to a man's own; at other times as a delightful confirmation of his, vi. 307. [vii. 233, 234].</p>

                  <p>PRIDE, in people of birth and fortune, is not only mean, but needleſs, i. 186. [193].</p>
                  <p>Diſtinction and quality may be prided in, by thoſe to whom it is a <hi>new</hi> thing, <hi>ibid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The contempt a proud great perſon brings on himſelf, is a counterbalance for his greatneſs, <hi>ibid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is ſometimes eaſier to lay a proud man under obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than to get him to acknowlege it, i. 322. [ii. 13].</p>
                  <p>Pride ever muſt, and ever will, provoke contempt, i. 186. [ii. 13].</p>
                  <p>There may be ſuch an haughtineſs in ſubmiſſion, as may entirely invalidate the ſubmiſſion, ii. 72. [162].</p>
                  <p>A perſon who diſtinguiſhes not, may think it the mark of a great ſpirit to humour his own Pride, even at the expence of his politeneſs, ii. 73. [163].</p>
                  <p>It is to be feared there are more good and laudable actions owing to Pride, than to Virtue, ii. 207. [291].</p>
                  <p>Pride and meanneſs are as nearly allied to each other, as the poets tell us wit and madneſs are, ii. 231. [314].</p>
                  <p>Nothing more effectually brings down a proud ſpirit, than a ſenſe of lying under pecuniary obligation, ii. 388. [iii. 121, 122].</p>
                  <p>Pride, when it is native, will ſhew itſelf ſometimes in the midſt of mortifications, iii. 33. [177].</p>
                  <p>Pride frequently eats up a man's prudence, iii. 239. [iv. 27].</p>

Pride is an infallible ſign of weakneſs, or ſomething wrong, either in the heart or head, or in both, iii. 240. [iv. 28].</p>
                  <p>It is poſſible for a woman to be proud, in ſuppoſing ſhe has no Pride, iv. 9. [196].</p>
                  <p>We ought not to value ourſelves on talents we give not to ourſelves, iv. 30. vii. 272. [iv. 218. viii. 197].</p>
                  <p>How contemptible is that Pride which ſtands upon diminutive obſervances, and gives up the moſt important duties! iv. 30. [219].</p>
                  <p>Some women have from Pride, what others [<hi>more laudably</hi>] have from principle. The Lord help the Sex, <hi>ſays Lovelace,</hi> if they had not Pride! v. 11. [257].</p>
                  <p>Pride or Arrogance invites mortification, v. 382. [vi. 301].</p>
                  <p>Haughty ſpirits, when they are convinced that they have carried their reſentments too high, frequently want but a good excuſe to condeſcend, vi. 371. [vii. 301].</p>
                  <p>Pride in man or woman is an extreme, that hardly fails, ſooner or later, to bring forth its mortifying con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, vi. 406. [vii. 399].</p>
                  <p>Perſons of accidental or ſhadowy merit may be proud; but inborn worth, muſt be always as much above conceit as arrogance, vii. 272. [viii. 197].</p>
                  <p>There is but one pride pardonable; that of being above doing a baſe or diſhonourable action, vii. 272. <hi>See alſo</hi> i. 186. [viii. 198. <hi>See alſo</hi> i. 193].</p>

                  <p>THE trials of the Prudent are generally proportioned to their Prudence, i. 3. [3].</p>

                  <p>Prudence will oblige a woman to forbear complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or making an appeal, againſt her huſband, i. 199. [207].</p>

                  <p>A prudent and good perſon, who has been a little miſled, will do all in her power to recover, as ſoon as poſſible, her loſt path, iii. 275. [iv. 61].</p>
                  <p>To avoid the ſuppoſed diſgrace of retractation, a prudent perſon will be backward to give her opinion in company of perſons noted for their ſuperior talents, iii. 276. [iv. 62].</p>
                  <p>A wiſe woman, deſpiſing the imputation of prudery on one hand, and coquetry on the other, will form her conduct according to what her own heart tells her of the <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>unfit;</hi> and look upon the opinion of the world as matter only of ſecondary conſideration, iii. 312. [iv. 97].</p>
                  <p>Prudent perſons will not need to be convinced, by their <hi>own</hi> misfortunes, of the truth of what common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience daily demonſtrates, vi. 158. [vii. 74].</p>

                  <p>A BENEVOLENT-MINDED man may be led into errors and raſhneſs, even by the warmth of his Benevolence, i. 370. [ii. 55].</p>
                  <p>Good oeconomy is very compatible with Beneficence, ii. 30. [131].</p>
                  <p>The charities which a good man will wiſh to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, are,</p>
                  <p>To give little fortunes to young maidens in marriage with honeſt men of their own degree;—</p>
                  <p>To extend his munificence to the induſtrious poor of all perſuaſions, reduced by age, infirmity, or accident;—</p>
                  <p>To thoſe who labour under incurable maladies;—</p>
                  <p>And to the youth of either ſex, who are capable of beginning the world with advantage, but have not the means; ii. 273. [iii. 17].</p>
                  <p>The man who eſteems not Benevolence in another, wants it himſelf; ii. 346. [iii. 90].</p>
                  <p>Such is the bleſſing of a benevolent heart, that, let the world frown as it will, it cannot poſſibly bereave it of all happineſs; ſince it can rejoice in the proſperity of others, iii. 36. [196].</p>
                  <p>A feeling heart is a bleſſing, that no man who has it would be without, iii. 214. [374].</p>
                  <p>It is alſo a moral ſecurity of innocence; ſince the

                  <p>The bare mention of a behaviour greatly generous, in another, will warm and diſcover a beneficent heart, iii. 285. [iv. 71].</p>

                  <p>Succeſsful Gameſters, who, before they play'd, were poſſeſſed of fortunes which would have enabled them to anſwer the ſtakes they play'd for, had they been loſers, have ſome plea to make to the loſer, <hi>ibid.</hi>

                  <p>If the loſer would have exacted payment from them,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0244701300:282"/>
had he been a winner, he ought not to complain if they are rigorous to him, iv. 196. [v. 67].</p>
                  <p>The man who calls in the laws of his country to his aid, when he has been a loſer, will have this benefit, that he can never again be ſeen in the ſame company, <hi>ibid.</hi>

                  <p>A juſt man will diveſt himſelf of his whole fortune, if neceſſary, for the ſatisfaction of his creditors, and live within the pittance their generoſity will allot him for ſubſiſtence, iv. 197. [v. 68].</p>

                  <p>Yet who will ſay, that he who hopes to win what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to another, does not deſerve to loſe his own? <hi>ibid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A loſer at play will have the leſs reaſon for regretting the unhappy ſituation to which he has reduced himſelf, if his loſſes bring him to a right ſenſe of his folly, iv. 399. [v. 270].</p>

                  <p>Love gilds every object that bears a relation to the object beloved, iv. 27. [199].</p>
                  <p>There is, <hi>ſays Lady</hi> G. a great deal of free-maſonry in Love: The ſecret, like that, when found out, is hardly worth the knowing [The Paphian Love ſhe muſt mean] iv. 84. [256].</p>
                  <p>Love, however, at beſt, is a flame founded on a but ſuppoſed merit. The proof may be wanting in matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, iv. 203. [v. 74].</p>
                  <p>What is that Love which we women, <hi>ſays Lady G.</hi> vow at the altar? Surely not adoration, iv. 246. [v. 117].</p>

Not a preference of that object abſolutely, as in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence ſuperior to every imaginable being, iv. 246. [v. 117].</p>

                  <p>Young women often go on courageouſly with a Lover, while the end in view is diſtant, or there have been dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties to encounter with, iv. 261. [v. 132].</p>

                  <p>A man of ſenſe, in Love, will preſerve his dignity; yet, for his own ſake, will give conſequence to the lady whom he one day hopes to call his wife, v. 133. [vi. 111].</p>
                  <p>Love will plead for its votary in a ſingle breaſt, when conſultation on the ſuppoſed fit and unfit (the object ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) will produce delay, v. 168. [vi. 146].</p>

                  <p>Love on one ſide, diſcretion on the other, is much better than love on both; ſince in the latter caſe, if the Love be of the uſual giddy ſort, there can be no room at all for diſcretion, v. 186. [vi. 164].</p>
                  <p>Love ever makes a woman think meanly of herſelf, in proportion as ſhe thinks highly of the object, v. 196. [vi. 174].</p>

                  <p>The man whom a lady may ſafely encourage with a view to happineſs, is he who is diſtinguiſhed by the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs of his manners, by the evenneſs of his temper; by his general deſire to oblige; iv. 42. [214].</p>

                  <p>OLD Bachelors often inſiſt upon qualities in a wife for themſelves or relations, not one of which perhaps the choſen woman, if they marry, will have, i. 36. [<hi>ibid</hi>].</p>

Women who have had no lovers, or, having had lovers, have not found a huſband, have, perhaps, as men go, rather had a miſs than a loſs, i. 326. [ii. 11].</p>
                  <p>Thoſe women who join with the men, in their ridicule of Old Maids, ought not to be forgiven, if the ſingle ſtate, and not the bad qualities of the perſon, is what they mean to expoſe, <hi>ibid.</hi>

                  <p>A ſingle woman, tho' either diſappointed, or not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to, has infinitely leſs cares, leſs anxieties to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with, than a married one, ii. 146. [247].</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Would a woman who ridicules Old Maids, have one think that ſhe is over-joyed that ſhe has put it out of any one's power to reproach <hi>her</hi> on that account? v. 13. [284].</p>
                  <p>If ſo, how thankful, on all occaſions, ought ſhe to be to the man who has ſo generouſly kept her from the odium! <hi>ibid.</hi>

                  <p>It looks like a want of decency in women, to caſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions on others of their own ſex (for what?) probably for their prundence and virtue, <hi>ibid.</hi>

                  <p>An unſupported ſtate is better than an oppreſſed, a miſerable one, vi. 209. [vii. 209].</p>

Sprightly perſons often make it neceſſary for them to aſk two forgiveneſſes inſtead of one, ii. 165. [266].</p>
                  <p>That ſpecies of Wit, which cannot ſhine without a foil, is not a Wit to be proud of, ii. 381. [iii. 125].</p>
                  <p>A Witty Woman ſhould not think of marrying a man of inferior underſtanding, if ſhe cannot reſolve to ſhield him, not only againſt her own, but every other perſon's ridicule, ii. 393. [iii. 137].</p>
                  <p>Such a one ſhould confine her vivacities to time and place, ii. 394. [iii. 138].</p>
                  <p>The lively woman, who has not the offer of a man of underſtanding ſuperior to her own, ſhould encourage the addreſſes of one who will be likely to allow the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of hers, ii. 401. [iii. 145].</p>
                  <p>A Witty Woman's vivacity may leſs become the wife, than the ſingle woman, iii. 3. [163].</p>
                  <p>Vivacity ſhould never carry us beyond the bounds of prudence and diſcretion, iii. 7. [167].</p>
                  <p>Witty people ſeem to think they cannot ſhew their own conſequence, but by putting a fool's coat on the back of a friend, iii. 72. [232].</p>
                  <p>Sterling Wit requires not a foil to ſet it off, <hi>ibid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is ſometimes the misfortune of a Witty Woman her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſometimes that of her companions, that ſhe cannot <hi>help</hi> being Witty, iii. 348. [iv. 134].</p>
                  <p>Witlings ſtudy for their pleaſantries, and hunt for oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions to be ſmart, iv. 54. [226].</p>

                  <p>It is difficult for Young Perſons of genius to rein-in their imaginations, i. 21. [<hi>ibid</hi>].</p>
                  <p>Such are apt rather to ſay all that <hi>may</hi> be ſaid, on their favourite topics, than what is <hi>proper</hi> to be ſaid, <hi>ibid.</hi>

                  <p>It is a great virtue in good-natured Youth to be able to ſay NO, i. 238. [<hi>ibid</hi>].</p>
                  <p>Young Men of character and ability ſhould not be put to difficulties at their entrance into the world. The greateſt expences are then incurred; and in ſcanty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings, ſcanty plans muſt be laid, and purſued, ii. 344. [iii. 88].</p>

                  <p>Good-nature is the characteriſtic of Youth, iii. 185. [345].</p>

               <p>I Write to your commands ſent me yeſterday.</p>
               <p>I have no intention of purſuing further the Hiſtory of Sir CHARLES GRANDISON: And hope, when you conſider the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the Story, you will be of opinion, that it ends very properly where it does; tho' at the firſt peruſal it may ſeem, to a Lady who honours the piece with her approbation, to conclude a little abruptly; and the rather, as the neceſſary delay in publiſhing the laſt volume, occaſioned by the treatment I met with from Dublin, made perſons imagine that marvellous events, and violent cataſtrophes, were preparing; and but for which treatment the three laſt volumes would have been publiſhed together.</p>
               <p>The Story of PAMELA was ſuppoſed to have taken place within thirty years, that of CLARISSA within twenty, of their reſpective publications. In either of thoſe ſpaces of time, there was room to marry and bury half a generation of people.</p>
               <p>That of Sir CHARLES GRANDISON is ſuppoſed to be more recent. In his recital of what paſſed between himſelf and Clementina, long before the Story began, and before he had hopes of being allowed by his Father (then living) to return to England, he mentions the rebellion in 1745 and 1746; and that the exult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations made over him in Italy, on the reported ſucceſs of the young Adventurer, obliged him to go to Vienna.</p>
               <p>What paſſed between him and Clementina, and her Family, on his return from thence to Bologna, till he quitted Italy, and (on his Father's death) arrived in England, may be ſuppoſed to take up a conſiderable ſpace of time.</p>
               <p>He had been about fifteen months in England when the Story begins. That takes up a year and half.</p>
               <p>All this may be ſuppoſed to bring it down pretty near to the preſent time.</p>
               <p>EMILY, under the direction of ſo prudent a guardian, was not, for example ſake, to be married till ſhe was near twenty.</p>
               <p>Lady GRANDISON'S circumſtances and her lying-in, would not
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:0244701300:412"/>
permit her to leave England for a voyage to Italy, ſo ſoon as might be hoped for by Clementina and her friends. Sir Charles had a view, I fanſy, to thoſe delicate circumſtances, when he offered to make them judges of the reaſons, ſhould he and his Harriet be unable to attend them within the next year, why they could not.</p>
               <p>Do you think Harriet would not be a Nurſe as well as Lady G? It would be a deſirable thing, we may ſuppoſe, to all their Italian friends, as well as ſuitable to the maternal fondneſs, for her to take her child with her: But would ſhe do ſo, till it was at leaſt a year old? There is no doubt but it would be a very fine and forward child: But the heir of Sir Charles Grandiſon muſt not be needleſly, or for a compliment, expoſed to dangers and difficulties.

               <p>As to the good JERONYMO, he is happy where he is. Lady G. makes him alive and merry: And have you not an intimation that he is to go to Bath? And do you think that thoſe ſalutary ſprings will not, for the honour of our country, quite eſtabliſh him?</p>
               <p>CLEMENTINA, at the year's end, may either marry the Count of BELVEDERE, her malady not returning; or, as Sir Charles has engaged all her friends to promiſe, may, at her own requeſt, be allowed more time. You have ſeen that the COUNT acquieſces entirely with whatever ſhall be her will, in this particular.</p>
               <p>Do you think, Madam, I have not been very complaiſant to my Readers to leave to them the deciſion of this important article? I am apt to think, from what I have already heard from ſeveral of them, of no ſmall note, and great good ſenſe, that a conſiderable time will paſs before this point will be agreed upon among <hi>them:</hi> And ſome of my correſpondents rejoice that Clementina is not married in the book; hoping that ſhe will never marry; while others expreſs their ſatisfaction in the time given her, and doubt not but ſhe will. Some are pleaſed with the Count; others not. Some are of opinion, with Jeronymo, that her compliance with the ſilent wiſhes of her friends, when left entirely to her own will was the only duty wanting to complete her character; ſhe having voluntarily renounced, ſo nobly as ſhe did, the only man whom ſhe preferred to <hi>him</hi> who was the choice of her parents, and given up her wiſhes to be allowed to take the veil.</p>
               <p>Let us take a ſurvey of what is done for the other characters.</p>
               <p>No more need be ſaid, than is, of EVERARD GRANDISON; or of Aunt ELEANOR.</p>
               <p>Mr. DEANE, you ſee, is provided for, to his own, and every one's content.</p>
               <p>So is good Dr. BARTLETT.</p>
               <p>The ſkilful LOWTHER alſo.</p>
               <p>Sir EDW. BEAUCHAMP and EMILY are in a way to be happy.</p>

Who can be more ſo than Mrs. SHIRLEY? Why, Madam, would you wiſh to have further time taken in, to conclude a life ſo valuable, ſo exemplary?</p>
               <p>Sir ROWLAND and Mr. FOWLER are not unhappy. They are going to Caermarthen; and you remember, Sir Rowland ſays, there are fine girls in Caermarthenſhire.</p>
               <p>Mr. SELBY goes on at Selby-houſe crowing over his Wife, and his Nieces; and, tho' always defeated by their good-humoured arguments, and ſuperior ſenſe, crowing on, and making all around him pleaſant.</p>
               <p>Who can be happier than Mr. and Mrs. REEVES?</p>
               <p>LUCY has already her PEER.</p>
               <p>I could have given NANCY SELBY to Mr. ORME; but that it is not right to put together two perſons who neither of them have entire health, till they are quite recovered; and that would take up time. He, accompanied by his Siſter, is a ſecond time gone to Liſbon, you know. And ſhe, Emily hints, is not without her Lover.</p>
               <p>Miſs ORME is a good girl, and muſt be happy.</p>
               <p>As for GREVILLE and FENWICK, who cares for them?</p>
               <p>The fate of Sir HARGRAVE, of MERCEDA, of BAGENHALL, is abſolutely, and exemplarily, decided.</p>
               <p>JAMES SELBY is as good as provided for: But if he had not, it would not have been much matter.</p>
               <p>Lady BETTY WILLIAMS indeed, and her forward Daughter, and Miſs CANTILLON, are deſervedly unhappy; and there are too many of ſuch characters, in every-body's knowlege, to require <hi>theirs</hi> to be further dwelt upon.</p>
               <p>Lady BEAUCHAMP, Lady MANSFIELD and her family, Lord and Lady W. Lord and Lady L. are all happy. Lord G. alſo. And his CHARLOTTE is as good as <hi>ſhe</hi> can be. Her Lord wiſhes her not better than we leave her.</p>
               <p>Sir CHARLES is the happieſt of men. Plans of his beneficence, oeconomy, charity, have been actually laid down.</p>
               <p>His LADY is, as ſhe deſerves to be, the happieſt of women.</p>
               <p>By what we have ſeen of <hi>both,</hi> we know how they will behave on every future call or occaſion.</p>
               <p>CLEMENTINA, let me add to the notice I have taken of her, is miſtreſs of her own will. By the power Sir Charles, in the articles he drew, ſtipulated for her, we know ſhe will make herſelf happy in acts of beneficence; and, as he has foretold, will ſee every-thing in a chearful light, that before appeared to her in a cloudy one. What will be the reſult?</p>
               <p>LAURANA has been puniſhed, in kind, as we may ſay.</p>
               <p>Lady SFORZA alſo.</p>
               <p>The MARQUIS, the MARCHIONESS, the GENERAL, the BISHOP, in ſhort, the whole <hi>Porretta family,</hi> are happy to the extent of their wiſhes.</p>
               <p>Mrs. BEAUMONT is highly ſo in the general felicity.</p>
               <p>So is Father MARESCOTTI.</p>

Should the ſtory, which were it prolonged to do every-thing that ſeems to be expected, would take up more time, though not quantity of matter, than it has already taken up, be continued for the ſake of OLIVIA? Surely, No.</p>
               <p>Can it, then, be more happily concluded than it is?</p>
               <p>As to what you are pleaſed to hint of the Hero's appearing to ſhine in the parental character, have I not in PAMELA entered into that ſubject pretty largely? And have I not in this hiſtory avoided touching upon the ſame topics that I have treated on in either of the two former?</p>
               <p>But you will be apt to ſay, You expected more on theſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects from Sir Charles's character, than from that of Mr. B. or even of his Pamela.</p>
               <p>But (to ſay nothing of his care for the education of his Father's natural children by Mrs. Oldham) ſee we not, from his tenderneſs to Mrs. Reeves's little boy; from his goodneſs to Lady L's ſon; and to Lady G's little girl; from the obſervation of his Lady, that the Brave are always tender and humane; from his general prudence, as well as from his own duty to a blameable Father, whoſe failings he occaſionally deplored with a piety worthy of himſelf; that he would have ſhone in every part of the parental character? [Who ever knew a dutiful Son that made not a good Father?] And where, and at what age of his children, had I entered into ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, ſhould I have been allowed to ſtop; ſince, as they grew in years, they would have had larger demands on his cares?</p>
               <p>I might indeed, in what <hi>is done,</hi> have introduced a converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in which the Education of Children might have been touched upon, and his opinion given: But the lovers of Story would have found fault with me for it, as they have done with the few inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent converſations that appear in the book, however uſeful others have thought them: And beſides, the occaſion muſt have been forced in. Nor would the ſubject have appeared with the requiſite advantage, handled by, or before, ſingle men and women, or even by young married people, who had no opportunities to ſtrengthen their opinions by experience.</p>
               <p>Permit me further to obſerve, that the concluſion of a <hi>ſingle ſtory</hi> is indeed generally ſome great and deciſive event; as a <hi>Death,</hi> or a <hi>Marriage:</hi> But in ſcenes of life carried down nearly to the preſent time, and in which a <hi>variety of intereſting characters</hi> is introduced, all events cannot be decided, unleſs, as in the Hiſtory of <hi>Tom Thumb the Great,</hi> all the actors are killed in the laſt ſcene; ſince perſons preſumed to be ſtill living, muſt be ſuppoſed liable to the various turns of human affairs.</p>
               <p>All that can be expected therefore in ſuch a work, if its ending is propoſed to afford the moſt complete ſcene of felicity of which human life is capable, muſt be to leave the principal characters happy, and the reſt with fair proſpects of being ſo.</p>

               <head>ANSWER to a LETTER from a FRIEND, who had

Lady CLEMENTINA, had his Marriage with her taken Effect, to be

               <p>I HAVE received, my dear friend, ſeveral anonymous Letters written on the ſame ſubject with your favour before me of the 19th; finding fault with Sir Charles Grandiſon for his offered compromiſe with the friends of Clementina, in the article of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; all of them expreſſing, as yours does, a laudable zeal for the intereſts of the Proteſtant cauſe.</p>
               <p>One of the gentlemen deſired an anſwer to what he wrote, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting whither it was to be ſent. I do not think myſelf at liberty to tranſcribe for you his Letter, though an anonymous one, and which would do credit to any writer: But as your Letter and his are in ſubſtance pretty much the ſame, you will allow me to hope for your attention to the extracts I ſhall make from my anſwer to his; and if they are not of ſufficient weight with you to excuſe the Hero in this important article, I ſhall be ready, at your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to re-conſider it.</p>
               <p>This gentleman wiſhes, as you do, that I had gone further into the ſubject: That I had expoſed the iniquity of ſuch compromiſes, and ſhewn, that the ſouls of girls ought to be as much regarded as thoſe of boys; and the rather, as ſuch ſtipulations are now made a point in courſe, in the marriage-treaties of perſons of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent religions. He is ſo good as to call for my opinion on the ſubject. Thus I anſwered.</p>
               <p>Give me leave, Sir, to ſay, I have ſhewn in the work, when the ſubject required it, that I have the honour to be of your opinion as to this compromiſe. I have, in Vol. iii. <hi>Octavo,</hi> p. 105, 106. made the Biſhop (Clementina's Brother) thus ſay to Mr. Grandiſon, after a debate between them on the two religions; <q rend="inline margQuotes">"You will call to mind, Chevalier, that <hi>your</hi> church allows of a poſſibility of ſalvation out of its pale—<hi>Ours</hi> does not."</q>—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"My Lord," anſwers the Chevalier, "our church allows not of its members indulging themſelves in capital errors, againſt conviction."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Grandiſon was a young man: He pretended not to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted of paſſion. It was neceſſary to let the Porretta family, and the Reader, who it was ſuppoſed, would not be unconcerned in the deſtiny of Clementina, ſee, that he was willing to make ſome ſacrifices, for thoſe the family made, in conſideration of ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a creature, who had ſuffered ſo much, and was actually in a
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:0244701300:416"/>
ſtate of ſuffering, for her Love of him. What could he do <hi>more,</hi> he aſks Dr. Bartlett, than to make ſuch an offer? He conſiders it as a very great conceſſion, though he muſt know, that it was, as you, Sir, obſerve, a too uſual one: And he tells her warmeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, the General in particular, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"that he would not have come into ſuch a compromiſe, no, not in favour of a princeſs, in a <hi>beginning</hi> addreſs."</q> And this he ſays in anſwer to the General's queſtion, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"What, Chevalier, muſt the poor daughters have done, that <hi>they</hi> ſhould have been left to perdition?"</q> And this put by that haughty man, when he knew that Mr. Grandiſon was of a religion which inſpires its profeſſors with more charity, than does that which allows not ſalvation out of its own pale; and the ſouls of whoſe daughters therefore, in his opinion, could not be endanger'd merely by ſuch an education.</p>
               <p>Who that thinks the Porretta family bigotted, muſt not have allowed <hi>them</hi> to think Mr. Grandiſon ſo, had he not made ſome ſuch ſort of conceſſion as he expected them to make? Nay, the, actually made a much greater than <hi>be</hi> offered [The SONS of the family]; and beſides, were more apprehenſive of their Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's change of religion, were the marriage to take place, than hopeful of his.</p>
               <p>Some conceſſions are expected to be made in all marriage treaties; and (contrary to what was propoſed in <hi>this</hi>) greater, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, on the man's than on the woman's part; ſince it is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that the wife is more the property of the huſband, than he is hers; and he therefore in marriage makes an acquiſition. Pecuniary ſacrifices could not have affected Mr. Grandiſon: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what touched his principles could. This was a ſevere trial to him. Clementina, at the time, was the only woman he could have loved. He knew not then Miſs Byron: But we have reaſon to believe, from different parts of the ſtory, that he thought himſelf not unhappy, that a marriage, to be entered into on ſuch terms, took not effect; as well as that it was owing to Clementina herſelf, and not to him, that it did not; frequent as ſuch compromiſes are in marriage-treaties between people of different perſuaſions.</p>
               <p>That theſe obſervations lie ſcattered, as I may ſay, in different parts of the ſtory, is owing, a good deal, to the manner of writing, (to the moment, as it may be called) as occaſions aroſe in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the ſtory: A manner of writing that has its conveniencies and inconveniencies. The <hi>latter,</hi> in ſuch caſes as that before us; the <hi>former,</hi> in giving opportunities to deſcribe the agitations that fill the heart, in the progreſs of a material and intereſting ſubject, the event of which remains undecided.</p>
               <p>You will be pleaſed to obſerve, that I had a very nice and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult taſk to manage, to convince nice and delicate Ladies, who, it might be imagined, would ſit in judgment upon the conduct of a man in a Love-caſe (who was preſumed to be nearly perfect, and propoſed as a pattern) that a Lady ſo excellent as Clementina; of
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:0244701300:417"/>
ſo high a family and fortune; all her relations adoring her; ſo deeply in love with him; yet ſo delicate in her whole behaviour to him; was not ſlighted by <hi>him.</hi> What would the Ladies, and the men of gallantry, have ſaid, had he not done all it was poſſible for him to do, to obtain ſo rich a prize?</p>
               <p>Allow me to ſay, that if his diſtreſs, in different ſcenes of the ſtory, were duly attended to (attacked as he was on the ſide of his Generoſity, his Compaſſion, his Gratitude, his Love) together with his ſtedfaſtneſs in his own Religion, I preſume, that, in the whole affair between him and Clementina, he would be rather thought a confeſſor for it, than a lukewarm man in it. Be pleaſed to reperuſe what he ſays to Miſs Byron on this ſubject, in the library at Colnebrook, <hi>Vol.</hi> iii. <hi>Octavo, p.</hi> 29, 30. <hi>Vol.</hi> iii. <hi>p.</hi> 189, 190. <hi>Duodecimo.</hi>

                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">'What muſt be my grief, to be obliged to diſappoint ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations as were raiſed by perſons who had ſo ſincere a value for me! You cannot, madam, imagine my diſtreſs: So little as could be expected to be allowed by them to the principles of a man whom they ſuppoſed to be in an error that would inevitably caſt him into perdition! But when the friendly Brother implored my compliance; when the excellent Mother, in effect, beſought me to have pity on <hi>her</hi> heart, and on her <hi>child</hi>'s head; and when the tender, the amiable Clementina, putting <hi>herſelf</hi> out of the queſtion, urged me, for my ſoul's ſake, to embrace the doctrines of her holy mother the church—What, madam—But how I grieve you!'</q>

But I <hi>laboured,</hi> I <hi>ſtudied,</hi> for a compromiſe. I muſt have been unjuſt to Clementina's merit, and to my own character, had ſhe not been dear to me. And indeed I beheld graces in her <hi>then,</hi> that I had before reſolved to ſhut my eyes againſt; her Rank next to princely; her Fortune high as her rank; Religion; Country; all ſo many obſtacles that had appeared to me inſuperable, removed by <hi>themſelves;</hi> and no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion left of a breach of the laws of hoſpitality, which had, till now, made me ſtruggle to behold one of the moſt amiable and noble-minded of women with indifference.'</q>—Then he relates his offer of compromiſe.</p>
               <p>And let me add here that noble apoſtrophe of his, when he had been contemplating the perfections of Clementina, the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs of her family, and their great offers to him—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"But, O my Religion, and my Country!

               </p>
               <p>Nor are theſe the ſtrongeſt inſtances that he gives of his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to his Religion and Country in the courſe of the work; to ſay nothing of what might be ſuppoſed to paſs between him and the Biſhop, in their debate on the two Religions; in which he convinced the Prelate (who from that time forbore to attack him on that ſubject) that he had a great deal to ſay in behalf of his own.</p>
               <p>In an omiſſion in the Sixth Volume, Octavo, which is ſupplied p. 401, 402. Lucy Selby is made thus to expreſs herſelf, with regard to this compromiſe, in order to weaken the danger to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion that might be apprehended from the example—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"How could Sir Charles, ſo thorough an Engliſhman, have been happy with an Italian wife? His heart indeed is generouſly open and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent to people of all countries. He is, in the nobleſt ſenſe, a Citizen of the World: But ſee we not, that his long reſidence abroad has only the <hi>more</hi> endeared to him the Religion, the Government, the Manners, of England?"—</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">"How was this noble-minded man, proceeds ſhe, entangled by delicacies of ſituation, by friendſhip, by compaſſion, that he ſhould ever have been likely to be engaged in a family of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholics, and lived half of his days out of his beloved country; and the other half to have ſet, as to the world's eye, ſuch an example in it?"</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I know, adds Miſs Selby, he would have made it his ſtudy to prevent any miſchief to his neighbours from the active zeal of his Lady's confeſſor, had a certain compromiſe taken effect. I remember the hint he gave to Father Mareſcotti<note n="a" place="bottom">Vol. iv. p. 122. Octave—Vol. v. p. 93. Duodecimo.</note>: But would even that good man have thought himſelf bound to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve faith with heretics in ſuch a caſe?"</q>
               </p>
               <p>And in the Concluding Note to the work, I have further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to obviate the apprehended miſchief, by declining to <hi>contend</hi> with ſuch of my Readers, whoſe laudable zeal led them to conſider this compromiſe as a fault.</p>
               <p>Thus, my dear Friend, you will ſee, that, however uſual it may be for people of different Religions, when they intermarry, to enter into compromiſes of this kind, they are not countenanced by the <hi>judgment</hi> of Sir Charles Grandiſon; who conſidered, as the greateſt misfortune that could have befallen him, the ſituation he was in; which in a manner <hi>compelled</hi> him to make ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions, in compaſſion to an excellent woman, who laboured under a diſorder of mind on his account.</p>
               <p>After all, if this conceſſion of Sir Charles is to be deemed a blemiſh, it is rather a blemiſh in his conduct than in his character. Very few in <hi>his</hi> circumſtances would have done better; few ſo well: And what he offered, in ſo <hi>peculiar</hi> a ſituation, is by no means a precedent to be pleaded in <hi>common</hi> caſes.</p>
