            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>ELL, <hi>Cloris,</hi> this is a mad Frolick. I am horridly frighted at the Thoughts of throwing my ſelf into the Power of a young Fellow.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Clo.</speaker>
                     <p>It is natural to us to be frighted at firſt: I was in a little Terror my ſelf on my Wedding-Day, but it went all off before the next Morning; a Husband, like other Bugbears, loſes all his Horror when we once know him thoroughly.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Clo.</speaker>
                     <p>Then you muſt not prove a good Wife—If he keeps a Miſtreſs, do you keep a Gallant; if he
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1241800700:8"/>
ſtay out with his Friends at a Tavern, do you be merry with your Friends at home.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Hil.</speaker>
                     <p>You give fine Advice indeed.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Clo.</speaker>
                     <p>Upon my Word, Madam, it was ſuch as I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed my ſelf. I had a Rogue of a Husband that robbed me of all I had, and kept a Miſtreſs under my Noſe: but I was even with him: for it hath been ever my Opinion that a Husband, like a Courtier, who is above doing the Duties of his Office, ſhould keep a Deputy.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Hil.</speaker>
                     <p>But ſuppoſe you had been in Love with your Husband?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Clo.</speaker>
                     <p>Why ſo I was, Madam, as long as he deſerved it: but Love, like Fire, naturally goes out when it hath nothing to feed on.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Hil.</speaker>
                     <p>Well, if it be poſſible to be aſſured of a Lover's Sincerity, I think I may be aſſured of <hi>Conſtant:</hi> at leaſt it is adviſeable to perſuade my ſelf of his Truth whom I ſhould Love, tho' he wanted it:—Ah, <hi>Cloris!</hi> you may as eaſily remove a Rock as a Woman's Paſſion—</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Clo.</speaker>
                     <p>And yet it is very often built on a ſandy Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Hil.</speaker>
                     <p>Love is the ſame, whatever be its Object: We as often like Men for imaginary as real Perfections; we all look through a Priſmatick Glaſs in Love, and whatever Beauties we have once fancied, we never loſe the Opinion of—our Amorous Faith is as implicit as our Religious.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Clo.</speaker>
                     <p>If I have any Judgment in Mankind, and I am ſure I have had ſome Experince in them, your Paſſion could have been no where better fixed: Capt. <hi>Conſtant</hi> hath all the Qualities any Woman can deſire.

                     <p>It is indeed a tickliſh Point, and it were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſable to make it up as ſoon as poſſible. The firſt Loſs is always the leaſt.

In ſhort, it were better to give a brace of hundred Pounds to to make up the Matter now, than to venture the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.

                     <p>Depend on it, He is the Occaſion of your Loſs. I can grant you a Warrant againſt him, if you know his Name, tho' I fear you are too late.</p>

                     <speaker>Pol.</speaker>
                     <p>No, Sir, I am not too late; my Daughter is an Heireſs, and you know the Puniſhment for ſtealing an Heireſs. If I could hang the Raſcal, it would be ſome Satisfaction.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Wor.</speaker>
                     <p>That will be impoſſible, without her Conſent; and truly, if ſhe be married, I would adviſe you to follow the Example of that Emperor, who when he diſcovered ſomething worſe than a Marriage, between one of his Subjects and his Daughter, choſe rather to let him enjoy her as his own, than puniſh him.</p>

Yes, and the ſame News<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>papers a hundred times in the ſame Words.

                     <p>Now thou knoweſt that there are very wholeſome Laws againſt Cuckoldom; the Advantage of a Man's Horns is, that he may ſhove his Wife out of Doors with them.</p>

                     <p>But there muſt be a Diſcovery firſt. It is not enough that a Man knows himſelf to be a Cuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>old, the World muſt know it too. He that will keep his Horns in his Pocket, muſt keep his Wife in his Boſom. Therefore, <hi>Quill,</hi> as it is in your Power to obſerve my Wife, I aſſure you a very handſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward on her Conviction; for I begin to find, that if I do not diſcover her, ſhe will ſhortly diſcover me, or ruin me by bribing her to hold her Tongue. It is not a little Gold will make a Gag for a Woman.</p>

                     <p>Why, at my firſt Return to <hi>England,</hi> the Proſpect of War was in every one's Eye, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Reports of the People, but the Augmentation of the Troops aſſured us of its Approach; upon which, I reſolved to embarque my ſmall Remains of Fortune in the Service of my Country, and obtained the ſame Commiſſion on that Occaſion, which I had enjoyed in the <hi>Indies.</hi> My Hiſtory is not very full of Adventures; I continued therein 'till the Reduction, when I ſhared the Fate of ſeveral unhappy brave Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, and was ſent a begging with a red Coat on my Back.</p>

                     <p>It is the Faculty of the Cloth to be ragged.—Red is as apt to be ragged, as White to be ſoil'd. It is commonly the Fate of our brave Soldiers to bring home ragged Cloaths, as well as Colours, and both are rewarded by <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi>—the one is hung up in it, and the other is locked up ſafe by an Order from it; for, Heaven be prais'd! the Goals are always open Hoſpitals for us.</p>

                     <p>The only Happineſs which hath attended me ſince my Return, is my having contracted an Intimacy with that young Lady whom you ſaw here; which hath proceeded ſo far, that laſt Night we had appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to meet in order to our Marriage; but as I was juſt arrived at the Place, a Woman well-dreſs'd was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked in the Street by a Ruſſian; I immediately fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her Aſſiſtance, the Fellow quitted her, and left me alone in the Poſſeſſion of the Watch, who early this Morning carried me before Juſtice <hi>Squeezum,</hi> and by him I was committed hither.</p>

                     <p>No; they ſaid ſhe was ill of ſome Bruiſes ſhe had received, but deſired I might be kept in Cuſtody 'till the Afternoon, at which Time ſhe would appear againſt me. But by what <hi>Hilaret</hi> hath told us, and by ſome Methods which have been uſed to extort Money from me, I am inclined to fancy it all a contrived Piece of Villany of the Juſtice, and not of the Woman's, as I at firſt imagined.</p>

                     <p>I know not yet whether I have or no. I left an old Father here, and a rich one.

                     <p>It is their Drugs that debauch our Wine: Wine in it ſelf is as innocent as Water, and Phyſick poiſons both. It is not the Juice of the Grape, but of the Drug, that is pernicious. Let me adviſe you, Madam, leave off your damn'd adulterated Water, your Tea, and take to Wine. It will paint your Face better than Vermilion, and put more Honeſty in your Heart than all the Sermons you can read. I'll introduce you to ſome Clubs of my Acquaintance, a ſet of honeſt Fellows that live in the Clouds of Tobacco, and know no Home but a Tavern.</p>

Come, here's your Health, in Hopes of your Amendment; thou ſhalt pledge thy own Health in a Bumper—Here, Boy, bring up a Gallon of Wine.</p>

                     <p>SURE, never Child inherited leſs of a Father's Diſpoſition than mine; her Mother certainly played me foul in the begetting her: I, who have been my whole Life noted for Sobriety, could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have given Being to ſo wild a Creature: I begin to recollect having ſeen a tall Half-pay Officer at my Houſe formerly: Nor do I think the Girl unlike him. I am ſure ſhe hath been ever wild enough, to have had any Officer in the Kingdom for her Father. Nature hath been kind to the Male of all Creatures but Man: The Bull, the Horſe, the Dog are not encumbered even with their own Off-ſpring; that Care falls only to the Females: But Man, when once a gabling Prieſt hath chattered a few miſchievous Words over him, is bound to have and to hold from that Day forward all the Brats his Wife is pleaſed to beſtow on him. Yet I muſt own the Girl hath been ever dutiful to me, till ſhe became acquainted with this curſed Fellow in a Red Coat. Why ſhould Red have ſuch Charms in the Eyes of a Woman? The <hi>Roman</hi> Senate kept their Armies abroad to prevent their ſharing in their Lands at home, we ſhould do the ſame to prevent their ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in our Wives. A tall luſty Fellow ſhall make more work for a Midwife in one Winter at home, than he can for a Surgeon in ten Summers abroad.</p>
