            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE little Thing which you take ſo kindly, is but
a very ſmall Part of what I owe you; and
whatever my Studies, or (to uſe a properer Word)
Idleneſs, are capable of producing, ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
you in mere Gratitude for the Pleaſure I have
received from your own Writings: In which give me
Leave to ſay, your good Will to me in particular, is
as diſtinguiſhable, as the Obligation you lay on the
Publick in general. I am very happy in the Envy and
ſilly Attacks of ſuch People, as have awakened the
Generoſity of ſo powerful a Defender. Nor am I
aſhamed of thoſe Weakneſſes of mine, which they have
expoſed in Print (the greateſt of which was my
thinking too candidly of them, to whom I wrote my
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0191300500:3"/>
Letters with ſo much unguarded Friendlineſs, and
Freedom), ſince you have found a Way to turn thoſe
Weakneſſes into Virtue, by your partial Regard of
them. The Eye of Candour, like the Sun, makes
all the Beauties which it ſees; it gives Colour and
Brightneſs to the meaneſt Objects purely by looking
on them. I agree with you, that there is a Pleaſure
in ſeeing the Nature and Temper of Men in the
plaineſt Undreſs; but few Men are of Conſequence
enough to deſerve, or reward, that Curioſity. I
ſhall indeed (and ſo will all Mankind) be highly
pleaſed to ſee the Great Czar of <hi>Muſcovy</hi> in this Light,
drawn by himſelf, like an antient Maſter, in rough
Strokes, without heightening, or ſhadowing: What
a Satisfaction to behold that perfect Likeneſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Art, Affectation, or even the Gloſs of Colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
with a noble Neglect of all that Finiſhing and
Smoothing, which any other Hand would have been
obliged to beſtow on ſo principal a Figure? I write
this to a Man whoſe Judgment I am certain of, and
therefore am as certain you will give the World this
great Depoſitum, juſt as you have received it: There
will be no Danger of your dreſſing this <hi>Mars</hi> too
finely, whoſe Armour is not Gold, but Adamant,
and whoſe Stile in all Probability is much more ſtrong,
than it is poliſh'd. I congratulate you, that this great
Treaſure is fallen into your Hands; and I congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
all <hi>Europe,</hi> that it is to be delivered to them.
through the Hands of one, who will think it Sacrilege
to touch upon, much leſs to alter, any great Lines of
ſuch an Original.</p>
            <p>I can make you no better Return for your great
Compliment upon me (which it would be Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance
in me to ſhew to any other, and dangerous
even to remember myſelf) but by telling you, that
it is Honour enough to reward all my Studies, to find
my Character and Reputation is Part of the Care of
that Perſon, to whom the Fame and Glory of <hi>Peter
Alexiowitz</hi> was committed.</p>

            <p>I WAS unwilling to anſwer your too obliging Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
(which puts much too great a Streſs upon my
Opinion) till I had read your Play with the Attention
it deſerves; I mean, not once, but ſeveral times
over. In a Word, to comply with my Judgment
will coſt you no Trouble, except to your Modeſty;
which is, <hi>to act it as ſoon as poſſible.</hi> Nothing but
Trifles have I to object, and which were ſuch as did
not once ſtop me at the firſt Reading; the Spirit,
Deſign, and Characters, carrying me on, without
Stop, Check, or even Intermiſſion. You certainly
are Maſter of the Art of the Stage, in the manner of
forming and conducting the Deſign, which I think
impoſſible to be mended; of that Great Part, and of
the other, the raiſing the Paſſions, I will ſay nothing
to you, who know them ſo much better than my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
I would only point out a few Particularities in
Thought or Expreſſion, as material as excepting to a
Button on your Coat, or a looſe Hair. Two or three
Lines I have with great Timorouſneſs written on one
of your blank Leaves, in Black Lead, half afraid to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0191300500:5"/>
be legible, and not without ſome Hope that before
you ſee them, they may be vaniſhed: So may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
my Objections, every one of them. Shall I ſee
you ſoon, to tell you theſe Nothings? Whenever I
ſhall ſee you, I hope to find, we can employ the
Time better, than I, in telling, or you, in hearing
them. Or muſt I return you the Play now? Your
Orders will be obey'd as ſoon as you give them.—I
really rejoice at your Lady's Recovery: I would have
her and you think, the Air of <hi>Richmond</hi> is particularly
good to re-eſtabliſh her. Pray let Miſs <hi>Hill</hi> know,
I am ready to believe all the good Things her own
Father can ſee in her: I can ſafely truſt both his

            <p>I MADE a ſtrong Eſſay to have told you in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
how very kindly I took your two laſt Letters.
The only Hours I had in my Power from a neceſſary
Care that brought me back immediately, I would
have impoſed on you. It will pleaſe you to know
the poor Woman is rather better, tho' it may be but
like the Improvement of a Light on the End of a

Your Opinion alſo of my giving ſome publick Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

            <p>I am afraid of tiring you, and (what is your beſt

tell you, that many Circumſtances you have heard, as
Reſemblances to the Picture of <hi>Timon,</hi> are utterly
Inventions of Lyars; the Number of Servants never
was an Hundred, the Paintings not of <hi>Venio</hi> or <hi>La

Manner of Reception at the Study, Terras, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all
which, and many more, they have not ſcrupled to
forge, to gain ſome Credit to the Application: And
(which is worſe) belyed Teſtimonies of Noblemen,

Calumniators: The one I forgive, the other I pity,

            <p>SINCE I am fully ſatisfy'd we are each of us
ſincerely and affectionately Servants to the other,
I deſire we may be no further miſ-led by the Warmth
of writing on this Subject. If you think I have
ſhewn too much <hi>Weakneſs,</hi> or if I think you have
ſhewn too much <hi>Warmth,</hi> let us forgive one another's
Temper. I told you I thought my Letter a filly one;
but the more I thought ſo, the more in ſending it I
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0191300500:7"/>
ſhew'd my Truſt in your good Diſpoſition toward me.
I am ſorry you took it to have an Air of <hi>Neglect,</hi> or
<hi>Superiority:</hi> Becauſe I know in my Heart, I had not
the leaſt Thought of being any way ſuperior to Mr.
<hi>Hill</hi>; and, far from the leaſt Deſign to ſhew Neglect
to a Gentleman who was ſhewing me Civility, I meant
in Return to ſhew him a better Thing, Sincerity;
which I'm ſorry ſhould be ſo ill expreſs'd as to ſeem
Rudeneſs. I meant but to complain as frankly as you,
that all Complaints on both Sides might be out, and at
a Period for ever: I meant by this to have laid a ſurer
Foundation for your Opinion of me for the future,
that it might no more be ſhaken by Miſtakes or
Whiſpers.</p>
            <p>I am ſure, Sir, you have a higher Opinion of my
Poetry than I myſelf. But I am ſo deſirous you
ſhould have a juſt one of me every way, that I wiſh
you underſtood both my Temper in general, and my
Juſtice to you in particular, better than I find my
Letter repreſented them. I wiſh it the more, ſince
you tell me how ill a Picture my Enemies take upon
'em to give, of the Mind of a Man they are utter
Strangers to. However, you will obſerve, that much
<hi>Spleen</hi> and <hi>Emotion</hi> are a little inconſiſtent with <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect,</hi>
and an Opinion of <hi>Superiority.</hi> Towards Them,
God knows, I never felt any Emotions, but what bad
Writers raiſe in all Men, thoſe gentle ones of Laughter
or Pity: That I was ſo open, concern'd, and ſerious,
with reſpect to you only, is ſure a Proof of Regard,
not Neglect. For in Truth, nothing ever vex'd me,
till I ſaw your Epigram againſt Dr. S. and me come
out in their Papers: And this, indeed, did vex me, to
ſee <hi>One Swan among the Geeſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Letters <hi>A. H.</hi> were apply'd to you in the
Papers, I did not know (for I ſeldom read them); I
heard it only from Mr. <hi>Savage,</hi> as from yourſelf, and
ſeat my Aſſurances to the contrary. But I don't ſee
how the Annotator on the <hi>D.</hi> could have rectify'd
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0191300500:8"/>
that Miſtake, <hi>publickly,</hi> without particularizing <hi>your
Name,</hi> in a Book where I thought it too good to be
inſerted. No doubt he has apply'd that Paſſage in the
<hi>D.</hi> to you, by the Story he tells; but his Mention of
<hi>Bombaſt, only</hi> in ſome of your <hi>Juvenile Pieces,</hi> I think,
was meant to ſhew, that Paſſage hinted only at that
<hi>allegorical Muddineſs,</hi> and not at any <hi>worſe ſort of
Dirt,</hi> with which ſome other Writers were charged.
I hate to ſay what will not be believ'd: Yet when I
told you, <q rend="inline">"Many aſk'd me to <hi>whom</hi> that Oblique
Praiſe was meant?"</q> I did not tell you I anſwer'd,
it was <hi>you.</hi> Has it eſcap'd your Obſervation, that the
Name is a Syllable too long? Or (if you will have it
a Chriſtian Name) is there any other in the whole
Book? Is there no Author of two Syllables whom it
will better fit, not only as getting out of the allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
Muddineſs, but as having been <hi>dipt in the Dirt
of Party-writing,</hi> and recovering from it betimes? I
know ſuch a Man, who would take it for a Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and ſo would his Patrons too—But I aſk you
not to believe this, except you are vaſtly inclin'd to it.
I will come cloſer to the Point: Would you have the
Note <hi>left out?</hi> It ſhall. Would you have it expreſly
ſaid, <hi>you were not meant?</hi> It ſhall, if I have any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
on the Editors.</p>
            <p>I believe the Note was meant only as a gentle Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke,
and friendlily: I underſtood very well the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veat</hi>
on your Part to be the ſame; and complain'd
(you ſee) of nothing but two or three Lines reflecting
on my <hi>Behaviour</hi> and <hi>Temper to other Writers</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I knew they were not true, and you could not
know they were.</p>
            <p>You cannot in your cool Judgment think it fair to
fix a Man's Character on a Point, of which you do
not give one Inſtance? Name but the Man, or Men,
to whom I have unjuſtly omitted Approbation or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement,
and I'll be ready to do them Juſtice. I
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0191300500:9"/>
think I have <hi>publickly</hi> prais'd all the beſt Writers of my
Time, except yourſelf, and ſuch as I have had no fair
Opportunity to praiſe. As to the <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Popular,</hi>
I've prais'd but few, and thoſe at the Times when
they were <hi>leaſt popular.</hi> Many of thoſe Writers have
done nothing elſe but flatter'd the Great and Popular,
or been worſe employ'd by 'em in Party-ſtuff. I do
indeed think it <hi>no great Pride</hi> in me, to ſpeak about
<hi>them</hi> with ſome Air of Superiority; and this, Sir, muſt
be the Cauſe (and no other) that made me addreſs <hi>that
Declaration</hi> of my Temper towards <hi>them,</hi> to <hi>you,</hi> who
had accus'd me of the contrary; not, I aſſure you,
from the leaſt Imagination of any Reſemblance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
you and them, either in Merit or Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
            <p>I nam'd Mr. <hi>Dennis,</hi> becauſe you diſtinguiſh him
from the reſt: So do I. But, moreover, he was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt
in my Thoughts, from having endeavour'd
(<hi>before</hi> your Admonition) to promote his Affair, with
Lord <hi>Wilmington,</hi> Lord <hi>Lanſdown,</hi> Lord <hi>Blandford,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Pulteney,</hi> &amp;c. who promis'd me to favour
it. But it would be unjuſt to meaſure my Good-will
by the Effects of it on the Great, many of whom are
the laſt Men in the World who will pay Tributes of
this ſort, from their own un-giving Nature; and many
of whom laugh at me when I ſeriouſly petition for
Mr. <hi>Dennis.</hi> After this, I muſt not name the many
whom I have fruitleſly ſollicited: I hope yet to be
more ſucceſsful. But, Sir, you ſeem too iniquitous
in your Conceptions of me, when you fanſy I call'd
ſuch Things <hi>Services.</hi> I call'd 'em but <hi>humane Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices:</hi>
Services I ſaid I <hi>would</hi> render him, <hi>if I could.</hi>
I <hi>would</hi> aſk a Place for Life for him; and I <hi>have</hi>;
but that is not in my Power: If it was, it would be
a <hi>Service,</hi> and I wiſh it.</p>
            <p>I mention'd the <hi>Poſſibility</hi> of Mr. <hi>D.</hi>'s abuſing
me for forgiving him, becauſe he actually did, in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0191300500:10"/>
Print, lately repreſent my poor, undeſigning, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions
to him, to be the Effect of Fear and Deſire,
to ſtop his Critiques upon me. I wiſh Mr. <hi>Hill</hi> would
(for once) think ſo candidly of me, as to believe me
ſincere in one Declaration, that <q rend="inline">"I deſire no Man
to belye his own Judgment in my Favour."</q>
Therefore, tho' I acknowledge your generous Offer
to give <hi>Examples</hi> of <hi>Imperfections</hi> rather out of your
own Works than mine, in your intended Book; I
conſent, with all my Heart, to your confining them
to <hi>mine</hi>; for two Reaſons: The one, that I fear your
Senſibility that way is greater than my own (by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
you ſeem too concern'd at that Hint given by
the Notes on the <hi>D.</hi> of a little Fault in the Works
of your <hi>Youth</hi> only): The other is a better, namely,
that I intend to amend by your Remarks, and correct
the Faults you find, if they are ſuch as I expect from
Mr. <hi>Hill</hi>'s cool Judgment.</p>
            <p>I am very ſenſible, that my <hi>Poetical</hi> Talent is all
that may (I ſay not, will) make me <hi>remember'd:</hi> But
it is my <hi>Morality</hi> only that muſt make me <hi>Beloved,</hi> or
<hi>Happy:</hi> And if it be any Deviation from <hi>Greatneſs of
Mind,</hi> to prefer Friendſhips to Fame, or the honeſt
Enjoyments of Life to noiſy Praiſes; I fairly confeſs
that Meanneſs. Therefore it is, Sir, that I much
more reſent any Attempt againſt my moral Character
(which I know to be unjuſt) than any to leſſen
my poetical one (which, for all I know, may be very
juſt).</p>
            <p>Pray then, Sir, excuſe my weak Letter, as I do your
warm one. I end as I begun. You gueſs'd right,
that I was ſick when I wrote it: Yours are very well
written, but I have neither Health nor Time to make
mine ſo. I have writ a whole Book of Retractations of
my Writings (which would greatly improve your Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſms
on my Errors), but of my Life and Manners
I do not yet repent one Jott, eſpecially when I find
in my Heart I continue to be, without the leaſt Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony

            <p>EVER ſince I return'd Home, I have been in
almoſt roaring Pain, with a violent Rheumatiſm
in my Shoulder, ſo that all I am able to do is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn

me is proportion'd to the Regard I have for you. I
will not praiſe your Poem further than to ſay, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity
of its Sentiments muſt charm every Man:
Its other Merit you know well. You'll pardon the
few Doubts I ſtart in the Interlinings; they are ſuch
as you can efface as eaſily as they may deſerve. I wiſh

aſk'd me the Queſtion. I remember, Mr. <hi>Lintot</hi>
ſhew'd me a Piece of yours, of which (he ſaid) you
deſir'd my Opinion: I was juſt then in a great Hurry,
going a Journey out of Town upon Buſineſs for a few
Days; and therefore told him I would call for it in a
Day or two, to read carefully: However, I caſt my
Eye on ſome Parts of it, which I lik'd, and told him
ſo. This was all, to the beſt of my Memory, that
paſs'd between us; and you may imagine it was ſome
Surprize to me when I ſaw your Preface a very ſhort
time after. I think it incumbent on any well-mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>IT is a ſerious Pleaſure to me to find you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd,
that I ſhould do your good Senſe and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
the Juſtice it deſerves. It is impoſſible for
me not to think juſt what you would have me on this
Head; the whole <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Meaning</hi> of your Poem
ſhews all little Thoughts to be Strangers to your Soul.
I happen to know many Particulars relating to the
Earl of <hi>Peterborough</hi>'s Conduct, and juſt Glory, in
that Scene you draw ſo well: But no Man ought (I
think) to attempt what you hint at, or can pretend to
do him more Honour than what you yourſelf here
have done, except himſelf: I have long preſs'd him
to put together many Papers lying by him, to that
End. On this late Occaſion he told me you had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
endeavour'd the ſame, and it comes into my
Mind, that, on many of thoſe Papers, I've ſeen an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorſement
<hi>A. H.</hi> which I fanſy might be thoſe you
overlook'd. My Lord ſpoke of you with great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
and told me how narrowly you both miſs'd of
going together on an adventurous Expedition<note n="*" place="bottom">On an Expedition to the <hi>Weſt Indies.</hi>
               </note>. The
real Reaſon I carry'd him your Poem was, that I
imagin'd you would never ſend it him, of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
and that I was truly pleas'd with it.</p>
            <p>I am troubled to reflect, how unequal a Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent
I am to you, partly thro' want of Health (for
I have ſince had a Fever), partly thro' want of Spirits,
and want of Solitude; for the laſt Thing we Poets
care to own, is the other Want; that of Abilities.</p>
            <p>But I am ſenſibly pleas'd with your Letter, not
only with that which ſeem'd to prompt it, but with
the Things ſaid in it: And I thank you for both—Believe me deſirous to ſee you: When, and where,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0191300500:15"/>
you ſhall determine; tho' I wiſh it were here:
You'll ſee a Place ſeeming more fit for me than it is;
looking Poetical, yet too much in the World; Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic,

all Avenues to it ſometimes, and I know no better

Gueſt's and my own Concern to have no Hopes of
ſeeing you; as well as, what is unfeignedly a yet
greater Concern, our Sorrow at what you expreſs to
be the Occaſion of it. He wiſhes, now, for Power,
for no other Reaſon, than to be able to elevate Merit
above that Fortune it commonly finds, from Power.
And I can truly add, for my own Part, who never
taſted Power, that I never felt any Uneaſineſs in a
low Fortune, but that which it cauſes when I find it
cannot prove the Regard and Love I bear to true
Worth in any afflictive Circumſtance.</p>
            <p>Excuſe my pretending to ſay a Word on that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
all I meant to ſay (but the Overflowings of my
Heart vented thus much) was, to beg you to think
too favourably of us both, to imagine we ſhould not
be unhappy as much as diſſatisfy'd, if we did not read
once or twice more your Tragedy, after what you
tell us of your having alter'd it on our Suggeſtions.
We have a conſcientious Fear, that you may have
comply'd too implicitly with thoſe <hi>Marks,</hi> rather of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0191300500:16"/>
our ſcrupulous Sincerity, than of any certain Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;

admire, tho' we may fear; or ſometimes heighten'd
what may be natural, tho' we might think it low.
Pray eaſe us, by favouring us with a ſecond View

            <p>And whenever you ſend me that Eſſay, you may

ſince your great Loſs, till I hop'd you had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
ſome Alleviation to it, from the only Hand
which can give any, that of Time. Not to have
mention'd it, however faſhionable it may be, I think
unnatural, and in ſome Senſe inhuman; and I fear
the contrary Cuſtom is too much an Excuſe, in
reality, for that Indifference we too uſually have for
the Concern of another: In truth, that was not my
Caſe: I know the Reaſon of one Man is of little
Effect toward the Reſignation of another; and when
I compar'd the Forces of yours and mine, I doubted
not which had the Advantage, even tho' in your own
Concern. 'Tis hard, that in theſe tender Afflictions
the Greatneſs of the Mind and the Goodneſs are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite

Conſideration upon what Conditions we receive all
the Goods of this Life, operate towards our Quiet;
even the beſt of our Paſſions (which are the ſame

to the Pleaſure I've often (from the very
firſt Time I ſaw you at Dr. <hi>Young</hi>'s) propos'd in our
Acquaintance. I really ſtay'd that Night in Town,
upon <hi>Bowry</hi>'s Notice, which he left in Writing, that
you ſhould <hi>be at Home all</hi> Wedneſday, and had dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
three Hours to you, or, more properly, to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with you. I aſk'd, particularly, for Miſs <hi>Urania</hi>;
but thought myſelf, tho' old enough, not familiar
enough, to aſk to ſee her. I deſire your firſt Notice,
if you come this Way; or, rather, I wiſh you would
take up your Lodging with me. In the mean time,
pray ſend the Tragedy of <hi>Athelwold</hi> (for ſo I would
call it), under Cover, to the Counteſs of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Monday,</hi> at her Lodgings in <hi>St. James</hi>'s. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd

that the K. ſhould ſee it in Manuſcript, I

it no Credit; 'tis only doing ſome to thoſe who may

needed Addition; ſure every Incident is well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd:

            <p>I Thank you for your Tragedy, which I have now
read over a ſixth Time, and of which I not only
preſerve, but increaſe, my Eſteem. You have been
kind to this Age, in not telling the next, in your Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,
the ill Taſte of the Town, of which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0191300500:28"/>
you deſcribe it to have given of your Play
(worſe, indeed, than I had heard, or could have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd),
is a more flagrant Inſtance than any of thoſe
Trifles mention'd in my Epiſtle; which yet, I hear,
the ſore Vanity of our Pretenders to Taſte flinches at
extremely—The Title you mention had been a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perer
to that Epiſtle—I have heard no Criticiſms about
it, nor do I liſten after 'em; <hi>Nos haec novimus eſſe
nihil</hi> (I mean, I think the Verſes to be ſo): But as
you are a Man of tender Sentiments of Honour, I
know it will grieve you to hear another undeſervedly
charg'd with a Crime his Heart is free from: For, if
there be Truth in the World, I declare to you, I
never imagin'd the leaſt Application of what I ſaid of
<hi>Timon</hi> could be made to the D. of <hi>Ch<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

there is ſcarce a more blameleſs, worthy and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
beneficent Character, among all our Nobility:
And if I have not loſt my Senſes, the Town has loſt
'em, by what I heard ſo late, as but two Days ago,
of the Uproar on this Head. I am certain, if you
calmly read every Particular of that Deſcription,
you'll find almoſt all of 'em point-blank the Reverſe
of that Perſon's <hi>Villa.</hi> It's an aukward Thing for a
Man to print, in Defence of his own Work, againſt
a Chimaera: You know not who, or what, you fight
againſt: The Objections ſtart up in a new Shape,
like the Armies and Phantoms of Magicians, and no
Weapon can cut a Miſt, or a Shadow. Yet it would
have been a Pleaſure to me, to have found ſome
Friend ſaying a Word in my Juſtification, againſt a
moſt malicious Falſhood. I ſpeak of ſuch, as have
known by their own Experience, theſe twenty Years,
that I always took up their Defence, when any
Stream of Calumny ran upon 'em. If it gives the
Duke one Moment's Uneaſineſs, I ſhould think my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ill paid, if the whole Earth admir'd the Poetry;
and believe me, would rather never have written a
Verſe in my Life, than that any one of 'em ſhould
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0191300500:29"/>
trouble a truly good Man. It was once my Caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
but happily reconcil'd; and among generous
Minds nothing ſo endears Friends, as the having of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
one another.</p>
            <p>I lament the Malice of the Age, that ſtudies to ſee
its own Likeneſs in every thing; I lament the Dulneſs
of it, that cannot ſee an Excellence: The firſt is my
Unhappineſs, the ſecond yours. I look upon the
Fate of your Piece, like that of a great Treaſure,
which is bury'd as ſoon as brought to Light; but it is
ſure to be dug up the next Age, and enrich Poſterity.</p>
            <p>I have been very ſenſible, on theſe two Occaſions,
to feel them (as I have done) at a Time, when I daily
fear'd the Loſs of (what is, and ought to be dearer
to me than any Reputation, <hi>but that of a Friend,</hi> or
than any thing of my own, <hi>except my Morals</hi>) the
Loſs of a moſt tender Parent—She is alive, and that

            <p>YOUR very kind Letter came hither in my
Abſence, which occaſion'd my Delay till now
in acknowledging it. Your Partiality to me, both
as a Poet, and as a Man, is great; the former I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve

            <p>I SENT you as honeſt an Anſwer as I could, to
the Letter you favour'd me with; and am ſorry
you imagine any <hi>civil Reproach,</hi> or <hi>latent Meaning,</hi>
where I meant to expreſs myſelf with the utmoſt
Openneſs. I would aſſure you, if you pleaſe, by
my Oath, as well as my Word, that I am in no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
diſpleas'd at any Freedom you can take with me
in a private Letter, or with my Writings in publick.
I again inſiſt, that you alter or ſoften no one Criticiſm
of yours in my Favour; nor deprive yourſelf of the
Liberty, nor the World of the Profit, of your freeſt
Remarks on my Errors.</p>
            <p>In what I ſaid, I gave you a true Picture of my
own Heart, as far as I know it myſelf. It is true, I
have ſhewn a <hi>Scorn</hi> of ſome <hi>Writers</hi>; but it proceeded
from an Experience that they were bad Men, or bad
Friends, or vile Hirelings; in which Caſe, their being
Authors did not make them, to me, either more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable,
or more formidable. As for any other
Pique, my Mind is not ſo ſuſceptible of it as you
have ſeem'd, on each Occaſion, too much inclin'd
(I think) to believe. What may have ſometimes
ſeem'd a <hi>Neglect</hi> of others, was rather a <hi>Lazineſs</hi> to
cultivate or contract new Friends, when I was ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0191300500:32"/>
with thoſe I had; or when I apprehended their
Demands were too high for me to anſwer.</p>
            <p>I thank you for the Confidence you ſhew you have
in me, in telling me what you judge amiſs in my
<hi>Nature.</hi> If it be (as you too partially ſay) my only
Fault, I might ſoon be a perfect Character: For I
would endeavour to correct this Fault in myſelf, and
intreat you to correct all thoſe in my Writings; I
ſee, by the Specimen you generouſly gave me in your
late Letter, you are able to do it; and I would rather
owe (and <hi>own</hi> I owe) that Correction to your Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
than to my own Induſtry.</p>
            <p>For the laſt Paragraph of yours, I ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
ready to convey what you promiſe to ſend
me, to my Lord <hi>B.</hi> I am in Hopes very ſpeedily to
ſee him myſelf, and will, in that Caſe, be the Bearer;

            <p>THE Favour of yours of <hi>May</hi> the 11th, had
not been unacknowledged ſo long, but it
reached me not till my Return from a Journey, which
had carried me from Scene to Scene, <hi>where Gods
might wander with Delight.</hi> I am ſorry yours was
attended with any Thoughts leſs pleaſing, either from
the Conduct towards you of the World in general, or
of any one elſe, in particular. As to the Subject-matter
of the Letter, I found what I have often done
in receiving Letters from thoſe I moſt eſteemed, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0191300500:33"/>
moſt wiſhed to be eſteemed by; a great Pleaſure in
reading it, and a great Inability to anſwer it. I can
only ſay, you oblige me, in ſeeming ſo well to know
me again; as one extremely willing that the free
Exerciſe of Criticiſm ſhould extend over my own
Writings, as well as thoſe of others, whenever the
Public may receive the leaſt Benefit from it; as I
queſtion not they will a great deal, when exerted by
you. I am ſenſible of the Honour you do me, in
propoſing to ſend me your Work before it appears:
If you do, I muſt inſiſt, that no Uſe in my Favour
be made of that Diſtinction, by the Alteration or
ſoftening of any Cenſure of yours on any Line of
mine.</p>
            <p>What you have obſerved in your Letter I think
juſt; only I would acquit myſelf in one Point: I
could not have the leaſt <hi>Pique</hi> to Mr. <hi>Th.</hi> in what is
cited in the Treatiſe of the <hi>Bathos</hi> from the Play
which I never ſuppoſed to be his: He gave it as
<hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s, and I take it to be of that Age: And
indeed the Collection of thoſe, and many more of
the Thoughts cenſured there, was not made by me,
but Dr. <hi>Arbuthnot.</hi>—I have had two or three Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
to lament, that you ſeem to know me much
better as a <hi>Poet,</hi> than as a <hi>Man.</hi> You can hardly
conceive how little either Pique or Contempt I bear
to any Creature, unleſs for immoral or dirty Actions:
Any Mortal is at full Liberty, unanſwer'd, to
write and print of me as a Poet, to praiſe me one
Year, and blame me another; only I deſire him to
ſpare my Character as an honeſt Man, over which he
can have no private, much leſs any public, Right,
without ſome perſonal Knowledge of my Heart, or
the Motives of my Conduct: Nor is it a ſufficient
Excuſe, to alledge he was <hi>ſo</hi> or <hi>ſo informed,</hi> which
was the Caſe with thoſe Men.</p>
            <p>I am ſincere in all I ſay to you, and have no Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
in ſaying it. You really over-value me greatly
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0191300500:34"/>
in my Poetical Capacity; and I am ſure your Work
would do me infinitely too much Honour, even if it
blamed me oftener than it commended: For the firſt
you will do with Lenity, the laſt with Exceſs. But
I could be glad to part with ſome Share of any good
Man's Admiration, for ſome of his Affection, and
his Belief that I am not wholly undeſerving to be
thought, what I am to you,</p>

my Suffrage intirely with Lord <hi>B.</hi>'s in general,
after a fourth reading your Tragedy of <hi>Caeſar.</hi> I
think no Characters were ever more nobly ſuſtained
than thoſe of <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Brutus</hi> in particular: You
excel throughout in the Greatneſs of Sentiment;
and I add, that I never met with more ſtriking Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
or lively ſhort Reprizes. There is almoſt
every-where ſuch a Dignity in the Scenes, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of pointing out any one Scene, I can ſcarce
point out any that wants it, in any Degree (except
you would a little raiſe that of the <hi>Plebeians</hi> in the laſt
Act). That Dignity is admirably reconciled with
Softneſs, in the Scenes between <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Calpur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia:</hi>
And all thoſe between <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Brutus</hi> are a
noble Strife between Greatneſs and Humanity. The
Management of the Whole is as artful as it is noble.
Whatever particular Remarks we have made further,
will be rather the Subject of Converſation than a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

            <p>I AM forced to ſay but little to you, tho' my Spirit

My Lord (who has not only reſolved to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

all his Stay in this Kingdom) is at this Time fixed to
this Place too cloſely, by a Fever, which has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined

(tho' many unlucky Strokes of her Influence have

            <p>I HAVE now little to ſay of your Tragedy, which
I return with my Thanks for your Indulgence to
my Opinion, which I ſee ſo abſolutely defer'd to,
that I wiſh I had croſs'd leſs frequently. I cannot
find another Thing I think a Fault in you.</p>
            <p>But my Lord thinks, three Things may yet be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſider'd.
<hi>Brutus,</hi> on Sight of the Warrant ſign'd
for his Death, takes at once the Reſolution of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
<hi>Caeſar,</hi> as none of his Father. Quere, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the Scene that follows between him and <hi>Caeſar,</hi>
all Tenderneſs on the Side of <hi>Brutus,</hi> and all beyond
the Point of Honour that Friendſhip exacted, ſhould
not rather be avoided than heightened?</p>
            <p>Another Quere is, Whether it would not beget
more Indignation in the Audience againſt <hi>Caſſius,</hi> and
more Compaſſion for <hi>Caeſar,</hi> to ſhew that <hi>Caſſius</hi> ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected
<hi>Brutus</hi> to be <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Son, and therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
from <hi>Brutus</hi> the Oath of ſparing neither <hi>Father</hi>;
Relation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third Thing is, Whether the Efforts made by
<hi>Caeſar</hi> to prevent the Civil War, not only by the
equal Offer he made, while the Matter was under
Debate in the Senate (and which the Conſuls <hi>Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulus</hi>
and <hi>Marcellus</hi> refuſed to report to the Senate),
but by the Meſſage he ſent to <hi>Pompey,</hi> when he was at
<hi>Brunduſium,</hi> to deſire a Meeting, to ſettle the Matter,
and avoid the Civil War.—<hi>Vid. Caeſ. Comm. de bell,</hi>
               <hi>Civili, lib.</hi> 1. The Mention of theſe ſomewhere in
the Play might help to remove the Prepoſſeſſion againſt
<hi>Caeſar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After our little Cavils (for ſo we will rather call
minute and verbal Points of Criticiſm) we owe you
the Juſtice to extol highly, what we highly approve,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0191300500:37"/>
and you need not deſire us to ſpeak as we think: 'Tis
what we have (in different Ways) done all our Lives,
where it was to our Prejudice, and cannot but do
here, where it is to our Honour. I only wiſh you a
Stage, Actors, and an Audience worthy of you, and
It.—I have often wiſhed to live to ſee the Day when
Prologues and Epilogues ſhould be no more. I
wiſh a great Genius would break thro' the ſilly,
uſeleſs, Formality. But at leaſt I would have one
try, to leave the Audience <hi>full</hi> of the <hi>Effects</hi> of a
good Tragedy, without an Epilogue. Let me add
another Hint, concerning the Apparatus and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantials
of your Play (ſince I have nothing left more
to wiſh in the Play itſelf); that you would intitle it
barely, <hi>The Tragedy of Caeſar,</hi> and give no Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his being a <hi>Patriot</hi>; for I fear, inſtead of
preparing the Audience, it might revolt them, and
put all the little Criticks upon carping previouſly at
the very Deſign and Character; which would appear
by Degrees, and with the proper Preparations, in
the Piece on the Stage. Another thing was a Thought
of my Lord's, that it ſhould be printed before acting,
a Day or two; for the Sentiments are ſo thick-ſown,
and the Senſe ſo deep ſometimes, that they require
more Attention and Thought than the Hearer may be
apt to give on the firſt Repreſentation. I am not
poſitive, either as to his, or my Thought, but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
them to your Conſideration.</p>
            <p>I have nothing to add, but to lament our Unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
that we cannot ſee you perſonally to confirm
what theſe Letters tell you, of our real Opinion of
your Work, Eſteem of its Author, and Wiſhes for

know the Deference you paid them, and the heroic

in regard to them. I have not yet been able to hear
where they are, or any way to have an Anſwer fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
than I have learn'd it will be impoſſible for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them to bring on their Plays early (a Friend
of theirs telling me they are in no Forwardneſs) till
the Middle or End of the Winter; therefore you
may have room. I wiſh from my Soul you may get
yours firſt, as well acted as it deſerves. A better,
that may eclipſe it, or even worthily follow it, I
hardly expect to ſee.—But upon this Notice, I
believe you may ſafely advance it, the ſooner the
better.</p>
            <p>My Lord <hi>B.</hi> is yet with me, more properly I yet
belong to him, Body as well as Mind (for my Mind
is every-where his). I would to God you had any
Opportunity of ſeeing us before we part; my Houſe
ſhould be yours, as much of it as is not his. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve

all Diligence, if you are not provided with another
Friend in that Caſe. He has heard of ſome Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,

Refuſal or Unwillingneſs to act, and believes he can
employ ſome proper Influence to bring him to a

            <p>I muſt expreſs, on my own Part, a real Regret to

join with Lord <hi>B.</hi> in paying due Praiſes to ſo merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

            <p>I HAVE felt an Uneaſineſs of Mind (occaſioned by
a conſcious Senſe, how unequally I have expreſs'd
my Anger and Contempt, at the Treatment of your
<hi>Caeſar</hi> by the Man of the Stage) ever ſince I laſt
wrote to you; and a hundred Interruptions from Day
to Day (for I have lived in the World, and a buſy
and idle World both, it is) have ever ſince hindered
me from enjoying one Hour of collected Thought.
Yet I am the leſs concerned, ſince, by my Delay, I
can now tell you I have laſt Night ſeen Mr. <hi>Mallet</hi>'s
Play, the fifth Act of which I had not before read,
thro' thoſe Interruptions I have mention'd. It ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
(hitherto at leaſt; for Yeſterday was the firſt
Day) as well as I could expect: But ſo vilely acted
in the Womens Parts and the Mens (except two) that
I wonder it could ſucceed. Mr. <hi>Thomſon,</hi> after many
ſhameful Tricks from the Manager, is determined to
act his Play at the other Theatre, where the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0191300500:41"/>
lies as to the Women, and the Succeſs of <hi>his</hi>
will depend upon them (I heartily wiſh you would
follow his Example, that we might not be deprived
of <hi>Caeſar</hi>). I have yet ſeen but three Acts of Mr.
<hi>Thomſon</hi>'s, but I am told, and believe by what I have
ſeen, that it excels in the Pathetic. The Dignity
of Sentiment, and Grandeur of Character, will ſtill be
<hi>Caeſar</hi>'s, as in his Hiſtory, ſo in your Poetry, ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
to any.</p>
            <p>The Perſon to whom you intended ſo great a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment
as to addreſs that Piece to his Name, is very
ſenſible of your delicate Manner of Thinking: He
bids me aſſure you, his own Knowledge of your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
is ſufficient Pleaſure to him, and deſires you
would not think of doing him either Favour or Juſtice,
till the World knows better how to do itſelf the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
in doing you the latter. He is ſtill detained
here by the Perverſeneſs of his Affairs; and wiſhes,
as I moſt heartily do alſo, that Fortune did not treat
you ſo much alike. The Stage is as ungrateful to
you, as his Country to him: You are both ſure of
Poſterity, and may ſay in the mean time with <hi>Scipio,</hi>

            </opener>
            <p>I AM oblig'd to you for your Compliment, and
can truly ſay, I never gave you juſt Cauſe of
Complaint. You once miſtook on a Bookſeller's
idle Report, and publickly expreſs'd your Miſtake;
yet you miſtook a ſecond time, that two initial Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
only, were meant of you, tho' every Letter in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0191300500:42"/>
the Alphabet was put in the ſame manner: And, in
Truth (except ſome few), thoſe Letters were ſet at
Random to occaſion what they did occaſion, the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion
of bad and jealous Writers, of which Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
I could never reckon Mr. <hi>Hill.</hi> and moſt of whoſe
Names I did not know.</p>
            <p>Upon this Miſtake you were too ready to attack
me, in a Paper of very pretty Verſes, in ſome publick
Journal.—I ſhould imagine the <hi>Dunciad</hi> meant you
a real Compliment, and ſo it has been thought by
many, who have aſk'd, to whom that Paſſage made
that oblique <hi>Panegyrick?</hi> As to the Notes, I am
weary of telling a great Truth, which is, that I am
not Author of 'em; tho' I love Truth ſo well, as
fairly to tell you, Sir, I think even that Note a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation,
and ſhould think myſelf not ill us'd <hi>to
have the ſame Words ſaid of me:</hi> Therefore, believe
me, I never was other than friendly to you, in my
own Mind.</p>
            <p>Have I not much more Reaſon to complain of <hi>The
Caveat?</hi> Where give me Leave, Sir, to tell you,
with the ſame Love of Truth, and with the Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
it inſpir'd (which, I hope, you will ſee, thro'
this whole Letter), I am falſly abus'd, in being repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<q rend="inline">"<hi>ſneakingly to approve, and want the Worth to
cheriſh, or befriend Men of Merit.</hi>"</q> It is, indeed,
Sir, a very great Error: I am ſorry the Author of
that Reflection knew me no better, and happen'd to
be unknown to thoſe who could have better inform'd
him: For I have the Charity to think, he was miſled
only by his Ignorance of me, and the Benevolence to
forgive the worſt Thing that ever (in my Opinion)
was ſaid of me, on that Suppoſition.</p>
            <p>I do faithfully aſſure you, I never was angry at any
Criticiſm, made on my Poetry, by whomſoever: If
I could do Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi> any humane Office, I would,
tho' I were ſure he would abuſe me perſonally To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow;
therefore it is no great Merit in me, to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0191300500:43"/>
find, at my Heart, I am your Servant. I am very
ſorry you ever was of another Opinion.—I ſee, by
many Marks, you diſtinguiſh'd me from my cotem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
Writers: Had we known one another, you
had diſtinguiſh'd me from others, as a <hi>Man,</hi> and no
ill, or ill-natur'd one. I only wiſh you knew, as well
as I do, how much I prefer Qualities of the Heart to
thoſe of the Head: I vow to God, I never thought
any great Matters of my poetical Capacity; I only
thought it a little better, comparatively, than that of
ſome very mean Writers, who are too proud.—But,
I do know <hi>certainly,</hi> my moral Life is <hi>ſuperior</hi> to that
of moſt of the <hi>Wits</hi> of theſe Days. This is a ſilly
Letter, but it will ſhew you my Mind honeſtly, and,

            </opener>
            <p>YOUR Anſwer, regarding no Part of mine, but
the Concluſion, you muſt pardon my Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the Cloſe of yours, in return; if I agree
with you, that your Letter is <hi>weaker,</hi> than one would
have expected.</p>
            <p>You aſſure me, that I did not know you ſo well,
as I might, had I happened to be known to others,
who could have inſtructed my Ignorance; and I begin
to find, indeed, that I was leſs acquainted with you,
than I imagined: But your laſt Letter has enlighten'd
me, and I can never be in Danger of miſtaking you,
for the future.</p>
            <p>Your Enemies have often told me, that your <hi>Spleen</hi>
was, at leaſt, as diſtinguiſhable, as your <hi>Genius:</hi>
And it will be kinder, I think, to believe them, than
impute to Rudeneſs, or ill Manners, the Return you
were pleaſed to make, for the Civility, with which I
addreſſed you.</p>
            <p>I will, therefore, ſuppoſe you to have been <hi>peeviſh,</hi>
or in <hi>Pain,</hi> while you were writing me this Letter:
And, upon that Suppoſition, ſhall endeavour to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive
you.—If I did not love you, as a good <hi>Man,</hi>
while I eſteem you, as a good <hi>Writer,</hi> I ſhould read
you without Reflection: And it were doing too much
Honour to <hi>your</hi> Friends, and too little to my <hi>own
Diſcernment,</hi> to go to <hi>them</hi> for a Character of your
Mind, which I was able enough to extract from your
Writings.</p>
            <p>But, to imitate your Love of Truth, with the
Frankneſs you have taught me, I wiſh the <hi>Great</hi>
Qualities of your Heart were as ſtrong in you as the
<hi>Good</hi> ones: You would then have been above that
Emotion and Bitterneſs, wherewith you remember
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0191300500:45"/>
Things which want Weight to deſerve your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh.</p>
            <p>Since you were not the Writer of the Notes to the
<hi>Dunciad,</hi> it would be impertinent to trouble you
with the Complaint I intended:—I will only obſerve,
that the Author was in the <hi>Right,</hi> to believe me ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of a ſecond <hi>Repentance</hi>; but, I hope, I was
incapable of that ſecond <hi>Sin,</hi> which ſhould have
been previous to his Suppoſition.—If the initial Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<hi>A. H.</hi> were not <hi>meant</hi> to ſtand for my Name,
yet, they were, every-where, read ſo, as you might
have ſeen in <hi>Miſt</hi>'s <hi>Journal,</hi> and other publick Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers;
and I had ſhewn Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> an Example, how
reaſonable I thought it to clear a Miſtake, publickly,
which had been publickly propagated.—One Note,
among ſo many, would have done me this Juſtice:
And the Generoſity of ſuch a Proceeding could have
left no Room, for that offenſive <hi>Sneakingly,</hi> which,
though, perhaps, too harſh a Word, was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereſt
a Man could chuſe, who was ſatirizing an
Approbation, that he had never obſerved warm
enough to declare itſelf to the World, but in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the <hi>Great,</hi> or the <hi>Popular.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, if the Author of the Notes knew, that
<hi>A. H.</hi> related not to me, what Reaſon had he to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude
to that Character, as mine, by obſerving, that
I had publiſhed Pieces bordering upon <hi>Bombaſt</hi>—A Circumſtance ſo independent on any other Purpoſe
of the Note, that I ſhould forget to <hi>whom</hi> I am
writing, if I thought it wanted Explanation.</p>
            <p>As to your oblique Panegyrick, I am not under ſo
blind an Attachment to the <hi>Goddeſs</hi> I was devoted
to in the <hi>Dunciad,</hi> but that I knew it was a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation</hi>;
tho' a dirtier one than I wiſhed for; who
am, neither fond of ſome of the Company, in which
I was liſted—the noble Reward, for which I was to
become a Diver;—the allegoric Muddineſs, in
which I was to try my Skill;—nor the Inſtitutor
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0191300500:46"/>
of the Games, you were ſo kind to allow me a
Share in.</p>
            <p>Since, however, you could ſee, ſo clearly, that I
ought to be ſatisfied with the Praiſe, and forgive the
Dirt it was mixed with, I am ſorry, it ſeemed not
as reaſonable, that you ſhould pardon me for return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your Compliment, with more, and opener, Praiſe,
mixed with leſs of that Dirtineſs, which we have,
both, the good Taſte to complain of.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Caveat,</hi> Sir, was mine.—It would have been
ridiculous to ſuppoſe you ignorant of it: I cannot
think, you need be told, that it meant you no
Harm;—and it had ſcorn'd to appear under the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd
Name, it carries, but that the whimſical Turn
of the Preface, would have made my own a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.—I promiſe you, however, that, for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
I will publiſh nothing, without my Name, that
concerns you, or your Writings. I have, now,
almoſt finiſhed, <hi>An Eſſay on Propriety, and Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety,
in Deſign, Thought, and Expreſſion, illuſtrated,
by Examples, in both Kinds, from the Writings of Mr.
Pope</hi>; and, to convince you how much more Pleaſure
it gives me, to diſtinguiſh your <hi>Lights,</hi> than your
<hi>Shades</hi>;—and that I am as willing as I ought to be,
to ſee, and acknowledge my Faults; I am ready,
with all my Heart, to let it run thus, if it would,
otherwiſe, create the leaſt Pain in you:—<hi>An Eſſay
on Propriety, and Impropriety,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>illuſtrated by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
of the firſt, from the Writings of Mr.</hi> Pope,
<hi>and of the laſt, from thoſe of the Author.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am ſorry to hear you ſay, you never thought any
great Matters of your <hi>Poetry.</hi>—It is, in my Opinion,
the Characteriſtic you are to hope your <hi>Diſtinction</hi>
from: To be <hi>Honeſt</hi> is the Duty of every <hi>plain Man!</hi>
Nor, ſince the <hi>Soul</hi> of Poetry is Sentiment, can a
<hi>Great Poet</hi> want <hi>Morality.</hi> But your <hi>Honeſty</hi> you
poſſeſs in common with a <hi>Million,</hi> who will never be
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0191300500:47"/>
               <hi>remembered</hi>; whereas your <hi>Poetry</hi> is a Peculiar, that
will make it impoſſible, you ſhould be forgotten.</p>
            <p>If you had not been in the <hi>Spleen,</hi> when you
wrote me this Letter, I perſuade myſelf, you would
not, immediately after cenſuring the <hi>Pride</hi> of Writers,
have aſſerted, that you, <hi>certainly, know</hi> your moral
Life, above that of moſt of the Wits of theſe Days:
At any other Time, you would have remembered,
that <hi>Humility</hi> is a moral Virtue. It was a bold De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration;
and the <hi>Certainty</hi> with which you know
it, ſtands in need of a better <hi>Acquaintance</hi> than you
ſeem to have had with the <hi>Tribe</hi>; ſince you tell me,
in the ſame Letter, that many of their <hi>Names</hi> were
<hi>unknown</hi> to you.</p>
            <p>Neither would it appear, to your own Reaſon, at
a cooler Juncture, over-conſiſtent with the Morality
you are ſo ſure of, to ſcatter the Letters of the whole
Alphabet, annexed, at Random, to Characters of a
light and ridiculous Caſt, confuſedly, with Intent to
provoke jealous Writers, into Reſentment, that you
might take Occaſion, from that Reſentment, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
and depreciate their Characters.</p>
            <p>The Services, you tell me, you would do Mr.
<hi>Dennis,</hi> even tho' he ſhould abuſe you, in Return, will,
I hope, give him ſome Title to expect an Exertion
of your recommendatory Influence in his Behalf: A
Man, ſo <hi>popular,</hi> as you, might ſecure him a great
Subſcription: This would merit to be called a
<hi>Service</hi>; and, the more the World ſhould find
you abuſed in the Works you had recommended,
ſo much the more glorious Proof would they ſee,
that your Morals were, in Truth, as ſuperior, as
you repreſent them, to thoſe of your Cotempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
Tho' you will pardon me the <hi>Pride</hi> of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering,
a little, how this Declaration came to be
made to <hi>me,</hi> whoſe Condition not ſtanding in need
of ſuch Services, it was not, I think, ſo neceſſary,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0191300500:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
you ſhould have taken the Trouble to talk of

            <p>Upon the Whole, Sir, I find, I am ſo ſincerely your

               <salute>SIR,</salute> 
            </opener>
            <p>I AM oblig'd to you for your Letter from <hi>Parſons
Green,</hi> and come heartily into the Propoſal, it
begins with: A mutual Reſolution to forget in each
other, the Appearance of every Thing, that has been
diſtaſteful to either, agrees, I am ſure, with the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
I feel for you, at my Heart, where it is
founded on a natural Strength, both of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and
<hi>Inclination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Caveat</hi> began, originally, with the Viſion: I
added not, till after it was finiſh'd, thoſe Lines,
among which are the unlucky Ones, that diſpleas'd
you. I was ſcarful, leſt, without ſomething of that
kind, by way of Introduction, the Reader might
think himſelf puſh'd, too abruptly, into the Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory:
But, I confeſs, it was unreaſonable in me to
cover your <hi>Praiſe,</hi> which I delighted in, under the
Veil of an Allegory; and explain my <hi>Cenſure,</hi> too
openly, in which I could take no Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>The Truth is, I lov'd you ſo well, and thought
of you ſo often, that it was not eaſy for me, in any
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0191300500:49"/>
Humour, to write Verſe, and not dwell upon you.—Have you never been <hi>jealous</hi> of a favourite <hi>Miſtreſs?</hi>—Have you never, under a <hi>Pique,</hi> at her ſuppos'd
<hi>Neglect,</hi> ſaid, what ſhe could no more deſerve, than
you could think ſhe did, upon cooler Reflection?—And have you not found, after all, that you was
never the leſs her <hi>Lover?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Offer is very kind, to prevail on the Editor
of the <hi>Dunciad,</hi> to leave out the Note, or declare,
that I was not meant in it; But I am ſatisfied:—It is over;—and deſerves no more of your Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>I agree with you, It is <hi>Morality</hi> makes us belov'd:
I know it, from the Effect of your Writings; where
I <hi>but admire</hi> the Harmony, and the Elegance, while
I <hi>love</hi> the Generoſity, and the Candor of the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
I prefer too, as you do, <hi>Friendſhips,</hi> and
the honeſt Enjoyments of Life, to <hi>Fame,</hi> and noiſy
<hi>Praiſes</hi>; but I am glad you are happier, than you wiſh
to be, who enjoy both Benefits, together.</p>
            <p>Yet, if there was nothing deſirable in <hi>Fame,</hi> there
could be nothing deteſtable in <hi>Slander</hi>; and your
honeſt Uneaſineſs, at being <hi>thought</hi> worſe than you
<hi>are,</hi> would, in that Caſe, be in Danger of paſſing for
a <hi>Weakneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know, however, that you conſider <hi>Praiſe</hi> in a
nobler Light than <hi>Vanity.</hi>—There is, in Fame, the
Promulgation of a good Man's Example, which his
natural Life being too ſhort to extend ſo far as he
wiſhes, <hi>That</hi> Defect is ſupplied by the ſecond Life,
he receives, from his <hi>Memory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have ſeen, and been aſham'd of that low Turn,
which Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi> gave, to your Good-nature.—Where a Man's <hi>Paſſions</hi> are too ſtrong for his <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,</hi>
his <hi>Suſpicion</hi> will be too hard for his <hi>Prudence:</hi>
He has often been weak enough to treat you in a
Manner that moves too much Indignation againſt
Himſelf, not to leave it unneceſſary for you, alſo, to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0191300500:50"/>
puniſh him.—Neither of us would chuſe him for a
<hi>Friend</hi>; but none of the <hi>Frailties</hi> of his <hi>Temper,</hi> any
more than the heavy <hi>Formalities</hi> of his <hi>Style,</hi> can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
your acknowledging, there is often <hi>Weight,</hi> in
his <hi>Arguments</hi>; and <hi>Matter,</hi> that deſerves Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to be met with, in his <hi>Writings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will ſoon, Sir, convince you, that my Senſibility
is not ſo tender, as you ſuppoſe it to be: I am ſo far
from an Inclination to defend ſome <hi>Pieces,</hi> which I
was too much a Boy, when I publiſh'd, that I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
all Occaſions of expoſing 'em, myſelf, to the
Contempt they have merited.</p>
            <p>I am already too much oblig'd, not to bluſh at your
Mention of the <hi>Odyſſey,</hi> with a View of ſending it to
my Daughter; and <hi>She</hi> is too inquifitive a Lover of
what gives her <hi>Inſtruction</hi> with <hi>Delight,</hi> to have been
ſatisfied without finding, in her Cloſet, whatever ſhe
had heard <hi>you</hi> had publiſh'd.</p>
            <p>As a Proof, how determin'd I am, to throw no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
upon the World, that may give you Cauſe of
Complaint, I will ſend you, in Manuſcript, the <hi>Eſſay
on Propriety,</hi> as ſoon as it is finiſh'd: I do the ſame,
now, by a ſmaller Piece, I am about to publiſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
you will find yourſelf concern'd in ſome Part of
it.—I am, Sir, with great Truth,</p>

            <head>LETTER XXXIV. From Mr. HILL, To Mr. POPE.</head>

               <salute>SIR,</salute> 
            </opener>
            <p>THE Pleaſure, I was ſure to receive with your
Letter, brought an unexpected Chagrin in its
Company, from a Vein of civil Reproach, that runs
thro' it; which I can better diſcern, than account
for; ſince I muſt not ſuſpect, without wronging my
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0191300500:51"/>
Ideas of your Equity, that you could be diſpleas'd at
the Freedom I took in my Sentiments. If I believ'd
they had given you the ſmalleſt Offence, I would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
commit my Eſſay, in its preſent rough State, to
the Flames, than tranſcribe it, either for yourſelf, or
the Publick.</p>
            <p>Indeed it was with a kind of foreboding Reluctance
that I cenſur'd any Paſſage of <hi>yours</hi>; and to confeſs
the Truth, frankly, I had only one Reaſon for doing
it. After I had convinc'd myſelf, thoroughly, that
<hi>Propriety,</hi> in ſome of the Lights I was conſidering it
under, had been univerſally neglected, in Poetry, I
foreſaw, it would be impoſſible to eſtabliſh the Belief
of a Fact ſo unlikely, without citing the ſtrongeſt
<hi>Examples:</hi>—To do this, from the Works of our
<hi>dead</hi> Authors only, carry'd the Face of a <hi>Meanneſs,</hi>
I could not tell how to ſubmit to.—To draw formal
Citations from any Pieces that had appear'd of my
own (tho' full enough, God knows, of Abſurdities,
to have furniſh'd more Proofs than I wanted), would
have look'd too aſſuming, and ſilly:—To borrow ſuch
Inſtances out of other, leſs faulty, Cotemporaries, not
however reputed among the ſparkling great Lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries
of Wit, would have induc'd a miſtaken Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
that, in the Works of more maſterly Writers,
there were no ſuch <hi>Examples</hi> to be met with.—And
now,—Is there a good Judge in <hi>England</hi> (except one)
who will not ſee, and acknowledge, the Neceſſity
that threw me, unavoidably, upon <hi>your</hi> Writings?</p>
            <p>However, I am glad, at my Heart, it was Dr.
<hi>A<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>_…</desc>
                  </gap>t</hi> who made that Collection you mention; for
I am almoſt unwilling to be found in the <hi>Right,</hi> when
I diſapprove what <hi>your</hi> Name has been ſtamp'd on;
yet your own honeſt Argument (that it is not enough
to excuſe a Reporter of Falſhoods, that he was told,
and believ'd, what he publiſh'd) muſt defend me
againſt its Advancer: For neither is it a ſufficient
Excuſe, that a <hi>Writer,</hi> whoſe Name, in the Front of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0191300500:52"/>
a Book, has given Weight to the Cenſures it propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates,
was not <hi>Author</hi> of ſome of thoſe Cenſures;
ſince whatever a Man ſets his <hi>Hand</hi> to, he ought, firſt,
to examine the <hi>Truth</hi> of.</p>
            <p>I am charm'd, while I hear you diſclaim that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity
to <hi>Pique</hi> and <hi>Contempt,</hi> which, to ſpeak with
the Soul of a Friend, ſeems, to me, the only <hi>Spot</hi> on
your Character.—We are, All of us, in ſome Lights,
or other, the <hi>Dupes</hi> of our natural Frailties: And
when Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> with the Warmth that becomes a
great Mind, tells me how far he is from deſpiſing De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
in Men's <hi>Genius,</hi>—never feeling any Contempt
but for the Dirt of their <hi>Actions</hi>; I am ſure he ſays
nothing but what he firmly believes to be true. And
yet there are Pieces, well known to be <hi>his,</hi> many
Paſſages whereof no Man, leſs appris'd than himſelf
of his Heart's ſecret Views and Intentions, can read,
without being ſtrongly convinc'd of a Scorn, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards
<hi>Genius</hi> only: Tho', if he loves you but half ſo
ſincerely as I do, you have no ſooner diſavow'd the
Deſign, than he concludes, the Imputation was
groundleſs.</p>
            <p>In the mean Time, 'tis Pity that a Thinker, ſo
humane and benevolent, ſhould indulge an Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity,
in the Turn of his Expreſſion, that ſcatters
Gall, which his Heart never licens'd; ſince I believe
it a general Truth, that Men, of the openeſt and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſteſt
Natures, ſooner catch Fire at <hi>Contempt,</hi> than
<hi>Oppreſſion.</hi>—And, as to any <hi>Dirtineſs</hi> in Actions
which take Birth from Effect of ſuch Influence, we
may conclude, from thoſe irreſiſtible little Sallies of
<hi>Fury,</hi> whereby, even among undeſigning and innocent
Infants, we ſee <hi>Brother</hi> precipitated into Outrage
againſt <hi>Brother,</hi> immediately upon any cold Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of <hi>Scorn,</hi> that there is nothing <hi>immoral</hi> in
what may be done, or declar'd, too offenſively, under
Impreſſions ſo violent, ſo involuntary, and natural.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:0191300500:53"/>
After all this grave Face of Apology, I am an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
Stranger to the <hi>Grounds</hi> upon which thoſe
Men, you refer to, proceeded.—Nay, I am ſo, for
the moſt part, even to the <hi>Meaſures</hi> by which they
provok'd you: All the Reaſon, indeed, that I have
for giving you any of <hi>my</hi> Thoughts on the Subject, is
deriv'd from your own ſtarting into it (a little di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſively)
immediately after hinting ſome Occaſions
you had to lament, that I knew you leſs juſtly, as a
<hi>Man,</hi> than a <hi>Poet.</hi>—I will appeal to impartial Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
whether I do not know you much better, in
both Lights, than ten thouſand of thoſe pretending
<hi>Eſteemers,</hi> of whoſe Affection you think yourſelf
ſurer. It will never be in my <hi>Will,</hi> nor my <hi>Power,</hi>
to tranſmit ſuch a <hi>Picture,</hi> as yours, without its beſt,
and moſt beautiful <hi>Likeneſs:</hi> I ſhall leave to duller
<hi>Dutch</hi> Painters in Criticiſm, their unenvied Delight,
to draw <hi>Monſters.</hi> And know very well, for my own
Part, that I ſhould but <hi>diſgrace</hi> the deſir'd Reputation
of my <hi>Pencil,</hi> if I miſs'd the <hi>Reſemblance,</hi> too widely,
in a Piece which muſt expect to be compar'd with
Originals of the ſame, by many different <hi>Maſters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tho' I acquit you of any further Alluſion to <hi>me,</hi>
than by that retroſpect Glance, <hi>en paſſant,</hi> I have,
<hi>affectionately,</hi> caught the Occaſion of pointing out, to
one of the leaſt intentionally guilty among Men, a
ſeeming <hi>Tartneſs</hi> of Spirit in himſelf, which he will
eaſily <hi>find,</hi> when he looks for; and which, whenever
he does find, and guard againſt, by ſubmitting his
<hi>Wit</hi> to his <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> he will become the moſt <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural</hi>
good Man in the World; for he will leave
himſelf not a <hi>Fault,</hi> to be blam'd for!</p>
            <p>As to myſelf, who was born to mix Sin with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
I plead guilty to all ſuch Indictments as
you, in that Place, <hi>preſent</hi> to my Memory.—I was
always too perceptibly quick, in my Apprehenſion of
<hi>Contempts,</hi> or <hi>Indignities:</hi>—A Temper, which would
have been as <hi>unpardonable,</hi> as I confeſs it to be <hi>weak,</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:0191300500:54"/>
and <hi>ſelf-mortifying</hi>; but that the Fault, tho' of too
ſwelling a Nature, leaves no Voids for Admiſſion of
<hi>Malice.</hi>—It is an offenſive, indeed, but reconcileable
Imbecillity of Mind: <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> felt, and underſtood
it, very finely.<q>
                  <l>" It carries <hi>Anger,</hi> as the Flint does <hi>Fire!</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>" Which, being ſtruck, throws out a haſty <hi>Spark,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>" And then, grows cold again.—"</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Yet I will endeavour to redreſs this wrong Bent in
my Temper, and make Way for the Rectification
you are ſo good as to ſhew me my WANT OF.—And
thus, in the Commerce of <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> as in Traffick,
leſs generous, there is offer'd a mutual Exchange
of Advantages:—Something, always, to <hi>give</hi> and to
<hi>gain:</hi> And this makes <hi>both Sides</hi> more rich, and more
ſatisfy'd.—What a Loſs, then, have unſocial and
vain Diſpoſitions, which, by a ſullen Secluſion from
theſe Rights of Reproof, and Plain-dealing, cut off
all the kind Uſe of Correction!—<hi>Human Nature,</hi> let
it be as ſuſceptible of <hi>Grace</hi> as it can, never yet
wanted <hi>Pride</hi> enough to make Mortifications, of this
Kind, a <hi>Requiſite.</hi> Far from hating our <hi>Friends</hi>
for a little faithful, tho' unwelcome, <hi>Aſperity,</hi> let us
think <hi>him,</hi> of all Men, <hi>unhappieſt,</hi> who has never
been bleſs'd with an <hi>Enemy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, let me aſk you (with a Tranſition very
faſhionably abrupt and uncritical)—How is your
good and great Friend, Lord <hi>B<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>_…</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> to be reach'd?—You will ſcarce think I mean,—to be <hi>emulated!</hi>
Ours is an Age that expoſes ſuch an old-faſhion'd Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litician,
as HE is, to any <hi>Fear,</hi> ſooner than that of a
<hi>Rival.</hi> I have a Packet to ſend him, a little too
large for the <hi>Poſt.</hi> It is a manuſcript Piece, which I
purpoſe to <hi>dedicate</hi> to him, when publiſh'd. But it
would be Prudence, and Decency, as Affairs ſtand at
preſent, to wait his Permiſſion, after reading it: Not
that there is any thing nice, or exceptionable, in the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0191300500:55"/>
Subject; and, I am ſure, I have no need to add, tho'
I ſpeak of a <hi>Dedication,</hi> that mine has no <hi>Views</hi> like
a <hi>modern</hi> one. If you will be ſo kind as to think
how it may reach my Lord's Hands, I ſhall, in a few
Days, ſend it open, to yours; begging you, firſt, to
peruſe, and then give it a Seal, and a Forwarding.
If you will have the Goodneſs to authorize ſuch a
Trouble, pleaſe to do it under a Direction, like your
laſt, to</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute> 
            </opener>
            <p>IT is Time to relieve you from Subjects, and
Lengths, like my laſt; yet you will hardly ſuſpect
ſuch a Blindneſs, in my bad Underſtanding, as to
think, I diſtinguiſh not the true <hi>Caſt</hi> of ſome Colours
which you need not have held quite ſo near me.—Notwithſtanding all which, if I had not more Cauſe to
diſtruſt it, on <hi>your</hi> Side, than my <hi>own,</hi> I ſhould flatter
myſelf, we were born to be <hi>Lovers</hi>; we are ſo often,
and ſo unaccountably, miſtaking one another into <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves,</hi>
and <hi>Reſentments!</hi> Yet I am ſorry, whenever
this happens, becauſe the moſt <hi>loſt</hi> Time, in Mens
Lives, is <hi>that</hi> which they waſte in <hi>Expoſtulation.</hi>
They, who are <hi>Friends,</hi> find it <hi>ſelfiſh,</hi> and <hi>diffident</hi>—and
between <hi>Enemies 'tis inflaming,</hi> and <hi>fruitleſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed there would be no End of ſuch—what muſt
I call 'em?—<hi>Eclairciſſements</hi> is an affected <hi>French</hi>
Word, and I am heartily ſorry I <hi>want</hi> it.—In plain
<hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> I always did, and I ſtill do, moſt
affectionately <hi>eſteem</hi> you, both as <hi>Man,</hi> and as <hi>Poet:</hi>
And if now-and-then, for a Start, I have been put
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0191300500:56"/>
out of Humour with <hi>either,</hi> I would fain have you
think, it was no leſs your <hi>own</hi> Fault, than <hi>mine:</hi> At
leaſt, I am ſure, I believ'd ſo. And if, whenever
you ſuppos'd me to have acted inconſiſtently with my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
on that Principle, you had only been ſo kind, as
to have declar'd <hi>why</hi> you thought ſo, I would openly,
and immediately, either have demonſtrated the <hi>Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take</hi>
to be <hi>yours,</hi> or confeſs'd, and abhorr'd, my <hi>own
Error.</hi>—I will always ſtand <hi>bound</hi> to give, if not a
<hi>rational,</hi> yet a <hi>moral,</hi> Account of my <hi>Actions:</hi> Not
alone, as they regard Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> but <hi>Men,</hi> in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteſt
Situation below him: And whoever (let him
be accus'd, either by Miſapprehenſion or Calumny)
would <hi>decline</hi> ſuch a <hi>Teſt</hi> of his <hi>Conduct</hi> in Life, is ſo
far from being worthy your <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> that he is a
<hi>Stranger</hi> to both <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Honeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here, then, let us <hi>reſt</hi> this Debate; and either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
to let <hi>fall</hi> an unconfiding, and cold Correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
or much rather agree (if you pleaſe) to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
one another <hi>better,</hi> for the future.—As to my
own Part, I never <hi>will</hi>—I never <hi>did</hi>—diſoblige you,
<hi>unprovok'd.</hi> And if, how unkindly ſoever impell'd, I
write or do any thing unbecoming the Occaſion—Think of me, as I would of your Enemies.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, let even the little Trouble, you
have ſo kindly allow'd me to give you, in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clos'd,
be receiv'd as ſome Proof that I know, and
reſpect, at my Heart, your double Claim, both in
<hi>Morals</hi> and <hi>Genius.</hi> For you know <hi>me,</hi> I am ſure,
much leſs juſtly, if you can imagine me capable of
correſponding, with an Air of <hi>Good-will,</hi> where I
wanted a <hi>perſonal Attachment</hi>; or of begging, as I
now very earneſtly do (upon <hi>any</hi> Inducement, but the
high Senſe I have of your <hi>Skill</hi>), your frank and
friendly <hi>Inſpection of the Tragedy.</hi> It would charm
me, to have the Benefit of your Hand, or your Hints,
before it appears on the <hi>Theatre.</hi>

As to my <hi>Eſſay on Propriety,</hi> you have obligingly
convinc'd me, I may lay it before you, without Pain:
Indeed, if I had made it unfit for <hi>your</hi> Eye, the <hi>World</hi>
would have been ſtill leſs likely to ſee it: I ſhall
punctually obey your Command, neither to <hi>omit,</hi> nor
to <hi>ſoften,</hi> in the Tranſcript: It is an Injunction I
may ſafely comply with, ſince, if I have any thing to
value myſelf upon in this Tract, it is from the Proofs,

               <salute>SIR,</salute> 
            </opener>
            <p>HAVING ſeen a Letter you wrote to my
Friend Mr. <hi>Mallet,</hi> on <hi>Saturday</hi> laſt, tho' I
cannot boaſt the Honour and Happineſs of your Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
and ought with the utmoſt Deference
and Veneration to approach ſo ſupreme a Genius;
yet my full Heart is not to be repreſs'd by Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities;
and you muſt allow me the Pleaſure of pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth my beſt Acknowledgments.</p>
            <p>I will not affect a moderate Joy at your Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,
your Praiſe: It pleaſes, it delights, it raviſhes
me! Forgive me for the Lowneſs of the Truth,
when I vow, I'd rather have it than the Acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Thouſands: 'Tis ſo ſincere, ſo delicate, ſo
diſtinguiſhing, ſo glowing, and, what peculiarly marks
and endears it, ſo beautifully generous.</p>
            <p>That great Mind, and tranſcendent Humanity,
that appear in the Teſtimony you have been pleas'd
to give my firſt Attempt, would have utterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
me, if I had not been prepar'd for ſuch an
Entertainment, by your well-known Character;
which the Voice of Fame, and your own maſterly
Writings, loudly proclaim.</p>
            <p>It would both be diſingenuous, and rudely unjuſt,
in me, after what you have obſerv'd, to diſſemble my
Satisfaction at ſeveral Paſſages in the Poem: This let
me ſay, that your Reflections have enter'd into the
very Soul of my Purpoſe, and, even to myſelf, caſt a
Light over the Whole.</p>
            <p>How rare, how happy, is it to find a Judge whoſe
diſcerning Goodneſs overlooks the Faults of what is
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0191300500:59"/>
well meant, at the ſame Time that his fine enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtic
Taſte improves the Beauties!</p>
            <p>To you, alone, it belongs, to write ſo inimitably,
and to read ſo indulgently.</p>
            <p>If I wrote all that my Admiration of your Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
and my Gratitude, dictate, I ſhould never
have done; but, left I tire you, I'll for the preſent
rather put a Violence on myſelf: Only let me che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
one Hope further—of being, ſome time or other,
admitted into the moſt inſtructive and entertaining
Company in the World. I am, with the greateſt
Devotion,</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute> 
            </opener>
            <p>I Receiv'd yours with a Soul awaken'd all to Joy,
Gratitude, and Ambition. There is ſuch a noble
Excellence of Mind, ſo much uncommon Goodneſs,
and Generoſity of Heart, in every thing you ſay, as
at once charms and aſtoniſhes me.</p>
            <p>As you think, imagine, and write, with a diviner
Warmth, ſuperior to the reſt of Mankind; ſo the
very Praiſes, you beſtow, bear the Stamp of Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
and reflect ſtronger on yourſelf.</p>
            <p>While I meditate your encouraging Lines, for a
while, I forget the Selfiſhneſs, Degeneracy, and
Cruelty of Men, and ſeem to be aſſociated with
better and more exalted Beings.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Social Love,</hi> of which you are ſo bright an
Example, tho' it be the diſtinguiſhing Ornament of
Humanity, yet there are ſome ill-natur'd enough to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0191300500:60"/>
degrade it into a Modification of Self-love, according
to them, its Original.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Gentlemen, I am afraid, mingle their
Tempers too much with their Speculations.</p>
            <p>Self-love is, indeed, indiſpenſably neceſſary for the
Well-being of every Individual, but carries not along
with it an Idea of moral Beauty and Perfection;
whereas Social Love is of quite another Nature; the
juſt and free Exerciſe of which, in a particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
renders one amiable, and divine. The accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd
Man I admire, the honeſt Man I truſt; but
'tis only the truly-generous Man I intirely love. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
is the very Smile and Conſummation of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue;
'tis the Image of that fair Perfection, in the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Being, which, while he was infinitely happy
in himſelf, mov'd him to create a World of Beings to
make them ſo.</p>
            <p>The Excellent ones of the Earth, in the Exerciſe
of Social Love, feel it as much to be an original Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe,
as the low World that blind Affection, they
bear themſelves; nor are they, in the leaſt, conſcious
of that forc'd, cold Reaſoning, by which it is deduc'd
from ſo mean an Original.</p>
            <p>How many deathleſs Heroes, Patriots, and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
have been ſo gloriouſly concern'd for the Good
of Mankind, and ſo ſtrongly actuated by Social Love,
as frequently to act in direct Contradiction to that of
Self?</p>
            <p>A great many more Arguments might be adduced
to prove, that Social Love is a nobler, independent
Principle, by itſelf, were not the ſecret Senſe, that
every good Man has of the Matter, inſtead of a
thouſand.</p>
            <p>Your Writings, while they glow with innumerable
Inſtances of ſtrong Thinking, and ſublime Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
are peculiarly mark'd with this beautiful Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence
of Mind; and 'tis that which, at this time,
has awaken'd, in me, theſe Reflections.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute> 
            </opener>
            <p>WHEN I reflect how truly happy I was,
Yeſterday, in your Company, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for me to reſtrain my Senſe of it, from breaking
out into this Acknowledgment.</p>
            <p>There is, in your Converſation, ſuch a Beauty,
Truth, Force, and Elegance of Thought, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion;
ſuch animated, fine Senſe, and chaſtis'd
Fancy; ſo much Dignity and Condeſcenſion, Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
and Sweetneſs; in a Word, ſuch a Variety of
Entertainment and Inſtruction, as is beyond all Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration.</p>
            <p>Your Smiles have all the encouraging Power of
Humanity in them: What one ſays, is receiv'd with
great Taſte, and Indulgence; and to liſten to you,
gives one a ſecret, and more raviſhing Pleaſure, than
to be Author of the beſt Things in other Company.</p>
            <p>There is downright Inſpiration in your Society: It
enlarges and exalts all the Powers of the Soul, chaſes
every low Thought, throws the Paſſions into the moſt
agreeable Agitations, and gives the Heart the moſt
affecting Sentiments—'Tis moral Harmony!</p>
            <p>It gives me an additional Pleaſure, to reflect how
juſtly pleas'd, too, Mr. <hi>Savage</hi> was.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:0191300500:62"/>
Nothing is, to me, a ſtronger Inſtance of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>improvable
Nature of that unhappy Creature of whom
you ſpeak ſo compaſſionately, notwithſtanding of the
barbarous Provocation he has given you, than his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
bleak, and wither'd, under the Influences of
your Converſation—a certain Sign of a Field that the
Lord has curs'd.</p>
            <p>There is none that renders human Nature more
amiable than you; and, at the ſame time, none that
renders the greateſt Part of it more contemptible:
And to deſcend from your Company, and mingle
with the Herd of Mankind, is like <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s
deſcending from a Throne, to graze with the Beaſts of
the Field.</p>
            <p>Now I feaſt on Reflection—and am like a poor
Man, that has brought as much from a rich Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
with him, as muſt ſuſtain him for many Days
afterwards.</p>
            <p>What charms and amuſes me, in a particular
Manner, is, the Account you gave us of that little
Seraph, the young <hi>Urania!</hi> Her elegant Turn of
Mind; her Innocence, and Goodneſs, in the Choice
of her Subjects; her Fancy, Judgment, and Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
above her Years; and the beautiful Struggle of
the laſt ('tis unfair to call it Vanity), occaſion'd by
the rude Stupidity of the <hi>School-Boy,</hi> are moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
ſurpriſing.</p>
            <p>What you, obligingly, obſerv'd of good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany's
being <hi>Arioſto</hi>'s Fountain of Thirſt, is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably

               <salute>Dear Sir,</salute> 
            </opener>
            <p>I HOPE that your uncommon Goodneſs will
forgive me, what I ſcarcely can forgive myſelf,
my not having, hitherto, anſwer'd the laſt encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging
Letter, and Copy of Verſes, you honour'd me
with.</p>
            <p>The Approbation which, out of the Fulneſs of a
beneficent Heart, you are pleas'd to give me, I am
fond and ambitious of, next to that of <hi>Heaven:</hi> 'Tis
my beſt Reward for what I have done, and a noble
Incitement to go on. When <hi>you</hi> approve, my whole
Soul is awak'd, and charm'd.</p>
            <p>Pleaſing is your Praiſe, but ſevere is your Satire:
'Tis particularly mark'd with exalted Sentiment, and
generous Contempt. There is a Force in it, that
ſtrikes thro' the Heart; and a Majeſty, not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd.
In a Word, it is the unaffected Reſentment
of a great Mind.</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible for me, in the Compaſs of this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
to ſay how much I admire every particular Line;
yet 'tis as impoſſible for me to reſtrain myſelf from
dwelling on ſome.
<q>
                  <l>" Smile at your vaniſh'd Hope—convinc'd, too
late,</l>
                  <l>" That Greatneſs dwells not, always, with the
Great."</l>
               </q>
I feel the firſt Line, too ſenſibly; and the laſt finely
inſinuates the Abſurdity of vulgar and hereditary
Greatneſs.</p>
            <p>Your ſinking of the Lord's unlaſting Name in the
Depth of Time, is pleaſingly and nobly juſt: Sir <hi>John
Falſtaff</hi> ſunk not with greater Alacrity, in a literal
Senſe, than they and all their Fopperies do in a meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:0191300500:64"/>
I never read any thing more glorious, than the four
following Lines.
<q>
                  <l>" Patrons are <hi>Nature</hi>'s Nobles, not the <hi>State</hi>'s;</l>
                  <l>" And Wit's a Title, no <hi>Broad Seal</hi> creates.</l>
                  <l>" Kings, from whoſe Bounty Wealth's chief Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
flow,</l>
                  <l>" Are <hi>poor</hi> in Pow'r, when they would <hi>Souls</hi>
beſtow."</l>
               </q>
They are the moſt divine Triumph of Merit, and
Virtue, that was ever writ. The beſt way of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing
all their Beauties is, to read them a thouſand
and a thouſand Times over.</p>
            <p>Your Deſcription of the Court-haunting, Wink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obſerving
Bard, is ſo natural, that, if I am not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken,
it may be found a Picture of ſome living Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals.</p>
            <p>The laſt Paragraph is very ſtrongly and delicately
wrought off; but ſo favourable to me, as obliges me
to ſuppreſs all Sentiments, ſave ſuch as flow from
Gratitude; with which my Heart is as full, as yours
is with Goodneſs and Perfection.</p>
            <p>You have given me <hi>Fame</hi>; and what have I to
return you, but the Acknowledgment of a grateful
Soul?</p>
            <p>How powerfully was I charm'd with the four Acts
of <hi>Elfrid,</hi> you were ſo condeſcendingly good as to
read us! There is in them ſuch a rich Aſſemblage of
all the Excellencies of the beſt Poetry, as is not any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
to be found. I never met, before, with ſuch
a Force, and Dignity of Paſſion. My Heart trembles,
yet, when I reflect. But I will not cramp my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
into the ſmall Space this Letter allows.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Mallet</hi> is now gone into the Country, where
he juſtly expects to be vaſtly entertain'd, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed,

theſe penſive Emotions, parting with ſuch a Friend

            <q>
               <l>Bounteous Creator of the tender Heart!</l>
               <l>Is there no World, where Friends ſhall never part?</l>

            <p>ENcourag'd by that moſt divine of all Virtues,
your charming Goodneſs, I frequently, you ſee,
take the Liberty to addreſs you.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Saturday</hi> laſt I wrote to you, from a Coffee-houſe
in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> but had the Misfortune to hear
you were gone out, only Half an Hour, before the
Letter was ſent.</p>
            <p>Flattering myſelf, then, with ſome Hopes of your
Company, I did not mention a Copy of Verſes I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
on <hi>Friday</hi> laſt, from Mr. <hi>Mallet,</hi> to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix'd
to the Second Edition of <hi>Winter</hi>; and which I
ſend you inclos'd. That you ſhould read them, was
his particular Deſire, in the following Terms:—<q rend="inline">"Offer my Verſes to Mr. <hi>Hill</hi>'s Peruſal, and tell
him, that I will not determine their Fate, till I firſt
learn his Opinion of them: For I know him too
nobly ſincere, to indulge <hi>my</hi> Vanity, at the Expence
of <hi>your</hi> Credit. Say, likewiſe, that I will ſhortly
venture to make uſe of that Permiſſion he ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly
granted me, of writing to him, as often as
my Fear of becoming troubleſome will let me."—</q>
All that I ſhall obſerve concerning them, to ſuch a
finiſh'd Judge as you are, is, that their only glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Fault, if they have any, is, an Exceſs of that
beautiful Benevolence of Mind, which, among a
thouſand other Things, make you and him ſo greatly
amiable.</p>
            <p>I hinted to you in my laſt, that, on <hi>Saturday</hi>
Morning, I was with Sir <hi>Spencer Compton.</hi> A certain
Gentleman, without my Deſire, ſpoke to him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
me; his Anſwer was, that I had never come
near him: Then the Gentleman put the Queſtion, if
he deſir'd that I ſhould wait on him; he return'd, he
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0191300500:67"/>
did: On this, the Gentleman gave me an introductory
Letter to him. He receiv'd me in what they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
call a civil Manner, aſk'd me ſome Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place
Queſtions, and made me a Preſent of Twenty
Guineas. I am very ready to own, that the Preſent
was larger than my Performance deſerv'd; and ſhall
aſcribe it to his Generoſity, or any other Cauſe, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than the Merit of the Addreſs.</p>
            <p>As the Caſe now is, one of your infinite Delicacy
will be the beſt Judge, whether it will be proper to
print theſe two inimitable Copies of Verſes I have
from you, and Mr. <hi>Mallet,</hi> without ſuch little Alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations
as ſhall clear Sir <hi>Spencer</hi> of that beſt Satire I
ever read. I ſhall ſay no more on that Head; for if
there be any Reaſons for ſuch Alterations, you will,
of Neceſſity, at one Glance, ſee them in the ſtrongeſt
and fineſt Light. Only this let me add, ſhould you
find that the Caſe requir'd ſome ſmall Alterations,
and yet not indulge me with them, I ſhall reckon
what my Patron gave me, a fatal Preſent.—'Tis a
Thought too ſhocking to be born—to loſe the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe
of the great Genius of the Age, my Charter of
Fame! for—I will not name it!—But you are too

               <salute>Dear Sir,</salute> 
            </opener>
            <p>I HAVE been, for ſome Days laſt paſt, in the
Country, elſe the inclos'd Sheets, to which you
yourſelf have given the greateſt Sanction and Value,
ſhould have waited on you ere now.</p>
            <p>It was your Approbation that gave me, formerly,
an equally juſt and noble Satisfaction; and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of it is my inviolable Ambition.</p>
            <p>Since I put you to the Trouble of altering your
Verſes, I ought to give you an Account why Mr.
<hi>Mallet</hi>'s were not alter'd, likewiſe.—The Truth is,
he promis'd me to alter them, as I wrote to you;
but, in a following Letter, told me, that, after ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Attempts, he found it abſolutely out of his
Power; and, rather than loſe them, I reſolv'd to
print them, as they at firſt were. To this Reſolution
your laſt favourable Letter, in a great meaſure, rais'd
me: And who, that has a Soul in him, could forbear
to follow the Advice you give me, in thoſe generous
Lines?<q>
                  <l>Heedleſs of Fortune, then look down on State,</l>
                  <l>Balanc'd, within, by Reaſon's conſcious Weight:</l>
                  <l>Divinely proud of independent Will,</l>
                  <l>Prince of your Paſſions, live their Sov'reign ſtill.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I wiſh, that the Declaration, from my Heart, with
regard to you, in the Preface, may not be diſagreeable.
Theſe Sentiments I could not ſuppreſs; and they are
but a faint Expreſſion of the full Eſteem and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
I ſhall ever bear you.</p>
            <p>May I hope that one of the inclos'd Copies of my
Poem can be acceptable to a Lady of Mrs. <hi>Hill</hi>'s fine
Taſte, and the young Darling of the Muſes, <hi>Urania,</hi>

            <p>Shall I languiſh out a whole Summer, in the ſame

Company? Such a Happineſs would much brighten
my Deſcription of that Seaſon; from which, to fill
out this Letter, I venture to tranſcribe the following
Lines.<q>

            <p>MR. <hi>Savage</hi> was ſo kind as to ſhew me a Letter
you lately favour'd him with, by which I had
the true Pleaſure of learning your ſafe Arrival at <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi>
intended Tour, and Halt at <hi>Inverneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is with a Mixture of Joy, Pride, and Confuſion,
I read the favourable. Mention you were pleas'd to
make of me: What unuſual good Fortune has thus
intitled me to your kind Regard? 'Tis nothing, ſure,
but your own generous Goodneſs, which, with your
other many matchleſs Perfections, ſhall ever be my
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0191300500:71"/>
Love, and Wonder, while Truth and Harmony are
the Objects of theſe Paſſions.</p>
            <p>Every Muſe, every Virtue, here, languiſhes for
your Return: To me your Abſence would be much
ſeverer, if my partial Sympathy in the Happineſs of
my native Country did not alleviate the Misfortune.
I congratulate her on the Preſence of ſuch a kind In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirer,
and candid Obſerver: <hi>There,</hi> you may chance
to find, in that neglected Corner of the World, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
Merit, uninform'd Beauty, and good Senſe
cloath'd in the Rags of Language.</p>
            <p>Nothing has appear'd in Print here, ſince your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
unleſs it be ſome muſhroomiſh Pamphlets,
Beings of a Summer's Night! whoſe only Merit is
the violent Propenſion with which they tend into Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion.
Memory abhors them, and their Eſſence is,
to die. I beg Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s Pardon, ſome of whoſe
Letters, to Mr. <hi>Cromwell,</hi> were ſurreptitiouſly printed
by <hi>Curll</hi>; and yet, tho' writ careleſs, and uncorrected,
full of Wit and Gaiety.</p>
            <p>We have got, O rare! a <hi>Roſtrum,</hi> and an Orator,
ſince you left us; an Orator! whoſe pretended great
Deſign is to reſtore primitive Chriſtianity; and his
hopeful Candidates are all the Beaus, and pretty
powder'd Fellows about Town.</p>
            <p>You were, a Week or two ago, traduc'd by the
Praiſes of one of our Journaliſts, who can no more
underſtand the Beauties of your Writings, than you
write to his Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>A new Torrent of <hi>Italian</hi> Farces is lately pour'd

To-morrow, being <hi>Friday</hi> the 21ſt of

            <p>I HAVE been almoſt intirely in the Country, ſince
I had the Honour of yours, and of the inclos'd
Papers, you were ſo good, as to ſend me. The two or
three Days ſince my Return to Town have been ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hurry'd than employ'd in ſolliciting for the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of old <hi>Dennis.</hi> Your well-known and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly-experienc'd
Goodneſs will, I hope, forgive
me for having been ſo ſelfiſh as to keep your Papers ſo
long. Tho' I would have had ſome Objections to
your undertaking the Tranſlation of <hi>Zaire</hi>; now
that it is ſo affectingly done, I ſhould be very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful,
for the great Pleaſure it has given me, to
think of them any more. In reading of <hi>Zara,</hi> I
forget what it was that I objected to <hi>Zaire.</hi> You have
heighten'd it with mere Imagination, but ſuch a
chaſtis'd one, as accords perfectly well with the nobler
Fervency of the Heart. The Sentiments and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections,
too, riſe in the Tranſlation, and glow
ſtronger, as well as the Touches of the poetical Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.
Allow me to ſay, that, in theſe Reſpects, I
deeply feel the Difference betwixt Mr. <hi>Voltaire</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Hill.</hi> The more generous Warmth of your
Heart more animates the Scene, raiſes the dear Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult
in the Breaſt, and moves me much more. I
obſerv'd nothing that I wiſh'd alter'd but a Word
here and there, which are mere Trifles, and not
worth Regard. One, however, I will take the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to mention: It is in a Speech of the firſt Scene,
which marks the Civility and Gallantry of <hi>France</hi>—<q rend="inline">"Where
Men adore <hi>their Wives</hi>"</q>—The two laſt
Words I would change into—<hi>the Fair.</hi>—I imagine
you ſmiling at my important Criticiſm, and ready to
reply—that tho' the preſent <hi>French</hi> are not famous
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0191300500:74"/>
for adoring their Wives, yet thoſe in the good old
unrefin'd Days of St. <hi>Lewis</hi> might. If they do not
now adore their Wives, they perhaps do better, they
make them eaſy.</p>
            <p>I ſhall long to renew the Pleaſure your Play has
given me at its Repreſentation. What Attention I
can contribute to the promoting of that, will greatly
be its own Reward. Mr. <hi>Dodington</hi> is expected, in a
few Days, from <hi>Ireland:</hi> He, I dare ſay, will warmly
favour it, from a double Cauſe—both the Love of the
fine Arts, and his own Pleaſure. Had you but Players
equal to thoſe <hi>Voltaire</hi> had, I would not doubt, in this
Inſtance, the Taſte of our Countrymen—Almighty
Nature is every-where the ſame.</p>
            <p>Soon I propoſe to fix in Town for the Winter,
during which time I hope to paſs ſeveral happy Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in your Company: Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> earneſtly wiſhes

            <p>UPON my Return to Town, from Mr. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dington</hi>'s
Seat in <hi>Dorſetſhire,</hi> where I had for
ſome time been, I found your Letter, about a Month
after its Date: Had it been ſent me in the Country,
I could not have neglected, till now, acknowledging
the Pleaſure it, and the Packet of Prompters you ſent
along with it, gave me. Tho' very happy in the
Company where I then was, yet cannot I help ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
regretting the Loſs of that Entertainment to
which you was ſo good as to give me an Invitation.
With the greateſt Pleaſure would I have beheld, and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0191300500:75"/>
with the greateſt Zeal would I have countenanc'd, to
the utmoſt of my little Power, the Revival of <hi>Action,</hi>
which ſeems on all our Theatres to be now both dead
and rotten. A Friend of mine, who was there, did
not, by what he told me, ſoften my Loſs.</p>
            <p>I was very much enlighten'd and warm'd by the
Prompters upon <hi>Action:</hi> They preſent no leſs a
ſtrong and beautiful Idea of what <hi>Actors</hi> ought to be,
than a mortifying one of what they are. As the
Stage is a powerful School of humane polite Morality,
ſo nothing can contribute more to barbarize the Age
than the preſent Condition of ours. There, human
Nature is repreſented in as aukward, falſe, and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous
a Manner, as the human Form was in antient
<hi>Gothic</hi> Sculpture and Painting. If that were all, it
might be laugh'd at, and contemn'd: But ſince it
tends, at the ſame time, to confound the Head, and
corrupt the Heart; ſince Crouds grow ſtupid, or
barbarous, as they gaze; who can conſider it in that
View, without feeling an honeſt Indignation? And
what crowns the Misfortune is, that there is no Hope
of its ever being otherwiſe: The Root of the Evil
lies too deep to be pluck'd up. Was there ever an
equal Abſurdity heard of, among a civiliz'd People?
That ſuch an important public Diverſion, the School
which forms the Manners of the Age, ſhould be made
the Property of private Perſons; who, did they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
in the firſt Inſtance, by an infinite Chance, to be
Judges of the Matter, yet may transfer that Property
to the moſt profligate, taſteleſs, and ignorant of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind!
But this, alas! is only one of the Pillars of
that vaſt Temple of <hi>Corruption,</hi> under which this Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
more than any other that ever boaſted
Freedom, worſhips the dirty, low-minded, inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable
Idol of Self-intereſt. Even to this Idol is
every public Work, which we have the Soul to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
made an immediate Sacrifice.—You ſee how
much your <hi>Prompters</hi> have inflam'd me; and the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0191300500:76"/>
melancholy Concluſion I draw from all is, that I
never hope to ſee Gentlemen of equal Genius, Taſte,
Judgment, and Generoſity of Heart, to the Author
of theſe Prompters, at the Head of our Theatres. I
may, however, very well live to ſee all Poetry re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to Magazine-Miſcellanies, all Plays to Mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mery
Entertainments, and, in ſhort, all Learning
abſorb'd into the Sink of hireling ſcurrilous News-Papers.
Pardon this Suppoſition in a Letter to one,
who, while he I ves, will never ſuffer it wholly to
take Place: In the mean time, go on to ſtem the

the Honour, your two laſt Letters did me, that has
prevented my thanking you for them before now:
The Truth is, they plung'd me ſo deep into your
Debt, that I was diſpirited, thro' mere Deſpair, of
clearing it. But now I am rather willing to declare
myſelf an irrecoverable Bankrupt, than any longer
neglect to acknowledge the refin'd Pleaſure, which
your generous Approbation of my late Performance
gives me—I call it generous, that Epithet having a

ariſing from their Works; yet I doubt much,
if Bookſellers have any manner of Reliſh for it: I
think, therefore (notwithſtanding that the Ghoſts of
many Authors walk unreveng'd), of annulling the
Bargain I made with mine, who would elſe be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Loſer, by the Paper, Printing, and Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
of <hi>Liberty.</hi> As I ſhall, in this Caſe, be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd
of the intire Property of it again, I propoſe, in
a Year or two hence, to give a new Edition of it;
and beg that you would, ere then, enrich me with
ſome Criticiſms, which I hope I ſhall have the Grace
to reliſh as well as Praiſes.</p>
            <p>Your Obſervation, with regard to political Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
like natural, when come to a Criſis, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
more exalted Scenes of Animation, is fine,
and pleaſes by the future Proſpect it opens; but it
awakens, at the ſame time, a Sentiment no leſs mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying,
ſhould we find our Lot caſt in the Times of
Putrefaction; ſhould we find ourſelves devoted, in
an anti-heroic Manner, for the Good of Poſterity. I
wiſh, heartily, that I could refute what you likewiſe
obſerve with regard to the Cauſe of this Corruption.
Certainly the kind Exchanger of the Super-abundance
for the Sweets and Elegancies of Life, is itſelf cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
and its Gifts abus'd, from the want of Taſte:
For whence is it, ſave the Want of Taſte, that the
continual Tides of Riches, pour'd in upon this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by Commerce, have been loſt again in a Gulph
of ungraceful, inelegant, inglorious Luxury? But
whence, you will ſay, this want of Taſte? Whence
this ſordid Turn to cautious Time-ſerving, Money-making,
ſneaking Prudence, inſtead of regardleſs,
unfetter'd Virtue? To private Jobs, inſtead of public
Works? To profitable, inſtead of fine Arts? To
Gain, inſtead of Glory? In a Word, to the whole
venal Syſtem of modern Adminiſtration? And to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0191300500:78"/>
thoſe groſs periſhing Luxuries, that reconcile, at once,
Avarice and Profuſion, centering all in Self, and even
in the meaneſt, the material Part of Self. This
Diſquiſition, I am afraid, would very near lead me
back again to your Obſervation. It muſt be own'd,
however, that the better Genius of this Nation has
often nobly exerted itſelf, and will ſtruggle hard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it expire. With regard to Arts and Learning,
one may venture to ſay, that they might yet ſtand
their Ground, were they but merely protected. In
lieu of all Patrons that have been, are, or will be, in
<hi>England,</hi> I wiſh we had one good Act of Parliament
for ſecuring to Authors the Property of their own
Works; and that the Stage were put upon the Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of common Senſe and Humanity. And can it
be, that thoſe who impreſs Paper with what conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
the beſt and everlaſting Riches of all civiliz'd
Nations, and of all Ages, ſhould have leſs Property
in the Paper, ſo enrich'd, than thoſe who deal in the
Rags, which make that Paper? Can it be, that the
great, the delightful School of Manners, ſhould be
abandon'd to common Sale, and become the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of any one, who can purchaſe it, to be, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
the School of Folly, and Corruption?—A Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
this, in <hi>Virtue</hi>; which, if not ſo wicked, yet
is as pernicious as that in <hi>Religion.</hi> What would
<hi>Athenians</hi> have ſaid to this! what Laughter, what
Contempt, what Indignation, would it have rais'd
among them!</p>
            <p>Now that I mention the Stage, I muſt ſtill inſiſt
upon my Copy of that only humane new Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
I have ſeen upon it of late. I know not what
<hi>Gothic</hi> Devil poſſeſs'd the Maid at my Lodgings, but
my few Books muſt not be ſo robb'd of the Honour
of boaſting <hi>Zara</hi> among them from its Author.
Having been tantaliz'd lately by ſeeing you at a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
I wiſh you would be ſo good as to make me

great Force, and be too powerful for her Voice:
But I find, 'tis neither long, nor violent; and, as
our Company ſtands, I think, ſhe might undertake it.</p>
            <p>When I told her, you had been pleas'd to name
her for it, ſhe blam'd me for not letting her know it,
that ſhe might have thank'd you for your good Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

               <salute>SIR,</salute> 
            </opener>
            <p>I HAD anſwer'd yours laſt Night, but it came to
my Hands as I was dreſſing, about Half an Hour
before the Play began.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:0191300500:82"/>
I confeſs I am under ſome Difficulty, how to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
for the Failure of ſo good a Play. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
its preſent Reception, I am poſitively,
and abſolutely of Opinion, that after it has ſlept ſome
time, it will appear again upon the Stage, with a
much better Grace, and continue in the Stock in the
firſt Form of Tragedy for ever. My Reaſons for this
are, as follow:</p>
            <p>If you pleaſe to remember, I hinted to you, that
(as the Town has been lately led, and manag'd) there
was a kind of Neceſſity to form and prepare a ſtrong
Body to ſupport even its real Merit in the firſt Run
of it; and I have often thought the beſt Tragedy not
ſupported by this neceſſary, ſcandalous Artifice, would
naturally ſink in five or ſix Days, at moſt: The Fate
of <hi>K. H.</hi> has ſufficiently confirm'd that Opinion.</p>
            <p>However, tho' there is a good deal in what is
above-mention'd, I take the main Cauſe of its Fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure
to proceed from what follows.</p>
            <p>I find by ſome few Perſons, who are highly pleas'd
with that noble Simplicity, and Decency, that runs
quite through the Play, that the Multitude in general
look on it, not as a <hi>new</hi> Play, but as a Play <hi>alter'd</hi>
from <hi>Shakeſpear:</hi> The many Beauties you have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
from him, and ſome noted Speeches, you have
made uſe of with no very material Alterations (which
was certainly well judg'd), have poſſeſs'd the groſs
Imaginations of the Audience, that moſt of the fine
Paſſages of your own, are his too; the two Speeches
of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> at the Council-Table, and
<hi>Harry</hi>'s Reflection, when he firſt hears of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
are univerſally miſtaken for <hi>Shakeſpear:</hi> This I
have found from ſome, whoſe Education, Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
and Acquaintance with <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd,
might have taught 'em better: And yet their
knowing his Manner of Writing ſo well, perhaps,
might the ſooner lead 'em into the Miſtake.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:0191300500:83"/>
Add to this, that ſome Underſtrappers of <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi>
and the Partizans of t'other Houſe, have improv'd
this Notion of its being a Play of <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s not
<hi>very much</hi> alter'd. Now, Sir, allowing what I have
obſerv'd above to be certainly the Game play'd upon
K. <hi>H.</hi> I can no longer wonder, that his Succeſs is
little more, than what a good reviv'd Play commonly
meets with.</p>
            <p>Far be it from me to profane K. <hi>H.</hi> with
odious Compariſons; but give me Leave to obſerve
to you, that <hi>C<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>_…</desc>
                  </gap>r</hi> once brought the <hi>Double Gallant</hi>
upon the Stage, which was made up of Hints ſtolen
from a Play of <hi>Burnaby</hi>'s, and another of <hi>Centlivre</hi>'s,
both heartily damn'd the firſt Night, many Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
as ſoon as the good-natur'd Town found him
out, they reſented his calling it a new Play, and
hounded it in the moſt outrageous Manner. Two
Years after we reviv'd it, it met with moſt extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
Succeſs, and it has continu'd in the Stock ever
ſince, and never fails of a great Audience.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Kind Impoſtor,</hi> tho' taken (I mean the Hints
only) from a Tranſlation of a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Play acted
about Thirty Years ago, was damn'd, at its firſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
only becauſe it was call'd a new Play; but
was reviv'd ſome time after, and met with univerſal
Approbation, like the former, and is generally acted
twice every Year.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>King Lear,</hi> and <hi>Timon of Athens,</hi> met with the
ſame Fate, from the ſame Reaſons, at their firſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance;
but have both prov'd excellent Stock-Plays
upon their being reviv'd.</p>
            <p>Thus, if it can be artfully inſinuated to the Town,
that the Managers, or an Author, would paſs an <hi>alter'd</hi>
Play upon 'em for a <hi>new</hi> one, <hi>That</hi> alone would
make 'em outrageous after three or four Days, and
give the Multitude an Opportunity (which they never
let ſlip) of exerting their proper Qualities. Audiences
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0191300500:84"/>
are never guided by Reaſon, but always by Prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion.</p>
            <p>I believe, when you fairly conſider what I have ſaid
to you, the preſent Diſappointment will give you leſs
Surprize. I aſſure you, the Play was more applauded
the ſecond Night, than the firſt; becauſe it was infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
better acted. As to my own Part, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
I was under for the Succeſs of it, the firſt Night,
threw me into the utmoſt Confuſion. I ſhould be
extremely pleas'd, if you would give yourſelf the
Trouble of ſeeing it acted To-morrow Night. Come
but behind the Scenes, and we will place you in ſome
Corner, where you ſhall be inviſible to the Audience.
Dear Sir, let me prevail upon you to come. I like
your Preface; there is a very decent Scorn, and a
mettled Contempt of the Town, in it. You have
hinder'd me from going to Church this Morning, and
I have tir'd your Patience, to be reveng'd of you.
I am, Sir, with the utmoſt Regard and Sincerity,</p>

            <p>I know you have ſufficient Reaſon not to be pleas'd
with the Taſte of the Town, which is, as it always
was, and as it ever will be.—Mr. <hi>Betterton</hi> obſerv'd
to me many Years ago, that <hi>Don Carlos</hi> ſucceeded
much better than either <hi>Venice Preſerv'd</hi> or the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan,</hi>
and was infinitely more applauded and follow'd
for many Years.—We know what Reception <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe
Loſt</hi> met with in the Author's Life-time.—In
ſhort, <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Athens</hi> were full as partial, or rather
heedleſs, in obſerving the Merit of living Authors, as
<hi>London.</hi>—In the former City, <hi>Fannius</hi> had more
Hearers than <hi>Horace.</hi>—In the latter City, <hi>Euripides,</hi>
ſo juſtly admir'd by all Poſterity, could not ſtand the
Ridicule of <hi>Ariſtophanes,</hi> but choſe to die in volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Baniſhment, to avoid the Flouts of the People;
and we may conclude, that <hi>Sophocles</hi> himſelf eſcap'd
the Burleſque of that Buffoon Comic (for ſuch he
was, notwithſtanding his Merit in other Reſpects),
only becauſe he was a Man of Quality and Fortune.—So that, upon the Whole, I may venture to affirm,
that Poſterity only will do Juſtice to Mr. <hi>Hill,</hi> who
was ever above the low Artifice of forming Cabals to
ſupport his Reputation.—Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi> was ſo ſenſible
of this Truth, that he took <hi>whole Years</hi> to beſpeak
and court Friends, in order to ſecure the Succeſs of
<hi>Cato.</hi>—And is it not thus with Preferments in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
both civil and eccleſiaſtical? Do not the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious
fail, while the induſtrious Levée-Haunter

            <p>FROM the Obſervations you have been pleas'd
to make of the Conduct, Sentiments, and
Diction, of <hi>Eurydice</hi>; permit me to ſay, that, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Exception, I think you the beſt Judge of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic
Performance, in all its Branches, I have ever
known. It were to be wiſh'd, that every Spectator
had your Penetration, and could ſo juſtly diſtinguiſh
the different Paſſions, and the Manner of working
'em.—No Actor, then, could hope for a favourable
Reception, but from his Endeavours, upon all Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
to copy Nature: But, alas! the Taſte, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
is ſo deprav'd, that there is little or no Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe
to be gain'd, in Tragedy, but at the Expence
of <hi>Lungs.</hi> I am, therefore, the leſs concern'd, that
(by the Courſe of Years) I have Reaſon to think my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſo near my <hi>Exit.</hi> I ſhould be proud, however,
of an Opportunity to tell you how much I am,</p>

            <p>I HAVE read your Play with vaſt Pleaſure, and
Mr. <hi>Cibber</hi> highly approves of it; but, if <hi>Athel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wold</hi>
be the Part you deſign for me, I have too much
Reaſon to fear, that 'tis next to impoſſible, at my
Time of Day, to do it common Juſtice; and if I
decline it, from a thorough Conviction of my own
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0191300500:89"/>
Inſufficiency (which is truly the Caſe), I am ſure, I
may depend upon your Juſtice, and Good-nature, to
excuſe me.</p>
            <p>I ſhould be very ſorry, after ſome little Succeſs in
my Buſineſs, to run the Hazard of falling under your
Cenſure, by a very weak Performance of ſo capital a
Part, which requires not only more Youth and Vigour,
than I am Maſter of; but all the Requiſites, that are
neceſſary to form a complete Actor.</p>
            <p>If you will be pleas'd to let me know, in what
Manner you deſign to caſt it, I will order the Parts to
be writ out immediately, that it may be ready for
acting, about the Time you mention. I am,</p>

            <p>IF I ſaid any thing about the Part of <hi>Athelwold,</hi>
that amounted to a Promiſe, it was from the
ſtrong Deſire which I had to appear in a Play, ſo
highly, and ſo deſervedly recommended; but, to <hi>my
greater Mortification,</hi> I find, that the Affair of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy
(at leaſt for any Continuance) is over with me:
I may, perhaps, rub thro' my Parts in Comedy; but
daily Experience teaches me, that it is abſolutely out
of my Power to ſupport the Weight of ſuch a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
as <hi>Athelwold,</hi> during the Run of a new Play,
that, I am perſuaded, muſt make its Way, in ſpite of
Prejudice.</p>
            <p>If any-body ſhould make me the Compliment of
aſking, why I did not appear in the Part of <hi>Athelwold,</hi>
I ſhall deal frankly with him, as I have done with
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0191300500:90"/>
you, and tell him the true Reaſon; and my Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Play will be better juſtify'd, by the
Manner in which I ſpeak of it every where.</p>
            <p>You are ſo obliging to aſk me (in caſe the Play
were to come on without me), Who elſe will be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of ſupporting the Character of <hi>Athelwold?</hi>—Mr. <hi>Mills,</hi> with your Inſtructions, I am ſure, will do
it well; and he muſt be a wretched Actor, indeed,
who is not qualify'd to enter into the Beauties of the
moſt difficult Part, by the Aſſiſtance, which you are
able to give him: And whoever has the Pleaſure of
converſing with Mr. <hi>Hill,</hi> will be fully convinc'd of
this Truth. I am,</p>
