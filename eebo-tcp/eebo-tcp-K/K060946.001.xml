            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SUCH is the Power of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt

By this ſubtil Sophiſtry of
Deſire, I have been perſuaded
to hope, that this Book may,
without Impropriety, be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
to Your Lordſhip; but
am not certain, that my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
will have the ſame Force
upon other Underſtandings.</p>
            <p>The Dread which a Writer
feels of the public Cenſure; the
ſtill greater Dread of Neglect;
and the eager Wiſh for Support
and Protection, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
by the Conſciouſneſs of
Imbecillity; are unknown to
thoſe who have never adventured
into the World; and I am afraid,
my Lord, equally unknown to

the World ready to applaud
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="v" facs="tcp:0005700701:5"/>
'Tis, therefore, not unlikely,
that the Deſign of this Addreſs

of my Fear imputed to
my Vanity: They who ſee Your

compaſſionate my Anxiety.</p>
            <p>But, whatever be ſuppoſed

to whom can Timidity ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Marquis of—for a long Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of Years, was the firſt and moſt
diſtinguiſhed Favourite at Court:
He held the moſt honourable
Employments under the Crown,
diſpoſed of all Places of Profit as he pleaſed,
preſided at the Council, and in a manner
governed the whole Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0005700701:18"/>
This extenſive Authority could not fail of
making him many Enemies: He fell at laſt a
Sacrifice to the Plots they were continually
forming againſt him; and was not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
from all his Employments, but baniſhed
the Court for ever.</p>
               <p>The Pain his undeſerved Diſgrace gave him,
he was enabled to conceal by the natural
Haughtineſs of his Temper; and, behaving
rather like a Man who had reſigned, than been
diſmiſſed from his Poſts, he imagined he
triumphed ſufficiently over the Malice of his
Enemies, while he ſeemed to be wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible
of the Effects it produced. His ſecret
Diſcontent, however, was ſo much augmented
by the Opportunity he now had of obſerving
the Baſeneſs and Ingratitude of Mankind,
which in ſome Degree he experienced every
Day, that he reſolved to quit all Society what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
and devote the reſt of his Life to Solitude
and Privacy. For the Place of his Retreat he
pitched upon a Caſtle he had in a very remote
Province of the Kingdom, in the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of a ſmall Village, and ſeveral Miles diſtant
from any Town. The vaſt Extent of Ground
which ſurrounded this noble Building, he had
cauſed to be laid out in a Manner peculiar to
his Taſte: The moſt laborious Endeavours of
Art had been uſed to make it appear like the
beautiful Product of wild, uncultivated Nature.
But if this Epitome of <hi>Arcadia</hi> could boaſt of
only artleſs and ſimple Beauties, the Inſide of
the Caſtle was adorned with a Magnificence
ſuitable to the Dignity and immenſe Riches of
the Owner.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0005700701:19"/>
While Things were preparing at the Caſtle
for his Reception, the Marquis, though now
advanced in Years, caſt his Eyes on a young
Lady, greatly inferior to himſelf in Quality,
but whoſe Beauty and good Senſe promiſed
him an agreeable Companion. After a very
ſhort Courtſhip, he married her, and in a few
Weeks carried his new Bride into the Country,
from whence he abſolutely reſolved never to
Return.</p>
               <p>The Marquis, following the Plan of Life
he had laid down, divided his Time between
the Company of his Lady, his Library, which
was large and well furniſhed, and his Gardens.
Sometimes he took the Diverſion of Hunting,
but never admitted any Company whatever;
and his Pride and extreme Reſerve rendered
him ſo wholly inacceſſible to the Country
Gentry about him, that none ever preſumed
to ſolicit his Acquaintance.</p>
               <p>In the Second Year of his Retirement, the
Marchioneſs brought him a Daughter, and
died in Three Days after her Delivery. The
Marquis, who had tenderly loved her, was
extremely afflicted at her Death; but Time
having produced its uſual Effects, his great
Fondneſs for the little <hi>Arabella</hi> intirely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed
his Attention, and made up all the
Happineſs of his Life. At Four Years of
Age he took her from under the Direction of
the Nurſes and Women appointed to attend
her, and permitted her to receive no Part of her
Education from another, which he was capable
of giving her himſelf. He taught her to read
and write in a very few Months; and, as ſhe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0005700701:20"/>
grew older, finding in her an uncommon
Quickneſs of Apprehenſion, and an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
capable of great Improvements, he
reſolved to cultivate ſo promiſing a Genius
with the utmoſt Care; and, as he frequently,
in the Rapture of paternal Fondneſs, expreſſed
himſelf, render her Mind as beautiful as her
Perſon was lovely.</p>
               <p>Nature had indeed given her a moſt charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Face, a Shape eaſy and delicate, a ſweet and
inſinuating Voice, and an Air ſo full of Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and Grace, as drew the Admiration of all
that ſaw her. Theſe native Charms were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
with all the Heightenings of Art; her
Dreſs was perfectly magnificent; the beſt
Maſters of Muſic and Dancing were ſent for
from <hi>London</hi> to attend her. She ſoon became
a perfect Miſtreſs of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi>
Languages, under the Care of her Father;
and it is not to be doubted, but ſhe would
have made a great Proficiency in all uſeful
Knowlege, had not her whole Time been
taken up by another Study.</p>
               <p>From her earlieſt Youth ſhe had diſcovered
a Fondneſs for Reading, which extremely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
the Marquis; he permitted her there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Uſe of his Library, in which, unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately
for her, were great Store of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances,
and, what was ſtill more unfortunate,
not in the original <hi>French,</hi> but very bad
Tranſlations.</p>
               <p>The deceaſed Marchioneſs had purchaſed
theſe Books to ſoften a Solitude which ſhe
found very diſagreeable; and, after her Death,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0005700701:21"/>
the Marquis removed them from her Cloſer
into his Library, where <hi>Arabella</hi> found them.</p>
               <p>The ſurpriſing Adventures with which
they were filled, proved a moſt pleaſing Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
to a young Lady, who was wholly
ſecluded from the World; who had no other
Diverſion, but ranging like a Nymph through
Gardens, or, to ſay better, the Woods and
Lawns in which ſhe was incloſed; and who
had no other Converſation but that of a grave
and melancholy Father, or her own Attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants.</p>
               <p>Her Ideas, from the Manner of her Life,
and the Objects around her, had taken a
romantic Turn; and, ſuppoſing Romances
were real Pictures of Life, from them ſhe
drew all her Notions and Expectations. By
them ſhe was taught to believe, that Love was
the ruling Principle of the World; that every
other Paſſion was ſubordinate to this; and
that it cauſed all the Happineſs and Miſeries of
Life. Her Glaſs, which ſhe often conſulted,
always ſhewed her a Form ſo extremely lovely,
that, not finding herſelf engaged in ſuch Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures
as were common to the Heroines in
the Romances ſhe read, ſhe often complained
of the Inſenſibility of Mankind, upon whom
her Charms ſeemed to have ſo little Influence.</p>
               <p>The perfect Retirement ſhe lived in, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded
indeed no Opportunities of making the
Conqueſts ſhe deſired; but ſhe could not
comprehend, how any Solitude could be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
enough to conceal a Beauty like hers
from Notice; and thought the Reputation of
her Charms ſufficient to bring a Croud of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0005700701:22"/>
Adorers to demand her of her Father. Her
Mind being wholly filled with the moſt extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
Expectations, ſhe was alarmed by every
trifling Incident; and kept in a continual An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiety
by a Viciſſitude of Hopes, Fears, Wiſhes,
and Diſappointments.</p>

Years ago.—The Beginning of an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>ARABELLA</hi> had now entered into her
Seventeenth Year with the Regret of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
herſelf the Object of Admiration to a few
Ruſtics only, who happened to ſee her; when,
one <hi>Sunday,</hi> making uſe of the Permiſſion the
Marquis ſometimes allowed her, to attend. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Service at the Church belonging to the
Village near which they lived, her Vanity was
flattered with an Adorer not altogether unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of her Notice.</p>
               <p>This Gentleman was young, gay, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
and very elegantly dreſſed; he was juſt
come from <hi>London</hi> with an Intention to paſs
ſome Weeks with a Friend in that Part of the
Country; and at the time <hi>Arabella</hi> entered
the Church, his Eyes, which had wandered
from one rural Fair to another, were in an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
fixed upon her Face. She bluſhed with
a very becoming Modeſty; and, pleaſed with
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0005700701:23"/>
the unuſual Appearance of ſo fine a Gentleman,
and the particular Notice he took of her, paſſed
on to her Seat thro' a double Row of Country
People, who, with a Profuſion of aukward Bows
and Courteſies, expreſſed their Reſpect.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Hervey,</hi> for that was the Stranger's
Name, was no leſs ſurpriſed at her Beauty,
than the Singularity of her Dreſs; and the odd
Whim of being followed into the Church by
three Women-Attendants, who, as ſoon as ſhe
was ſeated, took their Places behind her.</p>
               <p>Her Dreſs, tho' ſingular, was far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unbecoming. All the Beauties of her Neck
and Shape were ſet off to the greateſt Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
by the Faſhion of her Gown, which, in the
Manner of a Robe, was made to ſit tight to
her Body; and faſtened on the Breaſt with a
Knot of Diamonds. Her fine black Hair, hung
upon her Neck in Curls, which had ſo much
the Appearance of being artleſs, that all but
her Maid, whoſe Employment it was to give
them that Form, imagined they were ſo. Her
Head-dreſs was only a few Knots advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
diſpoſed, over which ſhe wore a white
Sarſenet Hood, ſomewhat in the Form of a
Veil, with which ſhe ſometimes wholly cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her fair Face, when ſhe ſaw herſelf beheld
with too much Attention.</p>
               <p>This Veil had never appeared to her ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
before. Mr. <hi>Hervey</hi>'s eager Glances
threw her into ſo much Confuſion, that, pulling
it over her Face as much as ſhe was able, ſhe
remained inviſible to him all the time they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
ſtayed in the Church. This Action,
by which ſhe would have had him underſtand
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0005700701:24"/>
that ſhe was diſpleaſed at his gazing on her
with ſo little Reſpect, only increaſed his Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity
to know who ſhe was.</p>
               <p>When the Congregation was diſmiſſed, he
haſtened to the Door, with an Intention to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
her his Hand to help her to her Coach; but
ſeeing the magnificent Equipage that waited
for her, and the Number of Servants that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
it, he conceived a much higher Idea of
her Quality than he had at firſt; and, changing
his Deſign, contented himſelf with only bowing
to her as ſhe paſſed; and as ſoon as her Coach
drove away, inquired of ſome Perſons neareſt
him, who ſhe was?</p>
               <p>Theſe Ruſtics, highly delighted with the
Opportunity of talking to the gay <hi>Londoner,</hi>
whom they looked upon as a very extraordinary
Perſon, gave him all the Intelligence they were
able, concerning the Lady he inquired after;
and filled him with an inconceivable Surprize at
the ſtrange Humour of the Marquis, who bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
ſo beautiful a Creature in Obſcurity.</p>
               <p>At his Return home he expreſſed his Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of her in Terms that perſuaded his Friend,
ſhe had made ſome Impreſſion on his Heart;
and, after raillying him a little upon this Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,
he aſſumed a more ſerious Air, and told
him, If he really liked Lady <hi>Bella;</hi> he thought
it not impoſſible but he might obtain her. The
poor Girl, added he, has been kept in Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſo long, that I believe it would not be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
to perſuade her to free herſelf by Marriage.
She never had a Lover in her Life; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the firſt Perſon who addreſſes her has the

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>ARABELLA,</hi> in the mean time, was
wholly taken up with the Adventure, as
ſhe called it, at Church: The Perſon and
Dreſs of the Gentleman who had ſo particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
gazed on her there, was ſo different from
what ſhe had been accuſtomed to ſee, that ſhe
immediately concluded, he was of ſome diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
Rank. It was paſt a Doubt, ſhe
thought, that he was exceſſively in Love with
her; and as ſhe ſoon expected to have ſome
very extraordinary Proofs of his Paſſion, her
Thoughts were wholly employed on the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in which ſhe ſhould receive them.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as ſhe came home, and had paid
her Duty to the Marquis, ſhe hurried to her
Chamber, to be at Liberty to indulge her agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0005700701:26"/>
Reflections; and, after the Example of
her Heroines, when any thing extraordinary
happened to them, called her favourite Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
or, to uſe her own Language, her,
<q>in whom ſhe confided her moſt ſecret
Thoughts.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Well, <hi>Lucy,</hi> ſaid ſhe, did you obſerve that
Stranger who ey'd <hi>us</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">The Heroines always ſpeak of themſelves in the Plural Number.</note> ſo heedfully To-day at
Church?</p>
               <p>This Girl, notwithſtanding her Country-Simplicity,
knew a Compliment was expected
from her on this Occaſion; and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
<q>That ſhe did not wonder at the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's
ſtaring at her; for ſhe was ſure he
had never ſeen any body ſo handſome as her
Ladyſhip before.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I have not all the Beauty you attribute to me,
ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> ſmiling a little: And, with a very
moderate Share of it, I might well fix the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of a Perſon who ſeemed to be not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
pleaſed with the Objects about him:
However, purſued ſhe, aſſuming a more ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Air, if this Stranger be weak enough to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
any Sentiments more than indifferent
for me; I charge you, upon Pain of my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure,
do not be acceſſary to the Conveying
his preſumptuous Thoughts to me either by
Letters or Meſſages; nor ſuffer him to corrupt
your Fidelity with the Preſents he will very
probably offer you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucy,</hi> to whom this Speech firſt gave a Hint
of what ſhe ought to expect from her Lady's
Lovers, finding herſelf of more Importance
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0005700701:27"/>
than ſhe imagined, was ſo pleaſed at the
Proſpect which opened to her, that it was with
ſome Heſitation ſhe promiſed to obey her Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> however, was ſatisfied with her Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances
of obſerving her Directions; and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed
her from her Preſence, not without an
Apprehenſion of being too well obeyed.</p>
               <p>A whole Week being elapſed without meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the Importunities ſhe expected, ſhe
could hardly conceal her Surprize at ſo morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying

<hi>Lucy,</hi> concerning any Attempts the
Stranger had made on her Fidelity; but the
Anſwers ſhe received, only increaſed her Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content,
as they convinced her, her Charms
had not had the Effect ſhe imagined.</p>

Wit, and perſonal Accompliſhments, he did
not fear making ſome Impreſſion on the Heart
of the young Lady; provided he could have an
Opportunity of converſing with her.</p>
               <p>His Couſin's Advice was continually in his
Mind, and flattered his Vanity with the moſt
agreeable Hopes: But the Marquis's Fondneſs
for Solitude, and that Haughtineſs which was
natural to him, rendered him ſo difficult of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
that <hi>Hervey,</hi> from the Intelligence he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of his Humour, deſpaired of being able
to proſecute his Scheme; when, meeting with
a young Farmer in one of his Evening-Walks,
and entering into Converſation with him upon
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0005700701:28"/>
ſeveral Country Subjects, the Diſcourſe at laſt
turned upon the Marquis of—whoſe fine
Houſe and Gardens were within their View;
upon which the young Fellow informed him,
he was Brother to a young Woman that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
the Lady <hi>Arabella;</hi> and, being fond of
lengthening out the Converſation with ſo fine a
Gentleman, gave him, without being deſired,
the domeſtic Hiſtory of the whole Family, as
he had received it from <hi>Lucy,</hi> who was the
Siſter he mentioned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hervey,</hi> exceſſively delighted at this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental
Meeting with a Perſon ſo capable of
ſerving his Defign, affected a great Deſire of
being better acquainted with him; and, under
Pretence of acquiring ſome Knowlege in rural
Affairs, accuſtomed himſelf to call ſo often at
<hi>William</hi>'s Farm, that at laſt he met with the
Perſon whom the Hopes of ſeeing had ſo often
carried him thither.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucy,</hi> the Moment ſhe ſaw him enter, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him again, bluſhed at the Remembrance
of the Diſcourſe which had paſſed between her
Lady and herſelf concerning him; and was not
at all ſurpriſed at the Endeavours he uſed to
ſpeak to her apart: But, as ſoon as he began a
Converſation concerning <hi>Arabella,</hi> ſhe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
him by ſaying, I know, Sir, that you
are <hi>diſtractedly</hi> in Love with my Lady; but ſhe
has forbid me to receive any Letters or Meſſages
from you; and therefore I beg you will not
offer to bribe me; for I dare not diſobey her.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Hervey</hi> was at firſt ſo aſtoniſhed at her
Speech, that he knew not what to think of it;
but, after a little Reflection, attributing to an
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0005700701:29"/>
Exceſs of aukward Cunning what, in Reality,
was an Effect of her Simplicity, he reſolved to
make uſe of the Hint ſhe had given him; and,
preſenting her with a Couple of Guineas, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
her to venture diſpleaſing her Lady, by
bearing a Letter from him; promiſing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
her better, if ſhe ſucceeded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucy</hi> made ſome Difficulty to comply; but,
not being able abſolutely to refuſe the firſt Bribe
that ever was offered to her, ſhe, after ſome
Intreaties, conſented to take the Letter; and,
receiving the Money he preſented her, left him
at Liberty to write, after ſhe had got her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to furniſh him with Materials for that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>HERVEY,</hi> who was Maſter of no great
Elegance in Letter-writing, was at firſt
at ſome Loſs, how to addreſs a Lady of her
Quality, to whom he was an abſolute Stranger,
upon the Subject of Love; but, conceiving
there was no great Occaſion for much Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
in declaring himſelf to one who had been
educated in the Country, and who, he believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
could not be diſpleaſed with a Lover of his
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0005700701:30"/>
Figure, he therefore, in plain Terms, told
her, how <hi>deeply</hi> he was enamoured of her; and
conjured her to afford him ſome Opportunity
of paying his Reſpects to her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucy</hi> received this Letter from him with a
worſe Grace than ſhe did the Gold; and, tho'
ſhe promiſed him to deliver it to her Lady im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,
yet ſhe kept it a Day or two before
ſhe had the Courage to attempt it: At laſt,
drawing it out of her Pocket, with a baſhful
Air, ſhe preſented it to her Lady, telling her it
came from the fine Gentleman whom ſhe ſaw
at Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella</hi> bluſhed at the Sight of the Letter;
and tho', in Reality, ſhe was not diſpleaſed,
yet, being a ſtrict Obſerver of romantic Forms,
ſhe chid her Woman ſeverely for taking it.
Carry it back, added ſhe, to the preſumptuous
Writer of it; and let him know how greatly
his Inſolence has offended me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucy,</hi> however, ſuffered the Letter to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
on the Toilet, expecting ſome Change
in her Lady's Mind; for ſhe traverſed the
Chamber in great ſeeming Irreſolution, often
ſtealing a Glance to the Letter, which ſhe had
a ſtrong Inclination to open; but, ſearching
the Records of her Memory for a Precedent,
and not finding, that any Lady ever opened a
Letter from an unknown Lover, ſhe reiterated
her Commands to <hi>Lucy</hi> to carry it back, with
a Look and Accent ſo very ſevere, that the Girl,
extremely apprehenſive of having offended her,
put the Letter again in her Pocket, reſolving
to return it the firſt Opportunity.</p>

                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0005700701:31"/>
Mr. <hi>Hervey,</hi> who had his Thoughts wholly
taken up with the flattering Proſpect of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
no ſooner ſaw <hi>Lucy,</hi> who gave him his
Letter without ſpeaking a Word, than, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
it had been the Anſwer he expected, he
eagerly ſnatched it out of her Hand, and,
kiſſing it firſt in a Rapture of Joy, broke it
open; but his Surprize and Confuſion, when
he ſaw it was his own Letter returned, was
inexpreſſible. For ſome Moments he kept
his Eyes faſtened upon the tender Billet, as if
he was really reading it. His Diſappointment,
and the ridiculous Figure he knew he muſt
make in the Eyes of his Meſſenger, filled him
with ſo much Confuſion, that he did not dare
to look up; but, recovering himſelf at laſt,
he affected to turn it into a Jeſt; and, laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
firſt himſelf, gave <hi>Lucy</hi> the Liberty of
laughing alſo, who had with much Difficulty
been able to prevent doing it before.</p>
               <p>The Curioſity he felt to hear how ſhe had
acquitted herſelf of the Truſt he had repoſed
in her, made him oblige her to give a Truce
to her Mirth, in order to ſatisfy him; and
<hi>Lucy,</hi> who was extremely exact in her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
told him all that had paſſed, without
omitting the ſmalleſt Circumſtance.</p>
               <p>Though it was impoſſible to draw any
favourable Omen from what he heard, yet he
determined to make another Effort, before he
ſet out for <hi>London;</hi> and, taking Leave of his
Confident, after he had appointed her to meet
him again the next Day, at her Brother's, he
went home to conſider upon Means to effect
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0005700701:32"/>
his Deſigns, which the ill Succeſs of his firſt
Attempt had not forced him to abandon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> who expected to hear, that the
Return of his Letter would make her Lover
commit ſome very extravagant Actions; and
having impatiently waited for an Account of
them from <hi>Lucy;</hi> finding ſhe ſeemed to
have no Intention to begin a Diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
him; aſked her, at laſt, If ſhe had
executed her Commiſſion, and returned the
Letter to the inſolent Unknown?</p>
               <p>The Girl anſwered, Yes.</p>
               <p>Which not being all that her Lady expected,
And how did he receive it? reſumed ſhe,
peeviſhly.</p>
               <p>Why Madam, replied <hi>Lucy,</hi> I believe he
thought your Ladyſhip had ſent him an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer;
for he kiſſed the Letter ſeveral times.</p>
               <p>Fooliſh Wench! replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> How can
you imagine he had the Temerity to think I
ſhould anſwer his Letter? A Favour, which,
though he had ſpent Years in my Service,
would have been infinitely greater than he
could have expected. No, <hi>Lucy,</hi> he kiſſed
the Letter, either becauſe he thought it had been
touched at leaſt by my Hands, or to ſhew the
perfect Submiſſion with which he received my
Commands; and it is not to be doubted, but
his Deſpair will force him to commit ſome
deſperate Outrage againſt himſelf, which I do
not hate him enough to wiſh, though he has
mortally offended me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella</hi> was poſſeſſed of great Senſibility
and Softneſs; and, being really perſuaded, that
her Lover would entertain ſome fatal Deſign,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0005700701:33"/>
ſeemed ſo much affected with the Thoughts of
what might happen, that <hi>Lucy,</hi> who tenderly
loved her, begged her not to be ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
for the Gentleman: There is no Fear,
added ſhe, that he will do himſelf a Miſchief;
for when he diſcovered his Miſtake, he laughed
heartily, as well as myſelf.</p>
               <p>How! replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> extremely ſurpriſed,
Did he laugh?</p>
               <p>Which <hi>Lucy</hi> confirming, Doubtleſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
ſhe, having taken a little Time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
of ſo ſtrange a Phaenomenon, he laughed,
becauſe his Reaſon was diſturbed at the ſudden
Shock he received: Unhappy Man! his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
will be ſeverely enough puniſhed,
though I do not add Anger to the Scorn which
I have expreſſed for him: Therefore, <hi>Lucy,</hi>
you may tell him, if you pleaſe, that, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the Offence he has been guilty
of, I am not cruel enough to wiſh his Death;
and that I command him to live, if he can
live without Hope.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>LUCY</hi> now began to think there was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more, than ſhe imagined, in this
Affair. Mr. <hi>Hervey</hi> indeed, in her Opinion,
had ſeemed to be very far from having any
Deſign to attempt his own Life; but her
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0005700701:34"/>
Lady, ſhe thought, could not poſſibly be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken;
and therefore ſhe reſolved to carry her
Meſſage to him immediately, though it was
then late in the Evening.</p>
               <p>Accordingly ſhe went to her Brother's,
where ſhe had ſome Hope of meeting with
him; but not finding him there, ſhe obliged
him to go to the Houſe where he lived, and tell
him ſhe deſired to ſpeak with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>William,</hi> being let into the Secret of his
Siſter's frequent Meetings with Mr. <hi>Hervey,</hi>
imagined ſhe had ſome agreeable News to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
him with; and therefore ran imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
to his Relation's Houſe, which was but
at a ſmall Diſtance; but he was told Mr.
<hi>Hervey</hi> was in Bed, very much indiſpoſed, and
could not be ſeen.</p>
               <p>This News put <hi>Lucy</hi> in a terrible Fright:
She told her Apprehenſions to her Brother;
which being ſuch as her Lady had put into her
Head, and were now confirmed by Mr. <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey</hi>'s
Illneſs, the young Farmer ſtood amazed,
not being able to comprehend her Meaning;
and ſhe, without ſtaying to explain herſelf any
further, went home to the Caſtle, and told
her Lady, That what ſhe feared was come to
paſs; the Gentleman would certainly die; for
he was very ill in Bed.</p>
               <p>This being no more than what <hi>Arabella</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
ſhe diſcovered no Surprize; but only
aſked <hi>Lucy,</hi> If ſhe had delivered her Meſſage
to him?</p>
               <p>Would you have me, Madam, replied ſhe,
go to his Houſe? I am afraid the Marquis
will hear of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0005700701:35"/>
My Father, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> can never be
offended with me for doing a charitable
Action.</p>
               <p>Ah! Madam, interrupted <hi>Lucy,</hi> let me go
then immediately, for fear the poor Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
ſhould grow worſe.</p>
               <p>If he be ſick almoſt to Death, reſumed <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi>
he will recover, if I command him to do
ſo: When did you hear of a Lover dying
through Deſpair, when his Miſtreſs let him
know it was her Pleaſure he ſhould live? But
as it will not be altogether ſo proper for you to
go to his Houſe, as it may be ſuſpected you
come from me; I'll write a few Lines, which
you ſhall copy, and your Brother may carry
them to him To-morrow, and I'll engage he
ſhall be well in a few Hours.</p>
               <p>Saying this, ſhe went into her Cloſet, and,
having written a ſhort Note, made <hi>Lucy</hi> write
it over again. It was as follows:</p>

               <p>This Letter <hi>Lucy</hi> copied, and <hi>Arabella,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining
it again, thought it rather too kind;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0005700701:36"/>
and, ſeeming deſirous of making ſome Alteration
in it, <hi>Lucy,</hi> who was extremely anxious for Mr.
<hi>Hervey</hi>'s Life, fearing leſt ſhe ſhould alter it
in ſuch a manner, that the Gentleman might
be at Liberty to die, if he choſe it, conjured
her Lady in ſuch preſſing Terms to let it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
as it was, that <hi>Arabella</hi> ſuffered herſelf
to be prevailed upon by her Intreaties; and,
remembring that it was not uncommon for
the Ladies in Romances to relax a little in
their Severity through the Remonſtrances of
their Women, told her, with an inchanting
Smile, that ſhe would grant her Deſire; and
went to Bed with that pleaſing Satisfaction,
which every generous Mind experiences at
the Conſciouſneſs of having done ſome very
benevolent Action.</p>
               <p>In the Morning, this life-reſtoring Billet
was diſpatched by <hi>Lucy</hi> to her Brother, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed
in one to him, charging him to carry it
to the ſick Gentleman immediately.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>William,</hi> having a ſtrong Curioſity to ſee
what his Siſter had written, ventured to open it;
and, not being able to imagine Lady <hi>Bella</hi> had
really given her Orders to write what appeared
to him the moſt unintelligible Stuff in the
World, reſolved to ſuppreſs this Letter till he
had queſtioned her a little concerning it.</p>
               <p>A few Hours after, Mr. <hi>Hervey,</hi> who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
to meet <hi>Lucy</hi> at her Brother's, came in.
His Illneſs having been only a violent Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach,
to which he was ſubject, being now quite
off, he remembred the Appointment he had
made; but, having waited ſome time, and
ſhe not coming, he returned again to his
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0005700701:37"/>
Couſin's, leaving word for her, that he would
ſee her the next Day.</p>
               <p>Scarce was he gone out, when <hi>Lucy,</hi> who
longed to know what Effect her Letter had
produced in his Health, came in; and eagerly
inquiring of her Brother how Mr. <hi>Hervey</hi> was,
received for Anſwer, that he had been there
a Moment before ſhe came.</p>
               <p>Well, cried ſhe, claſping her Hands to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
with Surprize, my Lady ſaid, her Letter
would cure him, if he was ever ſo ſick; but I
did not imagine he would have been well
enough to come abroad ſo ſoon.</p>
               <p>Your Lady! interrupted <hi>William,</hi> why was
it not yourſelf that wrote that Letter you gave

               <p>No, truly, Brother, reſumed ſhe: How
was it poſſible I ſhould write ſo fine a Letter?
My Lady <hi>made</hi> every Word of it, and I only
wrote it after her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>William,</hi> hearing this, would not own the
Indiſcretion he now thought he had been
guilty of, in keeping the Letter; but ſuffered his
Siſter to return to her Lady, in the Belief that
he had delivered it, reſolving, when he ſaw
her next, to ſay he had loſt it; for he knew
not what Excuſe to make to Mr. <hi>Hervey</hi> for
not giving it him when he ſaw him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella</hi> received the Account of her Lover's
Recovery as a Thing ſhe was abſolutely ſure
of before; and thinking ſhe had now done all
that could be expected from her Compaſſion,
reſumed her uſual Severity, and commanded
<hi>Lucy</hi> to mention him no more. If he loves
me with that Purity he ought to do, purſued
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0005700701:38"/>
ſhe, he will ceaſe to importune me any further:
And though his Paſſion be ever ſo violent, his
Reſpect and Submiſſion to my Commands will
oblige him to Silence. The Obedience he
has already ſhewn, in recovering at the firſt
Intimation I gave, that it was my Will he
ſhould do ſo, convinces me, I need not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
he will renew his Follies to diſpleaſe
me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucy,</hi> who found by this Diſcourſe of her
Lady's, that her Commiſſion was at an End
with regard to Mr. <hi>Hervey,</hi> followed her Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
ſo exactly, that ſhe not only ſpoke no
more of him to her, but alſo, in order to avoid
him, neglected to go to her Brother's.</p>
               <p>His Impatience at not ſeeing her made him
prevail upon her Brother to go the Caſtle, and
intreat her to give him another Interview: But
<hi>Lucy</hi> poſitively refuſed; and, to make a Merit
with her Lady of her Obedience, informed
her what he had requeſted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> reſenting a Boldneſs which argued
ſo little Reſpect to her Commands, began
now to repent of the Compaſſion ſhe had
ſhewn him; and, commending <hi>Lucy</hi> for what
ſhe had done, bid her tell the inſolent Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,
if he ever ſent to her again, that ſhe
was reſolved never to pardon the Contempt
he had ſhewn for her Orders.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Hervey,</hi> finding himſelf deſerted by
<hi>Lucy,</hi> reſolved to give over his Attempts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulating
himſelf for his Diſcretion in not
acquainting his Couſin with what he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
done: His Heart not being very much
engaged, he found no great Difficulty in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoling
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0005700701:39"/>
himſelf for his bad Succeſs. In a few
Days he thought of Lady <hi>Bella</hi> no more, than
if he had never ſeen her; but an Accident
bringing her again in his Way, he could not
reſiſt the Inclination he felt to ſpeak to her;
and by that means drew upon himſelf a very
ſenſible Mortification.</p>

                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> upon his coming cloſe to her, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled
her Cries. If you have any Valour,
ſaid ſhe to her Servants, defend your unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Miſtreſs, and reſcue her from this unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Man.</p>
               <p>The Servants, believing him to be a High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayman,
by this Exclamation, and dreading
leſt he ſhould preſent his Piſtol at their Heads,
if they offered to make any Reſiſtance, recoiled
a few Paces back, expecting he would demand
their Purſes when he had robbed their Lady:
But the extreme Surprize he was in, keeping
him motionleſs, the Fellows not ſeeing any
Piſtols in his Hand, and animated by <hi>Arabella</hi>'s
Cries, who, calling them Cowards and Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
urged them to deliver her; they both, in
a Moment, laid hold of Mr. <hi>Hervey,</hi> and forced
him to alight; which they did alſo themſelves,
ſtill keeping faſt hold of him, whom Surprize,
Shame, and Rage, had hitherto kept ſilent.</p>
               <p>Raſcals! cried he, when he was able to
ſpeak, what do you mean by uſing me in this
manner? Do you ſuppoſe I had any Intention
to hurt the Lady?—What do you take me
for?</p>
               <p>For a Villain, for a Raviſher, interrupted
<hi>Arabella,</hi> who, contrary to all Laws both hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
and divine, endeavour to poſſeſs yourſelf
by Force of a Perſon whom your are not worthy
to ſerve; and whoſe Charity and Compaſſion
you have returned with the utmoſt Ingratitude.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0005700701:41"/>
Upon my Word, Madam, ſaid Mr. <hi>Hervey,</hi>
I don't underſtand one Word you ſay: You
either miſtake me for ſome other Perſon, or are
pleaſed to divert yourſelf with the Surprize I am
in: But I beſeech you carry the Jeſt no farther,
and order your Servants to let me go; or, by
Heaven—cried he ſtruggling to get looſe, if I
can but free one of my Hands, I'll ſtab the
Scoundrels before your Face.</p>
               <p>It is not with Threats like theſe, reſumed
<hi>Arabella</hi> with great Calmneſs, that I can be
moved. A little more Submiſſion and Reſpect
would become you better; you are now wholly
in my Power; I may, if I pleaſe, carry you to
my Father, and have you ſeverely puniſhed for
your Attempt: But to ſhew you, that I am as
generous as you are baſe and deſigning, I'll give
you Freedom, provided you promiſe me never
to appear before me again: But, in order to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
my own Safety, you muſt deliver up your
Arms to my Servants, that I may be aſſured you
will not have it in your Power to make a ſecond
Attempt upon my Liberty.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Hervey,</hi> whoſe Aſtoniſhment was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
by every Word ſhe ſpoke, began now to
be apprehenſive, that this might prove a very
ſerious Affair, ſince ſhe ſeemed reſolved to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
he had a Deſign to carry her off; and,
knowing that an Attempt of that Nature upon
an Heireſs might have dangerous Conſequences,
he reſolved to accept the Conditions ſhe offered
him: But while he delivered his Hanger to the
Servant, he aſſured her in the ſtrongeſt Terms,
that he had no other Deſign in riding up to her,
but to have a nearer View of her Perſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0005700701:42"/>
Add not Falſhood, ſaid <hi>Arabella</hi> ſternly, to a
Crime already black enough; for tho', by an
Effect of my Generoſity, I have reſolved not to
deliver you up to the Reſentment of my Father,
yet nothing ſhall ever be able to make me par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
this Outrage. Go then, purſued ſhe, go,
baſe Man, unworthy of the Care I took of thy
Safety; go to ſome diſtant Country, where I
may never hear of thee more; and ſuffer me, if
poſſible, to loſe the Remembrance of thy
Crimes,</p>
               <p>Saying this, ſhe ordered her Servants, who
had got the Hanger in their Poſſeſſion, to ſet
him at Liberty, and mount their Horſes; which
they did immediately, and followed their Lady,
who rode with all imaginable Speed to the
Caſtle.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Hervey,</hi> not yet recovered from his Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
ſtood ſome Moments conſidering the
ſtrange Scene he had been Witneſs to; and in
which he had, much againſt his Will, appeared
the principal Character. As he was not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with Lady <hi>Bella</hi>'s Foible, he concluded
her Fears of him were occaſioned by her Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity,
and ſome Miſrepreſentations that had
been made her by <hi>Lucy,</hi> who, he thought, had
betrayed him; and, fearing this ridiculous
Adventure would be ſoon made public, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
expoſed to the Sneers of his Country Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
he reſolved to go back to <hi>London</hi> as
ſoon as poſſible.</p>
               <p>The next Day, pretending he had received a
Letter which obliged him to ſet out immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately,
he took Leave of his Couſin, heartily
glad at the Eſcape he ſhould make from his Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0005700701:43"/>
for he did not doubt but the Story would
very ſoon be known, and told greatly to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Arabella,</hi> in order to be completely ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous,
a Quality for which all the Heroines
are famous, laid a Command upon her two At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants
not to mention what had paſſed, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, at the ſame time, Money to ſecure
their Secrecy; and threatening them with her
Diſpleaſure, if they diſobeyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> as ſoon as ſhe had an Opportunity,
did not fail to acquaint her faithful <hi>Lucy</hi> with
the Danger from which ſhe had ſo happily
eſcaped, thanking Heaven at the ſame time
with great Devotion, for having preſerved her
from the Hands of the Raviſher.</p>
               <p>Two or three Months rolled away, after this
Accident, without offering any new Adventure
to our fair Viſionary; when her Imagination,
always prepoſſeſſed with the ſame fantaſtic Ideas,
made her ſtumble upon another Miſtake, equal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
abſurd and ridiculous.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>In which ſome Contradictions are very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
reconciled.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE Marquis's head Gardener had received
a young Fellow into his Maſter's Service,
who had lived in ſeveral Families of Diſtinction.
He had a good Face; was tolerably genteel;
and, having an Underſtanding ſomething above
his Condition, join'd to a great deal of <hi>ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0005700701:44"/>
Politeneſs, which he had contracted while
he lived at <hi>London,</hi> he appeared a very extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Perſon among the Ruſtics who were his
Fellow-Servants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> when ſhe walked in the Garden,
had frequent Opportunities of ſeeing this young
Man, whom ſhe obſerved with a very particular
Attention. His Perſon and Air had ſomething,
ſhe thought, very diſtinguiſhing. When ſhe
condeſcended to ſpeak to him about any Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
he was employed in, ſhe took Notice, that
his Anſwers were framed in a Language vaſtly
ſuperior to his Condition; and the Reſpect he
paid her had quite another Air from that of
the aukward Civility of the other Servants.</p>
               <p>Having diſcerned ſo many Marks of a Birth
far from being mean, ſhe eaſily paſſed from an
Opinion that he was a Gentleman, to a Belief
that he was ſomething more; and every new
Sight of him adding Strength to her Suſpicions,
ſhe remained, in a little time, perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
that he was ſome Perſon of Quality, who,
diſguiſed in the Habit of a Gardener, had intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
himſelf into her Father's Service, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to have an Opportunity of declaring a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to her, which muſt certainly be very great,
ſince it had forced him to aſſume an Appearance
ſo unworthy of his noble Extraction.</p>
               <p>Wholly poſſeſſed with this Thought, ſhe ſet
herſelf to obſerve him more narrowly; and ſoon
found out, that he went very aukwardly about
his Work; that he ſought Opportunities of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alone; that he threw himſelf in her Way
as often as he could, and gazed on her very at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively:
She ſometimes fanſied ſhe ſaw him
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0005700701:45"/>
endeavour to ſmother a Sigh when he anſwered
her any Queſtion about his Work; once ſaw
him leaning againſt a Tree with his Hands
croſſed upon his Breaſt; and, having loſt a
String of ſmall Pearls, which ſhe remembered
he had ſeen her threading as ſhe ſat in one of the
Arbours, was perſuaded he had taken it up,
and kept it for the Object of his ſecret Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>She often wondered, indeed, that ſhe did not
find her Name carved on the Trees, with ſome
myſterious Expreſſions of Love; that he was
never diſcovered lying along the Side of one of
the little Rivulets, increaſing the Stream with his
Tears; nor, for three Months that he had lived
there, had ever been ſick of a Fever cauſed by
his Grief, and the Conſtraint he put upon himſelf
in not declaring his Paſſion: But ſhe conſidered
again, that his Fear of being diſcovered kept
him from amuſing himſelf with making the
Trees bear the Records of his ſecret Thoughts,
or of indulging his Melancholy in any Manner
expreſſive of the Condition of his Soul; and, as
for his not being ſick, his Youth, and the
Strength of his Conſtitution, might, even for a
longer time, bear him up againſt the Aſſaults of
a Fever: But he appeared much thinner and
paler than he uſed to be; and ſhe concluded,
therefore, that he muſt in time ſink under the
Violence of his Paſſion, or elſe be forced to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
it to her; which ſhe conſidered as a very
great Misfortune; for, not finding in herſelf
any Diſpoſition to approve his Love, ſhe muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
baniſh him from her Preſence, for fear
he ſhould have the Preſumption to hope, that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0005700701:46"/>
Time might do any thing in his Favour: And
it was poſſible alſo, that the Sentence ſhe would
be obliged to pronounce, might either cauſe his
Death, or force him to commit ſome extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
Action, which would diſcover him to her
Father, who would, perhaps, think her guilty
of holding a ſecret Correſpondence with him.</p>
               <p>Theſe Thoughts perplexed her ſo much, that,
hoping to find ſome Relief by unburdening her
Mind to <hi>Lucy,</hi> ſhe told her all her Uneaſineſs.
Ah! ſaid ſhe to her, looking upon <hi>Edward,</hi>
who had juſt paſſed them, how unfortunate do
I think myſelf in being the Cauſe of that Paſſion
which makes this illuſtrious Unknown wear
away his Days in ſo ſhameful an Obſcurity!
Yes, <hi>Lucy,</hi> purſued ſhe, that <hi>Edward,</hi> whom
you regard as one of my Father's menial Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
is a Perſon of <hi>ſublime Quality,</hi> who ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
to this Diſguiſe only to have an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of ſeeing me every Day. But why do you
ſeem ſo ſurpriſed? Is it poſſible, that you have
not ſuſpected him to be what he is? Has he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
unwittingly made any Diſcovery of himſelf?
Have you not ſurpriſed him in Diſcourſe with
his faithful 'Squire, who, certainly, lurks here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts
to receive his Commands, and is haply
the Confident of his Paſſion? Has he never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
you with any Converſation about me?
Or have you never ſeen any valuable Jewels
in his Poſſeſſion by which you ſuſpected him to
be not what he appears?</p>
               <p>Truly, Madam, replied <hi>Lucy,</hi> I never took
him for any body elſe but a ſimple Gardener;
but now you open my Eyes, methinks I can
find I have been ſtrangely miſtaken; for he does
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0005700701:47"/>
not look like a Man of low Degree; and he
talks quite in another Manner from our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.
I never heard him indeed ſpeak of your
Ladyſhip, but once; and that was, when he
firſt ſaw you walking in the Garden, he aſked
our <hi>John,</hi> If you was not the Marquis's Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
And he ſaid, You was as beautiful as an
Angel. As for ſine Jewels, I never ſaw any;
and I believe he has none; but he has a Watch,
and that looks as if he was ſomething, Madam:
Nor do I remember to have ſeen him talk with
any Stranger that looked like a 'Squire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucy,</hi> having thus, with her uſual Punctuality,
anſwered every Queſtion her Lady put to her,
proceeded to aſk her, What ſhe ſhould ſay, if
he ſhould beg her to give her a Letter, as the
other Gentleman had done?</p>
               <p>You muſt by no means take it, replied <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella:</hi>
My Compaſſion had before like to have
been fatal to me. If he diſcovers his Quality to
me, I ſhall know in what manner to treat him.</p>
               <p>They were in this Part of their Diſcourſe,
when a Noiſe they heard at ſome Diſtance,
made <hi>Arabella</hi> bend her Steps to the Place from
whence it proceeded; and, to her infinite Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſaw the head Gardener, with a Stick he
had in his Hand, give ſeveral Blows to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
Hero, who ſuffered the Indignity with
admirable Patience.</p>
               <p>Shocked at ſeeing a Perſon of Quality treated
ſo unworthily, ſhe called out to the Gardener
to hold his Hand; who immediately obeyed;
and <hi>Edward,</hi> ſeeing the young Lady advance,
ſneaked off, with an Air very different from an
<hi>Oroondates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0005700701:48"/>
For what Crime, pray, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> with
a ſtern Aſpect, did you treat the Perſon I ſaw
with you ſo cruelly? He whom you take ſuch
unbecoming Liberties with, may poſſibly—But
again I aſk you, What has he done? You
ſhould make ſome Allowance for his want of
Skill in the abject Employment he is in at
preſent.</p>
               <p>It is not for his want of Skill, Madam, ſaid the
Gardener, that I corrected him; he knows his
Buſineſs very well, if he would mind it; but,
Madam, I have diſcovered him—</p>
               <p>Diſcovered him, do you ſay? interrupted
<hi>Arabella:</hi> And has the Knowledge of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
not been able to prevent ſuch Uſage? or
rather, Has it been the Occaſion of his receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it?</p>
               <p>His Conditions are very bad, Madam, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
the Gardener; and I am afraid are ſuch
as will one Day prove the Ruin of Body and
Soul too. I have for ſome time ſuſpected he
had bad Deſigns in his Head; and juſt now
watched him to the Fiſh-pond, and prevented
him from—</p>
               <p>O dear! interrupted <hi>Lucy,</hi> looking pitifully
on her Lady, whoſe fair Boſom heaved with
Compaſſion, I warrant he was going to make
away with himſelf.</p>
               <p>No, reſumed the Gardener, ſmiling at the
Miſtake, he was only going to make away with
ſome of the Carp, which the Rogue had
caught, and intended, I ſuppoſe, to ſell; but
I threw them into the Water again; and if
your Ladyſhip had not forbid me, I would have
drubbed him ſoundly for his Pains.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0005700701:49"/>
Fye! fye! interrupted <hi>Arabella,</hi> out of Breath
with Shame and Vexation, tell me no more of
theſe idle Tales.</p>
               <p>Then, haſtily walking on to hide the Bluſhes
which this ſtrange Accuſation of her illuſtrious
Lover had raiſed in her Face, ſhe continued for
ſome time in the greateſt Perplexity ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucy,</hi> who followed her, and could not
poſſibly reconcile what her Lady had been telling
her concerning <hi>Edward,</hi> with the Circumſtance
of his ſtealing the Carp, ardently wiſhed to hear
her Opinion of this Matter; but, ſeeing her
deeply engaged with her own Thoughts, ſhe
would not venture to diſturb her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella</hi> indeed, had been in ſuch a terrible
Conſternation, that it was ſome Time before
ſhe even reconciled Appearances to herſelf; but,
as ſhe had a moſt happy Faculty in accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating
every Incident to her own Wiſhes and
Conceptions, ſhe examined this Matter ſo many
different Ways, drew ſo many Concluſions, and
fanſied ſo many Myſteries in the moſt indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Actions of the ſuppoſed noble Unknown,
that ſhe remained, at laſt, more than ever
confirmed in the Opinion, that he was ſome
great Perſonage, whom her Beauty had forced
to aſſume an Appearance unworthy of himſelf:
When <hi>Lucy,</hi> no longer able to keep Silence,
drew off her Attention from thoſe pleaſing
Images, by ſpeaking of the Carp-ſtealing Affair
again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> whoſe Confuſion returned at that
diſagreeable Sound, charged her, in an angry
Tone, never to mention ſo injurious a Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0005700701:50"/>
any more: For, in fine, ſaid ſhe to her,
do you imagine a Perſon of his Rank could be
guilty of ſtealing Carp? Alas! purſued ſhe,
ſighing, he had, indeed, ſome fatal Deſign;
and, doubtleſs, would have executed it, had not
this Fellow ſo luckily prevented him.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Woodbind,</hi> Madam, ſaid <hi>Lucy,</hi> ſaw
the Carp in his Hand: I wonder what he was
going to do with them.</p>
               <p>Still, reſumed <hi>Arabella,</hi> extremely chagrined,
ſtill will you wound my Ears with that horrid
Sound? I tell you, obſtinate and fooliſh Wench,
that this unhappy Man went thither to die; and
if he really caught the Fiſh, it was to conceal
his Deſign from <hi>Woodbind:</hi> His great Mind
could not ſuggeſt to him, that it was poſſible he
might be ſuſpected of a Baſeneſs like that this
ignorant Fellow accuſed him of; therefore he
took no Care about it, being wholly poſſeſſed
by his deſpairing Thoughts.</p>
               <p>However, Madam, ſaid <hi>Lucy,</hi> your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
may prevent his going to the Fiſhpond again,
by laying your Commands upon him to live.</p>
               <p>I ſhall do all that I ought, anſwered <hi>Arabella;</hi>
but my Care for the Safety of other Perſons muſt
not make me forget what I owe to my own.</p>
               <p>As ſhe had always imputed Mr. <hi>Hervey</hi>'s fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied
Attempt to carry her away, to the Letter
ſhe had written to him, upon which he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
founded his Hopes of being pardoned for
it, ſhe reſolved to be more cautious for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in giving ſuch Inſtances of her Compaſſion;
and was at a great Loſs in what manner to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
her deſpairing Lover, without raiſing Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations
ſhe had no Inclination to confirm:
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0005700701:51"/>
But ſhe was delivered from her Perplexity by
the News of his having left the Marquis's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
which ſhe attributed to ſome new Deſign
he had formed to obtain her; and <hi>Lucy,</hi> who
always thought as her Lady did, was of the
ſame Opinion; tho' it was talked among the
Servants, that <hi>Edward</hi> feared a Diſcovery of
more Tricks, and reſolved not to ſtay till he
was diſgracefully diſmiſſed.</p>

                  <hi>ARABELLA</hi> had ſcarce done thinking of
this laſt Adventure, when the Marquis
communicated a Piece of Intelligence to her,
which opened a Proſpect of an infinite Number
of new ones.</p>
               <p>His Nephew, having juſt returned from his
Travels, was preparing to come and pay him a
Viſit in his Retreat; and, as he always deſigned
to marry <hi>Arabella</hi> to this Youth, of whom he

the intended Viſit of her Couſin, whom ſhe had
not ſeen ſince ſhe was eight Years old; and,
for the firſt time, inſinuated his Deſign of giving
him to her for an Huſband.</p>

                  </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
could hardly hide her Chagrin; for,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0005700701:52"/>
tho' ſhe always intended to marry ſome time or
other, as all the Heroines had done, yet ſhe
thought ſuch an Event ought to be brought about
with an infinite deal of Trouble; and that it
was neceſſary ſhe ſhould paſs to this State thro'
a great Number of Cares, Diſappointments, and
Diſtreſſes of various Kinds, like them; that her
Lover ſhould purchaſe her with his Sword from
a Croud of Rivals; and arrive to the Poſſeſſion
of her Heart by many Years of Services and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity.</p>
               <p>The Impropriety of receiving a Lover of a

the Man that was choſe for her? In thoſe Caſes
the Remonſtrances of a Parent are called Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions;
obſtinate Reſiſtance, Conſtancy and
Courage; and an Aptitude to diſlike the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
propoſed to them, a noble Freedom of Mind
which diſdains to love or hate by the Caprice of
others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> ſtrengthening her own Reſolutions
by thoſe Examples of heroic Diſobedience, told
her Father, with great Solemnity of Accent,
that ſhe would always obey him in all juſt and
reaſonable Things; and, being perſuaded that
he would never attempt to lay any Force upon
her Inclinations, ſhe would endeavour to make
them conformable to his, and receive her Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin

with his Eſteem.</p>
               <p>The Marquis, having had frequent Occaſions
of admiring his Daughter's Eloquence, did not
draw any unpleaſing Concluſion from the nice
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0005700701:53"/>
Diſtinctions ſhe made; and, being perfectly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
of her Conſent whenever he demanded it,
expected the Arrival of his Nephew with great
Impatience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> whoſe Thoughts had been fully
employed ſince this Converſation with her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
was indulging her Meditations in one of
the moſt retired Walks in the Garden; when
ſhe was informed by <hi>Lucy,</hi> that her Couſin was
come, and that the Marquis had brought him
into the Garden to look for her.</p>
               <p>That Inſtant they both entered the Walk,
when <hi>Arabella,</hi> prepoſſeſſed, as ſhe was, againſt
any favourable Thoughts of the young <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
could not help betraying ſome Surprize at
the Gracefulneſs of his Figure.</p>
               <p>It muſt be confeſſed, ſaid ſhe to her Attendant,
with a Smile, that this Lover my Father has
brought us, is no contemptible Perſon: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
I feel an invincible Repugnance in myſelf
againſt receiving him in that Character.</p>
               <p>As ſhe finiſhed theſe Words, the Marquis
came up, and preſented Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> to her;
who, ſaluting her with the Freedom of a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
gave her a Diſguſt that ſhewed itſelf imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
in her fair Face, which was overſpread
with ſuch a Gloom, that the Marquis was quite
aſtoniſhed at it. Indeed <hi>Arabella,</hi> who expected
he would hardly have preſumed to kiſs her Hand,
was ſo ſurpriſed at his Freedom, in attempting
her Lips, that ſhe not only expreſſed her Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
by Frowns, but gave him to underſtand
he had mortally offended her.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> however, was neither ſurpriſed
nor angry at her Reſentment; but, imputing it
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0005700701:54"/>
to her Country Education, endeavoured to railly
her out of her ill Humour; and the Marquis, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
glad to find a Behaviour, which he thought
proceeded from her Diſlike of her Couſin, was
only an Effect of an over-ſcrupulous Modeſty,
told her that Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> had committed no
Offence by ſaluting her, ſince that was a Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
which was granted to all Strangers at the
firſt Interview, and therefore could not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
to a Relation.</p>
               <p>Since the World is ſo degenerate in it's Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
from what it was formerly, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi>
with a Smile full of Contempt upon her Couſin,
I am extremely happy in having lived in a Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
which has not yet expoſed me to the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
of being a Witneſs to Manners I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
approve; for if every Perſon I ſhall meet
with for the future be ſo deficient in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
to Ladies, as my Couſin is, I ſhall not care
how much I am ſecluded from Society.</p>
               <p>But, dear Lady <hi>Bella,</hi> interrupted Mr. <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi>
gaily, tell me, I beſeech you, how I muſt
behave to pleaſe you; for I ſhould be extremely
glad to be honoured with your good Opinion.</p>
               <p>The Perſon, reſumed ſhe, whom I muſt
teach how to acquire my good Opinion, will,
I am afraid, hardly recompenſe me by his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility
in learning, for the Pains I ſhould be at in
inſtructing him.</p>
               <p>But, reſumed <hi>Glanville,</hi> that I may avoid any
more Occaſions of offending you, only let me
know how you would be approached for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Since, anſwered ſhe, there is no Neceſſity to
renew the Ceremony of introducing you again
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0005700701:55"/>
to me, I have not a ſecond Affront of that Kind
to apprehend; but I pray tell me, If all Cavaliers
are as preſuming as yourſelf; and if a Relation
of your Sex does not think a modeſt Embrace
from a Lady a Welcome ſufficiently tender<note n="*" place="bottom">The Heroines, tho' they think a' Kiſs of the Hand a great Condeſcention to a Lover, and never grant it without Bluſhes and Confuſion; yet make no Scruple to embrace him upon every ſhort Abſence.</note>?</p>
               <p>Nay, Couſin, cried <hi>Glanville</hi> eagerly, I am
now perſuaded you are in the Right; an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
is certainly to be preferred to a cold Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute.
What would I give, that the Marquis
would introduce me a ſecond time, that I might
be received with ſo delightful a Welcome?</p>
               <p>The Vivacity with which he ſpoke this was ſo
extremely diſagreeable to <hi>Arabella,</hi> that ſhe turned
from him abruptly, and, ſtriking into another
Walk, ordered <hi>Lucy</hi> to tell him ſhe commanded
him not to follow her.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> however, who had no No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the exact Obedience which was expected
from him, would have gone after her, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
this Prohibition, which <hi>Lucy</hi> delivered
in a moſt peremptory Manner, after her Lady's
Example: But the Marquis, who had left the
two young People at Liberty to diſcourſe, and
had walked on, that he might not interrupt them,
turning about, and ſeeing <hi>Glanville</hi> alone, called
him to have ſome private Diſcourſe with him;
and, for that time, ſpared <hi>Arabella</hi> the Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of ſeeing her Commands diſobeyed.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>In which a Lover is ſeverely puniſhed for
Faults which the Reader never would
have diſcovered, if he had not been told.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE Marquis, tho' he had reſolved to give
<hi>Arabella</hi> to his Nephew, was deſirous he
ſhould firſt receive ſome impreſſions of Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
for her, before he abſolutely declared his
Reſolution; and ardently wiſhed he might be
able to overcome that Reluctance which ſhe
ſeemed to have for Marriage: But, tho' <hi>Glanville</hi>
in a very few Days became paſſionately in Love
with his charming Couſin, yet ſhe diſcovered ſo
ſtrong a Diſlike to him, that the Marquis feared it
would be difficult to make her receive him for an
Huſband: He obſerved ſhe took all Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
of avoiding his Converſation; and ſeemed
always out of Temper when he addreſſed any
thing to her; but was well enough pleaſed,
when he diſcourſed with him; and would liſten
to the long Converſations they had together with
great Attention.</p>
               <p>The Truth is, ſhe had too much Diſcernment
not to ſee Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> had a great deal of
Merit; his Perſon was perfectly handſome; he
poſſeſſed a great Share of Underſtanding, an
eaſy Temper, and a Vivacity which charmed
every one, but the inſenſible <hi>Arabella.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She often wondered, that a Man, who, as
ſhe told her Confident, was Maſter of ſo many
fine Qualities, ſhould have a Diſpoſition ſo little
capable of feeling the Paſſion of Love, with the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0005700701:57"/>
Delicacy and Fervour ſhe expected to inſpire;
or, that he, whoſe Converſation was ſo pleaſing
on every other Subject, ſhould make ſo poor a
Figure when he entertained her with Matters
of Gallantry. However, added ſhe, I ſhould
be to blame to deſire to be beloved by Mr. <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville;</hi>
for I am perſuaded that Paſſion would
cauſe no Reformation in the Coarſeneſs of his
Manners to Ladies, which makes him ſo diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to me, and might poſſibly increaſe my
Averſion.</p>
               <p>The Marquis, having ſtudied his Nephew's
Looks for ſeveral Days, thought he ſaw Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
enough in them for <hi>Arabella,</hi> to make
him receive the Knowlege of his Intention with
Joy: He, therefore, called him into his Cloſet,
and told him in few Words, that, if his Heart
was not pre-engaged, and his Daughter capable
of making him happy, he reſolved to beſtow
her upon him, together with all his Eſtates.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> received this agreeable News
with the ſtrongeſt Expreſſions of Gratitude; aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring
his Uncle, that Lady <hi>Bella,</hi> of all the
Women he had ever ſeen, was moſt agreeable
to his Taſte; and that he felt for her all the
Tenderneſs and Affection his Soul was capable
of.</p>
               <p>I am glad of it, my dear Nephew, ſaid the
Marquis, embracing him: I will allow you,
added he ſmiling, but a few Weeks to court her:
Gain her Heart as ſoon as you can, and when
you bring me her Conſent, your Marriage ſhall
be ſolemnized immediately.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> needed not a Repetition of ſo
agreeable a Command: He left his Uncle's Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0005700701:58"/>
with his Heart filled with the Expectation of
his approaching Happineſs; and, underſtanding
<hi>Arabella</hi> was in the Garden, he went to her
with a Reſolution to acquaint her with the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
her Father had given him to make his
Addreſſes to her.</p>
               <p>He found his fair Couſin, as uſual, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with her Women; and, ſeeing that, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
his Approach, they ſtill continued
to walk with her, and impatient of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint
they laid him under, I beſeech you, Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin,
ſaid he, let me have the Pleaſure of walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with you alone: What Neceſſity is there for
always having ſo many Witneſſes of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation?
You may retire, ſaid he, ſpeaking
to <hi>Lucy,</hi> and the other Woman; I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to ſay to your Lady in private.</p>
               <p>Stay, I command you, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> bluſhing
at an Inſolence ſo uncommon, and take Orders
from no one but myſelf.—I pray you, Sir, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
ſhe frowning, What Intercourſe of Secrets
is there between you and me, that you expect
I ſhould favour you with a private Converſation?
An Advantage which none of your Sex ever
boaſted to have gained from me; and which,
haply, you ſhould be the laſt upon whom I
ſhould beſtow it.</p>
               <p>You have the ſtrangeſt Notions, anſwered
<hi>Glanville,</hi> ſmiling at the pretty Anger ſhe diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered:
Certainly you may hold a private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
with any Gentleman, without giving
Offence to Decorum; and I may plead a Right
to this Happineſs, above any other, ſince I have
the Honour to be your Relation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:0005700701:59"/>
It is not at all ſurpriſing, reſumed <hi>Arabella</hi>
gravely, that you and I ſhould differ in Opinion
upon this Occaſion: I don't remember that ever
we agreed in any thing; and, I am apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
we never ſhall.</p>
               <p>Ah! don't ſay ſo, Lady <hi>Bella,</hi> interrupted
lie: What a Proſpect of Miſery you lay before
me! For, if we are always to be oppoſite to each
other, it is neceſſary you muſt hate me as much
as I admire and love you.</p>
               <p>Theſe Words, which he accompanied with
a gentle Preſſure of her Hand, threw the aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
<hi>Arabella</hi> into ſuch an Exceſs of Anger
and Shame, that, for a few Moments, ſhe was
unable to utter a Word.</p>
               <p>What a horrid Violation this, of all the
Laws of Gallantry and Reſpect, which decree
a Lover to ſuffer whole Years in Silence before
he declares his Flame to the divine Object that
cauſes it; and then with awful Tremblings, and
ſubmiſſive Proſtrations at the Feet of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
Fair!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella</hi> could hardly believe her Senſes when
ſhe heard a Declaration, not only made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the uſual Forms, but alſo, that the preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Criminal waited for her Anſwer, without
ſeeming to have any Apprehenſion of the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
to which he was to be doomed; and
that, inſtead of deprecating her Wrath, he
looked with a ſmiling Wonder upon her Eyes,
as if he did not fear their Lightenings would
ſtrike him dead.</p>
               <p>Indeed, it was ſcarce poſſible for him to help ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and wondering too, at the extraordinary
Notion of <hi>Arabella;</hi> for, as ſoon as he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0005700701:60"/>
thoſe fatal Words, ſhe ſtarted back two
or three Steps; caſt a Look at him full of the
higheſt Indignation; and, lifting up her fine
Eyes to Heaven, ſeemed, in the Language of
Romance, to accuſe the Gods for ſubjecting
her to ſo cruel an Indignity.</p>
               <p>The Tumult of her Thoughts being a little
ſettled, ſhe turned again towards <hi>Glanville;</hi> whoſe
Countenance expreſſing nothing of that Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and Anxiety common to an Adorer in ſo
critical a Circumſtance, her Rage returned with
greater Violence than ever.</p>
               <p>If I do not expreſs all the Reſentment your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence
has filled me with, ſaid ſhe to him, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
more Scorn than Anger, 'tis becauſe I
hold you too mean for my Reſentment; but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
hope for my Pardon for your preſumptuous
Confeſſion of a Paſſion I could almoſt deſpiſe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
for inſpiring. If it be true that you love me,
go and find your Puniſhment in that Abſence to
which I doom you; and never hope I will ſuffer
a Perſon in my Preſence, who has affronted me
in the manner you have done.</p>
               <p>Saying this, ſhe walked away, making a Sign
to him not to follow her.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> who was at firſt diſpoſed to
laugh at the ſtrange Manner in which ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
his Expreſſions of Eſteem for her, found
ſomething, ſo extremely haughty and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
in the Speech ſhe had made, that he was
almoſt mad with Vexation.</p>
               <p>As he had no Notion of his Couſin's heroic
Sentiments, and had never read Romances, he
was quite ignorant of the Nature of his Offence;
and, ſuppoſing the Scorn ſhe had expreſſed for
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0005700701:61"/>
him was founded upon the Difference of their
Rank and Fortune, his Pride was ſo ſenſibly
mortified at that Thought, and at her ſo inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
forbiding him her Preſence, that he was
once inclined to ſhew his Reſentment of ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genteel
Uſage, by quitting the Caſtle without
taking Leave even of the Marquis, who, he
thought, could not be ignorant of the Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he was likely to meet with from his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and ought to have guarded him againſt it,
if he really meant him ſo well as he ſeemed to
do.</p>
               <p>As he was extremely violent and haſty in his
Reſolutions, and nicely ſenſible of the leaſt Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front,
he was not in a Condition to reaſon juſtly
upon the Marquis's Conduct in this Affair; and
while he was fluctuating with a thouſand differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Reſolutions, <hi>Lucy</hi> came to him with a Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
from her Lady, which ſhe delivered without
ſtaying till he opened it; and was ſuperſcribed
in this Manner:</p>

                     <p>YOU ſeem to acknowlege ſo little Reſpect
and Deference for the Commands of a

add Diſobedience to the Crime by which you

               </floatingText>
               <p>The Superſcription of this Letter, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common
Style of it, perſuaded Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi>
that what he had been fooliſh enough to reſent
as an Affront, was deſigned as a Jeſt, and
meant to divert him as well as herſelf: He exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
her Behaviour again, and wondered at
his Stupidity in not diſcovering it before. His
Reſentment vaniſhing immediately, he returned
to the Houſe; and went, without Ceremony,
to <hi>Arabella</hi>'s Apartment, which he entered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhe perceived him, being in a profound
Muſing at one of the Windows: The Noiſe he
made, in approaching her, obliged her at laſt
to look up; when, ſtarting, as if ſhe had ſeen a
Baſiliſk, ſhe flew to her Cloſet, and, ſhutting the
Door with great Violence, commanded him to
leave her Chamber immediately.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> ſtill ſuppoſing her in Jeſt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
her to open the Door; but, finding ſhe
continued obſtinate, Well, ſaid he, going away,
I ſhall be revenged on you ſome time hence,
and make you repent the Tricks you play me
now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella</hi> not being able to imagine any thing,
by theſe Words he ſpoke in Raillery, but that
he really, in the Spite and Anguiſh of his Heart,
threatened her with executing ſome terrible En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize;
ſhe did not doubt, but he either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to carry her away; or, thinking her
Averſion to him proceeded from his having a
Rival happy enough to be eſteemed by her, thoſe
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0005700701:63"/>
myſterious Words he had uttered related to his
Deſign of killing him; ſo that as ſhe knew, he
could diſcover no Rival to wreak his Revenge
upon, ſhe feared, that, at once to ſatisfy that
Paſſion as well as his Love, he would make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
Maſter of her Liberty: For, in fine, ſaid ſhe
to <hi>Lucy,</hi> to whom ſhe communicated all her
Thoughts, have I not every thing to apprehend
from a Man, who knows ſo little how to treat
my Sex with the Reſpect which is our Due;
and who, after having, contrary to the timorous
Nature of that Paſſion, inſulted me with a free
Declaration of Love, treated my Commands
with the utmoſt Contempt by appearing before
me again; and even threatens me with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
he is meditating at this Moment?</p>
               <p>Had Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> been preſent, and heard
the terrible Misfortunes which ſhe preſaged from
the few Words he had jeſtingly ſpoke, he would
certainly have made her quite furious, by the
Diverſion her Miſtake would have afforded him.
But the more ſhe reflected on his Words, the
more ſhe was perſuaded of the terrible Purpoſe
of them.</p>
               <p>'Twas in vain to acquaint her Father with
the Reaſons ſhe had for diſliking his Choice: His
Reſolution was fixed, and if ſhe did not volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily
conform to it, ſhe expoſed herſelf to the
Attempts of a violent and unjuſt Lover, who
would either prevail upon the Marquis to lay
a Force upon her Inclinations, or make himſelf
Maſter of her Perſon, and never ceaſe perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
her, till he had obliged her to give him
her Hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0005700701:64"/>
Having reaſoned herſelf into a perfect Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
that all theſe things muſt neceſſarily hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
ſhe thought it both juſt and reaſonable to
provide for her own Security, by a ſpeedy Flight.
The Want of a Precedent, indeed, for an Action
of this Nature, held her a few Moments in Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe;
for ſhe did not remember to have read
of any Heroine that voluntarily left her Father's
Houſe, however perſecuted ſhe might be; but ſhe
conſidered, that there was not any of the Ladies
in Romances, in the ſame Circumſtances with
herſelf who was without a favoured Lover, for
whoſe ſake it might have been believed ſhe had
made an Elopement, which would have been
highly prejudicial to her Glory; and, as there
was no Foundation for any Suſpicion of that
Kind in her Caſe, ſhe thought there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to hinder her from withdrawing from a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical
Exertion of parental Authority, and the
ſecret Machinations of a Lover, whoſe Aim was
to take away her Liberty, either by obliging her
to marry him, or by making her a Priſoner.</p>

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0005700701:65"/>
threatened her, when ſhe was interrupted by
<hi>Lucy,</hi> who, after deſiring Admittance, informed
her, that the Marquis, having rode out to take

ſo many Charms, that he gazed on her with an
Eagerneſs and Delight that could not eſcape her
Obſervation.</p>
               <p>She bluſhed exceſſively at the paſſionate Looks
he gave her; and, finding the Marquis's Indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
not conſiderable enough to oblige her
to a conſtant Attendance at his Bed-ſide, ſhe took
the firſt Opportunity of returning to her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
but, as ſhe was going out, <hi>Glanville</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
his Hand to lead her up Stairs: Which
ſhe ſcornfully refuſing;</p>
               <p>Sure, Couſin, ſaid he, a little piqued, you
are not diſpoſed to carry on your ill-natured Jeſt
any further?</p>
               <p>If you imagined I jeſted with you, ſaid <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi>
I am rather to accuſe the Slowneſs of your
Underſtanding, for your perſiſting in treating
me thus freely, than the Inſolence I firſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
it to: But, whatever is the Cauſe of it,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0005700701:66"/>
I now tell you again, that you have extremely
offended me; and, if my Father's Illneſs did
not ſet Bounds to my Reſentment at preſent, I
would make you know, that I would not ſuffer
the Injury you do me, ſo patiently.</p>
               <p>Since you would have me to believe you are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
replied <hi>Glanville,</hi> be pleaſed to let me
know what Offence it is you complain of; for
I proteſt I am quite at a Loſs to underſtand
you.</p>
               <p>Was it not enough, reſumed <hi>Arabella,</hi> to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
me with an inſolent Declaration of your
Paſſion, but you muſt alſo, in Contempt of my
Commands to the contrary, appear before me
again, purſue me to my Chamber, and uſe the
moſt brutal Menaces to me?</p>
               <p>Hold, pray, Madam, interrupted <hi>Glanville,</hi>
and ſuffer me to aſk you, If it is my Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in declaring myſelf your Admirer, that
you are ſo extremely offended at?</p>
               <p>Doubtleſs it is, Sir, anſwered <hi>Arabella;</hi> and
ſuch a Preſumption, as, without the aggravating
Circumſtances you have ſince added to it, is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to make me always your Enemy.</p>
               <p>I beg Pardon, returned Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> gravely,
for that Offence; and alſo, for ſtaying any
longer in a Houſe, which you have, ſo gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teelly,
turned me out of.</p>
               <p>My Pardon, Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> reſumed ſhe, is
not ſo eaſily gained: Time, and your Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
may, indeed, do much towards obtaining
it.</p>
               <p>Saying this, ſhe made a Sign to him to retire;
for he had walked up with her to her Chamber:
But, finding he did not obey her, for really he
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0005700701:67"/>
was quite unacquainted with theſe Sorts of dumb
Commands, ſhe haſtily retired to her Cloſet, leſt
he ſhould attempt to move her Pity, by any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of Deſpair for the cruel Baniſhment ſhe
had doomed him to.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> ſeeing ſhe had ſhut herſelf up
in her Cloſet, left her Chamber, and retired to
his own, more confounded than ever at the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
of his Couſin.</p>
               <p>Her bidding him ſo peremptorily to leave the
Houſe, would have equally perſuaded him of
her Ignorance and Ill-breeding, had not the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance
of her Manners, in every other reſpect,
proved the contrary: Nor was it poſſible to doubt
ſhe had a great Share of Underſtanding; ſince
her Converſation, ſingular as ſome of her Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
ſeemed to him, was far ſuperior to moſt
other Ladies. Therefore, he concluded, the
Affront he had received, proceeded from her
Diſdain to admit the Addreſſes of any Perſon,
whoſe Quality was inferior to hers; which,
probably, was increaſed to ſome particular Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
ſhe had to his Perſon.</p>
               <p>His Honour would not permit him to make
Uſe of that Advantage her Father's Authority
could give him; and, wholly engroſſed by his
Reſentment of the Uſage he had received from
her, he reſolved to ſet out for <hi>London</hi> the next
Day without ſeeing the Marquis, from whom
he was apprehenſive of ſome Endeavours to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
him.</p>
               <p>Having taken this Reſolution, he ordered his
Servant to have the Horſes ready early in the
Morning; and, without taking any Notice of
his Intention, he left the Caſtle, riding, as faſt
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0005700701:68"/>
as poſſible, to the next Stage, from whence he
wrote to his Uncle; and, diſpatching a Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
with his Letter, held on his Way to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Marquis, being pretty well recovered
from his Indiſpoſition by a good Night's Reſt,
ſent for Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> in the Morning, to walk
with him, as was his Cuſtom, in the Garden;
but, hearing he had rode out, tho' he imagined
it was only to take the Air, yet he could not
help accuſing him, in his own Thoughts, of a
little Neglect; for which he reſolved to chide
him, when he returned: But his long Stay fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him with ſome Surprize, he was beginning
to expreſs his Fears that ſomething had befallen
him, to <hi>Arabella,</hi> who was then with him; when
a Servant preſented him the Letter, which Mr.
<hi>Glanville</hi>'s Meſſenger had that Moment brought.</p>
               <p>The Marquis caſting his Eyes on the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
and knowing his Nephew's Hand, Bleſs
me, cried he, extremely ſurpriſed, What can
this mean? <hi>Bella,</hi> added he, here's a Letter
from your Couſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> at theſe Words, ſtarted up; and,
preventing her Father, with a reſpectful Action,
from opening it, I beſeech you, my Lord, ſaid
ſhe, before you read this Letter, ſuffer me to
aſſure you, that, if it contains any thing fatal,
I am not at all acceſſary to it: 'Tis true I have
baniſhed my Couſin, as a Puniſhment for the
Offence he was guilty of towards me; but, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
is my Witneſs, I did not deſign his Death;
and if he has taken any violent Reſolution againſt
himſelf, he has greatly exceeded my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:0005700701:69"/>
The Marquis, whoſe Surprize was conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
increaſed by theſe Words, haſtily broke
open the Letter, which ſhe perceiving, hurried
out of the Room; and, locking herſelf up in
her Cloſet, began to bewail the Effect of her
Charms, as if ſhe was perfectly aſſured of her
Couſin's Death.</p>
               <p>The Marquis, however, who, from Lady
<hi>Bella</hi>'s Exclamation, had prepared himſelf for the
Knowlege of ſome very extraordinary Accident,
was leſs ſurpriſed, than he would otherwiſe have
been, at the Contents; which were as follow:</p>
               <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                  <body>

                     </opener>
                     <p>AS my leaving your Houſe ſo abruptly will
certainly make me appear guilty of a moſt
unpardonable Rudeneſs, I cannot diſpenſe with
myſelf from acquainting your Lordſhip with the
Cauſe; though, to ſpare the Reproaches Lady
<hi>Bella</hi> will probably caſt on me for doing ſo, I
could wiſh you knew it by any other Means.</p>
                     <p>But, my Lord, I value your Eſteem too much
to hazard the Loſs of it by ſuffering you to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
that I am capable of doing any thing to
diſpleaſe you. Lady <hi>Bella</hi> was pleaſed to order
me to ſtay no longer in the Houſe; and menaced
me with ſome very terrible Uſage, if I diſobeyed
her: She uſed ſo many other contemptuous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
to me, that, I am perſuaded, I ſhall
never be ſo happy as to poſſeſs the Honour you
deſigned for,</p>

When the Marquis had read this Letter, he
went to his Daughter's Apartment with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to chide her ſeverely for her Uſage of his
Nephew; but, ſeeing her come to meet him
with her Eyes bathed in Tears, he inſenſibly
loſt ſome Part of his Reſentment.</p>
               <p>Alas! my Lord, ſaid ſhe, I know you come
prepared to load me with Reproaches, upon my
Couſin's Account; but, I beſeech your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
do not aggravate my Sorrows: Tho' I ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> I did not deſire his Death;
and, queſtionleſs, if he knew how I <hi>reſent</hi> it,
his Ghoſt would be ſatisfied with the Sacrifice
I make him.</p>
               <p>The Marquis, not being able to help ſmiling
at this Conceit, which he ſaw had ſo ſtrongly
poſſeſſed her Imagination, that ſhe had no ſort
of Doubt but that her Couſin was dead, aſked
her, If ſhe really believed Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> loved
her well enough to die with Grief at her ill Uſage
of him?</p>
               <p>If, ſaid ſhe, he loves me not well enough to
die for me, he certainly loves me but little; and
I am the leſs obliged to him.</p>
               <p>But I deſire to know, interrupted the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis,
For what Crime it was you took the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to baniſh him from my Houſe?</p>
               <p>I baniſhed him, my Lord, reſumed ſhe, for
his Preſumption in telling me he loved me.</p>
               <p>That Preſumption, as you call it, tho' I
know not for what Reaſon, ſaid the Marquis,
was authorized by me: Therefore, know, <hi>Bella,</hi>
that I not only permit him to love you, but I
alſo expect you ſhould endeavour to return his
Affection; and look upon him as the Man
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0005700701:71"/>
whom I deſign for your Huſband: There's his
Letter, purſued he, putting it into her Hand.
I bluſh for the Rudeneſs you have been guilty
of; but endeavour to repair it, by a more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
Behaviour for the future: I am going to
ſend after him immediately to prevail upon to
return: Therefore, write him an Apology, I
charge you; and have it done by the Time my
Meſſenger is ready to ſet out.</p>
               <p>Saying this, he went out of the Room; and
<hi>Arabella</hi> eagerly opened the Letter; and, finding
it in a Style ſo different from what ſhe expected,
her Diſlike of him returned with more Violence
than ever.</p>
               <p>Ah! the Traitor! ſaid ſhe aloud, Is it thus
that he endeavours to move my Compaſſion?
How greatly did I over-rate his Affection, when
I imagined his Deſpair was capable of killing
him? Diſloyal Man! purſued ſhe, walking
about, Is it by Complaints to my Father that
thou expecteſt to ſucceed? And doſt thou ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
the Heart of <hi>Arabella</hi> is to be won by Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and Injuſtice?</p>
               <p>In this manner ſhe waſted the Time allotted
for her to write; and, when the Marquis ſent
for her Letter, having no Intention to comply,
ſhe went to his Chamber, conjuring him not to
oblige her to a Condeſcenſion ſo unworthy of
her.</p>
               <p>The Marquis, being now exceſſively angry
with her, roſe up in a Fury, and, leading her
to his Writing-Deſk, ordered her, inſtantly, to
write to her Couſin.</p>
               <p>If I muſt write, my Lord, ſaid ſhe, ſobbing,
pray be ſo good as to dictate what I muſt ſay.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0005700701:72"/>
Apologize for your rude Behaviour, ſaid the
Marquis; and deſire him, in the moſt obliging
manner you can, to return.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> ſeeing there was a neceſſity for obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
took up the Pen, and wrote the following
Billet:</p>
               <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                  <body>
                     <head>The unfortunate Arabella, to the moſt ungenerous
Glanville.</head>
                     <p>IT is not by the Power I have over you, that
I command you to return, for I diſclaim any
Empire over ſo unworthy a Subject; but, ſince
it is my Father's Pleaſure I ſhould invite you
back, I muſt let you know, that I repeal your
Baniſhment, and expect you will immediately
return with the Meſſenger who brings this; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
to ſpare your Acknowlegements, know,
that it is in Obedience to my Father's abſolute
Commands, that you receive this Mandate
from</p>

               </floatingText>
               <p>Having finiſhed this Billet, ſhe gave it to the
Marquis to read; who, finding a great deal of
his own Haughtineſs of Temper in it, could not
reſolve to check her for a Diſpoſition ſo like his
own: Yet he told her, her Stile was very uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon:
And pray, added he, ſmiling, who taught
you to ſuperſcribe your Letters thus, <q>The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
<hi>Arabella,</hi> to the moſt ungenerous
<hi>Glanville?</hi>
                  </q> Why, <hi>Bella,</hi> this Superſcription is
wholly calculated for the Bearer's Information:
But come, alter it immediately; for I don't
chooſe my Meſſenger ſhould know, that you
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0005700701:73"/>
are unfortunate, or that my Nephew is unge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous.</p>
               <p>Pray, my Lord, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> content
yourſelf with what I have already done in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to your Commands, and ſuffer my Letter
to remain as it is: Methinks it is but reaſonable
I ſhould expreſs ſome little Reſentment at the
Complaint my Couſin has been pleaſed to make
to you againſt me; nor can I poſſibly make my
Letter more obliging, without being guilty of
an unpardonable Meanneſs.</p>
               <p>You are a ſtrange Girl, replied the Marquis,
taking the Letter, and incloſing it in one from
himſelf; in which he earneſtly intreated his
Nephew to return, threatening him with his
Diſpleaſure, if he diſobeyed; and aſſuring him,
that his Daughter would receive him as well as
he could poſſibly deſire.</p>
               <p>The Meſſenger being diſpatched, with Orders
to ride Poſt, and overtake the young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
he obeyed his Orders ſo well, that he came
up with him at—, where he intended to lodge
that Night.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> who expected his Uncle would
make uſe of ſome Methods to recal him, opened
his Letter without any great Emotion; but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
another incloſed, his Heart leaped to his
Mouth, not doubting but it was a Letter from
<hi>Arabella;</hi> but the Contents ſurpriſed him ſo
much, that he hardly knew whether he ought to
look upon them as an Invitation to return, or
a new Affront, her Words were ſo diſtant and
haughty. The Superſcription being much the
ſame with a Billet he had received from her in
the Garden, which had made him conclude her
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0005700701:74"/>
in Jeſt, he knew not what to think of it: One
would ſwear this dear Girl's Head is turned,
ſaid he to himſelf, if ſhe had not more <hi>Wit</hi> than
her whole Sex beſides.</p>
               <p>After reading <hi>Arabella</hi>'s Letter ſeveral times,
he at laſt opened his Uncle's; and, ſeeing the
preſſing Inſtances he made him to return, he
reſolved to obey; and the next Morning ſet out
for the Caſtle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> during the time her Couſin was
expected, appeared ſo melancholy and reſerved,
that the Marquis was extremely uneaſy: You
have never, ſaid he to her, diſobeyed me in any
one Action of your Life; and I may with reaſon
expect you will conform to my Will in the Choice
I have made of a Huſband for you, ſince it is
impoſſible to make any Objection either to his
Perſon or Mind; and, being the Son of my
Siſter, he is certainly not unworthy of you, tho'
he has not a Title.</p>
               <p>My firſt Wiſh, my Lord, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> is
to live ſingle, not being deſirous of entering into
any Engagement which may hinder my Solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
and Cares, and leſſen my Attendance, upon
the beſt of Fathers, who, till now, has always
moſt tenderly complied with my Inclinations
in every thing: But if it is your abſolute Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
that I ſhould marry, give me not to one
who, tho' he has the Honour to be allied to you,
has neither merited your Eſteem, or my Favour,
by any Action worthy of his Birth, or the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
he pretends to have for me; for, in fine,
my Lord, by what Services has he deſerved the
Diſtinction with which you honour him? Has
he ever delivered you from any conſiderable
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0005700701:75"/>
Danger? Has he ſaved your Life, and hazarded
his own, for you, upon any Occaſion whatever?
Has he merited my Eſteem, by his Sufferings,
Fidelity, and Reſpect; or, by any great and
generous Action, given me a Teſtimony of his
Love, which ſhould oblige me to reward him
with my Affection? Ah! my Lord, I beſeech
you, think not ſo unworthily of your Daughter,
as to beſtow her upon one who has done ſo
little to deſerve her: If my Happineſs be dear
to you, do not precipitate me into a State from
whence you cannot recal me, with a Perſon
whom I can never affect.</p>
               <p>She would have gone on, but the Marquis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
her ſternly: I'll hear no more, ſaid
he, of your fooliſh and ridiculous Objections;
What Stuff is this you talk of? What Service
am I to expect from my Nephew? And by
what Sufferings is he to merit your Eſteem?
Aſſure yourſelf, <hi>Arabella,</hi> continued he, that
I will never pardon you, if you preſume to treat
my Nephew in the Manner you have done: I
perceive you have no real Objection to make to
him; therefore I expect you will endeavour to
obey me without Reluctance; for, ſince you
ſeem to be ſo little acquainted with what will
moſt conduce to your own Happineſs, you muſt
not think it ſtrange, if I inſiſt upon directing
your Choice in the moſt important Buſineſs of
your Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella</hi> was going to reply; but the Marquis
ordered her to be ſilent; and ſhe went to her
own Apartment in ſo much Affliction, that ſhe
thought her Misfortunes were not exceeded by
any ſhe had ever read.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>In which a logical Argument is unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
interrupted.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE Marquis was alſo extremely uneaſy
at her Obſtinacy: He deſired nothing more
ardently than to marry her to his Nephew; but
he could not reſolve to force her Conſent; and,
however determined he appeared to her, yet,
in Reality, he intended only to uſe Perſuaſions
to effect what he deſired; and, from the natural
Sweetneſs of her Temper, he was ſometimes
not without Hopes, that ſhe might, at laſt, be
prevailed upon to comply.</p>
               <p>His Nephew's Return reſtored him to Part of
his uſual Tranquillity: After he had gently chid
him for ſuffering himſelf to be ſo far tranſported
with his Reſentment at the little Humours of a
Lady, as to leave his Houſe, without acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, he bid him go to <hi>Arabella,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to make his Peace with her.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> accordingly went to her Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
reſolving to oblige her to come to ſome
Explanation with him concerning the Offence
ſhe complained of; but that fair incenſed Lady,
who had taken Shelter in her Cloſet, ordered
<hi>Lucy</hi> to tell him ſhe was indiſpoſed, and could
not ſee him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Glanville,</hi> however, comforted himſelf for
this Diſappointment by the Hopes of ſeeing her
at Supper; and accordingly ſhe came, when the
Supper-Bell rung, and, making a very cool Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment
to her Couſin, placed herſelf at Table:
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0005700701:77"/>
The ſoft Languor that appeared in her Eyes,
gave ſuch an additional Charm to one of the
lovelieſt Faces in the World, that <hi>Glanville,</hi>
who ſat oppoſite to her, could not help gazing
on her with a very particular Attention; he
often ſpoke to her, and aſked her trifling Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
for the ſake of hearing the Sound of her
Voice, which Sorrow had made inchantingly
ſweet.</p>
               <p>When Supper was over, ſhe would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired;
but the Marquis deſired her to ſtay and
entertain her Couſin, while he went to look over
ſome Diſpatches he had received from <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella</hi> bluſhed with Anger at this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
but, not daring to diſobey, ſhe kept her
Eyes fixed on the Ground, as if ſhe dreaded to
hear ſomething that would diſpleaſe her.</p>
               <p>Well, Couſin, ſaid <hi>Glanville,</hi> tho' you deſire
to have no Empire over ſo unworthy a Subject
as myſelf, yet I hope you are not diſpleaſed at
my returning, in Obedience to your Commands.</p>
               <p>Since I am not allowed any Will of my own,
ſaid ſhe, ſighing, it matters not whether I am
pleaſed, or diſpleaſed; nor is it of any Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
to you to know.</p>
               <p>Indeed but it is, Lady <hi>Bella,</hi> interrupted he;
for if I knew how to pleaſe you, I would never,
if I could help it, offend: Therefore, I beg you,
tell me how I have diſobliged you; for, certainly,
you have treated me as harſhly as if I had been
guilty of ſome very terrible Offence.</p>
               <p>You had the Boldneſs, ſaid ſhe, to talk to
me of Love; and you well know that Perſons
of my Sex and Quality are not permitted to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0005700701:78"/>
liſten to ſuch Diſcourſes; and if, for that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
I baniſhed you my Preſence, I did no
more than Decency required of me; and which
I would yet do, were I Miſtreſs of my own
Actions.</p>
               <p>But is it poſſible, Couſin, ſaid <hi>Glanville,</hi> that
you can be angry with any one for loving you?
Is that a Crime of ſo high a Nature as to merit
an eternal Baniſhment from your Preſence?</p>
               <p>Without telling you, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> bluſhing,
whether I am angry at being loved, 'tis ſufficient
you know, that I will not pardon the Man who
ſhall have the Preſumption to tell me he loves me.</p>
               <p>But, Madam, interrupted <hi>Glanville,</hi> if the
Perſon who tells you he loves you, be of a
Rank not beneath you, I conceive you are not
at all injured by the favourable Sentiments he
feels for you; and, tho' you are not diſpoſed to
make any Returns to his Paſſion, yet you are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
obliged to him for his good Opinion.</p>
               <p>Since Love is not voluntary, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi>
I am not obliged to any Perſon for loving me;
for, queſtionleſs, if he could help it, he would.</p>
               <p>If it is not a voluntary Favour, interrupted
<hi>Glanville,</hi> it is not a voluntary Offence; and, if
you do not think yourſelf obliged by the one,
neither are you at Liberty to be offended with
the other.</p>
               <p>The Queſtion, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> is not whether
I ought to be offended at being loved, but
whether it is not an Offence to be told I am ſo.</p>
               <p>If there is nothing criminal in the Paſſion it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
Madam, reſumed <hi>Glanville,</hi> certainly there
can be no Crime in declaring it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:0005700701:79"/>
However ſpecious your Arguments may appear,
interrupted <hi>Arabella,</hi> I am perſuaded it is an
unpardonable Crime to tell a Lady you love
her; and, tho' I had nothing elſe to plead, yet
the Authority of Cuſtom is ſufficient to prove it.</p>
               <p>Cuſtom, Lady <hi>Bella,</hi> ſaid <hi>Glanville,</hi> ſmiling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
is wholly on my Side; for the Ladies are ſo far
from being diſpleaſed at the Addreſſes of their
Lovers, that their chiefeſt Care is to gain them,
and their greateſt Triumph to hear them talk of
their Paſſion: So, Madam, I hope you'll allow
that Argument has no Force.</p>
               <p>I don't know, anſwered <hi>Arabella,</hi> what Sort
of Ladies there are who allow ſuch unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
Liberties, but I am certain, that <hi>Statira,
Pariſatis, Clelia, Mandana,</hi> and all the illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Heroines of Antiquity, whom it is a Glory
to reſemble, would never admit of ſuch Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes.</p>
               <p>Ah for Heaven's ſake, Couſin, interrupted
<hi>Glanville,</hi> endeavouring to ſtifle a Laugh, do not
ſuffer yourſelf to be governed by ſuch antiquated
Maxims! The World is quite different to what
it was in thoſe Days; and the Ladies in this
Age would as ſoon follow the Faſhions of the
<hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Ladies, as mimick their
Manners; and I believe they would become one
as ill as the other.</p>
               <p>I am ſure, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> the World is not
more virtuous now than it was in their Days,
and there is good Reaſon to believe it is not
much wiſer; and I don't ſee why the Manners
of this Age are to be preferred to thoſe of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
ones, unleſs they are wiſer and better:
However, I cannot be perſuaded, that Things
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0005700701:80"/>
are as you ſay, and that when I am a little better
acquainted with the World, I ſhall find as many
Perſons who reſemble <hi>Oroondates, Artaxerxes,</hi>
and the illuſtrious Lovers of <hi>Clelia,</hi> as thoſe
who are like <hi>Tiribaſes, Artaxes,</hi> and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming
and inſolent <hi>Glanville.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the Epithets you give me Madam, ſaid
<hi>Glanville,</hi> I find you have placed me in very
bad Company: But pray, Madam, if the
illuſtrious Lover of <hi>Clelia</hi> had never diſcovered
his Paſſion, how would the World have come
to the Knowledge of it?</p>
               <p>He did not diſcover his Paſſion, Sir, reſumed
<hi>Arabella,</hi> till, by the Services he did the noble
<hi>Clelius,</hi> and his incomparable Daughter, he
could plead ſome Title to their Eſteem: He ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
times preſerved the Life of that renowned
<hi>Roman;</hi> delivered the beautiful <hi>Clelia</hi> when
ſhe was a Captive; and, in fine, conferred ſo
many Obligations upon them, and all their
Friends, as he might well expect to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
by the divine <hi>Clelia</hi> for daring to love
her. Nevertheleſs, ſhe uſed him very harſhly,
when he firſt declared his Paſſion, and baniſhed
him alſo from her Preſence; and it was a long
time before ſhe could prevail upon herſelf to
compaſſionate his Sufferings.</p>
               <p>The Marquis coming in interrupted <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella;</hi>
upon which ſhe took Occaſion to retire;
leaving <hi>Glanville</hi> more captivated with her than
ever.</p>
               <p>He found her Uſage of him was grounded
upon Examples ſhe thought it her Duty to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
and, ſtrange as her Notions of Life ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
yet they were ſupported with ſo much
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0005700701:81"/>
Wit and Delicacy, that he could not help ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring
her, while he foreſaw, the Oddity of her
Humour would throw innumerable Difficulties
in his Way, before he ſhould be able to obtain
her.</p>
               <p>However, as he was really paſſionately in
Love with her, he reſolved to accommodate
himſelf, as much as poſſible, to her Taſte, and
endeavour to gain her Heart by a Behaviour
moſt agreeable to her: He therefore aſſumed an
Air of great Diſtance and Reſpect; never men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
his Affection, nor the Intentions of her
Father in his Favour; and the Marquis, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
his Daughter converſed with him with
leſs Reluctance than uſual, leaving to Time,
and the Merit of his Nephew, to diſpoſe her to
comply with his Deſires, reſolved not to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
his Authority in an Affair upon which her
own Happineſs ſo much depended.</p>

                  <hi>ARABELLA</hi> ſaw the Change in her
Couſin's Behaviour with a great deal of
Satisfaction; for ſhe did not doubt but his Paſſion
was as ſtrong as ever; but that he forbore,
thro' Reſpect, from entertaining her with any
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0005700701:82"/>
Expreſſions of it: Therefore ſhe now converſed
with him with the greateſt Sweetneſs and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance:
She would walk with him for ſeveral
Hours in the Garden, leaning upon his Arm;
and charmed him to the laſt Degree of Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by the agreeable Sallies of her Wit, and
her fine Reaſoning upon every Subject he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
               <p>It was with the greateſt Difficulty he reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himſelf from telling her a Thouſand times a
Day that he loved her to Exceſs, and conjuring
her to give her Conſent to her Father's Deſigns
in his Favour: But, tho' he could get over
his Fears of offending her, yet it was impoſſible
to expreſs any Sentiments of this Nature to her,
without having her Women Witneſſes of his
Diſcourſe; for, when he walked with her in
the Garden, <hi>Lucy,</hi> and another Attendant, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
followed her: If he ſat with her in her
own Chamber, her Women were always at one
End of it: And, when they were both in the
Marquis's Apartment, where her Women did
not follow her, poor <hi>Glanville</hi> found himſelf
embarraſſed by his Preſence; for, conceiving
his Nephew had Opportunities enough of talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

of their Converſation.</p>
               <p>He paſſed ſome Weeks in this Manner, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
chagrined at the little Progreſs he made;
and was beginning to be heartily weary of the
Conſtraint he laid upon himſelf, when <hi>Arabella,</hi>
one Day, furniſhed him, without deſigning it,
with an Opportunity of talking to her on the

                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:0005700701:83"/>
When I reflect, ſaid ſhe, laughing, upon the
Difference there was between us ſome Days
ago, and the Familiarity in which we live at
preſent, I cannot imagine by what means you
have arrived to a good Fortune you had ſo little
Reaſon to expect; for, in fine, you have given
me no Signs of Repentance for the Fault you
committed, which moved me to baniſh you;
and I am not certain whether, in converſing
with you in the manner I do, I give you not as
much Reaſon to find Fault with my too great
Eaſineſs, as you did me to be diſpleaſed with
your Preſumption.</p>
               <p>Since, returned <hi>Glanville,</hi> I have not perſiſted
in the Commiſſion of thoſe Faults which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed
you, what greater Signs of Repentance
can you deſire, than this Reformation in my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour?</p>
               <p>But Repentance ought to precede Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
replied <hi>Arabella;</hi> otherwiſe, there is great
room to ſuſpect it is only feigned: And a ſincere
Repentance ſhews itſelf in ſuch viſible Marks,
that one can hardly be deceived in that which is
genuine. I have read of many indiſcreet Lovers,
who not ſucceeding in their Addreſſes, have
pretended to repent, and acted as you do; that
is, without giving any Signs of Contrition for
the Fault they had committed, have eat and
ſlept well, never loſt their Colour, or grew one
bit thinner, by their Sorrow; but contented
themſelves with ſaying they repented; and,
without changing thetr Diſpoſition to renew
their Fault, only concealed their Intention, for
fear of loſing any favourable Opportunity of
committing it again: But true Repentance, as
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0005700701:84"/>
I was ſaying, not only produces Reformation,
but the Perſon who is poſſeſſed of it voluntarily
puniſhes himſelf for the Faults he has been
guilty of. Thus <hi>Mazares,</hi> deeply repenting of
the Crime his Paſſion for the divine <hi>Manda<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>a</hi>
had forced him to commit; as a Puniſhment,
obliged himſelf to follow the Fortune of his
glorious Rival; obey all his Commands; and,
fighting under his Banners, aſſist him to gain
the Poſſeſſion of his adored Miſtreſs. Such a
glorious Inſtance of Self-denial was, indeed, a
ſufficient Proof of his Repentance; and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
more convincing than the Silence he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
upon himſelf with reſpect to his Paſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oroondates,</hi> to puniſh himſelf for his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
in daring to tell the admirable <hi>Statira,</hi>
that he loved her, reſolved to die, to expiate
his Crime; and, doubtleſs, would have done ſo,
if his fair Miſtreſs, at the Intreaty of her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
had not commanded him to live.</p>
               <p>But pray, Lady <hi>Bella,</hi> interrupted <hi>Glanville,</hi>
were not theſe Gentlemen happy at laſt in the
Poſſeſſion of their Miſtreſſes?</p>
               <p>Doubtleſs they were, Sir, reſumed ſhe; but
it was not till after numberleſs Misfortunes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Services, and many dangerous Adventures,
in which their Fidelity was put to the ſtrongeſt
Trials imaginable.</p>
               <p>I am glad, however, ſaid <hi>Glanville,</hi> that the
Ladies were not inſenſible; for, ſince you do
not diſapprove of their Compaſſion for their
Lovers, it is to be hoped you will not be always
as inexorable as you are now.</p>
               <p>When I ſhall be ſo fortunate, interrupted ſhe,
to meet with a Lover who ſhall have as pure
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0005700701:85"/>
and perfect a Paſſion for me, as <hi>Oroondates</hi> had
for <hi>Statira;</hi> and give me as many glorious
Proofs of his Conſtancy and Affection, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
I ſhall not be ungrateful: But, ſince I have
not the Merits of <hi>Statira,</hi> I ought not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to her good Fortune; and ſhall be very
well contented if I eſcape the Perſecutions which
Perſons of my Sex, who are not frightfully ugly,
are always expoſed to, without hoping to inſpire
ſuch a Paſſion as that of <hi>Oroondates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhould be glad to be better acquainted with
the Actions of this happy Lover, Madam, ſaid
<hi>Glanville;</hi> that, forming myſelf upon his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
I may hope to pleaſe a Lady as worthy
of my Regard as <hi>Statira</hi> was of his.</p>
               <p>For Heaven's ſake, Couſin, reſumed <hi>Arabella,</hi>
laughing, how have you ſpent your Time;
and to what Studies have you devoted all your
Hours, that you could find none to ſpare for
the Peruſal of Books from which all uſeful
Knowledge may be drawn; which give us the
moſt ſhining Examples of Generoſity, Courage,
Virtue, and Love; which regulate our Actions,
form our Manners, and inſpire us with a noble
Deſire of emulating thoſe great, heroic, and
virtuous Actions, which made thoſe Perſons ſo
glorious in their Age, and ſo worthy Imitation
in ours? However, as it is never too late to
improve, ſuffer me to recommend to you the
reading of theſe Books, which will ſoon make
you diſcover the Improprieties you have been
guilty of; and will, probably, induce you to
avoid them for the future.</p>
               <p>I ſhall certainly read them, if you deſire it,
ſaid <hi>Glanville;</hi> and I have ſo great an Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0005700701:86"/>
to be agreeable to you, that I ſhall em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
every Opportunity of becoming ſo; and
will therefore take my Inſtructions from theſe
Books, if you think proper, or from yourſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which, indeed, will be the quickeſt Method of
teaching me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella</hi> having ordered one of her Women
to bring <hi>Cleopatra, Caſſandra, Clelia,</hi> and the
Grand <hi>Cyrus,</hi> from her Library, <hi>Glanville</hi> no
ſooner ſaw the Girl return, ſinking under the
Weight of thoſe voluminous Romances, but he
began to tremble at the Apprehenſion of his
Couſin laying her Commands upon him to read
them; and repented of his Complaiſance, which
expoſed him to the cruel Neceſſity of performing
what to him appeared an <hi>Herculean</hi> Labour, or
elſe incurring her Anger by his Refuſal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> making her Women place the Books
upon a Table before her, opened them, one
after another, with Eyes ſparkling with Delight;
while <hi>Glanville</hi> ſat rapt in Admiration at the
Sight of ſo many huge Folio's, written, as he
conceived, upon the moſt trifling Subjects
imaginable.</p>
               <p>I have choſen out theſe few, ſaid <hi>Arabella</hi>
(not obſerving his Conſternation) from a great
many others, which compoſe the moſt valuable
Part of my Library; and, by that time you
have gone thro' theſe, I imagine you will be
conſiderably improved.</p>
               <p>Certainly, Madam, replied <hi>Glanville,</hi> turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over the Leaves in great Confuſion, one
may, as you ſay, be greatly improved; for theſe
Books contain a great deal: And, looking over
a Page of <hi>Caſſandra,</hi> without any Deſign, read
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0005700701:87"/>
theſe Words, which were Part of <hi>Oroondates</hi>'s
Soliloquy when he received a cruel Sentence
from <hi>Statira:</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>Ah cruel! ſays this miſerable Lover, and
what have I done to merit it? Examine the
Nature of my Offence, and you will ſee I am
not ſo guilty, but that my Death may free me
from Part of that Severity: Shall your Hatred
laſt longer than my Life? And can you deteſt
a Soul that forſakes its Body only to obey
you? No, no, you are not ſo hard-hearted;
that Satisfaction will, doubtleſs, content you:
And, when I ſhall ceaſe to be, doubtleſs I
ſhall ceaſe to be odious to you.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Upon my Soul, ſaid <hi>Glanville,</hi> ſtifling a
Laugh with great Difficulty, I cannot help
blaming the Lady this ſorrowful Lover com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
of, for her great Cruelty; for here he
gives one Reaſon to ſuſpect, that ſhe will not
even be contented with his dying in Obedience
to her Commands, but will hate him after
Death; an Impiety quite inexcuſable in a
Chriſtian!</p>
               <p>You condemn this illuſtrious Princeſs with
very little Reaſon, interrupted <hi>Arabella,</hi> ſmiling
at his Miſtake; for, beſides that ſhe was not a
Chriſtian, and ignorant of thoſe Divine Maxims
of Charity and Forgiveneſs, which Chriſtians,
by their Profeſſion, are obliged to practiſe, ſhe
was very far from deſiring the Death of <hi>Oroon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates;</hi>
for, if you will take the Pains to read
the ſucceeding Paſſages, you will find that ſhe
expreſſes herſelf in the moſt obliging Manner in
the World; for when <hi>Oroondates</hi> tells her he
would live, if ſhe would conſent he ſhould, the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0005700701:88"/>
Princeſs moſt ſweetly replies,<q> I not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
but alſo intreat it; and, if I have any
Power, command it.</q> However, leſt you
ſhould fall into the other Extreme, and blame
this great Princeſs for her Eaſineſs (as you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
condemned her for her Cruelty), 'tis neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
you ſhould know how ſhe was induced to
this favourable Behaviour to her Lover: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
pray read the whole Tranſaction. Stay!
here it begins, continued ſhe; turning over a
good many Pages, and marking where he ſhould
begin to read.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Glanville,</hi> having no great Stomach to the
Taſk, endeavoured to evade it, by intreating
his Couſin to relate the Paſſages ſhe deſired he
ſhould be acquainted with: But ſhe declining it,
he was obliged to obey; and began to read
where ſhe directed him: And, to leave him at
Liberty to read with the greater Attention, ſhe
left him, and went to a Window at another
End of the Chamber.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> who was not willing to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe
her, examined the Taſk ſhe had ſet him,
reſolving, if it was not a very hard one, to
comply; but, counting the Pages, he was quite
terrified at the Number, and could not prevail
upon himſelf to read them: Therefore, glancing
them over, he pretended to be deeply engaged
in reading, when, in Reality, he was contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating
the ſurpriſing Effect theſe Books had
produced in the Mind of his Couſin; who,
had ſhe been untainted with the ridiculous
Whims they created in her Imagination, was,
in his Opinion, one of the moſt accompliſhed
Ladies in the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:0005700701:89"/>
When he had ſat long enough to make her
believe he had read what ſhe had deſired, he
roſe up, and, joining her at the Window, began
to talk of the Pleaſantneſs of the Evening, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of the Rigour of <hi>Statira.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella</hi> coloured with Vexation at his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
Indifference in a Matter which was of
ſuch prodigious Conſequence, in her Opinion;
but diſdaining to put him in mind of his Rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
in quitting a Subject they had not
thoroughly diſcuſſed, and which ſhe had taken
ſo much Pains to make him comprehend, ſhe
continued ſilent; and would not condeſcend to
afford him an Anſwer to any thing he ſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Glanville,</hi> by her Silence and Frowns, was
made ſenſible of his Fault; and, to repair it,
began to talk of the inexorable <hi>Statira,</hi> though,
indeed, he did not well know what to ſay.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> clearing up a little, did not diſdain
to anſwer him upon her favourite Topic: I
knew, ſaid ſhe, you would be ready to blame
this Princeſs equally for her Rigour and her
Kindneſs; but it muſt be remembred that,
what ſhe did in Favour of <hi>Oroondates,</hi> was
wholly owing to the Generoſity of <hi>Artaxerxes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here ſhe ſtopped, expecting <hi>Glanville</hi> to give
his Opinion; who, ſtrangely puzzled, replied
at random, To be ſure, Madam, he was a very
generous Rival.</p>
               <p>Rival! cried <hi>Arabella; Artaxerxes</hi> the Rival
of <hi>Oroondates!</hi> Why certainly you have loſt your
Wits: He was <hi>Statira</hi>'s Brother; and it was to
his Mediation that <hi>Oroondates,</hi> or <hi>Orontes,</hi> owed

Certainly, Madam, replied <hi>Glanville,</hi> it was
very generous in <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> as he was Brother
to <hi>Statira,</hi> to interpoſe in the Behalf of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
Lover; and both <hi>Oroondates,</hi> and
<hi>Orontes,</hi> were extremely obliged to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Orontes,</hi> replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> was more obliged
to him than <hi>Oroondates;</hi> ſince the Quality of
<hi>Orontes</hi> was infinitely below that of <hi>Oroondates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, Madam, interrupted <hi>Glanville</hi> (extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pleaſed at his having ſo well got over the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
he had been in), which of theſe two
Lovers did <hi>Statira</hi> make happy?</p>
               <p>This unlucky Queſtion immediately informed
<hi>Arabella,</hi> that ſhe had been all this time the
Dupe of her Couſin; who, if he had read a
ſingle Page, would have known that <hi>Orontes</hi>
and <hi>Oroondates</hi> was the ſame Perſon; the Name
of <hi>Orontes</hi> being aſſumed by <hi>Oroondates,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
his real Name and Quality.</p>
               <p>The Shame and Rage ſhe conceived at ſo
glaring a Proof of his Diſreſpect, and the Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule
to which ſhe had expoſed herſelf, were ſo
great, that ſhe could not find Words ſevere
enough to expreſs her Reſentment; but, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting
that no Conſideration whatever ſhould
oblige her to converſe with him again, ſhe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
him inſtantly to quit her Chamber;
and aſſured him, if he ever attempted to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
her again, ſhe would ſubmit to the moſt
terrible Effects of her Father's Reſentment, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than be obliged to ſee a Perſon who had,
by his unworthy Behaviour, made himſelf her
Scorn and Averſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Glanville,</hi> who ſaw himſelf going to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carded
a ſecond time, attempted, with great
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0005700701:91"/>
Submiſſion, to move her to recal her cruel
Sentence; but <hi>Arabella,</hi> burſting into Tears,
complained ſo pathetically of the Cruelty of her
Deſtiny, in expoſing her to the hated Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
of a Man ſhe deſpiſed, and whoſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
was ſo inſupportable, that <hi>Glanville,</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it beſt to let her Rage evaporate before he
attempted to pacify her, quitted her Chamber;
curſing <hi>Statira</hi> and <hi>Orontes</hi> a thouſand times,
and loading the Authors of thoſe Books with all
the Imprecations his Rage could ſuggeſt.</p>

                  <p>The Adventure of the Books continued.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN this Temper he went to the Gardens to
paſs over the Chagrin this unfortunate Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
had given him; when, meeting the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis,
who inſiſted upon knowing the Cauſe of
that ill Humour, ſo viſible in his Countenance,
<hi>Glanville</hi> related all that had paſſed; but, in
Spite of his Anger, it was impoſſible for him
to repeat the Circumſtances of his Diſgrace
without laughing, as well as the Marquis; who
thought the Story ſo extremely diverting, that
he would needs hear it over again.</p>
               <p>However, <hi>Charles,</hi> ſaid he, though I ſhall do
what I can to gain your Pardon from <hi>Bella,</hi> yet
I ſhall not ſcruple to own you acted extremely
wrong, in not reading what ſhe deſired you;
for, beſides loſing an Opportunity of obliging
her, you drew yourſelf into a terrible Dilemma;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0005700701:92"/>
for how was it poſſible for you to evade a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of the Cheat you put upon her, when
ſhe began to talk with you upon thoſe Paſſages
ſhe had deſired you to read?</p>
               <p>I acknowledge my Error, my Lord, anſwered
<hi>Glanville;</hi> but if you reſtore me to my Couſin's
Favour again, I promiſe you to repair it by a
different Behaviour for the future.</p>
               <p>I'll ſee what I can do for you, ſaid the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis;
leaving him, to go to <hi>Arabella</hi>'s Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
who had retired to her Cloſet, extremely
afflicted at this new Inſult ſhe had received
from her Couſin: Her Grief was the more
poignant, as ſhe was beginning to imagine, by
the Alteration in his Behaviour, that he would
prove ſuch a Lover as ſhe wiſhed; for Mr.
<hi>Glanville</hi>'s Perſon and Qualifications had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
her particular Notice: And, to ſpeak
in the Language of Romance, ſhe did not hate
him; but, on the contrary, was very much
diſpoſed to wiſh him well: Therefore, it was no
Wonder ſhe extremely reſented the Affront ſhe
had received from him.</p>
               <p>The Marquis, not finding her in her Chamber,
proceeded to her Cloſet, where her Women
informed him ſhe was retired; and, knocking
gently at the Door, was admitted by <hi>Arabella,</hi>
whom he immediately diſcerned to have been
weeping very much; for her fine Eyes were red
and ſwelled, and the Traces of her Tears might
ſtill be obſerved on her fair Face; which, at the
Sight of the Marquis, was overſpread with a
Bluſh, as if ſhe was conſcious of her Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in lamenting the Crime her Couſin had been
guilty of.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:0005700701:93"/>
The Marquis drew a favourable Omen for his
Nephew from her Tears and Confuſion; but,
not willing to increaſe it, by acknowleging he
had obſerved it, he told her he was come, at
Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi>'s Requeſt, to make up the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
between them.</p>
               <p>Ah! my Lord, interrupted <hi>Arabella,</hi> ſpeak
no more to me of that unworthy Man, who
has ſo groſly abuſed my Favour, and the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege
I allowed him: His Baſeneſs and Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
are but too manifeſt; and there is nothing
I ſo much regret as my Weakneſs in reſtoring
him to Part of my good Opinion, after he had
once forfeited it, by an Inſolence not to be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleled.</p>
               <p>Indeed, <hi>Bella,</hi> ſaid the Marquis, ſmiling, you
reſent too deeply theſe ſlight Matters: I can't
think my Nephew ſo guilty as you would have
me believe he is; and you ought neither to be
angry or ſurpriſed, that he preferred your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
before reading in a fooliſh old-faſhioned
Book that you put in his Hands.</p>
               <p>If your Lordſhip had ever read theſe Books,
replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> reddening with Vexation, 'tis
probable you would have another Opinion of
them; but, however that may be, my Couſin is
not to be excuſed for the Contempt he ſhewed
to my Commands; and for daring, by the Cheat
he put on me, to expoſe me to the Shame of
ſeeing myſelf ſo ridiculouſly impoſed upon.</p>
               <p>However, you muſt forgive him, ſaid the
Marquis; and I inſiſt upon it, before I quit your
Apartment, that you receive him into Favour.</p>
               <p>Pardon me, my Lord, replied <hi>Arabella;</hi> this
is what I neither can, nor ought to do; and I
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0005700701:94"/>
hope you will not wrong me ſo much as to
continue to deſire it.</p>
               <p>Nay, <hi>Bella,</hi> ſaid he, this is carrying Things
too far, and making trifling Diſputes of too
great Conſequence: I am ſurpriſed at your
Treatment of a Man whom, after all, if ever
you intend to obey me, you muſt conſent to
marry.</p>
               <p>There is no Queſtion, my Lord, replied ſhe,
but it would be my Glory to obey you in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is poſſible; but this you command me now
to do, not being ſo, I conceive you will rather
impute my Refuſal to Neceſſity, than Choice.</p>
               <p>How! returned the Marquis, will you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to perſuade me, that it is not poſſible
Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> ſhould be your Huſband?</p>
               <p>'Tis impoſſible he ſhould be ſo with my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
reſumed <hi>Arabella;</hi> and I cannot give it
without wounding my own Quiet in a moſt
ſenſible manner.</p>
               <p>Come, come, <hi>Bella,</hi> ſaid the Marquis (fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
at her extreme Obſtinacy), this is too much:
I am to blame to indulge your Foibles in this
Manner: Your Couſin is worthy of your Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and you cannot refuſe it to him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
incurring my Diſpleaſure.</p>
               <p>Since my Affection is not in my own Power
to beſtow, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> weeping, I know not
how to remove your Diſpleaſure; but, queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
I know how to die, to avoid the Effects
of what would be to me the moſt terrible Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
in the World.</p>
               <p>Fooliſh Girl! interrupted the Marquis, how
ſtrangely do you talk? Are the Thoughts of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0005700701:95"/>
Death become ſo familiar to you, that you ſpeak
of dying with ſo little Concern?</p>
               <p>Since, my Lord, reſumed ſhe, in an exalted
Tone, I do not yield, either in Virtue or Courage,
to many others of my Sex, who, when perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
like me, have fled to Death for Relief, I
know not why I ſhould be thought leſs capable
of it than they; and if <hi>Artimiſa, Candace,</hi> and
the beautiful Daughter of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> could brave
the Terrors of Death for the ſake of the Men
they loved, there is no Queſtion but I alſo could
imitate their Courage, to avoid the Man I have
ſo much Reaſon to hate.</p>
               <p>The Girl is certainly diſtracted, interrupted
the Marquis, exceſſively enraged at the ſtrange
Speech ſhe had uttered: Theſe fooliſh Books my
Nephew talks of have turned her Brain! Where
are they? purſued he, going into her Chamber:
I'll burn all I can lay my Hands upon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> trembling for the Fate of her Books,
followed her Father into the Room; who ſeeing
the Books which had cauſed this woful Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
lying upon the Table, he ordered one
of her Women to carry them into his Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
vowing he would commit them all to the
Flames.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella</hi> not daring, in the Fury he was in,
to interpoſe, he went out of the Room, leaving
her to bewail the Fate of ſo many illuſtrious
Heroes and Heroines, who, by an Effect of a
more cruel Tyranny than any they had ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
before, were going to be caſt into the
mercileſs Flames; which would, doubtleſs, pay
very little Regard to the divine Beauties of the
admirable <hi>Clelia,</hi> or the heroic Valour of the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0005700701:96"/>
brave <hi>Orontes;</hi> and the reſt of thoſe great
Princes and Princeſſes, whoſe Actions <hi>Arabella</hi>
propoſed for the Model of hers.</p>
               <p>Fortune, however, which never wholly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook
theſe illuſtrious Perſonages, reſcued them
from ſo unworthy a Fate, and brought Mr.
<hi>Glanville</hi> into the Marquis's Chamber juſt as he
was giving Orders to have them deſtroyed.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THE Marquis, as ſoon as he ſaw
Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> told him he was
reſolved to cure <hi>Arabella</hi> of her
Whims, by burning the Books
that had put them into her Head:
I have ſeized upon ſome of them, purſued he,
ſmiling; and you may, if you pleaſe, wreak
your Spite upon theſe Authors of your Diſgrace,
by burning them yourſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:0005700701:98"/>
Though I have all the Reaſon in the World
to be enraged with that Incendiary <hi>Statira,</hi> ſaid
<hi>Glanville</hi> laughing, for the Miſchief ſhe has
done me; yet I cannot conſent to put ſuch an
Affront upon my Couſin, as to burn her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
Books: And now I think of it, my Lord,
purſued he, I'll endeavour to make a Merit with
Lady <hi>Bella</hi> by ſaving them: Therefore ſpare
them, at my Requeſt, and let me carry them
to her. I ſhall be quite unhappy till we are
Friends again.</p>
               <p>You may do as you will, ſaid the Marquis;
but I think it encouraging her in her Follies to
give them to her again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Glanville,</hi> without replying, eagerly took up
the Books, for fear the Marquis ſhould change
his Mind; and, highly delighted with the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
he had got of making his Peace with
Lady <hi>Bella,</hi> ran to her Apartment, loaded with
theſe kind Interceſſors; and, making his Way by
<hi>Lucy,</hi> who would have oppoſed him, penetrated
even into the Cloſet of the melancholy Fair-one,
who was making bitter Reflections on the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
of her Deſtiny, and bewailing her Loſs
with a Deluge of Tears.</p>
               <p>As ridiculous as the Occaſion of theſe Tears
was, yet <hi>Glanville</hi> could not behold them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being affected: Aſſuming, therefore, a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
as ſad as he was able, he laid the Books
before her; and told her, he hoped ſhe would
excuſe his coming into her Preſence without
her Permiſſion, ſince it was only to reſtore her
thoſe Books, whoſe Loſs ſhe ſeemed ſo greatly
to lament; and added, that it was with much
Difficulty he prevailed upon the Marquis not to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0005700701:99"/>
burn them immediately; and his Fears, that he
might really do as he threatened, made him
ſnatch them up, and bring them, with ſo little
Ceremony, into her Cloſet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> whoſe Countenance brightened into
a Smile of pleaſing Surprize at the Sight of her
recovered Treaſure, turned her bright Eyes upon
<hi>Glanville</hi> with a Look of Complacency that went
to his Heart.</p>
               <p>I well perceive, ſaid ſhe, that, in exaggera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Merit of this little Service you have done
me, you expect I ſhould ſuffer it to cancel your
paſt Offences: I am not ungrateful enough to
be inſenſible of any Kindneſs that is ſhewn me;
and, tho' I might be excuſed for ſuſpecting it
was rather Policy than Friendſhip, that induced
you to ſeek my Satisfaction, by ſaving theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
Victims of my Father's Diſpleaſure, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
I pardon you upon the Suppoſition,
that you will, for the future, avoid all Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of offending me.</p>
               <p>At theſe Words, ſhe made a Sign to him to
be gone, fearing the Extravagance of his Joy
would make him throw himſelf at her Feet to
thank her for the infinite Favour ſhe had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
upon him; but, finding he ſeemed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to ſtay longer, ſhe called one of her Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
into the Cloſet; and, by ſome very ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant
Frowns, gave <hi>Glanville</hi> to underſtand his
Stay was diſpleaſing; ſo that he left her, with a
very low Bow, highly pleaſed at her having

that nothing could have happened more
fortunate for him, than his intended Diſpoſal of

                  <p>Which contains a very natural Incident.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>FROM this Time Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> tho' he
was far from coming up to Lady <hi>Bella</hi>'s
Idea of a Lover, yet, by the Pains he apparently
ſeemed to be at in obliging her, made every
Day ſome Progreſs in her Eſteem. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
was extremely pleaſed at the Harmony
which ſubſiſted between them; tho' he could
have wiſhed to have ſeen their Marriage advance
a little faſter; but <hi>Glanville,</hi> who was better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with <hi>Arabella</hi>'s Foible than the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis,
aſſured him, he would ruin all his Hopes,
if he preſſed her to marry; and intreated him
to leave it intirely to him, to diſpoſe her to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to both their Wiſhes.</p>
               <p>The Marquis was ſatisfied with his Reaſons,
and, reſolving not to importune his Daughter,
upon that Subject, any more, they lived for
ſome Months in a perfect Tranquillity; to which
an Illneſs the Marquis was ſeized with, and
which was, from the firſt, thought to be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
gave a ſad Interruption.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella</hi>'s extreme Tenderneſs upon this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
her anxious Solicitude, her pious Cares,
and never-ceaſing Attendance at the Bedſide of
her ſick Father, were ſo many new Charms,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0005700701:101"/>
that engaged the Affection of <hi>Glanville</hi> more
ſtrongly. As the Marquis's Indiſpoſition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed,
ſo did her Care and Affiduity: She would
not allow any one to give him any thing but her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
bore all the pettiſh Humours of a ſick Man
with a ſurpriſing Sweetneſs and Patience; watched
whole Nights, ſucceſſively, by his Bedſide; and
when, at his Importunity, ſhe conſented to take
any Reſt, it was only upon a Couch in his
Chamber, from whence no Intreaties could
make her remove. Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> partook with
her in theſe Fatigues; and, by his Care of her
Father, and Tenderneſs for her, confirmed her
in the Eſteem ſhe had entertained of him.</p>
               <p>The Marquis, who had ſtruggled with the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
of his Diſtemper for a Fortnight, died
on the Fifteenth Day in the Arms of <hi>Arabella,</hi>
who received his laſt Looks; his Eyes never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
themſelves from her Face, till they were
cloſed by Death. Her Spirits, which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
ſhe had of being uſeful to him, had alone
ſupported, now failed her at once; and ſhe fell
upon the Bed, without Senſe or Motion, as ſoon
as ſhe ſaw him expire.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> who was kneeling on the other
Side, and had been holding one of his Uncle's
Hands, ſtarted up in the moſt terrible Conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and, ſeeing the Condition ſhe was in,
flew to her Relief: Her Women, while he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
her, uſed all the Endeavours they could
think of to recover her; but ſhe continued ſo
long in her Swoon, that they apprehended ſhe
was dead; and <hi>Glanville</hi> was reſigning himſelf
up to the moſt bitter Sorrow, when ſhe opened
her Eyes; but it was only to cloſe them again.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0005700701:102"/>
Her Faintings continued the whole Day; and
the Phyſicians declaring ſhe was in great Danger,
from her extreme Weakneſs, ſhe was carried
to Bed in a Condition that ſeemed to promiſe
very little Hopes of her Life.</p>
               <p>The Care of the Marquis's Funeral devolving
upon Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> he ſent a Meſſenger expreſs
for his Father, who was appointed Guardian
to Lady <hi>Bella;</hi> the Marquis having firſt aſked
her if ſhe was willing it ſhould be ſo. This
Gentleman arrived Time enough to be Witneſs
of that ſad Ceremony, which was performed
with a Magnificence ſuitable to the Birth and
Fortune of the Marquis.</p>
               <p>Lady <hi>Bella</hi> kept her Bed ſeveral Days, and
her Life was thought to be in Danger; but her
Youth, and the Strength of her Conſtitution,
overcame her Diſeaſe; and, when ſhe was ſo
well recovered as to be able to admit of a Viſit
from her Uncle, Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> ſent for Permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

granted his Requeſt; but, being then more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed

their Viſit for an Hour or two, which they
complied with; and, returning at the appointed
Time, were conducted into her Dreſſing-Room
by <hi>Lucy,</hi> who informed them her Lady was juſt

               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> who had not ſeen her for

that they never offered to diſturb her. Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Fate! ſaid ſhe, in the moſt moving Tone
imaginable, Cruel Deſtiny! that, not contented
with having deprived my Infancy of the ſoft
Cares, and tender Indulgences, of a Mother's
Fondneſs, has robbed me of the only Parent I
had left, and expoſed me, at theſe early Years,
to the Grief of loſing him, who was not only
my Father, but my Friend, and Protector of
my Youth!</p>
               <p>Then, pauſing a Moment, ſhe renewed her
Complaints with a deep Sigh: Dear Relics of
the beſt of Fathers! purſued ſhe, Why was it
not permitted me to bathe you with my Tears?
Why were thoſe ſacred Remains of him, from
whom I drew my Life, ſnatched from my Eyes,
ere they had poured their Tribute of Sorrow
over them? Ah! pitileſs Women! ſaid ſhe to
her Attendants, you prevented me from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
the laſt pious Rites to my dear Father!
You, by your cruel Care, hindered me from
eaſing my ſad Heart, by paying him the laſt
Duties he could receive from me! Pardon, O
dear and ſacred Shade of my loved Father!
pardon this unwilling Neglect of thy afflicted
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0005700701:104"/>
Child, who, to the laſt Moment of her wretched
Life, will bewail thy Loſs!</p>
               <p>Here ſhe ceaſed ſpeaking; and Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi>
whom this Soliloquy had much leſs confounded
than his Father, was preparing to go in, and
comfort her; when the old Gentleman ſtopping
him with a Look of great Concern: My Niece
is certainly much worſe than we apprehend,
ſaid he: She is in a Delirium: Our Preſence may,
perhaps, diſcompoſe her too much.</p>
               <p>No, Sir, replied <hi>Glanville,</hi> extremely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
at this Suſpicion; my Couſin is not ſo bad
as you ſuppoſe: It is common enough for Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in any great Affliction to eaſe themſelves by
Complaints.</p>
               <p>But theſe, replied the Knight, are the ſtrangeſt
Complaints I ever heard, and ſavour ſo much of
Phrenſy, that I am perſuaded her Head is not
quite right.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Glanville</hi> was going to reply, when <hi>Lucy,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering,
told them her Lady had ordered their
Admiſſion: Upon which they followed her into
<hi>Arabella</hi>'s Chamber, who was lying negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
upon her Bed.</p>
               <p>Her deep Mourning, and the black Gawſe,
which covered Part of her fair Face, was ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
to her Shape and Complexion, that
Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> who had not ſeen her ſince ſhe grew
up, was ſtruck with an extreme Surprize at her
Beauty, while his Son was gazing on her ſo
paſſionately, that he never thought of introducing
his Father to her, who contemplated her with
as much Admiration as his Son, though with leſs
Paſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:0005700701:105"/>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> riſing from her Bed, ſaluted her
Uncle with a Grace that wholly charmed him;
and, turning to receive Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> ſhe burſt
into Tears at the Remembrance of his having
aſſiſted her in her laſt Attendance upon her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Alas! Sir, ſaid ſhe, when we ſaw each
other laſt, we were both engaged, in a very
melancholy Office: Had it pleaſed Heaven to
have ſpared my Father, he would, doubtleſs,
have been extremely ſenſible of your generous
Cares; nor ſhall you have any Reaſon to accuſe
me of Ingratitude, ſince I ſhall always acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
your Kindneſs as I ought.</p>
               <p>If you think you owe me any Obligation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
<hi>Glanville,</hi> pay me, deareſt Couſin, by
moderating your Sorrow: Indeed your ſuffer
yourſelf to ſink too much under an Affliction
which is impoſſible to be remedied.</p>
               <p>Alas! anſwered <hi>Arabella,</hi> my Grief is very
ſlight, compared to that of many others upon
the Death of their Relations: The Great <hi>Syſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gambis,</hi>
who, queſtionleſs, wanted neither For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
nor Courage, upon the News of her
Grand-daughter's Death, wrapt herſelf up in her
Veil; and, reſolving never more to behold the
Light, waited for Death in that Poſture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Menecrates,</hi> upon the Loſs of his Wife, built
a magnificent Tomb for her; and, ſhutting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
up in it, reſolved to paſs away the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of his Life with her Aſhes. Theſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
were glorious Effects of Piety and Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and unfeigned Signs of an exceſſive Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row:
What are the few Tears I ſhed to ſuch
illuſtrious Inſtances of Grief and Affection, as
theſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:0005700701:106"/>
                  <hi>Glanville,</hi> finding his Couſin upon this Strain,
bluſhed extremely, and would have changed the
Subject; but the old Gentleman, who had never
heard of theſe two Perſons ſhe mentioned, who
expreſſed their Sorrow for their Loſſes in ſo
ſtrange a Manner, was ſurpriſed at it; and was
reſolved to know more about them.</p>
               <p>Pray, Niece, ſaid he, were you acquainted
with theſe People, who could not ſubmit to the
Diſpenſation of Providence, but, as one may
ſay, flew in the Face of Heaven by their Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience?</p>
               <p>I am very well acquainted with their Hiſtory,
reſumed <hi>Arabella;</hi> and I can aſſure you, they
were both very admirable Perſons.</p>
               <p>Oh! Oh! their Hiſtory! interrupted the
Knight! What, I warrant you, they are to be
found in the <hi>Fairy Tales,</hi> and thoſe ſort of Books!
Well, I never could like ſuch Romances, not
I; for they only ſpoil Youth, and put ſtrange
Notions into their Heads.</p>
               <p>I am ſorry, reſumed <hi>Arabella,</hi> bluſhing with
Anger, that we are like to differ in Opinion
upon ſo important a Point.</p>
               <p>Truly, Niece, ſaid Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> if we never
differ in any thing elſe, I ſhall be very eaſy about
this ſlight Matter; tho' I think a young Lady
of your fine Senſe (for my Son praiſes you to
the Skies for your <hi>Wit</hi>) ſhould not be ſo fond
of ſuch ridiculous Nonſenſe as theſe Story-Books
are filled with.</p>
               <p>Upon my Word, reſumed <hi>Arabella,</hi> all the
Reſpect I owe you cannot hinder me from tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you, that I take it extremely ill you ſhould,
in my Preſence, rail at the fineſt Productions in
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0005700701:107"/>
the World: I think, we are infinitely obliged
to theſe Authors, who have, in ſo ſublime a Style,
delivered down to Poſterity the heroic Actions
of the braveſt Men, and moſt virtuous of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:
But for the inimitable Pen of the famous
<hi>Scudery,</hi> we had been ignorant of the Lives of
many great and illuſtrious Perſons: The war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Actions of <hi>Oroondates, Aronces, Juba,</hi> and
the renowned <hi>Artaban,</hi> had, haply, never been
talked of in our Age; and thoſe fair and chaſte
Ladies, who were the Objects of their pure and
conſtant Paſſions, had ſtill been buried in Obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
and neither their divine Beauties, or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Virtue, been the Subject of our Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Praiſe. But for the famous <hi>Scudery,</hi>
we had not known the true Cauſe of that Action
of <hi>Clelia</hi>'s, for which the Senate decreed her a
Statue; namely, Her caſting herſelf, with an
unparalleled Courage, into the <hi>Tyber,</hi> a deep
and rapid River, as you muſt certainly know,
and ſwimming to the other Side. It was not, as
the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtorians falſly report, a Stratagem to
recover herſelf, and the other Hoſtages, from the
Power of <hi>Porſena;</hi> it was to preſerve her Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
from Violation by the impious <hi>Sextus,</hi>
who was in the Camp. But for <hi>Scudery,</hi> we had
ſtill thought the inimitable Poeteſs <hi>Sappho</hi> to be
a looſe Wanton, whoſe Verſes breathed nothing
but unchaſte and irregular Fires: On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
ſhe was ſo remarkably chaſte, that ſhe
would never even conſent to marry; but, loving
<hi>Phaon,</hi> only with a Platonic Paſſion, obliged
him to reſtrain his Deſires within the Compaſs
of a Brother's Affection. Numberleſs are the
Miſtakes he has cleared up of this Kind; and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0005700701:108"/>
I queſtion, if any other Hiſtorian, but himſelf,
knew that <hi>Cleopatra</hi> was really married to <hi>Julius
Caeſar;</hi> or that <hi>Caeſario,</hi> her Son by this Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
was not murdered, as was ſuppoſed, by
the Order of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> but married the fair
Queen of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> in whoſe Dominions he took
Refuge. The prodigious Acts of Valour, which
he has recounted of thoſe accompliſhed Princes,
have never been equalled by the Heroes of either
the <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtorians: How poor and
inſignificant are the Actions of their Warriors
to <hi>Scudery</hi>'s, where one of thoſe admirable He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes
would put whole Armies into Terror, and
with his ſingle Arm oppoſe a Legion!</p>
               <p>Indeed, Niece, ſaid Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> no longer
able to forbear interrupting her, theſe are all
very improbable Tales. I remember, when I
was a Boy, I was very fond of reading the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
of <hi>Jack the Giant killer,</hi> and <hi>Tom Thumb;</hi>
and theſe Stories ſo filled my Head, that I really
thought one of thoſe little Heroes killed Men an
hundred Feet high; and that the other, after a
great many ſurpriſing Exploits, was ſwallowed
up by a Cow.</p>
               <p>You was very young, Sir, you ſay, interrupted
<hi>Arabella</hi> tartly, when thoſe Stories gained your
Belief: However, your Judgment was certainly
younger, if you ever believed them at all; for
as credulous as you are pleaſed to think me, I
ſhould never, at any Age, have been perſuaded
ſuch Things could have happened.</p>
               <p>My Father, Madam, ſaid <hi>Glanville,</hi> who
was ſtrangely confuſed all this Time, bore Arms
in his Youth; and Soldiers, you know, never
trouble themſelves much with reading.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:0005700701:109"/>
Has my Uncle been a Soldier, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi>
and does he hold in Contempt the Actions of
the braveſt Soldiers in the World?</p>
               <p>The Soldiers you ſpeak of, Niece, ſaid Sir
<hi>Charles,</hi> were indeed the braveſt Soldiers in
the World; for I don't believe, they ever had
their Equals.</p>
               <p>And yet, Sir, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> there are a great
Number of ſuch Soldiers to be found in <hi>Scudery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed, my dear Niece, interrupted Sir <hi>Charles,</hi>
they are to be found no-where elſe, except in
your Imagination, which, I am ſorry to ſee, is
filled with ſuch <hi>Whimſies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you mean this to affront me, Sir, reſumed
<hi>Arabella,</hi> hardly able to forbear Tears, I know
how far, as my Uncle, I ought to bear with
you: But, methinks, it is highly unkind to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate
my Sorrows by ſuch cruel Jeſts; and,
ſince I am not in an Humour to ſuffer them,
don't take it ill, if I intreat you to leave me to
myſelf.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> who knew nothing pleaſed his
Couſin ſo much as paying an exact Obedience
to her Commands, roſe up immediately; and,
bowing reſpectfully to her, aſked his Father, If
he ſhould attend him into the Gardens?</p>
               <p>The Baronet, who thought <hi>Arabella</hi>'s Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
bordered a good deal upon Rudeneſs, took
his Leave with ſome Signs of Diſpleaſure upon
his Countenance; and, notwithſtanding all his
Son could ſay in Excuſe for her, he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
offended.</p>
               <p>What, ſaid he, to Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> does ſhe
ſo little underſtand the Reſpect that is due to me
as her Uncle, that ſhe, ſo peremptorily, deſired
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0005700701:110"/>
me to leave her Room? My Brother was to
blame to take ſo little Care of her Education;
ſhe is quite a Ruſtic!</p>
               <p>Ah! don't wrong your Judgment ſo much,
Sir, ſaid <hi>Glanville;</hi> my Couſin has as little of
the Ruſtic as if ſhe had paſſed all her Life in a
Court: Her fine Senſe, and the native Elegance
of her Manners give an inimitable Grace to her
Behaviour; and as much exceed the ſtudied Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs
of other Ladies I have converſed with,
as the Beauties of her Perſon do all I have ever
ſeen.</p>
               <p>She is very handſome, I confeſs, returned Sir
<hi>Charles;</hi> but I cannot think ſo well of her <hi>Wit</hi>
as you do; for methinks ſhe talks very oddly,
and has the ſtrangeſt Conceits! Who, but her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
would think it probable, that one Man
could put a whole Army to Flight; or commend
a fooliſh Fellow for living in a Tomb, becauſe
his Wife was buried in it? Fie, fie! theſe are
ſilly and extravagant Notions, and will make
her appear very ridiculous.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> was ſo ſenſible of the Juſtneſs
of this Remark, that he could not help ſighing;
which his Father obſerving, told him, That,
ſince ſhe was to be his Wife, it was his Buſineſs
to produce a Reformation in her; for, added
he, notwithſtanding the immenſe Fortune ſhe
will bring you, I ſhould be ſorry to have a
Daughter-in-law, for whom I ſhould bluſh as
often as ſhe opens her Mouth.</p>
               <p>I aſſure you, Sir, ſaid Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> I have
but very little Hopes, that I ſhall be ſo happy as
to have my Couſin for a Wife; for, tho' it was
my Uncle's Command I ſhould make my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0005700701:111"/>
to her, ſhe received me ſo ill, as a Lover,
that I have never dared to talk to her upon that
Subject ſince.</p>
               <p>And pray, reſumed Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> upon what
Terms are you at preſent?</p>
               <p>While I ſeem to pretend nothing to her, as a
Lover, replied Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> ſhe is very obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
and we live in great Harmony together;
but I am perſuaded, if I exceed the Bounds of
Friendſhip in my Profeſſions, ſhe will treat me
extremely ill.</p>
               <p>But, interrupted Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> when ſhe ſhall
know, that her Father has bequeathed you one
Third of his Eſtate, provided ſhe don't marry
you, 'tis probable her Mind may change; and
you may depend upon it, ſince your Heart is ſo
much ſet upon her, that, as I am her Guardian,
I ſhall preſs her to perform the Marquis's Will.</p>
               <p>Ah! Sir, reſumed Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to lay any Conſtraint upon my Couſin in
an Affair of this Nature: Permit me to tell you,
it would be an Abuſe of the Marquis's generous
Confidence, and what I would never ſubmit
to.</p>
               <p>Nay, nay, ſaid the old Gentleman, you have
no Reaſon to fear any Compulſion from me:
Tho' her Father has left me her Guardian, till
ſhe is of Age, yet it is with ſuch Reſtriction,
that my Niece is quite her own Miſtreſs in that
Reſpect; for tho' ſhe is directed to conſult me
in her Choice of an Huſband, yet my Conſent
is not abſolutely neceſſary. The Marquis has
certainly had a great Opinion of his Daughter's
Prudence; and I hope, ſhe will prove herſelf
worthy of it by her Conduct.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:0005700701:112"/>
Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> was ſo taken up with his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
upon the State of his Affairs, that he
made but little Reply; and, as ſoon as he had
diſengaged himſelf, retired to his Chamber, to
be at more Liberty to indulge his Meditations.
As he could not flatter himſelf, with having
made any Impreſſion upon the Heart of <hi>Arabella,</hi>
he foreſaw a thouſand Incoveniences from the
Death of the Marquis; for, beſides that he loſt
a powerful Mediator with his Couſin, he feared
that, when ſhe appeared in the World, her
Beauty and Fortune would attract a Croud of
Admirers, among whom, it was probable, ſhe
would find ſome one more agreeable to her
Taſte than himſelf. As he loved her with great
Tenderneſs, this Thought made him extremely
uneaſy; and he would ſometimes wiſh the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
had laid a ſtronger Injunction upon her in
his Will to marry him; and regretted the little
Power his Father had over her: But he was too
generous, to dwell long upon theſe Thoughts,
and contented himſelf with doing all that was
honourable to obtain her, without ſeeking for
any Aſſiſtance from unjuſtifiable Methods.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>ARABELLA,</hi> in a few Days, leaving her
Chamber, had ſo many Opportunities of
charming her Uncle by her Converſation,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0005700701:113"/>
which, when it did not turn upon any Incident
in her Romances, was perfectly fine, eaſy, and
entertaining, that he declared, he ſhould quit
the Caſtle with great Regret; and endeavoured
to perſuade her to accompany him to Town:
But <hi>Arabella,</hi> who was determined to paſs the
Year of her Mourning, in the Retirement ſhe
had always lived in, abſolutely refuſed, ſtrong
as her Curioſity was, to ſee <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> ſecretly rejoiced at this Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
tho' he ſeemed deſirous of making her
change it; but ſhe was unalterable; and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the Baronet did not think proper to preſs
her any more.</p>
               <p>Her Father's Will being read to her, ſhe
ſeemed extremely pleaſed with the Articles in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> wiſhing him Joy of the
Eſtate that was bequeathed to him, with a moſt
inchanting Sweetneſs.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> ſighed, and caſt his Eyes on
the Ground, as he returned her Compliment,
with a very low Bow; and Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Confuſion, told <hi>Arabella,</hi> that he thought
it was a very bad Omen for his Son, to wiſh
him Joy of an Eſtate, which he could not come to
the Poſſeſſion of, but by a very great Misfortune.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> underſtanding his Meaning, bluſhed;
and, willing to change the Diſcourſe, proceeded
to conſult her Uncle upon the Regulation of her
Houſe. Beſides the Legacies her Father had
bequeathed to his Servants, thoſe, who were
more immediately about his Perſon, ſhe deſired,
might have their Salaries continued to them:
She made no other Alteration, than diſcharging
theſe Attendants, retaining all the others; and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0005700701:114"/>
ſubmitting to her Uncle the Management of her
Eſtates, receiving the Allowance he thought
proper to aſſign her, till ſhe was of Age, of
which ſhe wanted three Years.</p>
               <p>Every Thing being ſettled, Sir <hi>Charles</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to return to Town. Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> who
deſired nothing ſo much as to ſtay ſome time
longer with his Couſin in her Solitude, got his
Father to intreat that Favour for him of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella:</hi>
But ſhe repreſented to her Uncle the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety
of a young Gentleman's ſtaying with
her, in her Houſe, now her Father was dead,
in a manner ſo genteel and convincing, that
Sir <hi>Charles</hi> could preſs it no further; and all
that Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> could obtain, was, a Permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to viſit her ſome time after, provided he
could prevail upon his Siſter, Miſs <hi>Charlotte
Glanville,</hi> to accompany him.</p>
               <p>The Day of their Departure being come, Sir
<hi>Charles</hi> took his Leave of his charming Niece,
with many Expreſſions of Eſteem and Affection;
and Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> appeared ſo concerned, that
<hi>Arabella</hi> could not help obſerving it; and bade
him adieu with great Sweetneſs.</p>
               <p>When they were gone, ſhe found her Time
hung heavy upon her Hands; her Father was
continually in her Thoughts, and made her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
melancholy: She recollected the many
agreeable Converſations ſhe had had with <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville;</hi>
and wiſhed it had been conſiſtent with
Decency to have detained him. Her Books
being the only Amuſement ſhe had left, ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
herſelf to reading with more Eagerneſs
than ever; but, notwithſtanding the Delight
ſhe took in this Employment, ſhe had ſo many
Hours of Solitude and Melancholy to indulge
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0005700701:115"/>
the Remembrance of her Father in, that ſhe
was very far from being happy.</p>
               <p>As ſhe wiſhed for nothing more paſſionately
than an agreeable Companion of her own Sex
and Rank, an Accident threw a Perſon in her
Way, who, for ſome Days, afforded her a little
Amuſement. Stepping one Day out of her Coach,
to go into Church, ſhe ſaw a young Lady enter,
accompanied with a middle-aged Woman, who
ſeemed to be an Attendant. As <hi>Arabella</hi> had
never ſeen any one, above the Rank of a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
Farmer's Daughter, in this Church, her
Attention was immediately engaged by the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of this Stranger, who was very mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificently
dreſſed: Tho' ſhe did not ſeem to be
more than eighteen Years of Age, her Statute
was above the ordinary Size of Women; and,
being rather too plump to be delicate, her Mien
was ſo majeſtic, and ſuch an Air of Grandeur
was diffuſed over her whole Perſon, joined to
the Charms of a very lovely Face, that <hi>Arabella</hi>
could hardly help thinking ſhe ſaw the beautiful
<hi>Candace</hi> before her, who, by <hi>Scudery</hi>'s Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
very much reſembled this Fair one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> having heedfully obſerved her Looks,
thought ſhe ſaw a great Appearance of Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
in her Eyes, which filled her with a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Concern for the Misfortunes of ſo admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a Perſon; but, the Service beginning, ſhe
was not at Liberty to indulge her Reflections
upon this Occaſion, as ſhe never ſuffered any
Thoughts, but thoſe of Religion, to intrude
upon her Mind, during theſe pious Rites.</p>
               <p>As ſhe was going out of Church ſhe obſerved
the young Lady, attended only with the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
who came with her, preparing to walk
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0005700701:116"/>
home, and therefore ſtept forward, and, ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
her with a Grace peculiar to herſelf, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
her to come into her Coach, and give
her the Pleaſure of ſetting her down at her own
Houſe: So obliging an Offer from a Perſon of
<hi>Arabella</hi>'s Rank could not fail of being received
with great Reſpect by the young Lady, who was
not ignorant of all the Forms of Good-breeding;
and, accepting her Invitation, ſhe ſtepped into
the Coach; <hi>Arabella</hi> obliging her Woman to
come in alſo, for whom, as ſhe had that Day only
<hi>Lucy</hi> along with her, there was Room enough.</p>
               <p>As they were going home, <hi>Arabella,</hi> who
longed to be better acquainted, intreated the
fair Stranger, as ſhe called her, to go to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
and ſpend the Day with her; and ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting,
they paſſed by the Houſe where ſhe
lodged, and alighted at the Caſtle, where <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi>
welcomed her, with the moſt obliging Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of Civility and Reſpect. The young
Lady, tho' perfectly verſed in the Modes of
Town-Breeding, and <hi>nothing-meaning</hi> Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
was at a Loſs how to make proper Returns
to the Civilities of <hi>Arabella:</hi> The native Elegance
and Simplicity of her Manners were accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with ſo much real Benevolence of Heart,
ſuch inſinuating Tenderneſs, and Graces ſo ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible,
that ſhe was quite oppreſſed with
them; and, having ſpent moſt of her Time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
her Toilet and Quadrille, was ſo little
qualified for partaking a Converſation ſo refined
as <hi>Arabella</hi>'s, that her Diſcourſe appeared quite
tedious to her, ſince it was neither upon Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions,
Aſſemblies, Cards, or Scandal.</p>
               <p>Her Silence, and that Abſence of Mind, which
ſhe betrayed, made <hi>Arabella</hi> conclude, ſhe was
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0005700701:117"/>
under ſome very great Affliction; and, to amuſe
her after Dinner, led her into the Gardens, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
a Perſon, whoſe Uneaſineſs, as ſhe did
not doubt, proceeded from Love, would be
pleaſed with the Sight of Groves and Streams,
and be tempted to diſcloſe her Misfortunes,
while they wandered in that agreeable Privacy.
In this, however, ſhe was deceived; for, tho' the
young Lady ſighed ſeveral times, yet, when ſhe
did ſpeak, it was only of indifferent Things, and
not at all in the manner of an afflicted Heroine.</p>
               <p>After obſerving upon a thouſand Trifles, ſhe
told <hi>Arabella</hi> at laſt, to whom ſhe was deſirous
of making known her Alliance to Quality, that
theſe Gardens were extremely like thoſe of her
Father's-in-Law, the Duke of—at—</p>
               <p>At this Intimation, ſhe expected <hi>Arabella</hi>
would be extremely ſurpriſed; but that Lady,
whoſe Thoughts were always familiarized to Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of Grandeur, and would not have been
aſtoniſhed, if ſhe had underſtood her Gueſt was
the Daughter of a King, appeared ſo little moved,
that the Lady was piqued by her Indifference;
and, after a few Moment's Silence, began to
mention going away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> who was deſirous of retaining her a
few Days, intreated her ſo obligingly to favour
her with her Company, for ſome time, in her
Solitude, that the other could not refuſe; and,
diſpatching her Woman to the Houſe where ſhe
lodged, to inform them of her Stay at the Caſtle,
would have diſpenſed with her coming again to
attend her, had not <hi>Arabella</hi> inſiſted upon the
contrary.</p>
               <p>The Reſerve, which the Daughter-in-Law
of the Duke of—ſtill continued to maintain,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0005700701:118"/>
notwithſtanding the repeated Expreſſions of
Friendſhip <hi>Arabella</hi> uſed to her, increaſed her
Curioſity to know her Adventures, which ſhe
was extremely ſurpriſed, ſhe had never offered
to relate; but, attributing her Silence, upon this
Head, to her Modeſty, ſhe was reſolved, as was
the Cuſtom in thoſe Caſes, to oblige her Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who, ſhe preſumed, was her Confidante,
to relate, her Lady's Hiſtory to her; and ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for this Perſon one Day, when ſhe was
alone, to attend her in her Cloſet, ſhe gave
Orders to her Women, if the fair Stranger came
to inquire for her, to ſay ſhe was then buſy, but
would wait on her as ſoon as poſſible.</p>
               <p>After this Caution, ſhe ordered Mrs. <hi>Morris</hi>
to be admitted; and, obliging her to ſit down,
told her, ſhe ſent for her in order to hear from
her the Hiſtory of her Lady's Life, which ſhe
was extremely deſirous of knowing.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Morris,</hi> who was a Perſon of Senſe,
and had ſeen the World, was extremely ſurpriſed
at this Requeſt of <hi>Arabella,</hi> which was quite
contrary to the Laws of Good-breeding; and,
as ſhe thought, betrayed a great deal of imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Curioſity: She could not tell how to account
for the free Manner in which ſhe deſired her to
give up her Lady's Secrets, which, indeed, were
not of a Nature to be told; and appeared ſo
much confuſed, that <hi>Arabella</hi> took Notice of it;
and, ſuppoſing it was her Baſhfulneſs which
cauſed her Embarraſſment, ſhe endeavoured to
re-aſſure her by the moſt affable Behaviour ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Morris,</hi> who was not capable of much
Fidelity for her Lady, being but lately taken
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0005700701:119"/>
into her Service, and not extremely fond of her,
thought ſhe had now a fine Opportunity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending
herſelf to <hi>Arabella,</hi> by telling her
all ſhe knew of Miſs <hi>Groves,</hi> for that was her
Name; and, therefore, told her, ſince ſhe was
pleaſed to command it, ſhe would give her what
Account ſhe was able of her Lady; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
her to be ſecret, becauſe it was of great
Conſequence to her, that her Affairs ſhould not
be known.</p>
               <p>I always imagined, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> that your
beautiful Miſtreſs had ſome particular Reaſon
for not making herſelf known, and for coming
in this private Manner into this Part of the
Country: You may aſſure yourſelf therefore,
that I will protect her as far as I am able, and
offer her all the Aſſiſtance in my Power to give
her: Therefore you may acquaint me with her
Adventures, without being apprehenſive of a
Diſcovery that would be prejudicial to her.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Morris,</hi> who had been much better
pleaſed with the Aſſurances of a Reward for the
Intelligence ſhe was going to give her, looked
a little fooliſh at theſe fine Promiſes, in which ſhe
had no Share; and <hi>Arabella,</hi> ſuppoſing ſhe was
endeavouring to recollect all the Paſſages of her
Lady's Life, told her, She need not give herſelf
the Trouble to acquaint her with any thing that
paſſed during the Infancy of her Lady, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to acquaint her with Matters of greater Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance:
And ſince, ſaid ſhe, you have, no
doubt, been moſt favoured with her Confidence,
you will do me a Pleaſure to deſcribe to me, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly,
all the Thoughts of her Soul, as ſhe has
communicated them to you, that I may the
better comprehend her Hiſtory.</p>

                  <p>The Hiſtory of Miſs Groves, interſperſed
with ſome very curious Obſervations.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THOUGH, Madam, ſaid Mrs. <hi>Morris,</hi>
I have not been long in Miſs <hi>Groves</hi>'s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
yet I know a great many Things by the
means of her former Woman, who told them
to me, tho' my Lady thinks I am ignorant of
them; and I know that this is her ſecond Trip
into the Country.</p>
               <p>Pray, interrupted <hi>Arabella,</hi> do me the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to relate Things methodically: Of what
Uſe is it to me to know that this is your Lady's
ſecond Trip, as you call it, into the Country,
if I know not the Occaſion of it? Therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
with informing me, who were the Parents
of this admirable young Perſon.</p>
               <p>Her Father, Madam, ſaid Mrs. <hi>Morris,</hi> was
a Merchant; and, at his Death, left her a large
Fortune, and ſo conſiderable a Jointure to his
Wife, that the Duke of—, being then a Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dower,
was tempted to make his Addreſſes to
her. Mrs. <hi>Groves</hi> was one of the proudeſt Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in the World; and, this Offer flattering
her Ambition more than ever ſhe had Reaſon to
expect, ſhe married the Duke after a very ſhort
Courtſhip; and carried Miſs <hi>Groves</hi> down with
her to—, where the Duke had a fine Seat,
and where ſhe was received by his Grace's
Daughters, who were much about her own Age,
with great Civility. Miſs <hi>Groves,</hi> Madam, was
then about twelve Years old, and was educated
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0005700701:121"/>
with the Duke's Daughters, who, in a little
time, became quite diſguſted with their new
Siſter; for Miſs <hi>Groves,</hi> who inherited her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Pride, tho' not her Underſtanding, in all
things affected an Equality with thoſe young
Ladies, who, conſcious of the Superiority of
their Birth, could but ill bear with her Inſolence
and Preſumption. As they grew older, the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of their Inclinations cauſed perpetual
Quarrels amongſt them; for his Grace's Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
were ſerious, reſerved, and pious. Miſs
<hi>Groves</hi> affected noiſy Mirth, was a great Romp,
and delighted in maſculine Exerciſes.</p>
               <p>The Ducheſs was often reflected on for ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
her Daughter, without any other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
than two or three Servants, to ſpend great
Part of the Day in riding about the Country,
leaping over Hedges and Ditches, expoſing her
fair Face to the Injuries of the Sun and Wind;
and, by thoſe coarſe Exerciſes, contracting a
maſculine and robuſt Air not becoming her Sex,
and tender Years: Yet ſhe could not be prevailed
upon to reſtrain her from this Diverſion, till it
was reported, ſhe had liſtened to the Addreſſes
of a young Sportſman, who uſed to mix in her
Train, when ſhe went upon thoſe Rambles, and
procured frequent Opportunities of converſing
with her.</p>
               <p>There is a great Difference, interrupted <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi>
in ſuffering Addreſſes, and being betrayed
into an involuntary Hearing of them, and this
laſt, I conceive to have been the Caſe of your
Lady; for it is not very probable, ſhe would
ſo far forget what ſhe owed to her own Glory,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0005700701:122"/>
as to be induced to liſten quietly to Diſcourſes
like thoſe you mention.</p>
               <p>However, Madam, reſumed Mrs. <hi>Morris,</hi>
the Ducheſs thought it neceſſary to keep her
more at home; but, even here, ſhe was not
without meeting Adventures, and found a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in the Perſon who taught her to write.</p>
               <p>That, indeed, was a very notable Adventure,
ſaid <hi>Arabella;</hi> but it is not ſtrange, that Love
ſhould produce ſuch Metamorphoſes: 'Tis not
very long ago, that I heard of a Man of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
who diſguiſed himſelf in a poor Habit, and
worked in the Gardens of a certain Nobleman,
whoſe Daughter he was enamoured with: Theſe
things happen every Day.</p>
               <p>The Perſon I ſpeak of, Madam, ſaid Mrs.
<hi>Morris,</hi> was never diſcovered to be any thing
better than a Writing-maſter; and yet, for all
that, Miſs was <hi>ſmitten</hi> with his fine Perſon, and
was taking Meaſures to run away with him,
when the Intrigue was diſcovered, the Lover
diſmiſſed, and the young Lady, whoſe faulty
Conduct had drawn upon her her Mother's Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
was ſent up to <hi>London,</hi> and allowed to be
her own Miſtreſs at Sixteen; to which unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable
Neglect of her Mother ſhe owes the
Misfortunes that have ſince befallen her.</p>
               <p>Whatever may be the common Opinion of
this Matter, interrupted <hi>Arabella</hi> again, I am
perſuaded the Writing-maſter, as you call him,
was ſome Perſon of Quality, who made uſe of
that Device to get Acceſs to his beautiful Miſtreſs.
Love is ingenious in Artifices: Who would
have thought, that, under the Name of <hi>Alcippus,</hi>
a ſimple Attendant of the fair <hi>Artemiſa</hi> Princeſs
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0005700701:123"/>
of <hi>Armenia,</hi> the gallant <hi>Alexander</hi> Son of the great
and unfortunate <hi>Antony,</hi> by Queen <hi>Clcopatra,</hi>
was concealed, who took upon himſelf that
mean Condition for the ſake of ſeeing his adored
Princeſs? Yet the Contrivance of <hi>Orontes,</hi> Prince
of the <hi>Maſſagetes,</hi> was far more ingenious, and
even dangerous; for this valiant and young
Prince, happening to ſee the Picture of the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
<hi>Thaleſtris,</hi> Daughter of the Queen of the
<hi>Amazons,</hi> he fell paſſionately in Love with her;
and, knowing that the Entrance into that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
was forbid to Men, he dreſſed himſelf in
Womens Apparel; and, finding means to be
introduced to the Queen, and her fair Daughter,
whoſe Amity he gained by ſome very ſingular
Services in the Wars, he lived ſeveral Years un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcovered
in their Court: I ſee, therefore, no
Reaſon to the contrary, but that this Writing-master
might have been ſome illuſtrious Perſon,
whom Love had diſguiſed; and, I am perſuaded,
added ſhe, ſmiling, that I ſhall hear more of him
anon, in a very different Character.</p>
               <p>Indeed, Madam, ſaid Mrs. <hi>Morris,</hi> whom
this Speech of <hi>Arabella</hi> had extremely ſurpriſed,
I never heard any thing more about him, than
what I have related; and, for what I know, he
continues ſtill to teach Writing; for I don't ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the Ducheſs's Diſpleaſure could affect
him.</p>
               <p>How is it poſſible, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> that you
can ſuppoſe ſuch an Offence to Probability? In
my Opinion, 'tis much more likely, that this
unfortunate Lover is dead thro' Deſpair; or,
perhaps, wandering over the World in Search
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0005700701:124"/>
of that Fair one, who was ſnatched from his
Hopes.</p>
               <p>If it was his Deſign to ſeek for her, Madam,
reſumed Mrs. <hi>Morris,</hi> he need not have gone
far, ſince ſhe was only ſent to <hi>London,</hi> whither
he might eaſily have followed her.</p>
               <p>There is no accounting for theſe Things, ſaid
<hi>Arabella:</hi> Perhaps he has been impoſed upon, and
made to believe, that it was ſhe herſelf that ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
him from her Preſence: 'Tis probable too,
that he was jealous, and thought ſhe preferred
ſome one of his Rivals to him. Jealouſy is inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
from true Love; and the slighteſt Matters ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
will occaſion it: And, what is ſtill more
wonderful, this Paſſion creates the greateſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
in the moſt ſenſible and delicate Hearts.
Never was there a more refined and faithful
Paſſion, than that of the renowned <hi>Artamenes</hi> for
<hi>Mandana;</hi> and yet this Prince was driven al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
to Diſtraction by a Smile, which, he fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied,
he ſaw in the Face of his Divine Miſtreſs,
at a time when ſhe had ſome Reaſon to believe
he was dead; and he was ſo tranſported with
Grief and Rage, that, tho' he was a Priſoner in
his Enemy's Camp, where the Knowledge of his
Quality would have procured him certain Death,
yet he determined to hazard all Things for the
fake of preſenting himſelf before <hi>Mandana,</hi> and
upbraiding her with her Infidelity; when, in
Reality, nothing was farther from the Thoughts
of that fair and virtuous Princeſs, than the Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
he accuſed her of: So that, as I ſaid before,
it is not at all to be wondered at, if this diſguiſed
Lover of your Lady was driven to Deſpair by
Suſpicions as groundleſs, perhaps, as thoſe of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0005700701:125"/>
                  <hi>Artamenes,</hi> yet not the leſs cruel and torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Morris,</hi> finding <hi>Arabella</hi> held her Peace
at theſe Words, went on with her Hiſtory in
this manner:—Miſs <hi>Groves,</hi> Madam, being
directed by her Woman in all things, took up
her Lodgings in her Father's Houſe, who was a
broken Tradeſman, and obliged to keep himſelf
concealed for fear of his Creditors: Here ſhe
formed her Equipage, which conſiſted of a
Chair, one Footman, a Cook, and her Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:
As ſhe was indulged with the Command
of what Money ſhe pleaſed, her Extravagance
was boundleſs: She laviſhed away large Sums
at Gaming, which was her favourite Diverſion;
kept ſuch a Number of different Animals for
Favourites, that their Maintenance amounted
to a conſiderable Sum every Year: Her Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's
whole Family were ſupported at her Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence;
and, as ſhe frequented all public Places,
and ſurpaſſed Ladies of the firſt Quality in Fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
her Dreſs alone conſumed great Part of her
Income. I need not tell you, Madam, that my
Lady was a celebrated Beauty: You have your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
been pleaſed to ſay, that ſhe is very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.
When ſhe firſt appeared at Court, her
Beauty, and the uncommon Dignity of her Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
at ſuch early Years, made her the Object
of general Admiration. The King was particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
ſtruck with her; and declared to thoſe about
him, that Miſs <hi>Groves</hi> was the fineſt Woman
at Court. The Ladies, however, found means
to explain away all that was flattering in this
Diſtinction: They ſaid, Miſs <hi>Groves</hi> was clumſy;
and it was her Reſemblance to the <hi>unwieldy Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:0005700701:126"/>
Ladies that made her ſo much admired by
his Majeſty. Her Pride, and the Quality Airs
ſhe affected, were the Subject of great Ridicule
to thoſe that envied her Charms: Some Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
were maliciouſly caſt on her Birth; for,
as ſhe was always ſtyled the Ducheſs of—'s
Daughter, a Cuſtom ſhe introduced herſelf, ſhe
ſeemed to diſclaim all Title to a legal Father.
Miſs <hi>Groves,</hi> as univerſally admired as ſhe was,
yet made but very few particular Conqueſts.
Her Fortune was known to be very conſiderable,
and her Mother's Jointure was to deſcend to her
after her Death: Yet there was no Gentleman,
who would venture upon a Wife of Miſs <hi>Groves</hi>'s
Taſte for Expence, as very few Eſtates, <hi>to which
ſhe could pretend,</hi> would ſupport her Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance.
—The Honourable Mr. <hi>L</hi>—Brother
to the Earl of—, was the only one, amidſt
a Croud of Admirers, who made any particular
Addreſs to her. This Gentleman was tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
handſome, and had the Art of making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
agreeable to the Ladies, by a certain Air of
Softneſs and Tenderneſs, which never failed to
make ſome Impreſſion upon thoſe he deſired to
deceive.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Groves</hi> was raviſhed with her Conqueſt,
and boaſted of it ſo openly, that People, who
were acquainted with this Gentleman's Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
foreſeeing her Fate, could not help pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying
her.</p>
               <p>A very few Months Courtſhip completed
the Ruin of poor Miſs <hi>Groves:</hi> She fell a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to Oaths which had been often proſtituted
for the ſame inhuman Purpoſes; and became
ſo fond of her Betrayer, that it was with great
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0005700701:127"/>
Difficulty he could perſuade her not to give him,
even in public, the moſt ridiculous Proofs of
her <hi>Tenderneſs.</hi> Her Woman pretends, that ſhe
was ignorant of this Intrigue, till Miſs <hi>Groves</hi>
growing big with Child, it could no longer be
concealed; it was at length agreed, ſhe ſhould
lie-in at her own Lodgings, to prevent any Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicions
from her retreating into the Country;
but that Scheme was over-ruled by her Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's
Mother, who adviſed her to conceal her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in ſome Village, not far from Town, till
the Affair was over.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Groves</hi> approved of this ſecond Propoſal,
but took Advantage of her Shape, which, being
far from delicate, would not eaſily diſcover any
growing Bigneſs, to ſtay in Town as long as
ſhe poſſibly could. When her Removal was
neceſſary, ſhe went to the Lodgings provided for
her, a few Miles diſtant from <hi>London:</hi> And,
notwithſtanding the Excuſes which were framed
for this ſudden Abſence, the true Cauſe was
more than ſuſpected by ſome buſy People, who
induſtriouſly inquired into her Affairs.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>L</hi>—ſaw her but ſeldom during her Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
The Fear of being diſcovered was his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence:
But her Friends eaſily ſaw through this
Diſguiſe, and were perſuaded Miſs <hi>Groves</hi> was
waning in his Affections.</p>
               <p>As ſhe had a very ſtrong Conſtitution, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to Town at the End of three Weeks:
The Child was dead, and ſhe looked hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomer
than ever. Mr. <hi>L</hi>—continued his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits;
and the Town to make Remarks of
them. All this time the Ducheſs never trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
herſelf about the Conduct of this unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0005700701:128"/>
young Creature: And the People ſhe was
with had not the Goodneſs to give her any Hint
of her Miſconduct, and the Waſte of her For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune:
On the contrary, they almoſt turned her
Head with their Flatteries, preyed upon her
Fortune, and winked at her Irregularities.</p>
               <p>She was now a ſecond time with Child: Her
Character was pretty ſeverely handled by her
Enemies: Mr. <hi>L</hi>—began openly to ſlight her:
And ſhe was now ſeveral thouſand Pounds in
Debt. The Mother and Siſters of her Woman,
in whoſe Houſe ſhe ſtill was, were baſe enough
to whiſper the Fault ſhe had been guilty of to
all their Acquaintances. Her Story became ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
known: She was ſhunned and neglected
by every body; and even Mr. <hi>L</hi>—, who had
been the Cauſe of her Ruin, intirely abandoned
her, and boaſted openly of the Favours he had

               <p>Miſs <hi>Groves</hi> proteſted to her Friends, That
he had promiſed her Marriage; but Mr. <hi>L</hi>—conſtantly
denied it, and never ſcrupled to ſay,
when he was queſtioned about it, That he found
Miſs <hi>Groves</hi> too eaſy a Conqueſt to make any
Perjury neceſſary. Her Tenderneſs, however,
for this baſe Man, was ſo great, that ſhe never
could bear to hear him railed at in her Preſence;
but would quarrel with the only Friends ſhe had
left, if they ſaid any thing to his Diſadvantage.
As ſhe was now pretty far advanced with Child,
ſhe would have retired into the Country; but
the bad Condition of her Affairs made her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval
impoſſible: In this Extremity ſhe had
Recourſe to her Uncle, a rich Merchant in the
City, who, having taken all the neceſſary Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0005700701:129"/>
for his own Security, paid Miſs <hi>Groves</hi>'s
Debts, carrying on, in her Name, a Law-ſuit
with the Ducheſs, for ſome Lands, which were
to be put into her Hands, when ſhe was of Age,
and which that great Lady detained. Miſs
<hi>Groves,</hi> being reduced to live upon ſomething
leſs than an Hundred a Year, quitted <hi>London,</hi>
and came into this Part of the Country, where
ſhe was received by Mrs. <hi>Barnett,</hi> one of her
Woman's Siſters, who is married to a Country
Gentleman of ſome Fortune: In her Houſe ſhe
lay-in of a Girl, which Mr. <hi>L</hi>—ſent to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and will not be perſuaded to inform her
how, or in what manner, he has diſpoſed of the
Child.</p>
               <p>Her former Woman leaving her, I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in her Place, from whom I learnt all
theſe Particulars: And Miſs <hi>Groves</hi> having
gained the Affections of Mr. <hi>Barnett</hi>'s Brother,
her Beauty, and the large Fortune which ſhe
has in Reverſion, has induced him, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the Knowledge of her paſt unhappy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
to marry her. But their Marriage is yet
a Secret, Miſs <hi>Groves</hi> being apprehenſive of her
Uncle's Diſpleaſure for not conſulting him in
her Choice.</p>
               <p>Her Huſband is gone to <hi>London,</hi> with an
Intention to acquaint him with it; and, when
he returns, their Marriage will be publicly
owned.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>MRS. <hi>Morris</hi> ending her Narration,
<hi>Arabella,</hi> who had not been able to
reſtrain her Tears at ſome Parts of it, thanked
her for the Trouble ſhe had been at; and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
her of her Secrecy: Your Lady's Caſe,
ſaid ſhe, is much to be lamented; and greatly
reſembles the unfortunate <hi>Cleopatra</hi>'s, whom
<hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> privately marrying, with a Promiſe
to own her for his Wife, when he ſhould be
peaceable Maſter of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, left
that great Queen big with Child, and, never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to perform his Promiſe, ſuffered her to
be expoſed to the Cenſures the World has ſo

deſerved.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Morris,</hi> ſeeing the favourable Light in
which <hi>Arabella</hi> viewed the Actions of her Lady,
did not think proper to ſay any thing to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
her; but went out of the Cloſet, not a
little mortified at her Diſappointment: For ſhe
ſaw ſhe was likely to receive nothing for betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her Lady's Secrets, from <hi>Arabella:</hi> Who
ſeemed ſo little ſenſible of the Pleaſure of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal,
as to be wholly ignorant of its Nature; and
not to know it when it was told her.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Groves,</hi> who was juſt come to Lady
<hi>Bella</hi>'s Chamber-door, to inquire for her, was
ſurpriſed to ſee her Woman come out of it;
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0005700701:131"/>
and who, upon meeting her, expreſſed great
Confuſion. As ſhe was going to aſk her ſome
Queſtions concerning her Buſineſs there, <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi>
came out of her Cloſet; and, ſeeing
Miſs <hi>Groves</hi> in her Chamber, aſked her Pardon
for ſtaying ſo long from her.</p>
               <p>I have been liſtening to your Hiſtory, ſaid
ſhe, with great Frankneſs, which your Woman
has been relating: And I aſſure you I am ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
ſenſible of your Misfortunes.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Groves,</hi> at theſe Words, bluſhed with
extreme Confuſion; and Mrs. <hi>Morris</hi> turned
pale with Aſtoniſhment and Fear. <hi>Arabella,</hi>
not ſenſible that ſhe had been guilty of any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion,
proceeded to make Reflections upon
ſome Part of her Story; which, though they
were not at all diſadvantageous to that young
Lady, ſhe received as ſo many Inſults: And
aſked Lady <hi>Bella,</hi> If ſhe was not aſhamed to
tamper with a Servant to betray the Secrets of
her Miſtreſs?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> a little ſurpriſed at ſo rude a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
anſwered, however, with great Sweetneſs;
and proteſted to her, that ſhe would make no
ill Uſe of what ſhe had learned of her Affairs:
For, in fine, Madam, ſaid ſhe, do you think I
am leſs fit to be truſted with your Secrets, than
the Princeſs of the <hi>Leontines</hi> was with thoſe of
<hi>Clelia;</hi> between whom there was no greater
Amity and Acquaintance, than with us? And
you muſt certainly know, that the Secrets which
that admirable Perſon entruſted with <hi>Lyſimena,</hi>
were of a Nature to be more dangerous, if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,
than yours. The Happineſs of <hi>Clelia</hi>
depended upon <hi>Lyſimena</hi>'s Fidelity: And the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0005700701:132"/>
Liberty, nay, haply, the Life, of <hi>Aronces,</hi> would
have been in Danger, if ſhe had betrayed them.
Though I do not intend to arrogate to myſelf
the Poſſeſſion of thoſe admirable Qualities which
adorned the Princeſs of the <hi>Leontines,</hi> yet I will
not yield to her, or any one elſe, in Generoſity
and Fidelity: And if you will be pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
as much Confidence in me, as thoſe illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

will <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>abour as earneſtly for your Intereſt, as that
fair Princeſs did for thoſe of <hi>Aronces</hi> and <hi>Clelia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Groves</hi> was ſo buſied in reflecting upon
the Baſeneſs of her Woman in expoſing her,
that ſhe heard not a Word of this fine Harangue
(at which Mrs. <hi>Morris,</hi> notwithſtanding the
Cauſe ſhe had for Uneaſineſs, could hardly help
laughing); but, aſſuming ſome of that Haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in her Looks, for which ſhe uſed to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,
ſhe told Lady <hi>Bella,</hi> that ſhe imputed
her impertinent Curioſity to her Country Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and ill Breeding: And ſhe did not doubt
but ſhe would be ſerved in her own kind, and
meet with as bad Fortune as ſhe had done; and,
perhaps, deſerve it <hi>worſe</hi> than ſhe did: For
there are more falſe Men in the World beſides
Mr. <hi>L</hi>—; and ſhe was no handſomer than
other People.</p>
               <p>Saying this, ſhe flung out of the Room, her
Woman following, leaving <hi>Arabella</hi> in ſuch
Confuſion at a Behaviour of which ſhe had
never before had an Idea, that for ſome Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ſhe remained immoveable.</p>
               <p>Recollecting herſelf, at laſt, and conceiving,
that Civility required ſhe ſhould endeavour to
appeaſe this incenſed Lady, ſhe went down
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0005700701:133"/>
Stairs after her; and, ſtopping her juſt as ſhe
was going out of the Houſe, intreated her to be
calm, and ſuffer her to vindicate herſelf from
the Imputation of being impertinently curious
to know her Affairs.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Groves,</hi> quite tranſported with Shame
and Anger, refuſed abſolutely to ſtay.</p>
               <p>At leaſt, Madam, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> ſtay till
my Coach can be got ready; and don't think
of walking home, ſo ſlightly attended.</p>
               <p>This Offer was as ſullenly anſwered as the
other: And <hi>Arabella,</hi> finding ſhe was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to venture home, with no other Guard
than her Woman, who ſilently followed her,
ordered two of her Footmen to attend her at
a ſmall Diſtance; and to defend her, if there
ſhould be Occaſion.</p>
               <p>For who knows, ſaid ſhe to <hi>Lucy,</hi> what Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
may happen? Some one or other of her
inſolent Lovers may take this Opportunity to
carry her away; and I ſhould never forgive
myſelf for being the Cauſe of ſuch a Misfortune
to her.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Morris</hi> having found it eaſy to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
herſelf to her Lady, by aſſuring her, that
Lady <hi>Bella</hi> was acquainted with great Part of
her Story before; and that what ſhe told her,
tended only to juſtify her Conduct, as ſhe might
have been convinced by what Lady <hi>Bella</hi> ſaid;
they both went home with a Reſolution to ſay
nothing of what had paſſed, with relation to the
Cauſe of the Diſguſt Miſs <hi>Groves</hi> had received:
But only ſaid, in general, that Lady <hi>Bella</hi> was
the moſt ridiculous Creature in the World; and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0005700701:134"/>
was ſo totally ignorant of good Breeding, that
it was impoſſible to converſe with her.</p>

                  <p>Which treats of the Olympic Games.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WHILE <hi>Arabella</hi> was ruminating on
the unaccountable Behaviour of her
new Acquaintance, ſhe received a Letter from
her Uncle, informing her (for ſhe had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
forbid Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> to write to her), that
his Son and Daughter intended to ſet out for her
Seat in a few Days.</p>
               <p>This News was received with great Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
by <hi>Arabella,</hi> who hoped to find an
agreeable Companion in her Couſin; and was
not ſo inſenſible of Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi>'s Merit, as
not to feel ſome kind of Pleaſure at the Thought
of ſeeing him again.</p>
               <p>This Letter was ſoon followed, by the Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
of Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> and his Siſter; who, upon
the Sight of <hi>Arabella,</hi> diſcovered ſome Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of Aſtoniſhment and Chagrin; for,
notwithſtanding all her Brother had told her of
her Accompliſhments, ſhe could not conceive
it poſſible for a young Lady, bred up in the
Country, to be ſo perfectly elegant and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel
as ſhe found her Couſin.</p>
               <p>As Miſs <hi>Charlotte</hi> had a large Share of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetry
in her Compoſition, and was fond of
Beauty in none of her own Sex but herſelf, ſhe
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0005700701:135"/>
was ſorry to ſee Lady <hi>Bella</hi> poſſeſſed of ſo great
a Share; and, being in Hopes her Brother had
drawn a flattering Figure of her Couſin, ſhe
was extremely diſappointed at finding the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
ſo handſome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> on the contrary, was highly pleaſed
with Miſs <hi>Glanville;</hi> and, finding her Perſon
very agreeable, did not fail to commend her
Beauty: A ſort of Complaiſance mightily in
Uſe among the Heroines, who knew not what
Envy or Emulation meant.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> received her Praiſes with
great Politeneſs, but could not find in her Heart
to return them: And, as ſoon as theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments
were over, Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> told Lady
<hi>Bella,</hi> how tedious he had found the ſhort Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
ſhe had forced him to, and how great was
his Satisfaction at ſeeing her again.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not diſpute the Truth of your laſt Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion,
replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> ſmiling, ſince I verily
believe, you are mighty well ſatisfied at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent;
but I know not how you will make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that an Abſence, which you allow to be
ſhort, has ſeemed ſo tedious to you; for this is
a manifeſt Contradiction: However, purſued
ſhe, preventing his Reply, you look ſo well,
and ſo much at Eaſe, that I am apt to believe,
Abſence has agreed very well with you.</p>
               <p>And yet I aſſure you, Madam, ſaid Mr. <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
interrupting her, that I have ſuffered more
Uneaſineſs during this Abſence, than I fear you
will permit me to tell you.</p>
               <p>Since, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> that Uneaſineſs has
neither made you thinner, nor paler, I don't
think you ought to be pitied: For, to ſay the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0005700701:136"/>
Truth, in theſe Sort of Matters, a Perſon's bare
Teſtimony has but little Weight.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> was going to make her ſome
Anſwer; when Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> who, while they
had been ſpeaking, was adjuſting her Dreſs at
the Glaſs, came up to them, and made the
Converſation more general.</p>
               <p>After Dinner, they adjourned to the Gardens,
where the gay Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> running eagerly
from one Walk to another, gave her Brother
as many Opportunities of talking to Lady <hi>Bella</hi>
as he could wiſh: However, he ſtood in ſuch
Awe of her, and dreaded ſo much another
Baniſhment, that he did not dare, otherwiſe
than by diſtant Hints, to mention his Paſſion;
and <hi>Arabella,</hi> well enough pleaſed with a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
that in ſome meaſure came up to her Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
diſcovered no Reſentment at Inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations
ſhe was at Liberty to diſſemble the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
of: And if he could not, by her Behaviour,
flatter himſelf with any great Hopes, yet he
found as little Reaſon, in <hi>Arabella</hi>'s Language,
to deſpair.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> at the End of a few Weeks,
was ſo tired of the magnificent Solitude ſhe
lived in, that ſhe heartily repented her Journey;
and inſinuated to her Brother, her Inclination
to return to Town.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> knowing his Stay was regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
by his Siſter's, intreated her not to expoſe
him to the Mortification of leaving <hi>Arabella</hi> ſo
ſoon; and promiſed her he would contrive ſome
Amuſements for her, which ſhould make her
reliſh the Country better than ſhe had yet done.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:0005700701:137"/>
Accordingly, he propoſed to <hi>Arabella</hi> to go
to the Races, which were to be held at—a
few Miles from the Caſtle: She would have
excuſed herſelf, upon account of her Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
but Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> diſcovered ſo great an
Inclination to be preſent at this Diverſion, that
<hi>Arabella</hi> could no longer refuſe to accompany
her.</p>
               <p>Since, ſaid ſhe to Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> you are
fond of public Diverſions, it happens very
luckily, that theſe Races are to be held at the
Time you are here: I never heard of them before,
and I preſume 'tis a good many Years ſince they
were laſt celebrated. Pray, Sir, purſued ſhe,
turning to <hi>Glanville,</hi> do not theſe Races, in
ſome Degree, reſemble the <hi>Olympic</hi> Games? Do
the Candidates ride in Chariots?</p>
               <p>No, Madam, replied <hi>Glanville;</hi> the Jockeys
are mounted upon the fleeteſt Courſers they can
procure; and he who firſt reaches the Goal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
the Prize.</p>
               <p>And who is the fair Lady that is to beſtow it?
reſumed <hi>Arabella:</hi> I dare engage one of her
Lovers will enter the Liſts; ſhe will, doubtleſs,
be in no leſs Anxiety than he; and the Shame
of being overcome, will hardly affect him with
more Concern, than herſelf; that is, provided
he be ſo happy as to have gained her Affections.
I cannot help thinking the fair <hi>Eliſmonda</hi> was
extremely happy in this Particular: For ſhe had
the Satisfaction to ſee her ſecret Admirer Victor
in all the Exerciſes at the <hi>Olympic</hi> Games, and
carry away the Prize from many Princes, and
Perſons of rare Quality, who were Candidates
with him; and he had alſo the Glory to receive
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0005700701:138"/>
three Crowns in one Day, from the Hands of
his adored Princeſs; who, queſtionleſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
them upon him with an infinite deal of
Joy.</p>
               <p>What Sort of Races were thoſe, Madam?
ſaid Miſs <hi>Glanville;</hi> whoſe Reading had been
very confined.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Olympic</hi> Games, Miſs, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> ſo
called from <hi>Olympia,</hi> a City near which they
were performed, in the Plains of <hi>Elis,</hi> conſiſted
of Foot and Chariot-Races; Combats with the
Ceſtus; Wreſtling, and other Sports. They
were inſtituted in Honour of the Gods and
Heroes; and were therefore termed ſacred, and
were conſidered as a Part of Religion.</p>
               <p>They were a kind of School, or military Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prenticeſhip;
in which the Courage of the Youth
found conſtant Employment: And the Reaſon
why Victory in thoſe Games was attended with
ſuch extraordinary Applauſe, was, that their
Minds might be quickened with great and noble
Proſpects, when, in this Image of War, they
arrived to a Pitch of Glory, approaching, in
ſome reſpects, to that of the moſt famous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors.
They thought this Sort of Triumph
one of the greateſt Parts of Happineſs of which
Human Nature was capable: So that when
<hi>Diagoras</hi> had ſeen his Sons crowned in the
<hi>Olympic</hi> Games, one of his Friends made him
this Compliment, Now, <hi>Diagoras,</hi> you may die
ſatisfied; ſince you can't be a God. It would
tire you, perhaps, was I to deſcribe all the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes
performed there: But you may form a
general Notion of them, from what you have
doubtleſs read of Juſts and Tournaments.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:0005700701:139"/>
Really, ſaid Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> I never read
about any ſuch Things.</p>
               <p>No! replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> ſurpriſed: Well, then,
I muſt tell you, that they hold a middle Place,
between a Diverſion and a Combat; but the
<hi>Olympic</hi> Games were attended with a much
greater Pomp and Variety: And not only all
<hi>Greece,</hi> but other neighbouring Nations, were
in a manner drained, to furniſh out the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</p>
               <p>Well, for my Part, ſaid Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> I
never before heard of theſe Sort of Races; thoſe
I have been at were quite different. I know
the Prizes and Bets are ſometimes very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable.</p>
               <p>And, doubtleſs, interrupted <hi>Arabella,</hi> there
are a great many Heroes who ſignalize them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
at theſe Races; not for the ſake of the
Prize, which would be unworthy of great Souls,
but to ſatisfy that burning Deſire of Glory,
which ſpurs them on to every Occaſion of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it.</p>
               <p>As for the Heroes, or Jockeys, ſaid Miſs
<hi>Glanville,</hi> call them what you pleaſe, I believe
they have very little Share, either of the Profit
or Glory: For their Maſters have the one, and
the Horſes the other.</p>
               <p>Their Maſters! interrupted <hi>Arabella:</hi> What,
I ſuppoſe, a great many foreign Princes ſend their
Favourites to Combat, in their Name? I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
to have read, that <hi>Alcibiades</hi> triumphed
three times ſucceſſively at the <hi>Olympic</hi> Games,
by means of one of his Domeſtics, who, in his
Maſter's Name, entered the Liſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:0005700701:140"/>
Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> fearing his Siſter would make
ſome abſurd Anſwer, and thereby diſoblige his
Couſin, took up the Diſcourſe: And, turning
it upon the <hi>Grecian</hi> Hiſtory, engroſſed her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
for two Hours, wholly to himſelf;
while Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> (to whom all they ſaid was
quite unintelligible) diverted herſelf with hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
a Tune, and tinkling her Couſin's Harp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſichord;
which proved no Interruption to the
more rational Entertainment of her Brother and

going to her Toilet, I ſhan't make you wait
long.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> ſeating herſelf near the Table,
reſolved to be preſent while her Couſin was
dreſſing, that ſhe might have an Opportunity to
make ſome Remarks to her Diſadvantage: But
ſhe was extremely mortified, to obſerve the
Haſte and Negligence ſhe made her Women
uſe in this important Employment; and that,
notwithſtanding her Indifference, nothing could
appear more lovely and genteel.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> however, pleaſed herſelf with
the Certainty of ſeeing her Couſin's Dreſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
ridiculed, for the peculiar Faſhion of
her Gown: And the Veil, which, as becoming as
it was, would, by its Novelty, occaſion great
Diverſion among the Ladies, helped to comfort
her for the Superiority of her Charms; which,
partial as ſhe was to her own, ſhe could not help
ſecretly confeſſing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella</hi> being dreſſed in much leſs time
than her Couſin, Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> was admitted,
who led her down Stairs to her Coach, which
was waiting: His Siſter (ſecretly repin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the Advantage <hi>Arabella</hi> had over her,
in having ſo reſpectful an Adorer) followed:
And, being placed in the Coach, they ſet out
with great Appearance of Good-humour on all
Sides.</p>
               <p>They got to—but juſt time enough to
ſee the Beginning of the firſt Courſe: <hi>Arabella,</hi>
who fanſied the Jockeys were Perſons of great
Diſtinction, ſoon became intereſted in the Fate
of one of them, whoſe Appearance pleaſed her
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0005700701:142"/>
more than the others. Accordingly, ſhe made
Vows for his Succeſs, and appeared ſo extremely
rejoiced at the Advantage he had gained, that
Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> maliciouſly told her, People
would make Remarks at the Joy ſhe expreſſed,
and fanſy ſhe had a more than ordinary Intereſt
in that Jockey, who had firſt reached the Goal.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> whom this impertinent Inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of his Siſter had filled with Confuſion
and Spite, ſat biting his Lips, trembling for
the Effect it would produce in <hi>Arabella:</hi> But
ſhe, giving quite another Turn to her Couſin's
Words, I aſſure you, ſaid ſhe, with a Smile,
I am not any further intereſted in the Fate of
this Perſon, who has hitherto been ſucceſsful,
than what the Handſomeneſs of his Garb, and
the Superiority of his Skill, may demand, from
an unprejudiced Spectator: And, though I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
you imagine he is ſome concealed Lover
of mine, yet I don't remember to have ever
ſeen him: And I am confident it is not for my
ſake that he entered the Liſts; nor is it my
Preſence which animates him.</p>
               <p>Lord bleſs me, Madam! replied Miſs <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
Who would ever think of ſuch ſtrange
things as theſe you talk of? No-body will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to deny that you are very handſome, to be
ſure; but yet, thank Heaven, the Sight of you
is not ſo dangerous, but that ſuch ſort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
as theſe are, may eſcape your Chains.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella</hi> was ſo wholly taken up with the
Event of the Races, that ſhe gave but very little
Heed to this ſarcaſtic Anſwer of Miſs <hi>Glanville;</hi>
whoſe Brother, taking Advantage of an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
which <hi>Arabella</hi> gave him by putting her
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0005700701:143"/>
Head quite out of the Coach, chid her very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
for the Liberty ſhe took with her Couſin.
<hi>Arabella,</hi> by looking earneſtly out of the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
had given ſo full a View of her fine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to a young Baronet, who was not many
Paces from the Coach, that, being ſtruck with
Admiration at the Sight of ſo lovely a Creature,
he was going up to ſome of her Attendants to
aſk who ſhe was, when he perceived Mr. <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
with whom he was intimately acquainted,
in the Coach with her: Immediately he made
himſelf known to his Friend, being exceſſively
rejoiced at having got an Opportunity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
an Acquaintance with a Lady whoſe
Sight had ſo charmed him.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> who had obſerved the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
Bow he made to <hi>Arabella,</hi> accompanied
with a Glance that ſhewed an extreme Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of her, was very little pleaſed at this
Meeting; yet he diſſembled his Thoughts well
enough in his Reception of him. But Miſs
<hi>Glanville</hi> was quite overjoyed, hoping ſhe would
now have her Turn of Gallantry and Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
Therefore, accoſting him in her free Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
Dear Sir <hi>George,</hi> ſaid ſhe, you come in a
lucky Time to brighten up the Converſation:
Relations are ſuch dull Company for one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
'tis half a Minute ſince we have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed
a Word.</p>
               <p>My Couſin, ſaid <hi>Arabella</hi> ſmiling, has ſo
ſtrange a Diſpoſition for Mirth, that ſhe thinks
all her Moments are loſt, in which ſhe finds
nothing to laugh at: For my Part, I do ſo
earneſtly long to know, to which of theſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders
Fortune will give the Victory, that I
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0005700701:144"/>
can ſuffer my Cares for them to receive no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption
from my Couſin's agreeable Gaiety.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> obſerving the Baronet gazed
upon <hi>Arabella</hi> earneſtly while ſhe was ſpeaking
thoſe few Words, reſolved to hinder him from
making any Reply, by aſking him ſeveral Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions
concerning the Racers, their Owners, and
the Bets which were laid; to which <hi>Arabella</hi>
added, And pray, Sir, ſaid ſhe, do me the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to tell me, if you know who that gallant
Man is, who has already won the firſt Courſe.</p>
               <p>I don't know really, Madam, ſaid Sir <hi>George,</hi>
what his Name is, extremely ſurpriſed at her
Manner of aſking.</p>
               <p>The Jockey had now gained the Goal a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
time; and <hi>Arabella</hi> could not conceal her
Satisfaction. Queſtionleſs, ſaid ſhe, he is a
very extraordinary Perſon; but I am afraid we
ſhall not have the Pleaſure of knowing who he
is; for if he has any Reaſon for keeping himſelf
concealed, he will evade any Inquiries after him,
by ſlipping out of the Liſts while this Hurry and
Tumult laſts, as <hi>Hortenſius</hi> did at the <hi>Olympic</hi>
Games; yet, notwithſtanding all his Care, he
was diſcovered by being obliged to fight a ſingle
Combat with one of the Perſons whom he had
worſted at thoſe Games.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> who ſaw his Siſter, by her lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Coquetries with Sir <hi>George,</hi> had prevented
him from hearing great Part of this odd Speech,
propoſed returning to the Caſtle; to which <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi>
agreed: But, conceiving Civility obliged
her to offer the Convenience of a Lodging to a
Stranger of Sir <hi>George</hi>'s Appearance, and who
was an Acquaintance of her Couſins, You muſt
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0005700701:145"/>
permit me, ſaid ſhe to Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
your noble Friend will accompany us to
the Caſtle, where he will meet with better Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations
than at any Inn he can find; for
I conceive, that, coming only to be a Spectator
of theſe Games, he is wholly unprovided with
a Lodging.</p>
               <p>The Baronet, ſurpriſed at ſo uncommon a
Civility, was at a Loſs what Anſwer to make
her at firſt; but, recollecting himſelf, he told
her that he would, if ſhe pleaſed, do himſelf the
Honour to attend her home; but, as his Houſe
was at no great Diſtance from—, he would
be put to no Inconveniency for a Lodging.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> who was not willing to part
ſo ſoon with the Baronet, inſiſted, with her
Couſin's Leave, upon his coming into the
Coach; which he accordingly did, giving his
Horſe to the Care of his Servant; and they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
together to the Caſtle; <hi>Arabella</hi> ſtill
continuing to talk of the Games, as ſhe called
them, while poor <hi>Glanville,</hi> who was exceſſively
confuſed, endeavoured to change the Diſcourſe,
not without an Apprehenſion, that every Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
he could think of, would afford <hi>Arabella</hi> an
Occaſion of ſhewing her Foible; which, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the Pain it gave him, could not
leſſen the Love he felt for her.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>George,</hi> whoſe Admiration of Lady <hi>Bella</hi>
increaſed the longer he ſaw her, was extremely
pleaſed with the Opportunity ſhe had given him
of cultivating an Acquaintance with her: He
therefore lengthened out his Viſit, in hopes of
being able to ſay ſome fine Things to her before
he went away; but Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> who ſtrove
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0005700701:146"/>
by all the little Arts ſhe was Miſtreſs of, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
his Converſation wholly to herſelf, put it
abſolutely out of his Power; ſo that he was
obliged to take his Leave without having the
Satisfaction of even preſſing the fair Hand of
<hi>Arabella;</hi> ſo cloſely was he obſerved by her Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin.
Happy was it for him, that he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
by her Vigilance from attempting a Piece
of Gallantry, which would, undoubtedly, have
procured him a Baniſhment from her Preſence;
but, ignorant, how kind Fortune was to him in
balking his Deſigns, he was ungrateful enough
to go away in a mighty ill Humour with this
fickle Goddeſs: So little capable are poor Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
of knowing what is beſt for them!</p>

               </argument>
               <p>LADY <hi>Bella,</hi> from the Familiarity with
which Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> treated this gay Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
concluding him her Lover, and one
who was apparently well received by her, had a
ſtrong Curioſity to know her Adventures; and
as they were walking the next Morning in the
Garden, ſhe told her, that ſhe thought it was
very ſtrange they had hitherto obſerved ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
to each other, as to baniſh mutual Truſt and
Confidence from their Converſation: Whence
comes it, Couſin, added ſhe, being ſo young and
lovely as you are, that you, queſtionleſs, have
been engaged in many Adventures, you have
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0005700701:147"/>
never repoſed Truſt enough in me to ſavour me
with a Recital of them?</p>
               <p>Engaged in many Adventures, Madam! re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> not liking the Phraſe:
I believe I have been engaged in as few as your
Ladyſhip.</p>
               <p>You are too obliging, returned <hi>Arabella,</hi>
who miſtook what ſhe ſaid for a Compliment;
for ſince you have more Beauty than I, and
have alſo had more Opportunities of making
yourſelf beloved, queſtionleſs you have a
greater Number of Admirers.</p>
               <p>As for Admirers, ſaid Miſs <hi>Charlotte</hi> bridling,
I fanſy I have had my Share! Thank God, I
never found myſelf neglected; but, I aſſure
you, Madam, I have had no Adventures, as
you call them, with any of them.</p>
               <p>No, really! interrutped <hi>Arabella,</hi> inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently.</p>
               <p>No, really, Madam, retorted Miſs <hi>Glanville;</hi>
and I am ſurpriſed you ſhould think ſo.</p>
               <p>Indeed, my Dear, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> you are
very happy in this reſpect, and alſo very ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar;
for I believe there are few young Ladies in
the World, who have any Pretenſions to Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that have not given Riſe to a great many
Adventures; and ſome of them haply very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.</p>
               <p>If you knew more of the World, Lady <hi>Bella,</hi>
ſaid Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> pertly, you would not be ſo
apt to think, that young Ladies engage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in troubleſome Adventures: Truly the
Ladies that are brought up in Town are not ſo
ready to run away with every Man they ſee.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:0005700701:148"/>
No, certainly, interrupted <hi>Arabella;</hi> they do
not give their Conſent to ſuch Proceedings; but
for all that, they are, doubtleſs, run away with
many times; for truly there are ſome Men,
whoſe Paſſions are ſo unbridled, that they will
have recourſe to the moſt violent Methods to
poſſeſs themſelves of the Objects they love.
Pray do you remember how often <hi>Mandana</hi> was
run away with?</p>
               <p>Not I indeed, Madam, replied Miſs <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville;</hi>
I know nothing about her; but I ſuppoſe
ſhe is a <hi>Jew,</hi> by her outlandiſh Name.</p>
               <p>She was no <hi>Jew,</hi> ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> tho' ſhe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
that People very much; for ſhe obtained
the Liberty of great Numbers of them from <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
who had taken them Captives, and could
deny her nothing ſhe aſked.</p>
               <p>Well, ſaid Miſs <hi>Glanville;</hi> and I ſuppoſe ſhe
denied <hi>him</hi> nothing he aſked; and ſo they were
even.</p>
               <p>Indeed but ſhe did tho', reſumed <hi>Arabella;</hi>
for ſhe refuſed to give him a glorious Scarf
which ſhe wore, tho' he begged it on his Knees.</p>
               <p>And ſhe was very much in the right, ſaid
Miſs <hi>Glanville;</hi> for I ſee no Reaſon why a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſhould expect a Gift of any Value from his
Miſtreſs.</p>
               <p>Doubtleſs, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> ſuch a Gift was
worth a Million of Services; and, had he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
it, it would have been a glorious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
for him: However, <hi>Mandana</hi> refuſed it;
and, ſeverely virtuous as you are, I am perſuaded
you can't help thinking, ſhe was a little too ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
in denying a Favour to a Lover like
him—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:0005700701:149"/>
Severely virtuous, Lady <hi>Bella!</hi> ſaid Miſs
<hi>Glanville,</hi> colouring with Anger: Pray what
do you mean by that? Have you any Reaſon
to imagine, I would grant any Favour to a
Lover?</p>
               <p>Why, if I did, Couſin, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> would
it derogate ſo much from your Glory, think you,
to beſtow a Favour upon a Lover worthy your
Eſteem, and from whom you had received a
thouſand Marks of a moſt pure and faithful Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and alſo a great Number of very ſingular
Services?</p>
               <p>I hope, Madam, ſaid Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> it will
never be my Fate to be ſo much obliged to any
Lover, as to be under a Neceſſity of granting
him Favours in Requital.</p>
               <p>I vow, Couſin, interrupted <hi>Arabella,</hi> you
put me in mind of the fair and virtuous <hi>Antonia,</hi>
who was ſo rigid and auſtere, that ſhe thought
all Expreſſions of Love were criminal; and was
ſo far from granting any Perſon Permiſſion to
love her, that ſhe thought it a mortal Offence
to be adored even in private.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> who could not imagine <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi>
ſpoke this ſeriouſly, but that it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
to ſneer at her great Eagerneſs to make
Conqueſts, and the Liberties ſhe allowed herſelf
in, which had probably come to her Knowlege,
was ſo extremely vexed at the malicious Jeſt, as
ſhe thought it, that, not being able to revenge
herſelf, ſhe burſt into Tears.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella</hi>'s Good-nature made her be greatly
affected at this Sight; and, aſking her Pardon
for having undeſignedly occaſioned her ſo much
Uneaſineſs, begged her to be compoſed, and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0005700701:150"/>
tell her in what ſhe had offended her, that ſhe
might be able to juſtify herſelf in her Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions.</p>
               <p>You have made no Scruple to own, Madam,
ſaid ſhe, that you think me capable of granting
Favours to Lovers, when, Heaven knows, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
granted a Kiſs without a great deal of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.</p>
               <p>And you had certainly much Reaſon for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,
ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> exceſſively ſurpriſed at ſuch
a Confeſſion: I aſſure you I never injured you
ſo much in my Thoughts, as to ſuppoſe you
ever granted a Favour of ſo criminal a Nature.</p>
               <p>Look you there now! ſaid Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi>
weeping more violently than before: I knew
what all your round-about Speeches would come
to: All you have ſaid in Vindication of grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Favours, was only to draw me into a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of what I have done: How ungenerous
was that!</p>
               <p>The Favours I ſpoke of, Madam, ſaid <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi>
were quite of another Nature, than thoſe
it ſeems you have ſo liberally granted: Such as
giving a Scarf, a Bracelet, or ſome ſuch Thing,
to a Lover, who had haply ſighed whole Years
in Silence, and did not preſume to declare his
Paſſion, till he had loſt beſt Part of his Blood in
Defence of the Fair one he loved: It was when
you maintained, that <hi>Mandana</hi> was in the right
to refuſe her magnificent Scarf to the illuſtrious
<hi>Cyrus,</hi> that I took upon me to oppoſe your Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gidneſs;
and ſo much miſtaken was I in your
Temper, that I fooliſhly compared you to the
fair and wiſe <hi>Antonia,</hi> whoſe Severity was ſo
remarkable; but really, by what I underſtand
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0005700701:151"/>
from your own Confeſſion, your Diſpoſition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles
that of the inconſiderate <hi>Julia,</hi> who
would receive a Declaration of Love without
Anger from any one; and was not over-ſhy,
any more than yourſelf, of granting Favours al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
as conſiderable as that you have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
               <p>While <hi>Arabella</hi> was ſpeaking, Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi>
having dried up her Tears, ſat ſilently ſwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with Rage, not knowing whether ſhe ſhould
openly avow her Reſentment for the injurious
Language her Couſin had uſed to her, by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away immediately, or, by making up the
Matter, appear ſtill to be her Friend, that ſhe
might have the more Opportunities of revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
herſelf. The Impetuoſity of her Temper
made her moſt inclined to the former; but the
Knowlege that Sir <hi>George</hi> was to ſtay yet ſome
Months in the Country, made her unwilling to
leave a Place, where ſhe might often ſee a Man
whoſe fine Perſon had made ſome Impreſſion
upon her Heart; and, not enduring to leave ſuch
a charming Conqueſt to <hi>Arabella,</hi> ſhe reſolved
to ſuppreſs her Reſentment for the preſent; and
liſtened, without any Appearance of Diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure,
to a fine Harangue of her Couſin upon
the Neceſſity of Reſerve, and diſtant Behaviour,
to Men who preſumed to declare themſelves
Lovers, enforcing her Precepts with Examples
drawn from all the Romances ſhe had ever read;
at the End of which ſhe embraced her, and
aſſured her, if ſhe had ſaid any thing harſh, it
proceeded from her great Regard to her Glory,
of which ſhe ardently wiſhed to ſee her as fond
as herſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:0005700701:152"/>
Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> conſtrained herſelf to make a
Reply that might not appear diſagreeable: And
they were upon theſe Terms, when Mr. <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi>
came up to them, and told Lady <hi>Bella,</hi> Sir
<hi>George</hi> had ſent to intreat their Company at his
Houſe that Day: But, added he, as I preſume
you will not think proper to go, on account of
your Mourning, neither my Siſter nor I will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Invitation.</p>
               <p>I dare ſay, interrupted Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> haſtily,
Lady <hi>Bella</hi> will not expect ſuch a needleſs Piece
of Ceremony from us; and, if ſhe don't think
proper to go, ſhe won't confine <hi>us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By no means, Couſin, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> ſmiling;
and, being perſuaded Sir <hi>George</hi> makes the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
purely for your Sake, it would not
be kind in me to deprive him of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> being pleaſed to find his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin
diſcovered no Inclination to go, would have
perſuaded his Siſter not to leave Lady <hi>Bella:</hi>
But Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> looked ſo much diſpleaſed at
his Requeſt, that he was obliged to inſiſt upon
it no more; and, both retiring to dreſs, Lady
<hi>Bella</hi> went up to her Apartment, and betook
herſelf to her Books, which ſupplied the Place
of all Company to her.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> having taken more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Pains in dreſſing herſelf, in order to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
charming in the Eyes of Sir <hi>George,</hi> came
in to pay her Compliments to Lady <hi>Bella</hi> before
ſhe went, not doubting but ſhe would be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grined
to ſee her look ſo well: But Lady <hi>Bella,</hi>
on the contrary, praiſed the Clearneſs of her
Complexion, and the Sparkling of her Eyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:0005700701:153"/>
I queſtion not, ſaid ſhe, but you will give
Fetters to more Perſons than one To-day; but
remember, I charge you, added ſhe ſmiling,
while you are taking away the Liberty of others,

               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> who could not think it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
one Woman could praiſe another with
any Sincerity, caſt a Glance at the Glaſs, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it was rather becauſe ſhe looked but indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently,
that her Couſin was ſo laviſh in her
Praiſes; and, while ſhe was ſetting her Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
in a Mirror which every Day repreſented
a Face infinitely more lovely than her own, Mr.
<hi>Glanville</hi> came in, who, after having very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectfully
taken Leave of Lady <hi>Bella,</hi> led his
Siſter to the Coach.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>George,</hi> who was extremely mortified to
find Lady <hi>Bella</hi> not in it, handed Miſs <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi>
out with an Air ſo reſerved, that ſhe rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied
him upon it; and gave her Brother a very
unpleaſing Emotion, by telling Sir <hi>George,</hi> ſhe
hoped Lady <hi>Bella</hi>'s not coming along with them,
would not make him bad Company.</p>
               <p>As he was too gallant to ſuffer an handſome
young Lady, who ſpread all her Attractions for
him, to believe he regretted the Abſence of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
when ſhe was preſent; he coquetted with
her ſo much, that Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> was in hopes
his Siſter would wholly engage him from Lady
<hi>Bella.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>In which our Heroine is engaged in a very
perilous Adventure.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN the mean time, that ſolitary Fair one was
alarmed by a Fear of a very unaccountable
Nature; for, being in the Evening in her Cloſet,
the Windows of which had a Proſpect of the
Gardens, ſhe ſaw her illuſtrious concealed Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
who went by the Name of <hi>Edward,</hi> while
he was in her Father's Service, talking with
great Emotion to her Houſe-Steward, who
ſeemed earneſtly to liſten to ſome Propoſitions
he was making to him. Her Surprize at this
Sight was ſo great, that ſhe had not Power to
obſerve them any longer; but, ſeating herſelf in
her Chair, ſhe had juſt Spirits enough to call
<hi>Lucy</hi> to her Aſſiſtance; who, extremely frighted
at the pale Looks of her Lady, gave her a
Smelling-bottle, and was preparing to cut her
Lace, when <hi>Arabella,</hi> preventing her, told her
in a low Voice, that ſhe feared ſhe ſhould be
betrayed into the Hands of an inſolent Lover,
who was come to ſteal her away. Yes, added
ſhe with great Emotion, I have ſeen this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous
Man holding a Converſation with
one of my Servants; and tho' I could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly,
at this Diſtance, hear their Diſcourſe,
yet the Geſtures they uſed in ſpeaking, explained
it too well to me; and I have Reaſon to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
I ſhall ſuffer the ſame Violence that many
illuſtrious Ladies have done before me; and be
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0005700701:155"/>
carried away by Force from my own Houſe, as
they were.</p>
               <p>Alas! Madam! ſaid <hi>Lucy,</hi> terrified at this
Diſcourſe, who is it that intends to carry your
Ladyſhip away? Sure no Robbers will attempt
any Miſchief at ſuch a time as this!</p>
               <p>Yes, <hi>Lucy,</hi> replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> with great Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
the worſt kind of Robbers; Robbers who
do not prey upon Gold and Jewels; but,
what is infinitely more precious, Liberty and
Honour. Do you know that Perſon who called
himſelf <hi>Edward,</hi> and worked in theſe Gardens
like a common Gardener, is now in the Houſe,
corrupting my Servants; and, queſtionleſs, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
to force open my Chamber, and carry
me away? And Heaven knows when I ſhall be
delivered from his Chains.</p>
               <p>God forbid, ſaid <hi>Lucy,</hi> ſobbing, that ever
ſuch a Lady ſhould have ſuch hard Hap! What
Crime, I wonder, can you be guilty of, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
to be in Chains?</p>
               <p>My Crime, reſumed <hi>Arabella,</hi> is to have At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions
which expoſe me to theſe inevitable
Misfortunes, which even the greateſt Princeſſes
have not eſcaped.—But, dear <hi>Lucy,</hi> can you
not think of ſome Methods by which I may
avoid the Evil which waits me? Who knows
but that he may, within theſe few Moments,
force a Paſſage into my Apartment? Theſe
ſlight Locks can make but a poor Reſiſtance to
the Violence he will be capable of uſing.</p>
               <p>Oh dear Madam! cried <hi>Lucy,</hi> trembling,
and preſſing near her, what ſhall we do?</p>
               <p>I aſked your Advice, ſaid ſhe; but I perceive
you are leſs able than myſelf to think of any
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0005700701:156"/>
thing to ſave me.—Ah! <hi>Glanville,</hi> purſued ſhe,
ſighing, would to Heaven thou wert here now!</p>
               <p>Yes, Madam, ſaid <hi>Lucy,</hi> Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi>
I am ſure, would not ſuffer any one to hurt
your Ladyſhip.</p>
               <p>As thou valueſt my Friendſhip, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi>
with great Earneſtneſs, never acquaint him
with what has juſt now eſcaped my Lips: True,
I did call upon him in this Perplexity; I did
pronounce his Name; and that, haply, with a
Sigh, which involuntarily ſorced its Way: And,
queſtionleſs, if he knew his good Fortune, even
amidſt the Danger of loſing me for ever, he
would reſent ſome Emotions of Joy: But I
ſhould die with Shame at having ſo indiſcreetly
contributed to his Satisfaction: And, therefore,
again I charge you, conceal, with the utmoſt
Care, what I have ſaid.</p>
               <p>Indeed, Madam, ſaid <hi>Lucy,</hi> I ſhall tell him
nothing but what your Ladyſhip bids me; and
I am ſo frighted, that I can think of nothing
but that terrible Man, that wants to carry you
away. Mercy on us! added ſhe, ſtarting, I
think I hear ſomebody on the Stairs!</p>
               <p>Do not be alarmed, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtic
Tone: It is I who have moſt Reaſon to
fear: Nevertheleſs, I hope the Grandeur of my
Courage will not ſink under this Accident.
Hark, ſomebody knocks at the Door of my
Antechamber:—My own Virtue ſhall ſupport
me:—Go, <hi>Lucy,</hi> and aſk who it is.</p>
               <p>Indeed I can't, Madam, ſaid ſhe, clinging
to her: Pray pardon me: Indeed I am ſo afraid,
I cannot ſtir.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:0005700701:157"/>
Weak-ſouled Wench! ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> How
unfit art thou for Accidents like theſe! Ah!
had <hi>Cylenia</hi> and <hi>Narteſia</hi> been like thee, the
fair <hi>Berenice,</hi> and the Divine Princeſs of <hi>Media,</hi>
had not ſo eagerly intreated their Raviſhers to
afford them their Company in their Captivity:
But go, I order you, and aſk who it is that
is at the Door of my Apartment: They
knock again: Offer at no Excuſes; but do your
Duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucy,</hi> ſeeing her Lady was really angry, went
trembling out of the Cloſet; but would go no
farther than her Bedchamber, from whence ſhe
called out to know who was at the Door.</p>
               <p>I have ſome Buſineſs with your Lady, ſaid
the Houſe-Steward (for it was he that knocked):
Can I ſpeak with her at preſent?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucy,</hi> a little reaſſured by his Voice, made
no Anſwer; but, creeping ſoftly to the Door of
the Antechamber, double-locked it; and then
cried out in a Tranſport, No, I will take Care
you ſhall not come to my Lady.</p>
               <p>And why, pray, Mrs. <hi>Lucy?</hi> ſaid the Steward:
What have I done, that you are ſo much my
Enemy?</p>
               <p>You are a Rogue, ſaid <hi>Lucy,</hi> growing very
courageous, becauſe the Door was locked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them.</p>
               <p>A Rogue! ſaid he, What Reaſon have you
for calling me a Rogue? I aſſure you I will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
my Lady with your Inſolence. I came
to ſpeak to her Ladyſhip about <hi>Edward;</hi> who
prayed me to intercede for him, that he may
be taken again into her Service: For he ſays,
my Lady never believed any thing againſt him;
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0005700701:158"/>
and that was my Buſineſs: But, when I ſee
her, I'll know whether you are allowed to abuſe
me in this manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> by this time, was advanced as
far as the Bedchamber, longing to know what
ſort of Conference <hi>Lucy</hi> was holding with her
intended Raviſher: When that faithful Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dante,
ſeeing her, came running to her, and
whiſpered her, that the Houſe-Steward was at
the Door, and ſaid he wanted to intercede for
<hi>Edward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ah! the Traitor! ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> retiring
again: Has he, then, really bargained with that
diſloyal Man, to deliver up his Miſtreſs? I am
undone, <hi>Lucy,</hi> ſaid ſhe, unleſs I can find a
Way to eſcape out of the Houſe. They will,
queſtionleſs, ſoon force the Doors of my Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe, ſaid <hi>Lucy,</hi> your Ladyſhip went
down the Stairs that lead from your Dreſſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room
into the Garden; and you may hide your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in the Gardener's Houſe till Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi>
come.</p>
               <p>I approve, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> of one Part of your
Propoſal: But I ſhall not truſt myſelf in the
Gardener's Houſe; who, queſtionleſs, is in the
Plot with the reſt of my perfidious Servants,
ſince none of them have endeavoured to adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
me of my Danger. If we can gain the
Gardens undiſcovered, we may get out by that
Door at the Foot of the Terrace, which leads
into the Fields; for you know I always keep
the Key of that private Door: So, <hi>Lucy,</hi> let us
commend ourſelves to the Direction of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and be gone immediately.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:0005700701:159"/>
But what ſhall we do, Madam, ſaid <hi>Lucy,</hi>
when we are got out?</p>
               <p>Why, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> you ſhall conduct me
to your Brother's; and, probably, we may meet
with ſome generous Cavalier by the Way, who
will protect us till we get thither: However, as
I have as great a Danger to fear within Doors,
as without, I will venture to make my Eſcape,
though I ſhould not be ſo fortunate as to meet
with any Knight who will undertake to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
me from the Danger which I may appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
in the Fields.</p>
               <p>Saying this, ſhe gave the Key of the Door to
<hi>Lucy,</hi> whoſe Heart beat violently with Fear;
and, covering herſelf with ſome black Cypreſs,
which ſhe wore in the Nature of a Veil, went
ſoftly down the little Staircaſe to the Terrace,
followed by <hi>Lucy</hi> (who looked eagerly about her
every Step that ſhe went); and, having gained
the Garden-door, haſtily unlocked it, and fled,
as faſt as poſſible, croſs the Fields, in order to
procure a Sanctuary at <hi>William</hi>'s Houſe: <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi>
begging Heaven to throw ſome generous
Cavalier in her Way, whoſe Protection ſhe
might implore, and, taking every Tree at a
Diſtance for a Horſe and Knight, haſtened her
Steps to meet her approaching Succour; which,
as ſoon as ſhe came near, miſerably balked her
Expectations.</p>
               <p>Though <hi>William</hi>'s Farm was not more than
two Miles from the Caſtle; yet <hi>Arabella,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed
to ſuch a rude Way of Travelling, began
to be greatly fatigued: The Fear ſhe was in of
being purſued by her apprehended Raviſher, had
ſo violent an Effect upon her Spirits, that ſhe
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0005700701:160"/>
was hardly able to proſecute her Flight; and, to
complete her Misfortunes, happening to ſtumble
over a Stump of a Tree that lay in her Way,
ſhe ſtrained her Ancle; and the violent Anguiſh
ſhe felt, threw her into a Swoon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucy,</hi> upon whoſe Arm ſhe leaned, perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her fainting, ſcreamed out aloud, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what to do with her in that Condition: She
placed her upon the Ground; and, ſupporting
her Head againſt that fatal Stump, began to rub
her Temples, weeping exceſſively all the time.
Her Swoon ſtill continuing, the poor Girl was
in inconceivable Terror: Her Brother's Houſe
was now but a little Way off; but it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for her to carry her Lady thither with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſome Help, ſhe knew not what to reſolve
upon.</p>
               <p>At length, thinking it better to leave her for
a few Moments, to run for Aſſiſtance, than to
ſit by her and ſee her periſh for want of it, ſhe
left her, though not without extreme Agony;
and flew, with the utmoſt Eagerneſs, to her
Brother's. She was lucky enough to meet
him juſt coming out of his Door; and, telling
him the Condition in which ſhe left her Lady,
he, without aſking any Queſtions about the
Occaſion of ſo ſtrange an Accident, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
his Amazement, ran with all Speed to
the Place where <hi>Lucy</hi> had left her: But, to their
Aſtoniſhment and Sorrow, ſhe was not to be
found: They walked a long time in Search of
her; and <hi>Lucy,</hi> being almoſt diſtracted with
Fear leſt ſhe had been carried away, made
Complaints that ſo puzzled her Brother he
knew not what to ſay to her: But, finding their
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0005700701:161"/>
Search fruitleſs, they agreed to go home to the
Caſtle, ſuppoſing, with ſome Appearance of
Reaſon, that they might hear of her there.</p>
               <p>Here they found nothing but Grief and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.
Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> and his Siſter were juſt
returned, and had been at Lady <hi>Bella</hi>'s Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but, not finding her there, they aſked
her Women where ſhe was, who, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any thing of her Flight, concluded ſhe was
in the Garden with <hi>Lucy.</hi> Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
at her being at that Hour in the Garden,
ran eagerly to engage her to come in, being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive
ſhe would take Cold, by ſtaying ſo
late in the Air: But, not finding her in any of
her uſual Walks, he ordered ſeveral of the
Servants to aſſiſt him in ſearching the whole
Garden, ſending them to different Places: But
they all returned without Succeſs; which filled
him with the utmoſt Conſternation.</p>
               <p>He was returning, exceſſively uneaſy, to the
Houſe, when he ſaw <hi>Lucy;</hi> who had been juſt
told, in anſwer to her Inquiries about her Lady,
that they were gone to look for her in the
Garden; and running up to Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi>
who hoped to hear News of Lady <hi>Bella</hi> from
her, Oh! Sir, ſaid ſhe, is my Lady found?</p>
               <p>What! <hi>Lucy,</hi> ſaid Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> (more
alarmed than before), do not you know where
ſhe is? I thought you had been with her.</p>
               <p>Oh! dear, cried <hi>Lucy,</hi> wringing her Hands;
for certain my poor Lady was ſtolen away while
ſhe was in that fainting Fit. Sir, ſaid ſhe to
<hi>Glanville,</hi> I know who the Perſon is that my
Lady ſaid (and almoſt broke my Heart) would
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0005700701:162"/>
keep her in Chains: He was in the Houſe not
many Hours ago.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> ſuſpecting this was ſome new
Whim of <hi>Arabella</hi>'s, would not ſuffer <hi>Lucy</hi> to
ſay any more before the Servants, who ſtood
gaping with Aſtoniſhment at the ſtrange Things
ſhe uttered; but bid her follow him to his
Apartment, and he would hear what ſhe could
inform him concerning this Accident. He
would, if poſſible, have prevented his Siſter
from being preſent at the Story; but, not being
able to form any Excuſe for not ſuffering her to
hear every thing that related to her Couſin, they
all three went into his Chamber; where he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
<hi>Lucy</hi> to tell him what ſhe knew about her
Lady.</p>
               <p>You muſt know, Sir, ſaid <hi>Lucy,</hi> ſobbing,
that there came a Man here to take away my
Lady: A great Man he is, though he worked
in the Gardens; for he was in Love with her:
And ſo he would not own who he was.</p>
               <p>And pray, interrupted Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> Who
told you he was a great Man, as you ſay?</p>
               <p>My Lady told me, ſaid <hi>Lucy:</hi> But, <hi>how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomever,</hi>
he was turned away; for the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dener
ſays he catched him ſtealing Carp.</p>
               <p>A very great Man, indeed, ſaid Miſs <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
that would ſteal Carp!</p>
               <p>You muſt know, Madam, ſaid ſhe, that was
only a Pretence: For he went there, my Lady
ſays, to drown himſelf.</p>
               <p>Bleſs me! cried Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> laughing;
the Girl's diſtracted, ſure. Lord! Brother,
don't liſten to her nonſenſical Tales; we ſhall
never find my Couſin by her.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:0005700701:163"/>
Leave her to me, ſaid Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering:
Perhaps I may diſcover ſomething by her
Diſcourſe, that will give us ſome Light into this
Affair.</p>
               <p>Nay, I'll ſtay, I am reſolved, anſwered ſhe;
for I long to know where my Couſin is: Tho',
do you think what this Girl ſays is true, about
a great Man diſguiſed in the Gardens? Sure my
Couſin could never tell her ſuch Stuff: But,
now I think of it, added ſhe, Lady <hi>Bella,</hi>
when we were ſpeaking about the Jockey,
talked ſomething about a Lover: I now believe
it is as the Girl ſays. Pray let's hear her out.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> was ready to die with Vexation,
at the Charmer of his Soul's being thus expoſed;
but there was no Help for it.</p>
               <p>Pray, ſaid he to <hi>Lucy,</hi> tell us no more about
this Man: But, if you can gueſs where your
Lady is, let me know.</p>
               <p>Indeed I can't, Sir, ſaid ſhe; for my Lady and
I both ſtole out of the Houſe, for fear <hi>Edward</hi>
ſhould break open the Doors of her Apartment;
and we were running as faſt as poſſible to my
Brother's Houſe (where ſhe ſaid ſhe would hide
herſelf till you came); but my poor dear Lady
fell down and hurt herſelf ſo much, that ſhe
fainted away: I tried what I could to fetch her
again; but ſhe did not open her Eyes: So I ran
like Lightning to my Brother, to come and help
me to carry her to the Farm; but, when we
came back, ſhe was gone.</p>
               <p>What do you ſay? cried Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> with
a diſtracted Look: Did you leave her in that
Condition in the Fields? And was ſhe not to
be found when you came back?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:0005700701:164"/>
No, indeed, Sir, ſaid <hi>Lucy,</hi> weeping, we
could not find her, though we wandered about
a long time.</p>
               <p>Oh! Heavens! ſaid he, walking about the
Room in a violent Emotion, Where can ſhe be?
What is become of her? Dear Siſter, purſued
he, order ſomebody to ſaddle my Horſe: I'll
traverſe the Country all Night in queſt of her.</p>
               <p>You had beſt inquire, Sir, ſaid <hi>Lucy,</hi> if
<hi>Edward</hi> is in the Houſe: He knows, may be,
where my Lady is.</p>
               <p>Who is he? cried <hi>Glanville.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why the great Man, Sir, ſaid <hi>Lucy,</hi> whom
we thought to be a Gardener, who came to
carry my Lady away; which made her get out
of the Houſe as faſt as ſhe could.</p>
               <p>This is the ſtrangeſt Story, ſaid Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi>
that ever I heard: Sure nobody would be ſo
mad to attempt ſuch an Action; my Couſin has
the oddeſt Whims!</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> not able to liſten any longer,
charged <hi>Lucy</hi> to ſay nothing of this Matter to
any one; and then ran eagerly out of the Room,
ordering two or three of the Servants to go in
Search of their Lady: He then mounted his
Horſe in great Anguiſh of Mind, not knowing
whither to direct his Courſe.</p>

had not been gone long from her before ſhe
opened her Eyes; and, beginning to come per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
to herſelf, was ſurpriſed to find her
Woman not near her: The Moon ſhining very
bright, ſhe looked round her, and called <hi>Lucy</hi>
as loud as ſhe was able; but not ſeeing her, or
hearing any Anſwer, her Fears became ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
that ſhe had like to have relapſed into her
Swoon.</p>
               <p>Alas! unfortunate Maid that I am! cried ſhe,

Treachery is unparalleled? Did not the wicked
<hi>Arianta</hi> betray her Miſtreſs into the Power of
her inſolent Lover? Ah! <hi>Arabella,</hi> thou art
not ſingle in thy Miſery, ſince the divine <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dana</hi>
was, like thyſelf, the Dupe of a merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Servant.</p>
               <p>Having given a Moment or two to theſe ſad
Reflections, ſhe roſe from the Ground with an
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0005700701:166"/>
Intention to walk on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but her Ancle was ſo pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
that ſhe could hardly move: Her Tears began
now to flow with greater Violence: She ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
every Moment to ſee <hi>Edward</hi> approach
her; and was reſigning herſelf up to Deſpair,
when a Chaiſe, driven by a young Gentleman,
paſſed by her. <hi>Arabella,</hi> thanking Heaven for
ſending this Relief, called out a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> loud as ſhe
could, conjuring him to ſtay.</p>
               <p>The Gentleman, hearing a Woman's Voice,
ſtopped immediately, and aſked what ſhe
wanted.</p>
               <p>Generous Stranger, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> advancing as
well as was ſhe able, do not refuſe your Aſſiſtance
to ſave me from a moſt terrible Danger: I am
purſued by a Perſon whom, for very urgent
Reaſons, I deſire to avoid. I conjure you,
therefore, in the Name of her you love beſt, to
protect me; and may you be crowned with the
Enjoyment of all your Wiſhes, for ſo charitable
an Action!</p>
               <p>If the Gentleman was ſurpriſed at this Addreſs,
he was much more aſtoniſhed at the Beauty of
her who made it: Her Stature; her Shape, her
inimitable Complexion; the Luſtre of her fine
Eyes, and the thouſand Charms that adorned
her whole Perſon, kept him a Minute ſilently
gazing upon her, without having the Power to
make her an Anſwer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> finding he did not ſpeak, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
diſappointed. Ah! Sir, ſaid ſhe,
What do you deliberate upon? Is it poſſible
you can deny ſo reaſonable a Requeſt, to a
Lady in my Circumſtances?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:0005700701:167"/>
For God's ſake, Madam, ſaid the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
alighting, and approaching her, let me
know who you are, and how I can be of any
Service to you.</p>
               <p>As for my Quality, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> be aſſured
it is not mean; and let this Knowlege ſuffice at
preſent: The Service I deſire of you is, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
me to ſome Place where I may be in Safety
for this Night: To-morrow I will intreat you
to let ſome Perſons, whom I ſhall name to you,
know where I am; to the end they may take
proper Meaſures to ſecure me from the Attempts
of an inſolent Man, who has driven me from
my own Houſe, by the Deſigns he was going
to execute.</p>
               <p>The Gentleman ſaw there was ſome Myſtery
in her Caſe, which ſhe did not chooſe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain;
and, being extremely glad at having ſo
beautiful a Creature in his Power, told her ſhe
might command him in all ſhe pleaſed; and,
helping her into the Chaiſe, drove off as faſt as
he could; <hi>Arabella</hi> ſuffering no Apprehenſions
from being alone with a Stranger, ſince nothing
was more common to Heroines than ſuch Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures;
all her Fears being of <hi>Edward,</hi> whom
ſhe fanſied every Moment ſhe ſaw purſuing
them: And, being extremely anxious to be in
ſome Place of Safety, ſhe urged her Protector to
drive as faſt as poſſible; who, willing to have her
at his own Houſe, complied with her Requeſt;
but was ſo unlucky in his Haſte, as to overturn
the Chaiſe. Though neither <hi>Arabella</hi> nor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
were hurt by the Fall, yet the Neceſſity
there was to ſtay ſome time to put the Chaiſe
in a Condition to carry them any farther, filled
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0005700701:168"/>
her with a thouſand Apprehenſions, leſt they
ſhould be overtaken.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the Servants of <hi>Arabella,</hi>
among whom <hi>Edward,</hi> not knowing how much
he was concerned in her Flight, was reſolved
to diſtinguiſh himſelf by his Zeal in ſearching
for her, had diſperſed themſelves about in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Places: Chance conducted <hi>Edward</hi> to
the very Spot where ſhe was: When <hi>Arabella,</hi>
perceiving him while he was two or three
Paces off, Oh! Sir, cried ſhe, behold my
Perſecutor! Can you reſolve to defend me
againſt the Violence he comes to offer me?</p>
               <p>The Gentleman, looking up, and ſeeing a
Man in Livery approaching them, aſked her, If
that was the Perſon ſhe complained of; and
if he was her Servant?</p>
               <p>If he is my Servant, Sir, replied ſhe, bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he never had my Permiſſion to be ſo: And,
indeed, no one elſe can boaſt of my having
granted them ſuch a Liberty.</p>
               <p>Do you know whoſe Servant he is, then,
Madam? replied the Gentleman, a little ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
at her Anſwer; which he could not well
underſtand.</p>
               <p>You throw me into a great Embarraſſment,
Sir, reſumed <hi>Arabella,</hi> bluſhing more than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
Queſtionleſs, he appears to be mine;
but, ſince, as I told you before, he never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
himſelf to me, and I never permitted
him to aſſume that Title, his Services, if ever I
received any from him, were not at all conſidered
by me, as Things for which I was obliged to
him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:0005700701:169"/>
The Gentleman, ſtill more amazed at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
ſo little to the Purpoſe, was going to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
her to explain herſelf upon this ſtrange Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair;
when <hi>Edward,</hi> coming up cloſe to <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi>
cried out in a Tranſport, Oh! Madam!
thank God you are found.</p>
               <p>Hold, impious Man! ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> and do
not give Thanks for that which, haply, may
prove thy Puniſhment. If I am found, thou
wilt be no better for it: And, if thou continueſt
to perſecute me, thou wilt probably meet with
thy Death, where thou thinkeſt thou haſt found
thy Happineſs.</p>
               <p>The poor Fellow, who underſtood not a
Word of this Diſcourſe, ſtared upon her like
one that had loſt his Wits; when the Protector
of <hi>Arabella,</hi> approaching him, aſked him, with
a ſtern Look, What he had to ſay to that
Lady, and why he preſumed to follow her?</p>
               <p>As the Man was going to anſwer him, Mr.
<hi>Glanville</hi> came galloping up; and <hi>Edward,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, ran up to him, and informed him,
that he had met with Lady <hi>Bella,</hi> and a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who ſeemed to have been overturned in a
Chaiſe, which he was endeavouring to refit;
and that her Ladyſhip was offended with him
for coming up to her; and alſo, that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
had uſed ſome threatening Language to
him upon that Account.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> exceſſively ſurpriſed at what
he heard, ſtopped; and, ordering a Servant who
came along with him, to run back to the
Caſtle, and bring a Chaiſe thither to carry Lady
<hi>Bella</hi> home, he aſked <hi>Edward</hi> ſeveral more
Queſtions relating to what ſhe and the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0005700701:170"/>
had ſaid to him: And, notwithſtanding
his Knowlege of her ridiculous Humour, he
could not help being alarmed by her Behaviour,
nor concluding that there was ſomething very
myſterious in the Affair.</p>
               <p>While he was thus converſing with <hi>Edward,
Arabella,</hi> who had ſpied him almoſt as ſoon,
was filled with Apprehenſion to ſee him hold ſo
quiet a Parly with her Raviſher: The more ſhe
reflected upon this Accident, the more her Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicions
increaſed; and, perſuading herſelf at
laſt, that Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> was privy to his
Deſigns, this Belief, however improbable,
wrought ſo powerfully upon her Imagination,
that ſhe could not reſtrain her Tears.</p>
               <p>Doubtleſs, ſaid ſhe, I am betrayed, and the
perjured <hi>Glanville</hi> is no longer either my Friend
or Lover: He is this Moment concerting Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
with my Raviſher, how to deliver me into
his Power; and, like <hi>Philidaſpes,</hi> is glad of an
Opportunity, by this Treachery, to be rid of a
Woman whom his Parents and hers had deſtined
for his Wife.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> having learned all he could
from <hi>Edward,</hi> alighted; and, giving him his
Horſe to hold, came up to <hi>Arabella:</hi> And, after
expreſſing his Joy at meeting with her, begged
her to let him know what Accident had brought
her, unattended, from the Caſtle, at that time
of Night.</p>
               <p>If by this Queſtion, ſaid the incenſed <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi>
you would perſuade me you are ignorant
of the Cauſe of my Flight, know, your Diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
will not ſucceed; and that, having Reaſon
to believe you are equally guilty with him from
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0005700701:171"/>
whoſe intended Violence I fled, I ſhall have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to the Valour of this Knight you ſee with
me, to defend me, as well againſt you, as that
Raviſher, with whom I ſee you leagued.—Ah!
unworthy Couſin, purſued ſhe, What doſt thou
propoſe to thyſelf by ſo black a Treachery?
What is to be the Price of my Liberty, which
thou ſo freely diſpoſeſt of? Has thy Friend
there, ſaid ſhe (pointing to <hi>Edward</hi>), a Siſter,
or any Relation, for whom thou bartereſt, by
delivering me up to him? But, aſſure thyſelf,
this Stratagem ſhall be of no Uſe to thee: For,
if thou art baſe enough to oppreſs my valiant
Deliverer with Numbers, and thinkeſt, by Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
to get me into thy Power, my Cries
ſhall arm Heaven and Earth in my Defence.
Providence may, haply, ſend ſome generous
Cavaliers to my Reſcue; and, if Providence fails
me, my own Hand ſhall give me Freedom; for
that Moment thou offereſt to ſeize me, that
Moment ſhall be the laſt of my Life.</p>
               <p>While <hi>Arabella</hi> was ſpeaking, the young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
and <hi>Edward,</hi> who liſtened to her, eagerly,
thought her Brain was diſturbed: But Mr.
<hi>Glanville</hi> was in a terrible Conſuſion, and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
curſed his ill Fate, to make him in
Love with a Woman ſo ridiculous.</p>
               <p>For Heaven's ſake, Couſin, ſaid he, ſtriving
to repreſs ſome Part of his Diſorder, Do not
give way to theſe extravagant Notions: There is
nobody intends to do you any Wrong.</p>
               <p>What! interrupted ſhe, would you perſuade
me, that that Impoſtor there, pointing to <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi>
has not a Deſign to carry me away;
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0005700701:172"/>
which you, by ſupporting him, are not equally
guilty of?</p>
               <p>Who? I! Madam! cried out <hi>Edward:</hi> Sure
your Ladyſhip does not ſuſpect me of ſuch a
ſtrange Deſign! God knows I never thought of
ſuch a Thing!</p>
               <p>Ah! Diſſembler! interrupted <hi>Arabella,</hi> do
not make uſe of that ſacred Name to maſk thy
impious Falſhoods: Confeſs with what Intent
you came into my Father's Service diſguiſed.</p>
               <p>I never came diſguiſed, Madam, returned
<hi>Edward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No! ſaid <hi>Arabella:</hi> What means that Dreſs
in which I ſee you, then?</p>
               <p>'Tis the Marquis's Livery, Madam, ſaid
<hi>Edward,</hi> which he did not order to be taken
from me when I left his Service.</p>
               <p>And with what Purpoſe didſt thou wear it?
ſaid ſhe, Do not your Thoughts accuſe you of
your Crime?</p>
               <p>I always hoped, Madam—ſaid he.</p>
               <p>You hoped! interrupted <hi>Arabella:</hi> frowning,
Did I ever give you Reaſon to hope? I will not
deny but I had Compaſſion on you; but even
That you was ignorant of.</p>
               <p>I know, Madam, you had Compaſſion on
me, ſaid <hi>Edward;</hi> for your Ladyſhip, I always
thought, did not believe me guilty.</p>
               <p>I was weak enough, ſaid ſhe, to have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
on you, though I <hi>did</hi> believe you guilty.</p>
               <p>Indeed, Madam, returned <hi>Edward,</hi> I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
hoped, as I ſaid before (but your Ladyſhip
would not hear me out), that you did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
any malicious Reports; and therefore you
had Compaſſion on me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:0005700701:173"/>
I had no Reports of you, ſaid ſhe, but what
my own Obſervation gave me; and that was
ſufficient to convince me of your Fault.</p>
               <p>Why, Madam, ſaid <hi>Edward,</hi> did your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
ſee me ſteal the Carp then, which was the
Fault unjuſtly laid to my Charge?</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> as much Cauſe as he had for
Uneaſineſs, could with great Difficulty reſtrain
Laughter at this ludicrous Circumſtance; for he
gueſſed what Crime <hi>Arabella</hi> was accuſing him
of: As for the young Gentleman, he could not
conceive what ſhe meant, and longed to hear
what would be the End of ſuch a ſtrange Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.
But poor <hi>Arabella</hi> was prodigiouſly
confounded at his mentioning ſo low an Affair;
not being able to endure that <hi>Glanville</hi> and
her Protector ſhould know a Lover of her's
could be ſuſpected of ſo baſe a Theft.</p>
               <p>The Shame ſhe conceived at it, kept her
ſilent for a Moment: But, recovering herſelf at
laſt, No, ſaid ſhe, I knew you better than to
give any Credit to ſuch an idle Report: Perſons
of your Condition do not commit ſuch paltry
Crimes.</p>
               <p>Upon my Soul, Madam, ſaid the young
Gentleman, Perſons of his Condition often do
worſe.</p>
               <p>I don't deny it, Sir, ſaid <hi>Arabella;</hi> and the
Deſign he meditated of carrying me away was
infinitely worſe.</p>
               <p>Really, Madam, returned the Gentleman,
if you are ſuch a Perſon as I apprehend, I
don't ſee how he durſt make ſuch an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:0005700701:174"/>
It is very poſſible, Sir, ſaid ſhe, that I might
be carried away, though I was of greater Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
than I am: Were not <hi>Mandana, Candace,
Clelia,</hi> and many other Ladies who underwent
the ſame Fate, of a Quality more illuſtrious
than mine?</p>
               <p>Really, Madam, ſaid he, I know none of
theſe Ladies.</p>
               <p>No, Sir! ſaid <hi>Arabella;</hi> extremely mortified.</p>
               <p>Let me intreat you, Couſin, interrupted <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi>
(who feared this Diſpute would be very
tedious), to expoſe yourſelf no longer to the
Air at this time of Night: Suffer me to conduct
you home.</p>
               <p>It concerns my Honour, ſaid ſhe, that this
generous Stranger ſhould not think I am the
only one that was ever expoſed to theſe inſolent
Attempts. You ſay, Sir, purſued ſhe, that
you don't know any of theſe Ladies I mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before: Let me aſk you, then, If you are
acquainted with <hi>Partheniſſa,</hi> or <hi>Cleopatra?</hi> who
were both, for ſome Months, in the Hands of
their Raviſhers.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Partheniſſa,</hi> Madam, neither have I heard
of her; nor do I remember to have heard of
any more than one <hi>Cleopatra:</hi> But ſhe was never
raviſhed, I am certain; for ſhe was too willing.</p>
               <p>How! Sir, ſaid <hi>Arabella:</hi> Was <hi>Cleopatra</hi>
ever willing to run away with her Raviſher?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cleopatra</hi> was a Whore, was ſhe not, Madam?
ſaid he.</p>
               <p>Hold thy Peace, unworthy Man, ſaid <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella;</hi>
and profane not the Memory of that fair
and glorious Queen, by ſuch injurious Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage:
That Queen, I ſay, whoſe Courage was
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0005700701:175"/>
equal to her Beauty; and her Virtue ſurpaſſed
by neither. Good Heavens! What a black
Defamer have I choſen for my Protector!</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> rejoicing to ſee <hi>Arabella</hi> in a
Diſpoſition to be offended with her new Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
reſolved to ſooth her a little, in
hopes of prevailing upon her to return home.
Sir, ſaid he to the Gentleman, who could not
conceive why the Lady ſhould ſo warmly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
<hi>Cleopatra,</hi> you were in the Wrong to caſt
ſuch Reflections upon that great Queen (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating
what he had heard his Couſin ſay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore):
For all the World, purſued he, knows
ſhe was married to <hi>Julius Caeſar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though I commend you, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> for
taking the Part of a Lady ſo baſely vilified; yet
let not your Zeal for her Honour induce you
to ſay more than is true for its Juſtification;
for thereby you weaken, inſtead of ſtrengthening,
what may be ſaid in her Defence. One
Falſhood always ſuppoſes another, and renders
all you can ſay ſuſpected: Whereas pure, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed
Truth, carries Conviction along with it,
and never fails to produce its deſired Effect.</p>
               <p>Suffer me, Couſin, interrupted <hi>Glanville,</hi> to
repreſent to you, the Inconveniency you will
certainly feel, by ſtaying ſo late in the Air:
Leave the Juſtification of <hi>Cleopatra</hi> to ſome
other Opportunity; and take care of your own
Preſervation.</p>
               <p>What is it you require of me? ſaid <hi>Arabella.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Only, reſumed <hi>Glanville,</hi> that you would be
pleaſed to return to the Caſtle, where my Siſter,
and all your Servants, are inconſolable for your
Abſence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:0005700701:176"/>
But who can aſſure me, anſwered ſhe, that
I ſhall not, by returning home, enter volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
into my Priſon? For, to ſay the Truth,
I ſtill more than ſuſpect you abet the Deſigns
of this Man; ſince I behold you in his Party,
and ready, no doubt, to draw your Sword in
his Defence: How will you be able to clear
yourſelf of this Crime? Yet I will venture to
return to my Houſe, provided you will ſwear
to me, you will offer me no Violence, with
regard to your Friend there: And alſo I inſiſt,
that he, from this Moment, diſclaim all Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of perſecuting me, and baniſh himſelf
from my Preſence for ever. Upon this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
I pardon him, and will likewiſe pray to
Heaven to pardon him alſo. Speak, preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Unknown, ſaid ſhe to <hi>Edward,</hi> Wilt
thou accept of my Pardon upon the Terms I
offer it thee? And wilt thou take thyſelf to ſome
Place where I may never behold thee again?</p>
               <p>Since your Ladyſhip, ſaid <hi>Edward,</hi> is reſolved
not to receive me into your Service, I ſhan't
trouble you any more: But I think it hard to
be puniſhed for a Crime I was not guilty of.</p>
               <p>'Tis better, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> turning from him,
that thou ſhouldſt complain of my Rigour, than
the World tax me with Lightneſs and Indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And now, Sir, ſaid ſhe to <hi>Glanville,</hi> I
muſt truſt myſelf to your Honour, which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
I do a little ſuſpect: But, however, 'tis
poſſible you have repented, like the poor Prince
<hi>Thraſybulus,</hi> when he ſubmitted to the Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions
of a wicked Friend, to carry away the
fair <hi>Alcionida,</hi> whom he afterwards reſtored.
Speak, <hi>Glanville,</hi> purſued ſhe, are you deſirous
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0005700701:177"/>
of imitating that virtuous Prince, or do you
ſtill retain your former Sentiments?</p>
               <p>Upon my Word, Madam, ſaid <hi>Glanville,</hi>
you will make me quite mad, if you go on in
this manner: Pray let me ſee you ſafe home;
and then, if you pleaſe, you may forbid my
Entrance into the Caſtle, if you ſuſpect me of
any bad Intentions towards you.</p>
               <p>'Tis enough, ſaid ſhe; I will truſt you. As
for you, Sir, ſpeaking to the young Gentleman,
you are ſo unworthy, in my Apprehenſions, by
the Calumnies you have uttered againſt a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of that Sex which merits all your Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Reverence, that I hold you very unfit
to be a Protector of any of it: Therefore I
diſpenſe with your Services upon this Occaſion;
and think it better to truſt myſelf to the Conduct
of a Perſon, who, like <hi>Thraſybulus,</hi> by his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
has reſtored himſelf to my Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
than to one, who, though, indeed, he
has never betrayed me, yet ſeems very capable
of doing ſo, if he had the Power.</p>
               <p>Saying this, ſhe gave her Hand to <hi>Glanville,</hi>
who helped her into the Chaiſe that was come
from the Caſtle; and the Servant, who brought
it, mounting his Horſe, Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> drove
her Home, leaving the Gentleman, who, by
this time, had refitted his Chaiſe, in the
greateſt Aſtoniſhment imaginable at her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable
Behaviour.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>RABELLA,</hi> continuing to rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
upon her Adventure during
their little Journey, appeared ſo
low and reſerved, that Mr. <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
tho' he ardently wiſhed to
know all the Particulars of her Flight, and
Meeting with that Gentleman, whoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
he found her in, was obliged to ſuppreſs
his Curioſity for the preſent, out of a Fear of
diſpleaſing her. As ſoon as they alighted at the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0005700701:179"/>
Caſtle, her Servants ran to receive her at the
Gates, expreſſing their Joy to ſee her again, by
a thouſand confuſed Exclamations.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> being at her Toilet when ſhe
heard of her Arrival, ran down to welcome her,
in her Hurry forgetting, that as her Woman had
been curling her Hair, ſhe had no Cap on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella</hi> received her Compliments with a
little Coolneſs; for, obſerving that her Grief
for her Abſence had not made her neglect any
of her uſual Solicitude about her Perſon, ſhe
could not conceive it had been very great: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
when ſhe had made ſome ſlight Anſwer
to the hundred Queſtions ſhe aſked in a Breath,
ſhe went up to her Apartment; and, calling
<hi>Lucy,</hi> who was crying with Joy for her Return,
ſhe queſtioned her ſtrictly concerning her
leaving her in the Fields, acknowleging to
her, that ſhe ſuſpected her Fidelity, tho' ſhe
wiſhed, at the ſame time, ſhe might be able to
clear herſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucy,</hi> in her Juſtification, related, after her
punctual Way, all that had happened: By
which, <hi>Arabella</hi> was convinced ſhe had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
her; and was alſo in ſome Doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> was guilty of any Deſign
againſt her.</p>
               <p>Since, ſaid ſhe to <hi>Lucy,</hi> thou art reſtored to
my good Opinion, I will, as I have always
done, unmaſk my Thoughts to thee. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
then, with Shame and Confuſion, that I
cannot think of Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi>'s aſſiſting the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to carry me away, without <hi>reſenting</hi> a
moſt poignant Grief: Queſtionleſs, my Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
will ſurpriſe thee; and could I conceal it
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0005700701:180"/>
from myſelf, I would from thee; but, alas! it is
certain, that I do not hate him; and I believe
I never ſhall, guilty as he may be in my Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions.</p>
               <p>Hate him! Madam, ſaid <hi>Lucy:</hi> God forbid
you ſhould ever hate Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> who, I am
ſure, loves your Ladyſhip as well as he does his
own Siſter!</p>
               <p>You are very confident, <hi>Lucy,</hi> ſaid <hi>Arabella</hi>
bluſhing, to mention the Word Love to me:
If I thought my Couſin had bribed thee to it, I
ſhould be greatly incenſed: However, tho' I
forbid you to talk of his Paſſion, yet I permit
you to tell me the Violence of his Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
when I was miſſing; the Threats he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
againſt my Raviſhers; the Complaints
he made againſt Fortune; the Vows he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
for my Preſervation; and, in fine,
whatever Extravagances the Exceſs of his Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
forced him to commit.</p>
               <p>I aſſure you, Madam, ſaid <hi>Lucy,</hi> I did not
hear him ſay any of all this.</p>
               <p>What! interrupted <hi>Arabella:</hi> And didſt thou
not obſerve the Tears trickle from his Eyes,
which, haply, he ſtrove to conceal? Did he
not ſtrike his Boſom with the Vehemence of
his Grief; and caſt his accuſing and deſpairing
Eyes to Heaven, which had permitted ſuch a
Misfortune to befal me?</p>
               <p>Indeed, Madam, I did not, reſumed <hi>Lucy;</hi>
but he ſeemed to be very ſorry; and ſaid, He
would go and look for your Ladyſhip.</p>
               <p>Ah! the Traitor! interrupted <hi>Arabella</hi> in a
Rage: Fain would I have found out ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
for him, and juſtified him in my Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions;
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0005700701:181"/>
but he is unworthy of theſe ſavourable
Thoughts: Speak of him no more, I command
you; he is guilty of aſſiiſting my Raviſher to
carry me away; and therefore merits my eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Diſpleaſure: But tho' I could find Reaſons
to clear him even of that Crime, yet he is guilty
of Indifference and Inſenſibility for my Loſs,
ſince he neither died with Grief at the News of
it; nor needed the Interpoſition of his Siſter, or
the Deſire of delivering me, to make him live.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> when ſhe had ſaid this, was ſilent;
but could not prevent ſome Tears ſtealing down
her fair Face: Therefore, to conceal her Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs,
or to be at more Liberty to indulge it,
ſhe ordered <hi>Lucy</hi> to make haſte and undreſs
her; and, going To-bed, paſſed the ſmall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
of the Night, not in Reſt, which ſhe
very much needed, but, in Reflections on all
the Paſſages of the preceding Day: And, finding,
or imagining ſhe found, new Reaſons for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> her Mind was very
far from being at Eaſe.</p>
               <p>In the Morning, lying later than uſual, ſhe
received a Meſſage from Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
after her Health; to which ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
That he was too little concerned in the
Preſervation of it, to make it neceſſary to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
him.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> ſoon after ſent to deſire Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to drink her Chocolate by her Bedſide;
which as ſhe could not in Civility refuſe, ſhe
was very much perplexed how to hide her Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancholy
from the Eyes of that diſcerning Lady,
who, ſhe queſtioned not, would interpret it
in favour of her Brother.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:0005700701:182"/>
Upon Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi>'s Appearance, ſhe forced
herſelf to aſſume a chearful Look, aſking her
Pardon, for receiving her in Bed; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
of bad Reſt, which had occaſioned her
lying late.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> after anſwering her Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
with almoſt equal Politeneſs, proceeded
to aſk her an hundred Queſtions concerning
the Cauſe of her Abſence from the Caſtle: Your
Woman, purſued ſhe, laughing, told us a ſtrange
Medley of Stuff about a great Man, who was a
Gardener; and wanted to carry you away:
Sure there was nothing in it! Was there?</p>
               <p>You muſt excuſe me, Couſin, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi>
if I do not anſwer your Queſtions preciſely now:
'Tis ſufficient that I tell you, Certain Reaſons
obliged me to act in the Manner I did, for my
own Preſervation; and that, another time, you
ſhall know my Hiſtory; which will explain
many things you ſeem to be ſurpriſed at, at
preſent.</p>
               <p>Your Hiſtory, ſaid Miſs <hi>Glanville!</hi> Why,
will you write your own Hiſtory then?</p>
               <p>I ſhall not write it, ſaid <hi>Arabella;</hi> tho', que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſs,
it will be written after my Death.</p>
               <p>And muſt I wait till then for it, reſumed
Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> gaily?</p>
               <p>No, no, interrupted <hi>Arabella:</hi> I mean to
gratify your Curioſity ſooner; but it will not be
yet a good time; and, haply, not till you have
acquainted me with yours.</p>
               <p>Mine! ſaid Miſs <hi>Glanville:</hi> It would not be
worth your hearing; for really I have nothing
to tell, that would make an Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:0005700701:183"/>
You have, queſtionleſs, returned <hi>Arabella,</hi>
gained many Victories over Hearts; have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
many Quarrels between your Servants,
by favouring ſome one, more than the others:
Probably, you have cauſed ſome Bloodſhed;
and have not eſcaped being carried away once
or twice: You have alſo, I ſuppoſe, undergone
ſome Perſecution, from thoſe who have the
Diſpoſal of you, in Favour of a Lover whom
you have an Averſion to; and laſtly, there is
haply ſome one among your Admirers, who
is happy enough not to be hated by you.</p>
               <p>I aſſure you, interrupted Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> I hate
none of my Admirers; and I can't help think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you very unkind to uſe my Brother as you
do: I am ſure, there is not one Man in an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
that would take ſo much from your Hands
as he does.</p>
               <p>Then there is not one Man in an hundred,
reſumed <hi>Arabella,</hi> whom I ſhould think worthy
to ſerve me: But, pray, Madam, What ill
Uſage is it your Brother complains of? I have
treated him with much leſs Severity than he had
Reaſon to expect; and, notwithſtanding he had
the Preſumption to talk to me of Love, I have
endured him in my Sight; an Indulgence, for
which I may haply be blamed in After-ages.</p>
               <p>Why, ſure, Lady <hi>Bella,</hi> ſaid Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi>
it would be no ſuch Crime for my Brother to
love you!</p>
               <p>But it was a mortal Crime to tell me ſo, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
<hi>Arabella.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And why was it ſuch a mortal Crime to tell
you ſo, ſaid Miſs <hi>Glanville?</hi> Are you the firſt
Woman by Millions, that has been told ſo?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:0005700701:184"/>
Doubtleſs, returned <hi>Arabella,</hi> I am the firſt
Woman of my Quality, that ever was told ſo
by any Man, till after an infinite Number of
Services, and ſecret Sufferings: And truly, I
am of the illuſtrious <hi>Mandana</hi>'s Mind; for ſhe
ſaid, That ſhe ſhould think it an unpardonable
Preſumption, for the greateſt King on Earth to
tell her he loved her, tho' after Ten Years of the
moſt faithful Services, and concealed Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>Ten Years! cried out Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> in
Amazement; Did ſhe conſider what Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
ten Years would make in her Face, and
how much older ſhe would be at the End of
Ten Years, than ſhe was before?</p>
               <p>Truly, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> it is not uſual to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſuch little Matters ſo nicely; one never has
the Idea of an Heroine older than Eighteen,
tho' her Hiſtory begins at that Age; and the
Events, which compoſe it, contain the Space
of Twenty more.</p>
               <p>But, dear Couſin, reſumed Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi>
do you reſolve to be Ten Years a courting? Or
rather, will you be loved in Silence Ten Years,
and be courted the other Ten; and ſo marry
when you are an old Woman?</p>
               <p>Pardon me, Couſin, reſumed <hi>Arabella;</hi> I
muſt really find Fault with the Coarſeneſs of
your Language. Courting, and Old Woman!
What ſtrange Terms! Let us, I beſeech you,
end this Diſpute: If you have any thing to ſay in
Juſtification of your Brother, which, I ſuppoſe,
was the chief Intention of your Viſit, I ſhall not
be rude enough to reſtrain you; tho' I could
wiſh you would not lay me under the Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0005700701:185"/>
of hearing what I cannot perſuade myſelf
to believe.</p>
               <p>Since, returned Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> I know of
no Crime my Brother has been guilty of, I have
nothing to ſay in his Juſtification: I only know,
that he is very much mortified at the Meſſage
you ſent him this Morning; for I was with him
when he received it: But pray, What has he
done to offend you?</p>
               <p>If Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> interrupted <hi>Arabella,</hi> hopes
for my Pardon, he muſt purchaſe it by his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and a ſincere Confeſſion of his Fault;
which you may much better underſtand from
himſelf, than from me: And, for this Purpoſe,
I will condeſcend to grant him a private Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
at which I deſire you would be preſent;
and alſo, I ſhould take it well, if you will let
him know, that he owes this Favour wholly to
your Interpoſition.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> who knew her Brother was
extremely deſirous of ſeeing <hi>Arabella,</hi> was glad
to accept of theſe ſtrange Terms; and left her
Chamber, in order to acquaint him with that
Lady's Intentions.</p>
            </div>

               <argument>
                  <p>A ſolemn Interview.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN the mean time, that Fair-one, being riſen,
and negligently dreſſed, as was her Cuſtom,
went into her Cloſet, ſending to give Miſs
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0005700701:186"/>
                  <hi>Glanville</hi> Notice, That ſhe was ready to ſee her.
This Meſſage immediately brought both the
Brother and the Siſter to her Apartment: And
Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> at her Brother's Requeſt, ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Chamber, where ſhe buſied herſelf
in looking at her Couſin's Jewels, which lay
upon the Toilet, he came alone into the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet,
in ſo much Confuſion at the Thoughts of
the ridiculous Figure he made in complying
with <hi>Arabella</hi>'s fantaſtical Humours, that his
Looks perſuading her, there was ſome great
Agitation in his Mind, ſhe expected to ſee him
fall at her Feet, and endeavour to deprecate
her Wrath by a Deluge of Tears.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> however diſappointed her in
that reſpect; for, taking a Seat near her, he
began to intreat, her with a ſmiling Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
to tell him in what he had offended her;
proteſting, that he was not conſcious of doing
or ſaying any thing to diſpleaſe her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella</hi> was greatly confuſed at this Queſtion,
which ſhe thought ſhe had no Reaſon to expect;
it not being poſſible for her to tell him ſhe was
offended, that he was not in abſolute Deſpair for
her Abſence, without, at the ſame time, confeſſing
ſhe looked upon him in the Light of a Lover,
whoſe Expreſſions of a violent Paſſion would not
have diſpleaſed her: Therefore, to diſengage
herſelf from the Perplexity his Queſtion threw
her into, ſhe was obliged to offer ſome Violence
to her Ingenuouſneſs; and, contrary to her real
Belief, tax him again with a Deſign of betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her into the Power of the Unknown.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> tho' exceſſively vexed at her
perſiſting in ſo ridiculous an Error, could hardly
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0005700701:187"/>
help ſmiling at the ſtern Manner in which ſhe
ſpoke; but, knowing of what fatal Conſequence
it would be to him, if he indulged any Gaiety
in ſo ſolemn a Conference, he compoſed his
Looks to a Gravity ſuitable to the Occaſion;
and aſked her, in a very ſubmiſſive Tone, What
Motive ſhe was pleaſed to aſſign for ſo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
a Piece of Villainy, as that ſhe ſuppoſed
him guilty of?</p>
               <p>Truly, anſwered ſhe, bluſhing, I do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to account for the Actions of wicked and
ungenerous Perſons.</p>
               <p>But, Madam, reſumed <hi>Glanville,</hi> if I muſt needs
be ſuſpected of a Deſign to ſeize upon your Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
methinks it would have been more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
to ſuppoſe, I would rather uſe that Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
in Favour of my own Pretenſions, than
thoſe of any other whatever; for, tho' you have
expreſly forbid me to tell you I love you, yet
I hope, you ſtill continue to think I do.</p>
               <p>I aſſure you, returned <hi>Arabella,</hi> aſſuming a
ſevere Look, I never gave myſelf the Trouble to
examine your Behaviour with Care enough to
be ſenſible, if you ſtill were guilty of the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
which diſpleaſed me; but, upon a Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
that you repented of your Fault, I was
willing to live with you upon Terms of Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and Friendſhip, as became Perſons in that
Degree of Relationſhip in which we are: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
if you are wiſe, you will not renew the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of thoſe Follies I have long ſince
pardoned; nor ſeek Occaſions of offending me
by new ones of the ſame kind, leſt it produce a
more ſevere Sentence than that I formerly laid
upon you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:0005700701:188"/>
However, Madam, returned Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi>
you muſt ſuffer me to aſſure you, That my own
Intereſt, which was greatly concerned in your
Safety, and my Principles of Honour, would
never allow me to engage in ſo villainous an
Enterprize, as that of abetting any Perſon in
ſtealing you away: Nor can I conceive, how
you poſſibly could imagine a Fellow, who was
your menial Servant, could form ſo preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
and dangerous a Deſign.</p>
               <p>By your Manner of ſpeaking, reſumed <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi>
one would imagine you were really igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
both of the Quality of that preſumptuous
Man, as well as his deſigned Offence: But
yet, 'tis certain, I ſaw you in his Company;
and ſaw you ready to draw your Sword in his
Defence, againſt my Deliverer. Had I not the
Evidence of my own Senſes, for your Guilt, I
muſt confeſs, I could not be perſuaded of it by
any other Means: Therefore, ſince Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
are certainly againſt you, it is not ſtrange, if
I cannot conſent to acquit you in my Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
till I have more certain Confirmation of
your Innocence, than your bare Teſtimony only;
which, at preſent, has not all the Weight with
me it had ſome time ago.</p>
               <p>I proteſt, Madam, ſaid Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> who
was ſtrangely perplexed, I have Reaſon to think
my Caſe extremely hard, ſince I have brought
myſelf to be ſuſpected by you, only through my
Eagerneſs to find you, and Solicitude for your
Welfare.</p>
               <p>Doubtleſs, interrupted <hi>Arabella,</hi> if you are
innocent, your Caſe is extremely hard; yet
it is not ſingular; and therefore you have
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0005700701:189"/>
leſs Reaſon to complain: The valiant <hi>Corio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanus,</hi>
who was the moſt paſſionate and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Lover imaginable, having, by his admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Valour, aſſiſted the Raviſhers of his adored
<hi>Cleopatra,</hi> againſt thoſe who came to reſcue her;
and, by his Arm alone, oppoſed to great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of their Enemies, facilitated the Execuion
of their Deſign, had the Mortification after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to know, that he had, all that time,
been fighting againſt that Divine Princeſs, who
loaded him with the moſt cruel Reproaches for
the Injury he had done her: Yet Fortune was
ſo kind, as to give him the Means of repairing
his Fault, and reſtoring him to ſome Part of
her good Opinion; for, covered with Wounds
as he was, and fatigued with fighting, before,
yet he undertook, in that Condition, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
her Raviſhers from carrying her off; and,
for ſeveral Hours, continued fighting alone with
near Two hundred Men, who were not able to
overcome him, notwithſtanding his extreme
Wearineſs, and the Multitude of Blows which
they aimed at him: Therefore, <hi>Glanville,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
you, as <hi>Cleopatra</hi> did that unfortunate
Prince, who was before ſuſpected by her, as
neither guilty nor innocent, I can only, like her,
wiſh you may find ſome Occaſion of juſtifying
yourſelf, from the Crime laid to your Charge:
Till then, I muſt be under a Neceſſity of baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you from my Preſence, with the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolatory
Speech ſhe uſed to that unfortunate
Prince:—<q>Go, therefore, <hi>Glanville,</hi> go, and
endeavour your own Juſtification; I deſire
you ſhould effect it, no leſs than you do your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
and, if my Prayers can obtain from
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0005700701:190"/>
Heaven this Favour for you, I ſhall not

theſe Words, bluſhed exceſſively, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſhe had ſaid too much: But, not ſeeing
any Signs of extreme Joy in the Face of <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
who was ſilently curſing <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and
the Authors of thoſe Romances, that had ruined
ſo noble a Mind; and expoſed him to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Vexations, by the unaccountable Whims
they had raiſed—Why are you not gone, ſaid
ſhe, while I am in an Humour not to repent of
the Favour I have ſhewn you?</p>
               <p>You muſt excuſe me, Couſin, ſaid Mr.
<hi>Glanville,</hi> peeviſhly, if I do not think ſo highly
as you do of the Favour. Pray how am I
obliged to you for depriving me of the Pleaſure
of ſeeing you, and ſending me on a Wild-gooſe
Chace, after Occaſions to juſtify myſelf of a
Crime I am wholly innocent of, and would
ſcorn to commit?</p>
               <p>Though, reſumed <hi>Arabella,</hi> with great Calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
I have Reaſon to be diſſatisfied with the
cool and unthankful manner in which you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0005700701:191"/>
my Indulgence, yet I ſhall not change the
favourable Diſpoſition I am in towards you, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
you provoke me to it by new Acts of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience:
Therefore, in the Language of
<hi>Cleopatra,</hi> I ſhall tell you.—</p>
               <p>Upon my Soul, Madam, interrupted <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
I have no Patience with that rigorous
Gipſy, whoſe Example you follow ſo exactly,
to my Sorrow: Speak in your own Language,
I beſeech you; for I am ſure neither hers,
nor any one's upon Earth, can excel it.</p>
               <p>Yet, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> ſtriving to repreſs ſome
Inclination to ſmile at this Sally, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your unjuſt Prohibitions, I ſhall make uſe
of the Language of that incomparable Lady, to
tell you my Thoughts; which are, That 'tis
poſſible you might be ſufficiently juſtified in my
Apprehenſions, by the Anxiety it now appears
you had for my Safety, by the Probability which
I find in your Diſcourſe, and the good Opinion
I have of you, were it not requiſite to make
your Innocence apparent to the World, that ſo
it might be lawful for <hi>Arabella</hi> to readmit you,
with Honour, into her former Eſteem and
Friendſhip.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> ſeeing it would be in vain to
attempt to make her alter her fantaſtical Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
at this time, went out of the Cloſet
without deigning to make any Reply to his
Sentence, though delivered in the Language of
the admirable <hi>Cleopatra:</hi> But his ill Humour
was ſo viſible in his Face, that <hi>Arabella,</hi> who
miſtook it for an Exceſs of Deſpair, could not
help feeling ſome kind of Pity for the Rigour
which the Laws of Honour and Romance
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0005700701:192"/>
obliged her to uſe him with. And, while ſhe
ſat meditating upon the Scene which had
juſt paſſed, Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> returned to his own
Room, glad that his Siſter, not being in <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi>'s
Chamber, where he had left her, had no
Opportunity of obſerving his Diſcontent, which
ſhe would not fail to inquire the Cauſe of.</p>
               <p>Here he ſat, ruminating upon the Follies of
<hi>Arabella,</hi> which he found grew more glaring
every Day: Every thing furniſhed Matter for
ſome new Extravagance; her Character was ſo
ridiculous, that he could propoſe nothing to
himſelf but eternal Shame and Diſquiet, in the
Poſſeſſion of a Woman, for whom he muſt
always bluſh, and be in Pain. But her Beauty
had made a deep Impreſſion on his Heart: He
admired the Strength of her Underſtanding;
her lively Wit; the Sweetneſs of her Temper;
and a Thouſand amiable Qualities which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed
her from the reſt of her Sex: Her
Follies, when oppoſed to all thoſe Charms of
Mind and Perſon, ſeemed inconſiderable and
weak; and, though they were capable of giving
him great Uneaſineſs, yet they could not leſſen
a Paſſion which every Sight of her ſo much
the more confirmed.</p>
               <p>As he ſeared it was impoſſible to help loving
her, his Happineſs depended upon curing her of
her romantic Notions; and, though he knew
not how to effect ſuch a Change in her as was
neceſſary to complete it, yet he would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair,
but comſorted himſelf with Hopes of
what he had not Courage to attempt. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he fanſied Company, and an Acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with the World, would produce the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0005700701:193"/>
he wiſhed: Yet he dreaded to ſee her
expoſed to Ridicule by her fantaſtical Behaviour,
and become the Jeſt of Perſons who were not
poſſeſſed of half her Underſtanding.</p>
               <p>While he traverſed his Chamber, wholly
engroſſed by theſe Reflections, Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi>
was entertaining Sir <hi>George,</hi> of whoſe coming
ſhe was informed while ſhe was in <hi>Arabella</hi>'s
Chamber.</p>

                  <p>In which our Heroine is greatly diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>MISS <hi>Glanville,</hi> ſuppoſing her Brother
would be glad not to be interrupted in
his Conference with Lady <hi>Bella,</hi> did not allow
any one to acquaint them with Sir <hi>George</hi>'s
Viſit; and, telling the Baronet her Couſin was
indiſpoſed, had, by theſe means, all his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
to herſelf.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>George,</hi> who ardently wiſhed to ſee Lady
<hi>Bella,</hi> protracted his Viſit, in hopes that he
ſhould have that Satisfaction before he went
away. And that fair Lady, whoſe Thoughts
were a little diſcompoſed by the Deſpair ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> was in, and fearful of
the Conſequences, when ſhe had ſat ſome time
after he left her, ruminating upon what had
happened, quitted her Cloſet, to go and inquire
of Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> in what Condition his Mind
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0005700701:194"/>
ſeemed to be when he went away; for ſhe never
doubted but that he was gone, like <hi>Coriolanus,</hi>
to ſeek out for ſome Occaſion to manifeſt his
Innocence.</p>
               <p>Hearing, therefore, the Voice of that Lady,
who was talking and laughing very loud in one
of the Summer-parlours, and being terrified
with the Apprehenſion, that it was her Brother
with whom ſhe was thus diverting herſelf, ſhe
opened the Door of the Room precipitately;
and, by her Entrance, filled Sir <hi>George</hi> with
extreme Pleaſure; while her unexpected Sight
produced a quite contrary Effect on Miſs <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> eaſed of her Fear, that it was Mr.
<hi>Glanville,</hi> who, inſtead of dying with Deſpair,
was giving Occaſion for that noiſy Laugh of his
Siſter, ſaluted the Baronet with great Civility;
and, turning to Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> I muſt needs
chide you, ſaid ſhe, for the Inſenſibility with
which it appears you have parted with your
Brother.</p>
               <p>Bleſs me, Madam, interrupted Miſs <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
what do you mean? Whither is my Brother
gone?</p>
               <p>That, indeed, I am quite ignorant of, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
<hi>Arabella;</hi> and I ſuppoſe he himſelf hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
knows what Courſe he ſhall take: But he has
been with you, doubtleſs, to take his Leave.</p>
               <p>Take his Leave! repeated Miſs <hi>Glanville:</hi>
Has he left the Caſtle ſo ſuddenly then, and
gone away without me?</p>
               <p>The Enterprize upon which he is gone, ſaid
<hi>Arabella,</hi> would not admit of a Lady's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany:
And, ſince he has left ſo conſiderable an
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0005700701:195"/>
Hoſtage with me as yourſelf, I expect he will
not be long before he return; and, I hope, to
the Satisfaction of us both.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> who could not penetrate into
the Meaning of her Couſin's Words, began to
be ſtrangely alarmed: But, preſently, ſuppoſing
ſhe had a mind to divert herſelf with her Fears,
ſhe recovered herſelf, and told her ſhe would go
up to her Brother's Chamber, and look for him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella</hi> did not offer to prevent her, being
very deſirous of knowing, whether he had not
left a Letter for her upon his Table, as was the
Cuſtom in thoſe Caſes: And, while ſhe was
gone, Sir <hi>George</hi> ſeized the Opportunity of ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an hundred gallant Things to her, which
ſhe received with great Indifference; the moſt
extravagant Compliments being what ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from all Men: And, provided they did
not directly preſume to tell her they loved her,
no Sort of Flattery or Adulation could diſpleaſe
her.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> having
found her Brother in his Chamber, repeated to
him what Lady <hi>Bella</hi> had ſaid, as ſhe ſuppoſed,
to fright her.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> hearing this, and that Sir
<hi>George</hi> was with her, haſtened to them as faſt
as poſſible, that he might interrupt the fooliſh
Stories he did not doubt ſhe was telling.</p>
               <p>Upon Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi>'s Appearance with her
Brother, <hi>Arabella</hi> was aſtoniſhed.</p>
               <p>I apprehended, Sir, ſaid ſhe, that you were
ſome Miles from the Caſtle by this time: But
your Delay and Indifference convince me, you
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0005700701:196"/>
neither expect nor wiſh to find the means of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
juſtified in my Opinion.</p>
               <p>Pray, Couſin, interrupted <hi>Glanville</hi> (ſpeaking
ſoftly to her), let us leave this Diſpute to ſome
other time.</p>
               <p>No, Sir, reſumed ſhe, aloud, my Honour is
concerned in your Juſtification: Nor is it fit I
ſhould ſubmit to have the Appearance of Amity
for a Perſon who has not yet ſufficiently cleared
himſelf of a Crime, with too much Reaſon laid
to his Charge. Did <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> think you, act
in this manner? Ah! if he had, doubtleſs,
<hi>Cleopatra</hi> would never have pardoned him: Nor
will I any longer ſuffer you to give me repeated
Cauſes of Diſcontent.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>George,</hi> ſeeing Confuſion in Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi>'s
Countenance, and Rage in <hi>Arabella</hi>'s, began to
think, that what he had at firſt took for a Jeſt,
was a ſerious Quarrel between them, at which
it was not proper he ſhould be preſent; and was
preparing to go: When <hi>Arabella,</hi> ſtopping him
with a graceful Action—</p>
               <p>If, noble Stranger, ſaid ſhe, you are ſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
to the Failings of a Friend, that you will
undertake to defend any unjuſtifiable Action he
may be guilty of, you are at Liberty to depart:
But, if you will promiſe to be an unprejudiced
Hearer of the Diſpute between Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi>
and myſelf, you ſhall know the Adventure
which has given Riſe to it; and will be Judge
of the Reaſonableneſs of the Commands I have
laid on him.</p>
               <p>Though, Madam, ſaid Sir <hi>George</hi> (bowing
very low to her), Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> is my Friend,
yet there is no Likelihood I ſhall eſpouſe his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0005700701:197"/>
againſt yours: And a very ſtrong Prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
I feel in Favour of you, already per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuades
me, that I ſhall give Sentence on your
Side, ſince you have honoured me ſo far, as to
conſtitute me Judge of this Difference.</p>
               <p>The ſolemn Manner in which Sir <hi>George</hi>
(who began to ſuſpect Lady <hi>Bella</hi>'s peculiar
Turn) ſpoke this, pleaſed her infinitely; while
Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> vexed as he was, could hardly
forbear laughing: When <hi>Arabella,</hi> after a Look
of Approbation to Sir <hi>George,</hi> replied;</p>
               <p>I find I have unwillingly engaged myſelf to
more than I firſt intended: For, to enable you
to judge clearly of the Matter in Diſpute, 'tis
neceſſary you ſhould know my whole Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> at this Word, not being able
to conſtrain himſelf, uttered a Groan, of the
ſame Nature with thoſe which are often heard in
the Pit at the Repreſentation of a new Play.
Sir <hi>George</hi> underſtood him perfectly well; yet
ſeemed ſurpriſed: And <hi>Arabella,</hi> ſtarting up,</p>
               <p>Since, ſaid ſhe, I have given you no new
Cauſe of Complaint, pray, from whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
this Increaſe of Affliction?</p>
               <p>I aſſure you, Couſin, anſwered he, my Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
if you pleaſe to term it ſo, increaſes
every Day; and I believe it will make me mad
at laſt: For this unaccountable Humour of
yours is not to be borne.</p>
               <p>You do not ſeem, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> to be far
from Madneſs already: And if your Friend
here, upon hearing the Paſſages between us,
ſhould pronounce you guilty, I ſhall be at a
Loſs, whether I ought to treat you as a Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
or a Criminal. Sir, added ſhe, turning
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0005700701:198"/>
to Sir <hi>George,</hi> you will excuſe me, if, for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Reaſons, I can neither give you my Hiſtory
myſelf, nor be preſent at the Relation of it: One
of my Women, who is moſt in my Confidence,
ſhall acquaint you with all the Particulars of
my Life: After which I expect Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi>
will abide by your Deciſion, as, I aſſure myſelf,
I ſhall be contented to do.</p>
               <p>Saying this, ſhe went out of the Parlour, in
order to prepare <hi>Lucy</hi> for the Recital ſhe was to
make.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> reſolving not to be preſent at
this new Abſurdity, ran out after her; and
went into the Garden, with a ſtrong Inclination
to hate the lovely Viſionary who gave him ſuch
perpetual Uneaſineſs; leaving his Siſter alone
with the Baronet, who diverted herſelf extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with the Thoughts of hearing her Couſin's
Hiſtory; aſſuring the Baronet, that he might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
ſomething very curious in it, and find Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſufficient to laugh at; for ſhe was the moſt
whimſical Woman in the World.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>George,</hi> who reſolved to profit by the
Knowlege of her Foible, made very little Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi>'s Sneers; but waited pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
for the promiſed Hiſtory, which was

                  <p>Some curious Inſtructions for relating an

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>ARABELLA,</hi> as ſoon as ſhe left them,
went up to her Apartment; and, calling
<hi>Lucy</hi> into her Cloſet, told her that ſhe had
made Choice of her, ſince ſhe was beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with her Thoughts, to relate her
Hiſtory to her Couſins, and a Perſon of Quality
who was with them.</p>
               <p>Sure your Ladyſhip jeſts with me, ſaid <hi>Lucy:</hi>
How can I make a Hiſtory about your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip?</p>
               <p>There is no Occaſion, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> for
you to make a Hiſtory: There are Accidents
enough in my Life to afford Matter for a long
one: All you have to do is to relate them as
exactly as poſſible. You have lived with me
from my Childhood, and are inſtructed in all
my Adventures; ſo that you muſt be certainly
very capable of executing the Taſk I have ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
you with.</p>
               <p>Indeed, ſaid <hi>Lucy,</hi> I muſt beg your Ladyſhip
will excuſe me: I never could tell how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
a Story when I have read it; and I know
it is not ſuch ſimple Girls as I can tell Hiſtories:
It is only ſit for Clerks, and ſuch Sort of People,
that are very learned.</p>
               <p>You are learned enough for that Purpoſe, ſaid
<hi>Arabella;</hi> and, if you make ſo much Difficulty
in performing this Part of your Duty, pray how
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0005700701:200"/>
came you to imagine you were fit for my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and the Diſtinction I have favoured you
with? Did you ever hear of any Woman that
refuſed to relate her Lady's Story, when deſired?
Therefore, if you hope to poſſeſs my Favour
and Confidence any longer, acquit yourſelf
handſomely of this Taſk, to which I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucy,</hi> terrified at the Diſpleaſure ſhe ſaw in
her Lady's Countenance, begged her to tell
her what ſhe muſt ſay.</p>
               <p>Well! exclaimed <hi>Arabella:</hi> I am certainly
the moſt unfortunate Woman in the World!
Every thing happens to me in a contrary manner
from any other Perſon! Here, inſtead of my
deſiring you to ſoften thoſe Parts of my Hiſtory
where you have greateſt room to flatter; and
to conceal, if poſſible, ſome of thoſe Diſorders
my Beauty has occaſioned; you aſk me to tell
you what you muſt ſay; as if it was not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
you ſhould know as well as myſelf, and be
able, not only to recount all my Words and
Actions, even the ſmalleſt and moſt inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
but alſo all my Thoughts, however in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantaneous;
relate exactly every Change of my
Countenance; number all my Smiles, Half-ſmiles,
Bluſhes, Turnings pale, Glances, Pauſes,
Full-ſtops, Interruptions; the Riſe and Falling
of my Voice; every Motion of my Eyes; and
every Geſture which I have uſed for theſe Ten
Years paſt; nor omit the ſmalleſt Circumſtance
that relates to me.</p>
               <p>Lord bleſs me! Madam, ſaid <hi>Lucy,</hi> exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively
aſtoniſhed, I never, till this Moment,
it ſeems, knew the hundredth thouſandth Part
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0005700701:201"/>
of what was expected from me: I am ſure, if I
had, I would never have gone to Service; for I
might well know I was not fit for ſuch Slavery.</p>
               <p>There is no ſuch great Slavery in doing all I
have mentioned to you, interrupted <hi>Arabella:</hi> It
requires, indeed, a good Memory, in which I
never thought you deficient; for you are
punctual to the greateſt Degree of Exactneſs in
recounting every thing one deſires to hear from
you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucy,</hi> whom this Praiſe ſoothed into good
Humour, and flattered with a Belief, that ſhe
was able, with a little Inſtruction, to perform
what her Lady required, told her, if ſhe pleaſed
only to put her in a Way how to tell her
Hiſtory, ſhe would engage, after doing it once,
to tell it again whenever ſhe was deſired.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> being obliged to comply with the
odd Requeſt, for which there was no Precedent
in all the Romances her Library was ſtuffed
with, began to inform her in this manner:</p>
               <p>Firſt, ſaid ſhe, you muſt relate my Birth,
which you know is very illuſtrious; and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I am willing to ſpare you the Trouble of
repeating Things, that are not abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
you muſt apologize to your Hearers for
ſlipping over what paſſed in my Infancy, and the
firſt Eight or Ten Years of my Life; not failing,
however, to remark, that, from ſome ſprightly
Sallies of Imagination, at thoſe early Years,
thoſe about me conceived marvellous Hopes of
my future Underſtanding: From thence you
muſt proceed to an accurate Deſcription of my
Perſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:0005700701:202"/>
What! Madam, interrupted <hi>Lucy,</hi> muſt I
tell what Sort of Perſon you have, to People
who have ſeen you but a Moment ago?</p>
               <p>Queſtionleſs you muſt, replied <hi>Arabella;</hi> and
herein you follow the Examples of all the 'Squires
and Maids who relate their Maſters and Ladies
Hiſtories: For, though it be to a Brother, or
near Relation, who has ſeen them a thouſand
times, yet they never omit an exact Account of
their Perſons.</p>
               <p>Very well, Madam, ſaid <hi>Lucy:</hi> I ſhall be
ſure not to forget that Part of my Story. I wiſh
I was as perfect in all the reſt.</p>
               <p>Then, <hi>Lucy,</hi> you muſt repeat all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations
I have ever held with you upon the
Subjects of Love and Gallantry, that your Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
may be ſo well acquainted with my
Humour, as to know exactly, before they are
told, how I ſhall behave, in whatever Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
befal me.—After that, you may proceed
to tell them, how a noble Unknown ſaw me at
Church; how prodigiouſly he was ſtruck with
my Appearance; the tumultuous Thoughts
that this firſt View of me occaſioned in his
Mind.—</p>
               <p>Indeed, Madam, interrupted <hi>Lucy</hi> again, I
can't pretend to tell his Thoughts: For how
ſhould I know what they were? None but
himſelf can tell that.</p>
               <p>However that may be, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
you ſhould decypher all his Thoughts, as
plainly as he himſelf could do; otherwiſe my
Hiſtory will be very imperfect: Well, I ſuppoſe
you are at no loſs about that whole Adventure,
in which you yourſelf bore ſo great a Share; ſo
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0005700701:203"/>
need not give you any further Inſtructions
concerning it: Only you muſt be ſure, as I
ſaid before, not to omit the leaſt Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
in my Behaviour, but relate every
thing I did, ſaid, and thought, upon that Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.
The diſguiſed Gardener muſt appear
next in your Story: Here you will of neceſſity
be a little deficient, ſince you are not able to
acquaint your Hearers with his true Name and
Quality; which, queſtionleſs, is very illuſtrious.
However, above all, I muſt charge you not to
mention that egregious Miſtake about the Carp;
for, you know how—</p>
               <p>Here Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi>'s Entrance put a Stop to
the Inſtructions <hi>Lucy</hi> was receiving: For ſhe
told <hi>Arabella,</hi> that Sir <hi>George</hi> was gone.</p>
               <p>How! returned ſhe, is he gone? Truly I
am not much obliged to him for the Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
he has ſhewed to hear my Story.</p>
               <p>Why, really, Madam, ſaid Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi>
neither of us expected you would be as good
as your Word, you were ſo long in ſending your
Woman down: And my Brother perſuaded Sir
<hi>George</hi> you were only in Jeſt; and Sir <hi>George</hi> has
carried him home to Dinner.</p>
               <p>And is it at Sir <hi>George</hi>'s, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi>
that your Brother hopes to meet with an Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of clearing himſelf? He is either very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible
of my Anger, or very conſcious of his
own Innocence.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> having nothing to ſay in
Anſwer to an Accuſation ſhe did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
changed the Diſcourſe: And the two
Ladies paſſed the reſt of the Day together, with
tolerable Good-humour on Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi>'s Side;
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0005700701:204"/>
who was in great hopes of making a Conqueſt
of the Baronet, before whom <hi>Arabella</hi> had
made herſelf ridiculous enough: But that Lady
was far from being at Eaſe; ſhe had laid herſelf
under a Neceſſity of baniſhing Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> if
he did not give ſome convincing Proof of his
Innocence; which, as Matters ſtood, ſhe
thought would be very hard for him to procure;
and, as ſhe could not abſolutely believe him
guilty, ſhe was concerned ſhe had gone ſo far.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>MR. <hi>Glanville,</hi> coming home in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
a little elevated with the Wine,
of which he had drank too freely at Sir <hi>George</hi>'s,
being told the Ladies were together, entered the
Room where they were ſitting; and, beholding
<hi>Arabella,</hi> whoſe Penſiveneſs had given an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting
Softneſs to her Face, with a Look of
extreme Admiration—</p>
               <p>Upon my Soul, Couſin, ſaid he, if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to treat me ſo cruelly, you'll drive me
mad. How I could adore you this Moment,
added he, gazing paſſionately at her, if I might
but hope you did not hate me!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> who did not perceive the Condition
he was in, was better pleaſed with this Addreſs
than any he had ever uſed; and, therefore, inſtead
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0005700701:205"/>
of chiding him, as ſhe was wont, for the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of his Expreſſions, ſhe caſt her bright Eyes
upon the Ground, with ſo charming a Confuſion,
that <hi>Glanville,</hi> quite tranſported, threw himſelf on
his Knees before her; and, taking her Hand,
attempted to preſs it to his Lips: But ſhe,
haſtily withdrawing it—</p>
               <p>From whence is this new Boldneſs? ſaid ſhe:
And what is it you would implore by that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
Poſture? I have told you already upon
what Conditions I will grant you my Pardon.
Clear yourſelf of being an Accomplice with my
deſigned Raviſher, and I am ready to reſtore
you to my Eſteem.</p>
               <p>Let me periſh, Madam, returned <hi>Glanville,</hi>
if I would not die to pleaſe you, this Moment!</p>
               <p>It is not your Death that I require, ſaid ſhe:
And, though you ſhould never be able to juſtify
yourſelf in my Opinion, yet you might, haply,
expiate your Crime, by a leſs Puniſhment than
Death.</p>
               <p>What ſhall I do, then, my Angelic Couſin?
reſumed he.</p>
               <p>Truly, ſaid ſhe, the Senſe of your Offence
ought ſo mortally to afflict you, that you ſhould
invent ſome ſtrange kind of Penance for your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
ſevere enough to prove your Penitence ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere.—You
know, I ſuppoſe, what the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
<hi>Orontes</hi> did, when he found he had
wronged his adored <hi>Thaleſtris</hi> by an injurious
Suſpicion.</p>
               <p>I wiſh he had hanged himſelf, ſaid Mr. <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
riſing up in a Paſſion, at ſeeing her again
in her Altitudes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:0005700701:206"/>
And why, pray, Sir, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> are you
ſo ſevere upon that poor Prince? who was,
haply, infinitely more innocent than yourſelf.</p>
               <p>Severe, Madam! ſaid <hi>Glanville,</hi> fearing he
had offended her: Why, to be ſure, he was a
ſad Scoundrel, to uſe his adored <hi>Thaleſtris</hi> as he
did: And I think one cannot be too ſevere
upon him.</p>
               <p>But, returned <hi>Arabella,</hi> Appearances were
againſt her; and he had ſome Shadow of Reaſon
for his Jealouſy and Rage: Then, you know,
amidſt all his Tranſports, he could not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
upon to draw his Sword againſt her.</p>
               <p>What did that ſignify? ſaid <hi>Glanville:</hi> I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
he ſcorned to draw his Sword upon a
Woman: That would have been a Shame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
               <p>That Woman, Sir, reſumed <hi>Arabella,</hi> was
not ſuch a contemptible Antagoniſt as you think
her: And Men, as valiant, poſſibly, as <hi>Orontes</hi>
(though, queſtionleſs, he was one of the moſt
valiant Men in the World), have been cut in
Pieces by the Sword of that brave <hi>Amazon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lord bleſs me! ſaid Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> I ſhould
be afraid to look at ſuch a terrible Woman: I
am ſure ſhe muſt be a very maſculine Sort of
Creature.</p>
               <p>You are much miſtaken, Miſs, ſaid <hi>Arabella:</hi>
For <hi>Thaleſtris,</hi> tho' the moſt ſtout and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous
of her Sex, was, nevertheleſs, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Beauty; and had as much Harmony and
Softneſs in her Looks and Perſon, as ſhe had
Courage in her Heart, and Strength in her Blows.</p>
               <p>Indeed, Madam, reſumed Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> you
can never perſuade me, that a Woman who can
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0005700701:207"/>
ſight, and cut People to Pieces with her Blows,
can have any Softneſs in her Perſon: She muſt
needs have very maſculine Hands, that could
give ſuch terrible Blows: And I can have no
Notion of the Harmony of a Perſon's Looks,
who, by what you ſay, muſt have the Heart of
a Tyger. But, indeed, I don't think there ever
could be ſuch a Woman.</p>
               <p>What! Miſs, interrupted <hi>Arabella:</hi> Do you
pretend to doubt, that there ever was ſuch a
Perſon as <hi>Thaleſtris,</hi> Queen of the <hi>Amazons?</hi>
Does not all the World know the Adventures
of that illuſtrious Princeſs; her Affection for the
unjuſt <hi>Orontes,</hi> who accuſed her of having a
ſcandalous Intrigue with <hi>Alexander,</hi> whom ſhe
went to meet, with a very different Deſign, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Borders of her Kingdom? The injurious
Letter he wrote her, upon this Suſpicion, made
her reſolve to ſeek for him all over the World,
to give him that Death he had merited, by her
own Hand: And it was in thoſe Rencounters
that he had with her, while ſhe was thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed,
that he forbore to defend himſelf againſt
her, though her Sword was often pointed to his
Breaſt.</p>
               <p>But, Madam, interrupted Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi>
pray what became of this Queen of the <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zons?</hi>
Was ſhe not killed at the Siege of <hi>Troy?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She never was at the Siege of <hi>Troy,</hi> returned
<hi>Arabella:</hi> But ſhe aſſiſted the Princes who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged
<hi>Babylon,</hi> to recover the Liberty of <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tira</hi>
and <hi>Pariſatis:</hi> And it was in the oppoſite
Party that ſhe met with her faithleſs Lover.</p>
               <p>If he was faithleſs, Madam, ſaid Mr. <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
he deſerved to die: And I wiſh, with all
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0005700701:208"/>
my Soul, ſhe had cut him in Pieces with that
famous Sword of hers that had done ſuch Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
               <p>Yet this faithleſs Man, reſumed <hi>Arabella,</hi>
whom you ſeem to have ſuch an Averſion to, gave
ſo glorious a Proof of his Repentance and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
that the fair Queen reſtored him to her
Favour, and held him in much dearer Affection
than ever: For, after he was convinced of her
Innocence, he was reſolved to puniſh himſelf
with a Rigour equal to the Fault he had been
guilty of; and, retiring to the Woods, abandoned
for ever the Society of Men; dwelling in a
Cave, and living upon bitter Herbs, paſſing the
Days and Nights in continual Tears and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
for his Crime: And here he propoſed to
end his Life, had not the fair <hi>Thaleſtris</hi> found
him out in this Solitude; and, ſtruck with the
Sincerity of his Repentance, pardoned him;
and, as I have ſaid before, reſtored him to her
Favour.</p>
               <p>And, to ſhew you, ſaid <hi>Glanville,</hi> that I am
capable of doing as much for you; I will, if
you inſiſt upon it, ſeek out for ſome Cave, and
do Penance in it, like that <hi>Orontes,</hi> provided
you will come and fetch me out of it, as that
ſame fair Queen did him.</p>
               <p>I do not require ſo much of you, ſaid <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella;</hi>
for I told you before, that, haply, you are
juſtified already in my Opinion; but yet it is
neceſſary, you ſhould find out ſome Method of
convincing the World of your Innocence; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
it is not fit I ſhould live with you upon
Terms of Friendſhip and Civility.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:0005700701:209"/>
Well, well, Madam, ſaid <hi>Glanville,</hi> I'll
convince you of my Innocence, by bringing that
Raſcal's Head to you, whom you ſuſpect I
was inclined to aſſiſt in ſtealing you away.</p>
               <p>If you do that, reſumed <hi>Arabella,</hi> doubtleſs
you will be iuſtified in my Opinion, and the
World's alſo; and I ſhall have no Scruple to
treat you with as much Friendſhip as I did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>My Brother is much obliged to you, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
interrupted Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> for putting
him upon an Action, that would coſt him his
Life!</p>
               <p>I have ſo good an Opinion of your Brother's
Valour, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> that I am perſuaded he
will find no Difficulty in performing his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe;
and I make no queſtion but I ſhall ſee him
covered with the Spoils of that Impoſtor, who
would have betrayed me; and I flatter myſelf,
he will be in a Condition to bring me his Head,
as he bravely promiſes, without endangering his
own Life.</p>
               <p>Does your Ladyſhip conſider, ſaid Miſs <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
that my Brother can take away no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's
Life whatever, without endangering his
own?</p>
               <p>I conſider, Madam, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as a Man poſſeſſed of Virtue and Courage
enough to undertake to kill all my Enemies
and Perſecutors, though I had ever ſo many;
and I preſume, he would be able to perform
as many glorious Actions for my Service, as
either <hi>Juba, Caeſario, Artamenes,</hi> or <hi>Artaban,</hi>
who, though not a Prince, was greater than any
of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:0005700701:210"/>
If thoſe Perſons you have named, ſaid Miſs
<hi>Glanville,</hi> were Murderers, and made a Practice
of killing People, I hope my Brother will be
too wiſe to follow their Examples: A ſtrange
kind of Virtue and Courage indeed, to take
away the Lives of one's Fellow-Creatures! How
did ſuch Wretches eſcape the Gallows, I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der?</p>
               <p>I perceive, interrupted <hi>Arabella,</hi> what kind
of Apprehenſions you have: I ſuppoſe you
think, if your Brother was to kill my Enemy,
the Law would puniſh him for it: But pray
undeceive yourſelf, Miſs: The Law has no
Power over Heroes; they may kill as many
Men as they pleaſe, without being called to any
Account for it; and the more Lives they take
away, the greater is their Reputation for Virtue
and Glory. The illuſtrious <hi>Artaban,</hi> from the
Condition of a private Man, raiſed himſelf to
the ſublimeſt Pitch of Glory by his Valour; for
he not only would win half a dozen Battles in
a Day; but, to ſhew that Victory followed him
where-ever he went, he would change Parties,
and immediately the Vanquiſhed became Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors;
then, returning to the Side he had
quitted, changed the Laurels of his former
Friends into Chains. He made nothing of
tumbling Kings from their Thrones, and giving
away half a dozen Crowns in a Morning; for
his Generoſity was equal to his Courage; and
to this Height of Power did he raiſe himſelf
by his Sword. Beginning at firſt with petty
Conqueſts, and not diſdaining to oppoſe his
glorious Arm to ſometimes leſs than a Score of
his Enemies; ſo, by degrees, enuring himſelf
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0005700701:211"/>
to conquer inconſiderable Numbers, he came
at laſt to be the Terror of whole Armies, who
would fly at the Sight of his ſingle Sword.</p>
               <p>This is all very aſtoniſhing indeed, ſaid Miſs
<hi>Glanville:</hi> However, I muſt intreat you, not to
inſiſt upon my Brother's quarrelling and fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng
with People, ſince it will be neither for
your Honour, nor his Safety; for I am afraid,
if he was to commit Murder to pleaſe you, the
Laws would make him ſuffer for it; and the
World would be very free with its Cenſures on
your Ladyſhip's Reputation, for putting him
upon ſuch ſhocking Crimes.</p>
               <p>By your Diſcourſe, Miſs, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi>
one would imagine, you knew as little in what
the good Reputation of a Lady conſiſts, as the
Safety of a Man; for certainly the one depends
intirely upon his Sword, and the other
upon the Noiſe and Buſtle ſhe makes in the
World. The Blood that is ſhed for a Lady,
enhances the Value of her Charms; and the
more Men a Hero kills, the greater his Glory,
and, by Conſequence, the more ſecure he is.
If to be the Cauſe of a great many Deaths, can
make a Lady infamous; certainly none were
ever more ſo, than <hi>Mandana, Cleopatra,</hi> and
<hi>Statira,</hi> the moſt illuſtrious Names in Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity;
for each of whom, haply, an hundred
thouſand Men were killed: Yet none were ever
ſo unjuſt, as to profane the Virtue of thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Beauties, by caſting any Cenſures upon
them for theſe glorious Effects of their Charms,
and the heroic Valour of their Admirers.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs, interrupted Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi>
I ſhould not be ſorry to have a Duel or Two
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0005700701:212"/>
fought for me in <hi>Hyde-park;</hi> but then I would
not have any Blood ſhed for the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Glanville</hi> here interrupting his Siſter with a
Laugh, <hi>Arabella</hi> alſo could not forbear ſmiling
at the harmleſs Kind of Combats her Couſin
was fond of.</p>
               <p>But to put an End to the Converſation, and
the Diſpute which gave Riſe to it, ſhe obliged
Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> to promiſe to fight with the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor
<hi>Edward,</hi> whenever he found him; and
either take away his Life, or force him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
he had no Part in the Deſign he had me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated
againſt her.</p>
               <p>This being agreed upon, <hi>Arabella,</hi> conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> to her Chamber, retired to
her own; and paſſed the Night with much
greater Tranquillity, than ſhe had done the
preceding; being ſatisfied with the Care ſhe
had taken of her own Glory, and perſuaded
that <hi>Glanville</hi> was not unfaithful; a Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
that was of more Conſequence to her
Happineſs, than ſhe was yet aware of.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>WHILE theſe things paſſed at the
Caſtle, Sir <hi>George</hi> was meditating on
the Means he ſhould uſe to acquire the Eſteem
of Lady <hi>Bella,</hi> of whoſe Perſon he was a little
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0005700701:213"/>
enamoured, but of her Fortune a great deal
more.</p>
               <p>By the Obſervations he had made on her Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,
he diſcovered her peculiar Turn: He
was well read in Romances himſelf, and had
actually employed himſelf ſome Weeks in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a new Verſion of the <hi>Grand Cyrus;</hi> but
the prodigious Length of the Taſk he had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken,
terrified him ſo much, that he gave it
over: Nevertheleſs, he was perfectly well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the chief Characters in moſt of
the <hi>French</hi> Romances; could tell every thing
that was borrowed from them, in all the new
Novels that came out; and, being a very accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Critic, and a mortal Hater of <hi>Dryden,</hi> ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculed
him for want of Invention, as it appeared
by his having recourſe to theſe Books for the
moſt ſhining Characters and Incidents in his
Plays. <hi>Almanzor,</hi> he would ſay, was the Copy
of the famous <hi>Artaban</hi> in <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> whoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits
<hi>Arabella</hi> had expatiated upon to Miſs
<hi>Glanville,</hi> and her Brother: His admired Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of <hi>Melantha</hi> in Marriage <hi>à-la-mode,</hi> was
drawn from <hi>Beriſſa</hi> in the <hi>Grand Cyrus;</hi> and
the Story of <hi>Oſmyn</hi> and <hi>Benſayda,</hi> in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
of <hi>Granada,</hi> taken from <hi>Seſoſtris</hi> and <hi>Time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilla</hi>
in that Romance.</p>
               <p>Fraught therefore with the Knowlege of all
the Extravagances and Peculiarities in thoſe
Books, he reſolved to make his Addreſſes to
<hi>Arabella</hi> in the Form they preſcribed; and,
not having Delicacy enough to be diſguſted with
the Ridicule in her Character, ſerved himſelf
with her Foible, to effect his Deſigns.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:0005700701:214"/>
It being neceſſary, in order to his better Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with <hi>Arabella,</hi> to be upon very
friendly Terms with Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> and her
Brother, he ſaid a thouſand gallant Things to
one, and ſeemed ſo little offended with the
Gloom he obſerved upon the Countenance of
the other, who poſitively aſſured him, that
<hi>Arabella</hi> meant only to laugh at him, when ſhe
promiſed him her Hiſtory, that he intreated
him, with the moſt obliging Earneſtneſs, to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
him with his Company at his Houſe, where
he omitted no ſort of Civility, to confirm their
Friendſhip and Intimacy; and perſuaded him,
by ſeveral little and ſeemingly unguarded Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
that he was not ſo great an Admirer
of Lady <hi>Bella,</hi> as her agreeable Couſin Miſs
<hi>Glanville.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus ſecured a Footing in the Caſtle,
he furniſhed his Memory with all the neceſſary
Rules of making Love in <hi>Arabella</hi>'s Taſte, and
deferred his next Viſit no longer than till the
following Day; but Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed,

it would be in vain to expect to ſee <hi>Arabella,</hi>

               <p>Contenting himſelf, therefore, with having

his Siſter, to engage her to make him a Viſit;
ſuch a Favour being never granted by any Lady
to a ſick Lover, till ſhe was previouſly informed,
her Preſence was neceſſary to hinder the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of his Diſtemper.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> would not have failed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
to her Couſin the Incivility and Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs
of her Behaviour, in not deigning to
come and ſee her Brother in his Indiſpoſition,
had not Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> imputing this Neglect
to the Nicety of her Notions, which he had
upon other Occaſions experienced, abſolutely
forbid her to ſay any thing to her Couſin upon
this Subject.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> being thus forced to Silence,
by the Fear of giving her Brother Uneaſineſs,
<hi>Arabella</hi> was extremely diſappointed to find,
that, in Five Days Illneſs, no Application had
been made to her, either by the ſick Lover, or
his Siſter, who ſhe thought intereſted herſelf
too little in his Recovery; ſo that her Glory
obliging her to lay ſome Conſtraint upon her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
ſhe behaved with a Coolneſs and Inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
that increaſed Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi>'s Averſion
to her, while, in Reality, ſhe was extremely
concerned for her Couſin's Illneſs; but not
ſuppoſing it dangerous, ſince they had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to the uſual Remedy, of beſeeching a
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0005700701:216"/>
Viſit from the Perſon whoſe Preſence was
alone able to work a Cure, ſhe reſolved to wait
patiently the Event.</p>
               <p>However, ſhe never failed in her Reſpect to
Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> whom ſhe viſited every Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
before ſhe went to her Brother; and alſo
conſtantly dined with her in her own Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
inquiring always, with great Sweetneſs,
concerning her Brother's Health; when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
her in Tears one Day, as ſhe came in,
as uſual, to dine with her, ſhe was extremely
alarmed; and aſked with great Precipitation,
If Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> was worſe?</p>
               <p>He is ſo bad, Madam, returned Miſs <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
that I believe it will be neceſſary to ſend
for my Papa, for fear he ſhould die, and he
not ſee him.</p>
               <p>Die, Miſs! interrupted <hi>Arabella</hi> eagerly:
No, he muſt not die; and ſhall not, if the Pity
of <hi>Arabella</hi> is powerful enough to make him
live. Let us go then, Couſin, ſaid ſhe, her
Eyes ſtreaming with Tears; let us go and viſit
this dear Brother, whom you lament: Haply
my Sight may repair the Evils my Rigour
has cauſed him; and ſince, as I imagine, he has
forborn, through the profound Reſpect he has
for me, to requeſt the Favour of a Viſit, I
will voluntarily beſtow it on him, as well for
the Affection I bear you, as becauſe I do not
wiſh his Death.</p>
               <p>You do not wiſh his Death, Madam! ſaid
Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> exceſſively angry at a Speech,
in her Opinion, extremely inſolent: Is it ſuch
a mighty Favour, pray, not to wiſh the Death
of my Brother, who never injured you? I am
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0005700701:217"/>
ſure, your Behaviour has been ſo extremely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human,
that I have repented a thouſand
times, we ever came to the Caſtle.</p>
               <p>Let us not waſte the time in idle Reproaches,
ſaid <hi>Arabella:</hi> If my Rigour has brought your
Brother into this Condition, my Compaſſion
can draw him out of it: It is no more than
what all do ſuffer, who are poſſeſſed of a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Paſſion; and few Lovers ever arrive to the
Poſſeſſion of their Miſtreſſes, without being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
times brought almoſt to their Graves,
either by their Severity, or ſome other Cauſe:
But nothing is more eaſy, than to work a Cure,
in theſe Caſes; for the very Sight of the Perſon
beloved ſometimes does it, as it happened to
<hi>Artamenes,</hi> when the Divine <hi>Mandana</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended
to viſit him: A few kind Words,
ſpoken by the fair Princeſs of <hi>Perſia</hi> to <hi>Oroon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates,</hi>
recalled him from the Gates of Death;
and one Line from <hi>Pariſatis</hi>'s Hand, which
brought a Command to <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> to live, made
him not only reſolve, but even able, to obey
her.—</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> quite out of Patience at this
tedious Harangue, without any Regard to Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
flounced out of the Room; and ran to
her Brother's Chamber, followed by <hi>Arabella,</hi>
who imputed her rude Haſte to a Suſpicion,
that her Brother was worſe.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>By which we hope the Reader will be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently
affected.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AT their Entrance into the Room, Miſs
<hi>Glanville</hi> inquired of the Phyſician, juſt
going out, How he found her Brother? Who
replied, that his Fever was increaſed ſince laſt
Night; and that it would not (ſeeing <hi>Arabella</hi>
preparing to go to his Bedſide) be proper to
diſturb him.</p>
               <p>Saying this, he bow'd, and went out; and
Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> repeating what the Phyſician had
ſaid, begged her to defer ſpeaking to him till
another time.</p>
               <p>I know, ſaid ſhe, that he apprehends, the
Sight of me will cauſe ſo many tumultuous
Motions in the Soul of his Patient, as may prove
prejudicial to him: Nevertheleſs, ſince his
Diſorder is, queſtionleſs, more in his Mind than
Body, I may prove, haply, a better Phyſician
than he; ſince I am more likely, than he, to
cure an Illneſs I have cauſed—</p>
               <p>Saying this, ſhe walked up to Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi>'s
Bedſide, who, ſeeing her, thanked her, with a
weak Voice, for coming to ſee him; aſſuring
her, he was very ſenſible of the Favour ſhe did
him—</p>
               <p>You muſt not, ſaid ſhe, bluſhing, thank me
too much, leſt I think the Favour I have done
you, is really of more Conſequence than I
imagined, ſince it merits ſo many Acknowlege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0005700701:219"/>
Your Phyſician tells us, purſued ſhe,
that your Life is in Danger; but I perſuade
myſelf, you will value it ſo much from this
Moment, that you will not protract your Cure
any longer.</p>
               <p>Are you mad, Madam, whiſpered Miſs <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
who ſtood behind her, to tell my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that the Phyſician ſays he is in Danger?
I ſuppoſe you really wiſh he may die, or you
would not talk ſo.</p>
               <p>If, anſwered ſhe, whiſpering again to Miſs
<hi>Glanville,</hi> you are not ſatisfied with what I have
already done for your Brother, I will go as far
as Modeſty will permit me: And gently pulling
open the Curtains;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Glanville,</hi> ſaid ſhe, with a Voice too much
raiſed for a ſick Perſon's Ear, I grant to your
Siſter's Solicitations, what the fair <hi>Statira</hi> did
to an Intereſt yet more powerful, ſince, as you
know, it was her own Brother, who pleaded
in Favour of the dying <hi>Orontes:</hi> Therefore,
conſidering you in a Condition haply no leſs
dangerous, than that of that paſſionate Prince,
I condeſcend, like her, to tell you, that I do not
wiſh your Death; that I intreat you to live;
and, laſtly, by all the Power I have over you,
I command you to recover.</p>
               <p>Ending theſe Words, ſhe cloſed the Curtain,
that her tranſported Lover might not ſee her
Bluſhes and Confuſion, which were ſo great,
that, to conceal them, even from Miſs <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
ſhe hurried out of the Room, and retired
to her own Apartment, expecting, in a little
time, to receive a Billet, under the ſick Man's
Hand, importing, that, in Obedience to her
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0005700701:220"/>
Commands, he was recovered, and ready to
throw himſelf at her Feet, to thank her for that
Life ſhe had beſtowed upon him, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
the Remains of it to her Service.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> who ſtayed behind her, in a
ſtrange Surprize at her ridiculous Behaviour;
though ſhe longed to know what her Brother
thought of it, finding he continued ſilent,
would not diſturb him. The Shame he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
at hearing ſo abſurd a Speech from a
Woman he paſſionately loved; and the Deſire
he had, not to hear his Siſter's Sentiments up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it; made him counterfeit Sleep, to avoid
any Diſcourſe with her upon ſo diſagreeable a
Subject.</p>
               <p>That Day his Fever increaſed; and the next,
the Phyſician pronouncing him in great Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
a Meſſenger was diſpatched to Town, to
haſten the Coming of Sir <hi>Charles;</hi> and poor
Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> was quite inconſoleable, under
the Apprehenſions of loſing him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> not to derogate from her Character,
affected great Firmneſs of Mind upon this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion;
ſhe uſed the moſt perſuaſive Eloquence
to moderate her Couſin's Affliction, and cauſed
all imaginable Care to be taken of Mr. <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville:</hi>
While any one was preſent, her Looks
diſcovered only a calm and decent Sorrow;
yet when ſhe was alone, or had only her dear
<hi>Lucy</hi> with her, ſhe gave free Vent to her Tears;
and diſcovered a Grief for Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi>'s Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
little different from that ſhe had felt for her
Father's.</p>
               <p>As ſhe now viſited him conſtantly every Day,
ſhe took an Opportunity, when ſhe was alone
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0005700701:221"/>
by his Bedſide, to chide him for his Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
in not recovering, as ſhe had command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him.</p>
               <p>Dear Couſin, anſwered he faintly, Can you
imagine, Health is not my Choice? And do
you think, I would ſuffer theſe Pains, if I could
poſſibly eaſe myſelf of them?</p>
               <p>Thoſe Pains, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> miſtaking his
Complaint, ought to have ceaſed, when the
Cauſe of them did; and when I was no longer
rigorous, you ought no longer to have ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
But tell me, ſince you are, queſtionleſs,
one of the ſtrangeſt Men in the World, and
the hardeſt to be comforted; nay, and I may
add, the moſt diſobedient of all, that ever
wore the Fetters of Love; Tell me, I ſay,
what muſt I do to content you?</p>
               <p>If I live, Couſin, ſaid <hi>Glanville</hi>—</p>
               <p>Nay, interrupted <hi>Arabella,</hi> ſince my Empire
over you is not ſo abſolute as I thought; and
ſince you think fit to reſerve to yourſelf the
Liberty of dying, contrary to my Deſire; I
think I had better reſolve, not to make any
Treaty with you: However, as I have gone
thus far, I will do ſomething more; and tell
you, ſince I have commanded you to live, I
will alſo permit you to love me, in order to
make the Life I have beſtowed on you, worthy
your Acceptance. Make me no Reply, ſaid
ſhe, putting her Hand on his Mouth; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
from this Moment to obey me.</p>
               <p>Saying this, ſhe went out of the Room—</p>
               <p>A few Hours after, his Fever being come to
a Height, he grew delirious, and talked very
wildly; but a favourable Criſis enſuing, he fell
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0005700701:222"/>
into a ſound and quiet Sleep, and continued in
it for ſeveral Hours: Upon his waking, the
Phyſician declared, his Fever was greatly aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
and the next Morning, pronounced him
out of Danger—</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> tranſported with Joy, ran to
Lady <hi>Bella,</hi> and informed her of this good News;
but as ſhe did not make her the Acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ſhe expected, for being the Cauſe of his
Recovery, ſhe behaved with more Reſerve
than Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> thought was neceſſary:
Which renewed her former Diſguſts; yet, dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to diſpleaſe her Brother, ſhe concealed it
from the Obſervation of her Couſin—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> being deſirous of completing her
Lover's Cure by ſome more favourable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
went to his Chamber, accompanied
by Miſs <hi>Glanville.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſee, ſaid ſhe, approaching to his Bedſide,
with an inchanting Smile, that you know how
to be obedient, when you pleaſe; and I begin
to know, by the Price you ſet upon your Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
that ſmall Favours will not content you.</p>
               <p>Indeed, my deareſt Couſin, ſaid <hi>Glanville,</hi>
who had found her more intereſted in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
than he expected, you have been very
obliging, and I will always moſt gratefully own
it.</p>
               <p>I am glad, interrupted <hi>Arabella,</hi> that Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
is not baniſhed from all your Family; and
that that Perſon in it, for whom I have the moſt
Senſibility, is not intirely diveſted of it—</p>
               <p>I hope, ſaid Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> my Siſter has
given you no Cauſe to complain of her.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:0005700701:223"/>
Indeed but ſhe has, replied <hi>Arabella;</hi> for,
notwithſtanding ſhe is obliged to me for the
Life of a Brother, whom queſtionleſs ſhe loves
very well; nevertheleſs, ſhe did not deign to
make me the leaſt Acknowledgement for what I
have done in your Favour: However, <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
provided you continue to obſerve that
Reſpect and Fidelity towards me, which I have
Reaſon to hope for from you; your Condition
ſhall be never the worſe for Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi>'s un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acknowleging
Temper; and I now confirm
the Grant I Yeſterday made you, and repeat
it again; That I permit you to love me, and
promiſe you not to be diſpleaſed at any Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
you will give me of your Paſſion, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
you ſerve me with an inviolable Fidelity.</p>
               <p>But, Madam, returned Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> to
make my Happineſs complete, you muſt alſo
promiſe to love me; or elſe what ſignifies the
Permiſſion you give me to love you?</p>
               <p>You are almoſt as unacknowleging as your
Siſter, reſumed <hi>Arabella,</hi> bluſhing; and if your
Health was perfectly re-eſtabliſhed, queſtionleſs,
I ſhould chide you for your Preſumption; but
ſince ſomething muſt be allowed to ſick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
whoſe Reaſon, one may ſuppoſe, is weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
by their Indiſpoſition, I will pardon your
Indiſcretion at this time, and counſel you to
wait patiently for what Heaven will determine
in your Favour: Therefore endeavour to merit
my Affection by your Reſpect, Fidelity, and
Services; and hope from my Juſtice, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it ought to beſtow—</p>
               <p>Ending this Speech, with a Solemnity of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
that gave Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> to underſtand,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0005700701:224"/>
any Reply would offend her, he ſilently kiſſed
her fair Hand, which ſhe held out to him; a
Favour, the Terms upon which they now were,
and his Sickneſs, gave him a Right to expect—
And, finiſhing her Viſit for that time, left him
to his Repoſe; being extremely pleaſed at the
Proſpect of his Recovery, and very well ſatisfied
at having ſo gracefully got over ſo great a Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
as that of giving him Permiſſion to love
her: For by the Laws of Romance, when a Lady
has once given her Lover that Permiſſion, ſhe
may lawfully allow him to talk to her upon the
Subject of his Paſſion, accept all his Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
and claim an abſolute Empire over all his
Actions; reſerving to herſelf the Right of fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Time when ſhe may own her Affection:
And when that important Step is taken, and his
Conſtancy put to a few Years more Trial; when
he has killed all his Rivals, and reſcued her from
a thouſand Dangers; ſhe at laſt condeſcends to
reward him with her Hand; and all her Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures
are at an End for the future.</p>

a Day, during Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi>'s
Illneſs, in ſending to the Caſtle,
now he was able to ſee Company,
viſited him very frequently; and
ſometimes had the Happineſs to
meet with <hi>Arabella</hi> in his Chamber: But,
knowing the Conditions of her Father's Will,
and Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi>'s Pretenſions, he was obliged
to lay ſo much Conſtraint upon himſelf, in the
Preſence of Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> and her Brother, that
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0005700701:226"/>
he hardly durſt truſt his Eyes, to expreſs his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
of her, for Fear of alarming them with
any Suſpicion of his Deſigns: However, he
did not fail to recommend himſelf to her
Eſteem, by a Behaviour to her full of the moſt
perfect Reſpect; and very often, ere he was
aware, uttered ſome of the extravagant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments,
that the Gallants in the <hi>French</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
uſe to their Miſtreſſes.</p>
               <p>If he walked with her in the Gardens, he
would obſerve, that the Flowers, which were
before languiſhing and pale, bloomed with freſh
Beauty at her Approach; that the Sun ſhined
out with double Brightneſs, to exceed, if poſſible,
the Luſtre of her Eyes; and that the Wind,
fond of kiſſing her celeſtial Countenance, played
with her fair Hair; and, by gentle Murmurs,
declared its Happineſs—</p>
               <p>If Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> happened to be preſent,
when he talked to her in this Strain, ſhe would
ſuppoſe he was ridiculing her Couſin's fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical
Turn; and when ſhe had an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of ſpeaking to him alone, would chide him,
with a great deal of good Humour, for giving
hrr ſo much Diverſion at her Couſin's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>George,</hi> improving this Hint, perſuaded
Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> by his Anſwers, that he really
laughed at <hi>Arabella;</hi> and, being now leſs fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of giving any Suſpicion to the gay Coquet,
ſince ſhe aſſiſted him to deceive her, he applied
himſelf, with more Aſſiduity than ever, to inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate
himſelf into <hi>Arabella</hi>'s Flavour.</p>
               <p>However, the Neceſſity he was under of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
always of <hi>Arabella</hi>'s Opinion, ſometimes
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0005700701:227"/>
drew him into little Difficulties with Miſs <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville.</hi>
Knowing that young Lady was extremely
fond of Scandal, he told her, as a moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Piece of News, one Afternoon when he
was there, that he had ſeen Miſs <hi>Groves,</hi> who,
he ſuppoſed, had come into the Country upon
the ſame Account as ſhe had done a Twelve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>month
before: Her Marriage being yet a
Secret, the complaiſant Baronet threw out an
Hint or two, concerning the Familiarity and
Correſpondence there was between her and the
Gentleman to whom ſhe was really ſecretly
married.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> making the moſt of this Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
ſaid a thouſand ſevere Things againſt
the unfortunate Miſs <hi>Groves;</hi> which <hi>Arabella,</hi>
always benevolent and kind, could not bear.</p>
               <p>I perſuade myſelf, ſaid ſhe to her Couſin,
that you have been miſinformed concerning this
Beauty, whoſe Misfortunes you aggravate by
your cruel Cenſures; and whoever has given
you the Hiſtory of her Life, has, haply, done it
with great Injuſtice—</p>
               <p>Why, Madam, interrupted Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi>
do you think you are better acquainted with her
Hiſtory, as you call it, who have never been in
Town, where her Follies made her ſo remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
than Perſons who were Eye-witneſſes of
all her ridiculous Actions?</p>
               <p>I apprehend, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> that I, who have
had a Relation made to me of all the Paſſages
of her Life, and have been told all her moſt
ſecret Thoughts, may know as much, if not
more, than Perſons who have lived in the ſame
Place with her, and have not had that Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0005700701:228"/>
and I think, I know enough to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
her from many cruel Aſperſions.</p>
               <p>Pray, Madam, returned Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> will
your Ladyſhip pretend to defend her ſcandalous
Commerce with Mr. <hi>L</hi>—?</p>
               <p>I know not, Miſs, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> why you
call her Intercourſe with that perjured Man by
ſo unjuſt an Epithet. If Miſs <hi>Groves</hi> be unchaſte,
ſo was the renowned <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> whoſe Marriage
with <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> is controverted to this Day.</p>
               <p>And what Reaſons, Madam, ſaid Miſs <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
have you for ſuppoſing, Miſs <hi>Groves</hi> was
married to Mr. <hi>L</hi>—, ſince all the World
knows to the contrary?</p>
               <p>Very ſufficient ones, ſaid <hi>Arabella;</hi> ſince it is
hardly poſſible to ſuppoſe, a young Lady of Miſs
<hi>Groves</hi>'s Quality would ſtain the Luſtre of her
Deſcent by ſo ſhameful an Intrigue; and alſo,
ſince there are Examples enough to be found of
Perſons, who ſuffered under the ſame unhappy
Circumſtances as herſelf; yet were perfectly
innocent, as was that great Queen I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned;
who queſtionleſs, you, Sir, are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
convinced, was married to that illuſtrious
Conqueror; who, by betraying ſo great and ſo
fair a Queen, in great meaſure tarniſhed the
Glory of his Laurels—</p>
               <p>Married, Madam! replied Sir <hi>George:</hi> Who
preſumes to ſay, that fair Queen was not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to that illuſtrious Conqueror?</p>
               <p>Nay, you know, Sir, interrupted <hi>Arabella,</hi>
many People did ſay, even while ſhe was living,
that ſhe was not married; and have branded her
Memory with infamous Calumnies, upon Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Son ſhe had by <hi>Caeſar,</hi> the brave
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0005700701:229"/>
                  <hi>Caeſario,</hi> who, under the Name of <hi>Cleomedon,</hi>
performed ſuch Miracles of Valour in <hi>Ethiopia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I aſſure you, Madam, ſaid Sir <hi>George,</hi> I was
always a great Admirer of the famous <hi>Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
who was certainly the greateſt Hero in the
World.</p>
               <p>Pardon me, Sir, ſaid <hi>Arabella; Cleomedon</hi>
was, queſtionleſs, a very valiant Man; but he,
and all the Heroes that ever were, muſt give
place to the unequalled Prince of <hi>Mauritania;</hi>
that illuſtrious, and for a long time unfortunate,
Lover of the Divine <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> who was Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as you queſtionleſs know, of the great
Queen we have been ſpeaking of—</p>
               <p>Dear Heart! ſaid Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> What is
all this to the Purpoſe? I would fain know,
whether Sir <hi>George</hi> believes, Miſs <hi>Groves</hi> was
ever married to Mr. <hi>L</hi>—.</p>
               <p>Doubtleſs, I do, ſaid he; for, as Lady <hi>Bella</hi>
ſays, ſhe is in the ſame unhappy Circumſtance
with the great <hi>Cleopatra;</hi> and if <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi>
could be guilty of denying his Marriage with
that Queen, I ſee no Reaſon to ſuppoſe, why
Mr. <hi>L</hi>—might not be guilty of the ſame
kind of Injuſtice.</p>
               <p>So then, interrupted Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> bluſhing
with Spite, you will really offer to maintain,
that Miſs <hi>Groves</hi> was married? Ridiculous!
How ſuch a Report would be laughed at in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I aſſure you, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> if ever I go to
<hi>London,</hi> I ſhall not ſcruple to maintain that
Opinion to every one, who will mention that
Fair-one to me; and uſe all my Endeavours to
confirm them in it.</p>

Your Ladyſhip would do well, ſaid Miſs
<hi>Glanville,</hi> to perſuade People, that Miſs <hi>Groves,</hi>
at Fifteen, did not want to run away with her
Writing-maſter.</p>
               <p>As I am perſuaded myſelf, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> that
Writing maſter was ſome noble Stranger in
Diſguiſe, who was paſſionately in Love with her,
I ſhall not ſuffer any body, in my Hearing, to
propagate ſuch an unlikely Story; but ſince he
was a Perſon worthy of her Affection, if ſhe had
run away with him, her Fault was not without
Example, and even Excuſe: You know what
the fair <hi>Artemiſa</hi> did for <hi>Alexander,</hi> Sir, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
ſhe, turning to Sir <hi>George:</hi> I would fain
know your Sentiments upon the Action of that
Princeſs, which ſome have not ſcrupled to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn—</p>
               <p>Whoever they are, Madam, ſaid Sir <hi>George,</hi>
who condemn the fair <hi>Artemiſa</hi> for what ſhe
did for <hi>Alexander,</hi> are Miſcreants and Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers;
and though that beautiful Princeſs has
been dead more than Two thouſand Years, I
would draw my Sword in Defence of her Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
againſt all who ſhould preſume, in my
Preſence, to caſt any Cenſures upon it.</p>
               <p>Since you are ſo courageous, ſaid Miſs <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
laughing exceſſively at this Sally, which,
ſhe thought, was to ridicule her Couſin; it is
to be hoped, you will defend a living Lady's
Character, who may thank you for it; and
make the World believe, that her Correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
with Mr. <hi>L</hi>—was intirely innocent;
and that ſhe never had any Deſign to run away
with her Writing-maſter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:0005700701:231"/>
Are you reſolved, Couſin, ſaid Lady <hi>Bella,</hi>
to perſiſt in that ridiculous Miſtake, and take
a Nobleman for a Writing-maſter only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
his Love put him upon ſuch a Stratagem
to obtain his Miſtreſs?</p>
               <p>Indeed, Lady <hi>Bella,</hi> ſaid Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> ſmile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
you may as well perſuade me, the Moon
is made of a Cream Cheeſe, as that any Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
turned himſelf into a Writing-maſter, to
obtain Miſs <hi>Groves</hi>—</p>
               <p>Is it poſſible, Miſs, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> that you
can offer ſuch an Affront to my Underſtanding,
as to ſuppoſe, I would argue upon ſuch a ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
Syſtem; and compare the Second glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Luminary of the Heavens to ſo unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
a Reſemblance? I have taken ſome Pains
to contemplate the Heavenly Bodies; and, by
Reading and Obſervation, am able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
ſome Part of their Excellence: Therefore
it is not probable, I ſhould deſcend to ſuch
trivial Compariſons; and liken a Planet, which,
haply, is not much leſs than our Earth, to a
thing ſo inconſiderable, as that you name—</p>
               <p>Pardon me, dear Couſin, interrupted Miſs
<hi>Glanville,</hi> laughing louder than before, if I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
myſelf a little with the Extravagance of
your Notions. Really I think, you have no
Reaſon to be angry, if I ſuppoſed you might
make a Compariſon between the Moon and
a Cream Cheeſe; ſince you ſay, that ſame
Moon, which don't appear broader than your
Gardener's Face, is not much leſs than the
whole World: Why, certainly, I have more
Reaſon to truſt my own Eyes, than ſuch whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical

                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> unwilling to expoſe her Couſin's Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
by a longer Diſpute upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
begged her to let it drop for the preſent;
and, turning to Sir <hi>George,</hi> I am very glad, ſaid
ſhe, that having always had ſome Inclination to
excuſe, and even defend, the Flight of <hi>Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſa</hi>
with <hi>Alexander,</hi> my Opinion is warranted
by that of a Perſon ſo generous as yourſelf: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
when we conſider, that this Princeſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook
her Brother's Dominions, and fled away
with a Lover whom ſhe did not hate; queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
her Enemies accuſe her, with ſome Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of Reaſon, of too great Imbecillity.</p>
               <p>But, Madam, replied Sir <hi>George,</hi> her Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
will not take the Pains to examine her
Reaſons for this Conduct—</p>
               <p>True, Sir, reſumed <hi>Arabella;</hi> for ſhe was in
Danger of ſeeing a Prince, who loved her, put to
a cruel and infamous Death upon a public Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold;
and ſhe did not reſolve to fly with him,
till all her Tears and Prayers were found in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual
to move the King her Brother to
Mercy.</p>
               <p>Tho', replied Sir <hi>George,</hi> I am extremely
angry with the indiſcreet <hi>Cepio,</hi> who diſcovered
<hi>Alexander</hi> to the <hi>Armenian</hi> King; yet what does
your Ladyſhip think of that gallant Action of
his, when he ſaw him upon the Scaffold, and
the Executioner ready to cut off his Head? How
brave it was of him, to paſs undauntedly thro'
the prodigious Number of Guards that environ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Scaffold; and, with his drawn Sword, run
the Executioner through-the Body, in the Sight
of them all! Then giving the Prince another
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0005700701:233"/>
Sword, engage more than Two thouſand Men
in his Defence!</p>
               <p>Queſtionleſs, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> it was a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Action; and when I think, how the King
of <hi>Armenia</hi> was enraged to ſee ſuch a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Soldiers fly from the Swords of Two
Men, I cannot chooſe but divert myſelf with
the Conſternation he was in: Yet that was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the horrible Deſpair, which tormented
him afterwards, when he found, that <hi>Alexander,</hi>
after being again taken and impriſoned, had
broken his Chains, and carried away with him
the Princeſs <hi>Artimeſa</hi> his Siſter.</p>

               <p>AS <hi>Arabella</hi> was in this Part of her Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
a Servant came to inform her, that
Sir <hi>Charles Glanville</hi> was juſt alighted. Upon
which, Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> flew to receive her Father;
and <hi>Arabella,</hi> walking a little ſlower after her,
gave Sir <hi>George</hi> an Opportunity of holding a little
longer Converſation with her.</p>
               <p>I dare believe, Madam, ſaid he, when you
read the Story of the unfortunate <hi>Alexander,</hi>
your fair Eyes did not refuſe to ſhed ſome
Tears at the barbarous and ſhameful Death
he was going to ſuffer: Yet I aſſure you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> me<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lancholy as his Situation was, it was alſo very
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0005700701:234"/>
glorious for him, ſince he had the ſublime
Satisfaction of dying for the Perſon he adored;
and had the raviſhing Pleaſure to know, that his
Fate would draw Tears from that lovely Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
for whom he ſacrificed his Life: Such a
Condition, Madam, ought to be envied rather
than pitied; for, next to the Happineſs of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing
the Perſon one adores, certainly the
Glory of dying for her is moſt to be coveted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> pleaſingly ſurpriſed to hear Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
ſo conformable to her own Ideas, looked
for a Moment upon the Baronet, with a moſt
inchanting Complaiſancy in her Eyes—</p>
               <p>It muſt be confeſſed, Sir, ſaid ſhe, that you
ſpeak very rationally upon theſe Matters; and
by the Tenderneſs and Generoſity of your Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents,
you give me Cauſe to believe, that
your Heart is prepoſſeſſed with ſome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Object
worthy of inſpiring them.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>George</hi> ſeeming, as if he ſtruggled to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
a Sigh; You are in the right, Madam,
ſaid he, to ſuppoſe, that if my Heart be
prepoſſeſſed with any Object, it is with one,
who is capable of inſpiring a very ſublime Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
and I aſſure you, if ever it ſubmits to any
Fetters, they ſhall be impoſed on me by the
faireſt Perſon in the World—</p>
               <p>Since Love is not voluntary, replied <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi>
ſmiling, it may happen, that your Heart
may be ſurpriſed by a meaner Beauty, than
ſuch a one as you deſcribe: However, as a
Lover has always an extraordinary Partiality
for the beloved Object, 'tis probable, what
you ſay may come to paſs; and you may be
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0005700701:235"/>
in Love with the faireſt Perſon in the World,
in your own Opinion.</p>
               <p>They were now ſo near the Houſe, that Sir
<hi>George</hi> could reply no other ways, than by a very
paſſionate Glance, which <hi>Arabella</hi> did not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
being in haſte to pay her Reſpects to her
Uncle, whom ſhe met juſt going to Mr. <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville.</hi>
Her Looks were directed to him. Sir
<hi>Charles</hi> ſaluting her with great Affection, they
all went into Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi>'s Chamber, who
received his Father with the utmoſt Reſpect and
Tenderneſs; extremely regretting the Trouble
he had been at in taking a Journey to the
Caſtle upon his Account; and gently blaming
his Siſter for her Precipitancy in alarming him
ſo ſoon.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> extremely overjoyed to find him
ſo well recovered, would not allow him to
blame Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> for what ſhe had done:
but, addreſſing himſelf to his Niece, he thanked
her for the Care ſhe had taken of Mr. <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
in very obliging Terms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella</hi> could not help bluſhing at her
Uncle's Compliment, ſuppoſing he thanked her
for having reſtored her Couſin to his Health.</p>
               <p>I aſſure you, Sir, ſaid ſhe, Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> is
leſs obliged to my Commands, than to the
Goodneſs of his Conſtitution, for his Recovery;
and herein he was not ſo obedient, as many
Perſons I could name to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> willing to prevent the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany's
Obſervation upon this Speech, began to
acquaint his Father with the Riſe and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
of his Diſtemper: But though the old

Son, while he was ſpeaking; yet not having loſt
a Word of what <hi>Arabella</hi> had ſaid, as ſoon as he
was done, he turned to his Niece, and aſked
her, how ſhe could be ſo unjuſt, to accuſe his
Son of Diſobedience, becauſe he did not reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
when ſhe commanded him? Why, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
added he, you want to carry your Power
farther then ever any Beauty did before you;
ſince you pretend to make People ſick and well,
whenever you pleaſe.</p>
               <p>Really, Sir, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> I pretend to
no more Power, than what I preſume all others
of my Sex have upon the like Occaſions; and
ſince nothing is more common, than for a
Gentleman, though ever ſo ſick, to recover in
Obedience to the Commands of that Perſon,
who has an abſolute Power over his Life, I
conceive, I have a Right to think myſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured,
if Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> contrary to mine, had
thought proper to die—</p>
               <p>Since, ſaid the old Gentlemen, ſmiling, my
Son has ſo well obeyed your Commands in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
his Health, I ſhall tremble, leſt, in
Obedience to a contrary Command of yours, he
ſhould die, and deprive me of an Heir; a Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
which, if it ſhould happen, I ſhould
place to your Account.</p>
               <p>I aſſure you, Sir, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> very gravely,
I have too great an Eſteem for Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi>
to condemn him to ſo ſevere a Puniſhment as
Death for light Offences: And ſince it is not
very probable, that he will ever commit ſuch
Crimes againſt me, as can be only expiated by
his Death; ſuch as Infidelity, Diſobedience,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0005700701:237"/>
and the like; you have no Reaſon to fear ſuch
a Misfortune by my means—</p>
               <p>Alas! replied Sir <hi>George,</hi> you Beauties make
very nice Diſtinctions in theſe Caſes; and
think, if you do not directly command your
Lovers to die, you are no-ways accountable for
their Death: And when a Lover, as it often
happens, dies through Deſpair of ever being able
to make himſelf beloved; or, being doomed to
Baniſhment or Silence, falls into a Fever, from
which nothing but Kindneſs can recover him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>Sir <hi>Charles</hi> and Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> were ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tremely

and Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> though he would have wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
he had been raillying any other Perſon's Follies
than his Couſin's, yet could not help ſmiling at
the ſolemn Accent, in which he delivered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> mightily pleaſed with his Manner of
talking, was reſolved to furniſh him with more
Occaſions of diverting the Company at her Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.</p>
               <p>I ſee, anſwered ſhe, you are one of thoſe
Perſons, who call a juſt Decorum, which all
Ladies, who love Glory as they ought to do,
are obliged to preſerve, by the Name of Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:
But pray, what would you have a Lady
do, whom an importunate Lover preſumes to
declare his Paſſion to? You know it is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0005700701:238"/>
us to liſten to ſuch Diſcourſes; and
you know alſo, whoever is guilty of ſuch an
Offence, merits a moſt rigorous Puniſhment:
Moreover, you find, that when a Sentence of
Baniſhment or Silence is pronounced upon them,
theſe unhappy Criminals are ſo conſcious of the
of Juſtice their Doom, that they never murmur
againſt their Judge who condemns them; and
therefore, whatever are their Fates, in Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of that Anger they have incurred, the
Ladies, thus offended, ought not to be charged
with it, as any cruel Exertion of their Power.</p>
               <p>Such Eloquence as yours, Madam, replied
Sir <hi>George,</hi> might defend Things yet more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtifiable:
However, you muſt give me Leave,
as being intereſted in the Safety of my Sex,
ſtill to be of Opinion, that no Man ought to
be hated, becauſe he adores a beautiful Object,
and conſecrates all his Moments to her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
               <p>Queſtionleſs, reſumed <hi>Arabella,</hi> he will not
be hated, while, out of the Reſpect and Reverence
he bears her, he carefully conceals his Paſſion
from her Knowlege; but as ſoon as ever he
breaks through the Bounds, which that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
preſcribes him, and lets her underſtand
his true Sentiments, he has Reaſon to expect
a moſt rigorous Sentence, ſince he certainly, by
that Preſumption, has greatly deſerved it.</p>
               <p>If the Ladies, replied Sir <hi>George,</hi> were more
equitable, and would make ſome Diſtinction
between thoſe who really love them in a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate
and reſpectful Silence, and others who
do not feel the Power of their Charms, they
might ſpare themſelves the Trouble of hearing
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0005700701:239"/>
what ſo mortally offends them: But when a
Lady ſees a Man every Day, who by his Looks,
Sighs, and Solicitude to pleaſe her, by his num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs
Services and conſtant Attendance of her,
makes it evident, that his Soul is poſſeſſed with
a violent Paſſion for her; I ſay, when a Lady
ſees, and yet will not ſee, all this, and perſiſts
in uſing a paſſionate Adorer with all the Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
due to a Man wholly inſenſible of the
Power of her Charms; what muſt he do in
ſuch a mortifying Situation, but make known
his Torments to her that occaſions them, in
order to prevail upon her to have ſome Senſe
of what he does and feels hourly for her ſake?</p>
               <p>But ſince he gains nothing by the Diſcovery
of his Paſſion, reſumed <hi>Arabella;</hi> but, on the
contrary, loſes the Advantages he was before
poſſeſſed of, which were very great, ſince he
might ſee and diſcourſe with his Miſtreſs every
Day; and, haply, have the Honour to do her a great
many petty Services, and receive ſome of her
Commands; all theſe Advantages he loſes, when
he declares he loves: And truly, I think, a Man
who is ſo unwiſe as to hazard a certain Happineſs
for a very improbable Hope, deſerves to be
puniſhed, as well for his Folly as Preſumption;
and, upon both theſe Accounts, Baniſhment is
not too rigorous a Sentence.</p>

or Obſervation, with the utmoſt Contempt.
How often have you and I, Sir <hi>George,</hi> purſued
he, pitied the Condition of the few Men of
Senſe, who are ſometimes among the Croud of
Beaux, who attend the Two Siſter Beauties
to all Places of polite Diverſion in Town? For
thoſe Ladies think it a mortal Injury done to
their Charms, if the Men about them have
Eyes or Ears for any Object but their Faces,
or any Sound but that of their Voices: So that
the Connoiſſeurs in Muſic, who attend them to
<hi>Ranelagh,</hi> muſt ſtop their Ears, like <hi>Ulyſſes,</hi>
when the <hi>Siren Fraſi</hi> ſings; and the Wits, who
gallant them to the Side box, muſt lay a much
greater Conſtraint upon themſelves, in order to
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0005700701:241"/>
reſiſt the Soul-moving <hi>Garrick;</hi> and appear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible,
while he is upon the Stage.</p>
               <p>Upon my Soul, added Sir <hi>George</hi> (forgetting
the Character he aſſumed) when I have ſeen
ſome Perſons of my Acquaintance talking to
the eldeſt of theſe Ladies, while one of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greve</hi>'s
Comedies has been acting; his Face
quite turned from the Stage, and hers over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread
with an eternal Smile; her fine Eyes
ſometimes lifted up in a beautiful Surprize, and
a little inchanting Giggle half-hid with her Fan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
in ſpite of their Inattention, I have been ready
to imagine, he was entertaining her with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
upon the Play, which ſhe was judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
enough to underſtand; and yet I have
afterwards been informed by himſelf, that
nothing was leſs in their Thoughts; and
all that Variety in her Face, and that extreme
ſeeming Earneſtneſs in his Diſcourſe, was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
by the moſt trifling Subjects imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able:
He perhaps had been telling her, how
the Sight of her Squirrel, which peeped out of
her Pocket, ſurpriſed ſome Ladies ſhe was
viſiting; and what they ſaid upon her Pondneſs
for it, when ſhe was gone; blaming them at the
ſame time for their want of Delicacy, in not
knowing how to ſet a right Value upon ſuch
pleaſing Animals: Hence proceeded her Smiles,
the lifting up of her Eyes, the half-ſtifled
Laugh, and all the pretty Geſtures that appeared
ſo wonderfully charming to all thoſe who did
not hear their Diſcourſe: And it is upon ſuch
Trifies as theſe, or elſe on the inexhauſtible
Subject of their Charms, that all who are am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0005700701:242"/>
of being near theſe Miracles, are under
a Neceſſity of talking.</p>
               <p>And pray, interrupted <hi>Arabella,</hi> What Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
afford Matter for a more pleaſing Variety
of Converſation, than thoſe of Beauty and
Love? Can we ſpeak of any Object ſo capable
of delighting as Beauty, or of any Paſſion of the
Mind more ſublime and pleaſing than Love?</p>
               <p>With Submiſſion, Madam, ſaid <hi>Glanville,</hi> I
conceive, all that can be ſaid, either of Beauty,
or of Love, may be compriſed in a very few
Words: All who have Eyes, and behold true
Beauty, will be ready to confeſs it is a very
pleaſing Object; and all that can be ſaid of it,
may be ſaid in very few Words; for when we
have run over the Catalogue of Charms, and
mentioned fine Eyes, fine Hair, delicate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,
regular Features, and an elegant Shape,
we can only add a few Epithets more, ſuch as
Lovely, Dangerous, Inchanting, Inreſiſtible,
and the like; and every thing that can be ſaid
of Beauty is exhauſted. And ſo likewiſe it is
with Love; we know that Admiration pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes
it, that Beauty kindles it, Hope keeps it
alive, and Deſpair puts an End to it; and that
Subject may be as ſoon diſcuſſed as the other,
by the judicious Uſe of proper Words; ſuch as
Wounds, Darts, Fires, Languiſhings, Dyings,
Torture, Rack, Jealouſy, and a few more of
no Signification, but upon th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s Subject.</p>
               <p>Certainly, Sir, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> you have not
well conſidered what you ſay, ſince you main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that Love and Beauty are Subjects eaſily
and quickly diſcuſſed: Take the Pains, I beſeech
you, to reflect a little upon thoſe numerous and
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0005700701:243"/>
long Converſations, which theſe Subjects have
given Riſe to in <hi>Clelia,</hi> and the <hi>Grand Cyrus,</hi>
where the moſt illuſtrious and greateſt Perſonages
in the World manage the Diſputes; and the
agreeable Diverſity of their Sentiments on thoſe
Heads affords a moſt pleaſing and rational En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment:
You will there find, that the
greateſt Conquerors, and Heroes of invincible
Valour, reaſon with the moſt exact and ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
Nicety upon Love and Beauty; the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority
of fair and brown Hair controverted
by Warriors, with as much Eagerneſs as they
diſpute for Victory in the Field; and the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Effects of that Paſſion upon different
Hearts defined with the utmoſt Accuracy and
Eloquence.</p>
               <p>I muſt own, interrupted Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> I
ſhould have but a mean Opinion of thoſe
Warriors, as you call them, who could buſy
themſelves in talking of ſuch Trifles; and be
apt to imagine ſuch inſignificant Fellows, who
could wrangle about the Colour of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes
Hair, would be the firſt to turn their
Backs upon the Enemy in Battle.</p>
               <p>Is it poſſible, Sir, reſumed <hi>Arabella,</hi> glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with Indignation, that you can entertain
ſuch unworthy Thoughts of Heroes, who merit
the Admiration and Praiſe of all Ages for
their ineſtimable Valour, whom the Spears of
a whole Army oppoſed to each of their ſingle
Swords would not oblige to fly? What think
you, Sir, purſued ſhe, looking at Sir <hi>George,</hi> of
the injurious Words my Uncle has uttered
againſt thoſe heroic Princes, whoſe Courage, I
believe, you are as well acquainted with as my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0005700701:244"/>
The great <hi>Oroondates,</hi> the invincible <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taban,</hi>
the valiant and fortunate <hi>Artamenes,</hi> the
irreſiſtible <hi>Juba,</hi> the incomparable <hi>Cleomedon,</hi>
and an hundred other Heroes I could name, are
all injured by this unjuſt Aſſertion of my Uncle;
ſince certainly they were not more famous for
their noble and wonderful Actions in War, than
for the Sublimity and Conſtancy of their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
in Love.</p>
               <p>Some of theſe Heroes you have named, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
Sir <hi>George,</hi> had the Misfortune, even in
their Lives, to be very cruelly vilified: The
great <hi>Oroondates</hi> was a long time accuſed of
Treachery to his Divine Princeſs; the valiant
and unfortunate <hi>Artamenes</hi> was ſuſpected of
Inconſtancy; and the irreſiſtible <hi>Juba</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
with Infidelity and Baſeneſs, by both
his Miſtreſs and Friend.</p>
               <p>I never knew you was ſo well acquainted
with theſe Perſons, interrupted Mr. <hi>Glanville;</hi>
and I fanſy it is but very lately that you have
given yourſelf the Trouble to read Romances.</p>
               <p>I am not of your Opinion, ſaid <hi>Arabella.</hi>
Sir <hi>George,</hi> queſtionleſs, has appropriated great
Part of his Time to the Peruſal of thoſe Books,
ſo capable of improving him in all uſeful Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege;
the Sublimity of Love, and the Quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of Valour; which Two Qualities, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
in a ſuperlative Degree, form a true and
perfect Hero, as the Perfection of Beauty, Wit,
and Virtue, make a Heroine worthy to be ſerved
by ſuch an illuſtrious Perſonage; and I dare
ſay, Sir <hi>George</hi> has profited ſo much by the
great Examples of Fidelity and Courage he has
placed before his Eyes, that no Conſideration
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0005700701:245"/>
whatever could make him for one Moment
fail in his Conſtancy to the Divine Beauty he
adores; and, inſpired by her Charms, he would
ſcorn to turn his Back, as my Uncle phraſes it,
upon an Army of an hundred thouſand Men.</p>
               <p>I am extremely obliged to you, Madam, ſaid
Sir <hi>George,</hi> bowing his Head to the Ground,
to hide a Smile he could not poſſibly reſtrain,
for the good Opinion you have of my Courage
and Fidelity.</p>
               <p>As for Sir <hi>George</hi>'s Courage, Couſin, ſaid
Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> laughing, I never diſputed it:
And though it be indeed a very extraordinary
Exertion of it, to fight ſingly againſt an Army
of an hundred thouſand Men; yet ſince you are
pleaſed to think it probable, I am as willing to
believe Sir <hi>George</hi> may do it as any other Man;
but, as for his Fidelity in Matters of Love, I
greatly ſuſpect it, ſince he has been charged
with ſome very flagrant Crimes of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>How, Sir! reſumed <hi>Arabella,</hi> Have you ever
been faithleſs then? and, after having ſworn,
haply, to devote your whole Life to the Service
of ſome Beauty, have you ever violated your
Oaths, and been baſe enough to forſake her?</p>
               <p>I have too much Complaiſance, Madam,
ſaid Sir <hi>George,</hi> to contradict Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi>
who has been pleaſed poſitively to aſſert, that
I have been faithleſs, as you moſt unkindly
phraſe it.</p>
               <p>Nay, Sir, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> this Accuſation
is not of a Nature to be neglected; and though
a King ſhould ſay it, I conceive, if you are
innocent, you have a Right to contradict him,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0005700701:246"/>
and clear yourſelf: Do you conſider how deeply
this Aſſertion wounds your Honour and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
for the future? What Lady, think you,
will receive your Services, loaded as you are
with the terrible Imputation of Inconſtancy?</p>
               <p>Oh! as for that, Madam, ſaid Miſs <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
I believe no Lady will think the worſe
of Sir <hi>George</hi> for being faithleſs: For my
Part, I declare, nothing pleaſes me ſo much,
as gaining a Lover from another Lady; which
is a greater Compliment to one's Beauty, then
the Addreſſes of a Man that never was in Love
before—</p>
               <p>You may remember, Couſin, replied <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi>
that I ſaid once before, your Spirit and
Humour reſembled a certain great Princeſs very
much; and I repeat it again, never was there
a greater Conformity in Tempers and Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>My Daughter, ſaid Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> is mightily
obliged to you, Lady <hi>Bella,</hi> for comparing her
to a great Princeſs: Undoubtedly you mean it
as a Compliment.</p>
               <p>If you think, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> that barely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
her to a Princeſs be a Compliment, I
muſt take the Liberty to differ from you: My
Couſin is not ſo many Degrees below a Princeſs,
as that ſuch a Compariſon ſhould be thought
extraordinary; for if her Anceſtors did not
wear a Crown, they might, haply, have deſerved
it; and her Beauty may one Day procure her
a Servant, whoſe Sword, like that of the great
<hi>Artaban,</hi> may win her a Sceptre; who, with a
noble Confidence, told his Princeſs, when the
Want of a Crown was objected to him, I wear
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0005700701:247"/>
a Sword, Madam, than can perform things
more difficult, that what you require; and if
a Crown be all that I want to make me worthy
of you, tell me what Kingdom in the World
you chooſe to reign in, and I will lay it at your
Feet.</p>
               <p>That was a Promiſe, replied Sir <hi>George,</hi> fit
only for the great <hi>Artaban</hi> to make: But, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
if you will permit me to make any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
between that renowned Warrior and
myſelf, I would venture to tell you, that even
the great <hi>Artaban</hi> was not exempted from the
Character of Inconſtancy any more than my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
ſince, as you certainly know, he was in
Love with Three great Princeſſes ſucceſſively.</p>
               <p>I grant you, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> that <hi>Artaban</hi>
did wear the Chains of Three Princeſſes ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively:
But it muſt alſo be remembred in his
Juſtification, that the Two Firſt of theſe Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
refuſed his Adorations, and treated him with
Contempt, becauſe he was not a Prince: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
recovering his Liberty, by thoſe Diſdains
they caſt on him, he preſerved that illuſtrious
Heart from Deſpair, to tender it with more
paſſionate Fidelity to the Divine Princeſs of the
<hi>Parthians;</hi> who, though greatly their Superior
in Quality and Beauty, did permit him to love
her. However, I muſt confeſs, I find ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
like Levity in the Facility he found in
breaking his Fetters ſo often; and when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
that among all thoſe great Heroes, whoſe
Hiſtories I have read, none but himſelf ever
bore, without dying, the Cruelties he experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced
from thoſe Princeſſes, I am ſometimes
tempted to accuſe him myſelf of Inconſtancy:
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0005700701:248"/>
But indeed every thing we read of that Prodigy
of Valour is wholly miraculous; and ſince the
Performance of Impoſſibilities was reſerved for
him, I conclude this Miracle alſo, among many
others, was poſſible to him, whom nothing was
ever able to reſiſt upon Earth. However, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
ſhe, riſing, I ſhall not abſolutely condemn
you, till I have heard your Adventures from
your own Mouth, at a convenient Time, when
I ſhall be able to judge how far you merit the
odious Appellation of Inconſtancy.</p>
               <p>Saying this, ſhe ſaluted her Uncle, who had
for ſome time been converſing in a low Voice
with his Son, with a Grace wholly charming,
and retired to her Apartment. Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi>
following her a few Moments after (the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment,
extravagant as it was, which ſhe had
paid her, having procured her ſome Good-will
from the vain and intereſted Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi>),
they converſed together with a great deal of
good Humour till Dinner-time, which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> was not abſolutely reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
was ſerved in his Chamber.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. IV.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>In which our Heroine is engaged in a new
Adventure.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AS Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> took a great deal of Pains
to turn the Diſcourſe upon Subjects, on
which the charming <hi>Arabella</hi> could expatiate,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0005700701:249"/>
without any Mixture of that Abſurdity, which
mingled itſelf in a great many others; the reſt
of that Day and ſeveral others, were paſſed
very agreeably: At the End of which, Mr.
<hi>Glanville</hi> being perfectly recovered, and able to
go abroad; the Baronet propoſed to take the
Diverſion of Hunting; which <hi>Arabella,</hi> who
was uſed to it, conſented to partake of; but
being informed, that Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> could not
ride, and choſe to ſtay at home, ſhe would
have kept her Company, had not Sir <hi>Charles</hi>
inſiſted upon the contrary.</p>
               <p>As Sir <hi>George,</hi> and ſome other Gentlemen,
had invited themſelves to be of the Party; <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi>
on her coming down to mount her Horſe,
found a great many young Gallants, ready to
offer her their Aſſiſtance upon this Occaſion:
Accepting therefore, with great Politeneſs, this
Help from a Stranger, who was neareſt her, ſhe
mounted her Horſe, giving Occaſion to every
one that was preſent, to admire the Grace with
which ſhe ſat and managed him. Her Shape
being as perfect as any Shape could poſſibly be,
her Riding-habit diſcovered all its Beauties:
Her Hat, and the white Feather waving over
Part of her fine black Hair, gave a peculiar
Charm to her lovely Face: And ſhe appeared
with ſo many Advantages in this Dreſs and
Poſture, that Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> forgetting all her
Abſurdities, was wholly loſt in the Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſo many Charms, as her whole Perſon
was adorned with.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>George,</hi> though he really admired <hi>Arabella,</hi>
was not ſo paſſionately in Love as Mr. <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville;</hi>
and, being a keen Sportſman, eagerly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0005700701:250"/>
the Game, with the reſt of the Hunters;
but Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> minded nothing but his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin,
and kept cloſe by her.</p>
               <p>After having rode a long time, <hi>Arabella,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
it a Piece of Cruelty, not to give her
Lover an Opportunity of talking to her, as, by
his extreme Solicitude, he ſeemed ardently to
deſire, coming to a delightful Valley, ſhe ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped;
and told Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> that, being weary
of the Chace, ſhe ſhould alight, and repoſe
herſelf a little under the Shade of thoſe Trees.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> extremely pleaſed at this
Propoſition, diſmounted; and, having helped
her to alight, ſeated himſelf by her on the
Graſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> expecting he would begin to talk to
her of his Paſſion, could not help bluſhing at the
Thoughts of having given him ſuch an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity;
and Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> endeavouring to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate
himſelf to her Ideas of a Lover,
expreſſed himſelf in Terms extravagant enough
to have made a reaſonable Woman think he
was making a Jeſt of her: All which, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<hi>Arabella</hi> was extremely pleaſed with; and
ſhe obſerved ſuch a juſt Decorum in her An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers,
that, as the Writers of Romance phraſe
it, if ſhe did not give him any abſolute Hopes
of being beloved, yet ſhe ſaid enough to make
him conclude ſhe did not hate him.</p>
               <p>They had converſed in this manner near a
Quarter of an Hour, when <hi>Arabella,</hi> perceiving
a Man at a little Diſtance, walking very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſedly,
ſhrieked out aloud; and, riſing with the
utmoſt Precipitation, flew from Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi>
and went to untie her Horſe; while his Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0005700701:251"/>
being ſo great at her Behaviour, that
he could not, for a Moment or two, aſk her
the Cauſe of her Fear—</p>
               <p>Do you not ſee, ſaid ſhe, out of Breath with
the Violence of her Apprehenſions, the Perſon
who is coming towards us? It is the ſame,
who, ſome Months ago, attempted to carry me
away, when I was riding out with only Two
Attendants: I eſcaped, for that time, the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
that threatened me; but, queſtionleſs, he
comes now to renew his Attempts: Therefore
can you wonder at my Fear?</p>
               <p>If it ſhould be as you ſay, Madam, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
<hi>Glanville,</hi> What Reaſon have you to
fear? Do you not think I am able to defend
you?</p>
               <p>Ah! without Doubt, you are able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
me, anſwered ſhe; and though, if you
offer to reſiſt the Violence he comes to uſe
againſt me, he will, haply, call Two or Three
Dozen armed Men to his Aſſiſtance, who are,
I ſuppoſe, concealed hereabouts, yet I am
not apprehenſive, that you will be worſted
by them: But as it happened to the brave <hi>Juba,</hi>
and <hi>Cleomedon,</hi> while they were fighting with
ſome hundred Men, who wanted to carry away
their Princeſſes before their Faces; and were
giving Death at every Blow, in order to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
them; the Commander of theſe Raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
ſeeing the Two Princeſſes ſitting, as I
was, under a Tree, ordered them to be
ſeized by Two of his Men, and carried away,
while the Two Princes were loſing beſt Part of
of their Blood in their Defence; therefore,
to prevent ſuch an Accident happening, while
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0005700701:252"/>
you are fighting for my Reſcue, I think it will
be the ſafeſt Way for me to get on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
that I may be in a Condition to eſcape;
and that you may not employ your Valour to
no Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Saying this, having, with Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi>'s
Aſſiſtance, looſed her Horſe from the Tree, he
helped her to mount, and then remounted his
own.</p>
               <p>Your Antagoniſt, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> is on Foot;
and therefore, though I prize your Life ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely,
yet I cannot diſpenſe with myſelf
from telling you, that 'tis againſt the Laws of
Knighthood to take any Advantage of that
kind over your Enemy; nor will I permit your
Concern for my Safety to make you forget
what you owe to your own Reputation.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> fretting exceſſively at her
Folly, begged her not to make herſelf uneaſy
about things that were never likely to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.</p>
               <p>The Gentleman yonder, added he, ſeems to
have no Deſigns to make any Attempt againſt
you: If he ſhould, I ſhall know how to deal
with him: But, ſince he neither offers to aſſault
me, nor affront you, I think we ought not to
give him any Reaſon to imagine we ſuſpect him,
by gazing on him thus; and letting him under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
by your Manner, that he is the Subject of
our Converſation: If you pleaſe, Madam, we
will endeavour to join our Company.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> while he was ſpeaking, kept her
Eyes fixed upon his Face, with Looks which
expreſſed her Thoughts were labouring upon
ſome very important Point: And, after a Pauſe
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0005700701:253"/>
of ſome Moments, Is it poſſible, ſaid ſhe, with
a Tone of extreme Surprize, that I ſhould be
ſo miſtaken in you? Do you really want Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
enough to defend me againſt that Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſher?</p>
               <p>Oh Heavens! Madam, interrupted <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
try not my Temper thus: Courage
enough to defend you! 'Sdeath! you will make
me mad! Who, in the Name of Wonder, is
going to moleſt you?</p>
               <p>He whom you ſee there, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi>
pointing to him with her Finger: For know,
cold and inſenſible as thou art to the Danger
which threatens me, yonder Knight is thy Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,
and a Rival, haply, who deſerves my Eſteem
better than thou doſt; ſince, if he has Courage
enough to get me by Violence into his Power,
that ſame Courage would make him defend
me againſt any Injuries I might be offered from
another: And ſince nothing is ſo contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in the Eyes of a Woman, as a Lover who
wants Spirit to die in her Defence; know, I
can ſooner pardon him, whom thou would
cowardly fly from, for the Violence which he
meditates againſt me, than thyſelf for the
Puſillanimity thou haſt betrayed in my Sight.</p>
               <p>With theſe Words, ſhe galloped away from
her aſtoniſhed Lover; who, not daring to follow
her, for fear of increaſing her Suſpicions of his
Cowardice, flung himſelf off his Horſe in a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Rage; and, forgetting that the Stranger was
obſerving, and now within Hearing, he fell ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing
and exclaiming againſt the Books, that
had turned his Couſin's Brain; and railing at
his own ill Fate, that condemned him to the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0005700701:254"/>
Puniſhment of loving her. Mr. <hi>Harvey</hi> (for it
really was he, whom an Affair of Conſequence
had brought again into the Country), hearing
ſome of Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi>'s laſt Words, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
the Geſtures he uſed, concluded he
had been treated like himſelf by <hi>Arabella,</hi> whom
he knew again at a Diſtance: Therefore coming
up to Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> laughing—</p>
               <p>Though I have not the Honour of knowing
you, Sir, ſaid he, I muſt beg the Favour you
will inform me, if you are not diſturbed at the
ridiculous Folly of the Lady I ſaw with you
juſt now? She is the moſt fantaſtical Creature
that ever lived, and, in my Opinion, fit for a
Mad-houſe: Pray, are you acquainted with
her?</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> being in a very ill Humour,
could not brook the Freedom of this Language
againſt his Couſin, whoſe Follies he could not
bear any one ſhould rail at but himſelf; and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
provoked at his Sneers, and the Interruption
he had given to their Converſation, he looked
upon him with a diſdainful Frown, and told him
in an haughty Tone, That he was very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
to ſpeak of a Lady of her Quality and
Merit ſo rudely.</p>
               <p>Oh! Sir, I beg your Pardon, replied Mr.
<hi>Harvey,</hi> laughing more than before; What, I
ſuppoſe, you are the Champion of this fair Lady!
But, I aſſure myſelf, if you intend to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
with every one that will laugh at her, you
will have more Buſineſs upon your Hands than
you can well manage.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> tranſported with Rage at this
Inſolence, hit him ſuch a Blow with the But-End
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0005700701:255"/>
of his Whip, that it ſtunned him for a
Moment; but recovering himſelf, he drew his
Sword, and, mad with the Affront he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
made a Puſh at <hi>Glanville;</hi> who, avoiding
it with great Dexterity, had recourſe to his
Hanger for his Defence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> in the mean time, who had not rid
far, concealing herſelf behind ſome Trees, ſaw
all the Actions of her Lover, and intended
Raviſher; and, being poſſeſſed with an Opinion
of her Couſin's Cowardice, was extremely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced
to ſee him fall upon his Enemy firſt, and
that with ſo much Fury, that ſhe had no longer
any Reaſon to doubt his Courage: Her Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions,
therefore, being removed, her Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
for him returned; and when ſhe ſaw
them engaged with their Swords (for, at that
Diſtance, ſhe did not plainly perceive the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of their Weapons), her Apprehenſions
for her Couſin were ſo ſtrong, that, though ſhe
did not doubt his Valour, ſhe could not bear
to ſee him expoſe his Life for her: And, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
making any Reflections upon the Singularity
of her Deſign, ſhe was going to ride up to them,
and endeavour to part them; when ſhe ſaw ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Men come towards them, whom ſhe took
to be the Aſſiſtants of her Raviſher, though
they were, in reality, Haymakers; who, at a
Diſtance, having ſeen the Beginning of their
Quarrel, had haſtened to part them.</p>
               <p>Terrified, therefore, at this Reinforcement,
which ſhe thought would expoſe her Couſin to
great Danger, ſhe galloped, with all Speed,
after the Hunters, being directed by the Sound
of the Horn. Her Anxiety for her Couſin made
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0005700701:256"/>
her regardleſs of her own Danger, ſo that ſhe
rode with a ſurpriſing Swiftneſs; and, overtaking
the Company, ſhe would have ſpoken, to tell
them of her Couſin's Situation; when her
Spirits failing her, ſhe could only make a Sign
with her Hand, and ſunk down in a Swoon, in
the Arms of Sir <hi>George,</hi> who eagerly galloped
up to her; and, ſupporting her as well as he
was able till ſome others came to her Relief,
they took her off her Horſe, and placed her
upon the Ground; when, by the Help of ſome
Water they brought from a Spring near them,
in a little time ſhe came to herſelf.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> who, ſeeing her come up to them
without his Son, and by her fainting, concluded
ſome Misfortune had happened to him, the
Moment ſhe opened her Eyes, aſked her eagerly,
Where he was?</p>
               <p>Your Son, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> ſighing, is, with a
Valour equal to that of the brave <hi>Cleomedon,</hi>
this Moment fighting in my Defence againſt a
Croud of Enemies; and is, haply, ſhedding
the laſt Drop of his Blood in my Quarrel.</p>
               <p>Shedding the laſt Drop of his Blood, <hi>haply!</hi>
interrupted Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> exceſſively grieved; and,
not a little enraged at <hi>Arabella,</hi> ſuppoſing ſhe
had introduced him into ſome Quarrel, It may
be <hi>happy</hi> for you, Madam; but I am ſure it
will make me very miſerable, if my Son comes
to any Harm.</p>
               <p>If it be the Will of Heaven he ſhould fall in
this Combat, reſumed <hi>Arabella,</hi> he can never
have a more glorious Deſtiny: And as that
Conſideration will, doubtleſs, ſweeten his laſt
Moments, ſo it ought to be your Conſolation:
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0005700701:257"/>
However, I beg you'll loſe no time, but haſte
to his Aſſiſtance; for ſince he has a conſiderable
Number of Enemies to deal with, 'tis not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable
but he may be overpowered at laſt.</p>
               <p>Where did you leave my Son, Madam? cried
Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> eagerly.</p>
               <p>He is not far off, replied <hi>Arabella:</hi> And you
will, doubtleſs, be directed to the Place, by the
Sight of the Blood of his Enemies, which he
has ſpilt. Go that way, purſued ſhe, pointing
with her Finger towards the Place where ſhe
had left her Couſin: There you will meet with
him, amidſt a Croud of Foes, which he is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſicing
to my Safety, and his juſt Reſentment.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> not knowing what to think, gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loped
away, followed by moſt Part of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;
Sir <hi>George</hi> telling Lady <hi>Bella,</hi> that he
would ſtay to defend her againſt any Attempts
that might be made on her Liberty, by any of
her Raviſher's Servants, who were, probably,
ſtraggling about. <hi>Arabella,</hi> however, being
perfectly recovered, inſiſted upon following her
Uncle.</p>
               <p>There is no Queſtion, ſaid ſhe, but Mr.
<hi>Glanville</hi> is victorious: I am only apprehenſive
for the dangerous Wounds he may have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in the Combat, which will require all
our Care and Aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>George,</hi> who wanted to engroſs her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
a little to himſelf, in vain repreſented to
her, that, amidſt the Horrors of a Fight ſo
bloody as that muſt certainly be, in which Mr.
<hi>Glanville</hi> and his Friends would be now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged,
it would be dangerous for her to venture
her Perſon: Yet ſhe would not be perſuaded;
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0005700701:258"/>
but, having mounted her Horſe, with his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance,
ſhe rode as faſt as ſhe was able after
the reſt of the Company.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>SIR <hi>Charles,</hi> who, by this Time, had got
to the Place ſhe directed him to, but ſaw
no Appearance of fighting, and only a few
Haymakers in Diſcourſe together, inquired, If
there had been any Quarrel between two Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in that Place?</p>
               <p>One of them, at this Queſtion, advancing,
told Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> that two Gentlemen had quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled
there, and were fighting with Swords;
but that they had parted them; and that one of
them, having an Horſe tied to a Tree, mounted
him, and rode away: That the other, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
was not far off; and that there had
been no Bloodſhed, they having come time
enough to prevent it.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Charles</hi> was extremely ſatisfied with this
Account; and, giving the Haymakers ſome
Money for the good Office they did in parting
the two Combatants, rode up to meet Lady
<hi>Bella;</hi> and informed her, that his Son was ſafe.</p>
               <p>I cannot imagine he is ſafe, replied ſhe, when
I ſee ſome of his Enemies (pointing to the Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers)
ſtill alive: It is not cuſtomary, in thoſe
Caſes, to ſuffer any to eſcape: And, queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0005700701:259"/>
my Couſin is either dead, or a Priſoner,
ſince all his Adverſaries are not vanquiſhed.</p>
               <p>Why, you dream, Madam, replied Sir <hi>Charles:</hi>
Thoſe Fellows yonder are Haymakers: What
ſhould make them Enemies to my Son? They
were lucky enough to come in time to prevent
him and another Gentleman from doing each
other a Miſchief. I cannot imagine for what
Reaſon my Son quarrelled with that Perſon they
ſpeak of: Perhaps you can inform me.</p>
               <p>Certainly, Sir, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> I can inform you,
ſince I was the Cauſe of their Quarrel. The
Story is too long to tell you now; and, beſides,
it is ſo connected with the other Accidents of
my Life, that 'tis neceſſary you ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with my whole Hiſtory, in order to
comprehend it: But, if thoſe Perſons are what
you ſay, and did really part my Couſin and his
Antagoniſt, truly I believe they have done him
a very ill Office: For, I am perſuaded, my
Couſin will never be at Reſt, till, by his Rival's
Death, he has freed himſelf from one, capable of
the moſt daring Enterprizes to get me into his
Power: And, ſince I cannot be in Security
while he lives, and perſiſts in the Reſolution he
has taken to perſecute me, it had been better if
he had ſuffered all the Effects of my Couſin's
Reſentment at that time, than to give him the
Trouble to hunt him through the World, in
order to ſacrifice him to the Intereſt of his Love
and Vengeance.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> no leſs aſtoniſhed than alarmed
at this Diſcovery of his Niece's ſanguinary Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents,
told her, he was ſorry to ſee a Lady ſo

<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0005700701:260"/>
and incite Men to ſuch Extremities,
upon her Account. And, for the future, added
he, I muſt intreat you, Niece, to ſpare me the
Affliction of ſeeing my Son expoſed to theſe
dangerous Quarrels: For, though his Life is ſo
little regarded by you, yet it is of the utmoſt
Conſequence to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> who found Matter ſufficient in the
Beginning of this Speech, to be offended with
her Uncle, yet, miſtaking the latter Part of it
for a pathetic Complaint of her Cruelty, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
very gravely, That her Couſin's Safety
was not ſo indifferent to her as he imagined:
And that ſhe did not hate him ſo much, but
that his Death would affect her very ſenſibly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> in ſpeaking theſe Words, bluſhed
with Shame, as thinking they were rather too
tender: And Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> who coloured like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
from a very different Motive, was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Mouth, to tell her, that he did not
think his Son was much obliged to her for not
hating him; when <hi>Arabella,</hi> ſuppoſing he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
to preſs her to a further Explanation of
the favourable Sentiments ſhe felt for Mr.
<hi>Glanville,</hi> ſtopped him with Precipitation: Preſs
me no more, ſaid ſhe, upon this Subject: And,
as I have already ſpoken too much, haply, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſo many Witneſſes, ſeek not to enhance
my Confuſion, by prolonging to Diſcourſe that
at preſent muſt needs be diſagreeable to me.</p>
               <p>I ſhall readily agree with you, Madam, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> that you have ſpoken too
much: And, if I had thought you capable of
ſpeaking in the manner you have done, I
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0005700701:261"/>
would have been more cautious in giving you
an Occaſion for it.</p>
               <p>I ſhould imagine, Sir, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with Anger, as ſhe before did with Shame,
that you would be the laſt Perſon in the World
who could think I had ſpoken too much upon
this Occaſion: And, ſince you are pleaſed to
tell me ſo, I think it fit to let you know, that I
have not, in my Opinion, tranſgreſſed the
Laws of Decency and Decorum, in what I
have ſaid in my Couſin's Favour: And I can
produce many Examples of greater Freedom of
Speech, in Princeſſes, and Ladies of the higheſt
Quality: However, I ſhall learn ſuch a Leſſon
of Moderation in this reſpect, from your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof,
that I promiſe you, neither yourſelf, or
Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> ſhall have any Cauſe, for the
future, to complain of my want of Diſcretion.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> who was very polite and good-natured,
was half angry with himſelf, for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
obliged his Niece to ſuch a Submiſſion, as
he thought it; and, apologizing for the Rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his Reprehenſion, aſſured her, that he
was perfectly convinced of her Diſcretion in all

would be always agreeable to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> who, from what her Uncle had
ſaid, began to entertain Suſpicions, that would
never have entered any Imagination but hers,
looked earneſtly upon him for half a Moment,
as if ſhe wiſhed to penetrate into the moſt
ſecret Receſſes of his Heart: But, fanſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing ſhe
ſaw ſomething in his Looks that confirmed her
Apprehenſions, ſhe removed her Eyes from his

for ſome Moments in Confuſion.—Sir
<hi>Charles,</hi> whom her apparent Diſturbance made
very uneaſy, propoſed returning to the Caſtle;
telling Lady <hi>Bella</hi> he expected to find his Son
already there.</p>
               <p>'Tis more than probable, ſaid ſhe, turning to
Sir <hi>George,</hi> that my Couſin is gone in Purſuit
of my Raviſher; and the Interruption that has
been given to his deſigned Vengeance, making
him more furious than before, 'tis not likely he
will return till he has puniſhed his Inſolence by
that Death he ſo juſtly merits.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> is already ſo happy in your
Opinion, ſaid Sir <hi>George,</hi> with a very profound
Sigh, that there is no need of his rendering you
this ſmall Service, to increaſe your Eſteem:
But, if my Prayers are heard, the Puniſhment
of your Raviſher will be reſerved for a Perſon
leſs fortunate, indeed, than Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> tho'
not leſs devoted to your Intereſt, and concerned
in your Preſervation.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>George</hi> counterfeiting a Look of extreme
Confuſion and Fear, as he ended theſe Words;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> who perfectly comprehended the
Meaning they were deſigned to convey, thought
herſelf obliged to take no Notice of them: And,
therefore, without making any Reply to the
young Baronet, who ventured ſlowly to lift his
Eyes to her Face, in order to diſcover if there
were any Signs of Anger in it, ſhe told Sir
<hi>Charles</hi> ſhe inclined to go home: And Sir
<hi>George,</hi> with the reſt of the Company, attended
them to the Caſtle; where, as ſoon as they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived,
they took their Leave.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:0005700701:263"/>
Sir <hi>George,</hi> notwithſtanding <hi>Arabella</hi>'s Care
to deprive him of an Opportunity of ſpeaking
to her, told her, in a Whiſper, having eagerly
alighted to help her off her Horſe,</p>
               <p>I am going, Madam, to find out that inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Man, who has dared to offer Violence to
the faireſt Perſon in the World: And, if I am
ſo happy as to meet with him, he ſhall either take
my Life, or I will put him into a Condition never
to commit any more Offences of that Nature.</p>
               <p>Saying this, he made a low Bow; and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deſirous to prevent her Anſwer, remounted
his Horſe, and went away with the reſt of the
Company.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> who, upon this Occaſion, was to
be all Confuſion, mixed with ſome little Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment,
diſcovered ſo much Emotion in her
Looks, while Sir <hi>George</hi> was whiſpering to her,
that her Uncle, as he was handing her into the
Houſe, aſked her, If ſhe was offended at any
thing Sir <hi>George</hi> had ſaid to her?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> conſtruing this Queſtion as ſhe had
done ſome other things her Uncle had ſaid to
her, replied, in a reſerved manner, Since my
Looks, contrary to my Intention, have betrayed
my Thoughts to you, I will not ſcruple to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
that I have ſome Cauſe to be offended
with Sir <hi>George;</hi> and that, in two Inſtances
To-day, he has ſeemed to forget the Reſpect
he owes me.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Charles</hi> was fired at this Account: Is it
poſſible, ſaid he, that Sir <hi>George</hi> has had the
Aſſurance to ſay any thing to offend you, and
that before my Face too? This Affront is not
to be borne.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:0005700701:264"/>
I am ſorry, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> eying him heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
to ſee you ſo much concerned at it.</p>
               <p>Don't be uneaſy, interrupted Sir <hi>Charles:</hi>
There will be no bad Conſequences happen from
it: But he ſhall hear of it, added he, raiſing
his Voice with Paſſion: I'll force him this Night
to explain himſelf.</p>
               <p>You muſt pardon me, Sir, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi>
more and more confirmed in her Notions, if I
tell you, that I am extremely offended at your
uncommon Zeal upon this Occaſion: And alſo
I muſt aſſure you, that a little more Calmneſs
would be leſs liable to Suſpicion.</p>

Lady, whoſe Thoughts were wholly employed
on the ſtrange Accidents which had happened to
her that Day, longed to be at Liberty to indulge
her Reflections; and, complaining of extreme

Inſinuations of Love from a Third, who, ſhe
thought, was enamoured of her Couſin; and,

               <p>As extravagant as this Notion was, <hi>Arabella</hi>
found Precedents in her Romances of Paſſions

                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> having ſettled this Point, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to reflect on the Conqueſt ſhe had made of
Sir <hi>George:</hi> She examined his Words over and
over, and found them ſo exactly conformable to
the Language of an <hi>Oroondates</hi> or <hi>Oronces,</hi> that
ſhe could not chooſe but be pleaſed: But, recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
that it behoved her, like all other He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roines,
to be extremely troubled and perplexed
at an Inſinuation of Love, ſhe began to lament
the cruel Neceſſity of parting with an agreeable
Friend; who, if he perſiſted in making her
acquainted with his Thoughts, would expofe
himſelf to the Treatment Perſons ſo indiſcreet
always meet with; nor was ſhe leſs concerned,
leſt, if Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi> had not already diſpatched
her Raviſher, Sir <hi>George,</hi> by wandering in
Search of him, and, haply, ſacrificing him to
his eager Deſire of ſerving her, ſhould, by that
means, lay her under an Obligation to him,
which, conſidering him as a Lover, would be a
great Mortification.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>George,</hi> however, was gone home to his
own Houſe, with no Thoughts of purſuing
<hi>Arabella</hi>'s Raviſher: And Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> being
queſtioned by his Father concerning his Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
invented ſome trifling Excuſe for it; which
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0005700701:267"/>
not agreeing with the Account the Baronet had
received from <hi>Arabella,</hi> he told his Son, that
he had concealed the Truth from him; and that
there was more in that Affair than he had
owned. You quarrelled, added he, upon <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi>'s
Account; and ſhe did not ſcruple to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
it before all the Company.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> who had vainly flattered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with an Hope, that his Couſin had not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
the Company with her whimſical Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions,
was extremely vexed when he
found ſhe had expoſed herſelf to their Ridicule,
and that it was probable even he had not eſcaped:
But, willing to know from her own Mouth how
far ſhe had carried her Folly, he went up to
her Chamber; and, being immediately admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
ſhe began to congratulate him upon the
Conqueſt he had gained, as ſhe ſuppoſed, over
his Enemy; and thanked him very ſolemnly for
the Security he had procured for her.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> after aſſuring her, that ſhe was
in no Danger of ever being carried away by that
Perſon whom ſhe feared, proceeded to inquire
into all that had paſſed between her and the
Company whom ſhe had joined, when ſhe left
him; and <hi>Arabella,</hi> relating every Particular,
gave him the Mortification to know, that her
Folly had been ſufficiently expoſed: But ſhe
touched upon her Fears for him with ſo much
Delicacy, and mentioned her Fainting in ſuch
a manner, as inſinuated a much greater Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
than he before had Reaſon to hope for;
and this Knowlege deſtroying all his Intentions
to quarrel with her for what ſhe had ſaid, he
appeared ſo eaſy and ſatisfied, that <hi>Arabella,</hi>
                  <pb n="254" facs="tcp:0005700701:268"/>
reflecting upon the Misfortune his Father's new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
Paſſion would probably be the Occaſion of
to him, could not help ſighing at the Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion;
looking on him, at the ſame time,
with a kind of pitying Complacency; which
did not eſcape Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi>'s Notice.</p>
               <p>I muſt know the Reaſon of that Sigh, Couſin,
ſaid he, ſmiling, and taking her Hand.</p>
               <p>If you are wiſe, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> gravely,
you will be contented to remain in the pleaſing
Ignorance you are at preſent; and not ſeek to
know a thing which will, haply, afford you but
little Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>You have increaſed my Curoſity ſo much
by this Advice, reſumed he, accommodating
his Looks to <hi>Arabella</hi>'s, that I ſhall not be at
Reſt till I know what it is you conceal from
me: And, ſince I am ſo much concerned in it,
even by your own Confeſſion, I have a Right
to preſs you to explain yourſelf.</p>
               <p>Since you are ſo importunate, replied <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi>
I mnſt tell you, that I will not do you
ſo great a Diſkindneſs, as to explain myſelf;
nor will I be the firſt who ſhall acquaint you
with your Misfortune, ſince you will, haply,
too ſoon arrive at the Knowlege of it, by other
means.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Glanville,</hi> who imagined this was ſome new
Whim that had got into her Head, was but
little perplexed at an Inſinuation, which, had
he been ignorant of her Foible, would have
given him great Uneaſineſs: But, being ſenſible
that ſhe expected he would preſs her to diſcloſe
herſelf, and appear extremely concerned at her
refuſing him that Satisfaction, he counterfeited
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0005700701:269"/>
ſo well, that ſhe was at a loſs how to evade the
Arguments he uſed to make her unfold the
terrible Myſtery; when the Dinner-bell ringing,
and relieving her ſor the preſent, Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi>
led her down to the Parlour; where Sir <hi>Charles</hi>
and his Daughter attended their coming.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THE Baronet, who had been put into a
bad Humour by <hi>Arabella</hi>'s Inſinuations,
that Sir <hi>George</hi> had affronted her, appeared re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
and uneaſy; and, being reſolved to
queſtion her about it, was willing firſt to know
exactly what it was his Niece had been offended
at: But as he feared, if it came to his Son's
Knowlege, it would produce a Quarrel between
the young Gentlemen, that might have dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Conſequences, he was deſirous of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to her alone; and, as ſoon as Dinner was
over, aſked her to take a Walk with him upon
the Terrace, telling her he had ſomething to
ſay to her in private. <hi>Arabella,</hi> whoſe Fears
had been conſiderably increaſed by the Penſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
which appeared in her Uncle's Looks du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Dinner, and ſuppoſing he wanted a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Converſation, only to explain himſelf more
clearly to her, than he had yet done, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively
alarmed at this Requeſt; and, caſting
her Eyes down to the Ground, bluſhed in ſuch
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0005700701:270"/>
a manner as betrayed her Confuſion; and made
Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> and her Brother believe, that ſhe
ſuſpected her Uncle had a Deſign to preſs her
ſoon to give her Hand to Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> which
occaſioned her apparent Diſorder.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> however, who had not ſo heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
obſerved her Behaviour, repeated his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt;
adding, with a Smile, upon her giving
him no Anſwer, Sure, Lady <hi>Bella,</hi> you are
not afraid to be alone with your Uncle.</p>
               <p>No, Sir, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> giving him a
piercing Look; I am not afraid of being alone
with my Uncle; and, as long as he pretends to
be no more than my Uncle, I ſhall not ſcruple to
hear what he has to ſay to me.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> a little vexed at an Anſwer which
inſinuated, as he thought, a Complaint of his
having pretended to more Authority over her
than he ought, told her, he hoped ſhe had no
Cauſe to believe he would diſpleaſe her, by any
improper Exertion of that Power over her, with
which her Father had intruſted him: For I aſſure
you, added he, I would rather you ſhould follow
my Advice as an Uncle, than obey me as a Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian;
and, ſince my Affection for you is, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
greater than what many People have for
a Niece, my Solicitude ought to be imputed to
that Motive.</p>
               <p>I have all the Senſe I ought to have of that
Affection you honour me with, replied <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella;</hi>
and ſince I hope it will be always what
it ſhould be, without wiſhing for its Increaſe, I
am contented with thoſe Teſtimonies I have
already received of it; and do not deſire any
other.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:0005700701:271"/>
Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> a little puzzled to underſtand the
Meaning of theſe Words, which the grave
Looks of <hi>Arabella</hi> made yet more myſterious,
roſe from his Seat with an Air of Diſcontent: I
ſhould have been glad to have ſpoken a Word in
private to you, Niece, ſaid ſhe; but, ſince you
think proper to make ſo much Ceremony in ſuch
a Trifle, I'll defer it till you are in a better Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Glanville,</hi> ſeeing her Father going out
of the Room, ſtepped before him: Nay, Papa,
ſaid ſhe, if you want to ſpeak with my Couſin,
my Brother and I will go out, and leave you to
yourſelves.</p>
               <p>You will do me a very great Diſpleaſure, ſaid
<hi>Arabella;</hi> for, I am ſure, my Uncle has not
any thing of Conſequence to ſay to me: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exer,
added ſhe, ſeeing Miſs <hi>Glanville</hi> go away,
I am reſolved, I will not be left alone; and
therefore, Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> ſince I can pretend to
ſome Power over you, I command you to ſtay.</p>
               <p>You may remember, Madam, ſaid Mr. <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
with a Smile, you refuſed to gratify my
Curioſity, with regard to ſomething you hinted
to me ſome time ago; and, to puniſh you, added
he, going out of the Room, I am reſolved you
ſhall liſten to what my Father has to ſay to you;
for, by your Unwillingneſs to hear it, I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
you ſuſpect already what it is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> finding ſhe had no way to avoid
hearing what ſhe dreaded ſo much, and obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her Uncle had reſumed his Chair, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to give him Audience; but, in order to
deprive him of all Hope, that ſhe would receive
his Diſcourſe favourably, ſhe aſſumed the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0005700701:272"/>
Look ſhe was capable of; and, caſting
her Eyes on the Ground, with a Mixture of
Anger and Shame, waited with a kind of Fear
and Impatience for what he had to ſay.</p>
               <p>I ſee, Madam, ſaid the Baronet, obſerving
her Confuſion, that you apprehend what I am
going to ſay to you; but, I beſeech you, do not
fear I have any Intentions, but ſuch as you'll
approve.</p>
               <p>You are certainly in the right, Sir, ſaid <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi>
in the Interpretation you have put on my
Looks: I am really in Pain about the Purport
of your Diſcourſe: And you would particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
oblige me, if you would diſpenſe with me
from hearing it.</p>
               <p>I ſee, replied Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> that, out of a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
Fear, you are unwilling to hear me, in
order to avoid coming to the Explanation I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire:
But I tell you, once again, you have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to apprehend.</p>
               <p>I have every thing to apprehend, Sir, reſumed
<hi>Arabella,</hi> tartly, while you perſiſt in your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of diſobliging me; and you cannot give me
a greater Proof of the Badneſs of your Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
than by thus forcing me to liſten to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
I ought to avoid.</p>
               <p>Since my Word has no Weight with you,
replied Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> I'll condeſcend to aſſure you,
by the moſt ſacred Oath, That I do not mean
to come to any Extremities with Sir <hi>George,</hi>
concerning what you already told me: All I
deſire to know is, If you think you had any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to be offended with him for any thing he
ſaid? And, in that Caſe, I cannot diſpenſe with
myſelf from expoſtulating with him about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="259" facs="tcp:0005700701:273"/>
You would do me a Favour, Sir, reſumed
<hi>Arabella,</hi> if you would intereſt yourſelf a little
leſs in what Sir <hi>George</hi> ſaid to me: The Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
was committed againſt me only; and none
but myſelf has any Right to reſent it.</p>
               <p>'Tis enough, Niece, ſaid Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> riſing:
You acknowlege ſufficient to make me reſolve
to oblige him to aſk Pardon for the Affront you
have received: However, I beg you may make
yourſelf eaſy; no ill Conſequences will happen
from this Affair, provided my Son does not
know it: And I know you have too much Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
to acquaint him with it.</p>
               <p>Saying this, he went out of the Room, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Arabella</hi> in great Conſuſion at what he had
ſaid; which, in her Opinion, had amounted
almoſt to a plain Declaration of his Paſſion; and
his Deſign of putting an End to Sir <hi>George</hi>'s
Pretenſions, whom, it was probable, he looked
upon as a more dangerous Rival than his Son,
confirmed her in the Opinion of his Reſolution
to perſecute her.</p>
               <p>Full of the Reflections this Accident had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned,
ſhe went to walk in the Garden,
where Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> his Siſter having juſt left
him, joined her.</p>
               <p>As he imagined, his Father's Deſign, in
ſpeaking to her alone, was to prevail upon her
to conſent to marry him before ſhe left the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
which was what he moſt earneſtly wiſhed,
he drew a bad Omen from the Diſcontent which
appeared in her Eyes.</p>
               <p>Is it with me, Couſin, ſaid he, or with what
my Father has been ſaying to you, that you are
angry?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:0005700701:274"/>
With both, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi> haſtily; for if
you had ſtaid in the Room, as I commanded you,
I ſhould not have been expoſed to the Pain of
hearing Things ſo diſagreeable.</p>
               <p>Since I knew what would be the Purport of
my Father's Diſcourſe, ſaid Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> you
ought not to be ſurpriſed I could not reſolve to
give any Interruption to it, by my Preſence:
And, being ſo much intereſted in the Succeſs
of his Solicitations, I could not chooſe but give
him an Opportunity of ſpeaking to you alone,
as he deſired.</p>
               <p>It ſeems then, reſumed <hi>Arabella,</hi> you know
what was the Subject of his Converſation.</p>
               <p>I believe I can gueſs, interrupted Mr. <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
ſmiling.</p>
               <p>Is it poſſible, cried <hi>Arabella,</hi> ſtarting back in
great Surprize, that, knowing, as you ſay you
do, your Father's Intentions, you would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
to furniſh him with an Opportunity of
diſcloſing them?</p>
               <p>Can you blame me, ſaid Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> for
ſuffering him to undertake what I durſt not my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?
I know your Delicacy, or rather your Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity,
ſo well, that I am ſenſible, if I had
taken the Liberty to ſay what my Father has
ſaid, you would have been extremely offended;
and puniſhed me, as you have often done, with
a Baniſhment from your Preſence: Nay, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
he, ſeeing Aſtoniſhment and Anger in her
Countenance, I perceive you are, at this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
going to pronounce ſome terrible Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
againſt me.</p>
               <p>You are deceived, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> with a
forced Calmneſs; I am ſo far from being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0005700701:275"/>
with you, that I am ready to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,
you merit very extraordinary Praiſes for
the perfect Reſignation you ſhew to the Will,
and, for your Credit, I will ſuppoſe, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
of your Father: But I would adviſe you
to be contented with the Reputation of being a
dutiful Son; and, for the future, never aſpire
to that of being a faithful Lover.</p>
               <p>Speaking theſe Words, which were wholly
unintelligible to her amazed Admirer, ſhe left
him, and went to her own Apartment, ſtrangely
ſurpriſed at the Indifference of Mr. <hi>Glanville;</hi>
who, as ſhe underſtood what he had ſaid, was
not only willing to reſign her to his Father,
but alſo took upon him to mediate in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.</p>
               <p>As ſhe was unwilling to acknowlege, even to
herſelf, that the Grief ſhe felt at this Diſcovery,
proceeded from any Affection for her Couſin,
ſhe imputed it to the Shame of ſeeing herſelf ſo
baſely forſaken and neglected; and, not being
able to find a Precedent for ſuch an Indignity
offered to the Charms of any Lady in her Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances,
the Singularity of her Fate, in this
reſpect, ſeemed to demand all her Uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>

               <p>WHILE <hi>Arabella</hi> paſſed her Time in
her Cloſet, in the moſt diſagreeable
Reflections, <hi>Glanville</hi> was racking his Brain to
find out the Meaning of thoſe myſterious Words
ſhe had uttered at leaving him: He examined
them twenty times over, but could not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
penetrate into their Senſe: But, ſuppoſing
at laſt, that they really meant nothing at all,
or were occaſioned by ſome new Flight of her
Imagination, he went to find out his Father,
in order to know what had paſſed between
him and <hi>Arabella.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> however, was not to be found; he
had ordered his Horſe to be made ready, under
Pretence of taking a little Ride after Dinner;
and, paſſing by Sir <hi>George</hi>'s Houſe, alighted to
pay him a Viſit.</p>
               <p>The young Baronet, being at home, received
him with great Politeneſs: And Sir <hi>Charles,</hi>
whoſe peculiar Diſpoſition was, to be nicely te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious
of every thing which, he imagined,
had any Relation to the Honour of his Family,
took the firſt Opportunity to queſtion him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Confuſion his Whiſper had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned

Sir <hi>George,</hi> who was by no means willing to
quarrel with the Uncle of <hi>Arabella,</hi> received the
old Gentleman's Remonſtrances with a great
deal of Calmneſs; and, finding <hi>Arabella</hi> had
not diſcovered the Purport of that Whiſper
which had offended her, he told Sir <hi>Charles,</hi>
That the Confuſion he ſaw in her Countenance,
was occaſioned by his raillying her upon the
Fright ſhe had been in upon Mr. <hi>Glanville</hi>'s
Account: He added ſome Particulars to this
Account, that intirely taking away all Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
in Sir <hi>Charles</hi> to purſue the Matter any
farther, they parted upon very good Terms;
Sir <hi>George</hi> promiſing, very ſoon, to return his

               <p>Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> upon his Father's Return, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
impatient to know what he had ſaid to <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi>
inquired with ſo much Precipitation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Converſation they had had together,
that Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> unwilling to tell him the Truth,
and not having time to conſider of an Anſwer,
evaded his Queſtion in ſuch a manner, that Mr.
<hi>Glanville</hi> could not help making ſome Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
upon it; and, comparing this Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
with what <hi>Arabella</hi> had ſaid, tho' he
could not comprehend the Meaning that ſeemed
to be concealed under their Behaviour, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
concluded, there was ſome Myſtery,
which it concerned him to find out.</p>
               <p>Poſſeſſed with this Opinion, he longed for
an Opportunity to talk with <hi>Arabella</hi> alone;
but he was not ſo happy to obtain one; for,
tho' that Fair-one preſided at the Tea-table, as
uſual, and alſo appeared at Supper, yet ſhe ſo
induſtriouſly avoided all Occaſions of being alone
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0005700701:278"/>
with him, tho' but for a Moment, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
ſo reſerved and uneaſy, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for him to ſpeak to her upon that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as it was time to retire, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to requeſt the Favour of a few Moments
Converſation with her, in her own Apartment;
and when he had, as was his Cuſtom, handed

Night, at her Chamber-door, he was going
to deſire Permiſſion to enter it with her; when
<hi>Lucy,</hi> coming to meet her Lady, whiſpered her
in the Ear; upon which, <hi>Arabella,</hi> turning

hurried into her Apartment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Glanville,</hi> no leſs vexed at this Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
than perplexed at that Whiſper, which
had cauſed ſuch a viſible Emotion in <hi>Arabella,</hi>
retired to his own Room, tormented with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
uneaſy Suſpicions, for which he could not
exactly aſſign a Cauſe; and wiſhing impatiently
for the next Day, in which he hoped to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
ſome Explanation of what at preſent greatly
perplexed him.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, <hi>Arabella,</hi> who had been
informed by <hi>Lucy,</hi> in that Whiſper, who was
eager to let her know it, that a Meſſenger had
brought a Letter from Sir <hi>George,</hi> and, late as
it was at Night, waited for an Anſwer, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating
with herſelf, whether ſhe ſhould open
this Billet or not: She had a ſtrong Inclination
to ſee what it contained; but, fearful of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing
the Laws of Romance, by indulging a
Curioſity not juſtifiable by Example, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to return this Letter unopened.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:0005700701:279"/>
Here, ſaid ſhe to <hi>Lucy,</hi> give this Letter to the
Meſſenger that brought it, and tell him, I was
exceſſively offended with you, for receiving it
from his Hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucy,</hi> taking the Letter, was going to obey
her Orders; when, recollecting herſelf, ſhe bid
her ſtay.</p>
               <p>Since Sir <hi>George,</hi> ſaid ſhe to herſelf, is no
declared Lover of mine, I may, without any
Offence to Decorum, ſee what this Letter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains:
To refuſe receiving it, will be to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,
that his Sentiments are not unknown to
me; and, by conſequence, to lay myſelf under a
Neceſſity of baniſhing him: Nor is it fit, that I
ſhould allow him to believe, I am ſo ready to
apprehend the Meaning of every gallant Speech,
which is uſed to me; and to conſtrue ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuations,
as he took the Liberty to make me,
into Declarations of Love.</p>
               <p>Allowing, therefore, the Juſtice of theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
ſhe took the Letter out of <hi>Lucy</hi>'s Hand;
and, being upon the Point of opening it, a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Thought controuled her Deſigns: She threw
it ſuddenly upon her Toilet; and, looking very
earneſtly upon it,</p>
               <p>Preſumptuous Paper! ſaid ſhe, ſpeaking with
great Emotion to the Letter: Bold Repoſitory
of thy Maſter's daring Thoughts! Shall I not
be blamed by all, who hereafter will hear, or
read, my Hiſtory, if, contrary to the Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
I have, that thou containeſt a Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
that will diſpleaſe me, I open thy Seal,
and become acceſſary to thy Writer's Guilt,
by deigning to make myſelf acquainted with it?
And thou, too indiſcreet and unwary Friend,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0005700701:280"/>
whoſe Folds contain the Acknowlegement of
his Crime! What will it advantage thee or
him, if, torn by my reſenting Hand, I make
thee ſuffer, for the Part thou beareſt in thy
Maſter's Fault; and teach him, by thy Fate,
how little Kindneſs he has to expect from me!
Yet, to ſpare myſelf the Trouble of reading
what will, queſtionleſs, greatly diſpleaſe me, I
will return thee, uninjured, into thy Maſter's
Hands; and, by that Moderation, make him
repent the Preſumption he has been guilty of!</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Containing a Love-Letter in the Heroic
Stile; with ſome occaſional Reaſonings
by Lucy, full of Wit and Simplicity.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>OUR fair Heroine, having ended the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
Soliloquy, took up the Letter, and
gave it to <hi>Lucy,</hi> who had, all the time ſhe was
ſpeaking, obſerved a profound Silence, mixed
with a moſt eager Attention.</p>
               <p>Here, purſued ſhe, carry it to the Perſon who
brought it; and bid him tell his Maſter, that,
leſt I ſhould find any thing in it, which may
offend me, I have choſen not to read it: And,
if he is wiſe, he will profit by my Concern for
him, and take care how he hazards diſpleaſing
me a Second time by an Importunity of this
kind, which I ſhall not ſo eaſily pardon him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucy,</hi> who had taken particular Notice of
this Speech, in order to remember every Word
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0005700701:281"/>
of it, when ſhe repeated it again, went conning
her Leſſon to the Place where ſhe had deſired
the Servant to wait her coming: But he was
gone; ſuch being indeed his Maſter's Orders;
for he was apprehenſive, that, following the
Cuſtom of the Ladies in Romances, <hi>Arabella</hi>
would return his Letter; and therefore, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
her of an Opportunity of ſending it back
that Night, he ordered his Man to ſay, he
waited for an Anſwer; but, as ſoon as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently
could, to come away without one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucy,</hi> in a great Surprize at the Servant's go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away, returned to her Lady with the Letter
in her Hand, telling her ſhe muſt needs read it
now, ſince the Perſon, who brought it, was
gone.</p>
               <p>It muſt be confeſſed, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> taking
the Letter from her, with a Smile, he has fallen
upon an ingenious Device, to make me keep it
for this Night; and, ſince, haply, I may be
miſtaken in the Contents, I have a mind to
open it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucy</hi> did not fail to confirm her Lady in this
Deſign: And <hi>Arabella,</hi> making as if ſhe yielded
to the Importunities of her Confidante, opened
the Letter; which ſhe found as follows:</p>

                     <p>SINCE it is, doubtleſs, not only with your

that your Uncle, Sir <hi>Charles Glanville,</hi> comes
to pronounce the Sentence of my Death, in the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0005700701:282"/>
Denunciation of your Anger, I ſubmit, Madam,
without repining at the Rigour of that Doom
you have inflicted on me. Yes, Madam, this
Criminal, who has dared to adore you, with
the moſt ſublime and perfect Paſſion that ever
was, acknowleges the Juſtice of his Puniſhment;
and, ſince it is impoſſible to ceaſe loving you,
or to live without telling you he does ſo, he is
going, voluntarily, to run upon that Death your
Severity makes him wiſh for, and the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his Crime demands. Let my Death
then, O Divine <hi>Arabella,</hi> expiate the Offence
I have been guilty of! And let me hope thoſe
fair Eyes, that have beheld me with Scorn
when alive, will not refuſe to ſhed ſome Tears
upon my Tomb! And that, when you remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

               <p>
                  <hi>Arabella,</hi> who had read this Letter aloud,
ſighed gently at the Concluſion of it; but poor
<hi>Lucy,</hi> who was greatly affected at ſo dolorous
an Epiſtle, could not reſtrain her Tears; but
ſobbed ſo often, and with ſo much Violence,
as, at length, recalled her Lady from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie,
into which ſhe was plunged.</p>
               <p>What ails you? ſaid ſhe to her Confidante,
greatly ſurpriſed: What is the Cauſe of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly
Sorrow?</p>
               <p>Oh! Madam! cried <hi>Lucy,</hi> her Sobs making
a frequent and unpleaſing Interruption in her
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0005700701:283"/>
Words; I ſhall break my Heart to be ſure: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was ſuch a ſad mournful Letter in the
World: I could cry my Eyes out for the poor
Gentleman. Pray excuſe me, Madam; but,
indeed, I can't help ſaying, You are the moſt
hard-heartedeſt Lady I ever knew in my born
Days: Why, to be ſure, you don't care, if
an hundred fine Gentlemen ſhould die for you,
tho' their Spirits were to haunt you every Night!
Well! I would not have what your Ladyſhip
has to anſwer for, for all the World!</p>
               <p>You are a fooliſh Wench! replied <hi>Arabella,</hi>
ſmiling at her Simplicity: Do you think I have
any Cauſe to accuſe myſelf, tho' Five thouſand
Men were to die for me? 'Tis very certain, my
Beauty has produced very deplorable Effects:
The unhappy <hi>Hervey</hi> has expiated, by his
Death, the Violence his too deſperate Paſſion
forced him to meditate againſt me: The no leſs
guilty, the noble Unknown, <hi>Edward,</hi> is wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about the World, in a tormenting Deſpair;
and ſtands expoſed to the Vengeance of my
Couſin, who has vowed his Death. My Charms
have made another Perſon, whoſe Character
ought to be ſacred to me, forget all the Ties
of Conſanguinity; and become the Rival of his
Son, whoſe Intereſt he once endeavoured to
ſupport: And, laſtly, the unfortunate <hi>Bell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour</hi>
conſumes away in an hopeleſs Paſſion;
and, conſcious of his Crime, dooms himſelf,
haply, with more Severity than I deſire, to a
voluntary Death; in hopes, thereby, of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
my Pardon and Compaſſion, when he is
no more. All theſe, <hi>Lucy,</hi> as I ſaid before,
are very deplorable Effects of my Beauty; but
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0005700701:284"/>
you muſt obſerve, that my Will has no Part
in the Miſeries, that unfortunate Beauty occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;
and that, tho' I could even wiſh myſelf
leſs fair, in order to avoid giving ſo much Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs
to others, yet theſe Wiſhes would
not avail; and ſince, by a fatal Neceſſity, all
theſe Things will happen, whether I would or
no, I muſt comfort myſelf under the Uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
which the Senſibility of my Temper
makes me feel, by the Reflection, that, with my
own Conſent, I contribute nothing to the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
of thoſe who love me.</p>
               <p>Will your Ladyſhip then let poor Sir <hi>George</hi>
die? ſaid <hi>Lucy,</hi> who had liſtened very atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
to this fine Harangue, without under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
what it meant.</p>
               <p>Queſtionleſs, he muſt die, replied <hi>Arabella,</hi>
if he perſiſts in his Deſign of loving me.</p>
               <p>But, pray, Madam, reſumed <hi>Lucy,</hi> cannot
your Ladyſhip command him to live, as you
did Mr. <hi>Hervey,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Glanville,</hi> who both
did as you bid them?</p>
               <p>I may command him to live, ſaid <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella;</hi>
and there is no Queſtion but he would
obey me, if I likewiſe permit him to love me;
but, this laſt not being fit for me to do, I ſee
no way to prevent the ſad Reſolution he has
taken.</p>
               <p>To be ſure, Madam, returned <hi>Lucy,</hi> your
Ladyſhip knows what you ought to do bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than I can adviſe your Ladyſhip, being that
you are more learned than me: But, for all
that I <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> it's better to ſave Life than to kill,
as the Bible-Book ſays; and, ſince I am ſure
your Ladyſhip is a good Chriſtian, if the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0005700701:285"/>
dies for the Want of a few kind Words,
or ſo, I am ſure you will be troubled in Mind
about it.</p>
               <p>It muſt be confeſſed, ſaid <hi>Arabella,</hi> ſmiling,
that, tho' your Solicitations are not very elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
they are very earneſt and affecting; and
I promiſe you, I will think about it; and, if I
can perſuade myſelf, I am doing no wrong
Thing, by concerning myſelf about his Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
I will diſpatch you To-morrow Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
with my Orders to him, to live, or, at
leaſt, to proceed no further in his Deſign of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
till he has further Cauſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucy,</hi> being extremely glad ſhe had gained
her Point, called in her Lady's other Women,
who, having aſſiſted her to undreſs, left her in
her Cloſet, to which ſhe always retired for an
Hour, before ſhe went to Bed.</p>
