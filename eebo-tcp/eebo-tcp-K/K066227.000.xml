            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <head>EXPOSITION OF THE ARGUMENT.</head>
               <p>THE volume of Chriſtian ſcriptures
contains thirteen letters purporting
to be written by St. Paul; it contains alſo
a book, which amongſt other things, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes
to deliver the hiſtory, or rather me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs
of the hiſtory, of this ſame perſon.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0539601100:4"/>
By aſſuming the genuineneſs of the letters,
we may prove the ſubſtantial truth of the
hiſtory; or, by aſſuming the truth of the
hiſtory, we may argue ſtrongly in ſupport
of the genuineneſs of the letters. But I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
neither one nor the other. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
is at liberty to ſuppoſe theſe writings to
have been lately diſcovered in the library
of the Eſcurial, and to come to our hands
deſtitute of any extrinſic or collateral evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
whatever; and the argument I am
about to offer is calculated to ſhew, that a
compariſon of the different writings would,
even under theſe circumſtances, afford good
reaſon to believe the perſons and tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to have been real, the letters authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic,
and the narration in the main to be
true.</p>
               <p>Agreement or conformity between let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
bearing the name of an ancient author,
and a received hiſtory of that author's life,
does not neceſſarily eſtabliſh the credit of
either: becauſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The hiſtory may, like Middleton's
Life of Cicero, or Jortin's Life of Eraſmus,
have been wholly, or in part, compiled
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0539601100:5"/>
from the letters; in which caſe it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
that the hiſtory adds nothing to the
evidence already afforded by the letters:
or,</p>
               <p n="2">2. The letters may have been fabricated
out of the hiſtory: a ſpecies of impoſture
which is certainly practicable; and which,
without any acceſſion of proof or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
would neceſſarily produce the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of conſiſtency and agreement: or,</p>
               <p n="3">3. The hiſtory and letters may have
been founded upon ſome authority com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to both; as upon reports and tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which prevailed in the age in which
they were compoſed, or upon ſome ancient
record now loſt, which both writers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted:
in which caſe alſo, the letters, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being genuine, may exhibit marks of
conformity with the hiſtory; and the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
without being true, may agree with
the letters.</p>
               <p>Agreement therefore, or conformity, is
only to be relied upon ſo far as we can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
theſe ſeveral ſuppoſitions. Now the
point to be noticed is, that, in the three
caſes above enumerated, conformity muſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0539601100:6"/>
be the effect of <hi>deſign.</hi> Where the hiſtory
is compiled from the letters, which is the
firſt caſe, the deſign and compoſition of
the work are in general ſo confeſſed, or
made ſo evident by compariſon, as to leave
us in no danger of confounding the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
with original hiſtory, or of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
it for an independent authority.
The agreement, it is probable, will be cloſe
and uniform, and will eaſily be perceived
to reſult from the intention of the author,
and from the plan and conduct of his work.—Where
the letters are fabricated from the
hiſtory, which is the ſecond caſe, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
for the purpoſe of impoſing a forgery
upon the public; and, in order to give co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
and probability to the fraud, names,
places, and circumſtances, found in the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
may be ſtudiouſly introduced into the
letters, as well as a general conſiſtency be
endeavoured to be maintained. But here
it is manifeſt, that whatever congruity ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
is the conſequence of meditation,
artifice, and deſign.—The third caſe is
that wherein the hiſtory and the letters,
without any direct privity or communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0539601100:7"/>
with each other, derive their materials
from the ſame ſource; and, by reaſon of
their common original, furniſh inſtances of
accordance and correſpondency. This is a
ſituation in which we muſt allow it to be
poſſible for ancient writings to be placed;
and it is a ſituation in which it is more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
to diſtinguiſh ſpurious from genuine
writings, than in either of the caſes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
in the preceding ſuppoſitions; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch
as the congruities obſervable are ſo
far accidental, as that they are not produced
by the immediate tranſplanting of names and
circumſtances out of one writing into the
other. But although, with reſpect to each
other, the agreement in theſe writings be
mediate and ſecondary, yet is it not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
or abſolutely undeſigned; becauſe,
with reſpect to the common original from
which the information of the writers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds,
it is ſtudied and factitious. The
caſe of which we treat muſt, as to the
letters, be a caſe of forgery; and when the
writer, who is perſonating another, ſits
down to his compoſition—whether he have
the hiſtory with which we now compare
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0539601100:8"/>
the letters, or ſome other record, before
him; or whether he have only looſe tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
and reports to go by—he muſt adapt
his impoſture, as well as he can, to what he
finds in theſe accounts; and his adaptations
will be the reſult of council, ſcheme, and
induſtry: art muſt be employed; and veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiges
will appear of management and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.
Add to this, that, in moſt of the
following examples, the circumſtances in
which the coincidence is remarked are of
too particular and domeſtic a nature, to
have floated down upon the ſtream of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
tradition.</p>
               <p>Of the three caſes which we have ſtated,
the difference between the firſt and the two
others is, that in the firſt the deſign may be
fair and honeſt, in the others it muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with the conſciouſneſs of fraud:
but in all there is deſign. In examining,
therefore, the agreement between ancient
writings, the character of truth and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality
is undeſignedneſs: and this teſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
to every ſuppoſition; for, whether we
ſuppoſe the hiſtory to be true, but the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
ſpurious; or the letters to be genuine,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0539601100:9"/>
but the hiſtory falſe; or, laſtly, falſehood
to belong to both—the hiſtory to be a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and the letters fictitious; the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
will reſult—that either there will be
no agreement between them, or the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
will be the effect of deſign. Nor will
it elude the principle of this rule, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the ſame perſon to have been the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of all the letters, or even the author
both of the letters and the hiſtory; for no
leſs deſign is neceſſary to produce coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
between different parts of a man's
own writings, eſpecially when they are
made to take the different forms of a hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
and of original letters, than to adjuſt
them to the circumſtances found in any
other writing.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to thoſe writings of the New
Teſtament which are to be the ſubject of
our preſent conſideration, I think that, as
to the authenticity of the epiſtles, this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
where it is ſufficiently ſuſtained by
inſtances, is nearly concluſive; for I cannot
aſſign a ſuppoſition of forgery, in which
coincidences of the kind we enquire after
are likely to appear. As to the hiſtory,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0539601100:10"/>
it extends to theſe points:—It proves the
general reality of the circumſtances; it
proves the hiſtorian's knowledge of theſe
circumſtances. In the preſent inſtance it
confirms his pretenſions of having been a
cotemporary, and in the latter part of his
hiſtory a companion of St. Paul. In a
word, it eſtabliſhes the ſubſtantial truth
of the narration: and <hi>ſubſtantial</hi> truth is
that which, in every hiſtorical enquiry,
ought to be the firſt thing ſought after
and aſcertained; it muſt be the ground
work of every other obſervation.</p>
               <p>The reader then will pleaſe to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
this word <hi>undeſignedneſs,</hi> as denoting
that upon which the conſtruction and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity
of our argument chiefly depend.</p>
               <p>As to the proofs of undeſignedneſs, I
ſhall in this place ſay little; for I had
rather the reader's perſuaſion ſhould ariſe
from the inſtances themſelves, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
remarks with which they may be
accompanied, than from any previous for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulary
or deſcription of argument. In a
great plurality of examples, I truſt he will
be perfectly convinced that no deſign or
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0539601100:11"/>
contrivance whatever has been exerciſed:
and if ſome of the coincidences alledged
appear to be minute, circuitous, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,
let him reflect that this very indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectneſs
and ſubtility is that which gives
force and propriety to the example. Broad,
obvious, and explicit agreements prove
little; becauſe it may be ſuggeſted that the
inſertion of ſuch is the ordinary expedient
of every forgery: and though they may
occur, and probably will occur, in genuine
writings, yet it cannot be proved that they
are peculiar to theſe. Thus what St.
Paul declares in chap. xi. of 1 Cor. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the inſtitution of the euchariſt—"For
I have received of the Lord that
which I alſo delivered unto you, that
the Lord Jeſus, the ſame night in which
he was betrayed, took bread; and when
he had given thanks, he brake it, and
ſaid, Take, eat; this is my body, which
is broken for you; this do in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of me"—though it be in cloſe
and verbal conformity with the account of
the ſame tranſaction preſerved by St. Luke,
is yet a conformity of which no uſe can be
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0539601100:12"/>
made in our argument; for if it ſhould be
objected that this was a mere recital from
the goſpel, borrowed by the author of the
epiſtle, for the purpoſe of ſetting off his
compoſition by an appearance of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with the received account of the
Lord's ſupper, I ſhould not know how to
repel the inſinuation. In like manner, the
deſcription which St. Paul gives of himſelf,
in his epiſtle to the Philippians (iii. 5)—"Circumciſed
the eighth day, of the ſtock
of Iſrael, of the tribe of Benjamin, an
Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching
the law, a Phariſee; concerning zeal,
perſecuting the church; touching the
righteouſneſs which is in the law, blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs"—is
made up of particulars ſo plainly
delivered concerning him, in the Acts of
the Apoſtles, the Epiſtle to the Romans,
and the Epiſtle to the Galatians, that I
cannot deny but that it would be eaſy for
an impoſtor, who was fabricating a letter
in the name of St. Paul, to collect theſe
articles into one view. This, therefore, is
a conformity which we do not adduce.
But when I read, in the Acts of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0539601100:13"/>
that "when Paul came to Derbe and
Lyſtra, behold a certain diſciple was
there, named Timotheus, the ſon of a
certain woman <hi>which was a Jeweſs</hi>;"
and when, in an epiſtle addreſſed to Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,
I find him reminded of his "having
known the holy ſcriptures <hi>from a child,</hi>"
which implies that he muſt, on one ſide or
both, have been brought up by Jewiſh pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents;
I conceive that I remark a coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
which ſhews, by its very <hi>obliquity,</hi>
that ſcheme was not employed in its forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
In like manner, if a coincidence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon a compariſon of dates, or rather
of circumſtances from which the dates are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered—the
more intricate that compariſon
ſhall be; the more numerous the interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
ſteps through which the concluſion is
deduced; in a word, the more <hi>circuitous</hi>
the inveſtigation is, the better, becauſe the
agreement which finally reſults is thereby
farther removed from the ſuſpicion of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance,
affectation, or deſign. And it
ſhould be remembered, concerning theſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incidences,
that it is one thing to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute,
and another to be precarious; one
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0539601100:14"/>
thing to be unobſerved, and another to be
obſcure; one thing to be circuitous or
oblique, and another to be forced, dubious,
or fanciful. And this diſtinction ought
always to be retained in our thoughts.</p>
               <p>The very particularity of St. Paul's epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles;
the perpetual recurrence of names of
perſons and places; the frequent alluſions to
the incidents of his private life, and the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of his condition and hiſtory; and
the connection and paralleliſm of thoſe with
the ſame circumſtances in the Acts of the
Apoſtles, ſo as to enable us, for the moſt
part, to confront them with one another;
as well as the relation which ſubſiſts between
the circumſtances, as mentioned or referred
to in the different epiſtles—afford no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
proof of the genuineneſs of the
writings, and the reality of the tranſactions.
For as no advertency is ſufficient to guard
againſt ſlips and contradictions, when cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
are multiplied, and when they
are liable to be detected by cotemporary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
equally circumſtantial, an impoſtor,
I ſhould expect, would either have avoided
particulars entirely, contenting himſelf with
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0539601100:15"/>
doctrinal diſcuſſions, moral precepts, and
general reflections<note n="*" place="bottom">This, however, muſt not be miſunderſtood. A perſon writing to his friends, and upon a ſubject in which the tranſactions of his own life were concerned, would probably be led in the courſe of his letter, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if it was a long one, to refer to paſſages found in his hiſtory. A perſon addreſſing an epiſtle to the public at large, or under the form of an epiſtle delivering a diſcourſe upon ſome ſpeculative argument, would not, it is probable, meet with an occaſion of alluding to the circumſtances of his life at all: he might, or he might not; the chance on either ſide is nearly equal. This is the ſituation of the catholic epiſtle. Although, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the preſence of theſe alluſions and agreements be a valuable acceſſion to the arguments by which the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticity of a letter is maintained, yet the want of them certainly forms no poſitive objection.</note>; or if, for the ſake of
imitating St. Paul's ſtyle, he ſhould have
thought it neceſſary to interſperſe his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
with names and circumſtances, he
would have placed them out of the reach of
compariſon with the hiſtory. And I am
confirmed in this opinion by an inſpection
of two attempts to counterfeit St. Paul's
epiſtles, which have come down to us; and
the only attempts, of which we have any
knowledge, that are at all deſerving of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0539601100:16"/>
One of theſe is an epiſtle to the
Laodiceans, extant in Latin, and preſerved
by Fabricius in his collection of apocryphal
ſcriptures. The other purports to be an
epiſtle of St. Paul to the Corinthians, in
anſwer to an epiſtle from the Corinthians
to him. This was tranſlated by Scroderus
from a copy in the Armenian language
which had been ſent to W. Whiſton, and
was afterwards, from a more perfect copy
procured at Aleppo, publiſhed by his ſons,
as an appendix to their edition of Moſes
Chorenenſis. No Greek copy exiſts of
either: they are not only not ſupported by
ancient teſtimony, but they are negatived
and excluded; as they have never found
admiſſion into any catalogue of apoſtolical
writings, acknowledged by, or known to,
the early ages of Chriſtianity. In the firſt
of theſe I found, as I expected, a total
<hi>evitation</hi> of circumſtances. It is ſimply a
collection of ſentences from the canonical
epiſtles, ſtrung together with very little
ſkill. The ſecond, which is a more verſute
and ſpecious forgery, is introduced with a
liſt of names of perſons who wrote to St.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0539601100:17"/>
Paul from Corinth; and is preceded by an
account ſufficiently particular of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in which the epiſtle was ſent from Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth
to St. Paul, and the anſwer returned.
But they are names which no one ever
heard of; and the account it is impoſſible
to combine with any thing found in the
Acts, or in the other epiſtles. It is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for me to point out the internal
marks of ſpuriouſneſs and impoſture which
theſe compoſitions betray; but it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to obſerve, that they do not afford
thoſe coincidences which we propoſe as
proofs of authenticity in the epiſtles which
we defend.</p>
               <p>Having explained the general ſcheme and
formation of the argument, I may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to ſubjoin a brief account of the
manner of conducting it.</p>
               <p>I have diſpoſed the ſeveral inſtances of
agreement under ſeparate numbers; as well
to mark more ſenſibly the diviſions of the
ſubject, as for another purpoſe, viz. that the
reader may thereby be reminded that the
inſtances are independent of one another.
I have advanced nothing which I did not
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0539601100:18"/>
think probable; but the degree of probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
by which different inſtances are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
is undoubtedly very different. If
the reader, therefore, meets with a number
which contains an inſtance that appears to
him unſatisfactory, or founded in miſtake,
he will diſmiſs that number from the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but without prejudice to any other.
He will have occaſion alſo to obſerve, that
the coincidences diſcoverable in ſome epiſtles
are much fewer and weaker than what
are ſupplied by others. But he will add to his
obſervation this important circumſtance—that
whatever aſcertains the original of one
epiſtle, in ſome meaſure eſtabliſhes the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the reſt. For, whether theſe epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
be genuine or ſpurious, every thing
about them indicates that they come from
the ſame hand. The diction, which it is
extremely difficult to imitate, preſerves its
reſemblance and peculiarity throughout all
the epiſtles. Numerous expreſſions and
ſingularities of ſtyle, found in no other part
of the New Teſtament, are repeated in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
epiſtles; and occur, in their reſpective
places, without the ſmalleſt appearance of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0539601100:19"/>
force or art. An involved argumentation,
frequent obſcurities, eſpecially in the order
and tranſition of thought, piety, vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence,
affection, burſts of rapture, and of
unparalleled ſublimity, are properties, all
or moſt of them, diſcernible in every letter
of the collection. But although theſe epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
bear ſtrong marks of proceeding from
the ſame hand, I think it is ſtill more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that they were originally ſeparate pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lications.
They form no continued ſtory;
they compoſe no regular correſpondence;
they compriſe not the tranſactions of any
particular period; they carry on no connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of argument; they depend not upon
one another; except in one or two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
they refer not to one another. I
will farther undertake to ſay, that no ſtudy
or care has been employed to produce or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
an appearance of conſiſtency amongſt
them. All which obſervations ſhew that
they were not intended by the perſon, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he was, that wrote them, to come
forth or be read together; that they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
at firſt ſeparately, and have been
collected ſince.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0539601100:20"/>
The proper purpoſe of the following
work is, to bring together, from the Acts
of the Apoſtles, and from the different epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,
ſuch paſſages as furniſh examples of
undeſigned coincidence; but I have ſo far
enlarged upon this plan, as to take into it
ſome circumſtances found in the epiſtles,
which contributed ſtrength to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
though not ſtrictly objects of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon.</p>
               <p>It appeared alſo a part of the ſame plan,
to examine the difficulties which preſented
themſelves in the courſe of our enquiry.</p>
               <p>I do not know that the ſubject has been
propoſed or conſidered in this view before.
Ludovicus Capellus, Biſhop Pearſon, Dr.
Benſon, and Dr. Lardner, have each given
a continued hiſtory of St. Paul's life, made
up from the Acts of the Apoſtles and the
epiſtles joined together. But this, it is
manifeſt, is a different undertaking from
the preſent, and directed to a different
purpoſe.</p>
               <p>If what is here offered ſhall add one
thread to that complication of probabilities
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0539601100:21"/>
by which the Chriſtian hiſtory is atteſted,
the reader's attention will be repaid by the
ſupreme importance of the ſubject; and my
deſign will be fully anſwered.</p>

                  <p>THE firſt paſſage I ſhall produce from
this epiſtle, and upon which a good
deal of obſervation will be founded, is the
following:</p>
                  <p>"But now I go unto Jeruſalem, to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
unto the ſaints; for it hath pleaſed
them of Macedonia and Achaia to make
a certain contribution for the poor ſaints
which are at Jeruſalem." Rom. xv. 25,
26.</p>
                  <p>In this quotation three diſtinct circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
are ſtated—a contribution in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia
for the relief of the Chriſtians of
Jeruſalem, a contribution in Achaia for the
ſame purpoſe, and an intended journey of
St. Paul to Jeruſalem. Theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
are ſtated as taking place at the ſame
time, and that to be the time when the
epiſtle was written. Now let us enquire
whether we can find theſe circumſtances
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0539601100:23"/>
elſewhere; and whether, if we do find
them, they meet together in reſpect of date.
Turn to the Acts of the Apoſtles, chap. xx.
ver. 2, 3, and you read the following ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count:
"When he had gone over thoſe
parts (viz. Macedonia), and had given
them much exhortation, he came into
Greece, and there abode three months;
and when the Jews laid wait for him, <hi>as
he was about to ſail into Syria,</hi> he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to return through Macedonia."
From this paſſage, compared with the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of St. Paul's travels given before,
and from the ſequel of the chapter, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
that upon St. Paul's <hi>ſecond</hi> viſit to the
peninſula of Greece, his intention was, when
he ſhould leave the country, to proceed
from Achaia directly by ſea to Syria; but
that, to avoid the Jews, who were lying in
wait to intercept him in his route, he ſo far
changed his purpoſe as to go back through
Macedonia, embark at Philippi, and purſue
his voyage from thence towards Jeruſalem.
Here therefore is a journey to Jeruſalem;
but not a ſyllable of any contribution. And
as St. Paul had taken ſeveral journeys to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0539601100:24"/>
Jeruſalem before, and one alſo immediately
after his <hi>firſt</hi> viſit into the peninſula of
Greece (Acts xviii. 21.), it cannot from
hence be collected in which of theſe viſits
the epiſtle was written, or, with certainty,
that it was written in either. The ſilence
of the hiſtorian, who profeſſes to have been
with St. Paul at the time (v. 6.), concerning
any contribution, might lead us to look out
for ſome different journey, or might induce
us perhaps to queſtion the conſiſtency of
the two records, did not a very accidental
reference, in another part of the ſame hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
afford us ſufficient ground to believe
that this ſilence was omiſſion. When St.
Paul made his reply before Felix, to the
accuſations of Tertullus, he alledged, as
was natural, that neither the errand which
brought him to Jeruſalem, nor his conduct
whilſt he remained there, merited the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies
with which the Jews had aſperſed
him. "Now after many years (i. e. of
abſence) <hi>I came to bring alms to my nation
and offerings</hi>; whereupon certain Jews from
Aſia found me purified in the temple, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with multitude nor with tumult, who
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0539601100:25"/>
ought to have been here before thee, and
object, if they had ought againſt me."
Acts xxiv. 17-19. This mention of alms
and offerings certainly brings the narrative
in the Acts nearer to an accordancy with
the epiſtle; yet no one, I am perſuaded,
will ſuſpect that this clauſe was put into St.
Paul's defence, either to ſupply the omiſſion
in the preceding narrative, or with any view
to ſuch accordancy.</p>
                  <p>After all, nothing is yet ſaid or hinted
concerning the <hi>place</hi> of the contribution;
nothing concerning Macedonia and Achaia.
Turn therefore to the Firſt Epiſtle to the
Corinthians, chap. xvi. ver. 1-4, and you
have St. Paul delivering the following di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections:
"Concerning the collection for
the ſaints, as I have given orders to the
churches of Galatia, even ſo do ye: upon
the firſt day of the week let every one
of you lay by him in ſtore as God hath
proſpered him, that there be no gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
when I come. And when I come,
whomſoever you ſhall approve by your
letters, them will I ſend to bring your
liberality unto Jeruſalem; and if it be
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0539601100:26"/>
meet that I go alſo, they ſhall go with
me." In this paſſage we find a contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution
carrying on at Corinth, the capital of
Achaia, for the Chriſtians of Jeruſalem; we
find alſo a hint given of the poſſibility of
St. Paul's going up to Jeruſalem himſelf,
after he had paid his viſit into Achaia:
but this is ſpoken of rather as a poſſibility
than as any ſettled intention; for his firſt
thought was, "Whomſoever you ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
by your letters, them will I <hi>ſend</hi> to
bring your liberality to Jeruſalem:" and,
in the ſixth verſe, he adds, "That ye may
bring me on my journey <hi>whitherſoever</hi> I
go." This epiſtle purports to be written
after St. Paul had been at Corinth; for it
refers throughout to what he had done and
ſaid amongſt them whilſt he was there. The
expreſſion therefore, "When I come,"
muſt relate to a <hi>ſecond</hi> viſit; againſt which
viſit the contribution ſpoken of was deſired
to be in readineſs.</p>
                  <p>But though the contribution in Achaia
be expreſsly mentioned, nothing is here
ſaid concerning any contribution in Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia.
Turn therefore, in the third place,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0539601100:27"/>
to the Second Epiſtle to the Corinthians,
chap. viii. ver. 1-4, and you will diſcover
the particular which remains to be ſought
for: "Moreover, brethren, we do you to
wit of the grace of God beſtowed on the
<hi>churches of Macedonia</hi>; how that, in a great
trial of affliction, the abundance of their
joy and their deep poverty abounded unto
the riches of their liberality; for to their
power I bear record, yea, and beyond
their power, they were willing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
praying us, with much entreaty,
that we would receive the gift, and take
upon us the fellowſhip of the miniſtering
to the ſaints." To which add chap. ix.
ver. 2: "I know the forwardneſs of your
mind, for which I boaſt of you to them
of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a
year ago." In this epiſtle we find St.
Paul advanced as far as Macedonia, upon
that <hi>ſecond</hi> viſit to Corinth which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
in his former epiſtle; we find alſo,
in the paſſages now quoted from it, that a
contribution was going on in Macedonia at
the ſame time with, or ſoon however fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
the contribution which was made
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0539601100:28"/>
in Achaia; but for whom the contribution
was made does not appear in this epiſtle at
all: that information muſt be ſupplied from
the firſt epiſtle.</p>
                  <p>Here therefore, at length, but fetched
from three different writings, we have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the ſeveral circumſtances we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
after, and which the Epiſtle to the
Romans brings together, viz. a contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in Achaia for the Chriſtians of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem;
a contribution in Macedonia for
the ſame; and an approaching journey of
St. Paul to Jeruſalem. We have theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances—each
by ſome hint in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
in which it is mentioned, or by the
date of the writing in which the paſſage
occurs—fixed to a particular time; and we
have that time turning out, upon examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to be in all the <hi>ſame</hi>; namely, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the cloſe of St. Paul's ſecond viſit
to the peninſula of Greece. This is an
inſtance of conformity beyond the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility,
I will venture to ſay, of ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
writing to produce. I alſo aſſert,
that it is in the higheſt degree improbable
that it ſhould have been the effect of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0539601100:29"/>
and deſign. The imputation of
<hi>deſign</hi> amounts to this, that the forger of
the Epiſtle to the Romans inſerted in it
the paſſage upon which our obſervations
are founded, for the purpoſe of giving co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
to his forgery by the appearance of
conformity with other writings which were
then extant. I reply, in the firſt place, that,
if he did this to countenance his forgery,
he did it for the purpoſe of an argument
which would not ſtrike one reader in ten
thouſand. Coincidences ſo circuitous as
this anſwer not the ends of forgery; are
ſeldom, I believe, attempted by it. In the
ſecond place I obſerve, that he muſt have
had the Acts of the Apoſtles, and the two
Epiſtles to the Corinthians, before him at
the time. In the Acts of the Apoſtles (I
mean that part of the Acts which relates to
this period) he would have found the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to Jeruſalem; but nothing about the
contribution. In the Firſt Epiſtle to the
Corinthians he would have found a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution
going on in Achaia for the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
of Jeruſalem, and a diſtant hint of the
poſſibility of the journey; but nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0539601100:30"/>
a contribution in Macedonia. In
the Second Epiſtle to the Corinthians he
would have found a contribution in Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia
accompanying that in Achaia; but
no intimation for whom either was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and not a word about the journey. It
was only by a cloſe and attentive collation
of the three writings, that he could have
picked out the circumſtances which he has
united in his epiſtle; and by a ſtill more
nice examination, that he could have deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
them to belong to the ſame period.
In the third place I remark, what dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes
very much the ſuſpicion of fraud,
how aptly and connectedly the mention
of the circumſtances in queſtion, viz. the
journey to Jeruſalem, and of the occaſion
of that journey, ariſes from the context.
"Whenſoever I take my journey into Spain,
I will come to you; for I truſt to ſee you
in my journey, and to be brought on my
way thitherward by you, if firſt I be
ſomewhat filled with your company.
<hi>But now I go unto Jeruſalem, to miniſter
unto the ſaints; for it hath pleaſed them of
Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain</hi> 
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0539601100:31"/>
                     <hi>contribution for the poor ſaints which are at
Jeruſalem.</hi> It hath pleaſed them verily,
and their debtors they are; for if the
Gentiles have been made partakers of
their ſpiritual things, their duty is alſo
to miniſter unto them in carnal things.
When therefore I have performed this,
and have ſealed to them this fruit, I will
come by you into Spain." Is the paſſage
in <hi>Italics</hi> like a paſſage foiſted in for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traneous
purpoſe? Does it not ariſe from
what goes before, by a junction as eaſy as
any example of writing upon real buſineſs
can furniſh? Could any thing be more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
than that St. Paul, in writing to the
Romans, ſhould ſpeak of the time when he
hoped to viſit them; ſhould mention the
buſineſs which then detained him; and
that he purpoſed to ſet forwards upon
his journey to them, when that buſineſs
was completed?</p>

                  <head>No. II.</head>
                  <p>By means of the quotation which form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the ſubject of the preceding number, we
collect, that the Epiſtle to the Romans was
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0539601100:32"/>
written at the concluſion of St. Paul's ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
viſit to the peninſula of Greece: but
this we collect, not from the epiſtle itſelf,
not from any thing <hi>declared</hi> concerning the
time and place in any part of the epiſtle,
but from a compariſon of circumſtances
referred to in the epiſtle, with the order of
events recorded in the Acts, and with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
to the ſame circumſtances, though
for quite different purpoſes, in the two
Epiſtles to the Corinthians. Now would
the author of a forgery, who ſought to gain
credit to a ſpurious letter by congruities,
depending upon the time and place in
which the letter was ſuppoſed to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
have left that time and place to be
made out, in a manner ſo obſcure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct
as this is? If therefore coincidences
of circumſtances can be pointed out in
this epiſtle, depending upon its date, or
the place where it was written, whilſt that
date and place are only aſcertained by other
circumſtances, ſuch coincidences may fairly
be ſtated as <hi>undeſigned.</hi> Under this head I
adduce</p>
                  <p>Chap. xvi. 21-23. "Timotheus, my
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0539601100:33"/>
workfellow, and Lucius, and Jaſon, and
Soſipater, my kinſmen, ſalute you. I Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,
who wrote this epiſtle, ſalute you in
the Lord. Gaius mine hoſt, and of the
whole church, ſaluteth you; and Quartus,
a brother." With this paſſage I compare
Acts xx. 4. "And there accompanied
him into Aſia, Sopater of Berea; and, of
the Theſſalonians, Ariſtarchus and Secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus;
and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus;
and, of Aſia, Tychicus, and Trophimus."
The Epiſtle to the Romans, we have ſeen, was
written juſt before St. Paul's departure from
Greece, after his ſecond viſit to that penin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſula:
the perſons mentioned in the quotation
from the Acts are thoſe who accompanied
him in that very departure. Of ſeven whoſe
names are joined in the ſalutation of the
church of Rome, three, viz. Soſipater,
Gaius, and Timothy, are proved, by this
paſſage in the Acts, to have been with St.
Paul at the time. And this is perhaps as
much coincidence as could be expected from
reality, though leſs, I am apt to think, than
would have been produced by deſign. Four
are mentioned in the Acts who are not joined
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0539601100:34"/>
in the ſalutation; and it is in the nature of
the caſe probable that there ſhould be many
attending St. Paul in Greece who knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the converts at Rome, nor were
known by them. In like manner ſeveral are
joined in the ſalutation who are not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the paſſage referred to in the Acts.
This alſo was to be expected. The occaſion
of mentioning them in the Acts was their
proceeding with St. Paul upon his journey.
But we may be ſure that there were many
eminent Chriſtians with St. Paul in Greece,
beſides thoſe who accompanied him into
Aſia<note n="*" place="bottom">Of theſe Jaſon is one, whoſe preſence upon this occaſion is very naturally accounted for. Jaſon was an inhabitant of Theſſalonica in Macedonia, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained St. Paul in his houſe upon his firſt viſit to that country. Acts xvii. 7.—St. Paul, upon this his ſecond viſit, paſſed through Macedonia on his way to Greece, and, from the ſituation of Theſſalonica, moſt likely thro' that city. It appears, from various inſtances in the Acts, to have been the practice of many converts to attend St. Paul from place to place. It is therefore highly probable, I mean that it is highly conſiſtent with the account in the hiſtory, that Jaſon, according to that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count a zealous diſciple, the inhabitant of a city at no great diſtance from Greece, and through which, as it ſhould ſeem, St. Paul had lately paſſed, ſhould have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied St. Paul into Greece, and have been with him there at this time. Lucius is another name in the epiſtle. A very ſlight alteration would convert <gap reason="foreign">

But if any one ſhall ſtill contend that a
forger of the epiſtle, with the Acts of the
Apoſtles before him, and having ſettled his
ſcheme of writing a letter as from St. Paul
upon his ſecond viſit into Greece, would
caſily think of the expedient of putting
in the names of thoſe perſons who appeared
to be with St. Paul at the time, as an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
recommendation of the impoſture;
I then repeat my obſervations: firſt, that he
would have made the catalogue more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete;
and ſecondly, that with this contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
in his thoughts, it was certainly his
buſineſs, in order to avail himſelf of the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
to have ſtated in the body of the epiſtle
that St. Paul was in Greece when he wrote
it, and that he was there upon his ſecond
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0539601100:36"/>
viſit. Neither of which he has done, either
directly, or even ſo as to be diſcoverable by
any circumſtance found in the narrative de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
in the Acts.</p>
                  <p>Under the ſame head, viz. of coincidences
depending upon date, I cite from the epiſtle
the following ſalutation: "Greet Priſcilla and
Aquila, my helpers in Chriſt Jeſus, who
have for my life laid down their own necks;
unto whom not only I give thanks, but
alſo all the churches of the Gentiles."
Chap. xvi. 3.—It appears, from the Acts of
the Apoſtles, that Priſcilla and Aquila had
originally been inhabitants of Rome; for
we read, Acts xviii. 2, that "Paul found a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Jew, named Aquila, lately come from
Italy with his wife Priſcilla, becauſe that
Claudius had commanded all Jews to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from <hi>Rome.</hi>" They were connected
therefore with the place to which the ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are ſent. That is one coincidence; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is the following: St. Paul became ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with theſe perſons at Corinth during
his firſt viſit into Greece. They accompanied
him upon his return into Aſia; were ſettled
for ſome time at Epheſus, Acts xviii. 19-26;
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0539601100:37"/>
and appear to have been with St. Paul when
he wrote from that place his firſt Epiſtle
to the Corinthians, 1 Cor. xvi. 19. Not
long after the writing of which epiſtle St.
Paul went from Epheſus into Macedonia,
and "after he had gone over thoſe parts"
proceeded from thence upon his ſecond viſit
into Greece; during which viſit, or rather
at the concluſion of it, the Epiſtle to the
Romans, as hath been ſhewn, was written.
We have therefore the time of St. Paul's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence
at Epheſus after he had written to the
Corinthians, the time taken up by his progreſs
through Macedonia (which is indefinite, and
was probably conſiderable), and his three
months abode in Greece; we have the ſum
of theſe three periods allowed for Aquila and
Priſcilla going back to Rome, ſo as to be
there when the epiſtle before us was written.
Now what this quotation leads us to obſerve
is, the danger of ſcattering names and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
in writings like the preſent, how
implicated they often are with dates and
places, and that nothing but truth can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
conſiſtency. Had the notes of time in
the Epiſtle to the Romans fixed the writing
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0539601100:38"/>
of it to any date prior to St. Paul's firſt reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
at Corinth, the ſalutation of Aquila
and Priſcilla would have contradicted the
hiſtory, becauſe it would have been prior to
his acquaintance with theſe perſons. If the
notes of time had fixed it to any period
during <hi>that</hi> reſidence at Corinth, during his
journey to Jeruſalem when he firſt returned
out of Greece, during his ſtay at Antioch
whither he went down from Jeruſalem, or
during his ſecond progreſs through the Leſſer
Aſia upon which he proceeded from Antioch,
an equal contradiction would have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred;
becauſe from Acts xviii. 2-18, 19-
26, it appears that during all this time Aquila
and Priſcilla were either along with St. Paul,
or were abiding at Epheſus. Laſtly, had the
notes of time in this epiſtle, which we have
ſeen to be perfectly incidental, compared
with the notes of time in the firſt Epiſtle
to the Corinthians, which are equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental,
fixed this epiſtle to be either
cotemporary with that, or prior to it, a
ſimilar contradiction would have enſued;
becauſe, firſt, when the Epiſtle to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians
was written, Aquila and Priſcilla were
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0539601100:39"/>
along with St. Paul, as they joined in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation
of that church, 1 Cor. xvi. 19; and
becauſe, ſecondly, the hiſtory does not allow
us to ſuppoſe, that between the time of their
becoming acquainted with St. Paul, and the
time of St. Paul's writing to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,
Aquila and Priſcilla could have gone
to Rome, ſo as to have been ſaluted in an
epiſtle to that city; and then come back to St.
Paul at Epheſus, ſo as to be joined with him
in ſaluting the church of Corinth. As it is,
all things are conſiſtent. The Epiſtle to the
Romans is poſterior even to the ſecond
Epiſtle to the Corinthians; becauſe it ſpeaks
of a contribution in Achaia being completed,
which the ſecond Epiſtle to the Corinthians
chap. viii. is only ſoliciting. It is ſufficiently
therefore poſterior to the firſt Epiſtle to the
Corinthians, to allow time in the interval for
Aquila and Priſcilla's return from Epheſus
to Rome.</p>
                  <p>Before we diſmiſs theſe two perſons, we
may take notice of the terms of commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in which St. Paul deſcribes them, and
of the agreement of that encomium with
the hiſtory. "My helpers in Chriſt Jeſus,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0539601100:40"/>
who have for my life laid down their
necks; unto whom not only I give thanks,
but alſo all the churches of the Gentiles."
In the eighteenth chapter of the Acts, we
are informed that Aquila and Priſcilla were
Jews; that St. Paul firſt met with them at
Corinth; that for ſome time he abode in
the ſame houſe with them; that St. Paul's
contention at Corinth was with the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
Jews, who at firſt "oppoſed and
blaſphemed, and afterwards with one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
raiſed an inſurrection againſt him;"
that Aquila and Priſcilla adhered, we may
conclude, to St. Paul throughout this whole
conteſt; for, when he left the city, they
went with him, Acts xiii. 18. Under theſe
circumſtances, it is highly probable that they
ſhould be involved in the dangers and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions
which St. Paul underwent from
the Jews, being themſelves Jews; and, by
adhering to St. Paul in this diſpute, deſerters,
as they would be accounted, of the Jewiſh
cauſe. Farther, as they, though Jews, were
aſſiſting to St. Paul in preaching to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
at Corinth, they had taken a decided
part in the great controverſy of that day,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0539601100:41"/>
the admiſſion of the Gentiles to a parity of
religious ſituation with the Jews. For this
conduct alone, if there was no other reaſon,
they may ſeem to have been entitled to
"thanks from the churches of the Gentiles."
They were Jews taking part with Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.
Yet is all this ſo indirectly intimated,
or rather ſo much of it left to inference in
the account given in the Acts, that I do not
think it probable that a forger either could
or would have drawn his repreſentation from
thence; and ſtill leſs probable do I think it,
that, without having ſeen the Acts, he could
by mere accident, and without truth for his
guide, have delivered a repreſentation ſo
conformable to the circumſtances there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded.</p>
                  <p>The two congruities laſt adduced depended
upon the time, the two following regard the
place, of the epiſtle.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chap. xvi. 23. "Eraſtus, the chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain
of the city, ſaluteth you"—of what
city? We have ſeen, that is, we have infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from circumſtances found in the epiſtle,
compared with circumſtances found in the
Acts of the Apoſtles, and in the two Epiſtles
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0539601100:42"/>
to the Corinthians, that our epiſtle was
written during St. Paul's ſecond viſit to the
peninſula of Greece. Again, as St. Paul,
in his epiſtle to the church of Corinth,
1 Cor. xvi. 3, ſpeaks of a collection going
on in that city, and of his deſire that it
might be ready againſt he came thither;
and as in this epiſtle he ſpeaks of that col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
being ready, it follows that the
epiſtle was written either whilſt he was at
Corinth, or after he had been there. Thirdly,
ſince St. Paul ſpeaks in this epiſtle of his
journey to Jeruſalem, as about inſtantly to
take place; and as we learn, Acts xx. 3, that
his deſign and attempt was to ſail upon that
journey immediately from Greece, properly
ſo called, <hi>i. e.</hi> as diſtinguiſhed from Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia;
it is probable that he was in this
country when he wrote the epiſtle, in which
he ſpeaks of himſelf as upon the eve of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out. If in Greece, he was moſt likely
at Corinth; for the two Epiſtles to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians
ſhew that the principal end of his
coming into Greece was to viſit that city,
where he had founded a church. Certainly
we know no place in Greece in which his
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0539601100:43"/>
preſence was ſo probable: at leaſt, the
placing of him at Corinth ſatisfies every
circumſtance. Now that Eraſtus was an
inhabitant of Corinth, or had ſome connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with Corinth, is rendered a fair ſubject
of preſumption, by that which is accident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ſaid of him in the ſecond Epiſtle to
Timothy, chap. iii. v. 20, "Eraſtus abode at
<hi>Corinth.</hi>" St. Paul complains of his ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
and is telling Timothy what was
become of his companions: "Eraſtus abode
at Corinth; but Trophimus have I left at
Miletum, ſick." Eraſtus was one of thoſe
who had attended St. Paul in his travels,
Acts xix. 22; and when thoſe travels had,
upon ſome occaſion, brought our apoſtle
and his train to Corinth, Eraſtus ſtaid there,
for no reaſon ſo probable as that it was his
home. I allow that this coincidence is not
ſo preciſe as ſome others, yet I think it too
clear to be produced by accident; for, of
the many places which this ſame epiſtle has
aſſigned to different perſons, and the innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
others which it might have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
how came it to fix upon Corinth for
Eraſtus? And, as far as it is a coincidence,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0539601100:44"/>
it is certainly undeſigned on the part of the
author of the Epiſtle to the Romans: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he has not told us of what city Eraſtus
was the chamberlain; or, which is the ſame
thing, from what city the epiſtle was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
the ſetting forth of which was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
neceſſary to the diſplay of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incidence,
if any ſuch diſplay had been
thought of: nor could the author of the
Epiſtle to Timothy leave Eraſtus at Corinth,
from any thing he might have read in the
Epiſtle to the Romans, becauſe Corinth is
no where in that Epiſtle mentioned either
by name or deſcription.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chap. xvi. 1-3. "I commend unto you
Phoebe, our ſiſter, which is a ſervant of
the church which is at Cenchrea, that ye
receive her in the Lord, as becometh
ſaints, and that ye aſſiſt her in whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
buſineſs ſhe hath need of you; for
ſhe hath been a ſuccourer of many, and
of myſelf alſo." Cenchrea adjoined to
Corinth; St. Paul therefore, at the time of
writing the letter, was in the neighbourhood
of the woman whom he thus recommends.
But, farther, that St. Paul had before this
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0539601100:45"/>
been at Cenchrea itſelf, appears from the
eighteenth chapter of the Acts; and appears
by a circumſtance as incidental, and as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
deſign, as any that can be imagined.
"Paul after this tarried there (viz. at Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth)
yet a good while, and then took
his leave of the brethren, and ſailed thence
into Syria, and with him Priſcilla and
Aquila, having ſhorn his head <hi>in Cenchrea,</hi>
for he had a vow." xviii. 18. The ſhav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the head denoted the expiration of
the Nazaritic vow. The hiſtorian therefore,
by the mention of this circumſtance, vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
tells us that St. Paul's vow was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired
before he ſet forward upon his voyage,
having deferred probably his departure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
he ſhould be releaſed from the reſtrictions
under which his vow laid him. Shall we
ſay that the author of the Acts of the Apoſtles
feigned this anecdote of St. Paul at Cenchrea,
becauſe he had read in the Epiſtle to the
Romans that "Phoebe, a ſervant of the
church of Cenchrea, had been a ſuccourer
of many, and of him alſo?" or ſhall we
ſay that the author of the Epiſtle to the
Romans, out of his own imagination, created
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0539601100:46"/>
Phoebe "<hi>a ſervant of the church at Cenchrea,</hi>"
becauſe he read in the Acts of the Apoſtles
that Paul had "ſhorn his head" in that
place?</p>

                  <p>Let it be obſerved that our epiſtle pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
to have been written at the concluſion
of St. Paul's ſecond journey into Greece;
that the quotation from the Acts contains
words ſaid to have been ſpoken by St.
Paul at Epheſus, ſome time before he ſet
forwards upon that journey. Now I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that it is impoſſible that two indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
fictions ſhould have attributed to St.
Paul the ſame purpoſe, eſpecially a purpoſe
ſo ſpecific and particular as this, which was
not merely a general deſign of viſiting
Rome, but a deſign of viſiting Rome after he
had paſſed through Macedonia and Achaia,
and after he had performed a voyage from
theſe countries to Jeruſalem. The confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
between the hiſtory and the epiſtle is
perfect. In the firſt quotation from the
epiſtle, we find that a deſign of viſiting
Rome had long dwelt in the apoſtle's
mind: in the quotation from the Acts we
find that deſign expreſſed a conſiderable
time before the epiſtle was written. In the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0539601100:48"/>
hiſtory we find that the plan which St.
Paul had formed, was to paſs through Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia
and Achaia; after that, to go to Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem;
and, when he had finiſhed his viſit
there, to ſail for Rome. When the epiſtle
was written, he had executed ſo much of
his plan, as to have paſſed through Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia
and Achaia; and was preparing to
purſue the remainder of it, by ſpeedily
ſetting out towards Jeruſalem: and in this
point of his travels he tells his friends at
Rome, that, when he had completed the
buſineſs which carried him to Jeruſalem, he
would come to them. Secondly, I ſay
that the very inſpection of the paſſages will
ſatisfy us that they were not made up from
one another.</p>
                  <p>"Whenſoever I take my journey into

have fully preached the goſpel of Chriſt."</p>
                  <p>I do not think that theſe words neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
import that St. Paul had penetrated into
Illyricum, or preached the goſpel in that
province; but rather that he had come to
the confines of Illyricum (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>),
and that theſe confines were the external
boundary of his travels. St. Paul conſiders
Jeruſalem as the centre, and is here viewing
the circumference to which his travels had
extended. The form of expreſſion in the
original conveys this idea—<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.
Illyricum was the
part of this circle which he mentions in an
Epiſtle to the Romans, becauſe it lay in a
direction from Jeruſalem towards that city,
and pointed out to the Roman readers the
neareſt place to them, to which his travels
from Jeruſalem had brought him. The
name of Illyricum no where occurs in the
Acts of the Apoſtles; no ſuſpicion, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
can be conceived that the mention of
it was borrowed from thence. Yet I think it
appears, from theſe ſame Acts, that St. Paul,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0539601100:51"/>
before the time when he wrote his Epiſtle to
the Romans, had reached the confines of
Illyricum; or, however, that he might have
done ſo, in perfect conſiſtency with the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
there delivered. Illyricum adjoins
upon Macedonia; meaſuring from Jeruſalem
towards Rome, it lies cloſe behind it. If,
therefore, St. Paul traverſed the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of Macedonia, the route would neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bring him to the confines of Illyricum,
and theſe confines would be deſcribed as the
extremity of his journey. Now the account
of St. Paul's ſecond viſit to the peninſula of
Greece, is contained in theſe words: "He
departed for to go into Macedonia; <hi>and
when he had gone over theſe parts,</hi> and had
given them much exhortation, he came
into Greece." Acts xx. 2. This account
allows, or rather leads us to ſuppoſe, that
St. Paul, in going over Macedonia (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>),
had paſſed ſo far to the weſt, as
to come into thoſe parts of the country which
were contiguous to Illyricum, if he did
not enter into Illyricum itſelf. The hiſtory,
therefore, and the epiſtle ſo far agree, and
the agreement is much ſtrengthened by a
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0539601100:52"/>
coincidence of <hi>time.</hi> At the time the epiſtle
was written, St. Paul might ſay, in confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
with the hiſtory, that he had "come
into Illyricum:" much before that time,
he could not have ſaid ſo; for, upon his
former journey to Macedonia, his route is
laid down from the time of his landing at
Philippi to his ſailing from Corinth. We
trace him from Philippi to Amphipolis and
Appollonia; from thence to Theſſalonica;
from Theſſalonica to Beraea; from Beraea
to Athens; and from Athens to Corinth:
which track confines him to the eaſtern ſide
of the peninſula, and therefore keeps him
all the while at a conſiderable diſtance from
Illyricum. Upon his ſecond viſit to Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia,
the hiſtory, we have ſeen, leaves him
at liberty. It muſt have been, therefore,
upon that ſecond viſit, if at all, that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
Illyricum; and this viſit, we know,
almoſt immediately preceded the writing
of the epiſtle. It was natural that the
apoſtle ſhould refer to a journey which was
freſh in his thoughts.</p>

journey to Jeruſalem which is ſpoken of in
theſe two paſſages; that the epiſtle was
written immediately before St. Paul ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
upon this journey from Achaia; that
the words in the Acts were uttered by him
when he had proceeded in that journey as
far as Miletus, in Leſſer Aſia. This being
remembered, I obſerve that the two paſſages,
without any reſemblance between them
that could induce us to ſuſpect that they
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0539601100:54"/>
were borrowed from one another, repreſent
the ſtate of St. Paul's mind, with reſpect to
the event of the journey, in terms of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial
agreement. They both expreſs his
ſenſe of danger in the approaching viſit to
Jeruſalem; they both expreſs the doubt
which dwelt upon his thoughts concerning
what might there befal him. When, in his
epiſtle, he entreats the Roman Chriſtians,
"for the Lord Jeſus Chriſt's ſake, and for
the love of the Spirit, to ſtrive together
with him in their prayers to God for him,
that he might be delivered from them
which do not believe in Judaea," he ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
confeſſes his fears. In the Acts of
the Apoſtles we ſee in him the ſame appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions,
and the ſame uncertainty: "I go
bound in the Spirit to Jeruſalem, <hi>not
knowing</hi> the things that ſhall befal me
there." The only difference is, that in
the hiſtory his thoughts are more inclined
to deſpondency than in the epiſtle. In
the epiſtle, he retains his hope "that he
ſhould come unto them with joy by the
will of God;" in the hiſtory, his mind
yields to the reflection, "that the Holy
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0539601100:55"/>
Ghoſt witneſſeth in every city that bonds
and afflictions awaited him." Now that
his fears ſhould be greater, and his hopes
leſs, in this ſtage of his journey than when
he wrote his epiſtle, that is, when he firſt
ſet out upon it, is no other alteration than
might well be expected; ſince thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetic
intimations to which he refers, when
he ſays, "the Holy Ghoſt witneſſeth in
every city," had probably been received
by him in the courſe of his journey, and
were probably ſimilar to what we know
he received in the remaining part of it at
Tyre (xxi. 4), and afterwards from Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
at Caeſarea (xxi. 11).</p>

                  <p>There is another ſtrong remark ariſing
from the ſame paſſage in the epiſtle; to
make which underſtood, it will be neceſſary
to ſtate the paſſage over again, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more at length.</p>
                  <p>"I beſeech you, brethren, for the Lord

the Spirit, that ye ſtrive together with
me in your prayers to God for me, that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0539601100:56"/>
I may be delivered from them that do not
believe in Judaea—that I may come unto
you with joy by the will of God, and
may with you be refreſhed."</p>
                  <p>I deſire the reader to call to mind that
part of St. Paul's hiſtory which took place
after his arrival at Jeruſalem, and which
employs the ſeven laſt chapters of the Acts;
and I build upon it this obſervation—that
ſuppoſing the Epiſtle to the Romans to
have been a forgery, and the author of the
forgery to have had the Acts of the Apoſtles
before him, and to have there ſeen that St.
Paul, in fact, "was <hi>not</hi> delivered from the
unbelieving Jews," but, on the contrary,
that he was taken into cuſtody at Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
and brought to Rome a priſoner—it is
next to impoſſible that he ſhould have made
St. Paul expreſs expectations ſo contrary to
what he ſaw had been the event; and utter
prayers, with apparent hopes of ſucceſs,
which he muſt have known were fruſtrated
in the iſſue.</p>
                  <p>This ſingle conſideration convinces me,
that no concert or conſederacy whatever
ſubſiſted between the epiſtle and the Acts
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0539601100:57"/>
of the Apoſtles; and that whatever coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidences
have been or can be pointed out
between them, are unſophiſticated, and are
the reſult of truth and reality.</p>
                  <p>It alſo convinces me that the epiſtle was
written not only in St. Paul's life time, but
before he arrived at Jeruſalem; for the
important events relating to him which took
place after his arrival at that city, muſt have
been known to the Chriſtian community
ſoon after they happened: they form the
moſt public part of his hiſtory. But had
they been known to the author of the
epiſtle—in other words, had they then taken
place—the paſſage which we have quoted
from the epiſtle would not have been found
there.</p>

               <div n="7" type="section">
                  <head>No. VII.</head>
                  <p>I now proceed to ſtate the conformity
which exiſts between the argument of this
epiſtle and the hiſtory of its reputed au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.
It is enough for this purpoſe to
obſerve, that the object of the epiſtle, that
is, of the argumentative part of it, was to
place the Gentile convert upon a parity of
ſituation with the Jewiſh, in reſpect of his
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0539601100:58"/>
religious condition, and his rank in the divine
favour. The epiſtle ſupports this point by
a variety of arguments; ſuch as, "that no
man of either deſcription was juſtified
by the works of the law—for this plain
reaſon, that no man had performed them;
that it became therefore neceſſary to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
another medium or condition of
juſtification, in which new medium the
Jewiſh peculiarity was merged and loſt;
that Abraham's own juſtification was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior
to the law, and independent of it;
that the Jewiſh converts were to conſider
the law as now dead, and themſelves as
married to another; that what the law
in truth could not do, in that it was weak
through the fleſh, God had done by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his son; that God had rejected the
unbelieving Jews, and had ſubſtituted in
their place a ſociety of believers in Chriſt,
collected indifferently from Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles."
Soon after the writing of this epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
St. Paul, agreeably to the intention inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
in the epiſtle itſelf, took his journey
to Jeruſalem. The day after he arrived
there, he was introduced to the church.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0539601100:59"/>
What paſſed at this interview is thus related,
Acts xxi. 19: "When he had ſaluted them,
he declared particularly what things God
had wrought among the Gentiles by
his miniſtry: and, when they heard it,
they glorified the Lord; and ſaid unto
him, Thou ſeeſt, brother, how many
thouſands of Jews there are which believe;
and they are all zealous of the law; and
they <hi>are informed of thee,</hi> that thou teacheſt
all the Jews which are among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
to forſake Moſes, ſaying, that they
ought not to circumciſe their children,
neither to walk after the cuſtoms." St.
Paul diſclaimed the charge; but there muſt
have been ſomething to have led to it.
Now it is only to ſuppoſe that St. Paul
openly profeſſed the principles which the
epiſtle contains; that, in the courſe of his
miniſtry, he had uttered the ſentiments
which he is here made to write; and the
matter is accounted for. Concerning the
accuſation which public rumour had brought
againſt him to Jeruſalem, I will not ſay that
it was juſt; but I will ſay that, if he was
the author of the epiſtle before us, and if
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0539601100:60"/>
his preaching was conſiſtent with his writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
it was extremely natural; for, though
it be not a neceſſary, ſurely it is an eaſy
inference, that if the Gentile convert, who
did not obſerve the law of Moſes, held as
advantageous a ſituation in his religious
intereſts as the Jewiſh convert who did,
there could be no ſtrong reaſon for obſerving
that law at all. The remonſtrance therefore
of the church of Jeruſalem, and the report
which occaſioned it, were founded in no
very violent miſconſtruction of the apoſtle's
doctrine. His reception at Jeruſalem was
exactly what I ſhould have expected the
author of this epiſtle to have met with. I
am entitled therefore to argue that a ſeparate
narrative of effects experienced by St. Paul,
ſimilar to what a perſon might be expected
to experience, who held the doctrines ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
in this epiſtle, forms a proof that
he did hold theſe doctrines; and that the
epiſtle bearing his name, in which ſuch doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines
are laid down, actually proceeded
from him.</p>

               <div n="8" type="section">

                  <p>This number is ſupplemental to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
I propoſe to point out in it two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
in the conduct of the argument, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
adapted to the hiſtorical circumſtances
under which the epiſtle was written; which
yet are free from all appearance of contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
and which it would not I think have
entered into the mind of a ſophiſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Epiſtle to the Galatians relates to the
ſame general queſtion as the Epiſtle to the
Romans. St. Paul had founded the church
of Galatia; at Rome he had never been. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
now a difference in his manner of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the ſame ſubject, correſponding with
this difference in his ſituation. In the Epiſtle
to the Galatians he puts the point in a great
meaſure upon <hi>authority</hi>: "I marvel that ye
are ſo ſoon removed from him that called
you into the grace of Chriſt, unto another
goſpel." Gal. i. 6. "I certify you, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
that the goſpel which was preached
of me, is not after man; for I neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it of man, neither was I taught it but
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0539601100:62"/>
by the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt" (ch. i.
ver. 11, 12). "I am afraid leſt I have beſtowed
upon you labour in vain" (iv. 11, 12).
"I deſire to be preſent with you now, for
I ſtand in doubt of you" (iv. 20). "Behold I,
Paul, ſay unto you, that, if ye be circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing" (ch. v. 2).
This perſuaſion cometh not of him that call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
you" (ch. v. 8). This is the ſtyle in which
he accoſts the Galatians. In the epiſtle to the
converts of Rome, where his authority was
not eſtabliſhed, nor his perſon known, he
puts the ſame point entirely upon <hi>argument.</hi>
The peruſal of the epiſtle will prove this to
the ſatisfaction of every reader; and, as the
obſervation relates to the whole contents of
the epiſtle, I forbear adducing ſeparate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts.
I repeat therefore that we have pointed
out a diſtinction in the two epiſtles, ſuited to
the relation in which the author ſtood to his
different correſpondents.</p>
                  <p>Another adaptation, and ſomewhat of the
ſame kind, is the following:</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Jews we know were very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
at Rome, and probably formed a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
part amongſt the new converts; ſo much
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0539601100:63"/>
ſo, that the Chriſtians ſeem to have been
known at Rome rather as a denomination
of Jews, than as any thing elſe. In an epiſtle
conſequently to the Roman believers, the
point to be endeavoured after by St. Paul was,
to reconcile the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> converts to the opinion,
that the Gentiles were admitted by God to a
parity of religious ſituation with themſelves,
and that without their being bound by the law
of Moſes. The Gentile converts would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
accede to this opinion very readily. In
this epiſtle, therefore, though directed to the
Roman church in general, it is in truth a Jew
writing to Jews. Accordingly you will take
notice, that as often as his argument leads him
to ſay any thing derogatory from the Jewiſh
inſtitution, he conſtantly follows it by a ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening
clauſe. Having (ii. 28, 29) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced,
not much perhaps to the ſatisfaction
of the native Jews, "that he is not a Jew
which is one outwardly, neither that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion
which is outward in the fleſh,"
he adds immediately "what advantage then
hath the Jew, or what profit is there in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion?
<hi>much every way.</hi>" Having in the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0539601100:64"/>
third chapter, ver. 28, brought his argument
to this formal concluſion, "that a man is juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
by faith, without the deeds of the
law," he preſently ſubjoins, ver. 31, "do we
then make void the law through faith? God
forbid; <hi>yea, we eſtabliſh the law.</hi>" In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
chapter, when in the ſixth verſe he had
advanced the bold aſſertion, that "now we
are delivered from the law, that being dead
wherein we were held;" in the very next
verſe he comes in with this healing queſtion,
"What ſhall we ſay then? Is the law ſin? God
forbid; nay, I had not known ſin but by
the law." Having in the following words
inſinuated, or rather more than inſinuated, the
inefficacy of the Jewiſh law, viii. 3, "for what
the law could not do, in that it was weak
through the fleſh, God ſending his own Son
in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, and for ſin,
condemned ſin in the fleſh;" after a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion
indeed, but that ſort of a digreſſion
which he could never reſiſt, a rapturous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of his Chriſtian hope, and which
occupies the latter part of this chapter; we
find him in the next, as if ſenſible that he
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0539601100:65"/>
had ſaid ſomething which would give offence,
returning to his Jewiſh brethren in terms of
the warmeſt affection and reſpect. "I ſay
the truth in Chriſt Jeſus; I lie not; my
conſcience alſo bearing me witneſs, in the
Holy Ghoſt, that I have great heavineſs
and continual ſorrow in my heart; for I
could wiſh that myſelf were accurſed from
Chriſt, <hi>for my brethren, my kinſmen ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the fleſh, who are Iſraelites, to
whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory,
and the covenants, and the giving of the law,
and the ſervice of God, and the promiſes;
whoſe are the fathers; and of whom, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the fleſh, Chriſt came.</hi>" When, in
the thirty-firſt and thirty-ſecond verſes
of this ninth chapter, he repreſented to the
Jews the error of even the beſt of their
nation, by telling them that "Iſrael, which
followed after the law of righteouſneſs,
had not attained to the law of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
becauſe they ſought it not by faith,
but as it were by the works of the law,
for they ſtumbled at that ſtumbling-ſtone,"
he takes care to annex to his declaration
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0539601100:66"/>
theſe conciliating expreſſions: "Brethren,
<hi>my heart's deſire and prayer to God for Iſrael</hi>
is, that they might be ſaved; for I bear
them record that they <hi>have a zeal of God,</hi>
but not according to knowledge." Laſtly,
having, ch. x. ver. 20, 21, by the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a paſſage in Iſaiah inſinuated the
moſt ungrateful of all propoſitions to a
Jewiſh ear, the rejection of the Jewiſh
nation, as God's peculiar people; he
haſtens, as it were, to qualify the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of their fall by this intereſting expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation:
"I ſay, then, hath God caſt away
his people (i. e. wholly and entirely)?
<hi>God forbid</hi>; for I alſo am an Iſraelite, of
the ſeed of Abraham, of the tribe of Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin.
<hi>God hath not caſt away his people
which he foreknew</hi>:" and follows this
thought, throughout the whole of the
eleventh chapter, in a ſeries of reflections
calculated to ſoothe the Jewiſh converts, as
well as to procure from their Gentile
brethren reſpect to the Jewiſh inſtitution.
Now all this is perfectly natural. In a real
St. Paul writing to real converts, it is what
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0539601100:67"/>
anxiety to bring them over to his perſuaſion
would naturally produce; but there is an
earneſtneſs and a perſonality, if I may ſo call
it, in the manner, which a cold forgery,
I apprehend, would neither have conceived
nor ſupported.</p>

                  <p>BEFORE we proceed to compare this
epiſtle with the hiſtory, or with any
other epiſtle, we will employ one number
in ſtating certain remarks applicable to
our argument, which ariſe from a perſual
of the epiſtle itſelf.</p>
                  <p>By an expreſſion in the firſt verſe of the
ſeventh chapter, "now concerning the things
whereof ye wrote unto me," it appears, that
this letter to the Corinthians was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by St. Paul in anſwer to one which
he had received from them; and that the
ſeventh, and ſome of the following chapters,
are taken up in reſolving certain doubts, and
regulating certain points of order, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which the Corinthians had in their letter
conſulted him. This alone is a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
conſiderably in favour of the authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticity
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0539601100:69"/>
of the epiſtle: for it muſt have been
a far-fetched contrivance in a forgery, firſt
to have feigned the receipt of a letter from
the church of Corinth, which letter does not
appear; and then to have drawn up a ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
anſwer to it, relative to a great variety
of doubts and enquiries, purely oeconomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
and domeſtic; and which, though like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enough to have occurred to an infant
ſociety, in a ſituation and under an inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
ſo novel as that of a Chriſtian church
then was, it muſt have very much exerciſed
the author's invention, and could have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
no imaginable purpoſe of forgery, to
introduce the mention of at all. Particulars
of the kind we refer to, are ſuch as the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing:
the rule of duty and prudence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
to entering into marriage, as applicable
to virgins, to widows; the caſe of huſbands
married to unconverted wives, of wives having
unconverted huſbands; that caſe where the
unconverted party chooſes to ſeparate, where
he chooſes to continue the union; the effect
which their converſion produced upon their
prior ſtate, of circumciſion, of ſlavery; the
eating of things offered to idols, as it was in
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0539601100:70"/>
itſelf, as others were affected by it; the joining
in idolatrous ſacrifices; the decorum to be
obſerved in their religious aſſemblies, the
order of ſpeaking, the ſilence of women, the
covering or uncovering of the head, as it
became men, as it became women. Theſe
ſubjects, with their ſeveral ſubdiviſions, are
ſo particular, minute, and numerous, that,
though they be exactly agreeable to the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of the perſons to whom the
letter was written, nothing, I believe, but
the exiſtence and reality of thoſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
could have ſuggeſted to the writer's
thoughts.</p>
                  <p>But this is not the only nor the principal
obſervation upon the correſpondence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the church of Corinth and their
apoſtle, which I wiſh to point out. It
appears, I think, in this correſpondence,
that although the Corinthians had written
to St. Paul, requeſting his anſwer and his
directions in the ſeveral points above enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated,
yet that they had not ſaid one
ſyllable about the enormities and diſorders
which had crept in amongſt them, and
in the blame of which they all ſhared;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0539601100:71"/>
but that St. Paul's information concerning
the irregularities then prevailing at Corinth,
had come round to him from other quarters.
The quarrels and diſputes excited by their
contentious adherence to their different
teachers, and by their placing of them in
competition with one another, were not
mentioned in their <hi>letter,</hi> but communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to St. Paul by more private intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence:
"It hath been declared unto me,
my brethren, <hi>by them which are of the houſe
of Chloe,</hi> that there are contentions among
you. Now this I ſay, that every one of
you ſaith, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos,
and I of Cephas, and I of Chriſt" (i. 11, 12).
The inceſtuous marriage "of a man with
his father's wife," which St. Paul repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
with ſo much ſeverity in the fifth
chapter of our epiſtle, and which was not
the crime of an individual only, but a crime
in which the whole church, by tolerating
and conniving at it, had rendered themſelves
partakers, did not come to St. Paul's know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
by the <hi>letter,</hi> but by a rumour which
had reached his ears: "<hi>It is reported commonly</hi>
that there is fornication among you, and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0539601100:72"/>
ſuch fornication as is not ſo much as
named among the Gentiles, that one
ſhould have his father's wife; and ye are
puffed up, and have not rather mourned
that he that hath done this deed might be
taken away from among you" (v. 1, 2).
Their going to law before the judicature of
the country, rather than arbitrate and adjuſt
their diſputes among themſelves, which St.
Paul animadverts upon with his uſual plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
was not intimated to him in the <hi>letter,</hi>
becauſe he tells them his opinion of this
conduct, before he comes to the contents of
the letter. Their litigiouſneſs is cenſured
by St. Paul in the ſixth chapter of his
epiſtle, and it is only at the beginning of
the ſeventh chapter that he proceeds upon
the articles which he found in their letter;
and he proceeds upon them with this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face:
"Now concerning the things whereof
ye wrote unto me" (vii. 1); which intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
he would not have uſed, if he had
been already diſcuſſing any of the ſubjects
concerning which they had written. Their
irregularities in celebrating the Lord's ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and the utter perverſion of the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0539601100:73"/>
which enſued, were not in the <hi>letter</hi>:
as is evident from the terms in which St.
Paul mentions the notice he had received
of it: "Now in this that I declare unto
you, I praiſe you not, that ye came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
not for the better, but for the
worſe; for firſt of all, when ye come
together in the church, <hi>I hear</hi> that there
be diviſions among you, and <hi>I partly
believe it.</hi>" Now that the Corinthians
ſhould, in their own letter, exhibit the fair
ſide of their conduct to the Apoſtle, and
conceal from him the faults of their beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
was extremely natural, and extremely
probable: but it was a diſtinction which
would not, I think, have eaſily occurred to
the author of a forgery; and much leſs
likely is it, that it ſhould have entered into
his thoughts to make the diſtinction <hi>appear</hi>
in the way in which it does appear, viz.
not by the original letter, not by any expreſs
obſervation upon it in the anſwer, but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantly
by marks perceivable in the manner,
or in the order, in which St. Paul takes

                  <p>Our epiſtle purports to have been written
after St. Paul had already been at Corinth:
"I, brethren, <hi>when I came to you,</hi> came not
with excellency of ſpeech or of wiſdom"
(ii. 1): and in many other places to the
ſame effect. It purports alſo to have been
written upon the eve of another viſit to that
church: "I will come to you ſhortly, if the
Lord will" (iv. 19); and again, "I will
come to you when I ſhall paſs through Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia"
(xvi. 5). Now the hiſtory relates
that St. Paul did in fact viſit Corinth <hi>twice</hi>;
once as recorded at length in the eighteenth,
and a ſecond time as mentioned briefly in
the twentieth chapter of the Acts. The
ſame hiſtory alſo informs us, Acts xx. 1,
that it was from Epheſus St. Paul proceeded
upon his ſecond journey into Greece. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as the epiſtle purports to have been
written a ſhort time preceding that jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;
and as St. Paul, the hiſtory tells us,
had reſided more than two years at Epheſus
before he ſet out upon it, it follows that it
muſt have been from Epheſus, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0539601100:75"/>
with the hiſtory, that the epiſtle was
written; and every note of <hi>place</hi> in the
epiſtle agrees with this ſuppoſition. "If,
after the manner of men, I have fought
with beaſts at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> what advantageth
it me, if the dead riſe not?" (xv. 32). I
allow that the apoſtle might ſay this, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he was; but it was more natural and
more to the purpoſe to ſay it, if he was at
Epheſus at the time, and in the midſt of
thoſe conflicts to which the expreſſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates.
"The churches of Aſia ſalute you"
(xvi. 19). Aſia, throughout the Acts of the
Apoſtles and the epiſtles of St. Paul, does
not mean the whole of Aſia Minor or Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolia,
nor even the whole of the proconſular
Aſia, but a diſtrict in the anterior part of
that country, called Lydian Aſia, divided
from the reſt, much as Portugal is from
Spain, and of which diſtrict <hi>Epheſus</hi> was the
capital.—"Aquila and Priſcilla ſalute you"
(xvi. 19). Aquila and Priſcilla were at
<hi>Epheſus</hi> during the period within which this
epiſtle was written (Acts xviii. 18. 26).—"I
will tarry at <hi>Epheſus</hi> until Pentecoſt"
(xvi. 8). This, I apprehend, is in terms al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0539601100:76"/>
aſſerting that he was at Epheſus at the
time of writing the epiſtle.—"A great and
effectual door is opened unto me" (xvi. 9).
How well this declaration correſponded with
the ſtate of things at Epheſus, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
of the Goſpel in theſe parts, we learn
from the reflection with which the hiſtorian
concludes the account of certain tranſactions
which paſſed there: "So mightily grew the
word of God and prevailed" (Acts xix. 20);
as well as from the complaint of Demetrius,
"that not only at Epheſus, but alſo through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all Aſia, this Paul hath perſuaded and
turned away much people" (xix. 26).—"And
there are many adverſaries," ſays the
epiſtle, xvi. 9. Look into the hiſtory of
this period, "when divers were hardened
and believed not, but ſpake evil of that
way before the multitude, he departed from
them, and ſeparated the diſciples." The
conformity therefore upon this head of
compariſon, is circumſtantial and perfect.
If any one think that this is a conformity
ſo obvious, that any forger of tolerable cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and ſagacity, would have taken care to
preſerve it, I muſt deſire ſuch a one to read
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0539601100:77"/>
the epiſtle for himſelf; and, when he has
done ſo, to declare, whether he has diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
one mark of art or deſign; whether
the notes of <hi>time</hi> and <hi>place</hi> appear to him
to be inſerted with any reference to each
other, with any view of their being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with each other, or for the purpoſe
of eſtabliſhing a viſible agreement with the
hiſtory, in reſpect of them.</p>

                  <p>Chap. iv. ver. 17-19. "For this cauſe
I have ſent unto you Timotheus, who is
my beloved ſon and faithful in the Lord,
who ſhall bring you into remembrance of
my ways which be in Chriſt, as I teach
every where in every church. Now ſome
are puffed up, as though I would not
come unto you; but I will come unto you
ſhortly, if the Lord will."</p>
                  <p>With this I compare Acts xix. 21, 22:
"After theſe things were ended, Paul pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
in the ſpirit, when he had paſſed
through Macedonia and <hi>Achaia,</hi> to go to
Jeruſalem; ſaying, after I have been there,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0539601100:78"/>
I muſt alſo ſee Rome: <hi>ſo</hi> he ſent unto
Macedonia two of them that miniſtered
unto him, <hi>Timôtheus</hi> and Eraſtus."</p>
                  <p>Though it be not ſaid, it appears I think
with ſufficient certainty, I mean from the
hiſtory, independently of the epiſtle, that
Timothy was ſent upon this occaſion into
<hi>Achaia,</hi> of which Corinth was the capital city,
as well as into Macedonia; for the ſending
of Timothy and Eraſtus is, in the paſſage
where it is mentioned, plainly connected with
St. Paul's own journey; <hi>he ſent them before
him.</hi> As he therefore purpoſed to go into
<hi>Achaia</hi> himſelf, it is highly probable that
they were to go thither alſo. Nevertheleſs
they are ſaid only to have been ſent into
Macedonia, becauſe Macedonia was in truth
the country to which they went immediately
from Epheſus; being directed, as we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
to proceed afterwards from thence
into Achaia. If this be ſo, the narrative
agrees with the epiſtle; and the agreement
is attended with very little appearance of
deſign. One thing at leaſt concerning it is
certain: that if this paſſage of St. Paul's
hiſtory had been taken from his letter, it
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0539601100:79"/>
would have ſent Timothy to Corinth by
name, or expreſsly however into Achaia.</p>
                  <p>But there is another circumſtance in theſe
two paſſages much leſs obvious, in which
an agreement holds, without any room for
ſuſpicion that it was produced by deſign.
We have obſerved that the ſending of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy
into the peninſula of Greece was
connected in the narrative with St. Paul's
own journey thither; it is ſtated as the
effect of the ſame reſolution. Paul pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to go into Macedonia; "<hi>ſo</hi> he ſent
two of them that miniſtered unto him, Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motheus
and Eraſtus." Now in the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
alſo you remark that, when the apoſtle
mentions his having ſent Timothy unto
them, in the very next ſentence he ſpeaks
of his own viſit: "for this cauſe have I
ſent unto you Timotheus, who is my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
ſon, &amp;c. Now ſome are puffed up, as
though I would not come to you; but I
will come to you ſhortly, if God will."
Timothy's journey we ſee is mentioned in
the hiſtory, and in the epiſtle, in cloſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection
with St. Paul's own. Here is the
ſame order of thought and intention; yet
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0539601100:80"/>
conveyed under ſuch diverſity of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
and expreſſion, and the mention of
them in the epiſtle ſo allied to the occaſion
which introduces it, viz. the inſinuation of
his adverſaries that he would come to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth
no more, that I am perſuaded no at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive
reader will believe, that theſe paſſages
were written in concert with one another,
or will doubt but that the agreement is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought
and uncontrived.</p>
                  <p>But, in the Acts, Eraſtus accompanied
Timothy in this journey, of whom no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is made in the epiſtle. From what has
been ſaid, in our obſervations upon the Epiſtle
to the Romans, it appears probable that Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
was a Corinthian. If ſo, though he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
Timothy to Corinth, he was only
returning home, and Timothy was the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger
charged with St. Paul's orders. At
any rate, this diſcrepancy ſhews that the
paſſages were not taken from one another.</p>

without fear; for he worketh the work of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0539601100:81"/>
the Lord, as I alſo do: let no man therefore
deſpiſe him, but conduct him forth in
peace, that he may come unto me, for I
look for him with the brethren."</p>
                  <p>From the paſſage conſidered in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
number, it appears that Timothy
was ſent to Corinth, either with the epiſtle,
or before it: "for this cauſe have I ſent
unto you Timotheus." From the paſſage
now quoted, we infer that Timothy was not
ſent <hi>with</hi> the epiſtle; for had he been the
bearer of the letter, or accompanied it, would
St. Paul in that letter have ſaid, "<hi>if</hi> Timothy
come?" Nor is the ſequel conſiſtent with the
ſuppoſition of his carrying the letter; for if
Timothy was with the Apoſtle when he wrote
the letter, could he ſay, as he does, "I look
for him with the brethren?" I conclude
therefore that Timothy had left St. Paul to
proceed upon his journey before the letter
was written. Farther, the paſſage before us
ſeems to imply, that Timothy was not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
by St. Paul to arrive at Corinth, till
after they had received the letter. He gives
them directions in the letter how to treat
him when he ſhould arrive; "if he come,"
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0539601100:82"/>
act towards him ſo and ſo. Laſtly, the
whole form of expreſſion is moſt naturally
applicable to the ſuppoſition of Timothy's
coming to Corinth, not directly from St.
Paul, but from ſome other quarter; and that
his inſtructions had been, when he ſhould
reach Corinth, to return. Now, how ſtands
this matter in the hiſtory? Turn to the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
chapter and twenty-firſt verſe of the
Acts, and you will find that Timothy did
not, when ſent from Epheſus, where he left
St. Paul, and where the preſent epiſtle was
written, proceed by a ſtraight courſe to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,
but that he went round through Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia.
This clears up every thing; for,
although Timothy was ſent forth upon his
journey before the letter was written, yet
he might not reach Corinth till after the
letter arrived there; and he would come to
Corinth, when he did come, not directly
from St. Paul at Epheſus, but from ſome
part of Macedonia. Here therefore is a
circumſtantial and critical agreement, and
unqueſtionably without deſign; for neither
of the two paſſages in the epiſtle mentions
Timothy's journey into Macedonia at all,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0539601100:83"/>
though nothing but a circuit of that kind
can explain and reconcile the expreſſions
which the writer uſes.</p>

every one of you ſaith, I am of Paul, and

                  <p>Alſo, iii. 6, "I have planted, Apollos wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
but God gave the increaſe."</p>
                  <p>This expreſſion; "I have planted, Apollos
watered," imports two things; firſt, that Paul
had been at Corinth before Apollos; ſecondly,
that Apollos had been at Corinth after Paul,
but before the writing of this epiſtle. This im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
account of the ſeveral events, and of the
order in which they took place, correſponds
exactly with the hiſtory. St. Paul, after his
firſt viſit into Greece, returned from Corinth
into Syria by the way of Epheſus; and, drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
his companions Aquila and Priſcilla at
Epheſus, he proceeded forwards to Jeruſalem:
from Jeruſalem he deſcended to Antioch; and
from thence made a progreſs through ſome
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0539601100:84"/>
of the upper or northern provinces of the
Leſſer Aſia (Acts xviii. 19. 23): during which
progreſs, and conſequently in the interval
between St. Paul's firſt and ſecond viſit to
Corinth, and conſequently alſo before the
writing of this epiſtle, which was at Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
two years at leaſt after the apoſtle's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
from his progreſs, we hear of Apollos,
and we hear of him at Corinth. Whilſt St.
Paul was engaged, as hath been ſaid, in
Phrygia and Galatia, Apollos came down to
Epheſus; and being, in St. Paul's abſence, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
by Aquila and Priſcilla, and having
obtained letters of recommendation from the
church at Epheſus, he paſſed over to Achaia;
and when he was there, we read that he
"helped them much which had believed
through grace, for he mightily convinced
the Jews, and that publicly." Acts xviii. 27,
28. To have brought Apollos into Achaia,
of which Corinth was the capital city, as well
as the principal Chriſtian church; and to
have ſhewn that he preached the goſpel in
that country, would have been ſufficient for
our purpoſe. But the hiſtory happens alſo
to mention Corinth by name, as the place
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0539601100:85"/>
in which Apollos, after his arrival in Achaia,
fixed his reſidence; for, proceeding with the
account of St. Paul's travels, it tells us, that
while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul, having
paſſed through the upper coaſts, came down
to Epheſus (xix. 1). What is ſaid there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of Apollos, in the epiſtle, coincides ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly,
and eſpecially in the point of chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,
with what is delivered concerning him
in the hiſtory. The only queſtion now is,
whether the alluſions were made with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to this coincidence. Now, the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
and purpoſes for which the name of
Apollos is introduced in the Acts and in
the epiſtles, are ſo independent and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote,
that it is impoſſible to diſcover the
ſmalleſt reference from one to the other.
Apollos is mentioned in the Acts, in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
connection with the hiſtory of
Aquila and Priſcilla, and for the very ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
circumſtance of his "knowing only
the baptiſm of John." In the epiſtle, where
none of theſe circumſtances are taken notice
of, his name firſt occurs, for the purpoſe of
reproving the contentious ſpirit of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians;
and it occurs only in conjunction
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0539601100:86"/>
with that of ſome others: "Every one of
you ſaith, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos,
and I of Cephas, and I of Chriſt." The
ſecond paſſage in which Apollos appears,
"I have planted, Apollos watered," fixes,
as we have obſerved, the order of time
amongſt three diſtinct events; but it fixes
this, I will venture to pronounce, without
the writer perceiving that he was doing any
ſuch thing. The ſentence fixes this order
in exact conformity with the hiſtory; but it
is itſelf introduced ſolely for the ſake of the
reflection which follows: "Neither is he
that planteth any thing, neither he that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth,
but God that giveth the increaſe."</p>

preſent hour we both hunger and thirſt,
and are naked, and are buffetted, and have
no certain dwelling-place; and labour,
working with our own hands."</p>
                  <p>We are expreſsly told, in the hiſtory, that
at Corinth St. Paul laboured with his own
hands: "He found Aquila and Priſcilla; and,
becauſe he was of the ſame craft, he abode
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0539601100:87"/>
with them, and wrought; for by their oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation
they were tent-makers." But,
in the text before us, he is made to ſay,
that "he laboured <hi>even unto the preſent hour,</hi>"
that is, to the time of writing the epiſtle at
Epheſus. Now, in the narration of St.
Paul's tranſactions at Epheſus, delivered in
the nineteenth chapter of the Acts, nothing
is ſaid of his working with his own hands;
but in the twentieth chapter we read, that
upon his return from Greece, he ſent for
the elders of the church of Epheſus, to
meet him at Miletus; and in the diſcourſe
which he there addreſſed to them, amidſt
ſome other reflections which he calls to
their remembrance, we find the following:
"I have coveted no man's ſilver, or gold,
or apparel; yea, you yourſelves alſo know,
that theſe hands have miniſtered unto my
neceſſities, and to them that were with me."
The reader will not forget to remark, that
though St. Paul be now at Miletus, it is to
the elders of the church of Epheſus he is
ſpeaking, when he ſays, "Ye yourſelves
know that theſe hands have miniſtered to
my neceſſities;" and that the whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0539601100:88"/>
relates to his conduct, during his
laſt preceding reſidence at Epheſus. That
manual labour therefore, which he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed
at Corinth, he continued at Epheſus;
and not only ſo, but continued it during
that particular reſidence at Epheſus, near
the concluſion of which this epiſtle was
written: ſo that he might, with the ſtricteſt
truth, ſay, at the time of writing the epiſtle,
"Even <hi>unto this preſent hour</hi> we labour,
working with our own hands." The
correſpondency is ſufficient then, as to the
undeſignedneſs of it. It is manifeſt to my
judgment, that if the hiſtory, in this article,
had been taken from the epiſtle, this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance,
if it appeared at all, would have
appeared in its <hi>place,</hi> that is, in the direct
account of St. Paul's tranſactions at Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.
The correſpondency would not have
been effected, as it is, by a kind of reflected
ſtroke, that is, by a reference in a ſubſequent
ſpeech, to what in the narrative was omitted.
Nor is it likely, on the other hand, that a
circumſtance which is not extant in the
hiſtory of St. Paul at Epheſus, ſhould have
been made the ſubject of a factitious alluſion,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0539601100:89"/>
in an epiſtle purporting to be written by
him from that place: not to mention that
the alluſion itſelf, eſpecially as to time, is
too oblique and general to anſwer any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of forgery whatever.</p>

I became as a Jew, that I might gain the
Jews; to them that are under the law, as
under the law."</p>
                  <p>We have the diſpoſition here deſcribed,
exemplified in two inſtances which the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
records; one, Acts xvi. ver. 3: "Him
(Timothy) would Paul have to go forth
with him, and took and circumciſed him,
<hi>becauſe of the Jews in thoſe quarters</hi>; for
they knew all that his father was a Greek."
This was before the writing of the epiſtle.
The other, Acts xxi. ver. 23, 26, and after
the writing of the epiſtle: "Do this that we
ſay to thee: we have four men which have
a vow on them: them take, and purify
thyſelf with them, that they may ſhave
their heads; and all may know that thoſe
things, whereof they were informed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0539601100:90"/>
thee, are nothing; but that thou
thyſelf alſo walkeſt orderly, and keepeſt
the law.—Then Paul took the men, and
the next day, <hi>purifying himſelf with them,
entered into the temple.</hi>" Nor does this
concurrence between the character and the
inſtances look like the reſult of contrivance.
St. Paul, in the epiſtle, deſcribes, or is made
to deſcribe, his own accommodating conduct
towards Jews and towards Gentiles, towards
the weak and over-ſcrupulous, towards men
indeed of every variety of character; "to
them that are without law as without law,
being not without law to God, but under
the law to Chriſt, that I might gain them
that are without law; to the weak became
I as weak, that I might gain the weak; I
am made all things to all men, that I might
gain ſome." This is the ſequel of the text
which ſtands at the head of the preſent num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
Taking therefore the whole paſſage
together, the apoſtle's condeſcenſion to the
Jews is mentioned only as a part of his
general diſpoſition towards all. It is not
probable, that this character ſhould have
been made up from the inſtances in the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0539601100:91"/>
Acts, which relate ſolely to his dealings with
the Jews. It is not probable that a ſophiſt
ſhould take his hint from thoſe inſtances,
and then extend it ſo much beyond them:
and it is ſtill more incredible, that the two
inſtances in the Acts, circumſtantially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
and interwoven with the hiſtory,
ſhould have been fabricated in order to ſuit
the character, which St. Paul gives of himſelf
in the epiſtle.</p>

                  <p>It may be expected that thoſe whom the
apoſtle baptized with his own hands, were
converts diſtinguiſhed from the reſt by ſome
circumſtance, either of eminence, or of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection
with him. Accordingly, of the three
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0539601100:92"/>
names here mentioned, Criſpus, we find,
from Acts xviii. ver. 8, was a "chief ruler
of the Jewiſh ſynagogue at Corinth, who
believed in the Lord, with all his houſe."
Gaius, it appears from Romans xvi. 23,
was St. Paul's hoſt at Corinth, and the hoſt,
he tells us, "of the whole church." The
houſehold of Stephanas, we read in the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
chapter of this epiſtle, "were the firſt
fruits of Achaia." Here therefore is the
propriety we expected: and it is a proof
of reality not to be contemned; for their
names appearing in the ſeveral places in
which they occur, with a mark of diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
belonging to each, could hardly be
the effect of chance, without any truth to
direct it: and, on the other hand, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that they were picked out from theſe

imaginable deſign<note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. i. ver. 1. "Paul called to be an apoſtle or Jeſus Chriſt, through the will of God, and Soſthenes, our brother, unto the church of God, which is at Corinth."—The only account we have of any perſon who bore the name of Soſthenes, is found in the eight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eenth chapter of the Acts. When the Jews at Corinth had brought Paul before Gallio, and Gallio had diſmiſſed their complaint as unworthy of his interference, and had driven them from the judgment-ſeat; "then all the Greeks," ſays the hiſtorian, "took Soſthenes, the chief ruler of the ſynagogue, and beat him before the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-ſeat." The Soſthenes here ſpoken of was a Corinthian; and if he was a Chriſtian, and with St. Paul when he wrote this epiſtle, was likely enough to be joined with him in the ſalutation of the Corinthian church. But here occurs a difficulty. If Soſthenes was a Chriſtian at the time of this uproar, why ſhould the <hi>Greeks</hi> beat him? The aſſault upon the Chriſtians was made by the <hi>Jews.</hi> It was the <hi>Jews</hi> who had brought Paul before the magiſtrate. If it had been the Jews alſo who had beaten Soſthenes, I ſhould not have doubted but that he had been a favourer of St. Paul, and the ſame perſon who is joined with him in the epiſtle. Let us ſee therefore whether there be not ſome error in our preſent text. The Alexandrian manuſcript gives <gap reason="foreign">

It is certain that, as the whole body of the people were Greeks, the application of <hi>all</hi> to them is unuſual and hard. If I was deſcribing an inſurrection at Paris, I might ſay <hi>all</hi> the Jews, <hi>all</hi> the Proteſtants, or <hi>all</hi> the Engliſh acted ſo and ſo; but I ſhould ſcarcely ſay <hi>all</hi> the French, when the whole maſs of the community were of that deſcription. As what is here offered is founded upon a various reading, and that in oppoſition to the greater part of the manuſcripts that are extant, I have not given it a place in the text.</note>.</p>

                  <p>The churches of Galatia and Phrygia
were the laſt churches which St. Paul had
viſited before the writing of this epiſtle.
He was now at Epheſus, and he came
thither immediately from viſiting theſe
churches: "He went over all the country
of Galatia and Phrygia, in order, ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening
all the diſciples. And it came to
paſs that Paul having paſſed through the

called the upper coaſts, as being the
northern part of Aſia Minor); "came to
Epheſus." Acts xviii. ver. 23; xix. 1.
Theſe therefore, probably, were the laſt
churches at which he had left directions
for their public conduct during his abſenc.
Although two years intervened between his
journey to Epheſus, and his writing this
epiſtle, yet it does not appear that during
that time he viſited any other church. That
he had not been ſilent when he was in Galatia,
upon this ſubject of contribution for the
poor, is farther made out from a hint which
he lets fall in his epiſtle to that church:
"Only they (viz. the other apoſtles) would
that we ſhould remember the poor, the
ſame alſo which I was forward to do."</p>

not come? Turn to the firſt chapter of the
ſecond Epiſtle to the Corinthians, and you
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0539601100:97"/>
will find that he had already <hi>diſappointed</hi>
them: "I was minded to come unto you
before, that you might have a ſecond
benefit; and to paſs by you into Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia,
and to come again out of Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia
unto you, and of you to be brought
on my way toward Judea. When I,
therefore, was thus minded, did I uſe
lightneſs? Or the things that I purpoſe,
do I purpoſe according to the fleſh, that
with me there ſhould be yea, yea, and
nay, nay? But, as God is true, our word
toward you was not yea and nay." It
appears from this quotation, that he had not
only intended, but that he had promiſed
them a viſit before; for, otherwiſe, why
ſhould he apologize for the change of his
purpoſe, or expreſs ſo much anxiety, leſt this
change ſhould be imputed to any culpable
fickleneſs in his temper; and leſt he ſhould
thereby ſeem to them, as one whoſe word
was not, in any ſort, to be depended upon?
Beſides which, the terms made uſe of plainly
refer to a promiſe: "Our <hi>word toward you</hi>
was not yea and nay." St. Paul therefore
had ſignified an intention which he had not
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0539601100:98"/>
been able to execute; and this ſeeming
breach of his word, and the delay of his
viſit, had, with ſome who were evil affected
towards him, given birth to a ſuggeſtion
that he would come no more to Corinth.</p>

                  <p>Dr. Benſon tells us, that from this paſſage,
compared with chapter xvi. ver. 8, it has
been conjectured that this epiſtle was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
about the time of the Jewiſh paſſover;
and to me the conjecture appears to be very
well founded. The paſſage to which Dr.
Benſon refers us is this: "I will tarry at
Epheſus until Pentecoſt." With this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
he ought to have joined another in
the ſame context: "And it may be that I
will abide, yea and winter with you:"
for, from the two paſſages laid together, it
follows that the epiſtle was written before
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0539601100:99"/>
Pentecoſt, yet after winter; which neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
determines the date to the part of the
year, within which the paſſover falls. It
was written before Pentecoſt, becauſe he
ſays, "I will tarry at Epheſus until Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt."
It was written after winter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he tells them, "It may be that I may
abide, yea and winter with you." The
winter which the apoſtle purpoſed to paſs
at Corinth, was undoubtedly the winter
next enſuing to the date of the epiſtle; yet
it was a winter ſubſequent to the enſuing
Pentecoſt, becauſe he did not intend to ſet
forwards upon his journey till after that
feaſt. The words "let us keep the feaſt,
not with old leaven, neither with the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of malice and wickedneſs, but with the
unleavened bread of ſincerity and truth,"
look very like words ſuggeſted by the ſeaſon;
at leaſt they have, upon that ſuppoſition, a
force and ſignificancy which do not belong to
them upon any other; and it is not a little
remarkable, that the hints caſually dropped
in the epiſtle, concerning particular parts
of the year, ſhould coincide with this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>

                  <p>I WILL not ſay that it is impoſſible,
having ſeen the firſt Epiſtle to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,
to conſtruct a ſecond with oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible

that both ſould be fabricated, ſo
as to carry on an order and continuation
of ſtory, by ſucceſſive references to the ſame
events. But I ſay, that this, in either caſe,
muſt be the effect of craft and deſign.
Whereas, whoever examines the alluſions
to the former epiſtle, which he finds in this,
whilſt he will acknowledge them to be ſuch,
as would riſe ſpontaneouſly to the hand of
the writer, from the very ſubject of the

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0539601100:101"/>
were <hi>inſertions</hi> for the purpoſe, or that
the ſeveral tranſactions of the Corinthian
church were feigned, in order to form a
train of narrative, or to ſupport the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of connection between the two epiſtles.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the firſt epiſtle, St. Paul announces his
intention of paſſing through Macedonia, in
his way to Corinth: "I will come to you
when I ſhall paſs through Macedonia."
In the ſecond epiſtle, we find him arrived
in Macedonia, and about to purſue his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to Corinth. But obſerve the manner
in which this is made to appear: "I know
the forwardneſs of your mind, for which
I boaſt of you to them of Macedonia,
that Achaia was ready a year ago, and
your zeal hath provoked very many:
yet have I ſent the brethren, leſt our
boaſting of you ſhould be in vain in this
behalf; that, as I ſaid, ye may be ready,
leſt haply, if they of Macedonia come
with me, and find you unprepared, we,
that we ſay not you, be aſhamed in this
ſame confident boaſting" (chap. ix. 2, 3, 4).
St. Paul's being in Macedonia at the time of
writing the epiſtle, is, in this paſſage, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0539601100:102"/>
only from his ſaying, that he had
boaſted to the Macedonians of the alacrity
of his Achaian converts; and the fear which
he expreſſes, leſt, if any of the Macedonian
Chriſtians ſhould come with him into
Achaia, they ſhould ſind his boaſting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warranted
by the event. The buſineſs of
the contribution is the ſole cauſe of men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
Macedonia at all. Will it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated
that this paſſage was framed merely
to ſtate that St. Paul was now in Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia;
and, by that ſtatement, to produce
an apparent agreement with the purpoſe of
viſiting Macedonia, notified in the firſt epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle?
Or will it be thought probable, that,
if a ſophiſt had meant to place St. Paul in
Macedonia, for the ſake of giving coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
to his forgery, he would have done
it in ſo oblique a manner as through the
medium of the contribution? The ſame
thing may be obſerved of another text in
the epiſtle, in which the name of Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia
occurs: "Furthermore, when I came to
Troas to preach the goſpel, and a door
was opened unto me of the Lord, I had
no reſt in my ſpirit, becauſe I found not
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0539601100:103"/>
Titus, my brother; but taking my leave
of them, I went from thence into Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia."
I mean, that it may be obſerved
of this paſſage alſo, that there is a reaſon for
mentioning Macedonia, entirely diſtinct from
the purpoſe of ſhewing St. Paul to be <hi>there.</hi>
Indeed, if the paſſage before us ſhew that
point at all, it ſhews it ſo obſcurely, that
Grotius, though he did not doubt that Paul
was now in Macedonia, refers this text to
a different journey. Is this the hand of a
forger, meditating to eſtabliſh a falſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity?
The text, however, in which it is
moſt ſtrongly implied that St. Paul wrote
the preſent epiſtle from Macedonia, is found
in the fourth, fifth, and ſixth verſes of the
ſeventh chapter: "I am filled with comfort,
I am exceeding joyful in all our tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for, when we were come into Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia,
our fleſh had no reſt; without were
fightings, within were fears; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
God, that comforteth thoſe that are
caſt down, comforted us by the coming
of Titus." Yet even here, I think, no
one will contend, that St. Paul's coming to
Macedonia, or being in Macedonia, was the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0539601100:104"/>
principal thing intended to be told; or that
the telling of it indeed, was any part of the
intention with which the text was written;
or that the mention even of the name of
Macedonia was not purely incidental, in the
deſcription of thoſe tumultuous ſorrows with
which the writer's mind had been lately
agitated, and from which he was relieved
by the coming of Titus. The ſive firſt
verſes of the eighth chapter, which commend
the liberality of the Macedonian churches,
do not, in my opinion, by themſelves prove
St. Paul to have been in Macedonia, at the
time of writing the epiſtle.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the firſt epiſtle, St. Paul denounces
a ſevere cenſure againſt an inceſtuous mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
which had taken place amongſt the
Corinthian converts, with the connivance,
not to ſay with the approbation, of the
church; and enjoins the church to purge
itſelf of this ſcandal, by expelling the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender
from its ſociety: "It is reported
commonly, that there is fornication among
you, and ſuch fornication, as is not ſo
much as named amongſt the Gentiles, that
one ſhould have his father's wife; and ye
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0539601100:105"/>
are puffed up, and have not rather mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that he that hath done this deed might
be taken away from among you; for I,
verily, as abſent in body, but preſent in
ſpirit, have judged already, as though I
were preſent, concerning him that hath ſo
done this deed; in the name of our Lord
Jeſus Chriſt, when ye are gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and my ſpirit, with the power of
our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to deliver ſuch a
one unto Satan for the deſtruction of the
fleſh, that the ſpirit may be ſaved in the
day of the Lord" (chap. v. ver. 1-5).
In the ſecond epiſtle, we ſind this ſentence
executed, and the offender to be ſo affected
with the puniſhment, that St. Paul now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercedes
for his reſtoration: "Sufficient to
ſuch a man is this puniſhment, which was
inflicted of many; ſo that, contrariwiſe, ye
ought rather to ſorgive him and comfort
him, leſt perhaps ſuch a one ſhould be
ſwallowed up with over-much ſorrow;
wherefore I beſeech you, that ye would
confirm your love towards him" (2 Cor.
chap. ii. ver. 7, 8). Is this whole buſineſs
feigned for the ſake of carrying on a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0539601100:106"/>
of ſtory through the two epiſtles?
The church alſo, no leſs than the offender,
was brought by St. Paul's reproof to a deep
ſenſe of the impropriety of their conduct.
Their penitence, and their reſpect to his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
were, as might be expected, exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
grateful to St. Paul: "We were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
not by Titus's coming only, but by
the conſolation wherewith he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
in you, when he told us your earneſt
deſire, your mourning, your fervent mind
towards me, ſo that I rejoiced the more;
for, bough I made you ſorry with a
letter, I do not repent, though I did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent;
for I perceive that the ſame epiſtle
made you ſorry, though it were but for a
ſeaſon. Now I rejoice, not that ye were
made ſorry, but that ye ſorrowed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;
for ye were made ſorry after a
godly manner, that ye might receive da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
by us in nothing" (chap. vii. 7-9).
That this paſſage is to be referred to the
inceſtuous marriage, is proved by the twelfth
verſe of the ſame chapter: "Though I
wrote unto you, I did it not for his cauſe
that had done the wrong, nor for his cauſe
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0539601100:107"/>
that ſuffered wrong; but that our care for
you, in the ſight of God, might appear
unto you." There were, it is true, various
topics of blame noticed in the firſt epiſtle;
but there was none, except this of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous
marriage, which could be called a
tranſaction between private parties, or of
which it could be ſaid that one particular
perſon had "done the wrong," and another
particular perſon "had ſuffered it." Could all
this be without foundation? or could it be
put into the ſecond epiſtle, merely to furniſh
an obſcure ſequel to what had been ſaid about
an inceſtuous marriage in the firſt?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the ſixteenth chapter of the firſt
epiſtle, a collection for the ſaints is recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to be ſet forwards at Corinth:
"Now, concerning the collection for the
ſaints, as I have given order to the
churches of Galatia, ſo do ye" (chap. xvi.
ver. 1). In the ninth chapter of the ſecond
epiſtle, ſuch a collection is ſpoken of, as in
readineſs to be received: "As touching the
miniſtering to the ſaints, it is ſuperfluous
for me to write to you, for I know the
forwardneſs of your mind, for which I
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0539601100:108"/>
boaſt of you to them of Macedonia, that
Achaia was ready a year ago, and your
zeal hath provoked very many" (chap. ix.
ver. 1, 2). This is ſuch a continuation of
the tranſaction as might be expected; or,
poſſibly it will be ſaid, as might eaſily be
counterfeited: but there is a circumſtance
of nicety in the agreement between the two
epiſtles, which, I am convinced, the author
of a forgery would not have hit upon, or
which, if he had hit upon it, he would have
ſet forth with more clearneſs. The ſecond
epiſtle ſpeaks of the Corinthians as having
begun this eleemoſynary buſineſs a year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
"This is expedient for you, who have
begun before, not only to do, but alſo to
be forward a year ago" (chap. viii. ver. 10).
"I boaſt of you to them of Macedonia, that
Achaia was ready a year ago" (chap. ix.
ver. 2). From theſe texts it is evident, that
ſomething had been done in the buſineſs a
year before. It appears, however, from
other texts in the epiſtle, that the contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was not yet collected or paid; for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
were ſent from St. Paul to Corinth,
"to make up their bounty" (chap. ix. ver. 5).
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0539601100:109"/>
They are urged to "perform the doing of
it" (chap. viii. ver. 11). "And every
man was exhorted to give as he purpoſed
in his heart" (chap. ix. ver. 7). The
contribution therefore, as repreſented in our
preſent epiſtle, was in readineſs, yet not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from the contributors; was begun,
was forward long before, yet not hitherto
collected. Now this repreſentation agrees
with one, and only with one ſuppoſition,
namely, that every man had laid by in ſtore,
had already provided the fund, from which
he was afterwards to contribute—the very
caſe which the firſt epiſtle authoriſes us to
ſuppoſe to have exiſted; for in that epiſtle
St. Paul had charged the Corinthians, "up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the firſt day of the week, every one of
them to lay by in ſtore as God had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpered

He diſclaims the having received any inſpired au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority for the directions which he is giving: "I ſpeak not by commandment, but by occaſion of the forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of others, and to prove the ſincerity of your love" (2 Cor. chap. viii. ver. 8). Who, that had a ſiniſter purpoſe to anſwer by the recommending of ſubſcriptions, would thus diſtinguiſh, and thus lower the credit of his own recommendation?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Although he aſſerts the general right of chriſtian miniſters to a maintenance from their miniſtry, yet he proteſts againſt the making uſe of this right in his own perſon: "Even ſo hath the Lord ordained, that they which preach the goſpel ſhould live of the goſpel; but I have uſed none of theſe things, neither have I written theſe things that it ſhould be ſo done unto me; for it were better for me to die, than that any man ſhould make my glorying, i. e. my profeſſions of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſtedneſs, void" (1 Cor. chap. ix. ver. 14, 15).</p>
                        <p n="3">3. He repeatedly propoſes that there ſhould be aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates with himſelf in the management of the public bounty; not colleagues of his own appointment, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons elected for that purpoſe by the contributors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: "And when I come, whomſoever ye ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove by your letters, them will I ſend to bring your liberality unto Jeruſalem; and if it be meet that I go alſo, they ſhall go with me" (1 Cor. chap. xvi. ver. 3, 4). And in the ſecond epiſtle, what is here propoſed, we find actually done, and done for the very purpoſe of guarding his character againſt any imputation that might be brought upon it, in the diſcharge of a pecuniary truſt: "And we have ſent with him the brother, whoſe praiſe is in the goſpel throughout all the churches; and not that only, but who was alſo choſen of the churches to travel with us with this grace (gift) which is adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by us to the glory of the ſame Lord, and the declaration of your ready mind; avoiding this, that no man ſhould blame us in this abundance which is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered by us; providing for things honeſt, not only in the ſight of the Lord, but alſo in the ſight of men;" i. e. "not reſting in the conſciouſneſs of our own integrity, but, in ſuch a ſubject, careful alſo to approve our integrity to the public judgment" (2 Cor. chap. viii. ver. 18-21).</p>

                  <p>In comparing the ſecond Epiſtle to the
Corinthians with the Acts of the Apoſtles,
we are ſoon brought to obſerve, not only
that there exiſts no veſtige either of the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
having been taken from the hiſtory, or
the hiſtory from the epiſtle; but alſo that
there appears in the contents of the epiſtle
poſitive evidence, that neither was borrowed
from the other. Titus, who bears a conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0539601100:111"/>
part in the epiſtle, is not mentioned
in the Acts of the Apoſtles at all. St. Paul's
ſufferings enumerated, chap. xi. ver. 24,
"of the Jews five times received I forty
ſtripes ſave one; thrice was I beaten with
rods; once was I ſtoned; thrice I ſuffered
ſhipwreck; a night and a day I have been
in the deep," cannot be made out from
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0539601100:112"/>
his hiſtory, as delivered in the Acts, nor
would this account have been given by a
writer, who either drew his knowledge of
St. Paul from that hiſtory, or who was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to preſerve a conformity with it. The
account in the epiſtle, of St. Paul's eſcape
from Damaſcus, though agreeing in the
main fact with the account of the ſame
tranſaction in the Acts, is related with ſuch
difference of circumſtance, as renders it ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
improbable that one ſhould be derived
from the other. The two accounts, placed
by the ſide of each other, ſtand as follows:</p>

                  <p>The opening of this epiſtle exhibits a
connection with the hiſtory, which alone
would ſatisfy my mind, that the epiſtle was
written by St. Paul, and by St. Paul in the
ſituation in which the hiſtory places him.
Let it be remembered, that in the nineteenth
chapter of the Acts, St. Paul is repreſented
as driven away from Epheſus, or as leaving
however Epheſus, in conſequence of an
uproar in that city, excited by ſome inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted
adverſaries of the new religion. The
account of the tumult is as follows: "When
they heard theſe ſayings," viz. Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius's
complaint of the danger to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
from St. Paul's miniſtry to the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
worſhip of the Epheſian goddeſs,
"they were full of wrath, and cried out,
ſaying, Great is Diana of the Epheſians;
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0539601100:114"/>
and the whole city was filled with confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
and having caught Gaius and Ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarchus,
Paul's companions in travel, they
ruſhed with one accord into the theatre;
and when Paul would have entered in
unto the people, the diſciples ſuffered him
not; and certain of the chief of Aſia,
which were his friends, ſent unto him,
deſiring that he would not adventure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
into the theatre. Some, therefore,
cried one thing, and ſome another; for the
aſſembly was confuſed, and the more part
knew not wherefore they were come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
And they drew Alexander out
of the multitude, the Jews putting him
forward; and Alexander beckoned with
his hand, and would have made his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
unto the people; but, when they
knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice,
about the ſpace of two hours, cried out,
Great is Diana of the Epheſians.—And
after the uproar was ceaſed, Paul called
unto him the diſciples, and embraced
them, and departed for to go into Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia."
When he was arrived in Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia,
he wrote the ſecond Epiſtle to the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0539601100:115"/>
Corinthians which is now before us; and
he begins his epiſtle in this wiſe: "Bleſſed
be God, even the father of our Lord
Jeſus Chriſt, the father of mercies, and
the God of all comfort, who comforteth
us in all our tribulation, that we may be
able to comfort them which are in any
trouble, by the comfort wherewith we
ourſelves are comforted of God. For, as
the ſufferings of Chriſt abound in us, ſo
our conſolation alſo aboundeth by Chriſt:
and whether we be afflicted, it is for your
conſolation and ſalvation, which is ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
in the enduring of the ſame ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
which we alſo ſuffer; or whether we
be comforted, it is for your conſolation
and ſalvation; and our hope of you is
ſteadfaſt, knowing that, as ye are partakers
of the ſufferings, ſo ſhall ye be alſo of the
conſolation. For we would not, brethren,
have you ignorant of our trouble <hi>which
came to us in Aſia,</hi> that we were preſſed
out of meaſure, above ſtrength, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that we deſpaired even of life; but
we had the ſentence of death in ourſelves,
that we ſhould not truſt in ourſelves, but
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0539601100:116"/>
in God which raiſeth the dead, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
us from ſo great a death, and doth
deliver; in whom we truſt that he will
yet deliver us." Nothing could be more
expreſſive of the circumſtances in which the
hiſtory deſcribes St. Paul to have been, at the
time when the epiſtle purports to be written;
or rather, nothing could be more expreſſive
of the ſenſations ariſing from theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
than this paſſage. It is the calm
recollection of a mind emerged from the
confuſion of inſtant danger. It is that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
and ſolemnity of thought, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
a recent deliverance. There is juſt
enough of particularity in the paſſage, to ſhew
that it is to be referred to the tumult at
Epheſus: "We would not, brethren, have
you ignorant of our trouble which came
to us in Aſia." And there is nothing more;
no mention of Demetrius, of the ſeizure of
St. Paul's friends, of the interference of the
town-clerk, of the occaſion or nature of the
danger which St. Paul had eſcaped, or even
of the city where it happened; in a word,
no recital from which a ſuſpicion could be
conceived, either that the author of the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0539601100:117"/>
epiſtle had made uſe of the narrative in the
Acts; or, on the other hand, that he had
ſketched the outline, which the narrative in
the Acts only filled up. That the forger of
an epiſtle, under the name of St. Paul, ſhould
borrow circumſtances from a hiſtory of St.
Paul then extant; or, that the author of a
hiſtory of St. Paul ſhould gather materials
from letters bearing St. Paul's name, may be
credited: but I cannot believe that any forger
whatever ſhould fall upon an expedient ſo
reſined, as to exhibit ſentiments adapted to a
ſituation, and to leave his readers to ſeek out
that ſituation from the hiſtory; ſtill leſs, that
the author of a hiſtory ſhould go about to
frame facts and circumſtances, fitted to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the ſentiments which he found in the
letter. It may be ſaid, perhaps, that it does
not appear from the hiſtory, that any danger
threatened St. Paul's life in the uproar at
Epheſus, ſo imminent as that, from which
in the epiſtle he repreſents himſelf to have
been delivered. This matter, it is true, is
not ſtated by the hiſtorian in form; but the
perſonal danger of the apoſtle, we cannot
doubt, muſt have been extreme, when the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0539601100:118"/>
"whole city was filled with confuſion;"
when the populace had "ſeized his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions;"
when, in the diſtraction of
his mind, he inſiſted upon "coming forth
amongſt them;" when the Chriſtians who
were about him "would not ſuffer him;"
when "his friends, certain of the chief of
Aſia, ſent to him, deſiring that he would
not adventure himſelf in the tumult;"
when, laſtly, he was obliged to quit imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
the place and the country, "and,
when the tumult was ceaſed, to depart
into Macedonia." All which particulars
are found in the narration, and juſtify St.
Paul's own account, "that he was preſſed
out of meaſure, above ſtrength, inſomuch
that he deſpaired even of life, that he had
the ſentence of death in himſelf;" <hi>i. e.</hi> that
he looked upon himſelf as a man condemned
to die.</p>

               <div n="4" type="section">
                  <head>No. IV.</head>
                  <p>It has already been remarked, that St.
Paul's original intention was to have viſited
Corinth in his way to Macedonia: "I was
minded to come unto you before, and to
paſs by you into Macedonia" (2 Cor.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0539601100:119"/>
chap. i. ver. 15, 16). It has alſo been remarked
that he changed this intention, and ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately
reſolved upon going through Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia
<hi>firſt.</hi> Now upon this head there exiſts
a circumſtance of correſpondency between
our epiſtle and the hiſtory, which is not
very obvious to the reader's obſervation;
but which, when obſerved, will be found,
I think, cloſe and exact. Which circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
is this: that though the change of
St. Paul's intention be expreſsly mentioned
only in the ſecond epiſtle, yet it appears,
both from the hiſtory and from this ſecond
epiſtle, that the change had taken place
before the writing of the firſt epiſtle; that
it appears however from neither, otherwiſe
than by an inference, unnoticed perhaps by
almoſt every one who does not ſit down
profeſſedly to the examination.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, then, how does this point appear
from the hiſtory? In the nineteenth chapter
of the Acts, and the twenty-firſt verſe, we
are told, that "Paul purpoſed in the ſpirit,
when he had paſſed through Macedonia
and Achaia, to go to Jeruſalem. So he
ſent into Macedonia two of them that
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0539601100:120"/>
miniſtered unto him, Timotheus and Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus;
but he himſelf ſtayed in Aſia for a
ſeaſon." A ſhort time after this, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
in purſuance of the ſame intention,
we find (chap. xx. ver. 1, 2) that "Paul
departed from Epheſus for to go into
Macedonia; and that, when he had gone
over thoſe parts, he came into Greece."
The reſolution therefore of paſſing firſt
through Macedonia, and from thence into
Greece, was formed by St. Paul previouſly
to the ſending away of Timothy. The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in which the two countries are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
ſhews the direction of his intended
route, "when he had paſſed through Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia
and Achaia." Timothy and Eraſtus,
who were to precede him in his progreſs,
were ſent by him from Epheſus into Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia.
He himſelf a ſhort time afterwards,
and, as hath been obſerved, evidently in
continuation and purſuance of the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
"departed for to go into Macedonia."
If he had ever therefore entertained a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
plan of his journey, which is not hinted
in the hiſtory, he muſt have changed that
plan before this time. But, from the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0539601100:121"/>
verſe of the fourth chapter of the firſt
Epiſtle to the Corinthians, we diſcover, that
Timothy had been ſent away from Epheſus
before that epiſtle was written: "For this
cauſe have I ſent unto you Timotheus,
who is my beloved ſon." The change
therefore of St. Paul's reſolution, which was
prior to the ſending away of Timothy, was
neceſſarily prior to the writing of the firſt
Epiſtle to the Corinthians.</p>
                  <p>Thus ſtands the order of dates, as collected
from the hiſtory, compared with the firſt
epiſtle. Now let us enquire, ſecondly, how
this matter is repreſented in the epiſtle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us. In the ſixteenth verſe of the firſt
chapter of this epiſtle, St. Paul ſpeaks of
the intention which he had once entertained
of viſiting Achaia, in his way to Macedonia:
"In this confidence I was minded to come
unto you before, that ye might have a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
benefit; and to paſs by you into
Macedonia." After proteſting, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteenth
verſe, againſt any evil conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that might be put upon his laying aſide
of this intention, in the twenty-third verſe
he diſcloſes the cauſe of it: "Moreover I
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0539601100:122"/>
call God for a record upon my ſoul, that,
to ſpare you, I came not as yet unto Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth."
And then he proceeds as follows:
"But I determined this with myſelf, that
I would not come again to you in heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
for if I make you ſorry, who is he
then that maketh me glad, but the ſame
which is made ſorry by me? <hi>And I wrote
this ſame unto you,</hi> leſt when I came I
ſhould have ſorrow from them of whom
I ought to rejoice; having confidence in
you all, that my joy is the joy of you all:
for, out of much affliction and anguiſh of
heart, <hi>I wrote unto you with many tears</hi>;
not that ye ſhould be grieved, but that ye
might know the love which I have more
abundantly unto you; but if any have
cauſed grief, he hath not grieved me but
in part, that I may not overcharge you
all. Sufficient to ſuch a man is this pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
which was inflicted of many."
In this quotation, let the reader firſt direct
his attention to the clauſe marked by Italics,
"and I wrote this ſame unto you;" and let
him conſider, whether from the context, and
from the ſtructure of the whole paſſage, it
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0539601100:123"/>
be not evident that this writing was after
St. Paul had "determined with himſelf, that
he would not come again to them in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs?"
whether, indeed, it was not in
conſequence of this determination, or at leaſt
with this determination upon his mind?
And, in the next place, let him conſider,
whether the ſentence, "I determined this
with myſelf, that I would not come again
to you in heavineſs," do not plainly refer
to that poſtponing of his viſit, to which he
had alluded in the verſe but one before, when
he ſaid, "I call God for a record upon my
ſoul, that, to ſpare you, I came not as yet
to Corinth;" and whether this be not the
viſit of which he ſpeaks in the ſixteenth
verſe, wherein he informs the Corinthians,
"that he had been minded to paſs by them
into Macedonia;" but that, for reaſons
which argued no levity or fickleneſs in his
diſpoſition, he had been compelled to change
his purpoſe. If this be ſo, then it follows
that the writing here mentioned was poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
to the change of his intention. The
only queſtion, therefore, that remains will
be, whether this writing relate to the letter
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0539601100:124"/>
which we now have under the title of the
firſt Epiſtle to the Corinthians, or to ſome
other letter not extant? And upon this queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
I think Mr. Locke's obſervation deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive;
namely, that the ſecond clauſe marked
in the quotation by Italics, "I wrote unto
you with many tears," and the firſt clauſe
ſo marked, "I wrote this ſame unto you,"
belong to one writing, whatever that was;
and that the ſecond clauſe goes on to advert
to a circumſtance which is found in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
firſt Epiſtle to the Corinthians; namely,
the caſe and puniſhment of the inceſtuous
perſon. Upon the whole then we ſee, that
it is capable of being inferred from St. Paul's
own words, in the long extract which we
have quoted, that the firſt Epiſtle to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians
was written after St. Paul had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to poſtpone his journey to Corinth;
in other words, that the change of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
with reſpect to the courſe of his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
though expreſsly mentioned only in
the ſecond epiſtle, had taken place before the
writing of the firſt; the point which we
made out to be implied in the hiſtory, by
the order of the events there recorded, and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0539601100:125"/>
the alluſions to thoſe events in the firſt epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle.
Now this is a ſpecies of congruity of
all others the moſt to be relied upon. It is
not an agreement between two accounts of
the ſame tranſaction, or between different
ſtatements of the ſame fact, for the fact is
not ſtated; nothing that can be called an
account is given; but it is the junction of
two concluſions, deduced from independent
ſources, and deducible only by inveſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and compariſon.</p>
                  <p>This point, viz. the change of the route,
being prior to the writing of the firſt epiſtle,
alſo falls in with, and accounts for, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in which he ſpeaks in that epiſtle of his
journey. His firſt intention had been, as he
here declares, to "paſs by them into Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia;"
that intention having been previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
given up, he writes, in his firſt epiſtle,
"that he would not ſee them now by the
way," i. e. as he muſt have done upon his
firſt plan; "but that he truſted to tarry
awhile with them, and poſſibly to abide,
yea and winter with them" (1 Cor. chap.
xvi. ver. 5, 6). It alſo accounts for a ſingula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in the text referred to, which muſt ſtrike
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0539601100:126"/>
every reader: "I will come to you when I
paſs through Macedonia; for I do paſs
through Macedonia." The ſupplemental
ſentence, "for I do paſs through Macedonia,"
imports that there had been ſome previous
communication upon the ſubject of the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;
and alſo that there had been ſome vacil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
and indeciſiveneſs in the apoſtle's plan;
both which we now perceive to have been
the caſe. The ſentence is as much as to ſay,
"this is what I at laſt reſolve upon." The
expreſſion "<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>," is ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous;
it may denote either "when I paſs,
or when I ſhall have paſſed, through Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia:"
the conſiderations offered above
fix it to the latter ſenſe. Laſtly, the point we
have endeavoured to make out, confirms, or
rather indeed is neceſſary to the ſupport of a
conjecture, which forms the ſubject of a
number in our obſervations upon the firſt
epiſtle, that the inſinuation of certain of the
church of Corinth, that he would come no
more amongſt them, was founded in ſome
previous diſappointment of their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="5" type="section">

                  <head>No. V.</head>
                  <p>But if St. Paul had changed his purpoſe
before the writing of the firſt epiſtle, why
did he defer explaining himſelf to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,
concerning the reaſon of that
change, until he wrote the ſecond? This
is a very fair queſtion; and we are able, I
think, to return to it a ſatisfactory anſwer.
The real cauſe, and the cauſe at length aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
by St. Paul for poſtponing his viſit
to Corinth, and not travelling by the route
which he had at firſt deſigned, was the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly
ſtate of the Corinthian church at the
time, and the painful ſeverities which he
ſhould have found himſelf obliged to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe,
if he had come amongſt them during
the exiſtence of theſe irregularities. He
was willing therefore to try, before he came
in perſon, what a letter of authoritative ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurgation
would do amongſt them, and to
leave time for the operation of the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
That was his ſcheme in writing the
firſt epiſtle. But it was not for him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
them with the ſcheme. After the
epiſtle had produced its effect (and to the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0539601100:128"/>
utmoſt extent, as it ſhould ſeem of the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's
hopes); when it had wrought in them
a deep ſenſe of their fault, and an almoſt
paſſionate ſolicitude to reſtore themſelves to
the approbation of their teacher; when Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
(chap. vii. ver. 6, 7, 11) had brought him
intelligence "of their earneſt deſire, their
mourning, their fervent mind towards him,
of their ſorrow and their penitence; what
carefulneſs, what clearing of themſelves,
what indignation, what fear, what ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement
deſire, what zeal, what revenge,"
his letter, and the general concern occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
by it, had excited amongſt them;
he then opens himſelf fully upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
The affectionate mind of the apoſtle
is touched by this return of zeal and duty.
He tells them that he did not viſit them at
the time propoſed, leſt their meeting ſhould
have been attended with mutual grief; and
with grief to him embittered by the reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that he was giving pain to thoſe, from
whom alone he could receive comfort: "I
determined this with myſelf, that I would
not come again to you in heavineſs; for
if I make you ſorry, who is he that mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0539601100:129"/>
me glad but the ſame which is made
ſorry by me?" (chap. ii. ver. 1, 2) that
he had written his former epiſtle to warn
them beforehand of their fault, "leſt when
he came he ſhould have ſorrow of them
of whom he ought to rejoice" (chap. ii.
ver. 3); that he had the farther view, though
perhaps unperceived by them, of making
an experiment of their fidelity, "to know
the proof of them, whether they were obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
in all things" (chap. ii. ver. 9). This
full diſcovery of his motive came very natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
from the apoſtle, after he had ſeen the
ſucceſs of his meaſures, but would not have
been a ſeaſonable communication before. The
whole compoſes a train of ſentiment and of
conduct reſulting from real ſituation, and
from real circumſtance, and as remote as
poſſible from fiction or impoſture.</p>

forth in this paſſage, the arrival at Corinth
of brethren from Macedonia during St. Paul's

Acts, chap. xviii. ver. 1, 5: "After
theſe things Paul departed from Athens,

                  <p>The above quotation from the Acts proves
that Silas and Timotheus were aſſiſting to
St. Paul in preaching the goſpel at Corinth.
With which correſpond the words of the
epiſtle (chap. i. ver. 19): "For the Son of
God, Jeſus Chriſt, who was preached
among you by us, even by me, and Silvanus,
and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but
in him was yea." I do admit that the
correſpondency, conſidered by itſelf, is too
direct and obvious; and that an impoſtor
with the hiſtory before him might, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
would, produce agreements of the ſame
kind. But let it be remembered, that this
reference is found in a writing, which from
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0539601100:131"/>
many diſcrepancies, and eſpecially from thoſe
noted No. II. we may conclude, was not
compoſed by any one who had conſulted,
and who purſued the hiſtory. Some obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
alſo ariſes upon the variation of the
name. We read Silas in the Acts, Silvanus
in the epiſtle. The ſimilitude of theſe two
names, if they were the names of different
perſons, is greater than could eaſily have
proceeded from accident; I mean that it is
not probable, that two perſons placed in ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations

hand, the difference of the name in the two
paſſages negatives the ſuppoſition of the
paſſages, or the account contained in them,
being tranſcribed either from the other.</p>

I had no reſt in my ſpirit, becauſe I found

leave of them, I went from thence into
Macedonia."</p>
                  <p>To eſtabliſh a conformity between this
paſſage and the hiſtory, nothing more is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to be preſumed, than that St. Paul
proceeded from Epheſus to Macedonia, upon
the ſame courſe by which he came back from
Macedonia to Epheſus, or rather to Miletus
in the neighbourhood of Epheſus; in other
words, that, in his journey to the peninſula
of Greece, he went and returned the ſame
way. St. Paul is now in Macedonia, where
he had lately arrived from Epheſus. Our
quotation imports that in his journey he had
ſtopped at Troas. Of this, the hiſtory ſays
nothing, leaving us only the ſhort account,
"that Paul departed from Epheſus, for to go
into Macedonia." But the hiſtory ſays,
that in his <hi>return</hi> from Macedonia to Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,
"Paul ſailed from Philippi to <hi>Troas</hi>; and
that, when the diſciples came together on
the firſt day of the week to break bread,
Paul preached unto them all night; that
from Troas he went by land to Aſſos, from
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0539601100:133"/>
Aſſos, taking ſhip and coaſting along the
front of Aſia Minor, he came by Mytelene
to Miletus." Which account proves, firſt,
that Troas lay in the way by which St. Paul
paſſed between Epheſus and Macedonia;
ſecondly, that he had diſciples there. In
one journey between theſe two places, the
epiſtle, and in another journey between the
ſame places, the hiſtory makes him ſtop at
this city. Of the firſt journey he is made
to ſay, "that a door was in that city opened
unto him of the Lord;" in the ſecond we
find diſciples there collected around him, and
the apoſtle exerciſing his miniſtry, with,
what was even in him, more than ordinary
zeal and labour. The epiſtle therefore is in
this inſtance confirmed, if not by the terms,
at leaſt by the probability of the hiſtory; a
ſpecies of conſirmation by no means to be
deſpiſed, becauſe, as far as it reaches, it is
evidently uncontrived.</p>
                  <p>Grotius, I know, refers the arrival at
Troas, to which the epiſtle alludes, to a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
period, but I think very improbably;
for nothing appears to me more certain, than
that the meeting with Titus, which St. Paul
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0539601100:134"/>
expected at Troas, was the ſame meeting
which took place in Macedonia, viz. upon
Titus's coming out of Greece. In the quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
before us, he tells the Corinthians,
"When I came to Troas, I had no reſt in
my ſpirit, becauſe I found not Titus, my
brother; but, taking my leave of them, I
went from thence into Macedonia." Then
in the ſeventh chapter he writes, "When
we were come into Macedonia our fleſh
had no reſt, but we were troubled on every
ſide; without were fightings, within were
fears; nevertheleſs God, that comforteth
them that are caſt down, comforted us by
the coming of Titus." Theſe two paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
plainly relate to the ſame journey of
Titus, in meeting with whom St. Paul had
been diſappointed at Troas, and rejoiced in
Macedonia. And amongſt other reaſons
which fix the former paſſage to the coming
of Titus out of Greece, is the conſideration,
that it was nothing to the Corinthians that
St. Paul did not meet with Titus at Troas,
were it not that he was to bring intelligence
from Corinth. The mention of the diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0539601100:135"/>
in this place, upon any other
ſuppoſition, is irrelative.</p>

                  <p>Chap. xi. ver. 24, 25. "Of the Jews
five times received I forty ſtripes ſave one;
thrice was I beaten with rods; once was
I ſtoned; thrice I ſuffered ſhipwreck; a
night and a day I have been in the deep."</p>
                  <p>Theſe particulars cannot be extracted out
of the Acts of the Apoſtles; which proves,
as hath been already obſerved, that the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
was not framed from the hiſtory; yet
they are conſiſtent with it, which, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how numerically circumſtantial the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
is, is more than could happen to arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
and independent fictions. When I
ſay that theſe particulars are <hi>conſiſtent</hi> with
the hiſtory, I mean, firſt, that there is no
article in the enumeration which is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
by the hiſtory; ſecondly, that the
hiſtory, though ſilent with reſpect to many
of the facts here enumerated, has left ſpace
for the exiſtence of theſe facts, conſiſtent
with the ſidelity of its own narration.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, no contradiction is diſcoverable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0539601100:136"/>
the epiſtle and the hiſtory. When
St. Paul ſays, <hi>thrice</hi> was I beaten with rods,
although the hiſtory record only <hi>one</hi> beating
with rods, viz. at Philippi, Acts, chap. xvi.
ver. 22, yet is there no contradiction. It
is only the omiſſion in one book of what is
related in another. But had the hiſtory
contained accounts of <hi>four</hi> beatings with rods,
at the time of writing this epiſtle, in which
St. Paul ſays that he had only ſuffered <hi>three,</hi>
there would have been a contradiction pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
ſo called. The ſame obſervation ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
generally to the other parts of the
enumeration, concerning which the hiſtory
is ſilent: but there is one clauſe in the quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
particularly deſerving of remark; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
when confronted with the hiſtory, it
furniſhes the neareſt approach to a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
without a contradiction being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
incurred, of any I remember to have
met with. "Once," ſaith St. Paul, "was
I ſtoned." Does the hiſtory relate that
St. Paul, prior to the writing of this epiſtle,
had been ſtoned more than once? The
hiſtory mentions diſtinctly one occaſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which St. Paul was ſtoned, viz. at Lyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0539601100:137"/>
in Lycaonia. "Then came thither cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who
perſuaded the people; and, having ſtoned
Paul, drew him out of the city, ſuppoſing
he had been dead" (chap. xiv. ver. 19). And
it mentions alſo another occaſion in which
"an aſſault was made both of the Gentiles,
and alſo of the Jews with their rulers, to
uſe them deſpitefully, and to ſtone them;
but they were aware of it," the hiſtory
proceeds to tell us, "and fled into Lyſtra
and Derbe." This happened at Iconium,
prior to the date of the epiſtle. Now had
the aſſault been completed; had the hiſtory
related that a ſtone was thrown, as it relates
that preparations were made both by Jews
and Gentiles to ſtone Paul and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions;
or even had the account of this
tranſaction ſtopped, without going on to
inform us that Paul and his companions
were "aware of their danger and ſled," a
contradiction between the hiſtory and the
epiſtle would have enſued Truth is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
conſiſtent; but it is ſcarcely poſſible
that independent accounts, not having truth
to guide them, ſhould thus advance to the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0539601100:138"/>
very brink of contradiction without falling
into it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I ſay, that if the Acts of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
be ſilent concerning many of the inſtances
enumerated in the epiſtle, this ſilence may
be accounted for, from the plan and fabric
of the hiſtory. The date of the epiſtle ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chroniſes
with the beginning of the twentieth
chapter of the Acts. The part, therefore, of
the hiſtory, which precedes the twentieth
chapter, is the only part in which can be
found any notice of the perſecutions to
which St. Paul refers. Now it does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
that the author of the hiſtory was with
St. Paul until his departure from Troas, on
his way to Macedonia, as related chap. xvi.
ver. 10; or rather indeed the contrary ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears.
It is in this point of the hiſtory that
the language changes. In the ſeventh and
eighth verſes of this chapter the third perſon
is uſed. "After <hi>they</hi> were come to Myſia,
<hi>they</hi> aſſayed to go into Bithynia, but the
ſpirit ſuffered them not; and <hi>they</hi> paſſing
by Myſia, came to Troas:" and the third
perſon is in like manner conſtantly uſed
throughout the foregoing part of the hiſtory.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0539601100:139"/>
In the tenth verſe of this chapter, the firſt
perſon comes in: "After Paul had ſeen the
viſion, immediately <hi>we</hi> endeavoured to go
into Macedonia; aſſuredly gathering that
the Lord had called <hi>us</hi> to preach the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
unto them." Now, from this time to
the writing of the epiſtle, the hiſtory occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
four chapters: yet it is in theſe, if in
any, that a regular or continued account of
the apoſtle's life is to be expected; for how
ſuccinctly his hiſtory is delivered in the
preceding part of the book, that is to ſay,
from the time of his converſion to the time
when the hiſtorian joined him at Troas, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the particulars of his converſion it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
which are related circumſtantially, may
be underſtood from the following obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>The hiſtory of a period of ſixteen years
is compriſed in leſs than three chapters;
and of theſe, a material part is taken up with
diſcourſes. After his converſion, he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
in the neighbourhood of Damaſcus,
according to the hiſtory, for a certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable,
though indefinite length of time,
according to his own words (Gal. ch. i. ver. 18),
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0539601100:140"/>
for three years; of which no other account
is given than this ſhort one, that "ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
he preached Chriſt in the ſynagogues,
that he is the Son of God; that all that heard
him were amazed, and ſaid, Is not this he
that deſtroyed them which called on his
name in Jeruſalem? that he increaſed the
more in ſtrength, and confounded the Jews
which dwelt at Damaſcus; and that, after
many days were fulfilled, the Jews took coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
to kill him." From Damaſcus he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to Jeruſalem; and of his reſidence
there nothing more particular is recorded,
than that "he was with the apoſtles, coming
in and going out; that he ſpake boldly in
the name of the Lord Jeſus, and diſputed
againſt the Grecians who went about to
kill him." From Jeruſalem, the hiſtory
ſends him to his native city of Tarſus<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts, chap. ix. ver. 30.</note>.
It ſeems probable, from the order and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of the hiſtory, that St. Paul's ſtay
at Tarſus was of ſome continuance; for we
hear nothing more of him, until, after a long
apparent interval, and much interjacent nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0539601100:141"/>
Barnabas, deſirous of Paul's aſſiſtance
upon the enlargement of the Chriſtian miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
"went to Tarſus for to ſeek him<note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. xi. ver. 25.</note>."
We cannot doubt but that the new apoſtle
had been buſied in his miniſtry; yet of
what he did, or what he ſuffered, during
this period, which may include three or four
years, the hiſtory profeſſes not to deliver
any information. As Tarſus was ſituated
upon the ſea coaſt, and as, though Tarſus was
his home, yet it is probable he viſited from
thence many other places, for the purpoſe
of preaching the Goſpel, it is not unlikely,
that in the courſe of three or four years,
he might undertake many ſhort voyages to
neighbouring countries, in the navigating of
which we may be allowed to ſuppoſe that
ſome of thoſe diſaſters and ſhipwrecks befel
him, to which he refers in the quotation
before us, "thrice I ſuffered ſhipwreck, a
night and a day I have been in the deep."
This laſt clauſe I am inclined to interpret of
his being obliged to take to an open boat,
upon the loſs of the ſhip, and his continuing
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0539601100:142"/>
out at ſea in that dangerous ſituation, a
night and a day. St. Paul is here recounting
his ſufferings, not relating miracles. From
Tarſus, Barnabas brought Paul to Antioch,
and there he remained a year; but of the
tranſactions of that year no other deſcription
is given than what is contained in the four
laſt verſes of the eleventh chapter. After a
more ſolemn dedication to the miniſtry,
Barnabas and Paul proceeded from Antioch
to Cilicia, and from thence they ſailed to
Cyprus, of which voyage no particulars are
mentioned. Upon their return from Cyprus,
they made a progreſs together through the
Leſſer Aſia; and though two remarkable
ſpeeches be preſerved, and a few incidents
in the courſe of their travels circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
related, yet is the account of this
progreſs, upon the whole, given profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly
with conciſeneſs: for inſtance, at Ico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium
it is ſaid that they abode a long
time<note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. xiv. ver. 3.</note>; yet of this long abode, except con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the manner in which they were
driven away, no memoir is inſerted in the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0539601100:143"/>
hiſtory. The whole is wrapped up in one
ſhort ſummary, "they ſpake boldly in the
Lord, which gave teſtimony unto the word
of his grace, and granted ſigns and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to be done by their hands." Having
completed their progreſs, the two apoſtles
returned to Antioch, "and there they abode
long time with the diſciples." Here we
have another large portion of time paſſed
over in ſilence. To this ſucceeded a journey
to Jeruſalem, upon a diſpute which then
much agitated the Chriſtian church, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the obligation of the law of Moſes.
When the object of that journey was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted,
Paul propoſed to Barnabas to go
again and viſit their brethren in every city
where they had preached the word of the
Lord. The execution of this plan carried
our apoſtle through Syria, Cilicia, and many
provinces of the Leſſer Aſia; yet is the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the whole journey diſpatched, in
four verſes of the ſixteenth chapter.</p>
                  <p>If the Acts of the Apoſtles had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
to exhibit regular annals of St. Paul's
miniſtry, or even any continued account of
his life, from his converſion at Damaſcus
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0539601100:144"/>
to his impriſonment at Rome, I ſhould have
thought the omiſſion of the circumſtances
referred to in our epiſtle, a matter of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
objection. But when it appears,
from the hiſtory itſelf, that large portions
of St. Paul's life were either paſſed over in
ſilence, or only ſlightly touched upon, and
that nothing more than certain detached in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
and diſcourſes are related; when we
obſerve alſo, that the author of the hiſtory
did not join our apoſtle's ſociety till a few
years before the writing of the epiſtle, at
leaſt that there is no proof in the hiſtory
that he did ſo; in comparing the hiſtory
with the epiſtle, we ſhall not be ſurpriſed by
the diſcovery of omiſſions; we ſhall aſcribe
it to truth that there is no contradiction.</p>

                  <p>"As ſome others." Turn to Acts xviii. 27,
and you will find that, a ſhort time before
the writing of this epiſtle, Apollos had gone
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0539601100:145"/>
to Corinth with letters of commendations
from the Epheſian Chriſtians; "and when
Apollos was diſpoſed to paſs into Achaia,
the brethren wrote, exhorting the diſciples
to receive him." Here the words of the
epiſtle bear the appearance of alluding to
ſome ſpecific inſtance, and the hiſtory ſupplies
that inſtance; it ſupplies at leaſt an inſtance
as oppoſite as poſſible to the terms which the
apoſtle uſes, and to the date and direction
of the epiſtle, in which they are found. The
letter which Apollos carried from Epheſus,
was preciſely the letter of commendation
which St. Paul meant; and it was to Achaia
of which Corinth was the capital, and indeed
to Corinth itſelf (Acts, chap. xix. ver. 1),
that Apollos carried it; and it was about
two years before the writing of this epiſtle.
If St. Paul's words be rather thought to refer
to ſome general uſage which then obtained
among Chriſtian churches, the caſe of Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los
exempliſies that uſage; and affords that
ſpecies of confirmation to the epiſtle, which
ariſes from ſeeing the manners of the age,
in which it purports to be written, faithfully

The Acts of the Apoſtles record only
two journeys of St. Paul to Corinth. We
have all along ſuppoſed, what every mark
of time except this expreſſion indicates, that
the epiſtle was written between the firſt and
ſecond of theſe journeys. If St. Paul had
been already twice at Corinth, this ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
muſt be given up; and every argument
or obſervation which depends upon it, falls
to the ground. Again, the Acts of the
Apoſtles not only record no more than two
journeys of St. Paul to Corinth, but do not
allow us to ſuppoſe that more than two ſuch
journeys could be made or intended by him
within the period which the hiſtory com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes;
for, from his firſt journey into
Greece to his firſt impriſonment at Rome,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0539601100:147"/>
with which the hiſtory concludes, the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's
time is accounted for. If therefore the
epiſtle was written after the ſecond journey
to Corinth, and upon the view and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a third, it muſt have been written
after his firſt impriſonment at Rome, <hi>i. e.</hi>
after the time to which the hiſtory extends.
When I firſt read over this epiſtle with the
particular view of comparing it with the
hiſtory, which I choſe to do without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting
any commentary whatever, I own
that I felt myſelf confounded by this text.
It appeared to contradict the opinion, which
I had been led by a great variety of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
to form, concerning the date and
occaſion of the epiſtle. At length however
it occurred to my thoughts to enquire, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the paſſage did neceſſarily imply that
St. Paul had been at Corinth twice; or
whether, when he ſays "this is the third
time I am coming to you," he might mean
only that this was the third time that he
was ready, that he was prepared, that he
intended to ſet out upon his journey to
Corinth. I recollected that he had once
before this purpoſed to viſit Corinth, and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0539601100:148"/>
had been diſappointed in his purpoſe; which
diſappointment forms the ſubject of much
apology and proteſtation, in the firſt and
ſecond chapters of the epiſtle. Now, if the
journey in which he had been diſappointed
was reckoned by him one of the times in
which "he was coming to them," then the
preſent would be the third time, <hi>i. e.</hi> of
his being ready and prepared to come; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he had been actually at Corinth only
<hi>once</hi> before. This conjecture being taken
up, a farther examination of the paſſage and
the epiſtle, produced proofs which placed it
beyond doubt. "This is the third time I
am coming to you:" in the verſe following
theſe words he adds, "I told you before,
and foretel you, as if I were preſent <hi>the
ſecond time</hi>; and being abſent, now I write
to them which heretofore have ſinned,
and to all other, that if I come again, I
will not ſpare." In this verſe, the apoſtle
is declaring beforehand what he would do
in his intended viſit: His expreſſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
"as if I were preſent the ſecond time,"
relates to that viſit. But, if his future viſit
would only make him preſent amongſt them
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0539601100:149"/>
a ſecond time, it follows that he had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
there but once. Again, in the fifteenth
verſe of the firſt chapter, he tells them,
"In this confidence, I was minded to come
unto you before, that you might have a
<hi>ſecond</hi> benefit." Why a ſecond, and not a
third benefit? why <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and not <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
if the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, in the fifteenth
chapter, meant a <hi>third</hi> viſit? for, though
the viſit in the firſt chapter be that viſit in
which he was diſappointed, yet, as it is
evident from the epiſtle that he had never
been at Corinth, from the time of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment
to the time of writing the
epiſtle, it follows, that if it was only a ſecond
viſit in which he was diſappointed then, it
could only be a ſecond viſit which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
now. But the text which I think
is deciſive of the queſtion, if any queſtion
remain upon the ſubject, is the fourteenth
verſe of the twelfth chapter: "Behold the
third time I am ready to come to you"
(<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>). It is very
clear that the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> of the
twelfth chapter, and the <gap reason="foreign">

of the thirteenth chapter, are equivalent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0539601100:150"/>
were intended to convey the ſame
meaning, and to relate to the ſame journey.
The compariſon of theſe phraſes gives us
St. Paul's own explanation of his own
words; and it is that very explanation which
we are contending for, viz. that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
does not mean that he was coming
a third time, but that this was the third time
he was in readineſs to come, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.
I do not apprehend, that after this
it can be neceſſary to call to our aid the
reading of the Alexandrian manuſcript,
which gives <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
chapter as well as in the twelfth; or
of the Syriac and Coptic verſions, which
follow that reading; becauſe I allow that
this reading, beſides not being ſufficiently
ſupported by ancient copies, is probably
paraphraſtical, and has been inſerted for the
purpoſe of expreſſing more unequivocally
the ſenſe, which the ſhorter expreſſion <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
was ſuppoſed to carry. Upon
the whole, the matter is ſufficiently certain;
nor do I propoſe it as a new interpretation
of the text which contains the difficulty,
for the ſame was given by Grotius long
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0539601100:151"/>
ago; but I thought it the cleareſt way of
explaining the ſubject, to deſcribe the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in which the difficulty, the ſolution,
and the proofs of that ſolution, ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
preſented themſelves to my enquiries.
Now, in hiſtorical reſearches, a reconciled
inconſiſtency becomes a poſitive argument.
Firſt, becauſe an impoſtor generally guards
againſt the appearance of inconſiſtency; and
ſecondly, becauſe, when apparent incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtencies
are found, it is ſeldom that any
thing but truth renders them capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation.
The exiſtence of the difficulty
proves the want or abſence of that caution,
which uſually accompanies the conſciouſneſs
of fraud; and the ſolution proves, that it is
not the colliſion of fortuitous propoſitions
which we have to deal with, but that a thread
of truth winds through the whole, which
preſerves every circumſtance in its place.</p>

                  <p>Chap. x. ver. 14-16. "We are come
as far as to you alſo, in preaching the
Goſpel of Chriſt; not boaſting of things
without our meaſure, that is, of other
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0539601100:152"/>
men's labours; but having hope, when
your faith is increaſed, that we ſhall be
enlarged by you, according to our rule,
abundantly to preach the Goſpel in the
regions beyond you."</p>
                  <p>This quotation affords an indirect, and
therefore unſuſpicious, but at the ſame time
a diſtinct and indubitable recognition of the
truth and exactneſs of the hiſtory. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
it to be implied by the words of the
quotation, that Corinth was the extremity
of St. Paul's travels <hi>hitherto.</hi> He expreſſes
to the Corinthians his hope, that in ſome
future viſit he might "preach the Goſpel to
the regions beyond them;" which imports
that he had not hitherto proceeded "beyond
them," but that Corinth was as yet the
fartheſt point or boundary of his travels.
Now, how is St. Paul's firſt journey into
Europe, which was the only one he had
taken before the writing of the epiſtle,
traced out in the hiſtory? Sailing from Aſia,
he landed at Philippi; from Philippi, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing
the eaſtern coaſt of the peninſula,
he paſſed through Amphipolis and Apollonia
to Theſſalonica; from thence through Berea
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0539601100:153"/>
to Athens, and from Athens to Corinth,
<hi>where he ſtopped</hi>; and from whence, after a
reſidence of a year and a half, he ſailed back
into Syria. So that Corinth was the laſt
place which he viſited in the peninſula; was
the place from which he returned into Aſia;
and was, as ſuch, the boundary and limit of
his progreſs. He could not have ſaid the
ſame thing, viz. "I hope hereafter to viſit
the regions beyond you," in an epiſtle to
the Philippians, or in an epiſtle to the Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians,
inaſmuch as he muſt be deemed
to have already viſited the regions beyond
<hi>them,</hi> having proceeded from thoſe cities to
other parts of Greece. But from Corinth
he returned home; every part therefore,
beyond that city, might properly be ſaid,
as it is ſaid in the paſſage before us, to
be unviſited. Yet is this propriety, the
ſpontaneous effect of truth, and produced
without meditation or deſign.</p>

                  <p>THE argument of this epiſtle in ſome
meaſure proves its antiquity. It
will hardly be doubted, but that it was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
whilſt the diſpute concerning the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion
of Gentile converts was freſh in
men's minds; for, even ſuppoſing it to have
been a forgery, the only credible motive that
can be aſſigned for the forgery, was to bring
the name and authority of the apoſtle into
this controverſy. No deſign could be ſo
inſipid, or ſo unlikely to enter into the
thoughts of any man, as to produce an
epiſtle written earneſtly and pointedly upon
one ſide of a controverſy, when the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy
itſelf was dead, and the queſtion no
longer intereſting to any deſcription of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
whatever. Now the controverſy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the circumciſion of the Gentile
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0539601100:155"/>
Chriſtians was of ſuch a nature, that, if it
aroſe at all, it muſt have ariſen in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of Chriſtianity. As Judaea was the
ſcene of the Chriſtian hiſtory; as the author
and preachers of Chriſtianity were Jews; as
the religion itſelf acknowledged and was
founded upon the Jewiſh religion, in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinction
to every other religion then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
amongſt mankind; it was not to be
wondered at, that ſome of its teachers ſhould
carry it out in the world rather as a ſect and
modification of Judaiſm, than as a ſeparate,
original revelation; or that they ſhould invite
their proſelytes to thoſe obſervances, in which
they lived themſelves. This was likely to
happen: but if it did not happen <hi>at firſt</hi>; if,
whilſt the religion was in the hands of Jewiſh
teachers, no ſuch claim was advanced, no
ſuch condition was attempted to be impoſed;
it is not probable that the doctrine would
be ſtarted, much leſs that it ſhould prevail
in any future period. I likewiſe think, that
thoſe pretenſions of Judaiſm were much
more likely to be inſiſted upon, whilſt the
Jews continued a nation, than after their
fall and diſperſion; whilſt Jeruſalem and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0539601100:156"/>
the temple ſtood, than after the deſtruction
brought upon them by the Roman arms,
the fatal ceſſation of the ſacrifice and the
prieſthood, the humiliating loſs of their
country, and, with it, of the great rites and
ſymbols of their inſtitution. It ſhould ſeem
therefore, from the nature of the ſubject,
and the ſituation of the parties, that this
controverſy was carried on in the interval
between the preaching of Chriſtianity to the
Gentiles, and the invaſion of Titus; and that
our preſent epiſtle, which was undoubtedly
intended to bear a part in this controverſy,
muſt be referred to the ſame period.</p>
                  <p>But, again, the epiſtle ſuppoſes that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
deſigning adherents of the Jewiſh law had
crept into the churches of Galatia; and had
been endeavouring, and but too ſucceſsfully,
to perſuade the Galatic converts, that they
had been taught the new religion imperfectly
and at ſecond hand; that the founder of
their church himſelf poſſeſſed only an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
and deputed commiſſion, the ſeat of
truth and authority being in the apoſtles
and elders of Jeruſalem; moreover, that
whatever he might profeſs amongſt them,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0539601100:157"/>
he had himſelf at other times, and in other
places, given way to the doctrine of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion.—The
epiſtle is unintelligible
without ſuppoſing all this. Referring there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to this, as to what had actually paſſed,
we find St. Paul treating ſo unjuſt an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to undermine his credit, and to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
amongſt his converts a doctrine which
he had uniformly reprobated, in terms of
great aſperity and indignation. And in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to refute the ſuſpicions which had been
raiſed concerning the fidelity of his teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as well as to aſſert the independency
and divine original of his miſſion, we find
him appealing to the hiſtory of his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
to his conduct under it, to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in which he had conferred with the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
when he met with them at Jeruſalem;
alledging, that ſo far was his doctrine from
being derived from them, or they from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing
any ſuperiority over him, that they
had ſimply aſſented to what he had already
preached amongſt the Gentiles, and which
preaching was communicated not by them
to him, but by himſelf to them; that he
had maintained the liberty of the Gentile
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0539601100:158"/>
church, by oppoſing, upon one occaſion, an
apoſtle to the face, when the timidity of
his behaviour ſeemed to endanger it; that
from the firſt, that all along, that to that
hour, he had conſtantly reſiſted the claims
of Judaiſm; and that the perſecutions which
he daily underwent, at the hands or by the
inſtigation of the Jews, and of which he
bore in his perſon the marks and ſcars, might
have been avoided by him, if he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to employ his labours in bringing,
through the medium of chriſtianity, converts
over to the Jewiſh inſtitution, for then
"would the offence of the croſs have ceaſed."
Now an impoſtor who had forged the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
for the purpoſe of producing St. Paul's
authority in the diſpute, which, as hath been
obſerved, is the only credible motive that
can be aſſigned for the forgery, might have
made the apoſtle deliver his opinion upon
the ſubject, in ſtrong and deciſive terms, or
might have put his name to a train of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning
and argumentation upon that ſide of
the queſtion, which the impoſture was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to recommend. I can allow the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
of ſuch a ſcheme as that. But for a
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0539601100:159"/>
writer, with this purpoſe in view, to feign a
ſeries of tranſactions ſuppoſed to have paſſed
amongſt the Chriſtians of Galatia, and then
to counterfeit expreſſions of anger and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment
excited by theſe tranſactions; to
make the apoſtle travel back into his own
hiſtory, and into a recital of various paſſages
of his life, ſome indeed directly, but others
obliquely, and others even obſcurely bearing
upon the point in queſtion; in a word, to
ſubſtitute narrative for argument, expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
and complaint for dogmatic poſitions
and controverſial reaſoning, in a writing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
controverſial, and of which the aim
and deſign was to ſupport one ſide of a much
agitated queſtion—is a method ſo intricate,
and ſo unlike the methods purſued by all
other impoſtors, as to require very flagrant
proofs of impoſition to induce us to believe
it to be one.</p>

2. That the epiſtle, though written with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any communication with the hiſtory, by
recital, implication, or reference, bears teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
to many of the facts contained in it.</p>
                  <p>I. The epiſtle and the Acts of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
were written without any communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with each other.</p>
                  <p>To judge of this point, we muſt examine
thoſe paſſages in each, which deſcribe the
ſame tranſaction; for if the author of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
writing derived his information from the
account which he had ſeen in the other,
when he came to ſpeak of the ſame tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he would follow that account. The
hiſtory of St. Paul, at Damaſcus, as read
in the Acts, and as referred to by the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
forms an inſtance of this ſort. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Acts, Paul (after his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion)
was certain days with the "diſciples
which were at Damaſcus; and ſtraight-way
he preached Chriſt in the ſynagogues,
that he is the ſon of God. But all that
heard him were amazed, and ſaid, is not
this he which deſtroyed them which called
on this name in Jeruſalem, and came hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for that intent, that he might bring
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0539601100:161"/>
them bound unto the chief prieſts? But
Saul increaſed the more in ſtrength, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding
the Jews which were at Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,
proving that this is the very Chriſt.
And after many days were fulfilled, the
Jews took counſel to kill him; but their
laying in wait was known of Saul, and they
watched the gates day and night to kill him;
then the diſciples took him by night, and
let him down by the wall in a baſket; and
when Saul was come to Jeruſalem, he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayed
to join himſelf to the diſciples."
Acts, chap. ix. ver. 19-26.</p>
                  <p>According to the epiſtle, "when it pleaſed

him among the heathen, immediately I
conferred not with fleſh and blood, neither
went I up to Jeruſalem to them which
were apoſtles before me: but I went into
Arabia, and returned again to Damaſcus;
then, after three years, I went up to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem."</p>
                  <p>Beſide the difference obſervable in the
terms and general complexion of theſe two

accounts, "the journey into Arabia," men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the epiſtle, and omitted in the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
affords full proof that there exiſted no
correſpondence between theſe writers. If
the narrative in the Acts had been made up
from the epiſtle, it is impoſſible that this
journey ſhould have been paſſed over in
ſilence; if the epiſtle had been compoſed
out of what the author had read of St. Paul's
hiſtory in the Acts, it is unaccountable that
it ſhould have been inſerted<note n="*" place="bottom">N. B. The Acts of the Apoſtles ſimply inform us that St. Paul left Damaſcus in order to go to Jeruſalem, "after many days were fulfilled." If any one doubt whether the words "many days" could be intended to expreſs a period which included a term of three years, he will find a complete inſtance of the ſame phraſe uſed with the ſame latitude in the firſt book of Kings, chap. xi. ver. 38, 39: "And Shimei dwelt at Jeruſalem <hi>many days</hi>; and it came to paſs, at the end of <hi>three years,</hi> that two of the ſervants of Shimei ran away."</note>.</p>
                  <p>The journey to Jeruſalem related in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
chapter of the epiſtle ("then, fourteen
years after, I went up again to Jeruſalem") ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
another example of the ſame kind. Either
this was the journey deſcribed in the fifteenth
chapter of the Acts, when Paul and Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0539601100:163"/>
were ſent from Antioch to Jeruſalem,
to conſult the apoſtles and elders upon the
queſtion of the Gentile converts; or it was
ſome journey of which the hiſtory does not
take notice. If the firſt opinion be followed,
the diſcrepancy in the two accounts is ſo
conſiderable, that it is not without difficulty
they can be adapted to the ſame tranſaction:
ſo that, upon this ſuppoſition, there is no
place for ſuſpecting that the writers were
guided or aſſiſted by each other. If the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
opinion be preferred, we have then a
journey to Jeruſalem, and a conference with
the principal members of the church there,
circumſtantially related in the epiſtle, and
entirely omitted in the Acts: and we are
at liberty to repeat the obſervation, which
we before made, that the omiſſion of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
a fact in the hiſtory is inexplicable, if
the hiſtorian had read the epiſtle; and that
the inſertion of it in the epiſtle, if the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
derived his information from the hiſtory,
is not leſs ſo.</p>
                  <p>St. Peter's viſit to Antioch, during which
the diſpute aroſe between him and St. Paul,
is not mentioned in the Acts.</p>

                     <pb n="162" facs="tcp:0539601100:164"/>
If we connect, with theſe inſtances, the
general obſervation, that no ſcrutiny can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the ſmalleſt trace of tranſcription or
imitation either in things or words, we ſhall
be fully ſatisfied in this part of our caſe;
namely, that the two records, be the facts
contained in them true or falſe, come to our
hands from independent ſources.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I ſay that the epiſtle, thus
proved to have been written without any
communication with the hiſtory, bears teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony
to a great variety of particulars con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the hiſtory.</p>

which had been incorporated with it. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this part of his character the hiſtory
makes St. Paul ſpeak thus: "I am verily a
man which am a Jew, born in Tarſus, a
city of Cilicia, yet brought up in this city
at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the perfect manner of the law of
the fathers; and was zealous towards God,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0539601100:165"/>
as ye all are this day." Acts, chap. xxii.
ver. 3.</p>
                  <p>The epiſtle as follows: "I profited in
the Jews religion above many my equals
in mine own nation, being more exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
zealous of the traditions of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers."
Chap. i. ver. 14.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. St. Paul, before his converſion, had
been a fierce perſecutor of the new ſect.
"As for Saul, he made havoc of the church;
entering into every houſe, and haling
men and women, committed them to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon."
Acts, chap. vii. ver. 3.</p>
                  <p>This is the hiſtory of St. Paul, as deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Acts; in the recital of his own
hiſtory in the epiſtle, "Ye have heard,"
ſays he, "of my converſation in times paſt
in the Jews religion, how that beyond
meaſure I perſecuted the church of God."
Chap. i. ver. 13.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. St. Paul was miraculouſly converted on
his way to Damaſcus. "And as he jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyed
he came near to Damaſcus: and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
there ſhined round about him a light
from heaven; and he fell to the earth, and
heard a voice ſaying unto him, Saul, Saul,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0539601100:166"/>
why perſecuteſt thou me? And he ſaid,
Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord ſaid,
I am Jeſus, whom thou perſecuteſt: it is
hard for thee to kick againſt the pricks.
And he, trembling and aſtoniſhed, ſaid,
Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?"
Acts, chap. ix. ver. 3-6. With this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
the epiſtle, chap. i. ver. 15-17:
"When it pleaſed God, who ſeparated me
from my mother's womb, and called me
by his grace to reveal his ſon in me, that
I might preach him among the heathen;
immediately I conferred not with fleſh
and blood, neither went I up to Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
to them that were apoſtles before
me; but I went into Arabia, and returned
again unto Damaſcus."</p>
                  <p>In this quotation from the epiſtle, I deſire
it to be remarked how incidentally it appears,
that the affair paſſed at <hi>Damaſcus.</hi> In what
may be called the direct part of the account,
no mention is made of the place of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
at all; a caſual expreſſion at the
end, and an expreſſion brought in for a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
purpoſe, alone fixes it to have been
at Damaſcus: "I returned again to Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus."
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0539601100:167"/>
Nothing can be more like ſimplicity
and undeſignedneſs than this is. It alſo draws
the agreement between the two quotations
ſomewhat cloſer, to obſerve that they both
ſtate St. Paul to have preached the goſpel
immediately upon his call: "And ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
he preached Chriſt in the ſynagogues,
that he is the ſon of God." Acts, chap. ix.
ver. 20. "When it pleaſed God to reveal
his ſon in me, that I might preach him
among the heathen, immediately I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
not with fleſh and blood." Gal.
chap. i. ver. 15.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The courſe of the apoſtle's travels after
his converſion was this:—He went from Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus
to Jeruſalem, and from Jeruſalem
into Syria and Cilicia. "At Damaſcus the
diſciples took him by night, and let him
down by the wall in a baſket; and when
Saul was come to Jeruſalem, he aſſayed
to join himſelf to the diſciples" (Acts,
chap. ix. ver. 25). Afterwards, "when
the brethren knew the conſpiracy formed
againſt him at Jeruſalem, they brought
him down to Caeſarea, and ſent him forth
to Tarſus, a city in Cilicia" (chap. ix.
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0539601100:168"/>
ver. 30). In the epiſtle, St. Paul gives
the following brief account of his proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
within the ſame period: "After three
years I went up to Jeruſalem to ſee Peter,
and abode with him fifteen days; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
I came into the regions of Syria and
Cilicia." The hiſtory had told us that
Paul paſſed from Caeſarea to Tarſus: if he
took this journey by land, it would carry
him through Syria into Cilicia; and he would
come, after his viſit at Jeruſalem, "into the
regions of Syria and Cilicia," in the very
order in which he mentions them in the
epiſtle. This ſuppoſition of his going from
Caeſarea to Tarſus <hi>by land,</hi> clears up alſo ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
point. It accounts for what St. Paul
ſays in the ſame place concerning the churches
of Judea: "Afterwards I came into the
regions of Syria and Cilicia, and was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
by face unto the churches of Judea,
which were in Chriſt: but they had heard
only that he which perſecuted us in times
paſt, now preacheth the faith, which once
he deſtroyed; and they glorified God in
me." Upon which paſſage I obſerve, firſt,
that what is here ſaid of the churches of
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0539601100:169"/>
Judea, is ſpoken in connection with his
journey into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
Secondly, that the paſſage itſelf has little ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificancy,
and that the <hi>connection</hi> is inexpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable,
unleſs St. Paul went through Judea<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Doddridge thought that the Caeſarea here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned was not the celebrated city of that name upon the Mediterranean ſea, but Caeſarea Philippi, near the borders of Syria, which lies in a much more direct line from Jeruſalem to Tarſus than the other. The objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this, Dr. Benſon remarks, is, that Caeſarea, without any addition, uſually denotes Caeſarea Paleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinae.</note>
(though probably by a haſty journey) at
the time that he came into the regions of
Syria and Cilicia. Suppoſe him to have
paſſed by land from Caeſarea to Tarſus, all
this, as hath been obſerved, would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely
true.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Barnabas was with Paul at Antioch.
"Then departed Barnabas to Tarſus, for to
ſeek Saul; and when he had found him,
he brought him unto Antioch. And it
came to paſs that a whole year they aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
themſelves with the church." Acts,
chap. xi. ver. 25, 26. Again, and upon
another occaſion, "they (Paul and Barnabas)
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0539601100:170"/>
ſailed to Antioch; and there they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
a long time with the diſciples." Chap.
xiv. ver. 26.</p>
                  <p>Now what ſays the epiſtle? "When Peter
was come to Antioch, I withſtood him to
the face, becauſe he was to be blamed;
and the other Jews diſſembled likewiſe
with him; inſomuch that Barnabas alſo
was carried away with their diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion."
Chap. ii. ver. 11. 13.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The ſtated reſidence of the apoſtles was
at Jeruſalem. "At that time there was a
great perſecution againſt the church which
was at Jeruſalem; and they were all ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
abroad throughout the regions of
Judea and Samaria, except the apoſtles"
(Acts, chap. viii. ver. 1). "They (the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
at Antioch) determined that Paul
and Barnabas ſhould go up to Jeruſalem,
unto the apoſtles and elders, about this
queſtion" (Acts, chap. xv. ver. 2). With
theſe accounts agrees the declaration in the
epiſtle: "Neither went I up to Jeruſalem
to them which were apoſtles before me"
(chap. i. ver. 17): for this declaration im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,
or rather aſſumes it to be known, that
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0539601100:171"/>
Jeruſalem was the place where the apoſtles
were to be met with.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. There were at Jeruſalem two apoſtles,
or at the leaſt two eminent members of the
church, of the name of James. This is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
inferred from the Acts of the Apoſtles,
which in the ſecond verſe of the twelfth
chapter relates the death of James, the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of John; and yet in the fifteenth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and in a ſubſequent part of the hiſtory,
records a ſpeech delivered by James in the
aſſembly of the apoſtles and elders. It is
alſo ſtrongly implied by the form of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
uſed in the epiſtle: "Other apoſtles ſaw
I none, ſave James, the <hi>Lord's brother</hi>;"
<hi>i. e.</hi> to diſtinguiſh him from James the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of John.</p>
                  <p>To us who have been long converſant in
the Chriſtian hiſtory, as contained in the
Acts of the Apoſtles, theſe points are obvious
and familiar; nor do we readily apprehend
any greater difficulty in making them appear
in a letter purporting to have been written by
St. Paul, than there is in introducing them into
a modern ſermon. But, to judge correctly of
the argument before us, we muſt diſcharge
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0539601100:172"/>
this knowledge from our thoughts. We muſt
propoſe to ourſelves the ſituation of an
author who ſat down to the writing of the
epiſtle without having ſeen the hiſtory; and
then the concurrences we have deduced will
be deemed of importance. They will at leaſt
be taken for ſeparate confirmations of the
ſeveral facts: and not only of theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
facts, but of the general truth of the
hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>For what is the rule with reſpect to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborative
teſtimony which prevails in courts
of juſtice, and which prevails only becauſe
experience has proved that it is an uſeful
guide to truth? A principal witneſs in a
cauſe delivers his account: his narrative, in
certain parts of it, is confirmed by witneſſes
who are called afterwards. The credit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from their teſtimony belongs not only
to the particular circumſtances in which the
auxiliary witneſſes agree with the principal
witneſs, but in ſome meaſure to the whole
of his evidence; becauſe it is improbable
that accident or fiction ſhould draw a
line which touched upon truth in ſo many
points.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="171" facs="tcp:0539601100:173"/>
In like manner, if two records be produced,
manifeſtly independent, that is, manifeſtly
written without any participation of intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
an agreement between them, even in
few and ſlight circumſtances (eſpecially if,
from the different nature and deſign of the
writings, few points only of agreement, and
thoſe incidental, could be expected to occur)
would add a ſenſible weight to the authority
of both, in every part of their contents.</p>
                  <p>The ſame rule is applicable to hiſtory,
with at leaſt as much reaſon as any other
ſpecies of evidence.</p>

                  <p>But although the references to various par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
in the epiſtle, compared with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
account of the ſame particulars in the
hiſtory, afford a conſiderable proof of the
truth not only of theſe particulars, but of
the narrative which contains them; yet they
do not ſhew, it will be ſaid, that the epiſtle was
written by St. Paul: for admitting (what ſeems
to have been proved) that the writer, whoever
he was, had no recourſe to the Acts of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0539601100:174"/>
yet many of the facts referred to, ſuch as
St. Paul's miraculous converſion, his change
from a virulent perſecutor to an indefatigable
preacher, his labours amongſt the Gentiles,
and his zeal for the liberties of the Gentile
church, were ſo notorious, as to occur rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
to the mind of any Chriſtian, who
ſhould chooſe to perſonate his character, and
counterfeit his name: it was only to write
what every body knew. Now I think that
this ſuppoſition—viz. that the epiſtle was
compoſed upon general information, and the
general publicity of the facts alluded to, and
that the author did no more than weave into
his work what the common fame of the
Chriſtian church had reported to his ears—is
repelled by the particularity of the recitals
and references. This particularity is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
in the following inſtances; in peruſing
which, I deſire the reader to reflect, whether
they exhibit the language of a man who had
nothing but general reputation to proceed
upon, or of a man actually ſpeaking of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and of his own hiſtory, and conſequently
of things concerning which he poſſeſſed a
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0539601100:175"/>
clear, intimate, and circumſtantial know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The hiſtory, in giving an account of
St. Paul after his converſion, relates "that,
after many days," effecting, by the aſſiſtance
of the diſciples, his eſcape from Damaſcus,
"he proceeded to Jeruſalem" (Acts, chap.
ix. ver. 25). The epiſtle, ſpeaking of the
ſame period, makes St. Paul ſay that "he
went into Arabia," that he returned again
to Damaſcus, that after three years he went
up to Jeruſalem. Chap. i. ver. 17, 18.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The hiſtory relates, that, when Saul
was come from Damaſcus, "he was with the
diſciples coming in and going out" (Acts,
chap. ix. ver. 28). The epiſtle, deſcribing
the ſame journey, tells us "that he went
up to Jeruſalem to ſee Peter, and abode
with him fifteen days." Chap. i. ver. 18.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The hiſtory relates, that, when Paul
was come to Jeruſalem, "Barnabas took him
and brought him to the apoſtles" (Acts,
chap. ix. ver. 27). The epiſtle, "that he
ſaw Peter; but other of the apoſtles ſaw
he none, ſave James, the Lord's brother."
Chap. i. ver. 19.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="174" facs="tcp:0539601100:176"/>
Now this is as it ſhould be. The hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
delivers his account in general terms, as
of facts to which he was not preſent. The
perſon who is the ſubject of that account,
when he comes to ſpeak of theſe facts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
particularizes time, names, and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The like notation of places, perſons,
and dates, is met with in the account of
St. Paul's journey to Jeruſalem, given in the
ſecond chapter of the epiſtle. It was four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
years after his converſion; it was in
company with Barnabas and Titus; it was
then that he met with James, Cephas, and
John; it was then alſo that it was agreed
amongſt them, that they ſhould go to the
circumciſion, and he unto the Gentiles.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The diſpute with Peter, which occupies
the ſequel of the ſecond chapter, is marked
with the ſame particularity. It was at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch;
it was after certain came from James;
it was whilſt Barnabas was there, who was
carried away by their diſſimulation. Theſe
examples negative the inſinuation, that the
epiſtle preſents nothing but indefinite allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
to public facts.</p>

                  <p>With this paſſage compare 2 Cor. chap.

(whether in the body I cannot tell, or
whether out of the body I cannot tell;

God knoweth); ſuch a one was caught up
to the third heaven: and I knew ſuch a
man (whether in the body or out of the

that he was caught up into Paradiſe,
and heard unſpeakable words, which it is
not lawful for a man to utter. Of ſuch an
one will I glory, yet of myſelf will I not
glory, but in mine infirmities: for, though
I would deſire to glory, I ſhall not be a

I beſought the Lord thrice, that it might

                  <p>
                     <pb n="177" facs="tcp:0539601100:179"/>
There can be no doubt but that "the
temptation which was in the fleſh," men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the Epiſtle to the Galatians, and
"the thorn in the fleſh, the meſſenger of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
to buffet him," mentioned in the Epiſtle
to the Corinthians, were intended to denote
the ſame thing. Either therefore it was,
what we pretend it to have been, the ſame
perſon in both, alluding, as the occaſion led
him, to ſome bodily infirmity under which
he laboured; that is, we are reading the real
letters of a real apoſtle; or, it was that a
ſophiſt, who had ſeen this circumſtance in
one epiſtle, contrived, for the ſake of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondency,
to bring it into another; or,
laſtly, it was a circumſtance in St. Paul's
perſonal condition, ſuppoſed to be well
known to thoſe into whoſe hands the epiſtle
was likely to fall; and, for that reaſon, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced
into a writing deſigned to bear his
name. I have extracted the quotations at
length, in order to enable the reader to judge
accurately of the manner in which the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this particular comes in, in each; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that judgment, I think, will acquit the
authors of the epiſtle of the charge of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0539601100:180"/>
having ſtudiouſly inſerted it, either with a
view of producing an apparent agreement
between them, or for any other purpoſe
whatever.</p>
                  <p>The context, by which the circumſtance
before us in introduced, is in the two places
totally different, and without any mark of
imitation; yet in both places does the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
riſe aptly and naturally out of the
context, and that context from the train of
thought carried on in the epiſtle.</p>
                  <p>The Epiſtle to the Galatians, from the
beginning to the end, runs in a ſtrain of
angry complaint of their defection from the
apoſtle, and from the principles which he
had taught them. It was very natural to
contraſt, with this conduct, the zeal with
which they had once received him; and it
was not leſs ſo to mention, as a proof of their
former diſpoſition towards him, the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
which, whilſt he was amongſt them,
they had ſhewn to his infirmity: "My
temptation which was in the fleſh ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed
not, nor rejected, but received me
as an angel of God, even as Chriſt Jeſus.
Where is then the bleſſedneſs you ſpake

that if it had been poſſible, ye would
have plucked out your own eyes, and
have given them to me."</p>
                  <p>In the two Epiſtles to the Corinthians,
eſpecially in the ſecond, we have the apoſtle
contending with certain teachers in Corinth,
who had formed a party in that church
againſt him. To vindicate his perſonal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
as well as the dignity and credit of
his miniſtry amongſt them, he takes occaſion
(but not without apologizing repeatedly for
the folly, that is, for the indecorum of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
his own panegyric<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>"Would to God you would bear with me a little in my folly, and indeed bear with me." Chap. xi. ver. 1.</p>

                        <p>"I am become a fool in glorying, ye have compelled me." Chap. xii. ver. 11.</p>
                     </note>) to meet his
adverſaries in their boaſtings: "Wherein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
any is bold (I ſpeak fooliſhly) I
am bold alſo. Are they Hebrews? ſo am
I. Are they Iſraelites? ſo am I. Are they
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0539601100:182"/>
the ſeed of Abraham? ſo am I. Are
they the miniſters of Chriſt? (I ſpeak as a
fool) I am more; in labours more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,
in ſtripes above meaſure, in priſons
more frequent, in deaths oſt." Being thus
led to the ſubject, he goes on, as was natural,
to recount his trials and dangers, his inceſſant
cares and labours in the Chriſtian miſſion.
From the proofs which he had given of his
zeal and activity in the ſervice of Chriſt,
he paſſes (and that with the ſame view of
eſtabliſhing his claim to be conſidered as
"not a whit behind the very chiefeſt of the
apoſtels") to the viſions and revelations
which from time to time had been vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed
to him. And then, by a cloſe and
eaſy connection, comes in the mention of
his inſirmity: "Leſt I ſhould be exalted,"
ſays he, "above meaſure, through the abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of revelations, there was given to me
a thorn in the fleſh, the meſſenger of Satan
to buffet me."</p>
                  <p>Thus then, in both epiſtles, the notice of
his infirmity is ſuited to the place in which
it is found. In the Epiſtle to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,
the train of thought draws up to the

In the epiſtle, it is ſuggeſted by the ſubject

that it is not, in either epiſtle, a circumſtance

                  <p>A reader will be taught to perceive the

                  <p>From theſe ſeveral texts, it is apparent
that the perſecutions which our apoſtle had
undergone, were from the hands or by the
inſtigation of the Jews; that it was not
for preaching Chriſtianity in oppoſition to
heatheniſm, but it was for preaching it as
diſtinct from Judaiſm, that he had brought
upon himſelf the ſufferings which had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
his miniſtry. And this repreſentation
perfectly coincides with that which reſults
from the detail of St. Paul's hiſtory, as deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
in the Acts. At Antioch, in Piſidia, the
"word of the Lord was publiſhed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all the region; but the <hi>Jews ſtirred
up</hi> the devout and honourable women and
the chief men of the city, and raiſed
perſecution againſt Paul and Barnabas,
and expelled them out of their coaſts"
(Acts, chap. xiii. ver. 50). Not long after,
at Iconium, "a great multitude of the Jews
"and alſo of the Greeks believed; but the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0539601100:185"/>
                     <hi>unbelieving Jews</hi> ſtirred up the Gentiles,
and made their minds evil affected againſt
the brethren" (chap. xiv. ver. 1, 2). "At
Lyſtra there came certain Jews from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch
and Iconium, who perſuaded the
people; and having ſtoned Paul, drew him
out of the city, ſuppoſing he had been
dead" (chap. xiv. ver. 19). The ſame
enmity, and from the ſame quarter, our apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
experienced in Greece: "At Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica,
ſome of them (the Jews) believed,
and conſorted with Paul and Silas; and of
the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of
the chief women not a few: but <hi>the Jews
which believed not,</hi> moved with envy, took
unto them certain lewd fellows of the baſer
ſort, and gathered a company, and ſet all
the city in an uproar, and aſſaulted the
houſe of Jaſon, and ſought to bring them
out to the people" (Acts, chap. xvii.
ver. 4, 5). Their perſecutors follow them to
Beraea: "When the <hi>Jews</hi> of Theſſalonica
had knowledge that the word of God was
preached of St. Paul at Beraea, they came
thither alſo, and ſtirred up the people"
(chap. xvii. ver. 13). And laſtly at Corinth,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0539601100:186"/>
when Gallio was deputy of Achaia, "<hi>the
Jews</hi> made inſurrection with one accord
againſt Paul, and brought him to the
judgment-ſeat." I think it does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
that our apoſtle was ever ſet upon by
the Gentiles, unleſs they were firſt ſtirred
up by the Jews, except in two inſtances; in
both which the perſons who began the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault
were immediately intereſted in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion
from the place. Once this happened
at Philippi, after the cure of the Pythoneſs:
"When the maſters ſaw the hope of their
gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas,
and drew them into the market-place unto
the rulers" (chap. xvi. ver. 19). And a
ſecond time at Epheſus, at the inſtance of
Demetrius a ſilverſmith which made ſilver
ſhrines for Diana, "who called together work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

                  <p>I obſerve an agreement in a ſomewhat
peculiar rule of Chriſtian conduct, as laid
down in this epiſtle, and as exemplified in
the ſecond Epiſtle to the Corinthians. It is
not the repetition of the ſame general pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
which would have been a coincidence
of little value; but it is the general pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
in one place, and the application of
that precept to an actual occurrence in the
other. In the ſixth chapter and firſt verſe
of this epiſtle, our apoſtle gives the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
direction: "Brethren, if a man be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
in a fault, ye, which are ſpiritual,
reſtore ſuch a one in the ſpirit of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs."
In 2 Cor. chap. ii. ver. 6-8, he
writes thus: "Sufficient to ſuch a man" (the
inceſtuous perſon mentioned in the firſt
epiſtle) "is this puniſhment, which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
of many; ſo that, contrariwiſe, ye
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0539601100:188"/>
ought rather to forgive him and comfort
him, leſt perhaps ſuch a one ſhould be
ſwallowed up with over-much ſorrow;
wherefore I beſeech you that ye would
confirm your love towards him." I have
little doubt but that it was the ſame mind
which dictated theſe two paſſages.</p>

                  <p>Our epiſtle goes farther than any of St.
Paul's epiſtles; for it avows in direct terms
the ſuperſeſſion of the Jewiſh law, as an
inſtrument of ſalvation, even to the Jews
themſelves. Not only were the Gentiles
exempt from its authority, but even the
Jews were no longer either to place any
dependency upon it, or conſider themſelves
as ſubject to it on a religious account. "Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
faith came, we were kept under the
law, ſhut up unto the faith which ſhould
afterwards be revealed; wherefore the law
was our ſchoolmaſter to bring us unto
Chriſt, that we might be juſtified by faith;
but, after that faith is come, <hi>we are no longer
under a ſchoolmaſter</hi>" (ch. iii. ver. 23-25).</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="187" facs="tcp:0539601100:189"/>
This was undoubtedly ſpoken of Jews
and to Jews. In like manner, chap. iv.
ver. 1-5: "Now I ſay that the heir, as
long as he is a child, differeth nothing
from a ſervant, though he be lord of all;
but is under tutors and governors until the
time appointed of the father: even ſo we,
when we were children, were in bondage
under the elements of the world; but, when
the fulneſs of time was come, God ſent
forth his Son, made of a woman, made
under the law, to <hi>redeem them that were
under the law,</hi> that we might receive the
adoption of ſons." Theſe paſſages are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſhort of a declaration, that the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Jewiſh law, conſidered as a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
diſpenſation, the effects of which were
to take place in another life, had ceaſed,
with reſpect even to the Jews themſelves.
What then ſhould be the conduct of a Jew
(for ſuch St. Paul was) who preached this
doctrine? To be conſiſtent with himſelf,
either he would no longer comply, in his
own perſon, with the directions of the law;
or, if he did comply, it would be for ſome
other reaſon than any conſidence which he
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0539601100:190"/>
placed in its efficacy, as a religious inſtitution.
Now ſo it happens, that whenever St. Paul's
compliance with the Jewiſh law is mentioned
in the hiſtory, it is mentioned in connection
with circumſtances which point out the motive
from which it proceeded; and this motive
appears to have been always exoteric, namely,
a love of order and tranquillity, or an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs
to give unneceſſary offence. Thus,
Acts, chap. xvi. ver. 3: "Him (Timothy)
would Paul have to go forth with him,
and took and circumciſed him, <hi>becauſe of
the Jews which were in thoſe quarters.</hi>"
Again (Acts, chap. xxi. ver. 26), when Paul
conſented to exhibit an example of public
compliance with a Jewiſh rite, by purifying
himſelf in the temple, it is plainly intimat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that he did this to ſatisfy "many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
of Jews who believed, and who were
all zealous of the law." So far the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
related in one book, correſpond with
the doctrine delivered in another.</p>

                  <p>The ſhortneſs of St. Paul's ſtay at Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
is what I deſire the reader to remark.
The direct account of the ſame journey in
the Acts, chap. ix. ver. 28, determines no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
concerning the time of his continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
there: "And he was with them (the
apoſtles) coming in, and going out, at Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem;
and he ſpake boldly in the name
of the Lord Jeſus, and diſputed againſt
the Grecians, but they went about to ſlay
him; which when the brethren knew,
they brought him down to Caeſarea." Or
rather this account, taken by itſelf, would
lead a reader to ſuppoſe that St. Paul's abode
at Jeruſalem had been longer than fifteen
days. But turn to the twenty-ſecond chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Acts, and you will find a reference
to this viſit to Jeruſalem, which plainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicates
that Paul's continuance in that city
had been of ſhort duration: "And it came
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0539601100:192"/>
to paſs, that when I was come again
to Jeruſalem, even while I prayed in the
temple, I was in a trance, and ſaw him
ſaying unto me, Make haſte, get thee
quickly out of Jeruſalem, for they will
not receive thy teſtimony concerning me."
Here we have the general terms of one text

letter I have written unto you with mine
own hand."</p>
                  <p>Theſe words imply that he did not always
write with his own hand; which is conſonant
to what we find intimated in ſome other of
the epiſtles. The Epiſtle to the Romans
was written by Tertius: "I Tertius, who
wrote this epiſtle, ſalute you in the Lord"
(chap. xvi. ver. 22). The firſt Epiſtle to
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0539601100:193"/>
the Corinthians, the Epiſtle to the Coloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,
and the ſecond to the Theſſalonians,
have all, near the concluſion, this clauſe.
"The ſalutation of me, Paul, with mine own
hand;" which muſt be underſtood, and
is univerſally underſtood to import, that the
reſt of the epiſtle was written by another
hand. I do not think it improbable that an
impoſtor, who had remarked this ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in ſome other epiſtle, ſhould invent the
ſame in a forgery; but that is not done
here. The author of this epiſtle does not
imitate the manner of giving St. Paul's ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature;
he only bids the Galatians obſerve
how large a letter he had written to them
with his own hand. He does not ſay this
was different from his ordinary uſage;
that is left to implication. Now to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that this was an artifice to procure cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
to an impoſture, is to ſuppoſe that the
author of the forgery, becauſe he knew that
others of St. Paul's were <hi>not</hi> written by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
therefore made the apoſtle ſay that this
was: which ſeems an odd turn to give to
the circumſtance, and to be given for a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
which would more naturally and more
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0539601100:194"/>
directly have been anſwered, by ſubjoining
the ſalutation or ſignature in the form in
which it is found in other epiſtles<note n="*" place="bottom">The words <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> may probably be meant to deſcribe the character in which he wrote, and not the length of the letter. But this will not alter the truth of our obſervation. I think however, that as St. Paul by the mention of his own hand deſigned to expreſs to the Galatians the great concern which he felt for them, the words, whatever they ſignify, belong to the whole of the epiſtle; and not, as Grotius, after St. Jerom, interprets it, to the few verſes which follow.</note>.</p>

                  <p>An exact conformity appears in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in which a certain apoſtle or eminent
Chriſtian, whoſe name was James, is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of in the epiſtle and in the hiſtory.
Both writings refer to a ſituation of his at
Jeruſalem, ſomewhat different from that of
the other apoſtles; a kind of eminence or
preſidency in the church there, or at leaſt a
more fixed and ſtationary reſidence. Chap.
ii. ver. 12, "When Peter was at Antioch,
before that certain came from James, he
did eat with the Gentiles." This text
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0539601100:195"/>
plainly attributes a kind of pre-eminency to
James; and, as we hear of him twice in the
ſame epiſtle dwelling at Jeruſalem, chap. i.
ver. 19, and ii. 9, we muſt apply it to the
ſituation which he held in that church. In
the Acts of the Apoſtles divers intimations
occur, conveying the ſame idea of James's
ſituation. When Peter was miraculouſly
delivered from priſon, and had ſurpriſed his
friends by his appearance among them,
after declaring unto them how the Lord
had brought him out of priſon, "Go ſhew,"
ſays he, "theſe things unto James, and to
"the brethren" (Acts, chap. xii. ver. 17).
Here James is manifeſtly ſpoken of in terms
of diſtinction. He appears again with like
diſtinction in the twenty-firſt chapter and
the ſeventeenth and eighteenth verſes: "And
when we" (Paul and his company) "were
come to Jeruſalem; the day following, Paul
went in with us unto James, and all the
elders were preſent." In the debate which
took place upon the buſineſs of the Gentile
converts, in the council at Jeruſalem, this
ſame perſon ſeems to have taken the lead.
It was he who cloſed the debate, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0539601100:196"/>
the reſolution in which the council
ultimately concurred: "Wherefore my ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
is, that we trouble not them which
from among the Gentiles are turned to
God."</p>
                  <p>Upon the whole, that there exiſts a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
in the expreſſions uſed concerning
<hi>James,</hi> throughout the hiſtory, and in the
epiſtle, is unqueſtionable. But admitting
this conformity, and admitting alſo the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſignedneſs
of it, what does it prove? It
proves that the circumſtance itſelf is founded
in truth; that is, that James was a real
perſon, who held a ſituation of eminence in
a real ſociety of Chriſtians at Jeruſalem. It
confirms alſo thoſe parts of the narrative
which are connected with this circumſtance.
Suppoſe, for inſtance, the truth of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of Peter's eſcape from priſon was to
be tried upon the teſtimony of a witneſs
who, amongſt other things, made Peter, after
his deliverance, ſay, "Go ſhew theſe things
to James and to the brethren;" would it
not be material, in ſuch a trial, to make out
by other independent proofs, or by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of proofs drawn from independent
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0539601100:197"/>
ſources, that there was actually at that time,
living at Jeruſalem, ſuch a perſon as James;
that this perſon held ſuch a ſituation in the
ſociety amongſt whom theſe things were
tranſacted, as to render the words which
Peter is ſaid to have uſed concerning him,
proper and natural for him to have uſed? If
this would be pertinent in the diſcuſſion of
oral teſtimony, it is ſtill more ſo in appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating
the credit of remote hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>It muſt not be diſſembled that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of our epiſtle with the hiſtory pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
ſome difficulties, or, to ſay the leaſt,
ſome queſtions, of conſiderable magnitude.
It may be doubted, in the firſt place, to what
journey the words which open the ſecond
chapter of the epiſtle, "then, fourteen years
afterwards, I went unto Jeruſalem," relate.
That which beſt correſponds with the date,
and that to which moſt interpreters apply
the paſſage, is the journey of Paul and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas
to Jeruſalem, when they went thither
from Antioch, upon the buſineſs of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
converts; and which journey produced
the famous council and decree recorded in
the fifteenth chapter of Acts. To me this
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0539601100:198"/>
opinion appears to be encumbered with
ſtrong objections. In the epiſtle Paul tells
us that "he went up by revelation" (chap.
ii. ver. 2). In the Acts, we read that he
was ſent by the church of Antioch: "After
no ſmall diſſenſion and diſputation, they
determined that Paul and Barnabas, and
certain other of them, ſhould go up to the
apoſtles and elders about this queſtion"
(Acts, chap. xv. ver. 2). This is not very
reconcileable. In the epiſtle St. Paul writes
that, when he came to Jeruſalem, "he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
that Goſpel which he preached
among the Gentiles, but privately to them
which were of reputation" (chap. ii. ver.
2). If by "that Goſpel" be meant the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
of the Gentile Chriſtians from the
Jewiſh law (and I know not what elſe it
can mean), it is not eaſy to conceive how he
ſhould communicate that privately, which
was the ſubject of his public meſſage. But
a yet greater difficulty remains, viz. that in
the account which the epiſtle gives of what
paſſed upon this viſit at Jeruſalem, no notice
is taken of the deliberation and decree which
are recorded in the Acts, and which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0539601100:199"/>
to that hiſtory, formed the buſineſs
for the ſake of which the journey was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken.
The mention of the council and
of its determination, whilſt the apoſtle was
relating his proceedings at Jeruſalem, could
hardly have been avoided, if in truth the
narrative belong to the ſame journey. To
me it appears more probable that Paul and
Barnabas had taken ſome journey to Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
the mention of which is omitted in the
Acts. Prior to the apoſtolic decree, we read
that "Paul and Barnabas abode at Antioch
a long time with the diſciples" (Acts,
chap. xiv. ver. 28). Is it is unlikely that, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
this long abode, they might go up to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem
and return to Antioch? Or would
the omiſſion of ſuch a journey be unſuitable
to the general brevity with which theſe
memoirs are written, eſpecially of thoſe
parts of St. Paul's hiſtory which took place
before the hiſtorian joined his ſociety?</p>
                  <p>But, again, the firſt account we find in
the Acts of the Apoſtles of St. Paul's viſiting
Galatia, is in the ſixteenth chapter, and the
ſixth verſe: "Now when they had gone
through Phrygia and the region of Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latia,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0539601100:200"/>
they aſſayed to go into Bithynia."
The progreſs here recorded was ſubſequent
to the apoſtolic decree; therefore that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
muſt have been extant when our epiſtle
was written. Now, as the profeſſed deſign
of the epiſtle was to eſtabliſh the exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Gentile converts from the law
of Moſes, and as the decree pronounced
and confirmed that exemption, it may ſeem
extraordinary that no notice whatever is
taken of that determination, nor any appeal
made to its authority. Much however of
the weight of this objection, which applies
alſo to ſome other of St. Paul's epiſtles, is
removed by the following reflections.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It was not St. Paul's manner, nor agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to it, to reſort or defer much to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the other apoſtles, eſpecially whilſt
he was inſiſting, as he does ſtrenuouſly
throughout this epiſtle inſiſt, upon his own
original inſpiration. He who could ſpeak
of the very chiefeſt of the apoſtles in ſuch
terms as the following—"of thoſe who
ſeemed to be ſomewhat (whatſoever they
were it maketh no matter to me, God
accepteth no man's perſon) for they who
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0539601100:201"/>
ſeemed to be ſomewhat in conference
added nothing to me"—he, I ſay, was not
likely to ſupport himſelf by their deciſion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The epiſtle argues the point upon
principle; and it is not perhaps more to be
wondered at, that in ſuch an argument St.
Paul ſhould not cite the apoſtolic decree,
than it would be that, in a diſcourſe deſigned
to prove the moral and religious duty of
obſerving the ſabbath, the writer ſhould not
quote the thirteenth canon.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The decree did not go the length of
the poſition maintained in the epiſtle; the
decree only declares that the apoſtles and
elders at Jeruſalem did not impoſe the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance
of the Moſaic law upon the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
converts, as a condition of their being
admitted into the Chriſtian church. Our
epiſtle argues that the Moſaic inſtitution
itſelf was at an end, as to all effects upon
a future ſtate, even with reſpect to the Jews

                  <p n="4">4. They whoſe error St. Paul combat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
were not perſons who ſubmitted to
the Jewiſh law, becauſe it was impoſed by
the authority, or becauſe it was made part
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0539601100:202"/>
of the law of the Chriſtian church; but they
were perſons who, having already become
Chriſtians, afterwards voluntarily took upon
themſelves the obſervance of the Moſaic
code, under a notion of attaining thereby to
a greater perfection. This, I think, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely
the opinion which St. Paul oppoſes
in this epiſtle. Many of his expreſſions
apply exactly to it: "Are ye ſo fooliſh?
having begun in the ſpirit, are ye now
made perfect in the fleſh?" (chap. iii.
ver. 3). "Tell me, ye that deſire to be
under the law, do ye not hear the law?"
(chap. iv. ver. 21.) "How turn ye again
to the weak and beggarly elements, where-unto
ye deſire again to be in bondage?"
(chap. iv. ver. 9). It cannot be thought
extraordinary that St. Paul ſhould reſiſt this
opinion with earneſtneſs; for it both changed
the character of the Chriſtian diſpenſation,
and derogated expreſsly from the complete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of that redemption which Jeſus Chriſt
had wrought for them that believed in him.
But it was to no purpoſe to alledge to ſuch
perſons the deciſion at Jeruſalem, for that
only ſhewed that they were not bound to
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0539601100:203"/>
theſe obſervances by any law of the Chriſtian
church: they did not pretend to be ſo bound.
Nevertheleſs they imagined that there was an
efficacy in theſe obſervances, a merit, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation
to favour, and a ground of
acceptance with God for thoſe who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
with them. This was a ſituation of
thought to which the tenor of the decree
did not apply. Accordingly, St. Paul's ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
to the Galatians, which is throughout
adapted to this ſituation, runs in a ſtrain
widely different from the language of the
decree: "Chriſt is become of no effect unto
you, whoſoever of you are juſtified by the
law" (chap. v. ver. 4); <hi>i. e.</hi> whoſoever
places his dependance upon any merit he
may apprehend there to be in legal obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances.
The decree had ſaid nothing like
this; therefore it would have been uſeleſs
to have produced the decree in an argument
of which this was the burthen. In like
manner as in contending with an anchorite,
who ſhould inſiſt upon the ſuperior holineſs
of a recluſe, aſcetic life, and the value of
ſuch mortifications in the ſight of God, it
would be to no purpoſe to prove that the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0539601100:204"/>
laws of the church did not require theſe
vows, or even to prove that the laws of the
church expreſsly left every Chriſtian to his
liberty. This would avail little towards
abating his eſtimation of their merit, or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
ſettling the point in controverſy<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>Mr. Locke's ſolution of this difficulty is by no means ſatisfactory. "St. Paul," he ſays, "did not remind the Galatians of the apoſtolic decree, becauſe they already had it." In the firſt place, it does not appear with certainty that they had it; in the ſecond place, if they had it, this was rather a reaſon, than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, for referring them to it. The paſſage in the Acts, from which Mr. Locke concludes that the Galatic churches were in poſſeſſion of the decree, is the fourth verſe of the ſixteenth chapter: "And as they" (Paul and Timothy) "went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apoſtles and elders which were at Jeruſalem." In my opinion, this delivery of the decree was confined to the churches to which St. Paul came, in purſuance of the plan upon which he ſet out, of "viſiting the brethren in every city where he had preached the word of the Lord;" the hiſtory of which progreſs, and of all that pertained to it, is cloſed in the fifth verſe, when the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory informs us that "ſo were the churches eſtabliſhed in the faith, and increaſed in number daily." Then the hiſtory proceeds upon a new ſection of the narrative, by telling us that "when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, they aſſayed to go into Bithynia." The decree itſelf is directed "to the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia;" that is, to churches already found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and in which this queſtion had been ſtirred. And I think the obſervation of the noble author of the Miſcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanea Sacra is not only ingenious, but highly probable, viz. that there is, in this place, a diſlocation of the text, and that the fourth and fifth verſes of the ſixteenth chapter ought to follow the laſt verſe of the fifteenth, ſo as to make the entire paſſage run thus: "And they went through Syria and Cilicia" (to the Chriſtians of which countries the decree was addreſſed), "confirming the churches; and as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apoſtles and elders which were at Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem; and ſo were the churches eſtabliſhed in the faith, and increaſed in number daily." And then the ſixteenth chapter takes up a new and unbroken para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph: "Then came he to Derbe and Lyſtra, &amp;c." When St. Paul came, as he did into Galatia, to preach the goſpel, for the firſt time, in a new place, it is not probable that he would make mention of the decree, or rather letter, of the church of Jeruſalem, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſed Chriſtianity to be known, and which related to certain doubts that had ariſen in ſome eſtabliſhed Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian communities.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond reaſon which Mr. Locke aſſigns for the omiſſion of the decree, viz. "that St. Paul's ſole object in the epiſtle, was to acquit himſelf of the imputátion that had been charged upon him of actually preaching circumciſion," does not appear to me to be ſtrictly true. It was not the ſole object. The epiſtle is written in general oppoſition to the Judaizing inclinations which he found to prevail amongſt his converts. The avowal of his own doctrine, and of his ſteadfaſt adherence to that doctrine, formed a neceſſary part of the deſign of his letter, but was not the whole of it.</p>

                     <pb n="203" facs="tcp:0539601100:205"/>
Another difficulty ariſes from the account
of Peter's conduct towards the Gentile con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
at Antioch, as given in the epiſtle, in
the latter part of the ſecond chapter; which
conduct, it is ſaid, is conſiſtent neither with
the revelation communicated to him, upon
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0539601100:206"/>
the converſion of Cornelius, nor with the
part he took in the debate at Jeruſalem.
But, in order to underſtand either the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
or the ſolution, it will be neceſſary to
ſtate and explain the paſſage itſelf. "When
Peter was come to Antioch, I withſtood
him to the face, becauſe he was to be
blamed; for, before that certain came
from James, he did eat with the Gentiles;
but when they were come, he withdrew
and ſeparated himſelf, fearing them which
were of the circumciſion; and the other
Jews diſſembled likewiſe with him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
that Barnabas alſo was carried
away with their diſſimulation: but when
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0539601100:207"/>
I ſaw they walked not uprightly, according
to the truth of the Goſpel, I ſaid unto
Peter, before them all, If thou, being a
Jew, liveſt after the manner of Gentiles,
and not as do the Jews, why compelleſt
thou the Gentiles to live as do the
Jews?" Now the queſtion that produced
the diſpute to which theſe words relate, was
not whether the Gentiles were capable of
being admitted into the Chriſtian covenant;
that had been fully ſettled: nor was it
whether it ſhould be accounted eſſential to
the profeſſion of Chriſtianity that they ſhould
conform themſelves to the law of Moſes;
that was the queſtion at Jeruſalem: but it
was, whether, upon the Gentiles becoming
Chriſtians, the Jews might thenceforth eat
and drink with them, as with their own bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.
Upon this point St. Peter betrayed
ſome inconſtancy; and ſo he might, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
enough to his hiſtory. He might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the viſion at Joppa as a direction for
the occaſion, rather than as univerſally abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing
the diſtinction between Jew and
Gentile; I do not mean with reſpect to final
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0539601100:208"/>
acceptance with God, but as to the manner
of their living together in ſociety: at leaſt
he might not have comprehended this point
with ſuch clearneſs and certainty, as to ſtand
out upon it againſt the fear of bringing upon
himſelf the cenſure and complaint of his
brethren in the church of Jeruſalem, who
ſtill adhered to their ancient prejudices. But
Peter, it is ſaid, compelled the Gentiles
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>—"why compelleſt thou the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
to live as do the Jews?" How did he do
that? The only way in which Peter appears
to have compelled the Gentiles to comply
with the Jewiſh inſtitution, was by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
himſelf from their ſociety. By
which he may be underſtood to have made
this declaration: "We do not deny your
right to be conſidered as Chriſtians; we
do not deny your title in the promiſes of
the Goſpel, even without compliance with
our law; but if you would have us Jews
live with you, as we do with one another,
that is, if you would in all reſpects be
treated by us as Jews, you muſt live as ſuch
yourſelves." This, I think, was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0539601100:209"/>
which St. Peter's conduct impoſed
upon the Gentiles, and for which St. Paul
reproved him.</p>
                  <p>As to the part which the hiſtorian aſcribes
to St. Peter, in the debate at Jeruſalem, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
that it was a different queſtion which
was there agitated from that which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
the diſpute at Antioch, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to hinder us from ſuppoſing that the
diſpute at Antioch was prior to the conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at Jeruſalem; or that Peter, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of this rebuke, might have afterwards
maintained firmer ſentiments.</p>

                  <p>THIS epiſtle, and the epiſtle to the
Coloſſians, appear to have been tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to their reſpective churches by the
ſame meſſenger: "But that ye alſo may
know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus,
a beloved brother and faithful miniſter in
the Lord, ſhall make known to you all
things; whom I have ſent unto you for
the ſame purpoſe, that ye might know
our affairs, and that he might comfort
your hearts" (Eph. chap. vi. ver. 21, 22).
This text, if it do not expreſsly declare,
clearly I think intimates, that the letter
was ſent by Tychicus. The words made
uſe of in the epiſtle to the Coloſſians are
very ſimilar to theſe, and afford the ſame
implication that Tychicus, in conjunction
with Oneſimus, was the bearer of the letter
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0539601100:211"/>
to that church: "All my ſtate ſhall Tychicus
declare unto you, who is a beloved bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and a faithful miniſter, and fellow
ſervant in the Lord, whom I have ſent
unto you for the ſame purpoſe, that he
might know your eſtate, and comfort your
hearts; with Oneſimus, a faithful and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
brother, who is one of you: they
ſhall make known unto you all things
which are done here" (Coloſ. chap. iv.
ver. 7-9). Both epiſtles repreſent the writer
as under impriſonment for the goſpel; and
both treat of the ſame general ſubject. The
epiſtle therefore to the Epheſians, and the
epiſtle to the Coloſſians, import to be two
letters written by the ſame perſon, at, or
nearly at, the ſame time, and upon the ſame
ſubject, and to have been ſent by the ſame
meſſenger. Now, every thing in the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
order, and diction of the two writings
correſponds with what might be expected
from this circumſtance of identity or cogna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in their original. The leading doctrine
of both epiſtles is the union of Jews and
Gentiles under the Chriſtian diſpenſation;
and that doctrine in both is eſtabliſhed by
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0539601100:212"/>
the ſame arguments, or, more properly ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
illuſtrated by the ſame ſimilitudes<note n="*" place="bottom">St. Paul, I am apt to believe, has been ſometimes accuſed of inconcluſive reaſoning, by our miſtaking that for reaſoning which was only intended for illuſtration.

Taking for granted the certainty of his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, as reſting upon the revelation that had been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to him, he exhibits it frequently to the conception of his readers under images and allegories, in which if an analogy may be perceived, or even ſometimes a poetic reſemblance be found, it is all perhaps that is required.</note>:

any expreſs recollection of what he had

ſome ſentences, in the very order of the

but he will more frequently find himſelf
employing ſome principal terms, with the

partial recollection of phraſes and ſentences,
the intermixture of new terms and new

Therefore, as the church is ſubject unto

                  <p>The paſſages marked by Italics in the quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation

not only in ſignification but in terms,
to the quotation from the Coloſſians. Both the
words and the order of the words are in many
clauſes a duplicate of one another. In the
epiſtle to the Coloſſians, theſe paſſages are
laid together; in that to the Epheſians, they
are divided by intermediate matter, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
by a long digreſſive alluſion to the myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terious
union between Chriſt and his church;
which poſſeſſing, as Mr. Locke hath well
obſerved, the mind of the apoſtle, from
being an incidental thought, grows up into
the principal ſubject. The affinity between
theſe two paſſages in ſignification, in terms,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0539601100:234"/>
and in the order of the words, is cloſer than
can be pointed out between any parts of
any two epiſtles in the volume.</p>
                  <p>If the reader would ſee how the ſame
ſubject is treated by a different hand, and
how diſtinguiſhable it is from the produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the ſame pen, let him turn to the
ſecond and third chapters of the firſt epiſtle
of St. Peter. The duties of ſervants, of
wives and of huſbands, are enlarged upon in
that epiſtle, as they are in the Epiſtle to the
Epheſians; but the ſubjects both occur in a
different order, and the train of ſentiment
ſubjoined to each is totally unlike.</p>
                  <p>3. In two letters iſſuing from the ſame
perſon, nearly at the ſame time, and upon
the ſame general occaſion, we may expect
to trace the influence of aſſociation in the
order in which the topics follow one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Certain ideas univerſally or uſually
ſuggeſt others. Here the order is what we
call natural, and from ſuch an order nothing
can be concluded. But when the order is
arbitrary, yet alike, the concurrence indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
the effect of that principle, by which
ideas, which have been once joined, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0539601100:235"/>
reviſit the thoughts together. The
epiſtles under conſideration furniſh the two
following remarkable inſtances of this ſpecies
of agreement.</p>
                  <p>Epheſ. ch. iv. ver. 24. "And that ye put

created in righteouſneſs and true holineſs;

                     </note>."</p>
                  <p>Coloſ. ch. iii. ver. 9. "Lie not one to
another; ſeeing that ye have put off the

                     </note>."</p>
                  <p>The vice of "lying," or a correction of
that vice, does not ſeem to bear any nearer
relation to the "putting on the new man,"
than a reformation in any other article of
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0539601100:236"/>
morals. Yet theſe two ideas, we ſee, ſtand
in both epiſtles in immediate connection.</p>

It is not neceſſary to purſue the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
between the two epiſtles farther. The
argument which reſults from it ſtands thus:
Now two other epiſtles contain a circumſtance
which indicates that they were written at
the ſame, or nearly at the ſame time. No
two other epiſtles exhibit ſo many marks of
correſpondency and reſemblance. If the
original which we aſcribe to theſe two epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
be the true one, that is, if they were
both really written by St. Paul, and both
ſent to their reſpective deſtination by the
ſame meſſenger, the ſimilitude is, in all
points, what ſhould be expected to take
place. If they were forgeries, then the
mention of Tychicus in both epiſtles, and
in a manner which ſhews that he either
carried or accompanied both epiſtles, was
inſerted for the purpoſe of accounting for
their ſimilitude; or elſe the ſtructure of the
epiſtles was deſignedly adapted to that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance;
or, laſtly, the conformity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the contents of the forgeries, and
what is thus indirectly intimated concerning
their date, was only a happy accident. Not
one of theſe three ſuppoſitions will gain
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0539601100:238"/>
credit with a reader who peruſes the epiſtles
with attention, and who reviews the ſeveral
examples we have pointed out, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations
with which they were accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied.</p>

of the ſame ſound, and oftentimes cauſed
us to reject, on that account, the word which
offered itſelf firſt to our recollection. With
a writer who, like St. Paul, either knew not
theſe rules, or diſregarded them, ſuch words
will not be avoided. The truth is, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of this kind runs through ſeveral
of his epiſtles, and in the epiſtle before us
<hi>abounds</hi>; and that is in the word <hi>riches</hi>

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0539601100:239"/>
of the idea to which it happens
to be ſubjoined. Thus, "the <hi>riches</hi> of his
glory," "his <hi>riches</hi> in glory," "<hi>riches</hi> of the
glory of his inheritance," "<hi>riches</hi> of the
glory of this myſtery," Rom. ch. ix. ver. 23,
Epheſ. ch. iii. ver. 16, Epheſ. ch. i. ver. 18,
Coloſ. ch. i. ver. 27; "<hi>riches</hi> of his grace,"
twice in the Epheſians, ch. i. ver. 7, and ch.

of the wiſdom of God," Rom. ch. xi.
ver. 33; "<hi>riches</hi> of Chriſt," Epheſ. ch. iii.
ver. 8. In a like ſenſe the adjective, Rom.

him;" Epheſ. ch. ii. ver. 4, "<hi>rich</hi> in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;"

in any part of the New Teſtament, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
once in the epiſtle of St. James, ch. ii.

                  <p>There is another ſingularity in St. Paul's
ſtyle, which, wherever it is found, may be
deemed a badge of authenticity; becauſe, if
it were noticed, it would not, I think, be
imitated, inaſmuch as it almoſt always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
embarraſſment and interruption in the

the train of thought then in hand, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
upon a parenthetic ſentence in which
that word is the prevailing term. I ſhall
lay before the reader ſome examples of this,
collected from the other epiſtles, and then
propoſe two examples of it which are found
in the epiſtle to the Epheſians. 2 Cor. ch.
ii. ver. 14, at the word <hi>ſavour</hi>: "Now
thanks be unto God, which always cauſeth
us to triumph in Chriſt, and maketh ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0539601100:241"/>
the <hi>ſavour</hi> of his knowledge by us
in every place (for we are unto God a
ſweet <hi>ſavour</hi> of Chriſt, in them that are
ſaved, and in them that periſh; to the
one we are the <hi>ſavour</hi> of death unto death,
and to the other the <hi>ſavour</hi> of life unto
life; and who is ſufficient for theſe things?)
For we are not as many which corrupt the
word of God, but as of ſincerity, but as
of God; in the ſight of God ſpeak we in
Chriſt." Again, 2 Cor. ch. iii. ver. 1, at
the word <hi>epiſtle</hi>: "Need we, as ſome others,
<hi>epiſtles</hi> of commendation to you, or of
commendation from you? (ye are our
<hi>epiſtle,</hi> written in our hearts, known and
read of all men; foraſmuch as ye are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly
declared to be the <hi>epiſtle</hi> of Chriſt,
miniſtered by us, written not with ink,
but with the ſpirit of the living God; not
in tables of ſtone, but in the fleſhly tables
of the heart." The poſition of the words
in the original, ſhews more ſtrongly than
in the tranſlation that it was the occurrence
of the word <gap reason="foreign">

Again, 2 Cor. ch. iii. ver. 12, &amp;c. at the
word <hi>vail</hi>: "Seeing then that we have ſuch
hope, we uſe great plainneſs of ſpeech:
and not as Moſes, which put a <hi>vail</hi> over
his face, that the children of Iſrael could
not ſtedfaſtly look to the end of that
which is aboliſhed. But their minds were
blinded; for until this day remaineth the
ſame <hi>vail</hi> untaken away in the reading of
the Old Teſtament, which <hi>vail</hi> is done
away in Chriſt; but even unto this day,
when Moſes is read, the <hi>vail</hi> is upon their
heart: nevertheleſs, when it ſhall turn to
the Lord, the <hi>vail</hi> ſhall be taken away
(now the Lord is that ſpirit; and where
the ſpirit of the Lord is, there is liberty).
But we all, with open face, beholding as
in a glaſs the glory of the Lord, are
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0539601100:243"/>
changed into the ſame image from glory
to glory, even as by the ſpirit of the Lord.
Therefore, ſeeing we have this miniſtry, as
we have received mercy, we faint not."</p>
                  <p>Who ſees not that this whole allegory of
the <hi>vail</hi> ariſes entirely out of the occurrence
of the word, in telling us that "Moſes put
a <hi>vail</hi> over his face," and that it drew the
apoſtle away from the proper ſubject of his
diſcourſe, the dignity of the office in which
he was engaged: which ſubject he fetches
up again almoſt in the words, with which
he had left it; "therefore, ſeeing we have
this miniſtry, as we have received mercy,
we faint not?" The ſentence which he
had before been going on with, and in which
he had been interrupted by the <hi>vail,</hi> was,
"ſeeing then that we have ſuch hope, we
uſe great plainneſs of ſpeech."</p>
                  <p>In the epiſtle to the Epheſians, the reader
will remark two inſtances, in which the ſame
habit of compoſition obtains; he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognize
the ſame pen. One he will find,
chap. iv. ver. 8-11, at the word <hi>aſcended</hi>:
"Wherefore he ſaith, When he <hi>aſcended</hi> up
on high, he led captivity captive, and gave
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0539601100:244"/>
gifts unto men. (Now that he <hi>aſcended,</hi>
what is it but that he alſo deſcended firſt
unto the lower parts of the earth? He
that deſcended is the ſame alſo that <hi>aſcended</hi>
up far above all heavens, that he might
fill all things). And he gave ſome, apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,"
&amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The other appears, chap. v. ver. 12-15,
at the word <hi>light</hi>: "For it is a ſhame even
to ſpeak of thoſe things which are done
of them in ſecret: but all things that are
reproved, are made manifeſt by the <hi>light</hi>;
(for whatſoever doth make manifeſt, is
<hi>light</hi>; wherefore he ſaith, Awake, thou
that ſleepeſt, and ariſe from the dead, and
Chriſt ſhall give thee <hi>light</hi>:) ſee then that
ye walk circumſpectly."</p>

                  <p>Although it does not appear to have ever
been diſputed that the epiſtle before us was
written by St. Paul, yet it is well known
that a doubt has long been entertained
concerning the perſons to whom it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed.
The queſtion is founded partly in
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0539601100:245"/>
ſome ambiguity in the external evidence.
Marcion, a heretic of the ſecond century,
as quoted by Tertullian, a father in the
beginning of the third, calls it the epiſtle to
the Laodiceans. From what we know of
Marcion, his judgment is little to be relied
upon; nor is it perfectly clear that Marcion
was rightly underſtood by Tertullian. If,
however, Marcion be brought to prove that
ſome copies in his time gave <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
in the ſuperſcription, his teſtimony, if it be
truly interpreted, is not diminiſhed by his
hereſy; for, as Grotius obſerves, "<hi>cur in eâ
re mentiretur nihil erat cauſae.</hi>" The name
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, in the firſt verſe, upon which
word ſingly depends the proof that the
epiſtle was written to the Epheſians, is not
read in all the manuſcripts now extant. I
admit, however, that the external evidence
preponderates with a manifeſt exceſs on the
ſide of the received reading. The objection
therefore principally ariſes from the contents
of the epiſtle itſelf, which, in many reſpects,
militate with the ſuppoſition that it was
written to the church of Epheſus. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the hiſtory, St. Paul had paſſed two
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0539601100:246"/>
whole years at Epheſus, Acts, chap. xix.
ver. 10. And in this point, viz. of St. Paul
having preached for a conſiderable length of
time at Epheſus, the hiſtory is confirmed by
the two epiſtles to the Corinthians, and by
the two epiſtles to Timothy: "I will tarry
at <hi>Epheſus</hi> until Pentecoſt," 1 Cor. chap. xvi.
ver. 8. "We would not have you ignorant
of our trouble which came to us in <hi>Aſia,</hi>"
2 Cor. chap. i. ver. 8; "As I beſought thee
to abide ſtill at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> when I went into
Macedonia," 1 Tim. chap. i. ver. 3. "And
in how many things he miniſtered to me
at <hi>Epheſus</hi> thou knoweſt well," 2 Tim.
chap. i. ver. 18. I adduce theſe teſtimonies,
becauſe, had it been a competition of credit
between the hiſtory and the epiſtle, I ſhould
have thought myſelf bound to have prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the epiſtle. Now, every epiſtle which
St. Paul wrote to churches, which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
had founded, or which he had viſited,
abounds with references, and appeals to what
had paſſed during the time that he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
amongſt them; whereas there is not a
text in the epiſtle to the Epheſians, from
which we can collect that he had ever been
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0539601100:247"/>
at Epheſus at all. The two epiſtles to the
Corinthians, the epiſtle to the Galatians, the
epiſtle to the Philippians, and the two epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
to the Theſſalonians, are of this claſs;
and they are full of alluſions to the apoſtle's
hiſtory, his reception, and his conduct, whilſt
amongſt them; the total want of which, in
the epiſtle before us, is very difficult to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
for, if it was in truth written to the
church of Epheſus, in which city he had
reſided for ſo long a time. This is the firſt
and ſtrongeſt objection. But farther, the
epiſtle to the Coloſſians was addreſſed to a
church, in which St. Paul had never been.
This we infer from the firſt verſe of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
chapter: "For I would that ye knew
what great conflict I have for you and for
them at Laodicea, and for as many as have
not ſeen my face in the fleſh." There
could be no propriety in thus joining the
Coloſſians and Laodiceans with thoſe "who
had not ſeen his face in the fleſh," if they
did not alſo belong to the ſame deſcription<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Lardner contends againſt the validity of this concluſion; but, I think, without ſucceſs. LARDNER, Vol. XIV. p. 473, edit. 1757.</note>.
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0539601100:248"/>
Now, his addreſs to the Coloſſians, whom
he had not-viſited, is preciſely the ſame as
his addreſs to the Chriſtians, to whom he
wrote in the epiſtle, which we are now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering:
"We give thanks to God and the
Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, praying
always for you, <hi>ſince we heard of your faith</hi>
in Chriſt Jeſus, and of the love which ye
have to all the ſaints," Col. chap. i. ver. 3.
Thus he ſpeaks to the Coloſſians, in the
epiſtle before us, as follows: "Wherefore I
alſo, <hi>after I heard of your faith</hi> in the Lord
Jeſus, and love unto all the ſaints, ceaſe
not to give thanks for you in my prayers,"
chap. i. ver. 15. The terms of this addreſs
are obſervable. The words "having <hi>heard</hi>
of your faith and love," are the very words,
we ſee, which he uſes towards ſtrangers;
and it is not probable that he ſhould em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
the ſame in accoſting a church in which
he had long exerciſed his miniſtry, and whoſe
"faith and love" he muſt have perſonally
known<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Locke endeavours to avoid this difficulty, by explaining "<hi>their faith,</hi> of which St. Paul had heard," to mean the ſteadfaſtneſs of their perſuaſion that they were called into the kingdom of God, without ſubjection to the Moſaic inſtitution. But this interpretation ſeems to me extremely <hi>hard</hi>; for, in the manner in which faith is here joined with love, in the expreſſion, "your faith and love," it could not be meant to denote any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar tenet which diſtinguiſhed one ſet of Chriſtians from others; foraſmuch as the expreſſion deſcribes the general virtues of the Chriſtian profeſſion. Vide LOCKE in loc.</note>. The epiſtle to the Romans was
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0539601100:249"/>
written before St. Paul had been at Rome;
and his addreſs to them runs in the ſame
ſtrain with that juſt now quoted: "I thank
my God, through Jeſus Chriſt, for you
all, that your faith is <hi>ſpoken of</hi> throughout
the whole world," Rom. chap. i. ver. 8.
Let us now ſee what was the form in which
our apoſtle was accuſtomed to introduce his
epiſtles, when he wrote to thoſe with whom
he was already acquainted. To the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians
it was this: "I thank my God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
on your behalf, for the grace of
God which is given you by Chriſt Jeſus,"
1 Cor. chap. i. ver. 4. To the Philippians:
"I thank my God upon every remembrance
of you," Phil. chap. i. ver. 3. To the Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians:
"We give thanks to God always
for you all, making mention of you in
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0539601100:250"/>
our prayers, remembering without ceaſing
your work of faith, and labour of love,"
1 Theſſ. chap. i. ver. 3. To Timothy:
"I thank God, whom I ſerve from my fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
with pure conſcience, that without
ceaſing I have remembrance of thee in
my prayers night and day," 2 Tim. chap.
i. ver. 4. In theſe quotations, it is uſually
his <hi>remembrance,</hi> and never his <hi>hearing</hi> of
them, which he makes the ſubject of his
thankfulneſs to God.</p>
                  <p>As great difficulties ſtand in the way of
ſuppoſing the epiſtle before us to have been
written to the church of Epheſus, ſo I think
it probable that it is actually the epiſtle to
the Laodiceans, referred to in the fourth
chapter of the epiſtle to the Coloſſians. The
text which contains that reference is this:
"When this epiſtle is read among you, cauſe
that it be read alſo in the church of the
Laodiceans, and that ye likewiſe read the
epiſtle from Laodicea," chap. iv. ver. 16.
The "epiſtle <hi>from</hi> Laodicea" was an epiſtle
ſent by St. Paul to that church, and by them
tranſmitted to Coloſſe. The two churches
were mutually to communicate the epiſtles
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0539601100:251"/>
they had received. This is the way in
which the direction is explained by the
greater part of commentators, and is the
moſt probable ſenſe that can be given to it.
It is alſo probable that the epiſtle alluded to
was an epiſtle which had been received by
the church of Laodicea <hi>lately.</hi> It appears
then, with a conſiderable degree of evidence,
that there exiſted an epiſtle of St. Paul's
nearly of the ſame date with the epiſtle to
the Coloſſians, and an epiſtle directed to a
church (for ſuch the church of Laodicea
was) in which St. Paul had never been.
What has been obſerved concerning the
epiſtle before us, ſhews that it anſwers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
to that character.</p>
                  <p>Nor does the miſtake ſeem very difficult
to account for. Whoever inſpects the map
of Aſia Minor will ſee, that a perſon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from Rome to Laodicea would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
land at Epheſus, as the neareſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented
ſea-port in that direction. Might
not Tychicus then, in paſſing through Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,
communicate to the Chriſtians of that
place the letter, with which he was charged?
And might not copies of that letter be mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0539601100:252"/>
and preſerved at Epheſus? Might not
ſome of the copies drop the words of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">And it is remarkable that there ſeem to have been ſome ancient copies without the words of deſignation, either the words <hi>in Epheſus,</hi> or the words <hi>in Laodicea.</hi> St. Baſil, a writer of the fourth century, ſpeaking of the preſent epiſtle, has this very ſingular paſſage: "And writing to the Epheſians, as truly united to him who is through knowledge, he (Paul) calleth them in a peculiar ſenſe <hi>ſuch who are</hi>; ſaying, <hi>to the ſaints who are, and</hi> (or <hi>even</hi>) <hi>the faithful in Chriſt Jeſus</hi>; for ſo thoſe before us have tranſmitted it, and we have found it in ancient copies." Dr. Mill interprets (and, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſome objections that have been made to him, in my opinion rightly interprets) theſe words of Baſil, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring that this father had ſeen certain copies of the epiſtle in which the words "in Epheſus" were wanting. And the paſſage, I think, muſt be conſidered as Baſil's fanciful way of explaining what was really a corrupt and defective reading; for I do not believe it poſſible that the author of the epiſtle could have originally written <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, without any name of place to follow it.</note>, which it was of
no conſequence to an Epheſian to retain?
Might not copies of the letter come out into
the Chriſtian church at large from Epheſus;
and might not this give occaſion to a belief
that the letter was written to that church?
And, laſtly, might not this belief produce
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0539601100:253"/>

and as we have ſeen and acknowledged that
the epiſtle contains no reference to any
tranſaction at Epheſus during the apoſtle's
reſidence in that city, we cannot expect that
it ſhould ſupply many marks of agreement
with the narrative. One coincidence how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

this mode of cuſtody was in uſe amongſt

adopted the priſoner was bound to the ſoldier
by a ſingle chain; in reference to which
St. Paul, in the twentieth verſe of this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
tells the Jews, whom he had aſſembled,
"For this cauſe therefore have I called for

                  <p>If it can be ſuſpected that the writer of

the Acts, had, in this verſe, borrowed the
word, which he read in that book, and had
adapted his expreſſion to what he found
there recorded of St. Paul's treatment at
Rome; in ſhort, that the coincidence here
noted was effected by craft and deſign; I
think it a ſtrong reply to remark, that, in
the parallel paſſage of the epiſtle to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſians,
the ſame alluſion is not preſerved:
the words there are, "praying alſo for us,
that God would open unto us a door of
utterance to ſpeak the myſtery of Chriſt,

preceding number, there can be little doubt
but that theſe two epiſtles were written by
the ſame perſon. If the writer, therefore,
ſought for, and fraudulently inſerted, the
correſpondency into one epiſtle, why did
he not do it in the other? A real priſoner
might uſe either general words, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
this amongſt many other modes
of cuſtody; or might uſe appropriate words
which ſpecified this, and diſtinguiſhed it
from any other mode. It would be acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental
which form of expreſſion he fell upon.
But an impoſtor, who had the art, in one
place, to employ the appropriate term for
the purpoſe of fraud, would have uſed it
in both places.</p>

The account of Epaphroditus, in the
epiſtle to the Philippians, of his journey to
Rome, and of the buſineſs, which brought
him thither, is the article to which I mean
to apply this obſervation. There are three
paſſages in the epiſtle, which relate to this
ſubject. The firſt, chap. i. ver. 7, "Even
as it is meet for me to think this of you
all, becauſe I have you in my heart, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as both in my bonds, and in the
defence and confirmation of the goſpel,

He inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets in the ſame ſenſe the phraſe in the fifth verſe, which our tranſlation renders, "your fellowſhip in the goſpel;" but which in the original is not <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        </gap>.</note>."
Nothing more is ſaid in this
place. In the latter part of the ſecond chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and at the diſtance of half the epiſtle
from the laſt quotation, the ſubject appears
again: "Yet I ſuppoſed it neceſſary to ſend
to you Epaphroditus, my brother and
companion in labour, and fellow ſoldier,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0539601100:259"/>
but your meſſenger, and <hi>he that miniſtered
to my wants</hi>: for he longed after you all,
and was full of heavineſs, becauſe that ye
had heard that he had been ſick: for indeed
he was ſick nigh unto death; but God
had mercy on him, and not on him only,
but on me alſo, leſt I ſhould have ſorrow
upon ſorrow. I ſent him therefore the
more carefully, that when ye ſee him
again ye may rejoice, and that I may be
the leſs ſorrowful. Receive him therefore
in the Lord with all gladneſs; and hold
ſuch in reputation: becauſe for the work
of Chriſt he was nigh unto death, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding
his life <hi>to ſupply your lack of ſervice
toward me.</hi>" Chap. ii. ver. 25-30. The
matter is here dropped, and no farther
mention made of it till it is taken up near
the concluſion of the epiſtle as follows:
"But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that
now at the laſt your care of me hath
flouriſhed again; wherein ye were alſo
careful, but ye lacked opportunity: not
that I ſpeak in reſpect of want; for I have
learned in whatſoever ſtate I am, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to be content. I know both how to
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0539601100:260"/>
be abaſed, and I know how to abound;
every where and in all things I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
both to be full and to be hungry,
both to abound and to ſuffer need. I
can do all things through Chriſt which
ſtrengtheneth me. Notwithſtanding ye
have well done that ye did communicate
with my affliction. Now ye, Philippians,
know alſo that in the beginning of the
goſpel, when I departed from Macedonia,
no church communicated with me as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
giving and receiving, but ye only:
for even in Theſſalonica ye ſent once
and again unto my neceſſity: not becauſe
I deſire a gift; but I deſire fruit that may
abound to your account. But I have all,
and abound; I am full, having received
of Epaphroditus the things which were
ſent from you." Chap. iv. ver. 10-18.
To the Philippian reader, who knew that
contributions were wont to be made in that
church for the apoſtle's ſubſiſtence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
that the ſupply which they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
to ſend to him had been delayed
by the want of opportunity, that Epaphrodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
had undertaken the charge of conveying
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0539601100:261"/>
their liberality to the hands of the apoſtle,
that he had acquitted himſelf of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
at the peril of his life, by haſtening
to Rome under the oppreſſion of a grievous
ſickneſs; to a reader who knew all this
beforehand, every line in the above quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
would be plain and clear. But how
is it with a ſtranger? The knowledge of
theſe ſeveral particulars is neceſſary to the
perception and explanation of the references;
yet that knowledge muſt be gathered from
a compariſon of paſſages lying at a great
diſtance from one another. Texts muſt be
interpreted by texts long ſubſequent to them,
which neceſſarily produces embarraſſment
and ſuſpenſe. The paſſage quoted from the
beginning of the epiſtle contains an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment,
on the part of the apoſtle,
of the liberality which the Philippians had
exerciſed towards him; but the alluſion
is ſo general and indeterminate, that had
nothing more been ſaid in the ſequel of
the epiſtle, it would hardly have been
applied to this occaſion at all. In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
quotation, Epaphroditus is declared
to have "miniſtered to the apoſtle's wants,"
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0539601100:262"/>
and "to have ſupplied their lack of ſervice
towards him:" but <hi>how,</hi> that is, at whoſe
expence, or from what fund, he "miniſtered,"
or what was the "lack of ſervice" which
he ſupplied, are left very much unexplained,
till we arrive at the third quotation, where
we find that Epaphroditus "miniſtered to
St. Paul's wants," only by conveying to
his hands the contributions of the Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians;
"I am full, having received of Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phroditus
the things which were ſent from
you:" and that "the lack of ſervice
which he ſupplied" was a delay or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of their accuſtomed bounty, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
by the want of opportunity; "I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced
in the Lord greatly, that now at
the laſt your care of me hath flouriſhed
again; wherein ye were alſo careful, but ye
lacked opportunity." The affair at length
comes out clear; but it comes out by piece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal.
The clearneſs is the reſult of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal
illuſtration of divided texts. Should
any one chooſe therefore to inſinuate, that
this whole ſtory of Epaphroditus, of his
journey, his errand, his ſickneſs, or even
his exiſtence, might, for what we know,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0539601100:263"/>
have no other foundation than in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of the forger of the epiſtle; I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
that a forger would have ſet forth his
ſtory connectedly, and alſo more fully and
more perſpicuouſly. If the epiſtle be authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic,
and the tranſaction real, then every thing
which is ſaid concerning Epaphroditus and
his commiſſion, would be clear to thoſe into
whoſe hands the epiſtle was expected to
come. Conſidering the Philippians as his
readers, a perſon might naturally write upon
the ſubject, as the author of the epiſtle has
written; but there is no ſuppoſition of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery
with which it will ſuit.</p>

                  <p>The hiſtory of Epaphroditus ſupplies an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
obſervation: "Indeed he was ſick,
nigh unto death; but God had mercy on
him, and not on him only, but on me
alſo, leſt I ſhould have ſorrow upon ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row."
In this paſſage, no intimation is
given that Epaphroditus's recovery was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous.
It is plainly, I think, ſpoken of
as a natural event. This inſtance, together
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0539601100:264"/>
with one in the ſecond epiſtle to Timothy
("Trophimus have I left at Miletum ſick"),
affords a proof that the power of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cures, and, by parity of reaſon, of
working other miracles, was a power which
only viſited the apoſtles occaſionally, and
did not at all depend upon their own will.
Paul undoubtedly would have healed Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phroditus
if he could. Nor, if the power
of working cures had awaited his diſpoſal,
would he have left his fellow traveller at
Miletum ſick. This, I think, is a fair ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
upon the inſtances adduced; but
it is not the obſervation I am concerned
to make. It is more for the purpoſe of my
argument to remark, that forgery, upon
ſuch an occaſion, would not have ſpared a
miracle; much leſs would it have intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
St. Paul profeſſing the utmoſt anxiety
for the ſafety of his friend, yet acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
himſelf unable to help him: which
he does almoſt expreſsly, in the caſe of
Trophimus, for he "left him ſick;" and
virtually in the paſſage before us, in which
he felicitates himſelf upon the recovery of
Epaphroditus, in terms which almoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0539601100:265"/>
the ſuppoſition of any ſupernatural
means being employed to effect it. This

the paſſage, ſo as to mark theſe different pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods,
thus: "Now ye, Philippians, know alſo
that in the beginning of the goſpel, when
I was departed from Macedonia, no church
communicated with me as concerning giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and receiving, but ye only; and that
alſo in Theſſalonica ye ſent once and again
unto my neceſſity." Now with this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of the paſſage compare 2 Cor. chap.
xi. ver. 8, 9: "I robbed other churches,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0539601100:267"/>
taking wages of them to do you ſervice:
and when I was preſent with you and
wanted, I was chargeable to no man; for
that which was lacking to me the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
which came from Macedonia ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied."</p>
                  <p>It appears from St. Paul's hiſtory, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
in the Acts of the Apoſtles, that upon
leaving Macedonia he paſſed, after a very
ſhort ſtay at Athens, into Achaia. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
ſecondly, from the quotation out of
the epiſtle to the Corinthians, that in Achaia
he accepted no pecuniary aſſiſtance from the
converts of that country; but that he drew
a ſupply for his wants from the Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian
Chriſtians. Agreeably whereunto it
appears, in the third place, from the text
which is the ſubject of the preſent number,
that the brethren in Philippi, a city of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia,
had followed him with their muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence,
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, when he
was departed from Macedonia, that is, when
he was <hi>come into Achaia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The paſſage under conſideration affords
another circumſtance of agreement deſerving
of our notice. The gift alluded to in the epiſtle
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0539601100:268"/>
to the Philippians is ſtated to have been
made "in the beginning of the goſpel."
This phraſe is moſt naturally explained to
ſignify the firſt preaching of the goſpel in
theſe parts; viz. on that ſide of the Aegean
ſea. The ſuccours referred to in the epiſtle
to the Corinthians, as received from Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia,
are ſtated to have been received by
him upon his firſt viſit to the peninſula of
Greece. The dates therefore aſſigned to the
donation in the two epiſtles agree; yet is
the date in one aſcertained very incident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
namely, by the conſiderations which
fix the date of the epiſtle itſelf; and in the
other, by an expreſſion ("the beginning of
the goſpel") much too general to have
been uſed, if the text had been penned with
any view to the correſpondency we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marking.</p>
                  <p>Farther, the phraſe, "in the <hi>beginning</hi> of
the goſpel," raiſes an idea in the reader's
mind, that the goſpel had been preached
there more than once. The writer would
hardly have called the viſit to which he
refers the "beginning of the goſpel," if he
had not alſo viſited them in ſome other ſtage
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0539601100:269"/>
of it. The fact correſponds with this idea.
If we conſult the ſixteenth and twentieth
chapters of the Acts, we ſhall find, that St.
Paul, before his impriſonment at Rome,
during which this epiſtle purports to have
been written, had been <hi>twice</hi> in Macedonia,
and each time at Philippi.</p>

               <div n="4" type="section">
                  <head>No. IV.</head>
                  <p>That Timothy had been alongwith St. Paul
at Philippi is a fact which ſeems to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
in this epiſtle twice. Firſt, he joins in
the ſalutation with which the epiſtle opens,
"Paul and Timotheus, the ſervants of Jeſus
Chriſt, to all the ſaints in Chriſt Jeſus which
are at Philippi." Secondly, and more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly,
the point is inferred from what is ſaid
concerning him, chap. ii. ver. 19: "But
I truſt in the Lord Jeſus to ſend Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus
ſhortly unto you, that I alſo may
be of good comfort when I know your
ſtate; for I have no man like minded,
who will naturally care for your ſtate;
for all ſeek their own, not the things
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0539601100:270"/>
which are Jeſus Chriſt's: but <hi>ye know the
proof of him,</hi> that as a ſon with the father,
he hath ſerved with me in the goſpel."
Had Timothy's preſence with St. Paul at
Philippi, when he preached the goſpel there,
been expreſsly remarked in the Acts of the
Apoſtles, this quotation might be thought
to contain a contrived adaptation to the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory;
although, even in that caſe, the aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or rather the alluſion in the epiſtle,
is too oblique to afford much room for ſuch
ſuſpicion. But the truth is, that in the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
of St. Paul's tranſactions at Philippi,
which occupies the greateſt part of the
ſixteenth chapter of the Acts, no mention
is made of Timothy at all. What appears
concerning Timothy in the hiſtory, ſo far
as relates to the preſent ſubject, is this:
"When Paul came to Derbe and Lyſtra,
behold a certain diſciple was there named
Timotheus, whom Paul would have to go
forth with him." The narrative then
proceeds with the account of St. Paul's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
through various provinces of the Leſſer
Aſia, till it brings him down to Troas. At
Troas he was warned in a viſion to paſs
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0539601100:271"/>
over into Macedonia. In obedience to which
he croſſed the Aegean ſea to Samothracia,
the next day to Neapolis, and from thence
to Philippi. His preaching, miracles, and
perfecutions at Philippi follow next; after
which Paul and his company, when they
had paſſed through Amphipolis and Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia,
came to Theſſalonica, and from Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonica
to Beraea. From Beraea the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
ſent away Paul; "but Silas and
"<hi>Timotheus</hi> abode there ſtill." he iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerary,
of which the above is an abſtract,
is undoubtedly ſufficient to ſupport an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
that Timothy was along with St.
Paul at Philippi. We find them ſetting out
together upon this progreſs from Derbe, in
Lycaonia; we find them together, near the
concluſion of it, at Beraea, in Macedonia.
It is highly probable, therefore, that they
came together to Philippi, through which
their route between theſe two places lay.
If this be thought probable, it is ſufficient.
For what I wiſh to be obſerved is, that in
comparing, upon this ſubject, the epiſtle
with the hiſtory, we do not find a recital in
one place of what is related in another;
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0539601100:272"/>
but that we find, what is much more to be
relied upon, an oblique alluſion to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
fact.</p>

                  <head>No. V.</head>
                  <p>Our epiſtle purports to have been written
near the concluſion of St. Paul's impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at Rome, and after a reſidence in that
city of conſiderable duration. Theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
are made out by different inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations,
and the intimations upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
preſerve among themſelves a juſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency,
and a conſiſtency certainly unme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated.
Firſt, the apoſtle had already been
a priſoner at Rome ſo long, as that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of his bonds, and of his conſtancy
under them, had contributed to advance the
ſucceſs of the goſpel: "But I would ye
ſhould underſtand, brethren, that the things
which happened unto me have fallen out
rather unto the furtherance of the goſpel;
ſo that my bonds in Chriſt are manifeſt in
all the palace, and in all other places; and
many of the brethren in the Lord waxing
conſident by my bonds, are much more
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0539601100:273"/>
bold to ſpeak the word without fear."
Secondly, the account given of Epaphrodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
imports, that St. Paul, when he wrote the
epiſtle, had been in Rome a conſiderable
time: "He longed after you all, and was
full of heavineſs, becauſe that ye had
heard that he had been ſick." Epaphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditus
was with St. Paul at Rome. He had
been ſick. The Philippians had heard of his
ſickneſs, and he again had received an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
how much they had been affected by
the intelligence. The paſſing and repaſſing
of theſe advices muſt neceſſarily have occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied
a large portion of time, and muſt have
all taken place during St. Paul's reſidence at
Rome. Thirdly, after a reſidence at Rome
thus proved to have been of conſiderable
duration, he now regards the deciſion of his
fate as nigh at hand. He contemplates ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
alternative, that of his deliverance,
ch. ii. ver. 23, "Him therefore (Timothy) I
hope to ſend <hi>preſently,</hi> ſo ſoon as I ſhall ſee
how it will go with me; but I truſt in the
Lord that I alſo myſelf ſhall come ſhortly:"
that of his condemnation, ver. 17, "Yea, and
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0539601100:274"/>
if I be offered<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, if my blood be poured out as a libation upon the ſacrifice of your faith.</note> upon the ſacrifice and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of your faith, I joy and rejoice with
you all." This conſiſtency is material, if the
conſideration of it be confined to the epiſtle.
It is farther material, as it agrees, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to the duration of St. Paul's firſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment
at Rome, with the account deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
in the Acts, which, having brought
the apoſtle to Rome, cloſes the hiſtory by
telling us "that he dwelt there <hi>two whole
years</hi> in his own hired houſe."</p>

                  <p>With this compare 2 Cor. chap. v. ver. 8.
"We are confident and willing rather to be
abſent from the body, and to be preſent
with the Lord."</p>
                  <p>The ſameneſs of ſentiment in theſe two
quotations is obvious. I rely however not
ſo much upon that, as upon the ſimilitude
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0539601100:275"/>
in the train of thought which in each
epiſtle leads up to this ſentiment, and upon
the ſuitableneſs of that train of thought to
the circumſtances under which the epiſtles
purport to have been written. This, I
conceive, beſpeaks the production of the
ſame mind, and of a mind operating upon
real circumſtances. The ſentiment is in
both places preceded by the contemplation
of imminent perſonal danger. To the
Philippians he writes, in the twentieth
verſe of this chapter, "According to my
earneſt expectation and my hope, that in
nothing I ſhall be aſhamed, but that with
all boldneſs, as always, <hi>ſo now alſo,</hi> Chriſt
ſhall be magnified in my body, whether
it be by life or by death." To the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,
"Troubled on every ſide, yet not
diſtreſſed; perplexed, but not in deſpair;
perſecuted, but not forſaken; caſt down,
but not deſtroyed; always bearing about
in the body the dying of the Lord Jeſus."
This train of reflection is continued to the
place from whence the words which we
compare are taken. The two epiſtles,
though written at different times, from dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0539601100:276"/>
places, and to different churches,
were both written under circumſtances
which would naturally recal to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's
mind the precarious condition of his
life, and the perils which conſtantly await<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him. When the epiſtle to the Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians
was written, the author was a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
at home, expecting his trial. When
the ſecond epiſtle to the Corinthians was
written, he had lately eſcaped a danger in
which he had given himſelf over for loſt.
The epiſtle opens with a recollection of this
ſubject, and the impreſſion accompanied
the writer's thoughts throughout.</p>
                  <p>I know that nothing is eaſier than to
tranſplant into a forged epiſtle a ſentiment
or expreſſion which is found in a true one;
or, ſuppoſing both epiſtles to be forged by
the ſame hand, to inſert the ſame ſentiment
or expreſſion in both. But the difficulty is
to introduce it in juſt and cloſe connection
with the train of thought going before, and
with a train of thought apparently gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
by the circumſtances under which the
epiſtle is written. In two epiſtles, purport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be written on different occaſions,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:0539601100:277"/>
and in different periods of the author's hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
this propriety would not eaſily be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged.</p>

                  <p>With this compare Acts xvi. 22: "And

priſon, and made their feet faſt in the
ſtocks."</p>
                  <p>The paſſage in the epiſtle is very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
I know not an example in any writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a juſter pathos, or which more truly
repreſents the workings of a warm and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate
mind, than what is exhibited in the
quotation before us<note n="*" place="bottom">The original is very ſpirited. <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>.</note>. The apoſtle reminds
his Philippians of their being joined with
himſelf in the endurance of perſecution for
the ſake of Chriſt. He conjures them, by
the ties of their common profeſſion and
their common ſufferings, to "fulfil his joy;"
to complete, by the unity of their faith, and
by their mutual love, that joy with which
the inſtances he had received of their zeal
and attachment had inſpired his breaſt.
Now if this was the real effuſion of St.
Paul's mind, of which it bears the ſtrongeſt
internal character, then we have in the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0539601100:279"/>
words "the ſame conflict which ye ſaw in
me," an authentic confirmation of ſo
much of the apoſtle's hiſtory in the Acts,
as relates to his tranſactions at Philippi;

fidelity of the hiſtorian.</p>

                  <p>THERE is a circumſtance of conformity
between St. Paul's hiſtory and his
letters, eſpecially thoſe which were written
during his firſt impriſonment at Rome,
and more eſpecially the epiſtles to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſians
and Epheſians, which, being too
cloſe to be accounted for from accident,
yet too indirect and latent to be imputed to
deſign, cannot eaſily be reſolved into any
other original than truth. Which circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
is this, that St. Paul in theſe epiſtles
attributes his impriſonment not to his
preaching of Chriſtianity, but to his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting
the right of the Gentiles to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into it without conforming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the Jewiſh law. This was the
doctrine to which he conſidered himſelf as
a martyr. Thus in the epiſtle before us,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0539601100:281"/>
chap. i. ver. 24. (I Paul) "who now rejoice
in my ſufferings for you"—"<hi>for you,</hi>" i.e.
for thoſe whom he had never ſeen; for a
few verſes afterwards he adds, "I would
that ye knew what great conflict I have
for you, and for them in Laodicea, and
for as many as have not ſeen my face
in the fleſh." His ſufferings therefore
for <hi>them</hi> was, in their general capacity of
Gentile Chriſtians, agreeably to what he
explicitly declares in his epiſtle to the
Epheſians, iv. 1. "For this cauſe, I Paul,
the priſoner of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>for you Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi>"
Again in the epiſtle now under
conſideration, iv. 3. "Withal praying
alſo for us, that God would open unto us
a door of utterance to ſpeak the <hi>myſtery</hi>
of Chriſt, for which I am alſo in bonds."
What that "myſtery of Chriſt" was, the
epiſtle to the Epheſians diſtinctly informs
us; "whereby when ye read ye may
underſtand my knowledge in the <hi>myſtery
of Chriſt,</hi> which, in other ages, was not
made known unto the ſons of men, as it
is now revealed unto his holy apoſtles
and prophets by the Spirit, <hi>that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi>
                     <pb n="280" facs="tcp:0539601100:282"/>
                     <hi>ſhould be fellow-heirs, and of the ſame
body, and partakers of his promiſe in Chriſt
by the goſpel.</hi>" This, therefore, was the
<hi>confeſſion</hi> for which he declares himſelf to
be in bonds. Now let us enquire how the
occaſion of St. Paul's impriſonment is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
in the hiſtory. The apoſtle had
not long returned to Jeruſalem from his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
viſit into Greece, when an uproar
was excited in that city by the clamour of
certain Aſiatic Jews, who, "having ſeen
Paul in the temple, ſtirred up all the
people, and laid hands on him." The
charge advanced againſt him was, that "he
taught all men every where againſt the
people, and the law, and this place;
and farther brought Greeks alſo into
the temple, and polluted that holy
place." The former part of the charge
ſeems to point at the doctrine, which he
maintained, of the admiſſion of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
under the new diſpenſation, to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcriminate
participation of God's favour
with the Jews. But what follows makes the
matter clear. When, by the interference
of the chief captain, Paul had been reſcued
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0539601100:283"/>
out of the hands of the populace, and was
permitted to addreſs the multitude who had
followed him to the ſtairs of the caſtle, he
delivered a brief account of his birth, of
the early courſe of his life, of his miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
converſion; and is proceeding in his
narrative, until he comes to deſcribe a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
which was preſented to him, as he
was praying in the temple; and which bid
him depart out of Jeruſalem, "for I will
ſend thee far hence <hi>unto the Gentiles.</hi>" Acts
xxii. 21. "They gave him audience,"
ſays the hiſtorian, "<hi>unto this word</hi>; and
then lift up their voices, and ſaid, Away
with ſuch a fellow from the earth." No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can ſhew more ſtrongly than this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
does, what was the offence which
drew down upon St. Paul the vengeance of
his countrymen. His miſſion to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
and his open avowal of that miſſion,
was the intolerable part of the apoſtle's
crime. But although the real motive of the
proſecution appears to have been the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's
conduct towards the Gentiles; yet,
when his accuſers came before a Roman
magiſtrate, a charge was to be framed of a
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:0539601100:284"/>
more legal form. The profanation of the
temple was the article they choſe to rely
upon. This, therefore, became the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
ſubject of Tertullus's oration before
Felix, and of Paul's defence. But that he
all along conſidered his miniſtry amongſt
the Gentiles as the actual ſource of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
that had been exerciſed againſt him,
and in particular as the cauſe of the inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
in which his perſon had been ſeized,
is apparent from the concluſion of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
before Agrippa: "I have appeared
unto thee," ſays he, deſcribing what paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon his journey to Damaſcus, "for this
purpoſe, to make thee a miniſter and a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
both of theſe things which thou haſt
ſeen, and of thoſe things in the which I
will appear unto thee, delivering thee
from the people and from the Gentiles,
unto whom now I ſend thee, to open
their eyes and to turn them from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to light, and from the power of
Satan unto God, that they may receive
forgiveneſs of ſins, and inheritance among
them which are ſanctified by faith that is
in me. Whereupon, O King Agrippa,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:0539601100:285"/>
I was not diſobedient unto the heavenly
viſion; but ſhewed firſt unto them of
Damaſcus, and of Jeruſalem, and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all the coaſts of Judea, and then to
the Gentiles, that they ſhould repent and
turn to God, and do works meet for
repentance. <hi>For theſe cauſes</hi> the Jews
caught me in the temple, and went about
to kill me." The ſeizing, therefore, of
St. Paul's perſon, from which he was
never diſcharged till his final liberation at
Rome; and of which, therefore, his impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment
at Rome was the continuation and
effect, was not in conſequence of any ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
perſecution ſet on foot againſt Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity;
nor did it befal him ſimply, as
profeſſing or teaching Chriſt's religion,
which James and the elders at Jeruſalem
did as well as he (and yet for any thing
that appears remained at that time unmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted);
but it was diſtinctly and ſpecifically
brought upon him by his activity in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Gentiles, and by his boldly
placing them upon a level with the once<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favoured
and ſtill ſelf-ſlattered poſterity of
Abraham. How well St. Paul's letters,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0539601100:286"/>
purporting to be written during this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment,
agree with this account of

                  <p>Chap. iv. ver. 10. "Ariſtarchus my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-priſoner
ſaluteth you, and Marcus ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's
ſon to Barnabas, touching whom ye
received commandments; if he come
unto you, receive him, and Jeſus, which
is called Juſtus, who are of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion."</p>
                  <p>We find Ariſtarchus as a companion of
our apoſtle in the nineteenth chapter of the
Acts, and the twenty-ninth verſe: "And
the whole city of Epheſus was filled with
confuſion; and having caught Gaius and
<hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> men of Macedonia, <hi>Paul's
companions in travel,</hi> they ruſhed with one
accord into the theatre." And we find him
upon his journey with St. Paul to Rome, in
the twenty-ſeventh chapter, and the ſecond
verſe: "And when it was determined that
we ſhould ſail into Italy, they delivered
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0539601100:287"/>
Paul and certain other priſoners unto one
named Julius, a centurion of Auguſtus's
band; and, entering into a ſhip of Adra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myttium,
we launched, meaning to ſail
by the coaſt of Aſia; one <hi>Ariſtarchus, a
Macedonian of Theſſalonica, being with us.</hi>"
But might not the author of the epiſtle have
conſulted the hiſtory; and, obſerving that
the hiſtorian had brought Ariſtarchus
along with Paul to Rome, might he not for
that reaſon, and without any other ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
have put down his name amongſt
the ſalutations of an epiſtle, purporting to
be written by the apoſtle from that place?
I allow ſo much of poſſibility to this objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that I ſhould not have propoſed this
in the number of coincidences clearly unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned,
had Ariſtarchus ſtood alone. The
obſervation that ſtrikes me in reading the
paſſage is, that together with Ariſtarchus,
whoſe journey to Rome we trace in the
hiſtory, are joined Marcus and Juſtus, of
whoſe coming to Rome the hiſtory ſays
nothing. Ariſtarchus alone appears in the
hiſtory, and Ariſtarchus alone would have
appeared in the epiſtle, if the author had
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0539601100:288"/>
regulated himſelf by that conformity. Or
if you take it the other way; if you ſuppoſe
the hiſtory to have been made out of the
epiſtle, why the journey of Ariſtarchus to
Rome ſhould be recorded, and not that of
Marcus and Juſtus, if the groundwork of
the narrative was the appearance of Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtarchus's
name in the epiſtle, ſeems to be
unaccountable.</p>
                  <p>"Marcus, <hi>ſiſter's ſon</hi> to Barnabas." Does
not this hint account for Barnabas's adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to Mark in the conteſt that aroſe with
our apoſtle concerning him? "And ſome
days after Paul ſaid unto Barnabas, Let us
go again and viſit our brethren in every
city where we have preached the word
of the Lord, and ſee how they do: and
<hi>Barnabas determined to take with them
John, whoſe ſurname was Mark</hi>; but
Paul thought not good to take him with
them, who departed from Pamphylia, and
went not with them to the work; and the
contention was ſo ſharp between them, that
they departed aſunder one from the other;
and ſo Barnabas took Mark and ſailed
unto Cyprus." The hiſtory which records
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:0539601100:289"/>
the diſpute has not preſerved the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of Mark's relationſhip to Barnabas.
It is not where noticed but in the text before
us. As far, therefore, as it applies, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
is certainly undeſigned.</p>
                  <p>"<hi>Siſter's</hi> ſon to Barnabas." This woman,
the mother of Mark, and the ſiſter of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas,
was, as might be expected, a perſon
of ſome eminence amongſt the Chriſtians of
Jeruſalem. It ſo happens that we hear
of her in the hiſtory. "When Peter was
delivered from priſon, he came to the
houſe of <hi>Mary the mother of John, whoſe
ſurname was Mark,</hi> where many were

                  <p>The following coincidence, though it
bear the appearance of great nicety and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinement,
ought not, perhaps, to be deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
imaginary. In the ſalutations with which
this, like moſt of St. Paul's epiſtles, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes,
we have "Ariſtarchus and Marcus,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0539601100:290"/>
and Jeſus, which is called Juſtus, <hi>who
are of the circumciſion</hi>" (iv. 10, 11). Then
follow alſo "Epaphras, Luke the beloved
phyſician, and Demas." Now as this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription,
"who are of the circumciſion," is
added after the three firſt names, it is inferred,
not without great appearance of probability,
that the reſt, amongſt whom is Luke, were
not of the circumciſion. Now can we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
any expreſſion in the Acts of the
Apoſtles, which aſcertains whether the
author of the book was a Jew or not? If
we can diſcover that he was not a Jew, we
fix a circumſtance in his character, which
coincides with what is here, indirectly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
but not very uncertainly, intimated
concerning Luke: and we ſo far confirm
both the teſtimony of the primitive church,
that the Acts of the Apoſtles was written
by St. Luke, and the general reality of the
perſons and circumſtances brought toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in this epiſtle. The text in the Acts,
which has been conſtrued to ſhew that the
writer was not a Jew, is the nineteenth
verſe of the firſt chapter, where, in deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the field which had been purchaſed with
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0539601100:291"/>
the reward of Judas's iniquity, it is ſaid,
"that it was known unto all the dwellers
at Jeruſalem; inſomuch as that field is
called, in <hi>their</hi> proper tongue, Aceldama,
that is to ſay, the field of blood." Theſe
words are by moſt commentators taken to be
the words and obſervation of the hiſtorian,
and not a part of St. Peter's ſpeech, in the
midſt of which they are found. If this be
admitted, then it is argued that the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
"in <hi>their</hi> proper tongue," would not
have been uſed by a Jew, but is ſuitable to
the pen of a Gentile writing concerning
Jews<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide Benſon's Diſſertation, vol. i. p. 318 of his works, Ed. 1756.</note>. The reader will judge of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
of this concluſion, and we urge
the coincidence no farther than that proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
extends. The coincidence, if it be
one, is ſo remote from all poſſibility of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
that nothing need be added to ſatisfy
the reader upon that part of the argument.</p>

                  <p>Obſerve how it may be made out that
Oneſimus was a Coloſſian. Turn to the
epiſtle to Philemon, and you will find that
Oneſimus was the ſervant or ſlave of Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.
The queſtion therefore will be to
what city Philemon belonged. In the
epiſtle addreſſed to him this is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.
It appears only that he was of the
ſame place, whatever that place was, with
an eminent chriſtian named Archippus.
"Paul, a priſoner of Jeſus Chriſt, and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy
our brother, unto Philemon our
dearly beloved and fellow-labourer; and to
our beloved Apphia, and <hi>Archippus</hi> our
fellow-ſoldier, and to the church in thy
houſe." Now turn back to the epiſtle to
the Coloſſians, and you will find Archippus
ſaluted by name amongſt the Chriſtians of
that church. "Say to Archippus, take
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0539601100:293"/>
heed to the miniſtry which thou haſt
received in the Lord that thou fulſil it"
(iv. 17). The neceſſary reſult is, that
Oneſimus alſo was of the ſame city, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
to what is ſaid of him, "he is one of
you." And this reſult is the effect, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of truth which produces conſiſtency
without the writer's thought or care, or of
a contexture of forgeries confirming and
falling in with one another by a ſpecies of
fortuity of which I know no example.
The ſuppoſition of deſign, I think, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
not only becauſe the purpoſe to
which the deſign muſt have been directed,

"he is one of you," is a purpoſe
which would be loſt upon ninety-nine

ſpeaks of the coming of Chriſt in terms

Whatever other conſtruction theſe texts
may <hi>bear,</hi> the idea they leave upon the
mind of an ordinary reader, is that of the
author of the epiſtle looking for the day of
judgment to take place in his own time, or
near to it. Now the uſe which I make of this
circumſtance, is to deduce from it a proof
that the epiſtle itſelf was not the production
of a ſubſequent age. Would an impoſtor
have given this expectation to St. Paul, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
experience had proved it to be erroneous?
or would he have put into the apoſtle's
mouth, or, which is the ſame thing, into writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
purporting to come from his hand, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
if not neceſſarily conveying, at
leaſt eaſily interpreted to convey, an opinion
which was then known to be founded in
miſtake? I ſtate this as an argument to
ſhew that the epiſtle was cotemporary with
St. Paul, which is little leſs than to ſhew
that it actually proceeded from his pen.
For I queſtion whether any ancient forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
were executed in the life-time of the
perſon whoſe name they bear; nor was the
primitive ſituation of the church likely to
give birth to ſuch an attempt.</p>

                  <p>Our epiſtle concludes with a direction,
that it ſhould be publickly read in the church
to which it was addreſſed: "I charge
you by the Lord, that this epiſtle be read
unto all the holy brethren." The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence
of this clauſe in the body of the
epiſtle is an evidence of its authenticity;
becauſe to produce a letter purporting to
have been publickly read in the church of
Theſſalonica, when no ſuch letter in truth
had been read or heard of in that church,
would be to produce an impoſture deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of itſelf. At leaſt, it ſeems unlikely
that the author of an impoſture would vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily,
and even officiouſly, afford a handle
to ſo plain an objection. Either the epiſtle
was publickly read in the church of Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonica
during St. Paul's life-time, or it was
not. If it was, no publication could be
more authentic, no ſpecies of notoriety more
unqueſtionable, no method of preſerving the
integrity of the copy more ſecure. If it
was not, the clauſe we produce would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main

a ſtanding condemnation of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery,

                  <p>If we connect this article with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding,

of the epiſtle. The preceding article
carries up the date of the epiſtle to the time
of St. Paul; the preſent article ſixes the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication

Either therefore the church of Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica
was impoſed upon by a falſe epiſtle,
which in St. Paul's life-time they received
and read publickly as his, carrying on a
communication with him all the while, and
the epiſtle referring to the continuance of

received an epiſtle purporting to have
been publickly read in the church of Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonica,

                  <p>Between our epiſtle and the hiſtory the
accordancy in many points is circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
and complete. The hiſtory relates,
that, after Paul and Silas had been beaten
with many ſtripes at Philippi, ſhut up in the
inner priſon, and their feet made faſt in
the ſtocks, as ſoon as they were diſcharged
from their conſinement they departed from
thence, and, when they had paſſed through
Amphipolis and Apollonia, came to Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonica,
where Paul opened and alledged
that Jeſus was the Chriſt, Acts xvi. 23, &amp;c.
The epiſtle written in the name of Paul and
Sylvanus (Silas), and of Timotheus, who
alſo appears to have been along with them
at Philippi, (vide Phil. No. iv.) ſpeaks to the
church of Theſſalonica thus: "Even after
that we had ſuffered before, and were
ſhamefully entreated, as ye know, at
Philippi, we were bold in our God to
ſpeak unto you the goſpel of God with
much contention" (ii. 21).</p>
                  <p>The hiſtory relates, that after they had
been ſome time at Theſſalonica, "the
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:0539601100:300"/>
Jews who believed not ſet all the city
in an uproar, and aſſaulted the houſe of
Jaſon where Paul and Silas were, and
ſought to bring them out to the people."
Acts xvii. 5. The epiſtle declares, "when
we were with you, we told you before
that we ſhould ſuffer tribulation; even
<hi>as it came to paſs, and ye know</hi>" (iii. 4).</p>
                  <p>The hiſtory brings Paul and Silas and
Timothy together at Corinth, ſoon after the
preaching of the goſpel at Theſſalonica:
"And when Silas and Timotheus were come
from Macedonia (to Corinth), Paul was
preſſed in ſpirit." Acts xviii. 5. The
epiſtle is written in the name of theſe
three perſons, who conſequently muſt have
been together at the time, and ſpeaks
throughout of their miniſtry at Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonica
as a recent tranſaction: "We, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<hi>being taken from you for a ſhort
time,</hi> in preſence not in heart, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the more abundantly to ſee your face
with great deſire" (ii. 17).</p>
                  <p>The harmony is indubitable; but the
points of hiſtory in which it conſiſts, are
ſo expreſsly ſet ſorth in the narrative, and
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:0539601100:301"/>
ſo directly referred to in the epiſtle, that it
becomes neceſſary for us to ſhew, that the
facts in one writing were not copied from
the other. Now amidſt ſome minuter diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepancies,
which will be noticed below,
there is one circumſtance which mixes it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with all the alluſions in the epiſtle, but
does not appear in the hiſtory any where;
and that is of a viſit which St. Paul had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to pay to the Theſſalonians during
the time of his reſiding at Corinth: "Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we would have come unto you
(even I Paul) once and again, but Satan
hindered us" (ii. 18). "Night and
day praying exceedingly that we might
ſee your face, and might perfect that
which is lacking in your faith. Now
God himſelf and our Father, and our
Lord Jeſus Chriſt, direct our way unto
you" (iii. 10, 11). Concerning a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
which was not executed, although the
perſon himſelf, who was conſcious of his
own purpoſe, ſhould make mention in his
letters, nothing is more probable than that
his hiſtorian ſhould be ſilent, if not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.
The author of the epiſtle could not
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:0539601100:302"/>
however have learnt this circumſtance from
the hiſtory, for it is not there to be met
with; nor, if the hiſtorian had drawn his
materials from the epiſtle, is it likely that he
would have paſſed over a circumſtance,
which is amongſt the moſt obvious and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
of the facts to be collected from that
ſource of information.</p>

                  <p>Chap. iii. 1-7. "Wherefore when we
could no longer forbear, we thought it
good <hi>to be left at Athens alone,</hi> and ſent
Timotheus, our brother and miniſter of
God, to eſtabliſh you, and to comfort you
concerning your faith:—but now when
Timotheus came from you unto us, and
brought us good tidings of your faith and
charity, we were comforted over you in
all our affliction and diſtreſs by your
faith."</p>
                  <p>The hiſtory relates, that when Paul came
out of Macedonia to Athens, Silas and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy
ſtaid behind at Beraea: "The bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
ſent away Paul to go as it were to
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:0539601100:303"/>
the ſea; but Silas and Timotheus abode
there ſtill: and they that conducted Paul
brought him to Athens," Acts, ch. xvii.
ver. 14, 15. The hiſtory farther relates, that
after Paul had tarried ſome time at Athens,
and had proceeded from thence to Corinth,
whilſt he was exerciſing his miniſtry in that
city, Silas and Timothy came to him from
Macedonia, Acts, ch. xviii. ver. 5. But to
reconcile the hiſtory with the clauſe in the
epiſtle which makes St. Paul ſay, "I thought
it good to be left at Athens alone, and to
ſend Timothy unto you," it is neceſſary
to ſuppoſe that Timothy had come up with
St. Paul at Athens; a circumſtance which
the hiſtory does not mention. I remark
therefore, that, although the hiſtory do not
expreſsly notice this arrival, yet it contains
intimations which render it extremely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
that the fact took place. Firſt, as
ſoon as Paul had reached Athens, he ſent a
meſſage back to Silas and Timothy "for
to come to him with all ſpeed." Acts,
chap. xvii. ver. 15. Secondly, his ſtay at
Athens was on purpoſe that they might join
him there: "Now whilſt Paul <hi>waited for</hi>
                     <pb n="302" facs="tcp:0539601100:304"/>
                     <hi>them at Athens,</hi> his ſpirit was ſtirred in
him" Acts, ch. xvii. ver. 16. Thirdly,
his departure from Athens does not appear
to have been in any ſort haſtened or abrupt.
It is ſaid, "after theſe things," viz. his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
with the Jews, his conferences
with the philoſophers, his diſcourſe at Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opagus,
and the gaining of ſome converts,
"he departed from Athens and came to
Corinth." It is not hinted that he quitted
Athens before the time that he had intended
to leave it; it is not ſuggeſted that he
was driven from thence, as he was from
many cities, by tumults or perſecutions,
or becauſe his life was no longer ſafe.
Obſerve then the particulars which the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
<hi>does</hi> notice—that Paul had ordered Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy
to follow him without delay, that
he waited at Athens on purpoſe that Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy
might come up with him, that he
ſtaid there as long as his own choice led
him to continue. Laying theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
which the hiſtory does diſcloſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
it is highly probable that Timothy
came to the apoſtle at Athens, a fact which
the epiſtle, we have ſeen, virtually aſſerts,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:0539601100:305"/>
when it makes Paul ſend Timothy back
from Athens to Theſſalonica. The <hi>ſending
back of Timothy into Macedonia</hi> accounts
alſo for his not coming to Corinth till after
Paul had been fixed in that city for ſome
conſiderable time. Paul had found out
Aquila and Priſcilla, abode with them and
wrought, being of the ſame craft; and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned
in the ſynagogue every ſabbath-day,
and perſuaded the Jews and the Greeks.
Acts, ch. xviii. ver. 1-5. All this paſſed
at Corinth before Silas and Timotheus were
come from Macedonia. Acts, ch. xviii. ver. 5.
If this was the firſt time of their coming up
with him after their ſeparation at Beraea,
there is nothing to account for a delay ſo
contrary to what appears from the hiſtory
itſelf to have been St. Paul's plan and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation.
This is a conformity of a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
ſpecies. The epiſtle diſcloſes a fact
which is not preſerved in the hiſtory; but
which makes what is ſaid in the hiſtory
more ſignificant, probable, and conſiſtent.
The hiſtory bears marks of an omiſſion;
the epiſtle by reference furniſhes a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
which ſupplies that omiſſion.</p>

followers of the churches of God
which in Judea are in Chriſt Jeſus; for ye
alſo have ſuffered like things <hi>of your own
countrymen,</hi> even as they have of the
Jews."</p>
                  <p>To a reader of the Acts of the Apoſtles,
it might ſeem, at firſt ſight, that the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions
which the preachers and converts
of Chriſtianity underwent, were ſuffered at
the hands of their old adverſaries the Jews.
But, if we attend carefully to the accounts
there delivered, we ſhall obſerve, that,
though the oppoſition made to the goſpel
uſually <hi>originated</hi> from the enmity of the
Jews, yet in almoſt all places the Jews
went about to accompliſh their purpoſe, by
ſtirring up the Gentile inhabitants againſt
their converted countrymen. Out of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea
they had not power to do much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
in any other way. This was the caſe
at Theſſalonica in particular: "The Jews
which believed not, moved with envy, ſet
all the city in an uproar." Acts, ch. xvii.
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:0539601100:307"/>
ver. 5. It was the ſame a ſhort time after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
at Beraea: "When the Jews of
Theſſalonica had knowledge that the
word of God was preached of Paul at Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raea,
they came thither alſo, and ſtirred
up the people." Acts, ch. xvii. ver. 13.
And before this our apoſtle had met with a
like ſpecies of perſecution, in his progreſs
through the leſſer Aſia: "In every city the
unbelieving Jews ſtirred up the Gentiles,
and made their minds evil affected againſt
the brethren." Acts, ch. xiv. ver. 2. The
epiſtle therefore repreſents the caſe accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
as the hiſtory ſtates it. It was the
Jews always who ſet on foot the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
againſt the apoſtles and their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
He ſpeaks truly therefore of them,
when he ſays in this epiſtle, "they both
killed the Lord Jeſus and their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
and have <hi>perſecuted us</hi>—forbidding
us to ſpeak unto the Gentiles" (ii. 15,
16). But out of Judea it was at the hands
of the Gentiles, it was "of their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen,"
that the injuries they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went
were immediately ſuſtained: "Ye have
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:0539601100:308"/>

for ſome conſiderable time; yet of
St. Paul's miniſtry in that city, the hiſtory
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:0539601100:309"/>
gives no other account than the following:
"that he came to Theſſalonica, where was
a ſynagogue of the Jews; that, as his
manner was, he went in unto them, and
<hi>three ſabbath-days</hi> reaſoned with them out
of the ſcriptures; that ſome of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
and conſorted with Paul and Silas."
The hiſtory then proceeds to tell us, that
the Jews which believed not ſet the city in
an uproar, and aſſaulted the houſe of Jaſon,
where Paul and his companions lodged;
that the conſequence of this outrage was,
that "the brethren immediately ſent away
Paul and Silas by night unto Beraea."
Acts, ch. xvii. ver. 1-10. From the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his preaching three ſabbath-days in
the Jewiſh ſynagogue, and from the want
of any farther ſpecification of his miniſtry,
it has uſually been taken for granted that
Paul did not continue at Theſſalonica more
than three weeks. This, however, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
without neceſſity. It appears to have
been St. Paul's practice, in almoſt every
place that he came to, upon his firſt arrival
to repair to the ſynagogue. He thought
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:0539601100:310"/>
himſelf bound to propoſe the goſpel to the
Jews <hi>firſt,</hi> agreeably to what he declared
at Antioch in Piſidia; "it was neceſſary
that the word of God ſhould firſt have
been ſpoken to you." Acts, ch. xiii.
ver. 46. If the Jews rejected his miniſtry,
he quitted the ſynagogue, and betook him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to a Gentile audience. At Corinth, upon
his firſt coming thither, he reaſoned in the
ſynagogue every ſabbath; "but when the
Jews oppoſed themſelves, and blaſphemed,
he departed thence," expreſsly telling
them, "from henceforth I will go unto the
Gentiles; and he remained in that city a
year and ſix months." Acts, ch. xviii.
ver. 6-11. At Epheſus, in like manner,
for the ſpace of three months he went into
the ſynagogue; but, "when divers were
hardened and believed not, but ſpake evil
of that way, he departed from them and
ſeparated the diſciples, diſputing daily in
the ſchool of one Tyrannus; and this
continued by the ſpace of two years."
Acts, ch. xix. ver. 9, 10. Upon inſpecting
the hiſtory, I ſee nothing in it which nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:0539601100:311"/>
the ſuppoſition, that St. Paul purſued
the ſame plan at Theſſalonica which he
adopted in other places; and that, though
he reſorted to the ſynagogue only three ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-days,
yet he remained in the city, and
in the exerciſe of his miniſtry amongſt the
Gentile citizens, much longer; and until the
ſucceſs of his preaching had provoked the
Jews to excite the tumult and inſurrection
by which he was driven away.</p>
                  <p>Another ſeeming diſcrepancy is found in
the ninth verſe of the firſt chapter of the
epiſtle: "For they themſelves ſhow of us
what manner of entering in we had unto
you, and how <hi>ye turned to God from idols</hi>
to ſerve the living and true God." This
text contains an aſſertion, that, by means of
St. Paul's miniſtry at Theſſalonica, many
idolatrous Gentiles had been brought over to
Chriſtianity. Yet the hiſtory, in deſcribing
the effects of that miniſtry, only ſays, that
"ſome of the Jews believed, and of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
Greeks a great multitude, and of the
chief women not a few" (ch. xvii. ver. 4).
The devout Greeks were thoſe who already
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:0539601100:312"/>
worſhipped the one true God; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
could not be ſaid, by embracing Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
"to be turned to God from idols."</p>
                  <p>This is the difficulty. The anſwer may
be aſſiſted by the following obſervations.

Or, after all, if we be not allowed to change
the preſent reading, which is undoubtedly
retained by a great plurality of copies, may
not the paſſage in the hiſtory be conſidered
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:0539601100:313"/>
as deſcribing only the effects of St. Paul's
diſcourſes during the three ſabbath-days in
which he preached in the ſynagogue? and
may it not be true, as we have remarked

                  <p>IT may ſeem odd to alledge obſcurity it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
as an argument, or to draw a proof
in favour of a writing, from that which is
uſually conſidered as the principal defect in
its compoſition. The preſent epiſtle, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
furniſhes a paſſage, hitherto unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained,
and probably inexplicable by us,
the exiſtence of which, under the darkneſs
and difficulties that attend it, can only be
accounted for upon the ſuppoſition of the
epiſtle being genuine; and upon that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
is accounted for with great eaſe.
The paſſage which I allude to is found in
the ſecond chapter: "that day ſhall not
come, except there come a falling away
firſt, and that man of ſin be revealed, the
ſon of perdition, who oppoſeth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alteth
himſelf above all that is called God,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0539601100:315"/>
or that is worſhipped; ſo that he as God
ſitteth in the temple of God, ſhewing
himſelf that he is God. Remember ye not,
that WHEN I WAS YET WITH YOU I TOLD
YOU THESE THINGS? <hi>And now ye know
what withholdeth, that he might be revealed
in his time</hi>; for the myſtery of iniquity doth
already work, <hi>only he that now letteth will
let, until he be taken out of the way</hi>; and
then ſhall that wicked be revealed, whom
the Lord ſhall conſume with the ſpirit of
his mouth, and ſhall deſtroy with the
brightneſs of his coming." It were ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous
to prove, becauſe it is in vain to
deny, that this paſſage is involved in great
obſcurity, more eſpecially the clauſes diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
by Italics. Now the obſervation I
have to offer is founded upon this, that the
paſſage expreſsly refers to a converſation
which the author had previouſly holden
with the Theſſalonians upon the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:
"Remember ye not, that when I was
yet with you <hi>I told you theſe things? And
now ye know</hi> what withholdeth." If ſuch
converſation actually paſſed; if, whilſt he
was yet with them, "he <hi>told</hi> them thoſe
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:0539601100:316"/>
things," then it follows that the epiſtle is
authentic. And of the reality of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
it appears to be a proof, that what
is ſaid in the epiſtle might be underſtood by
thoſe who had been preſent to ſuch conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
and yet be incapable of being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
by any other. No man writes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligibly
on purpoſe. But it may eaſily
happen, that a part of a letter which relates
to a ſubject, upon which the parties had
converſed together before, which refers to
what had been before <hi>ſaid,</hi> which is in
truth a portion or continuation of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
diſcourſe, may be utterly without
meaning to a ſtranger, who ſhould pick up
the letter upon the road, and yet be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
clear to the perſon to whom it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
and with whom the previous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
had paſſed. And if, in a letter
which thus accidentally fell into my hands,
I found a paſſage expreſsly referring to a
former converſation, and difficult to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
without knowing that converſation,
I ſhould conſider this very difficulty as a
proof that the converſation had actually
paſſed, and conſequently that the letter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:0539601100:317"/>
the real correſpondence of real per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>

                  <p>In a letter, purporting to have been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to another of the Macedonic churches,
we find the following declaration:</p>
                  <p>"Now ye, Philippians, know alſo that in
the beginning of the goſpel, when I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from Macedonia, <hi>no church commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
with me as concerning giving and
receiving, but ye only.</hi>"</p>
                  <p>The conformity between theſe two paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
is ſtrong and plain. They confine the
tranſaction to the ſame period. The epiſtle
to the Philippians refers to what paſſed "in
the beginning of the goſpel," that is to ſay,
during the firſt preaching of the goſpel on
that ſide of the Aegean ſea. The epiſtle to
the Theſſalonians ſpeaks of the apoſtle's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:0539601100:318"/>
in that city upon "his firſt entrance in
unto them," which the hiſtory informs us
was in the courſe of his firſt viſit to the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſula
of Greece.</p>
                  <p>As St. Paul tells the Philippians, "that
no church communicated with him, as
concerning giving and receiving, but they
only," he could not, conſiſtently with the
truth of this declaration, have received any
thing from the neighbouring church of
Theſſalonica. What thus appears by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
implication in an epiſtle to another
church, when he writes to the Theſſalonians
themſelves, is noticed expreſsly and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly:
"neither did we eat any man's
bread for nought, but wrought night and
day, that we might not be chargeable to
any of you."</p>
                  <p>The texts here cited farther alſo exhibit
a mark of conformity with what St. Paul is
made to ſay of himſelf in the Acts of the
Apoſtles. The apoſtle not only reminds
the Theſſalonians that he had not been
chargeable to any of them, but he ſtates
likewiſe the motive which dictated this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve;
"not becauſe we have not power, but
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:0539601100:319"/>
to make ourſelves an enſample unto you
to follow us" (chap. iii. ver. 9). This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
and what is much more preciſe, the
end which he had in view by it, was the
very ſame as that which the hiſtory attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
to St. Paul in a diſcourſe, whichit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents
him to have addreſſed to the elders
of the church of Epheſus: "Yea, ye your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
alſo know that theſe hands have
miniſtered unto my neceſſities, and to them
that were with me. I have <hi>ſhowed</hi> you
all things, how <hi>that ſo labouring ye ought
to ſupport the weak.</hi>" Acts, ch. xx. ver. 34.
The ſentiment in the epiſtle and in the
ſpeech is in both parts of it ſo much alike,
and yet the words which convey it ſhow ſo
little of imitation or even of reſemblance,
that the agreement cannot well be explained
without ſuppoſing the ſpeech and the letter
to have really procceded from the ſame
perſon.</p>

                  <p>Our reader remembers the paſſage in the
firſt epiſtle to the Theſſalonians, in which
St. Paul ſpoke of the coming of Chriſt:
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:0539601100:320"/>
"This we ſay unto you by the word of the
Lord, that we which are alive, and remain

Lord himſelf ſhall deſcend from heaven,
and the dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt; then

4. It ſhould ſeem that the Theſſalonians, or
ſome however amongſt them, had from this
paſſage conceived an opinion (and that not

and that this perſuaſion had produced, as it
well might, much agitation in the church.
The apoſtle therefore now writes, amongſt
other purpoſes, to quiet this alarm, and to
rectify the miſconſtruction that had been
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:0539601100:321"/>
put upon his words: "Now we beſeech you,
brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jeſus
Chriſt, and by our gathering together unto
him, that ye be not ſoon ſhaken in mind,
or be troubled, neither by ſpirit nor by
word, <hi>nor by letter, as from us,</hi> as that the
day of Chriſt is at hand." If the alluſion
which we contend for be admitted, namely,
if it be admitted, that the paſſage in the
ſecond epiſtle relates to the paſſage in the
firſt, it amounts to a conſiderable proof of
the genuineneſs of both epiſtles. I have no
conception, becauſe I know no example, of
ſuch a device in a forgery, as firſt to frame
an ambiguous paſſage in a letter, then to
repreſent the perſons to whom the letter is
addreſſed as miſtaking the meaning of the
paſſage, and laſtly to write a ſecond letter
in order to correct this miſtake.</p>
                  <p>I have ſaid that this argument ariſes out
of the text, <hi>if</hi> the alluſion be admitted; for I
am not ignorant that many expoſitors un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
the paſſage in the ſecond epiſtle, as
referring to ſome forged letters, which had
been produced in St. Paul's name, and in
which the apoſtle had been made to ſay that
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:0539601100:322"/>
the coming of Chriſt was then at hand. In
defence, however, of the explanation which
we propoſe the reader is deſired to obſerve,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The ſtrong fact, that there exiſts a
paſſage in the firſt epiſtle, to which that in
the ſecond is capable of being referred, <hi>i. e.</hi>
which accounts for the error the writer is
ſolicitous to remove. Had no other epiſtle
than the ſecond been extant, and had it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
theſe circumſtances come to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
whether the text before us related to
a forged epiſtle or to ſome miſconſtruction
of a true one, many conjectures and many
probabilities might have been admitted in
the enquiry, which can have little weight,
when an epiſtle is produced, containing the
very ſort of paſſage we were ſeeking, that
is, a paſſage liable to the miſinterpretation
which the apoſtle proteſts againſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the clauſe which introduces the
paſſage in the ſecond epiſtle bears a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
affinity to what is found in the paſſage
cited from the firſt epiſtle. The clauſe is
this: "We beſeech you, brethren, by the
coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and <hi>by
our gathering together unto him.</hi>" Now in
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:0539601100:323"/>
the firſt epiſtle the deſcription of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Chriſt is accompanied with the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this very circumſtance of his ſaints
"being collected round him." "The Lord
himſelf ſhall deſcend from heaven with a
ſhout, with the voice of the archangel,
and with the trump of God, and the dead
in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt; then we which
are alive and remain ſhall be caught up
together with them in the clouds, <hi>to meet
the Lord</hi> in the air." 1 Theſſ. chap. iv.
ver. 16, 17. This I ſuppoſe to be the "ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
together unto him" intended in
the ſecond epiſtle; and that the author,
when he uſed theſe words, retained in his
thoughts what he had written on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
before.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The ſecond epiſtle is written in the
joint name of Paul, Sylvanus, and Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus,
and it cautions the Theſſalonians
againſt being miſled "by letter as from us"
(<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

appropriate the reference to ſome writing
which bore the name of theſe three teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers?
Now this circumſtance, which is a
very cloſe one, belongs to the epiſtle at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:0539601100:324"/>
in our hands; for the epiſtle which we

In like manner as Acts xv. 1, 24, it is recorded that ſome had pretended to have received inſtructions from the church of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, which had not been received "to whom they gave no ſuch commandment."

"as I beſought thee to abide ſtill

it is evident that this epiſtle was written
ſoon after St. Paul had gone to Macedonia

to the time of St. Paul's journey, recorded
in the beginning of the twentieth chapter of
the Acts: "And after the uproar (excited by
Demetrius at Epheſus) was ceaſed, Paul
called unto him the diſciples, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced

who have conſidered the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
There is however one objection to
the hypotheſis which theſe learned men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to me to have overlooked; and it is
no other than this, that the ſuperſcription
of the ſecond epiſtle to the Corinthians
ſeems to prove, that at the time St. Paul is
ſuppoſed by them to have written this epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to Timothy, Timothy in truth was with
St. Paul in Macedonia. Paul, as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
in the Acts, left Epheſus "for to go
into Macedonia." When he had got into
Macedonia he wrote his ſecond epiſtle to
the Corinthians. Concerning this point
there exiſts little variety of opinion. It is
plainly indicated by the contents of the
epiſtle. It is alſo ſtrongly implied that the
epiſtle was written <hi>ſoon</hi> after the apoſtle's
arrival in Macedonia; for he begins his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
by a train of reflection, referring to his
perſecutions in Aſia as to recent tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as to dangers from which he had
lately been delivered. But in the ſalutation
with which the epiſtle opens <hi>Timothy is joined
with St. Paul,</hi> and conſequently could not
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:0539601100:327"/>
at that time be "left behind at Epheſus."
And as to the only ſolution of the difficulty
which can be thought of, viz. that Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
though he was left behind at Epheſus
upon St. Paul's departure from Aſia, yet
might follow him ſo ſoon after, as to come
up with the apoſtle in Macedonia, before he
wrote his epiſtle to the Corinthians; that
ſuppoſition is inconſiſtent with the terms
and tenor of the epiſtle throughout. For
the writer ſpeaks uniformly of his intention
to return to Timothy at Epheſus, and not of
his expecting Timothy to come to him in
Macedonia: "Theſe things write I unto
thee, <hi>hoping to come unto thee ſhortly</hi>; but if
I tarry long that thou mayeſt know how
thou oughteſt to behave thyſelf" (chap. iii.
ver. 14, 15). "<hi>Till I come</hi> give attendance
to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine"
(chap. iv. ver. 13).</p>
               <p>Since, therefore, the leaving of Timothy
behind at Epheſus, when Paul went into
Macedonia, ſuits not with any journey into
Macedonia recorded in the Acts, I concur
with Biſhop Pearſon in placing the date of
this epiſtle, and the journey referred to in
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:0539601100:328"/>
it, at a period ſubſequent to St. Paul's firſt
impriſonment at Rome, and conſequently
ſubſequent to the aera, up to which the Acts
of the Apoſtles brings his hiſtory. The only
difficulty which attends our opinion is, that
St. Paul muſt, according to us, have come
to Epheſus after his liberation at Rome,
contrary as it ſhould ſeem to what he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
to the Epheſian elders, "that they
ſhould ſee his face no more." And it is
to ſave the infallibility of this prediction,
and for no other reaſon of weight, that an
earlier date is aſſigned to this epiſtle. The
prediction itſelf however, when conſidered
in connection with the circumſtances under
which it was delivered, does not ſeem to
demand ſo much anxiety. The words in
queſtion are found in the twenty-fifth verſe
of the twentieth chapter of the Acts: "And
now behold, I know that ye all, among
whom I have gone preaching the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God, ſhall ſee my face no more."
In the twenty-ſecond and twenty-third
verſes of the ſame chapter, i. e. two verſes
before, the apoſtle makes this declaration:
"And now behold, I go bound in the ſpirit
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:0539601100:329"/>
unto Jeruſalem, not knowing the things
that ſhall befal me there; ſave that the
Holy Ghoſt witneſſeth in every city, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that bonds and afflictions abide me."
This "witneſſing of the Holy Ghoſt" was
undoubtedly prophetic and ſupernatural.
But it went no farther than to foretel that
bonds and afflictions awaited him. And I
can very well conceive, that this might be
all which was communicated to the apoſtle
by extraordinary revelation, and that the
reſt was the concluſion of his own mind,
the deſponding inference which he drew
from ſtrong and repeated intimations of
approaching danger. And the expreſſion
"I know," which St. Paul here uſes, does
not perhaps, when applied to future events
affecting himſelf, convey an aſſertion ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
and abſolute as we may at firſt ſight
apprehend. In the firſt chapter of the epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to the Philippians and the twenty-fifth
verſe, "I know," ſays he, "that I ſhall
abide and continue with you all for your
joy and furtherance of faith." Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
this ſtrong declaration, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
chapter and twenty-third verſe of this
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:0539601100:330"/>
ſame epiſtle, and ſpeaking alſo of the very
ſame event, he is content to uſe a language
of ſome doubt and uncertainty: "Him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I hope to ſend preſently, ſo ſoon <hi>as I
ſhall ſee how it will go with me</hi>; but <hi>I truſt</hi>
in the Lord that I alſo myſelf ſhall come
ſhortly." And a few verſes preceding
theſe, he not only ſeems to doubt of his
ſafety, but almoſt to deſpair; to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate
the poſſibility at leaſt of his condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
and martyrdom: "Yea, and if I be
offered upon the ſacrifice and ſervice of
your faith, I joy and rejoice with you
all."</p>

                  <head>No. I.</head>
                  <p>But can we ſhow that St. Paul viſited
Epheſus after his liberation at Rome? or
rather, can we collect any hints from his
other letters which make it probable that
he did? If we can, then we have a <hi>coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi>
If we cannot, we have only an unau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized
ſuppoſition, to which the exigency
of the caſe compels us to reſort. Now, for
this purpoſe, let us examine the epiſtle to
the Philippians and the epiſtle to Philemon.
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:0539601100:331"/>
Theſe two epiſtles purport to be written
whilſt St. Paul was yet a priſoner at Rome.
To the Philippians he writes as follows:
"I truſt in the Lord that I alſo myſelf
ſhall come ſhortly." To Philemon, who
was a Coloſſian, he gives this direction:
"But withal, prepare me alſo a lodging,
for I truſt that through your prayers I
ſhall be given unto you." An inſpection
of the map will ſhow us that Coloſſe was a
city of the Leſſer Aſia, lying eaſtward, and
at no great diſtance from Epheſus. Philippi
was on the other, i. e. the weſtern ſide of
the Aegean ſea. If the apoſtle executed his
purpoſe; if, in purſuance of the intention
expreſſed in his letter to Philemon, he came
to Coloſſe ſoon after he was ſet at liberty at
Rome, it is very improbable that he would
omit to viſit Epheſus, which lay ſo near to
it, and where he had ſpent three years of
his miniſtry. As he was alſo under a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to the church of Philippi to ſee them
"ſhortly;" if he paſſed from Coloſſe to
Philippi, or from Philippi to Coloſſe, he
could hardly avoid taking Epheſus in his
way.</p>

                  <p>Chap. v. ver. 9. "Let not a widow be
taken into the number under threeſcore
years old."</p>
                  <p>This accords with the account delivered
in the ſixth chapter of the Acts: "And in
thoſe days, when the number of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
was multiplied, there aroſe a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring
of the Grecians againſt the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,
<hi>becauſe their widows were neglected
in the daily miniſtration.</hi>" It appears that,
from the firſt formation of the Chriſtian
church, proviſion was made out of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
funds of the ſociety for the indigent <hi>wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows</hi>
who belonged to it. The hiſtory, we
have ſeen, diſtinctly records the exiſtence of
ſuch an inſtitution at Jeruſalem, a few
years after our Lord's aſcenſion; and is led
to the mention of it very incidentally, viz.
by a diſpute, of which it was the occaſion,
and which produced important conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
to the Chriſtian community. The
epiſtle, without being ſuſpected of borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the hiſtory, refers, briefly indeed,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:0539601100:333"/>
but deciſively, to a ſimilar eſtabliſhment,
ſubſiſting ſome years afterwards at Epheſus.
This agreement indicates that both writings
were founded upon real circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>But, in this article, the material thing
to be noticed is the mode of expreſſion:
"Let not a widow be taken into the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber."
No previous account or explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is given, to which theſe words, "into
the number," can refer; but the direction
comes conciſely and unpreparedly: "Let
not a widow be taken into the number."
Now this is the way in which a man writes,
who is conſcious that he is writing to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
already acquainted with the ſubject of
his letter; and who, he knows, will readily
apprehend and apply what he ſays by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of their being ſo acquainted: but it is
not the way in which a man writes upon
any other occaſion; and leaſt of all, in
which a man would draw up a feigned let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or introduce a ſuppoſitious fact<note n="*" place="bottom">It is not altogether unconnected with our general purpoſe to remark, in the paſſage before us, the ſelec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reſerve which St. Paul recommends to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of the church of Epheſus, in the beſtowing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief upon the poor, becauſe it refutes a calumny which has been inſinuated, that the liberality of the firſt Chriſtians was an artifice to catch converts; or one of the temptations however, by which the idle and mendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant were drawn into this ſociety: "Let not a widow be taken into the number under threeſcore years old, having been the wife of one man, well reported of for her good works; if ſhe have brought up children, if ſhe have lodged ſtrangers, if ſhe have waſhed the ſaints feet, if ſhe have relieved the afflicted, if ſhe have diligently followed every good work: but the younger widows refuſe" (v. 9. 10, 11). And, in another place, "If any man or woman that believeth have wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged, that it may relieve them that are widows indeed." And to the ſame effect, or rather more to our preſent purpoſe, the apoſtle writes in his ſecond epiſtle to the Theſſalonians: "Even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither let him eat," i. e. at the public expence; "for we hear that there are ſome which walk among you diſorderly <hi>working not at all,</hi> but are buſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodies: now them that are ſuch, we command and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort, by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that with quietneſs they work, and eat their own bread." Could a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning or diſſolute poor take advantage of bounty regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated with ſo much caution? or could the mind which dictated theſe ſober and prudent directions be influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced in his recommendations of public charity by any other than the propereſt motives of beneficence?</note>.</p>

the antiquity at leaſt, if not the genuineneſs,
of the epiſtle, becauſe it is an article which
no man would have made the ſubject of
caution who lived in an advanced aera of
the church. It agreed with the infancy of
the ſociety, and with no other ſtate of it.
After the government of the church had
acquired the dignified form which it ſoon
and naturally aſſumed, this injunction could
have no place. Would a perſon who lived
under a hierarchy, ſuch as the Chriſtian
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:0539601100:336"/>

                  <p>Imagine an impoſtor ſitting down to
forge an epiſtle in the name of St. Paul. Is
it credible that it ſhould come into his head
to give ſuch a direction as this; ſo remote
from every thing of doctrine or diſcipline,
every thing of public concern to the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
or the church, or to any ſect, order, or
party in it, and from every purpoſe with
which ſuch an epiſtle could be written? It
ſeems to me that nothing but reality, that
is, the real valetudinary ſituation of a real

ſo domeſtic a nature.</p>
                  <p>But if the peculiarity of the advice be
obſervable, the place in which it ſtands is
more ſo. The context is this: "Lay hands
ſuddenly on no man, neither be partaker
of other men's ſins; keep thyſelf pure;
drink no longer water, but uſe a little
wine for thy ſtomach's ſake, and thine
often infirmities: ſome men's ſins are
open before hand, going before to judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and ſome men they follow after."
The direction to Timothy about his diet
ſtands between two ſentences, as wide from
the ſubject as poſſible. The train of thought
ſeems to be broken to let it in. Now
when does this happen? It happens when
a man writes as he remembers; when he
puts down an article that occurs the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it occurs, leſt he ſhould afterwards
forget it. Of this the paſſage before us
bears ſtrongly the appearance. In actual
letters, in the negligence of a real corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence,
examples of this kind frequently
take place; ſeldom I believe in any other
production. For the moment a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:0539601100:338"/>
what he writes as a <hi>compoſition,</hi> which

                  <p>What was the mercy which St. Paul
here commemorates, and what was the
crime of which he accuſes himſelf, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
from the verſes immediately preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
"I thank Chriſt Jeſus, our Lord, who
hath enabled me, for that he counted me

becauſe I did it ignorantly in unbelief"
(ch. i. ver. 12, 13). The whole quotation
plainly refers to St. Paul's original enmity to
the Chriſtian name, the interpoſition of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in his converſion, and his ſubſequent
deſignation to the miniſtry of the goſpel;
and by this reference aſſirms indeed the
ſubſtance of the apoſtle's hiſtory delivered
in the Acts. But what in the paſſage
ſtrikes my mind moſt powerfully, is the
obſervation that is raiſed out of the fact:
"For this cauſe I obtained mercy, that in
me firſt Jeſus Chriſt might ſhew forth all
long-ſuffering, for a pattern to them
which ſhould hereafter believe on him
to life everlaſting." It is a juſt and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
reflection, ſpringing from the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of the author's converſion, or rather
from the impreſſion which that great event
had left upon his memory. It will be ſaid,
perhaps, that an impoſtor, acquainted with
St. Paul's hiſtory, may have put ſuch a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent
into his mouth; or, what is the ſame
thing, into a letter drawn up in his name.
But where, we may aſk, is ſuch an impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:0539601100:340"/>
to be found? The piety, the truth, the
benevolence of the thought ought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
it from this imputation. For, though

of the ancient tragedy could have given
to his ſcene a ſentiment as virtuous and as

                  <p>IT was the uniform tradition of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
church, that St. Paul viſited
Rome twice, and twice there ſuffered im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment;
and that he was put to death
at Rome at the concluſion of his ſecond
impriſonment. This opinion concerning St.
Paul's <hi>two</hi> journeys to Rome, is confirmed
by a great variety of hints and alluſions in
the epiſtle before us, compared with what
fell from the apoſtle's pen in other letters
purporting to have been written from Rome.
That our preſent epiſtle was written whilſt
St. Paul was a <hi>priſoner,</hi> is diſtinctly intimated
by the eighth verſe of the firſt chapter:
"Be not thou therefore aſhamed of the
teſtimony of our Lord, nor of me his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner."
And whilſt he was a priſoner <hi>at
Rome,</hi> by the ſixteenth and ſeventeenth
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:0539601100:342"/>
verſes of the ſame chapter: "The Lord give
mercy unto the houſe of Oneſiphorus; for
he oft refreſhed me, and was not aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of my chain: but when he was in
Rome he ſought me out very diligently,
and found me." Since it appears from the
former quotation that St. Paul wrote this
epiſtle in confinement, it will hardly admit of
doubt that the word <hi>chain,</hi> in the latter
quotation, refers to that conſinement; the
chain by which he was <hi>then</hi> bound, the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tody
in which he was then kept. And if
the word chain deſignate the author's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement
at the time of writing the epiſtle,
the next words determine it to have been
written from Rome: "He was not aſhamed
of my chain; but when he was in Rome
he ſought me out very diligently." Now
that it <hi>was</hi> not written during the apoſtle's
firſt impriſonment at Rome, or during the
ſame impriſonment in which the epiſtles to
the Epheſians, the Coloſſians, the Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians,
and Philemon, were written, may be
gathered, with conſiderable evidence, from
a compariſon of theſe ſeveral epiſtles with
the preſent.</p>

                     <pb n="341" facs="tcp:0539601100:343"/>
I. In the former epiſtles the author conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
looked forward to his liberation from
confinement, and his ſpeedy departure from
Rome. He tells the Philippians (ch. ii.
ver. 24), "I truſt in the Lord that I alſo
myſelf ſhall come ſhortly." Philemon
he bids to prepare for him a lodging; "for
I truſt," ſays he, "that through your
prayers, I ſhall be given unto you"
(ver. 22). In the epiſtle before us he
holds a language extremely different: "I
am now ready to be offered, and the time
of my departure is at hand. I have
fought a good fight; I have finiſhed my
courſe; I have kept the faith: hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
there is laid up for me a crown of
righteouſneſs, which the Lord, the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
judge, ſhall give me at that day"
(ch. iv. ver. 6-8).</p>
                  <p n="2">II. When the former epiſtles were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
from Rome, Timothy was with St.
Paul; and is joined with him in writing to
the Coloſſians, the Philippians, and to Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.
The preſent epiſtle implies that he
was abſent.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. In the former epiſtles Demas was
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:0539601100:344"/>
with St. Paul at Rome: "Luke, the belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
phyſician, and Demas, greet you." In
the epiſtle now before us: "Demas hath
forſaken him, having loved this preſent
world, and is gone to Theſſalonica."</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. In the former epiſtle, Mark was
with St. Paul, and joins in ſaluting the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſians.
In the preſent epiſtle, Timothy is
ordered to "bring him with him, for he is
profitable to me for the miniſtry" (ch. iv.
ver. 11).</p>
                  <p>The caſe of Timothy and of Mark might
be very well accounted for, by ſuppoſing
the preſent epiſtle to have been written <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
the others; ſo that Timothy, who is here
exhorted "to come ſhortly unto him" (ch.
iv. ver. 9.) might have arrived, and that
Mark, "whom he was to bring with him"
(ch. iv. ver. 11), might have alſo reached
Rome in ſufficient time to have been with
St. Paul when the four epiſtles were
written: but then ſuch a ſuppoſition is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent
with what is ſaid of Demas, by
which the poſteriority of this to the other
epiſtles is ſtrongly indicated; for in the
other epiſtles Demas was with St. Paul, in
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:0539601100:345"/>
the preſent he hath "forſaken him, and is
gone to Theſſalonica." The oppoſition
alſo of ſentiment, with reſpect to the event
of the perſecution, is hardly reconcileable
to the ſame impriſonment.</p>
                  <p>The two following conſiderations, which
were firſt ſuggeſted upon this queſtion by
Ludovicus Capellus, are ſtill more conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the twentieth verſe of the fourth
chapter, St. Paul informs Timothy "that
Eraſtus abode at Corinth,"
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. The form of expreſſion implies,
that Eraſtus had ſtaid behind at Corinth,
when St. Paul left it. But this could not
be meant of any journey from Corinth
which St. Paul took prior to his firſt impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment
at Rome; for when Paul departed
from Corinth, as related in the twentieth
chapter of the Acts, Timothy was with
him: and this was the laſt time the apoſtle
left Corinth before his coming to Rome;
becauſe he left it to proceed on his way to
Jeruſalem, ſoon after his arrival at which
place he was taken into cuſtody, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in that cuſtody till he was carried to
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:0539601100:346"/>
Caeſar's tribunal. There could be no need
therefore to inform Timothy that "Eraſtus
ſtaid behind at Corinth" upon this occaſion,
becauſe, if the fact was ſo, it muſt have
been known to Timothy who was preſent,
as well as to St. Paul.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the ſame verſe our epiſtle alſo ſtates
the following article: "Trophimus have I
left at Miletum ſick." When St. Paul
paſſed through Miletum on his way to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,
as related Acts xx. Trophimus was
not left behind, but accompanied him to
that city. He was indeed the occaſion of
the uproar at Jeruſalem, in conſequence of
which St. Paul was apprehended; for "they
had ſeen," ſays the hiſtorian, "before
with him in the city, Trophimus an
Epheſian, whom they ſuppoſed that Paul
had brought into the temple." This
was evidently the laſt time of Paul's being
at Miletus before his firſt impriſonment;
for, as hath been ſaid, after his apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
at Jeruſalem, he remained in cuſtody
till he was ſent to Rome.</p>
                  <p>In theſe two articles we have a journey
referred to, which muſt have taken place
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:0539601100:347"/>
ſubſequent to the concluſion of St. Luke's
hiſtory, and of courſe after St. Paul's libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
from his firſt impriſonment. The
epiſtle therefore, which contains this refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
ſince it appears from other parts of
it to have been written whilſt St. Paul was
a priſoner at Rome, proves that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to that city again, and undergone
there a ſecond impriſonment.</p>
                  <p>I do not produce theſe particulars for the
ſake of the ſupport which they lend to the
teſtimony of the fathers concerning St.
Paul's <hi>ſecond</hi> impriſonment, but to remark
their conſiſtency and agreement with one
another. They are all reſolvable into one
ſuppoſition: and although the ſuppoſition
itſelf be in ſome ſort only negative, viz. that
the epiſtle was not written during St.
Paul's firſt reſidence at Rome, but in ſome
future impriſonment in that city; yet is the
conſiſtency not leſs worthy of obſervation;
for the epiſtle touches upon names and
circumſtances connected with the date and
with the hiſtory of the firſt impriſonment,
and mentioned in letters written during that
impriſonment, and ſo touches upon them,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:0539601100:348"/>
as to leave what is ſaid of one conſiſtent
with what is ſaid of others, and conſiſtent
alſo with what is ſaid of them in different
epiſtles. Had one of theſe circumſtances
been ſo deſcribed, as to have fixed the date
of the epiſtle to the firſt impriſonment, it
would have involved the reſt in contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And when the number and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity
of the articles which have been
brought together under this head are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered;
and when it is conſidered alſo, that
the compariſons we have formed amongſt
them, were in all probability neither pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for, nor thought of, by the writer of
the epiſtle, it will be deemed ſomething
very like the effect of truth, that no invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
repugnancy is perceived between
them.</p>

                  <p>In the Acts of the Apoſtles, in the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
chapter, and at the firſt verſe, we
are told that Paul "came to Derbe and
Lyſtra, and behold a certain diſciple was
there named Timotheus, the ſon of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:0539601100:349"/>
woman, which was a Jeweſs, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved;
but his father was a Greek." In
the epiſtle before us, in the firſt chapter
and at the fifth verſe, St. Paul writes to Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
thus: "Greatly deſiring to ſee thee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled
with joy, when I call to remembrance the
unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt
firſt in thy grandmother Lois, <hi>and thy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Eunice</hi>; and I am perſuaded that in
thee alſo." Here we have a fair unforced
example of coincidence. In the hiſtory
Timothy was the "ſon of a Jeweſs <hi>that</hi>
believed:" in the epiſtle St. Paul ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauds
"the <hi>faith</hi> which dwelt in his mother
Eunice." In the hiſtory it is ſaid of the
mother, "that ſhe was a Jeweſs, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved;"
of the father, "that he was a
Greek." Now when it is ſaid of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>alone</hi> "that ſhebelieved," the father
being nevertheleſs mentioned in the ſame
ſentence, we are led to ſuppoſe of the father,
that he did not believe, i. e. either that he
was dead, or that he remained unconverted.
Agreeably hereunto, whilſt praiſe is beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the epiſtle upon one parent, and upon
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:0539601100:350"/>
her ſincerity in the faith, no notice is taken
of the other. The mention of the grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother
is the addition of a circumſtance
not found in the hiſtory: but it is a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
which, as well as the names of
the parties, might naturally be expected to
be known to the apoſtle, though overlook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by his hiſtorian.</p>

                  <p>This verſe diſcloſes a circumſtance which
agrees exactly with what is intimated in the
quotation from the Acts, adduced in the laſt
number. In that quotation it is recorded
of Timothy's mother, "that ſhe was a Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs."
This deſcription is virtually, "though,
I am ſatisfied," undeſignedly, recognized in
the epiſtle, when Timothy is reminded in
it, "that from a child he had known the
holy ſcriptures." "The holy ſcriptures"
undoubtedly meant the ſcriptures of the
Old Teſtament. The expreſſion bears that

ſenſe in every place in which it occurs.
Thoſe of the New had not yet acquired the

In what manner then could Timothy have
known "from a child" the Jewiſh ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
had he not been born, on one ſide or
on both, of Jewiſh parentage? Perhaps he
was not leſs likely to be carefully inſtructed

fully known my doctrine, manner of life,
purpoſe, faith, long-ſuffering, charity, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
perſecutions, afflictions, which
came unto me <hi>at Antioch, at Iconium, at
Lyſtra</hi>; what perſecutions I endured: but
out of them all the Lord delivered me."</p>
                  <p>The Antioch here mentioned was not
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:0539601100:353"/>
Antioch the capital of Syria, where Paul and
Barnabas reſided "a long time;" but An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch
in Piſidia, to which place Paul and
Barnabas came in their firſt apoſtolic pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs,
and where Paul delivered a memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
diſcourſe, which is preſerved in the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
chapter of the Acts. At this Antioch
the hiſtory relates, that "the Jews ſtirred
up the devout and honourable women,
and the chief men of the city, <hi>and raiſed
perſecution againſt Paul and Barnabas,</hi> and
expelled them out of their coaſts. But
they ſhook off the duſt of their feet againſt
them, and came unto <hi>Iconium.</hi> . . . . And
it came to paſs in Iconium, that they went
both together into the ſynagogue of the
Jews, and ſo ſpake that a great multitude
both of the Jews and alſo of the Greeks
believed; but the unbelieving Jews ſtirred
up the Gentiles, and made their minds
evil-affected againſt the brethren. Long
time therefore abode they ſpeaking boldly
in the Lord, which gave teſtimony unto
the word of his grace, and granted ſigns
and wonders to be done by their hands.
But the multitude of the city was divided;
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:0539601100:354"/>
and part held with the Jews, and part with
the apoſtles. And when there was an
aſſault made both of the Gentiles and alſo
of the Jews, with their rulers, <hi>to uſe them
deſpitefully and to ſtone</hi> them, they were
ware of it, and fled unto <hi>Lyſtra</hi> and Derbe,
cities of Lycaonia, and unto the region that
lieth round about, and there they preached
the goſpel . . . . And there came thither
certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium,
who perſuaded the people, and having
ſtoned Paul, drew him out of the city,
ſuppoſing he had been dead. Howbeit,
as the diſciples ſtood round about him, he
roſe up and came into the city; and the
next day he departed with Barnabas to
Derbe: and when they had preached the
goſpel in that city, and had taught many,
they returned again to Lyſtra, and to Ico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium,
and to Antioch." This account
compriſes the period to which the alluſion
in the epiſtle is to be referred. We have ſo
far therefore a conformity between the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
and the epiſtle, that St. Paul is aſſerted
in the hiſtory to have ſuffered perſecutions in
the three cities, his perſecutions at which
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:0539601100:355"/>
are appealed to in the epiſtle; and not only
ſo, but to have ſuffered theſe perſecutions
both in immediate ſucceſſion, and in the
order in which the cities are mentioned in
the epiſtle. The conformity alſo extends
to another circumſtance. In the apoſtolic
hiſtory Lyſtra and Derbe are commonly
mentioned together: in the quotation from
the epiſtle Lyſtra is mentioned, and not
Derbe. And the diſtinction will appear on
this occaſion to be accurate; for St. Paul is
here enumerating his perſecutions: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he underwent grievous perſecutions
in each of the three cities through which he
paſſed to Derbe, at Derbe itſelf he met with
none: "The next day he departed," ſays the
hiſtorian, "To Derbe; and when they had
preached the goſpel to that city, and had
taught many, they returned again to Lyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra."
The epiſtle, therefore, in the names
of the cities, in the order in which they
are enumerated, and in the place at which
the enumeration ſtops, correſponds exactly
with the hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>But a ſecond queſtion remains, namely,
how theſe perſecutions were "known" to
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:0539601100:356"/>
Timothy, or why the apoſtle ſhould recal
theſe in particular to his remembrance, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than many other perſecutions with
which his miniſtry had been attended.
When ſome time, probably three years, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
(<hi>vide</hi> Pearſon's Annales Paulinas),
St. Paul made a ſecond journey through the
ſame country, "in order to go again and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit
the brethren in every city where he
had preached the word of the Lord," we
read, Acts, chap. xvi. ver. 1. that, "when
he came to Derbe and Lyſtra, behold a
certain diſciple was there named Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus."
One or other therefore of theſe
cities was the place of Timothy's abode. We
read moreover that he was well reported of
by the brethren that were at Lyſtra and
Iconium; ſo that he muſt have been well
acquainted with theſe places. Alſo again,
when Paul came to Derbe and Lyſtra, Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy
was already a diſciple: "Behold a
certain diſciple was there named Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus."
He muſt, therefore, have been
converted <hi>before.</hi> But ſince it is expreſsly
ſtated in the epiſtle, that Timothy was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
by St. Paul himſelf, that he was "his
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:0539601100:357"/>
own ſon in the faith;" it follows that he
muſt have been converted by him upon his
former journey into thoſe parts; which was
the very time when the apoſtle underwent
the perſecutions referred to in the epiſtle.
Upon the whole then, perſecutions at the
ſeveral cities named in the epiſtle are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly
recorded in the Acts; and Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy's
knowledge of this part of St. Paul's
hiſtory, which knowledge is appealed to in
the epiſtle, is fairly deduced from the place
of his abode, and the time of his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
It may farther be obſerved, that it
is probable from this account, that St. Paul
was in the midſt of theſe perſecutions when
Timothy became known to him. No won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
then that the apoſtle, though in a letter
written long afterwards, ſhould remind his
favourite convert of thoſe ſcenes of affliction
and diſtreſs under which they firſt met.</p>
                  <p>Although this coincidence, as to the
names of the cities, be more ſpecific and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
than many which we have pointed out,
yet I apprehend there is no juſt reaſon for
thinking it to be artificial; for had the
writer of the epiſtle ſought a coincidence
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:0539601100:358"/>
with the hiſtory upon this head, and
ſearched the Acts of the Apoſtles for the
purpoſe, I conceive he would have ſent us
at once to Philippi and Theſſalonica, where
Paul ſuffered perſecution, and where, from
what is ſtated, it may eaſily be gathered that
Timothy accompanied him, rather than
have appealed to perſecutions as known to
Timothy, in the account of which perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
Timothy's preſence is not mentioned;
it not being till after one entire chapter, and
in the hiſtory of a journey three years fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to this, that Timothy's name occurs in
the Acts of the Apoſtles for the firſt time.</p>

no writer in the New Teſtament, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
St. Paul, appealed to heathen teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony;
and becauſe St. Paul repeatedly did
ſo. In his celebrated ſpeech at Athens,
preſerved in the ſeventeenth chapter of the
Acts, he tells his audience, that "in God
we live, and move, and have our being;
as certain alſo of your own poets have
ſaid, for we are alſo his offspring."</p>

                     <pb n="358" facs="tcp:0539601100:360"/>
The reader will perceive much ſimilarity
of manner in theſe two paſſages. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
in the ſpeech is to a heathen poet; it
is the ſame in the epiſtle. In the ſpeech the
apoſtle urges his hearers with the authority
of a poet <hi>of their own</hi>; in the epiſtle he avails
himſelf of the ſame advantage. Yet there is
a variation, which ſhows that the hint of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting
a quotation in the epiſtle was not, as
it may be ſuſpected, borrowed from ſeeing
the like practice attributed to St. Paul in
the hiſtory; and it is this, that in the epiſtle
the author cited is called a <hi>prophet,</hi> "one of
themſelves, even a <hi>prophet</hi> of their own."
Whatever might be the reaſon for calling
Epimenides a prophet; whether the names
of poet and prophet were occaſionally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible;
whether Epimenides in particular
had obtained that title, as Grotius ſeems to
have proved; or whether the appellation
was given to him, in this inſtance, as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
delivered a deſcription of the Cretan
character, which the future ſtate of morals
amongſt them verified; whatever was the
reaſon (and any of theſe reaſons will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
for the variation, ſuppoſing St. Paul
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:0539601100:361"/>
to have been the author), one point is plain,
namely, if the epiſtle had been forged, and
the author had inſerted a quotation in it
merely from having ſeen an example of the
ſame kind in a ſpeech aſcribed to St. Paul,
he would ſo far have imitated his original,
as to have introduced his quotation in the
ſame manner, that is, he would have given
to Epimenides the title which he ſaw there
given to Aratus. The other ſide of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternative
is that the hiſtory took the hint
from the epiſtle. But that the author of
the Acts of the Apoſtles had not the epiſtle
to Titus before him, at leaſt that he did not
uſe it as one of the documents or materials
of his narrative, is rendered nearly certain
by the obſervation that the name of Titus
does not once occur in his book.</p>
                  <p>It is well known, and was remarked by St.
Jerome, that the apothegm in the fifteenth

letters are principally occupied in deſcribing
the qualifications to be ſought for, in thoſe
whom they ſhould appoint to offices in the
church; and the ingredients of this deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are in both letters nearly the ſame.
Timothy and Titus are likewiſe cautioned
againſt the ſame prevailing corruptions, and,
in particular, againſt the ſame miſdirection
of their cares and ſtudies. This affinity
obtains, not only in the ſubject of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
which, from the ſimilarity of ſituation
in the perſons to whom they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed,
might be expected to be ſomewhat
alike, but extends, in a great variety of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
to the phraſes and expreſſions. The
writer accoſts his two friends with the ſame
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:0539601100:365"/>
ſalutation, and paſſes on to the buſineſs of
his letter by the ſame tranſition.</p>
                  <p>"Unto Timothy, <hi>my own ſon in the faith,</hi>
grace, mercy, and peace from God our

ver. 2, 3.</p>
                  <p>"To Titus, <hi>mine own ſon after the common
faith,</hi> grace, mercy, and peace from God
the Father, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt our
Saviour: <hi>for this cauſe left I thee in Crete.</hi>"
Tit. chap. i. ver. 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>If Timothy was "not to <hi>give heed to
fables</hi> and endleſs <hi>genealogies,</hi> which mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter

no man deſpiſe his youth," 1 Tim. chap.

This verbal conſent is alſo obſervable in
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:0539601100:366"/>
ſome very peculiar expreſſions, which have
no relation to the particular character of
Timothy or Titus.</p>
                  <p>The phraſe "it is a faithful ſaying"
(<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>), made uſe of to preface
ſome ſentence upon which the writer lays
a more than ordinary ſtreſs, occurs three
times in the firſt epiſtle to Timothy, once
in the ſecond, and once in the epiſtle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us, and in no other part of St. Paul's
writings; and it is remarkable that theſe
three epiſtles were probably all written to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the concluſion of his life; and that
they are the only epiſtles which were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
after his firſt impriſonment at Rome.</p>
                  <p>The ſame obſervation belongs to another

words or doctrine. It is thus uſed, twice

ver. 6-8.</p>
                  <p>The moſt natural account which can be
given of theſe reſemblances, is to ſuppoſe
that the two epiſtles were written nearly at
the ſame time, and whilſt the ſame ideas
and phraſes dwelt in the writer's mind. Let
us enquire therefore, whether the notes of
time, extant in the two epiſtles, in any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
favour this ſuppoſition.</p>
                  <p>We have ſeen that it was neceſſary to
refer the firſt epiſtle to Timothy to a date
ſubſequent to St. Paul's firſt impriſonment
at Rome, becauſe there was no journey into
Macedonia prior to that event, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
with the circumſtance of leaving
"Timothy behind at Epheſus." The jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
of St. Paul from Crete, alluded to in the
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:0539601100:369"/>
epiſtle before us, and in which Titus "was
left in Crete to ſet in order the things
that were wanting," muſt, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
be carried to the period which inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened
between his firſt and ſecond impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
For the hiſtory, which reaches, we
know, to the time of St. Paul's firſt impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment,
contains no account of his going to
Crete, except upon his voyage as a priſoner
to Rome; and that this could not be the
occaſion referred to in our epiſtle is evident
from hence, that when St. Paul wrote this
epiſtle, he appears to have been at liberty;
whereas, after that voyage, he continued
for two years at leaſt in confinement. Again,
it is agreed that St. Paul wrote his firſt epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
to Timothy from Macedonia: "As I
beſought thee to abide ſtill at Epheſus,
when I went (or came) into Macedonia."
And that he was in theſe parts, <hi>i. e.</hi> in this
peninſula, when he wrote the epiſtle to Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,
is rendered probable by his directing
Titus to come to him to Nicopolis: "When
I ſhall ſend Artemas unto thee or Tychi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,
be diligent (make haſte) to come unto
me to Nicopolis; for I have determined
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:0539601100:370"/>
there to winter." The moſt noted city of
that name was in Epirus, near to Actium.
And I think the form of ſpeaking, as well
as the nature of the caſe, renders it probable,
that the writer was at Nicopolis, or in the
neighbourhood thereof, when he dictated
this direction to Titus.</p>
                  <p>Upon the whole, if we may be allowed
to ſuppoſe that St. Paul, after his liberation
at Rome, ſailed into Aſia, taking Crete in
his way; that from Aſia, and from Epheſus,
the capital of that country, he proceeded into
Macedonia, and croſſing the peninſula in his
progreſs, came into the neighbourhood of
Nicopolis; we have a route which falls in
with every thing. It executes the intention
expreſſed by the apoſtle of viſiting Coloſſe
and Philippi as ſoon as he ſhould be ſet at
liberty at Rome. It allows him to leave
"Titus at Crete," and "Timothy at Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,
as he went into Macedonia;" and to
write to both not long after from the penin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſula
of Greece, and probably the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of Nicopolis: thus bringing together
the dates of theſe two letters, and thereby
accounting for that affinity between them,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:0539601100:371"/>
both in ſubject and language, which our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
have pointed out. I confeſs that the
journey, which we have thus traced out for
St. Paul, is, in a great meaſure, hypothetic;
but it ſhould be obſerved, that it is a ſpecies
of conſiſtency, which ſeldom belongs to
falſehood, to admit of an hypotheſis, which
includes a great number of independent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
without contradiction.</p>

                  <p>THE ſingular correſpondency between
this epiſtle and that to the Coloſſians
has been remarked already. An aſſertion in
the epiſtle to the Coloſſians, viz. that "One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimus
was one of them," is verified by
the epiſtle to Philemon; and is verified, not
by any mention of Coloſſe, any the moſt
diſtant intimation concerning the place of
Philemon's abode, but ſingly by ſtating One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimus
to be Philemon's ſervant, and by join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the ſalutation Philemon with Archip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus;
for this Archippus, when we go back
to the epiſtle to the Coloſſians, appears to
have been an inhabitant of that city, and,
as it ſhould ſeem, to have held an office of
authority in that church. The caſe ſtands
thus. Take the epiſtle to the Coloſſians alone,
and no circumſtance is diſcoverable which
makes out the aſſertion, that Oneſimus was
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:0539601100:373"/>
"one of them." Take the epiſtle to Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
alone, and nothing at all appears con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the place to which Philemon or his
ſervant Oneſimus belonged. For any thing
that is ſaid in the epiſtle, Philemon might
have been a Theſſalonian, a Philippian, or
an Epheſian, as well as a Coloſſian. Put the
two epiſtles together and the matter is clear.
The reader perceives a <hi>junction</hi> of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
which aſcertains the concluſion at
once. Now, all that is neceſſary to be add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this place is, that this correſpondency
evinces the genuineneſs of one epiſtle, as
well as of the other. It is like comparing
the two parts of a cloven tally. Coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidence
proves the authenticity of both.</p>

               <div n="2" type="section">
                  <head>No. II.</head>
                  <p>And this coincidence is perfect; not only
in the main article of ſhowing, by implica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Oneſimus to be a Coloſſian, but in
many dependent circumſtances.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. "I beſeech thee for my ſon Oneſimus,
whom <hi>I have ſent</hi> again" (ver 10-12).
It appears from the epiſtle to the Coloſſians,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:0539601100:374"/>
that, in truth, Oneſimus was ſent at that
time to Coloſſe: "All my ſtate ſhall Tychi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus
declare, whom I have ſent unto you
for the ſame purpoſe, <hi>with Oneſimus</hi> a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and beloved brother." Coloſ. chap. iv.
ver. 7-9.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. "I beſeech thee for my ſon Oneſimus,
<hi>whom I have begotten in my bonds</hi>" (ver.
10). It appears from the preceding quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that Oneſimus was with St. Paul when
he wrote the epiſtle to the Coloſſians; and
that he wrote that epiſtle <hi>in impriſonment</hi> is
evident from his declaration in the fourth
chapter and third verſe: "Praying alſo for
us, that God would open unto us a door
of utterance, to ſpeak the myſtery of
Chriſt, for which I am alſo <hi>in bonds.</hi>"</p>
                  <p n="3">3. St. Paul bids Philemon prepare for
him a lodging: "For I truſt," ſays he, "that,
through your prayers, I ſhall be given
unto you." This agrees with the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſpeedy deliverance, which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
in another epiſtle written during
the ſame impriſonment: "Him" (Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy)
"I hope to ſend preſently, ſo ſoon as
I ſhall ſee how it will go with me; <hi>but I</hi>
                     <pb n="371" facs="tcp:0539601100:375"/>
                     <hi>truſt in the Lord that I alſo myſelf ſhall come
ſhortly.</hi>" Phil. chap. ii. ver. 23, 24.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As the letter to Philemon, and that to
the Coloſſians, were written at the ſame
time, and ſent by the ſame meſſenger, the
one to a particular inhabitant, the other to
the church of Coloſſe, it may be expected
that the ſame, or nearly the ſame, perſons
would be about St. Paul, and join with him,
as was the practice, in the ſalutations of the
epiſtle. Accordingly we find the names of
Ariſtarchus, Marcus, Epaphras, Luke, and
Demas, in both epiſtles. Timothy, who is
joined with St. Paul in the ſuperſcription of
the epiſtle to the Coloſſians, is joined with
him in this. Tychicus did not ſalute Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon,
becauſe he accompanied the epiſtle
to Coloſſe, and would undoubtedly there
ſee him. Yet the reader of the epiſtle to
Philemon will remark one conſiderable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
in the catalogue of ſaluting friends,
and which ſhows that the catalogue was not
copied from that to the Coloſſians. In the
epiſtle to the Coloſſians, Ariſtarchus is called
by St. Paul his fellow-priſoner, Coloſ. chap.
iv. ver. 10; in the epiſtle to Philemon, Ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarchus
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:0539601100:376"/>
is mentioned without any addition,
and the title of fellow-priſoner is given
to Epaphras<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Benſon obſerves, and perhaps truly, that the appellation of fellow-priſoner, as applied by St. Paul to Epaphras, did not imply that they were impriſoned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether <hi>at the time</hi>; any more than your calling a perſon your fellow-traveller, imports that you are then upon your travels. If he had, upon any former occaſion, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled with you, you might afterwards ſpeak of him under that title. It is juſt ſo with the term fellow-priſoner.</note>.</p>
                  <p>And let it alſo be obſerved, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the cloſe and circumſtantial agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
between the two epiſtles, this is not
the caſe of an opening left in a genuine
writing, which an impoſtor is induced to fill
up; nor of a reference to ſome writing not
extant, which ſets a ſophiſt at work to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the loſs, in like manner as, becauſe St.
Paul was ſuppoſed, Coloſ. chap. iv. ver. 16,
to allude to an epiſtle written by him to the
Laodiceans, ſome perſon has from thence
taken the hint of uttering a forgery under
that title. The preſent, I ſay, is not that
caſe; for Philemon's name is not mentioned
in the epiſtle to the Coloſſians; Oneſimus's
ſervile condition is no where hinted at, any
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:0539601100:377"/>
more than his crime, his flight, or the place
or time of his converſion. The ſtory there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of the epiſtle, if it be a fiction, is a fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to which the author could not have
been guided, by any thing he had read in
St. Paul's genuine writings.</p>

haſt toward the Lord Jeſus, and toward
all ſaints."</p>
                  <p>"<hi>Hearing of thy love and faith.</hi>" This is
the form of ſpeech which St. Paul was wont
to uſe towards thoſe churches which he had
not ſeen, or then viſited: ſee Rom. chap. i.
ver. 8; Epheſ. chap. i. ver. 15; Col. chap. i.
ver. 3, 4. Toward thoſe churches and
perſons, with whom he was previouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted,
he employed a different phraſe; as,
"I thank my God always on your behalf,"
1 Cor. chap. i. ver. 4; 2 Theſſ. chap. i. ver.
3; or, "upon every <hi>remembrance</hi> of you,"
Phil. chap. i. ver. 3; 1 Theſſ. chap. i. ver. 2,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:0539601100:378"/>
3; 2 Tim. chap. i. ver. 3; and never ſpeaks
<hi>of hearing of them.</hi> Yet, I think, it muſt be
concluded, from the nineteenth verſe of this
epiſtle, that Philemon had been converted by
St. Paul himſelf: "Albeit, I do not ſay to
thee, how <hi>thou oweſt unto me</hi> even thine
own ſelf beſides." Here then is a peculiarity.
Let us enquire whether the epiſtle ſupplies
any circumſtance which will account for it.
We have ſeen that it may be made out, not
from the epiſtle itſelf, but from a compariſon
of the epiſtle with that to the Coloſſians, that
Philemon was an inhabitant of Coloſſe; and
it farther appears, from the epiſtle to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſians,
that St. Paul had never been in that
city: "I would that ye knew what great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
I have for you and for them at Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea,
and for as many as have not ſeen my
face in the fleſh." Col. ch. ii. ver. 1. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though,
therefore, St. Paul had formerly met
with Philemon at ſome other place, and had
been the immediate inſtrument of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,
yet Philemon's faith and conduct
afterwards, inaſmuch as he lived in a city
which St. Paul had never viſited, could only
be known to him by fame and reputation.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="4" type="section">

                  <p>The tenderneſs and delicacy of this epiſtle
have been long admired: "Though I might
be much bold in Chriſt to enjoin thee that
which is convenient, yet for love's ſake
I rather beſeech thee, being ſuch a one as
Paul the aged, and now alſo a priſoner of
Jeſus Chriſt. I beſeech thee for my ſon
Oneſimus, whom I have begotten in my
bonds." There is ſomething certainly very
melting and perſuaſive in this, and every
part of the epiſtle. Yet, in my opinion,
the character of St. Paul prevails in it
throughout. The warm, affectionate, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative
teacher is interceding with an
abſent friend for a beloved convert. He
urges his ſuit with an earneſtneſs, befitting
perhaps not ſo much the occaſion, as the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
and ſenſibility of his own mind. Here
alſo, as every where, he ſhows himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious
of the weight and dignity of his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
nor does he ſuffer Philemon for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to forget it: "I <hi>might</hi> be much bold
in Chriſt to enjoin thee that which is
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:0539601100:380"/>
convenient." He is careful alſo to recal,
though obliquely, to Philemon's memory,
the ſacred obligation under which he had
laid him, by bringing to him the knowledge
of Jeſus Chriſt: "I do not ſay to thee, how
thou oweſt to me even thine own ſelf
beſides." Without laying aſide, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the apoſtolic character, our author ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens
the imperative ſtyle of his addreſs, by
mixing with it every ſentiment and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
that could move the heart of his
correſpondent. Aged and in priſon, he is
content to ſupplicate and entreat. Oneſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
was rendered dear to him by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
and his ſervices; the child of his
affliction, and "miniſtering unto him in the
bonds of the goſpel." This ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
him, whatever had been his fault,
to Philemon's forgiveneſs: "Receive him as
myſelf, as my own bowels." Every thing,
however, ſhould be voluntary. St. Paul
was determined that Philemon's compliance
ſhould flow from his own bounty: "With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
thy mind would I do nothing, that
thy benefit ſhould not be as it were of
neceſſity, but willingly:" truſting never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:0539601100:381"/>
to his gratitude and attachment for
the performance of all that he requeſted,
and for more: "Having confidence in thy
obedience, I wrote unto thee, knowing
that thou wilt alſo do more than I ſay."</p>

               <head>THE SUBSCRIPTIONS OF THE EPISTLES.</head>
               <p>SIX of theſe <hi>ſubſcriptions</hi> are falſe or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable;
that is, they are either abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
contradicted by the contents of the
epiſtle, or are difficult to be reconciled
with them.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The ſubſcription of the firſt epiſtle to the
Corinthians ſtates that it was written from
Philippi, notwithſtanding that, in the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
chapter and the eighth verſe of the
epiſtle, St. Paul informs the Corinthians,
that he will "tarry at Epheſus until Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt;"
and notwithſtanding that he begins
the ſalutations in the epiſtle, by telling them
"the churches of Aſia ſalute you;" a pretty
evident indication that he himſelf was in
Aſia at this time.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The epiſtle to the Galatians is by the
ſubſcription dated from Rome; yet, in the
epiſtle itſelf, St. Paul expreſſes his ſurpriſe
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:0539601100:383"/>
"that they were <hi>ſo ſoon</hi> removed from him
that called them;" whereas his journey to
Rome was ten years poſterior to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
of the Galatians. And what, I
think, is more concluſive, the author, though
ſpeaking of himſelf in this more than any
other epiſtle, does not once mention his
bonds, or call himſelf a priſoner; which he
has not failed to do in every one of the four
epiſtles written from that city, and during
that impriſonment.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The firſt epiſtle to the Theſſalonians
was written, the ſubſcription tells us, from
Athens; yet the epiſtle refers expreſsly to
the coming of Timotheus from Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica
(ch. iii. ver. 6); and the hiſtory in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
us, Acts xviii. ver. 5, that Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
came out of Macedonia to St. Paul at
<hi>Corinth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. The ſecond epiſtle to the Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians
is dated, and without any diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
reaſon, from Athens alſo. If it be
truly the <hi>ſecond</hi>; if it refer, as it appears to
do (ch. ii. ver. 2), to the firſt, and the firſt
was written from Corinth, the place muſt
be erroneouſly aſſigned, for the hiſtory does
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:0539601100:384"/>
not allow us to ſuppoſe that St. Paul, after he
had reached Corinth, went back to Athens.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The firſt epiſtle to Timothy the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
aſſerts to have been ſent from Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea;
yet, when St. Paul writes, "I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought
thee to abide ſtill at Epheſus,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (when I ſet
out for Macedonia)," the reader is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
led to conclude, that he wrote the
letter upon his arrival in that country.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. The epiſtle to Titus is dated from
Nicopolis in Macedonia, whilſt no city of
that name is known to have exiſted in that
province.</p>
               <p>The uſe, and the only uſe, which I make
of theſe obſervations, is to ſhow, how eaſily
errors and contradictions ſteal in where the
writer is not guided by original knowledge.
There are only eleven diſtinct aſſignments
of date to St. Paul's epiſtles (for the four
written from Rome may be conſidered as
plainly cotemporary); and of theſe, ſix ſeem
to be erroneous. I do not attribute any
authority to theſe ſubſcriptions. I believe
them to have been conjectures founded
ſometimes upon looſe traditions, but more
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:0539601100:385"/>
generally upon a conſideration of ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
text, without ſufficiently comparing
it with other parts of the epiſtle, with diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
epiſtles, or with the hiſtory. Suppoſe
then that the ſubſcriptions had come down
to us as authentic parts of the epiſtles, there
would have been more contrarieties and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
ariſing out of theſe final verſes, than
from all the reſt of the volume. Yet, if the
epiſtles had been forged, the whole muſt
have been made up of the ſame elements as
thoſe of which the ſubſcriptions are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
viz. tradition, conjecture, and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence:
and it would have remained to be
accounted for, how, whilſt ſo many errors
were crowded into the concluding clauſes of
the letters, ſo much conſiſtency ſhould be
preſerved in other parts.</p>
               <p>The ſame reflection ariſes from obſerving
the overſights and miſtakes which learned
men have committed, when arguing upon
alluſions which relate to time and place, or
when endeavouring to digeſt ſcattered cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
into a continued ſtory. It is
indeed the ſame caſe; for theſe ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
muſt be regarded as ancient ſcholia,
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:0539601100:386"/>
and as nothing more. Of this liability to
error I can preſent the reader with a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
inſtance; and which I bring forward
for no other purpoſe than that to which
I apply the erroneous ſubſcriptions. Ludo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicus
Capellus, in that part of his Hiſtoria Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolica
Illuſtrata, which is entitled <hi>De Ordine</hi>
Epiſt. Paul. writing upon the ſecond epiſtle
to the Corinthians, triumphs unmercifully
over the want of ſagacity in Baronius, who,
it ſeems, makes St. Paul write his epiſtle to
Titus from Macedonia upon his ſecond viſit
into that province; whereas it appears from
the hiſtory, that Titus, inſtead of being in
Crete where the epiſtle places him, was at
that time ſent by the apoſtle from Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia
to Corinth. "Animadvertere eſt,"
ſays Capellus, "magnam hominis illius
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, qui vult Titum a Paulo in Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam
abductum, illicque relictum, cum inde
Nicopolim navigaret, quem tamen agnoſcit
a Paulo ex Macedoniâ miſſum eſſe Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thum."
This probably will be thought
a detection of inconſiſtency in Baronius.
But what is the moſt remarkable, is, that
in the ſame chapter in which he thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulges
his contempt of Baronius's judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:0539601100:387"/>
Capellus himſelf falls into an error of
the ſame kind, and more groſs and palpable
than that which he reproves. For he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
the chapter by ſtating the ſecond
epiſtle to the Corinthians and the firſt epiſtle
to Timothy to be nearly cotemporary; to
have been both written during the apoſtle's
ſecond viſit into Macedonia; and that a
doubt ſubſiſted concerning the immediate
priority of their dates: "Poſterior ad eoſdem
Corinthios epiſtola, et prior ad Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theum
certant de prioritate, et ſub judice
lis eſt; utraque autem ſcripta eſt paulo
poſtquam Paulus Epheſo diſceſſiſſet, adeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
dum Macedoniam peragraret, ſed
utra tempore praecedat, non liquet." Now,
in the firſt place, it is highly improbable
that the two epiſtles ſhould have been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
either nearly together, or during the
ſame journey through Macedonia; for in
the epiſtle to the Corinthians, Timothy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to have been <hi>with</hi> St. Paul: in the
epiſtle addreſſed to him, to have been left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
at Epheſus, and not only left behind,
but directed to continue there, till St. Paul
ſhould return to that city. In the ſecond
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:0539601100:388"/>
place it is inconceivable, that a queſtion
ſhould be propoſed concerning the priority
of date of the two epiſtles; for, when St.
Paul, in his epiſtle to Timothy, opens his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
to him by ſaying, "as I beſought thee
to abide ſtill at Epheſus when I went into
Macedonia," no reader can doubt but
that he here refers to the <hi>laſt</hi> interview
which had paſſed between them; that he
had not ſeen him ſince; whereas if the
epiſtle be poſterior to that to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,
yet written upon the ſame viſit
into Macedonia, this could not be true; for
as Timothy was along with St. Paul
when he wrote to the Corinthians, he
muſt, upon this ſuppoſition, have paſſed
over to St. Paul in Macedonia after he had
been left by him at Epheſus, and muſt
have returned to Epheſus again before the
epiſtle was written. What miſled Ludo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicus
Capellus was ſimply this, that he had
entirely overlooked Timothy's name in the
ſuperſcription of the ſecond epiſtle to the
Corinthians. Which overſight appears not
only in the quotation which we have given,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:0539601100:389"/>
but from his telling us, as he does, that
Timothy came from Epheſus to St. Paul at
<hi>Corinth,</hi> whereas the ſuperſcription proves
that Timothy was already with St. Paul
when he wrote to the Corinthians from
Macedonia.</p>

               <head>THE CONCLUSION.</head>
               <p>IN the outſet of this enquiry, the reader
was directed to conſider the Acts of the
Apoſtles and the thirteen epiſtles of St. Paul
as certain ancient manuſcripts lately diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
in the cloſet of ſome celebrated library.
We have adhered to this view of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
External evidence of every kind has
been removed out of ſight; and our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
have been employed to collect the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications
of truth and authenticity, which
appeared to exiſt in the writings themſelves,
and to reſult from a compariſon of their
different parts. It is not however neceſſary
to continue this ſuppoſition longer. The teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony
which other remains of cotemporary,
or the monuments of adjoining ages afford
to the reception, notoriety, and public eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of a book, form no doubt the firſt
proof of its genuineneſs. And in no books
whatever is this proof more complete, than
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:0539601100:391"/>
in thoſe at preſent under our conſideration.
The enquiries of learned men, and, above
all, of the excellent Lardner, who never
overſtates a point of evidence, and whoſe
fidelity in citing his authorities has in no
one inſtance been impeached, have eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed,
concerning theſe writings, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
propoſitions:</p>
               <p n="1">I. That in the age immediately poſterior
to that in which St. Paul lived, his letters
were publickly read and acknowledged.</p>
               <p>Some of them are quoted or alluded to
by almoſt every Chriſtian writer that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
by Clement of Rome, by Hermas,
by Ignatius, by Polycarp, diſciples or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries
of the apoſtles; by Juſtin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr,
by the churches of Gaul, by Irenaeus,
by Athenagoras, by Theophilus, by Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Alexandria, by Hermias, by Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,
who occupied the ſucceeding age.
Now when we find a book quoted or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to by an ancient author, we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled
to conclude, that it was read and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in the age and country in which that
author lived. And this concluſion does not,
in any degree, reſt upon the judgment or
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:0539601100:392"/>
character of the author making ſuch refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.
Proceeding by this rule, we have,
concerning the firſt epiſtle to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians
in particular, within forty years after
the epiſtle was written, evidence, not only
of its being extant at Corinth, but of its
being known and read at Rome. Clement,
biſhop of that city, writing to the church
of Corinth, uſes theſe words: "Take into
your hands the epiſtle of the bleſſed Paul
the apoſtle. What did he at firſt write
unto you in the beginning of the goſpel?
Verily he did by the ſpirit admoniſh you
concerning himſelf and Cephas and Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los,
becauſe that even then you did form
parties<note n="*" place="bottom">See Lardner, vol. xii. p. 22.</note>." This was written at a time
when probably ſome muſt have been living
at Corinth, who remembered St. Paul's mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry
there and the receipt of the epiſtle.
The teſtimony is ſtill more valuable, as it
ſhows that the epiſtles were preſerved in
the churches to which they were ſent, and
that they were ſpread and propagated from
them to the reſt of the Chriſtian commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
Agreeably to which natural mode
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:0539601100:393"/>
and order of their publication, Tertullian,
a century afterwards, for proof of the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
and genuineneſs of the apoſtolic writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
bids "any one, who is willing to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
his curioſity profitably in the buſineſs
of their ſalvation, to viſit the apoſtolical
churches, in which their very authentic
letters are recited, ipſae authenticae literae
eorum recitantur." Then he goes on: "Is
Achaia near you? You have Corinth. If
you are not far from Macedonia, you have
Philippi, you have Theſſalonica. If you
can go to Aſia, you have Epheſus; but if
you are near to Italy, you have Rome<note n="*" place="bottom">Lardner, vol. ii. p. 598.</note>."
I adduce this paſſage to ſhow, that the diſtinct
churches or Chriſtian ſocieties, to which St.
Paul's epiſtles were ſent, ſubſiſted for ſome
ages afterwards; that his ſeveral epiſtles were
all along reſpectively read in thoſe churches;
that Chriſtians at large received them from
thoſe churches, and appealed to thoſe
churches for their original and authenticity.</p>
               <p>Arguing in like manner from citations
and alluſions, we have, within the ſpace of
a hundred and fifty years from the time
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:0539601100:394"/>
that the firſt of St. Paul's epiſtles was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
proofs of almoſt all of them being read,
in Paleſtine, Syria, the countries of Aſia
Minor, in Egypt, in that part of Africa
which uſed the Latin tongue, in Greece,
Italy, and Gaul<note n="*" place="bottom">See Lardner's Recapitulation, vol. xii. p. 53.</note>. I do not mean ſimply
to aſſert, that, within the ſpace of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and fifty years, St. Paul's epiſtles were
read in thoſe countries, for I believe that
they were read and circulated from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning;
but that proofs of their being ſo
read occur within that period. And when
it is conſidered how few of the primitive
Chriſtians wrote, and of what was written
how much is loſt, we are to account it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,
or rather as a ſure proof of the
extenſiveneſs of the reputation of theſe
writings, and of the general reſpect in
which they were held, that ſo many teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
and of ſuch antiquity, are ſtill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant.
"In the remaining works of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus,
Clement of Alexandria, and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,
there are perhaps more and
larger quotations of the ſmall volume of
the New Teſtament, than of all the works
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:0539601100:395"/>
of Cicero, in the writings of all characters
for ſeveral ages<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Vide</hi> Lardner's Recapitulation, vol. xii. p. 53.</note>." We muſt add, that
the epiſtles of Paul come in for their full
ſhare of this obſervation; and that all the
thirteen epiſtles, except that to Philemon,
which is not quoted by Irenaeus or Clement,
and which probably eſcaped notice merely
by its brevity, are ſeverally cited, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly
recognized as St. Paul's, by each of
theſe Chriſtian writers. The Ebionites, an
early, though inconſiderable Chriſtian ſect,
rejected St. Paul and his epiſtles<note n="†" place="bottom">Lardner, vol. ii. p. 808.</note>; that is,
they rejected theſe epiſtles, not becauſe they
were not, but becauſe they were St. Paul's;
and becauſe, adhering to the obligation of
the Jewiſh law, they choſe to diſpute his
doctrine and authority. Their ſuffrage as
to the genuineneſs of the epiſtles does not
contradict that of other Chriſtians. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,
an heretical writer in the former part
of the ſecond century, is ſaid by Tertullian to
have rejected three of the epiſtles which we
now receive, viz. the two epiſtles to Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
and the epiſtle to Titus. It appears to
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:0539601100:396"/>
me not improbable, that Marcion might
make ſome ſuch diſtinction as this, that no
apoſtolic epiſtle was to be admitted which
was not read or atteſted by the church to
which it was ſent; for it is remarkable that,
together with theſe epiſtles to private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
he rejected alſo the catholic epiſtles.
Now the catholic epiſtles and the epiſtles to
private perſons agree in the circumſtance of
wanting this particular ſpecies of atteſtation.
Marcion, it ſeems, acknowledged the epiſtle
to Philemon, and is upbraided for his incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency
in doing ſo by Tertullian<note n="*" place="bottom">Lardner, vol. xiv. p. 455.</note>, who
aſks "why, when he received a letter writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to a ſingle perſon, he ſhould refuſe
two to Timothy and one to Titus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
upon the affairs of the church?"
This paſſage ſo far favours our account of
Marcion's objection, as it ſhows that the
objection was ſuppoſed by Tertullian to
have been founded in ſomething, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to the nature of a private letter.</p>
               <p>Nothing of the works of Marcion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains.
Probably he was, after all, a raſh,
arbitrary, licentious critic (if he deſerved
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:0539601100:397"/>
indeed the name of critic) and who offered
no reaſon for his determination. What St.
Jerome ſays of him intimates this, and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
founded in good ſenſe; ſpeaking of him
and Baſilides, "if they had aſſigned any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,"
ſays he, "why they did not reckon
theſe epiſtles," viz. the firſt and ſecond to
Timothy and the epiſtle to Titus, "to be
the apoſtle's, we would have endeavoured
to have anſwered them, and perhaps
might have ſatisfied the reader; but when
they take upon them, by their own au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
to pronounce one epiſtle to be
Paul's, and another not, they can only be
replied to in the ſame manner<note n="*" place="bottom">Lardner, vol. xiv. p. 458.</note>." Let it be
remembered, however, that Marcion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
ten of theſe epiſtles. His authority
therefore, even if his credit had been better
than it is, forms a very ſmall exception to
the uniformity of the evidence. Of Baſilides
we know ſtill leſs than we do of Marcion.
The ſame obſervation however belongs to
him, viz. that his objection, as far as appears
from this paſſage of St. Jerome, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:0539601100:398"/>
to the three private epiſtles. Yet is
this the only opinion which can be ſaid to
diſturb the conſent of the two firſt centuries
of the Chriſtian aera; for as to Tatian, who
is reported by Jerome alone to have reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſome of St. Paul's epiſtles, the extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
or rather delirious notions into which
he fell, take away all weight and credit from
his judgment. If, indeed, Jerome's account
of this circumſtance be correct; for it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
from much older writers than Jerome,
that Tatian owned and uſed many of theſe
epiſtles<note n="*" place="bottom">Lardner, vol. i. p. 313.</note>.</p>
               <p n="2">II. They, who in thoſe ages diſputed about
ſo many other points, agreed in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
the ſcriptures now before us. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
ſects appealed to them in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies
with equal and unreſerved ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.
When they were urged by one
ſide, however they might be interpreted or
miſinterpreted by the other, their authority
was not queſtioned: "Reliqui omnes," ſays
Irenaeus, ſpeaking of Marcion, "falſo ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiae
nomine inflati, ſcripturas quidem
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:0539601100:399"/>
confitentur, interpretationes vero conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunt<note n="*" place="bottom">Iren. adverſ. Haer. quoted by Lardner, vol. xv. p. 425.</note>."</p>
               <p n="3">III. When the genuineneſs of ſome other
writings which were in circulation, and
even of a few which are now received into
the canon, was conteſted, theſe were never
called into diſpute. Whatever was the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
or whether, in truth, there ever was
any real objection to the authenticity of the
ſecond epiſtle of Peter, the ſecond and third
of John, the epiſtle of James, or that of
Jude, or to the book of the Revelations of
St. John, the doubts that appear to have
been entertained concerning them, exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
ſtrengthen the force of the teſtimony
as to thoſe writings, about which there was
no doubt; becauſe it ſhows, that the matter
was a ſubject, amongſt the early Chriſtians,
of examination and diſcuſſion; and that,
where there was any room to doubt, they
did doubt.</p>
               <p>What Euſebius hath left upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
is directly to the purpoſe of this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.
Euſebius, it is well known, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:0539601100:400"/>
the eccleſiaſtical writings which were
extant in his time into three claſſes; the
"<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> uncontradicted," as he calls
them in one chapter; or "ſcriptures uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally
acknowledged," as he calls them
in another; the "controverted, yet well
known and approved by many;" and
"the ſpurious." What were the ſhades of
difference in the books of the ſecond, or in
thoſe of the third claſs; or what it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely
that he meant by the term <hi>ſpurious,</hi> it
is not neceſſary in this place to enquire.
It is ſufficient for us to find, that the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
epiſtles of St. Paul are placed by him

IV. That no ancient writing, which is
atteſted as theſe epiſtles are, hath had its
authenticity diſproved, or is in fact queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.
The controverſies which have been
moved concerning ſuſpected writings, as the
epiſtles, for inſtance, of Phalaris, or the
eighteen epiſtles of Cicero, begin by ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that this atteſtation is wanting. That
being proved, the queſtion is thrown back
upon internal marks of ſpuriouſneſs or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticity;
and in theſe the diſpute is occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied.
In which diſputes it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
that the conteſted writings are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
attacked by arguments drawn from
ſome oppoſition which they betray to "au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic
hiſtory," to "true epiſtles," to "the
real ſentiments or circumſtances of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
whom they perſonate<note n="*" place="bottom">See the tracts written in the controverſy between Tunſtal and Middleton upon certain ſuſpected epiſtles aſcribed to Cicero.</note>;" which au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic
hiſtory, which true epiſtles, which
real ſentiments themſelves, are no other
than ancient documents, whoſe early exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and reception can be proved, in the
manner in which the writings before us
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:0539601100:402"/>
are traced up to the age of their reputed
author, or to ages near to his. A modern
who ſits down to compoſe the hiſtory of
ſome ancient period, has no ſtronger evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to appeal to for the moſt confident
aſſertion, or the moſt undiſputed fact, that
he delivers, than writings, whoſe genuine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is proved by the ſame medium through
which we evince the authenticity of ours.
Nor, whilſt he can have recourſe to ſuch
authorities as theſe, does he apprehend any
uncertainty in his accounts, from the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion
of ſpuriouſneſs or impoſture in his
materials.</p>
               <p n="5">V. It cannot be ſhown that any forgeries
properly ſo called<note n="*" place="bottom">I believe that there is a great deal of truth in Dr. Lardner's obſervations, that comparatively few of thoſe books, which we call apocryphal, were ſtrictly and originally forgeries. See Lardner, vol. xii. p. 167.</note>, that is, writings pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
under the name of the perſon who
did not compoſe them, made their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
in the firſt century of the Chriſtian aera,
in which century theſe epiſtles undoubtedly
exiſted. I ſhall ſet down under this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
the guarded words of Lardner him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:0539601100:403"/>
"There are no quotations of any of
them (ſpurious and apocryphal books) in
the apoſtolical fathers, by whom I mean
Barnabas, Clement of Rome, Hermas,
Ignatius, and Polycarp, whoſe writings
reach from the year of our Lord 70 to
the year 108. <hi>I ſay this confidently, becauſe
I think it has been proved.</hi>" Lardner,
vol. xii. p. 158.</p>
               <p>Nor when they did appear were they
much uſed by the primitive Chriſtians,
"Irenaeus quotes not any of theſe books.
He mentions ſome of them, but he never
quotes them. The ſame may be ſaid of
Tertullian: he has mentioned a book
called "Acts of Paul and Thecla;" but it is
only to condemn it. Clement of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria
and Origen have mentioned and quot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſeveral ſuch books, but never as autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and ſometimes with expreſs marks of
diſlike. Euſebius quotes no ſuch books
in any of his works. He has mentioned
them indeed, but how? Not by way of
approbation, but to ſhow that they were
of little or no value; and that they never
were received by the ſounder part of
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:0539601100:404"/>
Chriſtians." Now, if with this, which is
advanced after the moſt minute and diligent
examination, we compare what the ſame
cautious writer had before ſaid of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
ſcriptures, "that in the works of
three only of the above-mentioned fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
there are more and larger quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the ſmall volume of the New
Teſtament, than of all the works of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero
in the writers of all characters for
ſeveral ages;" and if, with the marks of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity
or condemnation, which accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
the mention of the ſeveral apocryphal
Chriſtian writings, when they happened
to be mentioned at all, we contraſt what
Dr. Lardner's work completely and in detail
makes out concerning the writings which
we defend, and what, having ſo made out,
he thought himſelf authorized in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
to aſſert, that theſe books were not
only received from the beginning, but
received with the greateſt reſpect; have
been publickly and ſolemnly read in the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies
of Chriſtians throughout the world,
in every age from that time to this; early
tranſlated into the languages of divers coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:0539601100:405"/>
and people; commentaries writ to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
and illuſtrate them; quoted by way
of proof in all arguments of a religious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
recommended to the peruſal of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
as containing the authentic account
of the Chriſtian doctrine; when we attend,
I ſay, to this repreſentation, we perceive in
it, not only full proof of the early notoriety
of theſe books, but a clear and ſenſible line
of diſcrimination, which ſeparates theſe from
the pretenſions of any others.</p>
               <p>The epiſtles of St. Paul ſtand particularly
free of any doubt or confuſion that might
ariſe from this ſource. Until the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the fourth century, no intimation
appears of any attempt whatever being
made to counterfeit theſe writings; and
then it appears only of a ſingle and obſcure
inſtance. Jerome, who flouriſhed in the
year 392, has this expreſſion: "Legunt qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
et ad Laodicenſes; ſed ab omnibus
exploditur;" there is alſo an epiſtle to the
Laodiceans, but it is rejected by every
body<note n="*" place="bottom">Lardner, vol. x. p. 103.</note>. Theodoret, who wrote in the year
423, ſpeaks of this epiſtle in the ſame
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:0539601100:406"/>
terms<note n="*" place="bottom">Lardner, vol. xi. p. 88.</note>. Beſide theſe I know not whether
any ancient writer mentions it. It was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
unnoticed during the three firſt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies
of the church; and when it came af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
to be mentioned, it was mentioned
only to ſhow, that, though ſuch a writing
did exiſt, it obtained no credit. It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
that the forgery to which Jerome al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes,
is the epiſtle which we now have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that title. If ſo, as hath been already
obſerved, it is nothing more than a collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſentences from the genuine epiſtles;
and was perhaps, at firſt, rather the exerciſe
of ſome idle pen, than any ſerious attempt
to impoſe a forgery upon the public. Of
an epiſtle to the Corinthians under St. Paul's
name, which was brought into Europe in
the preſent century, antiquity is entirely ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.
It was unheard of for ſixteen cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies;
and at this day, though it be extant,
and was firſt found in the Armenian lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
it is not, by the Chriſtians of that
country, received into their ſcriptures. I
hope, after this, that there is no reader who
will think there is any competition of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:0539601100:407"/>
or of external proof, between theſe and
the received epiſtles; or rather who will
not acknowledge the evidence of authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
to be confirmed by the want of ſucceſs
which attended impoſture.</p>
               <p>When we take into our hands the letters
which the ſuffrage and conſent of antiquity
hath thus tranſmitted to us, the firſt thing
that ſtrikes our attention is the air of reality
and buſineſs, as well as of ſeriouſneſs and
conviction, which pervades the whole. Let
the ſceptic read them. If he be not ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of theſe qualities in them, the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
can have no weight with him. If he
be; if he perceive in almoſt every page the
language of a mind, actuated by real occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
and operating upon real circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
I would wiſh it to be obſerved, that
the proof which ariſes from this perception
is not to be deemed occult or imaginary,
becauſe it is incapable of being drawn out
in words, or of being conveyed to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
of the reader in any other way,
than by ſending him to the books them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>And here, in its proper place, comes in
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:0539601100:408"/>
the argument which it has been the office of
theſe pages to unfold. St. Paul's epiſtles
are connected with his hiſtory by their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularity,
and by the numerous circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
which are found in them. When
we deſcend to an examination and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion
of theſe circumſtances, we not only
obſerve the hiſtory and the epiſtles to be
independent documents, unknown to, or at
leaſt unconſulted by, each other, but we find
the ſubſtance, and oftentimes very minute
articles, of the hiſtory, recognized in the
epiſtles, by alluſions and references, which
can neither be imputed to <hi>deſign,</hi> nor, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a foundation in truth, be accounted for
by accident, by hints and expreſſions and
ſingle words dropping as it were fortui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſly
from the pen of the writer, or drawn
forth, each by ſome occaſion proper to the
place in which it occurs, but widely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
from any view to conſiſtency or
agreement. Theſe, we know, are effects
which reality naturally produces, but which,
without reality at the bottom, can hardly
be conceived to exiſt.</p>
               <p>When therefore, with a body of external
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:0539601100:409"/>
evidence, which is relied upon, and which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
proves may ſafely be relied upon, in
appreciating the credit of ancient writings,
we combine characters of genuineneſs and
originality which are not found, and which,
in the nature and order of things, cannot be
expected to be found in ſpurious compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions;
whatever difficulties we may meet
with in other topics of the Chriſtian evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
we can have little in yielding our
aſſent to the following concluſions: that
there was ſuch a perſon as St. Paul; that he
lived in the age which we aſcribe to him;
that he went about preaching the religion of
which Jeſus Chriſt was the founder; and that
the letters which we now read were actually
written by him upon the ſubject, and in the
courſe, of that his miniſtry.</p>
               <p>And if it be true that we are in poſſeſſion of
the very letters which St. Paul wrote, let us
conſider what confirmation they afford to
the Chriſtian hiſtory. In my opinion they
ſubſtantiate the whole tranſaction. The
great object of modern reſearch is to come at
the epiſtolary correſpondence of the times.
A midſt the obſcurities, the ſilence, or the
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:0539601100:410"/>
contradictions of hiſtory, if a letter can be
found, we regard it as the diſcovery of a
land-mark; as that by which we can correct,
adjuſt, or ſupply the imperfections and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties
of other accounts. One cauſe
of the ſuperior credit which is attributed to
letters is this, that the facts which they
diſcloſe generally come out <hi>incidentally,</hi> and
therefore without deſign to miſlead the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
by falſe or exaggerated accounts. This
reaſon may be applied to St. Paul's epiſtles
with as much juſtice as to any letters what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
Nothing could be farther from the
intention of the writer than to record any
part of his hiſtory. That his hiſtory was
<hi>in fact</hi> made public by theſe letters, and has
by the ſame means been tranſmitted to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ages, is a ſecondary and unthought of
effect. The ſincerity therefore of the
apoſtle's declarations cannot reaſonably be
diſputed; at leaſt we are ſure that it was not
vitiated by any deſire of ſetting himſelf off
to the public at large. But theſe letters
form a part of the muniments of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
as much to be valued for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,
as for their originality. A more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:0539601100:411"/>
treaſure the care of antiquity could
not have ſent down to us. Beſide the proof
they afford of the general reality of St.
Paul's hiſtory, of the knowledge which the
author of the Acts of the Apoſtles had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
of that hiſtory, and the conſequent
probability that he was, what he profeſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to have been, a companion of the apoſtle's;
beſide the ſupport they lend to theſe impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
inferences, they meet ſpeciſically ſome
of the principal objections upon which
the adverſaries of Chriſtianity have thought
proper to rely. In particular they ſhow,</p>
               <p n="1">I. That Chriſtianity was not a ſtory ſet
on foot amidſt the confuſions which attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and immediately preceded the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Jeruſalem; when many extravagant
reports were circulated, when men's minds
were broken by terror and diſtreſs, when
amidſt the tumults that ſurrounded them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
was impracticable. Theſe letters ſhow
inconteſtably that the religion had ſixed and
eſtabliſhed itſelf before this ſtate of things
took place.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Whereas it hath been inſinuated, that
our goſpels may have been made up of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:0539601100:412"/>
and ſtories, which were current at the
time, we may obſerve that, with reſpect to
the epiſtles, this is impoſſible. A man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
write the hiſtory of his own life from
reports; nor, what is the ſame thing, be led
by reports to refer to paſſages and tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in which he ſtates himſelf to have been
immediately preſent and active. I do not
allow that this inſinuation is applied to the
hiſtorical part of the New Teſtament with
any colour of juſtice or probability; but
I ſay, that to the epiſtles it is not appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
at all.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Theſe letters prove that the converts
to Chriſtianity were not drawn from the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous,
the mean, or the ignorant ſet of
men, which the repreſentations of infidelity
would ſometimes make them. We learn
from letters the character not only of the
writer, but, in ſome meaſure, of the perſons
to whom they are written. To ſuppoſe
that theſe letters were addreſſed to a rude
tribe, incapable of thought or reflection,
is juſt as reaſonable as to ſuppoſe Locke's
Eſſay on the Human Underſtanding to have
been written for the inſtruction of ſavages.
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:0539601100:413"/>
Whatever may be thought of theſe letters
in other reſpects, either of diction or argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
they are certainly removed as far as
poſſible from the habits and comprehenſion
of a barbarous people.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. St. Paul's hiſtory, I mean ſo much of
it as may be collected from his letters, is ſo
<hi>implicated</hi> with that of the other apoſtles,
and with the ſubſtance indeed of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
hiſtory itſelf, that I apprehend it will
be found impoſſible to admit St. Paul's ſtory
(I do not ſpeak of the miraculous part of it)
to be true, and yet to reject the reſt as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous.
For inſtance, can any one believe
that there was ſuch a man as Paul, a preacher
of Chriſtianity in the age which we aſſign to
him, and <hi>not</hi> believe that there were alſo at
the ſame time ſuch men as Peter and James,
and other apoſtles, who had been compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of Chriſt during his life, and who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his death publiſhed and avowed the
ſame things concerning him which Paul
taught? Judea, and eſpecially Jeruſalem,
was the ſcene of Chriſt's miniſtry. The
witneſſes of his miracles lived there. St.
Paul, by his own account, as well as that of
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:0539601100:414"/>
his hiſtorian, appears to have frequently vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited
this city; to have carried on a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
with the church there; to have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociated
with the rulers and elders of that
church, who were ſome of them apoſtles;
to have acted, as occaſions offered, in corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence,
and ſometimes in conjuntion
with them. Can it, after this, be doubted,
but that the religion and the general facts
relating to it, which St. Paul appears by his
letters to have delivered to the ſeveral
churches which he eſtabliſhed at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
were, at the ſame time, taught and
publiſhed at Jeruſalem itſelf, the place where
the buſineſs was tranſacted; and taught and
publiſhed by thoſe who had attended the
founder of the inſtitution in his miraculous,
or pretendedly miraculous, miniſtry?</p>
               <p>It is obſervable, for ſo it appears both in
the epiſtles and from the Acts of the Apoſtles,
that Jeruſalem, and the ſociety of believers
in that city, long continued the centre from
which the miſſionaries of the religion iſſued,
with which all other churches maintained a
correſpondence and connection, to which
they referred their doubts, and to whoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:0539601100:415"/>
in times of public diſtreſs, they remitted
their charitable aſſiſtance. This obſervation
I think material, becauſe it proves that this
was not the caſe of giving out accounts in
one country of what is tranſacted in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
without affording the hearers an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of knowing whether the things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
were credited by any, or even publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
in the place where they are reported to
have paſſed.</p>
               <p n="5">V. St. Paul's letters furniſh evidence (and
what better evidence than a man's own let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
can be deſired?) of the ſoundneſs and
ſobriety of his judgment. His caution in
diſtinguiſhing between the occaſional ſuggeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of inſpiration, and the ordinary exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of his natural underſtanding, is without
example in the hiſtory of human enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm.
His morality is every where calm,
pure, and rational; adapted to the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the activity, and the buſineſs of ſocial
life, and of its various relations; free from
the over-ſcrupulouſneſs and auſterities of
ſuperſtition, and from, what was more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
to be apprehended, the abſtractions of
quietiſm, and the ſoarings or extravagancies
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:0539601100:416"/>
of fanaticiſm. His judgment concerning a
heſitating conſcience; his opinion of the
moral indifferency of many actions, yet of
the prudence and even the duty of compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
where non-compliance would produce
evil effects upon the minds of the perſons
who obſerved it, is as correct and juſt as
the moſt liberal and enlightened moraliſt
could form at this day. The accuracy of
modern ethics has found nothing to amend
in theſe determinations.</p>
               <p>What Lord Lyttelton has remarked of the
preference aſcribed by St. Paul to inward
rectitude of principle above every other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
accompliſhment, is very material, to
our preſent purpoſe. "In his firſt epiſtle
to the Corinthians, ch. xiii. ver. 1-3,
St. Paul has theſe words: <hi>Though I ſpeak
with the tongues of men and of angels, and
have not charity, I am become as ſounding
braſs, or a tinkling cymbal. And though I have
the gift of prophecy, and underſtand all myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries
and all knowledge, and though I have
all faith, ſo that I could remove mountains,
and have not charity, I am nothing. And
though I beſtow all my goods to feed the poor,</hi>
                  <pb n="413" facs="tcp:0539601100:417"/>
                  <hi>and though I give my body to be burned,
and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.</hi>
Is this the language of enthuſiaſm?
Did ever enthuſiaſt prefer that univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
benevolence which comprehendeth
all moral virtues, and which, as appeareth
by the following verſes, is meant by cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
here; did ever enthuſiaſt, I ſay, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
that benevolence" (which we may add
is attainable by every man) "to faith and
to miracles, to thoſe religious opinions
which he had embraced, and to thoſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
graces and gifts which he
imagined he had acquired; nay even to
the merit of martyrdom? Is it not the
genius of enthuſiaſm to ſet moral virtues
infinitely below the merit of faith; and of
all moral virtues to value that leaſt which
is moſt particularly enforced by St. Paul,
a ſpirit of candour, moderation, and
peace? Certainly neither the temper nor
the opinions of a man ſubject to fanatic
deluſions are to be found in this paſſage."—Lord
Lyttelton's Conſiderations on the
Converſion, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I ſee no reaſon therefore to queſtion the
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:0539601100:418"/>
integrity of his underſtanding. To call him
a viſionary, becauſe he appealed to viſions;
or an enthuſiaſt, becauſe he pretended to
inſpiration, is to take the whole queſtion for
granted. It is to take for granted that no
ſuch viſions or inſpirations exiſted; at leaſt
it is to aſſume, contrary to his own aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that he had no other proofs than theſe
to offer of his miſſion, or of the truth of his
relations.</p>
               <p>One thing I allow, that his letters every
where diſcover great zeal and earneſtneſs in
the cauſe in which he was engaged; that is
to ſay, he was convinced of the truth of
what he taught; he was deeply impreſſed,
but not more ſo than the occaſion merited,
with a ſenſe of its importance. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
a correſponding animation and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude
in the exerciſe of his miniſtry. But
would not theſe conſiderations, ſuppoſing
them to be well founded, have holden the
ſame place, and produced the ſame effect, in
a mind the ſtrongeſt and the moſt ſedate?</p>

               <p>We may ſeem to have accumulated texts
unneceſſarily; but beſide that the point,
which they are brought to prove, is of great
importance, there is this alſo to be remarked
in every one of the paſſages cited, that the
alluſion is drawn from the writer by the
argument or the occaſion; that the notice
which is taken of his ſufferings, and of the
ſuffering condition of Chriſtianity, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
incidental, and is dictated by no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of ſtating the facts themſelves. Indeed
they are not ſtated at all: they may rather
be ſaid to be aſſumed. This is a diſtinction
upon which we have relied a good deal in
former parts of this treatiſe; and where the
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:0539601100:422"/>
writer's information cannot be doubted, it
always, in my opinion, adds greatly to the
value and credit of the teſtimony.</p>
               <p>If any reader require from the apoſtle
more direct and explicit aſſertions of the
ſame thing, he will receive full ſatisfaction
in the following quotations.</p>
               <p>"Are they miniſters of Chriſt? (I ſpeak
as a fool) I am more; in labours more
abundant, in ſtripes above meaſure, in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
more frequent, in deaths oft. Of the
Jews five times received I forty ſtripes
ſave one; thrice was I beaten with rods,
once was I ſtoned; thrice I ſuffered ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck,
a night and a day I have been in
the deep; in journeyings often, in perils
of waters, in perils of robbers, in pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils
by mine own countrymen, in perils
by the heathen, in perils in the city, in
perils in the wilderneſs, in perils in the
ſea, in perils among falſe brethren; in
wearineſs and painfulneſs, in watchings
often, in hunger and thirſt, in faſtings
often, in cold and nakedneſs." 2 Cor.
chap. xi. ver. 23-28.</p>
               <p>Can it be neceſſary to add more? "I think
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:0539601100:423"/>
that God hath ſet forth us the apoſtles
laſt, as it were appointed to death; for we
are made a ſpectacle unto the world, and
to angels, and to men.—Even unto this
preſent hour we both hunger and thirſt,
and are naked, and are buffeted, and have
no certain dwelling-place, and labour,
working with our own hands: being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled,
we bleſs; being perſecuted, we ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
it; being defamed, we entreat: we are
made as the filth of the earth, and are
the off-ſcouring of all things unto this
day." 1 Cor. chap. iv. ver. 9-13. I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join
this paſſage to the former, becauſe it
extends to the other apoſtles of Chriſtianity
much of that which St. Paul declared con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
himſelf.</p>
               <p>In the following quotations, the reference
to the author's ſufferings is accompanied
with a ſpecification of time and place, and
with an appeal for the truth of what he
declares to the knowledge of the perſons
whom he addreſſes: "Even after that we
had ſuffered before, and were ſhamefully
entreated, <hi>as ye know, at Philippi,</hi> we were
bold in our God to ſpeak unto you the
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:0539601100:424"/>
goſpel of God with much contention."
1 Theſſ. chap. ii. ver. 2.</p>
               <p>"But <hi>thou haſt fully known</hi> my doctrine,
manner of life, purpoſe, faith, long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
perſecutions, afflictions, which came
to me <hi>at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lyſtra</hi>;
what perſecutions I endured: but out of
them all the Lord delivered me." 2 Tim.
chap. iii. ver. 10, 11.</p>
               <p>I apprehend that to this point, as far as
the teſtimony of St. Paul is credited, the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
from his letters is complete and full.
It appears under every form in which it
could appear, by occaſional alluſions and by
direct aſſertions, by general declarations and
by ſpecific examples.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. St. Paul in theſe letters aſſerts, in poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive

               <p>Theſe words, ſigns, wonders, and mighty

<pb n="422" facs="tcp:0539601100:426"/>
the ſpecific appropriate terms throughout
the New Teſtament, employed when public
ſenſible miracles are intended to be expreſſed.
This will appear by conſulting, amongſt other
places, the texts referred to in the note<note n="*" place="bottom">Mark, xvi. 20. Luke, xxiii. 8. John, ii. 11, 23; iii. 2; iv. 48, 54; xi. 49. Acts, ii. 22; iv. 30; v. 12; vi. 8; vii. 16; xiv. 3; xv. 12. Heb. ii. 4.</note>;
and it cannot be ſhown that they are ever
employed to expreſs any thing elſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, theſe words not only denote
miracles as oppoſed to natural effects, but
they denote viſible, and what may be called
external, miracles, as diſtinguiſhed,</p>
               <p>Firſt, from <hi>inſpiration.</hi> If St. Paul had
meant to refer only to ſecret illuminations
of his underſtanding, or ſecret influences
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:0539601100:427"/>
upon his will or affections, he could not,
with truth, have repreſented them as "ſigns
and wonders <hi>wrought</hi> by him," of "ſigns
and wonders and mighty deeds wrought
<hi>amongſt</hi> them."</p>
               <p>Secondly, from <hi>viſions.</hi> Theſe would
not, by any means, ſatisfy the force of the
terms, "ſigns, wonders, and mighty deeds;"
ſtill leſs could they be ſaid to be "<hi>wrought</hi>
by him," or "wrought <hi>amongſt</hi> them:"
nor are theſe terms and expreſſions any
where applied to viſions. When our author
alludes to the ſupernatural communications
which he had received, either by viſion or
otherwiſe, he uſes expreſſions ſuited to the
nature of the ſubject, but very different
from the words which we have quoted. He
calls them revelations, but never ſigns,
wonders, or mighty deeds. "I will come,"
ſays he, "to viſions and <hi>revelations</hi> of the
Lord;" and then proceeds to deſcribe a
particular inſtance, and afterwards adds,
"leſt I ſhould be exalted above meaſure
through the abundance of the revelations,
there was given me a thorn in the fleſh."</p>
               <p>Upon the whole, the matter admits of no
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:0539601100:428"/>
ſoftening qualification, or ambiguity what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
If St. Paul did not work actual, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
public miracles, he has knowingly, in
theſe letters, born his teſtimony to a falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.
I need not add, that, in two alſo
of the quotations, he has advanced his aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the face of thoſe perſons amongſt
whom he declares the miracles to have been
wrought.</p>
               <p>Let it be remembered that the Acts of the
Apoſtles deſcribe various particular miracles
wrought by St. Paul, which in their nature
anſwer to the terms and expreſſions which
we have ſeen to be uſed by St. Paul himſelf.</p>
               <p>Here then we have a man of liberal at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments,
and in other points of ſound
judgment, who had addicted his life to the
ſervice of the goſpel. We ſee him, in the
proſecution of his purpoſe, travelling from
country to country, enduring every ſpecies
of hardſhip, encountering every extremity
of danger, aſſaulted by the populace, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
by the magiſtrates, ſcourged, beat,
ſtoned, left for dead; expecting, whenever
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:0539601100:429"/>
he came, a renewal of the ſame treatment,
and the ſame dangers, yet, when driven
from one city, preaching in the next; ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his whole time in the employment, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing
to it his pleaſures, his eaſe, his
ſafety; perſiſting in this courſe to old age,
unaltered by the experience of perverſeneſs,
ingratitude, prejudice, deſertion; unſubdued
by anxiety, want, labour, perſecutions; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied
by long confinement, undiſmayed
by the proſpect of death. Such was St.
Paul. We have his letters in our hands:
we have alſo a hiſtory purporting to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by one of his fellow-travellers, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing,
by a compariſon with theſe letters,
certainly to have been written by ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
well acquainted with the tranſactions of
his life. From the letters, as well as from
the hiſtory, we gather not only the account
which we have ſtated of <hi>him,</hi> but that he
was one out of many who acted and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
in the ſame manner; and that, of
thoſe who did ſo, ſeveral had been the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
of Chriſt's miniſtry, the ocular wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
or pretending to be ſuch, of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
and of his reſurrection. We more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:0539601100:430"/>
find this ſame perſon referring in his
letters to his ſupernatural converſion, the
particulars and accompanying circumſtances
of which are related in the hiſtory, and
which accompanying circumſtances, if all or
any of them be true, render it impoſſible to
have been a deluſion. We alſo find him po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively,
and in appropriated terms, aſſerting,
that he himſelf worked miracles, ſtrictly and
properly ſo called, in ſupport of the miſſion
which he executed; the hiſtory, meanwhile,
recording various paſſages of his miniſtry,
which come up to the extent of this aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The queſtion is, whether falſehood was
ever atteſted by evidence like this. Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods,
we know, have found their way into
reports, into tradition, into books: but is an
example to be met with, of a man volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily
undertaking a life of want and pain,
of inceſſant fatigue, of continual peril; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
to the loſs of his home and country,
to ſtripes and ſtoning, to tedious impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the conſtant expectation of a
violent death, for the ſake of carrying about
a ſtory of what was falſe, and of what, if
falſe, he muſt have known to be ſo?</p>
