            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>—IN my way to the north from <hi>Hagley</hi> I paſſed thro' <hi>Dovedale</hi>; and to ſay the truth, was diſappointed in it. When I came to <hi>Buxton,</hi> I viſited another or two of their romantic ſcenes; but theſe are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to <hi>Dovedale.</hi> They are but poor mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niatures of KESWICK; which exceeds them more in grandeur than I can give you to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>han in grandeur.</p>
            <p>Inſtead of the narrow ſlip of valley which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s ſeen at <hi>Dovedale,</hi> you have at KESWICK a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> noble living lake, ten miles round, of an
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0721900700:3"/>
oblong form, adorned with variety of wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed iſlands. The rocks indeed of <hi>Dovedale</hi> are finely wild, pointed, and irregular; but the hills are both little and unanimated; and the margin of the brook is poorly edg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with weeds, moraſs, and bruſhwood.— But at KESWICK, you will, on one ſide of the lake, ſee a rich and beautiful landſkip of cultivated fields, riſing to the eye in fine inequalities, with noble groves of oak, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily diſperſed; and climbing the adjacent hills, ſhade above ſhade, in the moſt vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and pictureſque forms. On the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite ſhore, you will find rocks and cliffs of ſtupendous height, hanging broken over the lake in horrible grandeur, ſome of them a thouſand feet high, the woods climbing up their ſteep and ſhaggy ſides, where mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal foot never yet approached. On theſe dreadful heights the eagles build their neſts: A variety of waterfalls are ſeen pouring from their ſummits, and tumbling in vaſt ſheets from rock to rock in rude and terrible magnificence: While on all ſides of this immenſe amphitheatre the lofty mountains riſe round, piercing the clouds in ſhapes as ſpiry and fantaſtic, as the very rocks of <hi>Dovedale.</hi>—To this I muſt add
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0721900700:4"/>
the frequent and bold projection of the cliffs into the lake, forming noble bays and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montories: In other parts they finely retire from it, and often open in abrupt chaſms or clefts, thro' which at hand, you ſee rich and cultivated vales, and beyond theſe at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious diſtances, mountain riſing over moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; among which, new proſpects preſent themſelves in miſt, till the eye is loſt in an agreeable perplexity:
<q>
                  <l>Where active Fancy travels beyond Senſe,</l>
                  <l>And pictures things unſeen.—</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Were I to analyſe the two places into their conſtituent principles, I ſhould tell you that the full perfection of KESWICK conſiſts of three circumſtances, <hi>Beauty, Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,</hi> and <hi>Immenſity</hi> united; the ſecond of which is alone found in <hi>Dovedale.</hi> Of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it hath little: Nature having left it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a deſart: Neither its ſmall extent, nor the diminutive and lifeleſs form of the hills admit magnificence.—But to give you a complete idea of theſe three perfections, as they are joined in KESWICK, would require the united powers of <hi>Claude, Salvator,</hi> and <hi>Pouſſin.</hi> The firſt ſhould throw his delicate ſunſhine over the cultivated vales, the ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0721900700:5"/>
cots, the groves, the lake, and wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed iſlands. The ſecond ſhould daſh out the horror of the rugged cliffs, the ſteeps, the hanging woods, and foaming waterfalls; while the grand pencil of <hi>Pouſſin</hi> ſhould crown the whole with the majeſty of the impending mountains.</p>
            <p>So much for what I would call the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent</hi> beauties of this aſtoniſhing ſcene. Were I not afraid of being tireſome, I could now dwell as long on its <hi>varying</hi> or <hi>acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> beauties. I would ſail round the lake, anchor in every bay, and land you on every promontory and iſland. I would point out the perpetual change of proſpect: The woods, rocks, cliffs, and mountains, by turns vaniſhing or riſing into view: Now gaining on the ſight, hanging over our heads in their full dimenſions, beautifully dreadful; and now, by a change of ſituation, aſſuming new romantic ſhapes, retiring and leſſening on the eye, and inſenſibly loſing themſelves in an azure miſt. I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark the contraſt of light and ſhade, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the morning and evening ſun; the one gilding the weſtern, and the other the eaſtern ſide of this immenſe amphithea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre; while the vaſt ſhadow projected by the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0721900700:6"/>
mountains buries the oppoſite part in a deep and purple gloom, which the eye can hardly penetrate: The natural variety of colouring which the ſeveral objects produce is no leſs wonderful and pleaſing: The rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tincts in the valley being thoſe of azure, green, and gold, yet ever various, ariſing from an intermixture of the lake, the woods, the graſs, and corn-fields: Theſe are fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contraſted by the grey rocks and cliffs; and the whole heightened by the yellow ſtreams of light, the purple hues, and miſty azure of the mountains. Sometimes a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene air and clear ſky diſcloſe the tops of the higheſt hills: At others, you ſee clouds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving their ſummits, reſting on their ſides, or deſcending to their baſe, and rolling among the vallies, as in a vaſt furnace.— When the winds are high, they roar among the cliffs and caverns like peals of thunder; then, too, the clouds are ſeen in vaſt bodies ſweeping along the hills in gloomy great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, while the lake joins the tumult and toſſes like a ſea: But in calm weather the whole ſcene becomes new: The lake is a perfect mirror; and the landſkip in all its beauty, iſlands, fields, woods, rocks, and mountains, are ſeen inverted, and floating
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0721900700:7"/>
on its ſurface. I will now carry you to the top of a cliff, where if you dare approach the ridge, a new ſcene of aſtoniſhment pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents itſelf, where the valley, lake, and iſlands, ſeem laying at your feet; where this expanſe of water appears diminiſhed to a little pool amidſt the vaſt immeaſureable objects that ſurround it; for here the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of more diſtant hill appear before thoſe you had already ſeen; and riſing behind each other in ſucceſſive ranges and azure groups of craggy and broken ſteeps, form an immenſe and awful picture, which can only be expreſſed by the image of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous ſea of mountains.—Let me now conduct you down again to the valley, and conclude with one circumſtance more; which is, that a walk by ſtill moon-light (at which time the diſtant water-falls are heard in all their variety of ſound) among theſe inchanting dales, opens a ſcene of ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate beauty, repoſe, and ſolemnity, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds all deſcription.</p>
