            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>A Juſt Concern for Truth, and the Firſt
Principles of the Chriſtian Religion,
was the only Motive that engag'd me
in the Examination of your Lordſhip's
Docrines in a Former Letter to your Lordſhip.
And the ſame Motive, I hope, will be thought
a ſufficient Apology for my preſuming to give
your Lordſhip the Trouble of a Second Letter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amongſt the Vain Contemptible Things,
whereof your Lordſhip would create an Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in the Layity, are, the</hi> Trifles <hi>and</hi> Niceties
of Authoritative Benedictions, Abſolutions, Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications.
<note n="*" place="bottom">Preſervative, <hi>p.</hi> 98.</note> 
               <hi>Again, you ſay, that</hi> to expect the
Grace of God from any Hands, but his own, is to
affront him—<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 89.</note>. <hi>And</hi> that all depends upon God
and our ſelves; That Human Benedictions, Human
Abſolutions, Human Excommunications, have nothing
to do with the Favour of God.<note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 101.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It is evident from theſe Maxims (for your
Lordſhip aſſerts them as ſuch) that whatever In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions
are obſerved in any Chriſtian Society,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1141100300:4"/>
upon this Suppoſition, that thereby Grace is
conferr'd thro' <hi>Human Hands,</hi> or by the Miniſtry
of the Clergy, ſuch Inſtitutions ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd,
and are condemn'd by your Lordſhip,
as <hi>trifling, uſeleſs, and affronting to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is an <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> my Lord, in the <hi>yet</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh'd
Church of <hi>England,</hi> which we call <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation:</hi>
It is founded upon the expreſs Words
of Scripture, Primitive Obſervance, and the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal
Practice of all ſucceeding Ages in the
Church. The Deſign of this Inſtitution is, that
it ſhould be a Means of conferring Grace, by the
Prayer and Impoſition of the <hi>Biſhop's Hands</hi> on
thoſe who have been already Baptized. But yet
againſt all this Authority, both Divine and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and the expreſs Order of our own Church,
your Lordſhip teaches the Layity, <hi>that all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Benedictions are uſeleſs Niceties;</hi> and <hi>that to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
God's Grace from any Hands but his own, is to
affront him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If ſo, my Lord, what ſhall we ſay in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the Apoſtles? We read (<hi>Acts</hi> 8. 14.)
that when <hi>Philip</hi> the Deacon had baptiz'd the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans,</hi>
the Apoſtles ſent <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> to
them, who having pray'd, and <hi>laid their Hands on
them, they receiv'd the Holy Ghoſt, who before was
fallen upon none of them; only they were baptized in
the Name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Lord, ſeveral things are here out of Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion;
<hi>Firſt,</hi> That ſomething elſe, even in the
Apoſtolical Times, was neceſſary, beſides Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1141100300:5"/>
in order to qualifie Perſons to become com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
Members of the Body, or Partakers of the
Grace of Chriſt. They had been baptiz'd, yet
did not receive the Holy Ghoſt, till the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
Hands were laid upon them. 2<hi>dly,</hi> That
God's Graces are not only confer'd by means
of <hi>Human Hands;</hi> but of ſome particular Hands,
and not others. 3<hi>dly,</hi> That this Office was ſo
ſtrictly appropriated to the Apoſtles, or Chief
Governours of the Church, that it could not
be perform'd by Inſpir'd Men, tho' empower'd
to work Miracles, who were of an inferiour
Order; as <hi>Philip</hi> the Deacon. 4<hi>thly,</hi> That the
Power of the Apoſtles for the Performance of this
Ordinance, was intirely owing to their ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Degree in the Miniſtry; and not to any
extraordinary Gifts they were endow'd with:
For then <hi>Philip</hi> might have perform'd it; who
was not wanting in thoſe Gifts, being himſelf
an Evangeliſt, and Worker of Miracles: Which
is a Demonſtration, that his Incapacity aroſe
frorn his inferior Degree in the Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>And now, my Lord, are all <hi>Human Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
Niceties and Trifles?</hi> Are the Means of God's
Grace in his <hi>own Hands alone?</hi> Is it wicked,
and <hi>affronting to God,</hi> to ſuppoſe the contrary?
How then comes <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> to confer the
Holy Ghoſt by the Impoſition of their Hands?
How comes it, that they appropriate this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to themſelves? Is the Diſpenſation of
God's Grace in his <hi>own Hands alone?</hi> And yet
can it be diſpens'd to us by the Miniſtry of ſome
Perſons, and not by that of others?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:1141100300:6"/>
Were the Apoſtles ſo wicked, as to diſtinguiſh
themſelves by a Pretence to vain Powers, which
God had reſerv'd to himſelf? And which your
Lordſhip ſuppoſes from the Title of your <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative,</hi>
that it is inconſiſtent with <hi>Common
Senſe,</hi> to imagine that God would, or could have
communicated to Men.</p>
            <p>Had any of your Lordſhip's well-inſtructed
Layity liv'd in the Apoſtles Days, with what
Indignation muſt they have rejected this ſenſleſs
Chimerical <hi>Claim</hi> of the Apoſtles? They muſt
have ſaid, Why do you, <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>John,</hi> pretend
to this <hi>Blaſphemous Power? Whilſt we believe
the Goſpel, we cannot expect the Grace of God
from any Hands but his own.</hi> You give us the
<hi>Holy Ghoſt!</hi> You confer the Grace of God! Is
it not impious to think, that <hi>He ſhould make our
Improvement</hi> in Grace depend upon your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry;
or hang our Salvation on any <hi>particular</hi>
Order of Clergymen? We know, that God is
Juſt, and Good, and True, <hi>and that all</hi> depends
upon Him and our ſelves, and that <hi>Human Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictions</hi>
are <hi>Triſles.</hi> Therefore whether you
<hi>Peter,</hi> or you <hi>Philip,</hi> or both, or neither of you
lay <hi>your</hi> Hands upon us, we are neither better
nor worſe; but juſt in the <hi>ſame State of Grace</hi> as
we were before.</p>
            <p>This Repreſentation, has not one Syllable in
it, but what is founded in your Lordſhip's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and perfectly agreeable to it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:1141100300:7"/>
The late moſt Pious and Learned Biſhop
<hi>Beveridge</hi> has theſe remarkable Words upon <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation:</hi>
               <q>How any Biſhops in our Age
dare neglect ſo conſiderable a Part of their
Office, I know not; but fear, they will have
no good Account to give of it, <hi>when they come
to ſtand before God's Tribunal</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Firſt Volume of Sermons.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But we may juſtly, and therefore I hope, with
Decency, ask your Lordſhip, how you dare per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
this Part of your Office? For you have
condemn'd it as <hi>Trifling</hi> and <hi>Wicked;</hi> as <hi>Trifling,</hi>
becauſe it is an <hi>Human Benediction;</hi> as <hi>Wicked,</hi>
becauſe it ſuppoſes Grace confer'd by the <hi>Hands
of the Biſhop.</hi> If therefore any baptiz'd Perſons
ſhould come to your Lordſhip for Confirmation,
if you are <hi>ſincere</hi> in what you have deliver'd,
your Lordſhip ought, I humbly conceive, to make
them this Declaration.</p>
            <q>
               <p>My Friends, for the ſake of <hi>Decency</hi> and <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
I have taken upon me the Epiſcopal
Character; and, according to Cuſtom, which
has long prevaild againſt Common Sence,
am now to lay my Hands upon you: But, I
beſeech you, as you have any Regard to the
Truth of the Goſpel, or to the Honour of
God, not to imagine, there is any Thing in
this Action, more than an uſeleſs empty Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony:
For if you expect to have any Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Advantage from <hi>Human Benedictions,</hi> or
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1141100300:8"/>
to receive Grace from the Impoſition of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's
Hands, you affront God, and in effect,
renounce Chriſtianity.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Pray, my Lord conſider that Paſſage in the
Scripture, where the Apoſtle ſpeaks of</hi> Leaving
the Principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt, and going
on unto Perfection; not laying again the Foundation
of Repentance from dead Works, of Faith towards
God, of the Doctrine of Baptiſms, and of Laying on
of Hands, and of the Reſurrection of the Dead, and
of eternal Judgment,(<hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 12.)</p>
            <p>My Lord, here it is undeniably plain, that
this Laying on of Hands (which is with us
called <hi>Confirmation</hi>) is ſo fundamental a Part of
Chriſt's Religion, that it is called one of the
Firſt Principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt; and
is placed amongſt ſuch primary Truths, as the
Reſurrection of the Dead, and of Eternal Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>St.</hi> Cyprian <hi>ſpeaking of this Apoſtolical Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of Hands, ſays,</hi> The ſame is now pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd
with us; they who have been baptiz'd in the
Church, are brought to the Preſidents of the Church,
that by our Prayer and Impoſition of Hands, they
may receive the Holy Ghoſt, and be conſummated with
the Lord's Seal.</p>
            <p>And muſt we yet believe, that all <hi>Human Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictions</hi>
are Dreams, and the Impoſition of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Hands trifling and uſeleſs; and that to
expect God's Graces from them, is to affront
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1141100300:9"/>
him? Tho' the Scriptures expreſsly teach us,
that God confers his Grace by means of certain
<hi>particular Human Hands,</hi> and not of others; tho'
they tell us, this <hi>Human Benediction,</hi> this Laying
on of Hands, is one of the firſt Principles of
the Religion of Chriſt, and as much a Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
Doctrine as the Reſurrection of the Dead,
and Eternal Judgment; and tho' every Age
ſince that of the Apoſtles, has ſtrictly obſerv'd it
as ſuch, and the Authority of our own Church
ſtill requires the Obſervance of it?</p>
            <p>I come now, my Lord, to another Sacred and
Divine Inſtitution of Chriſt's Church, which
ſtands expos'd and condemn'd by your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's
Doctrine; and that is, the <hi>Ordination</hi> of
the Chriſtian Clergy; where, by means of an
Human Benediction, and the Impoſition of the
Biſhop's Hands, the Holy Ghoſt is ſuppoſed to be
confer'd on Perſons towards conſecrating them
for the Work of the Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>We find it conſtantly taught by the Scriptures,
that all Eccleſiaſtical Authority, and the Graces
whereby the Clergy are qualified and enabl'd to
exerciſe their Functions to the Benefit of the
Church, are the Gifts and Graces of the Holy
Spirit. Thus the Apoſtle exhorts the Elders <hi>to
take heed unto the Flock, over which the Holy Ghoſt
hath made them Overſeers,</hi> (Eph. 4. 7.) But how,
my Lord, had the Holy Ghoſt made them Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers,
but by the Laying on of the Apoſtles
Hands? They were not immediately call'd by
the Holy Ghoſt; but being conſecrated by <hi>ſuch
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1141100300:10"/>
Human Hands</hi> as had been authorized to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
they were as truly call'd by him, and
ſanctified with Grace for that Employment, as
if they had receiv'd an immediate or miraculous
Commiſſion. So again, St. <hi>Paul</hi> puts <hi>Timothy</hi> in
mind, <hi>to ſtir up the Gift of God that was in him,
by laying on of his Hands,</hi> (2 Tim. 2. 6.)</p>
            <p>And now, my Lord, if <hi>Human Benedictions</hi> be
ſuch idle <hi>Dreams</hi> arid <hi>Trifles;</hi> if it be <hi>affronting
to God,</hi> to expect his Graces from them, or
through <hi>Human Hands;</hi> do we not plainly want
new Scriptures? Muſt we not give up the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
as Furious High-Church Prelates, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd
to preſumptuous Claims, and talk'd of
conferring the Graces of God by their own
Hands? Was not this Doctrine as ſtrange and
unaccountable then, as at preſent? Was it
not as inconſiſtent with the Attributes and
Sovereignty of God at that time, to have
his Graces paſs through other Hands than his
own, as in any ſucceeding Age? Nay, my
Lord, where ſhall we find any Fathers or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
in the Primitive Church, but who own'd
and aſſerted theſe Powers? They that were ſo
ready to part with their Lives, rather than do
the leaſt Dishonour to God, or the Chiriſtian
Name, yet were all guilty of <hi>this horrid Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi>
in imagining that they were to bleſs in
God's Name; and that by the Benediction and
Laying on of the Biſhop's Hands, the Graces of
the Holy Ghoſt could be confer'd on any
Perſons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:1141100300:11"/>
Agreeable to the Sence of Scripture and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,
our Church uſes this Form of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<hi>The Biſhop laying his Hands on the Perſon's
Head, ſaith, Receive the Holy Ghoſt, for the Office
and Work of a Prieſt in the Church of God, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto thee, by the Impoſition of our Hands.</hi> From
this Form, it is plain, <hi>Firſt,</hi> that our Church
holds, that the Reception of the Holy Ghoſt is
neceſſary to conſtitute a Perſon a Chriſtian
Prieſt. 2<hi>dly,</hi> That the Holy Ghoſt is confer'd
through <hi>Human Hands.</hi> 3<hi>dly,</hi> That it is by the
Hands of a Biſhop that the Holy Ghoſt is
confer'd.</p>
            <p>If therefore your Lordſhip is right in your
Doctrine, the Church of <hi>England</hi> is evidently
moſt corrupt. For if it be diſhonourable and
affronting to God, to expect his Grace from any
Human Hands; it muſt of neceſſity be diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
and affronting to him, for a Biſhop to
pretend to confer it by his Hands. And can
that Church be any ways defended, that has e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh'd
ſuch an Iniquity by Law, and made
the Form of it ſo neceſſary? How can your
Lordſhip anſwer it to your Layity, for taking
the Character or Power of a Biſhop from ſuch
a Form of Words? You tell them, it is affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to God, to expect his Grace from <hi>Human
Hands;</hi> yet to qualifie your ſelf for a Biſhoprick,
you let Human Hands be laid on you, after a
manner which directly ſuppoſes you thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Holy Ghoſt! Is it wicked in them to
expect it from <hi>Human Hands?</hi> And is it leſs ſo in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1141100300:12"/>
your Lordſhip, to pretend to receive it from Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Hands? He that believes, it is affronting to
<hi>God,</hi> to expect his Grace from Human Hands,
muſt likewiſe believe, that our Form of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
which promiſes the Holy Ghoſt by the
<hi>Biſhop</hi>'s <hi>Hands,</hi> muſt be alſo affronting to God.
Certainly, he cannot be ſaid to be very jealous
of the Honour of God, who will ſubmit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to be made a Biſhop by a Form of Words
derogatory, upon his own Principles, to God's
Honour.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe your Lordſhip was to have been
conſecrated to the Office of a Biſhop by theſe
Words; <hi>Take thou Power to ſuſtain all things in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
given thee by my Hands.</hi> I ſuppoſe, your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
would think it intirely Unlawful to ſubmit
to the Form of ſuch an Ordination. But, <hi>my
Lord, receive thou the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> &amp;c. is as impious
a Form, according to your Lordſhip's Doctrine,
and equally injurious to the Eternal Power and
Godhead, as the other. For if the Grace of
God can only be had from <hi>his own</hi> Hands, would
it not be as innocent in the Biſhop to ſay, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
then Power to ſuſtain all things in Being,</hi> as to
ſay, <hi>Receive the Holy Ghoſt, by the Impoſition of my
Hands?</hi> And would not a Compliance with ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Form be equally unlawful? According to
your Doctrine, in each of them God's Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
is equally invaded; and therefore the Guilt
muſt be the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:1141100300:13"/>
It may alſo well be wonder'd, how your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
can accept of a Character, which is, or
ought to be chiefly diſtinguiſh'd by the Exerciſe
of that Power which you diſclaim, as in the
Offices of <hi>Confirmation</hi> and <hi>Ordination.</hi> For, my
Lord, where can be the Sincerity of ſaying,
<hi>Receive the Holy Ghoſt by the Impoſition of our Hands,</hi>
when you declare it affronting to God, to expect
it from any Hands but his own? Suppoſe your
Lordſhip had been preaching to the Layity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
owning any Authority in the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi>
and yet ſhould acquieſce in the Conditions of
being made a Biſhop in her Name, and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognizing
her Power: Could ſuch a Submiſſion
be conſiſtent with Sincerity? Here you forbid
the Layity to expect God's Grace from any
Hands but his; yet not only accept of an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
upon Suppoſition of the contrary Doctrine;
but oblige your ſelf, according to the Sence of
the Church wherein you are ordain'd a Biſhop,
to act frequently in direct Oppoſition to your
own Principles.</p>
            <p>So that, I think, it is undeniably plain, that
you have at once, my Lord, by theſe Doctrines
condemn'd the Scriptures, the Apoſtles, their
martyr'd Succeſſors, the Church of <hi>England</hi> and
your own Conduct; and have hereby given us
ſome reaſon (tho' I wiſh, there were no Occaſion
to mention it) to ſuſpect, whether you, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
of no other Church, but what is founded
in Sincerity, are your ſelf, really a Member of
any Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:1141100300:14"/>
I ſhall now proceed to ſay ſomething upon
the Conſecration of the Lord's Supper; which is
as much expos'd as a <hi>Trifle,</hi> by your Lordſhip's
Doctrine, as the other Inſtitutions. St. <hi>Paul</hi>
ſays. <hi>The Cup of Bleſſing which we bleſs, is it not
the Communion of the Blood of Chriſt?</hi> My Lord,
is not this Cup ſtill to be bleſs'd? Muſt there not
therefore be ſuch a thing as an <hi>Human Benediction?</hi>
And are Human Benedictions to be all deſpis'd,
though by them the Bread and Wine become
Means of Grace, and are made the Spiritual
Nouriſhment of our Souls? Can any one bleſs
this Cup? If not, then there is a Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Human Benedictions: Some are authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
by God, and their Bleſſing is effectual;
whilſt others, only are vain and preſumptuous. If
the Prayer over the Elements, and the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration,
be only a Trifle and a Dream; and it
be offenſive to God, to expect they are conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into Means of Grace by an Human Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
why then did St. <hi>Paul</hi> pretend to bleſs
them? Why did he make it the Privilege of the
Church? Or, why do we keep up the ſame
Solemnity? But if it be to be bleſs'd only by
God's Miniſters, then how can your Lordſhip
anſwer it to God, for ridiculing and abuſing
Human Benedictions; and telling the World,
that a particular Order of the Clergy are not of
any neceſſity, nor can be of any Advantage to
them. For if the Sacrament can only be bleſs'd
by God's Miniſters; then ſuch Miniſters are as
neceſſary, as the Sacraments themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:1141100300:15"/>
St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, the Cup muſt be bleſs'd: If you
ſay, any one may bleſs it, then, though you
contemn the Benedictions of the Clergy, you
allow of them by every body elſe: If every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
cannot bleſs it; then, you muſt confeſs, that
the Benedictions of ſome Perſons are effectual,
where others are not.</p>
            <p>My Lord, the great Sin againſt the Holy
Ghoſt, was the Denial of his Operation in the
Miniſtry of our Saviour. And how near does
your Lordſhip come to it, in denying the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of that ſame Spirit, in the Miniſters whom
Chriſt hath ſent? They are employed in the
ſame Work that he was. He left his Authority
with them; and promis'd, that the Holy Spirit
ſhould remain with them to the End of the
World; that whatſoever they ſhould bind on
Earth, ſhould be bound in Heaven; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
they ſhould looſe on Earth, ſhould be
looſed in Heaven; that whoſoever deſpiſes them,
deſpiſes Him, and Him that ſent him. And yet
your Lordſhip tells us, we need not to trouble
our Heads about any particular Sort of Clergy;
that all is to be tranſacted betwixt God and our
ſelves; that Human Benedictions are infigniſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
Trifles.</p>
            <p>But pray, what Proof has your Lordſhip for
all this? Have you any Scripture for it? Has
God any where declar'd, that no Men on Earth
have any Authority to bleſs in his Name? Has
he any where ſaid, that it is a wicked, preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1141100300:16"/>
Thing for any one to pretend to it? Has
he any where cold us, that it is inconſiſtent with
his Honour, to beſtow his Graces by <hi>Human
Hands?</hi> Has he any where told us, that he has
no Miniſters, no Embaſſadors on Earth; but
that all his Gifts and Graces are to be receiv'd
immediately from his own Hands? Have you
any Antiquity, Fathers or Councils on your
ſide? No: The whole Tenour of Scripture, the
whole Current of Tradition is againſt you. Your
Novel Doctrine has only this, to recommend it
to the Libertines of the Age, who univerſally
give into it, that it never was the Opinion of
any Church, or Church-man. It is your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's
proper Aſſertion, <hi>That we offend God in
expecting his Graces from any Hands but his own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now it's ſtrange, that God ſhould be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with his own Methods; or that your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
ſhould find us out a Way of pleaſing him,
more ſuitable to his Nature and Attributes, than
what he has taught us in the Scriptures. I call
them his own Methods: For what elſe is the
whole <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Diſpenſation, but a Method of
God's Providence; where his Bleſſings and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were diſpens'd by <hi>Human Hands?</hi> What is
the Chriſtian Religion, but a Method of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
where the chief Means of Grace are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
and diſpens'd by Human Hands? Let me
here recommend to your Lordſhip, the excellent
Words of a very Learned and Judicious Prelate
on this Occaſion.</p>

This will have no Weight with any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
Man, againſt the Cenſures of the
Church, or any other Ordinance of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
that they make the Intervention of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

it has always been God's ordinary Method, to
diſpenſe his Bleſſings and Judgments by the
Hands of Men<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Potter</hi>'s Church-Government, <hi>p.</hi> 336.</note>.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Your Lordſhip exclaims againſt your Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries,
as ſuch Romantick ſtrange ſort of Men,
for talking of Benedictions and Abſolutions, and
of the Neceſſity of receiving God's Ordinances
from proper Hands: Yet, my Lord, here is an
Excellent Biſhop, againſt whoſe <hi>Learnings Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
and <hi>Proteſtantiſm,</hi> there can be no Objection;
who ſays, if a Perſon have but the <hi>Uſe of his
Reaſon,</hi> he will have nothing to object to any
Ordinances of the Goſpel, which make the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervention
of other Men neceſſary towards the
Conveyance of them; ſince that has always
been God's ordinary Method. The Biſhop does
not ſay, it is neceſſary, a Man ſhould be a
<hi>Great Divine</hi> to acknowledge it; ſo he be but a
<hi>Reaſonable Man,</hi> he will allow it. Yet your
Lordſhip is ſo far from being this <hi>Reaſonable Man,</hi>
that you think your Adverſaries void both of
Reaſon and common Senſe, for teaching it.
You expreſsly exclude <hi>All</hi> Perſons from having
any thing to do with our Salvation; and ſay, it
<hi>wholly</hi> depends upon God and our ſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:1141100300:18"/>
You tell us, that <hi>Authoritative Benediction is
another of the Terms of Art uſed by your Proteſtant
Adverſaries; in which they claim a Right, in one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Succeſſion, of Bleſſing the People</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Page 91.</note>. An inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
Author, my Lord, (in the Opinion of

the <hi>Conſecration</hi> of the Elements <hi>Conjuration</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Rights of the Chriſtian Church.</note>;
your Lordſhip calls the <hi>Sacerdotal Benediction</hi> a
<hi>Term of Art;</hi> too plain an Intimation, tho' in
more remote and ſomewhat ſofter Terms, that
in the Sence of a <hi>Certain Father</hi> of the Church,
her Clergy are little better than ſo many Jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glers.</p>
            <p>Your Lordſhip ſays, <hi>If they only meant hereby to
declare upon what Terms God will give his Bleſſings</hi>
to Chriſtians, <hi>or to expreſs their own hearty Wiſhes for
them, this might be underſtood.</hi> So it might, my
Lord, very eaſily; and, I ſuppoſe, every body
underſtands that they may do this, whether they
be Clergy or Layity, Men or Women: For I
preſume, any one may declare what he takes to
be the Terms of the Goſpel, and wiſh that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
may faithfully obſerve them. But I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
preſume, my Lord, that the Good Biſhop
above-mention'd, meant ſomething more than
this, when he ſpake of <hi>Ordinances, which make
the Intervention of other Men</hi> neceſſary <hi>to our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and of God's diſpenſing his Bleſſings</hi> in virtue of
them through their Hands.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:1141100300:19"/>
There is a ſuperſtitious Cuſtom (in your
Lordſhip's Account it muſt be ſo) yet remaining
in moſt Places, of ſending for a Clergyman to
miniſter to ſick Perſons in imminent Danger of
Death: Even thoſe who have abus'd the Clergy
all their Lives long, are glad to beg their Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
when they apprehend themſelves upon the
Confines of another World. There is no reaſon,
my Lord, to diſlike this <hi>Practice,</hi> but as it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
a Difference between the <hi>Sacerdotal Prayers</hi>
and <hi>Benedictions.</hi> and thoſe of a Nurſe.</p>
            <p>We read, my Lord, that God would not heal
<hi>Abimelech,</hi> tho' he knew the Integrity of his
Heart, till <hi>Abraham</hi> had prayed for him. <hi>He is a
Prophet,</hi> ſaid God, <hi>he ſhall pray for thee, and thou ſhalt
live,</hi> (Gen. 20. 7.)</p>
            <p>Pray, my Lord, was not God Juſt, and Good,
and True, in the Days of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as He is
now? Yet you ſee, <hi>Abimelech's Integrity</hi> was not
available it ſelf. He was to be pardon'd by
the Prayer of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and his Prayer was effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual;
and ſo repreſented, becauſe it was the
Prayer of a <hi>Prophet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Suppoſe, my Lord, that <hi>Abimelech</hi> had ſaid
with your Lordſhip, <hi>That it is affronting to God,
that we ſhould expect his Graces from any Hands</hi> but
<hi>his own; that all is to be tranſacted between God and
our ſelves;</hi> and ſo had rejected the Prayer of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
as a mere Eſſay of <hi>Prophet-Craft;</hi> He had
then acted with as much Prudence and Piety as
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1141100300:20"/>
your Lordſhip's Layity would do, if you could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade
them to deſpiſe <hi>Benedictions</hi> and <hi>Abſolutions,</hi>
to regard no <hi>particular ſort of Clergy;</hi> but intirely
depend upon God and themſelves, without any
other Aſſiſtance whatever.</p>
            <p>We read alſo, that <hi>Joſhua was full of the Spirit of
Wiſdom; for Moſes had laid his Hands upon him,</hi>
(Deut. 34. 9.) Was it not as abſurd, my Lord, in
the Days of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> for <hi>Human Hands</hi> to <hi>bleſs,</hi> as
it is now? Did there not then lie the ſame Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> that there does now againſt
the Chriſtian Clergy? Had <hi>Moſes</hi> any more <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Power</hi> to give the Spirit of Wiſdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by
his Hands, than the Clergy have to confer Grace
by theirs? They are both equally weak and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient
for theſe Purpoſes, of themſelves, and
equally powerful when it pleaſes God to make
them ſo.</p>
            <p>Again, when <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> and his Friends had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed
God, they were not to be reconciled to
God by their own Repentance, or tranſact that
Matter only between God and themſelves; but
they were refer'd to apply to <hi>Job. My Servant
Job ſhall pray for you; for him will I accept,</hi> (Job 42. 8.)
Might not <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> here have ſaid, ſhall I ſo far
affront God, as to think I can't be bleſs'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Prayers of <hi>Job?</hi> Shall I be ſo weak or
ſenſeleſs, as to imagine, my own Supplications
and Repentance will not ſave me; or that I
need apply to any one but God alone, to quail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
me for the Reception of his Grace?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:1141100300:21"/>
               <hi>Again,</hi> The Lord ſpake unto Moſes, ſaying, ſpeak
unto Aaron and his Sons, ſaying, on this wiſe ſhall ye
bleſs the Children of Iſrael, ſaying unto them, <hi>The
Lord bleſs and keep thee,</hi> &amp;c. and I will bleſs
them, (<hi>Numb.</hi> 6. 22.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> The Prieſts of the Sous of Levi ſhall come
near; for them hath the Lord thy God choſen to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
unto him, and to bleſs in the Name of the Lord,
(<hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 5.)</p>
            <p>Now, my Lord, this is what we mean by the
Authoritative Adminiſtrations of the Chriſtian
Clergy; whether they be by way of Benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or of any other kind. We take them to
be Perſons whom God has choſen to miniſter
unto him, and to bleſs in his Name. We ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
that our Saviour was a greater <hi>Prieſt and
Mediator</hi> than <hi>Aaron,</hi> or any of God's former
Miniſters. We are aſſur'd,, that Chriſt ſent his
Apoſtles, as his Father had ſent him; and that
therefore they were his true Succeſſors: And
ſince they did commiſſion others to ſucceed them
in their Office, by the Impoſition of Hands, as
<hi>Moſes</hi> commiſſion'd <hi>Joſhua</hi> to ſucceed him; the
Clergy who have ſucceeded the Apoſtles, have
as Divine a Call and Commiſſion to their Work,
as thoſe who were call'd by our Saviour; and are
as truly his Succeſſors, as the Apoſtles themſelves
were.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:1141100300:22"/>
From the Places of Scripture above mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
it is evident; and indeed, from the whole
Tenour of Sacred Writ, that it may conſiſt with
the Goodneſs and Juſtice of God to depute Men
to act in his Name, and be miniſterial towards the
Salvation of others; and to lay a Neceſſity upon
his Creatures of qualifying themſelves for his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
and receiving his Graces by the Hands and
Intervention of mere Men.</p>
            <p>But, my Lord, if there be now any Set of
Men upon Earth, that are more peculiarly God's
Miniſters, than others; and thro whoſe Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations,
Prayers, and Benedictions, God will
accept of returning Sinners, and receive them to
Grace; you have done all you can, to prejudice
People againſt them: You have taught the Layi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that all is to be tranſacted between God and
themſelves; and that they need not value any
particular ſort of Clergy in the World.</p>
            <p>I leave it to the Great Judge and Searcher of
Hearts, to judge, from what Principles, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what Motives your Lordſhip has been induc'd
to teach teſethings: But muſt declare, that
for my own part, if I had the greateſt Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
to Chriſtianity, I ſhould think, it could not
be more expreſs'd, than by teaching what your
Lordſhip has publickly taught. If I could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice
in the Miſery and Ruin of Sinners, I ſhould
think it ſufficient Matter of Triumph, to drive
them from the Miniſters of God, and to put
them upon inventing new Schemes of ſaving
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1141100300:23"/>
themſelves, inſtead of ſubmitting to the ordinary
Methods of Salvation appointed by God.</p>
            <p>It will not follow from any thing I have ſaid,
that the Layity have loſt their Chriſtian Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
or that no body can be ſav'd, but whom the
Clergy pleaſe to ſave; that they have the arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Diſpoſal of Happineſs to Mankind. Was
<hi>Abimelech</hi>'s Happineſs in the Diſpoſition of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
becauſe he was to be receiv'd by means
of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Interceſſion? Or could <hi>Job</hi> damn
<hi>Eliphaz,</hi> becauſe he was to mediate for him, and
procure his Reconciliation to God.</p>
            <p>Neither, my Lord, do the <hi>Chriſtian Clergy</hi>
pretend to this deſpotick Empire over their
Flocks: They don't aſſume to themſelves a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to damn the Innocent, or to ſave the Guilty:
But they aſſert a ſober and juſt Right to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
Men to God; and to act in his Name, in
reſtoring them to his Favour. They receiv'd
their Commiſſion from thoſe whom Chriſt ſent
with full Authority to ſend others, and with a
Promiſe that he would be with them to the End
of the World. From this they conclude, that
they have his Authority; and that in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of it, their Adminiſtrations are neceſſary,
and effectual to the Salvation of Mankind; and
that none can deſpiſe Them, but who deſpiſe
Him that ſent them; and are as ſurely out of the
Covenant of Grace, when they leave ſuch his
Paſtors, as when they openly deſpiſe, or omit to

And what is there in this Doctrine, my Lord,
to terrifie the <hi>Conſciences</hi> of the <hi>Layity?</hi> What
is there here, to bring the prophane Scandal of
<hi>Prieſtcraft</hi> upon the <hi>Clergy?</hi> Could it be any
ground of <hi>Abimelech</hi>'s hating <hi>Abraham,</hi> becauſe
that <hi>Abraham</hi> was to reconcile him to God?
Could <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> juſtly have any Prejudice againſt
<hi>Job,</hi> becauſe God would hear <hi>Job</hi>'s Interceſſion
for him? Why, then, my Lord, muſt the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Prieſthood be ſo horrid and hateful an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
becauſe the Deſign of it is to reſtore
Men to the Grace and Favour of God? Why
muſt we be abus'd and inſulted, for being ſent
upon the Errand of Salvation, and made Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of eternal Happineſs to our Brethren?
There is a Woe due to us if we preach not the
Goſpel, or neglect thoſe miniſterial Offices that
Chriſt has entruſted to us. We are to watch
for their Souls, as thoſe who are to give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.
Why then muſt we be treated as arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
Prieſts, or <hi>Popiſhly</hi> affected, for pretending
to have any thing to do in the Diſcharge of our
<hi>Miniſtry,</hi> with the Salvation of Men? Why
muſt we be reproach'd with <hi>Blaſphemous Claims,</hi>
and <hi>Abſurd Senſeleſs Powers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> for aſſuming to bleſs
in God's Name; or thinking our Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
more effectual, than the Office of a common

            </p>
            <p>But farther, to what purpoſe does your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
except againſt theſe Powers in the <hi>Clergy?</hi>
from their <hi>common Frailties</hi> and <hi>Infirmities</hi> with the
reſt of Mankind? Were not <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:1141100300:25"/>
and the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Prieſts, Men of like Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
with us? Did not our Saviour command the
<hi>Jews</hi> to apply to their Prieſts, notwithſtanding
their Perſonal Faults, becauſe they ſat in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>'s Chair? Did not the Apoſtles aſſure their
Followers, that they were Men of like Paſſions
with them? But did they therefore diſclaim
their Miſſion, or Apoſtolical Authority? Did
they teach, that their Natural Infirmities
made them leſs the Miniſters of God, or leſs
neceſſary to the Salvation of Men? Their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
Defects did not make them depart from the
Claim of thoſe Powers they were inveſted with,
or deſert their Miniſtry: But indeed, gave St.
<hi>Paul</hi> Occaſion to ſay, <hi>We have this Treaſure in Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Veſſels,</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> this Authority committed to mere
Men) <hi>that the Excellency of it may be of God, and
not of Men.</hi> The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> happens to differ very
much from your Lordſhip. He ſays, ſuch weak
Inſtruments were made uſe of, that the Glory
might redound to God? Your Lordſhip ſays,
to ſuppoſe ſuch Inſtruments to be of any Benefit
to us, is to leſſen the Sovereignty of God, and in
conſequence, his Glory.</p>
            <p>Your Lordſhip imagines, you have ſufficiently
deſtroy'd the <hi>Sacerdotal Powers,</hi> by ſhewing, that
the <hi>Clergy</hi> are only Men, and ſubject to the
common Frailties of Mankind. My Lord, we
own the Charge; and don't claim any <hi>Sacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Powers</hi> from our Perſonal Abilities, or to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
any Glory to our ſelves. But, weak as we
are, we are God's Miniſters; and if we are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
afraid or aſham'd of our Duty, we muſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1141100300:26"/>
in the Guilt. But is a <hi>Prophet</hi> therefore
proud, becauſe he inſiſts upon the Authority of
his Miſſion? Can't a Mortal be God's Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and employ'd in his Affairs, but he muſt be
inſolent and aſſuming, for having the Reſolution
to own it? If we are to be reprov'd, for preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to be God's Miniſters, becauſe we are but
Men, the Reproach will fall upon Providence;
ſince it has pleaſed God, chiefly to tranſact his
Affairs with Mankind, by the Miniſtry of their
Brethren.</p>
            <p>Your Lordſhip has not One Word from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
againſt theſe <hi>Sacerdotal Powers;</hi> no Proof,
that Chriſt has not ſent Men to be effectual Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrators
of his Graces: You only aſſert, that
there can be no ſuch Miniſters, becauſe they are
mere Men.</p>
            <p>Now, my Lord, I muſt beg leave to ſay, that
if the Natural Weakneſs of Men makes them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of being the Instruments of conveying
Grace to their Brethren; if the Clergy can't
be of any Uſe or Neceſſity to their Flocks, for
this Reaſon; then it undeniably follows, that
there can be no <hi>poſitive Inſtitutions</hi> in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Religion, that can procure any Spiritual
Advantages to the Members of it; then the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
can be no longer any Means of Grace.
For, I hope, no one thinks, that Bread and Wine
have any natural Force or Efficacy, to convey
Grace to the Soul. The Water in Baptiſm has the
common Qualities of Water, and is deſtitute of
any intrinſick Power to cleanſe the Soul, or
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1141100300:27"/>
purifie from Sin. But your Lordſhip will not ſay,
becauſe it has only the common Name of Water,
that therefore it cannot be a Means of Grace.
Why then may not the Clergy tho' they have
the common Nature of Men, be conſtituted by
God, to convey his Graces, and to be miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
to the Salvation of their Brethren? Can God
conſecrate inanimate Things to Spiritual Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes,
and make them the Means of Eternal
Happineſs? And is Man the only Creature that
he can't make ſubſervient to his Deſigns? The
only <hi>Being</hi> who is too Weak for an Omnipotent
God to render effectual towards attaining the
Ends of his Grace?</p>
            <p>Is it juſt and reaſonable, to reject and deſpiſe
the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> and <hi>Benedictions</hi> of Men, becauſe they
are Men like our ſelves? And is it not as reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
to deſpiſe the ſprinkling of Water, a
Creature below us, a ſenſeleſs and inanimate
Creature?</p>
            <p>Your Lordſhip therefore, muſt either find us
ſome other Reaſon for rejecting the Neceſſity of
<hi>Human Adminiſtrations,</hi> than becauſe they are
<hi>Human;</hi> or elſe give up the Sacraments, and <hi>all</hi>
Poſitive Inſtitutions along with them.</p>
            <p>Surely, your Lordſhip muſt have a mighty O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian;</hi> who, when the
Prophet bid him go waſh in <hi>Jordan</hi> ſeven times,
to the end he might be clean from his Leproſie,
Very <hi>wiſely</hi> remonſtrated. <hi>Are not</hi> Abana <hi>and</hi> Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lPar,
<hi>Rivers of</hi> Damaſcus, <hi>better than all the Waters
of</hi> Iſrael?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:1141100300:28"/>
This, my Lord, diſcover'd <hi>Naaman</hi>'s great <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi>
of Mind; and 'tis much this has not been
produc'd before, as an Argument of his being a
<hi>Free-Thinker.</hi> He took the Water of <hi>Jordan</hi> to be
<hi>only Water;</hi> as your Lordſhip juſtly obſerves a
Clergyman to be <hi>only</hi> a Man: And if you had
been with him, you could have inform'd him,
that the waſhing <hi>ſeven times</hi> was a mere <hi>Nicety</hi>
and <hi>Trifle</hi> of the Prophet; and that ſince it is
God alone who can work <hi>miraculous Cures,</hi> we
ought not to think, that they depend upon any
external Means, or any ſtated Number of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating
them.</p>
            <p>This, my Lord, is the true Scope and Spirit
of your Argument: If the <hi>Syrian</hi> was right in
deſpiſing the Water of <hi>Jordan,</hi> becauſe it was
only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>; your Lordſhip may be right in
deſpiſing any particular Order of Clergy; becauſe
they are but Men. Your Lordſhip is certainly as
right, or as wrong, as he was.</p>
            <p>And now, my Lord, let the common Sence of
Mankind here judge, whether, if the Clergy are
to be eſteem'd as having no Authority, becauſe
they are mere Men; it does not plainly follow,
that every thing elſe, every Inſtitution that has
not ſome <hi>natural</hi> Force and Power to produce
the Effects deſigned by it, is not alſo to be
rejected as equally Trifling and Ineffectual.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:1141100300:29"/>
The Sum of the matter is this: It appears
from many expreſs Facts, and indeed, from the
whole Series of God's Providence, that it is not
only conſiſtent with his Attributes; but alſo agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to his ordinary Methods of dealing with
Mankind, that he ſhould ſubſtitute Men to act
in his Name, and be <hi>Authoritatively</hi> employ'd
in conferring his Grace and Favours upon Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
It appears, that your Lordſhip's Argument
againſt the Authoritative Adminiſtrations of the
Chriſtian Clergy, does not only contradict thoſe
Facts, and condemn the ordinary Method of
God's Diſpenſations; but likewiſe proves the
Sacraments, and every poſitive Inſtitution of
Chriſtianity to be ineffectual, and as mere <hi>Dreams</hi>
and <hi>Trifles,</hi> as the ſeveral <hi>Offices and Orders</hi> of the
Clergy.</p>
            <p>This, I hope, will be eſteem'd a ſufficient Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation
of your Lordſhip's Doctrine, by all who
have any true Regard or Zeal for the Chriſtian
Religion; and only expect to be ſav'd by the
Methods of Divine Grace propos'd in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now in a Word or two ſet forth the
Sacredneſs of the Eccleſiaſtical Character, as it is
founded in the New Teſtament; with a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
regard to the Power of conferring Grace,
and the Efficacy of Human Benedictions.]</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:1141100300:30"/>
It appears therein, that all Sacerdotal Power
as deriv'd from the Holy Ghoſt. Our Saviour
himſelf took not the <hi>Minſtry</hi> upon him, till he
had this Conſecration: And during the time of
his Miniſtry he was under the Guidance and
Direction of the Holy Ghoſt. Thro' the Holy
Spirit he gave Commandment to the Apoſtles
whom he had choſen. When he ordain'd them
to the Work of the Miniſtry, it was with theſe
Words, <hi>Receive the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Thoſe whom the
Apoſtles ordain'd to the ſame Function, it was
by the ſame Authority: They laid their Hands
upon the Elders, exhorting them to take care of
she Flock of Chriſt, over which the Holy Ghoſt
had made them Overſeers.</p>
            <p>Hereby they plainly declar'd, that however this
Office was to deſcend from Man to Man through
<hi>Human Hands,</hi> that it was the Holy Ghoſt which
conſecrated them to that Employment, and gave
them Authority to execute it.</p>
            <p>From this it is alſo manifeſt, that the Prieſthood
is a Grace of the Holy Ghoſt; that it is not a
Function founded in the Natural or Civil Rights
of Mankind; but is deriv'd from the Special
Authority of the Holy Ghoſt; and is as truly a
poſitive Inſtitution as the Sacraments. So that
they who have no Authority to alter the Old Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
and ſubſtitute New ones, have no Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to alter the Old Order of the Clergy, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
any other Order of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:1141100300:31"/>
For why can we not change the Sacraments?
Is it not, becauſe they are only Sacraments, and
operate as they are inſtituted by the Holy Ghoſt?
Becauſe they are uſeleſs ineffectual Rites without
this Authority? And does not the ſame Reaſon
hold as well for the Order of the Clergy? Does
not the ſame Scripture tell us, they are equally
inſtituted by the Holy Ghoſt, and oblige only
by virtue of his Authority? How abſurd is it
therefore, to pretend to aboliſh, or depart from
the Settled Order of the Clergy, to make New
Orders, and think any God's Miniſters, unleſs
we had his Authority, and could make New
Sacraments, or a New Religion?</p>
            <p>My Lord, how comes it, that we cannot alter
the Scriptures? Is it not, becauſe they are Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely
inſpir'd, and dictated by the Holy Ghoſt?
And ſince it is expreſs Scripture, that the <hi>Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi>
is inſtituted and authoriz'd by the ſame Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Spirit, why is not the Holy Ghoſt as much to
be regarded in one Inſtitution, as in another?
Why may we not as well make a Goſpel, and
ſay, it was writ by the Holy Ghoſt, as make a
New Order of Clergy, and call them His; or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
them as having any relation to him?</p>
            <p>From this it likewiſe appears, that there is an
abſolute Neceſſity of a ſtrict Succeſſion of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriz'd
Ordainers, from the Apoſtolical Times,
in order to conſtitute a <hi>Chriſtian Prieſt.</hi> For ſince
a Commiſſion from the Holy Ghoſt is neceſſary
for the Exerciſe of this Office; no one now can
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1141100300:32"/>
receive it, but from thoſe who have deriv'd their
Authority in a true Succeſſion, from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.
We could not, my Lord, call our preſent
Bibles the <hi>Word of God,</hi> unleſs we knew the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
from which they are taken, were taken from
other true ones, till we come to the Originals
themſelves. No more could we call any True
Miniſters, or Authoriz'd by the Holy Ghoſt, who
have not receiv'd their Commiſſion by an unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
Succeſſion of Lawful Ordainers.</p>
            <p>What an Excellent Divine would he be, who
ſhould tell the World, it was not neceſſary that
the ſeveral Copies and Manuſcripts, through
which the Scriptures have been tranſmitted thro'
different Ages and Languages, ſhould be all true
ones, and none of them forg'd; that <hi>this was a
thing ſubject to ſo great Uncertainty, that God could
not hang our Salvation on ſuch Niceties.</hi> Suppoſe,
for Proof of this, he ſhould appeal to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
and ask, where any Mention is made of
aſcertaining the Truth of all the Copies? Would
not this be a Way of Arguing very Theological?
The Application is very eaſie.</p>
            <p>Your Lordſhip has not one Word to prove the
uninterrupted Succeſſion of the Clergy a <hi>Triſte</hi>
or <hi>Dream;</hi> but that it is ſubject to ſo great Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty,
and is never mention'd in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
And to the Uncertainty of it, it is equally
as uncertain, as whether the Scriptures be <hi>genuine.</hi>
There is juſt the ſame ſufficient Hiſtorical Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
for the Certainty of one, as the other.
As to its not being mention'd in the Scripture,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1141100300:33"/>
the Doctrine upon which it is founded, plainly
made it unneceſſary to mention it. Is it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for the Scriptures to tell us, that if we take
our Bible from any falſe Copy, that it is not the
Word of God? Why then need they tell us, that
if we are Ordain'd by Uſurping Falſe Pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to Ordination, not deriving their Authority
to that end from the Apoſtles, that we are no
Prieſts? Does not the thing it ſelf ſpeak as plain
in one Caſe, as in the other? The Scriptures are
only of uſe to us, as they are the Word of God:
We cannot have this Word of God, which was
written ſo many Years ago, unleſs we receive it
from Authentick Copies and Manuſcripts.</p>
            <p>The Clergy have their Commiſſion from the
Holy Ghoſt: The Power of conferring this
Commiſſion of the Holy Ghoſt, was left with
the Apoſtles: Therefore the preſent Clergy can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
have the ſame Commiſſion, or Call, but from
an Order of Men, who have ſucceſſively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd
his Power from the Apoſtles to the preſent
time. So that, my Lord, I ſhall beg leave to
lay it down, as a plain, undeniable, Chriſtian
Truth, that the Order of the Clergy is an Order
of as neceſſary Obligation, as the Sacraments;
and as unalterable as the Holy Scriptures; the
ſame Holy Ghoſt being as truly the Author and
Founder of the Prieſthood, as the Inſtitutor of
the Sacraments, or the Inſpirer of thoſe Divine
Oracles. And when your Lordſhip ſhall offer
any freſh Arguments to prove, that no particular
ſort of Clergy is neceſſary; that the Benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Adminiſtrations of the preſent Clergy
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1141100300:34"/>
of our moſt Excellent Church, are Trifling
Niceties; if I cannot ſhew, that the ſame Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
will conclude againſt the Authority of the
Sacraments and the Scriptures, I faithfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
your Lordſhip to become a Convert to your
Doctrine.</p>
            <p>What your Lordſhip charges upon your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries,
as an Abſurd Doctrine, in pretending
the Neceſſity of one regular, ſucceſſive, and
particular Order of the Clergy, is a True Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Doctrine; and as certain from Scripture,
as that we are to keep to the Inſtitution of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Sacraments; or not to alter thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Scriptures, which now compoſe the Canon
of the Old and New Teſtament.</p>
            <p>By Authoritative Benediction, we do not
mean any Natural or Intrinſick Authority of
our own: But a Commiſſion from God, to be
Effectual Adminiſtrators of his Ordnances, and
to bleſs in his Name. Thus, a Perſon who is
ſent from God to foretel things, of which he had
before no Knowledge or Notion, or to denounce
Judgments, which he has no Natural Power to
execute, may be truly ſaid to be an <hi>Authoritative
Prophet;</hi> becauſe he has the Authority of God for
what he does. Thus, when the Biſhop is ſaid to
confer Grace in Confirmation; this is properly
an <hi>Authoritative Benediction;</hi> becauſe he is then as
truly doing what God has commiſſion'd him to
do, as when a Prophet declares upon what Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand
he is ſent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:1141100300:35"/>
'Tis in this Sence, my Lord, that the People
are ſaid to be <hi>Authoritatively</hi> bleſs'd by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Clergy; becauſe they are <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Clergy,</hi> and
act by his Commiſſion; bacauſe by their Hands
the People receive the Graces and Benefits of
God's Ordinances; which they have no more
Reaſon to expect from other Miniſters of their
own Election, or if the Word may be us'd in an
abuſive Sence, of their own <hi>Conſecration,</hi> than
to receive Grace from Sacraments of their
own Appointment. The Scriptures teach us,
that the Holy Ghoſt has inſtituted an Order of
Clergy: We ſay, a Prieſthood ſo authoriz'd,
can no more be chang'd by us, than we can
change the Scriptures, or make New Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
becauſe they are all founded on the
ſame Authority, without any Power of a
Diſpenſation delegated to us in one Caſe more
than in another. If therefore we have a mind
to continue in the Covenant of Chriſt, and
receive the Grace and Benefit of his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
we muſt receive them through ſuch
Hands as he has authoriz'd for that Purpoſe,
to the end we may be qualify'd to partake the
Bleſſings of them. For as a <hi>True</hi> Prieſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
benefit us by adminiſtring a <hi>Falſe</hi> Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
ſo a <hi>True</hi> Sacrament is nothing, when
it is adminiſtred by a <hi>Falſe Uncommiſſion'd Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter.</hi>
Beſides this Benediction which attends
the Ordinances of God, when they are thus
perform'd by authoriz'd Hands; there is a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction
of Prayer, which we may juſtly think
very effectual, when pronounc'd or diſpens'd by
the ſame Hands.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:1141100300:36"/>
Thus when the Biſhop or Prieſt intercedes for
the Congregation, or pronounces the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Benediction upon them, we do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
this barely as an Act of Charity and
Humanity, of one Chriſtian praying for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but as the Work of a Perſon who is
commiſſion'd by God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to <hi>bleſs in his Name,</hi> and be
effectually miniſterial in the Conveyance of his
Graces; or as the Prayer of one who is left
with us in Chriſt's ſtead, to carry on his
great Deſign of ſaving us; and whoſe Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
are ever ratify'd in Heaven, but when
we render our ſelves, in one reſpect or other,
incapable of them.</p>
            <p>Now, my Lord, they are theſe <hi>Sacerdotal
Prayers,</hi> theſe Authoriz'd Sacraments, theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion'd
Paſtors, whom the Holy Ghoſt has
made Overſeers of the Flock of Chriſt, that
your Lordſhip encourages the Layity to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe.
You bid them <hi>contemn the vain Words of
Validity or Invalidity of God's Ordinances;</hi> to <hi>heed
no particular ſort of Clergy, or the pretended Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of their Adminiſtrations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Lordſhip ſets up in this Controverſie
for an Advocate for the Layity, againſt the
<hi>Arrogant Pretences,</hi> and <hi>Falſe Claims</hi> of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy.
My Lord, we are no more contending
for our ſelves in this Doctrine, than when we
inſiſt upon any Article in the Creed. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it any more our particular Cauſe, when
we aſſert our Miſſion, than when we aſſert the
Neceſſity of the Sacraments.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:1141100300:37"/>
Who is to receive the Benefit of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
which we aſſert, but They? Who is to
ſuffer, if we pretend a Falſe one, but Our
ſelves? Sad Injury, indeed, offer'd to the Layi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty!
That we ſhould affect to be thought Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
of God for their ſakes! If we really are
ſo, they are to receive the Benefit; if not; we
are to bear the Puniſhment.</p>
            <p>But your Lordſhip comes too late in this
glorious Undertaking, to receive the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of it: The Work has been already, in
the Opinion of moſt People, better done to your

who, if your Lordſhip's Doctrine be
true, deſerves to have a Statue erected to his

which is due to the greateſt Reformer of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>Did not mine own Eyes allure me, that he
has caſt no Contempt upon the Church, no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
upon the Evangelical Inſtitutions, or
the Sacred Function, but what has been ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by your Lnrdſhip, I would never have
plac'd your Lordſhip in the ſame View with
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1141100300:38"/>
ſo ſcandalous a Declaimer againſt the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of Chriſt. Whether I am right or not,
in this Charge, I freely leave to the Judgment
of thoſe to determine, who are acquainted with
both your Works. Yet this Author, my Lord,
has been treated by the greateſt and beſt Part
of the Nation, as a Free-thinking Infidel. But
for what my Lord? Not that he has declar'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Scriptures; not that he has rejected
Revelation; (we are not, bleſſed be God, ſtill
ſo far corrupted with the Principles of Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity)
but becauſe he has reproach'd every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Church, as ſuch, and deny'd all Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
to Communion; becauſe he has expos'd
Benedictions, Abſolutions and Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
deny'd the Divine Right of the Clergy,
and ridicul'd the pretended Sacredneſs and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of their Adminiſtrations, as mere Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Trifles, tho' commonly in more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
I was going to ſay, more decent Ways:
In a word, becauſe he made all Churches, all
Prieſts, all Sacraments, however adminiſtred,
equally valid, and deny'd any particular Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
neceſſary to Salvation. Yet after all this
prophane Declamation, he allows, my Lord,
that <hi>Religious Offices may be appropriated to particular
Men, call'd</hi> Clergy, <hi>for Order ſake only; and
not on the Account of any peculiar Spiritual Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
Powers or Privileges, which thoſe who art ſet
apart for them, have from Heaven</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:1141100300:39"/>
Agreeable to this, your Lordſhip owns, that
you are not againſt the <hi>Order,</hi> or <hi>Decency,</hi> or <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination
belonging to Chriſtian Societies</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Anſwer to Dr. <hi>Snape,</hi> p. 48.</note>.</p>
            <p>But, pray, my Lord, do you mean any more
by this, than the above-mention'd Author? Is it
for any thing, but the ſake of a little external
<hi>Order</hi> or <hi>Conveniency?</hi> Is there any Chriſtian Law
that obliges to obſerve this kind of Order? Is
there any real eſſential Difference between Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
rank'd into this Order? Is it a Sin for any
body, eſpecially the Civil Magiſtrate, to leave
this Order, and make what other Orders he
prefers to it? This your Lordſhip cannot reſolve
in the Affirmative; for then you muſt allow,
that ſome Communions are ſafer than others,
and that ſome Clergy have more Authority than
others.</p>
            <p>Will your Lordſhip ſay, that no <hi>particular</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
can be neceſſary; yet ſome Order neceſſary,
which may be different in different Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions?
This cannot hold good upon your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's
Principles: For ſince Chriſt has left no
Law about any Order, no Members of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Communion need ſubmit to that Order;
ſince it is confeſs'd by your Lordſhip, That in
Religion no Laws, but thoſe of Chriſt, are of
any Obligation. So that, tho' you don't diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
all external Order and Decency your
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1141100300:40"/>
ſelf, yet you have taught other People to do it
if they pleaſe, and as much as they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe, my Lord, ſome Layman, upon a
Pretence of your Lordſhip's Abſence, or any
other, ſhould go into the Dloceſs of <hi>Bangor,</hi>
and there pretend to Ordain Clergymen;
could your Lordſhip quote one Text of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
againſt him? Could you alledge any
Law of Chriſt, or his Apoſtles, that he had
broken? Could you prove him guilty of any
Sin? No, my Lord, you would not do that;
becauſe this would be acknowledging ſuch a
thing as a <hi>Sinful Ordination;</hi> and if there be Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Ordinations, then there muſ be ſome <hi>Law</hi>
concerning Ordinations: For <hi>Sin is the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion
of the Law:</hi> And if there be a Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Ordinations, then we muſt keep to the
Clergy <hi>lawfully</hi> Ordain'd; and muſt confeſs,
after all your Lordſhip has ſaid, or can ſay, that
ſtill ſome Communions are ſafer than others.</p>
            <p>If you ſhould reprove ſuch a one, as an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhman,</hi>
for acting in Oppoſition to the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Laws of <hi>Decency and Order;</hi> he would anſwer,
That he has nothing to do with ſuch <hi>Trifles;</hi>
That Chriſt was ſole Lawgiver in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
That he was content to have his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
as <hi>Orderly</hi> and <hi>Decent</hi> as Chriſt had left
it; and ſince he had inſtituted no Laws in
that matter, it was preſuming for others to
take upon them to add any thing by way
of <hi>Order</hi> or <hi>Decency,</hi> by Laws of their own:
That as he had as much Authority from
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1141100300:41"/>
Chriſt, to Ordain Clergy, as your Lordſhip,
he would not depart from his Chriſtian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
            <p>If he ſhould remonſtrate to your Lordſhip in
theſe, or Words to the like effect, he would
only reduce your Lordſhip's own Doctrine to
Practice. This, my Lord, is pare of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
the Learned Dr. <hi>Snape</hi> has charged you
with being the Author of, in the Church of
God. And all Perſons, my Lord, whom you
have taught not to regard any particular ſort of
Clergy, muſt know (if they have the common
Senſe to which you appeal) that then no Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
are at all neceſſary; and that it's as lawful
for any Man to be his own Prieſt, as to ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit
his own Cauſe. For to ſay, that no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
ſort of Clergy are neceſſary, and yet that in
general, the Clergy are neceſſary, is the ſame
as to ſay, that Truth is neceſſary to be believ'd;
yet the Belief of no particular Truth is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The next thing to be conſider'd, my Lord, is
your Doctrine concerning Abſolutions. You
begin thus:</hi> The ſame you will find a ſufficient
Reply to their preſumptuous Claim to an Authoritative
Abſolution. An infallible Abſolution cannot belong to
fallible Men. But no Abſolution can be Authoritative,
which is not Infallible. Therefore no Authoritative Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
can belong to any Man living.<note n="*" place="bottom">Preſervative, <hi>p.</hi> 92.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:1141100300:42"/>
I muſt obſerve here, your Lordſhip does not
reject this <hi>Abſolution,</hi> becauſe the Claim of it is
not founded in Scripture; but by an Argument
drawn from the nature of the Thing: Becauſe
you imagine, ſuch Abſolution requires Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
for the Execution of it; therefore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
belong to Men. Should this be true, it
would prove, that if our Saviour had really ſo
intended, he could not have given this Power
to his Miniſters. But, my Lord, who can ſee any
Repugnancy in the Reaſon of the Thing it ſelf?
Is it not as eaſie to conceive, that our Lord
ſhould confer his Grace of Pardon by the Hands
of his Miniſters, as by Means of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?
And may not ſuch Abſolution be juſtly
called <hi>Authoritative,</hi> the Power of which is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and executed by his Authority?</p>
            <p>Is it impoſſible for Men to have this Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
from God, becauſe they may miſtake in the
Exerciſe of it? This Argument proves too
much; and makes as ſhort work with every In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of Chriſtianity, as with this Power of
Abſolution.</p>
            <p>For if it is impoſſible, that Men ſhould have
Authority from God to Abſolve in his Name,
becauſe they are not Infallible; this makes them
equally incapable of being entruſted with any
other Means of Grace; and conſequently,
ſuppoſes the whole Prieſts Office to imply a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
Impoſſbility in the very Notion of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:1141100300:43"/>
Your Lordſhip's Argument is this: Chriſtians
have their Sins pardon'd upon certain Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
but Fallible Men cannot certainly know
theſe Conditions; therefore Fallible Men cannot
have Authority to <hi>Abſolve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence I take occaſion to argue thus:
Perſons are to be admitted to the Sacraments
on certain Conditions; But Fallible Men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell, whether they come qualified to receive
them according to theſe Conditions; Therefore
Fallible Men cannot have Authority to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
the Sacraments.</p>
            <p>2<hi>dly,</hi> This Argument ſubverts all Authority
of the Chriſtian Religion it ſelf, and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of every inſtituted Means of Grace. For
if nothing can be Authoritative, but what a
Man is infallibly aſſured of; then the Chriſtian
Religion cannot be an Authoritative Method of
Salvation; ſince a Man, by being a Chriſtian,
does not become infallibly certain of his Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Nor does Grace infallibly attend the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation
of the Sacraments. So that tho' your
Lordſhip has form'd this Argument only againſt
this Abſolving Power; yet it has as much Force
againſt the Sacraments, and the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
it ſelf. For if it be abſurd to ſuppoſe,
that the Prieſt ſhould abſolve any one, becauſe
he cannot be certain that he deſerves Abſolution;
does it not imply the ſame Abſurdity, to ſuppoſe,
that he ſhould have the Power of Adminiſtring
the Sacraments, when he cannot be <hi>infallibly
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1141100300:44"/>
rtain,</hi> that thoſe who receive them, are duly
qualified? If a Poſſibility of Error deſtroys the
Power in one Caſe, it as certainly deſtroys it
in the other. Again, if Abſolution cannot be
Authoritative, unleſs it be Infallible; then, it is
plain, that the Chriſtian Religion is not an
Authoritative Means of Salvation; becauſe all
Chriſtians are not infallibly ſav'd: Nor can the
Sacraments be Authoritative Means of Grace;
becauſe <hi>all</hi> who partake of them, do not infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
obtain Grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your Lordſhip proceeds with your Layity by
way of Expoſtulation:</hi> If they amuſe you with
that Power which Chriſt left with his Apoſtles,
Whoſe ſoever Sins ye remit, they are remitted unto
them; and whoſe ſoever Sins ye retain, they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
unto them<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 93</note>.</p>
            <p>But why <hi>amuſe,</hi> my Lord? Are the Texts of
Holy Scripture to be treated as only Matter of
<hi>Amuſement?</hi> Or does your Lordſhip know of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Age in the Church, when the very ſame Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
which we now teach, has not been taught
from the ſame Texts?</p>
            <p>Do you know any Succeſſors of the Apoſtles,
that thought the Power there ſpecify'd, did not
belong them? But however, your Lordſhip has
taught your Layity to believe what we argue
from this Text, all Amuſement; and told them,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1141100300:45"/>
               <hi>They may ſecurely anſwer, that it is impoſſible for
them to depend upon this Right as any thing certain,
till they can prove to you, that every thing ſpoken to
the Apoſtles, belongs to Miniſters in all Ages</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Page 94.</note>.
The Security of this Anſwer, my Lord, is
founded upon this Falſe Preſumption, <hi>viz.</hi> That
the Clergy can claim no Right to the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of any Part of their Office, <hi>as Succeſſors of
the Apoſtles,</hi> till they can prove, that every
thing that was ſpoken to the Apoſtles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to them.</p>
            <p>This Propoſition muſt be true; or elſe there
is no Force or <hi>Security</hi> in the Objection you here
bring for the Inſtruction of the Layity. If it
is well founded, then the Clergy can't poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
prove, they have any more Right to the
Exerciſe of any Part of their Office than the
Layity. Do they pretend to Ordain, Confirm,
to admit or exclude Men from the Sacraments?
By what Authority is all this done? Is it not,
becauſe the Apoſtles, whoſe Succeſſors they
are, did the ſame things? But then, ſay your
Lordſhip's well-inſtructed Layity, this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the purpoſe: Prove your ſelves A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles;
prove, that every thing ſaid to the
Apoſtles, belongs to you; and then it will be
allow'd, that you may exerciſe theſe Powers,
becauſe they exerciſed them: But as this is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to be done; ſo it is impoſſible for you
to prove, that you have any Powers or Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
becauſe they had them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:1141100300:46"/>
And now, my Lord, if the Caſe be thus,
what Apology ſhall we make for Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
as it has been practis'd in all Ages? How
ſhall we excuſe the noble Army of Martyrs,
Saints and Confeſſors, who have boldly aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Right to ſo many Apoſtolical Powers?
Could any Men in thoſe Ages pretend, <hi>that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing that was ſpoken to the Apoſtles, belonged
to themſelves?</hi> Falſe then, was their Claim, and
preſumptuous their Authority, who ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to any Apoſtolical Powers, becauſe the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
had them; when they could not prove,
<hi>that every thing that was ſpoken to the Apoſtles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Farther; to prove, that the above-mention'd
Text does not confer the Power of Abſolution
in the Clergy, you reaſon thus:</hi> Whatever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts
the natural Notions of God, and the Deſign
and Tenour of the Goſpel, cannot be the true Meaning
of any Paſſage in the Goſpel: But to make the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
of weak and fallible Men, ſo neceſſary, or ſo
valid, that God will not pardon without them; or
that all are pardon'd, who have them pronounced over
them, is, to contradict thoſe Notions, as well as the
plain Tenour of the Goſpel<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 94.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:1141100300:47"/>
Be pleas'd, my Lord, to point out your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary:
Name any one Church of <hi>England</hi> Man
that ever taught this Romantick Doctrine which
you are confuting. Whoever taught ſuch a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of Abſolutions, that God will pardon
none without them? Whoever declar'd, that all
are pardon'd, who have them pronounc'd over
them? We teach the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> and <hi>Validity</hi> of
Sacraments; but do we ever declare, that all are
ſav'd who receive them? Is there no <hi>Medium</hi>
between Two Extreams? No ſuch thing, my
Lord, as <hi>Moderation!</hi> Muſt every thing be thus
Abſolute and Extravagant, or nothing at all?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In another Page, we have more of this ſame
Colouring:</hi> But to claim a Right to ſtand in God's
ſtead, in ſuch a Sence, that they can abſolutely and
certainly bleſs, or not bleſs, with their Voice alone:
This is the higheſt Abſurdity and Blaſphemy, as it
ſuppoſeth God to place a Set of Men above himſelf;
and to put out of his own Hands the Diſpoſal of
his Bleſſings and Curſes<note n="†" place="bottom">Page 91.</note>.</p>
            <p>If your Lordſhip had employ'd all this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory
againſt worſhipping the Sun or Moon,
it had juſt affected your Adverſaries as much
as this. For whoever taught, that any Set of
Men could <hi>Abſolutely bleſs,</hi> or withold Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
independent of God? Whoever taught,
that the Chriſtian Religion, or Sacraments, or
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:1141100300:48"/>
Abſolution ſav'd People on courſe, or without
proper Diſpoſitions? Who ever claim'd ſuch an
Abſolving Power, as to ſet himſelf above God,
and to take from him the Diſpoſal of his own
Bleſſings and Curſes? What has ſuch extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
Deſcriptions, ſuch Romantick Characters
of Abſolution, to do with that Power the Clergy
juſtly claim? Cannot there be a Neceſſity in
ſome Caſes of receiving Abſolution from their
Hands, except they ſet themſelves above God?
Is God robb'd of the Diſpoſal of his Bleſſings,
when in Obedience to his own Commands, and
in virtue of his own Authority, they admit ſome
as Members of the Church, and exclude others
from the Communion of it? Do they pretend to
be Channels of Grace, or the Means of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
by any Rights or Powers naturally inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in them? Do they not in all theſe things
conſider themſelves as lnſtruments of God, that
are made miniſterial to the Edification of the
Church, purely by his Will, and only ſo far
as they act in Conformity to it? Now if it has
pleas'd God to confer the Holy Ghoſt in Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
Confirmation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> only by them, and
to annex the Grace of Pardon to the Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their Hands, on returning Sinners; is it
any <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> for them to claim and exert their
Power? Is the Prerogative of God injur'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
his own Inſtitutions are obey'd? Cannot
he diſpenſe his Graces by what Perſons, and on
what Terms he pleaſes? Is he depriv'd of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal
of his Bleſſings, becauſe they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd
on Perſons according to his Order, and
in obedience to his Authority? If I ſhould
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:1141100300:49"/>
affirm, that Biſhops have the ſole Power to
Ordain and Confirm, would this be robbing
God of his Diſpoſal of thoſe Graces that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
ſuch Actions? Is it not rather allowing and
ſubmitting to God's own Diſpoſal, when we
keep cloſe to thoſe Methods of it, which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
has preſcrib'd?</p>
            <p>Pray, my Lord, conſider the Nature of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.
Are not they neceſſary to Salvation?
But is God therefore excluded from any Power
of his own? Has he for that reaſon, ſet Bread
and Wine in the Euchariſt, or Water in Baptiſm,
above Himſelf? Has he put the Salvation of
Men out of his own Power, becauſe it depends
on his own Inſtitutions? Is the Salvation of
Chriſtians leſs his own Act and Deed, or leſs
the Effect of his own Mercy, becauſe theſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
in great meaſure contribute to effect
it? Why then, my Lord, muſt that Impoſition
of Hands, that is attended with his Grace of
Pardon, and which has no Pretence to ſuch
Grace, but in obedience to his Order, and in
virtue of his Promiſe, be thus deſtructive of his
Prerogative? Where is there any Diminution of
his Honour or Authority, if ſuch Actions of the
Clergy are made neceſſary to the Salvation of
Souls in ſome Circumſtances, as their waſhing
in Water, or their receiving Bread and Wine?
Cannot God inſtitute Means of Grace, but thoſe
Means muſt needs be above Himſelf? They owe
all their Power and Efficacy to his Inſtitution;
and can operate no farther than the Ends for
which he inſtituted them. How then is he De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thron'd
for being thus obey'd?</p>

My Lord, you take no notice of Scripture;
but in a new Way of your own contend againſt
this Power, from the Nature of the Thing:
Yet I muſt beg Leave to ſay, this Power ſtands
upon as ſure a Bottom, and is as conſiſtent with
the Goodneſs and Majeſty of God, as the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.
If the annexing Grace to Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and making them neceſſary Means of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
be a reaſonable Inſtitution of God; ſo is
his annexing Pardon to the Impoſition of Hands
by the Clergy on returning Sinners. The
Grace or Bleſſing receiv'd in either Caſe, is of
his own giving, and in a Method of his own
preſcribing. And how this ſhould be any Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to God's Honour, or Affront to his Majeſty,
cannot eaſily be accounted for.</p>
            <p>The Clergy juſtly claim a Power of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling
Men to God, from expreſs Texts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture;
and of delivering his Pardons to penitent
Sinners. Your Lordſhip diſowns this Claim, as
making Fallible Men the Abſolute Diſpenſers of
God's Bleſſings, and putting it in their Power
to damn and ſave as they pleaſe. But, my Lord,
nothing of this Extravagance is included in it.
They are only entruſted with a <hi>Conditional</hi> Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
which they are to exerciſe according to the
Rules God has given; and it only obtains its
Effect when it is ſo exercis'd. Every inſtituted
Means of Grace is <hi>Conditional;</hi> and is only then
effectual, when it is attended with ſuch Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
as are requir'd by God. If the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
thro' Weakneſs, Paſſion or Prejudice, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1141100300:51"/>
Perſons from the Church of God, they
injure only themſelves. But, my Lord, are
theſe Powers nothing, becauſe they may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercis'd
in vain? Have the Clergy no Right at
all to them, becauſe they are not <hi>Absolutely
infallible</hi> in the Exerciſe of them?</p>
            <p>Can you prove, my Lord, that they are not
neceſſary, becauſe they have not always the
ſame Effect? May not that be neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
which is only effectual on <hi>certain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions?</hi>
Is not the Chriſtian Religion neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to Salvation, tho' all Chriſtians are not ſav'd?
Are not the Sacraments neceſſary Means of
Grace, tho' the Means of Grace obtain'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
is only Conditional? Is every one neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
improv'd in Grace, who receives the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
Or is it leſs neceſſary, becauſe the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutary
Effects of it are not more univerſal?
Why then muſt the Impoſition of Hands be leſs
neceſſary, becauſe the Grace of it is Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal,
and only obtain'd in due and proper Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances?
Is Abſolution nothing, becauſe if
witheld wrongfully, it injures not the Perſon
who is deny'd it; and if given without due
Diſpoſitions in the Penitent, it avails nothing?
Is not this equally true of the Sacraments, if
they are deny'd wrongfully, or adminiſtred to
unprepar'd Receivers? But do they therefore
ceaſe to be ſtanding and neceſſary Means of
Grace?</p>

The Argument therefore againſt this Power,
drawn from the Ignorance or Paſſions of the
Clergy, whereby they may miſtake or pervert
the Application of it, can be of no Force;
ſince it is as Conditional as any other Chriſtian
Inſtitution. The Salvation of no Man can be
endanger'd by the Ignorance or Paſſions of any
Clergyman in the Uſe of this Power: If they
err in the Exerciſe of it, the Conſequences of
their Error only affect themſelves. The Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration
of the Sacraments is certainly entruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to them: But will any one ſay, that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
are not neceſſary to Salvation; becauſe
they may, through Ignorance or Paſſion, make
an ill Uſe of this Truſt?</p>
            <p>There is nothing in this Doctrine to gratifie
the Pride of Clergymen, or encourage them to
Lord it over the Flock of Chriſt. If you could
ſuppoſe an Atheiſt or a Deift in Orders; he
might be arrogant, and domineer in the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of his Powers: But who, that has the leaſt
Senſe of Religion, can think it matter of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,
that he can deny the Sacraments, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
his Benediction to any of his Flock?
Can he injure or offend the leaſt of theſe; and
will not God take Account? Or, if they fall
through his Offence, will not their Blood be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
at his Hands?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:1141100300:53"/>
Neither is there any thing in it that can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave
the Layity to the Clergy; or make their
Salvation depend upon their Arbitrary Will.
Does any one think his Salvation in danger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Sacraments (the neceſſary Means of
it) are only to be adminiſtred by the Clergy?
Why then muſt the Salvation of <hi>Penitents</hi> be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger'd,
or made dependent on the ſole Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of the Clergy, becauſe they alone can
reconcile them to the Favour of God? If Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
are unjuſtly denied the Sacraments, they
may humbly hope, that God will not lay the
Want of them to their Charge. And if they
are unjuſtly kept out of the Church, and denied
Admittance, they have no Reaſon to fear, but
God will, notwithſtanding, accept them, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
they be in other reſpects proper Objects of
his Favour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But to proceed, your Lordſhip ſays,</hi> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
might poſſibly underſtand the Power of Remitting
and Retaining Sins, to be that Power of Laying their
Hands upon the Sick<note n="*" place="bottom">Pagex</note>.</p>
            <p>Is this Poſſible, my Lord? Then it is <hi>poſſible,</hi>
the Apoſtles might think, that in the Power here
intended to be given them, <hi>nothing at all</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be given them. For the Power of
Healing the Sick, was already confer'd upon
them. Therefore if no more was intended to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:1141100300:54"/>
be given them in this Text, it cannot be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted,
as having entitled them properly to any
Power at all.</p>
            <p>2. The Power mention'd here, was ſomething
that Jeſus promis'd he would give them Hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
Which plainly ſuppoſes, they had it not
then: But they then had the Power of <hi>Healing;</hi>
therefore ſomething elſe muſt be intended
here.</p>
            <p>3. The Power of the <hi>Keys</hi> has always been
look'd upon as the higheſt in the Apoſtolical
Order. But if it related only to the Power of
Healing, it could not be ſo; For the <hi>Seventy,</hi>
who were inferiour to the Apoſtles, had this
Power.</p>
            <p>4. The very Manner of Expreſſion in this
Place, proves, that the Power here intended to
be given, could not relate to <hi>Healing the Sick,</hi>
or to any thing of that nature; but to ſome
<hi>Spiritual Power,</hi> whoſe Effects ſhould not be
<hi>Viſible;</hi> but be made good by virtue of God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.
Thus, <hi>Whomſoever ye ſhall</hi> heal <hi>on Earth,</hi>
I will heal <hi>in Heaven,</hi> borders too near upon an
Abſurdity. There is no occaſion to promiſe to
make <hi>good</hi> ſuch Actions as are good already, and
have antecedently produc'd their Effects. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
who were reſtor'd to Health, to their Sight,
or the Uſe of their Limbs, did not want to be
aſſured, that the Apoſtles, by whom they were
reſtored, had a Power to that End; the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of which Power, prov'd and confirm'd it ſelf.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:1141100300:55"/>
There was no need therefore of a Divine Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance,
that a Perſon who was healed, was actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
healed in virtue of it. But when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
this Promiſe, as relating to a <hi>Power</hi> whoſe
<hi>Effects</hi> are not <hi>viſible;</hi> as the <hi>Pardon of Sins,</hi> the
Terms whereby it is expreſt, are moſt proper:
And it is very reaſonable to ſuppoſe God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
that the Spiritual Powers exercis'd by his
Miniſters on Earth, though they do not here
produce their <hi>viſible Effects,</hi> ſhall yet be made
good and effectual by him in Heaven.</p>
            <p>Theſe Reaſons, my Lord, I ſhould think, are
ſufficient to convince any one, that the Apoſtles
could not <hi>poſſibly</hi> underſtand theſe Words in the
<hi>Sence of your Lordſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let us now conſider the Commiſſion gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to</hi> Peter. <hi>Our Saviour ſaid to him,</hi> Thou
art <hi>Peter,</hi> and upon this Rock I will build my
Church, and the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt
it: And I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom
of Heaven; and whatſoever thou ſhalt bind on Earth,
ſhall be bound in Heaven; and whatſoever thou ſhalt
looſe on Earth, ſhall be looſed in Heaven.</p>
            <p>Now, my Lord, how ſhould it enter into the
Thoughts of <hi>Peter,</hi> that nothing was here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
or promiſed by our Saviour, but a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Healing; which he not only had before,
but alſo many other Diſciples, who were not
Apoſtles? <hi>I will give unto thee the Keys of the
Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> that is, according to your
Lordſhip, <hi>I will give thee Power to heal the Sick.</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:1141100300:56"/>
Can any thing be more contrary to the plain
obvious Sence of the Words? Can any one be
ſaid to have the <hi>Keys</hi> of the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
becauſe he may be the Inſtrument of reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
People to Health? Are Perſons Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Chriſt's Kingdom, with any regard to
Health? How then can He have any Powers
in that Kingdom; or be ſaid to have the <hi>Keys</hi>
of it, who is only empower'd to cure Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers?
Could any one be ſaid to have the <hi>Keys</hi> of
a Temporal Kingdom, who had no Temporal
Power given him in that Kingdom? Muſt not
he therefore who has the <hi>Keys</hi> of a Spiritual
Kingdom, have ſome Spiritual Power in that
Kingdom?</p>
            <p>Chriſt has told us, that his Kingdom is not
of this World. Your Lordſhip has told us, that
it is ſo foreign to every thing of this World,
that no <hi>Worldly Terrors</hi> or Allurements, no Pains
or Pleaſures of the Body, can have any thing to
do with it. Yet here your Lordſhip teaches us,
that He may have the <hi>Keys</hi> of this Spiritual
Kingdom, who has only a Power over Diſeaſes.
My Lord, are not Sickneſs and Health, Sight
and Limbs, Things of this World? Have they
not ſome relation to Bodily Pleaſures and Pains?
How then can a Power about Things wholly
confin'd to this World, be a Power in a Kingdom
that is not of this World? The Force of the
Argument lies here: Our Saviour has aſſur'd us,
that his Kingdom is not of this World: Your
Lordſhip takes it to be of ſo Spiritual a Nature,
that it ought not, nay, that it cannot be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:1141100300:57"/>
or eſtabliſh'd by any Worldly Powers. <hi>Our
Saviour gives to his Apoſtles the Keys of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
Yet you have ſo far forgotten your own
Doctrine, and the Spirituality of this Kingdom,
that you tell us, He here gave them a Temporal
Power of Diſeaſes; though He ſays, they were
the <hi>Keys of his Kingdom</hi> which he gave them.
Suppoſe any Succeſſor of the Apoſtles ſhould
from this Text pretend to the Power of the
Sword, to make People Members of this
Kingdom: Muſt not the Anſwer be, that he
miſtakes the Power, by not conſidering, that
they are only the <hi>Keys</hi> of a <hi>Spiritual,</hi> not of a
Temporal Kingdom, which were here deliver'd
to the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>I humbly preſume, my Lord, that this would
be as good an Anſwer to your Lordſhip's Doctrine,
as to Theirs, who claim the Right of the Sword.
till it can be ſhewn that <hi>Health</hi> and <hi>Sickneſs, Sight</hi>
and <hi>Limbs,</hi> do not as truly relate to the Things
of this World as the Power of the Sword.</p>
            <p>If this Power of the Keys muſt be underſtood,
only as a Power of inflicting or curing Diſeaſes;
then the Words, in the proper Conſtruction of
them, muſt run thus: <hi>Thou art</hi> Peter, <hi>and upon this
Rock I will build my Church,</hi> i. e. a peculiar Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Healthful People, <hi>and the Gates of Hell ſhall
never prevail againſt it;</hi> i. e. They ſhall always
be in a State of Health. <hi>I will give unto Thee, the
Keys of this Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> i. e. Thou ſhalt
have the Power of inflicting and curing Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers;
<hi>and whatſoever thou ſhalt bind on Earth, ſhall be
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:1141100300:58"/>
bound in Heaven,</hi> i.e. on whomſoever thou ſhalt inflict
the Leproſie on Earth. He ſhall be a Leper in
Heaven; <hi>and whatſoever thou ſhalt looſe on Earth,
ſhall be loos'd in Heaven,</hi> i. e. whomſoever thou ſhalt
cure of that Diſeaſe on Earth, ſhall be perfectly
cur'd of it in Heaven.</p>
            <p>This, without putting any Force upon the Words,
is your Lordſhip's own Interpretation; which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
the Honour and Authority of Scriptures as
much as the greateſt Enemy to them can wiſh. If
our Saviour cou'd mean by theſe Words, only a
<hi>Power</hi> of <hi>healing Diſtempers;</hi> or if the Apoſtles un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
them in that Sence, we may as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that when He ſaid, <hi>His Kingdom was not of
this World,</hi> that he meant, it was of this World;
and that the Apoſtles ſo underſtood him too.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But however, for the Benefit and Edification
of the Layity, your Lordſhip has another Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
for them: You ſay,</hi> if they <hi>(the Apoſtles)</hi>
did apply this Power of remitting Sins to the certain Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
of particular Perſons, it is plain, they could do
it upon no other Bottom but this; that God's Will, and
good Pleaſure, about ſuch particular Perſons was infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
communicated to them.</p>
            <p>Pray my Lord, how, or where is this ſo plain?
Is it plain, that they never baptiz'd Perſons, till
God had <hi>infallibly communicated his good Pleaſure to
them about ſuch particular Perſons?</hi> Baptiſm is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
equally Sacred with this other, and puts
the Perſon baptiz'd in the ſame State of Grace,
<hi>that Abſolution</hi> does the Penitent. Baptiſm is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:1141100300:59"/>
for the Remiſſion of Sin. It is an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
to which Abſolution is conſequent, but I
ſuppoſe, Perſons may be baptiz'd without ſuch
<hi>Infallible Communication</hi> promiſed, as your Lordſhip
contends for. If therefore it be not neceſſary for
the Exerciſe of Abſolution by Baptiſm, why muſt
it be neceſſary for Abſolution by the Impoſition
of Hands?</p>
            <p>Can Paſtors without Infallibility, baptize Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
and abſolve, or be the Inſtruments of abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them thereby from their Sins? Are they
not as able to abſove Chriſtian Penitents, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
thoſe who have Apoſtatiz'd? If Human
Knowledge, and the common Rules of the Church,
be ſufficient to direct the Prieſt to whom he
ought to adminiſter the Sacraments; they are
alſo ſufficient for the Exerciſe of this other Part
of the Sacerdotal Office.</p>
            <p>But your Lordſhip proceeds thus: <hi>Not that they</hi>
themſelves <hi>Abſolved any.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No, my Lord, no more than Water in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
of <hi>it ſelf</hi> purifies the Soul from Sin. This
Baptiſmal Water, is, notwithſtanding neceſſary
or the Remiſſion of our Sins.</p>
            <p>Again you ſay, <hi>Not that God was oblig'd to bind
and looſe the Guilt of Aden, according to their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations,
conſidered as their own Deciſions, and
their own Determinations</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Page</note>. No, my Lord; who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:1141100300:60"/>
ever thought ſo? God is not oblig'd to confer
(race by the <hi>Baptiſmal Water,</hi> conſider'd only as
<hi>Water;</hi> but He is, conſider'd as <hi>his own Inſtitution</hi>
for that End and Purpoſe. So, if theſe Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
are conſider'd only as <hi>the Declarations of
Men,</hi> God is not obliged by them: But when
they are conſider'd as the Declarations of <hi>Men</hi>
whom he has eſpecially Authoriz'd to make
<hi>ſuch</hi> Declarations in his Name, then they are
as effectual with God, as any other of his Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution's
whatever.</p>
            <p>I proceed now to a Paragraph that bears as
hard upon our Saviour, as ſome others have done
upon his Apoſtles and their Succeſſors; where
your Lordſhip deſigns to prove, that though
Chriſt claim'd a Power of remitting Sins Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
or in his own Perſon, yet that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
no ſuch Power.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You go upon theſe Words:</hi> If we look back upon
our Saviour himſelf, we ſhall find, that when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
that the Son of Man had Power upon Earth to
forgive Sins, even He himſelf either meant by it, the
Power of a miraculous Releaſing Man from his Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
or if it related to another more Spiritual Sence
of the Words, the Power of declaring, that the Man's
Sins were forgiven by God<note n="*" place="bottom">Preſervative, <hi>p.</hi> 94.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:1141100300:61"/>
The Words of our Saviour, which we are to
look back upon, are theſe: <hi>Whether is it eaſier to
ſay, thy Sins are forgiven thee; or to ſay, ariſe, take
up thy Bed and walk? But that ye may know, the
Son of Man hath Power on Earth to forgive Sins,</hi>
(Mark 2. 9, 10.) As if he had ſaid, <q>Is not the
ſame Divine Authority and Power requir'd?
Is it not a Work as peculiar to God, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
miraculous Cures, as to forgive Sins?
The Reaſon therefore, why I now chuſe to
declare my Authority, rather by ſaying, <hi>Thy
Sins are forgiven thee,</hi> than by ſaying, <hi>Ariſe and
walk,</hi> was, purely to teach you this Truth,
that the Power of the Son of Man is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
to Bodily Cures; but that he has Power
on Earth to forgive Sins.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This, my Lord, is the firſt obvious Sence of
the Words; and therefore I take it to be the
True Sence. But your Lordſhip can look back
upon them, till you find, that Chriſt has not
this Power, though he claims it expreſsly; but
that he only intends a Power of doing <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
or other,</hi> which no more imports a Power
of forgiving Sins, than of remitting any Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Debt or Penalty.</p>
            <p>If our Bleſſed Saviour had intended to teach
the World, that he was inveſted with this Power,
I would gladly know, how he muſt have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
himſelf, to have ſatisfy'd your Lordſhip
that he really had it? He muſt have told you,
that he had not this Power; and then poſſibly,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:1141100300:62"/>
your Lordſhip would have taught us, that he had
this Power. For no one can diſcover any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why you ſhould deny it him; but becauſe
he has in expreſs Words claim'd and aſſerted it.
I hope, your Lordſhip has not ſo low an Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our Saviour's Perſon, as to think it unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
in the Nature of the Thing, that He
ſhould have this Power. Where does it contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
any Principle of Reaſon, to ſay, that a <hi>King</hi>
ſhould be able to pardon his Subjects? Since
there is no Abſurdity then in the Thing it ſelf;
and it is ſo expreſsly aſſerted in Scripture; it is
juſt Matter of Surprize, that your Lordſhip ſhould
carry your Reader from a plain conſiſtent Sence
of the Words, to <hi>either this or that Something or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
the Origin whereof is only to be ſought
for in your Lordſhip's own Invention; rather
than not exclude Chriſt from a Power which he
declar'd he had, and declar'd he had it for this
very Reaſon, <hi>that we might know that he had it.</hi>
Our Saviour has told us, that the Way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
is <hi>narrow.</hi> Your Lordſhip might as reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
prove from hence, that he meant, it was
<hi>broad,</hi> as that he did not mean he could forgive
Sins, when he ſaid, <hi>that ye may know, that the
Son of Man hath Power on Earth to forgive Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Lordſhip has rejected all <hi>Church Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
and deſpis'd the pretended <hi>Powers</hi> of the
Clergy, for this reaſon; becauſe Chriſt is the
<hi>ſole King, ſole Lawgiver, and Judge in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
But, it ſeems, your Lordſhip, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
thinks it now time to depoſe him:
And this <hi>ſole King</hi> in <hi>his own Kingdom,</hi> muſt
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:1141100300:63"/>
not be allow'd to be capable of pardoning his
own Subjects.</p>
            <p>This Doctrine, my Lord; is deliver'd, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
as your other Doctrines, out of a hearty
Concern and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Zeal for the Privileges
of the Layity; and to ſhew, that your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
is not only able to limit as you pleaſe,
the Authority of <hi>Temporal Kings;</hi> but alſo to
make Chriſt himſelf <hi>ſole King,</hi> and yet <hi>no King,</hi>
in his Spiritual Kingdom. For, my Lord, the
Kingdom of Chriſt is a Society, founded in
order to the Reconciliation of Sinners to God.
If therefore Chriſt could not pardon Sins, to
what End could he either erect, or how could
he ſupport his Kingdom, which is only in the
great and laſt Deſign of it, to conſiſt of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
Sinners? He that cannot forgive Sins
in a Kingdom that is erected for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of Sins, can no more be <hi>ſole King</hi> in
it, than he that has no <hi>Temporal Power,</hi> can
be <hi>ſole King</hi> in a <hi>Temporal Kingdom.</hi> Therefore
your Lordſhip has been thus mighty ſerviceable
to the Chriſtian Layity, as to teach them, that
Chriſt is not only <hi>ſole King,</hi> but <hi>no King</hi> in his
Kingdom.</p>
            <p>This is not the Firſt Contradiction your
Lordſhip has unhappily fallen into, in your At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
upon <hi>Kingly Authority.</hi> Not is it the Iaſt;
which I ſhall preſume to obſerve to the <hi>Common
Senſe</hi> of your Layity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:1141100300:64"/>
Again, in this Account of our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
your Lordſhip has made no difference
between Him and his Apoſtles, as to this
<hi>Abſolving Authority.</hi> For you ſay, the <hi>Great
Commiſſion</hi> given to them, imply'd either a
Power of Releaſing Men from their Bodily
Afflictions; or of declaring ſuch to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd,
whom God had aſſur'd them that he
had pardon'd: And this is <hi>all</hi> that you here
allow to Chriſt himſelf.</p>
            <p>Your Lordſhip's calling him ſo often <hi>King,</hi>
and <hi>ſole King, &amp;c.</hi> in his Kingdom, and yet
making him a <hi>Mere Creature</hi> in it, is too
like the Inſult, and deſign'd Sarcaſm of the
<hi>Jews,</hi> who, when they had nail'd him to the
Croſs, writ over his Head, <hi>This is the King of
the Jews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to proceed: Your Lordſhip proves,
That our Saviour had not the Power of
<hi>forgiving Sins;</hi> becauſe <hi>His Way of Expreſſion
was. Thy Sins are forgiven thee. This was plainly
to acknowledge, and keep up that True Notion,
that God alone forgiveth Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us therefore put this Argument in Form.
Chriſt has affirm'd, that he had Power to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
Sins: But his Way was, to ſay, <hi>Thy Sins
are forgiven thee:</hi> Therefore Chriſt had not
Power to forgive Sins. Q. E. D.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:1141100300:65"/>
It is much, your Lordſhip did not recommend this
to your Layity as another <hi>Invincible Demonſtration.</hi>
For by the help of it, my Lord, they may prove,
that our Saviour could no more <hi>heal Diſeaſes,</hi> than
<hi>forgive Sins.</hi> As thus; Chriſt indeed pretends to
a Power of Healing Diſeaſes; but his uſual way
of ſpeaking to the diſeas'd Perſon, was, <hi>Thy Faith
hath made Thee whole;</hi> therefore He had not the
Power of <hi>Healing</hi> Diſeaſes. The Argument has
the ſame force againſt one Power, as againſt the
other. If He did not <hi>forgive Sins,</hi> becauſe he ſaid,
<hi>thy Sins are forgiven Thee;</hi> no more did He heal
Diſeaſes, becauſe he ſaid, <hi>thy Faith hath, made Thee
whole.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have a Claim of ſeveral Debts upon a Man:
I forgive him them all, in theſe Words, <hi>Thy Debts
are remitted Thee.</hi> A Philoſophical Wit ſtands by,
and pretends to prove, that I had not the
Power, of remitting theſe Debts; becauſe I
ſaid, <hi>Thy Debts are remitted Thee.</hi> What can come up
to, or equal ſuch <hi>profound Philoſophy,</hi> but the
<hi>Divinity,</hi> of one who teaches, our Saviour could
not forgive Sins, becauſe He ſaid, <hi>Thy Sins are
forgiven Thee?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But your Lordſhip ſays, the Reaſon why
our Saviour thus expreſſed Himſelf, <hi>Thy Sins
are forgiven Thee, was plainly to keep up that true
Notion, that God alone forgiveth Sins.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
my Lord, according to this Doctrine,
our Saviour was oblig'd not to claim any
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:1141100300:66"/>
Power that was <hi>peculiar</hi> or <hi>appropriated</hi> to God,
<hi>alone.</hi> For if this be an Argument, why He
ſhould not <hi>forgive Sins,</hi> it is alſo an Argument,
that He ought not to claim any other Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
any more than this; which is proper to
God, and only belongs to Him. But, my
Lord, if He did expreſs himſelf thus, that
he might not lay Claim to any thing that
was peculiar to God, how came He in ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Reſpects, to lay Claim to ſuch
things, as are as truly peculiar to God, as
the Forgiveneſs of Sins? How came He in ſo
many Inſtances to make Himſelf equal to God?
How came He to ſay, <hi>Ye believe in God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
alſo in me? And that Men ſhould Worſhip
the Son, even as the Father?</hi> That He was the
Son of God; That he was the Way, the
Truth, and the Life?</p>
            <p>Are not Evangelical Faith, Worſhip and
Truſt, Duties that are ſolely due to God?
Does He not as much invade the Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of God, who lays claim to theſe Duties,
as He that pretends to <hi>forgive Sins?</hi> Did not
Chriſt alſo give his Diſciples <hi>Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>
over Devils and Unclean Spirits, and
Power to heal all manner of Diſeaſes?
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:1141100300:67"/>
Now, if Chriſt did not aſſume a Power to <hi>forgive
Sins,</hi> becauſe God alone could forgive Sins, it is
alſo as unaccountable, that He ſhould exerciſe
other <hi>Authorities</hi> and Powers which are as ſtrictly
peculiar to God, as that of forgiving Sins. As if
a Perſon ſhould diſown that Chriſt is Omniſcient,
becauſe Omniſcience is an <hi>Attribute</hi> of God <hi>Alone;</hi>
and yet confeſs his Omnipotence, which is an
Attribute equally <hi>Divine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But farther, my Lord: Did our Saviour thus
deſignedly expreſs himſelf, leaſt He ſhould be
thought to aſſume any Power which was Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
then it is certain (according to this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion)
that if He had aſſumed any ſuch Power,
or pretended to do what was peculiar to God,
he had been the Occaſion of miſleading Men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Error. For if this be a plain Reaſon, why He
expreſſed himſelf ſo as to diſown this Power, it
is plain, that if He had own'd it. He had been
condemn'd by this Argument, as teaching falſe
Doctrine.</p>
            <p>Now if this would have been interpretatively
falſe Doctrine in Chriſt, to take upon Himſelf
any thing that was peculiar to God, the Apoſtles
were guilty of propagating this falſe Doctrine.
For there is ſcarce any known Attribute or
Power of God, but they aſcribe it to our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.
They declare him Eternal, Omnipotent,
Omniſcient, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Is it not a <hi>true Notion,</hi> that
God alone can Create, and is Governour of the
Univerſe? Yet the Apoſtles expreſly aſſure us
of Chriſt, that <hi>all things were created by Him,</hi> and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1141100300:68"/>
that <hi>God hath put all things in Subjection under his
Feet.</hi> 'Tis very ſurpriſing, that your Lordſhip
ſhould exclude Chriſt from this Power of <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving</hi>
Sins, tho' he has expreſly ſaid He could
forgive Sins, becauſe ſuch a Power belongs only
to God; when it appears thro' the whole Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
that there is ſcarce any Divine Power
which our Saviour himſelf has not claim'd, nor
any Attribute of God, but what his Apoſtles have
aſcrib'd to him. They have made Him the <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator,</hi>
the <hi>Preſerver,</hi> the <hi>Governour</hi> of the Univerſe,
the Author of Eternal Salvation to all that obey
him; and yet your Lordſhip tells us, that He did
not pretend to <hi>forgive Sins,</hi> becauſe that was a
Power peculiar to God.</p>
            <p>Here is then (to ſpeak in your Lordſhip's ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
Style) an <hi>immoveable Reſting-Place</hi> for your
Laity to ſet their Feet upon; here is an <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that will laſt them for ever;</hi> They muſt believe
that our Saviour did not forgive Sins, <hi>becauſe</hi> this
was a Power that belong'd to God, tho' the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
aſſure us that every other Divine Power
belong'd to Chriſt. That is, they muſt believe,
that tho' our Saviour claim'd all Divine Powers,
yet not this Divine Power, <hi>becauſe</hi> it is a Divine
Power. And, my Lord, if they have the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Senſe to believe this, they may alſo believe
that tho' our Saviour took human Nature upon
him, yet that he had not a human Soul, becauſe it
is proper to Man. They may believe, that any
Perſon who has all Kingly Power, cannot remit
or reprieve a Malefactor, <hi>becauſe</hi> it is an Act of
Kingly Power to do it; or that a Biſhop cannot
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:1141100300:69"/>
ſuſpend any Offender of his Dioceſe, becauſe it
is an Act of Epiſcopal Power to do it. All theſe
Reaſons are as ſtrong and <hi>Demonſtrative</hi> as that
Chriſt, who claim'd all Divine Powers, could
not forgive Sins, <hi>becauſe</hi> it was a <hi>Divine Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, In this Argument your Lordſhip has
plainly declar'd againſt the Divinity of Chriſt,
and rank'd him in the Order of Creatures. Your
Lordſhip ſays, Chriſt did not forgive Sins, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is God <hi>alone who can forgive Sins;</hi> as plain
an Argument as can be offer'd, that in your
Lordſhip's Opinion, Chriſt is not God: For if
you believ'd him, in a true and proper Senſe,
God, how could you exclude him from the
Power of forgiving Sins, <hi>becauſe</hi> God alone can
forgive Sins? It is inconſiſtent with Senſe and
Reaſon to deny this Power to Chriſt becauſe it
is a Divine Power, bat only becauſe you believe
him not to be a Divine Perſon. If Chriſt was
God, then he might forgive Sins, tho' God alone
can forgive Sins: But you ſay, Chriſt cannot
forgive Sins, becauſe God <hi>alone</hi> can forgive Sins;
therefore it is plain, that according to your
Lordſhip's Doctrine, Chriſt is not truly, or in a
proper Senſe, God.</p>
            <p>Here, my Lord, I deſire again to appeal to
the <hi>Common Senſe</hi> of your Laity; let them judge
betwixt the Scriptures and your Lordſhip. The
Scriptures plainly and frequently aſcribe all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Attributes to Chriſt: They make him the
Creatour and Governour of the World; God
over all, bleſſed for ever. Yet your Lordſhip
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:1141100300:70"/>
makes him a Creature, and denies him <hi>ſuch</hi> a
Power, becauſe it belongs only to God.</p>
            <p>You your ſelf, my Lord, have allow'd him to be
abſolute Ruler over the Conſciences of Men; to
be an arbitrary Diſpenſer of the Means of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Mankind; than which Powers, none can
be more Divine: And yet you hold, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
forgive Sins, becauſe Pardon of Sin can only
be the Effect of a Divine Power.</p>
            <p>Is it not equally a Divine Power, (even ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to your Lordſhip) to rule over the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
of Men, to give Laws of Salvation, and
to act in theſe Affairs with an uncontroulable
Power, as <hi>to forgive Sins?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Lord, let their Common Senſe here diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the Abſurdity (for I muſt call it ſo) of your
<hi>New Scheme</hi> of Government in Chriſt's Kingdom.
Chriſt is <hi>abſolute</hi> Lord of it, (according to your
ſelf) and can make or unmake Laws relating to
it; can diſpenſe or withold Grace as he pleaſes
in this Spiritual Kingdom, all which Powers are
purely Divine, yet you ſay he cannot forgive
Sins, tho' every expreſs Power which you have
allow'd him over the Conſciences of Men, be as
truly a <hi>Divine Power</hi> as that of <hi>forgiving Sins.</hi> Has
not Chriſt a proper and perſonal Power to give
Grace to his Subjects? Is he not Lord over their
Conſciences? And are not theſe Powers as truly
appropriated to God? And has not your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
often taught them to be ſo, as that of <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs
of Sins?</hi> Is it not as much the Prerogative
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:1141100300:71"/>
of God to have any natural intrinſick Power, to
confer Grace, or any Spiritual Benefit to the Souls
of Men, as to forgive Sins? Has not your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
deſpis'd all the Adminiſtrations of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
becauſe God's Graces can only come from
himſelf, and are only to be receiv'd from his own
Hands? The Concluſion therefore is this, either
Chriſt has a Perſonal intrinſick Power to confer
Grace in his Kingdom, or he has not; if you ſay
he has not, then you are chargable with the
Colluſion of making him a King in a Spiritual
Kingdom, where you allow him no Spiritual
Power: If you ſay he has, then you fall into this
Contradiction, that you allow him to have Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Powers, tho' he cannot have Divine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
that is, you allow him to <hi>give Grace,</hi> tho' it
is a Divine Power, and not to <hi>forgive Sins,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is a Divine Power. My Lord, I wiſh
your Laity (if there be any to whom you can
render it intelligible) much Joy of ſuch profound
Divinity. Or if there are others who are more
taken with your Lordſhip's Sincerity, I deſire
them not to paſs by this following remarkable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of it: Your Lordſhip has here as plainly
declar'd, as Words can conſequentially declare
any thing, that you do not believe Chriſt to be
God, yet profeſs your ſelf Biſhop of a Church,
whofſe Liturgy in ſo many repeated Teſtimonies
declares the contrary Doctrine, and which obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
you to expreſs your Aſſent and Conſent to
ſuch Doctrine. My Lord, I here call upon your
<hi>Sincerity,</hi> either Declare Chriſt to be Perfect God,
and then ſhew why he could not <hi>forgive Sins,</hi> or
Deny him to be Perfect God, and then ſhew how
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:1141100300:72"/>
you can ſincerely declare your <hi>Aſſent</hi> and <hi>Conſent</hi>
to the Doctrines of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, my Lord, has an Appearance of Preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rication,
which you cannot, I hope, charge upon
any of your Adverſaries; who if they cannot think,
that to be ſincere is the only thing neceſſary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
Men to the Favour of God, yet may
have as much, or poſſibly more Sincerity, than
thoſe who do think ſo.</p>
            <p>Before I take leave of your Lordſhip, I muſt take
Notice of a <hi>Reſting-Place,</hi> a <hi>ſtrong Retreat a laſting
Foundation,</hi> i. e. <hi>a Demonſtration in the ſtricteſt Senſe of</hi>
the Words, that all <hi>Church-Communion</hi> is unneceſſary.</p>
            <p>Your Lordſhip ſets it out in theſe Words.</p>
            <q>
               <p>I am not now going to accuſe you of a Hereſie againſt
Charity, but of a Hereſie againſt the Poſſibility and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Things. <hi>As thus,</hi> Mr. <hi>Nelſon</hi> (for Inſtance)
thinks himſelf oblig'd in Conſcience to Communicate
with ſome of our Church. Upon this you declare he
hath no Title to God's Mercy; and you and all the World
allow, that if he communicates with you whilſt his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
tells him it is a Sin, he is ſelf-condemn'd and out
oſ God's Favour. That Notion, (viz. <hi>the Neceſſity
of Church-Communion</hi>) therefore, which implies
this great invincible Abſurdity, cannot be true.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Pray, my Lord, what is this wond'rous Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity
of a <hi>Demonſtration,</hi> but the common Caſe
of an <hi>erroneous Conſcience?</hi> Did the ſtricteſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders
for Church-Communion ever teach, <hi>that
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:1141100300:73"/>
any Terms</hi> are to be comply'd with againſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience?
But its a ſtrange Concluſion to infer
from thence, that there is no Obligation to
Communion, or that all Things are to be held
indifferent, becauſe they are not to be comply'd
with againſt one's Conſcience.</p>
            <p>The Truths of the Chriſtian Religion have the
ſame Nature and Obligation, whatever our Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are of them, and thoſe that are neceſſary
to be believed, continue ſo, whither we can
perſwade our ſelves to believe them or not. I
ſuppoſe your Lordſhip will not ſay, that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Faith and neceſſary Inſtitutions of the
Chriſtian Religion, are no otherways neceſſary,
than becauſe we believe them to be ſo, that our
Perſwaſion is the only Cauſe of the Neceſſity; but
if their Neceſſity be not owing merely to our
belief of them, then it is certain that our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief
of them, cannot make them leſs neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
If the Ordinances of Chriſt, and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Faith are neceſſary, becauſe Chriſt has
made them ſo, that Neceſſity muſt continue the
ſame, whether we believe and obſerve them or
not.</p>
            <p>So that, my Lord, we may ſtill maintain the
neceſſity of Church-Communion, and the ſtrict
obſervance of Chriſt's Ordinances, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
that People have different perſwaſions
in theſe Matters, preſuming <hi>that our Opinions</hi> can
no more alter the nature or neceſſity of Chriſt's
Inſtitutions, than we can believe <hi>Error</hi> into <hi>Truth,
Good</hi> into <hi>Evil,</hi> or <hi>Light</hi> into <hi>Darkneſs.</hi> I ſhall
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:1141100300:74"/>
think my ſelf no <hi>Heretick againſt the Nature of
Things,</hi> tho' I tell a <hi>Conſcientious Socinian,</hi> that the
Divinity of Chriſt is neceſſary to be believed,
or a <hi>Conſcientious Jew,</hi> that it is neceſſary to be
a Chriſtian in order to be ſaved. But if your
Lordſhips Demonſtration was accepted, we
ſhould be oblig'd to give up the neceſſity of
every Doctrine and Inſtitution, to every Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer
that pretended Conſcience. We muſt
not tell any Party of People, that they are in
any danger for being out of Communion with
us, if they do but follow their own Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>Your Lordſhip's <hi>Invincible Demonſtration</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
thus.</p>
            <p>We muſt not inſiſt upon the Neceſſity of joyning with
any particular Church, becauſe then Conſcientious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
will be in Danger either way; for if there be a
Neceſſity of it, then there is a Danger if they do not
joyn with it, and if they comply againſt their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
the Danger is the ſame.</p>
            <p>What an inextricable Difficulty is here! How
ſhall Divinity or Logick be able to relieve us!</p>
            <p>Be pleas'd my Lord, to accept of this Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in lieu of your Demonſtration.</p>
            <p>I will ſuppoſe the Caſe of a <hi>Conſcientious Jew;</hi>
I tell him that Chriſtianity is the only covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Method of Salvation, and that he can have
no Title to the Favour of God, 'till he profeſſes
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:1141100300:75"/>
the Faith of Chriſt. What, replies he, would
you direct me to do? If I embrace Chriſtianity
againſt my Conſcience, I am out of God's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
and if I follow my Conſcience, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
a <hi>Jew,</hi> I am alſo out of his Favour. The
Anſwer is this, my Lord; The <hi>Jew</hi> is to obey
his Conſcience, and to be left to the <hi>uncovenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
unpromiſed</hi> Terms of God's <hi>Mercy,</hi> whilſt the
Conſcientious Chriſtian is entitled to the <hi>expreſs
and promiſed favours of</hi> God.</p>
            <p>There is ſtill the ſame abſolute neceſſity of
believing in Chriſt, Chriſtianity is ſtill the only
Method of Salvation; tho' the ſincere <hi>Jew</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſo perſwade himſelf; and we ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
it to all <hi>Jews</hi> and Unbelievers whatſoever,
that they can only be ſav'd by embracing Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.
That a falſe Religion, does not become
a true one; nor a true one falſe, in Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of their Opinions; but that if they are
ſo unhappy, as to refuſe the Covenant of Grace,
they muſt be left to ſuch <hi>Mercy</hi> as is without any
Covenant. And now, my Lord, what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of this mighty Demonſtration? Does it
prove that Chriſtianity is not neceſſary, becauſe
the Conſcientious <hi>Jew</hi> may think it is not ſo?
It may as well prove, that the Moon is no larger
than a Man's Head, becauſe an honeſt ignorant
Countryman may think it no larger.</p>
            <p>Is there any Perſon of <hi>Common Senſe,</hi> who
would think it a Demonſtration, that he is not
obliged to go to Church, becauſe a <hi>Conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
Diſſenter will not? Could he think it leſs
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:1141100300:76"/>
neceſſary to be a Chriſtian, becauſe a <hi>ſincere Jew</hi>
cannot embrace Chriſtianity? Could he take it
to be an indifferent Matter, whether he believed
the Divinity of Chriſt, becauſe a <hi>Conſcientious
Socinian</hi> cannot? Yet this is your Lordſhip's <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
Demonſtration,</hi> that we ought not to
inſiſt upon the neceſſity of Church-Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
becauſe a <hi>Conſcientious Disbeliever</hi> cannot
comply with it.</p>
            <p>A ſmall Degree of <hi>Common Senſe,</hi> would teach
a Man that true Religion, and the Terms of
Salvation muſt have the ſame obligatory Force,
whether we reaſon rightly about them or not;
and that they who believe and practice accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to them, are in expreſs Covenant with
God, which entitles them to his Favour; whilſt
thoſe who are ſincerely Erronious, have nothing
but the ſincerity of their Errors to plead, and
are left to ſuch Mercy of God, as is without any
Promiſe. Here, my Lord, is nothing frightful
or abſurd in this Doctrine, they who are in the
Church which Chriſt has founded, are upon
Terms which entitles them to God's Favour;
they who are out of it, fall to his Mercy.</p>
            <p>But your Lordſhip is not content with the
Terms of the Goſpel, or a Doctrine that only
ſaves a particular Sort of People; this is a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
View, not wide enough for your Notions
of <hi>Liberty.</hi> Particular Religions, and particular
Covenants, are <hi>demonſtrated</hi> to be abſurd, <hi>becauſe</hi>
particular Perſons may Diſ-believe, or not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:1141100300:77"/>
Your Lordſhip muſt have Doctrines that will
ſave all People alike, in every way that their
Perſwaſion leads them to take: But, my Lord,
there needs be no greater Demonſtration againſt
your Lordſhip's Doctrine, than that it equally fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
every way of Worſhip; for an Argument
which equally proves every Thing, has been ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
thought to prove nothing; which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
to be the Caſe of your Lordſhip's <hi>Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Demonſtration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Lordſhip indeed only inſtances in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Perſon, Mr. <hi>Nelſon;</hi> but your <hi>Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
is as ſerviceable to any other Perſon who has
left any other Church whatever. The <hi>Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Quaker, Muggletonian, Independant,</hi> or <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
&amp;c. have the ſame right to obey Conſcience,
and blame any Church that aſſumes a Power of
cenſuring them, as Mr. <hi>Nelſon</hi> had; and if they
are cenſur'd by any Church, that Church is
as guilty of the ſame <hi>Hereſie againſt the Nature of
Things,</hi> as that Church which cenſur'd Mr. <hi>Nel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
or any Church that ſhould pretend to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
any other Perſon whatever.</p>
            <p>I am not at all Surpriz'd, that your Lordſhip
ſhould teach this Doctrine, but its ſomething
ſtrange, that ſuch an Argument ſhould be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded
upon the World as an unheard of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration,</hi>
and that in an <hi>Appeal to common Senſe.</hi>
Suppoſe ſome Body or other in defence of your
Lordſhip, ſhould take upon him to demonſtrate
to the World, that there is no ſuch Thing as
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:1141100300:78"/>
Colour, becauſe there are ſome People that
can't ſee it; or Sounds, becauſe there are ſome
who don't hear them; He would have found out
the only <hi>Demonſtrations</hi> in the World that could
equal your Lordſhips, and would have as much
reaſon to call thoſe <hi>Hereticks againſt the Nature of
Things,</hi> who ſhould diſ-believe him, and inſiſt
upon the reality of Sounds, as your Lordſhip has
to call your Adverſaries ſo.</p>
            <p>For, is there no neceſſity of Church-Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
becauſe there are ſome who don't con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it? Then there are no Sounds, becauſe
there are ſome who don't hear them; for it is
certainly as eaſie to believe away the <hi>Truth</hi> and
<hi>Reality,</hi> as the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of Things.</p>
            <p>Some People have only taught us the <hi>innocency
of Error,</hi> and been content with ſetting forth its
harmleſs Qualities; but your Lordſhip has been
a more hearty Advocate, and given it a <hi>Power</hi>
over every Truth and Inſtitution of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
If we have but an <hi>erronious Conſcience,</hi> the
whole Chriſtian Diſpenſation is cancell'd; all
the Truth and Doctrines in the Bible are <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated</hi>
to be unneceſſary, if we do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them.</p>
            <p>How unhappily have the ſeveral Parties of
Chriſtians been diſputing for many Ages, who
if they could but have found out this <hi>intelligible
Demonſtration,</hi> (from the Caſe of an erroneous
Conſcience) would have ſeen the abſurdity of
pretending to neceſſary Doctrines, and inſiſting
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:1141100300:79"/>
upon <hi>Church-Communion;</hi> but it muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
your Lordſhip's <hi>new invented Engine</hi> for
the Deſtruction of <hi>Churches;</hi> and it may be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>good Chriſtians of no Church</hi> will return your
Lordſhip their Thanks for it.</p>
            <p>Your Lordſhip has thought it a mighty Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to ſome Doctrines in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
that the Papiſts might make ſome Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of them: But yet your own Doctrine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends
<hi>all</hi> Communions alike, and ſerves the <hi>Jew</hi>
and <hi>Socinian, &amp;c.</hi> as much as any other ſort of
People. Tho' this ſufficiently appears, from
what has been already ſaid, yet that it may be
ſtill more obvious to the <hi>Common Senſe</hi> of every
one, I ſhall reduce theſe Doctrines to Practice,
and ſuppoſe for once, that your Lordſhip intends
to convert a Jew, a Quaker, or Socinian.</p>
            <p>Now in order to make a Convert of any of
them, theſe Preliminary PROPOSITIONS
are to be firſt laid down according to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's

that can <hi>juſtify</hi> our adhering to it, but that all is
founded in our Perſonal Perſuaſion. Which your
Lordſhip thus proves, <hi>When we left the Popiſh Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
was it becauſe they were</hi> actually <hi>corrupt?</hi>
No; <hi>The Reaſon was, becauſe we thought them ſo.</hi>
Therefore if we might leave the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi>
not becauſe her Doctrines were corrupt, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we thought them ſo, then the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
will juſtify any one elſe, in leaving any

good Members of it, we muſt ſhew our ſelves
Subjects of Chriſt alone, without any Regard to
Man's Judgment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Propoſ.</hi> VII. That as Chriſt's Kingdom is not

            <p>Theſe, my Lord, are your Lordſhips own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
expreſſed in your own Terms without
any Exaggeration.</p>
            <p>And now, my Lord, begin as ſoon as you
pleaſe, either with a <hi>Quaker, Socinian,</hi> or <hi>Jew;</hi>
uſe any Argument whatſoever to convert them,
and you ſhall have a ſufficient Anſwer from your
own Propoſitions.</p>
            <p>Will you tell the <hi>Jew</hi> that Chriſtianity is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to Salvation? <hi>He will anſwer from</hi>
Propoſ. I. That we are neither more or leſas in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of God, for living in any particular Method or
way of Worſhip, but purely as we are Sincere.</p>
            <p>Will your Lordſhip tell him, that the Truth of
Chriſtianity is ſo well aſſerted, that there is no
Excuſe left for Unbelievers? He will anſwer
from <hi>Propoſ.</hi> V. <hi>That all Religion is founded in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
Perſuaſion; that as your Lordſhip does not believe
that Chriſt is come, becauſe he is actually come, but
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:1141100300:82"/>
becauſe you think he is come; ſo He does not disbelieve
Chriſt becauſe he is not actually come, but becauſe he
thinks he is not come.</hi> So that here, my Lord, the
<hi>Jew</hi> gives as good a reaſon why he is not a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
as your Lordſhip does why you are not a
Papiſt.</p>
            <p>If your Lordſhip ſhould turn the Diſcourſe to
a <hi>Quaker,</hi> and offer him any Reaſons for Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
the Doctrine of the <hi>Church of England,</hi>
you can't poſſibly have any better Succeſs;
any one may ſee from your <hi>Propoſitions,</hi> that no
Argument can be urg'd but what your Lordſhip
has there fully anſwered. For ſince you allow
nothing to the <hi>Truth</hi> of Doctrines, or the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency</hi>
of any Communion as ſuch, it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrable
that no Church or Communion can
have any Advantage above another, which is
abſolutely neceſſary in order to perſuade any
ſenſible Man to exchange any Communion for
another.</p>
            <p>Will your Lordſhip tell a <hi>Quaker</hi> that there is
any Danger in that particular Way that he is in?</p>
            <p>He can anſwer from <hi>Propoſ.</hi> lſt, 3d, and 4th.
<hi>That a Conſcientious Perſon can't be in any Danger for
being out of any particular Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Will your Lordſhip tell him that his Religion is
condemned by the Univerſal Church?</p>
            <p>He can anſwer from <hi>Propoſ.</hi> 2d, <hi>That no Church
ought to unchurch another, or declare it out of God's
Favour.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:1141100300:83"/>
Will you tell him that Chriſt has inſtituted
Sacraments as <hi>neceſſary Means</hi> of Grace, which he
neglects to Obſerve?</p>
            <p>He will anſwer you from <hi>Propoſ.</hi> IX. <hi>That God's
Graces are only to be received</hi> immediately from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
And to think that <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> or the
ſprinkling of Water is neceſſary to Salvation, is
as abſurd, as to think any Order of the Clergy,
is neceſſary to recommend us to God.</p>
            <p>Will your Lordſhip tell him that he diſpleaſes
God, by not holding ſeveral Articles of Faith,
which Chriſt has required us to believe?</p>
            <p>He can reply from <hi>Propoſ.</hi> III. <hi>That nothing
loſes us the Favour of God</hi> but a <hi>wicked Inſincerity.</hi>
And from <hi>Propoſ.</hi> V. That as your Lordſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
ſuch Things, not becauſe they are actually
to be believ'd, but becauſe you think ſo; ſo he
disbelieves them, not becauſe they are actually
falſe, but becauſe he thinks ſo.</p>
            <p>Will your Lordſhip tell him he is inſincere?</p>
            <p>He can reply from <hi>Propoſ.</hi> VI. <hi>That to aſſume to
know the Hearts and Sincerity of Men, is Nonſenſe and
Blaſphemy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Will your Lordſhip tell him that he ought to

            </p>

ſo fully confuted by the judicious and

Part of the Controverſie is finally determined.</p>
            <p>I hope, my Lord, that I have delivered no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
here, that needs any Excuſe or Apology
to the Laity, that they will not be perſwaded,
thro' any vain Pretence of Liberty, to make
themſelves Parties againſt the firſt Principles of
Chriſtianity; or imagine, that whilſt we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
for the poſitive Inſtitutions of the Goſpel,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:1141100300:86"/>
the Neceſſity of Church-Communion, or the
Excellency of our own, we are robbing them of
their natural Rights, or interfering with their
Privileges. Whilſt we appear in the Defence of
any part of Chriſtianity, we are engag'd for them
in the common Cauſe of Chriſtians. and I am
perſwaded better things of the Laity, than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that ſuch Labours will render either our
Perſons or Profeſſions hateful to them. Your
Lordſhip has indeed endeavoured to give an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidious
Turn to the Controverſie, by calling upon
the Laity to aſſert their Libertys, as if they were
in Danger from the Principles of Chriſtianity.
—But, my Lord, what Liberty does, any Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
loſe, by our aſſerting, that <hi>Church-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi>
is neceſſary? What Privilege is taken
from them by our teaching the Danger of certain
Ways and Methods of Religion? Is a Man made
a Slave becauſe he is caution'd againſt the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> againſt <hi>Fanaticiſm, Popery,</hi> or
<hi>Socinianiſm?</hi> Is he in a State of Bondage, becauſe
the Sacraments are neceſſary, and none but Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopal
Clergy ought to adminiſter them? Is his
Freedom deſtroy'd becauſe there is a particular
Order of Men appointed by God to miniſter in
Holy Things, and be ſerviceable to him in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending
him to the Favour of God? Can
any Perſons, my Lord, think theſe things
breaches upon their Liberty, except ſuch as
think the Commandments a Burden? Is there
any more Hardſhip in ſaying, thou ſhalt keep to
an Epiſcopal Church, than thou ſhalt be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd?
Or in requiring People to receive parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Sacraments, than to believe particular
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:1141100300:87"/>
Books of Scripture to be the Word of God?
If ſome other Advocate for the Laity, ſhould,
out of Zeal for their Rights, declare that they
need not believe one half of the Articles in the
Creed; if they would but aſſert their Liberty,
He would be as true a Friend, and deſerve the

            <p>I Hope your Lordſhip will not think it Unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
or Impertinent, to offer here a word
or two in anſwer to ſome Objections againſt my
former Letter.</p>
            <p>To begin with the Doctrine of the uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
Succeſſion of the Clergy.</p>
            <p>I have, as I think, prov'd that there is a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Sommiſſion requir'd to qualifie any one to
exerciſe the Prieſtly Office, and that ſeeing this
Divine Commiſſion can only be had from ſuch
particular Perſons as God has appointed to give
it, therefore it is neceſſary that there ſhould be
a continual Succeſſion of ſuch Perſons, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to keep up a Commiſſion'd Order of the
Clergy. For if the Commiſſion it ſelf be to
deſcend thro' Ages; and diſtinguiſh the Clergy
from the Laity; it is certain the Perſons who
alone can give this Commiſſion muſt deſcend
thro' the ſame Ages, and Conſequently an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted
Succeſſion is as neceſſary, as that
the Clergy have a Divine Commiſſion. Take
away this Succeſſion, and the Clergy may as
well be Ordain'd by one Perſon as another; a
Number of Women may as well give them a
Divine Commiſſion, as a Congregation of any
Men, they may indeed appoint Perſons to Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate
in Holy Orders, for the ſake of <hi>Decency</hi>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:1141100300:89"/>
and <hi>Order;</hi> but then there is no more in it, than
an external <hi>Decency</hi> and <hi>Order,</hi> they are no more
the Prieſts of <hi>God,</hi> then thoſe that pretended
to make them ſo. If we had loſt the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
it would be very well to make as good
Books as we could, and come as near them as
poſſible; but then it would be not only Folly,
but Preſumption, to call them the Word of
God. But I proceed to the Objections againſt
the Doctrine of an uninterrupted Succeſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is ſaid, that there is no mention made
of it in Scripture, as having any relation to the
being of a Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That it is ſubject to ſo great Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
that if it be neceſſary, we can't now be
ſure we are in the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That it is a Popiſh Doctrine, and gives
them great Advantage over us.</p>
            <p>I begin with the <hi>1ſt</hi> Objection, that there
is no mention made of it in the Scriptures,
which tho' I think 1 have ſufficiently anſwer'd in
this Letter, I ſhall here farther conſider.</p>
            <p>Pray, my Lord, is it not a true Doctrine, that
<hi>the Scriptures contain all things neceſſary to Salvation?</hi>
But, my Lord, it is no where expreſly ſaid, that
<hi>the Scriptures contain all things neceſſary to Salvation.</hi>
It is no where ſaid, that no other Articles of Faith
need be believed. Where does it appear in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
that the Scriptures were writ by any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:1141100300:90"/>
Command? Have any of the Goſpels or
Epiſtles this Authority to recommend them?
Are they neceſſary to be believ'd, becauſe there
is any Law of Chriſt concerning the Neceſſity of
believing them?</p>
            <p>May I reject this uninterrupted Succeſſion,
becauſe it is not mention'd in Scripture? And
may I not as well reject all the Goſpels? Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
your Authority, my Lord, mention your
Texts of Scripture, where Chriſt has <hi>hung the
Salvation of Men</hi> upon their believing, that
St. <hi>Matthew</hi> or St. <hi>John</hi> wrote ſuch a Book ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Hundred Years ago. Theſe, my Lord, are
<hi>Niceties</hi> and <hi>Trifles</hi> which are not to be found in
Scripture, and conſequently have nothing to do
with the Salvation of Men.</p>
            <p>Now if nothing be to be held as neceſſary, but
what is expreſly required in ſo many Words in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
then it can never be prov'd that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
themſelves are a <hi>ſtanding Rule of Faith in all
Ages,</hi> ſince it is no where expreſly aſſerted, nor
is it any where ſaid, that the Scriptures ſhould
be continued as a Rule of Faith in all Ages. Is
it an Objection againſt the Neceſſity of a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Succeſſion of the Clergy, that it is not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
in the Scripture? And is it not as good
a one againſt the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of making Scripture the
<hi>ſtanding Rule of Faith in all Ages,</hi> ſince it is never
ſaid, that they were to be continu'd as a ſtanding
Rule in all Ages? If things are only neceſſary
for being ſaid to be ſo in Scripture, then all that
are not thus taught are equally unneceſſary, and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:1141100300:91"/>
conſequently it is no more neceſſary that the
Scripture ſhould be a fix'd Rule of Faith in all
Ages, than that there ſhould be Biſhops to ordain
in all Ages.</p>
            <p>Again, where ſhall we find it in Scripture, that
the Sacraments are to be continued in every Age
of the Church? Where is it ſaid, that they ſhall
always be the ordinary Means of Grace neceſſary
to be obſerv'd? Is there any Law of Chriſt, any
Text of Scripture, that expreſly aſſerts, that if
we leave the Uſe of the Sacraments, we are out
of Covenant with God? Is it any where di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
ſaid, that we muſt never lay them aſide,
or that they will be <hi>perpetually</hi> neceſſary? No,
my Lord, this is a <hi>Nicety</hi> and <hi>Trifle</hi> not to be <hi>found
in Scripture: There is no Streſs laid there upon this
Matter,</hi> but upon things <hi>of a quite different: Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I now preſume, my Lord, that every one who
has common Senſe plainly ſees, that if this Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of the Clergy be to be deſpis'd, becauſe
it is not expreſly requir'd in Scripture; it unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably
follows, that we may reject the Scriptures,
as not being a <hi>ſtanding Rule of Faith in all Ages;</hi> we
way diſuſe the Sacraments, as not the <hi>Ordinary
Means of Grace in all Ages;</hi> ſince this is no more
mentioned in the Scriptures, or <hi>expreſly</hi> requir'd,
than this uninterrupted Succeſſion.</p>
            <p>If it be a good Argument againſt the Neceſſity
of Episcopal Ordainers, that it is never ſaid in
Scripture, that there ſhall <hi>always</hi> be ſuch Ordainers;
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:1141100300:92"/>
it is certainly as concluſive againſt the Uſe
of the Sacraments in every Age, that it is no
where ſaid in Scripture they ſhall be uſed in
<hi>All Ages.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If no Government or Order of the Clergy be
to be held as neceſſary, becauſe no ſuch Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
is aſſerted in Scripture; it is certain this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
as ſtrongly againſt <hi>Government,</hi> and <hi>the
Order it ſelf,</hi> as againſt any <hi>Particular</hi> Order. For
it is no more ſaid in Scripture, that there ſhall be
an Order of Clergy, than that there ſhall be any
<hi>particular</hi> Order; therefore if this Silence proves
againſt any <hi>particular</hi> Order of Clergy, it proves
as much againſt <hi>Order it ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Should therefore any of your Lordſhip's
Friends have ſo much Church-Zeal as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
for the Neceſſity of <hi>ſome Order,</hi> tho' of no
particular Order; he muſt fall under your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's
Diſpleaſure, and be prov'd as meer a
<hi>Dreamer</hi> and <hi>Trifler,</hi> as thoſe who aſſert the Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of Epiſcopal Ordination. For if it be plain,
that there need be no <hi>Epiſcopal Clergy,</hi> becauſe it
is not ſaid there ſhall <hi>always</hi> be Epiſcopal Clergy;
it is undeniably plain, that there need be <hi>no Order</hi>
of the Clergy, ſince it is no where ſaid, there
ſhall be <hi>an Order</hi> of Clergy: Therefore whoever
ſhall contend for an Order of Clergy, will be as
much condemn'd by your Lordſhip's Doctrine,
as he that declares for the Epiſcopal Clergy.</p>
            <p>The Truth of the Matter is this, If nothing is
to be eſteemed of any Moment, but counted as
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:1141100300:93"/>
mere <hi>Trifle</hi> and <hi>Nicety</hi> among Chriſtians, which
is not <hi>expreſly</hi> requir'd in the Scriptures; then it
is a <hi>Trifle</hi> and <hi>Nicety,</hi> whether we believe the
Scripture to be a <hi>ſtanding Rule of Faith</hi> in all Ages,
whether we uſe the Sacraments in <hi>all Ages,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we have any Clergy at all, whether we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the Lord's Day, whether we baptize our
Children, or whether we go to publick Worſhip;
for none of theſe things are expreſly required in
ſo many Words in Scripture. But if your Lordſhip,
with the reſt of the Chriſtian World, will take
theſe things to be of Moment, and well prov'd,
becauſe they are founded in Scripture, tho' not
in <hi>expreſs Terms,</hi> or under <hi>plain Commands;</hi> if you
will acknowledge theſe Matters to be well aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
becauſe they may be gather'd from Scripture,
and are confirm'd by the univerſal Practice of the
Church in all Ages, (which is all the Proof that
they are capable of) I don't doubt but it will
appear, that this <hi>ſucceſſive Order of the Clergy</hi> is
founded on the ſame Evidence, and ſupported
by as great Authority, ſo that it muſt be thought
of the ſame Moment with theſe things, by all
unprejudic'd Perſons.</p>
            <p>For, my Lord, tho' it be not expreſly ſaid, that
there ſhall <hi>always</hi> be a <hi>Succeſſion of Epiſcopal Clergy,</hi>
yet it is a Truth founded in Scripture it ſelf, and
aſſerted by the univerſal Voice of Tradition in
the firſt and ſucceeding Ages of the Church.</p>
            <p>It is thus founded in Scripture: There we are
taught that, the Prieſthood is a <hi>Poſitive Inſtitution;</hi>
that no Man can take this Office unto himſelf;
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:1141100300:94"/>
that neither our Saviour himſelf, nor his Apoſtles,
nor any other Perſon, however extraordinarily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd
with Gifts from God, could, <hi>as ſuch,</hi> exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
the Prieſtly Office, till they had God's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
Commiſſion for that purpoſe. Now how
does it appear, that the Sacraments are Poſitive
Inſtitutions, but that they are conſecrated to ſuch
Ends and Effects, as of themſelves they were no
way qualify'd to perform? Now as it appears
from Scripture, that Men, <hi>as ſuch,</hi> however en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd,
were not qualify'd to take this Office up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them without God's Appointment; it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratively
certain, that Men ſo call'd are as
much to be eſteem'd a <hi>Poſitive Inſtitution,</hi> as Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ſo choſen can be call'd a <hi>Poſitive Inſtitution.</hi>
All the Perſonal Abilities of Men conferring no
more Authority to exerciſe the Office of a
Clergy-Man, than the natural Qualities of Water
to make a Sacrament: So that the one Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is as truly Poſitive as the other.</p>
            <p>Again. The Order of the Clergy is not only a
<hi>Poſitive</hi> Order inſtituted by God, but the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Degrees in this Order is of the ſame Nature.
For we find in Scripture, that ſome Perſons could
perform ſome Offices in the Prieſthood, which
neither Deacons nor Prieſts could do, tho' thoſe
Deacons and Prieſts were inſpir'd Perſons, and
Workers of Miracles. Thus <hi>Timothy</hi> was ſent to
ordain Elders, becauſe none below his Order,
who was a Biſhop, could perform that Office.
<hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> laid their Hands on baptiz'd Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
becauſe neither Prieſts nor Deacons, tho'
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:1141100300:95"/>
Workers of Miracles, could execute that Part of
the Sacerdotal Office.</p>
            <p>Now can we imagine that the Apoſtles and
Biſhops thus diſtinguiſh'd themſelves for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing?
That there was the ſame Power in <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons</hi>
and <hi>Prieſts</hi> to execute thoſe Offices, tho' they
took them to themſelves? No, my Lord; if
three Degrees in the Miniſtry are inſtituted in
Scripture, we are oblig'd to think them as truly
diſtinct in their Powers, as we are to think that
the Prieſthood it ſelf contains Powers that are
diſtinct from thoſe of the Laity. It is no more
conſiſtent with Scripture, to ſay that <hi>Deacons</hi> or
<hi>Prieſts</hi> may ordain, than that the Laity are Prieſts
or Deacons. The ſame Divine Institution mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as truly a Difference betwixt the Clergy, as
it does betwixt Clergy and Laity.</p>
            <p>Now if the Order of the Clergy be a <hi>Divine
Poſitive</hi> Inſtitution, in which there are different
Degrees of Power, where ſome alone can Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> whilſt others can only perform other
parts of the ſacred Office; if this (as it plainly
appears) be a Doctrine of Scripture, then it is a
Doctrine of Scripture, that there is a Neceſſity of
ſuch a Succeſſion of Men as have Power to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain.
For do the Scriptures make it neceſſary
that <hi>Timothy</hi> (or ſome Biſhop) ſhould be ſent to
<hi>Epheſus</hi> to ordain Prieſts, becauſe the Prieſts who
were there could not ordain? And do not the
ſame Scriptures make it as neceſſary, that <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi>'s
Succeſſor be the only Ordainer, as well as
He was in his Time? Will not Prieſts in the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:1141100300:96"/>
next Age be as deſtitute of the Power of Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as when <hi>Timothy</hi> was alive? So that ſince
the Scriptures teach, that <hi>Timothy,</hi> or Perſons of
his Order, could <hi>alone</hi> ordain in that Age; they
as plainly teach, that the Succeſſors of that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
can <hi>alone</hi> ordain in any Age, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the Scriptures plainly teach a Neceſſity
of an <hi>Epiſcopal Succeſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Scriptures declare there is a Neceſſity of
a Divine Commiſſion to execute the Office of a
Prieſt; they alſo teach, that this Commiſſion
can only be had from particular Perſons: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Scriptures plainly teach, there is a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of a <hi>Succeſſion of ſuch Particular Perſons,</hi> in
order to keep up a truly <hi>Commiſſion'd Clergy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Suppoſe when <hi>Timothy</hi> was ſent to <hi>Epheſus</hi> to
ordain Elders, the Church had told him, We
have choſe Elders already, and laid our Hands
upon them: That if he alone was allowed to
exerciſe this Power, it might ſeem as if he
alone had it; or that Ministers were the better
for being ordain'd by his particular Hands; and
that ſome Perſons might imagine they could have
no Clergy, except they were ordain'd by him,
or ſome of his Order; and that ſeeing Chriſt had
no where made an expreſs Law, that ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
ſhould be neceſſary to the Ordination of the
Clergy; therefore they rejected this Authority
of <hi>Timothy,</hi> leſt they ſhould ſubject themſelves to
<hi>Niceties</hi> and <hi>Trifles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:1141100300:97"/>
Will your Lordſhip ſay, that ſuch a Practice
would have been allow'd of in the <hi>Epheſians?</hi>
Or that Miniſters ſo ordained, would have been
receiv'd as the Miniſters of Chriſt? If not, why
muſt ſuch Practice or ſuch Miniſters be allow'd of
in any after-Ages? Would not the ſame Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
againſt any of <hi>Timothy's Succeſſors,</hi> have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
the ſame Cenſure, as being equally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.
If therefore the Scripture condemns all
Ordination but what is Epiſcopal; the Scriptures
make a <hi>Succeſſion</hi> of <hi>Epiſcopal Ordainers</hi> neceſſary.
So that I hope, my Lord, we ſhall be no more
told that this is a Doctrine not mention'd in
Scripture, or without any Foundation in it.</p>
            <p>The great Objection to this Doctrine is, that
this <hi>Epiſcopal Order of the Clergy,</hi> is only an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical
Practice; and ſeeing <hi>all</hi> Apoſtolical Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
are not binding to us, ſure this need not.</p>
            <p>In anſwer to this, my Lord, I ſhall firſt ſhew,
that tho' all Apoſtolical Practices are not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
yet ſome may be neceſſary. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That
the Divine unalterable Right of Epiſcopacy is
not founded <hi>merely</hi> on Apoſtolical Practice.</p>
            <p>To begin with the <hi>Firſt;</hi> The Objection runs
thus, <hi>All Apoſtolical Practices, are not unalterable or
obligatory to us, therefore no Apoſtolical Practices are.</hi>
This, my Lord, is juſt as Theological, as if I
ſhould ſay all Scripture-Truths are not Articles
of Faith, or Fundamentals of Religion, therefore
no Scripture-Truths are: Is not the Argument
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:1141100300:98"/>
full as juſt and ſolid in one Caſe as the Other?
May there not be that ſame Difference between
ſome Practices of the Apoſtles and others, that
there is betwixt ſome Scripture-Truths and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?
Are all Truths equally important that are
to be found in the Bible? Why muſt all Practices
be of the ſame Moment that were Apoſtolical?
Now if there be any Way, either divine or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,
of knowing an Article of Faith, from the
ſmalleſt Truth or moſt indifferent Matter in
Scripture, they will equally aſſiſt us in diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what Apoſtolical Practices are of perpetual
Obligation, and what are not. But it is a ſtrange
way of Reaſoning, that ſome People are fallen
into, who ſeem to know nothing of <hi>Moderation,</hi>
but jump as conſtantly out of one Extream into
another, as if there was no ſuch Thing as a middle
Way, or any ſuch Virtue as <hi>Moderation.</hi> Thus
either the Church muſt have an <hi>abſolute uncontroul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Authority,</hi> or none at all; we muſt either hold
<hi>all</hi> Apoſtolical Practices neceſſary, or <hi>none at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, if no Apoſtolical <hi>Practices</hi> can be unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable,
becauſe all are not, then no Apoſtolical
<hi>Doctrines</hi> are neceſſary to be taught in all Ages,
becauſe all Apoſtolical <hi>Doctrines</hi> are not; and we
are no more oblig'd to teach the <hi>Death, Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi>
and <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, than we
are oblig'd to forbid the <hi>eating of Blood and Things
ſtrangled.</hi> If we muſt thus blindly follow them
in all their Practices, or elſe be at liberty to leave
them in all, we muſt for the ſame Reaſon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly
teach all their <hi>Doctrines,</hi> or elſe have a
Power of receding from them all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:1141100300:99"/>
For if there be any Thing in the Nature of
<hi>Doctrines,</hi> in the <hi>Tenour</hi> of Scripture, or the <hi>Senſe</hi>
of Antiquity, whereby we can know the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of ſome <hi>Doctrines</hi> from others, that ſome
were <hi>Occaſional Temporary</hi> Determinations, ſuited
to particular States and Conditions in the Church,
whilſt others were ſuch general <hi>Doctrines</hi> as
would concern the Church in all States and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances;
If there can be this difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Apoſtolical <hi>Doctrines,</hi> there muſt neceſſarily
be the ſame difference betwixt Apoſtolical <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,</hi>
unleſs we will ſay, that their <hi>Practices</hi> were
not ſuited to their <hi>Doctrines.</hi> For Occaſional <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines</hi>
muſt produce Occasional <hi>Practices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now may not we be oblig'd by ſome <hi>Practices</hi>
of the Apoſtles, where the Nature of the Thing,
and the Conſent of Antiquity ſhew it to be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
neceſſary and important in all Ages and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Church, without being ty'd down
to the ſtrict obſervance of every Thing which
the Apoſtles did, tho' it plainly appears, that it
was done upon <hi>accidental</hi> and <hi>mutable</hi> Reaſons.
Can we not be oblig'd to obſerve the <hi>Lord's Day</hi>
from Apoſtolical <hi>Practice,</hi> without being equally
oblig'd to <hi>Lock the Doors</hi> where we are met, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
in the Apoſtles Times they lock'd them for
fear of their Enemies.</p>
            <p>My Lord, we are to follow the <hi>Practices</hi> of
the Apoſtles, as we ought to follow every Thing
elſe, with <hi>Diſcretion</hi> and <hi>Judgment,</hi> and not run
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:1141100300:100"/>
headlong into every Thing they did, becauſe
they were Apoſtles, or yet think that becauſe
we need not practiſe after them in every Thing,
we need do it in nothing. We beſt imitate
them, when we act upon ſuch Reaſons as they
acted upon, and neither make their <hi>Occaſional</hi>
Practices <hi>perpetual</hi> Laws, nor break thro' ſuch
General Rules, as will always have the <hi>ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
to be obſerv'd.</p>
            <p>If it be ask'd, how we can know what Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
muſt be obſerv'd, and what may be laid
aſide? I anſwer, as we know <hi>Articles</hi> of Faith
from <hi>leſſer Truths;</hi> as we know <hi>Occaſional</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
from Perpetual Doctrines, that is, from
the <hi>Nature</hi> of the Things, from the <hi>Tenour</hi> of
Scripture, and the <hi>Teſtimony of</hi> Antiquity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is not true, that the <hi>Divine unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable
Right</hi> of Epiſcopacy is founded <hi>merely</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Apoſtolical Practice.</p>
            <p>We do not ſay that Epiſcopacy cannot be
changed, <hi>merely</hi> becauſe we have Apoſtolical
Practice for it; but becauſe ſuch is the Nature of
the Chriſtian Prieſthood, that it can only be
continued in that Method, which God has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for its Continuance. Thus, Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
is the <hi>only</hi> inſtituted Method of continuing
the Prieſthood; therefore Epiſcopacy is <hi>unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi>
not becauſe it is an Apoſtolical Practice,
but becauſe the Nature of the Thing requires
it: A poſitive Institution being only to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:1141100300:101"/>
in that Method which God has appointed;
ſo that it is the Nature of the Prieſthood, and
not the Apoſtolical Practice alone, that makes
it neceſſary to be continued. The Apoſtolical
Practice indeed ſhews, that Epiſcopacy is the
Order that is appointed, but it is the Nature of
the Prieſthood that aſſures us that it is <hi>Unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:</hi>
And- that becauſe an Office which is of no
ſignificancy, but as it is of Divine Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and inſtituted by God, can no otherways
be continued, but in that way of Continuance
which God has appointed.</p>
            <p>The Argument proceeds thus; The Chriſtian
Prieſthood is a Divine poſitive Inſtitution, which
as it could only begin by the <hi>Divine Appointment,</hi>
ſo it can only deſcend to after Ages in ſuch a
Method, as God has been-pleaſed to appoint.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtles (and your Lordſhip owns,
Chriſt was in <hi>all</hi> that they did)<note n="*" place="bottom">Anſwer to Dr. <hi>Snape.</hi>
               </note> inſtituted Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy
<hi>alone,</hi> therefore this Method of Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
is unalterable, not becauſe an <hi>Apoſtolical Practice</hi>
cannot be laid aſide, but becauſe the Prieſthood
can only deſcend to after-Ages in ſuch a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
as is of Divine Appointment.</p>
            <p>So that the Queſtion is not fairly ſtated, when
it is asked, whether Epiſcopacy, being an Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Practice, may be laid aſide? But it ſhould
be asked, whether an inſtituted particular Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of continuing the Prieſthood be not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to be continued? Whether an appointed
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:1141100300:102"/>
Order of receiving a Commiſſion from God be
not neceſſary to be obſerv'd, in order to receive
a Commiſſion from Him? If the Caſe was thus
ſtated, as it ought to be fairly ſtated, any one
would ſoon perceive, that we can no more lay
aſide Epiſcopacy, and yet continue the Chriſtian
Prieſthood, than we can alter the Terms of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and yet be in Covenant with God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I come now, my Lord, to the Second Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,</hi>
That this uninterrupted Succeſſion is ſubject
to ſo great uncertainty, that if it be neceſſary, we can
never ſay that we are in the Church.</p>
            <p>I know no Reaſon, my Lord, why it is ſo
uncertain, but becauſe it is founded upon
<hi>Hiſtorical Evidence.</hi> Let it therefore be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
my Lord, that Chriſtianity it ſelf, is a <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Fact,</hi> only convey'd to us by <hi>Hiſtorical Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the <hi>Canon of Scripture</hi> is only made known
to us by <hi>Hiſtorical Evidence;</hi> that we have no
other way of knowing what Writings are the
word of God; and yet the Truth of our Faith, and
every other Means of Grace depends upon our
Knowledge and Belief of the Scriptures. Muſt
we not declare the Neceſſity of this Succeſſion
of Biſhops, becauſe it can only be prov'd by
<hi>Hiſtorical Evidence,</hi> and that for ſuch a long tract
of Time?</p>
            <p>Why then do we declare the belief of the
Scriptures, neceſſary to Salvation? Is not this
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:1141100300:103"/>
equally putting the Salvation of Men upon a
<hi>Matter of Fact,</hi> ſupported only by <hi>Hiſtorical Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi>
and making it depend upon Things done
ſeventeen hundred Years ago? Cannot <hi>Hiſtorical
Evidence</hi> ſatisfie us in one Point, as well as in
the other? Is there any Thing in the Nature of
this Succeſſion, that it can't be as well aſſerted
by <hi>Hiſtorical Evidence,</hi> as the Truth of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?
Is there not the ſame bare poſſibility in the
Thing it ſelf, that the Scriptures may in ſome
important Points be corrupted, as that this Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
may be broke? But is this any juſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why we ſhould believe, or fear, that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
are corrupted, becauſe there is a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical
Poſſibility of it, tho' there is all the Proof
that can be requir'd of the contrary? Why then
muſt we ſet aſide the Neceſſity of this Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from a <hi>bare poſſibility of</hi> Error, tho' there is all
the Proof that can be requir'd, that it never was
broken, but ſtrictly kept up?</p>
            <p>And tho' your Lordſhip has told the World
ſo much of the <hi>Improbability, Nonſenſe,</hi> and <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity</hi>
of this Succeſſion, yet I prormiſe your

fit to ſhew, <hi>when;</hi> or <hi>how,</hi> or <hi>where</hi> this Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
broke, or <hi>ſeem'd</hi> to break, or was <hi>likely</hi>
to break.</p>
            <p>And till then, I ſhall content my ſelf with
offering this Reaſon to your Lordſhip, why it is
<hi>morally impoſſible,</hi> it ever ſhould have broken in
all that Term of Years, from the Apoſtles to the
preſent Times.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:1141100300:104"/>
The Reaſon is this; it has been a receiv'd Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
in every Age of the Church, that no Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
was valid but that of Biſhops: This Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
my Lord, has been a conſtant Guard
upon the <hi>Epiſcopal Succeſſion;</hi> for ſeeing it was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally
believ'd that Biſhops <hi>alone</hi> could Ordain,
it was <hi>morally impoſſible,</hi> that any Perſons could
be receiv'd as Biſhops, who had not been ſo
Ordain'd.</p>
            <p>Now is it not <hi>morally impoſſible,</hi> that in our
Church any one ſhould be made a Biſhop with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>Epiſcopal Ordination?</hi> Is there any poſſibility
of forging Orders, or ſatealing a Biſhoprick by
any other Stratagem? No, it is <hi>morally impoſſible,</hi>
becauſe it is an acknowledg'd Doctrine amongſt
us, that a Biſhop can only be ordain'd by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops?
Now as this Doctrine muſt neceſſarily
prevent any one being a Biſhop without <hi>Epiſcopal
Ordination</hi> in our Age, ſo it muſt have the ſame
effect in every other Age as well as ours; and
conſequently it is as reaſonable to believe that
the Succeſſion of Biſhiops was not broke in any
Age ſince the Apoſtles, as that it was not broke
in our own Kingdom within theſe forty Years.
For the ſame Doctrine which preſerves it forty
Years, may as well preſerve it forty hundred
Years, if it was equally believ'd in all that
ſpace of Time. That this has been the conſtant
Doctrine of the Church, I preſume your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
will not deny; I have not here enter'd into
the Hiſtorical Defence of it, this, and indeed
every other Inſtitution of the Chriſtian Church

it; and yet can your Lordſhip aſſure us that it
is not only poſſible to be, but <hi>actually</hi> is in being
in the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> What Arguments, or
Authority can your Lordſhip produce to ſhew
that there is a Succeſſion there, that will not
equally prove it to be here?</p>
            <p>You aſſert expreſly, that there is a <hi>true Succeſſion</hi>
there; you deny that we have it here; therefore
your Lordſhip muſt mean, that we had not Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
Ordination when we ſeparated from the
Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And here the Controverſie
muſt reſt betwixt you and your Adverſaries, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we had Epiſcopal Ordination then;</hi> for as your
Lordſhip has expreſly affirm'd, that there is this
uninterrupted Succeſſion in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
it is impoſſible that we ſhould want it, unleſs
we had not Epiſcopal Ordination at the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whenever you? Lordſhip ſhall pleaſe to appear
in Defence of the <hi>Nagg's-head Story,</hi> or any other
Pretence againſt our Epiſcopal Ordination
when we departed for <hi>Rome,</hi> we ſhall beg leave
to ſhew our ſelves ſo far true Proteſtants. as to
anſwer any <hi>Popiſh</hi> Arguments your Lordſhip can
produce.</p>
            <p>Here let the <hi>Common Senſe</hi> of the Laity be once
more appeal'd to: Your Lordſhip tells them that
an <hi>uninterrupted Succeſſion</hi> is improbable, abſurd, and,
<hi>morally</hi> ſpeaking, <hi>impoſſible,</hi> and, for this Reaſon,
they need not trouble their Heads about it; yet
in another Place you poſitively affirm, that this
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:1141100300:107"/>
true <hi>uninterrupted Succeſſion</hi> is actually in the Church
of <hi>Rome:</hi> That is, they are to deſpiſe this
Succeſſion, becauſe it never was, or ever can be,
yet are co believe that it <hi>really</hi> is in the <hi>Romiſh</hi>
Church. My Lord, this comes very near <hi>ſaying</hi>
and <hi>unſaying, to the great Diverſion of the Papiſts.</hi>
Muſt they not not laugh at your Lordſhip's <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Zeal,</hi> which might be much better call'd
the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Popery? Muſt they not be highly
pleas'd with all your Banter and Ridicule upon
an <hi>uninterrup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed Succeſſion,</hi> when they ſee you ſo
kindly except theirs? And think it only <hi>Nonſenſe</hi>
and <hi>Abſurdity,</hi> when claim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d by any other Church?
Surely, my Lord, they muſt conceive great
Hopes of your Lordſhip, ſince you have here ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               </gap>ſe to contradict your ſelf, than not vouch
for their Succeſſion: For you have ſaid it is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
impoſſible, yet affirm that it is with them.</p>
            <p>The third Objection againſt this <hi>uninterrupted
Succeſſion,</hi> is this, that it is a <hi>Popiſh Doctrine,</hi> and
<hi>gives Papiſts advantage over us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Objection proceeds thus, we muſt not
aſſert the Neceſſity of this Succeſſion, becauſe
the Papiſts ſay it is only to be found with them.
I might add, becauſe ſome mighty zealous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
ſay ſo too.</p>
            <p>But if this be good Argumentation, we ought
not co tell the <hi>Jews,</hi> or <hi>Deiſts,</hi> &amp;c. that there is any
Neceſſity of embracing Chriſtianity, becauſe the
<hi>Papiſts</hi> ſay Chriſtians can only be ſaved in their
Church.</p>

Sacraments, no Kind of Inſtitutions, or any
Church, <hi>as ſuch</hi> can help us to the leaſt Degree of
God's Favour, or give us the ſmalleſt Advantage
above any other Communion. And conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that your Lordſhip has ſet ſincere <hi>Jews, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
Socinians, Muggletonians,</hi> and all <hi>Hereticks</hi> and
<hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> upon the ſame Bottom, as to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of God, with ſincere Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>Upon this, my Lord, I am called upon to
prove that theſe ſeveral Sorts of People can be
<hi>Sincere</hi> in your account of Sincerity. To which,
my Lord, I make this Anſwer, either there are
ſome ſincere Perſons amongſt <hi>Jews, Quakers,
Socinians,</hi> or any kind of <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi>
or there are not; if there are, your Lordſhip has
given them the ſame title to God's Favour, that
you have to the ſincereſt Chriſtians, if you will ſay,
there are no ſincere Perſons amongſt any of them,
then your Lordſhip Damns them all in the Groſs,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:1141100300:109"/>
for ſurely Corruptions in Religion, profeſs'd
with unſincerity, will never ſave People.</p>
            <p>I have nothing to do to prove the Sincerity
of any of them, if they are Sincere, what I
have ſaid is true, if you will not allow them to
be Sincere, you condemn them all at once.</p>
            <p>Again, I humbly ſuppos'd a Man might be
ſincere in his <hi>Religious Opinions,</hi> tho' it might be
owing to <hi>ſome ill Habits,</hi> or <hi>ſomething Criminal</hi> in
Himſelf, that he was fallen into ſuch or ſuch
a way of Thinking. Bus it ſeems this is all <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction;</hi>
and no Man can be ſincere, who has
<hi>any Faults,</hi> or whoſe <hi>Faults</hi> have any <hi>Influence</hi> upon
his way of Thinking.</p>
            <p>Your Lordſhip tells all the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> that
they may be eaſie, if they are ſincere; and that it
is the only Ground for Peace and Satisfaction.
But pray, my Lord, if none are to be eſteemed
<hi>ſincere,</hi> but thoſe who have no Faults, or whoſe
Faults have no Influence upon their Perſwaſions,
who can be aſſur'd that he is <hi>ſincere,</hi> but he that
has the leaſt Pretence to it, the <hi>Proud Phariſee?</hi>
If your Lordſhip or your Advocates were deſir'd
to prove your Sincerity, either before God or
Man, it muſt be for theſe Reaſons, becauſe you
have no ill Paſſions or Habits, no faulty Prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
no paſt or preſent Vices that can have any
Effect upon your Minds. My Lord, as this is
the only Proof that any of you could give of
your own Sincerity in this Meaning of it, ſo the
very Pretence to it would prove the Wane of it.</p>
