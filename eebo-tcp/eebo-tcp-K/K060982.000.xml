            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN
ESSAY,
At Removing National Prejudices, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>HAving wrote two Eſſays in <hi>England</hi> upon the Subject
of the Union, and particularly to remove National
and Party Prejudices againſt the Treaty then on foot. I
calculated thoſe Eſſays principally for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> part,
where I always expected the difficulty would lye, and
where I met with certain radicated tho ill grounded Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices
againſt the <hi>Scots as a Nation,</hi> as well as againſt the
Union which I thought a general Happineſs.</p>
            <p>But I confeſs my ſelf ſurpriz'd, when coming to <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi>
on ſome private Affairs of my own, I found my two
Eſſays Re-printed here, and forwardly handed about as
Arguments againſt that very Subject they were written to
Promote, I mean the Union; and that only upon this
weak Suppoſition, that becauſe I had only inſiſted upon the
Advantages to <hi>England,</hi> in Union; that therefore I did
not pretend <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould any way be better'd by it.</p>
            <p>To this my Anſwer is very ſhort; that I had always too
great a reſpect for the <hi>Scots,</hi> to write a Satyr upon the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
And that thinking it impoſſible any <hi>Scotſman</hi> could be
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0567401700:3"/>
to ſeek in the real, numerous, and ſo viſible Advantages,
<hi>Scotland</hi> ſhall reap by the Treaty; I thought it would ſeem
to reflect too much upon the Gentlemen concern'd, to
preſume to tell them, what it was much better manners
for me to preſume they all knew already; and what by the
nature of the Thing became ſo viſible, that to me it ſeem'd,
none but the willfully Blind, <hi>whom I do not pretend to Cure,</hi>
could be at a loſs about.</p>
            <p>But ſince it is my misfortune to be thus miſtaken, and
that ſome People charge me with that Ignorance which
my reſpect for their Underſtanding, would not permitt me
to charge them with. I find my ſelf oblig'd <hi>contrary to my
fixt reſolution of not medling on either ſide,</hi> to make this
ſhort Eſſay on the reſpective Advantages of <hi>Scotland</hi> in the
depending Treaty of Union; and this I ſhall do as conciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as I can, and carefully avoiding needleſs Digreſſions,
come immediately to the Matter in hand.</p>
            <p>Only before I begin the attempt, give me leave in duty
to the Government, and in defference to her Majeſty, to
note that the expreſſions of Advantages accruing to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
by the Union, are ſo plain in her Majeſty's Royal
Letter, and ſo aſſerted in the reſpective Speeches of his
Grace the Lord Commiſſioner, and the Lord Chancellor,
at the opening the preſent Seſſion of Parliament, that one
would think no Man could read that Letter, and thoſe
Speeches, and ask afterwards what the Advantages to
<hi>Scotland</hi> ſhall be by the Union.</p>
            <p>When her Majeſty tells her Subjects of <hi>Scotland,</hi> She <q rend="margQuotes">is
fully perſuaded it will prove the greateſt Happineſs of her
People; that it will be the ſolid Foundation of laſting
Peace; it will ſecure your Religion, Liberty and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
remove the Animoſities amongſt your ſelves, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0567401700:4"/>
the Jealouſies and Differences betwixt Our two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms:
It muſt increaſe your Strength, Riches and
Trade; and by this Union the whole Iſland being joyn'd
in Affection, and free from all apprehenſion of different
Intereſts, will be enabled to reſiſt all its Enemies, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
the Proteſtant Intereſt every where, and maintain
the Liberties of <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="margQuotes">That to bring this Union to paſs, is the only effectual
way to ſecure your preſent and future Happineſs, and
diſappoint the Deſigns of your and her Majeſty's Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</q>
            </p>
            <p>When his Grace her Majeſtie's high Commiſſioner has
inculcated theſe things and reminds you, <q rend="margQuotes">That the
Queen eſteems it as the greateſt Glory of her Reign;
(not her glorious Succeſſes abroad excepted) to have
this mighty Affair concluded.</q>
            </p>
            <p>When my Lord Chancellor tells you, <q rend="margQuotes">You have
now the opportunity of eſtabliſhing for your ſelves and
Poſterity, by this Union, all that concerns your Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Liberties, and the moſt valuable Privileges of
Trade.</q>
            </p>
            <p>After all this has been ſaid, is it not hard Gentlemen
you ſhould ask a poor Stranger here, what <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhall
get by this Union; and why I did not go upon that in my
former Eſſays?</p>
            <p>Really, Gentlemen, when I wrote thoſe Eſſays, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
them of uſe to <hi>Scotland,</hi> to convince ſome unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
<hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> that your great Advantages ſhould be
no injury to them. It was a loud and continued Cry there,
<hi>Ay, ay, we know the</hi> Scots <hi>will gain by this Union;</hi> but what
SHALL WE, <hi>we in England,</hi> be the better for it: And I
was challeng'd often to make out, what the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould
Gain by it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0567401700:5"/>
Upon this I undertook that Subject, and really there
lies ſome unhappineſs in the alternative of this Matter,
and an impartial Writer, <hi>as I hope I may pretend to be,</hi> has
a great difficulty before him in urging the Advantages of
either Nation; ſince the Arguments to prove the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
of one, ſeem to argue the Diſadvantages of the other.</p>
            <p>My remedy for this is, what I have undertaken in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place, <hi>viz.</hi> To convince both Parties, that their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
are mutual, reciprocal and ſo equal, that 'tis
hard to determine which ſide ſhall be the greater Gainer.</p>
            <p>And this happy conjunction of good Events, I muſt
confeſs, comes to paſs from a thing many People have not
without plenty of Ignorance oppoſed; I mean, the Union's
being CENTERAL: And as to all the eſſential parts of
Conſtitution Univerſal; ſo that we are at liberty to give
that Word its full extent, UNION: And here I think it
can not be improper to explain how extenſive I think <hi>the
word Union</hi> to be in this Caſe; and how <hi>even by the Treaty,</hi>
it ought to be underſtood. It is a word comprehenſive of
every thing Good to both; excluſive of all manner of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
or Diſparity of Parts, abhorring all things Injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
or Diminiſhing to either; a full Coallition, a general
Incorporation of Nations, of Intereſts, of Power, and of
Safety:—A Sameneſs of Circumſtances and of Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies;
becoming one and the ſame Body, with one and the
ſame Head, Life, Soul, Nutriment, Point and Period.</p>
            <p>Some Gentlemen who talk much of this Union, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
known the Heads of it, yet pretend not to underſtand
it, would do very well to turn to their Books, and putting
together all the Etymologies, receiv'd Significations, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary
Acceptations, and common readings of the words
<hi>Union</hi> and <hi>Incorporation,</hi> tell us what they underſtand by
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0567401700:6"/>
them, and how the true meaning of the Words, and the
new ſuggeſtions of ſeparate Exiſtence in the Government
can Conſiſt.</p>
            <p>But if this be too nice, and the Thought too much ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limated
for them, let me recommend to them a courſe Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
            <p>I
liken this Union to a Body receiving Food, as Fleſh,
Fiſh, Fruit, Liquids, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which, being incorporated and
digeſted, concoct together, Unite their very Subſtance
and diſſolve themſelves into one and the ſame Nutriment,
to the health, life, vigour and growth of the whole Body,
proportionedly and univerſally.</p>
            <p>If wrong Digeſtion, diſtemper of the Body, or defect of the
Food, produces corruption, contagion or improper fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
the moſt remote Member, and the neareſt or more
immediate, equally feel their proportion'd want of Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment,
decay of Strength, diſtemper and diſorder; the
deficiency cannot be felt in the Head, and not in the
Foot, but weakneſs ſucceeds to all the Parts.</p>
            <p>If our Union be Partial, Federal, Periodical or indeed
Notional, as moſt of thoſe ſchemes have been; then the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
may be ſo alſo: One part may thrive, and another
decay; And <hi>Scotland</hi> would be but too ſenſible of that, in
thoſe ſorts of Union.</p>
            <p>But if the Union be an Incorporation, a Union accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the extent of the Letter, it muſt then be a Union
of the very SOUL OF THE NATION, all its
Conſtitution, Cuſtoms, Trade and Manners, muſt be
blended together, digeſted and concocted, for the mutual
united, undiſtinguiſh't, good, growth and health of the one
whole united Body; and this I underſtand by Union
And no wonder, they who conſider the Nations in a leſs
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0567401700:7"/>
or more contracted Capacity of Union, are at a loſs, to
find the Advantages of it.</p>
            <p>Now, Gentlemen, as thus United, would you know your
Advantages? They conſiſt of four ſorts.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Trade,</item>
               <item>2. Religion,</item>
               <item>3. Civil Government,</item>
               <item>4. Liberty and Soveraignty.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. In Trade, the united Riches, Stocks, Settlements,
Factories, and Dependencies of <hi>England,</hi> are concern'd
to promote yours; not as their Siſter-<hi>Scotland,</hi> but as their
own Riches, Stocks in Trade, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Not in a ſeparate but
an immediate Capacity, their Ports are yours, and you are
immediately Naturalized to, and Legitimated in their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome-Houſes,
Ports and Commerce; Your Manfuactures
are Carried to them, and what you want Imported from
them without Taxes, Tolls Diſtinction or Interruption.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Indies</hi> lyes at your Door, and you want Stock
to Graſp that Sea of wealth the Fiſhery, your Fiſh and
their Stocks will Unite to fall into that uſeful affair, by
which <hi>your People</hi> will be Employed, <hi>your Seamen</hi> kept at
home, <hi>your Proviſion</hi> conſumed, <hi>your Lands</hi> Improved,
<hi>your Nation</hi> Enriched, they ſhareing with you in every one
of theſe, and you with them in every other Advantage.</p>
            <p>'Twill be endleſs to Eſſay on the Freedom of your Linen
Manufacture into <hi>England,</hi> and it's prodigous Increaſs by the
taking off the Exorbitant Duty now laid upon it; the
Freedom of an Immediate Trade to all Our Colonies, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
<hi>Even to the Engliſh Subjects Inhabiting Ireland,</hi> The
fluſh Stocks of <hi>Engliſh Men</hi> falling into Trade with you, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0567401700:8"/>
the Currency and Flux of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bullion and Coin into all
parts of your Kingdom.</p>
            <p>'Twould be worth your conſidering the advantages of
Introduceing <hi>Engliſh Improvements</hi> on your Eſtates, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Farmers and Stocks on your Lands; the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation
of your Corn and Coals to <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mercats, And
whether it will not be your own fault, if theſe things do
not in a few Years, double the Fee ſimple, and raiſe the
Value of your Eſtates <hi>Two for One.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are a few of the Advantages in Trade, which
would bear a higher enlargement, if it needed that I ſhould
firſt prove, this would keep your People at home; and
then Examine the infinite Alterations and Conſequences,
both to Land-Trade and ready Mony, which doubling
or trebbling the number of your People would produce.</p>
            <p>'Tis a Slander upon your Country, to ſay, '<hi>tis a Barren
Land.</hi> Nature was commanded not to let Man have his
Bread out of her, but by the Sweat of his Brows; and
with that Sweat ſhe never denys him.</p>
            <p>'Tis want of Trade to whet Induſtry, Profit to whet
Trade, Vent of Goods and Stock to produce Profit;
Theſe are the Barrenneſſes your Country Complains of, and
Declines for want of.</p>
            <p>Your Lands Encloſed, Manured and Cultivated, would
be <hi>as Rich,</hi> your Cattel <hi>as Large,</hi> your Sheep <hi>as Fat,</hi> and
your Wool <hi>as Fine</hi> as in <hi>England,</hi> your Barren Muirs would
yield Corn, the Hills Feed Flocks of Sheep, and your bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Lands which you now wholly Imploy with the
Plough, would Feed Strong, and Valuable Cattel, from
hence would proceed <hi>Darys,</hi> Milk, Butter, Cheeſe, &amp;c.
which being plentiful, and Cheap would feed your Poor
in a better manner, and deliver them from the Miſery and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0567401700:9"/>
Hardſhip which now makes your People fly from their
Native Country, and makes you the Nurſes of <hi>Europe,</hi>
that you have the trouble and expenſe of your Children till
they are grown up; and then other Nations reap the
Profit of their Labour.</p>
            <p>But I can but touch theſe things here, perhaps I may
more largely Diſcourſe of both the evil and its remedy on
another occaſion: But to bring it to the preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
the immediate Remedy for them is an UNION,
and as it is the only Remedy, ſo it muſt be a Remedy, you
muſt partake of the general Improvement, both in Land,
Living and Trade; and I need ſay no more.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Powers muſt be your Defence, the whole
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Wealth muſt be Engaged to you; the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Navys muſt be your Convo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, and in all parts of the
World, your Ships have the Immediate Protection of their
Fleet, Ports, Forts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Forces: And this by the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Conſequences of the UNION, not as you are their
Friends, Neighbours and Confederates: But as you are
themſelves, their own, it is become a Debt to you, their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
muſt Pay it, or be Traytors to their Soveraign, and
to their Native Country, which is yours and theirs Indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely,

            <p>I know ſome Gentlemen will allow all this much rather than
be convinced of equal Advantages in another, yet more valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Caſe, viz. Religion which is the Second head of Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>And here I muſt own, I am aſtoniſht that any one can
help ſeeing the Safety, Settlement and Perpetuity of the
Eſtabliſht Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> entirely wrapt up in the UNI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ON;
and indeed only to be ſecured by it.</p>

               </gap>therto you have been jealous of <hi>England,</hi> putting upon

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0567401700:10"/>
without cauſe, and in caſe of Ruptures, War, diferent So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns,
and a Thouſand Caſualties and uncertainties, to
which the Church as now Eſtabliſhed is ſubject, both from
<hi>England</hi> without, as diſtinctly and diſunitedly conſider'd,
<hi>Which after the Queen no Body can anſwer for;</hi> and from a
numerous and doubly Diſaffected Party at Home: Who, I
ſay, in caſe of thoſe things, ſhall Anſwer, for what may or

no Man, that has a true Zeal for it can ſay, he is eaſy in
the preſent condition of the Church, abſtracted from this
Union.</p>
            <p>Upon an Union, all theſe Fears vaniſh, 'Tis for ever
rendered impoſſible to Overthrow the Settlement of the
Presbyterian Church of <hi>Scotland;</hi> But by Subverting the
conſtitution, by abſolute Arbitrary Government, and the
openeſt Bare-Fac'd Tyranny. The Church, and the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
the Spiritual and Temporal Liberty, have the
ſame Sanction, Subſiſt and Depend upon the ſame Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
are Defended by the ſame Power, Demanded by the
ſame Right, Twiſted and Connected together, cannot
fall, but by the ſame Diſaſter, Nor ſtand, but by the
Support of one another.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, Tyrannies may happen; and ſo they may, and
are much more likly to do under your preſent Unſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled

with this addition, that then all <hi>Brittain</hi> will be concern'd
for your Liberty and you will demand it, as your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
indiſputable Right: Which Right the other can
never conſent to Abrogate or make Null, without making

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0567401700:11"/>
ſhould one day come to ſuffer, by the ſame experiment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed, this is the only way, to reconcile that ſtrange
abſurdity, of which I have taken notice elſe where, now grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up in both Nations, viz. <hi>The Danger of the Church,</hi>
that <hi>England</hi> ſhould ſay, her Church will be in Danger;
and <hi>Scotland</hi> ſay, her Church will be in Danger: If both
theſe can be true, I confeſs, it has ſomething very odd in
it. But, what is yet more abſurd, is, that this ſhould be
from a Union. Bleſs us! Union work this! How can
this be? 'Tis the nature of Union, to preſerve, not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy;
to ſecure, not endanger; to confirm, not Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.
<hi>No, Gentlemen,</hi> if either of your Churches are in
Danger, it will be for want of the Union; So, and no
other way, the abſurdity may be reconciled, and both
Churches be in Danger.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In Union,</hi> Love, Peace, Charity and Mutual Aſſiſtance,
are natural conſequences; And can thoſe pull down any
Church? When-ever either party attempts upon the other,
the Union is Broke; 'Tis no more the thing, and can no
longer bear the Name. When the Union is Broke, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
is Overthrown; For, one link of this Chain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Broken, the whole Chain is rendred uſeleſs; the Force
of the one depending, upon the continuity of the reſt. The
fundamental is diſtroy'd, the Government diſſolves, and
the whole Iſland becomes a Mob, one Univerſal Rabble.
Juſt as in the caſe of a Tyrant, diſpenſing with the Laws
and Setting up Arbitrary Power, Property ceaſes, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
Diſſolves, Conſtitution ſuffocates, and the National
Capacity dyes.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, Human Wiſdom can make nothing Indiſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vible.
This Union may be broke, ſo may <hi>Magna Carta;</hi> So
may the Conſtitution. But Gentlemen, you have the ſame
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0567401700:12"/>
Security for your Church Settlement, that you have for
your Lives, Liberties and Eſtates, and the ſame on one
ſide, that you have on another.</p>
            <p>But ſays one, fill'd with jealouſies of remote poſſibilities,
even The Legislature may be byaſt, and a Parliament may
come that ſhall Reſcind the Settlement of the Church of
Scotland &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Put this into Engliſh, <hi>A Parliament may come, that may
Diſſolve the Conſtitution, that may Reſcind the Union, that may
Sacrifice the whole Kingdom;</hi> it is abſurd in it's nature, the
Union in it's being is the very Conſtitution, the Life and
Soul of Great <hi>Brittain</hi> as to Government: And to ſay, a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may come that can break the Conſtitution, is to ſay, a
Parliament may be mad, poſſeſt, and <hi>Felo de ſe;</hi> as a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
they can not do ſo, they ceaſe from that moment to
be a Parliament, and become a Houſe of Tyrants and a Den
of Robbers, nay, and of the worſt ſort of Robbers, Strip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
thoſe they come to Protect.</p>
            <p>If they would do this therefore, they can not, without
Diſſolving their own Being, Annihilating their own
Body, and committing all Imaginable Abſurdities.</p>
            <p>They may Diſſolve themſelves, but Original natural
Right muſt remain: if they diſſolve the Form <hi>whether ſhall
it return?</hi>—To its primitive State it cannot, becauſe
that is diſſolv'd; to Confuſion it muſt not, becauſe Right
muſt be preſerved: Whenever therefore a Parliament de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys
the Conſtitution, by which a Nation is Form'd, that
Parliament ceaſes, and Power reverts to its original Source
to Form a new One.</p>
            <p>Thus the Nature of the thing is its own Security, and
there needs no addition of other Force; if there does, the
Mouths of thoſe Gentlemen muſt be ſtopt, in his Grace the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0567401700:13"/>
high Commiſſioner's Speech, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q rend="margQuotes">That his Grace is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered
to Conſent to what may be farther Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</q>
            </p>
            <p>What can be made more Firm? Are there any liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the Law, qualified to bind the Church and the
Conſtitution together, ſo as that One cannot be hurt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Other; <hi>they are offered you,</hi> take them and tie it as
faſt as Laws or Oaths can bind, or the <hi>Sacra Imperii</hi> of any
Nation be made</p>
            <p>After this what ſhall we ſay, is there any thing in the
Scruples of ſome in either of the Eſtabliſht Churches, which
goes beyond the real Security of the Church?</p>
            <p>I wiſh thoſe Gentlemen would examine, whether it be
any more than a Scruple? And whether all the Obligation
they think themſelves under, is not limited by Poſſibilities?
Whether it can be underſtood they ſhould be bound to do,
that which they cannot really wiſh, <hi>the Publick Good and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Circumſtances conſidered,</hi> were in their power to do?</p>
            <p>Let ſuch Gentlemen conſider how far their Sincerity as
well as Judgment will be called in queſtion in this Caſe.</p>
            <p>Whether really ſecuring the Church, which they embrace
as truly and only Orthodox, be not the moſt effectual ſtep
they can take to pull down all falſe Churches, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
a full Diſcharge of the ſacred Obligation they think
themſelves under.</p>
            <p>'Tis certain, as things are, the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> is far
from Safe; and I ſhould be excuſable if I ſhould ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Miracle or a Union, can make her ſo: He then
that effectually Eſtabliſhes the true Church of Chriſt in the
World, effectually ſuppreſſes and pulls down all other
Churches in the language of his Capacity; as he aſſiſts to
place that Church in a poſture of Victory over all her Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0567401700:14"/>
by a liberty of uſing all her ſpiritual Weapons, <hi>viz.</hi>
The ſuperiour Doctrine and ſanctity of her Miniſtry; and
I wiſh, there were no other Contention between the two
Churches.</p>
            <p>If the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> is now in a precarious, unſafe,
and unſettled Condition, and may be Secured by the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
then the Members of this Church, can no more ask
me what they Gain by the Union, nor anſwer it to their
Conſciences, or their Poſterity, that they ſhould op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
her Settlement in this the day of her Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>But,
ſay the Gentlemen, that in behalf of the Church ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
againſt the Union as now propoſed; <hi>We in</hi> Scotland
<hi>are not ſafe by the Union,</hi> for we are deprived of our Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and <hi>delivered over</hi> to the Parliament of <hi>England;</hi> and
<hi>we do not know,</hi> but ſuch a Time may come, when the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
of <hi>England whoſe Conſtitution is wholly Epiſcopal,</hi> may
Vote our Church down, and Erect the Epiſcopal Church of
<hi>England,</hi> as the Eſtabliſhment of great <hi>Britain;</hi> putting us
off in <hi>Scotland</hi> with a Toleration, which alſo they may
by an occaſional Bill, Reduce again to any thing they
pleaſe.</p>
            <p>This I take to be the ſumm and ſtate of the Queſtion;
For really, what the other Party objects, in my opinion, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
with it no weight.</p>
            <p>To argue what an <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament may do,
and what they may not do, ſeems to me to be ſo conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
that it leaves no room to call it an Argument. And
let Opinion go which way it will, or Probability byaſs
which way it will; this will follow, 'tis as poſſible, and I
muſt ask pardon for thinking, that 'tis more probable, a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0567401700:15"/>
               <hi>Scots</hi> Parliament may be obtain'd, to ruine Presbytery,
than an <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I ſhall turn the very ſame Arguments, which are
uſed againſt this Matter, upon the Gentlemen <hi>that uſe them,</hi>
thus;</p>
            <p>The ſtrong Reaſons given, why an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament
may do this, are ſuch as theſe,</p>
            <p>The great Intereſt of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
in the Parliament; Her having prevail'd to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
the Teſt-Act impoſe it on the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Diſſenters, and
attempt it on the Colonies; Her power to influence Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
in both Kingdoms; the nearneſs to carrying the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional
Bill; Her ſtrong ſtruggles for it the eaſineſs to
Bribe or take off the 45 Members <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reaſons why there is no danger from a <hi>Scots</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
are ſuch as theſe,</p>
            <p>That the Act making it Treaſon to impugn any Article
of the Claim of Right, makes it dangerous to attempt it in
the Parliament of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Nobility and Gentry of <hi>Scotland</hi> are too ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of the Calamities formerly brought upon the Nation,
have ſuffered too much by them to offer at Embroiling the
Nation again upon that account.</p>
            <p>That the example of the Parliament choſen after King
<hi>William</hi>'s death is an Argument for this, in which an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
ſays, there were more High-Church-men Elected than
in any Parliament ſince the Reſtoration—who were ſo
far from reſtoring Epiſcopacy, that they would not allow
the Epiſcopal Clergy the Toleration they Petitioned for.</p>
            <p>This as the ſumm of the projected Diſparity is what
is now offered upon this Head, which in ſhort I abridge
thus '<hi>tis a Compariſon of Probabilities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0567401700:16"/>
That 'tis probable from both Circumſtances, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament may Undo the Church
Settlement of <hi>Scotland;</hi> but 'tis not probable, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Scotland</hi> can do it.</p>
            <p>This I deſire to ſpeak briefly to; and if I ſhould chance
to turn the ſcale of Probabilities againſt them, then I leave
it to it's Conſequences; whether the World will not give it,
againſt theſe Gentlemen, who, with their Imperfect Union,
are for leaving us, juſt where they found us, or worſe.</p>
            <p>That the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> is compoſed of Church
Men, is true; and that the Parſons, tho not near 10000
<hi>as is ſaid,</hi> Vote, and the Church may Influence Elections ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much is all true; and yet under all this, and under ſuch
Reigns, as in which the Diſſenters in <hi>England</hi> have been moſt
hated, they could never obtain any Effectual Law to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
them And at laſt the Poweer of Truth, and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and Nature of things ſo prevailed, that the Diſſenters
are not only Secur'd, but the whole Nation is come over to
them, in the Doctrines of Government, Right and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
            <p>The
Diſſenters are not gone back an Inch, but the
Church aſham'd of their Perſecutions and Oppreſſions, <hi>which
like Excentrick motions always revolve of Courſe to regularities,
and more Natural Rules,</hi> return'd again by length of time to
her ſelf, and own'd her Error, Declar'd Perſecution againſt
her Principles; and freely fall in with Tolleration and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
            <p>They
ſee the Diſſenters and the Church have but one
Civil Intereſt, and that Liberty is the Safety of both,
they're Convinc'd not Conquerd, reduc't not by Power or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but by the nature of things, they come to their Senſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0567401700:17"/>
After this, upon another Sally under a <hi>High-Church-Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,</hi>
the Teſt was foiſted upon the Diſſenters in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and
ſome extravagancies Acted in <hi>England;</hi> but mark, how
ſoon did theſe Attempts in the Authors blow up the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,
and meer Nature bring all things to Rights again?</p>
            <p>To inſtance, in the Attempt on the Colonies, which is the
ſtory of <hi>Carolina,</hi> me thinks is very odd, ſince to read the
misfortune of my Lord <hi>Gr—lle</hi> on that Head, with what
contempt he has been treated, and how mortified for offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
ſuch a thing, but on a poor handful of Planters, me
thinks, I ſay, it ſhould ſtrangely weaken the Arguments of
thoſe, who ſeem to ſuggeſt theſe things.</p>
            <p>Theſe People ſeem to me a little Infatuated, and to Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
againſt themſelves, for, in order to Prove that ſuch a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
thing as attempting the Supreſſion of Presbytry may
come to paſs, they bring upon the Stage all the Inſtances
of theſe attempts, in which the People attempting, have
miſcarried; and can tell but one in which they Succeeded,
viz. the putting the Teſt upon <hi>Ireland, which by the way,</hi>
had never paſt neither, had not the Diſſenters in meer ſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
for the Publick Good, reſted under the hardſhip, rather
than venture to loſe the Bill againſt the growth of Popery;
a thing theſe Gentlemen, I ſuppoſe, knew nothing of, and
a Generoſity the other Party are but very little acquainted
with.</p>
            <p>'Tis hard now Gentlemen, that becauſe the High-flying-Church-Men
have always attempted the Diſſenters in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and miſcarried, to argue from thence that therefore
they ſhall inſult the <hi>Scots</hi> Settlement and ſucceed. I think
it had been a much ſtronger way of Arguing, to ſay, that
being unable with their united ſtrength, ever to gain upon
the Diſſenters in <hi>England,</hi> who, by their own Calculation,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0567401700:18"/>
are not above one to twelve, they ſhall certainly be the
leſs able to prevail when in conjunction with the <hi>Scots</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
and Members.</p>
            <p>As to the occaſional Bill and the nearneſs of its being
paſs'd; 'tis plain it was a ſurprize, the ſnare was not ſeen at
firſt, but with what indignation the reſerves and ſecret
deſigns againſt the Diſſenters were treated when diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
I leave to the Reader to find in the Journals of both
Houſes.</p>
            <p>From hence we come to the Probabilities on the other
hand, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is no danger of the <hi>Scots</hi> Parliament
being ſeduced; the ſame Author grants the new 45 and
16 may be bought by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court, but the whole
Parliament cannot be ſo;—and yet I believe moſt
People will join in this, that let the Court at any
time be ſure to buy 45 and 16 in either Parliament they
ſhall generally ſpeaking, carry any thing they deſire; ſo
that this is abſurd, and by no means a juſt way of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Another contradiction takes off very much of the Credit
of this kind of Arguing, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Act making it Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to impugn any Article of the Claim of Right, makes
it dangerous to attempt this in the Parliament of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot but be ſurpriz'd to find any Man can ſay this
is not an Argument juſt the other way, that it is not as
lawful a Security to the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> in the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Parliament, or in the Parliament of <hi>Britain,</hi> as in that of
<hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is not this Act to remain in Force after the Union, and
may it not be made a part of the Treaty, and can the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0567401700:19"/>
of <hi>Britain</hi> Vote what is declared by the Treaty to
be high Treaſon to attempt; 'tis certainly as great a
Security to the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> as can be deſir'd,
that 'tis declar'd high Treaſon to impugn her Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Shall
it be objected, that the Parliament of <hi>Britain</hi> may
Repeal this; I anſwer, and ſo may the Parliament of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
whenever they pleaſe, as it now ſtands, but if made a
Capitulation of the Treaty, according to my notion of the
Treaty, it can never be altered but by meer Tyranny, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,
Violence and Uſurpation.</p>
            <p>This is the preſent Security of the Presbyterian Church
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſhe is Eſtabliſh't by Parliament, the Soveraign
is Sworn not to alter it, and 'tis high Treaſon in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to attempt it; and all this made a Stipulation previous
to the Treaty, which cannot be broken. If this be not
Security ſufficient, I ſhould be glad to ſee ſomething bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
offered to the high Commiſſioner, that according
to his Grace's Speech, it may be paſt into ſuch a Law,
as may make them fully eaſy.</p>
            <p>It is unhappy, that the Gentlemen who argue on this
Head, will allow the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or the Court, or
both, may have an influence over the whole Parliament of
<hi>Britain;</hi> but cannot have an influence over the ſo much
ſmaller Parliament of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have heard it ſuggeſted by the Enemies of the Nation
of the <hi>Scots,</hi> that they are Poor and Mercenary, and may
be all bought by the Court with 100000. <hi>l.</hi> If this ſlander
be true, 'tis firſt a ſign that the preſent Government in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
does not Bribe them now. Secondly 'tis plain, that
they are not to be Brib'd into the Union, for that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
has not produc'd the Effect yet, and the Court of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0567401700:20"/>
or high-Church, have not on all occaſions bought ſuch
Bills as they have had occaſion for.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, theſe Gentlemen, put ſo little ſtreſs
on the 45 Votes in the Houſe of Commons in <hi>Britain,</hi> that
they think they may be always out Voted, and the <hi>Scots</hi>
may have bad luck to have no Friends in the Houſe of
Commons but their own 45.</p>
            <p>Now, this is the very pretence on the other part of the
Queſtion in <hi>England,</hi> where the Gentlemen put us in mind
how fatal 45 <hi>Scots</hi> Members may be to the Church, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
with the Whigs there; and I am in ſome ſeeming
ſtraight in puſhing either part of the Argument, both ſides
taking hold of it: If I ſay in <hi>England</hi> they are too few to
Hurt us, then ſay the <hi>Scots,</hi> they are to few to Secure us:
If I ſay in <hi>Scotland</hi> they are enough to Secure you, then ſay
they in <hi>England</hi> they are enough to Hurt us.</p>
            <p>This is a very unhappy Caſe, and the Artifices of our
Writers on this Head ſeem very mean here; they are forc'd
to run counter againſt one another, and make ſuch ſhifts,
turns and doubles, to bring things to bear, as I can not
but wonder at.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court <hi>ſay they,</hi> may Bribe the 45 Members
and 16 Lords in the Parliament of <hi>Britain</hi> and they may
join with their Counties Enemies to betray <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in the <hi>Scots</hi> Parliament they pretend they are ſafe,
and the Church will be Secured by them, for <hi>they</hi> cannot
be Brib'd, Bought or Byaſst.</p>
            <p>Again, the Court may get all Epiſcopal Men to Repreſent
the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> at the Parliament of <hi>Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But they can get none that will ſo much as agree to a
Toleration of Epiſcopacy, while they belong to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſo that to Day they may be Brib'd, to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0567401700:21"/>
Morrow they can not; to Day they may be all Epiſcopal
Men, to Morrow they will be a Security againſt Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
            <p>Now,
take the high-Church-Men in <hi>England,</hi> and their
Abſurdities are not fewer than theſe, to Day they tell us 45
<hi>Scots</hi> Men will bring Presbytery into <hi>England,</hi> and pull
down the Church; to Morrow the Diſſenters in <hi>England</hi>
are not one to twelve, and we muſt force the <hi>Scots</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
the Church. Thus, one way a thing is Great, and
another way Small; one way Secure, and another way in
Danger.</p>
            <p>Now, let us place theſe People one againſt another in
each Kingdom. In <hi>England</hi> 45 <hi>Scots</hi> Commoners and
16 Lords, will certainly bring in Presbytery and pull down
the Church of <hi>England;</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> they will join to bring
in Epiſcopacy being brib'd and bought to pull down the
Church of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To Day they are ſo many they will endanger the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Church, to Morrow ſo few they can't defend their own.</p>
            <p>To Day they will be ſo true to Presbytery, they will
never leave Caballing to pull down Epiſcopacy, to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
ſo falſe they will ſell their Country, join in voting
Epiſcopacy up in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and reduce the preſent Church
to a Toleration.</p>
            <p>Theſe things are very counfounding, and no Man can
be prepar'd to debate with Men that will thus go upon all
manner of Poſſibilities.</p>
            <p>I confeſs, in my weak Obſervation, I think they come
all from the ſame Fountain, and are agitated by the ſame
Spirit: <hi>I mean</hi> from <hi>England,</hi> where a vigorous Party
ſtruggles againſt the Union of the Kingdoms, as the only
miſchief can befall their High-Church Cauſe, and effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0567401700:22"/>
deprive them of the opportunities of Embroiling both
Nations.</p>
            <p>I wiſh this Kingdom a little better inform'd of the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
of thoſe People, and entirely deliver'd from their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence.
I obſerve all or moſt part of the Pamphlets againſt
the Union, are form'd in <hi>England,</hi> and ſent from thence, in
which the Authors ſuggeſt things falfe in Fact, preſuming
upon the diſtance of the Place, and that they ſhall be taken
upon their words.</p>
            <p>They repreſent the Union, as a thing which depends
wholly upon the Parliament in this Kingdom, and—the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> entirely acquieſcing in the matter; nay ſome have
repreſented it as a thing the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are courting and wheed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
this Kingdom to, in order to bring them under; and
that there is nothing to do, but to get the <hi>Scots</hi> to comply
with it.</p>
            <p>In order to this, every <hi>Engliſhman</hi> here, whether by his
Curioſity, private Affairs, or by whatever other occaſion
brought here, is rendred ſuſpected as if ſent from <hi>England</hi>
as an Emiſſary to officiate here, in preparing the <hi>Scots</hi> to
their purpoſe.</p>
            <p>I do believe, that in <hi>England</hi> there is a general happy
diſpoſition to this Union, eſpecially in the wiſeſt, beſt and
gteateſt part of that Kingdom; and that this Temper is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
promoted and encreaſed by her Majeſtie's ſteady
adherence to it, as the only means to ſecure the Peace and
Happineſs of both Nations, and as much as poſſible, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing,
checking and diſcouraging, the Party that are againſt
it: And I do acknowledge, to believe, that this happy
diſpoſition is ſuch at this time, that if the Parliament of
<hi>Scotland</hi> cloſes with it, and no unreaſonable difficulties are
raiſed from hence, it will be compleated there.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0567401700:23"/>
But I intreate the Gentlemen on this ſide, to bear with
me in telling them, this happy temper in <hi>England</hi> has not
been ſo eaſy a thing to procure. Abundance of viſible
Providences have been remarkably Concurring, to bring
this Conjuncture to ſuch a Criſis. Great havock has been
made, by their own follies, in the intereſt of a party, under
an adminiſtration, that would never have made the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
            <p>Victories,
of various ſorts, have contributed to the
work, and a connexion of wonders have brought it to paſs;
a conqueſt at home, ſuperiour to <hi>Blenheim</hi> or <hi>Ramellies,</hi>
has been made over the dividing ſpirits of the high party.
Peace and Union has made large ſtrides and rid over the
Bellies of her vanquiſht Enemies, Envy, Malice, Jealouſy
and party ſtrife.</p>
            <p>The Queen, nay the very Biſhops too, have been called
a thouſand Presbyterians, Deſerters of the Church, and all
that is Scandalous. Every Moderate Church Man has
been a Confeſſor in this Cauſe, and gone thro' Scandal,
Reproach and all ſorts of Oppoſition for Eſpouſing it.</p>
            <p>What Tacking, what Projecting, what Caballing have
the Party Attempted, as the Struggles of their Wicked
Cauſe; and with what Difficulty has this Juncture been
brought to paſs.</p>
            <p>Nor are the Party yet in Diſpare, but with all Imaginable
Vigour and Artifice, they carry on their Dying Cauſe, and
D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>pute Inch by Inch every Step.—The laſt Game they
have to Play is the Union, if they can not Deſtroy that
they own the Union will Deſtroy them, and I am very ſory
to ſee the Subtilty of their Proceeding extends hither.</p>
            <p>They leave no Stone untur'nd, they Play Whiggs againſt
Whiggs, and Church againſt Church, Presbyterians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0567401700:24"/>
Presbyterians; They amuſe with Jealouſies on one
hand, raiſe Scruples on the other; in <hi>England,</hi> they
Rail, Gibe and Banter, in <hi>Scotland</hi> they Plead thoſe very
things for arguments, which they own their averſion to.</p>
            <p>Now, I would humbly recommend to theſe Gentlemen, here
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who really are for ſecureing their Church; how
comes Church of <hi>England</hi> Men, High Church hot Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parian
Diſputants to talk of your ſecurity? Does the Fox
Preach, <hi>Garde les Poules,</hi> have a care of the Geeſe?</p>
            <p>Why is it they talk ſo much of the ſecurity of the Church,
and fill your Heads with fear of the Church, whence muſt
this fear come? it muſt come from the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> Pray
Gentlemen, how comes it to paſs, that in <hi>England</hi> all your
Friends are againſt you, and all your Enemies are for you;
By <hi>You,</hi> I mean, <hi>You</hi> Objectors.</p>
            <p>All the High Church Men, all the Enemies of your Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement,
the Enemies of your Trade, and the Enemies
of your Church, are Enemies of the Union, they throng
you with their Pamphlets, and Cant of Securities. Thoſe very
Men who wiſh your Church and perhaps Nation too, at
the <hi>D—l</hi> are turn'd about, and talk of the Security of the
Church, the very <hi>Jure Divino</hi> Men talk of Liberty, the
very Inſtruments of former Tyrannys in <hi>England,</hi> talk of
Preſerving your Laws, Parliaments and Judicatorys.</p>
            <p>This is really ſo Myſterious, that I think it's worth your
Obſervation, and no doubt, but you will find good reaſon
from it, to quicken your Application to the Union.</p>
            <p>I ſhall cloſe this Eſſay with two thinges for I cannot
have room to enter upon the Civil Advantages.</p>
            <p>His Grace the hihg Commiſſioner has Acquainted you, that
he is Impowred to paſs Laws for the further Securing this
Matter in order as I ſuppoſe, to make you Eaſy, and remove the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0567401700:25"/>
Scruples and Fears of thoſe really concerned for the Church.</p>
            <p>Now, in laying hold of her Majeſties offer by His Grace
the High Commiſſioner here, and the like in <hi>England,</hi> there
ſeems to me, to be one ready Step to make both ſides
eaſie, and to remove the Jealouſies on either hand, as to
the Danger of the Church, whether Presbyterian or Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal;
and the Matter is very ſhort, viz. That an Act of
Parliament be paſt in the reſpective Kingdoms, Contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Claim of Church Rights, a Declaration of the
State of either Church, its Conſtitution and Government,
with a formal Capitulation, or Clauſe of Eſtabliſhment,
for either Church, and proper Proviſions, Articles and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations
between them, Declareing their Powers and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.
Which Acts being firſt Paſt in either Kingdom, be
afterwards Incorporated into, and made part of the Treaty
as an Eſſential Condition of the ſaid Union, and this no
Doubt will be Granted.</p>
            <p>To ſay, this may be Caſs'd Annull'd, or afterwards
made Void, ſeems Invidious, and is to my Apprehenſion
Talking nothing at all, for no Subſequent Parliament can
make Null any Article of the Treaty,—it would be no
Treaty, if this could be. The Treaty is the Foundation
and Conſtituent Head of the Parliament of <hi>Britain,</hi> and
gives it a Being, and therefore is ſo far Superiour in it's
Power, as not to be Deſtroyed by its own Subſtitute, and
as I have ſaid elſewhere, to breake the Treaty, is to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
the Conſtitution and very Being of the Parliament,
and Overthrow the Union; and to think <hi>England</hi> will Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to Breaking the Treaty, is too hard a Suggeſtion,
and what I care not to enter upon the Diſcription of here.</p>
            <p>How Prepoſterous is it to Judge, that a Parliament ſhould
hereafter Annull and Aboliſh, in Prejudice of a whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0567401700:26"/>
what, before the very Being of that Parliament was
Declar'd to be their Right, and Aſſented to, Granted and
Capitulated for, on both ſides.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, 'tis poſſible to be done, 'tis poſſible that after
this <hi>England</hi> may Raiſe an Army, and come and Deſtroy
<hi>Scotland;</hi> but it muſt be Contrary to Faith, Juſtice, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
Right, Law and Liberty, and this muſt in its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Diſſolve the Conſtitution, and return the whole Iſland
to its Divided State.</p>
            <p>But ſtill ſays an Objector, we can not help our ſelves, to
take up Arms will be Treaſon and Rebellion &amp;c. And
we ſhall be Treated as Perjur'd Rebells.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, it will be Treaſon and Rebellion in the Letter
of the Thing, but not in the Meaning of the Law; ſo the
taking up Arms to Joyn the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was Treaſon.
And had King <hi>James</hi> Defeated that Prince, and Fruſtrated
the Revolution, the Gentlemen at <hi>Notingham</hi> would ſoon
have found themſelves Treated as Rebells, and the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
would have been Bloody enough.</p>
            <p>But here would be no other Ground for it, than was there;
and ſhould ever ſuch an Infraction of the Treaty happen,
I make no Scruple to ſay, the whole Conſtitution would be
diſſolved, Authority dye, and things would as before Revolve
either to their Divided State, or into all kinds of Confuſions.</p>
            <p>'Tis unkind, I confeſs, to offer ſuch things, of a Body
of Gentlemen, Choſen out of the whole Iſland, and 't would
be endleſs, to give them Anſwers; 'tis Impoſſible there can
be Men enough found in a Parliament, to cloſe with ſo
open a Breach of the very Conſtitution, upon which they
themſelves ſtood. Nor is <hi>Scotland</hi> ſo Inconſiderable a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that <hi>England</hi> ſhould offer ſo foully to Break with them,
and with ſo little Reaſon; Since, in the Caſe Propoſed,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0567401700:27"/>
there can be no pretence to uſe you ſo hardly, but what
muſt be meerly Tyrannical and an Original Violence: In
which, they could expect no Aid, from Heaven or Honeſt
Men. 'Tis a Proſpect ſo Horrid, that I cannot look into
it without concern. No Party-Heats can run to ſuch a
length; Not the Parliament in King <hi>Charles</hi> the 2ds time,
<hi>tho' Loaded with Penſions and Places,</hi> could be brought to
Part with any Branch of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſtitution, neither
can they here, for it will be all one whole Settlement, and
a Diſſolution on one ſide, Diſſolves the other of Courſe.</p>
            <p>I think <hi>Scotland</hi> can have no Security like this Treaty, it
is back't with the Conſtitution, 'tis Fortified with Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulated
Reaſon, and when ever the Flood of Parties attacks
it, 'twill Run-Back and Drown its Contrivers.</p>
            <p>If any Man talks of propoſing more than can be had, it
gives good ground to ſuggeſt he ſhall be beſt pleaſed with
the denial.</p>
            <p>I would cenſure no body in their propoſing higher De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
than are reaſonable, and ſuch as in their nature
muſt embarraſs the Treaty, alarm <hi>England,</hi> and deſtroy
the hopes of an Union; but this I muſt ſay, 'tis juſt what
they are for, who wiſh the Treaty broke off: And 'tis
ſtrange Friends and Enemies ſhould both hit on the ſame
thing, and both propoſe <hi>for ſuch vaſtly different reaſons,</hi> the
ſame Conditions; tis to me a too viſible diſcovery of the
Weakneſs on one hand, and the Policy on the other, and
that's all I ſhall ſay to it.</p>
            <p>I hope the Gentlemen concern'd here, will be too wary
to offer any thing too hard for an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament to
grant; and this is the thing with which I ſhall end this
Diſcourſe. To impoſe ſomething on the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which
'tis known will not paſs, or which Circumſtances conſider'd
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0567401700:28"/>
can not; this would be to come to the Union, but not with
the Spirit of Union.</p>
            <p>I frankly own, I ſee no diſpoſition in the <hi>Scots</hi> Nation
to do ſo, and hope I ſhall not be conſtrued to ſuggeſt it in
this Caſe; I have too much reſpect for the <hi>Scots</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to imagine ſuch a thing:—But I muſt own I
believe, that very thing is the top of the Party-Politicks
now on foot in <hi>England</hi> againſt the <hi>Scots</hi> Nation, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Union in general; to bring <hi>Scotland</hi> if poſſible, to
inſiſt upon ſomething which they know <hi>England</hi> cannot
grant; and for this reaſon we have all their Books againſt
the Union crowded with Queries about Guarantees, Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
ſeparate Parliaments, partial and imperfect Unions,
and the like.</p>
            <p>I acknowledge my ſelf convinc'd, that the Union is the
general Safety of <hi>Britain,</hi> that it is the particular advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of either Nation; and if I was to be askt, whether
Nation have greater advantages from it, I profeſs my ſelf
nncapable of giving a direct anſwer; on this Head it is
that I Diſcourſe, I am perſuaded mutual Security, mutual
Improvement and mutual Proſperity, attends it on both
ſides.</p>
            <p>But there muſt be alſo mutual Confidences and mutual
Affections, or 'tis impoſſible to Unite; Jealouſies, Feuds
and Suſpicions, will rob the Nations of the fruit even
of the Union it ſelf. There cannot be a flux of profitable
Trade, an eaſy, free and uninterrupted conjunction in
Circumſtances and Families, a Coallition of Stocks, Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings
and Improvements, iſ National prejudices are not
remov'd.</p>
            <p>If a new Seal be made, or a new Armorial Enſign for
<hi>Britain</hi> directed, I wiſh the Motto might be, WE ARE
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0567401700:29"/>
BRETHREN, and the Text will add the reſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. 8.
<hi>Let there be no ſtrife between us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let firm Articles, compleat Eſtabliſhments, and full Calu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
form the Union, and the faſter the better; but let us
not Treat with embarraſſing Suſpicions, politick Jealouſies,
and uncharitable cenforious Apprehenſions of one another,
eſpecially where the very Nature of things helps to make
them ſafe; and where both Nations ſeem to mean nothing
but what is ſincere.</p>
            <p>I confeſs when I conſider this, I wonder to ſee <hi>ſome
Libels</hi> and Pamphlets appear here, in which they grant a
nearer Union of the Kingdoms neceſſary for their mutual
Service, and yet endeavour all along to foment Jealouſies
between the Nations; particularly that <hi>England</hi> ſhall op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
<hi>Scotland</hi> after the League is Concluded, and that She
will not Perform the Conditions.</p>
            <p>Nay, one Gentleman forgets himſelf ſo far, as to tell

            <p>I ſhall deſcend but to one more Head of this learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's
Diſcourſe, <hi>having not room for it here,</hi> and that is a
moſt wonderful new invented Syſtem of Politicks ſet down
in his 7th p. the laſt paragraph, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="margQuotes">By the Conſtitution of Parliaments, the Laws are to
have their riſe from the Will and Humour of the People,
ſignifyed by the Lords and Commons.—</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is a ſuggeſtion deſerves ſome Mirth were not the
Subject too Serious; and I ſhould be glad to ſee that Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
or ſome body for him, ſhew me by what part of the
Conſtitution he will prove ſuch a ſuggeſtion.</p>
            <p>Then he ſays, this humour of the People is ſignifyed by
the Lords and Commons, by which he gives the Lords and
Commons a great deal of Honour, that their buſineſs
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0567401700:32"/>
is only to ſignify the Will and Humour of the People</p>
            <p>I hope their Lordſhips know their parliamentary Dignity
and the Commons their Office, better than this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and ſo I take no notice of that, but I hint it upon
this ſcore, <hi>for 'tis in it ſelf too ridiculous to deſerve any

the Laws, and that to poſſeſs their Minds with greater
Dangers and greater Apprehenſions than are juſtly before
them, cannot conſiſt with the care of their Quiet, any
more than with the Publick good.</p>
            <p>The third and fourth Heads, <hi>viz.</hi> Civil Government
and Soveraignty remain, which I cannot enter upon here,
this Tract having run further on than I expected, if it
may be to the publick Service to Treat further on
the Subject, they may be Spoken to by themſelves,
when the Objections of theſe popular Authors againſt
the poſſibility and ſecurity of a civil Coallition may meet
with ſome Reply; and perhaps there may not appear ſuch
weight in them, as ſome People imagine.</p>
            <p>Theſe things I humbly recomend to the <hi>Scots</hi> Nation to

Profeſt a more than Common Regard to this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and am not come Hither without ſome thought of Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling
amongſt them, on the foot of Trade and Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
Eſpecially if the Union follow this Treaty: So I
have preſum'd with all the Calmneſs and Reſpect I can, to
recommend Impartially, not the Imaginary, but the real
Advantages and Securities of this Union, and I ſhould be
very ſory, if any Perſon ſhould miſtake me.</p>
            <p>Nor am I affraid of being ſuſpected here, the Treatment
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0567401700:33"/>
I have met with from Parties and Power in my Native
Country, I think will Secure me from the Scandal
of being an Emiſſary; to a Party I have no Intereſt to Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue,
no Gain to make, no Party to Serve; I ſeek no Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
from the Union, other than in Common with my Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Country. I Contemn the Suggeſtion, as I Scorn the
Employment of an Emiſſary, a Spy, or a Mercenary; my
Buſſineſs is known here: Which tending to Trade, Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and general Improvement, I never purpoſed to
Meddle in this Affair, and I hope I have done it ſo as can
give no offence to any.</p>
            <p>And as I take this occaſion, to ſpeak of my own deſign
of ſettling in this Kingdom, I deſire to ſpeak one word to
the Citizens of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> I know, it is Suggeſted, that
this Union ſhall Prejudice this City, as it ſhall Prevent the
Concourſe of your Nobility and Gentry, and conſequently
the Trade of the City.</p>
            <p>I have obſerved, that, in all the Books, Railling Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets
and Voluminous Arguments againſt the Union, not
one has ever yet Spoke a Word, about your Trade; but all
allow, you ſhall be prodigious Gainers there.</p>
            <p>Shall you then loſe ſomething of the Concourſe of your
Gentry here? Tho I do not grant that neither, Be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd;
you will Gain it Ten fold, in the concourſe of
Strangers. Not this Authors Family only, but Hundreds
of Familys in <hi>England</hi> have their Eyes this way, to Engage
in your Commerce, Embark their Stocks in your Trade,
Manufactures and Fiſhing, Encreaſe your Shipping, and
Improve your Lands.</p>
            <p>It is Impoſſible, but your City muſt Encreaſe the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs
of your Harbour for Shipping, Qualify this City
only to be the Metropolis of this Kingdom in Trade, as well
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0567401700:34"/>
as the Capital for Reſort; and who ever lives 20 Years
here, will ſee you Encreaſe in Wealth and People, and in
Spight of an Unhappy Situation, Encreaſe in Buildings too—Trade
will, and muſt bring Inhabitants, and <hi>Edinburgh</hi>
and <hi>Leith</hi> will certainly be one City in a few Years.</p>
            <p>Trades Men muſt be ſenſible of this, and 'tis plain to the
Meaneſt Capacity, a Fleet of Ships in your Road, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Import and Export, will bring another ſort of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to the City than Ten Parliaments; and 'tis too plain
to need Examination.</p>
            <p>You will then fall to Importing Naval Stores, Building
of Ships, Exporting your own Growth, and Importing
Forreign Goods; And how many Familys will immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
follow ſuch Employments!</p>
            <p>The Citizens and Common People of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> have
therefore the greateſt Cauſe in the World to wiſh for this
Union, as the only way to Redeem them from the Poverty
and Miſery, the preſent want of Trade has Reduc't them to.</p>
