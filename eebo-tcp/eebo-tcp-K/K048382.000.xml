            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Of Apparel and Diet.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THO' at all Times we ought to abſtain from all Manner of Exceſs, yet chiefly ought we ſo to do in the Time of Peſtilence; eſpecially from Exceſs of outward and inward Heat, as that of the Sun, Fire, Cloaths, and hot Air, all very pernicious; this I call outward Heat; inward Heat is ſuch as proceeds from too much eating of Salt, and ſalted Meats, Spices, and all Food of a ſtrong and intenſe Heat, and all ſtrong Malt Liquors, and ſtrong Wines and Spirits.</p>
               <p>Violent Exerciſes are alſo to be avoided, ſuch as provoke <hi>Sweatings,</hi> and particularly, <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition,</hi> and all the Paſſions of the Mind. One muſt likewiſe abſtain from all Repletion of Meat and Drink, that is, to riſe from Table without loading your <hi>Stomach.</hi> The other Exceſs too is equally dangerous, I mean too great a Hunger and Thirſt; a great deal of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0198002100:13"/>Sleep, eſpecially at Day-Time, is alſo to be carefully avoided, as well as letting the Body be too much bound up or coſtive: Thus much in General.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>Apparel,</hi> what is made of Linnen, is certainly beſt; thick Woollens are apt to gather Infections; but Silk and Furs, and Stuffs made of Hair, are principally to be ſhunned, becauſe they very eaſily admit the contagious Air, and retain it a long while. But above all, let every body be particularly careful in being clean in their Dreſs, as well as Lodging. <hi>Hangings</hi> are by no Means to be allowed, bare Walls, or plain, unpainted Wainſcot, are the beſt Furniture; theſe cannot be kept too freſh and clean.</p>
               <p>The frequent Waſhings among the <hi>Jews,</hi> though they had ſomething myſtical in them, and were a Part of their Religion, were yet very conducive to Health; and in Reality, there can be no Religion in being a Sloven; <hi>Pauper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem &amp; non Sorditiem Habitus diligit Deus,</hi> God loves the Poverty, not the Slovenlineſs of a Habit, ſaid St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> of ſome dirty Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious of his Time. The good old Man thought there was no Religion at all in being dirty or louſy.</p>
               <p>The firſt Thing that is to be done in the Morning by thoſe that wear their Hair, is to comb it with an Ivory Comb Forty Times at leaſt, from the Forehead towards the Pole; after that, let them waſh all the Organs of the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0198002100:14"/>Senſes, that is, the Eyes, Ears, Mouth, Tongue, and Teeth; in ſhort, the whole Face, with pure Water, and they who wear Wigs, are to waſh their Head in like Manner. The Eyes are not only to be waſhed, but dipt, or plunged into cold Water, and all the Foulneſs removed from the Eye-lids with this cold Water; it is very neceſſary ſometimes to mix Roſe-water, or Fennel-water and good ſtrong White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine Vinegar; and after the Neck is waſhed, which muſt never be omitted, let it be rubbed with a Towel, ſomewhat coarſer than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary. All this comforts the Body, makes the Mind more lively and chearful, and preſerves the Sight.</p>
               <p>The Gums and Mouth ought to be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly taken Care to be waſhed and cleanſed, and eſpecially the Teeth; to do which, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more proper than the following Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifrices, or Teeth-Powders, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>A cheap Powder to cleanſe the Teeth.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take three dried Egg-ſhells, of Red Coral three Drams, a ſmall Quantity of the Threads of white Silk burnt to Aſhes in a new earthen Pot or Pipkin; Cinnamon, one Dram; Cloves, two Drams; Pelitory-Root, two Drams.</hi>

                  <p>Reduce all to a very fine Powder, and rub your Teeth every Night and Morning, waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with cold Water mixed with Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, or Roſe-water, or both: you may buy the Red Coral of the Apothecary, ready pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>

                  <p>Reduce all to a very fine Powder, ſearſing the ſame through a Tiffany Searſe, as you ſhould the former.</p>
                  <p>Purify your Chamber and your Cloaths with clear Fires made of Juniper, Cypreſs, Pine, or Aſh-wood; as alſo with frequent Sprinklings of Roſe-water and Vinegar. It is alſo very good to ſtrew about your Rooms, ſweet Herbs, and Flowers, as Roſes, Violets, Vine-leaves, Pennyroyal, Thyme, Lavender, and the like, and frequently to make uſe of ſeveral Kinds of odoriferous Fumes to purge and purify the Air, and perfume your ſelf and Cloaths, and very often to waſh your Hands and Face every Day with Water mixed with Vinegar and Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, and never go abroad without a Piece
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0198002100:16"/>of the Root of Dittany, or Zedoary, or ſome candid Spice, in your Mouth, and a Noſegay, or ſome refreſhing Perſume in your Hand; among which, I recommend a little Box of <hi>Warham</hi>'s <hi>Apoplectick Balſam,</hi> made only at the <hi>Golden Ball</hi> in <hi>Fiſher-Street,</hi> near <hi>Red-Lyon-Square;</hi> which is of wonderful Efficacy, and with which it is good to anoint or ſmear a little the Temples; Eye-brows, and Noſtrils: and always juſt before you go out, take a Piece of Bay-leaf, or Orange-peel, or Juniper Berries, which being bruiſed and ſoaked in a little Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, pour upon a red hot Iron, hold your Head over the Fumes, receiving them into your Mouth, Noſtrils, and every Part of your Body and Cloaths. Some will not go out without a little Bunch of Hyſſop, or Rue, which is very good.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who can take Tobacco, would do well to ſmoke a Pipe in the Morning the firſt thing they do. Dr. <hi>Evans,</hi> of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege in <hi>Oxford,</hi> told me not long ſince, that he deſigned Tobacco ſhould be his chief Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine whenever it ſhould pleaſe God to viſit us, and that he would fume his Chambers and Cloaths with nothing elſe; which may be very good for thoſe who are uſed to Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co; and I have been told, that during the laſt Sickneſs in <hi>London,</hi> the <hi>Tobacconiſts</hi> eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the Contagion.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Take a little White Wine Vinegar, if you add Roſe-water, 'twill be the better; which ſet over a Lamp or Candle, when it begins to fume, put in two or three Bay Leaves, a few Cloves, a little Cinnamon and Mace, all bruiſed, and let all fume together; a little</hi> Seville <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range Peel, or Lemon Peel, makes it yet more agreeable.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Of Diet.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT is very eaſy to deſcribe what Kind of Diet ſhould be uſed in ſuch Times of Sickneſs, but it is not ſo eaſy for all People to obſerve it. I ſhall only ſay in general, that ſuch Food as the Appetite moſt delights in, is the beſt: and of Conſequence, that which it does not care for, ought to be avoided. I do not ſpeak here of a depraved Appetite, which has been ruined and debauched by Luxury, for there can be no Rules preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed for ſuch, at leaſt what it will obſerve.</p>
               <p>The ſimpler, and the more plain the Diet is, the better. And here I could wiſh Man had kept up to Nature, and followed what the great Creator of all Things had
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0198002100:23"/>preſcribed to the Infant World, and had ſtill fed on that innocent Food, the Fruits and Herbs of the Earth, and Milk, and the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Productions of the Induſtrious <hi>Bee:</hi> Then would his Blood have flowed free from thoſe noxious Juices engendred from ſuch a Heterogeneous Commixture of the Spirits of ſo many Thouſand Animals which an unbounded cruel Luxury continually ſacrifices and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights.</p>
               <p>Before the Flood, Men did not eat the Fleſh of Animals, and yet they lived much longer.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law, indeed, in ſome meaſure indulged its Followers in this Reſpect; but it muſt be remembred, the Bill of Divorce was in like manner tolerated, for the Hardneſs of their Hearts. The Fleſh Pots of <hi>Egypt,</hi> (the <hi>French</hi> Ragous of that Time) ran in their Minds; but a Toleration is a quite different Thing from an Approbation; and how many Reſtrictions this Toleration was attended with, every one knows that looks into the Bible; the moſt delicious Food was abſolutely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, as Swines Fleſh, and all Shell Fiſh; and the manner of dreſſing was ſuch, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the utmoſt Scrutiny in Relation to the Health of the Animal; and the Blood, as the Life or Soul, was particularly prohibited.</p>
               <p>But the Chriſtian, who has a better Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, who profeſſes to follow a ſuffering Lord, and Self-denying Saviour, tyrannizes over the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0198002100:24"/>whole Creation, flies at all, and without the leaſt Remorſe or Scruple, devours Things ſtrangled, and ſwallows Blood, though ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly forbidden in the ſame Place with For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, in that which he owns to be written by Inſpiration, and a Law decreed by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>The poor Cow, to inſtance no more, after having fed Families with her own Dugs, muſt by cruel, ungrateful Man, be knock'd on the Head, for all her good Offices, and at laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured; and the tender Lamb, juſt dropt from its Mother, (true Emblem of ſweeteſt Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence) be ſnatched, kneeling at the Teat, and ſacrificed to ſatisfy the Appetite, perhaps of a lewd Harlot.</p>
               <p>It is true, <hi>Man</hi> is the Lord of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo is a Maſter of his Family: But what Lord devours his own Subjects? Or, what Father feaſts upon his own Children and Servants?</p>
               <p>I could anſwer all the vain, idle, frivolous Objections, that have been raiſed againſt this unlawful Practice of deſtroying the Creation; but my Buſineſs is not to write of Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, but Health; and however novel this may ſeem to ſome, I am ſure, its oppoſite is only an ancient inveterate Error.</p>
               <p>And I am ſatisfied, that Men, if they would or could abſtain from eating the Fleſh of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, wou'd find themſelves much better in Health; for it is that dreadful mixture of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0198002100:25"/>the Souls, if I may ſay ſo, of ſo many thouſand Animals, deſtroy'd to pamper one, that raiſes that terrible War in the Blood, which has made it a Prey to ſuch Diſtempers, as have baffled the Skill of the moſt learned Phyſicians.</p>
               <p>Let us caſt our Eyes towards <hi>India,</hi> and we ſhall ſee the <hi>Brachmans,</hi> or <hi>Bramins,</hi> who never eat the Fleſh of <hi>Animals;</hi> and yet they live frequently to an Hundred Years of Age.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Italy,</hi> there is a Religious Order called the <hi>Camaldoleſe,</hi> or Monks of St. <hi>Romuald,</hi> who look healthy, and live long, and by their Profeſſion they neither eat Fleſh nor Fiſh.</p>
               <p>The Monks of <hi>La Trappe</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> do the ſame. This Regimen of Life ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Paſſions calm and quiet; while your Fleſh-Devourers are ſoon irritated, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately take Fire, and even, in ſome Senſe, participate of the Nature of the Brutes they feed on.</p>

               <p>But becauſe this Evil came in by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, ſo by Degrees it muſt be extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and ſince it is impoſſible quite to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake it at once, we having derived from our Parents, a Blood made up of theſe Spirits, I ſhall only adviſe my Readers to make Uſe of Fleſh Diet as ſparingly as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, eſpecially in Time of <hi>Peſtilence;</hi> let them chuſe that Sort, that they know they can beſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, and dreſs it thoroughly, and that too after the plaineſt and moſt ſimple manner, avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all rich Soupes, Ragous, Fricaſies, <hi>A la Royalles, a la Daubes,</hi> or <hi>a la Diables,</hi> and all thoſe <hi>Heterogeneous, Gallican,</hi> or rather <hi>Aegyptian Slipſlops,</hi> which are poyſonous, and create ſuch malignant Juices in the Blood, which eaſily unite with the peſtilential <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluvia,</hi> and become a proper Fewel for the <hi>Plague.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Broyling</hi> is undoubtedly the beſt Way of Dreſſing, over a clear Fire, the Meat being thoroughly firſt cleanſed from all Blood, and moderately ſeaſoned with Salt; for Salt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours all Things, and the Fire purifies all Things.</p>
               <p>The next is <hi>Roaſting,</hi> for the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Boyling</hi> comes next, which muſt be done with a large Quantity of Water, that the Meat may have Room enough; and as ſoon
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0198002100:27"/>as the Pot boils, take off the Cover, that the Steam may go up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Frying</hi> and <hi>Stewing</hi> are the worſt of all, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Stew-pan be uncovered; and <hi>Frying</hi> is not very wholſome, becauſe of the Fat the Meat muſt neceſſarily ſwim in, which hinders the Fire from paſſing through the Meat. And <hi>Stewing,</hi> unleſs there be a great deal of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, is only a genteel Name for <hi>Frying.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to <hi>Sauces,</hi> or <hi>Seaſoning,</hi> I recommend, eſpecially with freſh Fiſh, (tho' indeed I do not approve of any Fiſh in the Time of Contagion: I ſay, for <hi>Sauces</hi> or <hi>Seaſonings,</hi> I recommend) Tormentil, Dittany, Fennel, Dill, Gentian, Zedoary, Sanders, never forgetting Roſes; and alſo Vinegar, and Vinegar of Roſes; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, Citron, <hi>Seville</hi> Orange, and Lemon Juices; as alſo Juice of Sorrel, Verjuice, Juice of Pomegranates and Barberries, for all Acids or Sours reſiſt the peſtilential Poyſon, for they are refreſhing, drying, comfort and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve; however, if they offend the Breaſt, qualify them with Sugar; if the Stomach, with a ſmall Quantity of Pepper; for Pepper reſiſts the Putrefaction of the Humours, ſtrengthens Digeſtion; and, provided it be not ground too ſmall, but powdered a little, that is, juſt broken, it helps the Liver.</p>

                  <p>This Electuary is not only an excellent An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote or Preſervative, but is good when one is actually infected, in order to cure the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper; to be given one Dram with White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine, if the Sickneſs begins with Cold; or with Roſe-water, or Scabious Water, if with Heat; but it ought to be taken in Twelve Hours Time after the Beginning of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper</p>
