            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A DISSERTATION, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>ALL thoſe who are concerned in Medical Enquiries, at leaſt thoſe who have had long Practice and Experience, will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily allow, that the Want of an effectual Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for the King's Evil, and all ſcrophulous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, is one of the Deſiderata of the healing Art: For notwithſtanding the boaſted Effects of the Salt Water, aided with the Uſe of Burnt Sponge, Millipedes, Aethiops Mineral, Aethiops Antimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alis, and all other Medicines in Vogue, it has not come to our Knowledge, that two Patients have ever been cured of a confirmed Scrophula, where the Glands were indurated, the Joints ſo affected as to have running Ulcers, the Bones foul, and the Body waſting with a hectic Heat. If, therefore, we are ſo happy as to point out a Medicine, which, without either Confinement, or giving the Patient any Uneaſineſs, will in a little Time cure this Diſorder, which has been hitherto deemed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable, we ſhall think ourſelves intitled to the Good-will of the Public.</p>
            <p>We are not inſenſible, that ſome of the Faculty, who are tender of preſcribing Medicines to their Patients, which have not had the Sanction of the College, will object to this as being a Noſtrum, with the ſpecific Qualities of which they are unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted; but theſe Gentlemen would do well to conſider, that they know as little of many of the Drugs and Medicines they now preſcribe, as they do of this Noſtrum. It is a Diſpute, not yet deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, whether moſt of the Manna exhibited to Sale, is natural or factitious, and thoſe who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe and apply Chemical Medicines, prepared by the common Chemiſts, are in as great a State of Uncertainty as Ignorance and Artifice can place them.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0009901000:3"/>
            <p>But the Objection, which will probably be made to this Medicine, on Account of its Compoſition being a Secret, may perhaps in Time be remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for when its Efficacy is firmly eſtabliſhed and acknowledged beyond Controverſy, the Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors have Thoughts of preſenting it to the Public, if their good Intentions are not prevented by any cruel and unreaſonable Oppoſition.</p>
            <p>All the Favour the Proprietors aſk of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, eſpecially of the Gentlemen of the Faculty, is to give this Medicine a fair and candid Trial in thoſe Caſes only, where all other Medicines in Practice have proved ineffectual. This can neither leſſen their Profits, nor diminiſh their Reputation, but will, we preſume, have a contrary Effect. It may wreſt Patients from the Jaws of Death who may employ them upon ſome future Occaſion, which will add both to their Emolument and Credit; and beſides this, they will feel the Self-ſatisfaction of having acted with Integrity, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and Mercy, which to a wiſe and good Man is a Matter of the greateſt Moment.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who conſider how little Phyſick has been improved by hypothetical Reaſoning, and how much by honeſt Practice and Experience, will be inclined to grant this Medicine a fair and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Trial; and when it is found to cure, will, we doubt not, receive, and apply it in Practice as they do other Medicines; ſince this may be done without the leaſt Reaſon for Reproach. The having cured one Perſon with it will be a ſufficient Reaſon for attempting the Cure of another; Experience will aid the Practitioner, and his Practice will be juſtified upon Principles as rational as any of thoſe on which the Faculty now proceed. All Modes of Practice which are not deduced from Experience are of little or no Effect. Experience firſt laid the Foundation of Phyſick, and it is that alone which can ſupport its Reputation.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0009901000:4"/>
            <p>It will be no Degradation of this Medicine to ſay, it was at firſt diſcovered by Accident, and then perfected by Experience; for if we look back to the Origin of Phyſic, we ſhall find, that it took its Riſe from natural Sagacity improving upon accidental and unforeſeen Events. In the firſt Ages of the World we do not learn from Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, that there were any public Profeſſors in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, though it was ſo effential to the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mankind. <hi>Homer</hi> indeed mentions <hi>Machaon</hi> and <hi>Podalirius</hi> with Eſteem, but from what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in that Poem, they ſeem to be celebrated only for their Art in healing Wounds.</p>
            <p>The Diſeaſed, in theſe early Times, were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally placed in the Streets, the Croſs-ways and other public Places, for the Inſpection and Examination of thoſe who paſſed by, and all who had Skill in the Diſorder, or knew of an efficacious Remedy, thought it a Duty to give their Advice; and when any remarkable Cure was performed, the Memory of it was preſerved for the Benefit of Poſterity, by engraving the Diſorder, and the Symptoms by which it might be known, together with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy and its Succeſs on the Pillars or Walls of their Temples and other public Buildings. By this Means a Variety of Rules and Remedies were Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtered for univerſal Benefit; and as thoſe who travelled for Inſtruction, treaſured up this Sort of Knowledge, as well as that of the Cuſtoms and Manners of the Countries they viſited, the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Tranſactions of one Nation were eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to that of another.</p>
            <p>Thus repeated Trials and Experience laid the Foundation of the Art of Medicine, and taught the Virtues, at leaſt many of the Virtues, of vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, mineral, and animal Subſtances, and in what Diſeaſes they might be applied with Safety and Succeſs. Thoſe, who from long Experience and accurate Obſervation only, had obtained any Degree
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0009901000:5"/>of Skill and Reputation in the Art were called Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirics; a Term, which however miſapplied now, conveyed with it then a very different Idea, and was uſed as a Mark of Eminence and Eſteem; for theſe Empirics did not, like many of our modern Phyſicians, employ their Time in writing fanciful Theories and jumbling falſe Philoſophy with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick Truth, but in carefully collecting what others had gained from Experience, in making cautious Experiments themſelves, and in writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accurate Hiſtories of the Diſeaſes which came under their Cognizance.</p>
            <p>This was the Road to Medical Certainty, and had this Method been carefully purſued, Phyſic would have made a different Appearance from what it does at preſent, and few Diſeaſes would have baffled the Art of the ſagacious Phyſician: But many of the moſt celebrated Practitioners, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too ignorant to make farther Diſcoveries, or too ſelf-ſufficient to avail themſelves of the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of others, fancied that they had arrived at the <hi>Ne plus ultra</hi> of the Art, and inſtead of ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing farther, employed themſelves in accounting for the Operation of Medicines by the mechanic Laws, and in claſſing the Remedies already known, and tying down others to thoſe Forms which they thought proper to approve. Hence all new Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries were deemed Innovations, the Inventors of them branded with the opprobrious Name of Quacks, and both they and their Compoſitions held in the utmoſt Contempt. This Averſion to new Medicines long confined the Uſe of Mercury to Barbers and others ignorant of the animal Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, who cured their Patients, and acquired Fortunes, while the regular Practitioner obſtinately ſuffered his to languiſh and die according to the Rules of Art. This likewiſe was the Caſe of the Bark, which, though now deemed one of the beſt Medicines in the World, was oppoſed with
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0009901000:6"/>all the Acrimony and Virulence that Prejudice and Malice could ſuggeſt.</p>
            <p>The Conſideration of theſe Things, one would think, ſhould ſtimulate the Faculty to the Purſuit of more efficacious Medicines than what are now contained in their Diſpenſatories, and induce them to behave with more Candour to thoſe, who are ſo fortunate as to make new and valuable Diſcoveries. Nor ſhould the Aid of the Legiſlature be here ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected, ſince ſmall Premiums would generally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce thoſe who have diſcovered any valuable Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine to diſcloſe the Secret.</p>
            <p>With Regard to the Medicine, which is the Subject of this Pamphlet, we can ſay with great Truth, that it was firſt diſcovered by Accident, and applied to the Cure of many, and very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Diſorders by a Perſon who had no Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Medicine; but falling accidentally into the Hands of one who had more Skill, and alſo an Opportunity of making proper Obſervations, it was improved from Time to Time, till brought to the State in which it now appears, and found to be an effectual Cure for this dreadful Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. But more of this when we come to deſcribe ſome of the Caſes of thoſe who have been cured. Previous to which, it may ſeem neceſſary for us to give ſome Account of the Diſorder itſelf, and of the Methods hitherto purſued to effect the Cure.</p>

                  <hi>Of the</hi> KING's EVIL.</head>
               <p>THE <hi>King's Evil</hi> appears to have been a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe of great Antiquity, being the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and the <hi>Greek</hi> Phyſicians, and the <hi>Strumae</hi> of <hi>Celſus</hi> and the <hi>Latins,</hi> who ſometimes call it <hi>Scrophula.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The moſt common Seat of this Diſorder is in the Neck, the Arm-pits and Groin, eſpecially in young Children, whom it alſo very frequently
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0009901000:7"/>ſeizes in the upper Lip, which becomes remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly thick and ſometimes chapped; it likewiſe very often affects the <hi>Glandula Lachrymalis,</hi> and brings on a <hi>Scrophulous Opthalmia,</hi> known by its Obſtinacy in reſiſting all common Remedies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scrophulous Tumors</hi> rarely happen to Adults and old Perſons, but when they do, are moſt obſtinate and troubleſome, hardly differing in their Nature from a <hi>Cancer;</hi> in which Caſe, as a Fever is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, the Tumor is unequal, and attended with pulſatory Pains, and the Veins over it become tumid and prominent.</p>
               <p>In the milder Sort the Tumor is equal, round, circumſcribed, not very hard, free from Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and Pain, and in moſt Reſpects reſembling a <hi>Schirrus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Glands of the external Parts are not only affected with this Diſeaſe; for thoſe alſo of the Meſentery are almoſt always found enlarged, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on opening Perſons who have died of it: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the Humour ſometimes falls upon the Lungs, and brings on a <hi>pulmonary Conſumption;</hi> and indeed that Conſumption is generally owing to a <hi>ſcrophu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi> Cauſe, in this and all other Northern Countries.</p>
               <p>Scrophulous Tumors are for the moſt part oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by Obſtructions of the Glands, Want of Exerciſe, Rickets in Children, Want of Digeſtion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And it is generally allowed, that a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Abuſe of the Non-naturals may give Riſe to this Diſorder.</p>
               <p>It is alſo admitted, by ſome Phyſicians, that it may be communicated by Contagion, and by the vitiated Milk of a pregnant Woman.</p>
               <p>But the moſt unhappy and truly deplorable Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of the <hi>King's Evil</hi> is, that it is but too often tranſmitted from Parents to their Children, by way of Inheritance, which it does not eaſily give up, but entails upon late Poſterity. Thus the Relicks of the <hi>Venereal Lues,</hi> a rank, inveterate
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0009901000:8"/>
                  <hi>Scurvy,</hi> or <hi>White Swellings</hi> in any Part of the Body, either of Father or Mother, may put on the true Type and Character of the <hi>Evil</hi> in the Offspring, as well as the <hi>ſcrophulous Virus</hi> itſelf.</p>
               <p>When the Diſorder is mild, the Tumors move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ſuperficial, ſoft, and ſeated in the conglobate Glands of young Children, a Cure is not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaired of, even in the common Method of Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Nay, it is ſometimes known to wear it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf off, as the Growth advances and the Habit al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; for which we have alſo the Authority of <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates.</hi> But when the Tumors attack the Tendons or Ligaments, eſpecially if near large Veſſels, or preſs upon the Windpipe or <hi>Oeſophagus,</hi> they are very difficult of Cure; for whatever Way the Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings are treated, in order to open and cicatriſe them, they generally break out again near the old Scars. When the Diſorder is violent and inveterate it degenerates into a malignant and corroding Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, by which, not only the Part primarily affected, but alſo thoſe contiguous to it are corroded and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and even the Bones made carious. The Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor becomes worſe by being handled, and, becauſe it cannot be brought to Maturation, laſts during the Whole of the Patient's Life. In a word, there is ſcarce any Diſeaſe more obſtinately laſting than this, which has been often thought abſolutely incurable.</p>
               <p>The Ancients had but few Remedies for this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing Complaint. They ſucceeded beſt by the Uſe of the actual Cautery, and Inciſion. The only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Medicine, according to <hi>Celſus,</hi> was, white Hellebore, frequently repeated; excepting a very abſurd one, known only to a few Peaſants, which was that of ſwallowing a Snake.</p>
               <p>The Moderns have gone to work chiefly with Vomits, Purgatives, Deobſtruents, Sudorifics, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbents, Antimonials, and Mercurials, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with Mineral Waters. At the ſame Time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending a moderate and ſlender Diet, lubricat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0009901000:9"/>Broths and Jellies, with Exerciſe, and forbidding all viſcid Aliments, as Cheeſe, Fiſh, and the like.</p>
               <p>As to the external Treatment of ſcrophulous Tumors, it has been attempted to diſcuſs them by mercurial Unguents, Liniments, and Plaiſters, premiſing Phlebotomy, and Purging. If by the Uſe of theſe Means the Tumor did not diſcuſs, but increaſe in Size and Hardneſs, Suppuration was then attempted; and it ſhould ſeem the ſafer and more natural Way of the two; ſince to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to diſcuſs often increaſes the Hardneſs, and turns the Tumor cancerous. In the ſuppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Way, all Evacuations were omitted, and a Plaiſter of <hi>Diach. cum Gumm.</hi> Burgundy Pitch, or the like laid on, and aſſiſted occaſionally with a proper Cataplaſm.</p>
               <p>When the Swelling was ripened, ſo far as to diſcover fluctuating Matter, the Part was opened, either by Inciſion, or Cauſtic, to give Vent to it; and after the Separation of the Eſchar, the Ulcer was dreſſed with a Digeſtive, and then healed. Yet this Method has generally miſcarried.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Proprietors of this Medicine, however, neither attempt to</hi> diſcuſs Tumors, <hi>nor to bring on a</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puration; <hi>they apply no</hi> Cauſtics, <hi>nor terrify their Patients with the</hi> Knife: <hi>Their uſual Way has been, to leave the Afflicted to the</hi> Medicine, <hi>and to</hi> Nature, <hi>which kindly co-operating have always produced an happy Event.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>King's Evil,</hi> as in moſt other chronical Diſeaſes, ſpecific Remedies have been recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, applauded, and relapſed into Diſuſe, in all Ages. The <hi>Veratrum album,</hi> or <hi>White Hellebore,</hi> has been mentioned already. The <hi>Tactus Regalis</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Sovereigns, ſo long held in reverential Eſteem, is, at this Day, if not univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally, at leaſt, by the moſt Judicious, given up, and no longer in Uſe. Dr. <hi>Gideon Harvey</hi>'s <hi>Antimonium reſuſcitatum</hi> had its Run; and ſo, in our Days,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0009901000:10"/>has Dr. <hi>Huxham</hi>'s <hi>Eſſence of Antimony.</hi> Above twenty Years ago, a Lady of the firſt Nobility was cured of a very large Tumor in her Neck, by Means of a Specific, then kept a great Secret, altho' it has been affirmed, that the Cure afterwards coſt her her Life. This proved to be <hi>burnt Sponge,</hi> a Medicine adopted indeed by the late Dr. <hi>Mead,</hi> who uſually adminiſtered it, mixed with <hi>purified Nitre, Coralline</hi> and <hi>Sugar:</hi> But it has been known to fail in a hundred Inſtances. The late Dr. <hi>Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,</hi> who practiſed in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> laid great Streſs upon <hi>Sea-Water</hi> as a Specific in glandular Diſorders; and it has been uſed in our Hoſpitals, but is like the reſt, almoſt grown out of Faſhion. Laſtly, the <hi>Peruvian Bark</hi> is ſaid, to have done great Service in theſe Complaints. Dr. <hi>Fordice</hi> relates ſix or ſeven remarkable Caſes, in which he gave it with much Succeſs. Dr. <hi>Fothergill</hi> has likewiſe adminiſtered the Bark in ſcrophulous Diſorders, and avers, that it may not only be given with Safety, but to manifeſt Advantage, in certain Caſes; however that it will not ſucceed in all. He has never known it avail much where the Bones were affected, nor where the ſcrophulous Tumor has been ſo ſituated, as to be attended with much Pain, as in the Joints, or under the membranous Covers of the Muſcles; for when theſe Parts are concerned, the <hi>Perioſteum</hi> ſeldom eſcapes without ſome Injury; in which Caſe the Bone will be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe affected, and then, he is of Opinion, that the Bark will haſten the Progreſs of the Diſeaſe. The <hi>Cicuta Vulgaris</hi> has been alſo given in this, as well as in cancerous Caſes, and, according to Dr. <hi>Storck,</hi> with very good Effect in ſome Parts of <hi>Germany;</hi> however, in this Climate it ſeems to fail, which confirms me in an Opinion, I have long entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>i. e.</hi> that various Plants have different Effects in different Countries, as well as on different Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions.</p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0009901000:11"/>
               <p>After all, could a Specific be found out, of ſuch a Nature, as equally to ſuit the Conſtitution of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants and Adults, Reſpect being had to the Doſe, which would act placidly, without ſenſible Evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, or ruffling the Habit; and as Dr. <hi>Friend</hi> expreſſes it, <hi>per aliquas non patentes Vias</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Edit. Libb. I. &amp; III. Epidem. Hippocrat.</note>, ſo as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually to eradicate this moſt perverſe Diſeaſe, the <hi>Opprobrium</hi> of all ancient and modern Medicine, of what unſpeakable Emolument would ſuch a Diſcovery be to the Afflicted, and what would not the Inventor merit from Mankind? Such a Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific we now offer the Public, which has ſucceeded in many, and all Caſes where it has been hitherto adminiſtered; and which is at this Time entruſted to the farther Trial of a Gentleman of unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable Skill and Eminence in Hoſpital Practice, whoſe Report of it cannot fail of being abſolutely deciſive and ſatisfactory.</p>
               <p>It may not be amiſs, however, to lay before the Public, an Account of the Succeſs it has had in thoſe Caſes wherein it has been adminiſtered by the Proprietors, though Perſons but little ſkilled in the Art of Medicine.</p>

               <head>The <hi>CASES</hi> of ſeveral Perſons who have been cured by this <hi>MEDICINE.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE firſt <hi>ſcrophulous</hi> Patient, to whom it was adminiſtered, was Mr. <hi>William King,</hi> of <hi>St. Mary Magdalen Bermondſey, Southwark;</hi> who, at that Time, had been long afflicted with the <hi>King's Evil,</hi> and had near forty running Ulcers, many of them on the Joints, by which he was greatly emaciated, and thought conſumptive. The Bones were carious, many rotten Pieces came away from his Legs, and he was, by the Surgeons who attended him, deemed incurable. Yet this Man was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly reſtored by the above-mentioned Medicine; and to ſatisfy ſome Gentlemen at <hi>Paris,</hi> who wanted
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0009901000:12"/>to be properly informed of the Fact, he made an Affidavit of his being cured by this Medicine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Sir <hi>Joſeph Hankey,</hi> in Preſence of Mr. <hi>Weldon,</hi> the Notary Public, whoſe Teſtimonial bears Date the 15th of <hi>February</hi> 1752.</p>
               <p>The next Perſon, to whom it was adminiſtered, was Mr. <hi>John Deane,</hi> of <hi>Saffron Hill,</hi> in the Pariſh of <hi>St. Andrew Holborn.</hi> This Patient, when he took the Medicine, had been afflicted with the <hi>Evil</hi> ſeven or eight Years; which began with a Swelling in his left Eye, and the Glands of his Neck. He had, at the Time of his firſt taking it, many running Ulcers, which had been often opened with Cauſtics, and he was inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Surgeons of one of our Hoſpitals, to whom he had applied for Relief, that his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order was incurable. Mr. <hi>Deane,</hi> however, was ſoon cured by this Medicine, and in the Courſe of near eleven Years has had no Return of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order. Soon after the Cure was perfected he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and has had ſeveral healthy Children. His Caſe was alſo ſent to <hi>Paris,</hi> after being atteſted on Oath before Mr. Alderman <hi>Ironſide,</hi> in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Mr. <hi>Weldon,</hi> the Notary Public, whoſe Certificate is dated the 13th of <hi>March</hi> 1752.</p>
               <p>In Conſequence of this ſome of the Medicine was ſent to <hi>Paris,</hi> where, we are informed, it ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected many extraordinary Cures; but the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars are not come to our Knowledge: However, that it was tried in one of the Hoſpitals with Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, will appear by the following Extract of a Letter from Mr. <hi>James Burton</hi> to one of the Proprietors.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>"During my Stay at <hi>Paris,</hi> which has been more than ſix Months, I have daily frequented the Hoſpitals, and had an Opportunity of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the good Effects of your Pills for the Cure of the <hi>Evil,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Cartier</hi> has adminiſtered under the Inſpection of the Phyſicians. I think he has eight Patients, all miſerable Objects, but
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0009901000:13"/>I cannot help mentioning particularly the aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing Effect it has had on a <hi>German,</hi> born at <hi>Deux Ponts,</hi> whom I have often interrogated reſpecting his Complaint. The Diſtemper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in his great Toe; but by ſome Applications, uſed by the Surgeons, the Humour was repelled and fixed in his right Leg, where it broke out in eight Ulcers, which being obſtinate it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, in a Conſultation of Phyſicians and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, to take off the Leg; but his Parents not conſenting, other Methods were uſed to prevent the Diſorder from ſpreading, tho' without Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; for he continually grew worſe, and, after he had been in this deplorable Way for eight Years, his Parents ſent him to <hi>Paris.</hi> Here he arrived in <hi>June</hi> 1748, and entered the <hi>Hotel-Dieu,</hi> in <hi>St. Andrew</hi>'s Ward; where he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two Years, and during that Time grew worſe, on which he was diſcharged the Ward as incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and ſent into the <hi>Salle d'Oſier,</hi> where he took your Medicine. He had, at this Time, twenty-one running Ulcers, eight of them were on his right Foot, and eight on his right Hand, the Uſe of which he had entirely loſt. He had likewiſe a large Swelling under each Arm, the Glands on each Side his Throat were ſwelled as big as an Hen-Egg, and he had five running Ulcers in his Neck. After he had taken your Medicine about eight Months his Ulcers all heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Uſe of his Hand was reſtored, the Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings broke and healed, and the Man is now in perfect Health. I have no other View, in ſending you this Account, but to induce you to make it public in <hi>England;</hi> for it is hard that your fellow Citizens ſhould be deprived of ſuch a Benefit."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We have not the Honour to know Mr. <hi>James Burten;</hi> but Mr. <hi>Cartier</hi> is now in <hi>London,</hi> and ready to give Teſtimony to the Truth of what is here related.</p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0009901000:14"/>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Iſaac Harman,</hi> Clerk to <hi>Thomas Watſon,</hi> Eſq; Callico-Printer, at <hi>Morris</hi>'s <hi>Cauſeway, Lambeth,</hi> was for near fifteen Years afflicted with this Diſorder, which moſtly affected his Joints; for he had Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors under each Ham, Ulcers on the left Leg, almoſt from one Ankle to the other, and three on his right Foot; the Bones about the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle were foul, many Pieces came away, and he was ſo reduced by the continual Diſcharge that he could hardly ſtand. He took this Medicine, and was perfectly cured; for, though nine Years are elapſed, he has had no Return of his Complaint, but has enjoyed an exceeding good Share of Health, and is remarkably active and ſtrong.</p>
               <p>We muſt obſerve, that Mr. <hi>Harman</hi> married ſoon after he was cured, and has four Children living, which are all very healthy.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>John Morgan,</hi> Cutler, now living at Mr. <hi>Savigny</hi>'s in <hi>Pall-mall,</hi> was afflicted with this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, and admitted into one of our Hoſpitals for Cure, where his Tumors were ſeveral times laid open, and, beſides taking other Medicines, he drank a very large Quantity of Sea-Water, but without the leaſt Benefit. After he came from the Hoſpital he applied for this Medicine, which he began to take about <hi>Midſummer</hi> 1755. The <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> following, he found himſelf abundantly better, and in the next Spring all his Ulcers were entirely healed, without any Loſs of Time, or Interruption in Buſineſs. He has been now cured near ſeven Years, and has had no Symptoms of a Return.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John Shadwell,</hi> now Apprentice to Mr. <hi>Waldron</hi> Shoemaker in <hi>Baſinghall-ſtreet,</hi> was, when about ſeven Years old, ſeized with a Swelling in the Elbow. After ſome Time he was carried to a Surgeon in the Neighbourhood, who told his Friends that the Bone was foul, and adviſed them to take him to an Hoſpital, which they did, and he continued there ſeventeen Weeks, and was then
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0009901000:15"/>diſcharged as incurable. He was after this admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into another Hoſpital, where he continued four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Weeks, and was alſo thence diſcharged as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable. At this Time he had five running Sores in one Arm, and three in the other; one of which was directly in the Joint of the Elbow. He had alſo Ulcers in his Neck and Face; many of which had been opened with Cauſtics, and could not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards be healed. In this Situation his Friends applied for the Medicine, which is the Subject of this Pamphlet. After he had taken it ſome little Time, there was a large Diſcharge from all the Ulcers, and in about two or three Months he was abundantly better in Health. He continued taking the Medicine as directed, and by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees all the Wounds healed up, and he has been now four Years perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Vias,</hi> who kept a Boarding-School for young Ladies in <hi>Harley-ſtreet, Cavendiſh-ſquare,</hi> but is now removed to the Boarding-School near <hi>Ranelagh-Houſe, Chelſea,</hi> has ſeen the good Effects of this Medicine on a Perſon who was under her own Care. We ſhall give the Reader this Lady's Sentiments in her own Words.</p>

               <p>The Lady Mrs. <hi>Vias</hi> ſpeaks of has been now cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed near ſix Years, and remains perfectly well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thomas Moſs,</hi> of the Pariſh of <hi>St. Olave's, South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark,</hi> had the <hi>Evil</hi> to a great Degree, but was ſoon cured by taking this Medicine.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Robert Rees,</hi> Apprentice to Mr. <hi>Marſh,</hi> Woollen-draper in <hi>White-hart-yard, Drury-lane,</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0009901000:16"/>laboured under a ſcrophulous Complaint many Years, for which he took divers Medicines with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Effect, and was three Years under the Care of Dr. <hi>Ward.</hi> During which Time, the Diſorder, ſo far from abating, encreaſed to that Degree that he had ſeveral Ulcers in his Arms and Feet, a very large Ulcer on the Inſide of his right Thigh, many running Sores and Tumors about his Neck, one of which was as large as a Cricket-Ball, and he was ſo weak that he could hardly walk. He took this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, which ſoon gave him Strength, and by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees all the Tumors diſperſed, the Ulcers healed, and he is now perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Joſeph Poole,</hi> one of the Clerks of the <hi>Bank,</hi> had a Son, who was long afflicted with a ſcrophu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Diſorder, which made its firſt Appearance when he was about four Years old. It began with a Swelling in one of his Fingers, and in one of his Feet. He took many Medicines from different People, but to no Purpoſe, and was ſix Months under the Care of Dr. <hi>Ward,</hi> whoſe Medicines diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreed with him, and he grew worſe. Upon which Application was made for the Medicine, which is the Subject of this Pamphlet. He had taken it but a little Time before he found himſelf abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly better, and ſoon after all his Wounds heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and he continues perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Elizabeth Hiller,</hi> of <hi>Piccadilly,</hi> has a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter who was long afflicted with this Diſorder, and which ſeized her when ſhe was about two Years old. She applied to one of the Hoſpitals for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and was continued two Years as an Out-Patient, but received no Benefit, either by the Medicines ſhe had there, or by what was applied by others. When ſhe firſt entered upon a Courſe of this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine her right Foot was very much ſwelled and ulcerated, and the Bone foul. She had a large Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer in her Hand, and another in the Middle of her right Cheek. After ſhe had taken this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0009901000:17"/>ſome Time, the Ulcers began to heal, and ſhe is now perfectly well.</p>

                  <hi>Thomas Amer,</hi> of the Pariſh of <hi>St. Giles's, Crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plegate,</hi> in the City of <hi>London,</hi> was ſeized with this Diſorder, and in the Space of two Years had a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor ulcerated in his Thigh, another in his Arm near the Elbow, the third Finger on his left Hand was much ſwelled, and had an Ulcer by the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Joint that ran quite through the Finger, the Bone of which was foul, and during the Cure ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral rotten Pieces exfoliated, and came away. A Surgeon, who lived in the Neighbourhood, told his Friends, that it was a very bad Caſe, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed them to take him to an Hoſpital. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, he was an Out-Patient at one of our Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals for ſome Months, when the Surgeons ſaid they could do him no Service, unleſs his Finger was taken off. Upon this he went to Dr. <hi>Ward,</hi> and was under his Care for twelve Months, during which Time he grew much worſe, and his Health was ſo much impaired, when Application was made for this Medicine, that his Friends did not expect him to live a Month. This Medicine, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſoon reſtored him to better Health, and by Degrees all his Ulcers healed, and he has now the perfect Uſe of his Limbs, and has continued well ever ſince the Ulcers were firſt healed, which is now ſomewhat more than two Years.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Banniſter,</hi> who keeps a Stable-yard in <hi>Old Bond-ſtreet,</hi> has a Daughter who was much afflicted with a ſcrophulous Diſorder. It appeared ſoon after ſhe had the Small-Pox, and when ſhe was about four Years old, by a Tumor in her Cheek, and others on her Feet, which ulcerated, and fouled the Bones. She had alſo a Tumor on one Arm, and the Diſorder had much affected her Eyes: After taking various Medicines, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving any Benefit, ſhe was perfectly cured by this.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>John Chandler,</hi> at Mr. <hi>Smith</hi>'s, Watchmaker
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0009901000:18"/>in <hi>Chiſwell-ſtreet, London,</hi> was afflicted with this Diſorder. It firſt made its Appearance by a Swelling of the Glands in his Neck, which being greatly encreaſed in the Space of a Month, he went to a Surgeon, who applied a Poultice to the Part, and after ſome Time opened it with a Cauſtic, but the Wound thus made was ſo obſtinate that it could not be healed. And another Tumor ſoon came in his Neck, which encreaſed to a great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and in Time affected his Shoulder, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him unable to purſue his Buſineſs. In this State he was admitted into one of our Hoſpitals, where he continued nine Weeks, and was ſeveral times lanced, but without obtaining any Relief. He then put himſelf under the Care of a foreign Phyſician, who undertook to cure him; but the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order ſtill increaſing, and his Health, as well as his Ulcers, growing worſe, he, in <hi>February</hi> laſt, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied for this Medicine. At this Time he had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral very bad Ulcers about his Neck, and his left Breaſt, all of which healed after he had taken the Pills a few Months, and he is now (<hi>Dec.</hi> 13, 1762) perfectly well, and has been ſo for ſome Time paſt.</p>
               <p>A Gentleman, in the Neighbourhood of <hi>St. Paul's Church-yard,</hi> had a Child about three Years old, who had many ſtrumous Swellings in the Neck, that were very large, hard, and ſo obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, as not to ſubmit to any of the common Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Treatment; which the Father informing Dr. BEVIS of, that Gentleman, agreeable to his uſual Candour and Humanity, adviſed him to apply for this Remedy, having himſelf experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the good Effects of it on two Patients before. The Child took the Medicine about two Months, which gave it no Sort of Uneaſineſs, and the Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings entirely diſappeared.</p>
               <p>Since this Pamphlet was put to the Preſs, (that is to ſay, this 17th of <hi>Dec.</hi> 1762) we received a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the Rev. Mr. BROWNE, Vicar of <hi>Olney,</hi> near <hi>Newport Pagnel,</hi> in <hi>Buckinghamſhire,</hi> (the well known Author of the <hi>Sunday Thoughts,</hi> and other valuable
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0009901000:19"/>Pieces) of which Letter the following is an Extract.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>"Every one muſt be ſenſible, that in a Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of ſo loathſome a Kind, as this of the <hi>King's Evil,</hi> moſt Perſons ſhow a Delicacy in having their Names made public. I have, therefore, concealed the Name of a female Patient; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers I here communicate to you to print or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal as you think proper, it being to them indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent: But the Facts are certain and notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and it will be of Weight with all conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Perſons to have it publicly advertiſed, that any who propoſe themſelves for Cure, and want farther Satisfaction, may receive all they can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, in this Particular, from the Parties who were cured, or from me at <hi>Olney</hi> in <hi>Buckinghamſhire,</hi> where the Cures here mentioned were performed.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>"JOHN BUTCHER, <hi>Baker,</hi> an Inhabitant of the Pariſh of <hi>Olney</hi> in <hi>Bucks,</hi> about thirty Years of Age (from a violent Blow, as was thought, of a large Piece of Wood falling on him) had a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſion and Swelling on the Noſe, which increaſed and grew very much inflamed with livid and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alarming Appearances. He had the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of ſeveral Surgeons, Apothecaries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> both here and at <hi>Northampton;</hi> was purged, dieted, bled, lanced, and had ſeveral Fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations applied to the Part, together with Salves and other topical Applications, for the Space of a Year and a Quarter. The Diſorder, however, grew worſe, and by general Conſent his Caſe was adjudged an inveterate and incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Strumae.</hi> He was, from a florid Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and robuſt Make, now become wan as a Corpſe, emaciated to a mere Skeleton, and lay unable to feed, turn, or do any the leaſt Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices for himſelf, being as feeble as an Infant. The whole Bone of the Noſe grew carious, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foliated, and came all away; the Fleſh of the upper Lip was eaten entirely off, and left the Jaw and Teeth bare, and his Speech became ſo hollow and inarticulate, that thoſe who were
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0009901000:20"/>moſtly with him could hardly underſtand a Word he ſaid, and all about him daily expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Death. He could take nothing but a little Pap, or ſoft liquid Food, adminiſtered to him in a Boat, as they do to Infants in the Month; and his medical Aſſiſtants had all left him. In this deplorable Caſe I found him, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly deſirous of Life; his Appetite ſtrong and craving, and he had ſome Degree of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Strength, which gave me Hopes. I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately adviſed your Medicine; it was tried, and he found almoſt preſent, and (in uſing it about three Months) aſtoniſhing Benefit; the fetid Diſcharge and Ulcers were removed and healed, the other Parts grew well; he got up, eat, became hearty as ever, went abroad, and I myſelf ſaw and ſpoke with him at a Place he had walked to above two Miles from Home on Buſineſs, which he was now very well able to perform. This was in the Summer about five or ſix Months after his firſt taking the Medicine. He worked from that Time at Carting, Hedging, and other robuſt Labours; helped at getting in Harveſt that Year, and ſeemed as able as any of them; and I believe, and ſo do his Friends, that he is now as free from the <hi>Evil</hi> as any Perſon whatever; and has continued well ever ſince the Cure was performed, which is ſomewhat more than two Years.</q>
               </p>
               <p>

                  <q>"An Inhabitant of the Town aforeſaid who was upwards of thirteen Years old, has been for ſeveral Years afflicted with the <hi>King's Evil;</hi> had ſore Eyes, and hard ſtrumous Tumors in the Glands of the Throat, as is common in thoſe Caſes. Mr. THOMAS ASPRAY, Surgeon
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0009901000:21"/>and Apothecary in this Town, undertook her Cure with your Medicine, and alſo applied Bli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters on the Sides near her Ears to promote the Diſcharge of Matter.

               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Browne</hi> relates another Caſe more extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary than the former, of a Boy who had loſt the Uſe of one Foot with the <hi>Evil,</hi> whom he took in Hand, after the Surgeons had prepared to cut the Limb off. He has by this Medicine recovered the Uſe of his Foot, but as the Boy is not yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly well, we ſhall at preſent take no farther No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his Caſe.</p>
               <p>One other Circumſtance we ſhall mention, which will undoubtedly have great Weight with the Public. It is the Succeſs this Medicine has had on five Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the Charity-houſe called <hi>Burlington-ſchool,</hi> in Old <hi>Burlington</hi> Street, in the Pariſh of St. <hi>James</hi>'s <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> to whom it has been given under the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection of a Gentleman, whoſe Skill and Abilities have long diſtinguiſhed him as one of the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent of his Profeſſion. Though we have not Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to inſert his Name, we cannot omit this Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of returning him our Thanks for his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite Behaviour and great Candour on that Occaſion; and, we doubt not, but that Humanity which promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to ſee this Remedy adminiſtred to the Children above-mentioned, will induce him to ſpeak of the Medicine as he thinks it deſerves.</p>
               <p>Theſe Children, previous to their taking the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, were examined by the above-mentioned Gentleman, after they had been delared to be in a very bad State by a Surgeon of Character who had attended them. The Medicine was firſt given them in <hi>April</hi> laſt. Two of them are cured, another nearly ſo, and the other two are in a fair way of having their Health ſoon eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0009901000:22"/>
               <p>More Evidence might be produced in Favour of this Medicine, and ſome Caſes inſerted which are extremely ſingular; but many Perſons, who have been cured, have deſired to be concealed; among which are ſeveral Ladies who are ſince married, and have very healthy Children. Their Names, it is true, would do Honour to this Pamphlet, and greatly promote the Uſe of the Medicine; but the Public will be pleaſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that the Proprietors ought not, nay they cannot, break the Ties of Honour, and betray the Confidence repoſed in them, though in Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of Truth. The reaſonable Man, we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, will be ſatisfied with what is above related, yet ſhould there be any ſo incredulous, as to require farther Conviction, reſpecting the Safety and Efficacy of this Medicine, they may obtain it, and be introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Proprietors, by applying to the Publiſher of this Pamphlet.</p>

               <p>THE <hi>Proprietors</hi> of the Medicine within mentioned beg Leave to addreſs the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and the Humane, in Behalf of thoſe poor Creatures, who are unhappily afflicted with all Scrophulous Complaints, eſpecially the <hi>King's Evil,</hi> which is generally deemed incurable, and of which many unhappy Wretches are daily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from our Hoſpitals.</p>
               <p>A MEDICINE has been diſcovered (which is an Alterative, and therefore the better adapted to all Conſtitutions) that effectually eradicates thoſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders in a ſhort Time, and, during that Interval, viſibly amends and ſtrengthens the Conſtitution.</p>
               <p>That this is a Truth, will be made manifeſt by a Number of Patients who have been cured by this Medicine, even after they were diſcharged as incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from the Hoſpitals, and who are at all Times ready to be examined in the moſt ſtrict and ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Manner. Now what the Proprietors propoſe,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0009901000:23"/>is, that a ſmall Houſe, in Manner of an Hoſpital, be opened for the Reception of Patients, by the charitable Contributions of the NOBILITY, GEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRY, and Others, which ſhall be carried on under the Inſpection of the Subſcribers, or the Inſpection of thoſe whom they ſhall appoint, and which ſhall be furniſhed by the Proprietors with this Medicine the firſt Year <hi>gratis,</hi> and after that at ſuch Price only as the Ingredients ſhall really coſt; ſo that the Proprietors deſire no Profit for themſelves, but will contribute, as much out of their own little Fortunes as they can afford; nor will they have any Concern in receiving the Money, but will leave the Receipts and Diſburſements, and all other Matters, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Admiſſion of Patients, and the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Hoſpital, intirely to thoſe, who ſhall be appointed to the Truſt by a Majority of the Subſcribers.</p>
               <p>Nor is this Application made with a View of raiſing any Money; it is intended only to try whether a Sum ſufficient can be raiſed to eſtabliſh a ſmall Hoſpital, in Caſe the Proprietors ſhall make every Allegation appear to the entire Satisfaction of the Public: All that is intreated therefore for the preſent, is, that every LADY and GENTLEMAN, inclined to promote this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Undertaking, will be pleaſed to ſignify what Sum they would chuſe to contribute yearly or otherwiſe; when they are ſatisfied of the Truth of what is here aſſerted, and ſee the Scheme carried into Execution by Perſons of their own Appointment.</p>
               <p>Books will be opened for the Names of thoſe who are charitably inclined to encourage this Undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and, when a ſufficient Number are collected, a Place of Meeting will be appointed, by an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement in the <hi>London Gazette,</hi> and other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, to elect proper Perſons for the Management of the Charity, and to ſee the Teſtimonials, and examine the Patients who have been cured.</p>

            <head>POSTSCRIPT.</head>
            <p>DECEMBER 18, 1763.</p>
            <p>FROM the Truths ſet forth in the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pamphlet, and the Candid and humane Propoſal which the Proprietors made to the Public reſpecting an Hoſpital for the Cure of the Evil, added to their extreme Readineſs on all Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions to give their Medicines and Attendance to the Poor <hi>gratis:</hi> From theſe Conſiderations, I ſay, one would have thought that all who had ſeen the Effects of this Medicine, and the eaſy Manner in which it eradicated the Diſorder, would, for the general Good, have lent their Aid towards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting its Uſe. It was what the Proprietors flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered themſelves with; but how far they have been miſtaken, will appear in the following Narrative.</p>
            <p>In <hi>April</hi> 1762, a Surgeon of the firſt Eminence for his well known Humanity, Candour, and Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, was accidentally informed by a Gentleman then in Company with him, that a Medicine had been diſcovered, which had cured great Numbers of the Evil, even in the worſt State of the Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; the Surgeon anſwered, that for the Benefit of Mankind, he moſt ſincerely wiſhed it might prove ſo, and be brought into general Practice, for that this was one of the Deſiderata in the Art of Healing; adding withal, that he ſhould be very glad to ſee the Parties concerned, and be further informed of the Matter. Some Days after this, one of the Proprietors waited on this Gentleman with ſome of the Medicine, and took with him ſeveral Perſons who had been cured by it, to give their Teſtimony of the Truth. After he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0009901000:25"/>amined theſe Patients, with reſpect to the Situation they were in at the Time they firſt took the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, and had ſeen the Scars of the Ulcers that had been healed, he acknowledged that the Cures were very extraordinary, and then ſaid, that there were ſome Children afflicted with this Diſorder in <hi>Burlington</hi> School, in <hi>Old Burlington-ſtreet,</hi> which was maintained by Subſcription, and it would be a Charity to cure them. This was readily agreed to, and five Children were examined, four of which were undertaken, as their Diſorder evidently appeared to be the Evil; but the fifth ſeemed to have a Complaint of a different Nature; however, the Medicine was given to them all. At the Time when this Medicine was firſt adminiſtered to the Children, a Gentleman of the Faculty, who had examined them, ſmiled at the Attempt, and ſaid there was no Cure for them; however, his Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtication has proved him no Conjuror, for in the Space of nine Months, two of the four which were undertaken, were perfectly cured; ſince that another is got well, and in all Probability the fourth would have received a Cure e'er this Time, but for the following Accident.</p>
            <p>In <hi>December</hi> laſt, the preceding Diſſertation on the King's Evil was made public, in which the Reader will obſerve, there are ſet forth for the Satisfaction of the Public the Caſes of many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who have been cured by this Medicine; and among others, ſome Notice is taken of the Children above mentioned. This naturally led thoſe who were themſelves afflicted with this Diſorder, or had Friends in that deplorable State, to enquire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Medicine, at this Place as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and during the Time that Mrs. <hi>Martin</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Governeſs of the Houſe, who was a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, diſcreet, and worthy Woman, the Children were ſhewn to them, and they obtained the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0009901000:26"/>Information; but Mrs. <hi>Martin</hi> declining that Office to go and live with her Daughter, who was then married, another Perſon was appointed to the Truſt; who, for Reaſons beſt known to herſelf, or to her Coadjutors, thought proper to behave in a rude Manner to the Gentleman who attended, and not only ſo, but to falſify the Truth, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead thoſe who came to enquire of her concerning the Children; which ſhe did to ſeveral, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to Mrs. <hi>Baker,</hi> as will evidently appear by her Atteſtation.</p>
            <p>The Manner of her Behaviour Mrs. <hi>Baker</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly and fairly diſcloſed to the Proprietors of the Medicine, upon which Application was made to the Surgeon, at whoſe Inſtance the Cure of the Children was undertaken. He, being greatly irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated at ſuch ſhameful and injurious Behaviour, deſired a Committee of the Houſe might be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and ſaid the Truth ſhould not be ſuppreſſed. A Committee accordingly met the 21ſt of <hi>July,</hi> 1763, and this Gentleman attended. The Affair was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into, and it apperead, that two of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were perfectly cured, and had left the Houſe; and <hi>Mary Somers,</hi> another of them, was called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Board, and upon ſtrict Examination, was found, and declared, to be perfectly well. The Woman that had behaved ſo ſcandalouſly was then called, and Mrs. <hi>Baker,</hi> who for the Sake of Truth was ſo kind as to attend, told the Committee the whole of her Behaviour to her, when ſhe came to enquire concerning the Cure of the Children. The Woman at firſt equivocated, but at laſt ſhe confeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Truth, aſked Pardon, and ſaid, ſhe was ſorry for what ſhe had done. The Gentlemen of the Committee then aſked her, who put her upon giving ſuch Anſwers? But all they could get from her was, that a tall Gentleman had been there, and talked to her about it, but ſhe did not know his Name. She
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0009901000:27"/>was then ſeverely reproved; and the Committee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the Proprietor of the Medicine ſtill to attend on the other Girl who was not yet well, and complete the Cure. This was agreed to; but when he came to the Houſe, ſome Days after, to give her more Medicines, he found this Woman, who was ſo ſubmiſſive and penitent before the Committee, more inſolent than ever. Upon which he applied at two ſubſequent Committees to have Juſtice done to his Character, and to the Medicine; but as the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen were not there who ſat at the firſt Committee, he could obtain no Satisfaction, and therefore left the Houſe.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Mary Somers</hi> was cured, appeared by her Examination before the Committee above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; but ſhe is now in the Houſe, and may be examined again and again. And that <hi>Suſannah</hi> or <hi>Suckey Pott</hi> (for they ſay ſhe was ſo chriſtened) and <hi>Elizabeth Morris,</hi> were cured, will appear by the following Certificates.</p>

                  <head>Mrs. Baker's Atteſtation.</head>
                  <p>ON <hi>Saturday</hi> the 2d of <hi>July,</hi> 1763, I went to <hi>Burlington</hi> School to enquire after ſome Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who, in a Pamphlet lately publiſhed on the Evil, were ſaid to be cured of that Diſorder. Here I ſaw one of the Miſtreſſes, who ſaid there had been no Children cured there. Upon this I aſked, if I could ſee any of the Children who had taken the Medicine? After ſome Time and Heſitation, two of them were called, and I aſked one of them, whoſe Name I find is <hi>Mary Somers,</hi> if ſhe had taken the Alterative and purging Pills for the Evil? She ſaid ſhe had. I then aſked her, if ſhe had taken any other Medicine during that Time, or ſince? She ſaid ſhe had not, and declared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her Miſtreſs ſhe was perfectly well, and that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0009901000:28"/>ſhe had been the worſt of them all. Upon which the Miſtreſs ſeemed greatly confounded, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe herſelf, ſaid the Girl had never told her ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. I replied, that a Cure of this Sort ought not to be concealed, and that I thought it a very cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Action of the Gentlemen concerned in the Medicine to Cure the Children of ſuch a terrible Diſorder. In anſwer to which ſhe ſaid, there were proper Perſons to give the Children Medicines, and that they wanted no Charity, nor deſired any Body to trouble themſelves about them. She far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaid, that ſeveral Perſons had been there to enquire concerning the Cure of the Children, and that ſhe had given them their Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>After this, by the deſire of ſome Gentlemen concerned in the Charity, I attended at one of the Committees, held at the Houſe, which I think was on the 21ſt of the ſame Month, and this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair was enquired into; <hi>Mary Somers,</hi> who was then examined, was perfectly cured, and it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared that two others had alſo been cured, and had left the Houſe; for a Surgeon, who attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, declared before the Committee, that he had examined them before they took the Medicine and ſince, and that before they took the Medicine they had the Evil, and now they were well. The Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who had denied the Truth to me, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved ſo impertinently, was alſo called, and charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it. At firſt ſhe equivocated, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards acknowledged that ſhe did ſay none of the Children were cured, and that ſhe was ſorry for what ſhe had ſaid, and aſked Pardon. Upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſked who put her upon giving ſuch Anſwers? She ſaid, that a tall Gentleman had been there, and talked to her about it; but ſhe did not know his Name.</p>

            <p>Now, if there were no ſuch Things in the World as Pride, Envy and Avarice, it would be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to account for this Sort of Behaviour; or to aſſign any Reaſon why a Man, who had given up his Time, his Trouble, and his Medicines to Cure a Parcel of poor Children, of a Diſorder general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accounted Incurable, ſhould <hi>at laſt</hi> be inſulted for his Pains; but theſe, and a few other Qualities which are often harboured in the human Breaſt, will help to unfold the Miſtery.
