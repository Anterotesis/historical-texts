            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

(on which Day a Sermon in Defence of the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creed was preach'd by Mr. <hi>Hughes</hi> of <hi>Jeſus</hi>--College, at St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s;) I was ſummon'd by Mr. <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> Deputy-Beadle, to appear before the Vice-Chancellor the next Day, at Three a Clock in the Afternoon. Accordingly, I was that Day (about Four a Clock) conducted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Upper-Room of the Vice-Chancellor's Lodge; and appeared before Dr. <hi>Roderick,</hi> Provoſt of <hi>King</hi>'s-College, the Vice-Chancellor; Sir <hi>John Ellis,</hi> Knight, Maſter of <hi>Caius</hi>-College; Dr. <hi>James,</hi> Maſter of <hi>Queen</hi>'s, <hi>Regius</hi> Profeſſor of Divinity; Dr. <hi>Blithe,</hi> Maſter of <hi>Clare</hi>-Hall; Dr. <hi>Balderſton,</hi> Maſter of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel;</hi> Dr. <hi>Covel,</hi> Maſter of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s; Dr. <hi>Richard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> Maſter of <hi>Peter-Houſe;</hi> Dr. <hi>Aſhton,</hi> Maſter of <hi>Jeſus;</hi> Dr. <hi>Fiſher,</hi> Maſter of <hi>Sidney;</hi> and Dr. <hi>Lany,</hi> Maſter of <hi>Pembroke:</hi> The Univerſity-Regiſter, Mr. <hi>Grove</hi> of St. <hi>John</hi>'s, being there alſo.

tho' newly come to Town, never appear'd with the Heads at any of their Meetings about me; but, <hi>publickly at leaſt,</hi> kept himſelf wholly unconcern'd in the Matter.</p>
            <p>I came to the Vice-Chancellor's Lodge with a Friend, whoſe Preſence and Aſſiſtance I deſir'd. But he was not permitted to go up Stairs: So I was all alone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Judges. I was then immediately ſhewed a Book by Mr. Vice-Chancellor, and ask'd whether I would look upon it, and own it to be mine? Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that it was the <hi>Sermons and Eſſays upon ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Subjects,</hi> I reply'd, that I would not anſwer any ſuch Queſtions; nor would I ſo much as look upon the Book: Affirming, that all which I had to ſay, was in a written Paper in my Hands. Neither would I make any other Anſwer; tho' then, and all along, many enſnaring Queſtions were put to me. But when I ſtill perſiſted in the ſame Anſwers, the Vice-Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, who (with the reſt) ſeem'd much ſurpriz'd at this cautious Conduct of mine, was oblig'd to call for other Evidence. Accordingly Mr. <hi>Crownfield,</hi> our Printer, (who had been terrify'd, and threaten'd with being turn'd out of his Place by ſome of the Heads, for barely permitting his Boy to carry the <hi>Propoſals</hi> for Printing my <hi>Primitive Chriſtianity Reviv'd</hi> to them) was ſent for, and depos'd ſo much as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to <hi>probable Evidence,</hi> That I had ſent the ſmall <hi>Eſſay upon the Epiſtles of</hi> Ignatius, to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpers'd in <hi>Cambridge;</hi> and that I had ſent a Letter to the Vice-Chancellor, [which is ſet down <hi>p.</hi> 84, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of my <hi>Hiſtorical Preface</hi>:] and to <hi>plain Proof,</hi> That I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd his Boy might carry the fore-mention'd <hi>Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals</hi> to the ſeveral Heads of Colleges the <hi>Tueſday</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; but could ſay nothing to the <hi>Sermons and Eſſays on ſeveral Subjects.</hi> The <hi>Regius</hi> Profeſſor particularly wonder'd that I would not clear Mr. <hi>Crownfield,</hi> by owning the ſending the Propoſals; and intimated, That he ſuppos'd the Vice-Chancellor would alſo have
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0817000300:4"/>
an Order from the Chancery, to oblige Mr. <hi>Benjamin Tooke</hi> the Bookſeller to come from <hi>London,</hi> to prove the <hi>Sermons and Eſſays</hi> upon me, and to inform them how they came to <hi>Cambridge.</hi> I ſaid that it was not yet Time to ſay all I intended: But that when I made my proper Anſwer, it would be Time enough to think of ſuch Things. That I had been accuſtom'd to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Arguments, and Teſtimonies, but not to Law: So I had taken Advice as to my Anſwers, and obſerv'd the ſame Advice all along: Which he own'd it was reaſonable for me to do, as one that he believ'd had never before been us'd to ſuch legal Proceedings. He alſo took notice of an Expreſſion of mine in my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Vice-Chancellor, before-mention'd, as if I were apprehenſive of ſomewhat like <hi>Perſecution</hi> that might befal me: And he added, that he durſt ſay, <hi>No Body there had any Intention to perſecute me.</hi> About this Time it was that the Depoſitions of Mr. <hi>Hughes</hi> and Mr. <hi>Townſend</hi> of <hi>Jeſus;</hi> of Mr. <hi>Amyas</hi> and Mr. <hi>Macro</hi> of <hi>Caius;</hi> and of Mr. <hi>Thackham</hi> of <hi>King</hi>'s; (which were in Part, if not wholly obtain'd by the Vice-Chancellor's Procurement, not by the voluntary Appearance of the Parties themſelves) were openly read to me, as they here follow, <hi>Verba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim.</hi>

Preface.

            <p>Some Time after theſe Depoſitions were read, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to know when it was a proper Time to give in my Anſwer: Which when it was intimated, I publickly read this Paper, and delivered it in as follows, <hi>Verba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim.</hi>

            <p>But to go on with my Narrative.</p>
            <p>After I had deliver'd my Paper, deſiring Copies of the Statute, and of the Depoſitions, and competent Time for my Anſwer; the former Parts were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily granted me, but the Third much debated. I deſired ſix Weeks Time, as not too long in a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſuch great Importance; and gave particular Reaſons for it. I alſo aſſured them, that the main of that Anſwer would not be what they ſo much, and often, and earneſtly fear'd and caution'd againſt, the producing my Original Teſtimonies in way of Juſtification of my Opinions; but would principally turn on thoſe very Two Heads Mr. Vice-Chancellor propos'd as proper for it; <hi>viz.</hi> The ſhewing that my Doctrines were either not truly and compleatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, or were not ſo contrary to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> as the Vice-Chancellor and ſome others imagin'd. I was anſwer'd, That this Conſiſtory-Court uſed not to allow ſo long Time as thoſe at <hi>Westminster;</hi> and thev were by no means willing to allow any conſiderable Time. However, the Maſter of <hi>Jeſus</hi> was for a competent Time, that I might ſend for my Papers from <hi>London.</hi> And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body hinted, as if a Week was more uſually the Time afforded in this Conſiſtory. The Maſter of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terhouſe,</hi> tho' he did not own the Neceſſity of a very long Time, yet confeſs'd that I muſt have Time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd me for my Anſwer. Accordingly I fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected ſuch Allowance. And when the Maſter of <hi>Peterhouſe</hi> left them, it ſeems, a Week's Time was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for that Anſwer. But all this notwithſtanding, when I was finally call'd in, that Maſter being gone,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0817000300:10"/>
I heard not a Syllable more about it; but was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately order'd to appear again on <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> to receive the main Charge, (of which preſently;) and for other farther Proceedings. And when I once ſpake of going to <hi>London</hi> for Advice or Aſſiſtance, the Maſter of <hi>Emanuel</hi> ſaid, It was fit I ſhould go live elſewhere, and remove from <hi>Cambridge,</hi> ſince I had there perverted ſome already. The Maſters of <hi>Sidney</hi> and <hi>Pembroke</hi> not only ſeem'd to grudge the leaſt Delay for my Anſwer, but would needs tell me what an Anſwer I was to make. I reply'd, that I ſhould not ask their Advice for the making that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, but uſe my own Judgment. Nay, when the Maſter of <hi>Jeſus</hi> plainly own'd the Reaſonableneſs of ſome conſiderable Time for my Anſwer, the Maſter of <hi>Pembroke</hi> ſeem'd very angry at him for it. Yet when I once, with ſome Vehemence, ſaid, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"There has ſomewhat been alledg'd here, which I am ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd to find ſo many Clergymen to ſay;"</q> m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aning their Aſſertion, That the <hi>Three Perſons</hi> collectively taken, were the <hi>One God of the Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and not <hi>God the Father;</hi> contrary to all manner of Sacred and Primitive Doctrine and Language; no Notice was taken of it at all. But to go on with the main Narrative. Upon a Second Summons, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd again on <hi>Wedneſday, Octob.</hi> 25th. But now in a lower Parlour of the ſame Lodge, none being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent but my Judges, as before. Dr. <hi>Covel</hi> and Dr. <hi>Richardſon</hi> being now abſent; and Dr. <hi>Gower,</hi> Maſter of St. <hi>John</hi>'s, the Lady <hi>Margarets</hi>'s Profeſſor, preſent in their Room. When I appear d, expecting the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of Time, not only for my main Anſwer, but for the clearing the Exceptions I had to make to their Evidence and Proceedings; inſtead thereof, I had only the ſore-mentioned Paper of the main Charge given me, and a ſolemn Admonition therewith to leave my Errors, and return to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or elſe on <hi>Monday</hi> they would
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0817000300:11"/>
proceed to execute the Statute upon me. Only I was allowed to read and deliver in what I had prepared as an Anſwer ſo far; or as my Complaints of, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions againſt their Proceedings.

my ſelf honeſtly and inoffenſively both before God and Men, and to diſcharge my ſeveral Duties as a Man, a Chriſtian, a Clergyman, and a Profeſſor of the Mathematicks in this Univerſity; after an uncommon Search after, and Zeal for the pure, ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, uncorrupt Doctrines and Duties of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as they appear in the Sacred Books of the Old and New Teſtament, and in all the moſt Ancient and Primitive Fathers; and yet, as far as poſſible, with a conſtant and regular Compliance with the Rules and Orders of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> after my earneſt Endeavours to recover and retrieve ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Original Sacred Books of our Religion, long loſt, or deſpis'd, or neglected in theſe latter Ages, at leaſt in theſe Weſtern Parts of <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> and after ſuch great Succeſs in thoſe and my other Enquiries, that of all the many Learned Perſons who have perus'd my Papers, not any of them has undertaken to write an Anſwer to them: After all this, I ſay, I cannot but be <hi>ſurpriz'd,</hi> that without ſending for any of thoſe Papers, or at all examining them; and without allowing me any publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference and Diſputation about the Notions contained in them; while every one elſe is permitted, if not encouraged to preach and diſpute againſt me upon all Occaſions, I am forced to ſtand here as an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender, and a Criminal on Account of them. <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus,</hi> tho' ſo timerous as to come to Jeſus by Night only, yet ventured to ſay in the midſt of the Rulers of the <hi>Jews,</hi>

Nor has it, I ſuppoſe, been any where de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied among thoſe that call themſelves Chriſtians, but in the Popiſh Inquiſion it ſelf.

For I dare ſay you are all perſuaded that I am not ſo inſincere or fearful, as to retract or renounce any thing, which, upon full Examination, I am really perſuaded to be either a Truth or a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Chriſtian Religion, out of the Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of what any ſuch Tribunal as this can inflict upon me. Permit me, Mr. Vice-Chancellor, to ſay farther, that this Way of Conference and Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is that very Method which is mark'd out by an Ancient and Famous Precedent, when this very Statute now before you was firſt us'd: I mean the Caſe of Profeſſor <hi>Cartwright,</hi> in the Days of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> whom Archbiſhop <hi>Whitgift,</hi> the then Vice-Chancellor, and the Univerſity, would not proceed againſt till they had invited him to a Conference, and that in Writing, in order to his Conviction: But which he refuſed, and was thereupon cenſur'd and expell'd: As the Authentick Record, a Copy of which is hereunto annex'd, will teſtify. The Caſe is here quite otherwiſe. I am not only willing to accept of any ſuch Invitation, but do here ſolemnly Invite the Univerſity to this Conference and Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Nay, I Demand it, as the Right of the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0817000300:15"/>
Sacred Truths of Chriſtianity, and what this Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Body, cannot either in Equity, or Honour deny, that I be thus heard, and my Papers fairly and fully examin'd, before any farther Proceedings be had in this Matter. And to encourage your Acceptance of this Propoſal, I do ſincerely declare that I will have no regard therein to Victory or Triumph; but will alone ſeek for Truth, and genuine Chriſtianity. For God is my Witneſs, that I am very unwilling to be in the leaſt deceiv'd my ſelf, or to deceive the Church of Chriſt: And that I am always very deſirous of the Opportunity of improving and correcting my Notions and Papers, that ſo the leaſt Syllable of the Truths of Chriſt Jeſus may not receive any Diminution or Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentation by me, when my Papers come to be publiſhed.</p>
                        <p>But then, Mr. Vice-Chancellor, beſides my <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize</hi> at the ſeveral Things above-mentioned, with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to this Procedure, I think I have great Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for <hi>Complaint</hi> on many Accounts alſo. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly I muſt here take the Liberty to <hi>complain,</hi> That Matters have a long while been very unfairly and clancularly manag'd againſt me: That during the laſt Two Years and above half, wherein it has been known that I have been upon thoſe Enquires whence the preſent Accuſation is taken, No Vice-Chancellor, no publick Profeſſor, not any one of thoſe in Authority here, which are known to be the moſt diſatisfy'd, have ever ſent for me and my Papers, and diſcourſed me free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or given me a friendly Caution about them. I think I have alſo Reaſon to complain, that ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and ſuch improper Ways have been try'd to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſome Cenſure upon me; as if I were ſuch a publick Enemy, that all the Methods that could be thought of were to be uſed for my Deſtruction. Once a <hi>Grace</hi> of the Senate Houſe was to be procur'd for my Expulſion, without my being heard at all. When
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0817000300:16"/>
that did not do, I have, as I hear, been threaten'd with the Eccleſiaſtical Court, and with the Aſſizes. Then Advice was taken, whether I could not with ſafety be legally convicted of Hereſy, and ſo be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd by Mr. <hi>Lucas</hi>'s Statutes. And now a remote Univerſity Statute, not at all in its main and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Deſign, as I conceive, reaching my Caſe; and ſuch an one as, if ſtrain'd to the ſame Rigor as to others, might expel, I believe, much the greateſt part of the Univerſity, is at laſt produc'd againſt me. This Statute is <hi>De Concionibus,</hi> concerning publick Sermons, and ſuch like Publick Acts and Lectures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Univerſity. How can this Statute poſſibly reach me? ſince I never had the Honour to preach before the Univerſity in my Life. I never kept any Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Act, or oppos'd in the Divinity Schools, ſince I was admitted. My Publick Lectures have been all Mathematical; and being moſt of them printed, will ſhew how remote they have been from any things of this Nature. This Statute muſt therefore be ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beyond all reaſonable Conſtruction e're it can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect me. I have indeed formerly had an Afternoon Lecture in the Town of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> by the Biſhop's ſole Permiſſion, and upon his ſole Salary. But 'tis the Opinion of the beſt Judges, that whatever I ſaid there, can no way be us'd to my Prejudice in this Place. The Pariſh Churches, at leaſt ordinarily, when none but the Inhabitants are ſuppos'd to be preſent, being certainly under no other Cognizance than of the Right Reverend the Lord Biſhop of the Dioceſe. And accordingly, One Perſon of this Univerſity about a Year and a half ago did once make ſome Complaint to our Dioceſan, for what happen'd in one of thoſe Churches; who thereupon appointed us to appear before him at a certain Hour the next day: I came at the Hour appointed, and ſtay'd about an Hour, expecting my Accuſer; but he did not come till the Biſhop and my ſelf were both gone: Which hindred
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0817000300:17"/>
any farther Proceedings. And ſure I cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd both before the Biſhop, and before this Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory for the ſame pretended Offences, in the ſame Pariſh Church. I do therefore inſiſt upon it, that the true Extent of this Statute may be fully conſider'd before any thing be done againſt me by virtue of it. As alſo I deſire it may be conſider'd, whether Words pretended to be ſpoken ſo long ago; eſpecially where the Time is either not ſpecify'd at all, or not nearer than that of a whole Year's ſpace, can be admitted againſt me: And whether Books publiſhed at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and private Diſcourſes elſewhere, can come within the reach of this Statute; where the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces puniſhable by it muſt be committed not only <hi>infra Univerſitatem noſtram,</hi> in a Place belonging to the Univerſity, but muſt be done <hi>publicè docendo, tractan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, vel defendendo,</hi> in publick and ſolemn Sermons, Lectures, or Diſputations before the ſame Univerſity. I do alſo complain, that the Chancellor of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity has not, as I believe, been acquainted with this Matter; when the Statute ſays all the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings upon it are to be <hi>Cancellarii juſſa.</hi> And tho' in ordinary Affairs the Vice-Chancellor may have Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity enough to act for the Chancellor, and may well enough exerciſe that Authority, yet certainly in a Caſe of ſo uncommon a Nature, and of ſuch mighty Conſequence; [the like whereto I will be bold to ſay never before came into this Conſiſtory;] it was but reaſonable that the Chancellor himſelf ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, and his Directions receiv'd, before any Proceedings ſhould have been begun by the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. I do alſo complain that the Accuſations or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions againſt me relate generally to Things long ſince paſt and gone, without the pretence of any new Offences; unleſs the Civility of ſending ſome inoffenſive Propoſals to any of you can be eſteem'd of that Nature. I hope I may well call them <hi>inof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive,</hi> ſince they plainly are ſuch, and will appear
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0817000300:18"/>
ſuch to every Chriſtian Reader that peruſes them. I have alſo, I think, great Reaſon to complain that I am, as it were, by this Procedure prevented in my honeſt Deſign, recommended to me by a very learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and pious Prelate of our own Church, and readily agreed to by me, of laying all my Papers before the Convocation, which is almoſt now ready to fit, for their Conſideration and Correction. Sure the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity will never ſuppoſe, or believe, that the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation will cenſure without Examination; nor is the Univerſity to prejudge a Cauſe, which moſt properly belongs to the Cognizance and Judgment of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation. I do alſo complain, that I have been ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding privately conven'd, and particularly interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated; and not in the Conſiſtory, before the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; where all that deſir'd might have been preſent, and I might have had ſuch Aſſiſtance as Law and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity do allow. As if ſome Men's Hopes of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing me, aroſe rather from the Proſpect of the Terror I ſhould be under in ſuch Circumſtances, and the unwary Anſwers I ſhould thereupon make, than from the Strength of the Evidence, and the Noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of the Offences I could be prov'd to be guilty of. I do, laſtly, complain, that as I am inform'd, ſuch a ſort of Determination has been lately made about the Senſe of that Statute whereby I am charg d, as might beſt reach my Caſe, before I have been any way heard, or any legal Advice has been taken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the true Extent and Meaning of it; contrary, I think, to the plain Rules of Juſtice and Equity in ſuch a Caſe.</p>
                        <p>Theſe, Mr. Vice Chancellor, are the principal Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of that <hi>Surprize</hi> and <hi>Complaint</hi> which I at firſt mention'd. Not that they all directly affect your ſelves; from whom I am willing to hope for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Fairneſs, Juſtice and Equity; but becauſe they all belong to ſome Members of this Univerſity. And, for a Concluſion, give me leave to ſay, that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0817000300:19"/>
theſe Matters are of ſuch mighty Conſequence, they are become ſo very publick, and the Fairneſs and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of a ſolemn Examination are ſo generally own'd by the Archbiſhops and Biſhops, and the reſt of thoſe learned Men of all Parties who have peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed my Papers, that if the Proceeding in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter here be with Haſte, Precipitation, and Severity, thoſe that act in it, will not only wound their own Conſciences, commit an heinous Offence againſt God, and thereby expoſe themſelves to ſevere Puniſhment from his Hand; but there will hereby be laid a laſting, an indelible Blot and Reproach upon the Univerſity; as undertaking raſhly and violently to puniſh me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it appears that I am at all guilty of any Offence to deſerve that Puniſhment: While at the ſame time I ſhall not only have the Comfort of an innocent Conſcience for my Support, but ſhall alſo have the Expectation of ſpeedy Relief and Redreſs from the known Juſtice and Equity of thoſe who repreſent Her Sacred Majeſty in Her Courts of Judicature; to which, in that Caſe, I ſhall be obliged immediately to appeal.</p>
                        <p>Saving therefore to my ſelf the Liberty of making any other future Exceptions to theſe Proceedings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, The principal ones that I make at preſent are theſe: I ſay,</p>
                        <p n="1">(1.) That I am charged with breaking that 45th Statute, which I have been uncapable of breaking, becauſe it only concerns ſuch Publick Univerſity-Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes as I have never perform'd.</p>
                        <p n="2">(2.) That the Place where moſt of the Words are pretended to have been ſpoken, St. <hi>Clement</hi>'s Church, is utterly out of the Juriſdiction of the Univerſity, and ſo no ways within this Statute.</p>
                        <p n="3">(3.) That the want of the Specification of the Time, or the too looſe Specification of it, renders moſt of the Depoſitions of no Value.</p>
                        <p n="4">
                           <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0817000300:20"/>
(4.) That Words charged at ſo great a Diſtance of Time, cannot be ſworn to ſo particularly as is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to affect me.</p>
                        <p n="5">(5.) That Words ſpoken in private Converſation, or at a Coffee-Houſe, or [written] in a private Letter, can no way be within this Statute.</p>
                        <p n="6">(6.) That no Books printed and publiſhed at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> can be within this Statute.</p>
                        <p n="7">(7.) That I ought to have been conven'd publickly in the Conſiſtory, and Evidence fairly there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced againſt me in an open Court; and not privately in a Chamber been ask'd many enſnaring Queſtions, with the Excluſion of even a ſingle Friend, who was willing to have been there to aſſiſt and direct me.</p>
                        <p n="8">(8.) That any prior Determination of the Senſe of this Statute, before I have had Council allowed me, or legal Advice taken about its true Extent and Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is of no Force at all againſt me.</p>
                        <p>And I deſire and demand that I may have Time gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me, and Council allow'd me to argue the Validity of theſe Exceptions.</p>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0817000300:21"/>
Mr. Doctor <hi>Whitgift,</hi> who offered, That if the ſaid Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> would ſet down his Aſſertions in Writing, and his Reaſons unto them, he would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the ſame in Writing alſo; the which Maſter <hi>Cartwright</hi> refus'd to do. Further, the ſaid Dr. <hi>Whitgift</hi> at ſuch Time as Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> was depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of his Lecture, did in our Preſence ask the ſaid Mr. <hi>Cartwright,</hi> whether he had both publickly, and privately divers Times offer'd the ſame Conference unto him, by writing, or not: To which Mr. <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright</hi> anſwered, That he had been ſo offered, and that he refuſed the ſame. Moreover the ſaid Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> did never offer any Diſputation but upon theſe Conditions: <hi>viz.</hi> That he might know who ſhould be his Adverſaries, and who ſhould be his Judges; meaning, ſuch Judges as he himſelf could beſt like of. Neither was this Kind of Diſputation deny'd unto him, but only he was required to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Licenſe of the Queen's Majeſty or the Council, becauſe his Aſſertions be repugnant to the State of the Commonwealth, which may not be called into Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by publick Diſputation without Licenſe of the Prince or his Highneſs's Council.</p>

            <p>When I had read and delivered in this Second Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, I expected ſome Anſwer thereto, and ſome legal Notice to have been taken of it. But all to no Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: The Torrent was too ſtrong to be ſtopp'd by any ſuch Methods. The Vice-Chancellor pretended,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0817000300:22"/>
(without the leaſt Regard to what I had ſaid,) that they were agreed that the Poſitions charged upon me were both plainly contrary to the Churches Doctrine; and were ſufficiently prov'd againſt me; and ſo they would proceed. I thereupon boldly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to know, whether every one there preſent, (for they were then the leaſt Number poſſible that could act in ſuch a Caſe) had entirely agreed to both theſe Propoſitions? And particularly ask'd Sir <hi>John Ellis</hi>'s Opinion. He anſwer'd, that he agreed that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per deliver'd to me contain'd Doctrines contrary to thoſe of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> But whether they had ſufficiently prov'd that thoſe Doctrines were chargeable upon me, he did not determine, but left that to others. Yet did they proceed as if Sir <hi>John</hi> had equally agreed to both thoſe Particulars; which 'tis certain he did not, and that he declared he did not: tho' he had hardly leave given him to finiſh that his Declaration. I was then very gravely and ſolemnly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed again by the Vice-Chancellor to leave my Errors, and return to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or elſe he let me know, that on <hi>Monday</hi> at Three a Clock, they would proceed to execute the Statute againſt me; without the leaſt Intimation of allowing me ſo much as one Hours Time to anſwer the Charge, which not till now was properly delivered to me. As to my Deſire of Conference and fair Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Vice-Chancellor ſaid, that the <hi>Regius</hi> Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor might take me to his Lodgings and diſcourſe with me if he pleaſed; to which no Anſwer was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned by any Body. The Lady <hi>Margaret</hi>'s Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor alſo once upbraided me, as if I deny'd Things there which elſewhere I aſſerted; which he look'd on as no Argument of that Sincerity I pretended to. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this I openly deſir'd not to be miſunderſtood, but that I only requir'd Legal Proof for what was alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt me, without being enſnared by their Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, and without affirming or denying any Thing
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0817000300:23"/>
my ſelf about them. Whereupon he ſaid no more of that Matter. And the <hi>Regius</hi> Profeſſor, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood me ſo all along, did me the Juſtice to put that Matter right, and to explain in what Senſe he ſuppos'd I did not now own or aſſert any of the Things charged upon me. To which I fully aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and ſo that Imputation came to nothing. The <hi>Margaret</hi> Profeſſor farther told me, when I inſiſted on <hi>Examination</hi> before <hi>Cenſure,</hi> that I knew well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, that when Hereticks aroſe, it was not uſual to argue with them, but to quote ſome Canon of a Council which condemned them, and ſo to anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matize them immediately. I ſaid to him; But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that what I ſaid about the Apoſtolical Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould at laſt prove to be true? He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, If ſo, he would come and heartily beg my Pardon. The Maſter of <hi>Jeſus</hi> thought Time might be allowed me for my Anſwer. But ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and vehement was the Vice-Chancellor in his Proceedings, that all ſuch Motions came to nothing. The ſame Maſter of <hi>Jeſus</hi> alſo ask'd me why I cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Conſtitutions <hi>The Moſt Sacred Book</hi> of the New Teſtament? I anſwered, becauſe they really were ſo, and were ſo eſteemed in the firſt Ages. I alſo ſaid to him, that they would repent their Severity to me: And that if he had been by, when Dr. <hi>Smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge</hi> (who had read my Papers, and of whom I believed he had a very good Opinion) and my ſelf lately diſcourſed upon theſe Matters, he would ſcarce have been againſt their Examination before they cenſured me on Account of them. Upon which he owned that he had himſelf alſo ſeen ſome of my Papers: Which I ſuppoſe was ſome Time ago, when Mr. <hi>Hughes,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Townſend</hi> of the ſame College had the Peruſal of them: I mean thoſe which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Trinity and Incarnation only. But find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Maſter of <hi>Sidney</hi> exceeding hot againſt me,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0817000300:24"/>
I ſaid to him, that I believed he had not ſtudied theſe Matters. He grew paſſionate, and ſaid, <hi>That was my Impudence.</hi> I ſaid, I meant particularly as to the Conſtitutions. He reply'd, that he had read them; but however that he knew my Aſſertions were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to thoſe of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> Which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he all along confin'd himſelf to: inſomuch that when on <hi>Monday</hi> the Vicechancellor had ſaid, with ſome Moderation, that my Tenets were <hi>Erroneous</hi> and <hi>contrary to the Churches Doctrine,</hi> and that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ought to retract them; and I had reply'd, Let them be but once proved to be <hi>Erroneous,</hi> and I was moſt ready to retract them; the Maſter of <hi>Sidney,</hi> at whoſe Elbow I ſtood, told me, they did not mean <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous,</hi> but <hi>contrary to the Doctrine of the Church.</hi> Nay, when I ſaid to them, Will you condemn or cenſure while none either <hi>will,</hi> or <hi>dare</hi> anſwer me? Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body that was offended at that laſt Word, reply'd, <hi>dare?</hi> But without any farther Addition. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed great Care was all along taken that the Truth or Falſhood of my Doctrines ſhould be wholly wav'd, and all ſet upon their Contrariety to thoſe of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> without ſo much as a Pretence that any body would anſwer the Arguments and Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonies which I had to produce for them. It was once urged, that my affirming the <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> and <hi>Doctrine of the Apoſtles</hi> to be Sacred Books of the New Teſtament, was contrary to the Sixth Article of our Church. I deſir'd that Article might be read: which was done by the Maſter of <hi>Pembroke.</hi> I ſaid there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, 'Tis plain that this Article owns the preſent Sacred Books, being all the Church then knew; and that had they known of more, they would have ſet them down alſo: but that 'tis not affirmed in that Article that there are no other than thoſe, and ſo my Aſſertion is not contrary thereto. Yet did this paſs as a clear Contradiction to it. And no wonder; when in the Paper given me from the Vicechancellor. the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0817000300:25"/>
very <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed is it ſelf quoted as condemning my calling God the Farher the <hi>One God of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Religion,</hi> while yet that Creed begins with a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and ſolemn Affirmation of it; <hi>I believe in One God the Father, Almighty.</hi> After all, when the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chancellor perceived that I began to draw ſome of the Heads into Arguing and Reaſoning about theſe Matters, he took one of the Candles himſelf, and ſaying a few things to me about a Recantation, which I declar'd I could not make with a ſafe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, he ſaid, He pitied me, and then he fairly conducted me out of the Lodge. And ſo I took my leave: having before hinted to them, that I did not deſign to wait on them any more about theſe Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but to leave them to do as they pleaſed therein. Which Reſolution I kept till <hi>Monday</hi> accordingly. For when on <hi>Sunday</hi> I was again ſummon'd by Mr. <hi>Atwood,</hi> to appear the next Day at three a Clock, I made this Anſwer, That I ſaw no occaſion for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing any more. However, for ſome Reaſons, I afterward alter'd my Mind, and came, and appeared again on <hi>Monday,</hi> in a lower Room of the ſame Lodge, before the Heads, who were now Twelve in Number, whoſe Names will be ſet down preſently. And upon Mr. Vicechancellor's enquiring of me, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I came diſpoſed to make a Retractation of thoſe my Errors concerning which he had before Admoniſh'd me? Upon Leave given, I read the following Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as my Anſwer; and deliver'd it in as follows, <hi>verbatim.</hi>

                        <p>I did not think to have appeared to Day at all, becauſe I underſtood that this Meeting was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only for my Retractation; for which I have neither had any conſiderable Time, nor any proper Motives for Conviction afforded me; and ſo to be ſure I cannot be diſpoſed for any ſuch thing. Nay, indeed
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0817000300:26"/>
I cannot allow that any Doctrines contrary to thoſe of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and within your Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance by the 45th Statute, have been Legally proved upon me. However, I have thought fit to appear ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Summons giuen me Yeſterday. What I have at preſent to alledge againſt theſe Proceedings, beſides my former Exceptions, is, That the <hi>Advice for the Study of Divinity</hi> quoted againſt me, was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten about <hi>February</hi> 1707/8, and that the Depoſitions as to what I ſaid in St. <hi>Clement</hi>'s Church, belong to the Year 1708, and that if I committed any Offences in either Caſe, they are fully and compleatly forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the laſt Act of Her Majeſty's moſt Gracious, General, and Free Pardon: Which therefore I do here Plead, in Bar to all farther Proceedings. And I do think the Moleſtation already given me, is Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal by that Act. As to Part of Mr. <hi>Thackham</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, which may ſeem to be a little later than that Act, it is not at all charged upon me in the Paper deliver'd to me as the whole Charge againſt me; and ſo is of no force at all. And as to the remaining Charges, that from the other Part of Mr. <hi>Thackham</hi>'s Depoſition, is only that I would not uſe a Doxology which our Church, I think, never uſes, nor enjoins; and which ſtands on the alone Footing of Dr. <hi>Brady</hi> and Mr. <hi>Tate,</hi> or ſuch-like private Perſons. And the other, concerning the ſtiling God the Father the <hi>One and Only God,</hi> 'tis ſo expreſly the Language of our Church in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, and in the Collect for the 18th <hi>Sunday</hi> after <hi>Trinity,</hi> that I am ſurprized at its being in this manner alledged againſt me. But ſince you have given no time for the Examination of my Legal Exceptions, nor for my own Anſwer, I publickly Proteſt againſt your Proceedings; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that my Proteſtation may be entred into the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of the Univerſity.</p>

            <p>Now the Reader is here to Obſerve, that ſince all the Depoſitions concerning St. <hi>Clement</hi>'s Church are here given up, as being long before the 19<hi>th</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril,</hi> 1709. the Date for the Act of Pardon: Since the Paſſages quoted out of the <hi>Advice for the Study of Divinity,</hi> were written ſtill earlier; and there is no Pretence of the leaſt Evidence that I any way pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd it in <hi>Cambridge;</hi> and ſince one Part of Mr. <hi>Thackham</hi>'s Evidence is made no uſe of at all in this Matter, 'Tis plain that this Baniſhment or Expulſion is ſolely grounded on theſe Three Things. (1.) My affirming with our Saviour, St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the <hi>Nicene,</hi> and all the Original Creeds, and moſt ancient Fathers, that the <hi>One and Only God of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, is God the Father,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John XVII. 3. 1 Cor. VIII. 6.</note> (2.) My Aſſerting an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Matter of Fact, that the Original Chriſtian Doxology was not the Common One, but <hi>Glory be to the Father, through the Son,</hi> or, <hi>and the Son, in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt,</hi> (3.) My <hi>Propoſing</hi> to prove that the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions</hi> and <hi>Doctrine of the Apoſtles,</hi> are Sacred Books of the New Teſtament; and the former of them, the <hi>moſt Sacred of the Canonical Books:</hi> Which in
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0817000300:29"/>
time will appear to be undoubtedly true alſo. And all this is done without the leaſt Offer at any Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation into the Truth or Falſhood of the ſame Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſo without knowing whether the whole Proceeding be not directly <hi>Fighting againſt God,</hi> and <hi>Oppoſing and Perſecuting the Goſpel and Religion of Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> And if it prove ſo at laſt, the Authors had need to think of that timely Repentance and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, which they requir'd at my Hands: Leſt their preſent Authority, and Pretence of an Univerſity Statute, ſhould be too little to excuſe them at the Day of Judgment.</p>
            <p>But who ſhould be the ſecret Movers, or what ſhould be the ſecret Reaſons why, after ſo long a Forbearance, the Vicechancellor and the Heads ſhould all on a ſudden, in this violent manner, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to Cenſure and Expel me, is too deep a Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for me authentickly to dive into; and ſo I muſt leave it to another Tribunal. For certainly it could not be the Vicechancellor's own Motion originally; ſince he had forborn me all along, and was now in a manner out of his Office, and was ever remarkable for Caution and Deliberation in all his Proceedings: Eſpecially when I ſuppoſe that neither himſelf, nor indeed the Major Part of his Aſſeſſors, do at all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have particularly Examin'd the Matters themſelves, concerning which they took upon them to be Judges; but went plainly at Random, by their own Interpretation of an Old Statute, to Perſecute an Innocent Perſon for the ſake of what they raſhly call <hi>Orthodoxy.</hi> I venture to ſtile my ſelf an <hi>Innocent</hi> Perſon, notwithſtanding this their Sentence againſt me; becauſe I believe that every one of my Judges acquits me in his own Conſcience, from any baſe or ſiniſter Deſign; and is ſatisfy'd, that I did no other than what is certainly every Chriſtian's Duty; <hi>viz.</hi> The Declaring plainly what, upon the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Examination, I was ſatisfy'd were the certain
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0817000300:30"/>
Truths and Duties of Chriſtianity: For which yet, without ſuch Examination, they have now ventur'd to Cenſure and Expel me. Which things I own I durſt not have had a Hand in, in any like Caſe, for any Conſideration whatſoever. But tho' they were my Judges, I am not theirs; <hi>To their own Maſter they muſt ſtand or fall.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. XIV. 4.</note> And therefore I can only commit my Cauſe to God, the juſt Judge of all the World, and leave it in his righteous Hands to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine between us. However, I do heartily wiſh and hope, that as ſoon as my Papers are publiſh'd, they will ſtill ſeriouſly conſider them, and ſoberly recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this whole Matter; and that their ſineere Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Retractation will prevent the Danger of any future Puniſhment from God upon them, from that God <hi>who deſireth not the Death of a Sinner, but his Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus ended this Univerſity Proſecution and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of me; at leaſt, this is all that has been done till the Date of theſe Papers; without the leaſt regard to Mr. <hi>Lucas</hi>'s Statutes, or to my Mathematick Profeſſorſhip depending thereon: And ſo without the direct affecting me as Mr. <hi>Lucas</hi>'s Profeſſor: How plainly ſoever they have depriv'd me of that Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip of the Univerſity, which till now, either by Right or by Courteſy, I was entitled to. So I ſhall go on no farther with this Narration. I ſay in the main, affecting me as Mr. <hi>Lucas</hi>'s Profeſſor only, meaning thereby that I claim ſtill, notwithſtanding this Expulſion or Baniſhment, to be Profeſſor of the Mathematicks of Mr. <hi>Lucas</hi>'s Foundation; and have accordingly a juſt Right to the Profits thereof, upon my doing that Duty by a Deputy, (as my Statutes direct on a long Abſence) which I cannot ſo well do in Perſon. Otherwiſe, this Expulſion muſt <hi>affect me</hi> ſenſibly enough, in reſpect of my Maintenance: Since the Allowance to a Deputy, and the Loſs of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0817000300:31"/>
the Advantages formerly ariſing from the Courſes of Experiments, to ſay nothing of thoſe from Teaching privately in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and the Charges and Loſſes of a Removal, cannot well be eſtimated under 50 <hi>l.</hi> a Year; which is a great Deduction out of a ſmall Subſiſtence. Nay, there want not thoſe who would ſtrain this Expulſion from the Univerſity to a Depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as to my Profeſſorſhip, and ſo would deprive me of almoſt all, but what the Charity and Kindneſs of Friends might afford me. Which laſt Method of Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port is alſo by ſome envied, and complained of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand. As if there were no way to ſatisfy their Zeal againſt me, but my ſeeing me and my Family re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to the utmoſt Poverty and Diſtreſs, without a Friend to ſupport and relieve me. But before I conclude, I can hardly avoid ſaying here, that I take the true Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Cauſe of this Severity to be plainly this, That I have written ſeveral <hi>Unanſwerable Books;</hi> which are therefore a terrible Eye-ſore to thoſe who are more concern'd for Modern Orthodoxy, and the pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Power of the Church in Controverſies of Faith, than for the pure and undefil'd Religion of Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. So that when it appear'd, as it has done for a conſiderable time, that none of the Learned could or durſt undertake the Anſwering me, in the way of Reaſon, Argument, and Teſtimony, This Method of Enſnaring me by an Old Statute was thought of. And I venture to ſay this, the rather, becauſe that <hi>Open,</hi> that <hi>Unanſwerable</hi> Challenge I made in the <hi>Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript</hi> of <hi>Ignatius</hi> to the Orthodox, to ſhew but one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Catholick Teſtimony before the Days of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> which affirm'd the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt to be <hi>One God,</hi> or <hi>the One God</hi> of the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; while I promis'd above an hundred Teſtimonies in the ſame time, that God the Father was that <hi>One God,</hi> appears to have been the principal Evidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, and that which was moſt publickly and ſolemnly read to me by the Maſter of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> as
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0817000300:32"/>
the main Article of my Charge; and for which chiefly, I am Cenſur'd and Expell'd. I call it an <hi>Open</hi> and an <hi>Unanſwerable</hi> Challenge: And I here again make it to the whole Body of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> World; and do venture, in the moſt ſolemn manner, to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the Conſciences of all the truly Learned, whether what I have affirm'd on this Head, be not undoubtedly and indiſputably true; and ſo whether I am not Cenſur'd and Expell'd, for owning my ſelf a Chriſtian; nay, I may add, for aſſerting the firſt and moſt Fundamental Doctrine of the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion. I know this repeated Challenge may be moſt eaſily Anſwer'd, in the ſame way that the former was, by a repeated Cenſure: For in any other way, I am ſure it cannot. And if that be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain put in Practice by any ſuch-like Body of this Church, I ſhall only beg one Favour, That thoſe who do it, will deal plainly, and declare that they are not, nor do pretend to the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church of England</hi> only: Or at leaſt that they are juſt ſo far Chriſtians, as the Original Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and Duties of Chriſtianity, are agreeable to thoſe that the XXXIX Articles, the Book of Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and the Common-Prayer-Book contain, but no farther. And then it will be ſome ſmall Satisfaction to have the World know, that as in Popiſh Countries Chriſtianity is generally no farther believ'd and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey'd, than it is agreeable to the Decrees and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> ſo that in this Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, this Reform'd Country, the Caſe is the very ſame. Only with this Difference, that the former pretends to that Infallibility and Dominion over Conſcience, which the latter diſclaims; and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, that the latter is, of the two, in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the moſt plainly unjuſtifiable and inexcuſable. However, as to my being condemn'd for aſſerting what was undeniable and unanſwerable, we have a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Parallel Example in the Sacred Hiſtory. For truly
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0817000300:33"/>
juſt ſo it was in the Caſe of the Protomartyr St. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen,</hi> all due Allowance for the great difference of the Perſons concern'd, and of their Circumſtances, being ſtill made. For when the <hi>Jews</hi> were <hi>not able to reſiſt the Wiſdom and the Spirit by which he ſpake,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. VI. 10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> they drew him into their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory, and Accus'd him there. And when they could not find any fair Reply to the force of his Reaſoning, <hi>They were cut to the Heart, and gnaſhed upon him with their Teeth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">VII. 54.</note> And immediately, without any other Formality of Law, put him to a violent Death. <hi>Then they cried out with a loud Voice, and ſtopped their Ears, and ran upon him with one accord, and caſt him out of the City, and ſtoned him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 57, 58.</note> Whether this Violence towards me, may not end in ſome Attempts not very different from that Caſe, I cannot tell. However, I ſhall venture to uſe his dying Petition for all my Perſecutors; <hi>Lord, lay not this Sin to their Charge.</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 60.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But now, if, after all, the Reader be deſirous to know what ſort of Anſwer I ſhould have made to the preſent Accuſation, had I had competent time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd me, I ſhall plainly tell him in a few Words. I intended therein to have ſtated ſome of my Opinions more fully and clearly than the Evidence produc'd did inform my Judges: And in order to ſhew that then they were not ſo contrary to the Doctrine and Settlement of the Church of <hi>England</hi> as they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, I deſign'd to have inſiſted on ſuch Heads as theſe:</p>
            <p>To have ſhew'd,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That the Proteſtant Religion in general, and the Church of <hi>England</hi> in particular, were begun up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Foot; I mean the Acknowledgment of the Churches Errors, and the Attempt for the Correction
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0817000300:34"/>
oſ the ſame, even with the Hazard of the very Lives themſelves of the Reformers.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) That they are both built on the Foundation of the Holy Scriptures, and moſt Primitive Writers; and always own that all Errors, when diſcover'd, are to be amended by thoſe Original Standards.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) That all Proteſtants, and particularly the Members of this Church, do unanimouſly own the Fallibility of all Councils and Churches; and ſo can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſurpriz'd, if, in Points never yet brought to a fair and publick Examination, ſome Errors be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd ſtill remaining among them.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) That accordingly they have generally found Reaſon to alter their Opinions in ſeveral Doctrines of Conſequence; as our Church has in particular a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Predeſtinarian Points: Nay, they have ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, even our Church her ſelf, found Reaſon to alter ſeveral Practices of Conſequence alſo, ſince the time of the Reformation. And ſo it can ſeem no Wonder, if there ſhould appear Occaſion for the like farther Enquiries and Alterations at this Day.</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) That in the grand Point before us, that of the <hi>Trinity</hi> it ſelf, Our Church ſometimes ſpeaks ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thoſe ancient Notions which I advance; nay, commonly Prays and Practiſes agreeably thereto. So that the Corrections I plead for would rather be the rendring the Church's Language and Practice all of a Piece, than the entire Subverſion and Alteration of the ſame.</p>
            <p n="6">(6.) That the moſt Learned and Impartial, both Papiſts and Proteſtants, and thoſe of our Church in particular, have in this laſt Age been forc'd to leave the vulgar Notions in that Matter, and to come ſtill nearer and nearer to that moſt Primitive and Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Account which I Plead for. As appears by <hi>Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, Grotius, Petavius, Huetius,</hi> Dr. <hi>Cudworth,</hi> Bp. <hi>Pearſon,</hi> Bp. <hi>Bull,</hi> the Bp. of <hi>Glonceſter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Locke,</hi> and many others. So that my Notions are ſo far
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0817000300:35"/>
from New, that they are rather the proper and laſt Reſult of the Enquiries of the Learned ſince the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</p>
            <p n="7">(7.) That ſince I have taken all along the moſt Peaceable, Chriſtian, and Inoffenſive Methods of bringing theſe Important Points to a fair Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and have ſtill laid my Papers before the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of the Church, and the Learned Members of it, for their Conſideration, and the neceſſary Corrections; I have no way offended againſt the Laws of the Land, or even the Statutes of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, as to their main Deſign and Intention; which can never be ſuppos'd to be the Puniſhment of an Honeſt and Innocent Man, when in ſo fair, qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, and open a manner, he Propoſes Sacred Books, Doctrines, and Duties of the Goſpel, to the ſerious Conſideration of the Chriſtian World. However, if the Laws of the Kingdom, or Statutes of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity be ſo Expounded, as to forbid any thing that the Laws of God, and of the Goſpel require, I know which I am to obey. <hi>Whether it be right in the ſight of God, to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye. For we cannot but ſpeak the things which we have ſeen and heard.</hi>

            <p>Theſe were ſuch Heads as I intended more largely and fully to have purſu'd, had I had time allow'd me for my Anſwer. But ſince I was not afforded that, I ſhall wave the farther Proſecution of them: And conclude, not only with the Declaration of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs of my Submiſſion to any Puniſhment, which my Governors in any ſort do Legally inflict upon me; but with my hearty Thanks to the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, which has diſpos'd of me into this Kingdom of Freedom and Liberty, where 'tis not very much that by the Laws can be laid upon me ſor the ſake of my Conſcience: Where therefore with ſmall Legal Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard I can greatly promote the true Religion oſ Chriſt Jeſus.

            <p>When the Univerſity had thus Baniſhed me, they ſeemed ſomewhat at a loſs what they ſhould do far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Nor did they come to any Reſolution for near a Year: In which time I took the beſt Advice I could what was fit for me to do: And according to that Advice, and the Power I had by Mr. <hi>Lucas</hi>'s Statutes, I made a ſufficient Deputy, Mr. <hi>Chriſtopher Huſſey,</hi> Fellow of <hi>Trinity</hi> College, to perform thoſe Duties of my Place in the Univerſity, which my Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment made it not fit for me to do my ſelf. Who yet found the Univerſity in ſuch a Temper, that he
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0817000300:37"/>
never durſt venture actually to Read for me. Dr. <hi>Jenkins</hi> indeed, the New Maſter of St. <hi>John</hi>'s College, was ſo fair, upon my worthy Friend Mr. <hi>Biller</hi>'s Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to him on my account, for his Conſent to my Deputy's Reading for me, that He Declar'd <hi>He would Conſent, if the reſt of the Heads were willing; but not otherwiſe.</hi> Which Anſwer I took very kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from him; as I think I had reaſon to do; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when I compare this civil Treatment of his with that of ſome others. For when I once, during this interval, and I think at the ſame time, ſtayed at <hi>Cambridge</hi> a few Days, and endeavour'd to make the Heads eaſy in the admiſſion of my Deputy, I had a Beadle preſently ſent to me by Dr. <hi>Lany,</hi> Maſter of <hi>Pembroke</hi> Hall, the then Deputy-Vicechancellor, to know <hi>How I durſt venture to appear even in the Town of</hi> Cambridge <hi>under my Baniſhment from the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity?</hi> Nay, I was inform'd, that One of the Heads ſaid, <hi>I might be laid by the Heels for my preſumption.</hi> About a Year after my Baniſhment, Dr. <hi>Lany,</hi> who was again Deputy-Vicechancellor, (for Sir <hi>Nathaniel Lloyd</hi> the Vicechancellor would never himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to it;) Reſolv'd to Proceed to the Election of another Profeſſor, and accordingly put up a Paper upon the Doors of the Publick Schools, appointing a Day for the filling up my Profeſſorſhip: Which was therein Declared to have been vacated, <hi>per bannitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem Gulielmi Whiſton,</hi> as I think the Words were; without any other Deprivation according to Mr. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas</hi>'s Statutes, by which yet alone ſurely I could be Legally Depriv'd thereof. The Perſon who was Choſen was Mr. <hi>Nicolas Sanderſon;</hi> who has ever ſince taken upon him to be the Mathematick Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor in my room. Thus far the Proceedings of the Univerſity were by their own Authority. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not of themſelves able to eject me out of the Poſſeſſion of the Lands and Profits of my Profeſſorſhip, which tho' Legally Veſted in Truſtees,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0817000300:38"/>
were yet in Fact ever under the Management of the Profeſſor himſelf; They ſoon apply'd for aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to the High-Court of <hi>Chancery.</hi> And after the neceſſary Bills and Anſwers were over, the Cauſe it ſelf, and its real Merits ſeem'd at laſt ready for a fair, full, and publick Hearing; for which I juſtly hoped, and had prepared my ſelf accordingly. The Points of Law, as I all along ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, were theſe two; <hi>Firſt,</hi> Whether an haſty <hi>Baniſhment,</hi> by an Old Univerſity Statute, without hearing any Legal Exceptions, or affording any Council or Time for a proper Defence and Anſwer to an Accuſation was <hi>Statutable</hi> and <hi>Legal? Secondly,</hi> Whether ſuch Baniſhment, by an Old Univerſity Statute, if Legal, could <hi>Vacate a Profeſſorſhip</hi> which ſtood on an intirely different Foundation; and where I had the Opinion of Council Learned in the Law, that it could have no ſuch effect? But inſtead of any ſuch Hearing, we ſoon feared, and found that the Lord-Chancellor <hi>Harcourt</hi> would <hi>take it for granted,</hi> without a diſtinct Hearing, that what the Heads of the Univerſity had done, was within their Power to do, and ſo was done Legally. Nay, He was pleaſed, tho' unwillingly, to give the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity <hi>Coſts</hi> againſt me for this very and only Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as he told the Court, that <hi>I had Obliged the Univerſity to bring a Cauſe before him in Judgment, which He could not Hear;</hi> which was all the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Determination I had there, as to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality of my Baniſhment. And as to the other Queſtion, which was to me and my Family of much greater moment, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether ſuch a Baniſhment would vacate my Mathematick Profeſſorſhip or not? It never came to any thing like a Hearing. Only the Lord Chancellor had been pleas'd, on a former Occaſion, to Declare in Court, that <hi>Altho' He could not determine a Cauſe He had not heard, Yet He could not but think it ſtrange that a Profeſſor of an</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:0817000300:39"/>
               <hi>Univerſity ſhould be one that</hi> [by Baniſhment] <hi>was no Member of that Univerſity.</hi> However, Finding ſoon that the Torrent was then too ſtrong againſt me; and being promiſed, if I ſubmitted, great good Offices with the Univerſity, by the beforementioned Dr. <hi>Lany,</hi> who then acted on their behalf, I was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on not only to deliver up my Writings, and to ſuffer the Decree to paſs againſt me; which were done immediately; but alſo to caſt my ſelf wholly upon the Mercy of the Univerſity; which I did a little after by the following Petition; which indeed Dr. <hi>Lany</hi> undertook to preſent and to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port on my behalf.
