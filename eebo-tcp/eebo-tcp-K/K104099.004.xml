            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Not but our author knows, whate'er I ſay,</l>
               <l>That I could find objections to his play.</l>
               <l>This double marriage for her country's good,</l>
               <l>I told him never would be underſtood,</l>
               <l>And that ye all would ſay, 'twas fleſh and blood.</l>
               <l>Had Carthage only been in madam's head,</l>
               <l>Her champion never had been in her — bed:</l>
               <l>For could the ideot think a huſband's name</l>
               <l>Would make him quit his intereſt, friends and fame;</l>
               <l>That he would riſque a kingdom for a wife,</l>
               <l>And act dependent in a place for life?</l>
               <l>Yet when ſtern Cato ſhall condemn the fair,</l>

               <l>Heroes fight coldly when wives give the word.</l>
               <l>She ſhould have kept him keen, employ'd her charms</l>

               <l>She talk'd it well to rouſe him to the fight,</l>
               <l>But like Penelope, when out of ſight,</l>
               <l>All ſhe had done by day, undid by night.</l>
               <l>Is this your wily Carthaginian kind?</l>

               <l>Poyſon's ſo ſhocking—but conſider pray,</l>
               <l>She fear'd the Roman, he the marriage chain;</l>
               <l>All other means to free them both were vain.</l>
               <l>Let none then Maſſiniſſa's conduct blame,</l>
               <l>He firſt his love conſulted, then his fame.</l>

               <l>Forgive a fault ſhe ſtrove ſo well to hide,</l>

                  <l>The weeping Muſes muſt their vigils keep:</l>
                  <l>Still o'er their fav'rite's monument they mourn,</l>

                  <l>Have placed the ſhield and martial trumpet here;</l>
                  <l>The ſhepherd's pipe, and rural honours there:</l>
                  <l>Fancy had deck'd the conſecrated ground,</l>
                  <l>And ſcatter'd never-fading roſes round.</l>
                  <l>And now my bold romantic thought aſpires</l>
                  <l>To hear the echo of celeſtial lyres;</l>

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Divided pair! forgive the wrong,</l>
                  <l>While I with tears your fate rehearſe;</l>
                  <l>I'll join the widow's plaintive ſong,</l>
                  <l>And ſave the lover in my verſe.</l>
