            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>REMARKS On the Opinions of ſome of The moſt celebrated Writers on CROWN LAW, Reſpecting the due Diſtinction between MANSLAUGHTER and MURDER:</p>
            <p>Being an attempt to ſhew</p>
            <p>That the plea of <hi>ſudden Anger</hi> cannot remove the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and guilt of <hi>Murder,</hi> when a <hi>Mortal Wound</hi> is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully given <hi>with a weapon:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the indulgence allowed by the Courts to <hi>voluntary Manſlaughter</hi> in Rencounters, and in ſudden Affrays and Duels, is <hi>indiſcriminate,</hi> and without foundation in Law:</p>
            <p>And that <hi>impunity</hi> in ſuch caſes of <hi>voluntary Manſlaughter</hi> is one of the principal cauſes of the continuance and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent increaſe of the <hi>baſe</hi> and <hi>diſgraceful</hi> practice of Duelling.</p>
            <p>To which are added ſome thoughts on the particular caſe of <hi>the Gentlemen of the Army</hi> when involved in ſuch diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable <hi>private</hi> differences.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>UNIVERSAL BENEVOLENCE, including <hi>gentleneſs, patience</hi> and an unaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected <hi>placability</hi> in our behaviour, even to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe men who injure and affront us, is manifeſtly required of all men, who profeſs the true religion; and yet, unhappily for the Chriſtian world, this moſt obvious doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the <hi>goſpel of peace,</hi> is too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly either miſunderſtood, or elſe abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely rejected, though the <hi>temporal</hi> as well as the <hi>eternal happineſs</hi> of mankind, greatly depends upon a conſcientious and proper obſervation of it. For a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a true Chriſtian without obſerving this doctrine; and yet, ſo generally received is the oppoſite and contradictory doctrine, concerning the neceſſity of revenging every perſonal affront with ſword and piſtol, for
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:1233702100:5"/>the ſake of, what is falſely called, <hi>honour,</hi> that a true Chriſtian is rarely to be met with! Nay, we are fallen into ſuch groſs depravity, that the writer of a late pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication on <hi>"the principles of penal law,"</hi> has ventured to aſſert, (though he is in other reſpects, as I am informed, a ſenſible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious young gentleman) that <q>the judge condemns the duelliſt, whilſt he ſcarcely knows how in his own heart to diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove his behaviour.</q> (p. <hi>224.</hi>) So that one would ſuppoſe Chriſtianity to be almoſt entirely extinct amongſt us, if its principles are ſo little regarded, <hi>even in our courts of juſtice,</hi> where they ought to be held moſt ſacred. My readers, perhaps, will ſtart at ſuch an idea in theſe enlightened days of reformation; but I will even go further, and venture to aſſert, that the Europeans not only ceaſe to be Chriſtians, but will no longer deſerve the name even of
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:1233702100:6"/>
               <hi>men,</hi> if they perſiſt in ſuch a brutal and diabolical contradiction to the moſt indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſible principles of the laws of God and nature: for nothing deſerves to be eſteemed <hi>human</hi> that is <hi>unreaſonable;</hi> and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravity, of which I complain, is not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible with the laws of God, but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely inconſiſtent with <hi>common ſenſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us view the character of the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern man of honour</hi> (falſely ſo called) who thinks it inconſiſtent with his reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to paſs over a perſonal affront with that Chriſtian ſubmiſſion, which the goſpel requires of all men, without exception.</p>
            <p>Such an one perhaps will alledge, that his <hi>honour</hi> obliges him, whenever he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives an affront, to <hi>call out</hi> his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, or <hi>to accept his challenge,</hi> leſt his <hi>courage</hi> ſhould be queſtioned; and therefore in ſuch caſe, the one muſt give, and the other take, what is commonly called
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:1233702100:7"/>
               <hi>gentleman-like Satisfaction.</hi> But let us examine this perverſion of words. The <hi>Satisfaction</hi> to both parties is the riſk both of <hi>body</hi> and <hi>ſoul,</hi> in the perpetration of a moſt <hi>diſhonourable, baſe,</hi> and <hi>cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly felony;</hi> which cannot, therefore, be <hi>gentleman-like,</hi> whatever the <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> of it may be. It is <hi>Felony;</hi> becauſe no man can give, or accept, a challenge, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being guilty of <hi>Wilful Murder,</hi> if he <hi>kills</hi> his antagoniſt; which I hope is proved in the courſe of the following tract.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. It is <hi>diſhonourable,</hi> becauſe it is an open violation of the indiſpenſible prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples enjoined in the two great command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the ſupreme Law, viz. the <hi>love of God,</hi> and the <hi>love of our neighbour:</hi> for, in this reſpect, the offender is upon the ſame foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as culprits for <hi>burglary, theft,</hi> or any other felony; the <q>
                  <hi>not having the fear of God before his eyes,</hi>
               </q> being equally
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:1233702100:8"/>applicable to all of them; and the common law of England eſteems no man qualified to be a member of ſociety, who wants this principle. The act is therefore highly <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable;</hi> and to uſe a ſtill more humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liating term of the ſame import, I muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, Thirdly, that it is alſo <hi>baſe;</hi> becauſe it affords the moſt apparent proof of a <hi>little Soul</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="bottom">
                  <q>Nec Chriſtiani veteres hoc tantum viderunt, ſed et philoſophi, qui dixerunt <hi>puſilli eſſe animi con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumeliam ferre non poſſe,</hi> ut alibi oſtendimus,</q> ſays the learned Grotius, in his 2d book De jure Belli et Pacis, p. 172.</note>; being, <hi>in reality,</hi> a <hi>brutal</hi> revenge; <hi>brutal</hi> becauſe <hi>unreaſonable;</hi> (for how can <hi>Honour</hi> be vindicated or retrieved by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of a <hi>notorious Felony?)</hi> and what is <hi>unreaſonable,</hi> muſt be diſgraceful to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, and therefore is truly <hi>baſe.</hi> And laſtly, it is <hi>cowardly,</hi> (that is, when it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be imputed to <hi>Ignorance</hi> or <hi>Folly</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a man ſubmits to it contrary to the light of his own reaſon, <hi>for fear</hi> his <hi>courage</hi>
               <pb n="viii" facs="tcp:1233702100:9"/>ſhould be called in queſtion; and yet <hi>he has not courage enough</hi> to withſtand the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous prejudices of a depraved world, leſt he ſhould ſuffer ſome temporal inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: and <hi>the ſlaviſh Fear</hi> which he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of theſe (for <hi>cowards</hi> always dread the preſent evil moſt) deprives him of that <hi>reaſonable fear,</hi> which he ought to entertain of God's judgment, becauſe he thinks it at a diſtance, though, he knows, it muſt inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly follow!—I condemn no man in particular; God forbid! I ſpeak of the queſtion only in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral: inveterate prejudices and cuſtoms may perhaps afford ſome excuſe in particular caſes to ſome <hi>Individuals,</hi> who have <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly</hi> yielded thereto: but as <hi>ignorance</hi> is diſgraceful to <hi>humanity,</hi> I ſincerely wiſh that all perſons may enter into as careful an examination of this queſtion as I have done, by which they will not only be enabled to avoid a repetition of their crime, but alſo
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:1233702100:10"/>be prevented from attempting to defend what is paſt, and thereby afford the beſt proof of an ingenuous and honourable heart.</p>
            <p>This abominable practice of duelling, which of late years has increaſed to a moſt alarming degree, may chiefly be attributed (I humbly conceive) to the improper indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence which our Engliſh courts of juſtice, for about two centuries back, have ſhewn to perſons <hi>convicted of killing in ſudden affrays and rencounters,</hi> through a falſe idea of mercy due to human frailty, in caſes of <hi>ſudden provocation</hi> without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the proper diſtinction of thoſe caſes wherein homicide, in <hi>ſudden anger,</hi> is really excuſable by the laws of God, and of this kingdom; and the improper precedents, which have ariſen from this <hi>indiſcriminate and corrupt practice,</hi> have ſo miſled the more modern writers on <hi>Crown Law,</hi> that
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:1233702100:11"/>even the greateſt and moſt reſpectable of them have been unhappily induced to admit doctrines on the ſubject of Manſlaughter, which are abſolutely incompatible with the <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>neceſſary diſtinctions</hi> to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved between <hi>wilful murder</hi> and <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaughter,</hi> which they themſelves have laid down in other parts of their works: and it is on the authority of theſe juſt <hi>diſtinctions,</hi> with the neceſſary conſequences ariſing therefrom, (and not on my own preſumption,) that this cenſure is founded; which the following tract I hope will clearly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.</p>
            <p>But as my readers might ſeem to give too much credit to an inconſiderable perſon like myſelf, were they, (without a previous intimation of what is propoſed,) to riſque any loſs of time in the peruſal of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and proofs at large, on which my
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:1233702100:12"/>vindication for this attempt depends, I think it my duty to ſtate the ſubject and intention of the tract, as briefly as I can, in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatory addreſs, that my readers may, thereby, be enabled to judge, without much loſs of time, whether the matter is of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient conſequence to merit any more of their attention.</p>
            <p>I have already mentioned my opinion, that <q>No man can give or accept a chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to fight <hi>with weapons,</hi> on any private difference whatever, without being guilty of <hi>wilful murder</hi> if he <hi>kills</hi> his antagoniſt.</q> And the intention of the following tract is to ſhew, that the writers on Crown Law have no juſt war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for admitting the contrary doctrines, which they have laid down concerning <hi>ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den affrays</hi> and <hi>rencountres,</hi> viz. that <hi>the voluntary killing</hi> of a man on a <hi>ſudden
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:1233702100:13"/>provocation</hi> is only to be eſteemed <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaughter,</hi> and, as ſuch, is intitled to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of clergy. And they have alſo ſuppoſed that <hi>an aſſault</hi> is a ſufficient provocation to juſtify a <hi>voluntary manſlaughter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, certain it is, that ſome allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ought to be made for heat of blood upon a <hi>ſudden provocation,</hi> in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the extreme frailty of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, provided that there are no circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of <hi>malice</hi> in the caſe. As if (for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance) a man, <hi>in ſudden anger,</hi> ſhould ſtrike another, merely <hi>with his fiſt,</hi> or a ſmall <hi>cane,</hi> or <hi>ſtick,</hi> meaning only to correct, and ſhould <hi>accidentally kill;</hi> this would be, properly, <hi>manſlaughter;</hi> which, tho' it is deemed <hi>Felony</hi> (as the act of ſtriking, or beating another perſon is, in itſelf, <hi>unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi>) is nevertheleſs <hi>pardonable</hi> both by the laws of God and man. But when two perſons fight with <hi>dangerous weapons,</hi> an
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:1233702100:14"/>
               <hi>intention of killing</hi> is <hi>expreſſed</hi> by the <hi>weapons;</hi> and <hi>ſuch intention</hi> renders the manſlaughter <hi>voluntary,</hi> which is the ſame thing as <hi>wilful;</hi> and conſequently the <hi>"ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice prepenſed"</hi> (which excludes the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of clergy) is neceſſarily <hi>implied,</hi> though the ſudden anger be but a moment before the fatal ſtroke; for <hi>"malice prepenſed"</hi> is thus defined by Sir Edward Coke, <q>That is (ſays he) <hi>voluntary,</hi> and of ſet pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, though done <hi>upon a ſudden occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:</hi> for if it be <hi>voluntary</hi> the law implieth <hi>malice.</hi>

               <hi>3</hi> Inſt. <hi>c. xiii. p. 62.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet the ſame great lawyer in p. <hi>55,</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>voluntary manſlaughter</hi> upon <hi>ſome ſudden falling out,</hi> as diſtinct from <hi>murder;</hi> which cannot, in reaſon, be true; for if the <hi>killing be voluntary,</hi> the evil and <hi>malicious intention</hi> is neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the act, even though the fatal blow be given merely with <hi>the hand,</hi> or a

               <hi>ſmall cane</hi> or <hi>ſtick,</hi> which I have before mentioned as pardonable caſes, when the <hi>killing</hi> is not intended; for a <hi>voluntary ſtriking,</hi> without intention to kill, is indeed pardonable, though death enſues; but a <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary killing</hi> is ſo far from being ſo, that the law, according to lord Coke's own rule, <hi>implieth malice;</hi> and, conſequently, the ſame muſt, neceſſarily, be eſteemed <hi>Murder,</hi> and not meerly <hi>Manſlaughter;</hi> becauſe the neceſſary marks, whereby <hi>manſlaughter</hi> ought to be diſtinguiſhed, are abſolutely wanting therein: for <hi>manſlaughter</hi> muſt be "without <hi>malice</hi> expreſs or implied" (<hi>1</hi> Hale <hi>466. 4</hi> Blackſtone <hi>191</hi>) "<hi>Murder</hi> being ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated" (ſays lord Hale) <q>with malice preſumed or <hi>implied,</hi> but manſlaughter not.</q> And yet all theſe great and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent lawyers have unhappily fallen into the ſame error of treating the <hi>voluntary branch</hi> of killing, as bare <hi>Homicide,</hi> or <hi>manſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi>
               <pb n="xv" facs="tcp:1233702100:16"/>whereas, all the oldeſt writers agree, that <hi>killing</hi> is pardonable only in caſes <hi>of inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table neceſſity</hi> (Bracton, lib. <hi>iii.</hi> c. <hi>4.</hi> p. <hi>120.</hi> b.

            <p>Now, the abſurd and depraved notions of <hi>honour,</hi> and <hi>gentleman-like ſatisfaction,</hi> of which I complain, could not poſſibly exiſt, if every conqueror in a duel, who kills his antagoniſt, was ſure of being <hi>hanged up</hi> as an ignominious <hi>felon,</hi> for his own <hi>gentleman-like ſatisfaction;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I apprehend, that the diabolical practice of ſettling private differences with ſword and piſtol is chiefly to be attributed to the want of puniſhment due to <hi>voluntary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaughter,</hi> through the miſtaken conceſſions of the Writers on Crown Law, and the falſe
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:1233702100:17"/>mercy of Juries, in conſideration of <hi>ſudden anger;</hi> becauſe <hi>impunity</hi> foſters vice and depravity; but more eſpecially in caſes of <hi>wilful manſlaughter,</hi> impunity ought to be eſteemed the bane of ſociety; as <hi>the guilt of blood</hi> is thereby thrown upon a whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or country; for it is a ſupreme law, that <q>whoſo ſheddeth <hi>man's blood,</hi> by <hi>man</hi> ſhall <hi>his blood</hi> be ſhed.</q> Gen. <hi>ix. 6.</hi> And I hope I have proved by incontrovertable extracts from the laws of God, that the ſaid judgment is inevitably incurred by all <hi>voluntary killing,</hi> except in the legal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of juſtice, and in the neceſſary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of our lives and properties; ſo that <hi>no Man on earth</hi> (and much leſs in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land<note n="b" place="bottom">For in England, not only the laws of God, but the laws of the land forbid the pardoning of <hi>wilful manſlaughter,</hi> ſo that even <hi>the king himſelf</hi> is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely reſtrained from it.

               <note n="e" place="bottom">Ibid. 36.</note>; ſo that the allowance which the writers of the two laſt centuries have made for <hi>ſudden anger</hi> (without preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a proper <hi>diſtinction</hi> of the caſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it really deſerves conſideration) is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt in itſelf, as well as dangerous to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; for few men would entertain ſuch abſurd notions of honour, as to think themſelves obliged to revenge affronts with their <hi>ſwords</hi> or <hi>piſtols,</hi> if they were <hi>ſure</hi> to be hanged up as felons and murderers for their own <hi>gentleman-like ſatisfaction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>In every charge of murder, <hi>the fact of killing being firſt proved,</hi> all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Accident, Neceſſity, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1233702100:22"/>are to be ſatisfactorily proved by the priſoner, unleſs they ariſe out of of the evidence produced againſt him: for the law preſumeth the fact to have been <hi>founded in malice,</hi> until the contrary appeareth.</q> Judge Foſter, 255.</p>
            <p>The caſes of homicide which are juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or excuſed by the above-mentioned <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances</hi> of <hi>Accident</hi> and <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> are well underſtood, and, by many eminent writers, ſufficiently explained under the heads of <hi>Misfortune</hi> and <hi>Self-defence.</hi> But with reſpect to thoſe caſes of Homicide, which are attended with circumſtances of <hi>infirmity</hi> (the third branch of circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces mentioned above) thewriters on crown law in general have been very indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, notwithſtanding that the true diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction between <hi>Murder</hi> and <hi>Manſlaughter</hi> depends entirely on a clear ſtating of thoſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1233702100:23"/>caſes of <hi>infirmity,</hi> which really deſerve conſideration and excuſe.</p>
            <p>Judge Foſter, indeed, is, for the moſt part, nice and accurate in his diſtinctions; yet he has paid ſo great a regard to the authority of <hi>precedents,</hi> that he has been unwarily led away (as well as other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) from the neceſſary concluſions of his own arguments upon this point; I ſhall, nevertheleſs, make uſe of his words as far as they expreſs my own opinion of the ſubject.— <q>Whoever would ſhelter himſelf under the plea of <hi>Provocation</hi> muſt prove his caſe to the ſatisfaction of his jury. The preſumption of law is againſt him, till that preſumption is repelled by contrary evidence. What degree of <hi>Provocation,</hi> and under what circumſtances Heat of blood, the <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror brevis,</hi> will or will not avail the Defendant is now to be conſidered.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:1233702100:24"/>
               <q>Words of Reproach, how grievous ſoever, are not a Provocation ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to free the Party killing from the <hi>guilt of murder.</hi> Nor are indecent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking actions or geſtures expreſſive of contempt or reproach, <hi>without an aſſault upon the perſon.</hi>
               </q> (p. 290.) But I think myſelf obliged to add that even <hi>an aſſault</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">See my Remarks (in p. 58, &amp;c.) on Mr. Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins's aſſertions relating to this point.</note> 
               <hi>upon the perſon</hi> is NOT <q>a Provocation ſufficient to free the Party killing from the <hi>guilt of murder,</hi>
               </q> (though this learned judge ſeems to think otherwiſe. See Sect. iii. p. 295) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs all the circumſtances which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to render it excuſable by the plea of <hi>ſelf-defence</hi> can clearly be proved. For if <hi>the Killing</hi> in a ſudden fray is not <hi>ex neceſſitate,</hi> (as in Self-defence, or in the lawful Defence of others), it muſt be eſteemed <hi>voluntary;</hi> and <hi>voluntary</hi> is the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1233702100:25"/>ſame thing as <hi>wilful;</hi> which neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes "<hi>malice.</hi> For Bracton ſays, <q>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men non contrahitur niſi <hi>Voluntas no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendi</hi> intercedat &amp; voluntas et propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitum diſtinguunt <hi>Malificium,</hi>
               </q> &amp;c. lib. iii. c. 17.) So that <hi>malice</hi> muſt neceſſarily be <hi>preſumed,</hi> whenever the <hi>killing</hi> is not <hi>ex neceſſitate,</hi> eſpecially if the fatal blow be <hi>wilfully</hi> given with <hi>a weapon;</hi> for in that caſe a man muſt neceſſarily be ſuppoſed to ſtrike, <hi>"cum occidendi animo,"</hi> becauſe the <hi>Voluntas nocendi</hi> is apparent; and, conſequently, the <hi>malice,</hi> in ſuch a caſe, is not only <hi>implied</hi> but clearly <hi>expreſſed;</hi> ſo that the <hi>ſudden anger</hi> is only a further proof of <hi>the malice</hi> and "<hi>intention</hi> to do harm."</p>
            <p>Bracton has accurately laid down the proper diſtinction to be obſerved in the plea of <hi>an excuſable Neceſſity</hi> for killing.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Quo caſu diſtinguendum eſt utrum <hi>Neceſſitas</hi> illa fuit <hi>evitablis</hi> vel non. Si
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1233702100:26"/>autem <hi>evitabilis,</hi> et evadere poſſet abſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que occiſione, tune erit <hi>reus homicidii</hi>
               </q> (and a felonious <hi>homicide</hi> or <hi>manſlaughter,</hi> in the days of Bracton, had the ſame meaning that we now apply to <hi>Murder</hi>). <q>Si autem <hi>inevitablis,</hi> quia occidit homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem ſine odii meditatione <hi>in metu &amp; do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lore animi,</hi> ſe et ſua liberando cùm ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</q> (<hi>mortem propriam</hi> Fleta, lib. I. c. 23.) <q>evadere non poſſet, non tenetur ad poenam homicidii.</q> Bract. lib. iii. c. 4. And Staunford remarks, that <hi>the neceſſity</hi> ought to be ſo great, that it ought to be eſteemed <hi>inevitable,</hi> or otherwiſe it ſhall not be excuſed; ſo that the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conſiſts (ſays he) in the <hi>inevitable neceſſity,</hi> without which the <hi>killing is by no means excuſable</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="bottom">Nota que la neceſſite doit etre cy graunde; que il doit eſtre exiſtimé <hi>inevitable,</hi> ou autrement il n'ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſera, &amp;c. eins tout la matier conſiſt in le <hi>inevitable neceſſite,</hi> ſans quel, <hi>le tuer</hi> n'eſt <hi>aſcun voi excuſable.</hi> Staunford, P.C. lib. i. c. 7.</note> ſo that the learned judge Foſter certainly goes too far, when
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1233702100:27"/>he inſinuates, in the paſſage before cited, "that <hi>an aſſault</hi> upon the perſon" (with out mentioning the neceſſary exception concerning <hi>inevitable Neceſſity</hi>) <q>is a provocation ſufficient to free the party killing from the guilt of murder.</q> For a farther diſtinction (beſides that of <hi>ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitable neceſſity</hi>) is alſo to be obſerved, which is very accurately laid down, even by judge Foſter himſelf, in p. 291, though the ſame would be uſeleſs, if <hi>an aſſault upon the perſon</hi> was to be admitted as a <hi>ſufficient provocation</hi> to the act of <hi>killing.</hi>
               <q> It ought to be remembred (ſays he) that in all other caſes of homicide upon ſlight provocation<note n="g" place="bottom">But I have already ſhewn that <hi>no provocation</hi> whatever can juſtify a <hi>voluntary</hi> or <hi>wilfull killing.</hi>
                  </note> if it may be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably collected <hi>from the weapon</hi> made uſe of, or from any other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that the Party <hi>intended to kill,</hi> or to do ſome great bodily harm, <hi>ſuch
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1233702100:28"/>Homicide</hi> will be Murder. The miſchief done is irreparable, and the outrage is conſidered as flowing rather from <hi>brutal rage</hi> or <hi>diabolical malignity than from human frailty.</hi> And it is to <hi>human frailty,</hi> and to that alone, the Law indulgeth in every caſe of felonious Homicide.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt Inſtance which he gives by way of illuſtration to this doctrine is cited from Judge Hale, Vol. i. p. 473. If <q>
                  <hi>A.</hi> come into the wood of <hi>B.</hi> and pull his Hedges, or cut his wood, and <hi>B.</hi> beat him, whereof he dies, this is <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaughter,</hi> becauſe, tho it was not lawful for <hi>A.</hi> to cut the wood, it was not lawful for <hi>B.</hi> to beat him, but either to bring him to a juſtice of peace, or puniſh him otherwiſe according to law.</q> But here Lord Hale is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently diſtinct in ſtating the caſe; becauſe Circumſtances are wanting, which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1233702100:29"/>for the determination of ſuch a caſe, whether it ought to be eſteemed <hi>manſlaughter</hi> or <hi>murder.</hi> The accurate judge Foſter was ſenſible of this want of <hi>neceſſary circumſtances,</hi> and therefore adds, <q>But it muſt be underſtood (ſays he) that he beat him, <hi>not with a miſchievous intention,</hi> but meerly to chaſtiſe for the treſpaſs, and to deter him from committing the like. For if he had knocked his Brains out with <hi>a bill or hedgeſtake,</hi> or had given him <hi>an outrageous beating</hi> with an ordinary cudgel beyond the the bounds of a <hi>ſudden reſentment,</hi> whereof he had died, <hi>It had been Murder.</hi> For theſe circumſtances are ſome of the genuine ſymptoms of the <hi>Mala Mens,</hi> the heart bent upon miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, which, as I have already ſhewn, enter into the true notion <hi>of Malice</hi> in the legal ſenſe of the word.</q> p. 291.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:1233702100:30"/>The next inſtance he mentions is that of the parker tying the boy to his horſe's tail. Which was (ſays he) <q>
                  <hi>held to be murder.</hi>" "For it was a deliberate act, <hi>and ſavoured of cruelty.</hi>
               </q> But the third inſtance, viz. that of Stedman the ſoldier killing a woman <hi>with a ſword</hi> (which judge Foſter mentions as a caſe that <hi>was held clearly to be no more than manſlaughter</hi>) was, moſt certainly, <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful murder:</hi> for though it appeared, that the woman had ſtruck the ſoldier on the face with an iron patten; yet ſhe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards fled from him, and he <q>
                  <hi>purſuing</hi> her, <hi>ſtabbed her in the back.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now if ſuch a caſe of <hi>wilful killing</hi> is to be eſteemed only manſlaughter, it entirely perverts the juſt arguments already quoted from the ſame author concerning the caſes wherein <hi>human frailty</hi> deſerves to be <hi>indulged!</hi> May I not uſe his own words againſt him?
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1233702100:31"/>That "theſe circumſtances" (the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing, and ſtabbing the woman in the back) <q>are ſome of the genuine ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of the <hi>mala mens,</hi> the <hi>heart bent upon miſchief.</hi>
               </q> Whereas, if he had <hi>ſtruck her</hi> merely with his fiſt, or with a ſmall ſtick <hi>not likely</hi> to kill, and had unluckily, and againſt his <hi>intention, killed,</hi> it had been but <hi>manſlaughter.</hi> For this is the neceſſary diſtinction for which I contend <hi>in all caſes of killing</hi> where the <hi>ſtriking</hi> (not the killing) is <hi>voluntary:</hi> and I cannot ſo well expreſs my meaning as in the words of judge Foſter himſelf, though that ſenſible and acute reaſoner is afterwards miſled from the truth of his own doctrine by paying too much regard to the practice of the Courts, which, in this point, has frequently been erroneous.</p>
            <p>In page 290, after the 1ſt ſection (already quoted) concerning the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, which <q>are not a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1233702100:32"/>ſufficient to free the Party Killing from the Guilt of Murder,</q> he adds, <q>This rule will, I conceive (ſays he) govern every caſe where the Party Killing upon ſuch provocation <hi>maketh uſe of a deadly weapon,</hi> or otherwiſe <hi>manifeſteth an intention to kill,</hi> or to do ſome great bodily harm. But if he had given the other a box on the ear, or had ſtruck him with a ſtick or other weapon <hi>not likely to kill,</hi> and <hi>had unluckily and againſt his intention</hi> killed, it had been but <hi>manſlaughter.</hi> The difference between the caſes is plainly this. In the former <hi>the malitia, the wicked vindictive diſpoſition</hi> already mentioned, <hi>evidently appeareth:</hi> in the latter it is <hi>as evidently wanting.</hi> The Party in the firſt tranſport of his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion intended to chaſtiſe for a piece of inſolence which few ſpirits can bear. In this caſe the benignity of the law interpoſeth in favour of human frailty;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1233702100:33"/>in the other its juſtice regardeth and <hi>puniſheth the apparent malignity of the heart.</hi>
               </q> p. 290 and 291.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs the ſame author, in p. 296, endeavours to excuſe killing in <hi>ſudden rencounters,</hi> without preſerving this neceſſary diſtinction concerning <q>the uſe of a deadly weapon,</q> and <q>
                  <hi>the intention to kill.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>To what I have offered (ſays he) with regard to <hi>ſudden rencounters</hi> let me add, that the blood, already too much heated, kindleth afreſh at every paſs or blow. And in the tumult of the paſſions, in which <hi>meer inſtinct ſelf-preſervation,</hi> hath no inconſiderable ſhare, the voice of reaſon is not heard.

            <p>When I ſpeak of ſuch reſpectable and juſtly revered authors as Sir Edward Coke, Sir Matthew Hale, lord chief juſtice Holt, &amp;c. No perſon can conceive that I am miſled by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal or party prejudice againſt their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; and as I have, really, the higheſt eſteem and veneration for their memory, not only as great and learned lawyers, but as true patriots, and, above all, as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1233702100:35"/>Chriſtians, and worthy honeſt men, I ſhould not preſume to controvert any point that has been laid down by ſuch excellent lawyers <hi>(ſo accompliſhed as above)</hi> was I not armed by <hi>their own authority;</hi> for <hi>no other authority</hi> is-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently authentic for the purpoſe of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting ſuch deſervedly eſteemed wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; though I muſt acknowledge my obligation to the more ancient writers for the diſcovery of the errors of which I complain.</p>
            <p>The proper diſtinction to be obſerved between <hi>murder</hi> and <hi>manſlaughter</hi> is well laid down by Sir Matthew Hale. <q>
                  <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> (ſays he) being aggravated with malice <hi>preſumed</hi> or <hi>implied, but man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaughter</hi> Not.</q> 1 Hale's P. C. 466.</p>
            <p>This rule is good and unexceptionable; and therefore it muſt appear, that even Sir Matthew Hale himſelf is miſtaken in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1233702100:36"/>the paragraph preceding this quotation, where he ſays that <q>
                  <hi>Manſlaughter,</hi> or <hi>ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple homicide,</hi> is the <hi>voluntary killing</hi> of another without <hi>malice expreſs</hi> or <hi>impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi>
               </q> for though there may be a <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſtriking</hi> without <hi>malice,</hi> yet I hope I have already proved, that there cannot be a <hi>voluntary killing</hi> without <hi>malice expreſs</hi> or <hi>implied,</hi> except in the legal execution of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and in the caſe of <hi>ſelf-defence</hi> and its ſeveral branches, which ſome writers (ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther improperly) have, indeed, called <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary</hi>

The ſon fights with another boy and is beaten; he runs home to his father all bloody; the father takes a ſtaff, runs three quarters of a mile, and beats the other boy, who dieth of this beating.

                  </q> (for which he cites 12 Rep. 87. and 1 Hale 453.) "Surely" (continues judge Foſter) <q>the provocation was not very grievous. The boy had fought with one who happened to be an overmatch for him, and was worſted; a diſaſter ſlight enough, and very frequent among boys.

<p>Judge Foſter in his ſecond diſcourſe of homicide, p. 258. where he treats of <hi>involuntary homicide</hi> in the commiſſion of an <hi>unlawful act,</hi> informs us, <q>that if it be done in the proſecution of a <hi>felonious inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> it will be <hi>Murder,</hi> but if the intent went no farther than to commit <hi>a bare treſpaſs,</hi> Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaughter.

The proper diſtinction to be obſerved is, when the <hi>intention</hi> of <hi>killing</hi> is not neceſſarily <hi>implied</hi> in the act itſelf; as when a man ſtrikes another merely with his hand, or fiſt, in ſudden anger; or thruſts him ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from him, whereby he falls and receives a hurt, which occaſions death; in theſe, and ſimilar caſes, the ſtriking, or thruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, indeed, <hi>voluntary,</hi> yet the <hi>killing,</hi> or <hi>manſlaughter,</hi> is not ſo, but entirely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſigned and unexpected; which proper and neceſſary diſtinction the Law Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators have unhappily neglected.

            <p>The caſes of <hi>Misfortune or Accident,</hi> which are deemed <hi>Murder,</hi> are thoſe

            <p>The <hi>implication of malice</hi> in the owner of a beaſt that kills a man, after warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given, will alſo further illuſtrate what has been ſaid; for though mere careleſſneſs or inconſideration might oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion his neglect, ſo that the accident may, in ſome degree, be eſteemed a <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,</hi> yet the law implies <hi>malice;</hi>

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:1233702100:71"/>is agreeable to the doctrine of judge Staunford, P.

               </q> See alſo Crompton, p. 24. b. and 1 Hawkins, c. xxxi. § 8.

Nevertheleſs, Mr. Hawkins ventures to aſſert a very different doctrine in his Pleas of the Crown, 1 Book c. xxviii. § 24. <q>I ſee no reaſon (ſays he) why a perſon, who without Provocation is aſſaulted by another in any place whatſoever, in ſuch a Manner as plainly ſhews an intent to murder him, as by diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Piſtol, or puſhing at him with a drawn Sword, &amp;c. may not <hi>juſtify Kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> ſuch an Aſſailant, as much as if he had attempted to rob him: for is not he, who attempts to Murder me (ſays he) more injurious than he
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:1233702100:78"/>who barely attempts to rob me? And can it be more juſtifiable to fight for my goods than for my Life? And it is not only highly agreeable to reaſon, that a Man in ſuch circumſtances may <hi>lawfully Kill</hi> another, but it ſeems alſo to be confirmed by <hi>the general Tenor of our Law-books,</hi>
               </q> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But howſoever ſpecious this argument may appear, I hope I have already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>"by the general Tenor of our Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>books;"</hi> that the <hi>Juſtifiable Killing</hi> of a Man muſt be through <hi>an inevitable neceſſity:</hi> and therefore what Mr. Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins afterwards advances, in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of ſuch a caſe with Homicide in <hi>ſe Defendendo,</hi> cannot in the leaſt juſtify either his opinion on that point, or his aſſertion concerning <q>the general Tenor of the Law-books.</q>

            </p>
            <p>The ſingle circumſtance that <hi>the Killer</hi> was under <hi>no neceſſity</hi> of endeavouring to retreat, and avoid the aſſailant, is not only a proof that <hi>his own intentions</hi> (though he might not be the firſt aggreſſor) were nearly as criminal, as thoſe he attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to the <hi>perſon Killed,</hi> but it alſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords a ſtrong preſumption, that <hi>the latter</hi> was not very ſtrenuous or ſanguine, either in his attack, or in his ſuppoſed <hi>inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to commit murder:</hi> ſo that the very pretence, by which Mr. Hawkins en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to juſtify ſuch a <hi>voluntary Kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> muſt neceſſarily fall to the ground,

And though the Deceaſed might have had <hi>"a Weapon Drawn,"</hi> yet that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance affords no poſitive proof of his <hi>criminal intention;</hi> for he might have thought himſelf obliged to draw in his own defence, through a reciprocal ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of his adverſary's <hi>criminal intentions:</hi> and as he cannot plead his own cauſe, it is reaſonable that the Law ſhould <hi>preſume,</hi> that he really did draw in his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, eſpecially as the circumſtance, that <hi>the Killer</hi> was under no neceſſity of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to avoid him, affords a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Ground for ſuch <hi>a preſumption:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And even in caſes where it may be ſuppoſed that the <hi>perſon Killed</hi> might
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:1233702100:82"/>really have had <hi>"an intent to murder,"</hi> we ought to remember that the Laws of England do not puniſh men <hi>merely</hi> for their <hi>"criminal intentions"</hi> without ſome fact! and, therefore, it would be highly abſurd to ſuppoſe, that the Law, without ſome apparent neceſſity, would entruſt every individual, indiſcriminately, with a ſupream Authority, which it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies <hi>even</hi> to the Higheſt and moſt ſolemn Courts of Juſtice; I mean an Authority to inflict capital puniſhment without a previous Trial <hi>per pares;</hi> and that mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for <hi>"a Criminal Intention;"</hi> which, in many caſes, might as eaſily, (through fear, paſſion, or violent prejudice) be miſtaken, or imaginary, as be real!</p>
            <p>And therefore <q>
                  <hi>an Aſſault upon the Perſon</hi>
               </q> is not (as I have before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in p. 5. againſt the opinion of Judge
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:1233702100:83"/>Foſter) <q>a Provocation ſufficient to free <hi>the Party Killing</hi> from the Guilt of Murder.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The caſe of Gentlemen in the Army, nevertheleſs, ſeems peculiarly hard upon ſuch unhappy occaſions. The firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of their profeſſion is <hi>Courage;</hi> and the World, in general, is too de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved to diſtinguiſh in what caſes a Man of <hi>true Courage</hi> may retreat <hi>with honour</hi> from the Aſſault of an Enemy; ſo that Military Men are liable to be <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly</hi> deſpiſed, whenever they act <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably</hi> in caſes either of inſult, or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault!</p>
            <p>Yet, at the ſame time, it ought to be remembered, that thoſe men who ſubmit to <hi>the Slaviſh Yoke</hi> of other Men's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved opinions or unreaſonable cuſtoms
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:1233702100:84"/>(in contradiction to that <hi>natural Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of <hi>Good and Evil,</hi> which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit, in common with the reſt of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, from our firſt Parents), cannot <hi>juſtly</hi> be deemed <hi>Men of Honour;</hi> and, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, are unworthy of <hi>Rank</hi> in the honourable Profeſſion of Arms. And though ſuch men may ſupport an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>appearance</hi> of <hi>Courage</hi> in the eye of the world, by <hi>daring</hi> to violate the Laws of God and Man in <hi>private</hi> Quarrels, yet that very act affords the moſt manifeſt token of the Want of <hi>real</hi> and <hi>ſteady Courage;</hi> for unleſs the ſubmiſſion to that depraved cuſtom can be attributed to <hi>inconſideration, or</hi> to <hi>the want of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> it muſt neceſſarily be ſuppoſed, that the <hi>Duelliſt had not ſufficient Courage</hi> to aſſert his <hi>natural Right</hi> of Acting agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Dictates of his <hi>own reaſon and conſcience;</hi> and was <hi>unable to face the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:1233702100:85"/>of <hi>an</hi> adverſe Fortune <hi>in a good Cauſe;</hi> and therefore, like a wretched <hi>Coward,</hi> he yielded himſelf a priſoner and ſlave to the faſhionable Depravity!</p>
            <p>I am far from meaning however to charge all Soldiers with Cowardice that have fought Duels: ſometimes Paſſion and falſe Pride, but more frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſideration, and ignorance of the Laws of God and Man (as I have before hinted) occaſion the baſe ſubmiſſion and conformity to thoſe <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>unreaſonable notions of Honour,</hi> which almoſt univerſally prevail.</p>
            <p>Nor do I ſo much blame the Military Gentlemen, for this unnatural depravity, as I do the Profeſſors of the Law; who ought to have ſet them a better example, and yet, have rather contributed to <hi>the ignorance of the times,</hi> by the many <hi>groſs perverſions</hi> of <hi>our Law,</hi> which they
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:1233702100:86"/>have admitted into the Books. Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Army are not obliged, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, to acquire a critical knowledge of the Law, but they muſt not forget that they are <hi>Men,</hi> as well as <hi>Soldiers;</hi> and that if they do not maintain the Natural Privilege of <hi>Men,</hi> (viz. that of thinking for themſelves, and acting agreeable to the Dictates of their <hi>own Conſcience,</hi> as Members of the Community), they are unfit for <hi>Britiſh Soldiers,</hi> of whom the <hi>Law</hi> requires an acknowledgment of <hi>her ſupremacy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Law will not excuſe an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Act</hi> by a Soldier, even though he commits it by <hi>the expreſs Command</hi> of the higheſt military Authority in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: and much leſs is the Soldier obliged to conform himſelf <hi>implicitly</hi> to the mere opinions and falſe Notions of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:1233702100:87"/>Honour, which his Superiors may have unfortunately adopted. — Even in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick military Service, or warlike Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions by <hi>National authority,</hi> the Law manifeſtly requires the Soldier <hi>to think for himſelf;</hi> and to conſider, before he acts in any war, whether the ſame be <hi>juſt;</hi> for, if it be otherwiſe, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law of this Kingdom will <hi>impute</hi> to him <hi>the Guilt</hi> of <hi>Murder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though the Law does not actually puniſh ſuch general Crimes, as may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately have obtained, at any time, the Sanction of Government, yet the time will certainly come, when all ſuch temporizing military <hi>Murderers</hi> muſt be reſponſible for the innocent blood that is ſhed in an <hi>unjuſt</hi> War, if they have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered themſelves <hi>acceſſaries to it by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit,</hi> and, therefore, <hi>criminal</hi> obedience
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:1233702100:88"/>to the promoters of it. <q>Item fit Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micidium <hi>in Bello,</hi>
               </q> (ſays the learned Bracton) <q>et tunc videndum utrum <hi>Bellum</hi> ſit <hi>juſtum</hi> vel <hi>injuſtum.</hi> Si au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem <hi>injuſtum,</hi> tenebitur occiſor: ſi au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem <hi>juſtum,</hi> ſicut <hi>pro defenſione pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triae,</hi> non tenebitur, niſi hoc <hi>fecerit corrupta voluntate et intentione</hi> 
                  <note n="i" place="bottom">Bracton, Lib. 3. c. 4. <hi>de Corona,</hi> p. 121.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Men of <hi>true honour,</hi> therefore, at the ſame time that they are ſenſible of their duty as <hi>Soldiers</hi> and <hi>Subjects</hi> to their King, muſt be mindful that they are <hi>ſubject alſo to the empire of reaſon,</hi> and are bound thereby, in common with all mankind, to maintain the <hi>dignity</hi> and <hi>natural freedom</hi> of Human Nature: and thoſe Soldiers, who, in addition to their natural reaſon, have a true ſenſe of Religion, will not only be mindful, that they are Soldiers and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:1233702100:89"/>Subjects to an earthly King, but that they are alſo <hi>Soldiers</hi> and <hi>Subjects</hi> to <hi>the King of Kings;</hi> whoſe Laws and precepts they will, on all occaſions, prefer <hi>to every other command;</hi> and will obey the ſame with ſuch a <hi>ſteady courage,</hi> as may be equal to every adverſity, and undeſerved ſuffering that threatens them.</p>
            <p>It was this indiſpenſible, this happy diſpoſition, and ſenſe of <hi>ſuperior duty,</hi> which prevailed even in an unlawful ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Army, that had been <hi>raiſed,</hi> and was <hi>expreſly deſigned</hi> for arbitrary purpoſes, and which, nevertheleſs, contrary to all expectation, exerted itſelf in ſaving this Kingdom, at the Glorious Revolution, from the Political Slavery, which then threatened it, as well as from the more intolerable Tyranny of the Romiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:1233702100:90"/>The Soldier, therefore, who has not <hi>Courage enough</hi> to profeſs, on all occaſions, a ſtrict obedience to the <hi>Laws of his Country,</hi> according to the dictates of his <hi>own reaſon</hi> and <hi>Conſcience, in preference to every command, and every other opinion what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,</hi> is unworthy of the Britiſh military ſervice; being qualified rather to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſted with the ſlaviſh Troops of the <hi>Grand Monarch</hi> of France; or to ſerve in the Black Banditti of the Emperor of Morocco!</p>
            <p>But I muſt return once more to the opinions of the Profeſſors of Law— <q>it is ſaid <note n="k" place="bottom">This opinion is in the true ſtile of a <hi>Tradition,</hi> ſuch as thoſe, by which the Jews of old <hi>"perverted the Law."</hi>
                  </note>, that if he who draws upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other <hi>in a ſudden Quarrel,</hi> make no paſs at him <hi>till his ſword is drawn,</hi> and then fight with him, and <hi>Kill him,</hi> he is guilty
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:1233702100:91"/>of <hi>Manſlaughter</hi> only,</q> &amp;c. 1 Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins Pleas of the Crown, c. xxxi. § 28. for which he quotes Kelynge 55. 61. and 131: but <hi>the pretence</hi> for this indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence is as <hi>frivolous</hi> as the Doctrine is <hi>falſe,</hi> viz. <q>becauſe (ſays Mr. Hawkins) that by neglecting the opportunity of Killing the other before he was on his guard, and in a condition to defend himſelf, with like Hazard to both, he ſhewed that his <hi>intent</hi> was not ſo much to <hi>kill,</hi> as to <hi>combat</hi> with the other, in compliance with thoſe <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon notions of Honour,</hi>
               </q> &amp;c.—But is "not the intent <hi>to kill,</hi>" or to do ſome bodily harm, and certainly, at leaſt, the Riſque of <hi>Killing,</hi> included in the intention <hi>"to Combat" with dangerous weapons?</hi> And is it <hi>Juſtice?</hi> Nay! is it <hi>common Senſe</hi> to excuſe a <hi>Notorious Crime,</hi> by the Plea of an <hi>intention</hi> to commit another Crime almoſt as bad?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:1233702100:92"/>I have already ſhewn, by fair com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon with a variety of caſes, that the crime of wilfully <hi>ſtriking</hi> or <hi>Combating with weapons in ſudden Anger,</hi> is a much more <hi>unlawful act</hi> than many others, wherein even <hi>involuntary and accidental Homicide</hi> has been ſolemnly ajudged <hi>Murder,</hi> and has been generally admitted as ſuch by the Sages of our Law in their Reports; and it will therefore be highly diſgraceful to our Law, but more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly (becauſe <hi>deſervedly</hi>) to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of it, if they ſhould ſtill perſiſt in the <hi>unreaſonable</hi> and <hi>unjuſt</hi> practice of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing <hi>leſſer</hi> Crimes with <hi>more</hi> ſeverity than the crying <hi>Sin</hi> of <hi>voluntary Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaughter,</hi> which (as I have already proved in my preface) is abſolutely <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable in this World,</hi> by the Laws of God!</p>
