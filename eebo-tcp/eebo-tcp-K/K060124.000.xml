            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>ow near the Brink of Ruin we have ſtood, and how often we have been reſcu'd from impending Dangers by the very Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Providence, the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Struggles that have been made for Liberty, thro' the ſeveral Stages of the laſt Century, are ſufficient Indications: Yet no ſooner has the Tempeſt abated, and the Horrour of the Scene cool'd upon our Minds, but (as if we were fond of making
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1160701300:3"/>
Fatal Experiments) ſome reſtleſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable Spirits have troubled the Air afreſh, and thrown us into the ſame hazardous Circumſtances again. And what makes our Caſe the more deplorable, is, that the ſame ſtale Artifices, by which the people have been ſo often deluded, are, without the leaſt Colouring or Varniſh, trump'd up Succeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully at every turn, when either the Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Neceſſities of a few pernicious Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are to be ſerv'd. A due Reflection upon the Eaſineſs and Credulity of this Nation, has made me often Pronounce us the moſt unthinking Animals in Nature, and even below the ſyllieſt Species of the whole Field, who are never caught twice in that Snare they have been once intangl'd in. It's really amazing, that in a Conſtitution ſo well guarded, and where People daily feaſt upon the Bleſſings of Liberty, that the Byaſs ſhould run ſo ſtrong to <hi>Slavery,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when the open and avow'd Enemies of Freedom, and the <hi>Proteſtant Intereſt,</hi> lye within ſo ſmall a Graſp; but then, if we throw the Inſenſibility of ſome, the Indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of others, the Obſtinacy of a third, and, in fine, the Ductile Temper of the Generality, (tho' in moſt reſpects firm to the Eſſentials of our Conſtitution) into the Scale with thoſe few, but watchful Agents,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1160701300:4"/>
the wonder will ſoon abate. It was the Glory of Former Ages to have been always Furniſh'd with a Set of bold and uncorrupted Patriots; who, upon the leaſt Approach of Danger, ſpoke their Sentiments freely, and took all the Legal Precautions to ſecure themſelves againſt a Domineering Faction. Even after the Reſtoration of <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, when ſo ſtrong an Acclivity to <hi>Arbitrary Power</hi> run thro' the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the People were ſo perfectly tir'd out with the many Fantaſtick Schemes of a falſe Liberty, that the true Notion of <hi>Legal Right</hi> was, in a manner, turn'd into Ridicule: Even at that time, there was not wanting a ſet of Brave and Honeſt Men, of unblemiſh'd Loyalty, who Check'd the forward Humour of the Populace, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd them from making an abſolute Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of their Liberties. The many En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chroachments that were made in that Reign, notwithſtanding all the Precautions taken by ſome Good Men in Power, plainly ſhows, what an eaſy Prey we had fallen to Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, if they had not timely oppos'd the Torrent; and tho' that Healing Parliament, which ſat for ſo many Years after the King's Return, gave into the Imperious Meaſures of the Court ſo long, that they had ſcarce any thing left to make a free Gift of, leaſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1160701300:5"/>
they ſhould be thought to give ſo much as an Umbrage to Popular Complaints; yet the warm Expoſtulations they were forc'd to at laſt, explain to us their Modeſt Senſe of the Grievances afoot: But Deſpotick Sway ſtill increaſing, and Tyranny ripening by their Neglect, the Parliament of Eighty began to ſearch deep into the Wounds the State had receiv'd, and finding ſo many <hi>Siuus</hi>'s on every hand, where the Malignity had ſpread, Reſolv'd to lay all open.</p>
            <p>The Miſts which had hover'd ſo long about the Eyes of the People clear'd up, and the Nation began to ſee their Danger in a true Light, and every Man ſilently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd himſelf for being ſo prodigal of his Liberty. They then had the Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to ſee a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Plot in a Manner ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled, and only a few of the needy and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Rank of Parricides brought, with Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, to Juſtice. Still the buſy Part, the Abettors of <hi>Tyranny</hi> and <hi>Popery,</hi> acted in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the Stream of the Evidence, inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the People with double Eagerneſs and Vivacity to put it in the right Channel, and were in a fair Way of putting a Period to the Hopes of that accurſed Faction.</p>
            <p>The Pulſe of the Nation at that Juncture beat high for Liberty; and during the high Ferment which ſo many wicked At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1160701300:6"/>
upon Liberty and Religion had rais'd in the Breaſts of the People, the Necking Blow was juſt giving to <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery,</hi> had the prudent Fore-ſight of the Commons, in Preferring <hi>The Bill of Excluſion,</hi> been ſeconded by the Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Upper Houſe. The unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Indulgence at that Time granted to a Royal Branch, thro' an Exceſs of Loyalty, pav'd the Way to ſucceeding Miſeries; and there were not wanting a Set of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers, to give a wrong Turn to the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilance and bold Execution of that Truſt repos'd in the Commons: And ſuch was the Inſtability of the People, that in a ſhort Proceſs of Time, the Vein of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had ſpent itſelf, and the Tide run ſo ſtrong upward, that there was no Poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Oppoſing it. This brave Attempt of the Commons drew down an unexpiable Diſpleaſure upon ſome of the chief Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the Enterprize, but it was their Glory to ſuffer in the juſteſt Cauſe, to be in the firſt Rank of Martyrs for the Laws and Liberties of their Country, and their Aſhes will be ſtill Sacred to all in the true Intereſt of <hi>Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this State of Infatuation we continu'd, till the Prophetick Fears of theſe gallant Patriots were accompliſh'd in a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1160701300:7"/>
At length, after a Thouſand Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of the Laws, and deſperate Puſhes at the whole Body of the Conſtitution, this poor deluded Nation were pleas'd to awake once more out of their long and lazy Dreams, and ſeem'd, by a lively Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their former Credulity, and ill U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, never to be impos'd on again. The Scars which the ſhort liv'd Rage of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Tyranny</hi> had left behind, were deeply imprinted on the Minds of the Nation; and Men of the ſhalloweſt Speculations could tell you then, that <hi>Popery,</hi> under all the Oaths, Reſtraints, and Bridles, that could be laid upon it, was inconſiſtent either with Civil or Religious <hi>Liberty</hi>; nay even the rankeſt Clergy, who had made the Doctrine of <hi>Paſſive-Obedience</hi> a Scaffold to their Preferments, and coveted Dignities at the Price of their immortal Souls, aſham'd of Practiſing with the People any longer, were ſo far from Enforcing this batter'd Topick, that they rather put them upon the Defenſive Part. Then all Eyes crowded to their <hi>Deliverer,</hi> and mutually congratulated each other upon this ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Reſcue. The Nation then plainly ſaw to what Extremities their fooliſh Quarrels and Diſtinctions had reduc'd them. <hi>Whigg</hi> and <hi>Tory, High</hi> and <hi>Low,</hi> were unfaſhiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1160701300:8"/>
Names, loſt in the prevailing Harmony of <hi>Engliſh Liberty</hi> and the <hi>Proteſtant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. Moderation</hi> was then look'd upon as a laudable Quality, and moſt People had ſeen ſo much of a Zeal contrary to Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that they could not approve of Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in any Dreſs. The moſt <hi>Orthodox Churchmen</hi> profeſs'd a true <hi>Primitive Una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity,</hi> and coming to ſuch a Temper with all that diſſented from them, as gave every ſober Man a delightful Proſpect from the firſt Opening of this happy Scene.</p>
            <p>Family Revenges handed down to Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, thro' an Inveteracy of Principle, and heighten'd by a warm Reflection upon the ill Offices done to each other in thoſe <hi>Bloody</hi> and <hi>Unnatural Wars,</hi> ſeem'd bury'd in Oblivion. In ſhort, one Soul actuated the whole Nation, and all prepar'd to be happy in good earneſt. Yet in thoſe Days (and I believe moſt People then thought them the happieſt that ever befell <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>) we happen'd all to be in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Phraſe, <hi>Antimonarchical, Republican, Heterodox Creatures,</hi> (or, in a more conciſe way of Talking) <hi>Whiggs, Deteſtable Whiggs</hi>; nay, even the <hi>Moderate Papiſts,</hi> and ſome of the firſt Claſs amongſt the <hi>Non-Jurors.</hi> Sir <hi>E—d S—r</hi> was
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1160701300:9"/>
a <hi>Whigg,</hi> when he ſign'd the <hi>Aſſociation</hi> at <hi>Exeter,</hi> tho' I am at a Loſs to know what he was upon the Attainder of <hi>F—k. H—w</hi> was certainly a <hi>Whigg,</hi> when he accepted of the <hi>Golden Key,</hi> tho' there was ſoom Room to charge his Principle betwixt that and the <hi>Felonious Treaty.</hi> A certain P—r towards the <hi>North,</hi> was a <hi>Whigg,</hi> when he came to pay his Homage to King <hi>William,</hi> and it's Pity ſuch a Convert was loſt thro' a Failure in ſome <hi>Punctilio</hi>'s in his Reception. Archbiſhop <hi>S—ft</hi> was no leſs than a downright <hi>Whigg,</hi> when he demanded the Keys of the <hi>Tower</hi> from <hi>Sk—n.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Examples of this Kind are infinite, and therefore let no Man be ſtartled, when I tell him that every <hi>Tory</hi> of Eminence has been a <hi>Whigg,</hi> at a convenient Time, tho' the Reproach is not convertible: How the Complection of the Kingdom came to change, and from this Unanimity againſt <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Tyranny</hi> the People ſplit into different Intereſts, and have all along ſerv'd the Enemies of our Country and Religion, in the Quality of Auxiliaries, is no great labour to rehearſe.</p>
            <p>Tho', upon the Exit of King <hi>James,</hi> the the whole Nation ſeem'd to Centre in one Perſwaſion, and with a General voice pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd

King <hi>William</hi> their Deliverer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Majority run ſo ſtrong on his ſide; yet ſeveral Miſchievous Paſſions lay brooding, in Deſigning men, till they ſaw how far the Opportunity might be improv'd to their reſpective Intereſts. The Sticklers for a Regency, dazzled with the Image of Royalty, kept fair with the Times, in hopes, that if their Schemes ſucceeded, they ſhould be powerfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to the Guardianſhip of the Realm; But that Project once blaſted, the Senſe of the Deliverance ſoon cool'd in their Thoughts, and a Diſguſt at the Eſtabliſhment took place of it.</p>
            <p>Others over-bearing themſelves upon ſome ſlight Merit in the Proceeding Reign, and who challeng'd their former Poſts as their Right, not finding their Expectations anſwer'd, ſoon fell into Diſcontent, and endeavour'd to Blacken the <hi>Revolution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Body, deeply involv'd in Guilt, and whoſe Crimes, in a leſs Merciful hand then King <hi>William</hi>'s, could not have been paſs'd over with Impunity, thought by double Application, to merit a Pardon; but once finding the danger paſt, return'd to their former Violence, and meditated freſh Miſchief.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:1160701300:11"/>A different Claſs, who expected the Adminiſtration to be lodg'd in ſome pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Hands, and all others excluded from Truſt, finding the Kings Favours extenſive to good Men of all Perſwaſions, ſoon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got the amicable Temper they had boaſted of whilſt the Storm was threatening their <hi>Liberties</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> and rang'd themſelves with the other Malecontents.</p>
            <p>Theſe fiery Tempers rendring themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves obnoxious to the State, by the Violence of their Proceedings, made Religion the Stalking Horſe to their <hi>Ambition</hi> and <hi>Revenge.</hi> From theſe Narrow and ſelfiſh Principles they form'd a Separate Body, under the Character of <hi>Rigid Churchmen,</hi> who made it their Buſineſs to oppoſe the <hi>Moderate,</hi> in all their Undertakings for the good of the Publick; and to ſhow their mortal Averſion to any Offers from the other ſide, went roundly into all Meaſures deſtructive of <hi>Liberty</hi> and the <hi>Proteſtant Intereſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With theſe Factious Spirits, not a few of the Clergy joyn'd; who, after taking a Premeditate Oath of <hi>Allegiance</hi> to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, caſt about how to excuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from Perjury, and ſerve King <hi>William</hi> with an Half-Fac'd Devotion, by trumping up the Diſtinction of a King <hi>De Jure</hi> and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1160701300:12"/>
               <hi>De Facto.</hi> This curſed Diſtinction gave Riſe to all the after Plots and Violences deſign'd upon his Royal Perſon; and how they will be able to acquit themſelves from the Blood of thoſe poor miſtaken Wretches, who dy'd for the Intended Aſſaſſination, muſt be left (as one of their own Black Prophets Magiſterially concludes) to an Higher Tribunal.</p>
            <p>From theſe various Impulſes, perſonal Diſguſts, and Miſcarriage of vain Hopes, the firſt Seeds of Contention ſprung, which being Cheriſh'd by too indulgent Beams from the Throne, grew up to Rankneſs, and diffus'd their Suckers thro' the whole Land. Had a few of the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt been cut down in time, before they had gather'd ſuch an Head, or been De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barr'd of the Vital Nouriſhment of State Places and Preferments, we had not at this time been plagu'd with their bane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Influences. But the Settlement was then in its Infancy, and Clemency being one of the King's chiefeſt Attributes, the Malignity, inſtead of being Cur'd by gentle Applications, grew Epidemical; when all theſe Humours were a-float, Good-Nature, Humanity, Religion, and a Senſe of Liberty were born down by the ſeveral guſts of Paſſion and Revenge.

The Days of their ancient Slavery were magnify'd; and the memorable Redemption in Eighty Eight was laid in the Duſt. But when no Blemiſh could be fix'd upon the Adminiſtration, they brought out their <hi>Old Idol,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> Bleeding, and in a deſperate Condition; and giving out, that <hi>Preſbytery</hi> was coming in like a Torrent, tho' the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Promotions were under the Direction of thoſe very Prelates, who had equally ſignaliz'd themſelves againſt <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Preſbytery.</hi> It would puzzle a Man of the niceſt Penetration to account for the Actions of theſe Madmen: Nay, even when the Game was entirely in their own Hands, they ſuſpected foul Play, and murmur'd at the <hi>Legal Indulgences,</hi> which others thought themſelves ſufficiently hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in. Of ſo Uſurping a Nature is this <hi>Tory-Monſter,</hi> that nothing but a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopoly of Wealth, Favour, and Intereſt, can glut his ravenous Appetite: The Pride and Oppreſſion that is intermix'd with the Blood and Spirits of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive Race, ſtifles all Acts of Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in them, and makes them, by Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy, love <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Tyranny</hi> for the ſake of Perſecuting in their ſubordinate Stations. But to draw the Scene cloſer: Tho' all theſe Sparks of Rancour and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1160701300:14"/>
againſt the preſent Eſtabliſhment glow'd warm in the Breaſts of theſe reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Animals, yet they had the Decency to ſmother them till the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion in the Illuſtrious Houſe of <hi>Hanover</hi> was fix'd by Parliament: Then the Flame took Vent; all their Paſſions blaz'd; and every Tongue was ſet on Fire.</p>
            <p>Before that Time, a <hi>Jacobite</hi> was of no great Importance in the Eye of the People; he had a Mark ſet upon him, and ſhunn'd by all who had the Welfare of their Country at Heart: In all Publick Debates, the Leading Men who favour'd that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and were qualify'd by Law to do Miſchief, were very tender of Pointing out the Subject of their Grievances on this Side, or the Object of their ſincereſt Wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es on the other Side of the Water: It was a Point of too much Delicacy to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly handled, and therefore the beſt Service they could do their Colleagues, the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> was by indirect Means, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Fetches, and Thwarting the Publick Spirited Attempts of all true <hi>Proteſtant Britons.</hi> Beſides, the Succeſſion, before that Act, being precarious after the Demiſe of our preſent Queen, (if they could have commanded their Tempers to wait ſo long) kept them up in fluſh Hopes, that during
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1160701300:15"/>
the Conſternation, they might have a fair Chance for Accompliſhing their Wiſhes: This notable Scheme of theirs was fully explain'd, when they were brought to the <hi>Teſt</hi> of Voting For or Againſt the Clauſe in Favour of the <hi>Hanover Succeſſion</hi>; for maugre all their Attempts to ſtifle this Home Charge againſt them, and the printed Vindication of the <hi>Tory</hi> Members from any Suggeſtion of that Kind, the beſt Part of the Apology is altogether Sophiſtical and Evaſive; for tho', in Point of Logical Truth, they did not divide upon the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Amendment ſent down by the Lords, in Order to ſtrengthen the Intereſt of that Auguſt Family; and upon which the chief Streſs of the Debate lay, yet the whole Management lay open to half an Eye.</p>
            <p>The prime Leaders Propoſing to give as little Offence as might be upon ſo tender a Point, went artificially to Work, and try'd the Force of Numbers upon the firſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment. That being carry'd againſt them, and being not of equal Importance with the ſecond, which made it Treaſon for any one to oppoſe that Succeſſion after the Demiſe of the Queen, they were afraid of Alaruming ſome of their own Party, who were unwarily drawn into the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1160701300:16"/>
firſt Diſagreement, and therefore had no great Stomach to divide upon the ſecond Amendment, it not being uſual for the weaker Side, upon Loſing a previous Queſtion, to divide upon a ſubſequent Clauſe intermix'd with the ſame Debate; ſo that if may be without any Breach of Charity, or Straining of Inferences, from the whole Courſe of the Debate; that they were againſt all the Amendments, tho' they only divided upon the firſt: If they had been ſincere for the Intereſt of the <hi>Hanover</hi> Line, why did they not readily come into all the Proviſional Securities for the Safety of that Illuſtrious Houſe? Or rather, why did they inſiſt on the Danger of Multiplying Treaſons, and Aggravating the Inconveniencies that might ariſe from new Treaſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It's plain from that Minute the <hi>Pretender</hi> was in open View. If the firſt Act for Settling the Succeſſion in the Houſe of <hi>Hanover</hi> prompted them to curſe that Legacy of King <hi>William,</hi> this ſtrengthening Act tranſported them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Meaſure; and ſince that Time they have not labour'd to conceal their Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. It was a very faſhionable Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I remember, at the Beginning of this Reign, <hi>viz. Retrieving the Honour of the</hi> English <hi>Nation.</hi> What Honour had been
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1160701300:17"/>
loſt to the Nation, we know at whoſe Doors to lay the Waſte: Indeed <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Power</hi> had been very much diſcountenanced in King <hi>William</hi>'s Reign, and every Man enjoy'd a compleat <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Liberty</hi>; ſo that, the Meaning of that Phraze could ſignify nothing, except Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving the exploded Topick of Divine Tyranny of former Days, and all the Slaviſh Poſitions under which the Nation agoniz'd for ſome Ages. But they made their Court wrong, and in the Reign of a Princeſs who, from her firſt Acceſſion to the Throne, declar'd how much ſhe had the Eaſe and Liberty of her People at Heart. It was hop'd, that under an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration they ſo much long'd for, theſe reſtleſs Spirits might have been compos'd, and fallen into a true <hi>Engliſh Intereſt,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Influence of ſuch an Example. But three Years were ſcarce elaps'd, when they revil'd the Perſon whom they former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call'd their Stay and Support, libelled a <hi>Proteſtant Miniſtry,</hi> attack'd the Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, and roſe to all the Outrage of Threats and ill Language. Could an Enemy explain their Meaning to more Diſadvantage than they themſelves did upon theſe Occaſions? Was it not a plain Indication of the Intereſt they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1160701300:18"/>
in? They quarrel'd with King <hi>William</hi> for his over-weaning Love to <hi>Preſbytery</hi>; they ſpoke diſreſpectfully of the preſent Queen, for no other Reaſon but being too affectionate to the True Church: Who then could be the Perſon in view, that they thought would Support them better? Or what Church was it they Complain'd was not Supported? The Church of <hi>England,</hi> during theſe Complaints, was ſupply'd with Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox and Learned Prelates; the Queen had been Beneficent to a Prodigy. There was no Innovation ſo much as attempted, but all Diſcipline enforc'd with as much Zeal as the Times would bear: Well, then it's plain they had always another Church than that of <hi>England</hi>; and another Intereſt in view, which they expected ſhould ſupport their Authority by Arbitrary Meaſures.</p>
            <p>This is what that Virulent Faction has always aim'd at, and never can, by their Principles, be Cordial Subjects to any Prince, who will not go the ſame deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Lengths they chalk out. And Let them Skin over their Reſentments never ſo fair, they cannot, by their Complection, accord with the true Genius of <hi>England, For they are either Rebels in Diſgrace: Or</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:1160701300:19"/>
               <hi>too Arbitrary for the Conſtitution, when once in Power.</hi> When we have abounded with ſuch a Set of Men for many Ages paſt, I wonder how the Conſtitution has been kept together; and it ſtill heightens my Surprize, that theſe Principles <hi>acuated,</hi> ſince the Revolution, by Diſguſts, and confirm'd Antipathies, have not left us a Prey to every bold Invader.</p>
            <p>Our Enemies wanted not Information, how looſe <hi>they</hi> have always ſat to the Government for ſome Years, even under the Reſtraint of a Triple Oath, and that when their Paſſions boil High: They ſtick at neither Honour, Conſcience, or Boſom Friendſhip, to ſatiate their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. But if any thing has contributed to our Preſervation from <hi>Popery,</hi> and <hi>Slavery,</hi> it is that our Enemies could not depend upon that Party's being Conſtant to any one Principle; ſo that their <hi>Malice</hi> has been render'd leſs Formidable by their Inſtability: If this was not ſome ſort of Security to us, the many open and tacite Invitations that have been given to the PRETENDER, would not have been neglected.</p>
            <p>As the Succeſſion in the <hi>Proteſtant Line</hi> was the greateſt Obſtacle to their Dear <hi>Minion,</hi> the <hi>Pretender</hi>'s Intruſion, ſo all

the hopes of that Party Centring in the little Practiſings they were able to carry on in the Courſe of a ſingle Life, they were reſolv'd to looſe no Time in the Proſecution of their dire Attempt: But becauſe the Topick was a little too harſh for any man to ſupport, under any plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Character, they pitch'd upon one under Legal Diſabilities to begin the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel. As that Piquering ſucceeded, they reſolv'd to manage the Combat. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly one ſpawn'd out of the vileſt Bog in the whole Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> was deputed to try the Force of his Arguments upon the Succeſſion: Whether he kept pace with his Maſter's Sentiments upon every head he was pleas'd to deſcant on, we have no Warrant; but it's plain, that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Matter of the Paper was a continued Thread of <hi>Treaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Uſurpation</hi> of King <hi>William</hi> was the leaſt Concern in the Queſtion: His Reign, and the pretended Calamities, which had attended the Revolution, were but only Incidents of the Tragedy that had been acted. The <hi>Queen</hi> herſelf was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd an <hi>Uſurper</hi>; and with this Salvo, <hi>That ſhe did well to hold the Crown, for her Life, in order to deliver it to the Righteous Heir's Poſſeſſion.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:1160701300:21"/>This bold Charge paſs'd with Impunity; and even when it was offer'd to try the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity of that pretended Truſt, in Oppoſition to the Claim of the Illuſtrious Houſe of <hi>Hanover,</hi> a good Witneſs is not wanting to prove, that a Firſt Miniſter of State in Being at that time, turn'd cooly off from the Repreſentation: I ſhall not run over ſome aggravating Circumſtances, which, impartially conſider'd, involv'd ſome peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of pretended Merit in the ſame Guilt with the Author.</p>
            <p>Theſe Trayterous Poſitions, ſtrengthen'd by Impunity, daily gain'd ground upon weak Tempers; and the Countenance vaſt Numbers of the Clergy gave to thoſe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Reaſons, made People receive them with leſs Horrour: And whenever any Perplexities happen'd to ariſe from a Point of that high and nice Nature, they were ſo far from leſſening them to the Intereſt of the preſent Eſtabliſhment, that they rather multiply'd Doubts; ſtill Conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with an Eye to the <hi>Pretender, that Right would take Place at laſt:</hi> But leaſt theſe Inſinuations ſhould fail of having a due Effect upon the People, they exceeded all Common Meaſures of Impudence, and would fain have perſwaded the World that the Queen was Joining in a Plot againſt
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1160701300:22"/>
herſelf, her Crown and Dignity; and covertly approv'd their Sentiments, under the Notion of a ſecret and reveal'd Will.</p>
            <p>This, tho' whiſper'd here, took freer Vent in a Neighbouring Kingdom, and oblig'd one of the Miniſters of State to oppoſe and condemn ſo Baſe and Treaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable a Suggeſtion in a Publick Speech. It almoſt ſurpaſſes Belief, that thoſe very Men who had taken all the ſolemn Oaths the Prudence of the Nation could enact, ſhould break them and run into all the Exceſſes and deſperate Notions of the moſt flagrant Papiſt or Nonjurer; but as their Familiarity with Oaths had render'd them inconſiderable, ſo, when the Abjuration of the <hi>Pretender</hi> came to be taken, they were ſo far from Heſitating about it, that (tho' there was no Room in the Oath left for Inſincerity, and few ſuſpected Perſons were thought capable of abiding ſo <hi>ſtrong a Teſt</hi>) they came into it readily, with this <hi>Jeſuitical Salvo, That the Abjuration of any Right the</hi> Pretender <hi>might lay Claim to, was to be conſtru'd barely as Reſpecting his Legal Right; but that his</hi> Divine, <hi>or</hi> Birth-Right, <hi>was no ways vacated by that Oath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As it is impoſſible to guard againſt ſuch horrid Diſtinctions, by the moſt binding
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1160701300:23"/>
Form of Words, ſo this formal Renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Pretender</hi>'s Right, ſerv'd only to confirm thoſe in their Zeal for his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, who made it with that ſaving Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction: This came to a full Proof, when the firſt News of the <hi>Pretender</hi>'s Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition reach'd us. One might then have read in the Countenances of theſe Men, how much they were elated with the Proſpect of that Enterprize. One might then have heard them explain themſelves without the leaſt Reſerve or Caution, and congratulate each other upon their having prevaricated with the Government fo often for the Promotion of their <hi>Good Old Cauſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> Court at that Time was ſo well inform'd of the Diſpoſitions of theſe Men, as not to doubt of Numbers, who openly Pray'd and Acted for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, appearing in Vindication of that <hi>Abjur'd Right.</hi> The ſeveral Projects for Diſtreſſing the State, were as faithfully, as maliciouſly executed, by Endeavouring to make a Bankrupty of the publick Cheſt, whilſt the Rampant Clergy were buſy in Diſ-arming the <hi>Proteſtant Britons,</hi> by Preaching up <hi>Non-Reſiſtance</hi> to their Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Prince, in Oppoſition to their Legal one, as may be charitably collected from
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1160701300:24"/>
their notable Diſtinctions: It was not want of Vigilance or In-activity in the late <hi>Loyal</hi> and <hi>Proteſtant Miniſtry,</hi> of happy Memory, that made them retard the March of the Forces for the <hi>North,</hi> but a prudent Fore-ſight of the Diſtreſs which might have happen'd to this Part of the Government from Swarms of diſguis'd Enemies: There were too many, upon the Signals given from the <hi>Non-Reſiſting Leaders,</hi> prepar'd to <hi>Reſiſt</hi> according to their Senſe of the Doctrine; and upon the firſt Sound of the Trumpet in <hi>Sion,</hi> ready to mount. But their Hopes being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated by the precipitate Flight of the <hi>Pretender,</hi> it was no difficult Matter to gueſs how they would have acted upon a nearer Approach of Danger, by their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent Behaviour: For when all the <hi>Reſiſtance</hi> was paſt, which they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd up, the Pulpits, without any manner of Call, or Provocation from the Neceſſity of our Affairs, ſounded to Arms a-freſh, in their ironical <hi>Non-Reſiſting Cant,</hi> which, amongſt that Claſs of Men, is the uſual Watch-word for Rebellion. It's more than probable, that the Heads of the Faction were in Hopes of a ſecond Invaſion, and underſtood the firſt only as a Faint to try the Power of their Friends, and ſo were
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1160701300:25"/>
ſtill Practiſing with the People upon the old Topick, to keep up the Principle warm upon their Imaginations.</p>
            <p>When no Hopes appear'd from that Quarter, their next Attempt was made at Home; and flattering themſelves with a Majority of the Nation on their Side, they eſſay'd to do the Work amongſt themſelves, without the Help of any Auxiliaries from Abroad.</p>
            <p>Accordingly they pitch'd upon one of the moſt <hi>Common</hi> PROSTITUTES of Vertue and Modeſty, in the three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, (whoſe Memory will always be Sacred with the Admirers of <hi>Cain, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſtratus,</hi> and <hi>Guido Faux</hi>) to raiſe Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition upon the old <hi>Paſſive</hi> Topick. Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in their Opinion, were ſo ripe, that it was thought Loſs of Time to conceal their impious Deſigns upon the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo that, in plain Terms, this Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zan was appointed to fall directly upon the Government, defame the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and blacken the <hi>Revolution,</hi> with all the gallant Leaders concern'd in ſo <hi>Juſt</hi> and <hi>Evangelical</hi> a Work. Then the true Intent and Purport of this Myſterious Doctrine was obvious to every <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> when all the Arrows out of that Poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Quiver were levelled at the Queen,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1160701300:26"/>
who had ſo great an Hand in that bleſſed Change: Yet the Faction, with their uſual Impudence, would have faſten'd Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions upon the World, and made us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the Reſiſtance the Queen abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at that Time by her Gracious and uſeful Preſence, was fatal to her Title in its Conſequences, when that Caſe was urg'd with an Exception to the general Rule of <hi>Paſſive-Obedience,</hi> and never to be ſo much as attempted, but in the laſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitous Circumſtances, even no leſs than the entire Subverſion of the Conſtitution. But it's plain, the unlimited Obedience there preſs'd, could never be deſign'd to the preſent Queen, her Title ariſing out of the <hi>Revolution,</hi> which was founded in Reſiſtance, neither could it be any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement to lodge ſuch a Power with her, as ſhe was never fond of, ſhe Governing herſelf and Subjects, by the Laws of the Conſtitution. But the <hi>Pretender</hi> being in view, the Model of his Government was laid down, and recommended in that <hi>Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> way, he might be ſuppos'd to act; and by the Tenour of the Libel, even her Majeſty was as much caution'd againſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting the Lawful and Rightful Heir, as any of her Subjects.</p>
            <p>Still, whatever malignant Planet rul'd,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1160701300:27"/>
this impudent Prevarication met with Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, and what, in ſober Times, would have cover'd ſuch a Parricide with eternal Shame and Ignominy, gave him a larger Degree of Sufficiency than before, and turn'd to his Glory amongſt the poor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded Rabble.</p>
            <p>This Vein of <hi>Slavery</hi> and <hi>Jacobitiſm</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, after the <hi>merciful Award,</hi> the Faction ſtill kept feeding the popular Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, till at laſt they were neither afraid nor aſham'd to tell the World, that they could not be ſatisfy'd with any Title below the degree of <hi>Indefeaſible</hi> and <hi>Divine Right.</hi> Theſe Terms which were almoſt grown obſolete, were renew'd, and cramm'd into many publick Addreſſes. I ſhall paſs over the dubious Expreſſions, and plain Hints, which to every narrow Capacity ſeem ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious enough: In ſome Papers we find ſuch an uncontroulable Power devolv'd upon the Crown, which (tho' our Gracious Queen never ſhow'd the leaſt Diſpoſition towards Aſſuming) ſufficiently explains into what Hands the Faction is willing it ſhould fall. But amongſt all the late Demonſtrations of ardent Affection to the Queen, and preſent Eſtabliſhment, it's a little ſhocking, that ſome have been ſo hardy to approach her Majeſty without ſo much as the leaſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1160701300:28"/>
of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Succeſſion in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene Houſe of <hi>Hanover,</hi> which the Queen has, upon all Occaſions, profeſs'd ſhe has ſo much at Heart. If thoſe Perſons were ſincere in their Wiſhes for the Perpetuity of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> in theſe Kingdoms, a ſmall Clauſe in Favour of that Houſe, could not well be omitted on a Subject which ſo naturally leads to it: Indeed SMUT, the <hi>Examiner,</hi> who has commenc'd Guide to ſome inferiour Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, has given in his Verdict very learnedly upon this Head, and looks upon the Mention of that Auguſt Houſe as Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a ſort of Epitaph upon the Perſon in Poſſeſſion: But, under Favour, I think that may be fil'd amongſt the reſt of his Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: For certainly no Repetition of that kind can be ungrateful to a Perſon whoſe chiefeſt Glory it is to lodge ſo ſacred a Pledge in the Hands of a Family that will be ſure to deliver it down pure and uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted to Poſterity.</p>
            <p>As her Majeſty is the Parent of her Country, and indeed the Nurſing Mother of the <hi>Proteſtant Cauſe,</hi> ſo it muſt be a Pleaſure to one of her tender Sentiments, to think and hear that the Political Child, as well as the Religious Intereſt of her Country, is likely to be ſo well provided
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1160701300:29"/>
for, and ſecur'd in the Hands of ſo Good and Illuſtrious a Race. And where-ever that petty Scribler has learn'd his Politicks, he really diſſerves his <hi>Popiſh Cauſe</hi> by ſuch weak Inſinuations: It's in a manner Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſting her of that Compaſſion for the Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of her People, which is ſo natural to her, it's no leſs than Sowing Jealouſy amongſt her Subjects, as if ſhe did not care to hear that Family mention'd: It's running count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to her Majeſty's Sentiments, who has always that Family at Heart; and can the Mention of any Thing that lyes ſo near one's Heart, give any Pain or Uneaſineſs? No ſure, rather pleaſe the Ear, and gratify the Spirits; and tho' the Diſlike to that Great Family appears but too open, yet, methinks, in pure Deference to her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Eſteem of it, at leaſt a cool Mention might be made of the Name; but their Averſion being unconquerable, and the Bent of their Souls lying ſo ſtrong to another Intereſt, they cannot put on ſo much as a ſpecious Diſguiſe upon their Rancour, but openly wearing the Livery of <hi>Leſly</hi>'s <hi>Good Old Cauſe,</hi> pray that the Scepter may late drop into the Hands of the Rightful and Lawful Succeſſor, which ſeems to be of no difficult Interpretation; with many other curious Phrazes too long to enumerate.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1160701300:30"/>
If after this, we ſhould reckon up the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famatory Libels, Side-Reflections, and open Aſperſions that have fallen from Pens and Mouths of the loweſt Rank againſt that <hi>Illuſtrious Houſe,</hi> and which have given juſt Occaſion of Complaint, they would ſwell a Volume; all which in their natural Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, raiſe mean Apprehenſions of that Family in the Minds of the People, alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate their Affections by degrees, and, in Conſequence, diſpoſe them to receive the <hi>Pretender.</hi> The Rigid <hi>Tories</hi> had ſome Difficulties in their way, which no ſober Man thought maſterable: It took them up ſome Time, and requir'd no ſmall Artifice to wean the Generality from the high Eſteem they entertain'd for the Houſe of <hi>Hanover:</hi> That Point once gain'd, they had other Obſtacles to get over, as Perſwading the World into a Belief of the Legitimacy of the <hi>Pretender,</hi> which the Party from Time to Time have attempted, by Re-printing the Depoſitions lodg'd in <hi>Chancery,</hi> and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving weak Anſwers to them, on purpoſe that Falſhood might have the Advantage of a good Light; crying up the Vigour of King <hi>James,</hi> and making wrong Inferences of the Young Chevalier's Legitimacy, from a freſh Impoſture, in the Perſon of a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, trump'd up ſince his Exile in <hi>France.</hi>

            <p>I ſhall not inſiſt upon the Penetration of the <hi>French</hi> Court, which, ſome time ſince, plainly ſaw where theſe Humours of the People where gathering, and occaſion'd the Dauphin's Complementing the late Queen <hi>Mary</hi> upon ſome wonderful Change working on this ſide in her Favour, but am ſorry the Prophecy ſeems ſo near at hand. The <hi>Pretender</hi>'s Health which us'd Formerly to be ſoftned with the Gloſs of univerſal Charity, or drank under ſome By-Name, ſcorns ſuch Reſerves at preſent, and triumphs in it's full Title. The <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Reign of King <hi>William</hi> ſcarce finds a room in the Royal Line of Succeſſion, but has been openly decry'd, for ſome Time, as a Succeſsful Uſurpation; nay to that high Pitch of Impudence has this <hi>Popiſh</hi> Faction lately arriv'd, as to interrupt the Publick Solemnizing that great Prince's Birth-Day, and the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Deliverance of theſe three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, nay even to inſult the Gentlemen, and almoſt demoliſh an honeſt <hi>Proteſtant</hi>

Vintner's Houſe in <hi>Grace-Church-Street:</hi> Had this been done only by a needy Rabble inſtigated by <hi>Popiſh</hi> Partizans, and <hi>French</hi> Money, it had been more excuſable; but when arm'd Authority appear'd, and, inſtead of diſcountenancing, joyn'd in with theſe foul Meaſures, it cannot but aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate our Fears, and make us conclude, that our ſafety depends upon a very Precarious Title, when thoſe who are the proper Guards againſt ſuch Inſolence, and ſhould appear active in Suppreſſing ſuch Riots, are the forwardeſt in Promoting them. But what will be ever remarkable upon this Occaſion, and no doubt fix a Double Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Honour upon the Head of a certain wiſe Magiſtrate, when Affairs once come to be impartially debated, is, that one of the Gentlemen who met to pay Honour to the Memory of the late King <hi>William,</hi> was aſk'd to find Security for his good Behaviour, and threaten'd to be bound over for ſo deſperate an attempt; whereas in doing leſs, he had been guilty of Ingratitude to his Royal Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor: But we are not at a loſs for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate and his Principles, and he who was openly charg'd upon the <hi>Pretender</hi>'s Invaſion, with making a Run upon the Bank, in order to ruin the National Credit, cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to have reform'd his Principles much ſince that time, or to act leſs-ſtrenuouſly in

Favour of a cauſe, at a juncture when there is no manner of neceſſity for clearing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from ſuch Imputations. It may, in a very little time, be reckon'd a mighty Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to mention the Name of King <hi>William</hi> in a dutiful manner, without Expoſing one's ſelf to the Reproach and Violence of the People; and if the Ring-leaders of the Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are able to ſupport the Spirit at preſent reigning in the Multitude to a convenient Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, it's probable they may have their long-expected Reſtoration of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,</hi> with as little Expence of Blood as in the late glorious <hi>Revolution</hi> we had our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from it. The ſeveral <hi>Jacobite Clubs</hi> which are ſaid to be ſet up in all Quarters of the Town, are chang'd from their firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Drinking Healths to the Impoſtor under feign'd Names: And at preſent are ſo many publick training Schools, where the Youth of the Nation are diſciplin'd into an Opinion of the Juſtice of his Title, and taught to compaſſionate his Sufferings, all the <hi>Arbitrary Proceedings</hi> of his ſuppos'd Father are repreſented in Fading Colours, the acts of Violence, and Encroachments upon the Civil and Religious Rights of the Nation are imputed to the Headineſs of a few <hi>Jeſuits</hi> in direct Oppoſition to the Natural Temper and Tenderneſs of King <hi>James</hi>; that the Queen Mother's Bloody and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1160701300:36"/>
Temper, (meaning King <hi>James</hi>'s Conſort) is very much moderated by her paſt Sufferings, and the whole Court is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to conduct Affairs by more temperate Maxims: In fine, that the King (in the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> Account, a Notorious Baſtard) has ſo true a Scheme of the Diſpoſition of his Loving Subjects, as never to bear upon the Laws or the Mildneſs of a Conſtitution they have been accuſtom'd to, and that having his Grand-Father's and Father's Sufferings always in his Eye, he is reſolv'd only to aſſert his own Hereditary Right, and never to diſpute any mans Legal one.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Baits by which the <hi>Popiſh Faction</hi> enſnare the Youth who never ſaw the approaching Dangers before the <hi>Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,</hi> and think them much magnify'd by the Spleen of a malignant Party, with which, all in that curſed Intereſt aſperſe the true <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of the Kingdom, and even thoſe who were Eye-Witneſſes to the Oppreſſion of former Days, have, thro' an Eaſe and Plenty of above 20 Years ſtanding, grown ſo forgetful and cold in their Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of thoſe <hi>Outrages</hi> which were daily of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to <hi>Proteſtants</hi> by the <hi>Miſſionaries</hi> in <hi>Black</hi> and <hi>Red,</hi> that they expreſs very little Diſlike of ſeeing that diſmal Scene acted over again.</p>

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1160701300:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the whole Nation, as to be, humanly ſpeaking, Proof againſt the moſt Sovereign <hi>Antidotes</hi>; and tho' it is ſcarce poſſible to trace the Source of this great Evil thro' the ſeveral intricate Valves and ſmall Vaſſels it runs, yet we cannot be ſo blind as not to diſcover it receives a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply from Men of a better Figure, and way of Thinking, than are to be met with amongſt the middle Claſs of Mankind.</p>
            <p>It's happy for this Nation at preſent, that we have ſuch a Pure, Orthodox, and True <hi>Church of England</hi> Adminiſtration to ballance the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Inclination to <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery</hi>; and ſtem the Majority of ſo many wicked Tempers: It muſt be an Argument of great Circumſpection in Men of ſuch high Characters, if they eſcape falling under the Laſh of ſuch virulent Tongues and Pens, and are not maliciouſly brought in as Abetting the Deſigns of this <hi>Popiſh Faction</hi>; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have gone ſuch a length in their courſe of Impudence, ſome Time ſince, as to give out, That the Queen ſecretly favour'd their wicked Enterprizes, grounding their impious Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, without Diſpute, upon her Royal Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, and their own Impunity. It is no great Complement at this Time to the Men in Power, neither do I believe they would be at all pleas'd, that ſo many of the <hi>Jacobite Party</hi> ſhould aſſume to themſelves ſo much upon the late Changes, or that they are every Day en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging their Proſpect from the preſent Poſture of Affairs. One would be tempted to think, by their Confidence, that they had receiv'd ſome Aſſurances from the <hi>Great,</hi> but the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of ſuch a vigilant and faithful Miniſtry ſecures all good People from any Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which might otherwiſe ariſe from the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frontery
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1160701300:38"/>
of ſo daring a Faction: For we are told by the Author of the <hi>Review,</hi> and that is an Authority not to be queſtion'd, That if Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will be quiet and ſet eaſy under this Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, there is no Fear of the <hi>Pretender</hi>; but that if they will compaſs Sea and Land, and even go to the Centre, in Order to ruin it, then, according to the Principles of Fleſh and Blood, the Miniſtry will, in all Likelyhood, make the beſt Terms to ſecure themſelves. But let our Hopes from the Men in Power be never ſo well grounded, and the Expectations of the <hi>Jacobite Faction</hi> never ſo vain, yet it becomes eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> at this Hour, to conſider upon what a tickliſh Bottom he is like to ſtand upon, from the Activity and Inſolence of that Party; and it ought likewiſe to put him upon his Guard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt being unwarily drawn into their wicked Aſſociations under ſpecious Pretences, to the Ruin of his Liberty, Religion, and Conſcience. That idle Pretence of the <hi>Church's</hi> Danger has been lately made the Handle to <hi>Confuſion</hi>; I wiſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that <hi>Notion</hi> has throughly ſpent it ſelf, it does not accompliſh the Deſtruction of the State: For the cunning Managers of the <hi>Jacobite Intereſt</hi> will keep up that plauſible Topick till the Danger is juſt at hand, and after having made an irreconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable Diviſion amongſt <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of all Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, will urge Perſeverance to thoſe who have been led away by them from the true <hi>Proteſtant</hi> and <hi>National Intereſt</hi>; and from the Extremities they have reduc'd them to, will propoſe a total <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> as the only Expedient left for <hi>Safety,</hi> and Probation of their Merit upon a Change.</p>
            <p>It's plain, to a Demonſtration, that the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> ever ſince the 12th of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> have been playing the <hi>Rigid Church men</hi> againſt the <hi>Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants</hi>

of a more capacious Faith and Charity, and from thoſe Split Intereſts have been near upon the point of determining the Controverſies, and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing up all Diſtinctions between <hi>Proteſtants:</hi> But ſince, within theſe few Years, the ſober and diſcreet Part of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> (which are the true and lively Ornaments of it) duly weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the National Intereſt of this Kingdom, both in Church and State, and ſeriouſly reflecting on the Cauſes of our unhappy Diviſions, have fallen into Comprehenſive Meaſures and a Primitive Temper of Forbearance; theſe <hi>Rigid Spirits</hi> have have ſet themſelves at open Defiance with the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate,</hi> and drawn off ſo wide from the <hi>Proteſtant Intereſt,</hi> that they are become the moſt virulent of the <hi>Popiſh Faction:</hi> It therefore behoves every <hi>Proteſtant Briton</hi> to guard timely againſt the wicked Inſinuations of theſe Men, who cry up the <hi>Hereditary Right</hi> of the <hi>Pretender,</hi> and come to this undeniable Maxim, That even upon a Suppoſition that this Impoſtor was the Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Son of King <hi>James</hi>; the Nation is involv'd in leſs guilt by keeping him out then by receiving him upon the moſt plauſible Terms and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, becauſe the <hi>Pretended</hi> or even the <hi>Real Right</hi> of one man, after ſo many bloo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
