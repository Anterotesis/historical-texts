            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE great reputation which Dr. <hi>Hoffman</hi> has deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquired by his ſuperior abilities and long experience in his profeſſion, has made his writings univerſally known and eſteemed by the learned.</p>
            <p>This treatiſe being intended for general uſe, he has wrote with more plainneſs, and with as few terms of ſcience as poſſible, to render it generally uſeful, as the ſubject he
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0209101800:5"/>treats of is proper for every one to be acquainted with, whoſe ſtate of health hath required the uſe of this common and almoſt univerſal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>
            <p>WE thought it would not be amiſs to prefix the opinions of thoſe eminent phyſicians, Dr. <hi>Moffett,</hi> Mr. <hi>Lemery,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Arbuthnot,</hi> on the ſame ſubject, which we have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here adjoined, all which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm and ſtrengthen the ſentiments of Dr. <hi>Hoffman</hi> in this treatiſe.</p>
            <p>DR. MOFFETT in his treatiſe of foods, ſays, <q>"Aſſes milk is an eſpecial cure for that ſort of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0209101800:6"/>wherein the fleſh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayeth through ulceration of the lungs and breathing parts; it is both meat and medicine, cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and nouriſhing alike, not ſo thin as to hinder expectoration, nor ſo thick as to cauſe condenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the matter putrified, but being of a middle temper and conſiſtence, and conſequently moſt proper for that diſeaſe. A middle age Aſs's milk is the beſt. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing got ſuch a one, ſhut her from her foal four or five hours before you uſe her milk, let her be well curried, leſt her ſkin, growing foul, ill vapours be encreaſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, for want of perſpiration.
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0209101800:7"/>Feed her with grinded malt-ſtraw dried, mingled with a little ſweet fennel-ſeed, annis, or carraway-ſeeds, which ſhe will eat with great pleaſure, and digeſt into a ſweet and wholeſome blood. An hour after that milk her as near the patient as you can, that it may be drank before the air hath alter'd it; for if it be once cold it is not wholeſome. This may be done twice a day, morning and evening, upon an empty ſtomach, neither eating or drinking after it for two hours: You may ſweeten it with ſugar-candy, ſugar of roſes, or fine honey, and it will be more effectual. In winter let her
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0209101800:8"/>be fed with the ſweeteſt meadow hay."</q>

            <p>MR. LEMERY in his treatiſe on foods, ſays, <q>"Aſſes milk, as to its conſiſtence and virtues, is much like that of a woman; it is much uſed as a remedy againſt the phthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick and other diſorders of the lungs, and being like woman's milk, is of a qualifying nature, is beneficial in the cure of pim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, the defluxions of the eyes, and to eaſe the pains of the gout."</q>

            <head>A TREATISE OF THE Extraordinay Virtues and Effects of ASSES MILK.</head>
            <p>THOSE who have had a long and careful experience in the practice of phyſic, have a better opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity than the reſt of mankind of obſerving that the plaineſt ſorts of remedies, thoſe which are moſt readily prepared, and as it were at hand in every family, are highly preferable to all kinds of compounds, and artificial mixtures of drugs whatſoever; not only in regard to the ſafety in uſing them, but likewiſe in their real virtue and efficacy; whether they be intended to thoroughly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due, or put a timely ſtop to all the various kinds of diſeaſes.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0209101800:11"/>
            <p>IF we diligently reviſe the beſt writings of phyſicians in the earlieſt ages, we ſhall find that they met with greater ſucceſs, and wrought more cures with the moſt ſimple and eaſy medicines, ſuch as are quite agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to nature, ſuch as only require a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation in diet, and have a greater ſhare of nouriſhment than of phyſic in them, than the chemiſts of later times can effect with their ineſtimable ſecrets, and ſubtle compoſitions, produced by the force of fire. For all theſe, unleſs adminiſtered with the niceſt care and diſcretion, inſtead of doing ſervice, are ſure to do much miſchief; and therefore muſt be eſteemed very dangerous, and far leſs eligible than thoſe family reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that may be uſed without any hazard at all.</p>
            <p>UNDOUBTEDLY the refined art of che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry, which brings to light the various mixtures and properties of natural ſubſtances, deſerves a very great and peculiar degree of admiration; and the experiment is very ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing of the chemiſts, who are able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the ſufferings of their patients with a few drops only, or a very ſmall pill: yet
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0209101800:12"/>when the larger or more plentiful prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of what are called Galenical medicines are rejected, when no regard is ſhewn to the ſafe aſſiſtance of regulated diets, ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by the antients, and medicines altogether chemical, are almoſt univerſally uſed againſt all diſeaſes; the effect is, that the practice of phyſic is become far more dangerous in our days, than it was formerly, and gets diſcredit by more frequent inſtances of the loſs of patients. For my own part, I was always guided by the following rule; that the only way to gain a happy and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful method in the healing art, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to unite theory with practice, the experience of the antients with that of the moderns, and Galenical and domeſtic reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies with chemical. For I have diſcovered by a long improved experience, that reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which have blended in them the powers of both nouriſhment and phyſic, and are therefore pleaſant and refreſhing to the frame of our bodies, are not only the ſafeſt, but the moſt efficacious in the cure and preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of diſeaſes. And it is undeniable that the uſe and propereſt method of adminiſtring theſe, is more exactly to be learnt from the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0209101800:13"/>remains of the antients authors, than from the works of the moderns, or even of ſuch of the moderns as have plainly a fondneſs and partiality for the antients.</p>
            <p>ONE of the moſt eminent and diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inſtances of what I thus aſſert is Aſſes milk: which, indeed, was ſtrenuouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by the antient phyſicians, and eſteemed of ſovereign benefit in rooting out the obſtinate remains of the moſt grievous diſtempers; yet moſt of our later phyſicians, in other reſpects men of high repute, are very ignorant of its moſt excellent quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and therefore were either ſo cautious, as ſeldom to introduce into their practice this deſirable promoter of health, or actually were afraid to uſe it at all. In the following treatiſe therefore I intend, by fair and juſt arguments, founded on an extenſive expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, to ſet forth all the admirable virtues of Aſſes milk, which have ſo long been ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely forgotten and unknown.</p>
            <p>BUT before we come immediately to the ſubject, it is not improper previouſly to ſhew in general, that all milk is a ſort of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0209101800:14"/>food that has a ſingular medicinal virtue belonging to it, without conſidering its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable nouriſhing quality; which very weighty reaſons ſhould recommend its being medicinally uſed. That milk has this nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritive quality, muſt I think be readily al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by all, as it appears conſtantly to every man, by his own experience, to be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly conſtituted and adapted to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of our bodies. The unborn child, while yet incloſed in the womb, grows and is nouriſhed by milk, which is prepared for it in the ſtructure of the ſecundines. When it is born, it acquires ſtill additional firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from a ſupply of milk; is gradually wrought up to its perfect form; and all its inward parts gain ſo much more ſtrength in proportion as they are able to alter and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt whatever food they take in, and reduce them to the milky juice called <hi>chyle.</hi> Laſtly, every man, ſo long as he remains alive, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives his whole nouriſhment and vigour from chyle, which is extracted from the food digeſted and diſſolved, and is in truth no other than milk. It is milk that ſupplies the principles and materials, not of the blood
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0209101800:15"/>alone, but of all the fluids that cheriſh and ſuſtain life.</p>
            <p>SINCE then milk is ſo manifeſtly proved to be the principal of all the kinds of ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſo it may be deſervedly reckoned the chief of all remedies. Which, though it may not ſeem clear and evident to others, may be proved to demonſtration with very little difficulty. To begin then with expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, the beſt instructor in all things, and what is ſuperior to all the moſt refined ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations.</p>
            <p>No man, that has cultivated ever ſo ſlight an acquaintance with the medicinal art, can be ignorant that the milk of almoſt all ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals has a very powerful and marvellous efficacy in tempering, ſubduing, and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing the force of the ſtrongeſt poiſons, whether they come from the kingdom of minerals, animals, or plants, eſpecially thoſe of a corroſive kind, that are moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for fatal execution. And ſo great is this efficacy, that any perſon, who has taken poiſon, by a ſeaſonable uſe of milk in a proper method and quantity, will be ſure to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0209101800:16"/>eſcape immediate death, and recover perfect health. On which account it may be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably queſtioned, whether there be any more ready and prevalent antidote to be found in the whole works of nature. And the moſt antient and early writers in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine both knew and deſcribed the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain virtue of milk againſt poiſons. <hi>Dioſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcorides,</hi> the moſt ancient writer concerning the <hi>Materia Medica,</hi> ſays, that milk, if freſh and new, is ſerviceable againſt corroſions and inflammations occaſioned by deadly poiſons, ſuch as cantharides, pityocampa, ſalamandra, or bupreſte, orpiment, dorycnium, aconite, or ephemeron. And <hi>Pliny</hi> repeats almoſt the very ſame account.</p>
            <p>IF we enquire into the treatment of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes themſelves, it will appear that milk was frequently and ſucceſsfully employed againſt them, from numberleſs teſtimonies and examples to be found in many late au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, in common with thoſe antient physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians <hi>Hippocrates, Galen, Celſus,</hi> and the <hi>Arabian</hi> writers. This will be more largely illuſtrated when we proceed to the ſubject of aſſes milk. At preſent let it ſuffice to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0209101800:17"/>produce what we read in <hi>Martian,</hi>
               <q>"That heretofore milk was eſteemed the ſacred anchor and foundation of all remedies: ſo that there was ſcarce any diſtemper in which milk was not made uſe of."</q> The ſame is atteſted by <hi>Jo. Jac. Wepfer,</hi> an eminent author, and noble ornament of the faculty among the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
               <q>"There is ſurely ſome divine quality belonging to milk. Formerly I could not have believed it, had I not had convincing experience of it. Mine own eyes have ſeen men intirely renewed by it. For by a diſcreet uſe of it, multitudes have acquired a ſounder conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, more hale complexion, and greater ſtrength of body."</q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT though the milk that is generally uſed in the medicinal way, is that of the common domeſtick ſorts of animals, as cows, ſheep, and goats; yet aſſes milk is by far the moſt efficacious, and its virtues in phyſic exceed thoſe of every other ſpecies ſo much, that no ſort of remedy is to be diſcovered ſo ſafe, and ſo powerful in its effects. For this, taken at ſeaſonable times, in due quantities, and with a proper regimen, gives eminent
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0209101800:18"/>relief to ſuch as are afflicted with phthiſics, hectics, conſumption and ſlow conſuming fevers, chronical coughs, and a ſcorbutic atrophy, hypochondriac and hyſteric diſorders, cramps, ulcers in the bowels, and diſeaſes that proceed from a ſaline acrid eroſion. This consideration induced me to fix upon this ſort of milk, above all others, for the ſubject of my obſervations, in order to ſet forth its powers and properties, to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate its uſefulneſs, and confirm it by teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonies and examples.</p>
            <p>IN the firſt place, we muſt aſſign the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why Aſſes milk is to be preferred in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, before that of other creatures. Which may be done in a more convincing and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory manner, if we previouſly lay down ſome certain ſtated propoſitions, concerning the compoſition of milk, and thoſe ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients which are the foundation of all its operations. It is univerſally known that milk conſiſts of three different ſubſtances, each of which has a different quality and powers peculiar to itſelf. The firſt is the fluid part, commonly called <hi>ſerum,</hi> or <hi>whey.</hi> The next is the oily fat part, which exhibits itſelf in cream
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0209101800:19"/>on the ſurface, and is to be wrought into butter. The third is of a coarſer nature, earthy and mucilaginous in its texture, and of this cheeſe is formed. The ſerum, or watry portion, exceeds the others in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, ſo that in different milks, there will be found eight or ten parts of this fluid, to one only of ſolid. The butter, or oily fat ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is the lighteſt, and the leaſt in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, and inflammable in its nature. And laſtly the curd is of a more fixed and heavy temper, is very readily hardened by acids, and ſubſides to the bottom in the ſubſtance of cheeſe.</p>
            <p>THE efficacy of every ſort of milk in curing and ſubduing any diſeaſe, is derived from this threefold nature of the ingredients that conſtitute the ſubſtance of milk. For that milk which is thin and liquid, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a larger proportion of ſerum, is prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for its faculty of moiſtening, diluting, cleanſing and relaxing. Again, that which is heavier, and has much of the groſs ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of curd, is valuable for its excellence in hardening, confirming and conſolidating the broken veſſels.</p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0209101800:20"/>
            <p>BUT that which produces a great ſhare of cream, and likewiſe a conſiderable quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the curd-like ſubſtance, is eminent for its ſoftening, ſmoothening, and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing quality. If we examine the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſpecies of milks that are in common and daily uſe; the human is the ſweeteſt of all, of a very ſoft and rich temperature, and is the beſt accommodated for the nutriment of the human body. That of cows is fatter, has more of the earthy and leſs of the watery ſubſtance, and is therefore leſs fitted for cleanſing the veſſels, but beſt formed for ſoftening, tempering and nouriſhing. Sheeps milk is the moſt groſs, and very full of the earthy mucilaginous curd; whence it has little of a cleanſing power, but is extremely uſeful for cloſing up ſuch blood veſſels, or lymphaticks, as are injur'd and corroded by acrid humours. Goats milk has very little ſerum, and is of a pretty thick and aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent conſiſtence, produces very little butter, yet is more cleanſing and diluting than cows milk.</p>
            <p>THIS different proportion in the ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients of milk, and the difference of beneficial
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0209101800:21"/>effects ariſing therefrom, is not ſo much to be aſcribed to the food of the animals, (of which more largely hereafter,) as to the different texture and conformation of their bodies. For tho' we were to feed the various milch-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with the ſame ſort of food, for the ſame length of time, and in the ſame manner in all reſpects, yet would they not give milk of one and the ſame nature, but each of its own and peculiar kind. It is therefore a very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent truth, that the matter and quality of the food conduces but little towards the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of milk, but that it is altogether brought to perfection by the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>culiar nature of the animal, which conſiſt in a diſtinct compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition and texture of the fluids, (namely, the temperature of the blood and other juices,) and a particular make, ſtructure, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the ſolids, eſpecially of the glands belonging to the udder, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of numberleſs fine veſſels.</p>
            <p>WHEN we examine more minutely into the medicinal virtue and diſpoſition of Aſſes milk, it will appear to be fraught with an abundance of peculiar excellencies which render it ſo exceedingly wholeſome. In the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0209101800:22"/>firſt place, it is thinner than all other milks, and abounds with watery and ſerous ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents. This is what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> have both obſerved, who call it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of the minuteſt particles. Since then it is known that many diſeaſes are cauſed by a groſſneſs and tenacity of the juices, which, as they paſs ſlowly thro' the finer veſſels, of which the principal emunctories and ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the glands conſiſt, are apt to ſtop in thoſe narrow paſſages, to fill them up, and occaſion obſtructions, it is very obvious and natural to conclude, that the uſe of Aſſes milk, which abounds with ſerous and fluid particles, muſt be extremely proper to open the obſtructed veſſels, to attenuate the groſs and viſcid juices, and ſet them in an eaſy and free motion. Again, when we know that multitudes of diſtempers proceed from an acrid, ſalt, and corroſive ſtate of the fluids, we cannot but be aſſured that the thin ſerum of Aſſes-milk will not fail of diluting, ſoften<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſubduing them: altho' it muſt be allowed at the ſame time, that the ſweet oily ſubſtance contributes much toward this effect, which embraces and involves the pointed particles of ſalt, and by this means the crude,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0209101800:23"/>ill-digeſted juices, being property corrected, are, by the plentiful aſſiſtance of ſerum, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd in their due courſe thro' the veſſels ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for ſecretion.</p>
            <p>IT is another extraordinary excellence of Aſſes milk, that it contains but a ſmall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the groſſer curdling ſubſtance. Out of eight ounces of Aſſes milk which I ſet over hot coals in a broad veſſel, after all the ſerum was evaporated, I could ſcarce ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo much as ſix drachms of a whitiſh ſweet matter. I then took twelve ounces of the ſame milk, and ſet it by to curdle in a cloſe veſſel, filled about half way. In three days time a very white and thin curd ſettled at the bottom, which when ſeparated from the whey by ſtraining thro' filtrating paper, and afterwards dried, ſcarce amounted to two drachms; all the reſt of its ſolid parts having in part paſſed with the whey thro' the ſtrainer, and partly adhered to the ſides of the veſſels, or loſt themſelves in the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. On the contrary, the ſame weight of cows milk, treated in the ſame manner, thickened into a groſſer and heavier curd, which when clear'd from the whey, ſpread
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0209101800:24"/>out in a broad plate, and dried in the ſun, weighed ten drachms. From theſe experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments it is evident, that the quantity of the groſs curdling ſubſtance is very ſmall in Aſſes milk, when compared with other ſorts. For this reaſon it eaſily diffuſes itſelf into the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuteſt extremities of the blood-veſſels, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly dilutes the vital juices, liquifies the ſluggiſh humours, and when it has thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved them conveys them off. A third cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance that more ſtrongly evinces the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lubrious quality of Aſſes milk, is, that the ſhare of cheeſe-like ſubſtance which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains is extremely ſoft and tender, and never makes a groſs or firm curd. To make this evident, I warmed ſome Aſſes milk, and ſprinkled it with vinegar, expecting to ſee it contract a thick conſiſtence; but nothing appear'd of that ſort, except a few light thin flakes floating here and there on the ſerum: when, on the contrary, cow's milk, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant it was mixed with an acid, condenſed into lumps of a conſiderable hardneſs, and fell to the bottom. Now in all cures which are ſought by milk, nothing can be ſo hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and dangerous as to have it curdle in the ſtomach, to prevent which accident ought
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0209101800:25"/>to be the phyſicians principle care and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern. For the miſchiefs occaſioned by a coagulation of milk in the ſtomach are very pernicious, and have been obſerved and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned againſt by the beſt authors. It is paſt diſpute therefore that that milk is the moſt wholſome and propereſt for medicinal uſes, which has leaſt tendency to curdle, which is the caſe with Aſſes milk in the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable degree.</p>
            <p>A fourth, and the moſt valuable excellence in Aſſes milk, is its exquiſite ſweetneſs, in which it exceeds all other ſpecies of milk, except the human: for you may extract from it by much the greateſt quantity of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate taſted ſugar, or rather a thick ſubſtance reſembling manna. To try the experiment, I boiled twelve ounces of Aſſes milk, in the month of July, over a gentle fire, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately it produced a thick concretion very ſweet, weighing one ounce. Upon this I poured it into a glaſs with a pint of rain water, which when frequently ſhaken al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt diſſolved the maſs, leaving only a ſmall ſediment. The liquor was then poured through filtrating paper, and ſet to evaporate,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0209101800:26"/>and yielded half an ounce of an honey-like ſubſtance, extremely ſweet, and white. As Aſſes milk therefore contains ſo plentiful a proportion of ſweet ſalts, we cannot doubt but it has for that reaſon a very ſingular me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal quality which cannot be expected in other kinds of milk. For this honey-like ſalt greatly ſoftens, checks and moderates the acrimony of humours, whether acid or bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious, and by gently irritating the fibres of the bowels, urges them to their office and operation. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> very juſtly obſerves, that Aſſes milk diſpoſes to purging more than any other. And in another place adviſes, as a remedy for the Fluor Albus, firſt to occaſion a gentle purging by drinking Aſſes milk, and then to change it for cows milk.</p>
            <p>FROM theſe enlarged obſervations which we have made on the excellencies of Aſſes milk, it muſt be evident to all that judge ſenſibly, that it has an admirable efficacy towards curing many diſtempers. It may now be proper to enumerate thoſe diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in regular order, and explain the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of this milk in each particular. The firſt and moſt remarkable inſtance we ſhall
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0209101800:27"/>give, by proving that no ſurer or more ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful remedy can be invented or recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended againſt <hi>conſumptions.</hi> The uſe of milk in ſuch diſeaſes had long been practis'd, till the phyſical ſchools of Cnidos and Cos exploded it: at length <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> who came from the latter, vindicated and eſtabliſhed its credit, and was univerſally followed in it by all the phyſicians of the next age. <hi>Galen</hi> ſays a great deal in praiſe of milk in conſumptive caſes; and ſpeaks of a place, called <hi>Stabia,</hi> very famous for its good air, paſture for cattle, and their wholſome milk, which was filled frequently with crouds of conſumptive people that came thither for relief. And <hi>Aretaeus</hi> aſcribes ſo extraordinary virtues to milk in this grievous diſtemper, that he does not ſcruple to affirm, that if conſumptive folks would drink great quantities of milk they would need no other remedy.</p>
            <p>YET although milk of all kinds be a whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome medicine in conſumptive and decaying conſtitutions, yet Aſſes milk excells the others in a greater degree, becauſe it fully anſwers every requisite that can conduce to the cure of conſumptions. If we ſtrictly enquire into
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0209101800:28"/>the cauſe and origin of a conſumption of the lungs, it will be found to proceed from a ſtoppage and obſtruction of the veſſels, of which the lungs are almoſt entirely compoſed. Whence <hi>Hippocrates</hi> very properly and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly deſcribes the riſe of a conſumption in theſe words; <q>"when the lungs have col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected a quantity of blood, or ſalt phlegm, and cannot diſcharge them, but they ſettle and fix there, they occaſion little puſtules to riſe; which ſuppurate at firſt; and thro' the whole diſtemper there continues a ſharp dry cough, chillineſs, a fever, a pain in the breaſt and back, and ſometimes a a ſtrong wheeſing both in lying down and ſitting up, and then the patient begins to ſpit up much corrupted matter."</q>— It was uſual with the ancients to vary their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of milk for conſumptions, and ſometimes order Aſſes milk before, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times after the uſe of other milk, as different occaſions required. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> adviſes purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Aſſes milk boiled (or Mares milk ſtrained, which much reſembles Aſſes milk) and drank every morning to the quantity of about a quart; after which he recommends cows milk, or goats.</p>
            <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0209101800:29"/>
            <p>PROSPER ALPINUS greatly recommends the uſe of woman's milk at firſt, then Aſſes, and laſtly goats, in a conſumption and ulceration of the lungs. For my part, I am convinced both from reaſon and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that Aſſes milk alone is ſufficient for the cure of this terrible diſeaſe. For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be ſo properly adapted as this is, by its abundance of ſweet deterſive ſalts, to cleanſe away and diſperſe the matter that obſtructs the veſſels and pipes of the lungs. Beſides, it greatly reſtores decay'd ſtrength, cools the heat of the inteſtines, fills out the waſted limbs, and preſerves a free and open perſpiration. Yet I do not deny, but when the obſtruction of the veſſels in the lungs is cured, cows milk or goats, by reaſon of their plenty of groſs, earthy ſubſtance, may be proper to fill up and conſolidate the cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties made by the corroſive ulcers.</p>
            <p>IF I may be allowed to produce my own experience, I could recount many inſtances of conſumptive people, who were afflicted with an obſtinate cough, a fever, a great diſcharge of viſcid matter from the lungs,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0209101800:30"/>and an amazing waſte of the whole body; and who, after an ineffectual trial of other remedies, by my directions took to a long continued courſe of Aſſes milk, or cows milk, (either with or without ſome ſort of tea,) and perfectly recovered. But omitting others, I ſhall only relate one very late caſe, which is now freſh in my memory: <hi>A man, about thirty years old,</hi> of a <hi>very debauched life,</hi> and given to all kinds of intemperance, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially drinking of ſpirituous liquors, firſt fell into a ſpitting of blood, which being cured, tho' after a long continuance, he contracted a fever, which at firſt had the appearance of a defluxion, but at length conſumed his ſtrength, and afflicted him night and day. He continually ſpit up a great diſcharge of purulent and viſcid matter, his ſtrength failed, and his fleſh waſted ſo ſpeedily, that he could not walk about, and was given over by every body. Yet, after he had laid three months in this ſad condition, by God's bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing he recovered, unexpectedly, at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the ſpring, on drinking goats milk warm every morning, after I had admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered gentle, opening, ſaline-abſterſive and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0209101800:31"/>nitrous powders, to remove his obſtructions, and hectic heat.</p>
            <p>YET we muſt take notice, that tho' this be ſuch a ſovereign remedy for conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and when given in a judicious manner, ſcarce ever fails of ſucceſs, yet it will not cure every ſort of conſumption; but muſt be applied in the beginning of the diſtemper, and is moſt likely to take effect, before the ulcers be grown callous, or the corroded ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity be too deep and large, or the fever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come continued and without intermiſſion. <hi>Celſus</hi> juſtly adviſes, <q>"If it be a real con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, you ought to attack it as early as poſſible; for when this diſtemper is of long date, it is not eaſily conquered. But in the beginning, as in all laſting and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate fevers, the uſe of milk is proper."</q> And <hi>Alpinus</hi> very diſcreetly ſays, that a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular courſe of milk will cure conſumptions in their beginning, before the ulcers be grown large and callous.</p>
            <p>As a ſpitting of blood, difficulty of breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, waſting of the fleſh, and a ſmall fever,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0209101800:32"/>all generally inſeparable companions of a conſumption of the lungs, are occaſioned by the ſame cauſe, namely, an obſtruction of the veſſels of the lungs, and puſtules that ariſe from thence, which in the height of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper grow to a ſcirrhous and cancerous ulceration, there is no more powerful help againſt all theſe ſymptoms, than Aſſes milk, and it has always been recommended by the moſt antient and able phyſicians. There is a remarkable paſſage in <hi>Trallian,</hi> which ſays, <q>"If the whole body receives no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit from food, but begins apparently to waſte away, and the breaſt does not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge much matter, they ought to live on milk only, and that of Aſſes excells all others, becauſe it purges to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per degree."</q> The ſame author again commends Aſſes milk for a difficulty of breathing: <q>"Such as are afflicted with a difficulty of breathing, I have often known relieved by Aſſes milk, when given properly, for it clears and removes whatever is fixed in the veſſels of the lungs."</q> And in another place, ſpeaking of ſpitting blood, he fays, <q>"All that ſpit blood find relief from milk. For there
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0209101800:33"/>is no medicine or food of any kind ſo ſuited to their caſe as milk: and thoſe that took to the uſe of that alone at firſt, and perſevered in it for a long time, have all recovered their health. I knew a man that by living on milk for a whole year, and entirely abſtaining from wine, was cured of a ſpitting of blood and matter, and eſcaped falling into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption."</q>
            </p>
            <p>A conſumption with a ſlow feveriſh heat, is moſt times cauſed by a ſtoppage or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in the ſmaller veſſels, thence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds a ſtagnation of the humours, either in the lungs or bowels, and glandulous parts of the belly. Now Aſſes milk ſerves to moiſten and remove theſe obſtructions; it likewiſe cools and checks the violence of the feveriſh heat. Whence 'tis evident, that a right uſe of Aſſes milk is not only extremely ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but the very beſt of all remedies in a ſlow fever. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> agrees with us in this, and adviſes thoſe that have a conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſmall fever to drink milk. And <hi>Riverius</hi> relates a remarkable caſe of a young lady of <hi>Montpellier,</hi> aged 25, who had been
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0209101800:34"/>long confined to her bed with a cough that harraſſed her night and day, perpetual watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a pain in her ſtomach, a ſlow fever, coſtiveneſs, and a general decay of the whole body, who was perfectly recovered by drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Aſſes milk for one month, after being prepared for it by a laxative cooling julep.</p>
            <p>To this let me add a moſt ſingular caſe that came within my obſervation a few years ago. A gentlewoman had for many years been ſubject to much ſickneſs, but now for half a year together was afflicted with a ſlow fever, a loathing of food, languidneſs of the limbs, a dry cough, watchings, a great pain about the Os Sacrum, heat of urine, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe ſweats by night, and ſo entire a waſte and decay in fleſh and ſtrength, that ſhe was unable to ſtir from her bed. In vain had ſhe been ply'd with decoctions, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-hectic powders, ſtomachicks, anti-hyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rics, reſolvents, and a thouſand other things; ſhe lay paſt all hopes, and in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of certain death. At length, in the beginning of the ſpring, by my direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſhe took to Aſſes milk, taking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween whiles a little opening manna, mixed
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0209101800:35"/>with ſome cooling nitrous powders, and now and then ſome nouriſhing broths pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with laxative roots, and with ſuch happy ſucceſs, that in three days only, every thing appeared wonderfully amended; and tho' the cure was not entirely compleated in many weeks, ſhe was at laſt perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to her health and vigour.</p>
            <p>I likewiſe judge Aſſes milk to be very efficacious againſt an Empyema, which is often cauſed by a pleureſy improperly treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, eſpecially in bodies of a ſpongy habit, and ſhews itſelf by a conſtant and copious ſpitting of matter. To confirm which opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion I ſhall relate a remarkable caſe as told by <hi>T. Valleriola:</hi> A woman, after recovery from a pleureſy, began to diſcharge, by ſpitting, great quantities of purulent matter, which reduc'd her to a miſerable, thin, emaciated, and lifeleſs condition. The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor tried to relieve her breaſt of that load of filth by deterſive drinks, linctus's, broths, and ſuch ſort of things, but without ſucceſs: at length, as her fever was not very high, nor any obſtruction appeared to be in the Hypochondria, or the bowels, he preſcribed
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0209101800:36"/>Aſſes milk freſh milked, and ſweetened with a little ſugar, which having drank for ſix weeks, ſhe recovered her health and a good conſtitution, and died twelve years after in child-bed. I likewiſe remember, many years ſince, when I practis'd phyſic at <hi>Minden,</hi> a nobleman, thirty years of age, of a full and ſanguine habit of body, who, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a pleureſy injudiciouſly treated, fell into ſo very great a ſpitting both of purulent and chylous matter, which laſted more than a month; and that he ſometimes ſpit more than a pint a day, and was thereby ſurprizing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weaken'd and emaciated. I ordered him to drink Aſſes milk, with powders of crab-ſhells and bole armonic, balſam of ſulphur of almonds, ſperma ceti, and dragons blood mixt; when he had done this for two months, by the aſſiſtance of providence he was happily cured, to the admiration of all that knew him.</p>
            <p>BUT yet, 'tis not only in theſe diſeaſes which affect the lungs and other inteſtines with a cough, fever, waſte and conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that Aſſes milk has this admirable and divine efficacy, but it is alſo wonderfully
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0209101800:37"/>ſerviceable for ſoothing, abating, and lulling the fierceneſs of pains in the nervous parts of the body, chiefly thoſe that fix themſelves in the joints. Theſe diſeaſes, ſuch as the gout in the hands, feet, and hips, are cauſed by a ſharp, thin ſerum, iſſuing out of thoſe glands which were diſcovered by <hi>Clopton Havers,</hi> nay through the coats of the glands, and falling on the articulo-nerveo-tendinous ligaments, which corrodes them and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions moſt acute pains, cramps, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions of the limbs. This, in time, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the whole ſyſtem of the nerves, and brings on a fever, watching, anxiety, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guidneſs, want of appetite, and univerſal reſtleſſneſs, if the fit be very violent. In theſe rheumatic and gouty caſes, the whole maſs of humours is infected with foul, ſalt, tartarous, and ſharp particles; which is perhaps owing to ſome antecedent cauſe, a fullneſs of blood, ſome ſuppreſſion of a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical diſcharge from the blood, irregular living, or exceſs in eating; and yet ſome modern practitioners are apt to confound theſe remote cauſes with the proximate, the ſalt foulneſs of the humours, and prove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves quite ignorant of the nature of this
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0209101800:38"/>diſtemper, as well as of the method of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying remedies. For it's evident from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that all ſuch remedies as ſweeten the juices, correct the ſharp ſalts, and as it were ſheath-up their points, and at the ſame, time gently promote each different kind of excretion, go a great way towards relieving the violence of the diſtemper, ſoften and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate the ſharp pains, and in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure cure the diſeaſe itſelf, unleſs it be he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary, or of a very long date.</p>
            <p>Now milk, and particularly that of Aſſes, is by far the beſt and moſt excellent of this ſort of remedies, excepting the diluting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions that are prepared from roots. Nor is its excellence any late diſcovery of the moderns, but the earlieſt writers in phyſic, and all their followers, highly recommended and approve it. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> adviſes, in a ſciatica, firſt a purge, and then a courſe of Aſſes milk. And in the ſame treatiſe, he adds, it is proper in the gout firſt to ſoften the bowels with a glyſter or ſuppoſitory, and after a purge to drink warm whey or Aſſes milk. <hi>Pliny</hi> tells us many have been relieved from pains in the joints by drinking milk.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0209101800:39"/>And <hi>Celſus</hi> ſays, many people, by a long courſe of Aſſes milk, have been ſo thoroughly cleared of this diſtemper, as to be free from it ever after. Among the moderns, <hi>Gabriel Fonſeca, Hollerius, Ballonius, Baglivi, Sydenham, Sachs, Griſelius, Pechlinus, Dolaeus, Waldſch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midt,</hi> and many more, all agree, from num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs experiments and obſervations, in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing milk, and eſpecially Aſſes milk, to be the principal comfort and relief of gouty and rheumatic perſons.</p>
            <p>AND I can from my own knowledge aſſert, that after uſing gentle laxatives made of manna, ſolutive ſyrup of roſes, and ſome ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbents mixed, I have found the drinking of goats milk, (where Aſſes could not be had) for many days together, without meat or drink of any other ſort, has given great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit; the pains have grown milder, and of ſhorter continuance, and all the other ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms have ceaſed. I have known many gouty old men, who after drinking Aſſes milk with manna for the three firſt days, and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing it alone for a fortnight, have found their pains greatly abated: but when they laid aſide this remedy, their torture was moſt
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0209101800:40"/>intenſe and obſtinate, and confined them to their beds for ſome months. Yet this muſt all along be obſerved, that in theſe diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers the good effects of milk is more ſpeedy and certain where the patient is young, the diſeaſe not inveterate, the gout not fixed to a particular part, nor tranſmitted by inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance.</p>
            <p>As Aſſes milk proves ſo very uſeful in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the pains that ſeize the outward parts of the Body, ſo it is likewiſe no leſs ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able againſt thoſe that affect the inward nervous parts, the ſtomach and inteſtines, as is the caſe in convulſive cholics. This very beneficial effect of it is to be accounted for in the following manner: The Aſſes milk, being diluting, corrects and overpowers the acrimony of the bilious juices, ſoftens and relaxes the contracted fibres with its ſerous and ſlippery particles, and with its ſweet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients renders the bowels laxative; then that corroſive matter which occaſions all the pain, is readily conveyed off by ſtool, and all is eaſy and quiet. The truth of this <hi>Ballonius</hi> aſſerts, and although <hi>Hippocrates</hi> forbids the uſe of milk where there are bilious purgings,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0209101800:41"/>yet, if there be no remarkable fever to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the milk, I think it ſhould be given. For if it may be thrown into the bowels by a glyſter, without any hurtful effect, why not alſo into the ſtomach?</p>
            <p>WHEN cramps and convulſions ſeize the nervous parts, which is the common ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom in hypochondriac and hyſteric fits, I have always obſerved milk, eſpecially that of Aſſes, do great good; provided there be no coſtiveneſs, nor obſtruction in the bowels, and the firſt paſſages be not clogged with ſharp and viſcid phlegm. Hence <hi>Sydenham</hi> highly approves the uſe of milk in what he calls the hyſteric cholic. <q>Many women, ſays he, for a long while troubled with hyſteric diſorders, eſpecially that which I call hyſteric cholic, have been quite cured by only living on milk for ſome time."</q>
               <hi>Bened. Sylvaticus</hi> beſtows the higheſt praiſes on Aſſes milk in hypochondriac complaints, which he directs to be ſweetned with ſugar, and made a moderate purge by a ſmall mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of powdered ſenna, and drank for forty days together. And although <hi>Hippocrates</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids milk where the hypochondria are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtended,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0209101800:42"/>that is, when the ſtomach is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded with wind, or the belly ſwoln and overcharged with blood, yet I have often learn'd from indiſputable experience, that the hypochondria are not always thus op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, but that the ſtomach and adjoining inteſtines are often tortured with contractions cauſed by the ſharpneſs of the humours, and blood that ſtagnates in the finer veſſels, and that this diſorder is ſucceſsfully removed by milk.</p>
            <p>FOR the ſame reaſon this judicious au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor zealouſly recommends Aſſes milk, in madneſs and hypochondriac melancholy, which are occaſioned by ſpaſms, that force too great a quantity of blood into the head, ſo that it cannot circulate equally and freely thro' the veſſels of the membranes that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe the brain: and if it be drank every morning to the quantity of four or five ounces, for the ſpace of a month, or longer, it corrects the acrid humours, eaſes the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions of the fibres, cools and relaxes the bowels, and by gradually removing the cauſe, ſubdues that terrible diſorder. But in order
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0209101800:43"/>for more certain ſucceſs, it is proper to make an addition to the purging quality of the milk, by mixing a little manna; the happy effects of which I have very often expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced.</p>
            <p>SINCE therefore it is ſo evident that Aſſes milk is beneficial to the nerves, and heals their ſeveral fore-mentioned diſorders by means of its ſoftening and lubricating quality, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doubt but it may be properly admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtered in other complaints, where the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous parts are likewiſe afflicted and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with violent motions, as in epilepſies and convulſive fits. This is affirmed by that eminent author <hi>Sylvaticus,</hi> in many places; and I can atteſt the ſame with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence. For I could produce very many examples of it, but one in particular of a youth of noble birth, about fourteen years of age, and of admirable parts and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. Having been ſtruck by ſome ſudden fright, he was inſtantly ſeized with ſtrong convulſions in his limbs, chiefly his legs and arms: and after much anxiety and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs of ſpirits, was oppreſſed with entire
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0209101800:44"/>ſwoonings, ſo that the fit came ſometimes every other day, ſometimes every day, about the evening, and purſuing him for the ſpace of two months, reduced him to a very weak condition. Many phyſicians were conſulted, who gave him various medicines, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any effect: at laſt he was ordered to drink every morning about three ounces of Aſſes milk, now and then with a little manna, and to be put in a warm bath every other day, taking between whiles ſome anti-epileptic powders: in a month's time the diſorder diſappeared, and the patient, by the divine bleſſing, recovered his health and ſtrength.</p>
            <p>LET us conſider thoſe grievous diſorders that attend the ſcurvy, ſuch as a waſting of the fleſh, fierce pains and contractions of the limbs, external ulcers and eroſions. All which are derived from a total diſtemperature of the juices, a ſuppreſſion of thoſe very uſeful evacuations of ſweat and excrement; from a a defect in the ſecretion of the bilious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours in the ſpleen; from a ſalt ſulphureous foulneſs in the humours; and likewiſe from
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0209101800:45"/>their too thick conſiſtence, which retards their natural progreſs, and obſtructs the finer veſſels. Now nothing can be ſo proper to open theſe cloſed paſſages, to remove obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to correct the acrimony of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and to diſſolve their viſcidity, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting, moiſtening and cooling remedies, ſuch as the whey of goats milk, or, what is ſtill preferable to all, Aſſes milk.</p>
            <p>THE ſtrongeſt teſtimony I can produce in favour of this eminent good quality in milk, is that of the beſt author that ever wrote upon the ſcurvy, <hi>Eugalenus,</hi> who ſays, <q>"I have ſeen many people recover out of the ſcurvy from the uſe of milk and milk-diets, with a ſtronger and better conſtitution than thoſe that have lived under the rules and preſcriptions of phyſicians."</q> And he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſeveral that have been cured of ſcorbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic fevers by milk, though contrary to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> in his aphoriſms. And I myſelf could produce a multitude of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples within my own experience of people afflicted with a wandering ſcorbutic gout, (a national diſtemper in <hi>Weſtphalia</hi>) whom I
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0209101800:46"/>abſolutely cured, when I practiſed phyſic at <hi>Minda,</hi> with no other medicine than Aſſes, or other ſorts of milk, if it were not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to tire the reader with ſo many illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of a thing that is ſo clear and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
            <p>WHEN ſcorbutic people and old men, who are naturally ſubject to a ſalt and foul corruption of the humours, and likewiſe ſuch as are infected with a venereal taint, are afflicted with dangerous ulcers that ſeem to reſemble cancers; even in theſe terrible ſymptoms a very ſpeedy and ſure relief may be had from Aſſes milk, and the whey of it. Which, as it is evident from all the above-mentioned arguments, is likewiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the authorities of many authors both antient and modern. <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends milk, mixed with honey, or ſalt, in all ſorts of ulcerations in general, as well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as outward, for violent itching in the ſkin, pimples, and foul humours of the body. <hi>Galen</hi> adviſes the uſe of Aſſes milk for ulcers in the uterus, the reins, the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and pudenda. To theſe we may add
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0209101800:47"/>the aſſertion of <hi>Sylvaticus,</hi> that Aſſes milk drank for thirty or forty days together, not only entirely cured a cancerous ſwelling in the neck of the uterus, but alſo a venereal ulcer, attended with a conſumption and ſlow fever. Again, the ſame author commends the ſame remedy for the cure of that hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lean diſtemper, the elephantiaſis, in theſe words; <q>"Aſſes milk drank every morning to the quantity of a quart, with a little ſugar, and cream of tartar, to render it purgative, is a very excellent remedy for the elephantiaſis."</q> And <hi>Ambroſe Parey,</hi> in his book of ſurgery, ſays, he has known by experience the admirable efficacy of Aſſes milk, in cancerous ulcers, both taken inwardly, and applied outwardly in fomentations.</p>
            <p>AND while we are enumerating the many noble virtues of Aſſes milk, we muſt not omit its peculiar excellence not only as a remedy to the diſtempers of old men, but as a ſort of food of great efficacy in reſtoring their decayed ſtrength. With regard to its medicinal excellence in relieving old age, we
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0209101800:48"/>have elſewhere ſhewn at large, that in an advanced age, the blood and all the juices contract a great degree of foulneſs and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, from obſtructions in the excretory glands and veſſels, whence in time proceeds variety of diſtempers, the moſt remarkable of which are indigeſtion, languidneſs in the limbs, conſumption of the ſolids, a low fever, and <hi>pruritus.</hi> And all theſe are to be relieved by a proper uſe of milk. And on this account it has always been held in great eſteem both by the ancients and moderns; for it is very efficacious in rendering the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours fluid when they are too thick, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting thoſe that are ſalt and acrid, in relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the too rigid and tenſe fibres, and in reſtoring the excretions, when diſturbed, to their proper order, as it not only cleanſes the foul juices, but likewiſe breeds a proper ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of good ones. It will be ſufficient for the preſent purpoſe to produce the authority of <hi>Trallian,</hi> who ſtrongly recommends Aſſes milk to old people who are under a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive waſting; and the reaſon he gives for it is, becauſe they have but a ſmall ſhare of ſtrength, and are neither able to ſeparate
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0209101800:49"/>nouriſhment from common food, nor to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute it thro' the conſtitution; wherefore the milk of women is firſt to be prefer'd, and next to it that of Aſſes.</p>
            <p>IF we enquire into the nouriſhing and ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leptic property of Aſſes milk, by which it retards the decays of old age, and reſtores the ſtrength of thoſe who have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by diſtempers, no body can heſitate to give the preference to this kind of milk above any others.</p>
            <p>BUT it may not perhaps be diſagreeable, or improper, to produce the authority of authors of great credit, who have treated of this ſubject. I ſhall begin with the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation that <hi>Helmont</hi> gives of it; who, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' in other parts of his writings he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns the uſe of milk, yet <hi>in Libr. de Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt. Aliment.</hi> aſcribes a particularly refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing invigorating and nouriſhing property to that of Aſſes, ſuppoſing that the Aſs, as a long-liv'd animal, is furniſh'd with milk preferable to any others. <hi>Eryphon,</hi> as <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus</hi> relates, relied altogether on Aſſes milk
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0209101800:50"/>for reſtoring old and emaciated people. I myſelf alſo knew an officer of the army, who was reſtored to his former health and eaſe by Aſſes milk, tho' he was almoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely waſted away with the venereal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper and excruciating pains that had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted him for ſeveral years. <hi>Heurnius</hi> alſo relates, that Aſſes milk prevents old age and wrinkles; for which reaſon, no doubt, it was that <hi>Poppaea,</hi> the wife of <hi>Nero,</hi> always ordered a hundred Aſſes to be kept, that ſhe might bathe every day in their milk, to preſerve her ſkin white, ſoft, and ſmooth.</p>
            <p>HAVING now explained the property of Aſſes milk, and its excellence in ſeveral diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, I ſhall proceed to the proper method of giving it, and then ſhew what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be obſerved in order to expect ſucceſs from it. But it will firſt be proper to ſay ſomewhat of the animal itſelf. A milch Aſs ought to be quite free from any diſorder, not very old, but of a middle age, neither too fat nor too lean, and may be eſteemed the better if ſhe bring her foal in the month of <hi>May.</hi> She ought not to be
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0209101800:51"/>fed in a houſe, but kept in meadows which produce plenty of medicinal herbs; ſhe ſhould drink river water, which, as it is lighter and more diluting than ſpring water, paſſes off quicker by the proper diſcharges, and mixing more thoroughly with the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, cleanſes them more effectually. <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> has an ingenious remark on this ſubject: he adviſes that the Aſs ſhould be combed or curried every morning as horſes are, for that it may eaſily be known from the milk, whether ſhe has been dreſſed that morning or not. Without doubt there may be ſome reaſon for this, becauſe the uſe of the curry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb increaſes perſpiration, and cleanſes the humours, by paſſing off a great many ſaline particles that way.</p>
            <p>IT ought to be conſider'd too what the Aſs is fed with, becauſe the nature and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the milk of animals is alter'd by their diet, ſo as to be more or leſs whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, or even adapted to ſome particular diſorders. For as it is a common practice to make a purging or alterative medicine given to the nurſe, communicate its proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0209101800:52"/>to her milk and take effect on the child, ſo no doubt the ſame will hold good in regard to the animals whoſe milk we uſe. <hi>Galen</hi> proves this by the inſtance of goats, who are fed with ſcammony or ſpurge, whoſe milk is purging. <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates</hi> are of the ſame opinion, and in the <hi>Acta Haffnienſia</hi> it is aſſerted, that worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood eaten in large quantities makes the milk bitter. From hence it is that <hi>Coelius Aurelianus</hi> commends milk in the coeliac paſſion, or flux, which is taken from goats that feed on willows, vine leaves, oaks, or ſallows, plaintain, and plants of the ſame nature; giving this reaſon for it, <q>"becauſe the aſtringent quality of the herbs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates itſelf to the milk."</q> But there is a remarkable difference between the milk which is produced in ſpring from green pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, and that in winter from dry food. <hi>Varro,</hi> who was very well acquainted with what belong to country affairs, was of this opinion, and ſays, <q>"that milk from barley and ſtubble, and all kinds of hard and dry food is nouriſhing; but that is more cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which comes from green paſture."</q> And
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0209101800:53"/>
               <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> thinks that milk in ſpring is thinner, and becauſe it comes from green paſture, more laxative and ſoftening.</p>
            <p>FROM whence it plainly appears, that milk of all ſorts, but more eſpecially Aſſes, is not only moſt ſerviceable in the ſpring, but that its virtues may, by a regulation of food, be ſo prepared, as to be particularly effective againſt any one diſtemper. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhould adviſe that a milch Aſs be fed with ſuch herbs as in themſelves are known proper for the diſeaſe you would relieve. In a conſumption, and diſeaſes of the lungs and breaſt, let her be ſupplied with vero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica, ground ivy, the blind or dead nettle, colts-foot, ſcurvy-graſs; or, if you want to reſtore the vigour of the ſolids, with ſanicula, tanſey, nummularia, conſolida-major, flowers of St. John's-wort, alchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milla, polygonum, and the like; or let the creature be drove to places where theſe plants abound. In pains and ſpaſms, both inward and external, it may be uſeful to mix in her food yarrow, chamomile flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, acacia, mead-wort, tilia, melilot, ſpurge,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0209101800:54"/>mallows, marſh mallows, and others of this nature. In ſlow and hectic fevers, (beſides thoſe we named as good for the lungs) we may add plantane, prunella, and ſcurvy-graſs mix'd with germander. If the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondria are obſtructed, and cauſe a ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butic foulneſs in the juices, chooſe out ſome herbs of the opening or laxative kind; ſuch are fumitory, the leſſer centaury, abſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thium, ſcurvy-graſs, trefoil, water-creſs, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturtium, and the leſſer houſe-leek. In the ſame manner may milk be rendered medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal, and fit for almoſt any complaints, by adminiſtring ſuch herbs and flowers as the phyſician ſhall eſteem moſt proper and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual.</p>
            <p>As to the method of uſing it, theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing rules may be obſerved.</p>
            <p n="1">1. IN caſes of neceſſity, Aſſes milk may be drank at all times; but it is by far the moſt ſerviceable in the ſpring and ſummer, when all the herbs are full of juices, and greatly enrich the milk. 2. The milk ſhould be milked into a pail ſet over hot water, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0209101800:55"/>immediately put into a veſſel that has a narrow mouth, and ſhuts cloſe, and ſo drank di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly while it is warm; for milk, like all other liquors, has a ſubtle ſpirit, of a ſtrengthening and invigorating quality, which by no means ought to be allowed to fly off with its warmth. Hence <hi>Galen</hi> orders that milk be drank inſtantly, and the animal brought to the patient's bed-ſide; for that its nature, like that of the ſemen, is at once altered by the open air. 3. The morning is the beſt time of day to drink, as it will operate the eaſier in an empty ſtomach; and therefore no other food ought to be taken in four or five hours after it. Yet, if circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances require a frequent repetition of it, if may be drank in the afternoon; but it ſhould be about four hours after dinner has been digeſted, and in but half the quantity that is drank in the morning, 4. 'Tis impoſſible to preſcribe in general any fix'd quantity that ſhould be uſed, becauſe of the difference of ages, conſtitutions, and diſtempers; but thus far may be ſaid, that you ought never to exceed the quantity of three common pints. 5. The time of continuing it muſt be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0209101800:56"/>by the degree and ſtrength of the diſtemper: if that be very obſtinate, it were well to continue drinking it for three months, or longer; eſpecially if a favourable proſpect appears of ſucceſs, and the violence of the ſymptoms abate very diſcernably.</p>
            <p>YET a prudent and experienced phyſician will ſo order, regulate, and methodiſe the uſe of this medicine, as almoſt to inſure ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and avoid any hurtful conſequences. I ſhall therefore conclude with a few cautions that ſhould be obſerved very accurately.</p>
            <p n="1">1. BEFORE a courſe of milk is begun, the ſtate and condition of the ſtomach muſt be carefully inquired into: Whether it will bear milk, and have a ſufficient degree of ſtrength to concoct, digeſt, and then diſcharge it. For if that be weak and infirm, if it be troubled with wind and phlegm, or be load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a croud of acid humours, milk muſt not be taken; becauſe, until theſe things are remedied, that will curdle and ſtagnate, and corrupt, and increaſe the flatulence and uneaſineſs. It will be proper therefore to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0209101800:57"/>cleanſe and relieve the ſtomach firſt, either downwards, by a gentle doſe of manna, or, where the caſe will allow, by a vomit with a grain or two of emetic tartar. 2. Great care muſt be had that the milk be not turned to curd. And therefore where the food is apt to grow acid in the ſtomach, as is the caſe with old and hypochondriac people, it is adviſeable to give abſorbent, earthy, and alcaline medicines, mix'd with the milk, adding likewiſe ſome ſtomachic carminative eſſence, or volatile oily ſalt. 3. When the patient has drank milk for ſix or eight days, a gentle doſe of manna ſhould be given, to purge the bowels, and carry off whatever foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the ſtomach may have contracted, that the farther efficacy of the milk be not retarded. 4. It is beſt to drink it at firſt ſparingly, three or four ounces, and then to increaſe the draught gradually, that the ſtomach be not too ſuddenly oppreſſed, and conceive a diſlike and loathing to the remedy. 5. A proper regulation of diet muſt be obſerved during the courſe of milk. The lightneſs of food muſt be chiefly conſulted; avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not only meats hard of digeſtion, but
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0209101800:58"/>alſo thoſe that are reckoned to afford little nouriſhment, and likewiſe all flatulent vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals, ſummer fruits, and acids of all kinds; abſtaining from all malt liquors, and wines, except a ſmall quantity of the ſoundeſt <hi>Spaniſh</hi> wines. Nor ſhould any bread be uſed that is lumpiſh and fermented, but what is made of the cleaneſt and fineſt wheat flour.</p>
            <p>IN the laſt place let me add ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, wherein the uſe of milk may be judged improper. In head-aches ariſing from crudities in the ſtomach, in very acute fevers, and when the bowels are overcharged with groſs blood, milk is very pernicious: being no leſs improper when the Stomach is cold and filled with acids, than when in a heat and ferment, as it is in fevers, and when the bilious humours abound, becauſe in both caſes it quickly turns to a foul and offenſive putrid ſtate. Milk is alſo very prejudicial to thoſe who, either through neglect of bleeding, or a total ſuppreſſion of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the piles, or the menſes, are afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a too great and unnatural ſhare of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0209101800:59"/>blood, and conſequently with a foulneſs of the humours. Which agrees entirely with the obſervation of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> That the more you nouriſh diſtempered bodies, the more you injure them. For unleſs the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of blood be reduced by moderate bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the faulty digeſtion amended by medicines that correct the whole maſs of fluids, all ſorts of milk muſt be avoided, as extremely hurtful and dangerous.</p>
