            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A TREATISE OF THE Veneral Diſeaſe.</head>
            <p>I Shall not amuſe the READER with Accounts how this Diſtemper had its Firſt Riſe, or how it was brought into <hi>Europe,</hi> and to <hi>England</hi> in particular, or the ſeveral Ways by which it is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, but ſhall proceed to give you a True Deſcription of every Stage of this Diſorder, and the ſeveral Methods of Cure, in a moſt certain, ſafe and expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Manner, and ſo plain, that every one may underſtand their own Caſe, and cure themſelves without making it known to any.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0167801000:3"/>
            <p>The Symptoms, which formerly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, were the falling out of the Eyes, Teeth and Nails, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which hath not lately happen'd to any Body.</p>
            <p>Several others are not now ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon or ſevere as formerly, ſuch as the falling off of the Hair, Cruſts all over the Body, Caries of the Bones, foul Ulcers of the Palate, Uvula, Jaws and Noſtrils, Nocturnal Pains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are now only Four Symptoms left, and theſe are a <hi>Gonorrhaea,</hi> a <hi>Bubo, Chancres,</hi> and <hi>Peri</hi> or <hi>Warts,</hi> which ſeem to comprehend the whole Diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>Generally it conſiſts of a <hi>Gonorrhaea</hi> only, nor indeed do the other Symptoms ſhew themſelves, unleſs the Cure is neglected, or managed by Unskilful Perſons.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Gonorrhaea</hi> admits of an eaſier Cure than formerly, and is often carried off without Medicines inwardly, if timely taken in Hand, and a due care taken in the Regimen.</p>
            <p>As for the other Three Symptoms tho' they require a more Elaborate Treatment, yet they are now much leſs obſtinate than formerly, all which ſhall be diſcuſſed of in their proper Places and Order.</p>

               <head>Of the <hi>GONORRHAEA.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe firſt Degree of Infection appears in Men, with a Gentle Running or dropping from the Urinary Paſſage, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing a pleaſant Senſation, and as it were glewing up the Orifice, the Extremity of the Urethra, grows hot, and gapes wider than uſual. The Parts of Generation are affected with an uncommon Titula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, eſpecially at the Time of making Water, without Pain, but with a Senſe of Heat that daily increaſes.</p>
               <p>If the Infection ſpreads, or is not ſo mild, the Tention and Induration of the <hi>Penis</hi> come on with Pain, thick Drops of the more fluid part of the Semen, or Seed, flow in greater Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, of a yellowiſh or greeniſh Colour, often with Heat, Redneſs, Tenderneſs, ſmall puſtles, Bliſters and Ulcers both within and without the Urinary Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, with great Sharpneſs and Senſe of Heat, through the whole Urethra after making Water.</p>
               <p>The next Symptoms are more violent, the <hi>Perineum</hi> ſwells, grows painful, the Urine ſcalds, with frequent Provocations
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0167801000:5"/>to make Water, and but a little at a Time, with a Diſtortion and Bending of the <hi>Penis,</hi> called a <hi>Cordee,</hi> with frequent and involuntary Erections, occaſioning great Pain to the Patient, on every ſuch Occaſion, and when warm in Bed, a violent Running <hi>Phimoſis,</hi> or <hi>Paraphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſis,</hi> that is when the Fore-skin is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo ſwell'd as it cannot be brought forward to cover the Nut of the Yard, or that it cannot be drawn backward, one or both of the Teſticles, or Stones ſwelled and enraged with Pain, increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing as the Gleet or Running is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed. Sometime cauſing cold Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and Fainting, but as they abate ſo the Running multiplies, and comes away more freely, of an Aſh-colour, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times marked with Specks, Streaks, or Threads of Blood; ſtinking, yellow, green, and corrupt, and theſe are the uſual or common Claps.</p>
               <p>WOMEN. The Caſe is almoſt the ſame in Women, but this is to be obſerved, That after the Infection is received, the Female Parts of Generation are wet with an unuſual Moiſture, and are troubled with frequent Itching and Heat, almoſt painful and daily advances.</p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0167801000:6"/>
               <p>The Heat, Burning, Redneſs and Pain of the <hi>Vagina,</hi> or Urinary-paſſage, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, the Admiſſion of the <hi>Penis</hi> is ſcarcely to be indur'd: The Urine is ſharp and ſcalding, but in general not ſo ſharp as in Men, the Running plentiful, like Matter, bloody, yellow, green, and ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and by the Tention of the <hi>Pudendum</hi> and <hi>Vagina,</hi> bring on great Pain.</p>
               <p>If the Running is of a clear white, or aſh-colour, and any Thing ropy, ſhews the Infection ſlight.</p>
               <p>If of a Saffron Colour, dark yellow, or brown, from being mixt and diſcoloured with Blood, is the <hi>ſecond Degree</hi> of a <hi>Clap.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If a yellowiſh green, green, or very dark green, mixt with Matter plainly ſhews that the Inflamation is attended with Ulcers, and is the <hi>laſt Stage</hi> of a <hi>Clap.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All theſe different Symptoms appear, but vary according to the Temperament of Body, Habit and Conſtitution of the Patient, and the greater or leſſer Degree of the Infection, and the Diſtance of Time ſince the Injury was receiv'd.</p>
               <p>You are to obſerve, That the greater the Degree of the <hi>Venereal Poiſon</hi> is, the ſooner it appears, but a ſlight Hurt will remain for ſometime before it ſhews itſelf; but the ſooner it appears the eaſier
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0167801000:7"/>is the Cure perform'd. From what hath been ſaid it plainly appears, That there are Three Diſtinct SPECIES of the <hi>Gonorrhaea,</hi> which only differ in Degree, the <hi>Firſt</hi> will eaſily degenerate into the <hi>Second,</hi> the <hi>Second</hi> into the <hi>Third,</hi> if the Vehemence of the Symptoms be not quickly reſtrain'd.</p>
               <p>Theſe Three Degrees are divided into Four <hi>Stages,</hi> that is, the Beginning, Increaſe, Height, and Declintion.</p>
               <p>Neither Man or Woman can indulge in the Uſe of <hi>Venery,</hi> whilſt they are in this State of a <hi>Gonorrhaea,</hi> without violent Pain; and what is worſe, without mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly increaſing the Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>The firſt Thing to be conſider'd is, to learn and underſtand your own Caſe, by obſerving the Nature of it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is expedient to remark, what Effect the <hi>Venereal Poiſon</hi> hath on the Body, according to the ſeveral Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms herein before diſcribed, whereby you will plainly diſcover the Degree of Infection, and by that Means be directed in the Method of Cure.</p>
               <p>I proceed now to give proper Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to each Perſon to cure this Diſeaſe in its ſeveral Stages, and ſhall trace them all in a Regular Manner; but obſerve
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0167801000:8"/>that every <hi>Gonorrhaea,</hi> if Medicines are timely adminiſtred, is free from Danger, and eaſily admits of a Cure, ſooner or later, in Proportion to the Vehemence of the Symptoms, the Acrimony of the Infection, and the Conſtitution of the Blood; but if neglected, and come to a great Hight, is ſometime before it will yield to any Medicine, therefore too early an Application cannot be made for Cure.</p>
               <p>An Information therefore follows of ſuch Antivenereal Remedies as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with all the Natural Qualities re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to perform a ſpeedy and ſafe Cure, in all the Caſes herein deſcribed, and that the Patient may be directed, and readily know how to be furniſhed with all ſuch Medicines, and be ſecure from all Bad Preparations, (ſold at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Shops in <hi>London</hi>) by Authors who conceal their Names, which they would have no Occaſion to do, did their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations anſwer what they pretend for them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Firſt Degree of this Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per being Exterior, and only in the Top of the Urinary-paſſage, may be cured by External Means, for as that part is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0167801000:9"/>of a Spongy Nature, it as eaſily imbibes any Liquid, as the Venereal Poiſon, for which the INCOMPARABE LOTION, or WASH is recommended as the moſt eaſy and private Method of Cure what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
               <p>And this is performed by only pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome of the Liquid into a Cup, waſhing the part with it, and ſoaking it therein two or three Times a Day, for two or three Minutes together or longer, as you have an Opportunity; but be ſure to let the Water cover the Nut of the Yard, and to take freſh Liquor for every Waſhing. Surely no Perſon that is not in Love with Pills, Bolus, and Electuaries, will refuſe ſo eaſy a Cure as this, and ſo ſoon performed.</p>
               <p>This Remedy muſt be of ſingular Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to all Travellers, who cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly take Phyſick on their Journey, therefore this LOTION is adviſed to them, let the Degree of Infection be what it will, for if not to be cured by this Remedy alone, yet it will moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly prevent their growing worſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they have an Opportunity of taking other Medicines, which muſt be of great Advantage to them.</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0167801000:10"/>
               <p>Thoſe who are taking phyſick, if they uſe this INCOMPARABLE LOTION will ſoon find it to forward the Cure to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, by drawing out the Infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Venom, while the Internal Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines by their anodine and detergent Qualities aſſwage the pain, and cleans the Ulcers of the Seminary Receptacles.</p>
               <p>This LOTION is to be had only of the Author RIHARD ROCK, at his Houſe in <hi>King's-Arms-Court, Ludgate-Hill,</hi> and ready to be deliver'd to any Meſſenger, by asking for a <hi>Bottle</hi> of <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> for the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> Price 4 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> where you may have Advice and proper Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies (prepared by the Author) in all other Diſorders.</p>
               <p>As ſometimes the Cure will not be performed perfectly by the LOTION only, by Reaſon of the Diſpoſition of the parts of Generation; for ſome Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom may lay hid in the Wrinkles of the <hi>Frenum</hi> or <hi>Prepnce,</hi> and the leaſt Seeds of Morbifick Matter being introduced into a Sound Body, in the ſmalleſt Quantity, will by Degrees increaſe, in Bulk, Form and Efficacy, and ſooner or later, infect and corrupt the whole Maſs of Humours.</p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0167801000:11"/>
               <p>Therefore for Fear of ſuch an Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and to make the Cure certain and ſafe, the INFALLIBLE ANTIVE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NEREAL BOLUS is recommended, which is pleaſant to take, and will moſt certainly eradicate any Lurking Poiſon, which the Water may not happen to reach, two or three of which will be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to perform the Cure, without any Danger of Return. To be had as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore directed, by asking for the BOLUS for the RHEUMATISM, <hi>Price</hi> 1 s. each. Thoſe who ſuſpect they have received an Injury, or have any Relicts of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Diſorder, may by taking a Doſe or two, be perfectly freed from ſuch Apprehenſions.</p>
               <p>This Medicine hath no unpleaſant Taſte, never cauſes any Sickneſs, Gripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or other Diſorders of the Body, eſpecially after the Firſt Doſe or two. But as the very Name of <hi>Phyſick</hi> is nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeous to ſome Perſons, they may wet a piece of Wafer in a Spoon by dipping it into Water, then put in the Bolus and cover it with the Wafer, and then there can be no Taſte, but of the Water only in taking it. Theſe Wafers are to be
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0167801000:12"/>had at every Confectioner's, you may have a great many for 2 <hi>d.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Be ſure to abſtain from all Acts of Venery whilſt under Cure, for one ſingle Act will increaſe the Diſorder more than three Doſes of Phyſick can rectify.</p>
               <p>The leſs Wine or Strong Liquor that you drink the better; but Spirituous Liquors muſt not be touched, yet you may in the Evening drink a Glaſs or two of Wine to ſupport the Spirits, if you find Occaſion, always remembring the leſs you drink of Strong Liquors the better: Neither ſhould you eat any High-ſeaſon'd Meats, Pepper, or other Spice, and the more ſpareing you are in Diet, much the ſooner will the Cure be perfected, for the more Impure Bodies are nouriſhed, the worſe they grow al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways. But to drink plentifully of Small-Beer, or Milk and Water a little warm, when the Phyſick is not working, is good, and Water-Gruel or Green Tea at all Times. Of any of theſe Liquors you cannot drink too much.</p>
               <p>You may go Abroad while you take Phyſick, but be careful to guard againſt Wet, Windy, or very Cold Weather; at
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0167801000:13"/>ſuch Times it is beſt to confine yourſelf, if your Affairs permit.</p>

               <p n="5">5th. The Colour of the Skin is alter'd, with pain and ſpots, eſpecially on the Breaſt, and between the Shoulders, of a roſe, purple, yellow or livid Colour; ſometimes ſpreading wide, Scabs, Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0167801000:32"/>Tetters, and many Sorts of <hi>Dry,</hi> or <hi>Running Puſtles.</hi>

               <p n="6">6th.

               <p n="7">7th. The Nails become uneven, and being ulcerated drop off.</p>
               <p n="8">8th. The Internal Parts of the Mouth, Throat, and Noſe are diſorder'd; all Parts of the Mouth ſuffer Pain, Heat, and Inflammation, are eat into by Ulcers, and a <hi>Caries</hi> is communicated to the Bones of the Palate, by which they are in a ſhort Time diſtroy'd, which pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates as far as the Noſe, by which Means the ſpongious and triangular Bones there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,

               <p>From ſome of which Diſorders, Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining, or Weakneſs of the Back, and ſuch like, a Running frequently appears, and is not ſo eaſily diſcover'd from that which proceeds from an impure Coition, or other Way of <hi>Venereal Contagion,</hi> which often miſleads and deceives the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0167801000:34"/>truly Virtuous Fair, who have receiv'd ſuch Injuries from the ill Conduct of their Husbands, (and at the ſame Time are ignorant of it) who to conceal their Wicked Practices, never inform their Wives of the Reality of their Diſorders, by which Means they miſtaking their Diſeaſe, it daily increaſes on them (and I fear) too often ends in their Diſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which if timely diſcover'd might have been cur'd with very little Trouble.</p>
               <p>For prevention of all ſuch ſad Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, I adviſe all Females to duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider their own Caſe, and examine it by all the Symptoms herein before diſcrib'd of a <hi>Gonorrhaea,</hi> and alſo to obſerve, if they have any <hi>White Flux</hi> continue, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Time of their <hi>Menſtrual Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge,</hi> in ſuch Caſes they may depend upon having receiv'd the <hi>Venereal Infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> But if the <hi>White Flux</hi> wholly ſtops during the Time of <hi>Menſtruation,</hi> and returns afterwards, it then proceeds from ſome other Diſorder, and not from a <hi>Gonorrhaea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Be ſure not to uſe any Aſtringent Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines before you are duly ſatisfy'd of your Ailment; for ſhould your Caſe be <hi>Venereal,</hi> inſtead of a <hi>White Flux,</hi> the

               <p>But don't imagin that all theſe Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms ever occur at one Time, or in the ſame Perſon, neither do the worſt of them rarely happen to any, yet I thought proper to collect them all together the more clearly to ſhew the ſeveral Degrees of this Deplorable Diſeaſe, and that all People afflicted with this Extreme Part of the <hi>Venereal Diſorder,</hi> might at once view and underſtand their own Caſe.</p>

                  <p>Altho' whoever follows the Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions given for the Cure of a <hi>Gonorrhaea,</hi> will never be afflicted with any of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mention'd Symptoms of this <hi>last Stage</hi> of the <hi>Venereal Infection:</hi> Yet as

                  <p>There remains a Fourth Species of the <hi>Venereal Diſeaſe,</hi> to be added to thoſe which we have already deſcribed.

                  <p>WOMEN.
