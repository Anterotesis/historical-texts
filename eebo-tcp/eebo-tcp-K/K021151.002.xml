            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. <hi>A Compariſon between the World and the Stage.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE World hath been often compared to the Theatre; and many grave Writers, as well as the Poets, have conſidered human Life as a great Drama, reſembling, in almoſt every Particular, thoſe ſcenical Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, which <hi>Theſpis</hi> is firſt reported to have invented, and which have been ſince received with ſo much Approbation and Delight in all polite Countries.</p>
               <p>This Thought hath been carried ſo far, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo general, that ſome Words proper to the Theatre, and which were, at firſt, metaphorically applied to the World, are now indiſcriminately and literally ſpoken of both: Thus Stage and Scene are by common Uſe grown as familiar to us, when we
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0618300102:11"/>
ſpeak of Life in general, as when we confine our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to dramatic Performances; and when we men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Tranſactions behind the Curtain, <hi>St. James's</hi> is more likely to occur to our Thoughts than <hi>Drury-Lane.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may ſeem eaſy enough to account for all this, by reflecting that the theatrical Stage is nothing more than a Repreſentation, or, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calls it, an Imitation of what really exiſts; and hence, perhaps, we might fairly pay a very high Compliment to thoſe, who by their Writings or Actions have been ſo ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of imitating Life, as to have their Pictures, in a Manner confounded with, or miſtaken for the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals.</p>
               <p>But, in Reality, we are not ſo fond of paying Compliments to theſe People, whom we uſe as Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren frequently do the Inſtruments of their Amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and have much more Pleaſure in hiſſing and buffeting them, than in admiring their Excellence. There are many other Reaſons which have induced us to ſee this Analogy between the World and the Stage.</p>
               <p>Some have conſidered the larger Part of Mankind in the light of Actors, as perſonating Characters no more their own, and to which, in Fact, they have no better Title, than the Player hath to be in Earneſt thought the King or Emperor whom he repreſents. Thus the Hypocrite may be ſaid to be a Player; and indeed the <hi>Greeks</hi> called them both by one and the ſame Name.</p>
               <p>The Brevity of Life hath likewiſe given Occaſion to this Compariſon. So the immortal <hi>Shakeſpear.</hi>

                     <hi>But that Remembrance ſays—</hi>THE THINGS HAVE BEEN!</l>
               </q>
               <p>In all theſe, however, and in every other Similitude of Life to the Theatre, the Reſemblance hath been always taken from the Stage only. None, as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, have at all conſidered the Audience at this great Drama.</p>
               <p>But as nature often exhibits ſome of her beſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances to a very full Houſe; ſo will the Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of our Spectators no leſs admit the above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Compariſon than that of her Actors. In this vaſt Theatre of Time are ſeated the Friend and the Critic; here are Claps and Shouts, Hiſſes and Groans; in ſhort, every Thing which was ever ſeen or heard at the Theatre Royal.</p>
               <p>Let us examine this in one Example: For In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, in the Behaviour of the great Audience on that Scene which Nature was pleaſed to exhibit in the 12th Chapter of the preceding Book, where ſhe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0618300102:13"/>
introduced <hi>Black George</hi> running away with the <hi>500l.</hi> from his Friend and Benefactor.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who ſat in the World's upper Gallery, treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Incident, I am well convinced, with their uſual Vociferation; and every Term of ſcurrilous Reproach was moſt probably vented on that Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
               <p>If we had deſcended to the next Order of Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, we ſhould have found an equal Degree of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence, tho' leſs of Noiſe and Scurrility; yet here the good Women gave <hi>Black George</hi> to the Devil, and many of them expected every Minute that the cloven-footed Gentleman would fetch his own.</p>
               <p>The Pit, as uſual, was no doubt divided: Thoſe who delight in heroic Virtue and perfect Character, objected to the producing ſuch Inſtances of Villainy, without puniſhing them very ſeverely for the Sake of Example. Some of the Author's Friends, cry'd—<q rend="inline">'Look'e, Gentlemen, the Man is a Villain; but it is Nature for all that.'</q> And all the young Critics of the Age, the Clerks, Apprentices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> called it Low, and fell a Groaning.</p>
               <p>As for the Boxes, they behaved with their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed Politeneſs. Moſt of them were attending to ſomething elſe. Some of thoſe few who regarded the Scene at all, declared he was a bad Kind of Man; while others refuſed to give their opinion 'till they had heard the beſt Judges.</p>
               <p>Now we, who are admitted behind the Scenes of this great Theatre of Nature, (and no Author ought to write any Thing beſides Dictionaries and Spelling-Books who hath not this Privilege) can cenſure the Action, without conceiving any abſolute Deteſtation of the Perſon, whom perhaps Nature may not have deſigned to act an ill Part in all her Dramas: For in this Inſtance, Life moſt exactly reſembles the Stage, ſince it is often the ſame Perſon who repreſents the Villain and the Heroe; and he who engages your
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0618300102:14"/>
Admiration To-day, will probably attract your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt To-Morrow. As <hi>Garrick,</hi> whom I regard in Tragedy to be the greateſt Genius the World hath ever produced, ſometimes condeſcends to play the Fool; ſo did <hi>Scipio</hi> the Great and <hi>Laelius</hi> the Wiſe, according to <hi>Horace,</hi> many Years ago: nay, <hi>Cicero</hi> reports them to have been 'incredibly childiſh.'—Theſe, it is true play'd the Fool, like my Friend <hi>Garrick,</hi> in Jeſt only; but ſeveral eminent Characters have, in numberleſs Inſtances of their Lives, played the Fool egregiouſly in Earneſt; ſo far as to render it a Matter of ſome Doubt, whether their Wiſdom or Folly was predominant; or whether they were better intitled to the Applauſe or Cenſure, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration or Contempt, the Love or Hatred of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Perſons, indeed, who have paſſed any Time behind the Scenes of this great Theatre, and are thoroughly acquainted not only with the ſeveral Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes which are there put on, but alſo with the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtic and capricious Behaviour of the Paſſions who are the Managers and Directors of this Theatre, (for as to Reaſon the Patentee, he is known to be a very idle Fellow, and ſeldom to exert himſelf) may moſt probably have learned to conſtrue the famous <hi>Nil admirari</hi> of <hi>Horace,</hi> or in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Phraſe, <hi>To ſtare at nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A ſingle bad Act no more conſtitutes a Villain in Life, than a ſingle bad Part on the Stage. The Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, like the Managers of a Playhouſe, often force Men upon Parts, without conſulting their Judgment, and ſometimes without any Regard to their Talents. Thus the Man, as well as the Player, may condemn what he himſelf acts; nay, it is common to ſee Vice ſit as awkwardly on ſome Men, as the Character of <hi>Iago</hi> would on the honeſt Face of Mr. <hi>William Mills.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0618300102:15"/>
Upon the whole then, the Man of Candour and of true Underſtanding, is never haſty to condemn. He can cenſure an Imperfection, or even a Vice, without Rage againſt the guilty Party. In a Word, they are the ſame Folly, the ſame Childiſhneſs, the ſame Ill-breeding, and the ſame Ill-nature, which raiſe all the Clamours and Uproars both in Life and on the Stage. The worſt of Men generally have the Words <hi>Rogue</hi> and <hi>Villain</hi> moſt in their Mouths, as the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of all Wretches are the apteſt to cry out <hi>low</hi> in the Pit.</p>

               <p>Many contending Paſſions were raiſed in our He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roe's Mind by this Letter; but the Tender prevailed at laſt over the Indignant and Iraſcible, and a Flood of Tears came ſeaſonably to his Aſſiſtance, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly prevented his Misfortunes from either turning his Head, or burſting his Heart.</p>
               <p>He grew, however ſoon aſhamed of indulging this Remedy; and ſtarting up, he cried, <q rend="inline">'Well then, I will give Mr. <hi>Allworthy</hi> the only Inſtance he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of my Obedience. I will go this Moment—but whither?—why let Fortune direct; ſince there is no other who thinks it of any Conſequence what becomes of this wretched Perſon, it ſhall be a Matter of equal Indifference to myſelf. Shall I alone regard what no other?—Ha! have I not Reaſon to think there is another?—One whoſe Value is above that of the whole World!—I may, I muſt imagine my <hi>Sophia</hi> is not indifferent to what becomes of me. Shall I then leave this only Friend—and ſuch a Friend? Shall I not ſtay with her?—Where? How can I ſtay with her? Have I any Hopes of even ſeeing her, tho' ſhe was as deſirous as myſelf, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing her to the Wrath of her Father? And to what Purpoſe? Can I think of ſoliciting ſuch a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to Conſent to her own Ruin? Shall I indulge any Paſſion of mine at ſuch a Price?—Shall I lurk about this Country like a Thief, with ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions?—No, I diſdain, I deteſt the Thought. Farewel, <hi>Sophia;</hi> farewel moſt lovely, moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved—'</q> Here Paſſion ſtopped his Mouth, and found a Vent at his Eyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0618300102:17"/>
And now, having taken a Reſolution to leave the Country, he began to debate with himſelf whither he ſhould go. <hi>The World,</hi> as <hi>Milton</hi> phraſes it, <hi>lay all before him;</hi> and <hi>Jones</hi> no more than <hi>Adam,</hi> had any Man to whom he might reſort for Comfort or Aſſiſtance. All his Acquaintance were the Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of Mr. <hi>Allworthy,</hi> and he had no Reaſon to expect any Countenance from them, as that Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had withdrawn his Favour from him. Men of great and good Characters ſhould indeed be very cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious how they diſcard their Dependents; for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to the unhappy Sufferer is being diſcarded by all others.</p>
               <p>What Courſe of Life to purſue, or to what Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to apply himſelf, was a ſecond Conſideration; and here the Proſpect was all a melancholy Void. Every profeſſion, and every Trade, required Length of Time, and what was worſe, Money; for Matters are ſo Conſtituted that 'Nothing out of Nothing' is not a truer Maxim in Phyſics than in Politics; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man who is greatly deſtitute of Money is on that Account entirely excluded from all Means of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring it.</p>
               <p>At laſt the Ocean, that hoſpitable Friend to the Wretched, opened her capacious Arms to receive him; and he inſtantly reſolved to accept her kind In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation. To expreſs myſelf leſs figuratively, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to go to Sea.</p>
               <p>This Thought indeed no ſooner ſuggeſted itſelf, than he eagerly embraced it; and having preſently hired Horſes, he ſet out for <hi>Briſtol</hi> to put it in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution.</p>
               <p>But before we attend him on his Expedition, we ſhall reſort a while to Mr. <hi>Weſtern</hi>'s, and ſee what farther happened to the charming <hi>Sophia.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Containing ſeveral Dialogues.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE Morning in which Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> departed, Mrs. <hi>Weſtern</hi> ſummoned <hi>Sophia</hi> into her A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, and having firſt accquainted her that ſhe had obtained her Liberty of her Father, ſhe proceeded to read her a long Lecture on the Subject of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; which ſhe treated not as a romantic Scheme of Happineſs ariſing from Love, as it hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the Poets; nor did ſhe mention any of thoſe Purpoſes for which we are taught by Divines to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it as inſtituted by ſacred Authority; ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered it rather as a Fund in which prudent Women depoſited their Fortunes to the beſt Advantage, in order to receive a larger Intereſt for them, than they could have elſewhere.</p>
               <p>When Mrs. <hi>Weſtern</hi> had finiſhed, <hi>Sophia</hi> anſwered, <q rend="inline">'that ſhe was very incapable of arguing with a Lady of her Aunt's ſuperior Knowledge and Experience, eſpecially on a Subject which ſhe had ſo very little conſidered, as this of Matrimony.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'Argue with me, Child!' replied the other, 'I did not indeed expect it. I ſhould have ſeen the World to very little Purpoſe truly, if I am to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue with one of your Years. I have taken this Trouble, in order to inſtruct you. The ancient Philosophers, ſuch as <hi>Socrates, Alcibiades,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, did not uſe to argue with their Scholars. You are to conſider me, Child, as <hi>Socrates,</hi> not aſking your Opinion, but only informing you of mine.'</q> From which laſt Words the Reader may poſſibly imagine, that this Lady had read no more of the Philoſophy of <hi>Socrates,</hi> than ſhe had of that of <hi>Alcibiades;</hi> and indeed we cannot reſolve his Curioſity as to this Point.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0618300102:19"/>
'Madam,' cries <hi>Sophia,</hi> 'I have never preſumed to controvert any Opinion of yours, and this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as I ſaid, I have never yet thought of, and perhaps never may.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'Indeed <hi>Sophy,'</hi> replied the Aunt, 'this Diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation with me is very fooliſh. The <hi>French</hi> ſhall as ſoon perſuade me, that they take foreign Towns in Defence only of their own Country, as you can impoſe on me to believe you have never yet thought ſeriouſly of Matrimony. How can you, Child, affect to deny that you have conſidered of contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Alliance, when you ſo well know I am ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Party with whom you deſire to contract it. An Alliance as unnatural, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to your Intereſt, as a ſeparate League with the <hi>French</hi> would be to the Intereſt of the <hi>Dutch!</hi> But however, if you have not hitherto conſidered of this Matter, I promiſe you it is now high Time; for my Brother is reſolved immediately to conclude the Treaty with Mr. <hi>Blifil;</hi> and indeed I am a ſort of Guarantee in the Affair, and have promiſed your Concurrence.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'Indeed, Madam,' cries <hi>Sophia,</hi> 'this is the only Inſtance in which I muſt diſobey both yourſelf and my Father. For this is a Match which requires very little Conſideration in me to refuſe.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'If I was not as great a Philoſopher as <hi>Socrates</hi> himſelf,' returned Mrs. <hi>Weſtern,</hi> 'you would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come my Patience. What Objection can you have to the young Gentleman?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'A very ſolid Objection, in my Opinion,' ſays <hi>Sophia,—'</hi>I hate him.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'Will you never learn a proper Uſe of Words?' anſwered the Aunt. 'Indeed Child, you ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult <hi>Bailey</hi>'s <hi>Dictionary.</hi> It is impoſſible you ſhould hate a Man from whom you have received no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury. By Hatred, therefore, you mean no more than Diſlike, which is no ſufficient Objection againſt
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0618300102:20"/>
marrying of him. I have known many Couples, who have entirely diſliked each other, lead very comfortable, genteel lives. Believe me, Child, I know theſe Things better than you. You will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me, I think, to have ſeen the World, in which I have not an Acquaintance who would not rather be thought to diſlike her Huſband, than to like him. The contrary is ſuch out-of-Faſhion romantic Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe, that the very imagination of it is ſhocking.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'Indeed, Madam,' replied <hi>Sophia,</hi> 'I ſhall never marry a Man I diſlike. If I promiſe my Father ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to conſent to any Marriage contrary to his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, I think I may hope he will never force me into that State contrary to my own.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'Inclinations!' cries the Aunt with ſome Warmth. 'Inclinations! I am aſtoniſhed at your aſſurance. A young Woman of your Age, and unmarried, to talk of Inclinations! But whatever your Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be, my Brothar is reſolved; nay, ſince you talk of Inclinations, I ſhall adviſe him to haſten the Treaty. Inclinations!</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sophia</hi> then flung herſelf upon her Knees, and Tears began to trickle from her ſhining Eyes. She entreated her Aunt, <q rend="inline">'to have Mercy upon her, and not to reſent ſo cruelly her Unwillingneſs to make herſelf miſerable; often urging that ſhe alone was concerned, and that her Happineſs only was at Stake.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>As a Bailiff, when well authoriſed by his Writ, having poſſeſſed himſelf of the Perſon of ſome unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Debtor, views all his Tears without concern: In vain the wretched Captive attempts to raiſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion; in vain the tender Wife bereft of her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, the little prattling Boy, or frighted Girl, are mentioned as inducements to Reluctance. The no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Bumtrap, blind and deaf, to every Circumſtance of Diſtreſs, greatly riſes above all the Motives to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0618300102:21"/>
and into the Hands of the Goaler reſolves to deliver his miſerable Prey.</p>
               <p>Not leſs blind to the Tears, or leſs deaf to every Entreaty of <hi>Sophia</hi> was the politic Aunt, nor leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined was ſhe to deliver over the trembling Maid into the Arms of the Goaler <hi>Blifil.</hi> She anſwered with great Impetuoſity, <q rend="inline">'So far, Madam, from your being concerned alone, your concern is the leaſt, or ſurely the leaſt important. It is the Honour of your Family which is concerned in this Alliance; you are only the Inſtrument. Do you conceive, Miſtreſs, that in an Intermarriage between King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, as when a Daughter of <hi>France</hi> is married into <hi>Spain,</hi> that the Princeſs herſelf is alone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in the Match? No, it is a match between two Kingdoms, rather than between two Perſons. The ſame happens in great Families, ſuch as ours. The Alliance between the Families is the Principal Matter. You ought to have a greater Regard for the Honour of your Family, than for your own Perſon; and if the Example of a Princeſs cannot inſpire you with theſe noble Thoughts, you cannot ſurely complain at being uſed no worſe than all Princeſſes are uſed.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'I hope, Madam,' cries <hi>Sophia,</hi> with a little Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Voice, 'I ſhall never do any Thing to diſhonour my Family; but as for Mr. <hi>Blifil,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be the Conſequence, I am reſolved againſt him, and no Force ſhall prevail in his Favour.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Weſtern,</hi> who had been within hearing during the greater Part of the preceding Dialogue, had now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted all his Patience; he therefore entered the Room in a violent Paſſion, crying, <q rend="inline">'D—n me then if <hi>ſhatunt</hi> ha' un, d—n me if <hi>ſhatunt,</hi> that's all—that's all—D—n me if <hi>ſhatunt.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Weſtern</hi> had collected a ſufficient Quantity of Wrath for the Uſe of <hi>Sophia;</hi> but ſhe now transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it all to the Squire. <q rend="inline">'Brother,' ſaid ſhe, 'it is
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0618300102:22"/>
aſtoniſhing that you will interfere in a Matter which you had totally left to my Negotiation. Regard to my Family hath made me take upon myſelf to be the mediating Power, in order to rectify thoſe miſtakes in Policy which you have committed in your Daughter's Education. For, Brother, it is you; it is your prepoſterous Conduct which hath eradicated all the Seeds that I had formerly ſown in her tender Mind.—It is yourſelf who have taught her Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience.'</q>—<q rend="inline">'Blood!' cries the Squire, foaming at the Mouth, 'you are enough to conquer the Patience of the Devil! Have I ever taught my Daughter Diſobedience?—Here ſhe ſtands; Speak honeſtly, Girl, did ever I bid you be diſobedient to me? Have I not done every thing to humour and to gratify you, and to make you obedient to me? And very obedient to me ſhe was when a little Child, before you took her in Hand and ſpoiled her, by fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Head with a Pack of Court Notions.—Why—why—why—did not I over-hear you telling her ſhe muſt behave like a Princeſs? You have made a Whig of the Girl; and how ſhould her Father, or any body elſe, expect any Obedience from her?'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Brother,' anſwered Mrs. <hi>Weſtern,</hi> with an Air of great diſdain, 'I cannot expreſs the Contempt I have for your Politics of all Kinds; but I will appeal like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to the young Lady herſelf, whether I have ever taught her any Principles of Diſobedience. On the contrary, Niece, have I not endeavoured to inſpire you with a true Idea of the ſeveral Relations in which a human Creature ſtands in Society? Have I not taken infinite Pains to ſhew you, that the Law of Nature hath enjoined a Duty on Children to their Parents? Have I not told you what <hi>Plato</hi> ſays on that Subject?—A Subject on which you was ſo notoriouſly ignorant when you came firſt under my Care, that I verily believe you did not know the Relation between a Daughter and a Father.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">' 'Tis
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0618300102:23"/>
Lie,' anſwered <hi>Weſtern.</hi> 'The Girl is no ſuch Fool, as to live to eleven Years old without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſhe was her Father's Relation.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'O more than Gothic Ignorance,' anſwered the Lady.— 'And as for your Manners, Brother, I muſt tell you, they deſerve a Cane.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Why then you may gi' it me, if you think you are able,' cries the Squire; 'nay, I ſuppoſe your Niece there will be ready enough to help you.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Brother,' ſaid Mrs. <hi>Weſtern,</hi> 'tho' I diſpiſe you beyond Expreſſion, yet I ſhall endure your Inſolence no longer; ſo I deſire my Coach may be got ready immediately, for I am reſolved to leave your Houſe this very Morning.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'And a good Riddance too,' anſwered he; 'I can bear your Inſolence no longer, an you come to that. Blood! it is almoſt enough of itſelf, to make my Daughter undervalue my Senſe, when ſhe hears you telling me every Minute you deſpiſe me.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'It is impoſſible, it is impoſſible,' cries the Aunt, 'no one can undervalue ſuch a Boor.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">Boar,' anſwered the Squire, 'I am no Boar; no, nor Aſs; no, nor Rat neither, Madam. Remember that—I am no Rat. I am a ture <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> and not of your <hi>Hanover</hi> Breed, that have eat up the Nation.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">Thou art one of thoſe wiſe Men,' cries ſhe, 'whoſe nonſenſical Principles have undone the Nation; by weakening the Hands of our Government at home, and by diſcouraging our Friends, and encouraging our Enemies abroad.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Ho! are you come back to your Politics,' cries the Squire, 'as for thoſe I deſpiſe them as much as I do a F—t.</q> Which laſt Words he accompanied and graced with the very Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which of all others was the moſt proper to it. And whether it was this Word, or the Contempt expreſt for her Politics, which moſt affected Mrs. <hi>Weſtern,</hi> I will not determine; but ſhe flew into the moſt violent Rage, uttered Phraſes improper to be here related, and inſtantly burſt out of the Houſe.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0618300102:24"/>
Nor did her Brother or her Niece think proper either to ſtop or to follow her: For the one was ſo much poſſeſſed by Concern, and the other by Anger, that they were rendered almoſt motionleſs.</p>
               <p>The Squire, however, ſent after his Siſter the ſame Holla which attends the Departure of a Hare, when ſhe is firſt ſtarted before the Hounds. He was indeed a great Maſter of this Kind of Vociferation, and had a Holla proper for moſt Occaſions in Life.</p>
               <p>Women who, like Mrs. <hi>Weſtern,</hi> know the World, and have applied themſelves to Philoſophy and Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, would have immediately availed themſelves of the preſent Diſpoſition of Mr. <hi>Weſtern</hi>'s Mind; by throwing in a few artful Compliments to his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding at the Expence of his abſent Adverſary; but poor <hi>Sophia</hi> was all Simplicity. By which Word we do not intend to inſinuate to the Reader, that ſhe was ſilly, which is generally underſtood as a ſynonimous Term with ſimple: For ſhe was indeed a moſt ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Girl, and her Underſtanding was of the firſt Rate; but ſhe wanted all that uſeful Art which Females con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert to ſo many good Purpoſes in Life, and which, as it rather ariſes from the Heart, than from the Head, is often the Property of the ſillieſt of Women.</p>

               <p>MR. <hi>Weſtern</hi> having finiſhed his Holla, and taken a little Breath, began to lament, in very pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic Terms, the unfortunate Condition of Men, who are, ſays he, always <hi>whipt in</hi> by the Humours of ſome d—nd B—or other. I think I was <hi>hard run</hi> enough by your Mother for one Man; but after giving her a <hi>Dodge,</hi> here's another B—follows me upon the <hi>Foil;</hi> but curſe my Jacket if I will be <hi>run down</hi> in this Manner by any o'um.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0618300102:25"/>
                  <hi>Sophia</hi> never had a ſingle Diſpute with her Father, till this unlucky Affair of <hi>Blifil,</hi> on any Account, except in Defence of her Mother, whom ſhe had loved moſt tenderly, though ſhe loſt her in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Year of her Age. The Squire, to whom that poor Woman had been a faithful upper Servant all the Time of their Marriage, had returned that Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, by making what the World calls a good Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. He very ſeldom ſwore at her (perhaps not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove once a Week) and never beat her: She had not the leaſt Occaſion for Jealouſy, and was perfect Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs of her Time: for ſhe was never interrupted by her Huſband, who was engaged all the Morning in his Field Exerciſes, and all the Evening with Bottle-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions. She ſcarce indeed ever ſaw him but at Meals; where ſhe had the Pleaſure of carving thoſe Diſhes which ſhe had before attended at the Dreſſing. From theſe Meals ſhe retired about five Minutes after the other Servants, having only ſtayed to drink the King over the Water. Such were, it ſeems, Mr. <hi>Weſtern</hi>'s Orders: For it was a Maxim with him, that Women ſhould come in with the firſt Diſh, and go out after the firſt Glaſs. Obedience to theſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders was perhaps no difficult Taſk: For the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation (if it may be called ſo) was ſeldom ſuch as could entertain a Lady. It conſiſted chiefly of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, Singing, Relations of ſporting Adventures, B—d—y, and Abuſe of Women and of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
               <p>Theſe, however, were the only Seaſons when Mr. <hi>Weſtern</hi> ſaw his Wife: For when he repaired to her Bed, he was generally ſo drunk that he could not ſee; and in the ſporting Seaſon he always roſe from her before it was light. Thus was ſhe perfect Miſtreſs of her Time; and had beſides a Coach and four uſually at her Command; tho' unhappily indeed the Badneſs of the Neighbourhood, and of the Roads, made this of little Uſe: For none who had ſet much Value on
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0618300102:26"/>
their Necks would have paſſed through the one, or who had ſet any Value on their Hours, would have viſited the other. Now to deal honeſtly with the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſhe did not make all the Return expected to ſo much Indulgence: For ſhe had been married againſt her Will, by a fond Father, the Match having been rather advantageous on her Side: For the Squire's Eſtate was upwards of 3000 <hi>l.</hi> a Year, and her For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune no more than a bare 8000 <hi>l.</hi> Hence perhaps ſhe had contracted a little Gloomineſs of Temper: For ſhe was rather a good Servant than a good Wife; nor had ſhe always the Gratitude to return the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Degree of roaring Mirth, with which the Squire received her, even with a good humoured Smile. She would, moreover, ſometimes interfere with Matters which did not concern her, as the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Drinking of her Huſband, which in the gentleſt Terms ſhe would take ſome of the few Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties he gave her of remonſtrating againſt. And once in her Life ſhe very earneſtly entreated him to carry her for two Months to <hi>London,</hi> which he perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily denied; nay, was angry with his Wife for the Requeſt ever after, being well aſſured, that all the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands in <hi>London</hi> are Cuckolds.</p>
               <p>For this laſt, and many other good Reaſons, <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern</hi> at length heartily hated his Wife; and this Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred as he never concealed before her Death, ſo he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver forgot it afterwards; but when any Thing in the leaſt ſoured him, as a bad ſcenting Day, or a Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per among his Hounds, or any other ſuch Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, he conſtantly vented his Spleen by Invectives againſt the Deceaſed; ſaying,—<q rend="inline">'If my Wife was alive now, ſhe would be glad of this.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Invectives he was eſpecially deſirous of throwing forth before <hi>Sophia:</hi> For as he loved her more than he did any other, ſo he was really jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous that ſhe had loved her Mother better than him. And this Jealouſy <hi>Sophia</hi> ſeldom failed of heightening
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0618300102:27"/>
on theſe Occaſions: For he was not contented with violating her Ears with the Abuſe of her Mother; but endeavoured to force an explicit Approbation of all this Abuſe, with which Deſire he never could prevail upon her by any Promiſe or Threats to comply.</p>
               <p>Hence ſome of my Readers will, perhaps, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the Squire had not hated <hi>Sophia</hi> as much as he had hated her Mother; but I muſt inform them, that Hatred is not the Effect of Love, even through the Medium of Jealouſy. It is, indeed, very poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for jealous Perſons to kill the Objects of their Jealouſy, but not to hate them. Which Sentiment being a pretty hard Morſel, and bearing ſomething of the Air of a Paradox, we ſhall leave the Reader to chew the Cud upon it to the End of the Chapter.</p>

                  <hi>SOPHIA</hi> kept Silence during the foregoing Speech of her Father, nor did ſhe once anſwer otherwiſe than with a Sigh; but as he underſtood none of the Language, or as he called it, Lingo of the Eyes, ſo he was not ſatisfied without ſome further Approbation of his Sentiments; which he now demanded in the uſual Way of his Daughter; telling her, <q rend="inline">'he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected ſhe was ready to take the Part of every Body againſt him, as ſhe had always done that of the B—her Mother.'</q> 
                  <hi>Sophia</hi> remaining ſtill ſilent, he cry'd out, <q rend="inline">'What art dumb? why doſt unt ſpeak. Was not thy Mother a d—d B—to me? Anſwer me that. What, I ſuppoſe, you deſpiſe your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too, and don't think him good enough to ſpeak to?'</q>

                  <q rend="inline">'What don't you ſay,' anſwered the Father? 'you have the Impudence to ſay ſhe's in the Right; doth it not follow then of Courſe that I'm in the wrong?

'So far, Sir, from injuring you or your Eſtate,' ſays <hi>Sophia,</hi> 'if my Aunt had died Yeſterday, I am convinced ſhe would have left you her whole Fortune.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Whether <hi>Sophia</hi> intended it or no, I ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to aſſert; but certain it is, theſe laſt Words pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrated very deep into the Ears of her Father, and produced a much more ſenſible Effect than all ſhe had ſaid before. He received the Sound with much the ſame Action as a Man receives a Bullet in his Head. He ſtarted, ſtaggered and turned pale. After which he remained ſilent above a Minute, and then began in the following heſitating Manner. <q rend="inline">'Yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day! ſhe would have left me her Eſteate Yeſterday! would ſhe? Why Yeſterday of all the Days in the Year? I ſuppoſe if ſhe dies To-morrow ſhe will leave it to ſomebody elſe, and perhaps out of the Vamily:'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'My Aunt, Sir,' cries <hi>Sophia,</hi> 'hath very violent Paſſions, and I can't anſwer what ſhe may do under their Influence.'</q>

               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'You can't! returned the Father, 'and pray who hath been the Occaſion of putting her into thoſe violent Paſſions? Nay, who hath actually put her into them? Was not you and ſhe hard at it before I came into the Room? Beſides, was not all our Quarrel about you? I have not quarreled with Siſter theſe many Years but upon your Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; and now you would throw the whole Blame upon me, as thof I ſhould be the Occaſion of her leaving her Eſteate out o' the Vamily. I could have expected no better indeed, this is like the Return you make to all the reſt of my Fondneſs.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'I beſeech you then,' cries <hi>Sophia,</hi> 'upon my Knees I beſeech you, if I have been the unhappy Occaſion of this Difference, that you will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make it up with my Aunt, and not ſuffer her to leave your Houſe in this violent Rage of Anger: She is a very good-natured Woman, and

a few civil Words will ſatisfy her—Let me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you, Sir.'</q>
               </p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sophia</hi> then retired to her Chamber of Mourning, where ſhe indulged herſelf (if the Phraſe may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed me) in all the Luxury of tender Grief. She read over the Letter which ſhe had received from <hi>Jones</hi> more than once; her Muff too was uſed on this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; and ſhe bathed both theſe, as well as herſelf, with her Tears. In this Situation, the friendly Mrs. <hi>Honour</hi> exerted her utmoſt Abilities to comfort her afflicted Miſtreſs. She ran over the Names of many young Gentlemen; and having greatly commended their Parts and Perſons, aſſured <hi>Sophia</hi> that ſhe might take her choice of any. Theſe Methods muſt have certainly been uſed with ſome Succeſs in Diſorders of the like Kind, or ſo ſkilful a Practitioner as Mrs. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> would never have ventured to apply them; nay, I have heard that the College of Chambermaids hold them to be as ſovereign Remedies as any in the female Diſpenſary; but whether it was that <hi>Sophia</hi>'s Diſeaſe differed inwardly, from thoſe Caſes with which it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in external Symptoms, I will not aſſert; but, in Fact, the good Waiting-woman did more Harm than Good, and at laſt ſo incenſed her Miſtreſs (which was no eaſy Matter) that with an angry Voice ſhe diſmiſſed her from her Preſence.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>Containing great Variety of Matter.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE Squire overtook his Siſter juſt as ſhe was ſtepping into the Coach, and partly by Force, and partly by Solicitations, prevailed upon her to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her Horſes back into their Quarters. He ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in this Attempt without much Difficulty: For the Lady was, as we have already hinted, of a moſt placable Diſpoſition, and greatly loved her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, tho' ſhe deſpiſed his Parts, or rather his little Knowledge of the World.</p>
               <p>Poor <hi>Sophia,</hi> who had firſt ſet on Foot this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, was now made the Sacrifice to it. They both concurred in their Cenſures on her Conduct; jointly declared War againſt her; and directly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to Council, how to carry it on in the moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Manner. For this Purpoſe, Mrs. <hi>Weſtern</hi> propoſed not only an immediate Concluſion of the Treaty with <hi>Allworthy;</hi> but as immediately to carry it into Execution; ſaying, <q rend="inline">'That there was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Way to ſucceed with her Niece but by violent Methods, which ſhe was convinced <hi>Sophia</hi> had not ſufficient Reſolution to reſiſt. 'By violent, ſays ſhe, 'I mean rather, haſty Meaſures: For as to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement or abſolute Force, no ſuch Things muſt or can be attempted. Our Plan muſt be concerted for a Surprize, and not for a Storm.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Matters were reſolved on, when Mr. <hi>Blifil</hi> came to pay a Viſit to his Miſtreſs. The Squire no ſooner heard of his Arrival, than he ſtept aſide, by his Siſter's Advice, to give his Daughter Orders for the proper Reception of her Lover; which he did with the moſt bitter Execrations and Denunciations of of Judgment on her Refuſal.</p>
               <p>The Impetuoſity of the Squire bore down all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; and <hi>Sophia,</hi> as her Aunt very wiſely fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0618300102:32"/>
was not able to reſiſt him. She agreed, therefore, to ſee <hi>Blifil,</hi> tho' ſhe had ſcarce Spirits or Strength ſufficient to utter her Aſſent. Indeed to give a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emtory Denial to a Father whom ſhe ſo tenderly loved, was no eaſy Taſk. Had this Circumſtance been out of the Caſe, much leſs Reſolution than what ſhe was really Miſtreſs of, would, perhaps, have ſerved her; but it is no unuſual Thing to aſcribe thoſe Actions entirely to Fear, which are in a great Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure produced by Love.</p>
               <p>In Purſuance, therefore, of her Father's peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Command, <hi>Sophia</hi> now admitted Mr. <hi>Blifil</hi>'s Viſit. Scenes, like this, when painted at large, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, as we have obſerved, very little Entertainment to the Reader. Here, therefore, we ſhall ſtrictly adhere to a Rule of <hi>Horace;</hi> by which Writers are directed to paſs over all thoſe Matters, which they deſpair of placing in a ſhining Light. A Rule, we conceive, of excellent Uſe as well to the Hiſtorian as to the Poet; and which, if followed, muſt, at leaſt, have this good Effect, that many a great Evil (for ſo all great Books are called) would thus be reduced to a ſmall one.</p>
               <p>It is poſſible the great Art uſed by <hi>Blifil</hi> at this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview, would have prevailed on <hi>Sophia</hi> to have made another Man in his Circumſtances her Confident, and to have revealed the whole Secret of her Heart to him; but ſhe had contracted ſo ill an Opinion of this young Gentleman, that ſhe was reſolved to place no Confidence in him: For Simplicity, when ſet on it's Guard, is often a Match for Cunning. Her Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to him, therefore, was entirely forced, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſuch as is generally preſcribed to Virgins upon the ſecond formal Viſit from one who is appointed for their Huſband.</p>
               <p>But tho' <hi>Blifil</hi> declared himſelf perfectly ſatisfied with his Reception to the Squire, yet that Gentleman, who in Company with his Siſter had overheard all,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0618300102:33"/>
was not ſo well pleaſed. He reſolved, in Purſuance of the Advice of the ſage Lady, to puſh Matters as forward as poſſible; and addreſſing himſelf to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Son-in-Law in the hunting Phraſe, he cry'd after a loud Holla, <q rend="inline">'Follow her, Boy, follow her; run in, run in, that's it, Honeys. Dead, dead, dead.—Never be baſhful, nor ſtand ſhall I, ſhall I?<hi>—Allworthy</hi> and I can finiſh all Matters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us this Afternoon, and let us ha' the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding To-morrow.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Blifil</hi> having conveyed the utmoſt Satisfaction into his Countenance, anſwered; <q rend="inline">'As there is nothing, Sir, in this World, which I ſo eagerly deſire as an Alliance with your Family, except my Union with the moſt amiable and deſerving <hi>Sophia,</hi> you may eaſily imagine how impatient I muſt be to ſee my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Poſſeſſion of my two higheſt Wiſhes. If I have not therefore importuned you on this Head, you will impute it only to my Fear of offending the Lady, by endeavouring to hurry on ſo bleſſed an Event, faſter than a ſtrict Compliance with all the Rules of Decency and Decorum will permit. But if by your Intereſt, Sir, ſhe might be induced to diſpence with any Formalities.'—</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'Formalities! with a Pox!' anſwered the Squire, 'Pooh, all Stuff and Nonſenſe. I tell thee, ſhe ſhall ha' thee To-morrow; you will know the World better hereafter, when you come to my Age. Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men never gi' their Conſent, Man, if they can help it, 'tis not the Faſhion. If I had ſtaid for her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother's Conſent, I might have been a Batchelor to this Day.—To her, to her, to her, that's it, you jolly Dog. I tell thee ſhat ha' her To-morrow Morning.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Blifil</hi> ſuffered himſelf to be overpowered by the forcible Rhetoric of the Squire; and it being agreed that <hi>Weſtern</hi> ſhould cloſe with <hi>Allworthy</hi> that very Afternoon, the Lover departed home, having firſt
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0618300102:34"/>
earneſtly begged that no Violence might be offered to the Lady by this Haſte, in the ſame Manner as a Popiſh Inquiſitor begs the Lay Power to do no Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to the Heretic, delivered over to it, and againſt whom the Church hath paſſed Sentence.</p>
               <p>And to ſay the Truth, <hi>Blifil</hi> had paſſed Sentence againſt <hi>Sophia;</hi> for however pleaſed he had declared himſelf to <hi>Weſtern,</hi> with his Reception, he was by no means ſatisfied, unleſs it was that he was ſatisfied of the Hatred and Scorn of his Miſtreſs; and this had produced no leſs reciprocal Hatred and Scorn in him. It may, perhaps, be aſked, Why then did he not put an immediate End to all further Courtſhip? I anſwer, for that very Reaſon, as well as for ſeveral others equally good, which we ſhall now proceed to open to the Reader.</p>
               <p>Tho' Mr. <hi>Blifil</hi> was not of the Complexion of <hi>Jones,</hi> nor ready to eat every Woman he ſaw, yet he was far from being deſtitute of that Appetite which is ſaid to be the common Property of Animals. With this, he had the diſtinguiſhing Taſte, which ſerves to direct Men in their Choice of the Objects, or Food of their ſeveral Appetites; and this taught him to conſider <hi>Sophia</hi> as a moſt delicious Morſel, indeed to regard her with the ſame Deſires which an Ortolan in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires into the Soul on Epicure. Now the Agonies which affected the Mind of <hi>Sophia</hi> rather augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than impaired her Beauty; for her Tears added Brightneſs to her Eyes, and her Breaſts roſe higher with her Sighs. Indeed no one hath ſeen Beauty in its higheſt Luſtre, who hath never ſeen it in Diſtreſs. <hi>Blifil</hi> therefore looked on this human Ortolan with greater Deſire than when he had viewed her laſt; nor was his Deſire at all leſſened by the Averſion which he diſcovered in her to himſelf. On the contrary, this ſerved rather to heighten the Pleaſure he propoſed in rifling her Charms, as it added Triumph to Luſt; nay, he had ſome further Views, from obtaining the abſolute Poſſeſſion of her Perſon, which we deteſt too
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0618300102:35"/>
much even to mention; and Revenge itſelf was not without its Share in the Gratifications which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed himſelf. the rivalling poor <hi>Jones,</hi> and ſupplant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in her Affections, added another Spur to his Purſuit, and promiſed another additional Rapture to his Enjoyment.</p>
               <p>Beſides all theſe Views, which to ſome ſcrupulous Perſons may ſeem to ſavour too much of Malevolence, he had one Proſpect, which few Readers will regard with any great Abhorrence. And this was the Eſtate of Mr. <hi>Weſtern;</hi> which was all to be ſettled on his Daughter and her Iſſue; for ſo extravagant was the Affection of that fond Parent, that provided his Child would but conſent to be miſerable with the Huſband he choſe, he cared not at what Price he purchaſed him.</p>
               <p>For theſe Reaſons Mr. <hi>Blifil</hi> was ſo deſirous of the Match, that he intended to deceive <hi>Sophia,</hi> by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending Love to her; and to deceive her Father and his own Uncle, by pretending he was beloved by her. In doing this, he availed himſelf of the Piety of <hi>Thwackum,</hi> who held, that if the End propoſed was religious (as ſurely Matrimony is) it mattered not how wicked were the Means. As, to other Occaſions he uſed to apply the Philoſophy of <hi>Square,</hi> which taught, that the End was immaterial, ſo that the Means were fair and conſiſtent with moral Rectitude. To ſay Truth, there were few Occurrences in Life on which he could not draw Advantantage from the Precepts of one or other of thoſe great Maſters.</p>
               <p>Little Deceit was indeed neceſſary to be practiſed on Mr. <hi>Weſtern;</hi> who thought the Inclinations of his Daughter of as little Conſequence, as <hi>Blifil</hi> himſelf conceived them to be; but as the Sentiments of Mr. <hi>Allworthy</hi> were of a very different Kind, ſo it was abſolutely neceſſary to impoſe on him. In this, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, <hi>Blifil</hi> was ſo well aſſiſted by <hi>Weſtern,</hi> that he ſucceeded without Difficulty: For as Mr. <hi>Allworthy</hi> had been aſſured by her Father that <hi>Sophia</hi> had a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0618300102:36"/>
proper Affection for <hi>Blifil,</hi> and that all which he had ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected concerning <hi>Jones,</hi> was entirely falſe, <hi>Blifil</hi> had nothing more to do, than to confirm theſe Aſſertions; which he did with ſuch Equivocations, that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved a Salvo for his Conſcience; and had the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of conveying a Lie to his Uncle, without the Guilt of telling one. When he was examined touching the Inclinations of <hi>Sophia,</hi> by <hi>Allworthy,</hi> who ſaid, <q rend="inline">'he would, on no Account, be acceſſary to the forcing a young Lady into a Marriage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to her own Will,'</q> he anſwered, <q rend="inline">'That the real Sentiments of young Ladies were very difficult to be underſtood; that her Behaviour to him was full as forward as he wiſhed it, and that if he could believe her Father, ſhe had all the Affection for him which any Lover could deſire. As for <hi>Jones,'</hi> ſaid he, 'whom I am loth to call Villain, tho' his Behaviour to you, Sir, ſufficiently juſtifies the Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, his own Vanity, or perhaps ſome wicked Views, might make him boaſt of a Falſhood; for if there had been any Reality in Miſs <hi>Weſtern</hi>'s Love to him, the Greatneſs of her Fortune would never have ſuffered him to deſert her, as you are well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed he hath. Laſtly, Sir, I promiſe you I would not myſelf, for any Conſideration, no not for the whole World, conſent to marry this young Lady, if I was not perſuaded ſhe had all the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for me which I deſire ſhe ſhould have.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This excellent Method of conveying a Falſhood with the Heart only, without making the Tongue guilty of an Untruth, by the Means of Equivocation and Impoſture, hath quieted the Conſcience of many a notable Deceiver; and yet when we conſider that it is Omniſcience on which theſe endeavour to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, it may poſſibly ſeem capable only of affording a very ſuperficial Comfort; and that this artful and refined Diſtinction between communicating a Lie,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0618300102:37"/>
and telling one, is hardly worth the Pains it coſts them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Allworthy</hi> was pretty well ſatisfied with what Mr. <hi>Weſtern</hi> and Mr. <hi>Blifil</hi> told him; and the Treaty was now at the End of two Days, concluded. Nothing then remained previous to the Office of the Prieſt, but the Office of the Lawyers, which threatened to take up ſo much Time, that <hi>Weſtern</hi> offered to bind himſelf by all Manner of Covenants, rather than to defer the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the young Couple. Indeed he was ſo very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and preſſing, that an indifferent Perſon might have concluded he was more a Principal in this Match than he really was: But this Eagerneſs was natural to him on all Occaſions; and he conducted every Scheme he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook in ſuch a Manner, as if the Succeſs of that alone was ſufficient to conſtitute the whole Happineſs of his Life.</p>
               <p>The joint Importunities of both Father and Son-in-law would probably have prevailed on Mr. <hi>All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy,</hi> who brooked but ill any Delay of giving Happineſs to others, had not <hi>Sophia</hi> herſelf prevented it, and taken Meaſures to put a final End to the whole Treaty, and to rob both Church and Law of thoſe Taxes which theſe wiſe Bodies have thought proper to receive from the Propagation of the human Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, in a lawful Manner.

               </head>
               <p>THO' Mrs. <hi>Honour</hi> was principally attached to her Intereſt, ſhe was not without ſome little Attachment to <hi>Sophia.</hi> To ſay Truth, it was very difficult for any one to know that young Lady with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out loving her. She no ſooner, therefore, heard a
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0618300102:38"/>
Piece of News, which ſhe imagined to be of great Importance to her Miſtreſs, than quite forgetting the Anger which ſhe had conceived two Days before, at her unpleaſant Diſmiſſion from <hi>Sophia</hi>'s Preſence, ſhe ran haſtily to inform her of this News.</p>
               <p>The Beginning of her Diſcourſe was as abrupt as her Entrance into the Room. <q rend="inline">'O dear Ma'am,' ſays ſhe, 'what doth your La'ſhip think? To be ſure, I am frightened out of my Wits; and yet I thought it my Duty to tell your La'ſhip, tho' per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it may make you angry, for we Servants don't always know what will make our Ladies angry; for to be ſure, every thing is always laid to the Charge of a Servant. When our Ladies are out of Humour, to be ſure we muſt be ſcolded, and to be ſure I ſhould not wonder if your La'ſhip ſhould be out of Humour; nay, it muſt ſurprize you certainly, ay, and ſhock you too.'</q>—<q rend="inline">'Good <hi>Honour!</hi> let me know it without any longer Preface,' ſays <hi>Sophia;</hi> 'there are few Things, I promiſe you, which will ſurprize, and fewer which will ſhock me.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">Dear Ma'am, anſwered ed <hi>Honour,</hi> 'to be ſure, I overheard my Maſter talking to Parſon <hi>Supple</hi> about getting a Licence this very Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon; and to be ſure I heard him ſay your La'ſhip ſhould be married To-marrow Morning.'</q> 
                  <hi>Sophia</hi> turned pale at theſe Words, and repeated eagerly, <q rend="inline">'To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow Morning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  </q>—<q rend="inline">Yes, Madam,' replied the truſty Waiting-woman, 'I will take my Oath. I heard my Maſter ſay ſo.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">

                  <q rend="inline">I wiſh I was able to adviſe your La'ſhip,' ſays ſhe.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Do, adviſe me,' cries <hi>Sophia,</hi> 'pray dear <hi>Honour</hi> adviſe me. Think what you would attempt if it was your own Caſe.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">Indeed, Ma'am,' cries <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> 'I wiſh your La'ſhip and I could change Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; that is, I mean, without hurting your La'ſhip,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0618300102:39"/>
for to be ſure, I don't wiſh you ſo bad as to be a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; but becauſe that if ſo be it was my Caſe, I ſhould find no Manner of Difficulty in it; for in my poor Opinion, young Squire <hi>Blifil</hi> is a charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſweet, handſome Man.'</q>—<q rend="inline">'Don't mention ſuch Stuff,'</q> cries <hi>Sophia.'</hi>—<q rend="inline">Such Stuff,' repeated <hi>Honour,</hi> 'why there—Well, to be ſure, what's one Man's Meat is another Man's Poiſon, and the ſame is altogether as true of Women.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>Honour,'</hi> ſays <hi>Sophia,</hi> 'rather than Submit to be the Wife of that contemptible Wretch, I would plunge a Dagger into my Heart.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'O lud, Ma'am,' anſwered the other, 'I am ſure you frighten me out of my Wits now. Let me beſeech your La'ſhip not to ſuffer ſuch wicked Thoughts to come into your Head. O lud to be ſure I tremble every Inch of me. Dear Ma'am conſider—that to be denied Chriſtian Burial, and to have your Corpſe buried in the Highway, and a Stake drove through you, as Farmer <hi>Halfpenny</hi> was ſerved at <hi>Ox-Croſs,</hi> and, to be ſure, his Ghoſt hath walked there ever ſince; for ſeveral People have ſeen him. To be ſure it can be nothing but the Devil which can put ſuch wicked Thoughts into the Head of any body; for certainly it is leſs wicked to hurt all the World than one's own dear Self, and ſo I have heard ſaid by more Parſons than one. If your La'ſhip hath ſuch a violent Averſion, and hates the young Gentleman ſo very bad, that you can't bear to think of going into Bed to him; for to be ſure there may be ſuch Antipathies in Nature, and one had lieverer touch a Toad than the Fleſh of ſome People.—</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sophia</hi> had been too much wraped in Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to pay any great Attention to the foregoing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Diſcourſe of her Maid; interrupting her there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, without making any anſwer to it, ſhe ſaid, <q rend="inline">'<hi>Honour,</hi> I am come to a Reſolution. I am deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to leave my Father's Houſe this very Night;

and if you have the Friendſhip for me which you have often profeſſed, you will keep me Company.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'That I will, Ma'am, to the World's End,' an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Honour;</hi> 'but I beg your La'ſhip to conſider the Conſequence before you undertake any raſh Action. Where can your La'ſhip poſſibly go?'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'There is,' replied <hi>Sophia,</hi> 'a Lady of Quality in <hi>London,</hi> a Relation of mine, who ſpent ſeveral Months with my Aunt in the Country; during all which Time ſhe treated me with great Kindneſs, and expreſſed ſo much Pleaſure in my Company, that ſhe earneſtly deſired my Aunt to ſuffer me to go with her to <hi>London.</hi> As ſhe is a Woman of very great Note, I ſhall eaſily find her out, and I make no Doubt of being very well and kindly received by her.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'I would not have your La'ſhip too con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of that,' cries <hi>Honour;</hi> 'for the firſt Lady I lived with uſed to invite People very earneſtly to her Houſe; but if ſhe heard afterwards they were coming, ſhe uſed to get out of the Way. Beſides, tho' this Lady would be very glad to ſee your La'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as to be ſure any body would be glad to ſee your La'ſhip, yet when ſhe hears your La'ſhip is run away from my Maſter'</q>—<q rend="inline">'You are miſtaken, <hi>Honour'</hi> ſays <hi>Sophia,</hi> 'ſhe looks upon the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of a Father in a much lower Light than I do; for ſhe preſſed me violently to go to <hi>London</hi> with her, and when I refuſed to go without my Father's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ſhe laughed me to Scorn, called me ſilly Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Girl, and ſaid I ſhould make a pure loving Wife, ſince I could be ſo dutiful a Daughter. So I have no Doubt but ſhe will both receive me, and protect me too, till my Father, finding me out of his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, can be brought to ſome Reaſon.'</q>

how Matters ſtand between my Maſter and your La'ſhip, <hi>Robin</hi> will be hanged before he will ſuffer it to go out of the Stable without my Maſter's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Orders.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'I intend to eſcape,' ſaid <hi>Sophia,</hi> by walking out of the Doors when they are open. I thank Heaven my Legs are very able to carry me. They have ſupported me many a long Evening, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Fiddle, with no very agreeable Partner; and ſurely they will aſſiſt me in running from ſo deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Partner for Life,'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'O Heavens, Ma'am, doth your La'ſhip know what you are ſaying?' cries <hi>Honour,</hi> 'would you think of walking about the Country by Night and alone?'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Not alone,' an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Lady, 'you have promiſed to bear me Company.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline"> 'Yes, to be ſure,' cries <hi>Honour,</hi> 'I will follow your La'ſhip through the World; but your La'ſhip had almoſt as good be alone; for I ſhall not be able to defend you, if any Robbers, or other Villians, ſhould meet with you. Nay, I ſhould be in as horrible a Fright as your La'ſhip; for to be certain, they would raviſh us both. Beſides, Ma'am, conſider how cold the Nights are now, we ſhall be frozen to Death.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'A good briſk Pace,' anſwered <hi>Sophia,</hi> 'will preſerve us from the Cold; and if you cannot defend me from a Villain, <hi>Honour,</hi> I will defend you; for I will take a Piſtol with me. There are two always charged in the Hall.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Dear Ma'am, you frighten me more and more,' cries <hi>Honour,</hi> 'ſure your La'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip would not venture to fire it off! I had rather run any Chance, than your La'ſhip ſhould do that.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Why ſo?' ſays <hi>Sophia,</hi> 'ſmiling; would not you, <hi>Honour,</hi> fire a Piſtol at any one who ſhould attack your Virtue?'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">To be ſure, Ma'am,' cries <hi>Honour,</hi> 'one's Virtue is a dear Thing, eſpecially to us poor Servants; for it is our Livelihoood, as a Body may ſay, yet I mortally hate Fire-arms; for ſo many Accidents happen by them.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Well, well,'
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0618300102:42"/>
ſays <hi>Sophia,</hi> 'I believe I may enſure your Virtue at a very cheap Rate, without carrying any Arms with us; for I intend to take Horſes at the very firſt Town we come to, and we ſhall hardly be attacked in our Way thither. Look'ee, <hi>Honour,</hi> I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to go, and if you will attend me, I promiſe you I will reward you to the very utmoſt of my Power.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>This laſt Argument had a ſtronger Effect on <hi>Honour</hi> than all the preceding. And ſince ſhe ſaw her Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs ſo determined, ſhe deſiſted from any further Diſſuaſions. They then entered into a Debate on Ways and Means of executing their Project. Here a very ſtubborn Difficulty occurred, and this was the Removal of their Effects, which was much more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily got over by the Miſtreſs than by the Maid: For when a Lady hath once taken a Reſolution to run to a Lover, or to run from him, all Obſtacles are conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as Trifles. But <hi>Honour</hi> was inſpired by no ſuch Motive: ſhe had no Raptures to expect, nor any Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors to ſhun, and beſides the real Value of her Clothes, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> which conſiſted great Part of her Fortune, ſhe had a capricious Fondneſs for ſeveral Gowns, and other Things; either becauſe they became her, or becauſe they were given her by ſuch a particular Perſon; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe had brought them lately, or becauſe ſhe had had them long; or for ſome other Reaſons equally good; ſo that ſhe could not endure the Thought of leaving the poor Things behind her expoſed to the Mercy of <hi>Weſtern,</hi> who, ſhe doubted not, would make them ſuffer Martyrdom in his Rage.</p>
               <p>The ingenious Mrs. <hi>Honour</hi> having applied all her Oratory to diſſuade her Miſtreſs from her Purpoſe, when the found her poſitively determined, at laſt ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the following Expedient to remove her Clothes, <hi>viz.</hi> to get herſelf turned out of Doors that very Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Sophia</hi> highly approved this Method, but doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how it might be brought about. <q rend="inline">'Oh! Ma'am,'
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0618300102:43"/>
cries <hi>Honour,</hi> 'your La'ſhip may truſt that to me; we Servants very well know how to obtain this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of our Maſters and Miſtreſſes; tho' ſometimes indeed where they owe us more Wages than they can readily pay, they will put up with all our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts, and will hardly take any Warning we can give them; but the Squire is none of thoſe; and ſince your La'ſhip is reſolved upon ſetting out to Night, I warrant I get diſcharged this Afternoon.'</q> It was then reſolved that ſhe ſhould pack up ſome Linnen, and a Night-gown for <hi>Sophia,</hi> with her own Things; and as for all her other Clothes, the young Lady abandoned them with no more Remorſe than the Sailor feels when he throws over the Goods of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in order to ſave his own Life.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. <hi>Containing Scenes of Altercation, of no very uncommon Kind.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>MRS. <hi>Honour</hi> had ſcarce ſooner parted from her young Lady, than ſomething (for I would not, like the old Woman in <hi>Quivedo,</hi> injure the Devil by any falſe Accuſation, and poſſibly he might have no Hand in it) but ſomething, I ſay, ſuggeſted to her, that by ſacrificing <hi>Sophia</hi> and all her Secrets to Mr. <hi>Weſtern,</hi> ſhe might probably make her Fortune. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Conſiderations urged this Diſcovery. The fair Proſpect of a handſome Reward for ſo great and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable a Service to the Squire, tempted her Avarice; and again, the Danger of the Enterprize ſhe had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken; the Incertainty of its Succeſs; Night, Cold, Robbers, Raviſhers, all alarmed her Fears. So for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly did all theſe operate upon her, that ſhe was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt determined to go directly to the Squire, and to lay open the whole Affair. She was, however, too upright a Judge to decree on one Side before ſhe had heard the other. And here, firſt, a Journey to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> appeared very ſtrongly in Support of <hi>Sophia.</hi> She
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0618300102:44"/>
eagerly longed to ſee a Place in which ſhe fancied Charms ſhort only of thoſe which a raptured Saint imagines in Heaven. In the next Place, as ſhe knew <hi>Sophia</hi> to have much more Generoſity than her Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſo her Fidelity promiſed her a greater Reward than ſhe could gain by Treachery. She then croſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>examined all the Articles which had raiſed her Fears on the other Side, and found, on fairly ſifting the Matter, that there was very little in them. And now both Scales being reduced to a pretty even Ballance, her Love to her Miſtreſs being thrown into the Scale of her Integrity, made that rather preponderate, when a Circumſtance ſtruck upon her Imagination, which might have had a dangerous Effect, had its whole Weight been fairly put into the other Scale. This was the Length of Time which muſt intervene before <hi>Sophia</hi> would be able to fulfil her Promiſe; for tho' ſhe was intitled to her Mother's Fortune, at the Death of her Father, and to the Sum of <hi>3000l.</hi> left her by an Uncle when ſhe came of Age; yet theſe were diſtant Days, and many Accidents might prevent the intended Generoſity of the young Lady, whereas the Rewards ſhe might expect from Mr. <hi>Weſtern</hi> were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate. But while ſhe was purſuing this Thought, the good Genius of <hi>Sophia,</hi> or that which preſided over the Integrity of Mrs. <hi>Honour,</hi> or perhaps mere Chance, ſent an Accident in her Way, which at once preſerved her Fidelity, and even facilitated their intended Buſineſs.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Weſtern</hi>'s Maid claimed great Superiority over Mrs. <hi>Honour,</hi> on ſeveral Accounts. Firſt, her Birth was higher: For her great Grand-mother by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Side was a Couſin, not far removed, to an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Peer. Secondly, her Wages were greater. And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſhe had been at <hi>London,</hi> and had of Conſequence ſeen more of the World. She had always behaved, therefore, to Mrs. <hi>Honour</hi> with that Reſerve, and had always exacted of her thoſe Marks of Diſtinction, which every Order of Females preſerve and require in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0618300102:45"/>
Converſation with thoſe of an inferior Order. Now as <hi>Honour</hi> did not at all Times agree with this Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine; but would frequently break in upon the Reſpect which the other demanded, Mrs <hi>Weſtern</hi>'s Maid was not at all pleaſed with her Company: Indeed, ſhe ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly longed to return home to the Houſe of her Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, where ſhe domineered at Will over all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Servants. She had been greatly, therefore, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed in the Morning when Mrs. <hi>Weſtern</hi> had changed her Mind on the very Point of Departure, and had been in what is vulgarly called, a glouting Humour ever ſince.</p>
               <p>In this Humour, which was none of the ſweeteſt, ſhe came into the Room where <hi>Honour</hi> was debating with herſelf, in the Manner we have above related. <hi>Honour</hi> no ſooner ſaw her, than ſhe addreſſed her in the following obliging Phraſe. <q rend="inline">'Soh! Madam, I find we are to have the Pleaſure of your Company longer, which I was afraid the Quarrel between my Maſter and your Lady would have robbed us of.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'I don't know, Madam,' anſwered the other, 'who you mean by We and Us. I aſſure you I do not look on any of the Servants in this Houſe to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Company for me. I am Company, I hope, for their Betters every Day in the Week. I do not ſpeak on your Account, Mrs. <hi>Honour;</hi> for you are a civilized young Woman; and when you have ſeen a little more of the World, I ſhould not be aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to walk with you in <hi>St. James</hi>'s Park.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Hoity! toity!' cries <hi>Honour,</hi> Madam is in her Airs, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt. Mrs. <hi>Honour</hi> forſooth! ſure, Madam, you might call me by my Sir-name; for tho' my Lady calls me <hi>Honour,</hi> I have a Sir-name as well as other Folks. Aſhamed to walk with me, quotha!

                  <q rend="inline">'Since you make ſuch a Return to my Civility,' ſaid the other, I muſt acquaint you, Mrs. <hi>Honour,</hi> that you are not ſo good as me. In the Country one is indeed oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0618300102:46"/>
to take up with all kind of Trumpery, but in Town I viſit none but the Women of Women of Quality. Indeed, Mrs. <hi>Honour,</hi> there is ſome Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, I hope, between you and me.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'I hope ſo too,' anſwered <hi>Honour,</hi> 'there is ſome Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in our Ages, and—I think in our Perſons.'</q> Upon ſpeaking which laſt Words, ſhe ſtrutted by Mrs. <hi>Weſtern</hi>'s Maid with the moſt provoking Air of Contempt; turning up her Noſe, toſſing her Head, and violently bruſhing the Hoop of her Competitor with her own. The other Lady put on one of her moſt malicious Sneers, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">'Creature! you are below my Anger; and it is beneath me to give ill Words to ſuch an audacious ſaucy Trollop; but, Huſſy, I muſt tell you, your Breeding ſhews the Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your Birth as well as of your Education; and both very properly qualify you to be the mean ſerving Woman of a Country Girl.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Don't a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe my Lady,' cries <hi>Honour,</hi> 'I won't take that of you; ſhe's as much better than yours as ſhe is younger, and ten thouſand Times more handſomer.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here rather ill Luck, or rather good Luck ſent Mrs. <hi>Weſtern</hi> to ſee her Maid in Tears, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to flow plentifully at her Approach; and of which being aſked the Reaſon by her Miſtreſs, ſhe preſently acquainted her, that her Tears were oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by the rude Treatment of that Creature there, meaning <hi>Honour.</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">'And, Madam,' conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſhe, 'I could have deſpiſed all ſhe ſaid to me; but ſhe had the Audacity to affront your Ladyſhip, and to call you ugly—Yes, Madam, ſhe called you ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly old Cat to my Face.

                  <q rend="inline">Diſreſpect Madam! anſwered <hi>Honour,</hi>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:0618300102:47"/>
I never mentioned your Name at all. I ſaid ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body was not as handſome as my Miſtreſs, and to be ſure you know that as well as I.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">Huſſy, 're<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the Lady, 'I will make ſuch a ſaucy Trol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop as yourſelf, know that I am not a proper Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of your Diſcourſe. And if my Brother doth not diſcharge you this Moment, I will never ſleep in his Houſe again. I will find him out and have you diſcharged this Moment.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Diſcharged!' cries <hi>Honour,</hi> 'and ſuppoſe I am, there are more Places in the World than one. Thank Heaven, good Servants need not want Places; and if you turn away all who do not think you handſome, you will want Servants very ſoon, let me tell you that.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Weſtern</hi> ſpoke, or rather thundered in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; but as ſhe was hardly articulate, we cannot be very certain of the Identical Words: We ſhall, therefore, omit inſerting a Speech, which, at beſt, would not greatly redound to her Honour.

               </head>
               <p>LOgicians ſometimes prove too much by an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, and Politicians often overreach them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a Scheme. Thus had it like to have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to Mrs. <hi>Honour,</hi> who inſtead of recovering the reſt of her Clothes, had like to have ſtopped even thoſe ſhe had on her Back from eſcaping: For the Squire no ſooner heard of her having abuſed his Siſter, than he ſwore twenty Oaths he would ſend her to <hi>Bridewell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Weſtern</hi> was a very good-natured Woman, and ordinarily of a forgiving Temper. She had lately remitted the Treſpaſs of a Stage-coach Man, who had overturned her Poſt-chaiſe into a Ditch; nay, ſhe had even broken the Law in refuſing to proſecute a High-way-man who had robbed her, not only of a Sum of Money, but of her Ear-rings; at the ſame Time d—ning her, and ſaying, <q rend="inline">'ſuch handſome B—s as you, don't want Jewels to ſet them off, and be d—nd to you.</q> But now, ſo uncertain are our Tempers, and ſo much do we at different Times differ from ourſelves, ſhe would hear of no Mitigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; nor could all the affected Penitence of <hi>Honour,</hi> nor all the Entreaties of <hi>Sophia</hi> for her own Servant, prevail with her to deſiſt from earneſtly deſiring her Brother to execute Juſticeſhip (for it was indeed a Syllable more than Juſtice) on the Wench.</p>
               <p>But luckily the Clerk had a Qualification, which no Clerk to a Juſtice of Peace ought ever to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, namely, ſome Underſtanding in the Law of this
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0618300102:49"/>
Realm. He therefore whiſpered in the Ear of the Juſtice, that he would exceed his Authority by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the Girl to <hi>Bridewell,</hi> as there had been no Attempt to break the Peace; <q rend="inline">'for I am afraid, Sir,' ſays he, 'you cannot legally commit any one to <hi>Bridewell</hi> only for Ill-breeding.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>In the Matters of high Importance, particularly in Caſes relating to the Game, the Juſtice was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways attentive to theſe Admonitions of his Clerk: For, indeed, in executing the Laws under that Head, many Juſtices of Peace ſuppoſe they have a large diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretionary Power. By Virtue of which, under the Notion of ſearching for, and taking away Engines for the Deſtruction of the Game, they often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Treſpaſſes, and ſometimes Felony at their Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
               <p>But this Offence was not of quite ſo high a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor ſo dangerous to the Society. Here, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Juſtice behaved with ſome Attention to the Advice of his Clerk: For, in Fact, he had already had two Informations exhibited againſt him in the King's Bench, and had no Curioſity to try a third.</p>
               <p>The Squire, therefore, putting on a moſt wiſe and ſignificant Countenance, after a Preface of ſeveral Hum's and Ha's, told his Siſter, that upon more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Deliberation, he was of Opinion that <q rend="inline">as there was no breaking up of the Peace,  ſuch as the Law, ſays he, 'calls breaking open a Door, or breaking a Hedge, or breaking a Head; or any ſuch Sort of Breaking; the Matter did not amount to a feloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Kind of a Thing, nor Treſpaſſes nor Damages, and, therefore, there was no Puniſhment in the Law for it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Weſtern</hi> ſaid, <q rend="inline">'ſhe knew the Law much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; that ſhe had known Servants very ſeverely puniſhed for affronting their Maſters; and then named a certain Juſtice of the Peace in <hi>London,</hi> who,' ſhe ſaid, 'would commit a Servant to <hi>Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0618300102:50"/>
at any Time when a Maſter or Miſtreſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'Like enough, cries the Squire, 'it may be ſo in <hi>London;</hi> but the Law is different in the Country.—'</q> Here followed a very learned Diſpute between the Brother and Siſter concerning the Law, which we would inſert, if we imagined many of our Readers could underſtand it. This was, however, at length referred by both Parties to the Clerk, who decided it in Favour of the Magiſtrate; and Mrs. <hi>Weſtern</hi> was, in the End, obliged to content herſelf with the Satisfaction of having <hi>Honour</hi> turned away; to which <hi>Sophia</hi> herſelf very readily and chearfully conſented.</p>
               <p>Thus Fortune, after having diverted herſelf, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Cuſtom, with two or three Frolicks, at laſt diſpoſed all Matters to the Advantage of our He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roine; who, indeed, ſucceeded admirably well in her Deceit, conſidering it was the firſt ſhe ever had prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed. And, to ſay the Truth, I have often conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the honeſt Part of Mankind would be much too hard for the knaviſh, if they could bring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to incur the Guilt, or thought it worth their while to take the Trouble.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Honour</hi> acted her Part to the utmoſt Perfection. She no ſooner ſaw herſelf ſecure from all Danger of <hi>Bridewell,</hi> a Word which had raiſed moſt horrible Ideas in her Mind, than ſhe reſumed thoſe Airs which her Terrours before had a little abated; and laid down her Place, with as much Affectation of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and indeed of Contempt, as was ever practiſed at the Reſignation of Places of a much greater Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. If the Reader pleaſes, therefore, we chuſe rather to ſay ſhe reſigned—which hath, indeed, been always held a ſynonymous Expreſſion with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing turned out, or turned away.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Weſtern</hi> ordered her to be very expeditious in packing: For his Siſter declared ſhe would not ſleep another Night under the ſame Roof with ſo impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0618300102:51"/>
a Slut. To work therefore ſhe went, and that ſo earneſtly, that every Thing was ready early in the Evening; when having received her Wages, away packed Bag and Baggage, to the great Satisfaction of every one, but of none more than of <hi>Sophia;</hi> who, having appointed her Maid to meet her at a certain Place not far from the Houſe, exactly at the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ghoſtly Hour of Twelve, began to prepare for her own Departure.</p>
               <p>But firſt ſhe was obliged to give two painful Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diences, the one to her Aunt, and the other to her Father. In theſe Mrs. <hi>Weſtern</hi> herſelf began to talk to her in a more peremptory Stile than before; but her Father treated her in ſo violent and outragious a Manner, that he frightened her into an affected Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with his Will, which ſo highly pleaſed the good Squire, that he changed his Frowns into Smiles, and his Menaces into promiſes; he vowed his whole Soul was wrapt in hers, that her Conſent (for ſo he conſtrued the Words, <hi>You know, Sir, I muſt not, nor can refuſe to obey any abſolute Command of yours,)</hi> had made him the happieſt of Mankind. He then gave her a large Bank-Bill to diſpoſe of in any Trinkets ſhe pleaſed, and kiſſed and embraced her in the fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Manner, while Tears of Joy trickled from thoſe Eyes, which a few Moments before had darted Fire and Rage againſt the dear Object of all his Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Inſtances of this Behaviour in Parents are ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, that the Reader, I doubt not, will be very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle aſtoniſhed at the whole Conduct of Mr. <hi>Weſtern.</hi> If he ſhould, I own I am not able to account for it; ſince that he loved his Daughter moſt tenderly, is, I think, beyond Diſpute. So indeed have many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who have rendered their Children moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly miſerable by the ſame Conduct; which, tho' it is almoſt univerſal in Parents, hath always appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me to be the moſt unaccountable of all the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0618300102:52"/>
which ever entered into the Brain <hi>of that ſtrange perfidious Creature Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The latter Part of Mr. <hi>Weſtern</hi>'s Behaviour had ſo ſtrong an Effect on the tender Heart of <hi>Sophia,</hi> that it ſuggeſted a Thought to her, which not all the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litic Sophiſtry of her Aunt, nor all the Menaces of her Father had ever once brought into her Head. She reverenced her Father ſo piouſly, and loved him ſo paſſionately, that ſhe had ſcarce ever felt more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Senſations, than what aroſe from the Share ſhe frequently had of contributing to his Amuſement; and ſometimes, perhaps, to higher Gratifications; for he never could contain the Delight of hearing her commended, which he had the Satisfaction of hearing almoſt every Day of her Life. The Idea, therefore, of the immenſe Happineſs ſhe ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey to her Father by her Conſent to this Match, made a ſtrong Impreſſion on her Mind. Again, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Piety of ſuch an Act of Obedience, worked very forcibly, as ſhe had a very deep Senſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Laſtly, when ſhe reflected how much ſhe her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was to ſuffer, being indeed to become little leſs than a Sacrifice, or a Martyr, to filial Love and Duty, ſhe felt an agreeable Tickling in a certain little Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which tho' it bears no immediate Affinity either to Religion or Virtue, is often ſo kind as to lend great Aſſiſtance in executing the Purpoſes of both.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sophia</hi> was charmed with the Contemplation of ſo heroic an Action, and began to compliment herſelf with much permature Flattery, when <hi>Cupid,</hi> who lay hid in her Muff, ſuddenly crept out, and, like <hi>Punchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nello</hi> in a Puppet-ſhew, kicked all out before him. In Truth (for we ſcorn to deceive our Reader, or to vindicate the Character of our Heroine, by aſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Actions to ſupernatural Impulſe) the Thoughts of her beloved <hi>Jones,</hi> and ſome Hopes (however diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant) in which he was very particularly concerned,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0618300102:53"/>
immediately deſtroyed all which filial Love, Piety and Pride had, with their joint Endeavours, been la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to bring about.</p>
               <p>But before we proceed any farther with <hi>Sophia,</hi> we muſt now look back to Mr. <hi>Jones.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. X. <hi>Containing ſeveral Matters natural enough perhaps, but</hi> Low.</head>
               <p>THE Reader will be pleaſed to remember, that we left Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> in the Beginning of this Book, on his Road to <hi>Briſtol;</hi> being determined to ſeek his Fortune at Sea, or rather, indeed, to fly away from his Fortune on Shore.</p>
               <p>It happened, (a Thing not very unuſual) that the Guide who undertook to conduct him on his Way, was unluckily unacquainted with the Road; ſo that having miſſed his right Track, and being aſhamed to aſk Information, he rambled about backwards and forwards, till Night came on, and it began to grow dark. <hi>Jones</hi> ſuſpecting what had happened, acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Guide with his Apprehenſions; but he inſiſted on it, that they were in the right Road, and add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it would be very ſtrange if he ſhould not know the Road to <hi>Briſtol;</hi> tho', in Reality, it would have been much ſtranger if he had known it, having never paſt through it in his Life before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> had not ſuch implicit Faith in his Guide; but that on their arrival at a Village, he enquired of the firſt Fellow he ſaw, whether they were in the Road to <hi>Briſtol.</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Whence did you come?'</q> cries the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. <q rend="inline">'no Matter,' ſays <hi>Jones,</hi> a little haſtily, 'I want to know if this be the Road to <hi>Briſtol.'</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'The Road to <hi>Briſtol!'</hi> cries the Fellow, ſcratching his Head, 'Why, Maſter, I believe you will hardly get to <hi>Briſtol</hi> this Way to Night.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">Prithee, Friend,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0618300102:54"/>
then,' anſwered <hi>Jones,</hi> 'do tell us which is the Way.</q>—<q rend="inline">'Why, Meaſter,' cries the Fellow, 'you muſt have come out of your Road the Lord knows whither: For thick Way goeth to <hi>Glouceſter.'</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Well, and which Way goes to <hi>Briſtol',</hi>
                  </q> ſaid <hi>Jones,</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">Why, you be going away from <hi>Briſtol,</hi>'</q> anſwered the Fellow.—<q rend="inline">'Then,' ſaid <hi>Jones,</hi> 'we muſt go back again.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Ay, you muſt,' </q> ſaid the Fellow. <q rend="inline">'Well, and when we come back to the Top of the Hill, which Way muſt we take?'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Why you muſt keep the ſtrait Road.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">But I remember there are two Roads, one to the Right and the other to the Left.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">Why you muſt keep the right-hand Road, and then gu ſtrait vorwards; only remember to turn firſt to your Right, and then to your Left again, and then to your Right; and that brings you to the Squire's, and then you muſt keep ſtrait vorwards, and turn to the Left.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Another Fellow now came up, and aſked which Way the Gentlemen were going?—of which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing informed by <hi>Jones,</hi> he firſt ſcratched his Head, and then leaning upon a Pole he had in his Hand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to tell him, <q rend="inline">That he muſt keep the Right-hand Road for about a Mile or a Mile and half or zuch a Matter, and then he muſt turn ſhort to the Left, which would bring him round by Meaſter <hi>Jin Bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>'s.' But which is Mr. <hi>John Bearnes</hi>'s,' ſays <hi>Jones.</hi> 'O Lord,' cries the Fellow, 'why don't you know Meaſter <hi>Jin Bearnes?</hi> Whence then did you come?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe two Fellows had almoſt conquered the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of <hi>Jones,</hi> when a plain well-looking Man (who was indeed a Quaker) accoſted him thus: <q rend="inline">Friend, I perceive thou haſt loſt thy Way, and if thou wilt take my Advice thou wilt not attempt to find it to Night. It is almoſt dark, and the Road is difficult to hit; beſides there have been ſeveral Robberies committed lately between this and <hi>Briſtol.</hi> Here is
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0618300102:55"/>
a very creditable good Houſe juſt by, where thou may'ſt find good Entertainment for thyſelf and thy Cattle till Morning.'</q> 
                  <hi>Jones,</hi> after a little Perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, agreed to ſtay in this Place till the Morning, and was conducted by his Friend to the Public-Houſe.</p>
               <p>The Landlord, who was a very civil Fellow, told <hi>Jones,</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">'he hoped he would excuſe the Badneſs of his Accommodation: For that his wife was gone from home, and had locked up almoſt every Thing, and carried the Keys along with her.'</q> Indeed, the Fact was, that a favourite Daughter of hers was juſt mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and gone, that Morning, home with her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; and that ſhe and her Mother together had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſtript the poor Man of all his Goods, as well as Money: For tho' he had ſeveral Children, this Daughter only, who was the Mother's Favourite, was the Object of her Conſideration; and to the Humour, of this one Child, ſhe would, with Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, have ſacrificed all the reſt, and her Huſband in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Bargain.</p>
               <p>Tho' <hi>Jones</hi> was very unfit for any Kind of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and would have preferred being alone, yet he could not reſiſt the Importunities of the honeſt Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker; who was the more deſirous of ſitting with him, from having remarked the Melancholy which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared both in his Countenance and Behaviour; and which the poor Quaker thought his Converſation might in ſome Meaſure relieve.</p>
               <p>After they had paſſed ſome Time together, in ſuch a Manner that my honeſt Friend might have thought himſelf at one of his Silent-Meetings, the Quaker began to be moved by ſome Spirit or other, probably that of Curioſity; and ſaid, <q rend="inline">'Friend, I perceive ſome ſad Diſaſter hath befallen thee; but, pray be of Comfort. Perhaps thou haſt loſt a Friend. If ſo, thou muſt conſider we are all mortal. And why ſhould'ſt thou grieve, when thou knoweſt thy
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0618300102:56"/>
Grief will do thy Friend no Good. We are all born to Affliction. I myſelf have my Sorrows as well as thee, and moſt probably greater Sorrows. Tho' I have a clear Eſtate of a <hi>100l.</hi> a Year, which is as much as I want, and I have a Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, I thank the Lord, void of Offence. My Conſtitution is ſound and ſtrong, and there is no Man can demand a Debt of me nor accuſe me of an Injury—yet, Friend, I ſhould be concerned to think thee as miſerable as myſelf.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here the Quaker ended with a deep Sigh; and <hi>Jones</hi> preſently anſwered, <q rend="inline">'I am very ſorry, Sir, for your Unhappineſs, whatever is the Occaſion of it.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">Ah! Friend,' replyed the Quaker, 'one only Daughter is the Occaſion. One who was my greateſt Delight upon Earth, and who within this Week is run away from me, and is married againſt my Conſent. I had provided her a proper Match, a ſober Man, and one of Subſtance; but ſhe, forſooth, would chuſe for herſelf, and away ſhe is gone with a young Fellow not worth a Groat. If ſhe had been dead, as I ſuppoſe thy Friend is, I ſhould have been happy!'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'That is very ſtrange, Sir,'</q> ſaid <hi>Jones.</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Why would it not be better for her to be dead, than to be a Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar?' replied the Quaker: 'For, as I told you, the Fellow is not worth a Groat; and ſurely ſhe cannot expect that I ſhall ever give her a Shilling. No, as ſhe hath married for Love, let her live on Love if ſhe can; let her carry her Love to Market, and ſee whether any one will change it into Silver, or even into Halfpence.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'You know your own Concerns beſt, Sir,'</q> ſaid <hi>Jones.</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">'It muſt have been,' continued the Quaker, 'a long premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated Scheme to cheat me: For they have known one another from their infancy; and I always preached to her againſt Love—and told her a thouſand Times over, it was all Folly and Wickedneſs. Nay, the cunning Slut pretended to hearken to me, and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0618300102:57"/>
to deſpiſe all Wantonneſs of the Fleſh; and yet at laſt, to break out of a Window up two pair of Stairs: For I began, indeed, a little to ſuſpect her, and had locked her up carefully, intending the very next Morning to have married her up to my Liking. But ſhe diſappointed me within a few Hours, and eſcaped away to the Lover of her own chuſing, who loſt no Time: For they were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried and bedded, and all within an Hour.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">But it ſhall be the worſt Hour's Work for them both that ever they did, for they may ſtarve, or beg, or ſteal together for me. I will never give either of them a Farthing.</q> Here <hi>Jones</hi> ſtarting up, cry'd, <q rend="inline">I really muſt be excuſed, I wiſh you would leave me.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Come, come, Friend, ſaid the Quaker, don't give Way to Concern. You ſee there are other People miſerable, beſides your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'I ſee there are Madmen and Fools and Villains in the World,' cries <hi>Jones</hi>—'But let me give you a Piece of Advice; ſend for your Daughter and Son-in-law home, and don't be yourſelf the only Cauſe of Miſery to one you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to love.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">Send for her and her Huſband home!' cries the Quaker loudly, 'I would ſooner ſend for the two greateſt Enemies I have in the World!'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Well go home yourſelf, or where you pleaſe,' ſaid <hi>Jones:</hi> 'For I will ſit no longer in ſuch Company.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'—Nay, Friend,' anſwered the Quaker, I ſcorn to impoſe my Company on any one.'</q> He then offered to pull Money from his Pocket, but <hi>Jones</hi> puſhed him with ſome Violence out of the Room.</p>
               <p>The Subject of the Quaker's Diſcourſe had ſo deeply affected <hi>Jones,</hi> that he ſtared very wildly all the Time he was ſpeaking. This the Quaker had obſerved, and this, added to the reſt of his Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, inſpired honeſt <hi>Broadbrim</hi> with a Conceit, that his Companion was in reality out of his Senſes. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of reſenting the Affront, therefore, the Quaker
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0618300102:58"/>
was moved with Compaſſion for his unhappy Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances; and having communicated his Opinion to the Landlord, he deſired him to take great Care of his Gueſt, and to treat him with the higheſt Civility.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'Indeed,' ſays the Landlord, 'I ſhall uſe no ſuch Civility towards him: For it ſeems, for all his laced Waiſtcoat there, he is no more a Gentleman than myſelf; but a poor Pariſh Baſtard bred up at a great Squire's about 30 Miles off, and now turned out of Doors, (not for any good to be ſure.) I ſhall get him out of my Houſe as ſoon as poſſible. If I do loſe my Reckoning, the firſt Loſs is always the beſt. It is not above a Year ago that I loſt a Silver-ſpoon.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'What doſt thou talk of a Pariſh Baſtard, <hi>Robin?'</hi> anſwered the Quaker. 'Thou muſt certainly be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in thy Man.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'Not at all,' replied <hi>Robin,</hi> 'the Guide, who knows him very well, told it me.'</q> For, indeed, the Guide had no ſooner taken his Place at the Kitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en-Fire, than he acquainted the whole Company with all he knew, or had ever heard concerning <hi>Jones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Quaker was no ſooner aſſured by this Fellow of the Birth and low Fortune of <hi>Jones,</hi> than all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion for him vaniſhed; and the honeſt, plain Man went home fired with no leſs Indignation than a Duke would have felt at receiving an Affront from ſuch a Perſon.</p>
               <p>The Landlord himſelf conceived an equal Diſdain for his Gueſt; ſo that when <hi>Jones</hi> rung the Bell in order to retire to Bed, he was acquainted that he could have no Bed there. Beſides Diſdain of the mean Condition of his Gueſt, <hi>Robin</hi> entertained violent Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion of his Intentions, which were, he ſuppoſed, to watch ſome favourable Opportunity of robbing the Houſe. In reality, he might have been very well eaſed of theſe Apprehenſions by the prudent Precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Wife and Daughter, who had already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0618300102:59"/>
every thing which was not fixed to the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold; but he was by Nature ſuſpicious, and had been more particularly ſo ſince the Loſs of his Spoon. In ſhort, the Dread of being robbed, totally abſorbed the comfortable Conſideration that he had nothing to loſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> being aſſured that he could have no Bed, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry contentedly betook himſelf to a great Chair made with Ruſhes, when Sleep, which had lately ſhunned his Company in much better Apartments, generouſly paid him a Viſit in his humble Cell.</p>
               <p>As for the Landlord, he was prevented by his Fears from retiring to Reſt. He returned therefore to the Kitchen Fire, whence he would ſurvey the only Door which opened into the Parlour, or rather, Hole, where <hi>Jones</hi> was ſeated; and as for the Window to that Room, it was impoſſible for any Creature larger than a Cat to have made his Eſcape through it.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XI. <hi>The Adventure of a Company of Soldiers.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE Landlord having taken his Seat directly oppoſite to the Door of the Parlour, determined to keep Guard there the whole Night. The Guide and another Fellow remained long on Duty with him, tho' they neither knew his Suſpicions, nor had any of their own. The true Cauſe of their watching did indeed, at length, put an End to it; for this was no other than the Strength and Goodneſs of the Beer, of which having tippled a very large Quantity, they grew at firſt very noiſy and vociferous, and afterwards fell both aſleep.</p>
               <p>But it was not in the Power of Liquor to compoſe the Fears of <hi>Robin.</hi> He continued ſtill waking in his Chair, with his Eyes fixed ſtedfaſtly on the Door which led into the Apartment of Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> till a violent Thundering at his outward Gate called him
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0618300102:60"/>
from his Seat, and obliged him to open it; which he had no ſooner done, than his Kitchen was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately full of Gentlemen in red Coats, who all ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him in as tumultuous a Manner, as if they intended to take his little Caſtle by Storm.</p>
               <p>The Landlord was now forced from his Poſt to furniſh his numerous Gueſts with Beer, which they called for with great Eagerneſs; and upon his ſecond or third Return from the Cellar, he ſaw Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> ſtanding before the Fire in the midſt of the Soldiers; for it may eaſily be believed, that the Arrival of ſo much good Company ſhould put an End to any Sleep, unleſs that from which we are only to be awakened by the laſt Trumpet.</p>
               <p>The Company having now pretty well ſatisfied their Thirſt, nothing remained but to pay the Reckoning, a Circumſtance often productive of much Miſchief and Diſcontent among the inferior Rank of Gentry; who are apt to find great Difficulty in aſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Sum, with exact Regard to diſtributive Juſtice, which directs, that every Man ſhall pay according to the Quantity which he drinks. This Difficulty oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred upon the preſent Occaſion; and it was the greater, as ſome Gentlemen had, in their extreme Hurry, marched off, after their firſt Draught, and had entirely forgot to contribute any thing towards the the ſaid Reckoning.</p>
               <p>A violent Diſpute now aroſe, in which every Word may be ſaid to have been depoſed upon Oath; for the Oaths were at leaſt equal to all the other Words ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. In this Controverſy, the whole Company ſpoke together, and every Man ſeemed wholly bent to exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate the Sum which fell to his Share; ſo that the moſt probable Concluſion which could be foreſeen, was, that a large Portion of the Reckoning would fall to the Landlord's Share to pay, or (what is much the ſame thing) would remain unpaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:0618300102:61"/>
All this while Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> was engaged in Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Serjeant; for that Officer was entirely unconcerned in the preſent Diſpute, being privileged, by immemorial Cuſtom, from all Contribution.</p>
               <p>The Diſpute now grew ſo very warm, that it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to draw towards a military Deciſion, when <hi>Jones</hi> ſtepping forward, ſilenced all their Clamours at once, by declaring that he would pay the whole Reckoning, which indeed amounted to no more than three Shillings and four-pence.</p>
               <p>This Declaration procured <hi>Jones</hi> the Thanks and Applauſe of the whole Company. The Terms ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, noble, and worthy Gentleman, reſounded through the Room; nay, my Landlord himſelf began to have a better Opinion of him, and almoſt to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe the Account which the Guide had given.</p>
               <p>The Serjeant had informed Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> that they were marching againſt the Rebels, and expected to be commanded by the glorious Duke of <hi>Cumberland.</hi> By which the Reader may perceive (a Circumſtance which we have not thought neceſſary to communicate before) that this was the very Time when the late Rebellion was at the higheſt; and indeed the Banditti were now marched into <hi>England,</hi> intending, as it was thought, to fight the King's Forces, and to attempt puſhing forward to the Metropolis.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> had ſome Heroic Ingredients in his Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and was a hearty Well-wiſher to the glorious Cauſe of Liberty, and of the Proteſtant Religion. It is no wonder, therefore, that in Circumſtances which would have warranted a much more romantic and wild Undertaking, it ſhould occur to him to ſerve as a Volunteer in this Expedition.</p>
               <p>Our commanding Officer had ſaid all in his Power to encourage and promote this good Diſpoſition, from the firſt Moment he had been acquainted with it. He now proclaimed the noble Reſolution aloud, which was received with great Pleaſure by the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0618300102:62"/>
who all cried out, <q rend="inline">'God bleſs King <hi>George,</hi> and your Honour;' and then added, with many Oaths, 'We will ſtand by you both to the laſt Drops of our Blood.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Gentleman, who had been all Night tippling at the Alehouſe, was prevailed on by ſome Arguments which a Corporal had put into his Hand, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the ſame Expedition. And now the Portman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau belonging to Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> being put up in the Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage-cart, the Forces were about to move forwards; when the Guide, ſtepping up to <hi>Jones,</hi> ſaid, <q rend="inline">'Sir, I hope you will conſider that the Horſes have been kept out all Night, and we have travelled a great ways out of our Way.'</q> 
                  <hi>Jones</hi> was ſurprized at the Impudence of this Demand, and acquainted the Soldiers with the Merits of his Cauſe, who were all unanimous in condemning the Guide for his Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to put upon a Gentleman. Some ſaid, he ought to be tied Neck and Heels; others, that he deſerved to run the Gauntlope; and the Serjeant ſhook his Cane at him, and wiſhed he had him under his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, ſwearing heartily he would make an Example of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> contented himſelf, however, with a negative Puniſhment, and walked off with his new Comrades, leaving the Guide to the poor Revenge of curſing and reviling him, in which latter the Landlord joined, ſaying, <q rend="inline">'Ay, ay, he is a pure one, I warrant you. A pretty Gentleman, indeed, to go for a Soldier. He ſhall wear a laced Waiſtcoat truly. It is an old Proverb and a true one, all is not Gold that gliſters. I am glad my Houſe is well rid of him.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>All that Day the Serjeant and the young Soldier marched together; and the former, who was an arch Fellow, told the latter many entertaining Stories of his Campaigns, tho' in Reality he had never made any; for he was but lately come into the Service, and had, by his own Dexterity, ſo well ingratiated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0618300102:63"/>
with his Officers, that he had promoted himſelf to a Halberd, chiefly indeed by his Merit in recruiting, in which he was moſt excellently well ſkilled.</p>
               <p>Much Mirth and Feſtivity paſſed among the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers during their March. In which the many Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences that had paſſed at their laſt Quarters were remembered, and every one, with great Freedom, made what Jokes he pleaſed on his Officers, ſome of which were of the coarſer Kind, and very near bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering on Scandal. This brought to our Heroe's Mind the Cuſtom which he had read of among the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> of indulging, on certain Feſtivals and ſolemn Occaſions, the Liberty to Slaves, of uſing an uncontrouled Freedom of Speech towards their Maſters.</p>
               <p>Our little Army, which conſiſted of two Companies of Foot, were now arrived at the Place where they were to halt that Evening. The Serjeant then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted his Lieutenant, who was the commanding Officer, that they had picked up two Fellows in that Day's March; one of which, he ſaid, was as fine a Man as ever he ſaw (meaning the Tippler) for that he was near ſix Feet, well-proportioned, and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly limbed; and the other, (meaning <hi>Jones,)</hi> would do well enough for their rear Rank.</p>
               <p>The new Soldiers were now produced before the Officer, who having examined the ſix Foot Man, he being firſt produced, came next to ſurvey <hi>Jones;</hi> at the firſt Sight of whom, the Lieutenant could not help ſhewing ſome Surprize; for, beſides that he was very well dreſſed, and was naturally genteel, he had a remarkable Air of Dignity in his Look, which is rarely ſeen among the Vulgar, and is indeed not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably annexed to the Features of their Superiors.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'Sir,' ſaid the Lieutenant, 'my Serjeant inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, that you are deſirous of enliſting in the Company I have at preſent under my command;

if ſo, Sir, we ſhall very gladly receive a Gentleman who promiſes to do much Honour to the Company, by bearing Arms in it.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> anſwered: <q rend="inline">'That he had not mentioned any thing of enliſting himſelf; that he was moſt zealouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attached to the glorious Cauſe for which they were going to fight, and was very deſirous of ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as a Volunteer;'</q> concluding with ſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments to the Lieutenant, and expreſſing the great Satisfaction he ſhould have in being under his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
               <p>The Lieutenant returned his Civility, commended his Reſolution, ſhook him by the Hand, and invited him to dine with himſelf and the reſt of the Officers.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XII. <hi>The Adventure of a Company of Officers.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE Lieutenant, whom we mentioned in the preceding Chapter, and who commanded this Party, was now near ſixty Years of Age. He had entered very young into the Army, and had ſerved in the Capacity of an Enſign at the Battle of <hi>Tannieres;</hi> here he had received two Wounds, and had ſo well diſtinguiſhed himſelf, that he was by the Duke of <hi>Marlborough</hi> advanced to be a Lieutenant, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after that Battle.</p>
               <p>In this Commiſſion he had continued ever ſince, <hi>viz.</hi> near forty Years; during which Time he had ſeen vaſt Numbers preferred over his Head, and had now the Mortification to be commanded by Boys, whoſe Fathers were at Nurſe when he had firſt entered into the Service.</p>
               <p>Nor was this ill Succeſs in his Profeſſion ſolely owing to his having no Friends among the Men in Power. He had the Misfortune to incur the Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his Colonel, who for many Years continued in the Command of this Regiment. Nor did he owe
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0618300102:65"/>
the implacable Ill-will which this Man bore him to any Neglect or Deficiency as an Officer, nor indeed to any Fault in himſelf; but ſolely to the Indiſcretion of his Wife, who was a very beautiful Woman, and who, tho' ſhe was remarkably fond of her Huſband, would not purchaſe his Preferment at the Expence of certain Favours which the Colonel required of her.</p>
               <p>The poor Lieutenant was more peculiarly unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in this, that while he felt the Effects of the Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Colonel, he neither knew, nor ſuſpected, that he really bore him any; for he could not ſuſpect an Ill-will for which he was not conſcious of giving any Cauſe; and his Wife, fearing what her Huſband's nice Regard to his Honour might have occaſioned, contented herſelf with preſerving her Virtue, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out enjoying the Triumphs of her Conqueſt.</p>
               <p>This unfortunate Officer (for ſo I think he may be called) had many good Qualities, beſides his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in his Profeſſion; for he was a religious, honeſt, good natured Man; and had behaved ſo well in his Command, that he was highly eſteemed and belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not only by the Soldiers of his own Company; but by the whole Regiment.</p>
               <p>The other Officers who marched with him were a <hi>French</hi> Lieutenant, who had been long enough out of <hi>France</hi> to forget his own Language, but not long enough in <hi>England</hi> to learn ours, ſo that he really ſpoke no Language at all, and could barely make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf underſtood, on the moſt ordinary Occaſions. There were likewiſe two Enſigns, both very young Fellows; one of whom had been bred under an Attorney, and the other was Son to the Wife of a Nobleman's Butler.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as Dinner was ended, <hi>Jones</hi> informed the Company of the Merriment which had paſſed among the Soldiers upon their March; <q rend="inline">'and yet,' ſays he, 'notwithſtanding all their Vociferation, I dare ſwear they will behave more like <hi>Grecians</hi> than <hi>Trojans</hi>

                  </q> He then proceeded to deſcribe her Perſon exactly, (for he had ſeen her with her Aunt) and concluded with ſaying, <q rend="inline">'That her Father had a great Eſtate in <hi>Somerſetſhire.'</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The Tenderneſs of Lovers can ill brook the leaſt jeſting with the Names of their Miſtreſſes. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, <hi>Jones,</hi> tho' he had enough of the Lover and of the Heroe too in his Diſpoſition, did not reſent theſe Slanders as haſtily as, perhaps, he ought to have done. To ſay the Truth, having ſeen but little of this Kind of Wit, he did not readily underſtand it, and for a long Time imagined Mr. <hi>Northerton</hi> had really miſtaken his Charmer for ſome other. But now turning to the Enſign with a ſtern Aſpect, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">'Pray, Sir, chuſe ſome other Subject for your Wit: For I promiſe you I will bear no jeſting with this Lady's Character.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Jeſting,' cries the other, 'd—n me if ever I was more in Earneſt in my Life. <hi>Tom French</hi> of our Regiment had both her and her Aunt at <hi>Bath.'</hi>

               <p>He had no ſooner ſpoken theſe Words, than the Enſign, together with a Volly of Curſes, diſcharged a Bottle full at the Head of <hi>Jones,</hi> which hitting him a little above the right Temple, brought him inſtantly to the Ground.</p>
               <p>The Conqueror perceiving the Enemy to lie mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionleſs before him, and Blood beginning to flow pretty plentifully from his Wound, began now to think of quitting the Field of Battle, where no more

Honour was to be gotten; but the Lieutenant inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, by ſtepping before the Door, and thus cut off his Retreat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Northerton</hi> was very importunate with the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant for his Liberty; urging the ill Conſequences of his Stay, aſking him, what could he have done leſs! <q rend="inline">'Zounds!' ſays he, 'I was but in Jeſt with the Fellow. I never heard any Harm of Miſs <hi>Weſtern</hi> in my Life.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Have not you?' ſaid the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. 'then you richly deſerve to be hanged, as well for making ſuch Jeſts, as for uſing ſuch a Weapon. You are my Priſoner, Sir; nor ſhall you ſtir from hence, till a proper Guard comes to ſecure you.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Such an Aſcendant had our Lieutenant over this Enſign, that all that Fervency of Courage which had levelled our poor Heroe with the Floor, would ſcarce have animated the ſaid Enſign to have drawn his ſword againſt the Lieutenant, had he then had one dangling at his Side; but all the Swords being hung up in the Room, were at the very Beginning of the Fray, ſecured by the <hi>French</hi> Officer. So that Mr. <hi>Northerton</hi> was obliged to attend the final Iſſue of this Affair.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> Gentleman and Mr. <hi>Adderley,</hi> at the Deſire of their Commanding-Officer, had raiſed up the Body of <hi>Jones;</hi> but as they could perceive but little (if any) ſign of Life in him, they again let him fall. <hi>Adderley</hi> damning him for having blooded his Waiſtcoat; and the <hi>Frenchman</hi> declaring, <q rend="inline">'Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar me no tuſh de Engliſeman de mort, me ave heard de Engliſe Ley, Law, what you call, hang up de Man dat tuſh him laſt.'</q>

               <p>When the good Lieutenant applied himſelf to the Door, he applied himſelf likewiſe to the Bell; and the Drawer immediately attending, he diſpatched him for a File of Muſqueteers and a Surgeon. Theſe Commands, together with the Drawer's Report of what he had himſelf ſeen, not only produced the Soliders, but preſently drew up the Landlord of the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0618300102:71"/>
Houſe, his Wife and Servants, and, indeed, every one elſe, who happened, at that Time, to be in the Inn.</p>
               <p>To deſcribe every Particular, and to relate the whole Converſation of the enſuing Scene, is not within my Power, unleſs I had forty Pens, and could, at once, write with them altogether, as the Company now ſpoke. The Reader muſt, therefore, content himſelf with the moſt remarkable Incidents, and perhaps he may very well excuſe the reſt.</p>
               <p>The firſt Thing done, was ſecuring the Body of <hi>Northerton,</hi> who being delivered into the Cuſtody of ſix Men with a Corporal at their Head, was by them conducted from a Place which he was very willing to leave, but it was unluckily to a Place whither he was very unwilling to go. To ſay the Truth, ſo whimſical are the Deſires of Ambition, the very Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment this Youth had attained the above-mentioned Honour, he would have been well contented to have retired to ſome Corner of the World, where the Fame of it ſhould never have reached his Ears.</p>
               <p>It ſurprizes us, and ſo, perhaps, it may the Reader, that the Lieutenant, a worthy and good Man, ſhould have applied his chief Care, rather to ſecure the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender, than to preſerve the Life of the wounded Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. We mention this Obſervation, not with any View of pretending to account for ſo odd a Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, but leſt ſome Critic ſhould hereafter plume himſelf on diſcovering it. We would have theſe Gentlemen know we can ſee what is odd in Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as well as themſelves, but it is our Buſineſs to relate Facts as they are; which when we have done, it is the Part of the learned and ſagacious Reader to conſult that original Book of Nature, whence every Paſſage in our Work is tranſcribed, tho' we quote not always the particular Page for its Authority.</p>
               <p>The Company which now arrived were of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Diſpoſition. They ſuſpended their Curioſity
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0618300102:72"/>
concerning the Perſon of the Enſign, till they ſhould ſee him hereafter in a more engaging Attitude. At preſent, their whole Concern and Attention were employed about the bloody Object on the Floor; which being placed upright in a Chair, ſoon began to diſcover ſome Symptoms of Life and Motion. Theſe were no ſooner perceived by the Company (for <hi>Jones</hi> was, at firſt, generally concluded to be dead) than they all fell at once to preſcribing for him: (For as none of the phyſical Order was preſent, every one there took that Office upon him.)</p>
               <p>Bleeding was the Unanimous Voice of the whole Room; but unluckily there was no Operator at hand: Every one then cry'd, 'Call the Barber'; but none ſtirred a Step. Several Cordials were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe preſcribed in the ſame ineffective Manner; till the Landlord ordered up a Tankard of his ſtrong Beer, with a Toaſt, which he ſaid was the beſt Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Perſon principally aſſiſtant on this Occaſion, indeed the only one who did any Service, or ſeemed likely to do any, was the Landlady. She cut off ſome of her Hair, and applied it to the Wound to ſtop the Blood. She fell to chafing the Youth's Temples with her Hand; and having expreſt great Contempt for her Huſband's Preſcription of Beer, ſhe diſpatched one of her Maids to her own Cloſet for a Bottle of Brandy, of which, as ſoon as it was brought, ſhe prevailed upon <hi>Jones,</hi> who was juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his Senſes, to drink a very large and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Draught.</p>
               <p>Soon afterwards arrived the Surgeon, who having viewed the Wound, having ſhaken his Head, and blamed every Thing which was done, ordered his Patient inſtantly to Bed; in which Place, we think proper to leave him, ſome Time, to his Repoſe, and ſhall here, therefore, put an End to this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

               <p>WHEN the wounded Man was carried to his Bed, and the Houſe began again to clear up from the Hurry which this Accident had occaſioned; the Landlady thus addreſſed the commanding Officer. <q rend="inline">'I am afraid, Sir,' ſaid ſhe, 'this young Man did not behave himſelf as well as he ſhould do to your Honours; and if he had been killed, I ſuppoſe he had had but his <hi>Deſarts;</hi> to be ſure when Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men admit inferior <hi>Parſons</hi> into their Company, they <hi>oft</hi> to keep their Diſtance; but, as my firſt Huſband uſed to ſay, few of them knew how to do it.

                  <q rend="inline">'Landlady,' anſwered the Lieutenant, 'you miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the whole Matter. The young Man behaved himſelf extremely well, and is, I believe a much better Gentleman than the Enſign, who abuſed him. If the young Fellow dies, the Man who ſtruck him will have moſt Reaſon to be ſorry for it: For the Regiment will get rid of a very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Fellow, who is a Scandal to the Army; and if he eſcapes from the Hands of Juſtice, blame me, Madam, that's all.</q>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'Ay,' cries the Lanlady, 'why look you there now: Well, my firſt Huſband was a wiſe Man; he uſed to ſay, you can't always know the Inſide by the Outſide. Nay, that might have been well enough too: For I never <hi>ſaw'd</hi> him till he was all over Blood. Who would have <hi>thoft</hi> it! mayhap, ſome young Gentleman croſt in Love. Good Lack-a-day! if he ſhould die, what a Concern it would be to his Parents! Why ſure the Devil muſt poſſeſs the wicked Wretch to do ſuch an Act. To be ſure he is a Scandal to the Army, as your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ſays: For moſt of the Gentlemen of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my that ever I ſaw, are quite different Sort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and look as if they would ſcorn to ſpill any Chriſtian Blood as much as any Men. I mean, that is, in a civil Way, as my firſt Huſband uſed to ſay. To be ſure, when they come into the Wars, there muſt be Blood-ſhed; but they are not to be blamed for that. The more of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies they kill there, the better; and I wiſh, with all my Heart, they could kill every Mother's Son' of them.</q>

               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'O fie! Madam,' ſaid the Lieutenant ſmiling, 'ALL is rather too bloody-minded a Wiſh.'</q>

               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'Not at all, Sir,' anſwered ſhe, 'I am not at all bloody-minded, only to our Enemies, and there is no Harm in that. To be ſure it is natural for us to wiſh our Enemies, dead, that the Wars may be at an End, and our Taxes be lowered: For it is a dreadful Thing to pay as we do. Why now there is above forty Shillings for Window-lights, and yet we have ſtopt up all we could; we have

               <p>She was proceeding in this Manner, when the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon entered the Room. The Lieutenant immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately aſked how his Patient did? But he reſolved him only by ſaying, <q rend="inline">'Better, I believe, than he would have been by this Time, if I had not been called; and even as it is, perhaps it would have been lucky if I could have been called ſooner.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">I hope, Sir,' ſaid the Lieutenant, 'the Skull is not fractured.' Hum,' cries the Surgeon, 'Fractures are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the moſt dangerous Symptoms. Contuſions and Lacerations are often attended with worſe Phaenomena, and with more fatal Conſequences than Fractures. People who know nothing of the Matter conclude, if the Skull is not fractured, all is well; whereas, I had rather ſee a Man's Skull broke all to Pieces, than ſome Contuſions I have met with. I hope,' ſays the Lieutenant, 'there are no ſuch Symptoms here:'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Symptoms,' an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Surgeon, 'are not always regular nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.

Some febrile Symptoms intervening at the ſame Time, (for the Pulſe was exuberant and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated much Phlebotomy) I apprehended an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Mortification. To prevent which I preſently made a large Orifice in the Vein of the left Arm, whence I drew twenty Ounces of Blood; which I expected to have found extremely ſizy and glutinous, or indeed coagulated, as it is in pleuritic Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints; but, to my Surprize, it appeared roſy and florid, and its Conſiſtency differed little from the Blood of thoſe in perfect Health. I then applied a Fomentation to the Part, which highly anſwered the Intention, and after three or four Times dreſſing, the Wound began to diſcharge a thick Pus or Matter, by which Means the Coheſion—but perhaps I do not make myſelf perfectly well underſtood.'</q>

                  <q rend="inline">'I wiſh, Sir,' ſaid the Lieutenant, 'you would be ſo kind only to inform me, whether the Wound this young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman hath had the Misfortune to receive is likely to prove mortal?'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Sir,' anſwered the Surgeon, 'to ſay whether a Wound will prove mortal or not at firſt Dreſſing, would be very weak and fooliſh Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption: We are all mortal, and Symptoms often occur in a Cure which the greateſt of our Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could never foreſee.'</q>—<q rend="inline">'But do you think him in Danger?'</q> ſays the other. <q rend="inline">'In Danger! ay, ſurely,' cries the Doctor, 'who is there among us, who in the moſt perfect Health can be ſaid not to be in Danger? Can a Man, therefore, with ſo bad a Wound as this be ſaid to be out of Danger? All I can ſay, at preſent, is, that it is well I was called as I was, and perhaps it would have been

better if I had been called ſooner. I will ſee him again early in the Morning, and in the mean Time let him be kept extremely quiet, and drink liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Water-Gruel.'</q>

                  <q rend="inline">'May'nt I make him ſome Jellies too,' ſaid the Landlady?'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Ay, ay,' an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Doctor, 'Jellies are very good for Wounds, for they promote Coheſion.'</q> And, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, it was lucky ſhe had not named Soop or high Sauces, for the Doctor would have complied, rather than have loſt the Cuſtom of the Houſe.</p>
               <p>The Doctor was no ſooner gone, than the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady began to trumpet forth his Fame to the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, who had not, from their ſhort Acquaintance conceived quite ſo favourable an Opinion of his phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Abilities, as the good Woman, and all the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood entertained; (and indeed very rightly) for tho' I am afraid the Doctor was a little of a Cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb, he might be nevertheleſs very much of a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon.</p>
               <p>The Lieutenant having collected from the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Diſcourſe of the Surgeon, that Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> was in great Danger, gave Orders for keeping Mr. <hi>Norther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> under a very ſtrict Guard, intending in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to attend him to a Juſtice of Peace, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the conducting the Troops to <hi>Gloceſter</hi> to the <hi>French</hi> Lieutenant, who, tho' he could neither read, write, nor ſpeak any language, was, however, a good Officer.</p>
               <p>In the Evening our Commander ſent a Meſſage to Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> that if a Viſit would not be trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome he would wait on him. This Civility was very kindly and thankfully received by <hi>Jones,</hi> and the Lieutenant accordingly went up to his Room;

where he found the wounded Man much better than he expected; nay, <hi>Jones</hi> aſſured his Friend, that if he had not received expreſs Orders to the contrary from the Surgeon, he ſhould have got up long ago: For he appeared to himſelf to be as well as ever, and felt no other Inconvenience from his Wound but an extreme Soreneſs on that Side of his Head.</p>

               <p>However, as <hi>Jones</hi> perſiſted in his Deſire of ſeeing him, a vociferous Drawer at length found Means to diſturb his Slumbers, and to acquaint him with the Meſſage. Of which the Serjeant was no ſooner made ſenſible, than he aroſe from his Bed, and having his Clothes already on, immediately attended. <hi>Jones</hi> did not think fit to acquaint the Serjeant with his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, tho' he might have done it with great Safety; for the Halberdier was himſelf a Man of Honour, and had killed his Man. He would therefore have faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully kept this Secret, or indeed any other which no Reward was publiſhed for diſcovering. But as <hi>Jones</hi> knew not theſe Virtues in ſo ſhort an Acquaintance, his Caution was perhaps prudent and commendable enough.</p>
               <p>He began therefore by acquainting the Serjeant, that now he was entered into the Army, he was aſhamed of being without what was perhaps the moſt neceſſary Implement of a Soldier, namely, a Sword; adding, that he ſhould be infinitely obliged to him if he could procure one. <q rend="inline">'For which,' ſays he, 'I will give you any reaſonable Price. Nor do I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon its being Silver-hilted, only a good Blade, and ſuch as may become a Soldier's Thigh.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Serjeant, who well knew what had happened, and had heard that <hi>Jones</hi> was in a very dangerous Condition, immediately concluded, from ſuch a Meſſage, at ſuch a Time of Night, and from a Man in ſuch a Situation, that he was light-headed. Now as he had his Wit (to uſe that Word in its common Signification) always ready, he bethought himſelf of making his Advantage of this Humour in the ſick Man. <q rend="inline">'Sir,' ſays he, 'I believe I can fit you. I
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0618300102:82"/>
have a moſt excellent Piece of Stuff by me. It is not indeed Silver-hilted, which, as you ſay, doth not become a Soldier; but the Handle is decent enough, and the Blade one of the beſt in <hi>Europe.—</hi>It is a Blade that—a Blade that—In ſhort, I will fetch it you this Inſtant, and you ſhall ſee it and handle it.—I am glad to ſee your Honour ſo well with all my Heart.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Being inſtantly returned with the Sword, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered it to <hi>Jones,</hi> who took it and drew it; and then told the Serjeant it would do very well, and bid him name his Price.</p>
               <p>The Serjeant now began to harangue in Praiſe of his Goods. He ſaid (nay he ſwore very heartily) <q rend="inline">'that the Blade was taken from a <hi>French</hi> Officer of very high Rank, at the Battle of <hi>Dettingen.</hi> I took it myſelf,' ſays he, 'from his Side after I had knocked him o' the Head. The Hilt was a golden one. That I ſold to one of our fine Gentlemen; for there are ſome of them, an't pleaſe your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, who value the Hilt of a Sword more than the Blade.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here the other ſtopped him, and begged him to name a Price. The Serjeant, who thought <hi>Jones</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely out of his Senſes, and very near his End, was afraid, leſt he ſhould injure his Family by aſking too little—However, after a Moment's Heſitation, he contented himſelf with naming twenty Guineas, and ſwore he would not ſell it for leſs to his own Brother.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">Twenty Guineas!' ſays <hi>Jones,</hi> in the utmoſt Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, 'ſure you think I am mad, or that I never ſaw a Sword in my Life. Twenty Guineas indeed! I did not imagine you would endeavour to impoſe upon me.—Here, take the Sword—No, now I think on't, I will keep it myſelf, and ſhew it your Officer in the Morning, acquainting him, at the ſame Time, what a Price you aſked me for it.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:0618300102:83"/>
The Serjeant, as we have ſaid, had always his Wit <hi>(in ſenſu praedicto)</hi> about him, and now plainly ſaw that <hi>Jones</hi> was not in the Condition he had apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to be; he now, therefore, counterfeited as great Surprize as the other had ſhewn, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">'I am certain, Sir, I have not aſked you ſo much out of the way. Beſides, you are to conſider, it is the only Sword I have, and I muſt run the Riſque of my Officer's Diſpleaſure, by going without one myſelf. And truly, putting all this together, I don't think twenty Shillings was ſo much out of the Way.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'Twenty Shillings!' cries <hi>Jones,</hi> 'why you juſt now aſked me twenty Guineas.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'How! cries the Serjeant—'Sure your Honour muſt have miſtaken me; or elſe I miſtook myſelf—and indeed I am but half awake—Twenty Guineas indeed! no wonder your Honour flew into ſuch a Paſſion. I ſay twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Guineas too—No, no, I meant twenty Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, I aſſure you. And when your Honour comes to conſider every thing, I hope you will not think that ſo extravagant a Price. It is indeed true, you may buy a Weapon which looks as well for' leſs Money. But—</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here <hi>Jones</hi> interrupted him, ſaying, <q rend="inline">'I will be ſo far from making any Words with you, that I will give you a Shilling more than your Demand.'</q> He then gave him a Guinea, bid him return to his Bed, and wiſhed him a good March; adding, he hoped to overtake them before the Diviſion reached <hi>Worceſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Serjeant very civilly took his Leave, fully ſatisfied with his Merchandize, and not a little pleaſed with his dextrous Recovery from that falſe Step into which his Opinion of the Sick Man's Light-headed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs had betrayed him.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the Serjeant was departed, <hi>Jones</hi> roſe from his Bed, and dreſſed himſelf entirely, putting on even his Coat, which, as its colour was white,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0618300102:84"/>
ſhewed very viſibly the Streams of Blood which had flowed down it; and now, having graſped his new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purchaſed Sword in his Hand, he was going to iſſue forth, when the Thought of what he was about to undertake laid ſuddenly hold of him, and he began to reflect that in a few Minutes he might poſſibly deprive a human Being of Life, or might loſe his own. <q rend="inline">'Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well,' ſaid he, 'and in what Cauſe do I venture my Life? Why, in that of my Honour. And who is this human Being? A Raſcal who hath injured and inſulted me without Provocation. But is not Revenge forbidden by Heaven?—Yes, but it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined by the World. Well, but ſhall I obey the World in Oppoſition to the expreſs Commands of Heaven?

               </p>
               <p>The Clock had now ſtruck Twelve, and every one in the Houſe were in their Beds, except the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel who ſtood to guard <hi>Northerton,</hi> when <hi>Jones</hi> ſoftly opening his Door, iſſued forth in Purſuit of his Enemy, of whoſe Place of Confinement he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a perfect Deſcription from the Drawer. It is not eaſy to conceive a much more tremendous Figure than he now exhibited. He had on, as we have ſaid, a light-coloured Coat, covered with Streams of Blood. His Face, which miſſed that very Blood, as well as twenty Ounces more drawn from him by the Surgeon, was pallid. Round his Head was a Quantity of Bandage, not unlike a Turban. In the right Hand he carried a Sword, and in the left a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. So that the bloody <hi>Banquo</hi> was not worthy to be compared to him. In Fact, I believe a more dreadful Apparition was never raiſed in a Church-yard, nor in the Imagination of any good People met in a Winter Evening over a Chriſtmas Fire in <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetſhire.</hi>

When the Centinel firſt ſaw our Heroe approach, his Hair began gently to lift up his Grenadier's Cap; and in the ſame Inſtant his Knees fell to Blows with each other. Preſently his whole Body was ſeized with worſe than an Ague Fit. He then fired his Piece, and fell flat on his Face.</p>
               <p>Whether Fear or Courage was the Occaſion of his Firing, or whether he took Aim at the Object of his Terror, I cannot ſay. If he did, however, he had the good Fortune to miſs his Man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> ſeeing the Fellow fall, gueſſed the Cauſe of his Fright, at which he could not forbear ſmiling, not in the leaſt reflecting on the Danger from which he had juſt eſcaped. He then paſſed by the Fellow, who ſtill continued in the Poſture in which he fell, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the Room where <hi>Northerton,</hi> as he had heard, was confined. Here, in a ſolitary Situation he found—an empty Quart Pot ſtanding on the Table, on which ſome Beer being ſplit, looked as if the Room had lately been inhabited; but at preſent it was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely vacant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> then apprehended it might lead to ſome other Apartment; but, upon ſearching all round it, he could perceive no other Door than that at which he entered, and where the Centinel had been poſted. He then proceeded to call <hi>Northerton</hi> ſeveral Times by his Name; but no one anſwered; nor did this ſerve to any other Purpoſe than to confirm the Centinel in his Terrors, who was now convinced that the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunteer was dead of his Wounds, and that his Ghoſt was come in Search of the Murtherer: He now lay in all the Agonies of Horror, and I wiſh, with all my Heart, ſome of thoſe Actors, who are hereafter to repreſent a Man frighted out of his Wits, had ſeen him, that they might be taught to copy Nature inſtead of performing ſeveral antic Tricks and Geſtures, for the Entertainment and Applauſe of the Galleries.</p>

                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:0618300102:86"/>
Perceiving the Bird was flown, at leaſt deſpairing to find him, and rightly apprehending that the Report of the Firelock would alarm the whole Houſe, our Heroe now blew out his Candle, and gently ſtole back again to his Chamber, and to his Bed: Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would not have been able to have gotten un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcovered, had any other Perſon been on the ſame Stair-caſe, ſave only one Gentleman who was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to his Bed by the Gout; for before he could reach the Door to his Chamber, the Hall where the Centinel had been poſted was half full of People. Some in their Shirts, and others not half dreſt, all very earneſtly enquiring of each other, what was the Matter?</p>
               <p>The Soldier was now found lying in the ſame Place and Poſture in which we juſt before left him. Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral immediately applied themſelves to raiſe him, and ſome concluded him dead: But they preſently ſaw their Miſtake; for he not only ſtruggled with thoſe who laid their Hands on him, but fell a roaring like a Bull. In reality, he imagined ſo many Spirits or Devils were handling him; for his Imagination be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poſſeſſed with the Horror of an Apparition, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted every Object he ſaw or felt, into nothing but Ghoſts and Spectres.</p>
               <p>At length he was overpowered by Numbers, and got upon his Legs; when Candles being brought, and ſeeing two or three of his Comrades preſent, he came a little to himſelf; but when they aſked him what was the Matter? he anſwered, <q rend="inline">'I am a dead Man, that's all, I'm a dead Man. I can't recover it. I have ſeen him.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">What haſt thou ſeen, <hi>Jack,'</hi>
                  </q> ſays one of the Soldiers. <q rend="inline">'Why I have ſeen the young Volunteer that was killed Yeſterday.'</q> He then imprecated the moſt heavy Curſes on himſelf, if he had not ſeen the Volunteer, all over Blood, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting Fire out of his Mouth and Noſtrils, paſs by him into the Chamber where Enſign <hi>Northerton</hi> was,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0618300102:87"/>
and then ſeizing the Enſign by the Throat, fly away with him in a Clap of Thunder.</p>
               <p>This Relation met with a gracious Reception from the Audience. All the Women preſent believed it firmly, and prayed Heaven to defend them from Murther. Amongſt the Men too, many had Faith in the Story; but others turned it into Deriſion and Ridicule; and a Serjeant who was preſent, anſwered very coolly: <q rend="inline">'Young Man, you will hear more of this for going to ſleep, and dreaming on your Poſt.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Soldier replied, <q rend="inline">'You may puniſh me if you pleaſe; but I was as broad awake as I am now; and the Devil carry me away, as he hath the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, if I did not ſee the dead Man as I tell you, with Eyes as big and as fiery as two large Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beaux.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Commander of the Forces, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the Houſe, were now both arrived: For the former being awake at the Time, and hearing the Centinel fire his Piece, thought it his Duty to riſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, though he had no great Apprehenſions of any Miſchief; whereas the Apprehenſions of the latter were much greater, leſt her Spoons and Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards ſhould be upon the March, without having received any ſuch Orders from her.</p>
               <p>Our poor Centinel, to whom the Sight of this Officer was not much more welcome than the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition, as he thought it, which he had ſeen before, again related the dreadful Story, and with many Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Blood and Fire: But he had the Misfortune to gain no Credit with either of the laſt mentioned Perſons; for the Officer, tho' a very religious Man, was free from all Terrors of this Kind; beſides, having ſo lately left <hi>Jones</hi> in the Condition we have ſeen, he had no Suſpicion of his being dead. As for the Landlady, tho' not over religious, ſhe had no kind of Averſion to the Doctrine of Spirits; but
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0618300102:88"/>
there was a Circumſtance in the Tale which ſhe well knew to be falſe, as we ſhall inform the Reader preſently.</p>
               <p>But whether <hi>Northerton</hi> was carried away in Thunder or Fire, or in whatever other Manner he was gone; it was now certain, that his Body was no longer in Cuſtody. Upon this Occaſion, the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant formed a Concluſion not very different from what the Serjeant is juſt mentioned to have made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and immediately ordered the Centinel to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Priſoner. So that, by a ſtrange Reverſe of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune (tho' not very uncommon in a military Life) the Guard became the Guarded.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XV. <hi>The Concluſion of the foregoing Adventure.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>BESIDES the Suſpicion of Sleep, the Lieutenant harboured another, and worſe Doubt againſt the poor Centinel, and this was that of Treachery: For as he believed not one Syllable of the Apparition, ſo he imagined the whole to be an Invention, formed only to impoſe upon him, and that the Fellow had, in Reality, been bribed by <hi>Northerton</hi> to let him eſcape. And this he imagined the rather, as the Fright ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him, the more unnatural in one who had the Character of as brave and bold a Man as any in the Regiment, having been in ſeveral Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, having received ſeveral Wounds, and in a Word, having behaved himſelf always like a good and valiant Soldier.</p>
               <p>That the Reader, therefore, may not conceive the leaſt ill Opinion of ſuch a Perſon, we ſhall not delay a Moment in reſcuing his Character from the Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Guilt.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Northerton</hi> then, as we have before obſerved, was fully ſatisfied with the Glory which he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0618300102:89"/>
from this Action. He had, perhaps, ſeen, or heard, or gueſſed, that Envy is apt to attend Fame. Not that I would here inſinuate, that he was hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſhly inclined to believe in, or to worſhip, the Goddeſs <hi>Nemeſis;</hi> for, in fact, I am convinced he never heard of her Name. He was, beſides, of an Active Diſpoſition, and had a great Antipathy to thoſe cloſe Winter Quarters in the Caſtle of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> for which a Juſtice of Peace might poſſibly give him a Billet. Nor was he moreover free from ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy Meditations on a certain wooden Edifice, which I forbear to name, in Conformity to the Opinion of Mankind, who, I think, rather ought to honour than to be aſhamed of this Building, as it is, or at leaſt might be made, of more Benefit to Society than almoſt any other public Erection. In a Word, to hint at no more Reaſons for his Conduct, Mr. <hi>Northerton</hi> was deſirous of departing that Evening, and nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained for him but to contrive the <hi>Quomodo,</hi> which appeared to be a Matter of ſome Difficulty.</p>
               <p>Now this young Gentleman, tho' ſomewhat crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Morals, was perfectly ſtrait in his Perſon, which was extremely ſtrong and well made. His Face too was accounted handſome by the Generality of Women, for it was broad and ruddy, with to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerably good Teeth. Such Charms did not fail mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Impreſſion on my Landlady, who had no little Reliſh for this kind of Beauty. She had, indeed, a real Compaſſion for the young Man; and hearing from the Surgeon that Affairs were like to go ill with the Volunteer, ſhe ſuſpected they might hereafter wear no benign Aſpect with the Enſign. Having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, therefore, leave to make him a Viſit, and finding him in a very melancholy Mood, which ſhe conſiderably heightened, by telling him there were ſcarce any Hopes of the Volunteer's Life, ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to throw forth ſome Hints, which the other
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0618300102:90"/>
readily and eagerly taking up, they ſoon came to a right Underſtanding; and it was at length agreed, that the Enſign ſhould at a certain Signal aſcend the Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, which communicating very ſoon with that of the Kitchen, he might there again let himſelf down; for which ſhe would give him an Opportunity, by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Coaſt clear.</p>
               <p>But leſt our Readers, of a different Complexion, ſhould take this Occaſion of too haſtily condemning all Compaſſion as a Folly, and pernicious to Society, we think proper to mention another Particular, which might poſſibly have ſome little Share in this Action. The Enſign happened to be at this Time poſſeſſed of the Sum of fifty Pounds, which did indeed belong to the whole Company: For the Captain having quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled with his Lieutenant, had entruſted the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Company to the Enſign. This Money, however, he thought proper to depoſite in my Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady's Hand, poſſibly by way of Bail or Security that he would hereafter appear and anſwer to the Charge againſt him; but whatever were the Conditions, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that ſhe had the Money, and the Enſign his Liberty.</p>
               <p>The Reader may, perhaps, expect, from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate Temper of this good Woman, that when ſhe ſaw the poor Centinel taken Priſoner for a Fact of which ſhe knew him innocent, that ſhe ſhould imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately have interpoſed in his Behalf; but whether it was that ſhe had already exhauſted all her Compaſſion in the above-mentioned Inſtance, or that the Features of this Fellow, tho' not very different from thoſe of the Enſign, could not raiſe it, I will not determine; but ſo far from being an Advocate for the preſent Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, ſhe urged his Guilt to his Officer, declaring with uplifted Eyes and Hands, that ſhe would not have had any Concern in the Eſcape of a Murderer for all the World.</p>

Every thing was now once more quiet; and moſt of the Company returned again to their Beds; but the Landlady, either from the natural Activity of her Diſpoſition, or from her Fear for her Plate, having no Propenſity to ſleep, prevailed with the Officers, as they were to march within little more than an Hour, to ſpend that Time with her over a Bowl of Punch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> had lain awake all this while, and had heard great Part of the Hurry and Buſtle that had paſſed, of which he had now ſome Curioſity to know the Particulars. He therefore applied to his Bell, which he rung at leaſt twenty Times without any Effect; for my Landlady was in ſuch high Mirth with her Company, that no Clapper could be heard there but her own, and the Drawer and Chambermaid, who were ſitting together in the Kitchen (for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther durſt he ſit up, nor ſhe lie in Bed alone) the more they heard the Bell ring, the more they were frightened, and, as it were, nailed down in their Places.</p>
               <p>At laſt, at a lucky Interval of Chat, the Sound reached the Ears of our good Landlady, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſent forth her Summons, which both her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants inſtantly obeyed. <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>'Joo,'</hi> ſays the Miſtreſs, 'don't you hear the Gentleman's Bell ring? why don't you go up?'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'It is not my Buſineſs,' an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Drawer, 'to wait upon the Chambers. It is <hi>Betty</hi> Chambermaid's!'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'If you come to that,' anſwered the Maid, 'it is not my Buſineſs to wait upon Gentlemen. I have done it, indeed, ſome times; but the Devil fetch me if ever I do again, ſince you make your Preambles about it.'</q> The Bell ſtill ringing violently, their Miſtreſs fell into a Paſſion, and ſwore, if the Drawer did not go up im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, ſhe would turn him away that very Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <q rend="inline">'If you do, Madam,' ſays he, 'I can't help
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0618300102:92"/>
it. I won't do another Servant's Buſineſs.'</q> She then applied herſelf to the Maid, and endeavoured to prevail by gentle Means; but all in vain, <hi>Betty</hi> was as inflexible as <hi>Joo.</hi> Both inſiſted it was not their Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and they would not do it.</p>
               <p>The Lieutenant then fell a laughing, and ſaid, 'Come, I will put an End to this Contention;' and then turning to the Servants, commended them for their Reſolution, in neither giving up the Point; but added, he was ſure, if one would conſent to go, the other would. To which Propoſal they both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in an Inſtant, and accordingly went up very lovingly and cloſe together. When they were gone, the Lieutenant appeaſed the Wrath of the Landlady, by ſatisfying her why they were both ſo unwilling to go alone.</p>
               <p>They returned ſoon after, and acquainted their Miſtreſs, that the ſick Gentleman was ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead, that he ſpoke as heartily as if he was well; and that he gave his Service to the Captain, and ſhould be very glad of the Favour of ſeeing him before he marched.</p>
               <p>The good Lieutenant immediately complied with his Deſires, and ſitting down by his Bed-ſide acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with the Scene which had happened below, concluding with his Intentions to make an Example of the Centinel.</p>
               <p>Upon this, <hi>Jones</hi> related to him the whole Truth, and earneſtly begged him not to puniſh the poor Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, <q rend="inline">'who, I am confident,' ſays he, 'is as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent of the Enſign's Eſcape, as he is of forging any Lie, or of endeavouring to impoſe on you.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Lieutenant heſitated a few Moments, and then anſwered: <q rend="inline">'Why, as you have cleared the Fellow of one Part of the Charge, ſo it will be impoſſible to prove the other; becauſe he was not the only Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel. But I have a good mind to puniſh the Raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0618300102:93"/>
for being a Coward. Yet who knows what Effect the Terror of ſuch an Apprehenſion may have; and to ſay the Truth, he hath always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved well againſt an Enemy. Come, it is a good Thing to ſee any Sign of Religion in theſe Fellows; ſo I promiſe you he ſhall be ſet at liberty when we march. But hark, the General beats. My dear Boy, give me another Buſs. Don't diſcompoſe nor hurry yourſelf; but remember the Chriſtian Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Patience, and I warrant you will ſoon be able to do yourſelf Juſtice, and take to an honourable Revenge on the Fellow who hath injured you.'</q> The Lieutenant then departed, and <hi>Jones</hi> endeavoured to compoſe himſelf to Reſt.</p>

               </head>
               <p>AS we are now entering upon a Book, in which the Courſe of our Hiſtory will oblige us to relate ſome Matters of a more ſtrange and ſurprizing Kind than any which have hitherto occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, it may not be amiſs in the prolegomenous, or introductory Chapter, to ſay ſomething of that Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Writing which is called the Marvellous. To this we ſhall, as well for the Sake of ourſelves, as of others, endeavour to ſet ſome certain Bounds; and indeed nothing can be more neceſſary, as Criticks <note n="*" place="bottom">By this Word here, and in moſt other Parts of our Work, we mean every Reader in the World.</note>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:0618300102:95"/>
of different Complexions are here apt to run into very different Extremes; for while ſome are, with M. <hi>Dacier,</hi> ready to allow, that the ſame Thing which is impoſſible may be yet probable <note n="†" place="bottom">It is happy for M. <hi>Dacier</hi> that he was not an <hi>Iriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>
                  </note>, others have ſo little Hiſtoric or Poetic Faith, that they believe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be either poſſible or probable, the like to which hath not occured to their own Obſervation.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, I think, it may very reaſonably be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of every Writer, that he keeps within the Bounds of Poſſibility; and ſtill remembers that what it is not poſſible for Man to perform, it is ſcarce poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for Man to believe he did perform. This Convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, perhaps, gave Birth to many Stories of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Heathen Deities (for moſt of them are of poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Original). The Poet, being deſirous to indulge a wanton and extravagant Imagination, took Refuge in that Power, of the Extent of which his Readers were no Judges, or rather which they imagined to be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and conſequently they could not be ſhocked at any Prodigies related of it. This hath been ſtrongly urged in Defence of <hi>Homer</hi>'s Miracles; and it is, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, a Defence; not, as Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> would have it, becauſe <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> told a ſet of fooliſh Lies to the <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acians,</hi> who were a very dull Nation; but becauſe the Poet himſelf wrote to Heathens, to whom poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Fables were Articles of Faith. For my own Part, I muſt confeſs, ſo compaſſionate is my Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, I wiſh <hi>Polypheme</hi> had confined himſelf to his Milk Diet, and preſerved his Eye; nor could <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> be much more concerned than myſelf, when his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions were turned into Swine by <hi>Circe,</hi> who ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I think, afterwards, too much Regard for Man's Fleſh to be ſuppoſed capable of converting it into Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con. I wiſh, likewiſe, with all my Heart, that <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> could have known the Rule preſcribed by <hi>Horace,</hi>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:0618300102:96"/>
to introduce ſupernatural Agents as ſeldom as poſſible. We ſhould not then have ſeen his Gods coming on trivial Errands, and often behaving themſelves ſo as not only to forfeit all Title to Reſpect, but to become the Objects of Scorn and Deriſion. A Conduct which muſt have ſhocked the Credulity of a pious and ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Heathen; and which could never have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, unleſs by agreeing with a Suppoſition to which I have been ſometimes almoſt inclined, that this moſt glorious Poet, as he certainly was, had an Intent to bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſque the ſuperſtious Faith of his own Age and Country.</p>
               <p>But I have reſted too long on a Doctrine which can be of no Uſe to a Chriſtian Writer: For as he cannot introduce into his Works any of that heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Hoſt which make a Part of his Creed; ſo is it horrid Puerility to ſearch the Heathen Theology for any of thoſe Deities who have been long ſince de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throned from their Immortality. Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> obſerves, that nothing is more cold than the Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Muſe by a Modern; he might have added that nothing can be more abſurd. A modern may with much more Elegance invoke a Ballad, as ſome have thought <hi>Homer</hi> did, or a Mug of Ale with the Author of <hi>Hudibras;</hi> which latter may perhaps have inſpired much more Poetry as well as Proſe, than all the Liquors of <hi>Hippocrene</hi> or <hi>Helicon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The only ſupernatural Agents which can in any Manner be allowed to us Moderns are Ghoſts; but of theſe I would adviſe an Author to be extremely ſparing. Theſe are indeed like Arſenic, and other dangerous Drugs in Phyſic, to be uſed with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Caution; nor would I adviſe the Introduction of them at all in thoſe Works, or by thoſe Authors to which, or to whom a Horſe-Laugh in the Reader, would be any great Prejudice or Mortification.</p>
               <p>As for Elves and Fairies, and other ſuch Mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mery, I purpoſely omit the Mention of them, as I
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0618300102:97"/>
ſhould be very unwilling to confine within any Bounds thoſe ſurprizing Imaginations, for whoſe Capacity the Limits of human Nature are too narrow; whoſe Works are to be conſidered as a new Creation; and who have conſequently juſt Right to do what they will with their own.</p>
               <p>Man therefore is the higheſt Subject (unleſs on very extraordinary Occaſions indeed) which preſents itſelf to the Pen of our Hiſtorian, or of our Poet; and in relating his Actions, great Care is to be taken, that we do not exceed the Capacity of the Agent we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe.</p>
               <p>Nor is Poſſibility alone ſufficient to juſtify us, we muſt keep likewiſe within the Rules of Probability. It is, I think, the Opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> or if not, it is the Opinion of ſome wiſe Man, whoſe Authority will be as weighty, when it is as old; 'that it is no Excuſe for a Poet who relates what is incredible, that the thing related is really Matter of Fact.' This may perhaps be allowed true with regard to Poetry, but it may be thought impracticable to extend it to the Hiſtorian: For he is obliged to record Matters as he finds them; though they may be of ſo extraordinary a Nature, as will require no ſmall Degree of hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Faith to ſwallow them. Such was the ſucceſsleſs Armament of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> deſcribed by <hi>Herodotus,</hi> or the ſucceſsful Expedition of <hi>Alexander</hi> related by <hi>Arrian.</hi> Such of later Years was the Victory of <hi>Agincourt</hi> obtained by <hi>Harry</hi> the Fifth, or that of <hi>Narva,</hi> won by <hi>Charles</hi> the Twelfth of <hi>Sweden.</hi> All which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, the more we reflect on them, appear ſtill the more aſtoniſhing.</p>
               <p>Such Facts, however, as they occur in the Thread of the Story; nay, indeed, as they conſtitute the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Parts of it, the Hiſtorian is not only juſtifiable in recording as they really happened; but indeed would be unpardonable, ſhould he omit or alter them.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0618300102:98"/>
But there are other Facts not of ſuch Conſequence nor ſo neceſſary, which tho' ever ſo well atteſted, may nevertheleſs be ſacrificed to Oblivion in Complaiſance to the Scepticiſm of a Reader. Such is that memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Story of the Ghoſt of <hi>George Villers,</hi> which might with more Propriety have been made a Preſent of to Dr. <hi>Drelincourt,</hi> to have kept the Ghoſt of Mrs. <hi>Veale</hi> Company, at the Head of his Diſcourſe upon Death, than have been introduced into ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn a Work as the Hiſtory of the Rebellion.</p>
               <p>To ſay the Truth, if the Hiſtorian will confine himſelf to what really happened, and utterly reject any Circumſtance, which, tho' never ſo well atteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he muſt be well aſſured is falſe, he will ſometimes fall into the Marvellous, but never into the Incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. He will often raiſe the Wonder and Surprize of his Reader, but never that incredulous Hatred men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by <hi>Horace.</hi> It is by falling into Fiction there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that we generally offend againſt this Rule, of deſerting Probability, which the Hiſtorian ſeldom if ever quits, till he forſakes his Character, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mences a Writer of Romance. In this, however, thoſe Hiſtorians who relate public Tranſactions, have the Advantage of us who confine ourſelves to Scenes of private Life. The Credit of the former is by common Notoriety ſupported for a long Time; and public Records, with the concurrent Teſtimony of many Authors bear Evidence to their Truth in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Ages. Thus a <hi>Trajan</hi> and an <hi>Antoninus,</hi> a <hi>Nero</hi> and a <hi>Caligula,</hi> have all met with the Belief of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity; and no one doubts but that Men ſo very good, and ſo very bad, were once the Maſters of Mankind.</p>
               <p>But we who deal in private Characters, who ſearch into the moſt retired Receſſes, and draw forth Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Virtue and Vice, from Holes and Corners of the World, are in a more dangerous Situation. As'
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0618300102:99"/>
we have no publick Notoriety, no concurrent Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, no Records to ſupport and corroborate what we deliver, it becomes us not only to keep within the Limits of Poſſibility, but of Probability too; and this more eſpecially in painting what is greatly good and amiable. Knavery and Folly, though never ſo exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant, will more eaſily meet with Aſſent: for Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature adds great Support and Strength to Faith.</p>
               <p>Thus we may, perhaps, with little Danger relate the Hiſtory of a <hi>Fiſher;</hi> who having long owed his Bread to the Generoſity of Mr. <hi>Derby,</hi> and having that very Morning received a conſiderable Bounty from his Hands, in order to poſſeſs himſelf of what remained in his Friend's Scrutore, concealed himſelf in a public Office of the Temple, through which there was a Paſſage into Mr. <hi>Derby</hi>'s Chambers. Here he overheard Mr. <hi>Derby</hi> for many Hours ſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing himſelf at an Entertainment which he that Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gave his Friends, and to which <hi>Fiſher</hi> had been invited. During all this Time, no tender, no grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Reflections aroſe to reſtrain his Purpoſe; but when the poor Gentleman had let his Company out through the Office, <hi>Fiſher</hi> came ſuddenly from his lurking Place, and walking ſoftly behind his Friend into his Chamber, diſcharged a Piſtol Ball into his Head. This may be believed, when the Bones of <hi>Fiſher</hi> are as rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as his Heart. Nay, perhaps, it will be credited that the Villain went two Days afterwards with ſome young Ladies to the Play of <hi>Hamlet;</hi> and with an unaltered Countenance heard one of the Ladies, who little ſuſpected how near ſhe was to the Perſon, cry out, Good God! if the Man that murdered Mr. <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi> was now preſent! Manifeſting in this a more ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and callous Conſcience than even <hi>Nero</hi> himſelf; of whom we are told by <hi>Suetonius,</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">'that the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of his Guilt after the Death of his Mother became immediately intolerable, and ſo continued;
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0618300102:100"/>
nor could all the Congratulations of the Soldiers, of the Senate, and the People, allay the Horrors of his Conſcience.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>But now, on the other hand, ſhould I tell my Reader, that I had known a Man whoſe penetrating Genius had enabled him to raiſe a large Fortune in a Way where no Beginning was chaulked out to him: That he had done this with the moſt perfect Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his Integrity, and not only without the leaſt Injuſtice or Injury to any one individual Perſon, but with the higheſt Advantage to Trade, and a vaſt Increaſe of the public Revenue: That he had expend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one Part of the Income of this Fortune in diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering a Taſte ſuperior to moſt, by Works where the higheſt Dignity was united with the pureſt Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, and another Part in diſplaying a Degree of Goodneſs ſuperior to all Men, by acts of Charity to Objects whoſe only Recommendations were their Merits, or their Wants: That he was moſt induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in ſearching after Merit in Diſtreſs, moſt eager to relieve it, and then as careful (perhaps too careful) to conceal what he had done: That his Houſe, his Furniture, his Gardens, his Table, his private Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality, and his public Beneficence all denoted the Mind from which they flowed, and were all intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſically rich and noble, without Tinſel, or external Oſtentation: That he filled every Relation in Life with the moſt adequate Virtue: That he was moſt piouſly religious to his Creator, moſt zealouſly loyal to his Sovereign; a moſt tender Huſband to his Wife, a kind Relation, a munificent Patron, a warm and firm Friend, a knowing and a chearful Companion, indulgent to his Servants, hoſpitable to his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, charitable to the Poor, and benevolent to all Mankind. Should I add to theſe the Epithits of wiſe, brave, elegant, and indeed every other amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Epithet in our Language, I might ſurely ſay,</p>
               <q>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:0618300102:101"/>
—Quis credet? nemo Hercule! nemo;</l>
                  <l>Vel duo, vel nemo.</l>
               </q>
               <p>And yet I know a Man who is all I have here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. But a ſingle Inſtance (and I really know not ſuch another) is not ſufficient to juſtify us, while we are writing to thouſands who never heard of the Perſon, nor of any thing like him. Such <hi>Rarae A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves</hi> ſhould be remitted to the Epitaph-Writer, or to ſome Poet, who may condeſcend to hitch him in a Diſtich, or to ſlide him into a Rhime with an Air of Careleſneſs and Neglect, without giving any Offence to the Reader.</p>
               <p>In the laſt Place, the Actions ſhould be ſuch as may not only be within the Compaſs of human Agency, and which human Agents may probably be ſuppoſed to do; but they ſhould be likely for the very Actors and Characters themſelves to have performed: For what may be only wonderful and ſurprizing in one Man, may become improbable, or indeed impoſſible, when related of another.</p>
               <p>This laſt Requiſite is what the dramatic Critics call Conſervation of Character, and it requires a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Degree of Judgment, and a moſt exact Knowledge of human Nature.</p>
               <p>It is admirably remarked by a moſt excellent Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, That Zeal can no more hurry a Man to act in direct Oppoſition to itſelf, than a rapid Stream can carry a Boat againſt its own Current. I will venture to ſay, that for a Man to act in direct Contradiction to the Dictates of Nature, is, if not impoſſible, as improbable and as miraculous as any Thing which can well be conceived. Should the beſt Parts of the Story of <hi>M. Antoninus</hi> be aſcribed to <hi>Nero,</hi> or ſhould the worſt Incidents of <hi>Nero</hi>'s Life be imputed to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toninus,</hi> what would be more ſhocking to Belief than either Inſtance; whereas both theſe being related of their proper Agent, conſtitute the Truly Marvellous.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:0618300102:102"/>
Our modern Authors of Comedy have fallen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt univerſally into the Error here hinted at: Their Heroes generally are notorious Rogues, and their Heroines abandoned Jades, during the firſt four Acts; but in the fifth, the former become very worthy Gentlemen, and the latter, Women of Virtue and Diſcretion: Nor is the Writer often ſo kind as to give himſelf the leaſt Trouble, to reconcile or account for this monſtrous Change and Incongruity. There is, indeed, no other Reaſon to be aſſigned for it, than becauſe the Play is drawing to a Concluſion; as if it was no leſs natural in a Rogue to repent in the laſt Act of a Play, than in the laſt of his Life; which we perceive to be generally the Caſe at <hi>Tyburn,</hi> a Place which might, indeed, cloſe the Scene of ſome Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies with much Propriety, as the Heroes in theſe are moſt commonly eminent for thoſe very Talents which not only bring Men to the Gallows, but enable them to make an heroic Figure when they are there.</p>
               <p>Within theſe few Reſtrictions, I think, every Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may be permitted to deal as much in the Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as he pleaſes; nay, the more he can ſurpriſe the Reader, if he thus keeps within the Rules of Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, the more he will engage his Attention, and the more he will charm him. As a Genius of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Rank obſerves in his 5th Chapter of the <hi>Bathos,</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">'The great Art of all Poetry is to mix Truth with Fiction; in order to join the Credible with the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>For though every good Author will confine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf within the Bounds of Probability, it is by no means neceſſary that his Characters, or his Incidents, ſhould be trite, common, or vulgar; ſuch as happen in every Street, or in every Houſe, or which may be met with in the home Articles of a News-paper. Nor muſt he be inhibited from ſhewing many Perſons and Things, which may poſſibly have never fallen within the Knowledge of great Part of his Readers.</p>

If the Writer ſtrictly obſerves the Rules abovemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, he hath diſcharged his Part; and is then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to ſome Faith from his Reader, who is indeed guilty of critical Infidelity if he diſbelieves him. For want of a Portion of ſuch Faith, I remember the Character of a young Lady of Quality, which was condemned on the Stage for being unnatural, by the unanimous Voice of a very large Aſſembly of Clerks and Apprentices; tho' it had had the previous Suffrages of many Ladies of the firſt Rank; one of whom ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eminent for her Underſtanding, declared it was the Picture of half the young People of her Acquaintance.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. <hi>In which the Landlady pays a Viſit to Mr.</hi> Jones.</head>
               <p>WHEN <hi>Jones</hi> had taken Leave of his Friend the Lieutenant, he endeavoured to cloſe his Eyes, but all in vain; his Spirits were too lively and wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be lulled to Sleep. So having amuſed, or rather tormented himſelf with the Thoughts of his <hi>Sophia,</hi> till it was open Day-light, he called for ſome Tea; upon which Occaſion my Landlady herſelf vouchſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to pay him a Viſit.</p>
               <p>This was indeed the firſt Time ſhe had ſeen him, or at leaſt had taken any Notice of him; but as the Lieutenant had aſſured her that he was certainly ſome young Gentleman of Faſhion, ſhe now determined to ſhew him all the Reſpect in her Power: for, to ſpeak truly, this was one of thoſe Houſes where Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to uſe the Language of Advertiſements, meet with civil Treatment for their Money.</p>
               <p>She had no ſooner begun to make his Tea, than ſhe likewiſe began to diſcourſe, <q rend="inline">'La! Sir,' ſaid ſhe, I think it is great Pity that ſuch a pretty young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman ſhould undervalue himſelf ſo, as to go about with theſe Soldier Fellows. They call themſelves Gentlemen, I warrant you; but, as my firſt Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0618300102:104"/>
uſed to ſay, they ſhould remember it is we that pay them. And to be ſure it is very hard upon us to be obliged to pay them, and to keep 'em too, as we Publicans are. I had twenty of 'um laſt Night, beſides Officers; nay, for matter o' that, I had rather have the Soldiers than the Officers: For nothing is ever good enough for thoſe Sparks; and I am ſure if you was to ſee the Bills; La, Sir, it is nothing. I have had leſs Trouble, I warrant you, with a good Squire's Family, where we take forty or fifty Shillings of a Night beſides Horſes'. And yet I warrants me, there is <hi>narrow</hi> a one of all thoſe Officer Fellows, but looks upon himſelf to be as good as <hi>arrow</hi> a Squire of <hi>500l.</hi> a Year. To be ſure it doth me Good to hear their Men run about after 'um, crying your Honour, and your Honour. Marry come up with ſuch Honour, and an Ordinary at a Shilling a Head. Then there's ſuch Swearing among 'um, to be ſure, it frightens me out o' my Wits, I think nothing can proſper with ſuch wicked People. And here one of 'um has uſed you in ſo barbarous a Manner. I thought indeed how well the reſt would ſecure him; they all hang together; for if you had been in Danger of Death, which I am glad to ſee you are not, it would have been all as one to ſuch wicked People. They would have let the Murderer go. Laud have Mercy upon 'um, I would not have ſuch a Sin to anſwer for, for the whole World. But tho' you are likely, with the Bleſſing to recover, there is Laa for him yet, and if you will employ Layer <hi>Small,</hi> I dareſt be ſworn he'll make the Fellow fly the Country for him; tho' perhaps, he'll have fled the Country before; for it is here To-day and gone To-morrow with ſuch Chaps. I hope however, you will learn more Wit for the future, and return back to your Friends; I warrant they are all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable for your Loſs; and if they was but to know
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0618300102:105"/>
what had happened. La, my ſeeming! I would not for the World they ſhould. Come, come, we know very well what all the Matter is; but if one won't, another will, ſo pretty a Gentleman need never want a Lady. I am ſure if I was as you, I would ſee the fineſt ſhe that ever wore a Head hanged, before I would go for a Soldier for her.—Nay, don't bluſh ſo (for indeed he did to a violent Degree) why, you thought, Sir, I knew nothing of the Matter, I warrant you, about Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>Sophia.'</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <q rend="inline"> 'How,' ſays <hi>Jones,</hi> ſtarting up, 'do you know my <hi>Sophia?'</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <q rend="inline">Do I? ay marry,' cries the Landlady, 'many's the Time hath ſhe lain in this Houſe.'</q> 'With her Aunt, I ſuppoſe,' ſays <hi>Jones.'</hi>—<q rend="inline">'Why there it is now,' cries the Landlady. 'Ay, ay, ay, I know the old Lady very well. And a ſweet young Creature is Madam <hi>Sophia,</hi> that's the truth on't.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'A ſweet Creature!' cries <hi>Jones,'</hi> Oh Heavens!
<q>
                        <l>Angels are painted fair to look like her.</l>
                        <l>There's in her all that we believe of Heaven,</l>
                        <l>Amazing Brightneſs, Purity and Truth,</l>
                        <l>Eternal Joy, and everlaſting Love.</l>
                     </q>
'And could I ever have imagined that you had known my <hi>Sophia.'</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'I wiſh,' ſays the Landlady, 'you knew half ſo much of her. What would you have given to have ſat by her Bed-ſide? What a delicious Neck ſhe hath! Her lovely Limbs have ſtretched themſelves in that very Bed you now lie in.' 'Here! cries <hi>Jones,</hi> 'hath <hi>Sophia</hi> ever lain here?</q>—<q rend="inline">'Ay, ay, here; there; in that very Bed,' ſays the Landlady, 'where I wiſh you had her this Moment; and ſhe may wiſh ſo too, for any thing I know to the contrary: For ſhe hath mentioned your Name to me.'</q>—<q rend="inline">'Ha,' cries he, 'did ſhe ever mention her poor <hi>Jones?—</hi>You flatter me
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0618300102:106"/>
now, I can never believe ſo much.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">Why then,' anſwered ſhe, 'as I hope to be ſaved, and may the Devil fetch me, if I ſpeak a Syllable more than the Truth. I have heard her mention Mr. <hi>Jones;</hi> but in a civil and modeſt Way, I confeſs; yet I could perceive ſhe thought a great deal more than ſhe ſaid.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'O my dear Woman,' cries <hi>Jones,</hi> 'her Thoughts of me I ſhall never be worthy of. O ſhe is all Gentleneſs, Kindneſs, Goodneſs. Why was ſuch a Raſcal as I born, ever to give her ſoft Boſom a Moment's Uneaſineſs? Why am I curſed? I, who would undergo all the Plagues and Miſeries which any Daemon ever invented for Mankind, to procure her any Good; nay, Torture itſelf could not be Miſery to me, did I but know that ſhe was hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Why look you there now,' ſays the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady, I told her you was a conſtant Lover.' But pray, Madam, tell me when or where you knew any thing of me; for I never was here before, nor do I remember ever to have ſeen you.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Nor is it poſſible you ſhould,' anſwered ſhe, 'for you was a little Thing when I had you in my Lap at the Squire's.'—'How the Squire's,' ſaid <hi>Jones,</hi> what do you know the great and good Mr. <hi>Allwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> then?'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Yes, marry do I,' ſays ſhe; 'Who in this Country doth not?'</q>—<q rend="inline">'the Fame of his Goodneſs indeed,' anſwered <hi>Jones,</hi> 'muſt have extended farther than this; but Heaven only can know him, can know that Benevolence which is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied from itſelf, and ſent upon Earth as its own Pattern. Mankind are as ignorant of ſuch divine Goodneſs, as they are unworthy of it; but none ſo unworthy of it as myſelf. I who was raiſed by him to ſuch a Height; taken in, as you well muſt know, a poor baſe-born Child, adopted by him, and treated as his own Son, to dare by my Follies to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige him, to draw his Vengeance upon me. Yes,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0618300102:107"/>
I deſerve it all: For I will never be ſo ungrateful as even to think he hath done an Act of Injuſtice by me. No, I deſerve to be turned out of Doors, as I am. And now, Madam, ſays he, I believe you will not blame me for turning Soldier, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially' with ſuch a Fortune as this in my Pocket.</q> At which words he ſhook a Purſe which had but very little in it, and which ſtill appeared to the Landlady to have leſs.</p>
               <p>My good Landlady was, (according to vulgar Phraſe) ſtruck all of a Heap by this Relation. She anſwered coldly, <q rend="inline">'That to be ſure People were the beſt Judges what was moſt proper for their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.—But hark,' ſays ſhe, 'I think I hear ſome body call. Coming! coming! the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's in all our Volk, nobody hath any Ears. I muſt go down Stairs, if you want any more Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt,' the Maid will come up. Coming!'</q> At which Words, without taking any Leave, ſhe flung out of the Room: For the lower Sort of People are very te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious of Reſpect; and tho' they are contented to give this <hi>gratis</hi> to Perſons of Quality, yet they never confer it on thoſe of their own Order, without taking Care to be paid for their Pains.</p>

               </head>
               <p>BEFORE we proceed any farther, that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may not be miſtaken in imagining the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady knew more than ſhe did, nor ſurprized that ſhe knew ſo much, it may be neceſſary to inform him, that the Lieutenant had acquainted her that the Name of <hi>Sophia</hi> had been the Occaſion of the Quarrel; and as for the reſt of her Knowledge, the ſagacious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will obſerve how ſhe came by it in the preceding Scene. Great Curioſity was indeed mixed with her
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0618300102:108"/>
Virtues; and ſhe never willingly ſuffered any one to depart from her Houſe without enquiring as much as poſſible into their Names, Families and Fortunes.</p>
               <p>She was no ſooner gone, than <hi>Jones,</hi> inſtead of animadverting on her Behaviour, reflected that he was in the ſame Bed, which he was informed had held his dear <hi>Sophia.</hi> This occaſioned a thouſand fond and tender Thoughts, which we would dwell longer upon, did we not conſider that ſuch kind of Lovers will make a very inconſiderable Part of our Readers.</p>
               <p>In this Situation the Surgeon found him, when he came to dreſs his Wound. The Doctor, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving upon Examination, that his Pulſe was diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and hearing that he had not ſlept, declared that he was in great Danger: For he apprehended a Fever was coming on; which he would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by bleeding, but <hi>Jones</hi> would not ſubmit, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring he would loſe no more Blood; and <q rend="inline">'Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,' ſays he, 'if you will be ſo kind only to dreſs my Head, I have no Doubt of being well in a Day or two.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'I wiſh,' anſwered the Surgeon, 'I could aſſure your being well in a Month or two. Well, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed! No, no, People are not ſo ſoon well of ſuch Contuſions; but, Sir, I am not at this Time of Day to be inſtructed in my Operations by a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and a inſiſt on making a Revulſion before I dreſs you.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> perſiſted obſtinately in his Refuſal, and the Doctor at laſt yielded; telling him at the ſame Time, that he would not be anſwerable for the ill Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and hoped he would do him the Juſtice to acknowledge that he had given him a contrary Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; which the Patient promiſed he would.</p>
               <p>The Doctor retired into the Kitchen, where, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing himſelf to the Landlady, he complained bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly of the undutiful Behaviour of his Patient, who would not be blooded, though he was in a Fever.</p>

'It is an eating Fever then,' ſays the Landlady: 'For he hath devoured two ſwinging buttered Toaſts this Morning for Breakfaſt.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'Very likely,' ſays the Doctor, 'I have known People eat in a Fever; and it is very eaſily account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for; becauſe the Acidity occaſioned by the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brile Matter, may ſtimulate the Nerves of the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragm, and thereby occaſion a Craving, which will not be eaſily diſtinguiſhable from a natural Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite; but the Aliment will not be concreted, nor aſſimilated into Chyle, and ſo will corrode the vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Orifices, and thus will aggravate the febrific Symptoms. Indeed I think the Gentleman in a very dangerous Way, and, if he is not blooded, I am afraid will die.'</q>

                  <q rend="inline">'I imagined ſo as well as you,' ſaid the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady; 'but as my firſt Huſband uſed to ſay, every Thing is not what it looks to be.

               <p>Meeting the Landlady, he accoſted her with great Civility, and aſked <q rend="inline">'what he could have for Dinner.'</q>

                  <hi>Jones</hi> now returned in order to dreſs himſelf, while his Dinner was preparing, and was, according to his Orders, attended by the Barber.</p>
               <p>This Barber, who went by the Name of little <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin,</hi> was a Fellow of great Oddity and Humour, which had frequently led him into ſmall Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, ſuch as Slaps in the Face, Kicks in the Breech, broken Bones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For every one doth not underſtand a Jeſt; and thoſe who do, are often diſpleaſed with being themſelves the Subjects of it. This Vice was, however, incurable in him; and though he had often ſmarted for it, yet if ever he conceived a Joke, he

was certain to be delivered of it, without the leaſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Perſons, Time, or Place.</p>
               <p>He had a great many other Particularities in his Character, which I ſhall not mention, as the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der himſelf will very eaſily perceive them, on his far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Acquaintance with this extraordinary Perſon.</p>

                  <hi>Jones</hi> being impatient to be dreſt, for a Reaſon which may be eaſily imagined, thought the Shaver was very tedious in preparing his Suds, and begged him to make Haſte; to which the other anſwered, with Gravity: For he never diſcompoſed his Muſcles on any Account. <q rend="inline">

                  <q rend="inline">'Upon my word,' cries <hi>Jones,</hi> 'thou art a very odd Fellow, and I like thy Humour extremely; I ſhall be very glad if thou wilt come to me after Dinner, and drink a Glaſs with me; I long to be' better acquainted with thee.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'O dear Sir,' ſaid the Barber, 'I can do you twenty times as great a Favour, if you will accept of it.' 'What is that, my Friend,' cries <hi>Jones.</hi> 'Why, I will drink a Bottle with you, if you pleaſe; for I dearly love Good-nature, and as you have found me out to be a comical Fellow, ſo I have no Skill in Phyſiognomy, if you are not one of the beſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natured Gentlemen in the Univerſe.'</q> 
                  <hi>Jones</hi> now walked down Stairs neatly dreſt, and perhaps the famed <hi>Adonis</hi> was not a lovelier Figure; and yet he had no Charms for my Landlady: For as that good Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man did not reſemble <hi>Venus</hi> at all in her Perſon, ſo neither did ſhe in her Taſte. Happy had it been for <hi>Nanny</hi> the Chambermaid, if ſhe had ſeen with the Eyes of her Miſtreſs; for that poor Girl fell ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently in love with <hi>Jones</hi> in five Minutes, that her Paſſion afterwards coſt her many a Sigh. This <hi>Nancy</hi> was extremely pretty, and altogether as coy; for ſhe had refuſed a Drawer, and one or two young Farmers in the Neighbourhood, but the bright Eyes of our Heroe thawed all her Ice in a Moment.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Jones</hi> returned to the Kitchen, his Cloth was not yet laid; nor indeed was there any Occaſion

it ſhould, his Dinner remaining in <hi>Satu quo,</hi> as did the Fire which was to dreſs it. This Diſappointment might have put many a philoſopical Temper into a Paſſion; but it had no ſuch Effect on <hi>Jones.</hi> He only gave the Landlady a gentle Rebuke, ſaying, <q rend="inline">'Since it was ſo difficult to get it heated, he would eat the Beef cold.'</q> But now the good Woman, whether moved by Compaſſion, or by Shame, or by whatever other Motive, I cannot tell, firſt gave her Servants a round Scold for diſobeying the Orders which ſhe had never given, and then bidding the Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er lay a Napkin in the Sun, ſhe ſet about the Matter in good earneſt, and ſoon accompliſhed it.</p>
               <p>This Sun, into which <hi>Jones</hi> was now conducted, was truly named as <hi>Lucus a non lucendo;</hi> for it was an Apartment into which the Sun had ſcarce ever looked. It was indeed the worſt Room in the Houſe; and happy was it for <hi>Jones</hi> that it was ſo. However, he was now too hungry to find any Fault; but hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once ſatisfied his Appetite, he ordered the Drawer to carry a Bottle of Wine into a better Room, and expreſſed ſome Reſentment at having been ſhewn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Dungeon.</p>
               <p>The Drawer having obeyed his Commands, he was, after ſome Time, attended by the Barber; who would not indeed have ſuffered him to wait ſo long for his Company, had he not been liſtening in the Kitchen to the Landlady, who was entertaining a Circle that ſhe had gathered round her with the Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of poor <hi>Jones,</hi> Part of which ſhe had extracted from his own Lips, and the other Part was her own ingenious Compoſition; <q rend="inline">'for ſhe ſaid he was a poor Pariſh Boy, taken into the Houſe of Squire <hi>Allwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> where he was bred up as an Apprentice, and now turned out of Doors for his Miſdeeds, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly for making Love to his young Miſtreſs, and probably for robbing the Houſe; for how elſe ſhould he come by the little Money he hath.

               <p>THIS Converſation paſſed partly while <hi>Jones</hi> was at Dinner in his Dungeon, and partly while he was expecting the Barber in the Parlour. And, as ſoon as it was ended, Mr. <hi>Benjamin,</hi> as we have ſaid, attended him, and was very kindly deſired to ſit down. <hi>Jones</hi> then filling out a Glaſs of Wine, drank his Health by the Appellation of <hi>Doctiſſime Tonſorum.

Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> I am your moſt obedient Servant, I find you do not know me, which indeed is no Wonder, ſince you never ſaw me but once, and then you was very young. Pray, Sir, how doth the good Squire <hi>Allworthy?</hi> How doth <hi>Ille optimus omnium Patronus?'</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'I find,' ſaid <hi>Jones,</hi> 'you do indeed know me; but I have not the like Happineſs of recollecting you.'</q>—<q rend="inline">I do not wonder at that,' cries <hi>Benjamin;</hi> 'but I am ſurprized I did not know you ſooner, for you are not in the leaſt altered.

                  <q rend="inline">Nay, Sir,' anſwered <hi>Benjamin,</hi> 'I would not be troubleſome; and I hope you don't think me a Man of an impertinent Curioſity, for that is a Vice which nobody can lay to my Charge; but I aſk Pardon, for when a Gentleman of your Figure travels without his Servants, we may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him to be, as we ſay, in <hi>Caſu incognito,</hi> and perhaps I ought not to have mentioned your Name.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'I own,' ſays <hi>Jones,</hi> 'I did not expect to have been ſo well known in this Country as I find I am, yet, for particular Reaſons, I ſhall be obliged to you if you will not mention my Name to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Perſon, till I am gone from hence.'</q>

                  </q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Alas, Sir,' replied <hi>Benjamin, 'Non ſi male nunc &amp; olim ſic erat.</hi> I was not born nor bred a Barber, I aſſure you.

And if you had thought me as worthy of your Confidence as you have ſome other People,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0618300102:117"/>
I ſhould have ſhewn you I could have kept a Secret better. I ſhould not have degraded your Name in a public Kitchen; for indeed, Sir, ſome People have not uſed you well; for beſides making a publick Proclamation of what you told them of a Quarrel between yourſelf and Squire <hi>Allworthy,</hi> they added Lies of their own, Things which I knew to be Lies.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">You ſurprize me greatly,' cries <hi>Jones.'</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Upon my Word, Sir, anſwered <hi>Benjamin,</hi> 'I tell the Truth, and I need not tell you my Landlady was the Perſon. I am ſure it moved me to hear the Story, and I hope it is all falſe; for I have a great Reſpect for you, I do aſſure you I have, and have had, ever ſince the Good-nature you ſhewed to <hi>Black George,</hi> which was talked of all over the Country, and I received more than one Letter about it. Indeed it made you beloved by every body. You will pardon me, therefore; for it was real Concern at what I heard made me aſk any Queſtions; for I have no impertinent Curioſity about me; but I love Good-nature, and thence became <hi>Amoris abundantia ergo Te.'</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Every Profeſſion of Friendſhip eaſily gains Credit with the Miſerable, it is no wonder, therefore, if <hi>Jones,</hi> who, beſides his being miſerable, was extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly open-hearted, very readily believed all the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> and received him into his Boſom. The Scraps of <hi>Latin,</hi> ſome of which <hi>Benjamin</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied properly enough, though it did not favour of profound Literature, ſeemed yet to indicate ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſuperior to a common Barber, and ſo indeed did his whole Behaviour. <hi>Jones</hi> therefore believed the Truth of what he ſaid, as to his Original and Education, and at length, after much Entreaty, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">'Since you have heard, my Friend, ſo much of my Affairs, and ſeem ſo deſirous to know the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0618300102:118"/>
Truth, if you will have Patience to hear it, I will inform you of the whole.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Patience,' cries <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin,</hi> 'that I will, if the Chapter was never ſo long, and I am very much obliged to you for the Honour you do me.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> now began, and related the whole Hiſtory, forgetting only a Circumſtance or two, namely, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing which paſſed on that Day in which he had fought with <hi>Thwackum,</hi> and ended with his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to go to Sea, till the Rebellion in the North had made him change his Purpoſe, and had brought him to the Place where he then was.</p>
               <p>Little <hi>Benjamin,</hi> who had been all Attention, never once interrupted the Narrative; but when it was ended, he could not help obſerving, that there muſt be ſurely ſomething more invented by his Enemies, and told Mr. <hi>Allworthy</hi> againſt him, or ſo good a Man would never have diſmiſſed one he had loved ſo tenderly, in ſuch a Manner. To which <hi>Jones</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <q rend="inline">'He doubted not but ſuch villanous Arts had been made uſe of to deſtroy him.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>And ſurely it was ſcarce poſſible for any one to have avoided making the ſame Remark with the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; who had not, indeed, heard from <hi>Jones</hi> one ſingle Circumſtance upon which he was condemned; for his Actions were not now placed in thoſe injurious Lights, in which they had been miſrepreſented to <hi>Allworthy:</hi> Nor could he mention thoſe many falſe Accuſations which had been from time to time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred againſt him to <hi>Allworthy;</hi> for with none of theſe was he himſelf acquainted. He had likewiſe, as we have obſerved, omitted many material Facts in his preſent Relation. Upon the whole, indeed, every thing now appeared in ſuch favourable Colours to <hi>Jones,</hi> that Malice it ſelf would have found it no eaſy Matter to fix any Blame upon him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:0618300102:119"/>
Not that <hi>Jones</hi> deſired to conceal or to diſguiſe the Truth; nay, he would have been more unwilling to have ſuffered any Cenſure to fall on Mr. <hi>Allworthy</hi> for puniſhing him, than on his own Actions for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving it; but, in Reality, ſo it happened, and ſo it always will happen: For let a Man be never ſo honeſt, the Account of his own Conduct will, in Spite of himſelf, be ſo very favourable, that his Vices will come purified through his Lips, and, like foul Liquors well ſtrained, will leave all their Foulneſs behind. For tho' the Facts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves may appear, yet ſo different will be the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, Circumſtances, and Conſequences, when a Man tells his own Story, and when his Enemy tells it, that we ſcarce can recognize the Facts to be one and the ſame.</p>
               <p>Tho' the Barber had drank down this Story with greedy Ears, he was not yet ſatisfied. There was a Circumſtance behind, which his Curioſity, cold as it was, moſt eagerly longed for. <hi>Jones</hi> had mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Fact of his Amour, and of his being the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of <hi>Blifil,</hi> but had cautiouſly concealed the Name of the young Lady. The Barber therefore, after ſome Heſitation, and many Hums and Ha's, at laſt begged Leave to crave the Name of the Lady, who appeared to be the principal Cauſe of all this Miſchief. <hi>Jones</hi> pauſed a Moment, and then ſaid, <q rend="inline">'Since I have truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you with ſo much, and ſince I am afraid, her Name is become too public already on this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I will not conceal it from you. Her Name is <hi>Sophia Weſtern.'</hi>

                  <q rend="inline">'Ay, and ſuch a Woman,' cries <hi>Jones,</hi> 'that the World cannot match. No Eye ever ſaw any thing ſo beautiful; but that is her leaſt Excellence. Such Senſe, ſuch Goodneſs! O I could praiſe her for ever, and yet ſhould omit half her Virtues.'</q>

               <p>The Wine being now at an End, the Barber preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed very eagerly to be his Bottle; but <hi>Jones</hi> abſolutely refuſed, ſaying, <q rend="inline">'He had already drank more than he ought; and that he now choſe to retire to his Room, where he wiſhed he could procure himſelf a Book.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'A Book!' cries <hi>Benjamin,</hi> 'what Book would you have? <hi>Latin</hi> or <hi>Engliſh?</hi> I have ſome curious Books in both Languages. Such as <hi>Eraſmi Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quia, Ovid de Triſtibus, Gradus ad Parnaſſum;</hi> and in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> I have ſeveral of the beſt Books, tho' ſome of them are a little torn; but I have a great Part of <hi>Stow</hi>'s Chronicle; the ſixth Volume of <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Homer;</hi> the third Volume of the Spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator; the ſecond Volume of <hi>Echard</hi>'s <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtory; the Craftſman; <hi>Robinſon Cruſoe; Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas a Kempis,</hi> and two Volumes of <hi>Tom Brown</hi>'s Works.'</q>

               <p>As for <hi>Jones,</hi> he was well ſatisfied with the Truth of what the other had aſſerted, and believed that <hi>Partridge</hi> had no other Inducements but Love to him, and Zeal for the Cauſe. A blameable Want of Caution, and Diffidence in the Veracity of others, in which he was highly worthy of Cenſure. To ſay the Truth, there are but two Ways by which Men become poſſeſſed of this excellent Quality. The one is from long Experience, and the other is from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; which laſt, I preſume, is often meant by Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, or great natural Parts; and it is infinitely the better of the two, not only as we are Maſters of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

As <hi>Jones</hi> had not this Gift from Nature, he was too young to have gained it by Experience; for at the diffident Wiſdom which is to be acquired this Way, we ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom arrive till very late in Life; which is perhaps the Reaſon why ſome old Men are apt to deſpiſe the Underſtandings of all thoſe who are a little younger than themſelves.</p>

               <p>MR. <hi>Jones,</hi> and <hi>Partridge,</hi> or <hi>Little Benjamin,</hi> (which Epithet of <hi>Little</hi> was perhaps given him ironically, he being in reality near ſix Feet high) having left their laſt Quarters in the Manner before deſcribed, travelled on to <hi>Glouceſter</hi> without meeting any Adventure worth relating.</p>

He is indeed a very honeſt plain Man, and in my Opinion, not likely to create any Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance either in Church or State. His Wife hath I believe, had much Pretenſion to Beauty, and is ſtill a very fine Woman. Her Perſon and Deportment might have made a ſhining Figure in the politeſt Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies;

but though ſhe muſt be conſcious of this, and many other Perfections, ſhe ſeems perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with, and reſigned to that State of Life to which ſhe is called; and this Reſignation is entirely owing to the Prudence and Wiſdom of her Temper: For ſhe is at preſent as free from any methodiſtical Notions as her Huſband. I ſay at preſent: For ſhe freely confeſſes that her Brother's Documents made at firſt ſome Impreſſion upon her, and that ſhe had put herſelf to the Expence of a long Hood, in order to attend the extraordinary Emotions of the Spirit; but having found during an Experiment of three Weeks, no Emotions, ſhe ſays, worth a Farthing, ſhe very wiſely laid by her Hood, and abandoned the Sect. To be conciſe, ſhe is a very friendly, good-natured Woman, and ſo induſtrious to oblige, that the Gueſts muſt be of a very moroſe Diſpoſition who are not extremely well ſatisfied in her Houſe.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Whitefield</hi> happened to be in the Yard when <hi>Jones</hi> and his Attendant marched in. Her Sagacity ſoon diſcovered in the Air of our Hero ſomething which diſtinguiſhed him from the Vulgar. She or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered her Servants, therefore, immediately to ſhew him into a Room, and preſently afterwards invited him to Dinner with herſelf; which Invitation he ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thankfully accepted: For indeed much leſs agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Company than that of Mrs. <hi>Whitefield,</hi> and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

who lived ſomewhere near <hi>Lidlinch</hi> in <hi>Somerſetſhire.</hi> This Fellow, I ſay, ſtiled himſelf a Lawyer, but was indeed a moſt vile Petty-fogger, without Senſe or Knowledge of any Kind; one of thoſe who may be termed Train-bearers to the Law; a Sort of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernumeraries in the Profeſſion, who are the Hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys of Attornies, and will ride more Miles for half a Crown, than a Poſt-boy.</p>
               <p>During the time of Dinner, the <hi>Somerſetſhire</hi> Lawyer recollected the Face of <hi>Jones,</hi> which he had ſeen at Mr <hi>Allworthy</hi>'s: For he had often viſited in that Gentleman's Kitchen. He therefore took Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to enquire after the good Family there, with that Familiarity which would have become an intimate Friend or Acquaintance of Mr. <hi>Allworthy;</hi> and indeed he did all in his Power to inſinuate himſelf to be ſuch, though he had never had the Honour of ſpeaking to any Perſon in that Family higher than the Butler. <hi>Jones</hi> anſwered all his Queſtions with much Civility, though he never remembred to have ſeen the Petty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fogger before, and though he concluded from the outward Appearance and Behaviour of the Man, that he uſurped a Freedom with his Betters, to which he was by no means intitled.</p>
               <p>As the Converſation of Fellows of this Kind, is of all others the moſt deteſtable to Men of any Senſe, the Cloth was no ſooner removed than Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> withdrew, and a little barbarouſly left poor Mrs. <hi>Whitefield</hi> to do a Penance, which I have often heard Mr. <hi>Timothy Harris,</hi> and other Publicans of good Taſte, lament, as the ſevereſt Lot annexed to their Calling, namely, that of being obliged to keep Company with their Gueſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> had no ſooner quitted the Room, than the Petty-fogger, in a whiſpering Tone, aſked Mrs. <hi>Whitefield,</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">'if ſhe knew who that fine Spark was?'</q> She anſwered, <q rend="inline">'ſhe had never ſeen the Gentleman before. The Gentleman, indeed!' replied the

Petty-fogger, 'a pretty Gentleman truly! Why, he's the Baſtard of a Fellow who was hanged for Horſe-ſtealing. He was dropt at Squire <hi>Allwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi>'s Door, where one of the Servants found him in a Box ſo full of Rain-water, that he would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have been drowned, had he not been reſerved for another Fate.'</q>

                     <hi>Jones!'</hi> anſwered <hi>Dowling,</hi> a little eagerly, 'what, Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> that lived at Mr. <hi>Allworthy</hi>'s! was that the Gentleman that dined with us?' 'The very ſame,' ſaid the other. 'I have heard of the Gentleman,' cries <hi>Dowling,</hi> 'often, but I never
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0618300102:134"/>
heard any ill Character of him.' 'And I am ſure,' ſays Mrs. <hi>Whitefield,</hi> 'if half what this Gentleman hath ſaid be true, Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> hath the moſt deceitful Countenance I ever ſaw; for ſure his Looks promiſe ſomething very different; and I muſt ſay, for the little I have ſeen of him, he is as civil a well-bred Man as you would wiſh to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Pettyfogger calling to mind that he had not been ſworn, as he uſually was, before he gave his Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, now bound what he had declared with ſo many Oaths and Imprecations, that the Lady's Ears were ſhocked, and ſhe put a Stop to his ſwearing, by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring him of her Belief. Upon which he ſaid, <q rend="inline">'I hope, Madam, you imagine I would ſcorn to tell ſuch Things of any Man, unleſs I knew them to be true. What Intereſt have I in taking away the Reptutation of a Man who never injured me? I promiſe you every Syllable of what I have ſaid is Fact, and the whole Country knows it.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>As Mrs. <hi>Whitefield</hi> had no Reaſon to ſuſpect that the Pettyfogger had any Motive or Temptation to abuſe <hi>Jones,</hi> the Reader cannot blame her for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving what he ſo confidently affirmed with many Oaths. She accordingly gave up her Skill in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiognomy, and henceforwards conceived ſo ill an Opinion of her Gueſt, that ſhe heartily wiſhed him out of her Houſe.</p>
               <p>This Diſlike was now farther increaſed by a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port which Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> made from the Kitchen, where <hi>Partridge</hi> had informed the Company, <q rend="inline">'That tho' he carried the Knapſack, and contented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with ſtaying among Servants, while <hi>Tom Jones</hi> (as he called him) was regaling in the Parlour, he was not his Servant, but only a Friend and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, and as good a Gentleman as Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.'</q>

                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:0618300102:135"/>
                  <hi>Dowling</hi> ſat all this while ſilent, biting his Fingers, making Faces, grinning, and looking wonderfully arch; at laſt he opened his Lips, and proteſted that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman looked like another Sort of Man. He then called for his Bill with the utmoſt Haſte, declared he muſt be at <hi>Hertford</hi> that Evening, lamenting his great Hurry of Buſineſs, and wiſhed he could divide himſelf into twenty Pieces, in order to be at once in twenty Places.</p>
               <p>The Pettyfoggar now likewiſe departed, and then <hi>Jones</hi> deſired the Favour of Mrs. <hi>Whitefield</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to drink Tea with him; but ſhe refuſed, and with a Manner ſo different from that with which ſhe had received him at Dinner, that it a little ſurprized him. And now he perceived her Behaviour totally changed; for inſtead of that natural Affability which we have before celebrated, ſhe wore a conſtrained Severity on her Countenance, which was ſo diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> that he reſolved, however late, to quit the Houſe that Evening.</p>
               <p>He did indeed account ſomewhat unfairly for this ſudden Change; for beſides ſome hard and unjuſt Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes concerning Female Fickleneſs and Mutability, he began to ſuſpect that he owed this want of Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to his Want of Horſes, a Sort of Animals which, as they dirty no Sheets, are thought in Inns, to pay better for their Beds than their Riders, and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſidered as the more deſirable Company; but Mrs. <hi>Whitefield,</hi> to do her Juſtice, had a much more liberal Way of thinking. She was perfectly well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, and could be very civil to a Gentleman, tho' he walked on Foot: In Reality, ſhe looked on our Heroe as a ſorry Scoundrel, and therefore treated him as ſuch, for which not even <hi>Jones</hi> himſelf, had he known as much as the Reader, could have blamed her; nay, on the Contrary, he muſt have approved her Conduct, and have eſteemed her the more for the Diſreſpect ſhewn towards himſelf. This is indeed
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0618300102:136"/>
a moſt aggravating Circumſtance which attends un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly depriving Men of their Reputation; for a Man who is Conſcious of having an ill Character, cannot juſtly be angry with thoſe who neglect and ſlight him; but ought rather to deſpiſe thoſe that affect his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, unleſs where a perfect Intimacy muſt have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced them that their Friend's Character hath been falſely and injuriouſly aſperſed.</p>
               <p>This was not, however, the Caſe of <hi>Jones;</hi> for as he was a perfect Stranger to the Truth, ſo he was with good Reaſon offended at the Treatment he received. He therefore paid his Reckoning and departed, highly againſt the Will of Mr. <hi>Partridge,</hi> who having remonſtrated much againſt it to no Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, at laſt condeſcended to take up his Knapſack, and to attend his Friend.</p>

                  <q rend="inline">'but I would have you go back. I am obliged to you for your company hither, and I beg you to accept a Guinea as a ſmall Inſtance of my Gratitude. Nay, it would be cruel in me to ſuffer you to go any farther; for to deal plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with you, my chief End and Deſire is a glorious Death in the Service of my King and Country.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'As for your Money,' replied <hi>Partridge,</hi> 'I beg, Sir, you will put it up; I will receive none of you at this Time; for at preſent I am, I believe, the richer Man of the two. And as your Reſolution is to go on, ſo mine is to follow you if you do. Nay, now my preſence appears abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to take Care of you, ſince your Intentions are ſo deſperate, for I promiſe you my Views are much more prudent: As you are reſolved to fall in Battle, if you can, ſo I am reſolved as firmly to come to no Hurt if I can help it. And indeed I have the Comfort to think there will be but little Danger; for a Popiſh Prieſt told me the other Day, the Buſineſs would ſoon be over, and he believed without a Battle.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">A popiſh Prieſt,' cries <hi>Jones,</hi> 'I have heard, is not always to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved when he ſpeaks in Behalf of his Religion.'</q>

                  <q rend="inline">'I believe him to be as much a Proteſtant as I believe he hath any Right,' ſays <hi>Jones,</hi> 'and I make no Doubt of our Succeſs, but not without a Battle. So that I am not ſo ſanguine as your Friend the popiſh Prieſt.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Nay, to be ſure, Sir,' anſwered <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge,</hi> 'all the Prophecies I have ever read, ſpeak of a great deal of Blood to be ſpilt in the Quarrel, and the Miller with three Thumbs, who

                  <q rend="inline">'With what Stuff and Nonſenſe haſt thou filled thy Head,' anſwered <hi>Jones?</hi> This too, I ſuppoſe, comes from the popiſh Prieſt. Monſters and Prodigies are the proper Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to ſupport monſtrous and abſurd Doctrines. The Cauſe of King <hi>George</hi> is the Cauſe of Liberty and true Religion. In other Words, it is the Cauſe of common Senſe, my Boy, and I warrant you will ſucceed, tho' <hi>Briareus</hi> himſelf was to riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with his hundred Thumbs, and to turn Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler.'</q> 
                  <hi>Partridge</hi> made no Reply to this. He was indeed caſt in the utmoſt Confuſion by this Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>Jones.</hi> For to inform the Reader of a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, which we had no Opportunity of revealing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Partridge</hi> was in Truth a <hi>Jacobite,</hi> and had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that <hi>Jones</hi> was of the ſame Party, and was now proceeding to join the Rebels. An Opinion which was not without Foundation. For the tall long-ſided Dame, mentioned by <hi>Hudibras;</hi> that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny-eyed, many-tongued, many-mouthed, many-eared Monſter of <hi>Virgil,</hi> had related the Story of the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel between <hi>Jones</hi> and the Officer, with her uſual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Truth. She had indeed changed the Name of <hi>Sophia</hi> into that of the Pretender, and had report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that drinking his Health was the Cauſe for which <hi>Jones</hi> was knocked down. This <hi>Partridge</hi> had heard, and moſt firmly believed. 'Tis no Wonder, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that he had thence entertained the above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Opinion of <hi>Jones;</hi> and which he had almoſt diſcovered to him before he found out his own Miſtake. And at this the Reader will be the leſs inclined to wonder, if he pleaſes to recollect the doubtful Phraſe in which <hi>Jones</hi> firſt communicated his Reſolution to Mr. <hi>Partridge;</hi> and, indeed, had the Words been leſs ambiguous, <hi>Partridge</hi> might very well have conſtrued them as he did; being perſuaded, as he was, that
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0618300102:142"/>
the whole Nation were of the ſame Inclination in their Hearts: Nor did it ſtagger him that <hi>Jones</hi> had travelled in the Company of Soldiers; for he had the ſame Opinion of the Army which he had of the reſt of People.</p>
               <p>But however well affected he might be to <hi>James</hi> or <hi>Charles,</hi> he was ſtill much more attached to <hi>Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Benjamin</hi> than to either: for which Reaſon he no ſooner diſcovered the Principles of his Fellow-tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller, than he thought proper to conceal, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to give up his own to the Man on whom he depended for the making his Fortune, ſince he by no means believed the Affairs of <hi>Jones</hi> to be ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate as they really were with Mr. <hi>Allworthy;</hi> for as he had kept a conſtant Correſpondence with ſome of his Neighbours ſince he left that Country, he had heard much, indeed more than was true, of the great Affection Mr. <hi>Allworthy</hi> bore this young Man, who, as <hi>Partridge</hi> had been inſtructed, was to be that Gentleman's Heir, and whom, as we have ſaid, he did not in the leaſt doubt to be his Son.</p>
               <p>He imagined, therefore, that whatever Quarrel was between them, it would be certainly made up at the Return of Mr. <hi>Jones;</hi> an Event from which he promiſed great Advantages, if he could take this Opportunity of ingratiating himſelf with that young Gentleman; and if he could by any Means be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in procuring his Return, he doubted not, as we have before ſaid, but it would as highly advance him in the Favour of Mr. <hi>Allworthy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have already obſerved, that he was a very good-natured Fellow, and he hath himſelf declared the violent Attachment he had to the Perſon and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of <hi>Jones;</hi> but poſſibly the Views which I have juſt before mentioned, might likewiſe have ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Share in prompting him to undertake this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, at leaſt in urging him to continue it, after he had diſcovered, that his Maſter and himſelf, like
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0618300102:143"/>
ſome prudent Fathers and Sons, tho' they travelled together in great Friendſhip, had embraced oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Parties. I am led into this Conjecture, by hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing remarked, that tho' Love, Friendſhip, Eſteem, and ſuch like, have very powerful Operations in the human Mind; Intereſt, however, is an Ingredient ſeldom omitted by wiſe Men, when they would work others to their own Purpoſes. This is indeed a moſt excellent Medicine, and like <hi>Ward</hi>'s Pill, flies at once to the particular Part of the Body on which you deſire to operate, whether it be the Tongue, the Hand, or any other Member, where it ſcarce ever fails of immediately producing the deſired Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>

               <p>JUST as <hi>Jones</hi> and his Friend came to the End of their Dialogue in the preceding Chapter, they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the Bottom of a very ſteep Hill. Here <hi>Jones</hi> ſtopt ſhort, and directing his Eyes upwards, ſtood for a while ſilent. At length he called to his Companion, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>'Partridge,</hi> I wiſh I was at the Top of this Hill; it muſt certainly afford a moſt charming Proſpect, eſpecially by this Light: For the ſolemn Gloom which the Moon caſts on all Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, is beyond Expreſſion beautiful, eſpecially to an Imagination which is deſirous of cultivating me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy Ideas.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">Very probably,' anſwered <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge;</hi> 'but if the Top of the Hill be propereſt to produce melancholy Thoughts, I ſuppoſe the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom is the likelieſt to produce merry ones, and theſe I take to be much the better of the two. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt you have made my Blood run cold with the very mentioning the Top of that Mountain; which ſeems to me to be one of the higheſt in the World. No,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0618300102:144"/>
no, if we look for any thing, let it be for a Place under Ground, to ſcreen ourſelves from the Froſt.</q>—<q rend="inline">Do ſo, ſaid <hi>Jones,</hi> let it be but within Hearing of this Place, and I will hollow to you at my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn back.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Surely, Sir, you are not mad,'</q> ſaid <hi>Partridge.</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Indeed I am,' anſwered <hi>Jones,</hi> 'if aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending this Hill be Madneſs: But as you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain ſo much of the cold already, I would have you ſtay below. I will certainly return to you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in an Hour.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">Pardon me, Sir,' cries <hi>Partridge,</hi> I have determined to follow you where-ever you go.'</q> Indeed he was now afraid to ſtay behind; for tho' he was Coward enough in all Reſpects, yet his chief Fear was that of Ghoſts, with which the preſent Time of Night, and the Wildneſs of the Place, extremely well ſuited.</p>
               <p>At this Inſtant <hi>Partridge</hi> eſpied a glimmering Light through ſome Trees, which ſeemed very near to them. He immediately cried out in a Rapture, <q rend="inline">'Oh, Sir! Heaven hath at laſt heard my Prayers, and hath brought us to a Houſe; perhaps it may be an Inn. Let me beſeech you, Sir, if you have any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion either for me or yourſelf, do not deſpiſe the the Goodneſs of Providence, but let us go directly to yon Light. Whether it be a Publick-houſe or no, I am ſure if they be Chriſtians that dwell there, they will not refuſe a little Houſe-room to Perſons in our miſerable Condition.'</q> 
                  <hi>Jones</hi> at length yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the earneſt Supplications of <hi>Partridge,</hi> and both together made directly towards the Place whence the Light iſſued.</p>
               <p>They ſoon arrived at the Door of this Houſe or Cottage: For it might be called either, without much Impropriety. Here <hi>Jones</hi> knocked ſeveral Times with-receiving any Anſwer from within; at which <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge,</hi> whoſe head was full of nothing but of Ghoſts, Devils, Witches, and ſuch like, began to tremble, crying <q rend="inline">'Lord have Mercy upon us, ſure the People
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0618300102:145"/>
muſt be all dead. I can ſee no Light neither now, and yet I am certain I ſaw a Candle burning but a Moment before—Well! I have heard of ſuch Things.—</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">What haſt thou heard of,' ſaid <hi>Jones.</hi> The People are either faſt aſleep, or probably as this is a lonely Place, are afraid to open their Door.'</q> He then began to vociferate pretty loudly, and at laſt an old Woman opening an upper Caſement, aſked who they were, and what they wanted? <hi>Jones</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <q rend="inline">'they were Travellers who had loſt their Way, and having ſeen a Light in the Window, had been led thither in Hopes of finding ſome Fire to warm themſelves.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">Whoever, you are,' cries the Woman, 'you have no Buſineſs here; nor ſhall I op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the Door to any body a this Time of Night.'</q> 
                  <hi>Partridge,</hi> whom the Sound of a human Voice had recovered from his Fright, fell to the moſt earneſt Supplications to be admitted for a few Minutes to the Fire, ſaying, <q rend="inline">'he was almoſt dead with the Cold,'</q> to which Fear had indeed contributed equally with the Froſt. He aſſured her, that the Gentleman who ſpoke to her, was one of the greateſt Squires in the Country, and made uſe of every Argument ſave one, which <hi>Jones</hi> afterwards effectually added, and this was the Promiſe of half a Crown. A Bribe too great to be reſiſted by ſuch a Perſon, eſpecially as the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel Appearance of <hi>Jones,</hi> which the Light of the Moon plainly diſcovered to her, together with his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable Behaviour, had entirely ſubdued thoſe Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of Thieves which ſhe had at firſt conceived. She agreed, therefore, at laſt to let them in, where <hi>Partridge,</hi> to his infinite Joy, found a good Fire rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for his Reception.</p>
               <p>The poor Fellow, however, had no ſooner warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf, than thoſe Thoughts which were always uppermoſt in his Mind, began a little to diſturb his Brain. There was no Article of his Creed in which he had a ſtronger Faith, than he had in Witchcraft,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0618300102:146"/>
nor can the Reader conceive a Figure more adapted to inſpire this Idea, than the old Woman, who now ſtood before him. She anſwered exactly to that Picture drawn by <hi>Otway,</hi> in his Orphan. Indeed if this Woman had lived in the Reign of <hi>James</hi> the Firſt, her Appearance alone would have hanged her, almoſt without any Evidence.</p>
               <p>Many Circumſtances likewiſe conſpired to confirm <hi>Partridge</hi> in his Opinion. Her living, as he then imagined, by herſelf in ſo lonely a Place; and in a Houſe, the Outſide of which ſeemed much too good for her; but where the Inſide was furniſhed in the moſt neat and elegant Manner. To ſay the Truth, <hi>Jones</hi> himſelf was not a little ſurprized at what he ſaw: For, beſides the extraordinary Neatneſs of the Room, it was adorned with a great Number of Nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacks, and Curioſities, which might have engaged the Attention of a Virtuoſo.</p>
               <p>While <hi>Jones</hi> was admiring theſe Things, and <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge</hi> ſat trembling with the firm Belief that he was in the Houſe of a Witch, the old Woman ſaid, <q rend="inline">'I hope, Gentlemen, you will make what Haſte you can; for I expect my Maſter preſently, and I would not for double the Money he ſhould find you here.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Then you have a Maſter,' cries <hi>Jones;</hi> indeed you will excuſe me, good Woman, but I was ſurprized to ſee all thoſe fine Things in your Houſe.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Ah, Sir!' ſaid ſhe, 'if the twentieth Part of theſe Things were mine, I ſhould think myſelf a rich Woman; but pray, Sir, do not ſtay much longer: For I look for him in every Minute.'</q>—<q rend="inline">'Why ſure he would not be angry with you,' ſaid <hi>Jones,</hi> 'for doing a common Act of Charity.</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">Alack-a-day, Sir,' ſaid ſhe, 'he is a ſtrange Man, not at all like other People. He keeps no Company with any Body, and ſeldom walks out but by Night, for he doth not care to be ſeen; and all the Country Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0618300102:147"/>
are as much afraid of meeting him; for his Dreſs is enough to frighten thoſe who are not uſed to it. They call him, <hi>The Man of the Hill</hi> (for there he walks by Night) and the Country People are not, I believe, more afraid of the Devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He would be terribly angry if he found you here.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Pray, Sir,' ſays <hi>Partridge,</hi> 'don't let us offend the Gentleman, I am ready to walk, and was never warmer in my Life.—Do, pray Sir, let us go—here are Piſtols over the Chimney; who knows whether they be charged or no, or what he may do with them.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Fear nothing, <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge,'</hi> cries <hi>Jones,</hi> 'I will ſecure thee from Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.'</q>— <q rend="inline">'Nay, for Matter o' that, he never doth any Miſchief,' ſaid the Woman; 'but to be ſure it is neceſſary he ſhould keep ſome Arms for his own Safety: for his Houſe hath been beſet more than once, and it is not many Nights ago, that we thought we heard Thieves about it: for my own Part, I have often wondered that he is not murdered by ſome Villain or other, as he walks out by himſelf at ſuch Hours; but then as I ſaid, the People are afraid of him, and beſides they think, I ſuppoſe, he hath nothing about him worth taking.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'I ſhould imagine, by this Collection of Rarities,' cries <hi>Jones,</hi> that your Maſter had been a Traveller.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Yes, Sir,' anſwered ſhe, 'he hath been a very great one; there be few Gentlemen that know more of all Matters than he; I fancy he hath been croſt in Love, or whatever it is, I know not, but I have lived with him above theſe thirty Years, and in all that Time he hath hardly ſpoke to ſix living People.'</q> She then again ſolicited their Departure, in which ſhe was backed by <hi>Partridge;</hi> but <hi>Jones</hi> purpoſely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the time: For his Curioſity was greatly raiſed to ſee this extraordinary Perſon.

ſo far as to pull him by the Sleeve, he ſtill continued to invent new Queſtions, till the old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with an affrighted Countenance, declared ſhe heard her Maſter's Signal; and at the ſame Inſtant more than one Voice was heard without the Door, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

True it is, that Philoſophy makes us wiſer, but Chriſtianity makes us better Men. Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy elevates and ſteels the Mind, Chriſtianity ſoftens and ſweetens it.

'And ſuch,' ſaid the Stranger, 'will be always the moſt backward to aſſert any ſuch thing. Knaves will no more endeavour to perſuade us of the Baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mankind, than a Highwayman will inform you that there are Thieves on the Road. This would indeed be a Method to put you on your Guard, and to defeat their own Purpoſes. For which Reaſon, tho' Knaves, as I remember, are very apt to abuſe particular Perſons; yet they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver caſt any Reflection on Human Nature in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.'</q> The old Gentleman ſpoke this ſo warmly, that as <hi>Jones</hi> deſpaired of making a Convert, and was unwilling to offend, he returned no Anſwer.</p>
               <p>The Day now began to ſend forth its firſt Streams of Light, when <hi>Jones</hi> made an Apology to the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger for his having ſtaid ſo long, and perhaps having detained him from his Reſt. The Stranger anſwered, <q rend="inline">'He never wanted Reſt leſs than at preſent; for that Day and Night were indifferent Seaſons to him, and that he commonly made uſe of the former for the Time of his Repoſe, and of the latter for his Walks and Lucubrations. However,' ſaid he, 'it is now a moſt lovely Morning, and if you can bear any longer to be without your own Reſt or Food, I will gladly entertain you with the Sight of ſome very fine Proſpects, which I believe you have not yet ſeen.'</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> very readily embraced this Offer, and they immediately ſet forward together from the Cottage. As for <hi>Partridge,</hi> he had fallen into a profound Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, juſt as the Stranger had finiſhed his Story; for his Curioſity was ſatisfied, and the ſubſequent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was not forcible enough in its Operation to conjure down the Charms of Sleep. <hi>Jones</hi> therefore left him to enjoy his Nap; and as the Reader may perhaps be, at this Seaſon, glad of the ſame Favour, we will here put an End to the Eighth Book of our Hiſtory.</p>

               <p>AMONG other good Uſes for which I have thought proper to inſtitute theſe ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troductory Chapters, I have conſidered them as a Kind of Mark or Stamp, which may hereafter enable a very indifferent Reader to diſtinguiſh, what is true and genuine in this hiſtoric kind of Writing, from what is falſe and counterfeit. Indeed it ſeems likely that ſome ſuch Mark may ſhortly become ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, ſince the favourable Reception which two or three Authors have lately procured for their Works of this Nature from the Public, will probably ſerve as an Encroachment to many others to undertake the like. Thus a Swarm of fooliſh Novels, and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Romances will be produced, either to the great impoveriſhing of Bookſellers, or to the great Loſs of Time, and Depravation of Morals in the Reader;
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0618300102:197"/>
nay, often to the ſpreading of Scandal and Calumny, and to the Prejudice of the Characters of many wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and honeſt People.</p>
               <p>I queſtion not but the ingenious Author of the Spectator was principally induced to perfix <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Mottos to every Paper from the ſame Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of guarding againſt the Purſuit of thoſe Scrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers, who, having no Talents of a Writer but what is taught by the Writing-maſter, are yet no wiſe afraid nor more aſhamed to aſſume the ſame Titles with the greateſt Genius, than their good Brother in the Fable was of braying in the Lion's Skin.</p>
               <p>By the Device therefore of his Motto, it became impracticable for any Man to preſume to imitate the Spectators, without underſtanding at leaſt one Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in the learned Languages. In the ſame Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I have now ſecured myſelf from the Imitation of thoſe who are utterly incapable of any Degree of Reflection, and whoſe Learning is not equal to an Eſſay.</p>
               <p>I would not here be underſtood to inſinuate, that the greateſt Merit of ſuch hiſtorical Productions can ever lie in theſe introductory Chapters; but, in Fact, thoſe Parts which contain mere Narrative only, afford much more Encouragement to the Pen of an Imitator, than thoſe which are compoſed of Obſervation and Reflection. Here I mean ſuch Imitators as <hi>Rowe</hi> was of <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> or as <hi>Horace</hi> hints ſome of the the <hi>Romans</hi> were of <hi>Cato,</hi> by bare Feet and ſour Faces.</p>
               <p>To invent good Stories, and to tell them well, are poſſibly very rare Talents, and yet I have obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed few Perſons who have ſcrupled to aim at both; and if we examine the Romances and Novels with which the world abounds, I think we may fairly conclude that moſt of the Authors would not have attempted to ſhew their Teeth (if the Expreſſion may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed me) in any other Way of Writing; nor could indeed have ſtrung together a dozen Sentences on any other Subject whatever. <hi>Scribimus indocti docti<expan>

               <p>Our Heroe, at his Departure to make this Enquiry of his Friend, had conſidered, that as the Ruffian's Hands were tied behind him, he was incapable of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting any wicked Purpoſes on the poor Woman.

But <hi>Jones</hi> unluckily forgot that tho' the Hands of <hi>Northerton</hi> were tied, his Legs were at Liberty; nor did he lay the leaſt Injunction on the Priſoner, that he ſhould not make what uſe of theſe he pleaſed. <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therton</hi> therefore having given no Parole of that Kind, thought he might, without any Breach of Honour, depart, not being obliged, as he imagined, by any Rules, to wait for a formal Diſcharge. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore took up his Legs, which were at Liberty, and walked off thro' the Wood, which favoured his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat; nor did the Woman, whoſe Eyes were perhaps rather turned towards her Deliverer, once think of his Eſcape, or give herſelf any Concern or Trouble to prevent it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> therefore, at his Return, found the Woman alone. He would have ſpent ſome Time in ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for <hi>Northerton;</hi> but ſhe would not permit him; earneſtly entreating that he would accompany her to the Town whither they had been directed. <q rend="inline">'As to the Fellow's Eſcape,' ſaid ſhe, 'it gives me no Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs: For Philoſophy and Chriſtianity both preach up Forgiveneſs of Injuries. But for you, Sir, I
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0618300102:207"/>
am concerned at the Trouble I give you, nay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed my Nakedneſs may well make me aſhamed to look you in the Face; and if it was not for the Sake of your Protection, I ſhould wiſh to go alone.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> offered her his Coat; but, I know not for what Reaſon, ſhe abſolutely refuſed the moſt earneſt Solicitations to accept it. He then begged her to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get both the Cauſes of her Confuſion. <q rend="inline">'With Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the former,' ſays he, 'I have done no more than my Duty in protecting you; and as for the latter, I will entirely remove it, by walking before you all the Way; for I would not have my Eyes offend you, and I could not anſwer for my Power of reſiſting the attractive Charms of ſo much Beauty.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus our Heroe and the redeemed Lady walked in the ſame Manner as <hi>Orpheus</hi> and <hi>Eurydice</hi> marched heretofore: But tho' I cannot believe that <hi>Jones</hi> was deſignedly tempted by his Fair One to look behind him, yet as ſhe frequently wanted his Aſſiſtance to help her over Stiles, and had beſides many Trips and other Accidents, he was often obliged to turn about. However, he had better Fortune than what attended poor <hi>Orpheus;</hi> for he brought his Companion, or rather Follower, ſafe into the famous Town of <hi>Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. III. <hi>The Arrival of Mr.</hi> Jones, <hi>with his Lady, at the Inn, with a very full Deſcription of the Battle of</hi> Upton.</head>
               <p>THO' the Reader, we doubt not, is very eager to know what this Lady was, and how ſhe fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Hands of Mr. <hi>Northerton;</hi> we muſt beg him to ſuſpend his Curioſity for a ſhort Time, as we are obliged, for ſome very good Reaſons, which hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0618300102:208"/>
perhaps he may gueſs, to delay his Satisfaction a little longer.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> and his fair Companion no ſooner en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the Town, than they went directly to that Inn which, in their Eyes, preſented the faireſt Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the Street. Here <hi>Jones,</hi> having ordered a Servant to ſhew a Room above Stairs, was aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when the diſhevelled Fair haſtily following, was laid hold on by the Maſter of the Houſe, who cried, <q rend="inline">'Hey day, where is that Beggar Wench going? ſtay below Stairs, I deſire you;'</q> but <hi>Jones</hi> at that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant thundered from above, 'Let the Lady come 'up,' in ſo authoritative a Voice, that the good Man inſtantly withdrew his Hands, and the Lady made the beſt of her way to the Chamber.</p>
               <p>Here <hi>Jones</hi> wiſhed her Joy of her ſafe Arrival, and then departed, in order, as he promiſed, to ſend, the Landlady up with ſome Cloaths. The poor Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man thanked him heartily for all his Kindneſs, and ſaid, She ſhould ſee him again ſoon, to thank him a thouſand Times more. During this ſhort Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhe covered her white Boſom as well as ſhe could poſſibly with her Arms: For <hi>Jones</hi> could not avoid ſtealing a Peep or two, tho' he took all imaginable Care to avoid giving any Offence.</p>
               <p>Our Travellers had happened to take up their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence at a Houſe of exceeding good Repute, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Iriſh</hi> Ladies of ſtrict Virtue, and many Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Laſſes of the ſame Predicament, were accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to reſort in their Way to <hi>Bath.</hi> The Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady therefore would by no Means have admitted any Converſation of a diſreputable Kind to paſs under her Roof. Indeed ſo foul and contagious are all ſuch Proceedings, that they contaminate the very inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Scenes where they are committed, and give the Name of a bad Houſe, or of a Houſe of ill Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, to all thoſe where they are ſuffered to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:0618300102:209"/>
Not that I would intimate, that ſuch ſtrict Chaſtity as was preſerved in the Temple of <hi>Veſta</hi> can poſſibly be maintained at a public Inn. My good Landlady did not hope for ſuch a Bleſſing, nor would any of the Ladies I have ſpoken of, or indeed any others of the moſt rigid Note, have expected or inſiſted on any ſuch Thing. But to exclude all Vulgar Concubinage, and to drive all Whores in Rags from within the Walls, is within the Power of every one. This my Landlady very ſtiffly adhered to, and this her virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Gueſts, who did not travel in Rags, would very reaſonably have expected of her.</p>
               <p>Now it required no very blameable Degree of Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion, to imagine that Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> and his ragged Companion had certain Purpoſes in their Intention, which, tho' tolerated in ſome Chriſtian Countries, connived at in others, and practiſed in all; are how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever as expreſsly forbidden as Murder, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther horrid Vice, by that Religion which is univerſally believed in thoſe Countries. The Landlady there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had no ſooner received an Intimation of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the aboveſaid Perſons, than ſhe began to meditate the moſt expeditious Means for their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion. In order to this, ſhe had provided herſelf with a long and deadly Inſtrument, with which, in Times of Peace, the Chambermaid was wont to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh the Labours of the Induſtrious Spider. In vulgar Phraſe, ſhe had taken up the Broomſtick, and was juſt about to ſally from the Kitchen, when <hi>Jones</hi> accoſted her with a Demand of a Gown, and other Veſtments, to cover the half naked woman above Stairs.</p>
               <p>Nothing can be more provoking to the human Temper, nor more dangerous to that cardinal Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, Patience, than Solicitations of extraordinary Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of Kindneſs, on Behalf of thoſe very Perſons with whom we are highly incenſed. For this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0618300102:210"/>
                  <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> hath artfully introduced his <hi>Deſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona</hi> ſoliciting Favours for <hi>Caſſio</hi> of her Huſband, as the Means of enflaming not only his Jealouſy, but his Rage, to the higheſt Pitch of Madneſs; and we find the unfortunate Moor leſs able to Command his Paſſion on this Occaſion, than even when he beheld his valued Preſent to his Wife in the Hands of his ſuppoſed Rival. In Fact, we regard theſe Efforts as Inſults on our Underſtanding, and to ſuch the Pride of Man is very difficultly brought to ſubmit.</p>
               <p>My Landlady, though a very good-tempered Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, had, I ſuppoſe, ſome of this Pride in her Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; for <hi>Jones</hi> had ſcarce ended his Requeſt, when ſhe fell upon him with a certain Weapon, which tho' it be neither long, nor ſharp, nor hard, nor indeed threatens from its Appearance with either Death or Wound, hath been however held in great Dread and Abhorrence by many wiſe Men; nay, by many brave ones; inſomuch that ſome who have dared to look into the Mouth of a loaded Cannon, have not dared to look into a Mouth where this Weapon was bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhed; and rather than run the Hazard of its Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, have contented themſelves with making a moſt pitiful and ſneaking Figure in the Eyes of all their Acquaintance.</p>
               <p>To Confeſs the Truth, I am afraid Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> was one of theſe; for tho' he was attacked and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently belaboured with the aforeſaid Weapon, he could not be provoked to make any Reſiſtance; but in a moſt cowardly Manner applied, with many Entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, to his Antagoniſt to deſiſt from purſuing her Blows; in plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> he only begged her with the utmoſt Earneſtneſs to hear him; but before he could obtain his Requeſt, my Landlord himſelf en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the Fray, and embraced that Side of the Cauſe which ſeemed to ſtand very little in need of Aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:0618300102:211"/>
There are a Sort of Heroes who are ſuppoſed to be determined in their chuſing or avoiding a Conflict by the Character and Behaviour of the Perſon whom they are to engage. Theſe are ſaid to know their Man, and <hi>Jones,</hi> I believe, knew his Woman; for tho' he had been ſo ſubmiſſive to her, he was no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er attacked by her Huſband, than he demonſtrated an immediate Spirit of Reſentment, and enjoined him Silence under a very ſevere Penalty; no leſs than that, I think, of being converted into Fuel for his own Fire.</p>
               <p>The Huſband, with great Indignation, but with a Mixture of Pity, anſwered, <q rend="inline">'You muſt pray firſt to be made able; I believe I am a better Man than yourſelf; ay, every Way, that I am;'</q> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently proceeded to diſcharge half a dozen Whores at the Lady above Stairs, the laſt of which had ſcarce iſſued from his Lips, when a ſwinging Blow from the Cudgel that <hi>Jones</hi> carried in his Hand aſſaulted him over the Shoulders.</p>
               <p>It is a Queſtion whether the Landlord or the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady was the moſt expeditious in returning this Blow. My Landlord, whoſe Hands were empty, fell to with his Fiſt, and the good Wife, uplifting her Broom, and aiming at the Head of <hi>Jones,</hi> had probably put an immediate End to the Fray, and to <hi>Jones</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, had not the Deſcent of this Broom been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented—not by the miraculous Intervention of any Heathen Deity, but by a very natural, tho' for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Accident; <hi>viz.</hi> by the Arrival of <hi>Partridge;</hi> who entered the Houſe at that Inſtant (for Fear had cauſed him to run every Step from the Hill) and who, ſeeing the Danger which threatened his Maſter, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Companion, (which you chuſe to call him) prevented ſo ſad a Cataſtrophe, by catching hold of the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady's Arm, as it was brandiſhed aloft in the Air.</p>
               <p>The Landlady ſoon perceived the Impediment which prevented her Blow; and being unable to
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0618300102:212"/>
reſcue her Arm from the Hands of <hi>Partridge,</hi> ſhe let fall the Broom, and then leaving <hi>Jones</hi> to the Diſcipline of her Huſband, ſhe fell with the utmoſt Fury on that poor Fellow, who had already given ſome Intimation of himſelf, by crying, 'Zounds! do 'you intend to kill my Friend?'</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Partridge,</hi> though not much addicted to Battle, would not however ſtand ſtill when his Friend was attacked; nor was he much diſpleaſed with that Part of the Combat which fell to his Share: He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore returned my Landlady's Blows as ſoon as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them; and now the Fight was obſtinately maintained on all Parts, and it ſeemed doubtful to which Side Fortune would incline, when the naked Lady, who had liſtened at the Top of the Stairs to the Dialogue which preceded the Engagement, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended ſuddenly from above, and without weighing the unfair Inequality of two to one, fell upon the poor Woman who was boxing with <hi>Partridge;</hi> nor did that great Champion deſiſt, but rather redoubled his Fury, when he found freſh Succours were arrived to his Aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>Victory muſt now have fallen to the Side of the Travellers (for the braveſt Troops muſt yield to Numbers) had not <hi>Suſan</hi> the Chambermaid come luckily to ſupport her Miſtreſs. This <hi>Suſan</hi> was as two-handed a Wench (according to the Phraſe) as any in the Country, and would, I believe, have beat the famed <hi>Thaleſtris</hi> herſelf, or any of her ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject <hi>Amazons;</hi> for her Form was robuſt and manlike, and every Way made for ſuch Encounters. As her Hands and Arms were formed to give Blows with great Miſchief to an Enemy, ſo was her Face as well contrived to receive Blows without any great Injury to herſelf: Her Noſe being already flat to her Face; her Lips were ſo large that no Swelling could be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in them, and moreover they were ſo hard,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0618300102:213"/>
that a Fiſt could hardly make any Impreſſion on them. Laſtly, her Cheek-Bones ſtood out, as if Nature had intended them for two Baſtions to defend her Eyes in thoſe Encounters for which ſhe ſeemed ſo well calculated, and to which ſhe was moſt wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully well inclined.</p>
               <p>This fair Creature entering the Field of Battle, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately filed to that Wing where her Miſtreſs maintained ſo unequal a Fight with one of either Sex. Here ſhe preſently challenged <hi>Partridge</hi> to ſingle Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat. He accepted the Challenge, and a moſt deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Fight began between them.</p>
               <p>Now the Dogs of War being let looſe, began to lick their bloody Lips; now Victory with Golden Wings hung hovering in the Air. Now Fortune tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Scales from her Shelf, began to weigh the Fates of <hi>Tom Jones,</hi> his Female Companion, and <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge,</hi> againſt the Landlord, his Wife, and Maid; all which hung in exact Ballance before her; when a good-natured Accident put ſuddenly an End to the bloody Fray, with which half of the Combatants had already ſufficiently feaſted. This Accident was the Arrival of a Coach and four; upon which my Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord and Landlady immediately deſiſted from fighting, and at their Entreaty obtained the ſame Favour of their Antagoniſts; but <hi>Suſan</hi> was not ſo kind to <hi>Partridge,</hi> for that <hi>Amazonian</hi> Fair having overthrown and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrid her Enemy, was now cuffing him luſtily with both her Hands, without any Regard to his Requeſt of a Ceſſation of Arms, or to thoſe loud Acclamations of Murder which he roared forth.</p>
               <p>No ſooner, however, had <hi>Jones</hi> quitted the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord, than he flew to the Reſcue of his defeated Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, from whom he with much Difficulty drew off the enraged Chambermaid; but <hi>Partridge</hi> was not immediately ſenſible of his Deliverance; for he ſtill lay flat on the Floor, guarding his Face with his Hands, nor did he ceaſe roaring till <hi>Jones</hi> had forced
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0618300102:214"/>
him to look up, and to perceive that the Battle was at an End.</p>
               <p>The Landlord who had no viſible Hurt, and the Landlady hiding her well ſcratched Face with her Handkerchief ran both haſtily to the Door to attend the Coach, from which a young Lady and her Maid now alighted. Theſe the Landlady preſently uſhered into that Room where Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> had at firſt depoſited his fair Prize, as it was the beſt Apartment in the Houſe. Hither they were obliged to paſs through the Field of Battle, which they did with the utmoſt Haſte, covering their Faces with their Handkerchiefs, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to avoid the Notice of any one. Indeed their Caution was quite unneceſſary: For the poor unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate <hi>Helen,</hi> the fatal Cauſe of all the Bloodſhed, was entirely taken up in endeavouring to conceal her own Face, and <hi>Jones</hi> was no leſs occupied in reſcuing <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge</hi> from the Fury of <hi>Suſan;</hi> which being happily effected, the poor Fellow immediately departed to the Pump to waſh his Face, and to ſtop that bloody Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent which <hi>Suſan</hi> had plentifully ſet a flowing from his Noſtrils.</p>

               <p>A Serjeant and a File of Muſqueteers, with a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerter in their Cuſtody, arrived about this Time. The Serjeant preſently enquired for the principal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate of the Town, and was informed by my Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord, that he himſelf was veſted in that Office. He then demanded his Billets, together with a Mug of Beer, and complaining it was cold, ſpread himſelf before the Kitchen Fire.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> was at this Time comforting the poor diſtreſſed Lady, who ſat down at a Table in the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0618300102:215"/>
Kitchen, and leaning her Head upon her Arm, was bemoaning her Misfortunes; but leſt my fair Readers ſhould be in Pain concerning a particular Circumſtance, I think proper here to acquaint them, that before ſhe had quitted the Room above Stairs, ſhe had ſo well covered herſelf with a Pillowbere which ſhe there found, that her Regard to Decency was not in the leaſt violated by the Preſence of ſo many Men as were now in the Room.</p>
               <p>One of the Soldiers now went up to the Serjeant, and whiſpered ſomething in his Ear; upon which he ſtedfaſtly fixed his Eyes on the Lady, and having look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at her for near a Minute, he came up to her, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <q rend="inline">'I aſk Pardon, Madam, but I am certain I am not deceived, you can be no other Perſon than Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Waters</hi>'s Lady.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>The poor Woman, who in her preſent Diſtreſs had very little regarded the Face of any Perſon preſent, no ſooner looked at the Serjeant, than ſhe preſently recollected him, and calling him by his Name, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <q rend="inline">'That ſhe was indeed the unhappy Perſon he imagined her to be; but added, I wonder any one ſhould know me in this Diſguiſe.'</q> To which the Serjeant replied, <q rend="inline">'he was very much ſurprized to ſee her Ladyſhip in ſuch a Dreſs, and was afraid ſome Accident had happened to her.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'An Accident hath happened to me, indeed,' ſays ſhe, 'and I am highly obliged to this Gentleman (pointing to <hi>Jones)</hi> that it was not a fatal one, or that I am now living to mention it.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline"> 'Whatever the Gentleman hath done,' cries the Serjeant, 'I am ſure the Captain will make him Amends for it; and if I can be of any Service, your Ladyſhip may command me, and I ſhall think myſelf very happy to have it in my Power to ſerve your Ladyſhip; and ſo indeed may any one, for I know the Captain will well reward them for it.'</q>

                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:0618300102:216"/>
The Landlady who heard from the Stairs all that paſt between the Serjeant and Mrs. <hi>Waters,</hi> came haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily down, and running directly up to her, began to aſk Pardon for the Offences ſhe had committed, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging that all might be imputed to Ignorance of her Quality: For, <q rend="inline"> 'Lud! Madam,' ſays ſhe, 'how ſhould I have imagined that a Lady of your Faſhion would appear in ſuch a Dreſs? I am ſure, Madam, if I had once ſuſpected that your Ladyſhip was your Ladyſhip, I would ſooner have burnt my Tongue out, than have ſaid what I have ſaid: And I hope your Ladyſhip will accept of a Gown, till you can get your own Cloaths.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'Prithee Woman,' ſays Mrs. <hi>Waters,</hi> 'ceaſe your Impertinence: How can you imagine I ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern myſelf about any thing which comes from the Lips of ſuch low Creatures as yourſelf. But I am ſurprized at your Aſſurance in thinking, after what is paſt, that I will condeſcend to put on any of your dirty Things. I would have you know, Creature, I have a Spirit above that.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here <hi>Jones</hi> interfered, and begg'd Mrs. <hi>Waters</hi> to forgive the Landlady, and to accept her Gown: <q rend="inline">'For I muſt confeſs,' cries he, 'our Appearance was a little ſuſpicious when firſt we came in; and I am well aſſured, all this good Woman did, was, as ſhe profeſſed, out of Regard to the Reputation of her Houſe.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'Yes, upon my truly was it,' ſays ſhe; 'the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman ſpeaks very much like a Gentleman, and I ſee very plainly is ſo; and to be certain the Houſe is well known to be a Houſe of as good Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as any on the Road, and tho' I ſay it, is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Gentry of the beſt Quality, both <hi>Iriſh</hi> and <hi>Engliſh.</hi> I defy any Body to ſay black is my Eye, for that Matter. And, as I was ſaying, if I had known your Ladyſhip to be your Ladyſhip, I would as ſoon have burnt my Fingers as have affronted
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0618300102:217"/>
your Ladyſhip; but truly where Gentry come and ſpend their Money, I am not willing that they ſhould be ſcandalized by a Set of poor ſhabby Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, that wherever they go, leave more Lice than Money bebind them; ſuch Folks never raiſe my Compaſſion: For to be certain, it is fooliſh to have any for them, and if our Juſtices did as they ought, they would be all whipt out of the Kingdom; for to be certain it is what is moſt fitting for them. But as for your Ladyſhip, I am heartily ſorry your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyſhip hath had a Misfortune, and if your Ladyſhip will do me the Honour to wear my Cloaths till you can get ſome of your Ladyſhip's own, to be certain the beſt I have is at your Ladyſhip's Service.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Whether Cold, Shame, or the Perſuaſions of Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> prevailed moſt with Mrs. <hi>Waters,</hi> I will not determine; but ſhe ſuffered herſelf to be pacified by this Speech of my Landlady, and retired with that good Woman, in order to apparel herſelf in a decent Manner.</p>
               <p>My Landlord was likewiſe beginning his Oration to <hi>Jones,</hi> but was preſently interrupted by that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Youth, who ſhook him heartily by the Hand; and aſſured him of entire Forgiveneſs, ſaying, <q rend="inline">'If you are ſatisfied, my worthy Friend, I promiſe you I am;'</q> and indeed in one Senſe the Landlord had the better Reaſon to be ſatisfied; for he had received a Bellyfull of Drubbing, whereas <hi>Jones</hi> had ſcarce felt a ſingle Blow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Partridge,</hi> who had been all this Time waſhing his bloody Noſe at the Pump, returned into the Kitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en at the Inſtant when his Maſter and the Landlord were ſhaking Hands with each other. As he was of a peaceable Diſpoſition, he was pleaſed with thoſe Symptoms of Reconciliation; and tho' his Face bore ſome Marks of <hi>Suſan</hi>'s Fiſt, and many more of her Nails, he rather choſe to be contented with his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune

               <p>The heroic <hi>Suſan</hi> was likewiſe well contented with her Victory, tho' it had coſt her a Black-Eye, which <hi>Partridge</hi> had given her at the firſt Onſet.

               <p>Matters were thus reſtored to a perfect Calm, at which the Serjeant, tho' it may ſeem ſo contrary to the Principles of his Profeſſion, teſtified his Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <q rend="inline">'Why now, that's friendly, ſaid he; D—n me, I hate to ſee two People bear Illwill to one another, after they have had a Tuſſel.

               <p>To ſay the Truth, as no known Inhabitant of this Globe is really more than Man, ſo none need be aſhamed of ſubmitting to what the Neceſſities of Man demand; but when thoſe great Perſonages I have juſt mentioned, condeſcend to aim at confining ſuch low Offices to themſelves; as when by hoarding or deſtroying, they ſeem deſirous to prevent any others from eating, they then ſurely become very low and deſpicable.</p>
               <p>Now after this ſhort Preface, we think it no Diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to our Heroe to mention the immoderate Ardour with which he laid about him at this Seaſon.

               <p>This Particular we thought ourſelves obliged to mention, as it may account for our Heroe's tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Neglect of his fair Companion; who eat but very little, and was indeed employed in conſiderations of a very different Nature, which paſſed unobſerved by <hi>Jones,</hi> till he had entirely ſatisfied that Appetite which a Faſt of twenty-four Hours had procured him; but

               <p>It was, perhaps, as much owing to this, as to a very fine Complection, that his Face had a Delicacy in it almoſt inexpreſſible, and which might have given him an Air rather too effeminate, had it not been joined to a moſt maſculine Perſon and Mein; which latter had as much in them of the <hi>Hercules,</hi> as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer had of the <hi>Adonis.</hi> He was beſides active, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel, gay and good humoured, and had a Flow o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He ſtarted therefore from his Seat, and advancing to the Serjeant, ſwore he looked on himſelf to be as good a Man as any in the Army, and offered to box for a Guinea. The military Man accepted the Combat but refuſed the Wager; upon which both immediately ſtript and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, till the Driver of Horſes was ſo well mauled by the Leader of Men, that he was obliged to exhauſt his ſmall Remainder of Breath in begging for Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>The young Lady was now deſirous to depart, and had given Orders for her Coach to be prepared; but all in vain; for the Coachman was diſabled from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming his Office for that Evening. An antient Heathen would perhaps have imputed this Diſability to the God of Drink, no leſs than to the God of War; for, in Reality, both the Combatants had ſacrificed as well to the former Deity as to the latter. To ſpeak plainly, they were both dead drunk, nor was <hi>Partridge</hi> in a much better Situation. As for my Landlord, drinking was his Trade, and the Liquor had no more Effect on him, than it had on any other Veſſel in his Houſe.</p>
               <p>The Miſtreſs of the Inn being ſummoned to attend Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> and his Companion, at their Tea, gave a full Relation of the latter Part of the foregoing Scene;
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0618300102:231"/>
and at the ſame Time expreſſed great Concern for the young Lady, 'who,' ſhe ſaid,' was under the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Uneaſineſs at being prevented from purſuing her Journey. <q rend="inline">'She is a ſweet pretty Creature,' added ſhe, 'and I am certain I have ſeen her Face before.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> fetched a hearty Sigh at thoſe Words; of which, tho' Mrs. <hi>Waters</hi> obſerved it, ſhe took no Notice while the Landlady continued in the Room; but after the Departure of that good Woman, ſhe could not forbear giving our Heroe certain Hints of her ſuſpecting ſome very dangerous Rival in his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. The aukward Behaviour of Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> on this Occaſion convinced her of the Truth, without his giving her a direct Anſwer to any of her Queſtions; but ſhe was not nice enough in her Amours to be greatly concerned at the Diſcovery. The Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Jones</hi> highly charmed her Eye; but, as ſhe could not ſee his Heart, ſhe gave herſelf no concern about it. She could feaſt heartily at the Table of Love, without reflecting that ſome other already had been, or hereafter might be, feaſted with the ſame Repaſt. A Sentiment which, if it deals but little in Refinement, deals however much in Subſtance; and is leſs capricious, and perhaps leſs ill-natured and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh than the Deſires of thoſe Females who can be contented enough to abſtain from the Poſſeſſion of their Lovers, provided they are ſufficiently ſatisfied that no one elſe poſſeſſes them.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>Containing a fuller Account of Mrs.</hi> Waters, <hi>and by what Means ſhe came into that diſtreſsful Situation from which ſhe was reſcued by</hi> Jones.</head>
               <p>THOUGH Nature hath by no Means mixed up an equal Share either of Curioſity or Vanity in every human Compoſition, there is perhaps no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual to whom ſhe hath not allotted ſuch a Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of both, as requires much Art and Pains too, to ſubdue and keep under. A Conqueſt, however, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to every one who would in any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree deſerve the Characters of Wiſdom or Good-Breeding.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Jones</hi> therefore might very juſtly be called a well-bred Man, he had ſtifled all that Curioſity which the extraordinary Manner in which he had found Mrs. <hi>Waters,</hi> muſt be ſuppoſed to have occaſioned. He had indeed at firſt thrown out ſome few Hints to the Lady; but when he perceived her induſtriouſly avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Explanation, he was contented to remain in Ignorance, the rather as he was not without Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, that there were ſome Circumſtances which muſt have raiſed her Bluſhes, had ſhe related the whole Truth.</p>
               <p>Now, ſince it is poſſible that ſome of our Readers may not ſo eaſily acquieſce under the ſame Ignorance, and as we are very deſirous to ſatisfy them all, we have taken uncommon Pains to inform ourſelves of the real Fact, with the Relation of which we ſhall conclude this Book.</p>
               <p>This Lady then had lived ſome Years with one Captain <hi>Waters,</hi> who was a Captain in the ſame Regiment to which Mr. <hi>Northerton</hi> belonged. She paſt for that Gentleman's Wife, and went by his Name; and yet, as the Serjeant ſaid, there were
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0618300102:233"/>
ſome Doubts concerning the Reality of their Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, which we ſhall not at preſent take upon us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Waters,</hi> I am ſorry to ſay it, had for ſome Time contracted an Intimacy with the above mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Enſign, which did no great Credit to her Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That ſhe had a remakable Fondneſs for that young Fellow is moſt certain; but whether ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged this to any very criminal Lengths, is not ſo extremely clear, unleſs we will ſuppoſe that Women never grant every Favour to a Man but one, without granting him that one alſo.</p>
               <p>The Diviſion of the Regiment to which Captain <hi>Waters</hi> belonged, had two Days preceded the March of that Company to which Mr. <hi>Northerton</hi> was the Enſign; ſo that the former had reached <hi>Worceſter,</hi> the very Day after the unfortunate Rencounter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Jones</hi> and <hi>Northerton,</hi> which we have before recorded.</p>
               <p>Now it had been agreed between Mrs. <hi>Waters</hi> and the Captain, that ſhe ſhould accompany him in his March as far as <hi>Worceſter,</hi> where they were to take their Leave of each other, and ſhe was thence to return to <hi>Bath,</hi> where ſhe was to ſtay till the End of the Winter's Campaign againſt the Rebels.</p>
               <p>With this Agreement Mr. <hi>Northerton</hi> was made acquainted. To ſay the Truth, the Lady had made him an Aſſignation at this very Place, and promiſed to ſtay at <hi>Worceſter</hi> till his Diviſion came thither; with what View, and for that Purpoſe muſt be left to the Reader's Divination: For though we are obliged to relate Facts, we are not obliged to do a Violence to our Nature by any Comments to the Diſadvantage of the lovelieſt Part of the Creation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Northerton</hi> no ſooner obtained a Releaſe from his Captivity, as we have ſeen, than he haſted away to overtake Mrs. <hi>Waters;</hi> which, as he was a very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0618300102:234"/>
nimble Fellow, he did at the laſt mentioned City, ſome few Hours after Captain <hi>Waters</hi> had left her: At his firſt Arrival he made no ſcruple of acquainting her with the unfortunate Accident, which he made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear very unfortunate indeed: For he totally extracted every Particle of what could be called Fault, at leaſt in a Court of Honour, though he left ſome Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which might be queſtionable in a Court of Law.</p>
               <p>Women, to their Glory be it ſpoken, are more generally capable of that violent and apparently diſinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted Paſſion of Love, which ſeeks only the Good of its Object, than Men. Mrs. <hi>Waters,</hi> therefore, was no ſooner apprized of the Danger to which her Lover was expoſed, than ſhe loſt every Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion beſides that of his Safety; and this being a Matter equally agreeable to the Gentleman, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the immediate Subject of Debate between them.</p>
               <p>After much Conſultation on this Matter, it was at length agreed, that the Enſign ſhould go a-croſs the Country to <hi>Hereford,</hi> whence he might find ſome Conveyance to one of the Sea-Ports in <hi>Wales,</hi> and thence might make his Eſcape abroad. In all which Expedition Mrs. <hi>Waters</hi> declared ſhe would bear him Company; and for which ſhe was able to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him with Money, a very material Article to Mr. <hi>Northerton,</hi> ſhe having then in her Pocket three Bank Notes to the Amount of <hi>90l.</hi> beſides ſome Caſh, and a Diamond Ring of pretty conſiderable Value on her Finger. All which ſhe, with the utmoſt Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, revealed to this wicked Man, little ſuſpecting ſhe ſhould by theſe Means inſpire him with a Deſign of robbing her. Now as they muſt, by taking Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes from <hi>Worceſter,</hi> have furniſhed any Purſuers with the Means of hereafter diſcovering their Rout, the Enſign propoſed, and the Lady preſently agreed to make their firſt Stage on Foot; for which Purpoſe the Hardneſs of the Froſt was very ſeaſonable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:0618300102:235"/>
The main Part of the Lady's Baggage was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready at <hi>Bath,</hi> and ſhe had nothing with her at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent beſides a very ſmall Quantity of Linnen, which the Gallant undertook to carry in his own Pockets. All Things, therefore, being ſettled in the Evening, they aroſe early the next Morning, and at Five o'Clock departed from <hi>Worceſter,</hi> it being then above two Hours before Day. But the Moon which was then at the full, gave them all the Light ſhe was capable of affording.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Waters</hi> was not of that delicate Race of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who are obliged to the Invention of Vehicles for the Capacity of removing themſelves from one Place to another, and with whom conſequently a Coach is reckoned among the Neceſſaries of Life. Her Limbs were indeed full of Strength and Agility, and as her Mind was no leſs animated with Spirit, ſhe was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly able to keep Pace with her nimble Lover.</p>
               <p>Having travelled on for ſome Miles in a High Road, which <hi>Northerton</hi> ſaid he was informed led to <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> they came at the Break of Day to the Side of a large Wood, where he ſuddenly ſtopped, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting to meditate a Moment with himſelf, expreſſed ſome Apprehenſions from travelling any longer in ſo public a Way. Upon which he eaſily perſuaded his fair Companion to ſtrike with him into a Path which ſeemed to lead directly through the Wood, and which at length brought them both to the Bottom of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard-Hill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whether the execrable Scheme which he now at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to execute, was the Effect of previous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, or whether it now firſt came into his Head, I cannot determine. But being arrived in this lone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Place, where it was very improbable he ſhould meet with any Interruption; he ſuddenly ſlipped his Garter from his Leg, and laying violent Hands on the poor Woman, endeavoured to perpetrate that
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0618300102:236"/>
dreadful and deteſtable Fact, which we have before commemorated, and which the providential Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of <hi>Jones</hi> did ſo fortunately prevent.</p>
               <p>Happy was it for Mrs. <hi>Waters,</hi> that ſhe was not of the weakeſt Order of Females; for no ſooner did ſhe perceive by his tying a Knot in his Garter, and by his Declarations, what his Helliſh Intentions were, than ſhe ſtood ſtoutly to her Defence, and ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtruggled with her Enemy, ſcreaming all the while for Aſſiſtance, that ſhe delayed the Execution of the Villain's Purpoſe ſeveral Minutes, by which Means Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> came to her Relief, at that very Inſtant when her Strength failed, and ſhe was totally over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered, and delivered her from the Ruffian's Hands, with no other Loſs than that of her Cloaths, which were torn from her Back, and of the Diamond Ring, which during the Contention either dropped from her Finger, or was wrenched from it by <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, Reader, we have given thee the Fruits of a very painful Enquiry, which for thy Satisfaction we have made into this Matter. And here we have open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to thee a Scene of Folly, as well as Villainy, which we could ſcarce have believed a human Creature ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being guilty of; had we not remembered that this Fellow was at that Time firmly perſuaded, that he had already committed a Murther, and had forfeited his Life to the Law. As he concluded therefore that his only Safety lay in Flight, he thought the poſſeſſing himſelf of this poor Woman's Money and Ring would make him Amends for the additional Burthen he was to lay on his Conſcience.</p>
               <p>And here, Reader, we muſt ſtrictly caution thee, that thou doſt not take any Occaſion from the Miſbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of ſuch a Wretch as this, to reflect on ſo worthy and honourable a Body of Men, as are the Officers of our Army in general. Thou wilt be
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0618300102:237"/>
pleaſed to conſider, that this Fellow, as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready informed thee, had neither the Birth nor Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a Gentleman, nor was a proper Perſon to be enrolled among the Number of ſuch. If therefore his Baſeneſs can juſtly reflect on any beſides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, it muſt be only on thoſe who gave him his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Containing Inſtructions very neceſſary to be peruſed by modern Critics.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>READER, it is impoſſible we ſhould know what Sort of Perſon thou wilt be: For, perhaps, thou may'ſt be as learned in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature as <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> himſelf was, and, perhaps, thou may'ſt be no wiſer than ſome of his Editors. Now, leſt this latter ſhould be the Caſe, we think proper, before we go any farther together, to give thee a few wholeſome Admonitions; that thou may'ſt not as groſly miſunderſtand and miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent us, as ſome of the ſaid Editors have miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood and miſrepreſented their Author.</p>
               <p>Firſt, then, we warn the not too haſtily to condemn any of the Incidents in this our Hiſtory, as imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0618300102:239"/>
and foreign to our main Deſign, becauſe thou doſt not immediately conceive in what Manner ſuch Incident may conduce to that Deſign. This Work may, indeed, be conſidered as a great Creation of our own; and for a little Reptile of a Critic to preſume to find Fault with any of its Parts, without knowing the Manner in which the Whole is connected, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he comes to the final Cataſtrophe, is a moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous Abſurdity. The Alluſion and Metaphor we have here made uſe of, we muſt acknowledge to be infinitely too great for our Occaſion, but there is, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, no other, which is at all adequate to expreſs the Difference between an Author of the firſt Rate and a Critic of the loweſt.</p>
               <p>Another Caution we muſt give thee, my good Rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, is, that thou doſt not find out too near a Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance between certain Characters here introduced; as for inſtance, between the Landlady who appears in the Seventh Book, and her in the Ninth. Thou art to know, Friend, that there are certain Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſtics, in which moſt Individuals of every Profeſſion and Occupation agree. To be able to preſerve theſe Characteriſtics, and at the ſame Time to diverſity their Operations, is one Talent of a good Writer. Again, to mark the nice Diſtinction between two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons actuated by the ſame Vice or Folly is another; and as this laſt Talent is found in very few Writers, ſo is the true Diſcernment of it found in as few Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; though, I believe the Obſervation of this forms a very principal Pleaſure in thoſe who are capable of the Diſcovery: Every Perſon, for Inſtance, can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh between Sir <hi>Epicure Mammon,</hi> and Sir <hi>Fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Flutter;</hi> but to know the Difference between Sir <hi>Fopling Flutter</hi> and Sir <hi>Courtly Nice,</hi> requires a more exquiſite Judgment: For want of which, vulgar Spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators of Plays very often do great Injuſtice in the Theatre; where I have ſometimes known a Poet in Danger of being convicted as a Thief, upon much
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0618300102:240"/>
worſe Evidence than the Reſemblance of Hands hath been held to be in the Law. In reality, I apprehend every amorous Widow on the Stage would run the Hazard of being condemned as a ſervile Imitation of <hi>Dido,</hi> but that happily very few of our Play-houſe Critics underſtand enough of <hi>Latin</hi> to read <hi>Virgil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place, we muſt admoniſh thee, my wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Friend, (for perhaps, thy Heart may be better than thy Head) not to condemn a Character as a bad one, becauſe it is not perfectly a good one. If thou doſt delight in theſe models of Perfection, there are Books enow written to gratify thy Taſte; but as we have not, in the Courſe of our Converſation, ever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to meet with any ſuch Perſon, we have not cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to introduce any ſuch here. To ſay the Truth, I a little queſtion whether mere Man ever arrived at this conſummate Degree of Excellence, as well as whether there hath ever exiſted a Monſter bad enough to veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy that</p>

               <p>in <hi>Juvenal:</hi> Nor do I, indeed, conceive the good Purpoſes ſerved by inſerting Characters of ſuch an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelic Perfection, or ſuch diabolical Depravity, in any Work of Invention: Since from contemplating ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Mind of Man is more likely to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with Sorrow and Shame, than to draw any good Uſes from ſuch Patterns; for in the former In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance he may be both concerned and aſhamed to ſee a Pattern of Excellence, in his Nature, which he may reaſonably deſpair of ever arriving at; and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating the latter, he may be no leſs affected with thoſe uneaſy Senſations, at ſeeing the Nature, of which he is a Partaker, degraded into ſo odious and deteſtable a Creature.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:0618300102:241"/>
In Fact, if there be enough of Goodneſs in a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter to engage the Admiration and Affection of a well-diſpoſed Mind, though there ſhould appear ſome of thoſe little Blemiſhes, <hi>quas humana parum cavit na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura,</hi> they will raiſe our Compaſſion rather than our Abhorrence. Indeed, nothing can be of more moral Uſe than the Imperfections which are ſeen in Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of this Kind; ſince ſuch form a Kind of Surprize, more apt to affect and dwell upon our Minds, than the Faults of very vicious and wicked Perſons. The Foibles and Vices of Men, in whom there is great Mixture of Good, become more glaring Objects, from the Virtues which contraſt them, and which ſhew their Deformity; and when we find ſuch Vices at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with their evil Conſequence to our favourite Characters, we are not only taught to ſhun them for our own Sake, but to hate them for the Miſchiefs they have already brought on thoſe we love.</p>
               <p>And now, my Friend, having given you theſe few Admonitions, we will, if you pleaſe, once more ſet forward with our Hiſtory.</p>

               <p>NOW the little trembling Hare, whom the Dread of all her numerous Enemies, and chiefly of that cunning, cruel, carnivorous Animal Man, had confined all the Day to her Lurking-place, ſports wantonly o'er the Lawns: Now on ſome hollow Tree the Owl, ſhrill Choriſter of the Night, hoots forth Notes which might Charm the Ears of ſome modern Conoiſſeurs in Muſic: Now in the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the half-drunk Clown, as he ſtaggars through the Church-yard, or rather Charnal-yard, to his

Home, Fear paints the bloody Hobgoblin: Now Thieves and Ruffians are awake, and honeſt Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men faſt aſleep: In plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> it was now Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night; and the Company at the Inn, as well thoſe who have been already mentioned in this Hiſtory, as ſome others who arrived in the Evening, were all in Bed. <hi>Suſan</hi> Chambermaid, was now only ſtirring, ſhe being obliged to waſh the Kitchen, before ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to the Arms of the fond, expecting Oſtler.</p>
               <p>In this Poſture were Affairs at the Inn, when a Gentleman arrived there Poſt. He immediately a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted from his Horſe, and coming up to <hi>Suſan,</hi> enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of her in a very abrupt and confuſed Manner, being almoſt out of Breath with Eagerneſs, whether there was any Lady in the Houſe. The Hour of Night, and the Behaviour of the Man, who ſtared very wildly all the Time, a little ſurprized <hi>Suſan,</hi> ſo that ſhe he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated before ſhe made any Anſwer: Upon which the Gentleman, with redoubled Eagerneſs, begg'd her to give him a true Information, ſaying, he had loſt his 'Wife, and was come in Purſuit of her. <q rend="inline">'Upon my Shoul,' cries he, 'I have been near catching her already in two or three Places, if I had not found her gone juſt as I came up with her.'</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Suſan,</hi> from the Account ſhe had received of Mrs. <hi>Waters,</hi> made not the leaſt Doubt but that ſhe was the very identical Stray whom the right owner purſued. As ſhe concluded, therefore, with great Appearance of Reaſon, that ſhe never could get Money in an honeſter

Way than by reſtoring a Wife to her Huſband, ſhe made no Scruple of aſſuring the Gentleman, that the Lady he wanted was then in the Houſe, and was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently afterward prevailed upon (by very liberal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and ſome Earneſt paid into her Hands) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct him to the Bed-chamber of Mrs. <hi>Waters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It hath been a Cuſtom long eſtabliſhed in the polite World, and that upon very ſolid and ſubſtantial Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that a Huſband ſhall never enter his Wife's A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment without firſt knocking at the Door. The many excellent Uſes of this Cuſtom need ſcarce be hinted to a Reader who hath any Knowledge of the World: For by this Means the Lady hath Time to adjuſt herſelf, or to remove any diſagreeable Object out of the Way; for there are ſome Situations, in which nice and delicate Women would not be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by their Huſbands.</p>
               <p>To ſay the Truth, there are ſeveral Ceremonies inſtituted among the poliſhed Part of Mankind, which tho' they may, to coarſer Judgments, appear as Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of mere Form, are found to have much of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in them, by the more diſcerning; and lucky would it have been, had the Cuſtom abovementioned been obſerved by our Gentleman in the preſent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Knock, indeed, he did at the Door, but not with one of thoſe gentle Raps which is uſual on ſuch Occaſions. On the contrary, when he found the Door locked, he flew at it with ſuch Violence, that the Lock immediately gave Way, the Door burſt open, and he fell headlong into the Room.</p>
               <p>He had no ſooner recovered his Legs, than forth from the Bed, upon his Legs likewiſe appeared—with Shame and Sorrow are we obliged to proceed—our Heroe himſelf, who, with a menacing Voice, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of the Gentleman who he was, and what he meant by daring to burſt open his Chamber in that outrageous Manner.</p>

If I muſt eat my hard Fare here, Madam,'</q> cries ſhe to the Landlady, <q rend="inline">'I beg the Kitchen may be kept clear, that I may not be ſurrounded with all the Black-guards in Town; as for you, Sir,' ſays ſhe to <hi>Partridge,</hi> 'you look ſomewhat like a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, and may ſit ſtill if you pleaſe, I don't de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to diſturb any body but Mob.'</q>

               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'Yes, yes, Madam, cries <hi>Partridge,</hi> 'I am a Gentleman, I do aſſure you, and I am not ſo eaſily to be diſturbed. <hi>Non ſemper vox cauſalis eſt verbo nominativus.</hi>'</q> This <hi>Latin</hi> ſhe took to be ſome Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front, and anſwered, <q rend="inline">'You may be a Gentleman, Sir, but you don't ſhew yourſelf as one, to talk <hi>Latin</hi> to a Wonan.'</q> 
                  <hi>Partridge</hi> made a genteel Reply, and concluded with more <hi>Latin;</hi> upon which ſhe toſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up her Noſe, and contented herſelf by abuſing him with the Name of a great Scholar.</p>
               <p>The Supper being now on the Table, Mrs. <hi>Abigail</hi> eat very heartily, for ſo delicate a Perſon; and while a ſecond Courſe of the ſame was by her Order pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring, ſhe ſaid, <q rend="inline">'And ſo, Madam, you tell me your 'Houſe is frequented by People of great Quality.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Landlady anſwered in the Affirmative, ſaying, <q rend="inline">'There were a great many very good Quality and

               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'And pray who is this young Gentleman of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, this young Squire <hi>Allworthy?'</hi>
                  </q> ſaid <hi>Abigail.</hi>

               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'Who ſhould he be,' anſwered <hi>Partridge,</hi> 'but the Son and Heir of the great Squire <hi>Allworthy</hi> of <hi>Somerſetſhire.</hi>'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'Upon my Word,' ſaid ſhe, 'you tell me ſtrange News: For I know Mr. <hi>Allworthy</hi> of <hi>Somerſetſhire</hi> very well, and I know he hath no Son alive.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Landlady pricked up her Ears at this, and <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge</hi> looked a little confounded. However, after a ſhort Heſitatation, he anſwered, <q rend="inline">'Indeed, Madam, it is true, every body doth not know him to be Squire <hi>Allworthy</hi>'s Son; for he was never marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Mother; but his Son he certainly is, and will be his Heir too as certainly as his Name is <hi>Jones.</hi>'</q> At that Word, <hi>Abigail</hi> let drop the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, which ſhe was conveying to her Mouth, and cried out, <q rend="inline">'You ſurprize me, Sir. Is it poſſible Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> ſhould be now in the Houſe?'</q>
                  <q rend="inline">

               <p>
                  <hi>Abigail</hi> now made Haſte to finiſh the Remainder of her Meal, and then repaired back to her Miſtreſs, when the Converſation paſſed, which may be read in the next Chapter.</p>

While they were thus diſcourſing, Mrs. <hi>Honour</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, and diſcharged her Commiſſion, by bidding the Landlady immediately awake Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> and tell him a Lady wanted to ſpeak with him. The Landlady referr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Partridge,</hi> ſaying, <q rend="inline">'he was the Squire's Friend; but, for her Part, ſhe never called Men Folks, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Gentlemen,'</q> and then walked ſullenly out of the Kitchen. <hi>Honour</hi> applied herſelf to <hi>Partridge;</hi> but he refuſed; <q rend="inline">'For my Friend,' cries he, 'went to Bed very late, and he would be very angry to be diſturbed ſo ſoon.'</q> Mrs. <hi>Honour</hi> inſiſted ſtill to have him called, ſaying, <q rend="inline">'She was ſure, inſtead of being angry, that he would be to the higheſt Degree delighted when he knew the Occaſion.'</q>

She then ripped up the Story of <hi>Molly Seagrim,</hi> and gave the moſt malicious Turn to his formerly quitting <hi>Sophia</hi> herſelf; which, I muſt confeſs, the preſent Incident not a littl countenanced.</p>
               <p>The Spirits of <hi>Sophia</hi> were too much diſſipated by Concern to enable her to ſtop the Torrent of her

Maid. <q rend="inline">At laſt, however, ſhe interrupted her, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, 'I never can believe this; ſome Villain hath belied him. You ſay you had it from his Friend; but ſurely it is not the Office of a Friend to betray ſuch Secrets.'</q>

               </p>
               <p>To ſay the Truth, this Behaviour of <hi>Partridge</hi> was a little inexcuſable; but he had not ſlept off the Effect of the Doſe which he ſwallowed the Evening before; which had in the Morning, received the Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of about a Pint of Wine, or indeed rather of Malt Spirits; for the Perry was by no Means pure. Now that Part of his Head which Nature deſigned for the Reſervoir of Drink, being very ſhallow, a ſmall Quantity of Liquor overflowed it, and opened the Sluices of his Heart; ſo that all the Secrets there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited run out. Theſe Sluices were indeed naturally very ill ſecured. To give the beſt natured Turn we can to his diſpoſition, he was a very honeſt Man: for as he was the moſt inquiſitive of Mortals, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally prying into the Secrets of others, ſo he very faithfully paid them by communicating, in Return, every thing within his Knowledge.</p>
               <p>While <hi>Sophia</hi> tormented with Anxiety, knew not what to believe, nor what Reſolution to take, <hi>Suſan</hi> arrived with the Sack-Whey. Mrs. <hi>Honour</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately adviſed her Miſtreſs, in a Whiſper to pump this Wench, who probably could inform her of the Truth. <hi>Sophia</hi> approved it, and began as follows: <q rend="inline">'Come hither, Child, now anſwer me truly what I am going to aſk you, and I promiſe you I will very well reward you.

                  <hi>Suſan</hi> anſwered, <q rend="inline">'There was'—'Do you know any Thing of any Lady,'</q> continues <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia,</hi> 'any Lady?

                  <hi>Suſan,</hi> after a very ſhort Heſitation, took the Money, and told his whole Story, concluding with ſaying, <q rend="inline">'If you have a great Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity, Madam, I can ſteal ſoftly into the Room, and ſee whether he be in his own Bed or no.'</q> She ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly did this by <hi>Sophia</hi>'s Deſire, and returned with an Anſwer in the Negative.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sophia</hi> now trembled and turned pale.

               <p>IT was now paſt Five in the Morning, and other Company began to riſe and come to the Kitchen, among whom were the Serjeant and the Coachman, who being thoroughly reconciled, made a Libati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or, in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Phraſe, drank a hearty Cup together.</p>
               <p>In this Drinking nothing more remarkable happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than the Behaviour of <hi>Partridge,</hi> who, when the Serjeant drank a Health to King <hi>George,</hi> repeated only the Word King: Nor could he be brought to utter more: For tho' he was going to ſight againſt his own Cauſe, yet he could not be prevailed upon to drink againſt it.</p>

Kind, had he not imagined it altogether ſafe; for he was one of thoſe who have more conſideration of the Gallows than of the Fitneſs of Things; but in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, he thought he might have committed this Felony without any Danger: For, beſides that he doubted not but the Name of Mr. <hi>Allworthy</hi> would ſufficiently quiet the Landlord, he conceived they ſhould be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſafe, whatever Turn Affairs might take; as <hi>Jones,</hi> he imagined, would have Friends enough on one Side, and as his Friends would as well ſecure him on the other.</p>
               <p>When Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> found that <hi>Partridge</hi> was in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt in this Propoſal, he very ſeverely rebuked him, and that in ſuch bitter Terms that the other attempted to laugh it off, and preſently turned the Diſcourſe to other Matters, ſaying, he believed they were then in a Bawdy-houſe, and that he had with much ado pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented two Wenches from diſturbing his Honour in the middle of the Night. <q rend="inline">'Heyday!' ſays he, 'I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they got into your Chamber whether I would or no, for here lies the Muff of one of them on the Ground.'</q> Indeed, as <hi>Jones</hi> returned to his Bed in the Dark, he had never perceived the Muff on the Quilt, and in leaping into his Bed he had tumbled it on the Floor. This <hi>Partridge</hi> now took up, and was going to put into his Pocket, when <hi>Jones</hi> deſired to ſee it. The Muff was ſo very remarkable, that our Heroe might poſſibly have recollected it without the Information annexed. But his Memory was not put to that hard Office, for at the ſame Inſtant he ſaw and read the Words <hi>Sophia Weſtern</hi> upon the Paper which was pinned to it. His Looks now grew frantic in a Moment, and he eagerly cried out, <q rend="inline">'Oh Heavens, how came this Muff here!' 'I know no more than your Honour,' cried <hi>Partridge;</hi> 'but I ſaw it upon the Arm of one of the Women who would have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed you, if I would have ſuffered them.' 'Where are they?'</q> cries <hi>Jones,</hi> jumping out of Bed, and
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0618300102:267"/>
laying hold of his Clothes. <q rend="inline">'Many Miles off, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,' by this Time,'</q> ſaid <hi>Partridge.</hi> And now <hi>Jones,</hi> upon further Enquiry, was ſufficiently aſſured that the Bearer of this Muff was no other than the lovely <hi>Sophia</hi> herſelf.</p>
               <p>The Behaviour of <hi>Jones</hi> on this Occaſion. His Thoughts, his Looks, his Words, his Actions, were ſuch as <hi>Beggar all Deſcription.</hi> After many bitter Execrations on <hi>Partridge,</hi> and not fewer on himſelf, he ordered the poor Fellow, who was frightened out of his Wits, to run down and hire him Horſes at any rate; and a very few Minutes afterwards, having ſhuffled on his Clothes, he haſtened down Stairs to execute the Orders himſelf, which he had juſt before given.</p>
               <p>But before we proceed to what paſſed on his Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val in the Kitchen, it will be neceſſary to recur to what had there happened ſince <hi>Partridge</hi> had firſt left it on his Maſter's Summons.</p>
               <p>The Serjeant was juſt marched off with his Party when the two <hi>Iriſh</hi> Gentlemen aroſe and came down Stairs; both complaining, that they had been ſo often waked by the Noiſes in the Inn, that they had never once been able to cloſe their Eyes all Night.</p>
               <p>The Coach, which had brought the young Lady and her Maid, and which, perhaps, the Reader may have hitherto concluded was her own, was indeed a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned Coach belonging to Mr. <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Bath,</hi> one of the worthieſt and honeſteſt Men that ever dealt in Horſe-fleſh, and whoſe Coaches we heartily recom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mend to all our Readers who travel that Road. By which Means they may, perhaps, have the Pleaſure of riding in the very Coach, and being driven by the very Coachman, that is recorded in this Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>The Coachman having but two Paſſengers, and hearing Mr. <hi>Maclachlan</hi> was bound to <hi>Bath,</hi> offered to carry him thither at a very moderate Price. He was induced to this by the Report of the Oſtler, who

               <p>Mr. <hi>Weſtern</hi> now proceeded to ſearch the whole Houſe, but to as little Purpoſe as he had diſturbed poor Mrs. <hi>Waters.</hi> He then returned diſconſolate into the Kitchen, where he found <hi>Jones</hi> in the Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tody of his Servants.</p>
               <p>This violent Uproar had raiſed all the People in the Houſe; tho' it was yet ſcarcely Day-light. Among theſe was a grave Gentleman, who had the Honour to be in the Commiſſion of the Peace for the County of <hi>Worceſter.</hi> Of which Mr. <hi>Weſtern</hi> was no ſooner informed, than he offered to lay his Complaint be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. The Juſtice declined executing his Office, as he ſaid he had no Clerk preſent, nor no Book about Juſtice Buſineſs. And that he could not carry all the Law in his Head about ſtealing away Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and ſuch Sort of Things.</p>
               <p>Here Mr. <hi>Fitzpatrick</hi> offered to lend him his Aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; informing the Company that he had been him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf bred to the Law. (And indeed he had ſerved three Years as Clerk to an Attorney in the North of <hi>Ireland,</hi> when chuſing a genteeler Walk in Life, he quitted his Maſter, came over to <hi>England,</hi> and ſet up that Buſineſs, which requires no Apprenticeſhip, namely, that of a Gentleman, in which he had ſucceeded as hath been already partly mentioned.)</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Fitzpatrick</hi> declared that the Law concerning Daughters was out of the preſent Caſe; that ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Muff was undoubtedly Felony, and the Goods being found upon the Perſon, were ſufficient Evidence of the Fact.</p>
               <p>The Magiſtrate, upon the Encouragement of ſo learned a Coadjutor, and upon the violent Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Squire, was at length prevailed upon to ſeat himſelf in the Chair of Juſtice, where being placed, upon viewing the Muff which <hi>Jones</hi> ſtill held

who now ſoftly ſtole down Stairs, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unbarred and unlocked one of the Houſe Doors, ſallied forth, and haſtened to the Place of Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the many pretty Arts, which La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſometimes practiſe, to diſplay their Fears on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little Occaſion, (almoſt as many as the other Sex uſes to conceal theirs) certainly there is a Degree of Courage, which not only becomes a Woman, but is often neceſſary to enable her to diſcharge her Duty. It is, indeed, the Idea of Fierceneſs, and not of Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, which deſtroys the Female Character: For who can read the Story of the juſtly celebrated <hi>Arria,</hi> without conceiving as high an Opinion of her Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Tenderneſs, as of her Fortitude? At the ſame Time, perhaps, many a Woman who ſhrieks at a Mouſe, or a Rat, may be capable of poiſoning a Huſband; or, what is worſe, of driving him to poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sophia,</hi> with all the Gentleneſs which a Woman can have, had all the Spirit which ſhe ought to have. When, therefore, ſhe came to the Place of Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and inſtead of meeting her Maid, as was agreed, ſaw a Man ride directly up to her, ſhe neither ſcream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, nor fainted away: Not that her Pulſe then beat with its uſual Regularity; for ſhe was at firſt, under ſome Surprize and Apprehenſion: But theſe were relieved almoſt as ſoon as raiſed, when the Man pulling off his Hat, aſked her, in a very ſubmiſſive Manner, <q rend="inline">'If her Ladyſhip did not expect to meet another Lady?'

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sophia</hi> could have no poſſible ſuſpicion of any Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in this Account: She therefore mounted reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely behind the Fellow, who conveyed her ſafe to a Town about Five Miles diſtant, where ſhe had the Satisfaction of finding the good Mrs. <hi>Honour:</hi> For as the Soul of the Waiting-woman was wrapt up in
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0618300102:281"/>
thoſe very Habiliments which uſed to enwrap her Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſhe could by no Means bring herſelf to truſt them out of her Sight. Upon theſe, therefore, ſhe kept Guard in Perſon, while ſhe detached the aforeſaid Fellow after her Miſtreſs, having given him all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Inſtructions.</p>
               <p>They now debated what Courſe to take, in order to avoid the Purſuit of Mr. <hi>Weſtern,</hi> who, they knew, would ſend after them in a few Hours. The <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> Road had ſuch Charms for <hi>Honour,</hi> that ſhe was deſirous of going on directly; alledging, that as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia</hi> could not be miſſed till Eight or Nine the next Morning, her Purſuers would not be able to overtake her, even though they knew which Way ſhe had gone. But <hi>Sophia</hi> had too much at Stake to venture any Thing to Chance; nor did ſhe dare to truſt too much to her tender Limbs, in a Conteſt which was to be decided only by Swiftneſs. She reſolved therefore, to travel acroſs the Country, for at leaſt Twenty or Thirty Miles, and then to take the direct Road to <hi>London.</hi> So having hired her Horſes to go Twenty Miles one Way, when ſhe intended to go Twenty Miles the other, ſhe ſet forward with the ſame Guide, behind whom ſhe had ridden from her Father's Houſe; the Guide having now taken up behind him, in the Room of <hi>Sophia,</hi> a much heavier, as well as much leſs lovely Burthen; being, indeed, a huge Portman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau, well ſtuffed with thoſe outſide Ornaments, by Means of which the fair <hi>Honour</hi> hoped to gain many Conqueſts, and, finally, to make her Fortune in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> City.</p>
               <p>When they had gone about Two hundred Paces from the Inn, on the <hi>London</hi> Road, <hi>Sophia</hi> rode up to the Guide, and, with a Voice much fuller of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney than was ever that of <hi>Anacreon,</hi> though his Mouth is ſuppoſed to have been a Bee-hive, begged him to take the firſt Turning which led towards <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol.</hi>

Reader, I am not ſuperſtitious, nor any great Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever in modern Miracles. I do not therefore, deliver the following as a certain Truth; for, indeed, I can ſcarce credit it myſelf: But the Fidelity of an Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an obliges me to relate what hath been confidently aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted. The Horſe, then, on which the Guide rode, is reported to have been ſo charmed by <hi>Sophia</hi>'s Voice, that he made a full Stop, and expreſt an Unwillingneſs to proceed any farther.</p>
               <p>Perhaps, however, the Fact may be true, and leſs miraculous then it hath been repreſented; ſince the natural Cauſe ſeems adequate to the Effect: For as the Guide at that Moment deſiſted from a conſtant Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his armed right Heel, (for, like <hi>Hudibras,</hi> he wore but one Spur) it is more than poſſible, that this Omiſſion alone might occaſion the Beaſt to ſtop, eſpecially as this was very frequent with him at other Times.</p>
               <p>But if the Voice of <hi>Sophia</hi> had really an Effect on the Horſe; it had very little on the Rider. He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſomewhat ſurlily, <q rend="inline">'That Meaſter had ordered him to go a different Way, and that he ſhould loſe his Place, if he went any other than that he was ordered.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sophia</hi> finding all her Perſuaſions had no Effect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan now to add irreſiſtible Charms to her Voice; Charms, which according to the Proverb, makes the old Mare trot, inſtead of ſtanding ſtill; Charms! to which modern Ages have attributed all that irreſiſtible Force, which the Ancients imputed to perfect Oratory. In a Word, ſhe promiſed ſhe would reward him to his utmoſt Expectation.</p>
               <p>The Lad was not totally deaf to theſe Promiſes; but he diſliked their being indefinite: For tho' perhaps he had never heard that Word, yet that in Fact was his Objection. <q rend="inline">'He ſaid, Gentlevolks did not conſider the Caſe of poor Volks; that he had like to have been turned away the other Day, for riding about the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try

with a Gentleman from Squire <hi>Allworthy</hi>'s, who; did not reward him as he ſhould have done.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'With whom? ſays <hi>Sophia</hi> eagerly—With a Gentleman from Squire <hi>Allworthy</hi>'s, repeated the Lad, 'the Squire's Son, I think, they call 'un.'—'Whither? which Way did he go? ſays <hi>Sophia.</hi> Why a little o' one Side o' <hi>Briſtol,</hi> about twenty Miles off,'</q> anſwered the Lad.—Guide me,' ſays <hi>Sophia</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">'to the ſame Place, and I'll give thee a Guinea, or two, if one is not ſufficient.' 'To be certain, ſaid the Boy, it is honeſtly worth two, when your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyſhip conſiders what a Risk I run; but, however, if your Ladyſhip will promiſe me the two Guineas, I'll e'en venture: To be certain it is a ſinful Thing to ride about my Maſter's Horſes; but one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is, I can only be turned away, and two Guineas will partly make me Amends.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Bargain being thus ſtruck, the Lad turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide into the <hi>Briſtol</hi> Road, and <hi>Sophia</hi> ſet forward in Purſuit of <hi>Jones,</hi> highly contrary to the Remonſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Mrs. <hi>Honour,</hi> who had much more Deſire to ſee <hi>London,</hi> than to ſee Mr. <hi>Jones:</hi> For indeed ſhe was not his Friend with her Miſtreſs, as he had been guilty of ſome Neglect in certain pecuniary Civilities, which are by Cuſtom due to the Waiting-gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in all Love Affairs, and more eſpecially in thoſe of a clandeſtine Kind. This we impute rather to the Careleſſneſs of his Temper, than to any Want of Generoſity; but perhaps ſhe derived it from the latter Motive. Certain it is that ſhe hated him very bitterly on that Account, and reſolved to take every Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of injuring him with her Miſtreſs. It was therefore highly unlucky for her, that ſhe had gone to the very ſame Town and Inn whence <hi>Jones</hi> had ſtarted and ſtill more unlucky was ſhe, in having ſtumbled on the ſame Guide, and on this accidental Diſcovery which <hi>Sophia</hi> had made.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="275" facs="tcp:0618300102:284"/>
Our Travellers arrived at <hi>Hambrook</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">This was the Village where <hi>Jones</hi> met the Quaker.</note> at the Break of Day, where <hi>Honour</hi> was againſt her Will charged to enquire the Rout which Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> had taken. Of this, indeed, the Guide himſelf could have informed them; but <hi>Sophia,</hi> I know not for what Reaſon, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver aſked him the Queſtion.</p>
               <p>When Mrs. <hi>Honour</hi> had made her Report from the Landlord, <hi>Sophia,</hi> with much Difficulty, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured ſome indifferent Horſes, which brought her to the Inn, where <hi>Jones</hi> had been confined rather by the Misfortune of meeting with a Surgeon, than by hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing met with a broken Head.</p>
               <p>Here <hi>Honour</hi> being again charged with a Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Enquiry, had no ſooner applied herſelf to the Landlady, and had deſcribed the Perſon of Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> than that ſagacious Woman began, in the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Phraſe, to ſmell a Rat. When <hi>Sophia</hi> therefore entered the Room, inſtead of anſwering the Maid, the Landlady addreſſing herſelf to the Miſtreſs, began the following Speech. <q rend="inline">'Good-lack-a-day! why there now, who would have thought it! I proteſt the lovelieſt Couple that ever Eyes beheld. I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fackins, Madam, it is no Wonder the Squire run on ſo about your Ladyſhip. He told me indeed you was the fineſt Lady in the World, and to be ſure ſo you be. Mercy on him, poor Heart, I bepitied him; ſo I did, when he uſed to hug his Pillow, and call it his dear Madam <hi>Sophia.—</hi>I did all I could to diſſuade himſelf from going to the Wars; I told him there were Men enow that were good for nothing elſe but to be killed, that had not the Love of ſuch fine Ladies.'</q>

                  <q rend="inline">What ſaucy Fellow," cries <hi>Honour,</hi> 'told you any Thing of my Lady?"</q>
                  <pb n="276" facs="tcp:0618300102:285"/>
                  <q rend="inline">No ſaucy Fellow,' anſwered the Landlady, 'but the young Gentleman you enquire after, and a very pretty young Gentleman he is, and he loves Madam <hi>Sophia Weſtern</hi> to the Bottom of his Soul.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'He love my Lady! I'd have you to know, Woman,' ſhe is Meat for his Maſter.</q>—<q rend="inline">'Nay, <hi>Honour,'</hi> ſaid <hi>Sophia,</hi> interrupting her, 'don't be angry with the good Woman, ſhe intends no Harm.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'No, marry don't I,'</q> anſwered the Landlady, embol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened by the ſoft Accents of <hi>Sophia,</hi> and then launch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a long Narrative too tedious to be here ſet down, in which ſome Paſſages dropt, that gave a little Offence to <hi>Sophia,</hi> and much more to her Waiting-woman, who hence took Occaſion to abuſe poor <hi>Jones</hi> to her Miſtreſs the Moment they were alone together, ſaying, <q rend="inline">'that he muſt be a pitiful Fellow, and could have no Love for a Lady, whoſe Name he would thus proſtitute in an Ale-houſe.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sophia</hi> did not ſee his Behaviour in ſo very diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous a Light, and was perhaps more pleaſed with the violent Raptures of his Love (which the Landlady exaggrated as much as ſhe had done every other Circumſtance) than ſhe was offended with the reſt; and indeed ſhe imputed the whole to the Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, or rather Ebullience of his Paſſion, and to the Openneſs of his Heart.</p>
               <p>This Incident, however, being afterward revived in her Mind, and placed in the moſt odious Colours by <hi>Honour,</hi> ſerved to heighten and give Credit to thoſe unlucky Occurrences at <hi>Upton,</hi> and aſſiſted the Wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-woman in her Endeavours to make her Miſtreſs depart from that Inn without ſeeing <hi>Jones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Landlady finding <hi>Sophia</hi> intended to ſtay no longer than till her Horſes were ready, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either eating or drinking, ſoon withdrew; when <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> began to take her Miſtreſs to Taſk (for indeed ſhe uſed great Freedom) and after a long Harangue, in which ſhe reminded her of her Intention to go to
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0618300102:286"/>
                  <hi>London,</hi> and gave frequent Hints of the Impropriety of purſuing a young Fellow, ſhe at laſt concluded with this ſerious Exhortation: <q rend="inline">'For Heaven's Sake, Madam, conſider what you are about, and whither you are a going.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>This Advice to a Lady who had already rode near forty Miles, and in no very agreeable Seaſon, may ſeem fooliſh enough. It may be ſuppoſed ſhe had well conſidered and reſolved this already; nay, Mrs. <hi>Honour,</hi> by the Hints ſhe threw out, ſeemed to think ſo; and this I doubt not is the Opinion of many Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, who have, I make no Doubt, been long ſince well convinced of the Purpoſe of our Heroine, and have heartily condemned her for it as a wanton Baggage.</p>
               <p>But in reality this was not the Caſe. <hi>Sophia</hi> had been lately ſo diſtracted between Hope and Fear, her Duty and Love to her Father her Hatred to <hi>Blifil,</hi> her Compaſſion, and (why ſhould we not confeſs the Truth) her Love for <hi>Jones;</hi> which laſt the Behaviour of her Father, of her Aunt, of every one elſe, and more particularly of <hi>Jones</hi> himſelf, had blown into a Flame, that her Mind was in that confuſed State, which may be truly ſaid to make us ignorant of what we do, or whither we go, or rather indeed indifferent as to the Conſequence of either.</p>
               <p>The prudent and ſage Advice of her Maid, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, however, ſome cool Reflection; and ſhe at length determined to go to <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> and thence to proceed directly to <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But unluckily, a few Miles before ſhe entered that Town, ſhe met the Hack-Attorney, who, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forementioned, had dined there with Mr. <hi>Jones.</hi> This Fellow being well known to Mrs. <hi>Honour,</hi> ſtopt and ſpoke to her; of which <hi>Sophia</hi> at that Time took little Notice, more than to enquire who he was.</p>
               <p>But having had a more particular Account from <hi>Honour</hi> of this Man afterwards at <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the great Expedition he uſually made in travelling,

for which (as hath been before obſerved) he was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly famous; recollecting likewiſe, that ſhe had overheard Mrs. <hi>Honour</hi> inform him, that they were going to <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> ſhe began to fear leſt her Father might, by this Fellow's Means, be able to trace her to that City; wherefore if ſhe ſhould there ſtrike into the <hi>London</hi> Road, ſhe apprehended he would certainly b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <head>CHAP. I. <hi>a Cruſt for the Critics.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN our laſt initial Chapter, we may be ſuppoſed to have treated that formidable Set of Men, who are called Critics, with more Freedom than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes us; ſince they exact, and indeed gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally receive, great Condeſcention from Authors. We ſhall in this, therefore, give the Reaſons of our Conduct to this auguſt Body; and here we ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps place them in a Light, in which they have not hitherto been ſeen.</p>
               <p>This Word Critic is of <hi>Greek</hi> Derivation, and ſignifies Judgment. Hence I preſume ſome Perſons who have not underſtood the Original, and have ſeen the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlation of the Primative, have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that it meant Judgment in the legal Senſe,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0618300102:289"/>
in which it is frequently uſed as equivalent to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</p>
               <p>I am the rather inclined to be of that Opinion as the greateſt Number of Critics hath of late Year been found amongſt the Lawyers. Many of theſe Gentlemen, from Deſpair, perhaps, of ever riſing to the Bench in <hi>Weſtminſter-hall,</hi> have placed them ſelves on the Benches at the Playhouſes, where they have exerted their judicial Capacity, and have given Judgment, <hi>i. e.</hi> condemned without Mercy.</p>
               <p>The Gentlemen would perhaps be well enough pleaſed, if we were to leave them thus compared to one of the moſt important and honourable Offices in the Commonwealth, and if we intended to apply to their Favour we would do ſo; but as we deſign to deal very ſincerely and plainly too with them, we muſt remind them of another Officer of Juſtice of a much lower Rank; to whom, as they not only pronounce but execute their own Judgment, they bear likewiſe ſome remote Reſemblance.</p>
               <p>But in reality there is another Light in which theſe modern Critics may with great Juſtice and Propriety be ſeen; and this is that of a common Slanderer. If a Perſon who prys into the Characters of others, with no other Deſign but to diſcover their Faults, and to publiſh them to the World, deſerves the Title of a Slanderer of the Reputations of Men; why ſhould not a Critic, who reads with the ſame male-volent View, be as properly ſtiled the Slanderer of the Reputation of Books?</p>
               <p>Vice hath not, I believe, a more abject Slave; So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety produces not a more odious Vermin; nor can the Devil receive a Gueſt more worthy of him, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The World, I am afraid, regards not this Monſter with half the Abhorrence which he deſerves, and I am more afraid to aſſign the Reaſon of this criminal Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſhewn towards him; yet it is certain that the

Thief looks innocent in the Compariſon; nay, the Murderer himſelf can ſeldom ſtand in Competition with his Guilt: For Slander is a more cruel Weapon than a Sword, as the Wounds which the former gives are always incurable. One Method, indeed, there is of killing, and that the baſeſt and moſt execrable of all, which bears an exact Analogy to the Vice here diſclaimed againſt, and that is Poiſon. A Means of Revenge ſo baſe, and yet ſo horrible, that it was once wiſely diſtinguiſhed by our Laws from all other Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, in the peculiar Severity of the Puniſhment.</p>

               <p>I will therefore endeavour in the remaining Part of this Chapter, to explain the Marks of this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and to ſhew what Criticiſm I here intend to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>obviate: For I can never be underſtood, unleſs by the very Perſons here meant, to inſinuate, that there are no proper Judges of Writing, or to endeavour to exclude from the Commonwealth of Literature any of thoſe noble Critics, to whoſe Labours the learned World are ſo greatly indebted. Such were <hi>Ariſtotle, Horace,</hi> and <hi>Longinus</hi> among the Ancients, <hi>Dacier</hi> and <hi>Boſſu</hi> among the <hi>French,</hi> and ſome perhaps a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us; who have certainly been duly authorized to execute at leaſt a judicial Authority in <hi>Foro Literario.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But without aſcertaining all the proper Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a Critic, which I have touched on elſewhere, I think I may very boldly object to the Cenſures of any one paſt upon Works which he hath not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf read. Such Cenſurers as theſe, whether they ſpeak from their own Gueſs or Suſpicion, or from the Report and Opinion of others, may properly be ſaid to ſlander the Reputation of the Book they condemn.</p>
               <p>Such may likewiſe be ſuſpected of deſerving this Character, who without aſſigning any particular Faults, condemn the whole in general deformatory Terms; ſuch as vile, dull, da—d Stuff, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and particularly by the Uſe of the Monoſyllable LOW; a Word which becomes the Mouth of no Critic who is not RIGHT HONOURABLE.</p>
               <p>Again, tho' there may be ſome Faults juſtly aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Work, yet if thoſe are not in the moſt eſſential Parts, or if they are compenſated by greater Beauties, it will ſavour rather of the Malice of a Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerer, than of the Judgment of a true Critic, to paſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This Landlord had the Character, among all his Neighbours, of being a very ſagacious Fellow. He was thought to ſee farther and deeper into Things than any Man in the Pariſh, the Parſon himſelf not excepted. Perhaps his Look had contributed not a little to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him this Reputation; for there was in this ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wonderfully wiſe and ſignificant, eſpecially when he had his Pipe in his Mouth; which, indeed, he ſeldom was without. His Behaviour likewiſe, greatly aſſiſted in promoting the Opinion of his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. In his Deportment he was ſolemn, if not ſullen; and when he ſpoke, which was ſeldom, he always delivered himſelf in a ſlow Voice; and though his Sentences were ſhort, they were ſtill interrupted with many Hum's and Ha's, Ay, Ays, and other Expletives: So that though he accompanied his Words with certain explanatory Geſtures, ſuch as ſhaking, or nodding the Head, or pointing with his Forefinger he generally left his Hearers to underſtand more than he expreſſed; nay, he commonly gave them a Hint that he knew much more than he thought proper to diſcloſe. This laſt Circumſtance alone, may, indeed very well account for his Character of Wiſdom, ſince Men are ſtrangely inclined to worſhip what they do not underſtand.

               <p>Mrs. <hi>Fitzpatrick</hi> likewiſe left her Bed at the ſame Time, and having ſummoned her Maid, immediately dreſſed herſelf.

                  <q rend="inline">'The Lieutenant who was neither a Sot nor a Sportſman, was frequently of our Parties; indeed he was very little with my Huſband, and no more than good-Breeding conſtrained him to be, as he lived almoſt conſtantly at our Houſe. My Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band often expreſſed much diſſatisfaction at the Lieutenant's preferring my Company to his; he was very angry with me on that Account, and gave me many a hearty Curſe for drawing away his Companions; ſaying, "I ought to be d—ned for having ſpoiled one of the prettieſt Fellows in the World, by making a Milk-ſop of him.'</q>

                  <q rend="inline">'You will be miſtaken, my dear <hi>Sophia,</hi> if you imagine that the Anger of my Huſband aroſe from my depriving him of a Companion; for the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant was not a Perſon with whoſe Society a Fool could be pleaſed; and if I ſhould admit the Poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of this, ſo little Right had my Huſband to place the Loſs of his Companion to me, that I am convinced it was my Converſation alone which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him ever to come to the Houſe. No, Child, it was Envy, the worſt and moſt rancorous Kind of Envy, the Envy of Superiority of Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The Wretch could not bear to ſee my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation preferred to his, by a Man of whom he could not entertain the leaſt Jealouſy.

'It is very likely I ſhall never marry at all,' anſwered <hi>Sophia;</hi> 'I think, at leaſt, I ſhall never marry a Man in whoſe Underſtanding I ſee any Defects before Marriage; and I promiſe you I would rather give up my own, than ſee any ſuch afterwards.'—'Give up your Underſtanding!' replied Mrs. <hi>Fitzpatrick,</hi> 'Oh fie, Child, I will not believe ſo meanly of you. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing elſe I might myſelf be brought to give up; but never this. Nature would not have allotted this Superiority to the Wife in ſo many Inſtances, if ſhe intended we ſhould have all ſurrendered it to the Huſband. This indeed Men of Senſe never expect of us; of which the Lieutenant I have juſt mentioned was one notable Example; for tho' he had a very good Underſtanding, he always acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged (as was really true) that his Wife had a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And this, perhaps, was one Reaſon of the Hatred my Tyrant bore her.'</q>

                  <q rend="inline">'Before he would be ſo governed by a Wife,' he ſaid, eſpecially ſuch an ugly B—(for indeed ſhe was not a regular Beauty, but very agreeable, and extremely genteel) he would ſee all the Women up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth at the Devil, which was a very uſual Phraſe with him.'</q>

                  <q rend="inline">'This Correſpondence however continued a whole Year, even all the while the Lieutenant was quartered in that Town; for which I was contented to pay the Tax of being conſtantly abuſed in the Manner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mentioned by my Huſband; I mean when he was at home; for he was frequently abſent a Month at a Time at <hi>Dublin,</hi> and once made a Journey of two Months to <hi>London;</hi> in all which Journeys I thought it a very ſingular Happineſs that he never once deſired my Company; nay, by his frequent Cenſures on Men who could not travel, as he phraſed it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Wife tied up to their Tail, he ſufficiently inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated that had I been never ſo deſirous of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying him, my Wiſhes would have been in vain; but, Heaven knows, ſuch Wiſhes were very far from my Thoughts.'</q>

               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'At length my Friend was removed from me, and I was again left to my Solitude, to the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting Converſation with my own Reflections, and to apply to Books for my only Comfort.

'Half a Score! half a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, Child,' anſwered the other. 'I read a good deal in <hi>Daniel</hi>'s <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hiſtory of <hi>France;</hi> a great deal in <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s Lives; the <hi>Atalantis, Pope</hi>'s <hi>Homer, Dryden</hi>'s Plays, <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs. <hi>D' Anois,</hi> and <hi>Lock</hi>'s Human Underſtanding.'</q>

                  <q rend="inline">'During this Interval I wrote three very ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating, and, I thought, moving Letters to my Aunt; but as I received no Anſwer to any of them, my Diſdain would not ſuffer me to continue my Application.'</q>—<q rend="inline">Here ſhe ſtopt, and looking ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly at <hi>Sophia,</hi> ſaid, 'Methinks my Dear, I read ſomething in your Eyes which reproaches me of a

               </p>
               <p>Thus then Mrs. <hi>Fitzpatrick</hi> reſumed her Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. <q rend="inline">'My Huſband now took a ſecond Journey to <hi>England,</hi> where he continued upwards of three Months.

What added to my Wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, was the Loſs of my little Infant: Not that I pretend to have had for it that extravagant Tenderneſs of which I believe I might have been capable under other Circumſtances; but I reſolved, in every Inſtance, to diſcharge the Duty of the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt Mother, and this Care prevented me from feeling the Weight of that, heavieſt of all Things, when it can be at all ſaid to lie heavy on our Hands.'</q>

               <p>

                  <q rend="inline">'A few Days after her Arrival, perceiving me in very low Spirits, without enquiring the Cauſe, which indeed ſhe very well knew, the young Lady fell to compaſſionating my Caſe. She ſaid, 'Tho' Polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:0618300102:326"/>
had prevented me from complaining of my Huſband's Behaviour to his Relations, yet they all were very ſenſible of it, and felt great Concern upon that Account; but none more than herſelf;" and after ſome general Diſcourſe on this Head, which I own I could not forbear Countenancing; at laſt, after much previous Precaution, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined Concealment, ſhe communicated to me, as a profound Secret—that my Huſband kept a Miſtreſs.'</q>

                  <q rend="inline">'You will certainly imagine, I heard this News with the utmoſt Inſenſibility—Upon my Word, if you do, your Imagination will miſlead you.

                  <q rend="inline">'And yet, my Dear, this Conduct is natural,' re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Mrs. <hi>Fitzpatrick;</hi> 'and when you have ſeen and read as much as myſelf, you will acknowledge it to be ſo.'</q>

               <p>

But though Hatred may ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to Contempt, and may, perhaps, get the better of it, Love, I believe, cannot. The Truth is, the Paſſion of Love is too reſtleſs to remain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conted, without the Gratification which it receives from its Object; and one can no more be inclined to love without loving, than we can have Eyes without ſeeing. When a Huſband, therefore, ceaſes to be the Object of this Paſſion, it is moſt probable ſome other Man—I ſay, my dear, if your Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band grows indifferent to you—if you once come to deſpiſe him—I ſay,—that is,—if you have the Paſſion of Love in you—Lud!

In a Word, then, he had ſpent and loſt all the ready Money of my Fortune; and as he could mortgage his own Eſtate no deeper, he was now deſirous to ſupply himſelf with Caſh for his Extravagance, by ſelling a little Eſtate of mine, which he could not do without my Aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and to obtain this Favour was the whole and ſole Motive of all the Fondneſs which he now put on.'</q>

'With this I peremptorily refuſed to comply.

Nay, the lying, fancy Villain, had the Aſſurance to tell me, that your Ladyſhip had owned yourſelf to be ſo: But I have clawed the Raſcal; I have left the Marks of my Nails in his impudent Face.

However, as this Miſtake of the Landlord ſufficiently accounted for thoſe Paſſages which <hi>Sophia</hi> had before miſtaken, ſhe acquired ſome Eaſe on that Account; nor could ſhe upon the whole, forbear ſmiling.

In Proportion as the Character of her Miſtreſs was raiſed, hers likewiſe, as ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, was raiſed with it; and, on the contrary, ſhe thought the one could not be lowered without the other.</p>

On this Subject, Reader, I muſt ſtop a Moment to tell thee a Story. <q rend="inline">'The famous <hi>Nell Gwynn,</hi> ſtepping one Day from a Houſe where ſhe had made a ſhort Viſit in her Coach, ſaw a great Mob aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and her Footman all bloody and dirty; the Fellow being aſked, by his Miſtreſs, the Reaſon of his being in that Condition, anſwered, 'I have been fighting, Madam, with an impudent Reſcal who called your Ladyſhip a Wh—re. 'You Block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,' replied Mrs. <hi>Gwynn,</hi> 'at this Rate you muſt fight every Day of your Life; why, you Fool, all the World knows it.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Do they?" cries the Fellow, in a muttering Voice, after he had ſhut the Coach Door, 'they ſhan't call me a Whore's Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man for all that.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the Paſſion of Mrs. <hi>Honour</hi> appears natural enough, even if it were to be no otherwiſe accounted for; but in reality, there was another Cauſe of her Anger; for which we muſt beg Leave to remind our Reader of a Circumſtance mentioned in the above Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile. There are indeed certain Liquors, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing applied to our Paſſions, or to Fire, produce Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the very Reverſe of thoſe produced by Water, as they ſerve to kindle and inflame, rather than to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh. Among theſe, the generous Liquor called Punch is one. It was not therefore without Reaſon, that the learned Dr. <hi>Cheney</hi> uſed to call drinking Punch pouring liquid Fire down your Throat.</p>
               <p>Now Mrs. <hi>Honour</hi> had unluckily poured ſo much of this liquid Fire down her Throat, that the Smoke of it began to aſcend into her Pericranium, and blinded the Eyes of Reaſon which is there ſuppoſed to keep her Reſidence, while the Fire itſelf from the Stomach eaſily reached the Heart, and there inflamed the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Paſſion of Pride. So that upon the whole, we ſhall ceaſe to wonder at the violent Rage of the Wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-woman; tho' at firſt Sight we muſt confeſs the Cauſe ſeems inadequate to the Effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="326" facs="tcp:0618300102:335"/>
                  <hi>Sophia</hi> and her Couſin both, did all in their Power to extinguiſh theſe Flames which had roared ſo loudly all over the Houſe. They at length prevailed; or, to carry the Metaphor one Step farther, the Fire hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſumed all the Fuel which the Language affords, to wit, every reproachful Term in it, at laſt went out of its own Accord.</p>
               <p>But tho' Tranquillity was reſtored above Stairs, it was not ſo below; where my Landlady highly reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Injury done to the Beauty of her Huſband, by the Fleſh-Spades of Mrs. <hi>Honour,</hi> called aloud for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge and Juſtice. As to the poor Man who had principally ſuffered in the Engagement, he was perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly quiet. Perhaps the Blood which he loſt might have cooled his Anger: For the Enemy had not only applied her Nails to his Cheeks, but likewiſe her Fiſt to his Noſtils, which lamented the Blow with Tears of Blood in great Abundance. To this we may add Reflections on his Miſtake; but indeed nothing ſo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually ſilenced his Reſentment, as the Manner in which he now diſcovered his Error; for as to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of Mrs. <hi>Honour,</hi> it had the more confirmed him in his Opinion: but he was now aſſured by a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of great Figure, and who was attended by a great Equipage, that one of the Ladies was a Woman of Faſhion, and his intimate Acquaintance.</p>
               <p>By the Orders of this Perſon, the Landlord now aſcended, and acquainted our fair Travellers, that a great Gentleman below deſired to do them the Honour of waiting on them. <hi>Sophia</hi> turned pale, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at this Meſſage, tho' the Reader will conclude it was too civil, notwithſtanding the Landlord's Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to have come from her Father; but Fear hath the common Fault of a Juſtice of Peace, and is apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude haſtily from every ſlight Circumſtance, without examining the Evidence on both Sides.</p>
               <p>To eaſe the Reader's Curioſity, therefore, rather than his Apprehenſions, we proceed to inform him,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:0618300102:336"/>
that an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Peer had arrived very late that Evening at the Inn in his Way to <hi>London.</hi> This Nobleman hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſallied from his Supper at the Hurricane before commemorated, had ſeen the Attendant of Mrs. <hi>Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patrick,</hi> and upon a ſhort Enquiry was informed, that her Lady, with whom he was very particularly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted was above. This Information he had no ſooner received, than he addreſſed himſelf to the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord, pacified him, and ſent him up Stairs with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments rather civiler than thoſe which were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
               <p>It may perhaps be wondered at, that the Waiting-woman herſelf was not the Meſſenger employed on this Occaſion; but we are ſorry to ſay, ſhe was not at preſent qualified for that, or indeed for any other Office. The Rum (for ſo the Landlord choſe to call the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillation from Malt) had baſely taken the Advantage of the Fatigue which the poor Woman had undergone, and had made terrible Depredations on her noble Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, at a Time when they were very unable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the Attack.</p>
               <p>We ſhall not deſcribe this tragical Scene too fully; but we thought ourſelves obliged by that hiſtoric In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity which we profeſs, ſhortly to hint a Matter which we would otherwiſe have been glad to have ſpared. Many Hiſtorians indeed, for Want of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, or of Diligence, to ſay no worſe, often leave the Reader to find out theſe little Circumſtances in the Dark, and ſometimes to his great Confuſion and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sophia</hi> was very ſoon eaſed of her cauſeleſs Fright by the Entry of the noble Peer, who was not only an intimate Acquaintance of Mrs. <hi>Fitzpatrick;</hi> but in reality a very particular Friend of that Lady. To ſay Truth, it was by his Aſſiſtance, that ſhe had been enabled to eſcape from her Husband; for this Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had the ſame gallant Diſpoſition with thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Knights, of whom we read in heroic Story,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:0618300102:337"/>
and had delivered many an impriſoned Nymph from Durance. He was indeed as bitter an Enemy to the ſavage Authority too often exerciſed by Huſbands and Fathers, over the young and lovely of the other Sex, as ever Knight Errant was to the barbarous Power of Enchanters: nay, to ſay Truth, I have often ſuſpected that thoſe very Enchanters with which Romance every where abounds, were in reality no other than the Huſbands of thoſe Days: and Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony itſelf was perhaps the enchanted Caſtle in which the Nymphs were ſaid to be confined.</p>
               <p>This Nobleman had an Eſtate in the Neighbourhood of <hi>Fitzpatrick,</hi> and had been for ſome Time acquainted with the Lady. No ſooner therefore did he hear of her Confinement, than he earneſtly applied himſelf to procure her Liberty; which he preſently effected, not by ſtorming the Caſtle, according to the Example of ancient Heroes; but by corrupting the Governor, in Conformity with the modern Art of War; in which Craft is held to be preferable to Valour, and Gold is found to be more irreſiſtible than either Lead or Steel.</p>
               <p>This Circumſtance, however, as the Lady did not think it material enough to relate to her Friend, we would not at that Time impart it to the Reader. We rather choſe to leave him a while under a Suppoſition, that ſhe had found, or coined, or by ſome very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, perhaps ſupernatural Means, had poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed herſelf of the Money with which ſhe had bribed her Keeper, than to interrupt her Narrative by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Hint of what ſeemed to her of too little Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to be mentioned.</p>
               <p>The Peer after a ſhort Converſation, could not forbear expreſſing ſome Surprize at meeting the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in that Place, nor could he refrain from telling her, he imagined ſhe had been gone to <hi>Bath.</hi> Mrs. <hi>Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patrick</hi> very freely anſwered, <q rend="inline">'That ſhe had been prevented in her Purpoſe by the Arrival of a Perſon
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:0618300102:338"/>
ſhe need not mention. In ſhort,' ſays ſhe, 'I was overtaken by my Huſband (for I need not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to conceal what the World knows too well al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.) I had the good Fortune to eſcape in a moſt ſurprizing Manner, and am now going to <hi>London</hi> with this young Lady, who is a near Relation of mine, and who hath eſcaped from as great a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant as my own.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>His Lordſhip concluding that this Tyrant was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a Huſband, made a Speech, full of Compliments to both the Ladies, and as full of Invectives againſt his own Sex; nor indeed did he avoid ſome oblique Glances at the matrimonial Inſtitution itſelf, and at the unjuſt Powers given by it to Man over the more ſenſible, and more meritorious Part of the Species. He ended his Oration with an Offer of his Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and of his Coach and Six, which was inſtantly accepted by Mrs. <hi>Fitzpatrick,</hi> and at laſt, upon her Perſuaſions, by <hi>Sophia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Matters being thus adjuſted, his Lordſhip took his Leave, and the Ladies retired to Reſt, where Mrs. <hi>Fitzpatrick</hi> entertained her Couſin with many high Encomiums on the Character of the noble Peer, and enlarged very particularly on his great Fondneſs for his Wife; ſaying, ſhe believed he was almoſt the only Perſon of his Rank, who was entirely conſtant to the Marriage Bed. <q rend="inline">'Indeed, added ſhe, my dear <hi>Sophy,</hi> that is a very rare Virtue amongſt Men of Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Never expect it when you marry; for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me, if you do, you will certainly be deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>A gentle Sigh ſtole from <hi>Sophia</hi> at theſe Words, which perhaps contributed to form a Dream of no very pleaſant Kind; but as ſhe never revealed this Dream to any one, ſo the Reader cannot expect to ſee it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated here.</p>

               <p>THOSE Members of the Society, who are born to furniſh the Bleſſings of Life, now began to light their Candles, in order to purſue their daily La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, for the Uſe of thoſe who are born to enjoy theſe Bleſſings. The ſturdy Hind now attends the Levee of his Fellow Labourer the OX; the cunning Artificer, the diligent mechanic ſpring from their hard Mattreſs; and now the bonny Houſe-maid begins to repair the diſordered Drum-Room, while the riotous Authors of that Diſorder, in broken interrupted Slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, tumble and toſs, as if the Hardneſs of Down diſquieted their Repoſe.</p>
               <p>In ſimple Phraſe, the Clock had no ſooner ſtruck Seven, than the Ladies were ready for their Journey, and at their Deſire, his Lordſhip and his Equipage were prepared to attend them.</p>
               <p>And now a Matter of ſome Difficulty aroſe; and this was how his Lordſhip himſelf ſhould be convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: For tho' in Stage Coaches, where Paſſengers are properly conſidered as ſo much Luggage, the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Coachman ſtows half a Dozen with perfect Eaſe into the Place of four: for well he contrives that the fat Hoſteſs, or well-fed Alderman, may take up no more Room than the ſlim Miſs, or taper Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; it being the Nature of Guts, when well ſqueez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to give Way, and to lie in a narrow Compaſs; yet in theſe Vehicles which are called, for Diſtinction<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake, Gentlemens Coaches, tho' they are often larger
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:0618300102:340"/>
than the others, this Method of packing is never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted.</p>
               <p>His Lordſhip would have put a ſhort End to the Difficulty, by very gallantly deſiring to mount his Horſe; but Mrs. <hi>Fitzpatrick</hi> would by no Means conſent to it. It was therefore concluded that the <hi>Abigails</hi> ſhould by Turns relieve each other on one of his Lordſhip's Horſes, which was preſently equip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with a Side-Saddle for that Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Every thing being ſettled at the Inn, the Ladies diſcharged their former Guides, and <hi>Sophia</hi> made a preſent to the Landlord, partly to repair the Bruiſe which he had received under herſelf, and partly on Account of what he had ſuffered under the Hands of her enraged Waiting-woman. And now <hi>Sophia</hi> firſt diſcovered a Loſs which gave her ſome Uneaſineſs; and this was of the hundred Pound Bank Bill which her Father had given her at their laſt Meeting; and which, within a very inconſiderable Trifle, was all the Treaſure ſhe was at preſent worth. She ſearched e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where, and ſhook and tumbled all her Things to no Purpoſe, the Bill was not to be found: And ſhe was at laſt fully perſuaded that ſhe had loſt it from her Pocket when ſhe had the Misfortune of tumbling from her Horſe in the dark Lane, as before recorded. A Fact that ſeemed the more probable, as ſhe now recollected ſome Diſcompoſure in her Pockets which had happened at that Time, and the great Difficulty with which ſhe had drawn forth her Handkerchief the very Inſtant before her Fall, in order to relieve the Diſtreſs of Mrs. <hi>Fitzpatrick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Misfortunes of this Kind, whatever Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies they may be attended with, are incapable of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing a Mind in which there is any Strength, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Aſſiſtance of Avarice. <hi>Sophia</hi> therefore, tho' nothing could be worſe timed than this Accident, at ſuch a Seaſon, immediately got the better of her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, and with her wonted Serenity and Cheerfulneſs
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:0618300102:341"/>
of Countenance, returned to her Company. His Lordſhip conducted the Ladies into the Vehicle, as he did likewiſe Mrs. <hi>Honour,</hi> who, after many Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities, and more Dear Madams, at laſt yielded to the well-bred Importunities of her Siſter <hi>Abigail,</hi> and ſubmitted to be complimented with the firſt Ride in the Coach; in which indeed ſhe would afterwards have been contented to have purſued her whole Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, had not her Miſtreſs, after ſeveral fruitleſs In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timations, at length forced her to take her Turn on Horſeback.</p>
               <p>The Coach now having received its Company, began to move forwards, attended by many Servants, and by two led Captains, who had before rode with his Lordſhip, and who would have been diſmiſſed from the Vehicle upon a much leſs worthy Occaſion, than was this of accommodating two Ladies. In this they acted only as Gentlemen; but they were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy at any Time to have performed the Office of a Footman, or indeed would have condeſcended lower, for the Honour of his Lordſhip's Company, and for the Convenience of his Table.</p>
               <p>My Landlord was ſo pleaſed with the Preſent he had received from <hi>Sophia,</hi> that he rather rejoiced in than regretted his Bruiſe, or his Scratches. The Reader will perhaps be curious to know the <hi>Quantum</hi> of this Preſent, but we cannot ſatisfy his Curioſity. Whatever it was, it ſatisfied the Landlord for his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Hurt; but he lamented he had not known before how little the Lady valued her Money; <q rend="inline">'For to be ſure,' ſays he, 'one might have charged every Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle double, and ſhe would have made no Cavil at the Reckoning.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>His Wife however was far from drawing this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion; whether ſhe really felt any Injury done to her Huſband more than he did himſelf, I will not ſay; certain it is, ſhe was much leſs ſatisfied with the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity of <hi>Sophia.</hi> Indeed,' cries ſhe, 'my Dear,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:0618300102:342"/>
the Lady knows better how to diſpoſe of her Money than you imagine. She might very well think we ſhould not put up ſuch a Buſineſs without ſome Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and the Law would have coſt her an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite deal more than this poor little Matter, which I wonder you would take.' 'You are always ſo bloodily wiſe,' quoth the Huſband, 'It would have coſt her more, would it? Doſt fancy I don't know that as well as thee? But would any of that more, or ſo much, have come into our Pockets? Indeed, if Son <hi>Tom</hi> the Lawyer had been alive, I could have been glad to have put ſuch a pretty Buſineſs into his Hands. He would have got a good Picking out of it; but I have no Relation now who is a Lawyer, and why ſhould I go to Law for the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Strangers?

               <p>Some Readers will perhaps condemn this extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Delicacy, as I may call it, of Virtue, as too <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

for her Situation, which muſt be owned to have been very tickliſh: and when we conſider the Malice of cenſorious Tongues, we muſt allow, if it was a Fault, the Fault was an Exceſs on the right Side, and which every Woman who is in the ſelf-ſame Situation will do well to imitate. The moſt formal Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Virtue, when it is only an Appearance, may perhaps, in very abſtracted Conſiderations, ſeem to be rather leſs commendable than Virtue itſelf without this Formality; but it will however be always more commended; and this, I believe, will be granted by all, that it is neceſſary, unleſs in ſome very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Caſes, for every Women to ſupport either the one or the other.</p>
               <p>A Lodging being prepared, <hi>Sophia</hi> accompanied her Couſin for that Evening; but reſolved early in the Morning to enquire after the Lady, into whoſe Protection, as we have formerly mentioned, ſhe had determined to throw herſelf, when ſhe quitted her Father's Houſe. And this ſhe was the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in doing, for ſome Obſervations ſhe had made during her Journey in the Coach.</p>
               <p>Now as we could by no Means fix the odious Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Suſpicion on <hi>Sophia,</hi> we are almoſt afraid to open to our Reader the Conceits which filled he Mind concerning Mrs. <hi>Fitzpatrick;</hi> of whom ſhe certainly entertained at preſent ſome Doubts; which as they are very apt to enter into the Boſoms of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="337" facs="tcp:0618300102:346"/>
and always more than really exiſts. This is that quick-ſighted Penetration, whoſe Hawk's Eyes no Symptom of Evil can eſcape; which obſerves not only upon the Actions, but upon the Words and Looks of Men; and as it proceeds from the Heart of the Obſerver, ſo it dives into the Heart of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and there eſpies Evil, as it were, in the firſt Embryo; nay ſometimes before it can be ſaid to be conceived. An admirable Faculty, if it were infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible; but as this Degree of Perfection is not even claimed by more than one mortal Being, ſo from the Fallibility of ſuch acute Diſcernment have ariſen many ſad Miſchiefs and moſt grievous Heart-akes to Innocence and Virtue. I cannot help therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding this vaſt Quickſightedneſs into Evil, as a vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Exceſs, and a very pernicious Evil in itſelf. And I am the more inclined to this Opinion, as I am afraid it always proceeds from a Bad Heart, for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons I have above-mentioned, and for one more, namely, becauſe I never knew it the Property of a good one. Now from this Degree of Suſpicion I entirely and abſolutely acquit <hi>Sophia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A ſecond Degree of this Quality ſeems to ariſe from the Head. This is indeed no other than the Faculty of ſeeing what is before your Eyes, and of drawing Concluſions from what you ſee. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of theſe is unavoidable by thoſe who have any Eyes, and the latter is perhaps no leſs certain and neceſſary a Conſequence of our having any Brains. This is altogether as bitter an Enemy to Guilt, as the former is to Innocence, nor can I ſee it in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amiable Light, even though, through human Fallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, it ſhould be ſometimes miſtaken. For Inſtance, if a Huſband ſhould accidentally ſurprize his Wife in the Lap or in the Embraces of ſome of thoſe pretty young Gentlemen who profeſs the Art of Cuckol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, I ſhould not highly, I think, blame him for
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:0618300102:347"/>
concluding more than what he ſaw, from the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarities which he really had ſeen, and which we are at leaſt favourable enough to, when we call them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Freedoms. The Reader will eaſily ſuggeſt great Plenty of Inſtances to himſelf; I ſhall add but one more, which however unchriſtian it may be thought by ſome, I cannot help eſteeming to be ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſtifiable; and this is a Suſpicion that a Man is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of doing what he hath done already, and tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it is poſſible for one who hath been a Villain once, to act the ſame Part again. And to confeſs the Truth, of this Degree of Suſpicion, I believe, <hi>Sophia</hi> was guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. From this Degree of Suſpicion ſhe had, in Fact, conceived an Opinion, that her Couſin was really not better than ſhe ſhould be.</p>
               <p>The Caſe it ſeems, was this: Mrs. <hi>Fitzpatrick</hi> wiſely conſidered, that the Virtue of a young Lady is, in the World, in the ſame Situation with a poor Hare, which is certain, whenever it ventures abroad, to meet its Enemies: For it can hardly meet any other. No ſooner therefore was ſhe determined to take the firſt Opportunity of quitting the Protection of her Huſband, than ſhe reſolved to caſt herſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Protection of ſome other Man; and whom could ſhe ſo properly chuſe to be her Guardian as a Perſon of Quality, of Fortune, of Honour; and who, beſides a gallant Diſpoſition which inclines Men to Knight-Errantry; that is, to be the Champions of Ladies in Diſtreſs, had often declared a violent Attachment to herſelf, and had already given her all the Inſtances of it in his Power.</p>
               <p>But as the Law hath fooliſhly omitted this Office of Vice-Huſband, or Guardian to an eloped Lady and as Malice is apt to denominate him by a more diſagreeable Appellation; it was concluded that his Lordſhip ſhould perform all ſuch kind Offices to the Lady in ſecret, and without publickly aſſuming the Character of her Protector. Nay, to prevent any other
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:0618300102:348"/>
Perſon from ſeeing him in this Light, it was agreed that the Lady ſhould proceed directly to <hi>Bath,</hi> and that his Lordſhip ſhould firſt go to <hi>London,</hi> and thence ſhould go down to that Place by the Advice of his Phyſicians.</p>
               <p>Now all this <hi>Sophia</hi> very plainly underſtood, not from the Lips or Behaviour of Mrs. <hi>Fitzpatrick;</hi> but from the Peer, who was infinitely leſs expert at re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a Secret, than was the good Lady; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the exact Secrecy which Mrs. <hi>Fitzpatrick</hi> had obſerved on this Head in her Narrative, ſerved not a little to heighten thoſe Suſpicions which were now riſen in the Mind of her Couſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sophia</hi> very eaſily found out the Lady ſhe ſought, for indeed there was not a Chairman in Town to whom her Houſe was not perfectly well known; and as ſhe received, in Return of her firſt Meſſage, a moſt preſſing Invitation, ſhe immediately accepted it. Mrs. <hi>Fitzpatrick</hi> indeed did not deſire her Couſin to ſtay with her with more earneſtneſs than Civility required. Whether ſhe had diſcerned and reſented the Suſpicion above-mentioned, or from what other Motive it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe, I cannot ſay; but certain it is, ſhe was full as deſirous of parting with <hi>Sophia,</hi> as <hi>Sophia</hi> herſelf could be of going.</p>
               <p>The young Lady, when ſhe came to take Leave of her Couſin, could not avoid giving her a ſhort Hint of Advice. She begged her, for Heaven's Sake, to take Care of herſelf, and to conſider in how dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous a Situation ſhe ſtood; adding, ſhe hoped ſome Method would be found of reconciling her to her Huſband. <q rend="inline">'You muſt remember, my Dear, ſays ſhe, the Maxim which my Aunt <hi>Weſtern</hi> hath ſo often repeated to us both; <hi>That whenever the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonial Alliance is broke, and War declared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Husband and Wife, ſhe can hardly make a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantageous Peace for herſelf on any Conditions.</hi>
                     <pb n="340" facs="tcp:0618300102:349"/>
Theſe are my Aunt's very Words, and ſhe hath had a great deal of Experience in the World.'</q> Mrs. <hi>Fitzpatrick</hi> anſwered, with a contemptuous Smile, <q rend="inline">'Never fear me, Child, take Care of yourſelf; for you are younger than me. I will come and viſit you in a few Days; but, dear <hi>Sophy,</hi> let me give you one Piece of Advice: Leave the Character of <hi>Graveairs</hi> in the Country; for, believe me it will ſit very aukwardly upon you in this Town.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the two Couſins parted, and <hi>Sophia</hi> repaired directly to Lady <hi>Bellaſton,</hi> where ſhe found a moſt hearty, as well as moſt polite Welcome. The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy had taken a great Fancy to her when ſhe had ſeen her formerly with her Aunt <hi>Weſtern.</hi> She was indeed extremely glad to ſee her, and was no ſooner acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Reaſons which induced her to leave the Squire and fly to <hi>London,</hi> than ſhe highly applauded her Senſe and Reſolution; and after expreſſing the higheſt Satisfaction in the Opinion which <hi>Sophia</hi> had declared ſhe entertained of her Ladyſhip, by chuſing her Houſe for an Aſylum, ſhe promiſed her all the Protection which it was in her Power to give.</p>
               <p>As we have now brought <hi>Sophia</hi> into ſafe Hands, the Reader will, I apprehend, be contented to depoſite her there a while, and to look a little after other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages, and particularly poor <hi>Jones,</hi> whom we have left long enough to do Penance for his paſt Offences, which, as is the Nature of Vice, brought ſufficient Puniſhment upon him themſelves.</p>

               <p>THE learned Reader muſt have obſerved, that in the Courſe of this mighty Work, I have often tranſlated Paſſages out of the beſt antient Authors, without quoting the Original, or without taking the leaſt Notice of the Book from whence they were borrowed.</p>
               <p>This Conduct in Writing is placed in a proper Light by the ingenious Abbe <hi>Bannier,</hi> in his Preface to his Mythology, a Work of great Erudition, and of equal Judgment. <q rend="inline">'It will be eaſy,' ſays he, 'for the Reader to obſerve, that I have frequently had greater Regard to him, than to my own Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For an Author certainly pays him a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

               </p>
               <p>To fill up a Work with theſe Scraps may indeed be conſidered as a downright Cheat on the learned World, who are by ſuch Means impoſed upon to buy a ſecond Time in Fragments and by Retail what they have already in Groſs, if not in their Memories, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Shelves; and it is ſtill more cruel upon the Illiterate, who are drawn in to pay for what is of no manner of Uſe to them. A Writer who intermixes great Quaintity of <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> with his Works, deals by the Ladies and fine Gentlemen in the ſame paultry Manner with which they are treated by the Auctioneers, who often endeavour ſo to confound and mix up their Lots, that, in order to purchaſe the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity you want, you are obliged at the ſame Time to purchaſe that which will do you no Service.</p>
               <p>And yet as there is no Conduct ſo fair and diſinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted, but that it may be miſunderſtood by Ignorance, and miſrepreſented by Malice, I have been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times tempted to preſerve my own Reputation, at the Expence of my Reader, and to tranſcribe the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, or at leaſt to quote Chapter and Verſe, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I have made Uſe either of the Thought or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of another. I am indeed in ſome Doubt that I have often ſuffered by that contrary Method; and that by ſuppreſſing the original Author's Name, I have been rather ſuſpected of Plagiariſm, than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to act from the amiable Motive above-aſſigned by that juſtly celebrated <hi>Frenchman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to obviate all ſuch Imputations for the future, I do here confeſs and juſtify the Fact. The Ancients may be conſidered as a rich Common, where every Perſon who hath the ſmalleſt Tenement in <hi>Parnaſſus</hi> hath a free Right to fatten his Muſe. Or, to place it in a clearer Light, we Moderns are to the Antients
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:0618300102:352"/>
what the Poor are to the Rich. By the Poor here I mean, that large and venerable Body which, in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,</hi> we call The Mob. Now, whoever hath had the Honour to be admitted to any Degree of Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with this Mob, muſt well know that it is one of their eſtabliſhed Maxims, to plunder and pillage their rich Neighbours without any Reluctance; and that this is held to be neither Sin nor Shame among them. And ſo conſtantly do they abide and act by this Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im, that in every Pariſh almoſt in the Kingdom, there is a Kind of Confederacy ever carrying on againſt a certain Perſon of Opulence called the Squire, whoſe Property is conſidered as Free-Booty by all his poor Neighbours; who, as they conclude that there is no Manner of Guilt in ſuch Depredations, look upon it is a Point of Honour and moral Obligation to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal, and to preſerve each other from Puniſhment on all ſuch Occaſions.</p>
               <p>In like Manner are the Ancients, ſuch as <hi>Homer, Virgil, Horace, Cicero,</hi> and the reſt, to be eſteemed among us Writers, as ſo many wealthy Squires, from whom we, the Poor of <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> claim an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial Cuſtom of taking whatever we can come at. This Liberty I demand, and this I am as ready to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low again to my poor Neighbours in their Turn. All profeſs, and all I require from my Brethren, is to maintain the ſame ſtrict Honeſty among ourſelves, which the Mob ſhew to one another. To ſteal from one another, is indeed highly criminal and indecent; for this may be ſtrictly ſtiled defrauding the Poor ſometimes perhaps thoſe who are poorer than our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) or to ſee it under the moſt opprobrious Colours, robbing the Spittal.</p>
               <p>Since therefore upon the ſtricteſt Examination, my own Conſcience cannot lay any ſuch pitiful Theft to my Charge, I am contented to plead guilty to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Accuſation; nor ſhall I ever ſcruple to take to my ſelf any Paſſage which I ſhall find in an ancient Author
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:0618300102:353"/>
to my Purpoſe, without ſetting down the Name of the Author from whence it was taken. Nay, I abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely claim a Property in all ſuch Sentiments the Moment they are tranſcribed into my Writings, and I expect all Readers henceforward to regard them as purely and entirely my own. This Claim however I deſire to be allowed me only on Condition, that I preſerve ſtrict Honeſty towards my poor Brethren, from whom if ever I borrow any of that little of which they are poſſeſſed, I ſhall never fail to put their Mark upon it, that it may be at all Times ready to be reſtored to the right Owner.</p>
               <p>The Omiſſion of this was highly blameable in one Mr. <hi>Moore,</hi> who having formerly borrowed ſome Lines of <hi>Pope</hi> and Company, took the Liberty to tranſcribe ſix of them into his Play of the <hi>Rival Modes.</hi> Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> however very luckily found them in the ſaid Play, and laying violent Hands on his own Property, transferred it back again into his own Works; and for a further Puniſhment, impriſoned the ſaid <hi>Moore</hi> in the loathſome Dungeon of the <hi>Dunciad,</hi> where his unhappy Memory now remains, and eternally will remain, as a proper Puniſhment for ſuch his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Dealings in the poetical Trade.</p>

Sure never was ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky a Dog as myſelf! and then burſt forth a Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of Oaths and Execrations.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Parſon attempted to adminiſter Comfort to him on this Occaſion. <q rend="inline">'Sorrow not, Sir,' ſays he, like thoſe without Hope. Howbeit we have not yet been able to overtake young Madam, we may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it ſome good Fortune, that we have hitherto traced her Courſe aright. Peradventure ſhe will ſoon be fatigated with her Journey, and will tarry in ſome Inn, in order to renovate her corporeal Functions; and in that Caſe, in all moral Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, you will very briefly be <hi>compos voti.</hi>'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'Pogh! D—n the Slut,' anſwered the Squire, I am lamenting the Loſs of ſo fine a Morning for Hunting. It is confounded hard to loſe one of the beſt Scenting Days, in all Appearance, which hath been this Seaſon, and eſpecially after ſo long a Froſt.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Whether Fortune, who now and then ſhews ſome Compaſſion in her wantoneſt Tricks, might not take Pity of the Squire; and as ſhe had detirmined not to let him overtake his Daughter, might not reſolve to make him Amends ſome other Way, I will not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert; but he had hardly uttered the Words juſt before commemorated, and two or three Oaths at their Heels, when a Pack of Hounds began to open their melodious Throats at a ſmall Diſtance from them, which the Squire's Horſe and his Rider both perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:0618300102:355"/>
both immediately pricked up their Ears, and the Squire crying, 'She's gone, ſhe's gone!' Damn me 'if ſhe is not gone!' inſtantly clapped Spurs to the Beaſt, who little needed it, having indeed the ſame Inclination with his Maſter; and now the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany croſing into a Corn field, rode directly towards the Hounds, with much Hollowing and Hooping, while the poor Parſon, bleſſing himſelf, brought up the Rear.</p>
               <p>Thus Fable reports, that the fair <hi>Grimalkin,</hi> whom <hi>Venus,</hi> at the Deſire of a paſſionate Lover, converted from a Cat into a fine Woman, no ſooner perceived a Mouſe, than mindful of her former Sport, and ſtill retaining her priſtine Nature, ſhe lept from the Bed of her Huſband to purſue the little Animal.</p>
               <p>What are we to underſtand by this? Not that the Bride was diſpleaſed with the Embraces of her amorous Bridegroom: For tho' ſome have remarked that Cats are ſubject to Ingratitude, yet Women and Cats too will be pleaſed and purr on certain Occaſions. The Truth is, as the ſagacious Sir <hi>Roger L'Eſtrange</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, in his deep Reflections, that <q rend="inline">'if we ſhut Nature out at the Door, ſhe will come in at the Window; and that Puſs, tho' a Madam, will be a Mouſer ſtill.'</q> In the ſame Manner we are not to arraign the Squire of any Want of Love for his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: For in reality he had a great deal; we are only to conſider that he was a Squire and a Sportſman, and then we may apply the Fable to him, and the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Reflections likewiſe.</p>
               <p>The Hounds ran very hard, as it is called, and the Squire purſued over Hedge and Ditch, with all his uſual Vociferation and Alacrity, and with all his uſual Pleaſure; nor did the Thoughts of <hi>Sophia</hi> ever once intrude themſelves to allay the Satisfaction he enjoyed in the Chace, which, he ſaid, was one of the fineſt he ever ſaw, and which he ſwore was very well worth going fifty Miles for. As the Squire forgot his
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:0618300102:356"/>
Daughter, the Servants, we may eaſily believe, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got their Miſtreſs; and the Parſon, after having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd much Aſtoniſhment in <hi>Latin</hi> to himſelf, at length likewiſe abandoned all farther Thoughts of the young Lady, and jogging on at a Diſtance behind, began to meditate a Portion of Doctrine for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing <hi>Sunday.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Squire who owned the Hounds was highly pleaſed with the Arrival of his Brother Squire and Sportſman: For all Men approve Merit in their own Way, and no Man was more expert in the Field than Mr. <hi>Weſtern,</hi> nor did any other better know how to encourage the Dogs with his Voice, and to animate the Hunt with his Holla.</p>
               <p>Sportſmen, in the Warmth of a Chace, are too much engaged to attend to any Manner of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; nay, even to the Office of Humanity: For if any of them meet with an Accident by tumbling into a Ditch, or into a River, the reſt paſs on regardleſs, and generally leave him to his Fate; during this Time, therefore, the two Squires, tho' often cloſe to each other, interchanged not a ſingle Word. The Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Hunt, however, often ſaw and approved the great Judgment of the Stranger in drawing the Dogs when they were at a Fault, and hence conceived a very high Opinion of his Underſtanding, as the Number of his Attendants inſpired no ſmall Reverence to his Quality. As ſoon therefore as the Sport was ended by the Death of the little Animal which had occaſioned it, the two Squires met, and in all Squire-like Greeting, ſaluted each other.</p>
               <p>The Converſation was entertaining enough, and what we may perhaps relate in an Appendix, or on ſome other Occaſion; but as it nowiſe concerns this Hiſtory, we cannot prevail on ourſelves to give it a Place here. It concluded with a ſecond Chace, and that with an Invitation to Dinner. This being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, was followed by a hearty Bout of Drinking,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:0618300102:357"/>
which ended in as hearty a Nap on the Part of Squire <hi>Weſtern.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Squire was by no Means a Match either for his Hoſt, or for Parſon <hi>Supple,</hi> at his Cups that Evening; for which the violent Fatigue of Mind as well as Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that he had undergone, may very well account, without the leaſt Derogation from his Honour. He was indeed, according to the vulgar Phraſe, whiſtled drunk; for before he had ſwallowed the third Bottle, he became ſo entirely overpowered, that tho' he was not carried off to Bed till long after, the Parſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered him as abſent, and having acquainted the other Squire with all relating to <hi>Sophia,</hi> he obtained his Promiſe of ſeconding thoſe Arguments which he intended to urge the next Morning for Mr. <hi>Weſtern</hi>'s Return.</p>
               <p>No ſooner therefore had the good Squire ſhaken off his Evening, and began to call for his Morning Draught, and to ſummon his Horſes in order to renew his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, than Mr. <hi>Supple</hi> began his Diſſuaſives; which the Hoſt ſo ſtrongly ſeconded, that they at length prevailed, and Mr. <hi>Weſtern</hi> agreed to return home; being principally moved by one Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> That he knew not which Way to go, and might probably be riding farther from his Daughter inſtead of towards her. He then took Leave of his Brother Sportſman, and expreſſing great Joy that the Froſt was broken (which might perhaps be no ſmall Motive to his haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening home) ſet forwards, or rather backwards, for <hi>Somerſetſhire;</hi> but not before he diſpatched Part of his Retinue in queſt of his Daughter, after whom he likewiſe ſent a Volley of the moſt bitter Execrations which he could invent.</p>

               <p>AT length we are once more come to our He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roe; and to ſay Truth, we have been obliged to part with him ſo long, that conſidering the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in which we left him, I apprehend many of our Readers have concluded we intended to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don him for ever; he being at preſent in that Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in which prudent People uſually deſiſt from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring any farther after their Friends, leſt they ſhould be ſhocked by hearing ſuch Friends had hanged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>But, in reality, if we have not all the Virtues, I will boldly ſay, neither have we all the Vices of a prudent Character; and tho' it is not eaſy to conceive Circumſtances much more miſerable than thoſe of poor <hi>Jones</hi> at preſent, we ſhall return to him, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon him with the ſame Diligence as if he was wantoning in the brighteſt Beams <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> Fortune.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> then, and his Companion <hi>Partridge,</hi> left the Inn a few Minutes after the Departure of Squire <hi>Weſtern,</hi> and purſued the ſame Road on Foot; for the Oſtler told them, that no Horſes were by any Means to be at that Time procured at <hi>Upton.</hi> On they marched with heavy Hearts; for tho' their Diſquiet proceeded from very different Reaſons, yet diſpleaſed they were both; and if <hi>Jones</hi> ſighed bitterly, <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge</hi> grunted altogether as ſadly every Step.</p>
               <p>When they came to the Croſs-roads where the Squire had ſtopt to take Council, <hi>Jones</hi> ſtopt likewiſe, and turning to <hi>Partridge,</hi> aſked his Opinion which Track they ſhould purſue. <q rend="inline">Ah, Sir!' anſwered <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge,</hi> I wiſh your Honour would follow my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Why ſhould I not?' replied <hi>Jones;</hi> for it is now indifferent to me whither I go, or what
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:0618300102:359"/>
becomes of me?</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'My Advice then, ſaid <hi>Partridge,</hi> is that you immediately face about and return home: For who that had ſuch a Home to return to, as your Honour, would travel thus about the Country like a' Vagabond? I aſk Pardon, <hi>ſed vox eaſola reperta eſt.</hi>'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'Alas! cries <hi>Jones,</hi> I have no Home to return to;—but if my Friend, my Father would receive me, could I bear the Country from which <hi>Sophia</hi> is flown—Cruel <hi>Sophia!</hi> Cruel! No. Let me blame myſelf—No, let me blame thee. D—nation ſeize thee, Fool, Blockhead! thou haſt undone me,' and I will tear thy Soul from thy Body</q>—At which Words he laid violent Hands on the Collar of poor <hi>Partridge,</hi> and ſhook him more heartily than an Ague Fit, or his own Fears had ever done before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Partridge</hi> fell trembling on his Knees, and begged for Mercy, vowing he had meant no Harm—when <hi>Jones,</hi> after ſtaring wildly on him for a Moment, quitted his Hold; and diſcharged a Rage on himſelf, that had it fallen on the other, would certainly have put an End to his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eing, which indeed the very Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of it had almoſt effected.</p>
               <p>We would beſtow ſome Pains here in minutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing all the mad Pranks which <hi>Jones</hi> played on this Occaſion, could we be well aſſured that the Reader would take the ſame Pains in peruſing them; but as we are appprehenſive that after all the Labour which we ſhould employ in painting this Scene, the ſaid Reader would be very apt to ſkip it entirely over, we have ſaved ourſelves that Trouble. To ſay the Truth, we have, from this Reaſon alone, often done great Violence to the Luxuriance of our Genius, and have left many excellent Deſcriptions out of our Work, which would otherwiſe have been in it. And this Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion, to be honeſt, ariſes, as is generally the Caſe, from our own wicked Heart; for we have, ourſelves, been very often moſt horridly given to jumping, as we have run through the Pages of voluminous Hiſtorians.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="351" facs="tcp:0618300102:360"/>
Suffice it then ſimply to ſay, that <hi>Jones,</hi> after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing played the Part of a Madam for many Minutes, came, by Degrees, to himſelf; which no ſooner hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, than turning to <hi>Partridge,</hi> he very earneſtly begged his Pardon for the Attack he had made on him in the Violence of his Paſſion; but concluded, by deſiring him never to mention his Return again; for he was reſolved never to ſee that Country any more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Partridge</hi> eaſily forgave, and faithfully promiſed to obey the Injunction now laid upon him. And then <hi>Jones</hi> very briſkly cried out: <q rend="inline">'Since it is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely impoſſible for me to purſue any farther the Steps of my Angel—I will purſue thoſe of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Come on, my brave Lad, now for the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my:—It is a glorious Cauſe, and I would will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſacrifice my Life in it, even tho' it was worth my preſerving.'</q> And ſo ſaying, he immediately ſtruck into the different Road from that which the Squire had taken, and, by mere Chance, purſued the very ſame thro' which <hi>Sophia</hi> had before paſſed.</p>
               <p>Our Travellers now marched a full Mile, without ſpeaking a Syllable to each other, tho' <hi>Jones,</hi> indeed, muttered many things to himſelf; as to <hi>Partridge,</hi> he was profoundly ſilent: For he was not, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, perfectly recovered from his former Fright; beſides, he had Apprehenſions of provoking his Friend to a ſecond Fit of Wrath; eſpecially as he now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to entertain a Conceit, which may not, perhaps, create any great Wonder in the Reader. In ſhort, he began now to ſuſpect that <hi>Jones</hi> was abſolutely out of his Senſes.</p>
               <p>At length <hi>Jones</hi> being weary of Soliloquy, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed himſelf to his Companion, and blamed him for his Taciturnity: For which the poor Man very honeſtly accounted, from his Fear of giving Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. And now this Fear being pretty well removed, by the moſt abſolute Promiſes of Indemnity, <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradge</hi>

again took the Bridle from his Tongue; which perheps, rejoiced no leſs at regaining its Liberty, than a young Colt, when the Bridle is ſlipt from his Neck, and he is turned looſe into the Paſtures.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Partridge</hi> was inhibited from that Topic which would have firſt ſuggeſted itſelf, he fell upon that which was next uppermoſt in his Mind, namely, the Man of the Hill. <q rend="inline">'Certainly, Sir, ſays he, that could never be a Man, who dreſſes himſelf, and lives after ſuch a ſtrange Manner, and ſo unlike other Folks. Beſides his Diet, as the old Woman told me, is chiefly upon Herbs, which is a fitter Food for a Horſe than a Chriſtian: Nay, Landlord at <hi>Upton</hi> ſays, that the Neighbours thereabouts have very fearful Notions about him. It runs ſtrangely in my Head, that it muſt have been ſome Spirit, who, perhaps, might be ſent to forewarn us: And who knows, but all that Matter which he told us, of his going to Fight, and of his being taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, and of the great Danger he was in of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hanged, might be intended as a Warning to us, conſidering what we are going about: Beſides, I dreamt of nothing all laſt Night, but of Fighting; and methought the Blood ran out of my Noſe, as Liquor out of a Tap.

                  <hi>Jones</hi> preſently opened it, and (gueſs, Reader, what he felt,) ſaw in the firſt Page the Words <hi>Sophia Weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern,</hi> written by her own fair Hand. He no ſooner read the Name, than he preſt it cloſe to his Lips; nor could he avoid falling into ſome very frantick Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:0618300102:365"/>
notwitſtanding his Company; but, perhaps, theſe very Raptures made him forget he was not alone.</p>
               <p>While <hi>Jones</hi> was kiſſing and mumbling the Book, as if he had an Excellent brown butter'd Cruſt in his Mouth, or as if he had been really a Bookworm, or an Author, who hath nothing to eat but his own Works, a Piece of Paper fell from its Leaves to the Ground, which <hi>Partridge</hi> took up, and delivered to <hi>Jones,</hi> who preſently perceived it to be a Bank-bill. It was, indeed, the very Bill which <hi>Weſtern</hi> had given his Daughter, the Night before her Departure; and a <hi>Jew</hi> would have jumped to purchaſe it at five Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>llngs leſs than <hi>100l.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Eyes of <hi>Partridge</hi> ſparkled at this News, which <hi>Jones</hi> now proclaimed aloud; and ſo did (tho' with ſomewhat a different Aſpect) thoſe of the poor Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low who had found the Book; and who (I hope from a Principle of Honeſty) had never opened it: But we ſhould not deal honeſtly by the Reader, if we omitted to inform him of a Circumſtance, which may be here a little material, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Fellow could not read.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones,</hi> who had felt nothing but pure Joy and Tranſport from the finding the Book, was affected with a Mixture of Concern at this new Diſcovery: For his Imagination inſtantly ſuggeſted to him, that the Owner of the Bill might poſſibly want it, before he could be able to convey it to her. He then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the Finder, that he knew the Lady to whom the Book belonged, and would endeavour to find her out as ſoon as poſſible, and return it her.</p>
               <p>The Pocket-Book was a late Preſent from Mrs. <hi>Weſtern</hi> to her Neice: It had coſt five and twenty Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, having been bought of a celebrated Toyman, but the real Value of the Silver, which it contained in its claſp, was about <hi>18d.</hi> and that Price the ſaid
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:0618300102:366"/>
Toyman, as it was altogether as good as when it firſt iſſued from his Shop, would now have given for it. A prudent Perſon would, however, have taken proper Advantage of the Ignorance of this Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and would not have offered more than a Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or perhaps Sixpence for it; nay, ſome perhaps would have given nothing, and left the Fellow to his Action of Trover, which ſome learned Serjeants may doubt whether he could, under theſe Circumſtances, have maintained.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones,</hi> on the contrary, whoſe Character was on the outſide of Generoſity, and may perhaps not very unjuſtly have been ſuſpected of Extravagance, without any Heſitation, gave a Guinea in Exchange for the Book. The poor man, who had not for a long Time before, been poſſeſſed of ſo much Treaſure, gave Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> a thouſand Thanks, and diſcovered little leſs of Tranſport in his Muſcles, than <hi>Jones</hi> had before ſhewn, when he had firſt read the Name of <hi>Sophia Weſtern.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Fellow very readily agreed to attend our Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers to the Place where he had found the Pocket-Book. Together, therefore, they proceeded direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thither; but not ſo faſt as Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> deſired; for his Guide unfortunately happened to be lame, and could not poſſibly travel faſter than a Mile an Hour. As this Place, therefore, was at above three Miles Diſtance, though the Fellow had ſaid otherwiſe, the Reader need not be acquainted how long they were in walking it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> opened the Book a hundred Times during their Walk, kiſſed it as often, talked much to himſelf, and very little to his Companions. At all which the Guide expreſt ſome Signs of Aſtoniſhment to <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge;</hi> who more than once ſhook his Head, and cry'd, poor Gentleman! <hi>orandum eſt ut ſit mens ſana in corpore ſano</hi>

                  <pb n="358" facs="tcp:0618300102:367"/>
At length, they arrived at the very Spot, where <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia</hi> unhappily dropt the Pocket-Book, and where the Fellow had as happily found it. Here <hi>Jones</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to take Leave of his Guide, and to improve his Pace; but the Fellow, in whom that violent Surprize and Joy which the firſt Receipt of the Guinea had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned, was now conſiderably abated, and who had now had ſufficient Time to recollect himſelf, put on a diſcontented Look, and, ſcratching his Head, ſaid, <q rend="inline">'He hoped his Worſhip would give him ſomething more. Your Worſhip,' ſaid he, 'will, I hope, take it into your Conſideration, that if I had not been honeſt I might have kept the Whole.'</q> And, indeed, this the Reader muſt confeſs to have been true. <q rend="inline">'If the Paper there, ſaid he, be worth <hi>100l.</hi> I am ſure the finding it deſerves more than a Guinea. Beſides, ſuppoſe your Worſhip ſhould never ſee the Lady, nor give it her—and though your Worſhip looks and talks very much like a Gentleman, yet I have only your Worſhip's bare Word: And, certainly, if the right Owner ben't to be found, it all belongs to the firſt Finder. I hope your Worſhip will conſider all theſe Matters. I am but a poor Man, and therefore don't deſire to have all; but it is but reaſonable I ſhould have my Share.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'Your Worſhip looks like a good Man, and I hope, will conſider my Honeſty: For I might have kept every Farthing, and no Body ever the wiſer.' I promiſe thee, upon my Honour,' cries <hi>Jones,</hi> that I know the right Owner, and will reſtore it her.' Nay, your Worſhip,' anſwered the Fellow, 'may do as you pleaſe as to that, if you will but give me my Share, that is one half of the Money, your Honour may keep the reſt yourſelf if you pleaſe;'</q> and concluded with ſwearing by a very vehement Oath, <q rend="inline">'that he would never mention a Syllable of it to any Man living.'</q>

               <p>

                     <pb n="359" facs="tcp:0618300102:368"/>
'Lookee, Friend, cries <hi>Jones,</hi> the right Owner ſhall certainly have again all that ſhe loſt; and as for any further Gratuity, I really cannot give it you at preſent; but let me know your Name, and where you live, and it is more than poſſible, you may hereafter have further Reaſon to rejoice at this Morning's Adventure.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'I don't know what you mean by Venture,' cries the Fellow; it ſeems, I muſt venture whether you will return the Lady her Money or no: But I hope your Worſhip will conſider—Come, come, ſaid <hi>Partridge,</hi> tell his Honour your Name, and where you may be found; I warrant you will never repent having put the Money into his Hands.'</q> The Fellow ſeeing no Hopes of recovering the Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Pocket-Book, at laſt complied in giving in his Name and Place of Abode, which <hi>Jones</hi> writ upon a Piece of Paper with the Pencil of <hi>Sophia;</hi> and then placing the Paper in the ſame Page where ſhe had writ her Name, he cry'd out: <q rend="inline">'There, Friend, you are the happieſt Man alive, I have joined your Name to that of an Angel.' 'I don't know any Thing about Angels,' anſwered the Fellow; 'but I wiſh you would give me a little more Money, or elſe return me the Pocket-Book.'</q> 
                  <hi>Partridge</hi> now waxed wroth; he called the poor Cripple by ſeveral vile and opprobrious Names, and was abſolutely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to beat him, but <hi>Jones</hi> would not ſuffer any ſuch Thing: And now telling the Fellow he would certainly find ſome Opportunity of ſerving him, Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> departed as faſt as his Heels would carry him; and <hi>Partridge,</hi> into whom the Thoughts of the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pound had infuſed new Spirits, followed his Leader; while the Man who was obliged to ſtay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, fell to curſing them both, as well as his Parents; <q rend="inline">'For had they, ſays he, ſent me to Charity School to learn to write and read and caſt Account, I ſhould

               <p>OUR Travellers now walked ſo faſt, that they had very little Time or Breath for Converſation; <hi>Jones</hi> meditating all the Way on <hi>Sophia,</hi> and <hi>Partridge</hi> on the Bank-Bill, which though it gave him ſome Pleaſure, cauſed him at the ſame Time to repine at Fortune, which, in all his Walks, had never given him ſuch an Opportunity of ſhewing his Honeſty, They had proceeded above three Miles, when <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge</hi> being unable any longer to keep up with <hi>Jones,</hi> called to him, and begged him a little to ſlacken his Pace; with this he was the more ready to comply, as he had for ſome Time loſt the Footſteps of the Horſes, which the Thaw had enabled him to trace during ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Miles, and he was now upon a wide Common where were ſeveral Roads.</p>
               <p>He here therefore ſtopt to conſider which of theſe Roads he ſhould purſue, when on a ſudden they heard the Noiſe of a Drum that ſeemed at no great Diſtance. This Sound preſently alarmed the Fears of <hi>Partridge,</hi> and he cried out, 'Lord have Mercy upon us all; 'they are certainly a coming!' 'Who is coming?' cries <hi>Jones,</hi> for Fear had long ſince given Place to ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ideas in his Mind, and ſince his Adventure with the lame Man, he had been totally intent on purſuing <hi>Sophia,</hi> without entertaining one Thought of an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. 'Who?' cries <hi>Partridge,</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">'why the Rebels; but why ſhould I call them Rebels, they may be very honeſt Gentlemen, for any thing I know to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.

<pb n="361" facs="tcp:0618300102:370"/>
For Heaven's Sake, Sir, don't affront them if they ſhould come, and perhaps they may do us no Harm; but would it not be the wiſer Way to creep into ſome of yonder Buſhes till they are gone by? What can two unarmed Men do perhaps againſt fifty thouſand? Certainly nobody but a Madman; I hope your Honour is not offended: but certainly no Man who hath <hi>Mens ſana in Corpore ſano'</hi>
                  </q>—Here <hi>Jones</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted this Torrent of Eloquence, which Fear had inſpired, ſaying, <q rend="inline">'That by the Drum he perceived they were near ſome Town.'</q> He then made di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly towards the Place whence the Noiſe proceeded, bidding <hi>Partridge</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Partridge</hi> was a little comforted with this laſt Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance; and though he would more gladly have gone the contrary Way, he followed his Leader, his Heart beating Time, but not after the Manner of Heroes, to the Muſic of the Drum, which ceaſed not till they had traverſed the Common, and were come into a narrow Lane.</p>
               <p>And now <hi>Partridge,</hi> who kept even Pace with <hi>Jones,</hi> diſcovered ſomething painted flying in the Air, very few Yards before him, which fancying to be the Colours of the Enemy, he fell a bellowing, 'O Lord Sir, here they are, there is the Crown and Coffin. Oh Lord! I never ſaw any Thing ſo terrible; and we are within Gun ſhot of them already.'</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> no ſooner looked up than he plainly perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what it was which <hi>Partridge</hi> had thus miſtaken. <hi>Partridge,'</hi> ſays he, 'I fancy you will be able to engage this whole Army yourſelf; for by the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours I gueſs what the Drum was which we heard before, and which beats up for Recruits to a Pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet-ſhow.</p>

               </p>
               <p>They now arrived at an Inn, or indeed an Alehouſe, where <hi>Jones</hi> was prevailed upon to ſtop, the rather as he had no longer any Aſſurance of being in the Road he deſired. They walked both directly into the Kitchen, where <hi>Jones</hi> began to enquire if no Ladies had paſſed that Way in the Morning, and <hi>Partridge</hi> as eagerly examined into the State of their Proviſions; and indeed his Enquiry met with the better Succeſs; for <hi>Jones</hi> could not hear News of <hi>Sophia;</hi> but <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge,</hi> to his great Satisfaction, found good Reaſon to expect very ſhortly the agreeable Sight of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſmoaking Diſh of Eggs and Bacon.</p>

                  </gap> juſt going to begin, and to which they were very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly invited by the Maſter of the ſaid Show, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:0618300102:372"/>
that his Figures were the fineſt which the World had ever produced, and that they had given great Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to all the Quality in every Town in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Puppet-ſhow was performed with great Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity and Decency. It was called the fine and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Part of the <hi>Provok'd Huſband;</hi> and it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a very grave and ſolemn Entertainment, without any low Wit or Humour, or Jeſts; or, to do it no more than Juſtice, without any thing which could provoke a Laugh. The Audience were all highly pleaſed. A grave Matron told the Maſter ſhe would bring her two Daughters the next Night, as he did not ſhew any Stuff; and an Attorney's Clerk, and an Exciſeman, both declared, that the Characters of Lord and Lady <hi>Townly</hi> were well preſerved, and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Nature. <hi>Partridge</hi> likewiſe concurred with this Opinion.</p>
               <p>The Maſter was ſo highly elated with theſe Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miums, that he could not refrain from adding ſome more of his own. He ſaid, <q rend="inline">'The preſent Age was not improved in any Thing ſo much as in their Puppet-ſhows; which, by throwing out Punch and his Wife <hi>Joan,</hi> and ſuch idle Trumpery, were at laſt brought to be a rational Entertainment. I remember,' ſaid he, 'when I firſt took to the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, there was a great deal of low Stuff that did very well to make Folks laugh; but was never cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to improve the Morals of young People, which certainly ought to be principally aimed at in every Puppet-ſhow: For why may not good and inſtructive Leſſons be conveyed this Way, as well as any other? My Figures are as big as the Life, and they repreſent the Life in every particular; and I queſtion not but People riſe from my little <hi>Drama</hi> as much improved as they do from the great. I would by no Means degrade the Ingenuity of your

Profeſſion, anſwered <hi>Jones;</hi> but I ſhould have been glad to have ſeen my old Acquaintance Maſter <hi>Punch</hi> for all that; and ſo far from improving, I think, by leaving out him and his merry Wife <hi>Joan,</hi> you have ſpoiled your Puppet-ſhow.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Dancer of Wires conceived an immediate and high Contempt for <hi>Jones,</hi> from theſe Words. And with much Diſdain in his Countenance, he replied, <q rend="inline">'Very probably, Sir, that may be your Opinion; but I have the Satisfaction to know the beſt Judges differ from you, and it is impoſſible to pleaſe every Taſte. I confeſs, indeed, ſome of the Quality at <hi>Bath,</hi> two or three Years ago, wanted mightily to bring Punch again upon the Stage. I believe I loſt ſome Money for not agreeing to it; but let others do as they will, a little Matter ſhall never bribe me to degrade my own Profeſſion, nor will I ever wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly conſent to the ſpoiling the Decency and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity of my Stage, by introducing any ſuch low Stuff upon it.'</q>

               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'Right, Friend, cries the Clerk, you are very right. Always avoid what is low. There are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of my Acquaintance in <hi>London,</hi> who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to drive every Thing which is low from the Stage.'</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">'Nothing can be more proper,' cries the Exciſeman, pulling his Pipe from his Mouth. 'I remember, added he, (for I then lived with my Lord) I was in the Footman's Gallery, the Night when this Play of the Provok'd Huſband was acted firſt. There was a great deal of low Stuff in it about a Country Gentleman come up to Town to ſtand for Parliament Man; and there they brought a Parcel of his Servants upon the Stage, his Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man I remember particularly; but the Gentlemen in our Gallery could not bear any thing ſo low, and they damned it.

                  <hi>Virgil,</hi> I think, tells us, that when the Mob are aſſembled in a riotous and tumultuous Manner, and all Sorts of miſſible Weapons fly about, if a Man of Gravity and Authority appears amongſt them, the Tumult is preſently appeaſed, and the Mob, which when collected into one Body, may be well compared to an Aſs, erect their long Ears at the grave Man's Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, when a Set of grave Men and Philoſophers are diſputing; when Wiſdom herſelf may in a Manner be conſidered as preſent, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring Arguments to the Diſputants, ſhould a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult ariſe among the Mob, or ſhould one Scold who
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:0618300102:376"/>
is herſelf equal in Noiſe to a mighty Mob, appear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ſaid Philoſophers; their Diſputes ceaſe in a Moment, Wiſdom no longer performs her miniſterial Office, and the Attention of every one is immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attracted by the Scold alone.</p>
               <p>Thus the Uproar aforeſaid, and the Arrival of the Landlady, ſilenced the Maſter of the Puppet-ſhew, and put a ſpeedy and final End to that grave and ſolemn Harangue, of which we have given the Reader a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Taſte already. Nothing indeed could have happened ſo very inopportune as this Accident; the moſt wanton Malice of Fortune could not have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived ſuch another Stratagem to confound the poor Fellow, while he was ſo triumphantly deſcanting on the good Morals inculcated by his Exhibitions. His Mouth was now as effectually ſtopt, as that of a Quack muſt be, if in the Midſt of a Declamation on the great Virtues of his Pills and Powders, the Corpſe of one of his Martyrs ſhould be brought forth, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited before the Stage, as a Teſtimony of his Skill.</p>
               <p>Inſtead, therefore, of anſwering my Landlady, the Puppet-ſhow Man ran out to puniſh his <hi>Merry An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew;</hi> and now the Moon beginning to put forth her Silver Light, as the Poets call it (tho' ſhe looked at that Time more like a Piece of Copper) <hi>Jones</hi> called for his Reckoning, and ordered <hi>Partridge,</hi> whom my Landlady had juſt awaked from a profound Nap, to prepare for his Journey; but <hi>Partridge</hi> having lately carried two Points, as my Reader hath ſeen before, was emboldened to attempt a third, which was to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with <hi>Jones</hi> to take up a Lodging that Evening in the Houſe where he then was. He introduced this with an affected Surprize at the Intention which Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> declared of removing; and after urging many excellent Arguments againſt it, he at laſt inſiſted ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it could be to no manner of Purpoſe whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: For that unleſs <hi>Jones</hi> knew which Way the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was gone, every Step he took might very poſſibly
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:0618300102:377"/>
lead him the farther from her; <q rend="inline">'for you find Sir, ſaid he, by all the People in the Houſe, that ſhe is not gone this Way. How much better, therefore, would it be to ſtay till the Moraing, when we may expect to meet with Some-body to enquire of?'</q>
               </p>
               <p>This laſt Argument had indeed ſome Effect on <hi>Jones,</hi> and while he was weighing it, the Landlord threw all the Rhetoric of which he was Maſter into the ſame Scale. <q rend="inline">'Sure, Sir, ſaid he, your Servant gives you moſt excellent Advice: For who would travel by Night at this Time of the Year?'</q> He then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in the uſual Stile to trumpet forth the excellent Accommodation which his Houſe afforded; and my Landlady likewiſe opened on the Occaſion—But not to detain the Reader with what is common to every Hoſt and Hoſteſs, it is ſufficient to tell him, <hi>Jones</hi> was at laſt prevailed on to ſtay and refreſh himſelf with a few Hours Reſt, which indeed he very much wanted; for he had hardly ſhut his Eyes ſince he had left the Inn where the Accident of the broken Head had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as <hi>Jones</hi> had taken a Reſolution to proceed no farther that Night, he preſently retired to Reſt, with his two Bed-fellows the Pocket-Book, and the Muff; but <hi>Partridge,</hi> who at ſeveral Times had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed himſelf with ſeveral Naps, was more inclined to Eating than to Sleeping, and more to Drinking than to either.</p>
               <p>And now the Storm which <hi>Grace</hi> had raiſed being at an End, and my Landlady being again reconciled to the Puppet-man, who on his Side forgave the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent Reflection which the good Woman in her Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion had caſt on his Performances, a Face of perfect Peace and Tranquillity reigned in the Kitchen; where there aſſembled round the Fire, the Landlord and Landlady of the Houſe, the Maſter of the Puppet-ſhow, the Attorney's Clerk, the Exciſeman, and the ingenious Mr. <hi>Partridge;</hi> in which Company paſt the
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:0618300102:378"/>
agreeable Converſation which will be found in the next Chapter.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="7" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>Containing a Remark or two of our own, and many more of the good Company aſſembled in the Kitchen.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THOUGH the Pride of <hi>Partridge</hi> did not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to acknowledge himſelf a Servant, yet he condeſcended in moſt Particulars to imitate the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of that Rank. One Inſtance of this was his greatly magnifying the Fortune of his Companion, as he called <hi>Jones:</hi> ſuch is a general Cuſtom with all Servants among Strangers, as none of them would willingly be thought the Attendent on a Beggar: For the higher the Situation of the Maſter is, the higher conſequently is that of the Man in his own Opinion; the Truth of which Obſervation appears from the Behaviour of all the Footmen of the Nobility.</p>
               <p>But tho' Title and Fortune communicate a Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor all around them, and the Footmen of Men of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and of Eſtate think themſelves entitled to a Part of that Reſpect which is paid to the Quality and Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of their Maſters; it is clearly otherwiſe with Regard to Virtue and Underſtanding. Theſe Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages are ſtrictly perſonal, and ſwallow themſelves all the Reſpect which is paid to them. To ſay the Truth, this is ſo very little, that they cannot well afford to let any others partake with them. As theſe therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect no Honour on the Domeſtic, ſo neither is he at all diſhonoured by the moſt deplorable Want of both in his Maſter. Indeed it is otherwiſe in the Want of what is called Virtue in a Miſtreſs, the Conſequence of which we have before ſeen: For in this Diſhonour there is a Kind of Contagion, which, like that of Poverty, communicates itſelf to all who approach it.</p>
               <p>Now for theſe Reaſons we are not to wonder that Servants (I mean among the Men only) ſhould have
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:0618300102:379"/>
ſo great Regard for the Reputation of the Wealth of their Maſters, and little or none at all for their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter in other Points, and that tho' they would be aſhamed to be the Footman of a Beggar, they are not ſo to attend upon a Rogue, or a Blockhead; and do conſequently make no Scruple to ſpread the Fame of the Iniquities and Follies of their ſaid Maſters as far as poſſible, and this often with great Humour and Merriment. In reality, a Footman is often a Wit, as well as a Beau, at the Expence of the Gentleman whoſe Livery he wears.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Partridge,</hi> therefore, had enlarged greatly on the vaſt Fortune to which Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> was Heir, he very freely communicated an Apprehenſion which he had begun to conceive the Day before, and for which, as we hinted at that very Time, the Behaviour of <hi>Jones</hi> ſeemed to have furniſhed a ſufficient Foundation. In ſhort, he was now pretty well confirmed in an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that his Maſter was out of his Wits, with which Opinion he very bluntly acquainted the good Company round the Fire.</p>
               <p>With this Sentiment the Puppet-ſhow Man imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately coincided. <q rend="inline">'I own, ſaid he, the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſurprized me very much, when he talked ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly about Puppet-ſhows. It is indeed hardly to be conceived that any Man in his Senſes ſhould be ſo much miſtaken; what you ſay now, accounts very well for all his monſtrous Notions. Poor Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, I am heartily concerned for him; indeed he hath a ſtrange Wildneſs about his Eyes, which I took Notice of before, tho' I did not mention it.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Landlord agreed with this laſt Aſſertion, and likewiſe claimed the Sagacity of having obſerved it. <q rend="inline">'And certainly, added he, it muſt be ſo: for no one but a Madman would have thought of leaving ſo good a Houſe, to ramble about the Country at that Time of Night.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="371" facs="tcp:0618300102:380"/>
The Exciſeman pulling his Pipe from his Mouth, ſaid, <q rend="inline"> 'He thought the Gentleman looked and talked a little wildly,' and then turning to <hi>Partridge,</hi> 'If he be a Madman, ſays he, he ſhould not be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to travel thus about the Country, for poſſibly he may do ſome Miſchief. It is Pity he was not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured and ſent home to his Relations.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now ſome Conceits of this Kind were likewiſe lurking in the Mind of <hi>Partridge:</hi> For as he was now perſuaded that <hi>Jones</hi> had run away from Mr. <hi>Allworthy,</hi> he promiſed himſelf the higheſt Rewards, if he could by any Means convey him back. But Fear of <hi>Jones,</hi> of whoſe Fierceneſs and Strength he had ſeen, and indeed felt ſome Inſtances, had however re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented any ſuch Scheme as impoſſible to be executed, and had diſcouraged him from applying himſelf to form any regular Plan for the Purpoſe. But no ſooner did he hear the Sentiments of the Exciſeman, than he embraced that Opportunity of declaring his own, and expreſſed a hearty Wiſh that ſuch a Matter could be brought about.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'Could be brought about? ſays the Exciſeman; why there is nothing eaſier.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'Ah! Sir, anſwered <hi>Partridge;</hi> you don't know what a Devil of a Fellow he is. He can take me up with one Hand, and throw me out at Window, and he would too, if he did but ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine—'</q>
               </p>
               <p>'Pogh!' ſays the Exciſeman. <q rend="inline">'I believe I am as good a Man as he.'</q> Beſides here are five of us.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'I don't know what five,' cries the Landlady, 'my Huſband ſhall have nothing to do in it. Nor ſhall any violent Hands be laid upon any Body in my Houſe. The young Gentleman is as pretty a young Gentleman as ever I ſaw in my Life, and I believe he is no more mad than any of us. What do you tell of his having a wild Look with his Eyes? They are the prettieſt Eyes I ever ſaw, and he hath the

What the Devil would the Lady have better than ſuch a handſome Man with a great Eſtate?

               <p>The Attorney's Clerk likewiſe declared he would have no Concern in the Buſineſs, without the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Council. <q rend="inline">'Suppoſe, ſyas he, an Action of falſe Impriſonment ſhould be brought againſt us, what Defence could we make? Who knows what may be ſufficient Evidence of Madneſs to a Jury? But I only ſpeak upon my own Account; for it don't look well for a Lawyer to be concerned in theſe Matters, unleſs it be as a Lawyer. Juries are always leſs favourable to us than to other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. I don't therefore diſſuade you Mr. <hi>Thompſon</hi> (to the Exciſeman) nor the Gentleman, nor any Body elſe.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Exciſeman ſhook his Head at this Speech, and the Puppet-ſhow-Man ſaid, <q rend="inline">'Madneſs was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a difficult Matter for a Jury to decide: For I remember,' ſays he, 'I was once preſent at a Trial of Madneſs, where twenty Witneſſes ſwore that the Perſon was as mad as a <hi>March</hi> Hare; and twenty others, that he was as much in his Senſes as any Man in <hi>England.—</hi>And indeed it was the Opinion of moſt People, that it was only a Trick of his Relations to rob the poor Man of his Right.'</q>

                  <q rend="inline">'Very likely! cries the Landlady, I myſelf knew a poor Gentleman who was kept in a Mad-houſe all his Life by his Family, and they enjoyed his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,

               <p>But tho' the Merry Andrew was a little Fellow, and not very ſtrong, he had nevertheleſs ſome Choler about him.

               <p>When this was happily accompliſhed, he ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and was by the truſty Merry Andrew conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Spot where <hi>Sophia</hi> had paſt; and then having handſomely rewarded his Conductor, he again puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on with the utmoſt eagerneſs, being highly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with the extraordinary Manner in which he received his Intelligence. Of this <hi>Partridge</hi> was no ſooner acquainted, than he, with great Earneſtneſs, began to propheſy, and aſſured <hi>Jones,</hi> that he would certainly have good Succeſs in the End: For, he ſaid, 'two ſuch Accidents could never have happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 'to direct him after his Miſtreſs, if Providence 'had not deſigned to bring them together at laſt.' And this was the firſt Time that <hi>Jones</hi> lent Attention to the Superſtitious Doctrines of his Companion.</p>
               <p>They had not gone above two Miles, when a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Storm of Rain overtook them, and as they happened to be at the ſame Time in Sight of an Alehouſe, <hi>Partridge,</hi> with much earneſt Entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, prevailed with <hi>Jones</hi> to enter, and Weather the Storm.</p>
               <p>Hunger is an Enemy (if indeed it may be called one) which partakes more of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> than of the <hi>French</hi> Diſpoſition; for tho' you ſubdue this never ſo often, it will always rally again in Time; and ſo it did with <hi>Partridge,</hi> who was no ſooner arrived within the Kitchen, than he began to aſk the ſame Queſtions which he had aſked the Night before. The Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this was an excellent cold Chine being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced upon the Table, upon which not only <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge,</hi> but <hi>Jones</hi> himſelf, made a very hearty Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, tho' the latter began to grow again uneaſy, as
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:0618300102:387"/>
the People of the Houſe could give him no freſh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation concerning <hi>Sophia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their Meal being over, <hi>Jones</hi> was again preparing to ſally, notwithſtanding the Violence of the Storm ſtill continued; but <hi>Partridge</hi> begged heartily for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mugg, and at length caſting his Eyes on a Lad at the Fire, who had entered into the Kitchen, and who at that Inſtant was looking as earneſtly at him, he turned ſuddenly to <hi>Jones,</hi> and cried, <q rend="inline">'Maſter, give me your Hand, a ſingle Mugg ſhan't ſerve the Turn this Bout. Why here's more News of Madam <hi>Sophia</hi> come to Town. The Boy there ſtanding by the Fire is the very Lad that rid before her. I can ſwear to my own Plaiſter on his Face. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens bleſs you, Sir, cries the Boy, it is your own Plaiſter ſure enough; I ſhall have always Reaſon to remember your Goodneſs; for it hath almoſt cured me.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>At theſe Words <hi>Jones</hi> ſtarted from his Chair, and bidding the Boy follow him immediately, departed from the Kitchen into a private Apartment; for ſo delicate was he with regard to <hi>Sophia,</hi> that he never willingly mentioned her Name in the Preſence of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny People; and tho' he had, as it were, from the Overflowings of his Heart, given <hi>Sophia</hi> as a Toaſt among the Officers, where he thought it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible ſhe ſhould be known; yet even there the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may remember how difficultly he was prevailed upon to mention her Sir-name.</p>
               <p>Hard therefore was it, and perhaps in the Opinion of many ſagacious Readers, very abſurd and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous, that he ſhould principally owe his preſent Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune to the ſuppoſed Want of that Delicacy with which he ſo abounded; for in reality <hi>Sophia</hi> was much more offended at the Freedoms which ſhe thought, and not without good Reaſon, he had taken with her Name and Character, than any Freedoms, in which, under his preſent Circumſtances, he had
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:0618300102:388"/>
indulged himſelf with the Perſon of another Woman; and to ſay Truth, I believe <hi>Honour</hi> would never have prevailed on her to leave <hi>Upton</hi> without ſeeing her <hi>Jones,</hi> had it not been for thoſe two ſtrong Inſtances of a Levity in his Behaviour, ſo void of all Reſpect, and indeed ſo highly inconſiſtent with any Degree of Love and Tenderneſs in great and delicate Minds.</p>
               <p>But ſo Matters fell out, and ſo I muſt relate them; and if any Reader is ſhocked at their appearing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, I cannot help it. I muſt remind ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that I am not writing a Syſtem, but a Hiſtory, and I am not obliged to reconcile every Matter to the received Notions concerning Truth and Nature. But if this was never ſo eaſy to do, perhaps it might be more prudent in me to avoid it. For Inſtance, as the Fact at preſent before us now ſtands, without any Comment of mine upon it, tho' it may at firſt Sight offend ſome Readers, yet upon more mature Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, it muſt pleaſe all; for wiſe and good Men may conſider what happened to <hi>Jones</hi> at <hi>Upton</hi> as a juſt Puniſhment for his Wickedneſs, with Regard to Women, of which it was indeed the immediate Conſequence; and ſilly and bad perſons may comfort themſelves in their Vices, by flattering their own Hearts that the Characters of Men are rather owing to Accident than to Virtue. Now perhaps the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections which we ſhould be here inclined to draw, would alike contradict both theſe Concluſions, and would ſhew that theſe Incidents contribute only to confirm the great, uſeful and uncommon Doctrine, which it is the Purpoſe of this whole Work to incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and which we muſt not fill up our Pages by frequently repeating, as an ordinary Parſon fills his Sermon by repeating his Text at the End of every Paragraph.</p>
               <p>We are contented that it muſt appear, however unhappily <hi>Sophia</hi> had erred in her Opinion of <hi>Jones,</hi>
                  <pb n="380" facs="tcp:0618300102:389"/>
ſhe had ſufficient Reaſon for her Opinion; ſince, I believe, every other young-Lady would, in her Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, have erred in the ſame Manner. Nay, had ſhe followed her Lover at this very Time, and had entered this very Alehouſe the Moment he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from it, ſhe would have found the Landlord as well acquainted with her Name and Perſon as the Wench at <hi>Upton</hi> had appeared to be. For while <hi>Jones</hi> was examining his Boy in Whiſpers in an inner Room, <hi>Partridge,</hi> who had no ſuch Delicacy in his Diſpoſition, was in the Kitchen very openly cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſing the other Guide who attended Mrs. <hi>Fitzpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick;</hi> by which Means the Landlord, whoſe Ears were open enough on all ſuch Occaſions, became perfectly well acquainted with the Tumble of <hi>Sophia</hi> from her Horſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with the Miſtake concerning <hi>Jenny Cameron,</hi> with the many Conſequences of the Punch, and, in ſhort, with almoſt every thing which had happened at the Inn, whence we diſpatched our Ladies in a Coach and Six, when we laſt took our Leaves of them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>JONES</hi> had been abſent a full half Hour, when he returned into the Kitchen in a Hurry, deſiring the Landlord to let him know that Inſtant what was to pay. And now the Concern which <hi>Partridge</hi> felt at being obliged to quit a warm Chimney-corner, and a Cup of excellent Liquor, was ſomewhat compenſated by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was to proceed no farther on Foot; for <hi>Jones,</hi> by Golden Arguments, had prevailed with the Boy to attend him back to the Inn whither he had before conducted <hi>Sophia;</hi> but to this however the Lad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, upon Condition that the other Guide would wait for him at the Alehouſe; becauſe, as the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord at <hi>Upton</hi> was an intimate Acquaintance of the
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:0618300102:390"/>
Landlord at <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> it might ſome Time or other come to the Ears of the latter, that his Horſes had been let to more than one Perſon, and ſo the Boy might be brought to Account for Money which he wiſely intended to put in his own Pocket.</p>
               <p>We were obliged to mention this Circumſtance, trifling as it may ſeem, ſince it retarded Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> a conſiderable Time in his ſetting out; for the honeſty of this latter Boy was ſomewhat high—that is, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what high-priced, and would indeed have coſt <hi>Jones</hi> very dear, had not <hi>Partridge,</hi> who, as we have ſaid, was a very cunning Fellow, artfully thrown in half a Crown to be ſpent at that very Alehouſe, while the Boy was waiting for his Companion. This half Crown the Landlord no ſooner got Scent of, than he opened after it with ſuch vehement and perſuaſive Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry, that the Boy was ſoon overcome, and conſented to take half a Crown more for his Stay. Here we cannot help obſerving, that as there is ſo much of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy in the loweſt Life, great Men often overvalue themſelves on thoſe Refinements in Impoſture, in which they are frequently excelled by ſome of the loweſt of the Human Species.</p>
               <p>The Horſes being now produced, <hi>Jones</hi> directly leapt into the Side-Saddle, on which his dear <hi>Sophia</hi> had rid. The Lad indeed very civilly offered him, the Uſe of his; but he choſe the Side-Saddle, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably becauſe it was ſofter. <hi>Partridge,</hi> however, tho' full as effeminate as <hi>Jones,</hi> could not bear the Thoughts of degrading his Manhood, he therefore accepted the Boy's offer; and now <hi>Jones,</hi> being mounted on the Side-Saddle of his <hi>Sophia,</hi> the Boy on that of Mrs. <hi>Honour,</hi> and <hi>Partridge</hi> beſtriding the third Horſe, they ſet forwards on their Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and within four Hours arrived at the Inn where the Reader hath already ſpent ſo much Time. <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge</hi> was in very high Spirits during the whole
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:0618300102:391"/>
Way, and often mentioned to <hi>Jones</hi> the many good Omens of his future Succeſs, which had lately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friended him; and which the Reader, without being the leaſt ſuperſtitious, muſt allow to have been pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly fortunate. <hi>Partridge</hi> was moreover better pleaſed with the preſent Purſuit of his Companion, than he had been with his Purſuit of Glory; and from theſe very Omens, which aſſured the Pedagogue of Succeſs, he likewiſe firſt acquired a clear Idea of the Amour between <hi>Jones</hi> and <hi>Sophia;</hi> to which he had before given very little Attention, as he had ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally taken a wrong Scent concerning the Reaſons of <hi>Jones</hi>'s Departure; and as to what happened at <hi>Upton,</hi> he was too much frightened juſt before and after his leaving that Place, to draw any other Concluſions from thence, than that <hi>Jones</hi> was a downright Madman: A conceit which was not at all diſagreeable to the Opinion he before had of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Wildneſs, of which, he thought, his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour on their quitting <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> ſo well juſtified all the Accounts he had formerly received. He was how however pretty well ſatisfied with his preſent Expedition, and henceforth began to conceive much worthier Sentiments of his Friend's Underſtanding.</p>
               <p>The Clock had juſt ſtruck Three when they arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and <hi>Jones</hi> immediately beſpoke Poſt Horſes; but unluckily there was not a Horſe to be procured in the whole Place; which the Reader will not wonder at, when he conſiders the Hurry in which the whole Nation, and eſpecially this Part of it, was at this time engaged, when Expreſſes were paſſing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing every Hour of the Day and Night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> endeavoured all he could to prevail with his former Guide to eſcorte him to <hi>Coventry;</hi> but he was inexorable. While he was arguing with the Boy in the Inn-yard, a Perſon came up to him, and ſaluting him by his Name, enquired how all the good Family did in <hi>Somerſetſhire;</hi> and now <hi>Jones</hi> caſting his Eyes
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:0618300102:392"/>
upon this Perſon, preſently diſcovered him to be Mr. <hi>Dowling</hi> the Lawyer, with whom he had dined at <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> and with much Courteſy returned his Salutation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dowling</hi> very earneſtly preſſed Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> to go no further that Night; and backed his Solicitations with many unanſwerable Arguments, ſuch as, that it was almoſt dark, that the Roads were very dirty, and that he would be able to travel much better by Day-light, with many others equally good, ſome of which <hi>Jones</hi> had probably ſuggeſted to himſelf before; but as they were then ineffectual, ſo they were ſtill, and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued reſolute in his Deſign, even tho' he ſhould be obliged to ſet out on Foot.</p>
               <p>When the good Attorney found he could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail on <hi>Jones</hi> to ſtay, he as ſtrenuouſly applied himſelf to perſuade the Guide to accompany him. He urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many Motives to induce him to undertake this ſhort Journey, and at laſt concluded with ſaying, <q rend="inline">'Do you think the Gentleman won't very well reward you for your Trouble?'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Two to one are odds at every other thing, as well as at Foot-ball. But the Advantage which this united Force hath in Perſuaſion or Entreaty, muſt have been viſible to a curious Obſerver; for he muſt have often ſeen, that when a Father, a Maſter, a Wife, or any other Perſon in Authority, have ſtoutly adhered to a Denial againſt all the Reaſons which a ſingle Man could produce, they have afterwards yielded to the Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame Sentiments by a ſecond or third Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who hath undertaken the Cauſe without attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to advance any thing new in its Behalf. And hence perhaps proceeds the Phraſe of ſeconding an Argument or a Motion, and the great Conſequence of which this is in all Aſſemblies of public Debate. Hence likewiſe probably it is, that in our Courts of Law we often hear a learned Gentleman (generally a Serjeant) repeating for an Hour together what another learned Gentleman who ſpoke before him had juſt been ſaying.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="384" facs="tcp:0618300102:393"/>
Inſtead of accounting for this, we ſhall proceed in our uſual Manner to exemplify it in the Conduct of the Lad above-mentioned, who ſubmitted to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions of Mr. <hi>Dowling,</hi> and promiſed once more to admit <hi>Jones</hi> into his Side-Saddle; but inſiſted on firſt giving the poor Creatures a good Bait, ſaying, they had travelled a great Ways, and been rid very hard. Indeed this Caution of the Boy was needleſs; for <hi>Jones,</hi> notwithſtanding his Hurry and Impatience, would have ordered this of himſelf; for he by no Means agreed with the Opinions of thoſe who conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Animals as mere Machines, and when they bury their Spurs in the Belly of their Horſe, imagine the Spur and the Horſe to have an equal Capacity of feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pain.</p>
               <p>While the Beaſts were eating their Corn, or rather were ſuppoſed to eat it; (for as the Boy was taking Care of himſelf in the Kitchen, the Oſtler took great Care that his Corn ſhould not be conſumed in the Stable) Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> at the earneſt Deſire of Mr. <hi>Dowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> accompanied that Gentleman into his Room, where they ſat down together over a Bottle of Wine.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Dowling</hi> was indeed very greatly affected with this Relation; for he had not diveſted himſelf of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity by being an Attorney. Indeed nothing is more unjuſt than to carry our Prejudices againſt a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion into private Life, and to borrow our Idea of a Man from our Opinion of his Calling. Habit, it is true, leſſens the Horror of thoſe Actions which the Profeſſion makes neceſſary, and conſequently habitual; but in all other Inſtances, Nature works in Men of all Profeſſions alike; nay, perhaps, even more ſtrongly with thoſe who give her, as it were, a Holiday, when they are following their ordinary Buſineſs. A Butcher, I make no doubt, would feel Compunction at the Slaughter of a fine Horſe; and though a Surgeon can conceive no Pain in cutting off a Limb, I have known him compaſſionate a Man in a Fit of the Gout. The common Hangman, who hath ſtretched the Neck of Hundreds, is known to have trembled at his firſt O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration on a Head: And the very Profeſſors of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Blood, who in their Trade of War butcher Thouſands, not only of their Fellow Profeſſors, but often of Women and Children, without Remorſe; even theſe, I ſay, in Times of Peace when Drums and Trumpets are laid aſide, often lay aſide all their Ferocity, and become very gentle Members of civil Society. In the ſame Manner an Attorney may feel all the Miſeries and Diſtreſſes of his Fellow Creatures, provided he happens not to be concerned againſt them.</p>

                  <hi>Jones,</hi> as the Reader knows, was yet unacquainted with the very black Colours in which he had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to Mr. <hi>Allworthy;</hi> and as to other Matters he did not ſhew them in the moſt diſadvantageous Light: For though he was unwilling to caſt any Blame on his former Friend and Patron, yet he was not very deſirous of heaping too much upon himſelf. <hi>Dowling</hi> therefore obſerved, and not without Reaſon, that very

               <head>CHAP. XI. <hi>The Diſaſters which befel</hi> Jones <hi>on his Departure for</hi> Coventry; <hi>with the ſage Remarks of</hi> Partridge.</head>
               <p>NO Road can be plainer than that from the Place they now were to <hi>Coventry;</hi> and though nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Jones</hi> nor <hi>Partridge,</hi> nor the Guide, had ever tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled it before, it would have been almoſt impoſſible to have miſſed their Way, had it not been for the two Reaſons mentioned in the Concluſion of the laſt Chapter.</p>
               <p>Theſe two Circumſtences, however, happening both unfortunately to intervene, our Travellers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated into a much leſs frequented Track; and after riding full Six miles, inſtead of arriving at the ſtately Spires of <hi>Coventry,</hi> they found themſelves ſtill in a very dirty Lane, where they ſaw no Symptoms of approaching the Suburbs of a large City.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> now declared that they muſt certainly have loſt their Way; but this the Guide inſiſted upon was impoſſible; a Word which, in common Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is often uſed not only to ſignify improbable, but often what is really very likely, and, ſometimes, what hath certainly happened: An hyperbolical Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:0618300102:400"/>
like that which is ſo frequently offered to the Words Infinite and Eternal; by the former of which it is uſual to expreſs a Diſtance of half a Yard; and by the latter, a Duration of five Minutes. And thus it is as uſual to aſſert the impoſſibility of loſing what is already actually loſt. This was, in fact, the Caſe at preſent: For notwithſtanding all the confident Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions of the Lad to the contrary, it is certain they were no more in the right Road to <hi>Coventry,</hi> than the fradulent, griping, cruel, canting Miſer is in the right Road to Heaven.</p>
               <p>It is not, perhaps, eaſy for a Reader who hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been in thoſe Circumſtances, to imagine the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror with which Darkneſs, Rain, and Wind fill Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who have loſt their Way in the Night; and who, conſequently, have not the pleaſant Proſpect of warm Fires, dry Cloaths, and other Refreſhments, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port their Minds in ſtruggling with the Inclemencies of the Weather. A very imperfect Idea of this Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror will, however, ſerve ſufficiently to account for the Conceits which now filled the Head of <hi>Partridge,</hi> and which we ſhall preſently be obliged to open.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> grew more and more poſitive that they were out of their Road; and the Boy himſelf, at laſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged he believed they were not in the right Road to <hi>Coventry;</hi> tho' he affirmed, at the ſame Time, it was impoſſible they ſhould have miſt the Way. But <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge</hi> was of a different Opinion. He ſaid, <q rend="inline">'When they firſt ſet out he imagined ſome Miſchief or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would happen.—Did not you obſerve, Sir,' ſaid he to <hi>Jones,</hi> that old Woman who ſtood at the Door juſt as you was taking Horſe? I wiſh you had given her a ſmall Matter, with all my Heart; for ſhe ſaid then you might repent it, and at that very Inſtant it began to rain, and the Wind hath conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued riſing ever ſince. Whatever ſome People may think, I am very certain it is in the Power of Witches to raiſe the Wind whenever they
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:0618300102:401"/>
pleaſe. I have ſeen it happen very often in my Time: And if ever I ſaw a Witch in all my Life, that old Woman was certainly one. I thought ſo to myſelf at that very Time; and if I had had any Halfpence in my Pocket, I would have given her ſome: For to be ſure it is always good to be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable to thoſe Sort of People, for Fear what may happen; and many a Perſon hath loſt his Cattle by ſaving a Halfpenny.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> tho' he was horridly vexed at the Delay which this Miſtake was likely to occaſion in his Journey, could not help ſmiling at the Superſtition of his Friend, whom an Accident now greatly confirmed in his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion. This was a Tumble from his Horſe; by which, however, he received no other Injury than what the Dirt conferred on his Cloaths.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Partridge</hi> had no ſooner recovered his Legs, than he appealed to his Fall, as concluſive Evidence of all he had aſſerted: But <hi>Jones,</hi> finding he was unhurt, anſwered with a Smile: <q rend="inline">'This Witch of yours, <hi>Partridge,</hi> is a moſt ungrateful Jade, and doth not, I find, diſtinguiſh her Friends from others in her Reſentment. If the old Lady had been angry with me for neglecting her, I don't ſee why ſhe ſhould tumble you from your Horſe, after all the Reſpect you have expreſſed for her.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'It is ill jeſting, cries <hi>Partridge,</hi> with People who have Power to do theſe Things; for they are often very malicious. I remember a Farrier, who provoked one of them, by aſking her when the Time ſhe had bargained with the Devil for would be out; and within three Months from that very Day one of his beſt Cows was drowned. Nor was ſhe ſatisfied with that; for a little Time after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he loſt a Barrel of Beſt-Drink: For the old Witch pulled out the Spicket, and let it run all over the Cellar, the very firſt Evening he had tapped it, to make merry with ſome of his Neighbours. In

ſhort, nothing ever thrived with him afterwards; for ſhe worried the poor Man ſo, that he took to Drinking; and in a Year or two his Stock was ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and he and his Family are now come to the Pariſh.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Guide, and perhaps his Horſe too, were both ſo attentive to this Diſcourſe, that, either thro' Want of Care, or by the Malice of the Witch, they were now both ſprawling in the Dirt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Partridge</hi> entirely imputed this Fall, as he had done his own, to the ſame Cauſe. He told Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">'it would certainly be his Turn next,' and earneſtly intreated him 'to return back, and find out the old Woman, and pacify her. We ſhall very ſoon, added he, reach the Inn: For tho' we have ſeemed to go forward, I am very certain we are in the identical Place in which we were an Hour ago; and I dare ſwear if it was Day-light, we might now ſee the Inn we ſet out from.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Inſtead of returning any Anſwer to this ſage Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, <hi>Jones</hi> was entirely attentive to what had happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Boy, who received no other Hurt than what had before befallen <hi>Pattridge,</hi> and which his Cloaths very eaſily bore, as they had been for many Years inured to the like. He ſoon regained his Side-Saddle, and, by the hearty Curſes and Blows which he beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on his Horſe, quickly ſatisfied Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> that no Harm was done.</p>

               <p>THEY now diſcovered a Light at ſome Diſtance, to the great Pleaſure of <hi>Jones,</hi> and to the no ſmall Terror of <hi>Partridge,</hi> who firmly believed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:0618300102:403"/>

               <p>But how were theſe Fears increaſed, when, as they approached nearer to this Light, (or Lights as they now appeared) they heard a confuſed Sound of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Voices; of ſinging, laughing, and hallowing, together with a ſtrange Noiſe that ſeemed to proceed from ſome Inſtruments; but could hardly be allowed the Name of Muſic. Indeed, to favour a little the Opinion of <hi>Partridge,</hi> it might very well be called Muſic bewitched.</p>
               <p>It is impoſſible to conceive a much greater Degree of Horror than what now ſeized on <hi>Partridge;</hi> the Contagion of which had reached the Poſt-boy; who had been very attentive to many Things that the other had uttered. He now therefore joined in petitioning <hi>Jones</hi> to return; ſaying he firmly believed what <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge</hi> had juſt before ſaid, that tho' the Horſes ſeemed to go on, they had not moved a Step forwards dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at leaſt the laſt half Hour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> could not help ſmiling in the midſt of his Vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, at the Fears of theſe poor Fellows. <q rend="inline">'Either we advance, ſays he, towards the Lights, or the Lights have advanced towards us; for we are now at a very little Diſtance from them; but how can either of you be afraid of a Set of People who appear only to be merry-making?'</q>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> put forwards as faſt as he could, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all theſe Hints and Cautions, and poor <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge</hi> was obliged to follow: For tho' he hardly dared advance, he dared ſtill leſs to ſtay behind by himſelf.</p>
               <p>At length they arrived at the Place whence the Lights and different Noiſes had iſſued. This <hi>Jones</hi> perceived to be no other than a Barn where a great Number of Men and Women were aſſembled, and were diverting themſelves with much apparent Jol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> no ſooner appeared before the great Doors of the Barn, which were open, than a maſculine and very rough Voice from within demanded who was there?—To which <hi>Jones</hi> gently anſwered, a Friend; and immediately aſked the Road to <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'If you are a Friend, cries another of the Men in the Barn, you had better alight till the Storm is over, (for indeed it was now more violent than ever) you are very welcome to put up your Horſe, for there is ſufficient Room for him at one End of the Barn.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'You are very obliging,' returned <hi>Jones;</hi> 'and I will accept your Offer for a few Minutes, whilſt the Rain continues; and here are two more who will be glad of the ſame Favour.'</q> This was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded

with more Good-will than it was accepted: For <hi>Partridge</hi> would rather have ſubmitted to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Inclemency of the Weather, than have truſted to the Clemency of thoſe whom he took for Hob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goblins; and the poor Poſt-boy was now infected with the ſame Apprehenſions; but they were both oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to follow the Example of <hi>Jones;</hi> the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he durſt not leave his Horſe, and the other becauſe he feared nothing ſo much as being left by himſelf.</p>
               <p>Had this Hiſtory been writ in the Days of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, I ſhould have had too much Compaſſion for the Reader to have left him ſo long in Suſpence, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Beelzebub</hi> or <hi>Satan</hi> was about actually to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in Perſon, with all his Helliſh Retinue; but as theſe Doctrines are at preſent very unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and have but few if any Believers, I have not been much aware of conveying any ſuch Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. To ſay Truth, the whole Furniture of the infernal Regions hath long been appropriated by the Managers of Playhouſes, who ſeem lately to have lain them by as Rubbiſh, capable only of affecting the Upper Gallery; a Place in which few of our Readers ever ſit.</p>
               <p>However, tho' we do not ſuſpect raiſing any great Terror on this Occaſion, we have Reaſon to fear ſome other Apprehenſions may ariſe in our Reader, into which we would not willingly betray him, I mean that we are going to take a Voyage into Fairy Land, and to introduce a Set of Beings into our Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, which ſcarce any one was ever childiſh enough to believe, tho' many have been fooliſh enough to ſpend their Time in writing and reading their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures.</p>
               <p>To prevent therefore any ſuch Suſpicions, ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the Credit of an Hiſtorian, who profeſſes to draw his Materials from Nature only, we ſhall now proceed to acquaint the Reader who theſe People were, whoſe ſudden Appearance had ſtruck ſuch Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors

into <hi>Partridge,</hi> had more than half frightened the Poſt-Boy, and had a little ſurprized even Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> himſelf.</p>
               <p>The People then aſſembled in this Barn were no other than a Company of <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> or as they are vulgarly called <hi>Gypſies,</hi> and they were now celebrating the Wedding of one of their Society.</p>
               <p>It is impoſſible to conceive a happier Set of People than appeared here to be met together. The utmoſt Mirth indeed ſhewed itſelf in every Countenance; nor was their Ball totally void of all Order and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum.

               <p>Greater Plenty likewiſe was no where to be ſeen, than what flouriſhed in this Barn. Here was indeed no Nicety nor Elegance, nor did the keen Appetite of the Gueſts require any. Here was good Store of Bacon, Fowls, and Mutton, to which every one preſent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided better Sauce himſelf, than the beſt and deareſt <hi>French</hi> Cook can prepare.</p>

               <p>than was our Heroe at what he ſaw in this Barn. While he was looking every where round him with Aſtoniſhment, a venerable Perſon approached him with many friendly Salutations, rather of too hearty a Kind to be called courtly. This was no other than the King of the <hi>Gypſies</hi> himſelf. He was very little diſtingniſhed in Dreſs from his Subjects, nor had he any <hi>Regalia</hi> of Majeſty to ſupport his Dignity; and yet there ſeemed (as Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> ſaid) to be ſomewhat in his Air which denoted Authority, and inſpired the Beholders with an Idea of Awe and Reſpect; tho'
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:0618300102:407"/>
all this was perhaps imaginary in <hi>Jones,</hi> and the Truth may be, that ſuch Ideas are incident to Power, and almoſt inſeparable from it.</p>
               <p>There was ſomewhat in the open Countenance and courteous Behaviour of <hi>Jones,</hi> which being acom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with much Comelineſs of Perſon, greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended him at firſt Sight to every Beholder. Theſe were perhaps a little heightened in the preſent Inſtance, by that profound Reſpect which he paid to the King of the <hi>Gypſies,</hi> the Moment he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his Dignity, and which was the ſweeter to his <hi>Gypſeian</hi> Majeſty, as he was not uſed to receive ſuch Homage from any but his own Subjects.</p>
               <p>The King ordered a Table to be ſpread with the choiceſt of their Proviſions for his Accommodation, and having placed himſelf at his Right Hand, his Majeſty began to diſcourſe our Heroe in the following Mannner:</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'Me doubt not, Sir, but you have often ſeen ſome of my People, who are what you call de Parties detache: For dey go about every where; but me fancy you imagine not we be ſo conſiderable Body as we be, and may be you will ſurpriſe more, when you hear de <hi>Gypſy</hi> be as orderly and well govern People as any upon Face of de Earth.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'Me have Honour, as me ſay, to be deir King, and no Monarch can do boaſt of more dutiful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, ne no more affectionate.

Me ſall no do boaſt of dat neider: For what can me do oderwiſe dan conſider of de Good of doſe poor People who go about all Day to give me always de beſt of what dey get. Dey love and honour me darefore, becauſe me do love and take Care of dem; dat is all, me know no oder Reaſon.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'About a touſand or two touſand Years ago, me cannot tell to a Year or two, as can neider write

nor read, there was a great what you call,—a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution among de <hi>Gypſy;</hi> for dere was de Lord <hi>Gypſy</hi> in doſe Days; and deſe Lord did quarrel vid one anoder about de Place; but de King of de <hi>Gypſy</hi> did demoliſh dem all, and made all his Subject equal vid each oder; and ſince dat time dey have agree very well: for dey no tink of being King, and may be it be better for dem as dey be: For me aſſure you it be ver troubleſome ting to be King, and always to do Juſtice; me have often wiſh to be de private <hi>Gypſy</hi> when me have been forced to puniſh my dear Friend and Relation; for dough we never put to Death, our Puniſhments be ver ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere.

               </p>
               <p>The King then proceeded to expreſs ſome Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that there was no ſuch Puniſhment as Shame in other Governments. Upon which <hi>Jones</hi> aſſured him to the contrary: For there were many Crimes for which Shame was inflicted by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Laws, and that it was indeed one Conſequence of all Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <q rend="inline">'Dat be ver ſtrange, ſaid the King: For me know and hears good deal of your People, dough me no live among dem, and me ave often hear dat Sham is de Conſequence and de Cauſe too of many your Rewards. Are your Rewards and Puniſhments den de ſame Ting?'</q>
               </p>
               <p>While his Majeſty was thus diſcourſing with <hi>Jones,</hi> a ſudden Uproar aroſe in the Barn, and as it ſeems, upon this Occaſion: The Curteſy of theſe People by Degrees had removed all Apprehenſions of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge,</hi> and he was prevailed upon not only to ſtuff himſelf with their Food, but to taſte ſome of their Liquors, which by Degrees entirely expelled all Fear from his Compoſition, and in its Stead introduced much more agreeable Senſations.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="400" facs="tcp:0618300102:409"/>
A young Female <hi>Gypſy,</hi> more remarkable for her Wit than her Beauty, had decoyed the honeſt Fellow aſide, pretending to tell his Fortune. Now when they were alone together in a remote Part of the Barn, whither it proceeded from the ſtrong Liquor, which is never ſo apt to inflame inordinate Deſire as after moderate Fatigue, or whither the fair <hi>Gypſy</hi> her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf threw aſide the Delicacy and Decency of her Sex, and tempted the Youth <hi>Partridge</hi> with expreſs Solicitations; but they were diſcovered in a very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper Manner by the Huſband of the <hi>Gypſy,</hi> who from Jealouſy, it ſeems, had kept a watchful Eye over his Wife, and had dogged her to the Place, where he found her in the Arms of her Gallant.</p>
               <p>To the great Coufuſion of <hi>Jones, Partridge</hi> was now hurried before the King; who heard the Accuſation, and likewiſe the Culprit's Defence, which was indeed very trifling: For the poor Fellow was confounded by the plain Evidence which appeared againſt him, and had very little to ſay for himſelf. His Majeſty then turning towards <hi>Jones,</hi> ſaid, <q rend="inline">'Sir, you have hear what dey ſay, what Puniſhment do you tink your Man deſerve?'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> anſwered, <q rend="inline">'He was ſorry for what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, and that <hi>Partridge</hi> ſhould make the Huſband all the Amends in his Power: He ſaid, he had ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little Money about him at that Time, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Hand into his Pocket, offered the Fellow a Guinea.'</q> To which he immediately anſwered, <q rend="inline">He hoped his Honour would not think of giving him leſs than five.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>This Sum after ſome Altercation was reduced to two, and <hi>Jones</hi> having ſtipulated for the full Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of both <hi>Partridge</hi> and the Wife, was going to pay the Money; when his Majeſty reſtraining his Hand, turned to the Witneſs, and aſked him, <q rend="inline">'At what Time he had diſcovered the Criminals?' To
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:0618300102:410"/>
which he anſwered, That he had been deſired by the Huſband to watch the Motions of his Wife from her firſt ſpeaking to the Stranger, and that he had never loſt Sight of her afterwards till the Crime had been committed.' The King then aſked, 'If the Huſband was with him all that Time in his lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Place?'</q> To which he anſwered in the Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. His <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Majeſty then addreſſed himſelf to the Huſband as follows, <q rend="inline">'Me be ſorry to ſee any <hi>Gypſy</hi> dat have no more Honour dan to ſell de Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Wife for Money.

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Gypſies</hi> immediately proceeded to execute the Sentence, and left <hi>Jones</hi> and <hi>Partridge</hi> alone with his Majeſty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> greatly applauded the Juſtice of the Sentence; upon which the King turning to him ſaid, <q rend="inline">'Me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you be ſurprize: For me ſuppoſe you have ver bad Opinion of my People; me ſuppoſe you tink us all de Tieves.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'I muſt confeſs, Sir," ſaid <hi>Jones,</hi> I have not heard ſo favourable an Account of them as they ſeem to deſerve.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'Me vil tell you,' ſaid the King, how the Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is between you and us. My People rob your People, and your People rob one anoder.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> afterwards proceeded very gravely to ſing forth the Happineſs of thoſe Subjects who lived under ſuch a Magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="402" facs="tcp:0618300102:411"/>
Indeed their Happineſs appears to have been ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, that we are aware leſt ſome Advocate for arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Power ſhould hereafter quote the Caſe of thoſe People, as an Inſtance of the great Advantages which attend that Government above all others.</p>
               <p>And here we will make a conceſſion, which would not perhaps have been expected from us, That no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Form of Government is capable of riſing to the ſame Degree of Perfection, or of producing the ſame Benefits to Society with this. Mankind have never been ſo happy, as when the greateſt Part of the then known World was under the Dominion of a ſingle Maſter; and this State of their Felicity continued during the Reigns of five ſucceſſive Princes <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Nerva, Trajan, Adrian,</hi> and the two <hi>Antonini.</hi>
                  </note>. This was the true Aera of the Golden Age, and the only Golden Age which ever had any Exiſtence, unleſs in the warm Imaginations of the Poets, from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion from <hi>Eden</hi> down to this Day.</p>
               <p>In reality, I know but of one ſolid Objection to abſolute Monarchy. The only Defect of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Conſtitution ſeems to be the Difficulty of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Man adequate to the Office of an abſolute Monarch: For this indiſpenſably requires three Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities very difficult, as it appears from Hiſtory, to be found in princely Natures: Firſt a ſufficient Quantity of Moderation in the Prince, to be contented with all the Power which is poſſible for him to have. 2dly, Enough of Wiſdom to know his own Happineſs. And, 3dly, Goodneſs ſufficient to ſupport the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of others, when not only compatible with, but inſtrumental to his own.</p>
               <p>Now if an abſolute Monarch with all theſe great and rare Qualifications ſhould be allowed capable of conferring the greateſt Good on Society, it muſt be ſurely granted, on the contrary, that abſolute Power veſted in the Hands of one who is deficient in them all, is likely to be attended with no leſs a Degree of Evil.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="403" facs="tcp:0618300102:412"/>
In ſhort our own Religion furniſhes us with ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate Ideas of the Bleſſing, as well as Curſe which may attend abſolute Power. The Pictures of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and of Hell will place a very lively Image of both before our Eyes: For though the Prince of the latter can have no Power, but what he originally derives from the omnipotent Sovereign in the former; yet it plainly appears from Scripture, that abſolute Power in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal Dominions, is granted to their Diabolical Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. This is indeed the only abſolute Power which can by Scripture be derived from Heaven. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſeveral Tyrannies upon Earth can prove any Title to a divine Authority, it muſt be derived from this original Grant to the Prince of Darkneſs, and theſe ſubordinate Deputations muſt conſequently come immediately from him whoſe Stamp they ſo expreſly bear.</p>
               <p>To conclude, as the Examples of all Ages ſhew us that Mankind in general deſire Power only to do Harm, and when they obtain it, uſe it for no other Purpoſe; it is not conſonant with even the leaſt Degree of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to hazard an Alteration, where our Hopes are poorly kept in Countenance by only two or three Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions out of a thouſand Inſtances to alarm our Fears. In this Caſe it will be much wiſer to ſubmit to a few Inconveniencies ariſing from the diſpaſſionate Deafneſs of Laws than to remedy them by applying to the paſſionate open Ears of a Tyrant.</p>
               <p>Nor can the Examples of the <hi>Gypſies,</hi> tho' poſſibly they may have long been happy under this Form of Government, be here urged; ſince we muſt remember the very material Reſpect in which they differ from all other People, and to which perhaps this their Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is entirely owing, namely, that they have no falſe Honours among them; and that they look on Shame as the moſt grievous Puniſhment in the World.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIII. <hi>A Dialogue between</hi> Jones <hi>and</hi> Partridge.</head>
               <p>THE honeſt Lovers of Liberty will we doubt not pardon that long Digreſſion into which we were led at the Cloſe of the laſt Chapter, to prevent our Hiſtory from being applied to the Uſe of the moſt pernicious Doctrine, which Prieſtcraft had ever the Wickedneſs or the Impudence to preach.</p>
               <p>We will now proceed with Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> who when the Storm was over, took Leave of his <hi>Egyptian</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, after many Thanks for his courteous Behaviour and kind Entertainment, and ſet out for <hi>Coventry;</hi> to which Place (for it was ſtill dark) a <hi>Gypſy</hi> was order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to conduct him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> having by Reaſon of his Deviation, travelled eleven Miles inſtead of ſix, and moſt of thoſe through very execrable Roads, where no Expedition could have been made, in Queſt of a Midwife, did not arrive at <hi>Coventry</hi> till near Twelve. Nor could he poſſibly get again into the Saddle till paſt Two; for Poſt-Horſes were now not eaſy to get; nor were the Hoſtler or Poſt-Boy, in half ſo great a Hurry as himſelf, but choſe rather to imitate the tranquil Diſpoſition of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge;</hi> who being denied the Nouriſhment of Sleep, took all Opportunities to ſupply its Place with every other Kind of Nouriſhment, and was never better pleaſed than when he arrived at an Inn, nor ever more diſſatisfied than when he was again forced to leave it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> now travelled Poſt; we will follow him therefore, according to our Cuſtom, and to the Rules of <hi>Longinus,</hi> in the ſame Manner. From <hi>Coventry</hi> he arrived at <hi>Daventry,</hi> from <hi>Daventry</hi> at <hi>Stratford,</hi> and from <hi>Stratford</hi> at <hi>Dunſtable,</hi> whither he came the next Day a little after Noon, and within a few Hours after <hi>Sophia</hi> had left it; and though he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to ſtay here longer than he wiſhed, while a
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:0618300102:414"/>
Smith, with great Deliberation, ſhoed the Poſt-Horſe he was to ride, he doubted not but to overtake his <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia</hi> before ſhe ſhould ſet out from <hi>St. Albans;</hi> at which Place he concluded, and very reaſonably, that his Lordſhip would ſtop and dine.</p>
               <p>And had he been right in this Conjecture, he moſt probably would have overtaken his Angel at the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Place; but unluckily my Lord had appointed a Dinner to be prepared for him at his own Houſe in <hi>London,</hi> and in order to enable him to reach that Place in proper Time, he had ordered a Relay of Horſes to meet him at <hi>St. Albans.</hi> When <hi>Jones</hi> therefore arrived there, he was informed that the Coach and Six had ſet out two Hours before.</p>
               <p>If freſh Poſt-Horſes had been now ready, as they were not, it ſeemed ſo apparently impoſſible to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the Coach before it reached <hi>London,</hi> that <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge</hi> thought he had now a proper Opportunity to remind his Friend of a Matter which he ſeemed entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have forgotton; what this was the Reader will gueſs, when we inform him that <hi>Jones</hi> had eat no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than one poached Egg ſince he had left the Alehouſe where he had firſt met the Guide returning from <hi>Sophia;</hi> for with the Gypſies, he had only feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Underſtanding.</p>
               <p>The Landlord ſo entirely agreed with the Opinion of Mr. <hi>Partridge,</hi> that he no ſooner heard the latter deſire his Friend to ſtay and dine, than he very readily put in his Word, and retracting his Promiſe before given of furniſhing the Horſes immediately, he aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> he would loſe no Time in beſpeaking a Dinner, which, he ſaid, could be got ready ſooner than it was poſſible to get the Horſes up from Graſs, and to prepare them for their Journey by a Feed of Corn.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> was at length prevailed on, chiefly by the latter Argument of the Landlord; and now a Joint of Mutton was put down to the Fire. While this was
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:0618300102:415"/>
preparing, <hi>Partridge</hi> being admitted into the ſame Apartment with his Friend or Maſter, began to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue in the following Manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'Certainly, Sir, if ever Man deſerved a young La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, you deſerve young Madam <hi>Weſtern;</hi> for what a vaſt Quantity of Love muſt a Man have, to be able to live upon it without any other Food, as you do. I am poſitive I have eat thirty times as much within theſe laſt twenty four Hours as your Honour, and yet I am almoſt famiſhed; for nothing makes a Man ſo hungry as travelling, eſpecially in this cold raw weather. And yet I can't tell how it is, but your Honour is ſeemingly in perfect good Health, and you never looked better nor freſher in your Life. It muſt certainly be Love that you live upon.'</q>

               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'Undoubtedly,' cries <hi>Partridge,</hi> there is enough in that Pocket-Book to purchaſe many a good Meal. Fortune ſent it to your Honour very opportunely for preſent Uſe, as your Honour's Money muſt be almoſt out by this Time.'</q>

No indeed, I would have your Honour pay it again, as ſoon as it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, by all Means; but where can be the Harm in making uſe of it now you want it. Indeed if it belonged to a poor Body, it would be another

thing; but ſo great a Lady to be ſure can never want it, eſpecially now as ſhe is along with a Lord, who it can't be doubted will let her have whatever ſhe hath need of. Beſides, if ſhe ſhould wan't a little, ſhe can't want the whole, therefore I would give her a little; but I would be hanged before I mentioned the having found it at firſt, and before I got ſome Money of my own; for <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> I have heard, is the very worſt of Places to be in without Money. Indeed, if I had not known to whom it belonged, I might have thought it was the Devil's Money, and have been afraid to uſe it; but as you know otherwiſe, and came ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly by it, it would be an Affront to Fortune to part with it all again, at the very Time when you want it moſt; you can hardly expect ſhe ſhould ever do you ſuch another good Turn; for <hi>Fortuna nunquam perpetuo eſt bona.</hi> You will do as you pleaſe, notwithſtanding all I ſay; but for my Part, I would be hanged before I mentioned a Word of the Matter.'</q>

I have lived to a fine Purpoſe truly, if I am to be taught my Grammar at this Time of Day.

               <p>There were not many Inſtances in which <hi>Partridge</hi> could provoke <hi>Jones,</hi> nor were there many in which <hi>Partridge</hi> himſelf could have been hurried out of his Reſpect.

               <p>The ſage Pedagogue was contented with the Vent which he had already given to his Indignation; and, as the vulgar Phraſe is, immediately drew in his Horns. He ſaid, He was ſorry he had uttered any thing which might give Offence, for that he had never intended it; but <hi>Nemo omnibus horis ſapit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As <hi>Jones</hi> had the Vices of a warm Diſpoſition, he was entirely free from thoſe of a cold one; and if his Friends muſt have confeſt his Temper to have been a little too eaſily ruffled, his Enemies muſt at the ſame Time have confeſt, that it as ſoon ſubſided; nor did it at all reſemble the Sea, whoſe Swelling is more violent and dangerous after a Storm is over, than while the Storm itſelf ſubſiſts. He inſtantly accepted the Submiſſion of <hi>Partridge,</hi> ſhook him by the Hand, and with the moſt benign Aſpect imaginable, ſaid twenty kind Things, and at the ſame Time ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſeverely condemned himſelf, tho' not half ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely as he will moſt probably be condemned by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our good Readers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Partridge</hi> was now highly comforted, as his Fears of having offended were at once aboliſhed, and his Pride completely ſatified by <hi>Jones</hi>'s having owned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the wrong, which Submiſſion he inſtantly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to what had principally nettled him, and repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in a muttering Voice, <q rend="inline">'To be ſure, Sir, your Knowledge may be ſuperior to mine in ſome Things; but as to the Grammar, I think I may chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge any Man living. I think, at leaſt, I have that at my Finger's Ends.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>If any thing could add to the Satisfaction which the poor Man now enjoyed, he received this Addition by the Arrival of an excellent Shoulder of Mutton, that at this Inſtant came ſmoaking to the Table. On which, having both plentifully feaſted, they again mounted their Horſes, and ſet forward for <hi>London.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XIV. <hi>What happened to Mr.</hi> Jones <hi>on his Journey from St.</hi> Albans.</head>
               <p>THEY were got about two Miles beyond <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nett,</hi> and it was now the Duſk of the Evening, when a genteel looking Man, but upon a very ſhabby Horſe, rode up to <hi>Jones,</hi> and aſked him whether he was going to <hi>London,</hi> to which <hi>Jones</hi> anſwered in the affirmative. The Gentleman replied, <q rend="inline">'I ſhould be obliged to you, Sir, if you will accept of my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; for it is very late, and I am a Stranger to the Road.'</q> 
                  <hi>Jones</hi> readily complied with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; and on they travelled together, holding that Sort of Diſcourſe which is uſual on ſuch Occaſions.</p>
               <p>Of this, indeed, Robbery was the principal Topic; upon which Subject the Stranger expreſſed great Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions; but <hi>Jones</hi> declared he had very little to loſe, and conſequently as little to fear. Here <hi>Partridge,</hi> could not forbear putting in his Word. <q rend="inline">'Your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, ſaid he, may think it a little, but I am ſure, if I had a hundred Pound Bank Note in my Pocket, as you have, I ſhould be very ſorry to loſe it; but, for my Part, I never was leſs afraid in my Life; for we are four of us, and if we all ſtand by one another, the beſt Man in <hi>England</hi> can't rob us. Suppoſe he ſhould have a Piſtol, he can kill but one of us, and a Man can die but once, that's my Comfort, a Man can die but once.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides the Reliance on ſuperior Numbers, a kind of Valour which hath raiſed a certain Nation among the Moderns to a high Pitch of Glory, there was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reaſon for the extraordinary Courage which <hi>Partridge</hi> now diſcovered; for he had at preſent as much of that Quality as was in the Power of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor to beſtow.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="411" facs="tcp:0618300102:420"/>
Our Company were now arrived within a Mile of <hi>Highgate,</hi> when the Stranger turned ſhort upon <hi>Jones,</hi> and pulling out a Piſtol, demanded that little Bank Note which <hi>Partridge</hi> had mentioned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> was at firſt ſomewhat ſhocked at this unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Demand; however, he preſently recollected himſelf, and told the Highwayman, all the Money he had in his Pocket was entirely at his Service; and ſo ſaying, he pulled out upwards of three Guineas, and offered to deliver it; but the other anſwered with an Oath, That would not do. <hi>Jones</hi> anſwered cooly, He was very ſorry for it, and returned the Money into his Pocket.</p>
               <p>The Highwayman then threatned, if he did not deliver the Bank Note that Moment, he muſt ſhoot him; holding his Piſtol at the ſame Time very near to his Breaſt. <hi>Jones</hi> inſtantly caught hold of the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low's Hand, which trembled ſo that he could ſcarce hold the Piſtol in it, and turned the Muzzle from him. A Struggle then enſued, in which the former wreſted the Piſtol from the Hand of his Antagoniſt, and both came from their Horſes on the Ground together, the Highwayman upon his Back, and the victorious <hi>Jones</hi> upon him.</p>
               <p>The poor Fellow now began to implore Mercy of the Conqueror; for, to ſay the Truth, he was in Strength by no Means a Match for <hi>Jones.</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">'In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, Sir, ſays he, I could have had no Intention to ſhoot you, for you will find the Piſtol was not loaded. This is the firſt Robbery I ever attempted, and I have been driven by Diſtreſs to this.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>At this Inſtant, at about a hundred and fifty Yards Diſtance, lay another Perſon on the Ground, roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Mercy in a much louder Voice than the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayman. This was no other than <hi>Partridge</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who endeavouring to make his Eſcape from the Engagement, had been thrown from his Horſe, and
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:0618300102:421"/>
lay flat on his Face, not daring to look up, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting every Minute to be ſhot.</p>
               <p>In this Poſture he lay, till the Guide, who was no otherwiſe concerned than for his Horſes, having ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the ſtumbling Beaſt, came up to him and told him, his Maſter had got the better of the Highway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Partridge</hi> leapt at this News, and ran back to the Place, where <hi>Jones</hi> ſtood with his Sword drawn in his Hand to guard the poor Fellow; which <hi>Partridge</hi> no ſooner ſaw, than he cried out, <q rend="inline">'Kill the Villain, Sir, run him through the Body, kill him this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Luckily however for the poor Wretch he had fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into more merciful Hands; for <hi>Jones</hi> having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined the Piſtol, and found it to be really unloaded, began to believe all the Man had told him before <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge</hi> came up; namely, that he was a Novice in the Trade, and that he had been driven to it by the Diſtreſs he mentioned, the greateſt indeed imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that of five hungry Children, and Wife lying in of a ſixth, in the utmoſt Want and Miſery. The Truth of all which the Highwayman moſt vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſerted, and offered to convince Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> of, if he would take the Trouble to go to his Houſe, which was not above two Miles off; ſaying, <q rend="inline">'That he deſired no Favour, but upon Condition of prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all he had alledged.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> at firſt pretended that he would take the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low at his Word, and return with him, declaring that his Fate ſhould depend entirely on the Truth of his Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Upon this the poor Fellow immediately expreſſed ſo much Alacrity, that <hi>Jones</hi> was perfectly ſatisfied with his Veracity, and began now to entertain Sentiments of Compaſſion for him. He returned the Fellow his empty Piſtol, adviſed him to think of honeſter Means of relieving his Diſtreſs, and gave him a couple of Guineas for the immediate Support of his Wife and
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:0618300102:422"/>
his Family; adding, <q rend="inline">'he wiſhed he had more for his Sake, but the hundred Pound that had been mentioned, was not his own.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Our Readers will probably be divided in their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions concerning this Action? ſome may applaud it perhaps as an Act of extraordinary Humanity, while thoſe of a more ſaturnine Temper will conſider it as a Want of Regard to that Juſtice which every Man owes his Country. <hi>Partridge</hi> certainly ſaw it in that Light; for he teſtified much Diſſatisfaction on the Occaſion, quoted an old Proverb, and ſaid, He ſhould not wonder if the Rogue attacked them again before they reached <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Highwayman was full of Expreſſions of Thankfulneſs and Gratitude. He actually dropt Tears, or pretended ſo to do. He vowed he would immediately return home, and would never after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards commit any ſuch Tranſgreſſion; whether he kept his Word or no, perhaps, may appear here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>Our Travellers having remounted their Horſes, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in Town without encountering any new miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap. On the Road much pleaſant Diſcourſe paſſed between <hi>Jones</hi> and <hi>Partridge,</hi> on the Subject of their laſt Adventure. In which <hi>Jones</hi> expreſt a great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion for thoſe Highwaymen, who are, by una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable Diſtreſs, driven, as it were, to ſuch illegal Courſes, as generally bring them to a ſhameful Death. <q rend="inline">'I mean, ſaid he, thoſe only whoſe higheſt Guilt extends no farther than to Robbery, and who are never guilty of Cruelty nor inſult to any Perſon, which is a Circumſtance that, I muſt ſay, to the Honour of our Country, diſtinguiſhes the Robbers of <hi>England</hi> from thoſe of all other Nations; for Murder is, amongſt thoſe, almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably incident to Robbery.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'No doubt, anſwered <hi>Partridge,</hi> it is better to take away one's Money than one'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="414" facs="tcp:0618300102:423"/>
is very hard upon honeſt Men, that they can't tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel about their Buſineſs without being in Danger of theſe Villains. And to be ſure it would be better that all Rogues were hanged out of the Way, than that one honeſt Man ſhould ſuffer. For my own Part, indeed, I ſhould not care to have the Blood of any of them on my own Hands; but it is very proper for the Law to hang them all. What Right hath any Man to take Sixpence from me, unleſs I give it him? Is there any honeſty in ſuch a Man?'</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">'No ſurely, cries <hi>Jones,</hi> no more than there is in him who takes the Horſes out of another Man's Stable, or who applies to his own Uſe the Money which he finds, when he knows the Right Owner.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Hints ſtopt the Mouth of <hi>Partridge,</hi> nor did he open it again till <hi>Jones</hi> having thrown ſome ſarcaſtical Jokes on his Cowardice, he offered to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe himſelf on the Inequality of Fire Arms, ſaying, <q rend="inline">'A thouſand naked Men are nothing to one Piſtol; for though it is true, it will kill but one at a ſingle Diſcharge, yet who can tell but that one may be himſelf.'</q>
