            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>WITH a conſiderable degree of anxiety the author at length delivers to the public candour the greateſt labour of his life.</p>
            <p>The plan of this work being in ſome reſpects new, it may not be unneceſſary to indicate the cauſes of the arrangement. The characters of the monarchs are delineated at the commencement, not at the cloſe, of their reigns; becauſe in the moſt eminent hiſtorical productions, when other perſonages aſcend the ſcene, they are thus introduced, and recommended to the reader's attention, as he becomes more intereſted in the events by a previous acquaintance with the actors. In the other mode the mind ſeems to feel ſome defect in gratification, ſome deſire to reperuſe the reign, in order to mark its correſpondence with the character: nor can any juſt cauſe be aſſigned why the princes ſhould, in this reſpect, be diſtinguiſhed from the other chief perſonages. Nor is the private perſonal character of a monarch always to be diſcerned in the
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0141700201:5"/>public fortunes of his ſovereignty, often the machina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of miniſters and parties, though it doubtleſs have ſuch influence as to deſerve great attention: and modern hiſtory not permitting ſuch variety of rhetoric and digreſſion, as the ancient claſſical models afford, it becomes the more important to preſerve its legal wealth unviolated, and to diverſify the chronicle of wars and treaties by ethic portraiture, by delineations of men and manners. Yet in this arrangement of the characters it becomes indiſpenſable, that the reign be firſt compoſed with complete candour, from the moſt genuine and unbiaſſed ſources, and meditated in all its relations of time, place, and circumſtances, before a juſt eſtimate can be prefixed.</p>
            <p>Another novelty is the Retroſpect, interpoſed at appropriated epochs, of the ſtate of the country in civilization, government, laws, tactics, agriculture, commerce, literature, and the arts, during a preceding period. The claſſical page of hiſtory, from the age of Herodotus to the lateſt voice of expiring Rome, is illuminated with ſuch reſearches, though commonly preſented in the form of digreſſions; but they are certainly deſerving of a ſeparate and peculiar nich in the temple of memory. At the ſame time it would be raſh too far to depart from the models venerated
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0141700201:6"/>by the wiſdom of ages; or to forget that the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of national events is the allotted province of hiſtory. Theſe ſketches muſt therefore be kept in due ſubſervience to the main deſign, leaſt by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicious exuberance of extraneous matter the very nature and name of hiſtory periſh; and the grandeſt records of human inſtruction, the moſt pleaſing pages of general entertainment, become cumbrous volumes of reference, chained to the groaning ſhelves of libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Sufficiently difficult, if performed with a due ſenſe of its importance, is the taſk of the hiſtorian; and he needs little to encroach on other departments of ſcience, upon which for him to dilate would be as abſurd as if he were to give the natural hiſtory of the animals, and plants, of a kingdom. But when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricted within proper bounds, and in ſome imitation of claſſical practice, theſe ſketches may be regarded as not only among the moſt inſtructive and intereſting parts of hiſtory, but as an agreeable variety and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief from the leſs diverſified ſeries of modern events. The author was happy to find that his ideas on this topic completely correſponded with thoſe of the late Mr. Gibbon, who was pleaſed warmly to expreſs his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of this part of the plan, of its arrangement, and of the ſpace allotted to it, as calculated, not to
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0141700201:7"/>encumber and oppreſs the genuine province of hiſtory, but to variegate, enliven, and adorn<note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe remarks may, at the ſame time, anſwer the queſtion, why Dr. Henry's plan was not followed: and as little would the author, though he warmly venerate the mutual benefits of the union, be diſpoſed to imitate his example, in ſinking the hiſtory of an independent, and moſt memorable, king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in that of a great neighbouring ſtate; an injudicious mixture, productive of perplexity and confuſion, while clear ideas can only be attained by ſeparate and diſtinct views of their hiſtory and antiquities.</note>.</p>
            <p>In the important and intereſting diviſion of Scotiſh hiſtory, now before the reader, no pioneer had ariſen to clear the way; and the author ſoon found that the careleſſneſs and inaccuracy, with which it had been treated, exceeded any previous expectation he could have formed. Scarce a ſtep could be advanced, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome doubt ariſing in fact, or in chronology, ſo that the information of a paragraph is often the labour of a diſſertation. The moſt ſkillful will be the firſt to pardon any miſtakes that may remain; and the candour of all is requeſted for an attempt derived from ſo many new ſources, ſo many manuſcript mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, that after every care, and attention, not a few errors may have eſcaped notice.</p>
            <p>Had the author's abilities been equal to his ambition, it was his object and wiſh, to have rendered the work
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0141700201:8"/>ſo complete a model of modern hiſtory, ſo perſpicuous, intereſting, various, animated, and elegant, as to merit general approbation, as to appear on the toilette as well as in the library: while at the ſame time, the events, chronology, references, and appendixes, ſhould preſent an exactneſs impenetrable by the ſharpeſt ſpear of the ſterneſt antiquary. Vain hopes! His leſs ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine expectations may yet claim the humble merits of patience and labour, the nurſes not the parents of genius—may deſcend from the impervious mountains of ability into the vale of accuracy. Yet even accuracy is not the meaneſt merit of the hiſtorian, though to attain it ſomewhat too much may perhaps be found to be here ſacrificed, in minute notes from diplomatic reſources: but in excuſe the reader will remember that this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular diviſion of the Scotiſh hiſtory had never before been attempted by any writer verſed in common au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentication, while Sir David Dalrymple, Dr. Robertſon, and other learned and able authors, have minutely il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated the preceding and ſucceeding periods. Such notes are not indeed intereſting to the general reader, but they occupy little ſpace—and the learned will not blame even a ſuperſtitious regard to accuracy and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtration, where much confuſion and obſcurity had before prevailed: nor can the author be juſtly cenſured for the cruel neceſſity of being his own pioneer, of
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0141700201:9"/>proceeding as in an American foreſt, with moſt cautious ſteps through the ſwamps, and earneſtly clearing his way amid the brambles and thickets of perplexity and error.</p>
            <p>Not to mention the innumerable new materials uſed in the various reigns, that of James V, in particular, is almoſt wholly compoſed from the original letters of the chief actors; and is perhaps the firſt attempt of the kind in any language, a few references to ſuch docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments having hitherto ſatisfied the ambition of truth and accuracy. On a compariſon with preceding ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, the reader will judge how much the modern hiſtory of all ſtates might be verified, and improved, by ſuch a plan; and how many groſs errors remain in the moſt celebrated pages of hiſtory. The taſk is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed laborious, but what is temporary labour when compared with eternal truth?</p>
            <p>It is a trite remark that an hiſtorian ſhould belong to no ſect, and no party: with whatever ſeverity and modeſty he may eſtimate his efforts, ſtill his labours, however humble, muſt in their very nature appeal to poſterity; and to pollute his pages with the faction of the day, would be to violate his own dignity, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject his beſt reward. This work, begun long before
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0141700201:10"/>that change which produced the preſent opinions and commotions in Europe, was completed in a ſilent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attention to them; and every ſentiment would have been the ſame, if the publication had taken place ten years ago.</p>
            <p>Amid times of ſingular difficulty, amid objects of far ſuperior importance, ſhould theſe volumes be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with favour, it would be the author's ambition to complete his deſign, by compoſing on the ſame plan the Hiſtory of Scotland, from the earlieſt accounts to the acceſſion of the houſe of Stuart. In twenty-four books, comprized in two ſimilar volumes, for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuments being more rare the diviſions would be more brief, he would arrange the materials contained in his Enquiry into the early part, and the ſucceeding Annals of Lord Hailes, with numerous important additions and illuſtrations. The materials for this part are nearly complete; and it would give the author great ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be encouraged in preſenting at length an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic and legitimate hiſtory of his country, diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbered from thoſe clouds of fable and error, which have ſo long expoſed it to neglect or contempt.</p>
            <p>From the reign of Mary to the union of the crowns, and of the kingdoms, ſo much has been done, that
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:0141700201:11"/>little it would ſeem remains for future labour. Yet the untouched manuſcript materials might occupy two or three years in the peruſal; and perhaps not a few diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries might be made by indefatigable aſſiduity. The beſt form of ſuch a work might be, one decade of hiſtory to the union of the crowns, and one of annals to that of the kingdoms: any ſucceeding events might appear in a chronological abſtract, at ſufficient length to accompany the general hiſtory of a kingdom.</p>
            <p>It only remains to admoniſh the reader, before he proceed to the peruſal of this work, that the letter O, prefixed to a reference, implies that the paper is the Original, either written or ſigned, ſealed or dictated, by the party; and that C is the mark of a Copy, generally contemporary, always ancient.</p>

               </p>
               <p>THE acceſſion of the family of Stuart to the Scotiſh throne deſerves the particular attention of the hiſtorian. <note place="margin">1371</note> Among the many families, which have held the regal ſceptre in the various kingdoms of Europe, none have been hailed with equal applauſe, none have encountered equal animoſity. This houſe being at the head of affairs, when many violent efferveſcences of party aroſe, the ſober voice of candour has been drowned
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0141700201:17"/>in the tumult of numerous partiſans. Truth has ſighed when ſhe beheld all the weeds of obloquy, and all the flowers of praiſe, heaped upon the ſame monument.</p>
               <p>But the period is at length arrived, when the violence both of religious, and of political, party was to ſuffer a conſiderable abatement. When univerſal right of conſcience ſhall order governments to refrain from the private buſineſs of the boſom; and ſhall render even the name of toleration ridiculous by tearing down the veil, which obſcured the moſt ſacred prerogatives of mankind. When the intereſted aims of antiquated parties were to become objects of equal neglect to enlightened nations, who began to ſee that one party alone could ſerve them, an union of the people againſt their corrupters and oppreſſors.</p>
               <p>There is a gloomy bigotry in the ſpirit of party which is inimical to reaſon, and which clouds the ſunſhine of the mind. Abſurdity becomes as contagious as a peſtilence; and many tenets are objects of belief becauſe they are impracticable to argument. Hence we ceaſe to wonder when we behold the human character, ſo variable in itſelf, and ſo liable to every alteration of time and circumſtance, ſuppoſed to be conſtant and immutable in one family only. To the jaundiced eye of party the whole Houſe of Stuart became, as it were, one teſt of political and religious opinion. Inſtead of granting, according to the dictates of reaſon and of fact, that the monarchs of that illuſtrious family were as various in their characters, and conduct, as thoſe of any other genealogy, and country, faction has been ſo abſurd as to form them into one houſe of fame, or diſpraiſe. One character alone may indeed be aſcribed to the whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, in the ſacred term of unfortunate: and their proverbial misfortunes as often contradict the political maxim, that want of ſucceſs is but another expreſſion for defect of prudence, as they confirm the rigorous obſervation. If one other general
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0141700201:18"/>remark be allowed, it muſt be, that moſt of the princes of this family were better qualified for the enjoyments and elegancies of private life, than for the toil and dazzling buſtle of royalty; and had little of that tyrannic ſplendor which pleaſes the people ſo much, becauſe they regard the monarch as the public repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative, and exult when he ſhews his ſpirit by trampling upon them. A mild ſovereign may receive the appellation of a tyrant, from his yielding ſome prerogatives, and thus raiſing hope and reſentment becauſe he concedes not more; while, with equal injuſtice, a deſpot may ſecure popular applauſe, becauſe his royal ſpirit preſerves the tyranny in pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted pomp. To confirm this obſervation let the houſes of Tudor and of Stuart be compared. But after theſe prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory remarks, it is now proper to return to the immediate courſe of the narration.</p>
               <p>The ſceptre of Scotland paſſed to the family of Stuart at an unfortunate period for the acceding progeny. Inſtead of a new ſovereign who might intereſt the wiſhes of the nation, by the amiable and ſplendid promiſes of youth, or excite its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and ambition by the ſteady ſpirit of middle age, the reins of government fell into a hand trembling under the weight of years.</p>
               <p>In order to enable the reader to form juſt ideas concerning this important event, it becomes neceſſary to explain, as briefly as poſſible, the origin, and progreſs, of the family of Stuart; and its actual condition when it aſcended the Scotiſh throne.</p>
               <p>The fables of adulation have now paſſed away, and it is acknowledged that we have no certain evidence concerning this family, till the reign of David I, when Walter the ſon of Alan appears as Steward <note n="1" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Dapifer,</hi> a term ſynonymous with <hi>Seneſchalcus,</hi> in France as in Scotland: Du Cange voce Seneſchalcus. The derivation of the latter word is not clear; <hi>ſchak</hi> is a ſervant; <hi>Mariſchalcus</hi> is the ſervant who had the charge of the horſes; but <hi>Sene</hi> or <hi>Senet</hi> remains unexplained: it may be from <hi>ſean</hi> to ſee, as inſpector; or from <hi>ſegen</hi> a banner, (ſee Lye Dict. Angloſax., perhaps it is allied to <hi>ſene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcantia,</hi> convivium, Du C. But the moſt plauſible etymology ſeems to ariſe from <hi>Senn,</hi> a chief herdſman, <hi>Sennten,</hi> a herd, (<hi>Scheuchzer</hi> Iter Alp. I, 49,) as the wealth of early times conſiſted of herds and flocks. The office is evident; it was not only the chief of the houſhold, but its power, from the confidence acquired by that ſtation, extended to the collection and management of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue; to the adminiſtration of juſtice; and even to the chief direction in war. During the reigns of the firſt race of France, the Stewards are claſſed after the biſhops and counts: in the time of the ſecond race they follow the <hi>Comites Palatii:</hi> about the year 980 they ſucceeded to the extinguiſhed office of Mayors of the Palace. But the power was in France found too vaſt for a ſubject; and in 1191 the dignity and emoluments began to be reſerved to the crown. The office was gradually ſubdivided into thoſe of Great Maſter of the Houſhold, Conſtable or commander in chief, and High Juſticiary. Du Cange, ib.</note> of Scotland: and there is room to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0141700201:19"/>believe that this genealogical appellation points to the noble and ancient Engliſh family of Fitz Alan. Walter was ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in his high office by Alan his ſon; who was followed by the ſecond Walter. No action worthy of the hiſtoric page is authentically recorded of theſe three: and the moſt important intelligence, which we can obtain from their charters, is the ſituation of their lands; which were chiefly in that weſtern promontory, waſhed by the fertile and pictureſque river Clyde, and now called the ſhire of Renfrew, then, and ſince, the territory of the family, and power, of the Stewards <note n="2" place="bottom">Crawford's Hiſtory of the ſhire of Renfrew, and of the Houſe of Stuart, Edin. 1710, folio, Paiſley 1782, 4to. Stewart's Genealogical account of the Stuarts, Edin. 1739, 4to. For the origin of the family conſult alſo the remarks of lord Hailes, Annals I, 358.</note>. A higher fate awaited Alexander, the fourth Steward of Scotland, who united the adjacent iſland of Bute to his patrimony by marrying the heireſs; for in the year 1255, he appears among the great nobles, who oppoſed the exorbitant power of the Comyns; and, three years after, is mentioned as one of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0141700201:20"/>regents of Scotland, during the minority of Alexander III; and, in 1263, he commanded the Scotiſh army at the conteſt with the Norwegians near Largs <note n="3" place="bottom">Crawf. 12. Stewart, 50. Dalrymple's Annals 1255, 1258. For the battle of Largs, Fordun II, 98, who ſtyles the leader Alexander Stuart of Dundonald, great grandſon of Walter the firſt Steward, and grandfather of Walter who married Marjory daughter of Robert I. Winton MS. 587, ſays the king commanded in perſon. The Norwegian accounts are ſilent concerning the Scotiſh general. Crawford erroneouſly quotes Fordun, as aſſerting that the Steward was killed in the conflict: by Stewart's account, drawn from Sympſon's Houſe of Stuart, Edin. 1712, 8vo, and Abercromby I, 451, he died in 1283. aged 69.</note>. James, the next High Steward, was alſo a regent of Scotland after the unhappy death of Alexander III; ſhared the fame of Wallace in defence of his country, but ſoon abandoned him; then reſumed the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and exertions of a patriot, and had the merit of being excepted in the amneſty of Edward I. His age alone ſeems to have reſtrained him from aſſiſting the early patriotic endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of Robert I, for he died in 1309, after a life of ſixty ſix years <note n="4" place="bottom">Crawf. 13—23. Stewart, 51. Dalrymple's Annals 1286, 1297, 1303, &amp;c.</note>.</p>
               <p>But the proſperous fortunes of this houſe moved in a yet higher progreſs, when Walter, the ſixth High Steward, ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened and adorned his country. One of the heroes who divided the danger, and the glory, at Bannocburn, his youthful courage, and tried fidelity, were, the following year, rewarded with the largeſt gift which a ſubject could receive, in his marriage with the only daughter of his ſovereign. His valour, and his abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, were confirmed in the public eſteem by the defence of Berwick, and by his government of the kingdom in conjunction with Douglas: and his early death was lamented by a grateful people <note n="5" place="bottom">Crawf. 23—25. Stewart, 52—54. Dalrymple, Vol. II, paſſim. He died in 1326. Dalr. II, 116.</note>. Robert, the ſeventh High Steward, was the only
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0141700201:21"/>iſſue of Walter and the princeſs: and to him the crown of Scotland was deſtined to devolve. Diſtinguiſhed in early youth by his conduct at the battle of Halidon, by his deciſive exertions againſt Edward Baliol; by the ſingular praiſe of being appointed, in conjunction with Murray, governor of Scotland, at the age of eighteen, he did not afterwards fruſtrate the general expectation <note n="6" place="bottom">Crawf. 26. Stewart, 55. Dalr. II, 165, 174, 175. The Steward was ſole regent 1338—1341, and 1346—1357. Dalr. II, 202, 221.</note>. Twice ſole governor of a fierce and high ſpirited nation, he confirmed the claim of his birth by the tenor of his actions: and he afterwards aſcended the throne, fully experienced in the duties of obedience, and the arts of command.</p>
               <p>The actual ſtate of the family, when it became royal, claims our next attention. Rewards for ſucceſſive ſervices of import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and the dower of the princely bride, had encreaſed the poſſeſſions of the Stuarts to a great number, and extent, in various regions, both in the weſtern and eaſtern parts of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <note n="7" place="bottom">Crawf. paſſim.</note>. Had the territories of Douglas been as detached as thoſe of Stuart, that name had never become formidable to the crown: but chance, and not deſign, ſeems to have preſided in this diſtant allotment. The title, and office, of High Steward had ſucceeded, in France, to the ſupremacy of the Mairs of the Palace: and in that, and other, countries were ſoon found too lofty for the ambition of a ſubject: hence it is not matter of ſurprize that no territorial dignity was annexed to this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction, till the year 1359, when the earldom of Strathern devolving into the hands of David II, was by him conferred on Robert, afterwards his ſucceſſor <note n="8" place="bottom">Crawf. 26. Additional Caſe of the Counteſs of Sutherland by Sir D. Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rymple, 1770, p. 55.</note>. But, in 1258, Walter, a cadet of the family, had become Earl of Monteith, by
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0141700201:22"/>wedding the heireſs <note n="9" place="bottom">Crawf. 11. Stewart, 49. Sutherland Caſe, 14—18.</note>; and Sir John Stuart of Bonkill, another cadet, was by David II created Earl of Angus; and he and his heirs held the eſtate, while the Umfravilles of England graſped at the title for many generations <note n="1" place="bottom">Crawf. 13. Stewart, 150. Sutherland Caſe, 11.</note>. Robert, the Steward, had but one brother, Sir John Stuart of Railſtoun, the only iſſue of his father's poſterior marriage with a ſiſter of Graham of Abercorn <note n="2" place="bottom">Crawf. 25. Stewart, 54.</note>; and this brother ſleeps in the ſilent ſhades of heraldry: but the family, by the extent of their poſſeſſions and connexions, wanted not power to ſupport their juſt title to the throne. Of all the great Scotiſh families that of Douglas alone ſeems to have been equal, and perhaps ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior, in power. The ſucceſſor to the ſceptre was alſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by a numerous progeny, ready to aſſert and to perpetuate his claim. By his firſt wife, Elizabeth daughter of Sir Adam More of Rowallan, he had his ſucceſſor John lord of Kyle, created Earl of Carric by David II; Walter earl of Fife; Robert, by marrying an heireſs of his own family, Earl of Menteith, afterwards Earl of Fife likewiſe, and Duke of Albany; and Alexander of Badenoch Earl of Buchan: beſides ſix daughters, united to the powerful families of March, Lyon of Glamis <note n="3" place="bottom">In the ſecond year of this reign the <hi>Thanage</hi> of Glamis was granted to John Lyon; the <hi>relevium</hi> 10<hi>l.</hi> Scotſtarvet's Calendars, Harl. 4609, f. 109.</note>, Hay of Errol, Mac Donald of Ilay and the Iſles, Douglas of Nithſdale, Lindſay of Gleneſk. Nor was his ſecond wife, Euphemia Roſs daughter of the Earl of Roſs, unproductive of additional ſupports to his family, in David afterwards Earl of Strathern; and Walter lord of Buchan, Earl of Athol and Caithneſs, and of Strathern upon his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's death, but to be in a future period branded as the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0141700201:23"/>of James I: and in four daughters, the elder of whom afterwards wedded James earl of Douglas; while the three others were joined to Keith a ſon of the marſhal, and two knights Logan and Swinton <note n="4" place="bottom">Crawf. 28—30. Stewart 56—58.</note>. The attachment of Robert to the fair ſex alſo appeared from his natural iſſue by his concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines, among which ſix ſons are noted by genealogiſts; and the Stuarts of Bute, Cairney, and others, are of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendants <note n="5" place="bottom">Crawf. 30, 31. Stewart 58—60. "Bel chevalier etoit, et avoit unze filz," ſays Froiſſart of Robert II. Tome I, f. v. 256, edit. 1518.</note>. It was certainly fortunate for the acceding family that it poſſeſſed ſuch internal ſtrength at this criſis; but this chance was overbalanced by peculiar diſadvantages.</p>
               <p>The King was advanced to his fifty fifth year <note n="6" place="bottom">He was born on the 2d of March 1316. Dalr. II, 65.</note>; and the weakneſs of his reign ſufficiently teſtifies that age began, and continued, to freeze abilities, which had formerly flowed in a clear and copious ſtream. His eldeſt ſon and heir, the Earl of Carric, had been maimed by a horſe <note n="7" place="bottom">Fordun II, 414. The rebellious ſteed belonged to Sir James Douglas of Dalkeith, "Johannes Comes de Carrik, ex percuſſione equi Domini Jacobi Douglas de Dalkeith, quaſi claudus effectus."</note>, and was lame and weak in body, and of no power of intellect. A perſonal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, which often arouſes ſuperior ſpirit in an individual, is pernicious to princes, in whom not a defect, but a ſuperiority, of dignity is matter of a general expectation, ſo deeply rooted in our nature, that ſavage nations often appoint their ſovereigns only from ſuperior perſonal appearance. This remark muſt alſo be applied to Robert II himſelf, whoſe eyes, disfigured by imflammation, diſguſted the beholders <note n="8" place="bottom">Froiſſart II, f. 177. The MS Bib. Reg. 18 E 1, reads, "Or ſen vint le roy Robert d'Eſcoche, qui eſtoit ung grant bon homme, a tout ungs rouges yeulx rebrachies, ils ſembloient de cindal." They were red like ſandal-wood; hence his vulgar epithet of blear eye, or watery eyes. Dalr. II, 279; but <hi>ungs</hi> is not <hi>one,</hi> ſee the Gloſſ. du Roman de la Roſe.</note>. Humanity would
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0141700201:24"/>paſs ſuch topics, did not ſo much of human hiſtory depend on the ſlighteſt qualities, or defects of princes.</p>
               <p>The perſon of Robert II was however large and majeſtic <note n="9" place="bottom">Fordun, II, 383.</note>. The qualities of his mind it is difficult to mark with preciſion. The diſeaſe of his eyes ſeems to have induced a deſire of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy, and age a propenſity to indolence, and the indolent are always ruled by thoſe around them. War he ſhunned, and declined the laborious office of a general; but the leaders whom he appointed were well choſen and ſucceſsful. In the more difficult and more truly glorious arts of peace, he is intitled to conſiderable praiſe. The terrors of juſtice he knew how to deal impartially to the guilty, while he opened every gate of protection to the innocent. His actions proceeded in a ſolid and rational tenor; and his promiſe was the exact ſtandard of his performance. Internal diſcords his equity appeaſed; and though his own age, and the infirmity of the apparent heir, rendered his reign feeble, yet his wiſdom prevented it from being unfortunate. In a word he is little known to hiſtory, becauſe he was a good king, and a good man.</p>
               <p>Upon the death of David II the ſtates of the kingdom aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled at Lithgow; <note place="margin">Feb.</note> and their determination appeared una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous in the appointment of Robert as ſucceſſor to the vacant throne <note n="1" place="bottom">Fordun, II, 382.</note>. But a ſudden cloud aroſe, which threatened all the ſtorms of civil war. William Earl of Douglas unexpectedly claimed the crown, as uniting in himſelf the dubious preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Comyn, and the ſolid title of Baliol. Yet the claim was no ſooner made than withdrawn. Our elder hiſtorians aſſert that the ſtrong intereſts of the Earls of Dunbar and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0141700201:25"/>Murray, and the yet ſtronger of Sir Robert Erſkine, keeper of the caſtles of Dunbarton, Edinburgh, and Stirling, appearing decided for the Steward; induced Douglas to reſign his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation; while the hiſtorian of the houſe of Douglas aſcribes the deſertion of the claim to its own friends <note n="2" place="bottom">Fordun, II, 382. Winton MS. 818. Hume's houſe of Douglas, I, 160—163.</note>. Pretenſions, which now ſtrike as vague or uſurpative, might not wear that appearance in an age when the rights of ſucceſſion were fluctuating and undetermined. But prudence certainly did not conſpire with ambition upon this occaſion, for no previous concert appears, no conciliation of intereſt; and the claim can only be recommended as a ſubject of ſpeculation. Had Robert I united his houſe to that of Douglas, the proſperity of Scotland might perhaps have been more ample under a family that, though ſubject, ſhewed a regal ſpirit; that in war boaſts a genealogy of heroes; and that happened to have few of thoſe minorities, which harraſſed the kingdom under the Stuarts: but in the more uſeful honours of peace the latter family ſeem to have been far ſuperior, and by their merit alone better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the ſceptre.</p>
               <p>Robert, attended by the ſtates, proceeded to Scone, where he was crowned with the uſual ceremonies <note n="3" place="bottom">Fordun, II, 383, ſays on the 25th March; but the MS. Records 4to, in the State Paper Office, fix the 26th March, and add that Landel biſhop of St. Andrews officiated. Next day the king, ſitting "ſuper montem de Scone," on the moot-hill of Scone, according to cuſtom received the homage of the biſhops and peers; among the latter are only enumerated John earl of Carric Steward of Scotland, William earl of Douglas, the earls of Strathern, Mar, and Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teith.

At the ſame time, in order to convince France that a change of politics had happened upon the acceſſion of the new family, the treaty with that country was renewed; and it was ſpecially ſtipulated that, in caſe of a competition for the Scotiſh crown, <note place="margin">June</note> the King of France ſhould withſtand any Engliſh influence, and ſhould ſupport the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the ſtates of Scotland <note n="6" place="bottom">Fordun, II, 392—395: this chapter is tranſpoſed, but Bowar, the arranger of Fordun's materials, is a bad chronologer, a charge incident to all our hiſtorians including Buchanan.
<p>Fordun gives a tranſtation of the treaty in latin. A copy of the French ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal may be ſeen in the 4to Regiſter, fol. 66—68. Robert's commiſſion is dated at Scone, 31 March 1371, regni 1. The alliance was concluded at Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cennes 30 June 1371; and was ratified by Robert at Edinburgh 28 Oct.

                     <p>In the ſame Regiſter, fol. 68, are preſerved the ſecret articles, dated 30 June. Charles V engages to perſuade the pope to declare the truce between England and Scotland void and null; to pay 100,000 nobles towards diſcharging the ranſom of David, or a larger ſum if neceſſary to defray it totally; and the 100,000 nobles, even if not due, towards the expence of a war with England. Before Scotland ſhall commence hoſtilities, France is to ſupply armour for 500 Scotiſh knights and ſquires, and for 500 <hi>ſargents,</hi> and is to pay the wages of this thouſand for two years; the knight to have 3 fols, the ſquire 18 deniers, the <hi>archier</hi> 9 deniers d'eſterlings a day, all paid by the year in advance. France is alſo to ſend at her expence 1000 men at arms to Scotland, and to continue the ſubſidy as the war may demand: the payment to commence at Bruges, half a year after the rupture of the alliance with England. But Robert, naturally addicted to peace, and who ſaw the impolicy of commercing hoſtilities at the acceſſion of his family to the throne, appears never to have accepted or ratified theſe private articles.</p>

                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0141700201:27"/>Another clauſe in the ſame treaty had effects apparently not foreſeen, and certainly not wiſhed nor intended. It was agreed reciprocally that the ſubjects of the allied powers ſhould not ſerve in the Engliſh armies; and different Scotiſh men, who had, toward the end of the preceding reign, entered into them, in conſequence withdrew. This circumſtance was conſidered as an indication of war; and, joined with the jealouſy naturally ariſing from the renewal and amplification of the treaty between Scotland and France, induced the Engliſh monarch to uſe caution and vigilance; and he iſſued a mandate to the Whop of Durham, <note place="margin">1372 Feb.</note> ordering that all capable of arms, in the north of England ſhould hold themſelves in readineſs to oppoſe any Scotiſh invaſion <note n="7" place="bottom">Rymer VI, 713.

               <p>But to ſuch a weakneſs had the illuſtrious reign of Edward III fallen, and ſo diſordered was the machine of his government, that from this period to his death, five years after, it is impoſſible to pronounce from his diſpoſition that there was peace, or from
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0141700201:28"/>his exertion that there was war, between the two kingdoms. <note place="margin">1372</note> The Scotiſh king endeavoured to cultivate peace by attentive payment of the ranſom, though the Engliſh ſovereign continued to deny his title, and only condeſcended to uſe that of "moſt noble and potent prince our dear Couſin of Scotland;" and when diſpoſed to war, "our adverſary of Scotland <note n="8" place="bottom">Rymer VI, 724.

               <p>In a memorable parliament, held at Scone, committees were, <note place="margin">2 Mar.</note> in imitation of the parliament aſſembled by David II in his fortieth year, appointed for the general adminiſtration of juſtice; and lords of the articles were choſen. The chief ſtatutes are, that no aſſeſſors be permitted to fit in the royal council, that no horſes be ſold into England, though cattle and ſheep may; money exported is to pay forty pence in the pound. No ſherif, <hi>ſerjand,</hi> or <hi>mair,</hi> is to require preſents, or remiſſion of debt. No mandate againſt the common courſe of law is to be obeyed, under whatever ſeal it may be iſſued. And a long, and ſevere, ordinance is enacted againſt murderers, and their abettors <note n="9" place="bottom">4to Regiſter, fol. v. 58, f. v. 60: the firſt reference bears the firſt year of Robert's reign, the laſt, the ſecond; the parliament continuing to ſit after the 26th March, the date of his acceſſion.

The earl of Carric, as Steward, or as High Juſticiary, was ſworn to enforce the ſtatutes; and the earls, barons, and burgeſſes to obſerve them. Skene, ib. the Regiſter is defective, two pages being left blank. But it preſents curious preliminary notices concerning the committees of juſtice, and the lords of the articles, confeſſedly appointed in imitation of the parliament 1370. Some of the burgeſſes ſummoned were abſent, "from contumacy," or rather neglect; a common grievance, which induced James I to order them to chuſe delegates.</note>.</p>

In the ſame Regiſter, fol. v. 63, appears a deed by the earl of Douglas, 26 April 1373, narrating that the king had granted him a free-port at North Berwich, but the gift being found injurious to others, he abandons it.</note>. This act was prudent in one point of view, as calculated to ſtrengthen the ſucceſſion, and guard againſt civil war; but, in another, as the apparent heir was infirm, and had no children at the time, it perhaps lent a fanction and ſupport to the ambition of the ſecond ſon, which had ſuch violent effects in the following reign.</p>

See Dalr. Ann. II, 264, whence it appears that the legality of her divorce from David II was the queſtion.</note>.</p>
               <p>But a greater order of affairs opens upon us, <note place="margin">1377</note> when Richard II ſucceeds to the Engliſh throne. Two wars, pregnant with various and important events, diſtinguiſh the latter part of the reign of Robert II; and it is the not unuſeful province of hiſtory to delineate hoſtilities in particular, as calling forth the greateſt exertions of character and talents, and as laſting

               <p>An officer of the Earl of March was ſlain by the Engliſh at Roxburgh, then in their poſſeſſion; and the Earl, after a vain demand of ſatisfaction, attacked, ravaged, and burned the town, during a fair, and glutted his followers with ſlaughter, revenge, and ſpoil. The Engliſh borderers retaliated on the lands of Sir John Gordon, who entering England was encountered by Lilburn, whom after a deſperate affray he defeated at Carham <note n="3" place="bottom">Winton MS. 819, 820.

And, if we credit an Engliſh hiſtorian, the government of his country, alarmed at this misfortune, ſent Edmund Mortimer Earl of March to treat with the Scots, on the uſual day for ſettling the diſputes of the marches; and the truce was renewed with reluctance, and for a ſhort time <note n="6" place="bottom">Walf. 214.</note>. Commiſſions for compromiſing theſe diſorders were however iſſued by Richard II, on the twenty ſeventh day of September this year, and on the firſt of January following <note n="7" place="bottom">Rymer VII, 174, 183.</note>.</p>
               <p>The revenge of an individual contributed ſtill further to deſtroy any remaining harmony between the two nations.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0141700201:31"/>Mercer a Scotiſhman, <note place="margin">1378</note> commanding a ſmall fleet of Scotiſh French and Spaniſh veſſels, ſuddenly diſplayed his motley ſquadron before Scarborough, and captured ſome valuable Engliſh ſhips of merchandize, becauſe that his father, a wealthy merchant reſiding in France, had been taken at ſea by ſome Northumbrians, and impriſoned at that place. The father was a man of importance at the French court, eſteemed by Charles the Wiſe, and his advice followed in many points detrimental to the Engliſh, and advantageous to the French, commerce. Walſingham expreſſes unaffected concern that the Earl of Northumberland had executed juſtice in ſoon delivering him without ranſom; for, adds he, if he had been ranſomed by the common rules he might have enriched the king, and kingdom, with ineſtimable wealth <note n="8" place="bottom">"Nam ſi redemptus fuiſſet captivorum more, regem et regnum ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bili pecunia divited effeciſſet." p. 212.
<p>It was apparently on this occaſion that a letter was written to the Engliſh king, by the earl of Douglas and Mar. It terms John Mercer, "mon homme;" and ſays he was detained though caſt on ſhore, contrary to the great truce: "Mr. Thomas Mercer, mon clerk," is alſo mentioned as captured. See it in that treaſure of original pieces, Veſp. F. VII, f. 34.</p>
                  </note>. But though the elder Mercer had been delivered, it would appear that his ſhips and cargo were not; and that retaliation conſpired with revenge to excite his ſon to this enterprize. The young man, boaſting of the exploit, continued to keep the ſea, as defying the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritim power of England; till John Philpot, a wealthy and ingenious merchant of London, ſtung with the diſgrace offered to the commerce of his country, fitted out ſhips of force pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with one thouſand men, raiſed at his own expence, who aſſaulted and took Mercer, his newly acquired prey, and fifteen Spaniſh ſhips which aſſiſted him <note n="9" place="bottom">Walſ. 213.</note>. The Duke of Lancaſter,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0141700201:32"/>who ſwayed the councils of the young Engliſh monarch, rather checked than applauded the ſpirit of Philpot; and commiſſioners were appointed to treat with thoſe of Scotland concerning peace <note n="1" place="bottom">Rymer VII, 206.</note>. <note place="margin">22 Oct.</note>
               </p>
               <p>It is difficult to diſcover the real pretext, or occaſion, of the capture of the caſtle of Berwick by the Scots this year; <note place="margin">Nov.</note> and the events of this period are not a little embroiled by various and diſcordant accounts. According to the old Engliſh and Scotiſh writers, this breach of the truce aroſe from the raſhneſs of a few borderers <note n="2" place="bottom">Walſ. 222, 223. Ypod. 136. Otterbourn, 148. Fordun, II, 391.</note>; but, if we believe Froiſſart, it was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of a war, commenced by the determination of the Scotiſh government. This laſt account we are diſpoſed to follow; and to infer, from the narrative of it's author, that the counſels of France, which aimed to divert the attention of Richard II from the ambitious views of his grandfather, had a ſhare in ſtimulating the Scots, already ſtung with repeated inſults, to regard the dubious truce in the ſame light with the Engliſh, and to break it when it ſuited their convenience <note n="3" place="bottom">Mezeray, Abr. III, 98, relates that the Scots now broke the truce with England, inſtigated by advantages which he mentions, and which correſpond with the ſecret articles of 1371.</note>. The French hiſtorian infroms us, that, by direction of Robert II, and his council, a ſmall army was ordered to meet on the borders under the command of Douglas, Murray and Mar. While this hoſt was gradually aſſembling, and eſquire, named Alexander Ramſay, proceeded with forty companions to Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick. Sending a ſpy to diſcover the ſtate of the caſtle, it was found that there was no water in the ditches, and no guard on the walls. Ramſay and his followers immediately planted ladders, ſcaled the walls, and came to the keep, where the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0141700201:33"/>commander was in bed, it being apparently early in the day, and he was killed in attempting to eſcape. An alarm being given the governor of the town ordered the ſtop and pillars of the drawbridge to be deſtroyed; and upon the aſſailants finding that they could not paſs, the governor and his people ſhouted "Are you there? Remain where you are. You ſhall not eſcape without our permiſſion." Ramſay reſolved to wait for ſuccour from the army, for Douglas had already marched from Dalkeith to Dunbar <note n="4" place="bottom">Froiſſart, Tome II, fol. v. 6, edit. 1518, 4to.</note>.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile the Earl of Northumberland ſummoned his array to Berwick; and with ten thouſand men beſieged the caſtle, and began a mine. The Scotiſh barons reſolved to raiſe the ſiege: and Archibald Douglas, a relation of Ramſay, advanced with a choſen party; but found the Engliſh too numerous, and was forced to retire; upon which the caſtle was taken by aſſault, and all the Scots ſlain, except Ramſay who yielded to Lord Percy <note n="5" place="bottom">Ibid. f. v. 8. The whole account is compared with the MS. in Bibl. Reg. 18 E 1.</note>.</p>
               <p>The Earl of Nottingham joined Northumberland, and they reſolved to fight the Scotiſh army if it advanced againſt them, or, if not, to ravage the ſouthern parts of Scotland. A party of three hundred lances and as many archers was detached, under Muſgrave the governor of Berwick, to Melroſe, while the reſt of the Engliſh army advanced to a hamlet near Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh where the Scots lay. Muſgrave ſent two ſquires to explore the enemy, who were taken, and diſcovered the Engliſh ſituation and deſigns; upon which the Scots reſolved to ſurprize Muſgrave, and marching immediately arrived near Melroſe at midnight; but a tempeſt of wind and rain blowing in their faces, they could hardly withſtand it's force, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0141700201:34"/>from their way. Halting under a wood, and making fires, they remained till dawn, when the tempeſt abated: and, as they were forced to forage, they had ſome ſkirmiſhes with Muſgrave's men who were alike employed; and he determined to advance to the right, in order to join the Engliſh army, but the Scots amounting to ſeven hundred lances, and two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand uncouthly armed, lay in the wood, and intercepted his progreſs. A conflict being unavoidable Douglas, according to the cuſtom of the times, knighted James his ſon, and Robert and David, two ſons of the king: the battle was quickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided; Archibald Douglas, lighting on foot, and wielding a ſword of enormous length which another man could hardly have held, made great ſlaughter: Muſgrave, his ſon, and many knights, and ſquires were taken. The Scotiſh army retired towards Edinburgh with their captives, while Northumberland and Nottingham could not purſue them, becauſe of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous ſeaſon of the year, and were forced to return, and diſmiſs their men, while the Scots were rejoicing and ranſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their captives at large ſums <note n="6" place="bottom">Froiſſart, ib.</note>. Such is in abſtract the account of Froiſſart, whoſe native ſimplicity, and particularity of detail, lead, whenever he is followed, into ſome length of narration; but it is hoped, not unpleaſing, as it paints the ſpirit and manners of the times. The Scotiſh chronicles im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the defeat and capture of Muſgrave to Sir John Gordon; and inform us, that Johnſton, and others diſtinguiſhed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſkirmiſhes with the Engliſh upon the weſtern marches <note n="7" place="bottom">Fordun, II, 385. Winton, 822.</note>.</p>
               <p>Though a peſtilence now raged in England, <note place="margin">1379</note> the Scotiſh borderers continued their inroads, with the uſual barbarity of marauders accuſtomed to rapine and cruelty <note n="8" place="bottom">Walſ. 234. This hiſtorian, warmly prejudiced againſt the Scots, ſtyles them, "humani generis inimici," and depicts their cruelty in glaring colours. He ſays that they even played at foot-ball with the heads of the ſlaughtered. Engliſh, and left the north of England a deſert; (ſee alſo the Ypod. 137.) They carried off even ſwine, an animal formerly always left by them: nor, it may be added, are the common people of Scotland yet reconciled to it's uſe. To preſerve themſelves from the plague, which the Engliſh ſaid God in his grace had ſent for their repentance, the Scots uſed this prayer in their own idiom, <hi>"Gode and Saint Mungo, Saint Romayn and Saint Andrew, ſchield us this day fro Goddis grace, and the foule death that Engliſhmen dien upon."</hi> Ib.</note>. The embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſing
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0141700201:35"/>affairs of the Duke of Bretagne the Engliſh ally, and an indeciſion which ſeems to have prevailed in the councils of Richard II at this period, conſpired with the peſtilence to prevent any exertion to retaliate; as the latter calamity was a ſufficient barrier againſt any important expedition of the Scots.</p>
               <p>But in the next year a Scotiſh veſſel, <note place="margin">1380</note> worth ſeven thouſand marks, being taken by Engliſh ſhips from Hull and Newcaſtle, the Scots, enraged at the loſs, entered England under the Earl of Douglas; and piercing Cumberland and Weſtmoreland, drove from the foreſt of Inglewood forty thouſand domeſtic animals of different kinds, which a party conducted to Scotland <note n="9" place="bottom">Walſ. 249. Otterb. 152.</note>. Douglas with twenty thouſand men ſurrounded the town of Penrith by night, during a fair; ravaged, and burned it, and loaded his army with ſpoil. Returning by Carliſle they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to attack that city, but learning that the northern counties of England were armed, and advancing, the Scots determined to ſecure their prey, with which they were too much incumbered to fight with advantage, and continued their march to their own country <note n="1" place="bottom">Ibid. Fordun, II, 391. Winton, 823.</note>. The peſtilence had not quite abated, and it's importation revenged the enemy for their loſs; this being the third great attack of this calamity in Scotland, and in which not leſs than one third part of it's people is ſaid to have periſhed <note n="2" place="bottom">Fordun, ib. Winton, 825.</note>.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0141700201:36"/>The Earl of Northumberland meditated an active revenge, till he was prevented by an unexpected order from the king to defer the matter to the determination of the next ſolemn day for the affairs of the marches <note n="3" place="bottom">Walſ. 249.</note>. But fifteen hundred Engliſh, chiefly of Cumberland, advanced into Scotland with fire and ſword, till falling into an ambuſcade of five hundred foes, on diſadvantageous ground, many were ſlain, or drowned in the Solway in their flight, and ſome were made captives <note n="4" place="bottom">Winton, 824.

               <p>Happy it is for the two kingdoms, intended by their ſituation for perpetual union, that thoſe unceaſing inroads, deſtructive of cultivation and of trade, and which enriched the idle and the bad at the expence of the good and induſtrious, now only haraſs the march of the hiſtorian; who loſt, as in the moving ſands of a deſert, ſighs for the pleaſing landſcape of peace, or the grandeur of ſome important ſcene.</p>
               <p>The Duke of Lancaſter, who managed the councils of his ſovereign, had aſſumed the title of King of Caſtile; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to proſecute his pretenſions to that kingdom, ariſing from his marriage with the daughter of Peter the cruel, by aſſiſting the Portugueze againſt the reigning prince <note n="5" place="bottom">Rapin, Acta Regia, ſub anno.</note>. It was improtant to his purpoſe that a truce ſhould be eſtabliſhed with Scotland, either by the terrors of a deciſive war, or by the conciliating reſpect of an honourable embaſſy: and he reſolved to be himſelf the bearer of both. With a royal commiſſion to adjuſt the terms of peace, and with a formidable army, he advanced to borders of Scotland. This armed negociation was ſucceſsful; for, in anſwer to his invitation, the biſhops of Dunkeld and Glaſgow, the Earls of Douglas and March, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0141700201:37"/>Archibald Douglas lord of Galloway, appeared as commiſſioners from Scotland; and a truce was concluded at Berwick to laſt for one year <note n="6" place="bottom">Rymer, VII, 268, 276.</note>. <note place="margin">Nov.</note> The Engliſh, not apprized of Lancaſter's original intentions, murmured to ſee their northern counties conſumed by his numerous army: and the expence of the negotiation, which ended in delaying the ranſom of David II, and in other conceſſions, enereaſed their diſcontent <note n="7" place="bottom">Walſ. 254.

               <p>According to an agreement made in concluding the truce, <note place="margin">1381 June</note> Lancaſter again proceeded to Scotland in the following ſummer, but only with his uſual train; and he was inſtigated to uſe his beſt endeavours for a treaty by a promiſe of the Engliſh council that, if he could confirm a truce for three years, they ſhould aſſert his pretenſions to Caſtile, and furniſh him with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent force to join with that of Portugal <note n="8" place="bottom">Froiſſart, II, fol. 79.</note>. Meeting the Earl of Carric, heir of the kingdom, and other Scotiſh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, at Alcheſter near Aytown, an important conference enſued. The Scots complained that, during the truce of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years, many infractions had been made by the Engliſh upon their freedom of intercourſe and commerce with England, eſtabliſhed by that truce; and the fact being denied, they offered to ſubmit the evidence to an equal number of noblemen of both nations: but the Engliſh waved the affair, by offering the vague expedient of calling in the mediation of ſome neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring ſovereign. Lancaſter however conſented that the payment of any further part of the ranſom ſhould be deferred till Candlemas 1383, to which period the treaty was extended; and agreed again to meet the Earl of Carric in July that year <note n="9" place="bottom">Rymer, VII, 312.</note>. The inſurrection of Wat Tyler prevented the Duke's imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate return to England, he being apprehenſive of the fury of

               <p>A truce of one year concluded between England and France <note place="margin">1383</note> contributed ſtill further to give a reſpite to the horrors of war: and as treaties were, in that age, underſtood only to bind the ſovereigns who contracted, and not their heirs, the Scotiſh king ſent an embaſſy to the ſucceeding French monarch Charles VI, who engaged when war ſhould recommence between England and Scotland, to ſend to the latter kingdom one thouſand men at arms; a formidable force at that period, in which a few knights in panoply were wont to defeat armies of rude infantry. He alſo promiſed a thouſand ſets of armour for as many Scotiſh gentlemen; and a ſum of money to conciliate the court and nobles to enterprizes certainly foreign to the real intereſts of their country <note n="2" place="bottom">Regiſter fol. 69. Du Tillet, Recueil f. v. 116. Charles VI had ſucceeded his father on the 16th Sept. 1380. The treaty was ſigned at Paris on the 8th April, and ratified by Robert on the 20th Auguſt, 1383. Regiſter fol. 69, 70.</note>. The ignominious barter of the blood, and proſperity, of the nation for French gold cannot be palliated, but by the confeſſion that it was neceſſary to maintain an active alliance with France; and that the ſums drawn from that country were reputed a compenſation to Scotland for being commonly engaged in war ſolely by her ally. To ſuppoſe that any treaty exiſted, preceding the unhappy and imprudent reign of John Baliol, is to ſuppoſe that France was capable of the utmoſt treachery and impolicy, when ſhe permitted the ruin of Scotland by Edward I; and that the Scots were ſo
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0141700201:39"/>improvident as to ſubmit the determination of their crown to an inimical ſovereign, inſtead of their ancient ally <note n="3" place="bottom">"That old league, counted amongſt the fables of the ancient Palladines." Drum. Hift. p. 22.</note>. And even after the active alliance appears, during the reign of David II, an alliance to be written with the tears, and ſigned with the blood, of Scotland, ſcarcely can hiſtory mention one war, into which France did not conduct that country. But had Scotland been bleſſed with a more free and democratic government, her peace, her induſtry, her learning, her happineſs, had not been ſacrificed to a corrupt ariſtocracy; for as to the Monarch, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that he wiſhed for peace, and had the public intereſt at heart, how could he at once reject the deſire of a neceſſary ally, and the wiſhes of an uncontrouled nobility?</p>
               <p>The Duke of Lancaſter and the Earl of Carric again met; <note place="margin">July</note> and the latter agreed to a compenſation for ſome damage done by the Scotiſh borderers this year to the caſtle of Wark, and other places in England: but a definitive treaty being again mentioned, Carric declared that he had no powers for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and the conference diſſolved without any further renewal of the pacification <note n="4" place="bottom">Rymer, VII, 403.

               <p>The truce being thus permitted to expire, <note place="margin">1384</note> a war of real importance, and of a ſingular and intereſting complexion, took place. <note place="margin">Oct. to July</note> France had made a brief truce with England, after the part both had taken in the Flemiſh commotions, to laſt till midſummer this year: but, by ſome neglect, Scotland had not been included, and this circumſtance was eſteemed ſufficient to juſtify an invaſion of that country. The Duke of Lancaſter, and the Earls of Northumberland and Nottingham, with a conſiderable army, <note place="margin">Eaſter 28 Mar.</note> entered Scotland by Berwick, and ravaged the country up to the walls of Edinburgh, then, as now, the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0141700201:40"/>capital city <note n="5" place="bottom">Froiſſart, II, fol. 159. He informs us, f. 170, that Edinburgh was not ſo large as Tournay, or Valenciennes; but contained only about four thouſand houſes.</note>: from an amiable regard for a place, which had been his aſylum on a recent occaſion, Lancaſter would not permit the deſtruction of Edinburgh, but withdrew his army; and, with an inadequate prey, regained England, before the Scots, who were unprepared, could intercept his retreat <note n="6" place="bottom">Fordun, II, 398.

Both recite a defeat of a party of the Engliſh, who had landed from their veſſels near Queensferry: and the continuator of Fordun piouſly aſcribes it to the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of St. Columba, whoſe monaſtery in an iſland of the Forth they had attempted to conſume with fire.</note>. A few villages were burned in this expedition; but the Scotiſh houſes were then ſlight huts of wood, and eaſily refitted: and they found time to remove their cattle, and effects, into the foreſts, and even to carry off the ſtraw roofs of the houſes in the capital, as ſome ſecurity againſt a conflagration <note n="7" place="bottom">Walſ. 334, a curious and minute account; but the hiſtorian is prejudiced againſt the generous Lancaſter, the patron of the Wicklifites.

We learn from Froiſſart that Robert ſummoned an army, but that the French envoys mean time arrived to notify the truce: although about thirty French knights and eſquires, finding no further employ in Flanders, now came to Scotland as a theatre of arms <note n="8" place="bottom">Froiſſ. II, f. 159.</note>. The King wiſhed for peace; but the barons oppoſed his intentions, and meeting in the church of St. Giles at Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh reſolved on war, and informed the French knights that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0141700201:41"/>their ſpirit ſhould be immediately called into action. Without the avowal of the King an expedition was ſet on foot, and 15000 of ſuch cavalry as Scotland then had were aſſembled on the borders; who ravaged the lands belonging to Northumberland, Nottingham, and Mowbray, and returned loaded with ſpoil, before the Engliſh had time to collect any force <note n="9" place="bottom">Froiſſ.

The Earl of Northumberland ravaged the ſouth of Scotland again; and as ſoon as he diſmiſſed his army the Scots retaliated; ſo that the ſummer paſſed in mutual inroads <note n="1" place="bottom">Walſ. 336.</note>.</p>
               <p>The French knights taking leave, the Scotiſh barons deſired them to ſend their friends, to enter this new career of glory, by carrying the war into England; and it is ſaid that Jehan de Vienne, Admiral of France, and other potent perſons of that country, were inſtigated by their diſcourſes upon their return, as much as by the recent treaty, to fulfill its conditions next year <note n="2" place="bottom">Froiſſ.

               <p>At this time the papal influence, which had increaſed in Scotland by a bull of Gregory XI againſt intromiſſions with the effects of deceaſed biſhops <note n="3" place="bottom">Fordun, II, 389.</note>, was honoured with an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſupport in Wardlaw biſhop of Glaſgow, who was raited to the rank of Cardinal, and appointed Legate a Latere for Scotland and Ireland with ample powers <note n="4" place="bottom">Ibid. 400.</note>. The commons, who alone conſtitute a people or nation, ſeem only to have been regarded as patient objects of increaſed exactions both by the nobility and clergy. Few other events of importance hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened this year.

Near Martinmas the Scots gained the caſtle of Berwick, by bribing the deputy governor; and Lancaſter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the Engliſh parliament to condemn Northumberland, the warden of the marches, as guilty of criminal neglect, or greater baſeneſs upon this occaſion.

               <p>A ſingular fluctuation, between war and peace, <note place="margin">1385</note> now pervaded the diſtracted counſels of England and France, alike governed by weak monarchs. In the preceding ſummer the duke of Lancaſter for England, the dukes of Berry and Burgundy for France, cardinal Wardlaw and the biſhop of Dunkeld, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, for Scotland, had met at Leilinghen, between Calais and Boulogne, and concluded a ſolemn truce; which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ratified by Robert <note n="7" place="bottom">See this famous treaty, Veſp.

To preſerve Roxburgh from a ſimilar fate the baron of Grayſtock was ſent as governor with a powerful ſupply: he was intercepted by the Earl of March at Benrig, the convoy ſeized, many of his people ſlain, and he himſelf led captive to the caſtle of Dunbar <note n="1" place="bottom">Fordun, II, 397.

               <p>The national council met at Edinburgh, <note place="margin">April</note> but its ordinances were chiefly of a military or a private nature. Charge was given that the noblemen, to whoſe government certain diſtricts had been committed during the war, ſhould prepare their forces, and order them not to pillage in advancing to the borders: and that John Earl of Carric who, in the council of laſt November, had taken upon himſelf the adminiſtration of ſome points of juſtice, ſhould proceed to the highlands, and call the chiefs into his preſence to reform the outrages loudly complained of in thoſe regions. The inhabitants of Tividale, now reſtored to the Scotiſh allegiance by Douglas, were ordered to produce their titles <note n="2" place="bottom">Regiſter, fol. 72, 73. The highland plunderers are termed <hi>Ketherani</hi> or Kerns. William de Fenton complained that the baron of Dirlton had taken his houſe, and twice expelled him when reſtored by law: the royal force and aid are ordered to reeſtabliſh him. A ſad proof of the barbariſm of the country, where the laws had no force ſo near the capital. David Earl of Strathern accuſes his brother Buchan for retaining the barony of Urquhart, which had only been let to him by Strathern: to avoid ſcandal an agreement was recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended. Carric was deſired to diſpatch letters of royal authority to Buchan, to diſcover Finlay Lawſon, and the two ſons of Harald Foulſon, who had ſlain fume men of Moray, and to bring them and their accomplices to juſtice.</note>. This parliament was afterwards prorogued to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0141700201:44"/>the twelfth of June, when it iſſued ſome regulations concerning the coin <note n="3" place="bottom">Regiſter, fol. 74.

               <p>But an event of which there had been no example in Scotiſh hiſtory, and which fortunately was not repeated till the six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth century, is to arreſt attention by its novelty, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.</p>
               <p>The government of France determined if poſſible to deliver that country from the repeated invaſions of the Engliſh, by carrying the war into England from its northern limits, in conjunction with the Scots, and in compliance with the terms of the late treaty. Jehan de Vienne, Admiral of France, a leader of the firſt talents and diſtinction, accordingly failed from Sluys in Flanders with a thouſand men at arms, <note place="margin">May</note> knights and eſquires, twelve hundred complete ſuits of armour for Scotiſh gentlemen, and a large ſum of money <note n="4" place="bottom">Froiſſart, II, fol. 164, 166.

Admiral of France, and knight of the order of the Annonciade; his father was Guillaume de Vienne lord of Rollans, one of the moſt ancient nobles of Burgundy. After many eminent ſervices, Jehan de Vienne attended the duke of Bourbon to the ſiege of Carthage, 1390, and was ſlain at the raſh battle of Nicopolis againſt the Turks, 26th Sept. 1396, where this veteran led the van and performed prodigies of valour.

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0141700201:45"/>intended at the ſame time to attack England on the ſouth with a powerful armament; but this part of the deſign was aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, after an enormous expence incurred in the preparations <note n="5" place="bottom">Froiſſart, II, fol. 166.

Vienne's navy amounted to ſixty veſſels; and the Engliſh had prepared a fleet, and a <hi>fire-ſhip,</hi> to aſſail them. Ib. p. 47.</note>. Yet her declared intentions, and the vigour and importance of her plans, raiſed ſuch an alarm in England, that all her power and reſources were excited to repell the attack: and the failure of the ſouthern invaſion collected the whole tempeſt upon Scotland, and ſhook that kingdom to the center. Vienne arrived at Leith with his choſen battalion, which, to uſe the phraſe of Froiſſart, formed one flower of chivalry; and they were quartered in the villages around Edinburgh, till the King, then in the country, ſhould arrive at that capital. The French hiſtorian upon this occaſion preſents a deplorable picture of the ſtate of Scotland and its people. The poverty of the country, and the barbariſm of the nation, appear to have been extreme: the ſlighteſt accommodations of life, or even of war, could hardly be procured: every article of iron, or of leather, was imported from Flanders. The French at firſt laughed, and ſaid that they were happy to know by experience the hardſhips of penury, and the dark ſide of a military life; but, as their diſcontent increaſed, Vienne could ſcarcely appeaſe their murmurs. On the other hand the Scots were not leſs diſſatisfied with their gueſts; they defamed and hated their auxiliaries, as ſtrangers of an unknown ſpeech, as the future ſharers of their prey, and as the preſent conſumers of their little property <note n="6" place="bottom">Froiſſ.

An army of about thirty thouſand, mounted on ſmall horſes, aſſembled near Edinburgh, under the command of the Earls of Fife and Douglas; and marched, in conjunction with the French chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry, towards Roxburgh. Entering the Engliſh territory, they deſtroyed two ſmall forts, aſſaulted and took the caſtle of Wark; and advancing burned ſeveral villages in Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and ravaged the country from Berwick to Newcaſtle. But their progreſs was ſoon impeded by the tidings that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter was approaching with a great array; and it was reſolved to ſecure the prey by returning into Scotland.

               <p>Meanwhile Richard II had made great preparations, and ſummoned almoſt the whole force of his kingdom; and finding that the commotions in Flanders had fruſtrated the ſouthern

If we credit an Engliſh hiſtorian his army was numerous beyong precedent; and more than three hundred thouſand horſes were employed in various ſervices <note n="1" place="bottom">Walf. 342.</note>. The youthful monarch choſe this as his firſt expedition, and ſolemn entry into the field of military fame; and was attended by his uncles, and by the chief nobles of England. The deſtruction of the abbey of Melroſe, long reſpected by the religious awe of the Engliſh, to whom it had afforded early ſaints and teachers, was the firſt warlike act of Richard II, the diſgrace of his arms and the omen of his mental weakneſs. Dryburgh, and newbottel, two venerable monaſteries, and Edinburgh with her churches, were ſucceſſively given to the flames. The Scots, unable openly to contend with an enemy ſo ſuperior in numbers, prudently followed the advice aſcribed to Robert the Great, by withdrawing their cattle and effects into foreſts, and wilds; and harraſſing their foes by unceaſing ambuſcades and excurſions. The green crops were alone left; and the harveſt was trampled and deſtroyed. After remaining five days at Edinburgh, the Engliſh marched to Stirling, which, with an abbey adjacent, was burnt to the ground. One hundred and twenty veſſels carried proviſions for the army, which ſtill ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing deſtroyed Perth and Dundee, and many abbies and monaſteries: and the couriers and vanguard even proceeded as far as Aberdeen, according to Froiſſart; but, from the old Engliſh and Scotiſh accounts, it rather appears that the Engliſh expedition only extended to the river Forth <note n="2" place="bottom">Froiſſ.

               <p>To divert the fury of this ſtorm, the Scotiſh army and French auxiliaries entered England by the weſtern marches,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0141700201:48"/>ravaged Cumverland, and beſieged Carliſle. This invaſion concurred with the failure of proviſions to induce the Engliſh king to withdraw his vaſt army; which accordingly returned towards England by the eaſtern tract; and diſunited councils prevented an encounter with the Scots, who alſo retired to their own country by the weſtern boundaries <note n="3" place="bottom">Froiſſ. II, f. 182. Walſ. 344, ſays the Scots took more prey than the Engliſh king, "cum imperiali exercitu."</note>. Such was the iſſue of a conteſt, which had excited ſo great expectation; and which, as uſual, far from being advantageous to either king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ended with the laſting detriment of both. At the cloſe of the campaign, the French auxiliaries, exhauſted with fatigue and hard fare, could not even procure leave to ſail for Flanders, till they conſented to pay the expence of their maintenance; and Vienne was forced to remain as an hoſtage till the ſum was paid at Bruges, to Scotiſh factors, by order of the French government <note n="4" place="bottom">Froiſſ. II, 183. This honeſt writer vents his rage againſt the Scots, "car oncques ſi mauvaiſes gens ne virent, ne ne trouverent ſi faulx, et ſi trahyſires, ne de ſi petite congnoiſſance." The French had equally diſguſted the Scots by their uſual petulance; and Vienne himſelf had ventured on an affair of gallantry with a near relation of the king, to the amazement of their plain and pious allies, ſtrangers to ſuch manners.

               <p>After a doubtful truce of nearly one year, <note place="margin">1387</note> the war continued it's progreſs. William Douglas, whoſe graceful perſon and warlike fame had procured him the hand of the king's daughter Egidia, and the title of lord Nithſdale, reſolved to open a long neglected field of action, by invading Ireland. Attended only by five hundred men he failed to Carlingford, and aſſaulted the town, whoſe inhabitants being no ſtrangers to his military reputation, reſolved to oppoſe guile to force, and begged a reſpite till they could collect a ſum ſufficient to ranſom the place. The Scotiſh leader, whoſe honeſt courage ſuſpected no fraud, conſented; and was occupied in repleniſhing his ſhips with proviſions, while the people of Carlingford ſent to Dundalk, and procured an aid of eight hundred horſe, which joined their own array and advanced againſt the enemy. Nithſdale had only two hundred of his followers on ſhore, from the want of proper boats for landing, and even theſe few were divided, a party having been ſent to ravage the country. The Engliſh reſolved to attack both parties, but the greater number advanced againſt Nithſdale; after an obſtinate conteſt the Scots obtained the victory; and they immediately took, ravaged, and burned the town of Carlingford, deſpoiled the caſtle, and loaded fifteen Iriſh ſhips, then in the harbour, with their prey. On their return the iſle of Man preſented another object of depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation:

               <p>The weak, <note place="margin">1388</note> and impolitic, conduct of Richard II diſtracted the Engliſh councils, and diſcontent pervaded the nation, when the Scots thought the time convenient to retort the ravages of war, which that monarch had carried into their country.

When the army therefore aſſembled at Jedburgh, he appeared as commander in chief: and to as complete, and firm, battalions as Scotland had ever ſent forth, was added the terror of the name of Douglas. About twelve hundred lances, and forty thouſand rude infantry, compoſed an army, rendered ſtill more formidable by the reputation and experience of ſome of its leaders.

Without further apology Froiſſart's account of this expedition, crowned by the celebrated battle of Otter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn, ſhall be followed; and only with one cauſe of regret, that it is the laſt aid to be derived from that remakable writer, the worthy and honeſt herald of the times of chivalry <note n="9" place="bottom">The ſubſequent narrative is derived from Tome III, f. 108—117, edit. 1518, 4to; compared with the edition of Verard about 1498, and the MSS.

               <p>The Northumbrians, having learned that a Scotiſh army was collecting, reſolved to prepare; and, if the Scots entered England by the weſtern, to repay the invaſion by the eaſtern marches. An Engliſh gentleman went to eſpy the intentions of the enemy, who had advanced to the chapel of Salom, a noted ſtation near the borders: and entering the chapel in the diſguiſe of a ſervant ſaw the Scotiſh nobles aſſembled, and heard much of their deſigns. When he withdrew he expected to have found his horſe tied to a tree, as he had left him, but he was ſtolen; and the gentleman's fear, or negligence of art, in walking away without any enquiry, led to ſuſpicion. He was ſeized, and confeſſed that the Northumbrians, unable to encounter the inimical numbers, had determined on whatever ſide England was invaded, to aſſail Scotland on the oppoſite. This induced the Scotiſh leaders to reſtrain the main army to the protection of their own country, and to order only a ſtrong detachment, under the tried heroiſm of the Earl of Douglas, to advance into England. At the head of three hundred men
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0141700201:52"/>at arms, and of two thouſand choſen infantry, Douglas pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, without pillaging the country or attacking any place; paſſed the Tine three miles above Newcaſtle; and, with the ſuddenneſs and deſtruction of lightning, darted on the county of Durham. When the diſtant flames, and ſmoke, of burning villages had given the firſt tidings of the Scotiſh arrival, the Earl of Northumberland, then at Alnwick, ſent his two ſons, Henry and Ralph, to Newcaſtle, to aſſemble a force in purſuit of the enemy, while he ſhould gather another on the north, and preclude their retreat. All the country being pillaged to the gates of York <note n="1" place="bottom">This is confeſſed by the Engliſh monarch himſelf, in a deed publiſhed by Rymer, VII, 594.</note>, and the unfortified towns and villages deſtroyed, Douglas returned with the ſpoil, repaſſed the Tine at the ſame place; and came before newcaſtle, whither the cheif people of the neighbouring counties had crouded, to gain the protection of a walled city, and of the two gallant Percies, Henry ſurnamed Hotſpur, and Ralph, his brother in birth and arms. Many ſkirmiſhes enſuing, at one of them Douglas won the pennon of Henry Percy, to the great mortification of that undaunted leader and of his followers: and to add to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace Douglas vaounted, "This I ſhall carry as a ſign of thy proweſs to Scotland, and ſhall place it on the pinnacle of my caſtle to be known by all." Percy retorted with an oath, "Thou ſhalt never bear it out of northumberland; and in the end ſhalt have little cauſe to boaſt:" to which Douglas replied, "Then thou muſt come this night, and take it from before my tent." Next morning the Scots purſued their march; and, aſſailing a caſtle without ſucceſs, wiſhed to proceed, but Douglas commanded them to encamp, in order to ſee if Percy would advance to recover his pennon, and that, being refreſhed,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0141700201:53"/>they ſhould again attack the fortreſs in the morning. They accordingly fortified their ſtation with felled trees, to prevent a ſurprize; and next day captured the caſtle, and purſued their journey towards the main army, till they came to Otterburn, a hamlet amid the wilds of the pariſh of Elſdon, about thirty miles northweſt of Newcaſtle, and about twenty from the Scotiſh borders, which was to be a ſcene of celebrity to the bard and to the hiſtorian.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile Percy wiſhed to purſue the Scotiſh detachment, but was reſtrained by the tidings that the main army was near, and ready to ſupport Douglas; till the couriers brought certain intelligence that they were far diſtant, and incapable of effecting a junction for ſome days. Percy, with his uſual impetuoſity, inſtantly cried, "To horſe!" it being early in the morning; and left Newcaſtle attended by ſix hundred lances, or knights and ſquires, and eight thouſand infantry accoutred with the dreadful long-bows of England. After a forced march, they reached the Scotiſh camp at Otterburn late in the evening. The Scots had ſupped, ſome had even retired to reſt fatigued with various exertion; and the Engliſh began to enter the outer entrenchment, where the ſervants were ſtationed, ſhouting "Percy! Percy!" but they found it well fortified. Some infantry was ordered to ſupport the ſervants, by the Scotiſh chiefs, who in the mean time armed in haſte, and arrayed their men under their banners. Night was now advanced; but the moon ſhone clear in a ſerene ſky of the month of Auguſt. <note place="margin">19 Aug.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The Scots, armed, and arranged, proceeded, not towards the aſſailants, but around an eminence; and attacking the enemy in the rear raiſed all at once the cry of battle, upon which the Engliſh in ſurprize turned, ſtrengthened their ranks, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded "Percy!" in anſwer to the Scotiſh acclaim of "Douglas." After a ſevere conteſt the Scots were on the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0141700201:54"/>point of yielding to numbers, when the Earl of Douglas, ardently puſhed forward his banner; and both the Percies advanced againſt him, with equal impetuoſity, ſo that the Scots recoiled, and, had not the valour of the two Hepburns oppoſed, the banner of Douglas had been taken. Douglas, irritated by the apprehenſion of diſgrace, rouzed all his ſtrength and courage; and, brandiſhing a two-handed battle-ax, opened the thick files of the foe, as with a long avenue, deſpiſing numerous blows, and committing his life to the temper of his armour. He had advanced far from his battalions, when he fell under three mortal wounds. But ignorance of his fate forbad the Engliſh to triumph, and the Scots to deſpair. The former only ſaw that ſome valiant man at arms had fallen: and the latter were inſpirited by the Earls of March and Moray to follow a tract, which they knew not had conducted their leader to death. Fortune now began to favour the Scots. Ralph Percy, advancing too far in return, was ſeverly wounded, and taken priſoner by Maxwell, a knight who followed Moray: and the Engliſh, exhauſted with a fatiguing march and an obſtinate conteſt, bagan to exhibit ſymptoms of depreſſion and defeat.</p>
               <p>Douglas, faint with the loſs of blood, and ſenſible of the approaches of death, was defended by his valiant chaplain, William of Northberwick. His banner lay on the ground, not far from him, the bearer being ſlain, when Lindſay, Sinclair, and ſome other knights, pierced through the now yielding foe, and reached the ſpot, and beſpoke their general. Even trifles in ſuch a converſation are intereſting. "Couſin, how goes it?" ſaid Sinclair. Douglas anſwered "But ſo, ſo. Praiſed be God few of my anceſtors have died in chambers or beds—Avenge me, for I die—My heart faints too repeatedly. Raiſe again my banner, and ſhout Douglas! But tell neither
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0141700201:55"/>friend nor foe how it fares with me, for my enemies would exult, and my friends be diſconſolate." The banner was erected; the whole field reſound with the animating cry of Douglas! and the Scots, excited as with the voice of victory, inſtantly formed one phalanx, and with levelled ſpears puſhed the enemy to flight.</p>
               <p>Henry Percy was taken priſoner by Montgomery: and the defeat was complete. Radman, the governor of Berwick, was almoſt the only Engliſhman of note who eſcaped: and the Scots purſued the chaſe for five miles. The number of the Engliſh ſlain is computed at twelve hundred. Such was the battle at Otterburn, which Froiſſart repreſents as the moſt eminent fought in his time, for heroic bravery on both ſides, and the real ſpirit of war. He alſo highly applauds the courteſy ſhewn by the Scots to their priſoners; and obſerves that both nations were not leſs laudable for their benevolence after a battle, than for their courage during its rage <note n="2" place="bottom">Froiſſar, III, f. 113.</note>.</p>
               <p>Douglas was carried to his tent, where he ſoon expired: but, though diſpirited at the loſs of their leader, the Scots determined to maintain their ſtrong ſtation againſt the freſh Engliſh army which approached. For the biſhop of Durham had reached Newcaſtle, the night of the battle, with ſeven thouſand men, two thouſand of whom were cavalry: but a conjunction was prevented by Percy's impetuoſity. Advancing next morning he was met by the fugitives from Otterburn, whoſe tidings raiſed ſuch diſmay, that all his followers fled back to Newcaſtle, except five hundred, with whom the biſhop was at laſt alſo conſtrained to regain that city. Here he found means to inſpirit his followers, and the inhabitants; ſo that he marched next morning in queſt of the Scots attended by ten
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0141700201:56"/>thouſand. The Scotiſh ſcouts, the day after, notifying his approach, their chiefs determined not to leave their camp, as they had many wounded and priſoners to attend: and, when the biſhop came within a mile's diſtance, they began all at once to ſound their horns in a loud diſcordance of warlike muſic. After a pauſe, the ſame horrible din of defiance was repeated; and the biſhop arranging his hoſt, and advancing within two bow-ſhots, was again ſaluted with the thundering noiſe. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the ſtrength of the rude fortification, and that its poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors were too prudent to deſert its advantages, the Engliſh, after a brief council, retreated: and the Scots having refreſhed themſelves prepared to march. Ralph Percy requeſting per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to go to Newcaſtle, to have his wounds attended, the Earl of Moray conſented, and ordered him to be conveyed in a litter. The Scotiſh march, inſtead of triumphant ſeemed funereal, and the joy of ſucceſs was tempered with tears; for the body of Douglas, incloſed in a coffin, and borne on a car, formed the chief object in the progreſs <note n="3" place="bottom">Froiſſart, III, f. 117.</note>.</p>
               <p>The main army, under the Earl of Fife, who appears to have had but mean talents for war, was now lying near Carliſle; and not a little envied the ſucceſsful detachment; for the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and the gain by ranſoms, were eſteemed the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable which had occurred ſince the day of Bannockburn <note n="4" place="bottom">Ibid.

               <p>An aſſembly of the three eſtates being ſummoned to Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, <note place="margin">1389</note> ſolemnly recognized Robert Earl of Fife governor of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0141700201:57"/>the kingdom; an elevation for which he was apparently as much indebted to his own intrigues, as to the age of the king, and the weakneſs of the ſucceſſor <note n="5" place="bottom">Fordun, II, 414. Winton, 845.</note>. The latter ſeems, from the parliamentary acts of this reign, to have formerly ſtood in that high capacity: and the king commonly ſhunned the pomp, and, it is ſuſpected, the duties of royalty, by reſiding on his parental eſtate, and example followed by his ſucceſſor, though impolitic in an eminent degree. Preferring the remote man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Stuarts to the centrical and accuſtomed reſidences of the Scotiſh ſovereigns, they ſeemed to forget their rank, their office, their people; and removed form the ſcene of action, from the vital heart of the kingdom, the monarch could only be ſeen by the nation in a dangerous repreſentative. Aſſemblies of the ſtates ſeem to have been ſeldom held, an ariſtocratic council decided upon peace and war, and upon the beſt intereſts of the people; but this fault was common to England and moſt European kingdoms at this period; while the appointment of the ſecond ſon, as governor of the ſtate, to the prejudice of the heir apparent, may be regarded as a new and dangerous precedent, declarative of great weakneſs upon the one part, and upon the other of baneful ambition.</p>
               <p>The new Regent, deſirous to ſignalize the commencement of his power, aſſembled an army on the borders againſt the Earl of Nottingham, Marſhal of England, lately appointed Warden of the eaſtern marches; and who, in the uſual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitance of pride and weakneſs, had reproached the Percies for the loſs at Otterburn, where their army was far more numerous than that of the Scots; and boaſted that he hoped to vanquiſh, even if oppoſed by number doubling his own. But when Fife accompanied by Archibald, the ſucceeding Earl.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0141700201:58"/>of Douglas, and by other nobles, poured his array into England, the Earl Marſhal reſtrained his men in a ſecure and inacceſſible ſtation; and to a challenge of the Regent, inviting him to deſcend and fulfil his threats, he replied that "he had no orders to expoſe the lieges of his ſovereign to any danger." This anſwer was received with peals of laughter; and the Scotiſh army, after ſtanding in defiance half the day with banners diſplayed, ravaged the adjacent country, and returned <note n="6" place="bottom">Fordun, II, 414.

               <p>A reſpite was at length given to the war, <note place="margin">June</note> by a truce formed between France and England for three years, in which their allies were included <note n="7" place="bottom">Rymer, VII, 622.</note>. Thoſe of France were the kings of the Romans, Scotland, Arragon, Navarre; the Scotiſh Earl of March, the iſle of Man, the Ducheſs of Brabant, the Republic of Genoa. And the allies of England were the king of the Romans, with thoſe of Portugal and Arragon, the Earl of Saliſbury, the lordſhip of Man, the Duke of Gelder, John Lord of the Iſles of Scotland, and the Republic of Genoa. An embaſſy being ſent from England, to notify the truce, and deſire the conſent of Scotland, the envoys were by the Governor remitted to the king, who agreed as from deference to France. The Earls of Saliſbury and March appear to have been named in this truce, in conſequence of their claims to the iſle of Man, and ſome debateable lands upon the borders. The Lords of the Iſles were really inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of Scotland, and by their fleets maintained their power in the iſles, and over the weſtern highlands, while the Scotiſh kings had no fleet to oppoſe them, and could not attack mountainous regions inacceſſible to armies. The brief ard confined conqueſts of Alexander III and Robert I, had not
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0141700201:59"/>overcome the old Norwegian ſpirit; and the Hebudes muſt be regarded with truth as an independent principality, till the ſixteenth century: had the lords been told of their occaſional ſubmiſſion to Scotland, they would have retorted by inſtances of the like neceſſity forced upon that country be England. But the circumſtance, which eſpecially induced the mention of theſe princes in the truce, was a treaty concluded between Richard II, and the Lord of the Iſles, in the preceding year <note n="8" place="bottom">Rymer, VII, 592.</note>.</p>
               <p>This ſhort pacification was the laſt important act of Robert II, who died at his caſtle of Dundonald in Kyle, <note place="margin">1390 19 Apr.</note> a few miles ſouth of Irwin, after a ſhort illneſs, in the ſeventy fifth year of his age <note n="9" place="bottom">Fordun, II, 415.

Power depending wholly upon opinion, princes are often forced to ſacrifice even to the ſuperſtitions of the vulgar. Robert III had apparently exceeded his fiftieth year, when he began to reign, and had been wedded at leaſt thirty three years to Annabella Drummond, daughter of Sir John Drummond of Stobhall; by whom he had, however, no children till the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0141700201:61"/>year 1378, when David, afterwards Duke of Rothſay, was born; and James his other ſon did not appear till the fifth year of his father's reign, being the firſt royal birth in the family.

               <p>Though this monarch had been lamed by an unfortunate accident, yet his perſon was tall and graceful: his florid coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and vivacious eyes, joined with the ſnowy whiteneſs of his beard, rendered him an object at once pleaſing and majeſtic. But his indolent meekneſs, his piety, his ſaint-like humility, are fitter themes of praiſe to the monk than to the philoſopher, who knows that the virtues of a king are the virtues of ability, and of action; and that the moſt acceptable ſervice to the Deity conſiſts in the ſervice of mankind. The lenity of Robert III may be vindicated from the yet new eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a family, accuſtomed to regard the nobles as equals and brothers; but it unhappily tended to increaſe the power of the ariſtocracy, and add to the conſequent ſtock of public calamity. Yet the years of his reign were fertile, and the people were contented: though in the continuous ſtruggles with England for political freedom, it is no wonder that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal liberty made no progreſs; and that the Scots remembered that they were ſoldiers, but forgot that they were men <note n="3" place="bottom">For the character of Robert III compare Bowar II, 440.</note>.</p>
               <p>Before the coronation of the new ſovereign had taken place, an event occurred, ominous and diſgraceful to his reign. His

               <p>The inſanity of Charles VI of France, which appeared this ſummer, and the conſequent diſtracted ſtate of affairs in that kingdom, conſpired with the Engliſh diſcontents, under the maladminiſtration of Richard II, to render a prolongation of the truce of Leilinghen expedient; and it was accordingly extended at different times to Michaelmas 1394, <note place="margin">16 Aug.</note> and afterwards to the ſame term in 1398 <note n="8" place="bottom">Rymer, VII, 714, 769, &amp;c</note>. This conſtant repetition of truces between England and Scotland, unknown to any other hiſtory, is tedious and unpleaſing in every view. One is led to imagine that the ſyſtem of Hobbes is founded in truth, and that war is the natural ſtate of man. But peculiar circumſtances contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to this inveterate and lengthened enmity. The conduct of Edward I, when choſen the friendly arbiter of the diſputes concerning the Scotiſh ſucceſſion, was unkingly and ungenerous beyond example; and deſtroyed the moſt ſacred rules of ſociety, and every bond of mutual confidence, and of public faith. It
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0141700201:65"/>is no wonder then that the Scotiſh nation had converted all their antient regard for the Engliſh into a rooted enmity; and that the ſituation of the two nations confined on one iſland occaſioned continuous war. The ambition of ſovereigns, that chief ſcourge of mankind, and ſpring of ſlaughter, led the Engliſh kings to maintain the lofty pretenſions of Edward I, and untaught by experience to hope the vain conqueſt of Scotland; nor could they abandon their claims leſt juſtice ſhould be interpreted want of power, and the higheſt wiſdom accounted imbecility. Such evils could ariſe from the ambition of one man! The inadmiſſion, or dubious grant, of the title of the Scotiſh ſovereigns, was an inſult to them, and to the nation; which, with the unjuſt pretenſions on the one ſide, and jealouſy and revenge on the other, precluded all hopes of ſolid and laſting peace. When we find Henry VIII, in 1542, repeating the extravagant claims of the firſt Edward, almoſt in his own words, we muſt exult in thoſe happy events which terminated a diſcord that threatened to be perpetual <note n="9" place="bottom">In 1394 occur two letters from Annabella queen of Scotland to Richard II.

After celebrating the Aſcenſion of the Virgin at Hadington, Henry marched to Leith, where he remained three days, and made repeated aſſaults on the caſtle of Edinburgh, which was bravely defended by the Duke of Rothſay, attended by the Earl of Douglas, and many noblemen and gentlemen of the ſouthern part of Scotland. Mean time the Duke of Albany had collected a copious army, and advanced to Caldermoor in Eaſt Lothian. A ſingular intercourſe took place between the Engliſh king, and the Dukes of Rothſay, and Albany. Rothſay ſent a meſſage to the invader, that his pretenſions to the Scotiſh crown might occaſion the effuſion of much chriſtian blood, which to prevent, he was willing to ſettle the diſpute by a
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0141700201:73"/>combat of one, two, or three nobles, againſt an equal number of the Engliſh. Henry parried this amiable ſally of youthful vivacity by a piece of wit; anſwering, that he was ſurprized that Rothſay, who ſhewed ſuch averſion to ſhed chriſtian blood, ſhould propoſe a combat of the nobles, whoſe blood was certainly chriſtian. Albany, on his ſide, ſent a letter promiſing that, if Henry would keep his ſtation for ſix days, he ſhould give him battle, and either die in the field, or force him to raiſe the ſiege. The Engliſh monarch, with his uſual ſpirit, gave his royal word that he ſhould await the term mentioned; and to teſtify his pleaſure at the tidings he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the herald his upper garment, and a chain of gold.

               <p>Henry's lenity and moderation, during the whole of this expedition, were remarkable, and ſufficiently contraſt his character with that of Richard II; whoſe outrage proclaims his weakneſs; while this invaſion ſhewed that cruelty and deſtruction are ſeldom the companions of courage and wiſdom. To the towns, villages, monaſteries, and even fortreſſes, which ſubmitted, he inſtantly ſent a banner, painted with his arms, to be diſplayed as the fixed ſignal that none of his army ſhould approach them. And when two Canons of Holyroodhouſe came into his preſence at Leith, to requeſt the preſervation of their monaſtery, he anſwered with great affability, "Far be from my arms the diſgrace of moleſting any holy church, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially your's, in which my father, the duke of Lancaſter, found a refuge. I am myſelf half a Scotiſhman, being a Comyn by
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0141700201:74"/>maternal deſcent; and I call God to witneſs that nothing but groſs provocation could have brought me here as a foe. But there are in your government people who write letters in a ſingular ſtyle: and my intention is little to injure the country, but to ſee if the writer dare to maintain his words, by meeting in battle him whom he terms a traitor." Finding that Albany declined an engagement, and not thinking the caſtle of Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh an object worthy of longer delay, or deſpairing of taking that fortreſs; perhaps even unwilling to expoſe to the chance of deſtruction a place which had afforded an aſylum to his father; Henry raiſed the ſiege, and withdrew his army into England <note n="9" place="bottom">Bowar, 430. Winton, 881, mentions the deſtruction of the houſe of Dalhouſie, as the ſole ravage of Henry's arms.</note>. It is not improbable, at the ſame time, that a failure of proviſion, and the rumoured inſurrection of Owen Glendour in Wales, afforded ſtrong arguments for this retreat.</p>
               <p>But if it be difficult to account for the motives of Henry, what are we to think of thoſe of Albany upon this occaſion? At the head of a numerous army, he was the idle ſpectator of a triumphant enemy in the heart of his country; and beheld with indifference the danger of the heir apparent, whoſe ranſom muſt have coſt the nation an immenſe ſum. The prudence of declining a battle with the force of England, conducted by the monarch, ſeems to have been fully eſtabliſhed in Scotiſh politics, by the latter maxims of Robert I: and the modern axiom, that battles are the iſſue of ignorance, and that a weak general fights when he knows not what to do, was apparently not unknown in former times. So much may be offered in Albany's vindication. But the character of this man will ſoon develope all its blackneſs; and the conſiſtency of wicked am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition muſt force us to infer that, to ſuch a mind, baſe motives
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0141700201:75"/>muſt be the moſt effectual. Our ancient accounts aſcribe Albany's conduct to a previous enmity with Rothſay <note n="1" place="bottom">Bowar, 430.</note>; and it is probable that this gallant youth, conſcious of his birth and expected royalty, ſaw with impatience his father, his king, his country, under ſuch mean controul. Apparently a coward, certainly unknown in war, Albany might from baſeneſs decline the combat with a bold and capable monarch; and from yet greater baſeneſs might have exulted to ſee, in the capture or death of Rothſay, the ſecurity, the prolongation, of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency.</p>
               <p>Some events, which preceded the Engliſh invaſion, have been reſerved to this place, in order to preſent a clear and connected account of internal tranſactions in Scotland, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting and important in an eminent degree. The King's infirmities increaſed with his age, and the Duke of Albany muſt be regarded as the chief agent, in affairs, which, from the monarch's reſidence on diſtant parental eſtates, ſometimes hardly reached the royal ear, except by the voice of the nation. It is to be regreted that the meagreneſs of our annals ſeldom permits a near acquaintance with hiſtorical characters, till the reign of the firſt James. Suſpended in the darkneſs of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and the diſtance of time, the portraits rarely appear diſtinct, except when enlightened by the ſplendor of the diadem. Hence ariſes a barrenneſs in an intereſting province of hiſtory, the varied and ſtrong delineation of character, ſo neceſſary to form juſt and complete ideas of important events.</p>
               <p>The Duke of Rothſay had now attained his twenty ſecond year; and his mental features nearly reſemble thoſe of the prince of Wales his contemporary. That warm efferveſcence of vigorous youth, which tamed by reaſon, experience, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0141700201:76"/>time, affords mature materials of a firm and ſpirited character, had led him into ſome exceſſes, eſpecially of the amorous kind, which afforded pretexts of conſtraint from his uncle the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, and of reproof from his royal parents. A fondneſs for riotous paſtime and arch roguery were alſo laid to the prince's charge; who, to candid eyes, ſufficiently compenſated theſe youthful and trivial defects by his good qualities. Endued with a comely perſon, an honeſt heart, an able head, a moſt ſweet and affable temper, and even deeply tinctured with learning for that century, his virtues, and not his vices, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the regent's enmity <note n="2" place="bottom">Bowar, 431.

               <p>Robert III only knew his own ſon from the malicious reports of Albany; but the queen Annablella, formerly famed for beauty, and ſtill for ſenſe, ſpirit, and generoſity, was not the dupe of ſuch practices, and appears to have ſuggeſted the marriage of the prince, as a proper and uſual expedient to overcome his wildneſs, by the ſweetneſs of lawful love, and domeſtic ties. This project muſt have alarmed Albany, and he employed every reſource of little cunning to defeat it, while he did not dare a public oppoſition. To bring the ſcheme into contempt, to gratify his own avarice, to ſow diſſentions and obſtacles, to procure delay and perhaps abandonment, he held up the marriage of his prince to ſale among the peers of Scotland, inſtead of demanding a foreign princeſs, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions might have aided her huſband, and have overturned
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0141700201:77"/>the regent's ambitious plans. The Earl of March, a friend of Albany, was the higheſt bidder; and having paid a large ſum, his daughter Elizabeth was affianced to Rothſay. But at the inſtigation of the king's council, the Earl of Douglas, Archibald the Grim, oftered a larger ſum, which was alſo received; and the regent not daring to trifle with that illuſtrious family, the prince actually married Marjory, the daughter of Douglas, at Bothwell <note n="3" place="bottom">Bowar, 428.</note>.</p>
               <p>The only excuſe oftered to March was, that the conſent of the three eſtates had not been procured to the marriage; and as no meeting of parliament is mentioned, it is to be preſumed that in this rude age the king's council, conſiſting of members clerical, noble, and common, was regarded as repreſenting the three eſtates, when inconvenient to ſummon that formidable body. Nay the repayment of the ſum advanced was refuſed, or delayed; and March, burning with indignation, procured a ſafe conduct from the king of England, and retired to that country, leaving his caſtle of Dunbar in the cuſtody of Sir Robert Maitland <note n="4" place="bottom">The firſt letter of March to Henry, as above mentioned, is dated Dunbar, 18 Feb. It ſtates that he is greatly wronged by Rothſay, who eſpouſed his daughter, and though bound by his letter and ſeal, is about to marry another: the earl requeſts help as the kinſman of Henry, Alice de Beaumont being <hi>gud-dame</hi> (grand-mother) of Henry, and Marjory Comyn her full ſiſter, <hi>gud-dame</hi> of March. He offers his own allegiance, and that of his vaſſals: deſires that lord Furneval, or Weſtmoreland, be ſent to confer with him; and a ſafe conduct for himſelf and 100 followers. After apologizing for writing in Engliſh, as he underſtands that ſpeech better than latin or French, he ſigns in French, "Le Count de la Marche d'Eſcoce." Veſp. F. VII, f. 22. Furneval was ſent, ib. f. 39, n. 2. On the 13th of March Weſtmoreland was commiſſioned to enquire the determination of the Scotiſh earl. Ib. f. 78. But the preciſe date of March's retreat into England is not apparent; though it ſeems that he remained in Scotland till he met Henry at Newcaſtle on the 25th of July. See Redpath, 369.</note>. After the retreat of Henry an army was
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0141700201:78"/>raiſed to beſiege that important fortreſs, which if betrayed to the Engliſh, might have afforded a dangerous poſt to the enemy; and Robert III himſelf appeared as general: but, before he reached Dunbar, Maitland was intimidated and yielded the caſtle to the ſon of Douglas <note n="5" place="bottom">Bowar, 429.</note>. If the Scotiſh king had no opportunity to ſhew his martial talents, he at leaſt evinced his goodneſs and juſtice in this expedition. After waiting at Hadington three days, till various reinforcements arrived, the army prepared to march, the trumpets ſounded, and the king's foot was in the ſtirrup to mount his horſe, when a poor butcher begged an audience. The complaint was againſt an officer of the royal houſhold, who had not paid for the meats ordered: the monarch heard the claim affably and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, and ſent for the officer: who not being found he paid the ſum himſelf. He then ordered a proclamation at the market croſs that all debts due by his attendants ſhould be inſtantly demanded and paid; and in future always obſerved this cuſtom on leaving any place; an uſeful example to his ſubjects, in an age when different ſtatutes were required to enforce a like practice in the nobles. The people upon this occaſion, remembered with pleaſure his ſimilar conduct at his coronation, when he ordered payment to the monaſtery of Scone, for the growing corn trodden under foot by the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude <note n="6" place="bottom">Bowar, 418, 419.</note>. Such matters are often eſteemed beneath the dignity of hiſtory; but far be that pride which would prevent a good action to the meaneſt of mankind, or its commemoration; and if this hiſtoric dignity be inimical to amiable views of manners, and to humanity, it is rather an object of ſcorn than of admiration.</p>
               <p>Though, in November and December, <note place="margin">1401</note> ſome conferences between the Engliſh and Scotiſh commiſſioners had been held,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0141700201:79"/>only truces of a few weeks had been adjuſted <note n="7" place="bottom">Rymer, VIII, 166, 185.</note>; and the war ſoon reſumed its depredations. Henry's demands were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant, as he had been irritated by Robert's neglect, and by being treated as an uſurper. The Engliſh monarch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed his commiſſioners to require the homage of Scotland; if refuſed, an annuity, or lands, were held out as temptations to Robert: ſhould this pretenſion prove fruitleſs, a marriage treaty beween their families was to be propoſed, or at leaſt a truce of thirty years <note n="8" place="bottom">Inſtructions Veſp. F. VII, f. 83, 85, n. 1. written, from intrinſic evidence, after Henry's return.</note>: all theſe terms were rendered nugatory by the Scotiſh alliance with France.</p>
               <p>Robert in vain demanded that March ſhould be delivered up: and that earl required the reſtitution of his eſtates with as little ſucceſs. Henry IV knew from experience the value of a traitor, and extended to March, his friends and followers, the warmeſt protection. Eager to wipe off the ſtain of his captivity, Henry Percy joined March, who was inflamed with revange, and anxious to evince his importance by his ſervices; <note place="margin">3 Feb.</note> and they entered Scotland, at the head of two thouſand choſen men. Piercing by Peebles to Linton, they aſſaulted without ſucceſs the caſtle of Hales, burned three villages, and encamped at Preſton. But the ſon of the Earl of Douglas, advancing from Edinburgh againſt them, with a body of his followers, they made a precipitate retreat, leaving their ſpoils, and tents, and prepared proviſions. The Scots purſued them a whole dreary night of that ſeaſon of the year, and captured many at Colbrand's-path, the reſt eſcaping to Berwick; at the very gates of which town the lance, and pennon, of the lord Thomas Talbot were taken <note n="9" place="bottom">Bowar, 429.</note>. The heir of Douglas a few
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0141700201:80"/>months after wore the brilliant coronet of that houſe, upon the death of his father Archibald, ſurnamed the Grim, a peer recommended to fame by his wiſdom, as much as by his here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary valour <note n="1" place="bottom">Bowar, 429.
<p>Theſe events have been dated 1400 by our hiſtorians, miſled by Bowar's inattention to the commencement of the year; but the preceding narrative, and notes, evince them to belong to 1401. Redpath, 369, ſhews little acumen in not being able to ſolve ſo ſlender a perplexity.</p>

               <p>This year forms an epoch in the hiſtory of Scotiſh legiſlation, the more important, as, after the various laws of Robert II, no further intelligence ariſes, till the luminous period com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mences with the ſtatutes of James I.</p>
               <p>The ordinances paſſed in a parliament held at Scone are <note place="margin">21 Feb.</note> numerous <note n="2" place="bottom">Theſe laws are publiſhed by Skene, in his collection known by the name of Regiam Majeſtatem, from the firſt words of a treatiſe prefixt. They were extant in the Regiſter in his time, as he mentions in his tract De Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borum Significatione; and their authenticity is unqueſtioned. See alſo MS. Harley, 4700. The date is accurately marked in that MS. and by Skene.</note>. Many concern private property, then in an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and precarious condition, under the feudal oppreſſion, and rapacity of the great: but the following chiefly deſerve hiſtorical commemoration. It was decreed that the king's lieutenant-general the Earl of Fife, and other royal miniſters, ſhould hear the cauſes of churchmen, widows, orphans, and minors, without taking ſureties, and judge without delay: that, during the papal ſchiſm, any excommunicated perſon might appeal to the conſervator of the church, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0141700201:81"/>to the general congregation of the clergy; that the duel ſhould only be permitted in four caſes, the crime muſt infer death, it muſt be ſecretly deſigned or perpetrated, the ſuſpicions muſt bear veriſimilitude, and the truth was not to be diſcovered by witneſſes or writings. Among the cauſes why gifts are revocable, are claſſed the arts of monks in perſuading the laity to donations. Uſury, or intereſt, is not to be allowed againſt a minor, who is only to pay the principal. As a check on the ſheriffs, their clerks are to be appointed by the king, and only amenable to him, to prevent any connivance in injuſtice. The juſticiary courts are to be held twice in the year, on either ſide of the Forth: the coroner is empowered to arreſt perſons indicted: the lords of regalities, ſheriffs, and barons, are to hold their journies of juſtice twice in the year, and abbreviate the terms of appearance: the king's juſticiary may remove ſheriffs, or other royal officers in caſe of default, till the fitting of the next parliament, which is to judge the cauſe; a ſingular ſtatute, confounding the legiſlative and executive powers. "To prevent the great and horrible ravages depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, fires, and homicides, which are daily committed in every part of the kingdom, it is ordained that all the ſheriffs in the realm make public proclamations, that no perſon tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling ſhall be allowed more attendants than thoſe whoſe maintenance he defrays." Ravagers, depredators, incendiaries, robbers, murderers, are to be puniſhed by death and confiſcation. The ſheriff ſhall arreſt malefactors, and take bail for their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance at the next journey of juſtice, or circuit; their nonappearance infers rebellion, and forfeiture of the bail; if no bail be found, they are at once to be tried by an aſſize, and if found guilty forfeit their lives; if they flee from one ſheriffdom to another, the firſt ſheriff is to ſend a precept to the ſecond for their deliverance to trial; a ſimilar procedure is
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0141700201:82"/>to be uſed to lords, and officers of regalities, and all lieges are to aſſiſt. Among the more minute ſtatutes, may be named, that allowing the lieges to purchaſe victuals where they pleaſe, on paying the cuſtoms; that againſt burning the heath of moors in ſummer, or autumn, when the corn might be damaged; thoſe againſt the killing of ſalmon, or hares, at prohibited ſeaſons; that which orders farmers, who rent lands for a term, not to alienate the leaſe for a term exceeding the agreement. Theſe laws, like the ruins of an ancient hall of juſtice, inſpire reverence from their priſtine majeſty, and utility; and will intereſt the philoſophic reader, as reliques of the progreſs of ſociety, and of the hiſtory of man.</p>
               <p>The effects of March's vengeance have already been nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; but a ſcene of a blacker and more deplorable kind is now to open, in the murder of the Duke of Rothſay. The power and ſenſe of the queen, the gravity of Trail biſhop of St. Andrews, a chief promoter of concord, the valour and wiſdom of the firſt Archibald Earl of Douglas, had balanced the ambition of Albany, but theſe three ſupporters of the monarchy died within a ſhort period <note n="3" place="bottom">The fourth peſtilence which had ravaged Scotland appeared in 1401; but it appears not that any of theſe great perſons fell a victim to it. Winton, 884.</note>, and the governor's paſſions had no longer any controul, ſave from Rothſay's merit, and juſt pretenſions. Archibald the ſecond Earl of Douglas of that name, born to adorn that family by his valour, but to diſgrace it by his conduct, was married to the elder daughter of Robert III, as his father had eſpouſed a daughter of the preceding king. Thus doubly connected with the royal family, he ſeems to have regarded Rothſay, who had wedded his ſiſter, not with fraternal affection, but with the malevolent eyes of a rival in ambition. Joined in ſtrict friendſhip with
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0141700201:83"/>Albany, and his ſecond ſon John afterwards Earl of Buchan; and miſled by their offers, or by a pique at Rothſay, he ſhared their deteſtable ſchemes. <note place="margin">1402</note> The young prince had been married about two years, but had no children; and perhaps hating the wife forced upon him by his uncle's avarice, he purſued his former courſes. Albany, on pretence of reſtraining his wildneſs, had ſet a band of his partiſans to watch his conduct; and now that the occaſion opened the regent gave the hint, and this band repreſented to the king that his ſon would no longer bear counſel, nor reſtraint. Indeed this impudent plan of Albany, this council of guardians appointed to watch a man of ſenſe and ſpirit, and that man the heir of royalty, was a certain mode to irritate and inflame youthful paſſions, but never could tend to moderate their influence. The decrepit and infirm monarch was, as uſual, diſtant from the public ſcene, and guided by thoſe around him; among whom was now unhappily one Ramorgny, a knight who had formerly ſuggeſted to Rothſay the aſſaſſination of Albany, but the generous nature of the prince had rejected the propoſal with horror and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. A ſucceſsful criminal may be honoured; but a crime offered, and refuſed, expoſes the character to certain hatred and contempt; and it is not matter of wonder that Ramorgny became in his turn the bitter enemy of Rothſay. At his ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, which may be conſtrued that of Albany, Robert ſent a written order to the regent, to arreſt his ſon, and confine him for a ſhort time, in order to ſubdue his ſtubborn ſpirit; forgetful of the certain diſgrace which the confinement of the heir apparent muſt entail on his reign, perhaps on the future; forgetful of the ſtain on the ſucceſſion, and danger of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent diſaffection in the ſubjects; forgetful how ſhort a path leads a prince from the priſon to the grave.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:0141700201:84"/>The royal mandate was born by Ramorgny and by another enemy of Rothſay, Sir William Lindſay, whoſe ſiſter Euphemia had alſo been affianced to the prince, and rejected <note n="4" place="bottom">Bowar, 432.</note>. From theſe circumſtances it may be perceived that the ſcheme was laid, and conducted with all the deep and dark art of conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate villainy. Albany, receiving the order with joy, reſolved on its immediate enforcement, and that the bearers ſhould be the executors. Privacy was neceſſary; and Rothſay was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigled into Fife, upon pretence that he ſhould take poſſeſſion for the king of the caſtle of St. Andrews, till the appointment of another biſhop. When the unſuſpecting prince was riding with a ſmall attendance, between Nydie and Straburn, near St. Andrews, he was ſeized, and held a priſoner in the caſtle, till the governor and his council, aſſembled at Culros, ſhould determine the place of his confinement. The tower of Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land was named; and thither Albany and Douglas, with a ſtrong band of followers, conducted the prince, ſeated on a labouring horſe, and covered with a ruſſet cloke, to defend him from the falling rain. Here under the cuſtody of John Selkirk, and John Wright, two aſſaſſins employed by Albany, the moſt cruel of deaths, <note place="margin">Eaſter 26 Mar.</note> that of famine, awaited the heir of the monarchy: and he was buried in a private manner at Lindoris, diſtant from the tombs of the Scotiſh kings, or thoſe of his family, the conſpirators not daring, by a funereal pomp, to awaken the attention and detection of the people <note n="5" place="bottom">Bowar, 431, 432. Winton, 886, writing in Fife, the earldom of Albany, and under his regency, conceals all the circumſtances, and only mentions the death and burial of David.

The tale ſeems from Boyce, f. v. 350, who adds that the prince devoured his own fingers, in famine and deſpair.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:0141700201:85"/>A great ſecurity to crimes ariſes from the good nature of honeſty, which believes their commiſſion impoſſible; and as Albany had conducted his horrible plot with great ſkill, and gave out that his nephew had unexpectedly died of a dyſentery; and for the impriſonment there was the king's poſitive man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date; it is no wonder that the nation was beguiled. To ſecure and to continue his regency, it was however proper that every doubt ſhould be cleared, <note place="margin">16 May</note> and a parliament was called and met at Edinburgh, an aſſembly which the long government of Albany had ſufficiently taught him how to chuſe, and influence. In a mock examination Albany and Douglas confeſſed the impriſonment, but imputed the death to divine providence. A remiſſion was however thought neceſſary; and was given by the infirm ſovereign in terms as ample, <note place="margin">20 May</note> as if they had murdered the heir apparent. In this pardon, which is extant, the confinement of the prince is aſcribed to the cauſe of public utility; but the immediate motives of the perpetrators are expreſsly ſaid to be concealed for a ſufficient reaſon <note n="6" place="bottom">This curious paper is preſerved in the 4to Regiſter often quoted, f. v. 12, whence it was publiſhed by Sir David Dalrymple, Remarks, p. 278.</note>. Does this ſingular declaration refer to the king's mandate, which might in the vulgar eye have appeared a conſent to the death of his ſon; or to ſome crime falſely imputed to Rothſay by the conſpirators, as for example a deſign to murder his father, or uncle? This is dark: but it is certain that folly and wickedneſs are companions, and that the means uſed by Albany to clear his character are preciſely thoſe which fully eſtabliſh his guilt.</p>
               <p>To divert the public attention, it was reſolved to continue the war with England, which had been interrupted by a short
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0141700201:86"/>truce, and ſome negotiations for peace <note n="7" place="bottom">In Veſp. F. VII, f. 118, is a letter from Douglas to Henry, dated Edybred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchellis, 1 Feb. and ſigned "Le Conte de Douglas, Seigneur de Galway et de Dunbar:" and Henry's anſwer 27 Feb. occurs f. 84. From theſe letters it appears that on the 16th May 1401, (ſee in Rymer, VIII, 190, a truce of 26th April 1401) Douglas and Northumberland had met at Camelſpath, and agreed to a truce of a year to Martinmas 1402: Douglas complains that Northumberland does not obſerve the treaty.

<p>Yet on the 20th Sept. r. 2=1401, Henry had iſſued inſtructions to demand homage of Scotland, admitting however that if there were no evidence, the claims ought to be abandoned, and a treaty of thirty years propoſed, England retaining Berwick, Roxburgh, and Jedburgh. Veſp. F. VII, f. 83.</p>
                  </note>. A fair pretext aroſe from the incurſions of March and his adherents, that earl and his ſon being penſioned by the Engliſh king, for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of a ſmall body of troops during the Scotiſh hoſtilities. By the advice and ſupport of the young earl of Douglas, then reſident at Dunbar, the chief landholders of Lothian agreed to conduct ſeparate expeditions into England, becauſe the people of the Merſe favoured the exiled earl, and did not exert their uſual inroads. The leader of the firſt incurſion was John Haliburton of Dirlton, who advanced a conſiderable way into the inimical country, carrying fire and ravage in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, and returned with ſucceſs and ſpoil. But the ſecond, conducted by Patrick Hepburn of Hales, met with a different fate; for having advanced too far into England, and remained too long, the Earl of March found time to unite the power of Northumberland with his own, and to intercept Hepburn and his followers in their return, <note place="margin">22 June</note> at Weſt-Niſbet in the Merſe, three miles ſouth of Duns. An obſtinate conflict enſued, rather favourable to the Scots, till the ſon of March arrived.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0141700201:87"/>with a freſh reinforcement, when victory declared for the Engliſh. The Scotiſh leader was ſlain, with ſeveral other gentlemen, and the flower of the youth of Lothian; many were mortally wounded; and John and Thomas Haliburtons, John and William Cockburns, Lauder of Baſs, and many others remained captives <note n="8" place="bottom">Bowar, 432, 433. The ſpot was afterwards called Slaughter Hill. Hume Dougl. I, 218. An original letter from Henry to his council, dated <hi>Hareburgh,</hi> 30 June, is extant, Veſp. F. VII, f. 18.

He adds that 12,000 Scots had ravaged the country around Carliſle, and intended another invaſion, ſo the neceſſary directions for defence muſt be iſſued. Northumberland, and his ſon, appear, from this letter, to have been high in Henry's favour.</note>.</p>
               <p>Douglas, ſtung with regret for the loſs of his brave friends and countrymen, and inflamed with rage againſt March, his particular enemy, immediately applied to Albany for a body of troops, to be added to his own power upon an expedition into England. The governor conſented, and diſpatched a conſiderable force under Murdac his eldeſt ſon; the earls of Angus and Moray alſo joined Douglas, who entered England with an army of ten thouſand men, carrying terror and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſtation to the walls of Newcaſtle. Henry IV was now engaged in the Welch war againſt Owen Glendour; but the earl of Northumberland, and his ſon the Hotſpur Percy, with the earl of March, collected a numerous array; and awaited the return of the Scots, impeded with ſpoil, near Milfield, in the northern part of Northumberland. Douglas had reached Wooler, in his return; and perceiving the enemy, ſeized a ſtrong poſt between the two armies, called Homildon hill. In this method he rivalled his predeceſſor at the battle of Otterburn, <note place="margin">14 Sept.</note> but not with like ſucceſs. The Engliſh advanced
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0141700201:88"/>to the aſſault, and Henry Percy was about to lead them up the hill, when March caught his bridle, and adviſed him to advance no further, but to pour the dreadful ſhower of Engliſh arrows into the enemy. This advice was followed with the uſual fortune; for in all ages the bow was the Engliſh inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of victory, and though the Scots, and perhaps the French, were ſuperior in the uſe of the ſpear, yet this weapon was uſeleſs after the diſtant bow had decided the combat. Robert the Great, ſenſible of this, at the battle of Banocburn ordered a prepared detachment of cavalry, to ruſh among the Engliſh archers at the commencement, totally to diſperſe them, and ſtop the deadly effuſion. But Douglas now uſed no ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution; and the conſequence was that his people, drawn up on the face of a hill, preſented one general mark to the enemy, none of whoſe arrows deſcended in vain. The Scots fell without ſight, and unrevenged, till a ſpirited knight, Swinton, exclaimed aloud, "O my brave countrymen! what faſcination has ſeized you to-day that you ſtand like deer to be ſhot, inſtead of indulging your antient courage, and meeting your enemies hand to hand? Let thoſe who will, deſcend with me, that we may gain victory, or life, or fall like men." This being heard by Adam Gordon, between whom and Swinton there exiſted an antient and deadly feud, attended with the mutual ſlaughter of many followers, he inſtantly fell on his knees before Swinton, begged his pardon; and deſired to be dubbed a knight by him whom he muſt now regard as the wiſeſt, and boldeſt of that order in Britain. The ceremony performed, Swinton and Gordon deſcended the hill, accompanied only by one hundred men; and a deſperate valour led the whole body to death. Had a ſimilar ſpirit been ſhown by the Scotiſh army, it is probable that the event of the day would have been dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent. Douglas, who was certainly deficient in the moſt
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0141700201:89"/>important qualities of a general, ſeeing his army begin to diſperſe, at length attempted to deſcend the hill; but the Engliſh archers, retiring a little, ſent a flight of arrows ſo ſharp and ſtrong that no armour could withſtand; and the Scotiſh leader himſelf, whoſe panoply was of remarkable temper, fell under five wounds, though not mortal. The Engliſh men of arms, knights of ſquires, did not ſtrike one blow, but remained ſpectators of the rout, which was now complete. Great numbers of the Scots were ſlain, and near five hundred periſhed in the river Tweed upon their flight. Among the illuſtrious captives were Douglas, whoſe chief wound deprived him of an eye; Murdac ſon of Albany; the Earls of Moray, and Angus; and about twenty four gentlemen of eminent rank and power. The chief ſlain were Swinton, Gordon, Livingſton of Calendar, Ramſay of Dalhouſie, Walter Sinclair, Roger Gordon, Walter Scot, and others.

               <p>Henry Percy diſgraced the victory by an act of cruelty. Among the captives was Sir William Stuart of Foreſt; and Percy inſiſted that he, being a native of Tividale when under
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0141700201:90"/>the Engliſh power, ſhould be regarded as a traitor. Stuart, a man of wiſdom and eloquence, defended himſelf ſo well that he was acquitted by three ſucceſſive juries; but the malice of Percy led him to appoint a new jury of his followers, and Stuart was drawn and quartered, amidſt the murmurs of the Engliſh, who knew that his merit was the only cauſe of his death <note n="1" place="bottom">Bowar, 434.

               <p>Henry IV, on receiving intelligence of the battle of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mildon, deſired the Percies not to ranſom, nor deliver, their priſoners, without his conſent: and, to palliate this apparently harſh mandate, he generouſly granted the earldom of Douglas, with Eſkdale, Lidſdale, Lauderdale, the lordſhip of Selkirk, foreſt of Ettrick, county of Tividale, and all the other appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages of that high houſe, to the Earl of Northumberland; who ſmiled at this liberal gift of a country, neither conquered, nor likely to be an object of eaſy ſeizure <note n="2" place="bottom">Rymer, VIII, 278, 289.</note>. But the Percies reſolved to take the king in his own ſnare, and to make this conqueſt the pretended object of arms, inſtantly to be turned againſt the granter. Meantime Murdac, the regent's ſon, ſometimes termed Earl of Fife, and ſome other priſoners were ſent to Henry, <note place="margin">20 Oct.</note> and were preſented in full parliament. Sir Adam Foreſter, one of theſe captives, made a ſpeech be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that great audience, which would have been wiſer if better timed, repreſenting the advantages of ſolid and durable peace between the nations; but Henry checked the oration, becauſe Foreſter had formerly deceived him, concerning

The heir of Albany was freed, upon his word of honour not to withdraw from England; the inferior priſoners were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to an eaſy confinement. The earl of March requeſted the parliament, that he might be reſtored to his lands in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as ſubdued by the Engliſh, and that ſuch of his people as choſe to obſerve allegiance to England ſhould be received; all which was willingly granted, but it was inſiſted that his people ſhould take an oath of fidelity <note n="4" place="bottom">The commons recommended him to the king.

               <p>An incident occurred, <note place="margin">1403</note> which contributes to paint the features of the times and of the government. Sir Malcom Drummond, brother of the late queen, had been married for ſome years to Iſabella, in her own right counteſs of Mar. He was ſuddenly ſurprized in his caſtle by a band of ruffians, and impriſoned till he died of his hard captivity. In the next year, a decent term having expired, Alexander Stuart, natural ſon of Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander the deceaſed earl of Buchan, brother of Albany, forced the counteſs to wed him; and as he was a noted leader of the highland freebooters there is no room to doubt that he had been the murderer of her huſband, in order to attain this wealthy marriage. Theſe unworthy deeds were ſanctioned by the government; the king's name being boldly ſet, by the regent, to a charter confirming the earldom to a lawleſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truder <note n="5" place="bottom">Winton, 888, 889.

                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:0141700201:92"/>The Earl of Northumberland, and his ſon, were now intent upon open rebellion againſt Henry IV; and to colour the raiſing of their troops, and gain time for adding freſh muſters, it was reſolved to make a ſhort incurſion into Scotland, on pretence of rendering effectual the grant of the earldom of Douglas. Accordingly Henry Percy, and the Earl of March, proceeding with a conſiderable force beſieged Coklawis, a ſtrong tower in Tividale on the confines of the Merſe <note n="6" place="bottom">Bowar, 435. It was in, or near, the ſite of the preſent Ormiſton, about three miles to the ſouth of Kelſo. In a letter to the Engliſh council, Newcaſtle 30 May, Veſp. F.

In a letter to Henry, 26 June, ib. f. 25, the earl demands money, as he had received none, though it was maliciouſly reported that 60,000<hi>l.</hi> had paſſed into his hands ſince the king's coronation: he aſſures his "Mageſtée royalle" that he ſhall be at <hi>Ormiſton</hi> on the day appointed.

Gladſtane, the proprietor of Coklawis, who had remained concealed in the place, ſoon haſtened to the king, who referred him to the governor. Albany aſſembling a council of prelates and nobles at Falkland, laid the affair before them; and they knowing him little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to war, pretended that it was better to give up that paltry turret, than encounter further danger from England, when the Scots were weakened and diſheartened by the late defeat. Upon which, to their ſurprize, the regent who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently had intelligence of the commotion raiſed by the Percies, and that the north of England was incapable either
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0141700201:93"/>of offence or defence, ſtarted up, and exclaimed, "I vow to God and St. Fillan that I ſhall prevent the appointed day, although none ſhould attend me ſave that youth, my groom," pointing to Peter de Kinbuk, then holding his horſe at a diſtance. The council, effectually duped and aſtoniſhed by the governor's new ſpirit, anſwered with tears of joy, "May God confirm his work in you; and by his aid we engage that our help ſhall not be deficient." Albany was ſoon at the head of a numerous army, conſiſting according to our antient accounts of not leſs than fifty thouſand rude cavalry, and as many infantry. With ſome loſs he took the fort of Inwerwick in Lothian <note n="7" place="bottom">The ſituation of this place is compared to Baiae, in the deſcription of Lothian, Blaeu's Atlas.</note>, which had been ſeized by the Engliſh, after the deſtruction of the flower of Lothian at Homildon; and was approaching Coklawis, when a meſſenger brought him tidings that Percy was defeated and ſlain at Shrewſbury. Upon this the governor encamped his wide battalions around Coklawis, and ordered a herald to proclaim the joyful intelligence; then diſmiſſed his army, and returned as in triumph <note n="8" place="bottom">Bowar, 435—438.

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0141700201:94"/>and avenging the affronts and the loſſes of his country. The people of Scotland were then almoſt unknown in their own government, but the patience of the nobles and gentlemen under this long and diſgraceful Regency, yet further to be lengthened and diſgraced, can only be accounted for, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring that Albany ſhared with them the ſpoils of the king and of the people, and thus indulged to the utmoſt the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſpirit of ariſtocracy.</p>

He wiſhed to include the Scots in the long truce, formerly ratified with France; but, not ſucceeding, uſed other pacific negotiations, and Robert III on his ſide appointed commiſſioners to treat for the ranſom of Albany's ſon, <note place="margin">May</note> and Douglas, and for a truce if obtainable upon proper terms; which was in fact concluded for a very ſhort time <note n="2" place="bottom">Rymer, VIII, 345, 359, 363.</note>. <note place="margin">6 July to Eaſter.</note> Another meeting was agreed on to confer concerning a definitive treaty, and among the Scotiſh commiſſioners were James Douglas lord of Dalkeith, the biſhop of Glaſgow, Sir David Fleming, John Merton doctor of canon law, and Walter Foreſter canon of Aberdeen and ſecretary of ſtate <note n="3" place="bottom">Ib. 369, 370.

                  </note>, the victim of his own weakneſs, and of his brother's ſavage ambition, had yet a few friends left. Among theſe was Henry Wardlaw, nephew of the late cardinal, and recently appointed biſhop of St. Andrews by the Pope, a prelate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by his love of letters, and of his king, and country. To his charge James, Earl of Carric, and only ſurviving ſon of Robert III, now in his eleventh year, was committed by
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0141700201:96"/>his father, and by his advice France was choſen as a ſecure retreat for the heir of the kingdom, from the brutal force or dark art of Albany <note n="7" place="bottom">Bowar, 439.</note>. The poliſhed education to be received in that celebrated country afforded a fair pretence for this plan; and the regent ſeems not to have oppoſed it, hoping perhaps ſomewhat from accident, divining the unpopularity of a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign education, nor regreting to unite the public attention by being the neareſt heir of the monarchy left in Scotland. Henry Sinclair earl of Orkney was appointed chief attendant of the prince in this voyage: and a ſhip was ordered to the iſle of Baſs, in the firth of Forth, to receive the important charge. David Fleming of Cumbernald, a relation of the king, and ſeveral chief gentlemen of Lothian, conducted the prince, and ſaw him ſafe on board: on their return they were purſued by James Douglas, uncle of the earl, and a conflict followed at Hermanſton moor, <note place="margin">14 Feb.</note> in which Fleming and many others fell <note n="8" place="bottom">Bowar, 439. Winton, 895.—Walſingham, 416, 417, informs us that Fleming was ſlain in revenge for his advice to Northumberland to eſcape into Wales, as the Scotiſh nobles intended to have delivered him up in exchange for one or two of the peers captured at Homildon. If ſo this event muſt have happened in 1406. The groſs errors of chronology in Bowar, Winton, and even our later hiſtorians, occaſion perpetual difficulties. That Robert III died on the 4th of April 1406, is evinced beyond all doubt by the learned Ruddiman, in his notes on Buchanan, p. 436; who at the ſame time expreſſes his opinion that the prince was captured in 1405, as Bowar's inconſiſtent account bears that the capture happened on the 30th March, and that the father died of grief on the 28th March; while Winton expreſsly dates theſe events in the years 1405 and 1406. It is clear from our hiſtorians, and Walſingham, that the earl of Orkney accompanied the prince; and he was a captive in England in Aug. 1405, when his brothers were permitted to viſit England, as may be inferred from Rymer, VIII, 410; on the 13th Sept. 1405, a ſafe conduct was granted to Orkney, then a priſoner, to viſit Scotland, (his brothers apparently hoſtages,) Rymer, VIII, 415. Yet it is ſingular that no mention of the prince occurs in any writing of that year. John ſon of Henry ſays, in a letter to his father, Veſp. F. VII, f 95, n. 2, that Orkney had joined Northumberland and Bardolf at Berwick: the letter is dated Durham, 9 June, in all appearance 1405. Yet Bowar and Winton agree that Orkney and the prince were captured in March or April. The ſame writers concur that Fleming was ſlain, on his return from accompanying the prince on ſhip-board: yet Walſingham ſeems rightly to place the ſlaughter in 1406: he is however miſtaken in dating the capture 1406, as appears from the paſſports to Orkney. When the materials are ſo complex, and diſcordant, the candour of the reader muſt be requeſted.</note>.</p>

               <p>The Scots availed themſelves of the confuſion, to manifeſt their ſenſe of Henry's injuſtice.

It is ſuſpected that it was on this occaſion that a ſpirited letter was written by James Douglas, ſecond ſon of the earl, (Bowar, 439,) to the Engliſh king, who complained that the followers of that nobleman had, in the time of truce, burned Berwick, and ſome places in England. Douglas anſwers that the Engliſh had killed many Scots, and taken ſome Scotiſh ſhips; that they had ravaged Arran, and the caſtle of Brathwicke, Lauderdale, Tividale, and a part of Ettrick foreſt.

               <p>THE character of Robert Duke of Albany requires but a few features, to finiſh the delineation, which has already preſented itſelf in his actions. He approached his ſeventieth year, when, by various arts and crimes, he attained the great object of his purſuits, in the ſole government of Scotland. His perſon was tall, and majeſtic, his countenance amiable: temperance, affability, eloquence, real generoſity, apparent benignity, a degree of cool prudence bordering upon wiſdom, may be reckoned among his virtues. But the ſhades of his vices are deeper; an inſatiate ambition, unrelenting cruelty, and its attendant cowardice, or at leaſt an abſolute defect of military fame, a contempt of the beſt human affections, a long practice in all the dark paths of art and diſſimulation.

Henry's letter to John, his ſon, concerning the prolongation of the truce for a year, occurs Veſp. F. VII, f. 106, n. 2. Albany's letter appears, f. 111, dated 2 March, and ſtates that the Scotiſh embaſſadors, Sir William Grame, and Sir John Stuart, having been well received, the regent had called a parliament to conſider Henry's anſwer; and the truce was prolonged from next eaſter to that in the enſuing year.

<p>It is doubtful what is the real date of the following events, narrated by Monſtrelet, Tome I, c. 35, edit. 1518, under the year 1407. The prince of Wales, ſays that writer, accompanied by his uncles, and an army of 1000 men at arms, and 6000 archers, (about 12,000 in all) proceeded about <hi>Tous ſaints</hi> (1 Nov.) to make war in Scotland. The <hi>king</hi> of Scotland then at <hi>St. Janjon,</hi> (St. Johnſtown, Perth,) in the middle of his kingdom, aſſembled a large army under <hi>Douglas</hi> and Buchan; but he found the Engliſh too powerful, and ſent embaſſadors to conclude a truce of one year.

                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:0141700201:103"/>The Earl of March diſappointed in his hopes of the conqueſt and grant of his eſtates, <note place="margin">1408</note> by the Engliſh monarch, was not indiſpoſed to return to his own country; and the regent and the nobles of Scotland knew, from experience, that his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and his friendſhip, were not unimportant. A new government having taken place, Albany could now throw the blame of the injuries offered to this nobleman upon the late king; and an accommodation was effected. From the liberality of Henry IV March had acquired ſome eſtates in England, which ſerved to indemnify his loſs; and Douglas reſtored his Scotiſh domains, upon condition however of retaining the lordſhip of Annandale, and its caſtle of Lochmaben <note n="6" place="bottom">Bowar, 444.</note>.</p>
               <p>A ſcene, it is believed, before unknown in Scotland diſgraces the annals of this year. James Reſby, an Engliſh prieſt of the ſchool of Wickliffe, was condemned for hereſy by a clerical council, preſided by Lawrence Lindoris, an inquiſitor; and delivered to the ſecular arm, and to the flames, at Perth.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0141700201:104"/>The articles of his hereſy amounted to about forty; and the firſt and chief was that the Pope is not the vicar of Chriſt <note n="7" place="bottom">Bowar, 441—443.</note>. Winton particularly praiſes Albany for his averſion to Lollards, and to hereſy, and for his devotion to the catholic church: and from this incident the reputation appears to have been well founded. But it did little honour to his government to inſtitute the firſt example to his country of fanatic cruelty, though much of the blame muſt reſt upon prieſtly perſecution, upon the examples of other countries and, the ſpirit of the times. The ſacred light of philoſophy, which eſtabliſhes ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute right of conſcience, and unlimited ſcope of opinion, was yet far from its dawn; and the barbariſm of the age thought to honour religion by crime, and the Deity by the deſtruction of man.</p>
               <p>The truces, <note place="margin">1409</note> which had extended from the commencement of the regency to this time, having expired without renewal, ſome of the commons of Tividale, a people hardened by their limitory ſituation, and conſtant expoſure to war, aſſaulted and took the caſtle of Jedburgh, which had remained in the hands of the Engliſh ſince the battle of Durham <note n="8" place="bottom">Bowar, 444. Beſides Berwick and Roxburgh, Faſtcaſtle was alſo in the hands of the Engliſh, as appears from different letters. Veſp. F. VII, p. 97, &amp;c.</note>. The walls were ſo hardly cemented together, that much labour was required to deſtroy them, as was reſolved, in order to prevent the foe from regaining ſo firm a hold: and it was agitated in a parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, held at Perth, that a tax of two pennies upon every hearth ſhould be raiſed for this purpoſe. But the regent, anxious for popularity, oppoſed this reſolution, ſaying that during his regency no tax had ever been levied, nor ſhould he now begin to merit by that abuſe the malediction of the poor: and he accordingly ordered the expence to be defrayed out of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0141700201:105"/>the royal cuſtoms <note n="9" place="bottom">Bowar, 444.</note>. One of the inconſiſtencies of human affairs is, that a power irregularly or criminally acquired is often exerted in a manner far more excellent, than the juſt tenor of authority; for the latter reſts upon an indiſpenſable claim, while the former requires ſupport from the affections of the people.</p>
               <p>To revenge the loſs of Jedburgh, <note place="margin">1410</note> Robert Umfraville, of the Engliſh family which claimed the title of Angus, entered the Forth with ten ſhips, and took fourteen veſſels laden with drapery and grain: and afterwards ravaged various parts of the Scotiſh coaſt. The ſupply of corn which he brought on his return, was ſo ſeaſonable to England, then afflicted with a ſcarcity, that he was honoured with the vulgar appellation of Robert Mendmarket <note n="1" place="bottom">Harding, c. 207.</note>. But it is uncertain whether the corn captured in the Forth was an import into, or an export from Scotland. Nor were the Scots deficient in ſucceſſful hoſtility, for Patrick Dunbar, the ſon of March, took by ſtratagem the fortreſs of Faſtcaſtle, on the northern ſhore of the Merſe, which had been for a ſhort time in the Engliſh power <note n="2" place="bottom">Bowar, 444.</note>.</p>
               <p>Although Henry IV was irritated by the loſs of Jedburgh, and meditated a blow againſt the regent, yet to cover his deſigns he permitted a propoſed truce to proceed ſo far, as to require Albany's ratification <note n="3" place="bottom">The truce itſelf may be ſeen in Veſp. F. VII, f. 95, n. 1. It is in Engliſh, and extends from 21 May next to 21 May 1411: is dated at Reewele 27 Jan. 1409-10: the commiſſioners are Borwick and Cairns for Scotland, Sir Richard Redmain and Mr. Holme for England. On the 21 Jan. 1410, Henry gave inſtructions to Emond Bugge, ſquire of the chamber, as envoy to Albany, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting on the return of Douglas to England, offering Murdac of Fife for a ranſom of 50,000 marks, or if a long peace were granted his free deliverance. Albany herald, had moved the marriage of prince John of Lancaſter with the regent's daughter; but his inſtructions were doubted, and if right Henry will deliberate on the buſineſs. Veſp. F. VII, f. 90.</note>. This was conveyed in a letter to Henry,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0141700201:106"/>ſome expreſſions of which were eſteemed rather preſumptuous; for the regent was ſtyled "by the grace of God," and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned "our ſubjects of Scotland <note n="4" place="bottom">Rymer, VIII, 635.</note>." As Henry's title to his crown was not ſo good as Albany's to the Scotiſh, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſimilarity occurs in the progreſs of their ambition, it is no wonder that ſuch expreſſions ſeemed to imply pride, or reproach.</p>
               <p>But the moſt important event during this regency now ariſes in the rebellion, <note place="margin">1411</note> as it was termed, of the lord of the Iſles. The ſubject of diſpute was the earldom of Roſs, a title of uncertain creation, but which at leaſt aſcends to the twelfth century. The ancient line failed in Euphemia Roſs, wedded to Walter Leſley, whoſe iſſue were Alexander Earl of Roſs, and a daughter eſpouſed to Donald lord of the Iſles: Euphemia, upon Leſley's death, married Alexander Earl of Buchan, ſon of Robert II. Alexander Earl of Roſs had by his wife, a daughter of Albany, an only child alſo named Euphemia, who became a nun, probably by the inſtigation of her mother's family, and with the intention of reſigning the dignity to John Earl of Buchan, ſecond ſon of the regent, when ſhe came of age; but the reſignation was not executed till four years after this period <note n="5" place="bottom">Sir D. Dalrymple, Sutherland Caſe, ch. v, ſect. 7, from many records there quoted.</note>. As Euphemia by entering into a nunnery was regarded as dead in law, Donald lord of the Iſles reſolved to defeat the machinations of the family of Albany, by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſeizure of the earldom, which included the iſland of Sky, and lay contiguous to his dominions. Not contented with this acquiſition, to ſhew his ſcorn of the regent, and recommend his alliance to the Engliſh king, Donald raiſed an army of ten thouſand men of the Hebudes, and of Roſs, and advanced as far as Mar in his deſolating inroad, intending to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0141700201:107"/>ſack Aberdeen, and ravage the country even down to the Tay <note n="6" place="bottom">Bowar, 444.</note>.</p>
               <p>To ſtop his deſtructive career, Alexander Stuart Earl of Mar, and Ogilby ſheriff of Angus, haſtily collected ſome troops from Buchan, Mar, Garioch, Angus, and Merns; and met the invader at Harlaw, <note place="margin">24 July</note> about ten miles northweſt of Aberdeen. Mar's army was inferior in number; and the battle was obſtinate and fierce, but indeciſive. On the ſide of Donald the chiefs of Maclean and Macintoſh fell, with about nine hundred; and Mar loſt five hundred men, among whom were ſome of rank, as Scrymger conſtable of Dundee, George Ogilby heir of the family, and moſt of the gentlemen of Buchan <note n="7" place="bottom">Ibid. 445. Contemporary poem The battle of Harlaw. Mar appears to have married the heireſs of Doffle in Brabant, and returned to Scotland, in 1409. He lived till 1436. Stewart's Gen. 135.</note>. The lord of the Iſles was however ſo much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, that he was forced to retire; and the regent immediately collecting an army marched to the caſtle of Dingwall in Roſs, which he took and garriſoned toward the end of autumn. Next ſummer Albany ſet three armies on foot to invade Donald's territories, who was obliged to abandon his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to Roſs, to make a perſonal ſubmiſſion, and give oaths and hoſtages for indemnification, and future obſervance of peace <note n="8" place="bottom">Bowar, 445.</note>. As the intereſts of the regent were concerned, the motives of his conduct deſerve no applauſe; but the conduct itſelf was in this inſtance ſpirited and political, for it might have proved dangerous to have permitted a large and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous acceſſion of territory to an independent chief, the ally of England.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:0141700201:108"/>Meantime it appears not that Henry IV made any exertion to aſſiſt his ally, a greater field having opened to his ambition in the affairs of France, the long diſſenſions of which kingdom had now ripened into civil war. Henry prepared the future conqueſts of his ſon by engaging in the party of Burgundy, to whom he this year ſent a ſupply of troops: and it became an object of his prudence to prevent any diſturbance of his deſigns, by terminating hoſtilities with Scotland. The publication of a remarkable papal bull, given by Urban V in 1368, but not openly current till now, alſo contributed to this end <note n="9" place="bottom">Abercr. II, 240.</note>. In this pontifical mandate it is forbidden, under pain of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication and interdiction, to all perſons eccleſiaſtical or ſecular, of whatever rank, to form any leagues againſt the government of Scotland, or to enter that kingdom hoſtilely, or make any depredations in it, or even to protect or aſſiſt any who ſhall infringe this prohibition. To the terrors of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication other penalties are added; and infamy, degradation, incapacity of any places of honour or truſt, are held out to the violators; and, if kings, their ſubjects are abſolved from their allegiance. This laſt threat may have had ſome influence with Henry, whoſe title little required any additional ſhock. Urban V was a Frenchman, and warm in the intereſts of his country, ſtruggling at the period of this bull with Edward III: the origin of this fulmination is therefore eaſily explained; and it appears to have lain dormant at firſt from a diſcovery of the friendly diſpoſitions of David II towards England; and, afterwards neglected and forgotten, to have been revived by accident at the preſent epoch.</p>
               <p>Various negotiations for a truce between England and Scotland occupied this, and the following year, and occaſioned
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0141700201:109"/>a ſuſpenſion of arms. Nevertheleſs Douglas of Drumlanrig, and Gawin Dunbar, broke down the bridge of Roxburgh, and ſet fire to the town <note n="1" place="bottom">Bowar, 447.</note>. But neither this inſult, nor the loſs of Jedburgh, could divert the Engliſh king from his attention to France; and the Earl of Douglas, finding no employment for his martial ſpirit in his own country, reſolved to bear a part in the French deeds of arms. Thrice, ſays a monaſtic hiſtorian, he was repelled by contrary winds, till by the advice of the Earl of Orkney his companion in the voyage, he viſited the iſle of St. Colm in the firth of Forth, and addreſſed his ſupplications to the tutelary Saint, Columba. Then he ſailed to Flanders, and by the Saint's aſſiſtance ſoon returned <note n="2" place="bottom">Ibid. The period of Orkney's deliverance from his Engliſh captivity was perhaps 1405. See Rymer, VIII, 415, 429.</note>. Douglas muſt have found it impracticable to take a decided ſhare in the war, for the alliance of England ſhifted from one party to the other; nay the French king himſelf was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decided.</p>
               <p>To Henry Wardlaw, biſhop of St. Andrews, <note place="margin">1412</note> Scotland now became indebted for her firſt univerſity, an event more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting and important than dubious negotiations, or the tumults of war. It is pleaſing to conſider the dawn of the light of learning, riſing as after a tempeſtuous night of diſcord and barbariſm, and commencing its ſalutary influence. The ſtudies of the time were indeed unimportant, the thorny tract of ſcholaſtic theology, the clerical uſurpations of canon law, a logic which taught not to reaſon, a philoſophy devoid of wiſdom: but ſtill the mind was employed, a ſacrifice, though rude, was offered to ſcience, the field began to be manured, which in time was to yield productions of delight and of utility. At Pentecoſt 1410 the lectures at St. Andrews had begun,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0141700201:110"/>but the bulls of confirmation were not received till this year, <note place="margin">3 Feb.</note> when Henry Ogilby maſter of arts, who had been deputed on that ſervice, arrived with the papal conſent. Univerſal feſtivity enlivened the city, the bulls were preſented to the biſhop who appeared in ſtate in the refectory, were ſolemnly peruſed aloud, and <hi>Te Deum</hi> ſung, and the elevation of joy and of wine pervaded every ſtreet. On a following day a grand proceſſion was inſtituted, in which were ſeen not leſs than four hundred clergy <note n="3" place="bottom">Bowar, 445. The original charter of the biſhop is rehearſed in Scotſt. Cal. under the reign of James II. A deed of this prelate, 18th April 1414, occurs in MS. Harl. 4637, Vol. III, f. 188.</note>.</p>
               <p>The death of Henry IV, <note place="margin">1413 March</note> and the ſucceſſion of his warlike ſon to the Engliſh ſceptre, introduced little alteration into the affairs of Scotland. One of the firſt acts of Henry V was to order the ſon of Albany, whom policy had ſtill retained captive in England, and ſome other priſoners to the tower; leſt they might have taken an advantage, of which there did not want examples, in eſcaping upon a pretence, believed in that age to be juſt, that their promiſes of honour were only engaged to the late king, and became vacated by his death <note n="4" place="bottom">Rymer, IX, 2. Accordingly the truce of May 1412, which was to laſt till Eaſter 1418, (Rymer, VIII, 737,) was regarded as annulled.</note>. Reſolving to take advantage of the diſtracted ſtate of France, he had effectual means in his hands to ſecure the neutrality of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, by continuing the captivity of James, and of Albany's eldeſt ſon; and to ſhew his amicable intentions he diſmiſſed ſome Scotiſh captives of inferior note <note n="5" place="bottom">Rymer, IX, 5.</note>. The Scots were afterwards amuſed with three unſucceſsful negotiations, in the ſame year, between their regent and the Engliſh king, for the ranſom of James. Albany ſent a more ſerious embaſſy
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0141700201:111"/>for the ranſom of Murdac his ſon; but this deſign alſo failed and only a truce was agreed on, to laſt till June 1414: at which time it was continued by further negotiation <note n="6" place="bottom">Rymer, IX, 5, 40, 79, 48, 45, 60. In May 1414 Albany ſent Maxwell of Calderwood, and Mr. Robert Lanyn, to Henry to negotiate the ranſom of Murdac and James. Veſp. F. VII, f. 114, n. 1, 2: f. 115, n. 1. The letters are dated at length, "26 Maii 1414, et gubernationis noſtrae 9:" an additional proof that Robert III died in April 1406. The deſignation of James is ſingular, "Jacobi filii quondam Domini mei regis."
<p>Bowar, 447, mentions the aſſaſſination of Patrick Graham Earl of Strathern, by Sir John Drummond, who died before the puniſhment of his crime. Graham was earl in right of his wife Euphemia Stuart; and their ſon Malis Graham was ſtripped of the title, and eſtate by James I: a raſh act which excited a Graham to his aſſaſſination.

               <p>While Henry V was occupied with his victorious expedition into France, <note place="margin">1415</note> the Earl of Douglas took and burned Penrith; and in revenge Dumfries met with a ſimilar fate <note n="7" place="bottom">Bowar, 448.</note>. The want of an Earl of Northumberland now began to be felt; and it was reſolved by the Engliſh government to accompliſh a treaty, commenced in the preceding year, for the exchange of the regent's ſon and the young Earl of Northumberland, ſon of Hotſpur, who had been left in Scotland by his grandfather, when he retired into Wales. That he was detained as a captive, after the ſeizure of the Scotiſh prince, can hardly be imputed to injuſtice; but he was liberally educated at St. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews by the biſhop, and met with ſuch honourable hoſpitality that grateful impreſſions alone filled his mind. Before Henry proceeded to France this exchange had been determined; but was poſtponed on account of the ungenerous flight of Murdac, who was however taken, and the captor liberally rewarded <note n="8" place="bottom">Rymer, IX, 280.</note>. The anxiety of the regent, now far advanced in years, for the preſence of his heir, and the wiſhes of the Engliſh for the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0141700201:112"/>protection of another Earl of Northumberland, at laſt conſpired together: and the exchange was carried into effect <note n="9" place="bottom">Rymer, IX, 323. In the invaluable collection of papers, Veſp. F. VII, f. 108, n. 1, is a warrant for removing Murdac to Warkworth, dated 22 May, regni 3—1415: inſtructions alſo occur, f. 110, dated at May, r. 3, agreeing to the exchange, provided that Percy aſſent to fulfill what Robert Umfraville and John Witherington, eſquires, have promiſed to Henry in his name. Henry Percy being at length brought to Berwick, final orders were iſſued on the 10th Dec. Ib. f. 109.</note>.</p>
               <p>A freſh treaty for the ranſom of James proceeded ſo far, <note place="margin">1416</note> that Henry conſented that the Scotiſh king, now of age, ſhould viſit Scotland, on condition of returning within a limited time, under the penalty of one hundred thouſand marks, giving hoſtages for ſecurity <note n="1" place="bottom">Rymer, IX, 417.</note>. But ſome pretext was found by the regent for breaking off this negotiation; and he at the ſame time entered into a correſpondence with the duke of Orleans, now a priſoner in England <note n="2" place="bottom">Guthrie, who generally copies Abercromby, Maitland, and Granger, has occaſionally new intelligence, but careleſsly omits to point out his authorities. He mentions this correſpondence, Vol. III, p. 248, as conducted by means of Henry Talbot, and betrayed by a domeſtic of Orleans who was a ſpy in Henry's pay. In Veſp. F. III, f. 5, is an autograph letter of Henry V, recommending attention to this intercourſe of Orleans and Albany.</note>.</p>
               <p>While Henry V had entered upon his ſecond expedition againſt France, <note place="margin">1417</note> and was engaged in the conqueſt of Normandy, Albany collected a large army, and dividing it into two parts, appointed the one under Douglas to inveſt Roxburgh, while he himſelf with the other beſieged Berwick. But the dukes of Bedford and Exeter, gathering an array of more than one hundred thouſand men, if we believe an Engliſh hiſtorian, and of which Exeter boaſted that forty thouſand were equal to the choſen ſoldiers under Henry in France, the Scots were
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0141700201:113"/>forced to retire <note n="3" place="bottom">Bowar, 449, mentions this attempt, called the <hi>Foul raid</hi> or dirty expedition, with due ſcorn. Walſingham Y pod. 197, aſcribes this enterprize to the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of Oldcaſtle and the Lolards, who wiſhed to reſtore the pretended Richard to the throne: a ridiculous imputation, ariſing from malignity againſt the Lolards. Orleans ſeems to have been the inſtigator. The bombaſtic narrative of Thomas of Elmham, p. 162, may excite a ſmile. In Veſp. F. VII, f. 115, n. 2, is a letter of Henry, dated at Southampton, mentioning that Albany means to attack Berwick by ſea and land, about the 23d of Auguſt, and that cannon and other warlike ſtores were ſhipped in Scotland for that purpoſe. Albany's army is computed at 60,000. See alſo Rymer IX, 307, dated 1415.</note>. Albany ſeems to have had crude intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and to have thought that the force of England was in France, while Henry had in fact only a ſmall but a ſelect army. The people of Scotland not ſuſpecting the numbers of the foe, and only ſeeing the ineffectual expedition, treated this attempt of Albany with great deriſion.</p>
               <p>The Council of Conſtance having ſet a laudable example in the depoſition of Benedict XIII, and in aſſerting the ſuperiority of councils over the popes, after ſecuring the conſent of the other catholic kingdoms, at laſt ſent an envoy to Scotland for that purpoſe. A parliament being ſummoned to Perth, the Abbot of Pontiniac produced letters from the Council, and from the Emperor Sigiſmund, and the caſe was examined. Benedict applied to the Regent, who rather favoured his cauſe, and appointed Robert Harding an Engliſhman to defend it, who was ſo unfortunate as to fall into heretical propoſitions in the attempt; and the Univerſity of St. Andrews, and moſt of the clergy, ſupporting Martin V the new pope choſen by the Council, it was reſolved that Scotland ſhould follow the example of the other catholic ſtates <note n="4" place="bottom">Bowar, 449—451.</note>.</p>
               <p>The fortreſs of Work was taken by William Halyburton of Faſtcaſtle, <note place="margin">1419</note> but ſome Engliſh troops arriving under Robert Ogle,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0141700201:114"/>he deceived Halyburton in propoſing a compenſation for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance of the caſtle, while his men ſecretly ſcaled the walls, and overpowering the Scots flew Halyburton, and his twenty three followers <note n="5" place="bottom">Bowar, 458, after a long, but curious, digreſſion concerning the hiſtory of Wales at this period.</note>.</p>
               <p>Henry V had now reduced all the northern parts of France; and the Dauphin was left almoſt deſtitute of friends or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources. In this neceſſity he ſent an embaſſy to the Scotiſh regent, requiring aſſiſtance in conformity with long exiſting treaties; and a parliament being held it was reſolved to comply with the Dauphin's demand. In conſequence Albany ſent his ſecond ſon, John Stuart Earl of Buchan, with a choſen army of ſeven thouſand men, among whom were ſome nobles, and many knights and eſquires; and upon their arrival in France the Dauphin immediately united them with his little army, then about to attempt the reduction of Languedoc <note n="6" place="bottom">Bowar, 459. The hiſtory aſcribed to Alain Chartier, Paris 1617, 4to, but really written by Berry, (ſee hiſt. de Jean Chartier, Paris 1661, folio) mentions, p. 49, the Scots as juſt arrived in France in 1419. Des Urſins, p. 358, ſays that two Scotiſh knights, "Thomas Quelſatry, et Guillaume de Glas," came to aſſiſt the Dauphin in 1418: and p. 388, he eſtimates the Scots who arrived under Buchan and Wigton at only 4000, or 5000.</note>.</p>
               <p>Robert Duke of Albany after having ruled Scotland for about thirty-four years, including his former management under his father and brother, <note place="margin">3 Sept.</note> died at the caſtle of Stirling, in the thirteenth year of his ſole regency, after a life of upwards of eighty years. To his high office his ſon Murdac ſucceeded; a man of a very different character, indolent and remiſs even to weakneſs, and not capable of paternal, far leſs of princely authority <note n="7" place="bottom">Bowar, 466, 467.</note>. But the circumſtances of the times maintained him in his difficult
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0141700201:115"/>ſtation for four years, at the end of which James aſſumed the ſceptre of his fathers.</p>
               <p>Few incidents worth notice ariſe during the ſhort regency of Murdac, except the tranſactions of the Scots in France, a new ſcene, but which more properly belongs to the French hiſtory. However at the end of this book a brief account ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited of theſe deeds of arms, which reflected no ſmall credit upon Scotiſh valour.</p>
               <p>The Earl of Douglas, <note place="margin">1420</note> entering England with a conſiderable force, took the town of Alnwick, and burned it to the ground <note n="8" place="bottom">Bowar, 460.</note>. In the next year Henry V proceeded to York, and invited Douglas to a conference, in which he found means to engage the earl to ſerve him with two hundred horſe, and as many infantry, upon Henry's allowing him the yearly ſum of two hundred pounds <note n="9" place="bottom">Rymer, X, 123, 30 May 1421.</note>. The motives of Douglas to this ſingular and treaſonable treaty are not ſufficiently apparent, but it ſeems that the weakneſs of the Scotiſh government concurred with the Engliſh gold to inſtigate this irregular conduct.</p>
               <p>To add to the domeſtic calamities of Scotland under the feeble regency of Murdac, that country was afflicted with a new and wide malady, proceeding from irregular ſeaſons. This was a contagious fever and dyſentery, in which many of all ranks periſhed. Among the perſons of note were Henry Sinclair earl of Orkney, James Douglas lord of Dalkeith; and George Dunbar earl of March, a nobleman moſt fortunate in war, the ſide upon which he ſtood being always victorious, as in the battles of Otterburn, Niſbet, Homildon, Shrewſbury, Benrig, and other leſs important conflicts <note n="1" place="bottom">Bowar, 460, who adds that the diſeaſe was called the <hi>Quhew.</hi>

               <p>In order to induce the Scots to withdraw from France, <note place="margin">1421</note> by bringing them into the hateful predicament of ſighting againſt
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0141700201:116"/>their own king, Henry V determined to have the company of James into France; and, to induce him to compliance, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged that he ſhould be permitted, three months after their return, to paſs to Scotland for a time, upon giving a number of Scotiſh nobles as hoſtages <note n="2" place="bottom">Rymer, X, 125. This inſtrument follows the engagement with Douglas, and bears to have been mediated by that earl, who may perhaps be vindicated on the ſuppoſition that he only intended to follow the fate of his ſovereign.
<p>In 1420 James was a gueſt at the coronation feſtival of Catherine of France, minutely deſcribed by Fabian, II, 176, 177.</p>
                  </note>. But Henry never returned; and his death in the ſucceeding year opened a ſurer proſpect to James of his deliverance from a lengthened captivity. <note place="margin">1422 31 Aug.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke of Bedford being appointed Protector of England, juſtly conſidered it as a ſuperior policy to form an alliance with the Scotiſh king, and deliver him upon ranſom. James was accordingly permitted to ſend for commiſſioners from Scotland, to confer at Pomfret with thoſe of England, <note place="margin">1423 6 July</note> whoſe inſtructions were ſufficiently moderate. They were to demand forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds, as a recompence for the maintenance of James while he reſided in England, the name of ranſom being unjuſt and invidious for a prince not taken in war, nor by his tender age capable of arms: they were to take hoſtages for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in proportions of two thouſand pounds a year: to offer perpetual peace, or, if rejected, a long truce: to obtain an agreement that no more Scots ſhould proceed to France, and that thoſe already there be recalled: artfully to induce the Scots to demand an Engliſh lady in marriage for the king: and laſtly to proceed upon compenſation of damages if de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <note n="3" place="bottom">Rymer, X, 294. The propoſal of marriage was to originate with the Scots, "cum mulieres regni Angliae, ſaltem nobiles, non ſoleant ultro virorum connubiis ſe offerre."</note>. The Scotiſh commiſſioners probably returned to ſubmit the terms to their government, and to procure ample
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0141700201:117"/>inſtructions; <note place="margin">10 Sept.</note> for the final agreement was ſettled at York, and after a delay of two months <note n="4" place="bottom">Rymer, X, 299. Murdac's commiſſion is dated 19 Aug. 1423, gub. 3. ib. 298, whence a doubt may ariſe that he was not recognized regent till 1420.</note>.</p>
               <p>Murdac the regent had ſufficiently learned from experience the oppreſſive weight, and mortifications, of power, when not ſupported by abilities <note n="5" place="bottom">To ſtrengthen his authority Murdac procured bonds of ſervice from ſome of the nobility. That of Mar, dated 20 Nov. 1420, is among Sir James Balfour's papers, MS. Harl. 4694, fol. 22. Mar becomes "man of ſpalen, duelling, and revenew," to Murdac, excepting allegiance to the king: and Murdac grants him part of the profits of juſticiary, of Aberdeen, Bamf, and Inverneſs; and his natural ſon Thomas is confirmed in the reverſion of Mar and Garioch. After ſome other clauſes, half the rents of Badenoch, Urquhart, and Strathoun, are alſo aſſigned to Mar. On ſuch foundations ſtood the power of the regents.</note>. His own ſons, inſtead of being awed by the important office of their father, ſeemed to ſhare his dignity for the ſake of licence, and to regard his authority as a protection for their vices. There is a tradition, the ſimplicity of which ſeems to ſpeak its truth, that the regent had a favorite falcon, which his ſon Walter had often requeſted unſucceſsfully, and at laſt, vexed with repeated refuſal, he tore it from his father's hand, and twiſted its neck: upon which Murdac mildly exclaimed, "Since you pay me ſo little reſpect, I muſt invite him whom both muſt obey <note n="6" place="bottom">Boyce, f. v. 358. In Oct. 1423 Murdac ſwore to the obſervance of the alliance with France. Du Tillet, f. 136.</note>."</p>
               <p>But whether the regent's conſent proceeded from his wiſhes, or from his weakneſs, and want of influence and ability to withſtand the national deſire, it is certain that the Scotiſh commiſſioners acted with ſincerity. The concluſive treaty only bears that forty thouſand pounds ſhould be paid for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of James, within ſix years, by half-yearly payments: that hoſtages ſhould be given: and that the Scotiſh regent
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0141700201:118"/>ſhould ſend embaſſadors, empowered to cloſe the marriage of James with an Engliſh lady of rank. The laſt clauſe muſt refer to the conſent of parliament, neceſſary to effect the eſpouſal and adjuſt the dower. And a ſpace of time being required to accompliſh theſe affairs, the month of March, in the approaching year, was fixed for the final arrangement. The Scotiſh commiſſioners afterwards proceeded to London, and came under ſolemn engagements to fulfil the agreement, and among other articles undertook to procure four obligations from the burghs of Edinburgh, Perth, Dundee, and Aberdeen, for the whole money to be paid <note n="7" place="bottom">Rymer, X, 299, 302. Henry V only allowed 700 <hi>l.</hi> a year for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of James. Pat. Rolls, 2 H 5, part 3 m.</note>.</p>
               <p>James ſoon after eſpouſed an Engliſh lady who had long attracted his affections. <note place="margin">1424 Feb.</note> This was Joanna daughter of the ducheſs of Clarence, niece of Richard II, by her firſt huſband John Duke of Somerſet, fourth ſon of John of Ghent, Duke of Lancaſter, and grandſon of Edward III. The ceremony was performed at the church of St. Mary Overy in Southwark; and next day the Scotiſh king received, as the portion of his queen, a diſcharge of ten thouſand pounds out of the ſum to be paid to England <note n="8" place="bottom">Rymer, X, 322. Leland Collect. III, 10, Bowar, 474. Caxton's Higden, 1482, f. 412.</note>. The hoſtages came to Durham at the appointed time; and James began his long expected journey to his own kingdom. Upon his arrival at Durham, a ſecondary ſet of hoſtages were named, out of which, in caſe of death, any of the former might be ſupplied; and a rental of all their eſtates was given in, which affords an intereſting record of the ſtate of wealth in Scotland at that period <note n="9" place="bottom">Rymer, X, 327, 333.

But before proceeding to his memorable and ſpirited reign, it will be proper briefly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view the deeds and fate of the Scots in France.</p>
               <p>The year after the arrival of the Scotiſh auxiliaries, we find Henry V uſing the company of James, his captive, as a mean of preventing the hoſtilities of his ſubjects; but without effect, for they continued to ſerve the Dauphin, juſtly regarding their ſovereign's will as ineffectual while under conſtraint. The firſt important action in which the Scots appear is the battle of Baugé, ſo called from a village in Anjou, twenty two miles to the eaſt of Angers. The Dauphin had appointed the Scots, led by the earls of Buchan and Wigton, and Stuart of Darnley, to guard that province againſt the Duke of Clarence, whom Henry V had detached for its reduction. On the twenty ſecond day of March, 1421, the Engliſh when foraging took four Scots, and brought them to Clarence, who thus learned that the Scotiſh army and a few French lay at Baugé. The Duke inſtantly ſprung from the table exclaiming, "Let us attack them, they are ours: but let none follow ſave the men at arms:" and after a quick march he came to Little Baugé, where a few French defended the church, and gained time for Buchan to arrange his troops. The Engliſh aware of this left the church untaken, and advanced; but to a complete de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat. Clarence, diſtinguiſhed by a coronet of gold and jewels upon his helmet, was the firſt ſlain; and a ſimilar fate awaited the Earl of Kent, the Lords Grey and Roſs, and above four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred men at arms. The Earls of Huntingdon and Somerſet, and many others of note, were made captives. To
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0141700201:120"/>reward the Earl of Buchan, who had ſlain Clarence with his own hand, the Dauphin gave him the high diſtinction of Conſtable of France <note n="2" place="bottom">Des Urſins, 389. St. Remy, (at the end of the anonymous hiſtorian of Le Laboureur,) p. 153. Hiſtory by Berry, aſcribed to Alain Chartier, p. 51. Monſtrelet, c. 239.
<p>Bowar, 459, 460, has curious details. Clarence, after having been pierced with a ſpear by Sir William Swinton, was ſlain by Buchan with a battle-ax. The brothers of the future queen of Scotland were taken priſoners by the Scots. On hearing the tidings, the pontiff Martin V ſaid ludicrouſly, "In truth the Scots are the only antidote of the Engliſh."</p>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>In the following year the Conſtable took Avranches in Normandy; and probably learning the agreement which his father-in-law the Earl of Douglas had made with Henry V, he reſolved to detach him from the Engliſh intereſt. For which purpoſe he viſited Scotland, empowered to offer the earl the duchy of Touraine; and Douglas conſented to bring five thouſand men into France. The Dauphin, now Charles VII, rewarded Stuart of Darnley with the lordſhip of Aubigny in Berry; and the family and title were to become not a little illuſtrious. The death of Henry V had checked the Engliſh exertions; and Buchan and Douglas were only ordered to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Loire, and prevent the foe from entering Berry <note n="3" place="bottom">Bowar, 463.

               <p>But fortune now became adverſe to the Scotiſh auxiliaries; and two ſucceſſive defeats almoſt extinguiſhed them. The firſt happened at Crevan in Burgundy, in the year 1423.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0141700201:121"/>Charles VII intended that the Scots ſhould proceed to Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne, and defend that country againſt Saliſbury; but Aubigny laid ſiege to Crevan, and ſent for cannon, which were refuſed as he neglected his orders. Saliſbury advanced to raiſe the ſiege, and an action enſued in which the Scots were defeated: Stuart of Darnley and Aubigny, conſtable of the Scotiſh army, was taken priſoner; and ſoon after exchanged for the marſhal of Burgundy: Sir William Hamilton, and about nine hundred, were left on the field <note n="4" place="bottom">Jean Chartier, 4, Berry, 53, Hall, f. v. 86, Monſtrelet, II, 8.</note>.</p>
               <p>The other defeat, which may be regarded as final, happened in the firſt year of James; but the connexion renders its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription proper at this place. This was the memorable battle of Verneüil in Normandy, fought on the ſeventeenth of Auguſt, 1424. The archbiſhop of Rheims had been ſent embaſſador to Scotland, to procure a reinforcement, which landed in Bretagne; and Douglas, now Duke of Touraine, advanced to raiſe the ſiege of Yvry undertaken by the Engliſh. But the French king learning that a battle muſt be riſqued, before the place was relieved, aſſembled all his troops, and leaving Tours, with Buchan the conſtable, he met his barons at Chateaudun and advanced to Verneüil. Bedford upon this raiſed the ſiege of Yvry, and marched to meet the French and Scots. Arriving near Verneüil, he ſent a herald to Douglas, who had in deriſion called him John with the leaden ſword, informing him that he had come to drink with him, and that
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0141700201:122"/>he would wait till he had that honour. The Duke of Touraine anſwered that he was moſt welcome; that he had come from Scotland to find him, and he begged him to come quickly. If in theſe minute matters the manner of Plutarch be imitated, it is becauſe it intereſts, and paints men and manners. The battalions were ſoon arranged upon either ſide, and Douglas reſolved not to loſe an advantageous ſtation, but to await the Engliſh: the Vicomte of Narbonne, the French general, unhappily thought otherwiſe, and proceeded with the national raſhneſs which had decided the battles of Creſſy, Poitiers, Azincour. Douglas was forced to follow the example; and the army loſt breath, rank, and ſtation, while the enemy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained all. The French ſent two thouſand to attack the rear of the foe; but they were defeated by the Engliſh archers, and a general rout enſued. The Duke of Touraine, and his ſon-in-law the conſtable of France, and moſt of the Scotiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of note were ſlain: and of the French the Vicomte de Narbonne, the Count D'Aumale, and many other nobles: of common French and Scots fell about four thouſand five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.

Such was the event of the battle of Verneüil, which ruined the affairs of Charles VII, till about five years after, when the Maid of Orleans began to revive them.

               <p>AFTER two weak and inactive reigns, and two regencies of no ſuperior character, a monarch is to ſucceed, whoſe government is to be diſtinguiſhed for its novelty and vigour; and the houſe of Stuart is at laſt to know a ſovereign. James had now attained his thirtieth year; and his prime of life was yet further recommended by every advantage, which natural talents, and a complete education, could beſtow. In perſon he was rather under the middle ſize, but endued with ſuch firmneſs and agility as to excell in every manly exerciſe. In wreſtling, in the management of the bow, or the ſpear, in throwing the quoit, in running, in horſemanſhip, he yielded to none. But his mental abilities were yet more conſpicuous.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0141700201:124"/>A man of ſcience and learning, an excellent poet, a maſter of muſic, the fame of his accompliſhments reflected glory even on the throne. Illuſtrious in every perſonal virtue, free from any perſonal vice, his very amuſements adorned his character; his hours of leiſure being frequently dedicated to elegant writing, and miniature painting, to mechanical arts, and to the cultivation of the garden and the orchard <note n="1" place="bottom">Bowar, II, 504, ſeq Mair, 309.

               <p>The features of his government it is more difficult to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminate. If we believe ſome writers, not leſs than three thouſand men were put to death, in the two firſt years of his reign; and after the inroad of Donald Balloch, three hundred highland banditti met with the ſame fate <note n="2" place="bottom">Abercr. II, 311, from Hector Boyce, f. 361, a fit authority!</note>. Happily theſe matters are quite unknown to contemporary and authentic monuments of our hiſtory: the juſtice of James fell only on a few nobles, and ſome chiefs of clans; but the numerous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants of thoſe victims of equitable ſeverity embraced every occaſion to excite diſcontents, and propagate falſehoods againſt the government, falſehoods which have even paſt into the page of hiſtory, for one of the misfortunes of the houſe of Stuart has conſiſted in the prejudices of ſeveral Scotiſh hiſtorians. If any blame muſt fall, let it fall where it ought, upon the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule of the houſe of Albany. To a people who had lived for half a century under a looſe and delegated government, and who had been accuſtomed to regard licence as liberty, it is no wonder that the puniſhment of crimes ſeemed quite a new and ſtrange cruelty: that a ſalutary ſtrength of government ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0141700201:125"/>deſpotiſm: that a neceſſary and legal taxation aſſumed the ſhape of tyrannic extortion. The commons, led by the nobles, abſurdly regarded the cauſe of the latter as their own, and ſaw not that the king in cruſhing the ariſtocracy was doing the moſt eſſential ſervice to his people. The plans of James were ſagacious and profound, but ſometimes incur the charge of temerity; and while they partake of the greatneſs of genius, they are limited by the want of a ſufficient power in the Scotiſh monarchy for their complete execution. In a word James is fully entitled to the uncommon character of a great ſovereign, in the arts of government and of peace <note n="3" place="bottom">Bowar, 511, records and apophthegm of James, when he was informed on entering his kingdom, that the regencies had left it a ſoene of fraud and rapine, "By the help of God, though I ſhould myſelf lead the life of a dog, I ſhall make the key keep the caſtle, and the buſh ſecure the cow."</note>.</p>
               <p>Upon entering his kingdom, <note place="margin">Eaſter 23 Apr.</note> James proceeded to Edinburgh, were he keeped the feſtival of Eaſter; and afterwards ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing to Scone, <note place="margin">21 May</note> was there ſolemnly crowned with his queen; Murdac duke of Albany, as earl of Fife, performing the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of placing his ſovereign in the throne <note n="4" place="bottom">Bowar, 474.</note>.

The reiterated theme of battles, and negotiations, may now be diverſified with more intereſting intelligence, and the arts of peace may afford a pleaſing contraſt to the devaſtations of war. In this national council it was
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0141700201:126"/>decreed that the antient privileges and freedom of the church be confirmed: that the king's peace be firmly held, and no private wars allowed: that no man ſhould travel with more followers than he could maintain <note n="7" place="bottom">Acts, f. 2, c. 5.</note>: that efficient adminiſtrators of law be appointed through all the realm: that no extortions from churchmen, or farmers, in particular be admitted: that the cuſtoms and borough rates be aſſigned to the king, and mines of gold and ſilver under certain reſtrictions: that the clergy ſhall not paſs the ſea without the king's permiſſion, nor have penſions out of benefices in Scotland: that gold and ſilver ſhould not be exported but upon paying a high cuſtom: that all perſons exceeding twelve years of age ſhould be taught archery: that agriculture be protected by the deſtruction of rooks, and by a prevention from ſetting fire to heathy ground while the corn was ſtanding: that certain cuſtoms be raiſed on horſe, cattle, and ſheep, and herrings, and on furs: that inns be kept in every borough; and no beggars allowed, except permitted by the ſheriff in the country, and in towns by the aldermen or bailies <note n="8" place="bottom">Ib. f. v. 2, f. 5.</note>.</p>
               <p>Such were the ſalutary regulations of this parliament, many of them beſpeaking political prudence, and others an amiable ſimplicity of manners. But there were two others of remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able import, and therefore reſerved for a ſeparate conſideration. The firſt orders the ſheriffs to enquire what lands belonged to the crown, under the preceding monarchs David II, and the two laſt Roberts, declaring at the ſame time that the king may ſummon the holders to ſhew their charters <note n="9" place="bottom">Ib. f. v. 2.</note>. The ſecond impoſes a large ſubſidy, in order to defray the ſum payable to England for the king's maintenance <note n="1" place="bottom">Ib. f. 3. See Appendix.</note>. Though the juſtice of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0141700201:127"/>theſe ordinances cannot be queſtioned, yet their policy may. The former, it is believed, produced no effect, except ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, and diſcontent, among a number of the ſubjects: and the latter excited an almoſt univerſal diſſatisfaction. Though a ſubſidy to defray the king's ranſom, if taken priſoner, was one of the few taxes authorized by the feudal ſyſtem, yet the preſent circumſtances did not, to the public mind, juſtify the impoſition. The tax conſiſted of twelve pennies in the pound of all ſorts of production, farms, and annual rents, cattle and grain, whether of the clergy, or of the laity, and to continue for two years. Auditors, or chief receivers, were appointed, who in the firſt year collected about fourteen thouſand marks; but in the ſecond year the popular expoſtulations increaſed and prevailed <note n="2" place="bottom">Bowar, 482, himſelf one of the auditors.</note>. The conſequence was, that the ſum payable for the king's maintenance in England was never defrayed.</p>
               <p>It was not to be expected that the uſurpations of the family of Albany ſhould paſs unrevenged; <note place="margin">1425</note> and James was no ſooner firm on the throne of his anceſtors than he thought of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging this great duty in a ſpirited manner. As their power had continued for a long time, and was deeply rooted in the nation, it was neceſſary to try the public pulſe, an proceed by degrees. Accordingly, in the very commencement of his exerciſe of authority, James had ordered Walter, the eldeſt ſon of the late regent Murdac, into cuſtody; and at the ſame time, probably only to veil his deſigns, and prevent the family of Albany from being regarded as the ſole objects of his reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Malcom Fleming of Cumbernald, and Thomas Boyd of Kilmarnoc, ſhared the ſame fate, but were ſoon after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed <note n="3" place="bottom">Bowar, 481, dates this impriſonment on the 13th May 1424, before the king's coronation.</note>. The next objects of impriſonment were Duncan
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0141700201:128"/>earl of Lennox, father in law to Murdac, and Sir Robert Graham <note n="4" place="bottom">Bowar, 482. This Sir Robert Graham was the ſame who afterwards aſſaſſinated James. Buch. X, 28.</note>. At length the public inclination being ſufficiently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> explored, James ventured on a moſt daring expedient; and ſummoning a parliament to Perth he gave orders to arreſt at once Murdac duke of Albany, <note place="margin">12 Mar.</note> and Alexander Stuart his ſecond ſon, with the earls of Douglas, Angus, March, and not leſs than twenty gentlemen of great anceſtry and power <note n="5" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. As it is certain that the revenge only extended to the houſe of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bany, and was meant to proceed no further, hiſtorians find ſome difficulty in accounting for the pretext or motive to this large exertion of authority. The pretext might perhaps be, that the priſoners had not complied with the late act of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in producing their charters; and as moſt of them, if not all, had been warm ſupporters of the family of Albany, the motive appears more certainly to have been the prevention of any inſurrection in favour of that houſe. Inſtantly upon the ſeizure of Albany, the king took poſſeſſion of his caſtles of Falkland in Fife, and Down in Menteith: Murdac was committed to Carlaveroc caſtle, and Iſabella his ducheſs to Tantallon, places remote from the ſeat of their feudal influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <note n="6" place="bottom">Bowar, 483.</note>.</p>
               <p>That the precaution uſed by James, in ſecuring the friends of Albany, was not vain, may appear from the conduct of James Stuart, the youngeſt ſon of the duke. Having eſcaped his intended arreſt, he, with the aſſiſtance of Finlay biſhop of Liſmore or Argyle, raiſed a band of Highland freebooters, aſſaulted and burned the town of Dunbarton, <note place="margin">3 May</note> and put to the ſword Sir John Stuart of Dundonald, uncle to the king, with thirty two men. The monarch, juſtly enraged at this inſult,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0141700201:129"/>ordered the ſon of Albany to be proclaimed a felon; and ſo hot was the purſuit that he was forced, with the biſhop and other accomplices, to ſeek refuge in Ireland, whence they never returned. Five of his band being taken in a few days, ſuffered the moſt ignominious and extreme puniſhment of the law <note n="7" place="bottom">Bowar, 483.</note>.</p>
               <p>After a delay of two months neceſſary to collect ſufficient proofs of Albany's guilt, and to prepare the minds of the people, <note place="margin">18 May</note> James adjourned the parliament to Stirling, and this important trial was inſtituted. The jury conſiſted of twenty one members of parliament, all of whom, as forming only one houſe, were in Scotland regarded as peers <note n="8" place="bottom">Home, lord Kaims, Hiſt. Law Tracts, 272.</note>. The judge was the king himſelf, fitting on the throne of juſtice, with all the pomp of royalty; and this uſual practice of the monarch preſiding in his own cauſe may be vindicated from the ancient ideas concerning a jury, who were eſteemed arbitrators of fact and of law, the judge being only the organ of their verdict. It is remarkable that among the jury we find Walter Stuart earl of Athole, Archibald earl of Douglas, William earl of Angus, George earl of March, and three gentlemen who had been arreſted with Albany <note n="9" place="bottom">Bowar, 483.</note>. As by the Scotiſh law a majority was ſufficient to condemn a priſoner, this jury ſeems to have been artfully managed, in order to remove any ſuſpicion from the king, and to throw the ſeverity of the verdict upon Albany's own adherents. Walter the regent's eldeſt ſon was firſt tried, found guilty, <note place="margin">24 May</note> and inſtantly beheaded; any delay ſerving no purpoſe in ſuch a caſe but to create danger. Being a man of tall and comely ſtature, eloquent and affable, he was rather regreted. Nor did the vulgar voice leſs commiſerate his brother's gigantic ſhape, the former authority of Albany, the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0141700201:130"/>venerable age of Lennox, a nobleman approaching his eightieth year, who were all three executed on the following day <note n="1" place="bottom">Bowar, 483. The Coupar MS. ib. note, ſays Walter Stuart was convicted of <hi>robbery;</hi> a hint that the depredation of the royal domains, and revenues, was the chief charge againſt all the criminals.</note>. We are left in the dark concerning the oſtenſible grounds of their condemnation; but it is probable that their ſeizure of the royal lands, and property, formed a chief article. The eſtates of Fife, Menteith, and Lennox, with others, thus became the property of the crown, and contributed in ſome degree to compenſate the defalcations, which had happened under the regencies <note n="2" place="bottom">But the eſtate of Lennox was not forfeited, and continued in a kind of abeyance.

               <p>It muſt not be omitted that, in the ſecond parliament of this reign, held at Perth as above mentioned, ſeveral prudent laws were paſſed, for the more effectual puniſhment of thoſe who infringed the acts of the national council <note n="3" place="bottom">Acts, f. 6.</note>: for preventing any leagues among the ſubjects, an edict evidently pointing to the preſent circumſtances of Albany's adherents; as does another, puniſhing the receivers of rebels by forfeiture, and another noted ſtatute condemning to death and confiſcation all guilty of propagating falſehoods between the king and the people. Other laws of this aſſembly contain regulations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to trade and agriculture, and the adminiſtration of juſtice; on which laſt head it is ordered that all the inferior judges abide by the ſtrict tenor of the law, and that the king may warn them ſo to do, as well thoſe within regalities as others: that if a poor perſon cannot ſee an advocate, the king ſhall provide one: that if the ſovereign pardons, on condition of the damage being compenſated to the plaintiff, conſideration
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0141700201:131"/>be had of the highlanders who before the king's return were uſed to rob and kill each other, for from them the compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot be raiſed, but from the lowlanders <note n="4" place="bottom">Acts, f. 6—8. The officers of ſtate appointed by James appear, from Scotſtarvet's Calendars, to have been, John Cameron biſhop of Glaſgow chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor; Sir John Foreſter chamberlain; Myrton dean of Glaſgow treaſurer; Robert Lauder of Baſs juſticiary; Walter Ogilvy maſter of the houſehold; John Shevis clerk of regiſter; William Foulis ſecretary, afterwards keeper of the privy ſeal; John of Spens comptroller.
<p>On the 8th June 1425, James iſſued a commiſſion to Henry biſhop of St. Andrews, authorizing him to reſume all alienations from the church, with power of anathema, and orders to all juſticiaries to aſſiſt. This curious paper is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in Harl. MS. 4637, Vol. III, f. 189, with an unimportant deed of that patriotic prelate, 18 April 1414.</p>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>While James was celebrating the anniverſary of his birth at St. Andrews, <note place="margin">Aug.</note> attended by Douglas, Mar, Murray, Angus, and other nobles, he gave audience to the Flemiſh embaſſadors who had been deputed to ſettle ſome commercial differences. The Scotiſh merchants had, during the regencies, been treated with great arrogance, nay even letters of marque had been iſſued againſt them, in Flanders, which, with the duke of Burgundy, ſuſtained the Engliſh party againſt France. James had in conſequence ordered the Scotiſh trade to be transferred to Middleburg in Zealand; but upon the offer of compenſation, and enlarged privileges, by the embaſſadors, the commerce was reſtored to Flanders <note n="5" place="bottom">Bowar, 487.</note>. As Venice was the grand ſeat of trade between Aſia and Europe, ſo Bruges in Flanders was the commercial link, which connected the merchandize of Venice, and the ſouth of Europe, with its northern countries. Moſt articles of manufacture being alſo imported from Flanders by the Scots, who were yet little verſed in the arts of induſtry, it is no wonder that the Flemiſh were eager to retain a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0141700201:132"/>which was one great cauſe of impoveriſhing Scotland, and contributed not a little to the riches of Flanders.</p>
               <p>It is with much complacency that this narration now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds with the hiſtory of peace, for which ample materials begin with this reign to be found in Scotland. <note place="margin">1426 11 Mar.</note> In a third parliament, it was ordered that all merchants ſhould import ſome armour, and arms, with their cargoes <note n="6" place="bottom">Acts, f. v. 8.</note>: that all the lieges ſhould be governed by the laws of the realm, and not by particular laws, or privileges, or by the laws of other countries: that no man, who had accuſed another, ſhould be of the jury on his trial: that the prelates, earls, barons, and freeholders of the king, ſhould appear perſonally in parliament, and not by procurators, except on lawful cauſe: that the books of the law be examined, and reformed: that to ſupport the inns, travellers ſhould lodge in them, and not with friends: that none ſhould paſs into Ireland without licence, as the rebels had been there received, nor ſhould the Iriſh come to Scotland as they might be ſpies for the Engliſh: that a court of ſeſſion be inſtituted, the chancellor, and certain diſcreet perſons of the three eſtates, to ſit thrice a year, for a period of time, and hear all cauſes: that they who have nothing ſhall labour for their living: that the acts of parliament be regiſtered, and copies given to prelates, barons, and burgeſſes, at their expence <note n="7" place="bottom">Ibid. f. v. II.</note>. This laſt act was particularly neceſſary, in order to render the parliamentary inſtitutions known, and practical: and after all it is recorded, as an apophthegm of Buchanan, that in Scotland one great act of parliament was wanted, namely a decree to enjoin the ſtrict obſervance of the others. For a chief part of government, though unobſerved by politicians, reſts in the ſpirit of the people: laws are vain
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0141700201:133"/>without manners: and a nation, accuſtomed to looſe miſrule, regards even law as a part of its licence, as a ſermon and not as a duty, as a ſplendid theory and not as ſolid practice. In a ſpecial aſſize of this parliament, regulations were introduced into weights and meaſures, and proviſions were made againſt the fatal effects of domeſtic fire <note n="8" place="bottom">Acts, f. 12. The date is 11 March 1426, which by modern computation is 1427, but the next acts are of Sept. 1426: the miſtake ſeems to have ariſen from this parliament having ſitten till after the year 1426, commenced on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The frequent aſſembling of the national council does great honour to James, for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs inclined to deſpotiſm have ever trembled to meet the repreſentatives of their people; and the acts reflect praiſe on the patriotiſm and the wiſdom of the inſtitutors.</p>

               <p>Another parliament, held in the ſame year <note n="1" place="bottom">Acts, f. 14. Compare Glendook's folio edition, p. 12.</note>, <note place="margin">30 Sept.</note> after ſome regulations concerning trade and agriculture, ordered that every lord beyond the Grampian mountains, in whoſe lands ancient caſtles ſtood, ſhould repair and dwell in them, or at leaſt one of his friends, in order to govern the country and expend the produce in the territory. To give an example James com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the caſtle of Inverneſs to be repaired <note n="2" place="bottom">Bewar, 488.</note>: and finding that the highland chiefs were ſtrangers to his laws and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he reſolved to inculcate into their obduracy ſome prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of good order by a ſalutary ſeverity. The Lords of the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0141700201:134"/>Iſles in particular, by their conſtant confederacy with England, and repeated inroads, well deſerved a ſignal chaſtiſement. In purſuance of theſe motives, certainly juſt and laudable, the king aſſembled a parliament at Inverneſs in the ſpring, <note place="margin">1427</note> which the highland chieftains were ſpecially ſummoned to attend; and ſuddenly arreſted Alexander Lord of the Iſles, and his mother the Counteſs of Roſs, Angus Duff leader of four thouſand Mackays of Strathnavern, Kenneth More chief of two thouſand, John Roſs, William Leſley, Angus Moray, and Macmaken, each alſo a chief of two thouſand; and in ſhort about fifty principal heads of lawleſs clans. Two of them, leaders of a thouſand each, were inſtantly tried, condemned, and beheaded; and one, who had murdered the late Lord of the Iſles, was alſo executed in impartial juſtice. The others were ſcattered, as priſoners, among the caſtles of different lords through the kingdom; and after a time ſome were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to death, and ſome were reſtored to liberty. The Lord of the Iſles and his mother were retained in captivity till, apparently after a year or more, the former was delivered, while the latter ſeems in vain to have been retained as an hoſtage for his fidelity <note n="3" place="bottom">Bowar, 488, 489. She was daughter, and heireſs, of Sir Walter Leſley, who, with his brother Norman, took Alexandria in the time of David II, and had a French title. Ib.</note>. Such were the proceedings upon this occaſion, which by ſome have been termed ſanguinary; but, if neceſſity be the tyrant's plea, it is alſo that of law and of juſtice. Lenient and conciliatory meaſures would have had the ſame effect as muſic upon the deaf, and could have ſerved no end but to increaſe the pride of theſe chieftains, and to debaſe the laws and the monarchy. Perhaps it might however have proved more political if James, upon the capture of the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0141700201:135"/>chiefs, had inſiſted upon receiving their ſons, or neareſt rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as hoſtages; and thus not only have had pledges for their good behaviour, but alſo an opportunity of contributing to civilize the highlands by beſtowing on the future chiefs a proper education: a conduct which might have paſſed into a perpetual rule. But in the choice of difficulties it is almoſt impoſſible to ſeize the exact mean; and if equity enforce the acknowledgement that James was apt to do too much, and too little, the peculiarities of the country, and of the time, muſt come in for a ſhare of the blame.</p>
               <p>It was ordered in a parliament, held at Perth, <note place="margin">1 July</note> that thoſe burgeſſes who were ſummoned to parliament, and were abſent without lawful cauſe, ſhould be fined in ten pounds each: that the lawſuits of Scotiſh merchants in Zealand, Flanders, or other foreign countries, be decided in Scotland: and ſeveral acts appear for the puniſhment of murder and felony <note n="4" place="bottom">Acts, f. 15—17. In the original the date is 1426, but errors in the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merals are not uncommon in the ſtatutes, and it is acknowledged in the preface that the copyiſts have often fallen into miſtakes. The 22d year of the king, and tueſday being the 1ſt of July, monday the 7th, are circumſtances which fix 1427, the dominical letter being E.</note>.</p>
               <p>The next year is diſtinguiſhed by a conſiderable innovation in the Scotiſh conſtitution. <note place="margin">1428 March</note> An act of parliament paſſed that the ſmall barons or freeholders, might diſpenſe with their attendance in the national council, upon appointing two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners from each ſhire: theſe repreſentatives were to have the privilege of chuſing the ſpeaker of parliament; and the expence of their attendance was to be defrayed by thoſe who formerly owed that duty <note n="5" place="bottom">Ibid. f. v. 17.</note>. <note place="margin">July</note> Another remarkable decree after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards appeared, enjoining the ſucceſſors and heirs of prelates and barons, to take an oath of fidelity to the queen <note n="6" place="bottom">Ibid. f. 19.</note>; an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0141700201:136"/>probably pointing to her regency, in caſe of the king's demiſe, and the immaturity of the prince.</p>
               <p>Some trifling negotiations had taken place in the preceding year with England, now governed by the duke of Gloceſter and cardinal Beaufort; but James, though indebted to that kingdom for an education excellent and truly royal, to which, and to the ſchool of adverſity, he owed the expanſion of his talents, had yet no reaſon to be ſatisfied with the generoſity, or the friendſhip, of the Engliſh court <note n="7" place="bottom">Rymer, X, 376, erroneouſly aſcribes a commiſſion of James IV to the biſhop of Moray, for a perſonal conference with Henry VII, to this year; miſtaking the 22d of James IV, 1509, for the 22d of James I, 1427. Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cromby, who eaſily miſleads and is miſled, has fallen, II, 280: Guthrie, III, 315, 316, is as uſual ludicrouſly wiſe upon the occaſion, though the miſtake had been detected by Keith, Biſhops, 87. Henry VI was only ſix year of age.</note>. The Scotiſh mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch was therefore well inclined to follow the former tide of politics towards France, whoſe king Charles VII was ſtill in a moſt reduced ſituation, and nearly overwhelmed by the power of England and Burgundy. Reſolved by every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to procure the aid of Scotland, Charles diſpatched the Archbiſhop of Rheims, and John Stuart, Count de Dreux and Lord of Darnley <note n="8" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Aubigny</hi> was now in abeyance?</note>, for that purpoſe. In conſequence of their inſtructions, the embaſſadors offered to conclude a contract of marriage between Louis the Dauphin, afterwards Louis XI, and Margaret the eldeſt daughter of Scotland, both then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, upon condition, that James ſhould ſend ſix thouſand effective men to the aſſiſtance of Charles, being the only dower required. The princeſs was nevertheleſs provided in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and contingencies, as ample and honourable as had been ever granted, upon any royal marriage of France. Such terms could not be refuſed; and the contract was ſigned and ratified. Nay, the two monarchs mutually ſwore to obſerve the former
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0141700201:137"/>alliances, entered into between their kingdoms: and Charles aſſigned to the Scotiſh king the county of Xaintonge, and Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Rochfort <note n="9" place="bottom">MS.

The ſix thouſand men were to be ſent when the French fleet arrived to tranſmit them; but the ſtate of affairs, which changed in favour of Charles the following year, rendered the maid of Orleans an object of greater atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; to the increaſing proſperity of France the aid was unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and was never ſent, nor demanded; but as no infringe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could be charged, the treaty of marriage maintained its force, and ſeven years after was fully completed.</p>
               <p>The government of England was rather alarmed at this new connexion between Scotland and France, <note place="margin">1429</note> and an interview was propoſed between James and cardinal Beaufort: the king was to be attended by a thouſand horſe, <note place="margin">10 Feb.</note> and the cardinal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained permiſſion from the Engliſh court to meet him either on the borders, or in Scotland <note n="1" place="bottom">Rymer, X, 410. On the 1ſt Dec. 1428 a ſafe conduct had been iſſued to James, to meet the cardinal at Durham or Newcaſtle, ib. 403; but the king rejected the propoſal. Yet he renewed the truce, 12 July 1429, ib. 428.</note>. But the interview was appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently not carried into effect, and was perhaps found to be unneceſſary, as the French alliance did not actually occaſion any infringement of the truce.</p>
               <p>The Lord of the Iſles, who had been at laſt ſet at liberty, after many admonitions and injunctions of fidelity, ſoon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged his revenge by gathering his lawleſs bands, and burning
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0141700201:138"/>the town of Inverneſs. James, juſtly enraged, collected an army, and overtook the invader in a marſhy ground near Lochaber; <note place="margin">23 June</note> where the freebooting lord was totally defeated.

The latter country had, in 1384, paſſed to the dominion of the houſe of Burgundy by marriage; and this treaty was concluded with Philip III duke of Burgundy, who in 1430 was to become alſo duke of Brabant, and in 1433 earl of Holland and Hainault; united principalities, which ranked him among the chief potentates of Europe.</p>
               <p>Several patriotic regulations were iſſued by the parliament concerning the forms of procedure; <note place="margin">1430 March</note> and a ſumptuary law was
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0141700201:139"/>paſſed, permitting no men to wear ſilk, or furs, except lords, and knights, and their eldeſt ſons and heirs. The different ſorts of armour, and arms, to be uſed by various ranks of perſons, were accurately preſcribed: and it was ordered that the ſame laws ſhould be obſerved in relation to wrecked veſſels, as were uſed in the countries to which they belonged: and that advocates ſhould ſwear to their belief in the juſtice of the cauſe which they pleaded. All Scotiſhmen, who travel to England without the king's leave, are declared traitors; and, by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable decree, all barons and lords, having lands on the weſtern or the northern ſeas, particularly thoſe oppoſite to the iſlands, are enjoined to furniſh a certain number of galleys, according to the terms of their tenures <note n="5" place="bottom">Acts, f. v. 19—f. 22.</note>. The want of a fleet, to keep the iſlands in due ſubordination, muſt have ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted this laſt inſtitution: the policy was laudable, and it muſt be allowed that James attempted more than all his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors to join the diſcordant parts of his kingdom in firm and compact union; but this decree, like moſt other Scotiſh acts of parliament, ſeems to have been carefully eluded.</p>
               <p>The proſperity of James was further advanced by his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the father of male-twins, <note place="margin">16 Oct.</note> one of whom, James, was to aſcend the throne upon the premature death of his father; but Alexander, the firſt-born, died in early infancy <note n="6" place="bottom">Bowar, 490.</note>.</p>

On the 24th May 1430 Martin V granted to James, and others, an abſolution from the oaths taken in England. MS. Harl. 4637, Vol. III, f. 155.</note>: and the wiſdom of the Scotiſh monarch preferred to the vain glory of war his patriotic cares for the eſtabliſhment of law and order in his dominions. For
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0141700201:140"/>unknown cauſes James ordered the Earl of Douglas, and Sir John Kennedy, his own nephews by the maternal ſide, to be impriſoned. Perhaps Douglas had been guilty of ſome private practices with England; or the king wiſhed to ſecure the peace of the ſouth of Scotland, while he was employed in quelling the northern inſurrections, by retaining Douglas its chief leader in captivity. Conjecture wanders in ſuch enquiry; but it is certain that Douglas remained a priſoner till the end of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember this year; when the king in a parliament, held, as uſual, at Perth, conſented, at the requeſt of the queen, nobles, and prelates, to deliver both Douglas and the lord of the Iſles <note n="8" place="bottom">Bowar, 490.</note>.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, in ſpite of all the endeavours of James, the highlands remained in a ſtate of conſtant rebellion and ſavage anarchy. In Strathnavern Angus Duff, and Angus Moray, both of them lately delivered from the impriſonment ordered at Inverneſs, met in conflict with twelve hundred men upon either ſide; and ſo fierce was the encounter that hardly nice of the whole were left alive <note n="9" place="bottom">Ibid. 491. Angus Duff was the chief of the noted Mackays of Strath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>navern, ib. 489.</note>. Donald Balloch, a relation of the Lord of the Iſles, landed in Lochaber with a conſiderable force; and finding Alexander Stuart Earl of Mar, and Alan Stuart Earl of Caithneſs, ſtationed at Inverlochy, to defend the weſtern coaſt, he attacked them, though leaders of a larger number, and put them to a total rout. Alan, who was the ſon of Walter Earl of Athol, was ſlain, with ſixteen ſquires of his own family, and many others: Alexander, and the remainder eſcaped by flight.

               <p>After a ſhort period, <note place="margin">1432</note> condemned to the ſilence of hiſtory, but which probably paſſed in quieting the commotions in the highlands, of which no further intelligence occurs during this reign, <note place="margin">1433</note> the ſcene of public affairs again opens. The Engliſh government, ſufficiently alarmed at the declining ſtate of their power in France, became more and more anxious to prevent the now impending completion of the marriage treaty between that kingdom and Scotland: and for this purpoſe ſent Lord Scrope to the court of James, with offers of great advantage. His propoſals were a firm and perpetual peace, and the reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Roxburgh and Berwick, and every portion of terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory which Scotland could juſtly claim <note n="3" place="bottom">Bowar, 498. In Veſp. F. VII, f. 53, is a paper 23 July, (11 H 6, 1433.) being an anſwer to the credence of Roulle, the envoy of James, and promiſing that lord Scrope ſhould ſoon be ſent to promote peace.</note>. There is reaſon to believe that the Engliſh were ſincere; but the honour of the king and of the nation, and the mutual intereſts of France and Scotland, were motives momentous enough to cauſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of even ſuperior terms. The diſcuſſion of this affair ended rather ludicrouſly. <note place="margin">Oct.</note> A parliament being called at Perth, the propoſitions were agitated before the king, in the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nican Church; and the nobles and prelates ſeemed to accept the terms, ſaying that peace and liberty were the objects of their chief deſire. But the abbots of Scone and Inchcolm, fitter aſſiſtants at a monaſtic diſpute than at a public delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, aſſerted that the Scotiſh king could not treat of peace with England, becauſe of the confederacy with France, which
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0141700201:142"/>had been examined by the univerſity of Paris, and confirmed by the Pope. Other objections were alſo ſtarted; and the day being waſted in diſcuſſion, it was agreed to reſume the ſubject on the morrow, when John Fogo, abbot of Melroſe, alledged, on the other ſide, that no perſon could abide by the divine laws, who depended on the will of another; and that no king could lawfully ſwear to another that he would not make peace with a third, except by the conſent of the ſecond. Violent altercations among the clergy now aroſe; the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was transformed into a hall of eccleſiaſtic diſputes; and as ſuch diſputes never decide any thing, the members ſeparated without determination, only the very want of deciſion left the alliance with France in full force; and the Engliſh propoſitions were conſidered as rejected. Lindoris, the inquiſitor, called Fogo to account for his ſentiments, as ſavouring of hereſy; and Fogo retorted by ſeveral epiſtles, but was at laſt forced to make conceſſions <note n="4" place="bottom">Bowar, the abbot of Inch Colm, 499, 500.</note>. This ſtrange affair calls to remembrance the latter hiſtory of the Greek empire, when vehement church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ruined the national concerns by idle diſputes; and ſo totally uſeleſs is learning out of its place, that a ſenate of American ſavages, exerting only their plain ſenſe, would have diſcuſſed ſuch a ſubject with far more ability than all the abbots in the world. To complete the abſurdity, the Scotiſh church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men gave out that the only intention of England had been to excite ſchiſms and hereſies in Scotland <note n="5" place="bottom">Ibid. 499. A letter of James to the Council of Buſle, Aug. 1433, occurs in Martene's Anecdota, Paris 1729, folio, Tom. VIII, p. 615.</note>; as if the very idea of ſuch imbecility could fall within the conception of any political mind.</p>
               <p>The clergy had, in the preceding part of this year, exerted their power in a manner yet more blameable. Paul Crawar
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0141700201:143"/>a German, and a follower of Huſs, having come from Prague to Scotland, where he exerciſed medicine, was called to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for his opinions by Lindoris the inquiſitor, condemned, and burnt at St. Andrews <note n="6" place="bottom">Bowar, 495.</note>.</p>
               <p>James proceeded in his ſchemes of humbling his nobility, <note place="margin">1434</note> ſchemes too great for his powers of execution <note n="7" place="bottom">On the 1ſt Feb. appear inſtructions to lord Fitzhugh, concerning the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs demanded by James for ſome Scotiſh ſhips taken at ſea. Veſp. F. VII, f. 57, original ſigned by the Engliſh council. Of the 7th Feb. ib. f. 58, is a credence to Mr. Stephen Wilton, envoy to James. As to the propoſed mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage between Henry VI, (now eleven years of age,) and a daughter of James, it had often been deliberated; but the council heſitated, and referred it to Henry's kindred; ſo a great council was to meet at Eaſter in London, and their opinion ſhould be remitted to James. Dragon purſuivant had lately been ſent to Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land concerning the march infractions. His inſtructions occur, ib. f. 49.</note>. The earls of March had been long remarkable for their dubious fidelity to Scotland, and repeated ingratitude to its ſovereigns: nor was the memory of the late revolt, and the miſchiefs which it had produced in the preceding reign, eaſily to be extinguiſhed. Having therefore quelled the iſles and highlands, which, as the moſt important office, engaged his firſt cares, the king re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to complete his own power, and that of his kingdom, by removing the family of March from a territory which had been the free gift of a Scotiſh king to an Engliſh exile, and by placing that houſe in a more northern and ſecure part of Scotland. In purſuance of this juſt and prudent plan, James ordered the earl of March to be confined in the caſtle of Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, and took poſſeſſion of the fortreſs of Dunbar, the chief ſeat of the family <note n="8" place="bottom">Bowar, 500.</note>.</p>
               <p>A parliament being ſummoned, <note place="margin">1435 10 Jan.</note> two clergymen, and ſeven commons, were appointed to hear and report all cauſes during
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0141700201:144"/>the ſeſſion <note n="9" place="bottom">Abercromby, II, 292, gives their names.</note>; an inſtitution not explained, but apparently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for expediting this particular buſineſs, and quite diſtinct from the committee of lords of the articles, who are known as early as the reign of David II. The king's advocates alledged that the father of March having engaged in open re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt the kingdom, it was not in the power of Robert duke of Albany the regent, to pardon him, a privilege belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the crown only; but that the eſtates were forfeited: and that, by the laws of Scotland, all alienations of crown-lands, to which deſcription the forfeited eſtates of March be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed, were void, when made during the minority, or cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, of the ſovereign. After a long debate the parliament decreed by the mouth of David Dempſter the ſpeaker, that the eſtates of March were forfeited, and remained a part of the royal property <note n="1" place="bottom">Ibid. Acts, f. v. 23.</note>. The king completed his deſign, by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately granting to March the earldom of Buchan, which had ſome time before reverted to the crown <note n="2" place="bottom">Bowar, 500. The earl of Buchan, killed at Verneüil 1424, left only a daughter. Stewart's Gen. 115.</note>. The only other act of this parliament engages all the members to give written promiſes of fidelity to the queen <note n="3" place="bottom">Acts, f. 24.</note>: and it ſeems that James was not unaware that his public ſpirited meaſures laid him open to attempts of private revenge: a ſuſpicion, alas, too ſoon to be verified.</p>
               <p>A conſiderable property accrued to the crown, by the death of Alexander earl of Mar, a perſonage repeatedly mentioned before. This nobleman had debaſed his youth by bad actions; but, in the latter part of his life, had acquired no ſmall repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in foreign wars. Being a natural ſon of Alexander, the fourth ſon of Robert II, his eſtates and effects, as provided
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0141700201:145"/>by the old Scotiſh laws concerning baſtardy, fell to the king <note n="4" place="bottom">Bowar, 500.</note>. There may be a ſurmize that Walter earl of Athole, only ſurviving uncle of the king, being alſo uncle of Mar, who left no ſurviving iſſue <note n="5" place="bottom">Mar's ſon Thomas died before his father. Sutherland Caſe, ch. V, p. 48.</note>, had entertained ambitious hopes of adding this contiguous earldom to his own, and that of Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern, which the king had beſtowed on him eight years before; and that his diſappointment was one incentive to the atrocious murder of his nephew and ſovereign, if he really was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in that crime.</p>
               <p>An infringement of the truce happened on the part of England. Sir Robert Ogle younger, in ſupport of one of the rebels againſt James, <note place="margin">10 Sept.</note> entered Scotland with a conſiderable force, and ravaged the country about Halton and Paxton. After a conflict, in which about forty were ſlain, Ogle was defeated, and made priſoner with moſt of his followers, by William earl of Angus, Hepburn of Hailes, and Ramſay of Dalhouſie. <note place="margin">30 Sept.</note> James warmly remonſtrated to the Engliſh court againſt this wanton infraction <note n="6" place="bottom">Bowar, 500, ſays Ogle was defeated at Piperden. The date is aſcertained by the correſpondence of James and Henry on the ſubject, mentioned in the long inſtructions of the Engliſh council for redreſs, Veſp. F. VII, f. 48, dated 5 Feb. regni 14=1436. This inroad is ludicrouſly magnified by our hiſtorians.</note>.</p>
               <p>The dauphin of France having now attained his thirteenth year, <note place="margin">1436</note> and the Scotiſh princeſs her twelfth, it was reſolved to complete the marriage. Two French envoys arrived, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troth the bride; and ſhe was ſent to France attended by a ſmall fleet, and an honourable train, of which the chief perſons were William Sinclair earl of Orkney the admiral, and John biſhop of Brechin. The others amounted to ſixteen knights and ſquires, and a hundred and forty young gentlemen: they were guarded
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0141700201:146"/>by a thouſand armed men, in three galleys, and ſix barges. The Engliſh government, irritated at the rejection of their propoſals, ſent out a fleet of one hundred and eighty veſſels, to intercept the princeſs; and they awaited her appearance in the channel. Meantime a number of Flemiſh merchant ſhips appeared, loaded with wine from Rochelle, which were cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured by the Engliſh, but a Spaniſh fleet ſuddenly approaching recaptured the prizes. During theſe conteſts, the royal bride arrived ſafe at Rochelle, <note place="margin">May</note> being forced to reach that part of France, as the Engliſh and their allies poſſeſſed the north: and a diſpenſation of age being granted by the archbiſhop of Tours as dioceſan, <note place="margin">13 June</note> the marriage was ſoon after ſolemnized. <note place="margin">6 July</note> Though James was, by the feudal law, entitled to a ſubſidy from his people upon this occaſion, yet he had diſcovered from experience their inability, or diſinclination, to pay any tax; and he was contented with the contributions of the principal laity and clergy, which were not a little liberal <note n="7" place="bottom">Bowar, 485, 482. A minute account of her reception in France, and marriage, may be ſeen in the Hiſt. de Charles VII, par Jean Chartier, edit. Louvre 1661, fol. p. 91. The diſpenſations, and other papers relating to the marriage, may be found in the curious hiſtory of Louis XI by Duclos, Haye, 1750, 8vo. Tome III, p. 4—15.</note>.</p>
               <p>The unhappy bride had paſſed to a huſband of famed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity; and not all her prudence, her wit, her love of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, her taſte for poetry, her affability, could ſave her from the pangs of domeſtic diſtreſs. After an unfruitful marriage of nine years, her extreme delicacy of mind cauſed her to fall a ſacrifice to a vague word of a villainous courtier <note n="8" place="bottom">See the notes on the year 1445.</note>.</p>
               <p>Enraged at the manifeſt hoſtility committed by the Engliſh, in the attempt to intercept his daughter, the delay of redreſs for the incurſion of the former year; and probably deſirous of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0141700201:147"/>preventing any machinations of his nobility, in conſequence of his vigorous meaſures, James reſolved upon a war with England: a ſtep to which he might alſo have been induced by his treaties with France, now completed by the marriage of the dauphin and Margaret. He ſummoned the whole array of his kingdom, computed at nearly two hundred thouſand men, mounted on ſmall horſes, but not entitled to the appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of cavalry, and yet a greater number of rude infantry, and looſe attendants on the army. With this unwieldy force he beſieged Roxburgh; <note place="margin">1 Aug.</note> and after waſting fifteen days, and almoſt all the miſſive arms of the kingdom, he was forced to abandon the ſiege, and return inglorious <note n="9" place="bottom">Bowar, 502. He eſtimates the force at 400,000! But "inglorii remea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt." The affair is ſingular, and rather obſcure. Harding, c. 229, 230, ſays that the connexion of James with Burgundy led him to this invaſion, and that he fled on Northumberland's advancing with 80,000 men. The nobles pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably ſhewed their diſcontent by diſſenſion, as in the reigns of James III, and V. Burgundy had abandoned the Engliſh intereſt in 1435, and James was in ſtrict alliance with him.</note>. Such is the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of our monaſtic hiſtorian, whoſe conſtant warmth in the praiſe of James, juſtifies his candour. Latter writers, upon no authority, ſay that the king diſmiſſed his army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he heard of a conſpiracy, which would have been the beſt reaſon for retaining it. The real cauſe ſeems to have been that James found that he was conſuming his own king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by ſo numerous an hoſt, and could not diſmiſs a part, without an affront; or that the ſpirit of the nobles, ſhewn under his ſucceſſors, began to operate in a contempt of the regal authority, and in the ſacrifice of their country to their reſentments.</p>
               <p>The laſt parliament of James I met at Edinbugh. <note place="margin">22 Oct.</note> It was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed that jurymen ſhould ſwear that they had received no bribes:
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0141700201:148"/>that treſpaſſors may be accuſed at the king's inſtance, though no private proſecutor appear: that, to ſecure the importation of bullion, merchants ſhould bring three ounces of bullion for every ſack of wool exported, and a ſimilar rate for hydes, and Hamburgh barrels: that no perſons be permitted to remain in taverns after nine o'clock at night: that no Engliſh goods be brought into Scotland, and that no Engliſh man import ſuch except by ſpecial permiſſion: that no Scotiſhman ſell ſalmon to the Engliſh, except the latter have ſafe conduct and pay Engliſh gold: that no Scotiſhman buy wine of certain Flemings in Scotland: that no perſon be permitted to remove gold, ſilver, or jewels, out of Scotland <note n="1" place="bottom">Acts, f. 24, 25.</note>. The commercial regulations ſeem more calculated to fetter, than to encourage, trade; but it was long before the real ſpirit of commerce was underſtood, even in more enlightened countries.</p>
               <p>The cruel terminating ſcene of the life of James approaches. <note place="margin">1437</note> A very minute, and intereſting, account of this melancholy tranſaction is contained in a manuſcript of the period, hitherto unknown to our hiſtorians, and which ſhall be here followed <note n="2" place="bottom">This memoir is printed in the appendix, and is not only extremely curious and important in itſelf, but as it preſents a ſpecimen of the Engliſh language between the time of Chaucer and that of Forteſcue.</note>; and it is hoped that the ſingularity, and importance, of the ſcene will afford a ſufficient excuſe for a degree of prolixity.</p>
               <p>Sir Robert Graham uncle of the earl of Strathern, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of Menteith, had been impriſoned in 1425, as is above mentioned, but the cauſe is unknown. Two years afterwards James had reſumed the earldom of Strathern, upon pretext, as ſeems, that it was confined to heirs male; and had given it to his uncle Walter earl of Athole for his life: aſſigning, in recompence, that of Menteith to Malis Graham, the former
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0141700201:149"/>earl of Strathern <note n="3" place="bottom">See the Sutherland Caſe by Sir D. Dalrymple, ch. v. p. 56, 57, from the original charters.</note>. Robert Graham may have been diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented at this exchange of his nephew's dignity; but it is not eaſy to conceive that his wrath upon this account could have excited him to the murder of his ſovereign, and far leſs that he could have wiſhed to ſerve the ambition of Athole, to whom his nephew's former earldom had paſſed. The art of this man ſeems to have equalled his audacity; and he muſt have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigated Athole, now approaching, if not exceeding, his ſeventieth year <note n="4" place="bottom">Walter earl of Athole and Strathern, the ſecond ſon of Robert II by Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemia Roſs, muſt have been born about 1367 at the lateſt.</note>, to this conſpiracy by ambitious views, only fit to captivate the dotage of age, or inexperience of youth, and inſpired by Graham ſolely to promote his own deſperate revenge. This idea is favoured by the following narration, which alſo explains the violent cauſes which inflamed this aſſaſſin: but it would be neither a matter of paradox, nor blame, to infer that Athole, and his family, were really innocent; and that they were accuſed by Graham to gratify his animoſity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Athole held his nephew's eſtates and dignity. It ſhall only be further premiſed that Sir Robert Stuart, grandſon of Athole, on whom the conſpirators pretended to beſtow the crown, was the ſon of David, eldeſt ſon of that earl, left an hoſtage in England for James, ever ſince his arrival in his kingdom; and who apparently died there either before this period, or ſoon after.</p>
               <p>According to this ancient relation, James had diſcontented his nobles by his vigorous procedure againſt them; and they aſſerted that his avarice of confiſcated eſtates, and not his juſtice, induced him to ſuch actions. The people were alſo diſpleaſed becauſe of the ſubſidies impoſed, to which they had
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0141700201:150"/>long been ſtrangers; and were even inclined to pronounce his government tyrannic. In this poſture of affairs, and probably in the year 1434, after March had been confined, and his eſtates ſeized, Sir Robert Graham, now delivered from his firſt impriſonment, and irritated by that diſgrace, propoſed, in a meeting of the lords and chief men, that he would repreſent their grievances to the king, if they would ſupport him. As he was eloquent, and verſed in the laws, they willingly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented. Accordingly, in the next parliament, or that held for the forfeiture of March in January 1435, Graham's violence led him to exceed his commiſſion; for he roſe with an enraged countenance, and approaching the royal ſeat, laid his hand on the king, ſaying, "I arreſt you in the name of all the three eſtates of your realm, here aſſembled in parliament; for, as your people have ſworn to obey you, ſo are you conſtrained by an equal oath to govern by law, and not to wrong your ſubjects, but in juſtice to maintain and defend them." Then turning around, he exclaimed, "Is it not thus as I ſay?" But the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, ſtruck with conſternation at Graham's raſhneſs, remained in profound ſilence: and the king inſtantly ordered the auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious cenſor to priſon, to which he was conveyed, after a ſevere ſarcaſm on the meanneſs of ſpirit, ſhewn by thoſe who had promiſed to ſupport him. Soon after Graham was ordered into baniſhment; and all his poſſeſſions forfeited to the king.</p>
               <p>The bold and gloomy exile retired into the furtheſt high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, meditating revenge: and he had even the audacity formally to renounce his allegiance, and to ſend a defiance to the king in writing, aſſerting that James had ruined him, his wife, and children, and poſſeſſions, by his cruel tyranny; and that he ſhould kill his ſovereign with his own hand, if occaſion offered. Upon this a proclamation was made, promiſing three thouſand demies of gold, each worth half an Engliſh noble,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0141700201:151"/>to any perſon who ſhould bring in Graham dead or alive. Meantime that ardent ſpirit was employed in digeſting his ſcheme, and he ſent meſſages to ſeveral of the members of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, during its ſeſſion in October 1436, offering to aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinate the king, and beſtow the crown on Sir Robert Stuart, Athole's grandſon, nephew and favorite of James.</p>
               <p>The court held the feſtival of Chriſtmas at Perth; and the contemporary narrative details ſome popular ſtories concerning omens, which happened to James. The worſt omen was his vigorous adminiſtration, which had created many enemies; among whom the conſpiracy ſpread, like a fire among com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible materials, and had even reached the moſt intimate attendants of the palace, without exciting any ſuſpicion. Thrice did Chriſtopher Chambers, one of the traitors, and who had been a ſquire of the duke of Albany, approach the royal preſence, to diſcloſe the plot; and as often did he fail, from accident, or from a miſtaken ſenſe of honour, or pity to his aſſociates.</p>
               <p>At length the conſpiracy being fully ripened, <note place="margin">20 Feb.</note> a night was fixed for its execution; being that of the ſecond wedneſday in lent, according to Monſtrelet, or the twenty ſeventh day of February in the year one thouſand four hundred and thirty-ſeven; but that of the firſt wedneſday in lent, between the twentieth and twenty firſt day of that month, by the account of Bowar, which deſerves the preference <note n="5" place="bottom">Monſtrelet, II, f. 98, edit. 1518; Bowar, 503. In 1437 lent began on the 17th Feb. In 1438 on the 2d March. Another argument, if neceſſary, to enforce the learned Ruddiman's reply to Abercromby, who, with his uſual igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of chronology, dates this event in 1438. The chartulary of Glaſgow, Harl. 4631, has "Obitus Jacobi primi Regis Scotorum, vigeſimo die Februarii, A. D. Milleſimo Quadringenteſimo, Trigeſimo Sexto." The chronicle at the end of Winton erroneouſly bears, <hi>faſtrens ene,</hi> or ſhrove-tueſday.</note>. The earl of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0141700201:152"/>Athole, and Sir Robert Stuart, were at the court that evening, which was paſſed before ſupper, and after to a late hour, in the amuſements of the time, in playing at cheſs and tables, reading romances, ſinging and muſic. An Iriſh or highland woman, pretending to magic, who had long before given the king a hint of the plot, and had only met with laughter, again came to unfold it; but was referred till the morrow, as the king was buſy at play. An hour after, James called for the parting cup; and he and the company drank, and withdrew. Sir Robert Stuart, private chamberlain to the king, and his chief favourite, is accuſed of ſpoiling the locks of the royal chambers, to prevent their being ſhut, and even of laying boards acroſs a deep ditch, that environed the garden of the Dominican monaſtery at Perth, where James was now lodged, in order to enable the conſpirators to paſs: but theſe offices ſeem to belong to meaner aſſociates, and the guilt of Athole and his grandſon is doubtful. After midnight, Graham with about three hundred perſons, moſtly raiſed in the highlands as may be inferred, entered the garden. The king was now in his bed-chamber, ſtanding before the fire, only dreſſed in his night-gown, and converſing gayly with the queen and her ladies, when, juſt as he threw off his night-gown to go to bed, he heard a great noiſe, as of men in armour, crouding and claſhing together, and perceived a blaze of torches. Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions of treaſon inſtantly ariſing, the queen and ladies ran to the chamber-door, but could not faſten it, the locks being ſpoiled: and the king requeſting them, if poſſible, to keep the door ſhut, attempted to eſcape by the windows, but found them cloſely barred with iron. Perceiving no other refuge, he with the fire-tongs and an exertion of ſtrength, tore up a board of the chamber-floor, and letting himſelf down dropped the board above him. He was now in one of theſe incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0141700201:153"/>neceſſaries, uſual in old edifices; but ſtill could not eſcape outward, for, by a ſad fatality, a ſquare aperture in the place had been filled with ſtone, only three days before, by the king's command, becauſe the balls were apt to enter it, when he played at tennis. Nevertheleſs he might here have remained ſafe, had not his own impatience betrayed him.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile the traitors burſt open the chamber-door, and ſeveral of the ladies were hurt; particularly, as our hiſtorians ſay, Catherine Douglas, who, with a ſpirit worthy of her name, had her arm broken, by thruſting it into the ſtaple inſtead of a bar. The ladies ſhrieking with horror, fled to the furtheſt corner of the room; but the queen was ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely agitated that ſhe ſtood without power of ſpeech, or motion, and a villain baſely wounded, and would have ſlain, her, had not a ſon of Graham interfered, ſaying, "What will will you do, for ſhame of yourſelf, to the queen? She is but a woman. Let us go and ſeek the king." The queen was then permitted to withdraw; while the ladies remained loſt in tears and conſternation.</p>
               <p>The traitors ſought the king in every part of the chamber, and another adjoining, without ſucceſs. Moſt of them had gone to extend their ſearch, and a temporary quiet ſucceeded, when the king moſt unhappily, after having heard no noiſe for ſome time, and thinking that the conſpirators were gone, called to the ladies to bring ſheets, and draw him up from his uncomfortable concealment. In the attempt Elizabeth Douglas fell down into the place, and Chambers, one of the aſſaſſins, entering with a torch, perceived the king and the lady, and called to his fellows, with ſavage merriment; "Sirs, the bride is found, for whom we have ſought, and caroled all night." Upon this, another traitor, Sir John Hall, leaped down with a dagger in his hand; but the king ſeized him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0141700201:154"/>and threw him under his feet. Hall's brother met with the ſame chance: yet the king in vain tried to wreſt a dagger from either, and only wounded his hands, and rendered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf incapable of further defence. Graham himſelf now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the king's retreat, who requeſted his mercy; but Graham exclaimed, "Thou cruel tyrant, thou never hadſt mercy upon thy noble kindred, nor others, ſo expect none." James ſaid, "I beſeech thee that, for my ſoul's ſalvation, thou wilt let me have a confeſſor." But Graham retorted, "Thou ſhalt have no confeſſor but this ſword;" and ſtabbed the king, who in vain cried for mercy, and offered half his kingdom for his life. The aſſaſſin, ſomewhat relenting, was about to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, when his comrades above deſired him to complete their intention, elſe he ſhould himſelf encounter death at their hands. Graham, and the two Halls, then accompliſhed the horrid deed by multiplied wounds.</p>
               <p>Thus periſhed James I in the forty-fourth year of his age, and the thirty-firſt of his nominal reign, but only the thirteenth of his active authority.</p>
               <p>Not ſatiated with the murder of their monarch, the aſſaſſins ſought the queen, fearing her revenge; but ſhe had now eſcaped. The rumour at length reaching the outer court, where the ſervants were lodged, and thence the town itſelf, numbers approached with arms and torches, upon which the conſpirators haſtily withdrew. Sir David Dunbar, arriving alone, attacked them, ſlew one, and wounded another, but was overpowered and left diſabled. Straiton, a page, was ſlain: and the band made good their retreat to the highlands, only regreting that the queen had been ſaved, whoſe vengeance they dreaded. Nor without cauſe; for, in leſs than a month, all the chief actors were in jail.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:0141700201:155"/>The firſt taken were Sir Robert Stuart, and Chriſtopher Chambers: who were executed with cruel tortures at Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, and the former's confeſſion of guilt may have been forced from his pangs. Athole was taken by Angus, tried and condemned; <note place="margin">31 Mar.</note> but Eaſter approaching, the croſs, upon which his grandſon had been tormented, was taken down, as unbecoming that ſolemnity; and he was faſtened to a pillar, with a paper crown upon his head, thrice inſcribed with the term Traitor. Antony biſhop of Urbino, the papal legate in Scotland, heard the confeſſions of Stuart, and Athole <note n="6" place="bottom">Eneas Sylvius is ſubſtituted for the biſhop of Urbino by Hector Boyce, the grandfather of all our hiſtorical errors; and the miſtake is religiouſly maintained by all our hiſtorians. Eneas Sylvius, afterwards pope Pius II, viſited Scotland before the duke of Burgundy left the Engliſh party in Aug. 1435. Comment. p. 4. And in the year that Alfonſo of Arragon was captured by the Genoeſe—1435: ib. He returned in the ſame year to France: and in 1436 another legate was ſent, namely Antony de Santo Vito, biſhop of Urbino. Ughelli Italia Sacra, (Venice 1717, 10 vols. folio) II, 792. His paſſport occurs in Rymer, X, 660, and is dated 22 Nov. 1436. Ughelli's account runs thus: "Sexto autem Idus Quintilis proxime inſequentis, [1436,] pro reſtituenda eccleſiaſtica diſciplina, aliiſque longe graviſſimis componendis rebus, in Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam, ad Jacobum regem, cum ampliſſima decernendi poteſtate ab eodem pontifice [Eugenio IV] legatus eſt. Difficillimis Scotiae rebus inopinato Jacobi regis nece magis magiſque perturbatis, ad Anglorum regem, &amp;c. dirigitur." Antony de Santo Vito proceeded to the council of Baſil on his return; and was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards diſtinguiſhed by his embaſſies to Germany, France, and Spain.
<p>In narrating the murder of James I, Jean Chartier, p. 95, ſays that the perpetrators were chiefly ſervants of Albany, and other lords ſlain by James, who was a brave and juſt prince, and well beloved by his people.</p>
                  </note>. The latter aſſerted his innocence; but ſaid that his grandſon had propoſed the conſpiracy, from which he had diſſuaded him, and underſtood that he had ſucceeded. It might be ſaid that Stuart having been forced by torture to confeſs guilt, Athole was of courſe obliged to accord with his grandſon's teſtimony;
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0141700201:156"/>for it is difficult to conceive that Stuart could have been guilty of ſuch black ingratitude to his beneficent ſovereign, and of ſuch a total ſacrifice of common prudence, as to engage in this conſpiracy, from which to expect the diadem muſt have been the infatuation of frenzy. But Graham's art may have practiſed upon his youth, and weakneſs, to this degree; and the evidence of his guilt at laſt rather preponderates. As to Athole, his hoary head might well have been ſaved: the laws concerning miſpriſion of treaſon are moſt ſevere, calling for a ſacrifice of kindred, of friendſhip, and of human nature: his grandſon's ſcheme he ſeems to have regarded as too wild for any man of common underſtanding to attempt; and was he, for what he expected to paſs as idle diſcourſe, to proclaim his grandſon a madman, or a traitor, and to ruin his poſterity? But to leave this diſcuſſion, the aged earl was beheaded at Edinburgh; and his head was fixed upon a ſpear, encircled with a crown of iron.</p>
               <p>Graham, and many others of the traitors, were tortured, and put to death, at Stirling. The daring chief of the aſſaſſins had the inſolence to plead that, having renounced his allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance under his hand and ſeal, he had a right to kill the king, as his mortal enemy: nay he addreſſed his judges, and the ſpectators, aſſuring them that they ſhould ſoon pray for his ſoul, as one to whom they were indebted for their deliverance from a tyrant. Nor was his courage leſs than his dark fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm of vengeance, as appeared from the ſpirit with which he bore his horrid torments. Some of the aſſociates aſſerted that they knew not even the nature of the conſpiracy, but had been prevailed on to join the party, upon pretence that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was only to carry off a young lady of the court, whom Sir Robert Stuart was to marry: a circumſtance apparently alluded to in the expreſſions of Chambers abovementioned.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0141700201:157"/>The ſon of Graham, Thomas Hall, and Chambers, are parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly mentioned among the victims; and the latter would expreſs no repentance for the king's death. This full and minute relation is given, not only as preſenting all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of an important event, but as it ſerves to correct ſome miſtakes of former writers.</p>
               <p>James left only one ſon, his ſucceſſor; but his female iſſue conſiſted of not leſs than five daughters; Margaret married to the Dauphin; Iſabel to Francis duke of Bretagne; Eleanor to Sigiſmund archduke of Auſtria; Mary to the count de Boucquan, ſon of the lord of Campvere; Jean to the earl of Angus, and afterwards to the earl of Morton <note n="7" place="bottom">Crawford Stuarts, 36. Stewarts Gen. 65. The marriage of Margaret is above narrated. For Iſabel, (and her portrait,) ſee Lobineau Hiſt. de Bretagne, I, 621. For Eleonora, De Roo Ann. Auſt. 399.
<p>Mary's deſtiny was more obſcure; but from Coucy, p. 574, ſhe appears to have been wedded before 1449; and her huſband was only a <hi>ſeigneur.</hi> Olivier de la Marche, the contemporary Burgundian, in his curious memoirs gives ſome notices concerning her. He ſays "Le ſeigneur de la Vere, un mout puiſſant et notable chevalier Zelandois, du nom et des armes de Bourſelle, et qui, par ſa grande conduite et renommée par la mer, avoit eu la fille du Roy d'Eſcoce, ſoeur germaine de Madame la Dauphine, dont cy-deſſus eſt faicte mention; et l'avoit mariée a ſon fils le Comte de Boucquam." p. 263, 264. And p. 332, ed. Gand, 1566, 410, he mentions that the counteſs of Boucquan (<hi>ſic</hi>) daughter of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land was delivered of a ſon at Vere in Zealand, and the count of Charolois, ſon of Burgundy, went to Vere on the occaſion. A. D. 1451. Jean is known in Scotiſh peerages. See the years 1453, 1457. It is ſuſpected that the princeſs Jean, wedded to Huntley about 1470, was a daughter of James II; perhaps of the queen of James I, by her ſecond marriage. Yet a genealogy of 1484, MS. Harl. 712, thus arranges the daughters: 1. Dauphineſs. 2. Ducheſs of Bretagne, 3. Johanna to Huntley. 4. Eleonora, Auſtria. 5. Maria <hi>domina</hi> Kamfer. 6. Annabella to Morton.</p>

                  <p>WHETHER education, <note place="margin">1371—</note> climate, or government, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce moſt effect on national character, is an impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant problem, diſcuſſed by many able writers, but hitherto not ſufficiently reſolved. It muſt however be granted by all, that each has its ſhare in exciting or depreſſing mental energy, in eſtabliſhing general induſtry or indolence, in promoting public happineſs or miſery. But of theſe grand cauſes education ſeems deſervedly to claim the preeminence. To deny the power of climate, would be to forget that man is "ſubject to the ſkyey influences;" yet his induſtry, or care, my gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0141700201:159"/>overcome or elude its effects: and ſoil is almoſt equally ſubſervient to labour. Government exerts a more pervading influence; even the peaſant in his cottage is oppreſſed by the burning heat of deſpotiſm, or the blaſting ſtorms of anarchy. The rewards of his labour ceaſe amid the general diſtreſs: the caprice of ſome little tyrant, for ſlaves are ever tyrants where they can, or the revenge of a foe, may aſſail his hovel; and while his family periſhes in penury, the labourer joins the mountain robbers, and falls the victim of thoſe laws which afforded him no protection. Even moderate governments affect domeſtic life, and individuals, more than is commonly conceived; a war, a tax, an unwiſe law, becomes an univerſal misfortune; while the benignity, and ſkill, of the rulers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the happineſs of all. The influence, like that of the electric element, is rarely unveiled to the popular eye, though the ſubtile fluid operate moſt widely on the public health.</p>
                  <p>In the oriental legiſlations the connexion between laws and manners is often indiſſoluble: and the laws become perpetual, by being grafted on the habits of that creature of habit, man. In Europe, on the contrary, the laws and manners are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbially diſtinct. Juriſdiction puniſhes crimes, but rewards not virtues; far leſs can it improve domeſtic morals, or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the light of inſtruction over a benighted nation. Theſe are the ſacred provinces of education, a cauſe of national cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter more prevalent than either of the former, as it ſtrikes the very root of offence, and ſows laſting ſeeds of intelligence and worth.</p>
                  <p>But education, on the extenſive ſcale here implied, remains an experiment even to the moſt civilized nations; and its effects muſt neither be regarded as ſpeedy, nor infinite. Even infants diſplay, ſome a perverſe, others a placid diſpoſition: and it is doubtful whether any care or art can eradicate, or
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0141700201:160"/>ſubdue, the inborn temper. If the bad habits of an individual prove often unconquerable by reaſon or virtue, how deeply muſt ſuch habits be rooted in a whole people, where example operates like a contagion?</p>
                  <p>Hence it is that the ſpirit, and manners, of the people ought to preſent the main object of political diſcuſſion on any particular ſtate, and the more eſpecially where government and education have little force. In whatever form of adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, only a part can ſhine upon the public theatre, and thus attract the notice of hiſtory. The maſs of the nation remains in obſcurity, even in enlightened ages; and philoſophy can only eſtimate its hiſtory by that of its manners, for which the beſt materials are to be found, not in the pages of the annaliſt, but in poems, novels, and romances. Barren however as are the annals of the poor, their ſtate may always be juſtly eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by that of the actors, who vaunt and vaniſh in the hiſtoric ſcene; and from the progreſs of nations, as ſavage, barbarous, or civilized. The monkiſh page preſents but a ſmall pulſe, yet from it the health, or ſickneſs, of the whole body may be gathered with conſiderable certainty.</p>
                  <p>In Scotland, at the period now under review, the people were ſlowly advancing from barbariſm towards civilization. A peace of ſome duration had taken place before the acceſſion of the houſe of Stuart; and the conſequent intercourſe with England, a country then rapidly progreſſive in the arts of life, muſt have increaſed the national energy. Yet the feudal ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters continued to be firmly rivetted: every man was the ſoldier, or the menial attendant of his chief; and flocks, herds, agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture afforded only ſubſervient occupations. While the ſingle ſcience of the great was war, their ſole amuſement hunting, their chief magnificence a numerous train, it is no wonder that the poor were ferocious and idle, ſecure during health of a main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0141700201:161"/>from their lords, and in ſickneſs of monaſtic charity. Courage honeſty, frankneſs, attachment to their chiefs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted the chief virtues of the peaſantry; temperance, and ſobriety were the virtues of the ſoil: ſpirituous liquors, that bane of the poor, were as yet unknown in Europe, except among the ſtores of the phyſician. Nor had religious fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm, that unintermitting intoxication, yet poiſoned the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar mind with habitual gloom: the poor chiefly knew the chriſtian religion from its charity, from the public exhortations of the preaching friars, and from the gay exhibitions of the Roman catholic ſyſtem.</p>
                  <p>By more poliſhed foreigners Scotland continued to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded as a country completely barbarous. The author of the Dittamundi allows that it is rich in fiſh, fleſh, and milk, but,</p>

                  <p>The long and ſevere ordinances of Robert II againſt mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, and their receivers and ſupporters, afford a proof that this charge was not unfounded <note n="2" place="bottom">Stat. Rob. II, apud Skene.</note>. And the orders to the army, not to pillage their own countrymen, preſent another inſtance
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0141700201:162"/>of barbaric manners <note n="3" place="bottom">Reg. 4to, f. v. 72.</note>. The <hi>Ketherani,</hi> Kerns, or marauding highlanders, by continual inroads into the low countries greatly obſtructed the progreſs of induſtry and civilization; and this inteſtine evil, more pernicious than foreign invaſion, continued to a late period. Strangers to that induſtry which excites the Swiſs peaſant to cultivate the precipice, and the Norwegian to derive that ſupport from the ſea which the land refuſes, the highlanders ſupplied their wants by rapine: and the civil ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity was increaſed by the difference of origin, language, and manners; ſo that the difficulties with which the government had to ſtruggle, and the obſtacles againſt order, were perhaps greater in Scotland than in any other European kingdom. The example of Henry II of England, who planted a Flemiſh colony in Wales, eſcaped the obſervation, or exceeded the power, of our monarchs: and the complete tranſpoſition of the population of a province, though an expedient far from unknown to the Perſians, Greeks, and Romans, appears to ſurpaſs the wiſdom, or the enterprize of any later government.</p>
                  <p>Though the peaſantry were in fact the ſlaves of their lords, by menial or by feudal bondage, yet few inſtances occur of abſolute villanage; and it is believed no example appears in our records, of an eſtate ſold with the farmers, labourers, and families, attached to the ſoil <note n="4" place="bottom">Niſbet in his Heraldry, Vol. I, p. 131, gives an extract of a charter of Robert I, regni 14, from the chartulary of Dunfermlin, declaring Adam Adamſon and his four ſons free: "declaratum eſt quod Adamus filius Adami non eſt homo noſter ligius, ſeu nativus, quin pro voluntate ſua;" and he and ſons were delivered "ab omni jugo et onere ſervitutis;" executed "coram juſticiario noſtro."</note>. The appellation <hi>huſbond,</hi> given to the Scotiſh farmers, ſeems indeed to imply that they were conſidered as bond ſlaves of their lord's houſe, or as fixed
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0141700201:163"/>to their own particular farm-houſes; yet what little evidence remains teaches us to conſider them rather as ſlaves in cuſtom, than in law. The <hi>huſband lands,</hi> or farms, were divided into tillage and paſturage, were always ſmall, and the farmers of courſe poor <note n="5" place="bottom">Skene de ſign. verb. voce <hi>Huſband-land,</hi> originally about ſix acres.</note>. The cotter who rears his hovel of turf and ſtraw, under an old thorn, and cultivates three or four acres of the common, would in theſe ages have been ſtyled a farmer. Large farms undoubtedly advance agriculture; and perhaps the numerous labourers employed are as uſeful and valuable members of ſociety, as if each farmed a ſmall portion of land.</p>
                  <p>With the acceſſion of the houſe of Stuart, a ſtronger light begins to ariſe on the internal ſtate of Scotland. Barbour wrote his celebrated poem in 1375; and in narrating the actions of Robert I, he preſents many pictures of the times and manners, the lapſe of half a century being imperceptible in the ſlow progreſs of civilization. But the curioſity of Froiſſart a ſtranger has preſerved the ſtrongeſt features; and his viſit to Scotland forms an epoch in the hiſtory of national manners <note n="6" place="bottom">Froiſſart was in England in 1391, Tome IV, fol. 14. He was at Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keith in his youth, about the year 1360, T. III, f. 117: and no other viſit of his to Scotland is known. It is not therefore wonderful that, when he wrote his hiſtory in 1400, his memory made ſome ſlips, particularly the ſtrange one concerning the houſe of Douglas, which miſled lord Hailes, Remarks, p. 121. Froiſſart confounds the earls of Douglas with the Douglaſes lords of Dalkeith; nay he aſſigns to that name the arms of the earls of Moray, "d'or a trois oreilles de gueulles!" His more recent information was derived from the French knights who viſited Scotland.</note>. From his account it appears that the French, themſelves regarded by the Italians as barbarians, ſhuddered at the penury and barbarity of Scotland. Even in the <hi>Doulce Eſcoche</hi> or low lands, (for the highlanders of <hi>la Sauvage Eſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che</hi> were conſidered as we now do American ſavages,) a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0141700201:164"/>ignorance prevailed of the commoneſt arts of life. The meaneſt articles of manufacture, horſe-ſhoes, harneſs, ſaddles, bridles, were all imported ready made from Flanders. The houſes of the common people were compoſed of four or five poſts to ſupport the turf walls, and a roof of boughs: three days ſufficed to erect the humble manſion <note n="7" place="bottom">Froiſſart, Tome II, f. 170, edit. 1518, 4to.</note>.

                  <p>The Engliſh education of James I contributed to the civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lization of his kingdom. Yet even in his reign the picture by Enea Silvio, afterwards pope Pius II, is far from flattering. "Concerning Scotland he found theſe things worthy of repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition. It is an <hi>iſland joined</hi> to England, ſtretching two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles to the north, and about fifty broad; a cold country, fertile of few ſorts of grain, and generally void of trees, but there is a ſulphureous ſtone dug up which is uſed for firing. The towns are unwalled, the houſes commonly built without lime, and in villages roofed with turf, while a cow's hide ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the place of a door. The commonalty are poor and uneducated, have abundance of fleſh and fiſh, but eat bread as a dainty. The men are ſmall in ſtature, but bold; the women fair and comely, and prone to the pleaſures of love; kiſſes being there eſteemed of leſs conſequence than preſſing the hand is in Italy. The wine is all imported; the horſes are moſtly ſmall ambling nags, only a few being preſerved entire for propagation, and neither curry-combs nor reins are uſed. The oyſters are larger than in England. From Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land are imported into Flanders hides, wool, ſalt fiſh, and
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0141700201:165"/>pearls. Nothing gives the Scots more pleaſure than to hear the Engliſh diſpraiſed. The country is divided into two parts, the cultivated lowlands, and the region where agriculture is not uſed.

                  <p>The vigorous adminiſtration of James I imparted tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and happineſs to the people; and was often regretted by them during the diſtractions of the ſubſequent reigns <note n="3" place="bottom">See Bowar, 510</note>. Till this period the ſtatutes were concealed from the nation in the darkneſs of the latin language; the good ſenſe of this monarch ordered them to be iſſued in the Scotiſh tongue, while in England the laws were to be dictated in Latin and French till the reign of Richard III. Thus religion, and law, the ſole
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0141700201:166"/>rules of popular conduct, were veiled from the people; but there is no abſurdity which man has not reduced to practice. The ſtatures of James are wiſely ordained to advance civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation, and the ſanguine theoriſt may exult in their effects; but they rather proclaim the intelligence of the monarch, and of his eccleſiaſtic miniſters, than the national advancement. Ordinances prepared in the cabinet by wiſe and good men, were paſſed by the lords of the articles; while the peers and landholders, with whom the juriſdiction lay, either did not attend, or voted with a ſmile. And the frequent repetition of the ſame laws, even ſo late as the reigns of James IV an V, conſpires with the records of hiſtory to convince us, that the ſtatutes rather indicate the evils that did exiſt, than the remedy of theſe evils. The roots of national habits are too deep to be affected by the thunder of laws, the ſlow divul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of education can alone explode them.</p>
                  <p>Among the ſtatures of the firſt James, the following are the moſt pertinent to the preſent diſcuſſion. That no private wars be allowed; that none travel with more attendants than they maintain; that no <hi>ſornars</hi> ſhall force their reſidence upon the clergy or farmers; that in burghs, and no high ways, inns be erected; and that no beggars be permitted, except diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by a badge importing the leave of the magiſtrates: and the hoſpitals for the poor and ſick are ordered to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. A remarkable law ordains, that all idle perſons, without means of livelihood, ſhall be impriſoned, till they give ſecurity, and ſhall within forty days betake themſelves to ſome ſervice or craft. The trial of the cauſes of the poor is declared to be gratuitous <note n="4" place="bottom">Acts, f. 1, 2, 5, 7, 8.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The inſtitution of inns, repeatedly enforced, was perhaps calculated to ſave the monaſteries from the frequent intruſion
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0141700201:167"/>of numerous gueſts; but the neceſſity of ſuch laws indicates a radical defect in civilization. The firſt object of the Romans, after the conqueſt of a barbaric country, was to open high ways through it; for on mutual and eaſy intercourſe all civilization depends. Yet this firſt and indiſpenſable ſtep is unknown in our ſtatutes. Some regulations appear concerning ferries; but till within theſe fifty years the roads in Scotland were hardly paſſable. And while the Swiſs cuts his way through the Alps, our mole hills in the highlands preſent inſuperable barriers. The civilization of a country is always in exact proportion to the number, and condition, of its high ways. The omiſſion of this one law was radical, and obſtructed all the others <note n="5" place="bottom">The firſt Scotiſh ſtatute concerning highways, is of the reign of Charles II, 1661, cap. 38.</note>.</p>
                  <p>In the burghs a greater degree of civilization muſt have prevailed than in the country; but the inhabitants of the burghs were few, compared with the general population. Froiſſart eſtimates the houſes in Edinburgh, then the capital, at four thouſand <note n="6" place="bottom">Tome II, f. v. 169.</note>; they were ſmall wooden cottages, covered with ſtraw; for modern Edinburgh, with its houſes of ten or twelve ſtories, cannot date higher than Mary's reign, when all the French cuſtoms of Scotland really commenced. By a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon calculation the inhabitants of the capital, in the reign of Robert II, hardly exceeded ſixteen thouſand.</p>
                  <p>For ſome unknown cauſe, James I prohibited the election of deacons of crafts; perhaps they abuſed their power in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing ſedition; perhaps the genuine ſpirit of a corporation began to operate in monopoly, and oppreſſion. But a warden and council are ordered to regulate prices, the warden to be choſen by the council of the burgh, and not, as the deacons, by the craftſmen themſelves. Maſons, carpenters, ſmiths,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0141700201:168"/>taylors, weavers, are the only trades mentioned in the ſtatute <note n="7" place="bottom">Acts, f. 14, 18.</note>. The inſtitution of corporations by patent ſeems unknown in Scotland, till the reign of James IV: the crafts embodied and regulated themſelves; and the attention of government was hardly diverted to them, except to prevent impoſition. They would have charged for holidays, and undertaken more work than they could accompliſh, while one craftſman would refuſe the work neglected by another <note n="8" place="bottom">Ib. 14. <hi>Confrairies</hi> firſt appear in France about 1264.

                  <p>James I has himſelf delineated the manners of the common people, in his poem called Peblis to the Play. This <hi>play</hi> was probably an annual feſtival, in honour of the ſaint to whom the church was dedicated, or on ſome other occaſion; and ſuch <hi>wakes</hi> are yet known in the north of England. The humour and jollity of the meeting end in tumult and uproar, but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play a very different character to the gloomy fanaticiſm of the two ſucceeding centuries. From this ſingular poem, among other articles of manners, we learn that the women wore kerchiefs and hoods, and tippets; the muſic aroſe from the bagpipe; the men ſometimes wore hats of birch-twigs inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven, the hat being any high covering of the head, while the bonnet was flat. A tavern, with fair table linen, and a regular ſcore on the wall, are introduced: the reckoning twopence halfpenny a piece, is collected in a wooden trencher. The <hi>cadger,</hi> or packman who carries fiſh, &amp;c. through the country, on his little horſe; the ſalmon dance, conſiſting in exertions
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0141700201:169"/>of high leaping; and other anecdotes of popular manners, diverſify the piece <note n="1" place="bottom">Select Scotiſh Ballads, Vol. II, p. 1.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The dreſs of the common people conſiſted chiefly of a doublet and cloke, and a kind of ſhort trowſe; the head was covered with a hat of baſket-work, or felt, or with a woolen bonnet; while the logs and feet remained bare <note n="2" place="bottom">A practice prevalent among the common people of England on this period. Even the feet of many of the Engliſh archers were bare in battle. St. Remy, p. 89.</note>. Shirts were hardly known even to the great. The female dreſs was a kerchief or a hood, and a tippet about the neck: the kirtle, or cloſe gown, was rarely accompanied either with the <hi>wylicot</hi> or under petticoat, or with the mantle; and the feet were naked.</p>
                  <p>As the ſtate of ſociety was rather paſtoral than agricultural, milk, and its various preparations, formed a chief article of food. Meat boiled with oatmeal, or fiſh, ſupplied more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn meals. Bread and vegetables were little uſed, a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to which it may perhaps be imputed that the leproſy was not uncommon. The chief fiſh was the ſalmon, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the capture of which many regulations occur in the acts of parliament, and which alſo formed a grand article in the Scotiſh exports.</p>

                  <p>THE government, and laws, of a country are ſo intimately connected with its hiſtory, when compoſed in a proper manner, and with philoſophic views, that little remains to be added on
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0141700201:170"/>theſe important topics, except to glean a few remarks, and preſent ſome general obſervations.</p>
                  <p>The policy concerning the highlands formed a chief object in the Scotiſh government. David II had excited the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to deſtroy each other, by beſtowing the eſtate of the ſlaughtered leader on his aſſaſſin, and by the reign of terror had eſtabliſhed tranquillity <note n="3" place="bottom">Fordun, II, 380.</note>. This cruel policy was aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by the houſe of Stuart. Robert II aſſigned the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands to the care of his ſon the earl of Carric, and other peers; who were impowered to call the chiefs before them, and concert means of juſtice <note n="4" place="bottom">Regiſter, f. v. 72.</note>. But this plan erred in the other extreme of mildneſs: and James I, after having been obliged ſo exempt the highlanders from the law of retribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe, as the ſtatute bears, they had been accuſtomed to rob and kill each other <note n="5" place="bottom">Acts, f. 8.</note>, was at length conſtrained, as we have ſeen, to have recourſe to ſeverity.</p>
                  <p>The reign of this prince revived the long dormant power of the laws, and the boldeſt of the peers dared not to oppoſe his mandates or meſſengers. "The people," adds the old hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriographers, "then ſat in the opulence of peace, ſecure from ravagers, elate in heart, and tranquil in mind; becauſe the monarch had wiſely expelled quarrels and rapine from the ſtate, had appeaſed diſcord, and reconciled enmity <note n="6" place="bottom">Bowar, 510.</note>." But the regal juriſdiction, though much confined by the feudal ſyſtem, was carried by James I to a height that proved fatal to himſelf.</p>
                  <p>It is unneceſſary to dwell on the feudal government, ſo ably diſcuſſed by numerous authors. A ſingular feature of it in Scotland was the freedom from taxes; and that at a period
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0141700201:171"/>when France was overwhelmed with them, and the blood of the poor, as uſual, was mingled with the wine of the rich <note n="7" place="bottom">In 1385 the taxes were ſo numerous in France that many emigrated. Des Urſins, p. 46.</note>. Another remarkable diſtinction from modern times was, that the royal authority was weakened in war, and increaſed in peace. The ſoldiers belonged to their chiefs, and not the ſovereign: but the execution of the laws was a prerogative of the latter.</p>
                  <p>An idea of the royal revenue may be formed from the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage contracts of our princes, the dower of the wife being eſtimated at one third of the whole. Robert II, and III, were married before the acceſſion of the family: and the avaricious conduct of the Engliſh court, in the marriage of James I, rendered any contract to this effect unneceſſary. But that of James II and Mary of Gelder is extant; and though the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence be ſomewhat excurſive it is ſufficiently in point <note n="8" place="bottom">MS. Harl. 4637, Vol. III, f. v. 6.</note>. The dower aſſigned is 10,000 crowns of gold; and theſe crowns, in a contemporary ſtatute, are eſtimated at ſix ſhillings and eight pence each, Scotiſh money <note n="9" place="bottom">Acts of 1451.</note>. Hence 10,000 gold crowns equalled 5000 marks Scotiſh money, and the royal revenue was 15,000 marks Scotiſh, or about 7,500 marks ſterling of that time; in weight about 14,000 pounds of ſilver, in efficacy about ſeventy thouſand pounds of modern currency. But the rapacity of ſtateſmen and favorites, and other cauſes which did not affect the eſtates of the ariſtocracy, conſiderably dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidated the revenue of the crown, and rendered it ſubject to fuch variations that fifty thouſand pounds may moſt ſafely be aſſumed as a medium. Perhaps the earls of Douglas poſſeſſed a revenue equal to two thirds of the royal; which however certainly more than doubled that of any other peer <note n="1" place="bottom">In the eſtimate of the revenues of the hoſtages for James I, (Rymer, X, 327, 333,) the higheſt are thoſe of Argyle and Dalkeith, 1500 marks ſterling. each. But that of Douglas muſt have been far larger. The 1500 marks might now equal 15,000 <hi>l.</hi>
                        <p>It muſt not be forgotten that the royal expences were almoſt wholly domeſtic, there being neither civil nor military lift, the officers of ſtate and adminiſtrators of law being only paid by perquiſites; and even embaſſies were defrayed by the members of parliament, or by the merchants. The revenue of Henry V of England was 55,714<hi>l.</hi> 10<hi>s.</hi> (Rymer, X, 113,) or about 550,000 modern pounds.</p>
                     </note>.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:0141700201:172"/>The revenue of the crown aroſe chiefly from its demeſnes, from the various feudal caſualties, ward, relief, marriage, eſcheat, forfeiture; from vacant biſhoprics, fines, preſents for grants; and from cuſtoms on merchandize. Its preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives appear to have been, 1. to ſummon the parliament, and propoſe laws, which ſeldom or never failed to paſs: 2. the adminiſtration of juſtice: 3. creation of honours and dignities: 4. command of the national array: 5. nomination to eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtic preferments. As the firſt of theſe prerogatives en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croached on the legiſlative power; ſo, on the other hand, the parliament regulated embaſſes and treaties, and ordered peace or war <note n="2" place="bottom">This important fact is evinced from many documents in this work. See particularly the reign of James V.</note>. The coinage of money belonged to the crown; but any alteration was regarded as unconſtitutional, if not ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by parliament.</p>
                  <p>Hence it appears that the revenues and power of the Scotiſh monarchs were in themſelves ſufficiently reſpectable; but the age of Robert II, the weakneſs of his ſucceſſor, the diſorders of the regencies, and above all the extreme avarice of the ariſtocracy, ever preying on the royal domains and revenue, were cauſes that greatly injured both the wealth and influence of the crown.</p>
                  <p>In paſſing to the national council, or parliament, the moſt ſtriking object is the number of eccleſiaſtics, which exceeded
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0141700201:173"/>that of the peers <note n="3" place="bottom">In the parliament at Cambuſkenneth, 1314, the number of abbots already amounted to 14, Scone, Kelſo, Arbroth, Holyrood, Lindoris, Newbottel, Caput, Paisley, Dunfermlin, Lincluden, Inchaffray, St. Colm, Deer, Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heart. The priors 5, Coldingham, Reſtenoth, St. Andrews, Pittenweem, Loch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leven. Add the biſhops 13, and the ſum is thirty-two.</note>. But till the days of Forman, and the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, prieſtly ambition ſeems to have been little known in Scotland; and the ſtatutes generally evince great wiſdom and patriotiſm in the legiſlative body. The members unhappily did not aſſemble in two chambers as in England; the burgeſſes were annihilated in preſence of the powerful ariſtocracy, who themſelves only ſkilled in arms left legiſlative diſcuſſion to the clergy. An oppoſition was ſcarce ever known in the Scotiſh parliament, becauſe its operations were previouſly ſettled by the well-known committees of lords of the articles, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the king, ſo that in fact the ſtatutes were preſented for its ſanction, not its diſcuſſion. Nay there is room to believe that an oppoſition in parliament was viewed in as treaſonable a light as oppoſition in the field; and that the minority only teſtified its diſſatisfaction by its nonappearance.</p>
                  <p>The adminiſtration of the laws was the chief difficulty; and the king and parliament often recommended this great object to the peers in their reſpective territories. During a minority the parliament alone had the power of nominating a regent and council <note n="4" place="bottom">See the reign of James V when the parliament declare that, by the king's demiſe, the power had <hi>devolved to the three eſtates</hi> who had appointed Albany regent. Yet the will of the deceaſed monarch was commonly reſpected; and the queens of James I, II, and IV, were acknowledged as regents for a time.</note>. At what preciſe period the king's privy council fucceeded the <hi>Aula Regis,</hi> or council of great officers of ſtate is dubious. It was much on the ſame model, being compoſed of the chancellor, chamberlain, treaſurer, privy ſeal, ſecretary, and a few other members. Its power during a minority was
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0141700201:174"/>great, but at other times entirely under the controul of the ſovereign, and hardly known in hiſtory. Far ſuperior was the fate of the privy council in Denmark and Sweden, where the members uſurped the chief power; and under the name of <hi>ſenates</hi> controuled the monarchs. The want of titular nobility in theſe countries was a radical cauſe of this ſingularity, for the prelates having no balance to their aſcendancy, and moſt of them being ſenators in virtue of their ſees, the landholders, burgeſſes, and peaſants, could not ſtruggle againſt ſo powerful an ariſtocracy. In Scotland, on the contrary, the biſhops and the church were a public benefit, as they balanced the power of the ferocious nobles, and ſupported the monarch and the laws. All inſtitutions depend on time and circumſtances; and the bane of one country may be the felicity of another.</p>
                  <p>Had our kings poſſeſſed the nomination of the adminiſtrators of juſtice, the ariſtocratic influence would have been conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably checked. But moſt of the legal officers enjoyed heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and indefeaſible right. Such were the ſheriffs, though eſteemed the king's peculiar officers; nay the peers were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hereditary ſheriffs in their own juriſdictions.</p>
                  <p>Even in burghs, the aldermen and baillies were more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently devoted to ſome neighbouring chief, than to the king.</p>
                  <p>Of the <hi>Mair</hi> and <hi>Serjands</hi> little is known. An act of James I ſeems to evince that the office of Mair and King's Serjand was ſynonymous; and it ſhews that the barons had alſo their ſerjands. The Mair was deſtinguiſhed by a red wand; the officer of regality by a ſimilar badge, red at one end and white at the other; while the baron ſerjand had a white wand, and he of the burgh a red. All bore horns to ſound occaſionally <note n="5" place="bottom">Acts, f. 17. Another ſtatute, f. v. 19, mentions Mairs of fee, or heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, of the ſheriffdom, or of part; and authoriſes them to have deputies, to execute arreſts and ſummonſes. It is ſuſpected that the <hi>Murmor</hi> of the eleventh century, (Enq. into Sc. hiſt. II, 319,) was the <hi>Mur</hi> MAR or great Mair of a province, a term ſynonymous to the ancient Earl. In the gloſſary of Ducange the word Mair or Major implies in numerous inſtances great authority. The office of Coroner ſeems to have confined to criminal caſes, that of Mair to civil. In the iſle of Man there were <hi>Moares</hi> for every <hi>ſheading,</hi> or diſtrict of three pariſhes: (Order of the Tinwald 1422, in Townley's Journal, White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haven 1791, II, 231, 232.) By one of thoſe ſingular changes which occur in ſociety, the ſheriff remains a moſt honourable office; and the Mair, formerly almoſt his equal, has dwindled into the bailiff.</note>. The terms Mair and Serjand have varied
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0141700201:175"/>more in ſignification than perhaps any others; even now a ſerjeant at law is a very remote office from a ſerjeant in the army; and a <hi>Maire</hi> of Paris from a Scotiſh Mair. In its pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive meaning the term Mair is, in various countries, of high dignity, but had now been degraded in Scotland from the magiſtrate to the meſſenger. The Mair and Serjeants were the heralds of the law; but their office was in thoſe times arduous, and honourable, and worthy of the attention of the legiſlature. Even theſe offices were often hereditary; and Skene mentions that in his time there were "Mairs of fee. <note n="6" place="bottom">De verb. ſign. voce <hi>Marus.</hi>
                     </note>."</p>
                  <p>The legal juriſdiction of the crown chiefly appeared in the <hi>Brief,</hi> or ſhort writ, iſſued from the chancery. Theſe brieves were of two kinds, one directed to the ſheriff, or the Mair or ſerjand meſſengers of the law, ordering the party to be cited; the other empowering the judge to try the cauſe <note n="7" place="bottom">Home Hiſt. Law Tracts p. 288.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The royal power, though eminent in times of peace, and uncircurnſcribed by any ſenate, was nevertheleſs balanced by that of the ariſtocracy; which during war, or minorities, even aſſumed the aſcendancy <note n="8" place="bottom">Coronation oaths are ſolemn trifles, and they appear unknown to our old annals. According to Niſbet, Her. II, 154, the clergy, peers, and commons, in order, aſked the new ſovereign if he were willing to accept the crown; which being put on his head, a biſhop cried God bleſs the king; another anſwered God bleſs the people, and the king; and again, God bleſs the king, and the people.</note>. The baron was in fact a king in
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0141700201:176"/>his own juriſdiction; and the operation of the laws was directed by his loyalty, or his diſſatisfaction. The former was hardly to be ſecured, except by a munificence which weakened the royal revenue, and power: this avaricious ſpirit of the nobility was encreaſed by the acceſſion of the houſe of Stuart, and the peculiar circumſtances which accompanied that event. A family, formerly their equal, aſcended the throne; there was no regal anceſtry, no foreign ſplendor, to command awe and obedience: and a dubious loyalty was only to be won by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions, or promiſes, fatal to the conſtitutional aſcendency of the crown. Age, weakneſs, regencies, conſpired to increaſe the wealth and preponderance of the ariſtocracy; and when James I regained his ſceptre; many an effort was required in order to replace its chief gems.</p>
                  <p>The few peers, their number hardly exceeding twenty, continued to be chiefly denominated from the counties into which Scotland was then divided <note n="9" place="bottom">The chief deviations were, that there never was an earl of <hi>Mearns,</hi> but Crawford ſupplied the place. <hi>Leven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yet the difference between a thane and baron is unknown; and ſome doubts ariſe that ignorance may have blended the Saxon Thane and the Iriſh <hi>Taniſt.</hi>
                     </note>. The military force of the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0141700201:177"/>ſhire, and the greater part of its civil juriſdiction, were in the hands of theſe potentates; and the inferior barons were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to them by tenure, by clan, by intereſt and expectation, or by bonds of manrent.</p>
                  <p>The progreſs of government, legiſlation, and the uſeful arts and ſciences, ought to occupy moſt attention in hiſtory; but theſe pacific objects yield to wars and revolutions. War un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily forms the grand baſis of the annals of man; and one battle often produces the happineſs or miſery of many millions, for many centuries. Hence the ancient claſſical hiſtorians are ample in deſcribing the tactics of various nations; while modern writers ſeem to vie with thoſe of the middle ages in their negligence of this important theme, which, form its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite conſequences, deſerves to be arranged in the ſame claſs with the government and laws of a country.</p>
                  <p>It is well known that the chief weapon of the Scots was the ſpear, often ineffectual againſt the Engliſh long-bow, becauſe it was not accompanied, as in the Macedonian phalanx, with ſtrong defenſive armour. The buckler in particular ſeems to have been ſmall and weak, being only of wicker work covered with leather; the <hi>ſallad</hi> or iron cap, and the <hi>doublet of fence,</hi> muſt have afforded little protection againſt the Engliſh arrows, which like the Parthian even pierced the mail of the knight. Other offenſive weapons were the <hi>brogged ſtaff</hi> or pike, the axe, the ſword, the knife or dagger <note n="1" place="bottom">Winton MS. 842, 868. Acts, f. v. 8, f. 21.</note>. Such were the arms of the common people: but the chiefs, knights, and ſquires, were arrayed in plate-armour which had now ſucceeded the habergeon, or coat of ſmall inwoven rings; and they wielded the battle-axe, the two handed ſword, the iron mace, or the ſpear. Perſons worth ten pounds of yearly rent, or fifty
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0141700201:178"/>pounds in goods, were ordered to have a <hi>hat</hi> or helmet, and gorget; a peſan braced before and behind, with plates to cover the front or the thighs and legs, and gauntlets. The yeomen worth twenty pounds in effects, were to have the habergeon, iron hat, bow, quiver, ſword, buckler, knife; and, if not archers, an axe, or a pike. The burgeſs worth fifty pounds in goods, was to arm completely as a gentleman; while he who poſſeſſed not above twenty, appeared in the array of the yeoman <note n="2" place="bottom">Acts, f. 21.</note>.</p>
                  <p>James I was particularly anxious to eſtabliſh the uſe of the bow, and ordered frequent aſſemblies near the pariſh churches for the exerciſe of archery: but after his death the national habits prevailed, and among a hundred attendants of a baron, hardly ſix archers could be found, the remainder reſuming their ſpears <note n="3" place="bottom">Bowar, 488.</note>. It appears that armour, nay ſpears, and bows, and arrows, were chiefly imported <note n="4" place="bottom">Act, f. v. 8: in particular the heads of arrows and of ſpears ſeem to have been entirely imported form Flanders.</note>. The martial muſic, as is well known, conſiſted of horns. Some choſen followers were arrayed in the livery of their chiefs; but the reſt of the army preſented a motley mixture <note n="5" place="bottom">Froiſſart loſes all temper in ſpeaking of Scotland, and the Scots, on account of the treatment of Vienne and his petulant knights. The admiral, ſays he, told the French king, that he would rather be earl of Savoy, or Artois, than king of Scotland; the force of which conſiſted of about 500 lances (3000 men at arms,) and 30,300 commoners, of no avail againſt Engliſh archers, or 1000 men at arms, fol, 183, T.

                     </note>.</p>
                  <p>The diſcipline, and exerciſe, were trivial; the arrangement was by clans. On the march almoſt every man rode a ſmall horſe, to ſave fatigue; but none, except the knights or fixed cavalry, remained on horſeback in a battle. Each man carried
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0141700201:179"/>proviſions for forty days, chiefly oat-meal; but meat was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by pillage. The right wing became the van, the left the rear, while the center retained its ſtation.</p>
                  <p>The exact order of battle, the arrangement of the ranks and files, are ſubjects enveloped in much obſcurity; and while, with all the lights of the Roman claſſics, it remains doubtful whether that great people arranged their Haſtati, Principes, and Triarii, in ſingle lines, or in deep files, there is leſs room to wonder at the careleſſneſs of the monkiſh hiſtorians. Yet it appears ſufficiently clear that deep files were uſed, and that the <hi>battels</hi> or battalions were almoſt ſquare; though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they fought in an <hi>eſchelle</hi> or circle; ſometimes perhaps in the gothic wedge <note n="6" place="bottom">The <hi>eſchelle</hi> was by the Scots termed a <hi>ſhiltrum.</hi> The hoſt was ſometimes divided into three or four of theſe <hi>ſhiltrums</hi> of the heavy armed and ſpearmen, amid which the archers and light infantry were ſheltered, as by fortreſſes. See Holinſhed's deſcription of the battle of Falkirk.</note>. Thin files of two or three ſeem a modern invention, long poſterior to the uſe of cannon and fire arms. But the utility of the deep maſſes formerly uſed is not eaſily diſcovered; not above three ſpears could come into contact, and the reſt ſeems an idle depth, expoſed to the arrows of the enemy. This theme muſt be ſubmitted to mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary men; and it is doubtful if the materials be ſufficient for preciſe inveſtigation.</p>
                  <p>The moſt eminent or ſkilful peers who were preſent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the grand diviſions, commonly four, the right and left wings, the center and reſerve. Under them the ſmaller barons acted as inferior officers, in feudal gradation, and often by hereditary right.</p>
                  <p>In ſieges cannon now began to be uſed, inſtead of the ſows, battering rams, and other engines, the reliques of Roman ſkill. But no memorable ſiege happening after the acceſſion
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0141700201:180"/>of the houſe of Stuart, and the Scots having been ſingularly deficient in this art, it is unneceſſary to illuſtrate the topic.</p>
                  <p>Theſe remarks ſhall be cloſed with an abſtract of the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the beginning of June 1385, between the earl of Carric and other peers, and Jehan de Vienne the leader of the French forces in Scotland. It bears that they ſhall march towards the borders on the twenty third of July, and ſhall lay ſiege to ſome fortreſſes, but as battle is expected their ſtrength is not to be waſted in doubtful aſſaults: that none ſhall pillage in advancing to the marches, but ſhall pay for what they have, on pain of beheading; and all perſons coming to the army to ſell victuals ſhall be ſafe: if any man ſlay another, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant death: if any common ſoldier ſtrike a gentleman, he ſhall loſe his hand or ear; if one gentleman ſtrike another, juſtice ſhall be adminiſtered by the captains. In riots between the French and Scots, the byeſtanders muſt ſeize the guilty, who if knights are to loſe horſe and armour, if commoners a hand or an ear; the like penalty for thoſe who ſhall diſlodge their companions, or diſorder the march. All Scots and French are to wear, before and behind, a white croſs of St. Andrew; if the armour be white, it muſt be borne on a ſquare, or a circle, of black cloth. If any Scot inſult a Frenchman, he is to be ſeized by the French, and brought before a Scotiſh chief; and ſo in the contrary. He who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſes an Engliſhman is to have half his ranſom. None ſhall ſet ſire to a church, kill a woman or a child, or commit rape, on the penalty above mentioned of knight and common ſoldier. The priſoner ſhall belong to that captor who firſt received his plighted hand; if taken from him the captain ſhall order reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; if the priſoner be killed a reaſonable ranſom ſhall be allowed. All ſafe conducts granted by Vienne ſhall be obſerved by the Scotiſh lords and captains; and the French
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0141700201:181"/>leaders ſhall pay like reverence to thoſe of the Scotiſh gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals <note n="7" place="bottom">Regiſter, f. v. 72.</note>. Such is this curious ordinance, which throws con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable light on the military manners of the times.</p>

                  <p>ON theſe topics only a few brief illuſtrations occur. Though Scotland was already denuded of wood, as before evinced, it was not owing to the progreſs of agriculture. James I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that each poor perſon who ought to be a labourer, ſhould either be the half proprietor of one ox in the plough, or dig every day a ſquare of ſeven feet of ground, a toil which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended through the year muſt not have been inconſiderable <note n="8" place="bottom">Acts, f. v. 7.</note>. His ſtatutes alſo ordain that every farmer, uſing a plough of eight oxen, ſhall ſow every year a firlot, or four Scotiſh pecks, of wheat, half that quantity of peaſe, and <hi>forty</hi> beans, under the penalty of ten ſhillings to the baron <note n="9" place="bottom">Ibid. f. v. 14.</note>. Oats and barley were almoſt the ſole crops; not only wheat but peaſe and beans were extremely rare, and <hi>peaſe-bannocs</hi> were till lately eſteemed the next regale to wheaten bread. The acts concerning wolves and rooks, and burning of heath at improper ſeaſons, need not be recapitulated. Stealers or peelers of green wood, breakers of orchards, deſtroyers of rabbit warrens, and dove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cots, were all juſtly puniſhed by this wiſe prince; who alſo eſtabliſhed a <hi>new extent</hi> or valuation of landed property <note n="1" place="bottom">Home, hiſt. law tracts, p. 416, ſeq</note>.</p>
                  <p>The frequent wars between Scotland and England, ſince the death of Alexander III, had occaſioned to the former
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0141700201:182"/>country the loſs of more than a century in the progreſs of civilization. While in England only the northern provinces were expoſed to the Scotiſh incurſions, Scotland ſuffered in its moſt civilized departments. It is apparent that, in the reign of Alexander III, the kingdom was more abundant in the uſeful arts and manufactures, than it was in the time of Robert III.</p>
                  <p>When James I concluded the commercial treaty with Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, it is highly probable that he invited Flemiſh artiſans to ſettle in his dominions. With his admirable talents for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, it ſeems impoſſible that he could overlook the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of a plan certainly purſued by his ſucceſſors <note n="2" place="bottom">Boyce, f. 365, affirms that James I procured Flemiſh artiſts; but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture is better than his authority. From Bowar, 505, it appears that James delighted in the mechanic arts.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Yet the evidence concerning uſeful arts and manufactures continues barren. In a ſtatute of 1428 maſons, carpenters, ſmiths, taylors, weavers, are mentioned <note n="3" place="bottom">Acts, f. 18.</note>; and perhaps one or two others <hi>crafts,</hi> as cordiners, or the like, may be omitted. The weavers were apparently ſolely employed in coarſe linens, and perhaps ſome woolen ſtuffs. But while Ireland from its Engliſh ſettlements exported the latter, Scotland had certainly no manufactured export <note n="4" place="bottom">The Dittamundi teſtifies the export from Ireland of <hi>ſaie,</hi> ſays, or thin woolen ſtuffs.</note>. The rich were wholly clothed in foreign products; which ſeem even to have furniſhed the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day dreſſes of the poor.</p>

                     <hi>SECTION IV.</hi> Commerce, Money, Navigation.</head>
                  <p>THE grand emporia of commerce at this period were Venice. England, Flanders, and the Hanſe Towns. Venice in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular concentrated the commerce of the eaſt and ſouth; and Flanders that of the weſt and north. Hence the extreme opulence of the Netherlands, and the rapid progreſs of their uſeful and luxurious arts. To them almoſt the whole Scotiſh trade was confined: ſome voyages to Norway, Denmark, and one or two of the Hanſe Towns, and ſome to France for wines, formed perhaps the only varieties.</p>
                  <p>The imports from Flanders extended, as has already ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared from Froiſſart, even to the commoneſt neceſſaries. The exports by the account of pope Pius II, were hides, wool, ſalt-fiſh, and pearls <note n="5" place="bottom">Scotland was long celebrated for pearls. Julius Caeſar is accuſed of invading Britain to procure that precious article, and there ſeems no evidence that they were found in the ſouth. Alexander I had a vaſt collection. Dalr. Ann. I, 58. The Tay ſtill furniſhes ſome pearls.</note>. The ſtatutes further ſupply horſes, kine, ſheep, various ſkins for furs, as mertrik, fulmart, otter, fox, hart, and roe: and woolen cloths, probably of Scotiſh wool manufactured in Flanders for Scotiſh merchants <note n="6" place="bottom">Acts, f. 3, 5. Herring, freſh, ſalted, and red, are alſo mentioned. <hi>Talch</hi> or tallow is forbidden to be exported.</note>. The cuſtoms on imports and exports amounted to about two ſhillings in the pound, or a tyth; but the extent of the trade cannot be aſcertained <note n="7" place="bottom">Ib. f. v. 7, &amp;c.</note>. The balance was however greatly againſt Scotland, as may appear from the gradual impoveriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0141700201:184"/>of the country, and riſe in the value of the coin; and no leſs than five ſtatutes of James I appear, againſt the expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of money.</p>
                  <p>The merchants often went abroad with their cargoes; but none was permitted to uſe this privilege, except he were worth three <hi>ſerplaiths</hi> of wool, each ſerplaith being eighty ſtone weight, or about two ſacks <note n="8" place="bottom">Acts, f. 7. Skene voce <hi>ſerplath.</hi>
                     </note>.</p>
                  <p>Campvere does not appear to have been the ſtaple port, till after the marriage of its lord to a daughter of James I. The Dam or Amſterdam, Sluys, Bruges, are mentioned as the places of reſort; and in the latter city James I founded a Scotiſh chapel, to be ſupported by ſome duties on veſſels <note n="9" place="bottom">Acts J. III, 1466, prohibiting further intercourſe with the <hi>Swyn,</hi> the <hi>Sluys,</hi> the Dam, or Bruges.

                  <p>In the old manuſcripts of our laws thoſe concerning ſhipping appear, certainly not later than the reign of the firſt James; but they throw no light on commerce. It is remarkable that they always name Berwick, in mentioning a ſea-port; and Bourdeaux is almoſt the only foreign haven known to their doubtful pages. They are merely private regulations, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably Engliſh, and compoſed at Berwick, which, when ſhips were of fifty tons, aſpired to be a port; and even ſo late as the reign of James V demanded to be conſidered as the ſtaple for all Scotiſh ſalmon imported into England <note n="1" place="bottom">MS. Harl. 4700, written about 1430, and perhaps the oldeſt extant of the Regiam Majeſtatem. And ſee the reign of James V.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Domeſtic traffic was chiefly carried on at fairs, an amiable and uſeful invention of the Roman catholic ſuperſtition. They were commonly held on the day of the ſaint to whom
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0141700201:185"/>the pariſh church was dedicated, and ſometimes on ſundays. Thither the merchant or the chapman brought his goods; and the farmer and the peaſant diſpoſed of their products, and returned to their wives, daughters, or miſtreſſes, with neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, or little luxuries, the cloths and tools of Flanders, or the ſilks and ſpices of Venice and the Eaſt.</p>
                  <p>Yet the defect of induſtry in agriculture, paſturage, and manufactures, occaſioned as above mentioned a great balance againſt Scotland, and affected the coinage, which till the year 1355 had been equal in name, weight, and purity, to the Engliſh. In a parliament of June 1385, it was ordered that the moneyer ſhould iſſue coin of ſterling purity, either from bullion, foreign money, or vaſes and other plate; and render out of the pound weight of ſilver twenty-nine ſhillings and four pennies, or in other words three hundred and fifty-two pennies. Thoſe who bring blanks of France are to have the ſame weight, except the loſs of ſix blanks in the pound. The Engliſh noble of ſix ſhillings and eight pence is ordered to go for ſeven ſhillings and eight pence Scotiſh: the French crown of 47 deniers for 42 Scotiſh pennies; and that of Flanders for 47 and a half-penny; while the French mouton is to bear 50. The exportation of money, by ſea or land, is prohibited, on pain of forfeiting the ſum, and even the life of the offender to be in the king's power; except foreign merchants who bring corn, wine, boards, or the like neceſſaries, who may export their profits <note n="2" place="bottom">Regiſter, f. 74.</note>. In the reigns of Robert III, and James I, Scotiſh money was to the Engliſh as one to two. The gold coinage of Scotland commences with the acceſſion of the houſe of Stuart <note n="3" place="bottom">Anderſon Dipl. Grants of Robert III appear to Thomas Melville, officer of the mint, and to Galfur Goldſmith, coiner. Scotſ. Cal. Harl. 4609, f. 121. The latter was probably a foreigner, Fleming or Lombard. It is probable that the engravers for the mint alſo executed the ſeals of the middle ages, the beſt productions of art in theſe times.</note>.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="171" facs="tcp:0141700201:186"/>Navigation continued in ſtate of imperfection. The ſhort and heavy ſhape of the ſhips, with a high chamber on the poop and prow, or fore and back, caſtle, large tops like gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries in the maſts, and other inartificial mechaniſm, preſents a ſtriking contraſt to the light elegance, and rapid movements, of modern veſſels. Even the galleys, or ſhips with oars, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played their high caſtles, and a form far from agile. The ſhips had thus leſs command of the ſea, and were more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the ſtorm, ſo that it is no wonder that ſailing in the winter months was ſtrictly prohibited. James I ordered with great juſtice that, in caſe of ſhipwrecks on the Scotiſh coaſts, foreign veſſels ſhould undergo the ſame laws as were practiſed in the countries to which they belonged. <note n="4" place="bottom">Acts, f. v. 21.

                  <p>IN the middle ages the hiſtory of literature is intimately connected with that of the church; and it is a ſingular reverſe of chance and time when literary men, themſelves the prieſts of the muſes, become enemies of their predeceſſors the prieſts and monks, whoſe influence was only that of knowledge over ignorance. During thoſe barbarous times, when ſcience was neglected, and force alone reigned, a literary man could not
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0141700201:187"/>purſue his ſtudies, except in a monaſtery: and there is reaſon to believe that many cordially deſpiſed the ſuperſtitions which they profeſſed, and had, like the ancient philoſophers, their exoteric doctrine for the people, and their eſoteric for the learned: at leaſt this ſeems the moſt rational way of account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the preſervation of many claſſics, and works of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, little accordant with the chriſtian purity, and doctrine; and for ſome minute but ſingular circumſtances, in ſeveral ſculptures and manuſcripts of thoſe times.</p>
                  <p>That chriſtianity had an eminent effect in the progreſs of civilization, it would be abſurd to deny. Its enemies aſſert that it introduced only new motives of diſcord, proſcribed all vigour of intellect by the imbecility of belief, excited innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable wars of religion, (a contradiction in terms almoſt unknown to the ancient world,) murdered millions for any abſurd dogma; and even by the ſeverity of its doctrines, tended to vitiate or madden mankind, unable to obſerve laws repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to their nature. But ſuch are human affairs that no eminent advantage can be produced, without great concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant diſaſters; and the objections proceed upon a fallacious ground, as being eſtimated from a partial view of the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of chriſtianity in civilized times, inſtead of a general retroſpect of its influence on barbarous nations and periods. The tenets of the ancient philoſophers had been confined to a few individuals; but the chriſtian ſyſtem was diffuſed through all ranks of men; and its progreſs into the northern kingdoms is marked by the firſt dawn of ſcience, and civilization. It was in itſelf a ſyſtem of education; and thus accompliſhed what no conqueſt, intercourſe, nor form of government, could have ſupplied; and even where its firſt ſteps are marked with blood, the temporary evil produced a laſting benefit, by abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing the conſtant wars and ſlaughters of ſavage life, and the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0141700201:188"/>immolation of human victims to deformed idols. Reaſon has as yet had no power over nations, and enthuſiaſm alone could produce ſuch wide and laſting effects: but while ſome may doubt whether any particular ſyſtem of religion be deſigned by providence as an eternal fabric, or as a ſcaffolding to hide and accompliſh ſome great deſign, let us be contented to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe to chriſtianity its juſt merits, in advancing the ſtate of barbaric ſociety.</p>
                  <p>The hiſtory of the church of Scotland preceding the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation preſents few important events, and the chief are inwoven with the national annals. Only ſome detached facts and remarks are reſerved for this place.</p>
                  <p>The privileges of the Scotiſh church are often confirmed in the ſtatutes, but are no where preciſely enumerated. They ſeem to have been an exemption from tribute and war, and from the ſentence of a temporal judge: a judicial authority in the ſpiritual cauſes of tithes, teſtaments, matrimonial and heretical affairs: freedom to let lands and tithes: ſubmiſſion to no foreign church, but to the pope alone: a power of holding provincial councils for the regulation of the national church. In benefices the pontiff had only the right of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation and deprivation, and the purchaſe of any benefice at Rome was ſtrictly prohibited. The biſhops were elected by the chapter, and the royal recommendation ſeems ſeldom to have intervened. Abbots were choſen by the monks alone; the ſecular clergy were named by the proprietors of the lands <note n="5" place="bottom">Theſe clergy were either parſons, (rectors,) or vicars. Many were in the appointment of the biſhops, and of collegiate bodies, whoſe chapters they formed. Hence the lay patronage was much confined. The parochial anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities of Scotland have been little explored; but the number of pariſh churches ſeems to have encreaſed ſince the reformation. It appears, from the foundation charter of the collegiate church of Dunbar, that a vicar's ſalary was about ten marks ſterling, or about ſeventy pounds modern currency.</note>.
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0141700201:189"/>Many ſees, and abbeys, were opulent; but James III ſeems to have been the firſt monarch who ſeized and made a traffic of the nomination.</p>
                  <p>Winton gives a ſingular tale, unknown to other writers, concerning the appointment of a biſhop of St. Andrews. In the year 1399 Walter Danielſton, parſon of Kincardin O Neil in Aberdeenſhire, by ſome means took poſſeſſion of the caſtle of Dunbarton. Three years after, on the death of Trial biſhop of St. Andrews, Thomas Stuart brother to the king was elected by the chapter, but not confirmed by the pope; and Danielſton offered to ſurrender Dunbarton, if the ſee were affigned to him. The terms were accepted by Albany: but Danielſton only ſurvived this ſtrange tranſaction half a year <note n="6" place="bottom">MS. 886.</note>.</p>
                  <p>James I introduced the Carthuſian order into Scotland: he found the Benedictine and Auguſtinian monks ſo relaxed in their diſcipline, that he wrote a letter of exhortation on the ſubject to their abbots and friars <note n="7" place="bottom">Bowar, 508.</note>. After a lapſe of near a century, a general council of the Scotiſh clergy was held at Perth in 1420; but its regulations are of little moment. Another council met Antony biſhop of Urbino in February 1437, but the king's death prevented any procedure <note n="8" place="bottom">Innes Eſſay, II, 587. Bowar, 502.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The maſs, pilgrimages, and preachings, formed the great objects of devotion. Bowar diſplays the virtue of the maſs, in ſaving three monks of his monaſtery, who were bringing ale in a boat that was loſt, with a credulity worthy of the ninth century <note n="9" place="bottom">Cont. Fordun, 467.</note>. The moſt noted pilgrimage appears to have been Whithern; and James I iſſued a general permiſſion to the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0141700201:190"/>Engliſh and people of Man to viſit that ſanctuary <note n="1" place="bottom">Scotſ. Cal. "The ſauls of Whithorn." Rabelais, II, 322, mentions the frequent pilgrimages to St. <hi>Treignan,</hi> (Ringan, a Scotiſh corruption of Ninian,) and I, 250, puts St. Treignan of Scotland, as a common oath.</note>. Sermons in the vulgar tongue were not only delivered by the preaching friars, but by ſuch of the biſhops, and other ſecular clergy, as were capable. At the coronation of Robert III, 1390, Thomas biſhop of Galloway preached the ſermon <note n="2" place="bottom">Winton, 860. The homilies in latin were for the clergy, and for publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: but ſermons in the vulgar tongue ſeem to have continued in all ages. The Anglo-ſaxon homilies are innumerable: and the practice might be evinced from contemporary writers of all centuries, in France and other countries. Des Urſins in particular often mentions ſermons, being himſelf an archbiſhop.</note>. An idea of theſe ſermons may be drawn from thoſe at the opening of Engliſh parliaments: latin ſentences from ſcripture were mixed with declamations in the language of the country.</p>
                  <p>Scholaſtic divinity continued to be regarded as the chief branch of literature: an idle ſtudy, in which the powers of the human mind were conſumed in mere diſputation concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ideal words, while things were neglected or unknown. The acuteneſs waſted on quiddities, entities, and other ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities, might if applied to life, manners, or real ſcience and philoſophy, have made important diſcoveries: but ſuch is man, ever ready to abandon the important realities before him, and eager in purſuit of barren viſions. Till the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of St. Andrews was founded in 1412, the Scotiſh youth deſigned for the church were chiefly educated at Paris and Oxford <note n="3" place="bottom">The firſt profeſſorſhips at St. Andrews were for School-divinity, canon-law, philoſophy and logic: the profeſſors Lindoris, Cornel, Shevis, Gill, &amp;c.

                  <p>Amid many important circumſtances, which mark the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the houſe of Stuart, may be placed the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

At the head of this ſeries ſtands John Barbour arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon of Aberdeen, who in 1375 wrote his celebrated hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical poem on the actions of king Robert the Great. He alſo compoſed a genealogy of the kings of Scotland, from the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous Brutus of Geffrey of Monmouth, down to Robert II incluſive; and endeavoured to render the new dynaſty more illuſtrious by poetical embelliſhment. This work is loſt; but we learn that he derived the Stuarts from Wales, and from Fleance de Waran, and fell into unchronological errors which Bowar points out, about ſixty years after the appearance of this ideal genealogy, an offering of flattery on the altar of loyalty <note n="4" place="bottom">Barbour's Bruce, London 1789, pref. p. xix. Bowar, 542.</note>.</p>
                  <p>John of Fordun, an uſeful compiler of hiſtory, alſo flouriſhed under Robert II. His work was however little known, till it was republiſhed with large additions by Walter Bowar in the reign of James II. Thomas Barry, canon of Glaſgow, and firſt provoſt of the collegiate church of Bothwell, wrote a long latin poem, in various kinds of rime, on the battle of Otterburn, 1388. It is preſerved by Bowar, and is not without merit in its ſingular line <note n="5" place="bottom">Cont. Fordun, 406.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Andrew Winton, prior of Lochleven, compoſed his riming chronicle of Scotland, while Murdac duke of Albany was regent, 1419—1424, as appears from his prayer that the ſon of Robert Duke of Albany may equal his father <note n="6" place="bottom">MS. 901. "The fruite of him God graunt to be Sik as in his tyme was he."</note>. James I is well known as a poet of great genius. It is likely that Sir

                  <p>THE ſtate of the arts was not ſo mean as may be imagined. Architecture, in particular, began to aſſume all the richneſs, of which the Gothic ſtyle is ſuſceptible. To the credit of Robert II and III it may be remarked, that no religious foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation is aſcribed to them; and the revenues of the crown were keeped ſacred from ſuperſtition. Of the latter prince it is recorded, that when Annabella his queen endeavoured to perſuade him to erect a magnificent tomb for himſelf, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, with his accuſtomed piety and humility, that he would prefer the meaneſt ſepulchre, as more proper for one of the worſt of kings, and greateſt of ſinners <note n="9" place="bottom">Bowar, 440.</note>. The foundation of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0141700201:193"/>monaſteries had, in the preceding century, remarkably ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided. The wealth of the monks had rendered them volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, illiterate, and remiſs in their duties, ſo that even the maſſes for the founders appear to have been uncelebrated. Hence a new ſpecies of religious foundation became faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the fifteenth century, that of collegiate churches or provoſtries, ſo named becauſe the ſuperior was ſtyled provoſt. The ſecular canons, or prebends, formed a body at the college church, occupied in divine ſervice, and ſinging maſſes for the founders, while their vicars ſerved their reſpective pariſh churches. Theſe collegiate edifices, with ſome foundations for the Obſervantines, a branch of the Franciſcans or Gray Friars remarkable for auſterity, preſent the moſt certain and genuine ſpecimens of eccleſiaſtic architecture at this period; ſuch as Dunbar, Bothwell, Botham, Corſtorphin <note n="1" place="bottom">Spottiſwoode, Religious Houſes. Winton MS. 835, gives ſome account of the architecture of a part of the church of St. Andrews, which had been burnt down, and was rebuilt by biſhop Landal, 1341—1385. Tombs of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable elegance are alſo found in Scotland, of the period now under view; but nothing is known of the artiſts.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The larger caſtles continued to be diſtinguiſhed by one or two exterior walls, and a court in the centre of which ſtood a large and high tower, or donjon. Some there were which approached to more modern architecture, being built around a central court, and only fortified with a ditch and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge. Every <hi>laird</hi> or country gentleman had his <hi>fortalice,</hi> or tower, a lofty edifice with ſmall windows, ſurmounted by a flat ſtone roof and battlements, and ſecured by a ditch. In towns the few chief houſes had more of the modern ſtyle, fortification being unneceſſary while the town was guarded by a wall and ditch. The architecture ſeems to correſpond with the Flemiſh; the Scotiſh artiſans perhaps ſtudying in Flanders.</p>

                     <pb n="179" facs="tcp:0141700201:194"/>Bowar celebrates James I for the conſtruction of palaces, and reparation of caſtles, but he does not ſpecify the inſtances <note n="2" place="bottom">Cont.

Till the year 1500 the gardens even in France had only <hi>treilles, berceaux, tonnelles, preaux, ſieges, et pavillons de verdure.</hi> Le Grand, I, 150.</note>. The uſe of pot-herbs ſeems never to have been interrupted in the middle ages; and conſtant intercourſe with Flanders, a celebrated ſeat of horticulture, muſt have given the Scots a taſte for gardening. The monaſteries in particular were diſtinguiſhed for good gardens and orchards <note n="4" place="bottom">There is an idea, or tradition, that coleworts were introduced in the north of Scotland by Cromwell's ſoldiers.

                  <p>In painting it is probable that no native artiſt aroſe, though James I was himſelf an eminent calligrapher, illuminator, and painter in miniature <note n="5" place="bottom">Bowar, 505.</note>. But Venice had already introduced many arts from Conſtantinople, and in the current of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce had imported them to Flanders. Oil-painting in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular was known for centuries, before John Van Eyck about 1410 made ſome improvement, which gave him the fallacious honour of being conſidered as the inventor <note n="6" place="bottom">Raſpe on oil-painting, 1781, 4to.</note>. In the erection of the palaces, colleges, and churches, often commemorated in this century, it ſeems impoſſible that painting ſhould have been forgotten.

That prince, he ſays, ſung well; and played on the tabor, bagpipe, pſaltery, organ, the flute, the harp, the trumpet, the ſhepherds reed: on the harp in particular his performances were admirable, and were highly applauded both by Iriſh and Engliſh maſters <note n="9" place="bottom">Bowar, 504, 505.

                  <p>In the conſideration of the manners of the great, hunting forms an eminent feature. Deer-ſtealers were ſeverely puniſhed; and a ſtatute appears ordering that no partridges, plovers, black-cocks, muir-cocks, nor other game, be taken from the beginning of Lent till Auguſt, under a penalty of forty ſhillings <note n="1" place="bottom">Acts, f. 7. 19.

Falconry ſeems to have been a favourite diverſion of Murdac duke of Albany; and was long to continue in high eſteem <note n="2" place="bottom">It is firſt mentioned by Firmicus in the fourth century.

                  <p>But tournaments preſented the grandeſt theatre of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment. In 1390 Sir David Lindſay of Gleneſk, afterwards
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0141700201:196"/>earl of Crawford, paſſing with a gallant train to a tourney, appointed at London by Richard II, overcame lord Wells, a valiant knight, both in the horſe and foot combat: and the circumſtances are detailed with minute pride by the Scotiſh chroniclers <note n="3" place="bottom">Winton 853—856.</note>. On the day after the conteſt, a ſpecimen aroſe of the rude wit of the time; an Engliſh knight ſaying that there were no doubt bold men in Scotland, but ſuch were the iſſue of the Engliſh by illicit intercourſe with Scotiſh ladies, during the conqueſt of that kingdom; to which Sir William Dalyel, a knight in Lindſay's train, retorted that the caſe might be true, but that it was equally certain that a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional degeneracy had taken place among the Engliſh warriors, the progeny of valets, cooks, clowns, and fathers confeſſors, whom the ladies had admitted to their arms, during the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of their lords in Scotland. And Sir Piers Courtenay, an Engliſh knight, royal champion, and brother to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, wearing on his ſleeve an embroidered falcon, with this motto,
<q>
                        <l>I beer a falcon, faireſt of flicht,</l>

                     </q>
Dalyel aſſumed a ſimilar dreſs, with the badge of a magpye, and this device,

                     </q>
The challenge was underſtood, and accepted; but the affair terminated in a ludicrous demand of Dalyel, that, as by the laws of tournament, the champions ought to be perfectly equal,

In 1394 the earl of Moray was ſlain in a tourney with the earl Marſhal of England: and in 1407 Mar was defeated in a ſimilar conteſt <note n="5" place="bottom">Caxton's Higden, f. v. 398. Winton, 903.</note>. James I ſeems not much to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged theſe ſpectacles: and it is his higher praiſe that he brought the realm to ſuch tranquillity, that there was no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to proceed to any court in arms, nor to raiſe any ſpear, except that which bore the royal pennon, the mark of his omnipreſent authority <note n="6" place="bottom">Bowar, 512.</note>.</p>
                  <p>While the commonalty were ſo much attached to the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball and golf, that poſitive ſtatutes became neceſſary againſt theſe diverſions, in order that archery might meet with due attention, the great amuſed themſelves with <hi>pawme</hi> or tennis. The diſpoſal of the evening, a great object in a life of eaſe, forms a marked diverſity in the manners of the great in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ages. Among the ancients the chief repaſt, at that time, beguiled the fatigues of the day. But the barbaric cuſtoms of a large dinner in the morning, and a ſlight ſupper three or four hours after noon, left the evening liſtleſs, ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and vacant. The game of <hi>tables</hi> or draughts, ſupplied modern cards; and the minſtrels now and then atoned for the want of theatric exhibitions. The evenings of James I paſſed in playing at cheſs, or tables, reading romances, ſinging, piping, harping: the <hi>voidee,</hi> or parting cup, was the ſignal of retiring to reſt <note n="7" place="bottom">Contemp. account of his aſſaſſination.</note>.</p>
                  <p>In food little luxury ſeems to have been known, till James I. who had reſided nineteen years in England, ſet the example

Under Robert II, the French knights could procure no wine but at a great price; the ale was no better than ſmall-beer, and the bread was of barley or oats <note n="9" place="bottom">Froiſſart, Tome II, f. 182.</note>. Among the Romans indeed barley bread was the food of gladiators, to give them ſtrength; it was alſo a favorite of the Greeks, and Hippocrates has written in its praiſe. In the cookery of the middle ages meat was highly ſeaſoned; and even the wines were often mingled with ſpices. Diſtilled ſpirits are unmentioned even in the ſouth of Europe, till about the year 1300; and were chiefly confined to the ſhop of the apothecary till the ſixteenth century. There ſeems little mention of brandy or whiſkey in Scotland, till the reign of Charles II <note n="1" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Aqua vita</hi> diſtilled from wine was known as a medicine in France, about the middle of the twelfth century, and ſeems a product of Arabian chymiſtry imported by the cruſaders. Arnoldus Villanovanus A. D. 1300 is the firſt how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever who ſpeaks in preciſe terms of <hi>aqua vitae,</hi> and recommends it for moſt diſorders, in his book on the preſervation of youth.

Schoockins de Cereviſia, 1661, ſays that corn-ſpirit is derived from Ruſſia. Whiſkey was originally the Iriſh Uſquebauh, a literal tranſlation of <hi>aqua vitae,</hi> being barley, ſaffron, and ſugar, decocted, and mixed with corn-ſpirit.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The dreſs of the common people has already been deſcribed; but that of the great was more complex. The linen ſhirt began to be uſed, over which was a doublet, or veſt with ſleeves; and the jacket or the gown ſupplied the modern coat <note n="2" place="bottom">The gown when very cloſe was called a circoat, and ſometimes by the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male term <hi>kirtil,</hi> as appears from the catalogue of the wardrobe of Henry VIII in Strutt, III, 80, conſiſting of robes, gowns, kirtles, coats, and doublets, where a kirtle with ſleeves is mentioned. And in the Speculum Regale, p. 286, a man's tunic is termed <hi>Kyrtil-ſlaus.</hi> The gown was put on as a ſhirt is, and was girded. Circoat ſhould be <hi>ſurcate,</hi> as being over the coat or jacket, often worn over the <hi>doublet,</hi> ſo called apparently as being a double dreſs under the jacket. Juvenal des Urſins deſcribes, p. 177, the whole dreſs of Charles VI as conſiſting of a ſhirt, veſt, (<hi>gippon</hi>) robe, hoſe, and boots.</note>.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0141700201:199"/>The hoſe, or breeches and ſtockings in one piece, and ſhoes of <hi>cordwain,</hi> cordovan or Spaniſh leather; and the hood, or the ſilken or velvet cap, ornamented with jewels, completed the dreſs. An act of James I prohibits any to wear ſilk, or the finer furs, except thoſe lords and knights whoſe income amounted to two hundred marks a year, and their heirs; the uſe of embroidery, pearls, or ornaments of plate, was alike reſtricted; but others might wear <hi>ſerpes,</hi> belts, broaches, and chains <note n="3" place="bottom">Acts, f. v. 20.</note>. The belt, or girdle, formed alſo a neceſſary article of the dreſs of the great: and there were other modes adapted to different ranks and occaſions, the mantle or ſhort cloke open at one ſhoulder, the tabard or looſe jacket, and the like. But the gown and the robe, and their furring, conſtituted grand objects of diſtinction and expence, being generally of ſilk, velvet, or cloth of gold. Other particulars may be learned from the contemporary account of the aſſaſſination of James I: that prince was "ſtanding in his night-gown, all undreſſed ſave his ſhirt, his cap, his comb, his coverchief, his furred <hi>pynſons</hi> upon the form." Shoes with long peaks, faſtened to the knees with chains of gold or ſilver, were in faſhion for ſome time, as appears from numerous authentic teſtimonies; but it is remarkable that they occur in no paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nor illumination <note n="4" place="bottom">The Eulogium Britanniae, written apparently in the beginning of the reign of Richard II, 1377, gives the oldeſt teſtimony concerning theſe chains; and Roſs (Warw.

                     <pb n="185" facs="tcp:0141700201:200"/>The dreſs of the ladies conſiſted chiefly of the <hi>kirtil,</hi> or cloſe gown and petticoat in one piece, and the mantle. Other articles were, the <hi>wylicot</hi> or under petticoat, ſhift of fine lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen from the Netherlands, hoſe or high ſtockings of linnen or woolen cloth, and ſhoes of leather from the <hi>Straits,</hi> Morocco or Spain. Nor ought the girdle, and the broach, which faſtened the mantle, to be omitted. The head-dreſs appears to have varied conſiderably, according to the rank or taſte of the wearer <note n="5" place="bottom">In deſcribing the female dreſs, Chaucer (Miller's Tale) mentions the <hi>ſeint</hi> or girdle, the <hi>barme-cloth</hi> or apron, ſhift embroidered round the neck with black ſilk, forming a collar, white <hi>volupere</hi> or cap with a fillet or ribbon, leathern purſe with ſilk taſſels and ornaments of metal, broad broach, ſhoes high laced.

               <p>OF the reign, <note place="margin">1437</note> now about to be deſcribed, no original and authentic hiſtory remains; and at a period when we might expect a light ſo ſtrong, as to illuminate the minuteſt features of action, and of character, a kind of twilight ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounds us, in which only a few large objects can be diſcerned. The acts of parliament, and other records, preſent unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable evidence; but it is not in the fixed formality of ſuch writings that the moſt intereſting details of hiſtory are to be found; and any regular epiſtolary correſpondence concerning
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0141700201:202"/>public affairs Scotland cannot diſplay, till towards the end of the reign of James IV. Theſe remarks are introduced to ſolicit ſome indulgence for this particular part of the narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; in which however no labour ſhall be ſpared to recover authentic facts, and to place them in a diſtinct point of view <note n="1" place="bottom">Bowar, the continuator of Fordun, terminates his hiſtorical labours with the death of James I. The ſcanty original materials, for the reign of the ſecond James, are chiefly the brief notices at the end of Bowar's work, p. 518—52c, and the hiſtory by John Mair, Paris 1521, Edin. 1740, 4to. p. 322—326, his injudicious narrative of Engliſh affairs abridging the real object of his work. Hector Boyce cloſed the firſt edition of his fables, 1527, with the death of James I: and happy had it been for our hiſtory, if he had not written the reign of James II at great length; which, after circulating in MS. and being tranſlated, (with the interpolation of two large paſſages after mentioned,) by Lindſay of Pitſcottie, was publiſhed in the ſecond edition of Boyce's hiſtory by Ferrerius, Paris 1574. Not only has Lindſay tranſlated Boyce's fabulous account, but Leſley and Buchanan have been contented to abridge it, without corrections, or new facts. In this reign only will Boyce be occaſionally quoted, and with much heſitation.
<p>With the reign of James III commence four original hiſtorians, ſeldom or never borrowing from each other, Lindſay, Ferrerius, Leſley, Buchanan.</p>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>A parliament being called at Edinburgh,<note place="margin">25 Mar.</note> the firſt object was the coronation of the young king, now only in the ſixth year of his age, and which was ſolemnized on the twenty-fifth day of March, then reputed the firſt day of a new year <note n="2" place="bottom">Acts, f. 26. The date is, among many ſimilar corruptions, put 20th March. But ſee Ruddiman's notes on Buchanan, I, 439. The continuator of Bowar, p. 518, rightly dates the coronation of James on the 25th March.</note>: the next, was an act paſſed to revoke al alienations of lands, or other property, belonging to the crown, ſince the death of the late king, except granted by the conſent of the three ſtates; and to declare all future alienations void, ſave thoſe warranted in like manner, until the king ſhall have attained his twenty-firſt year <note n="3" place="bottom">Acts, ibid.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:0141700201:203"/>In our defect of conſtitutional information it is not to be diſcovered by whom this parliament was ſummoned. Late writers aſſert that this high privilege was exerted by the officers of ſtate; but their duty certainly expired with the deceaſed ſovereign, and the ſacred truth that ſuch officers belong to the nation is a modern diſcovery. The ſame authors careleſsly inform us that the government was divided, by the parliament, between Sir William Crichton the chancellor, and Sir Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Livingſton appointed keeper of the king's perſon. Both accounts ſeem more than doubtful. There is every reaſon to believe, from the repeated oaths of fidelity ordered by James I to be taken to his queen, and from other circumſtances, that the late monarch had, by his teſtament, appointed the queen regent, with a choſen council <note n="4" place="bottom">The contemporary MS. on the death of James I aſcribes the puniſhment of the regicides to the queen, an indication that the chief power was in her hands.
<p>Of the MS. annals of this reign by Sir James Balfour a tranſcript has been obtained; but they are of little value, and chiefly abridged from Boyce's hiſtory. He mentions the following perſons as the council of regency; Sir William Crichton, Archibald earl of Douglas, William lord Hay, great conſtable, James lord Lindſay, Walter Haliburton, treaſurer, James Kennedy biſhop of St. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews, Henry Lighton biſhop of Moray, Mr. William Trumbull, keeper of the privy-ſeal. Livingſton as keeper of the king's perſon Sir James regards as poſſeſſed of the chief authority: but this council is probably from ſome record, as he dates its election 27th March. Yet Kennedy was not biſhop of St. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews till 1440; the biſhop of Moray was John Wincheſter; Lighton was biſhop of Aberdeen. (Keith's Biſhops.) So much for Sir James's accuracy.</p>
                     <p>From Scotſtarvet's Calendars the following officers appear towards the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this reign: Sir William Crichton, chancellor; Alexander Livingſton, <hi>lord</hi> of Calendar; James Livingſton, captain of Stirling caſtle; William Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bull, keeper of the privy-ſeal; Sir Robert Lauder of Edrington and Baſs, juſticiary; John Railſton, ſecretary; Richard Craig, director of chancery; Walter Haliburton, treaſurer; John Shevis, clerk of regiſter; Nicol Ottirburn, official of Lothian.</p>
                  </note>: that the parliament was called by the regency: and that Crichton and Livingſton were not
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0141700201:204"/>indebted to the national council for their power, but derived it from the will of James I. It is moſt improbable that a proud ariſtocracy ſhould have forſaken their pretenſions, upon this great occaſion: but that the late king ſhould have appointed two gentlemen of reputed wiſdom and integrity, in oppoſition to the dangerous ambition of the nobles, is concordant with his character, and highly credible. A ſimilar ſeries of events enſued to thoſe which occur in the minority of James V: the ſpirit of the nation, and of the times, was little adapted to the conduct of a female hand, not only feeble, but expoſed to juſt ſuſpicion, becauſe the queen was a native of England, between which country and Scotland had long ſubſiſted either open enmity, or inveterate jealouſy. Finding that her power could not command confidence, nor influence, ſhe ſoon ſhrunk from it; and left Crichton and Livingſton to maintain their turbulent elevation.</p>
               <p>An open war with England had taken place before the death of James I, and the ſpirit of that prince was not ſuch as to ſolicit peace; but the preſent ſtate of Scotland, under the diſtractions of a minority, rendered a treaty deſireable. After ſome negotiation, <note place="margin">18 Sept.</note> a ſafe conduct was granted, by Henry VI, to John biſhop of Glaſgow, Alexander Seton of Gordon, Sir Walter Ogilvy, and Sir John Forſter, as embaſſadors from Scotland <note n="5" place="bottom">Rymer, X, 677. In 1402 the houſe of Gordon cloſed in a daughter, wedded to SETON, the real name of this noble family. So in 1660 the title of Hamilton paſſed to the Douglaſes.</note>: yet, from ſome unknown cauſe, probably a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſion between Crichton and Livingſton, theſe embaſſadors were not ſent. <note place="margin">30 Nov.</note> Soon after, other perſons were appointed, namely the lords Gordon and Montgomery, Methven provoſt
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0141700201:205"/>of Lincluden, <note place="margin">1438 31 Mar.</note> ſecretary to the king, and John Vaus eſquire; and a truce of nine years was ſanctioned <note n="6" place="bottom">Rymer, X, 679, 688. Rymer erroneouſly ſuppoſes the murder of James I to have happened between the commiſſions of September and November; a ſtrange miſtake, as any Scotiſh hiſtory might have ſhewn that it happened in lent.</note>.</p>
               <p>If we credit the doubtful accounts which we have of this reign, Crichton had found means, probably by the ſuperior influence of his office, as chancellor, to gain poſſeſſion of the infant king, whom he retained in the caſtle of Edinburgh. The queen, favouring the juſt claim of Livingſton, by a ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem obtained, and conveyed her ſon to Stirling, and delivered him to the care of his legal guardian. The chancellor applied to Archibald earl of Douglas for his aſſiſtance, which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied: Livingſton inveſted the caſtle of Edinburgh; but he and the chancellor agreeing to join againſt Douglas, concord was reſtored <note n="7" place="bottom">Boyce, lib. XVIII, init. Lindſay's tranſlation, p. 5—11, Edit. Edin. 1778, 8vo.</note>.</p>
               <p>There cannot be a ſtronger proof of the ignorance of our carlier writers, concerning this reign, than their aſſertion that the powerful earl of Douglas was neglected, while it is known, from authentic records, that he held the high office of lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant general of the kingdom, <note place="margin">27 Nov.</note> and even ſummoned a parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note n="8" place="bottom">Aberc. II, 319, from MS. records.</note>. In another national aſſembly it was ordered that the lord lieutenant, <note place="margin">1439 13 Mar.</note> and the king's choſen council, ſhould hold two ſeſſions yearly for the adminiſtration of juſtice: and that the lord lieutenant ſhould ſeize any rebels, or deſpoilers, lodged in caſtles, or ſtrongholds, and enforce them to find ſurety for their good behaviour <note n="9" place="bottom">Acts, f. v. 26.</note>. But Archibald earl of Douglas died this year; and was ſucceeded by his ſon, a youth whoſe years
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0141700201:206"/>did not exceed fourteen, <note place="margin">1439</note> and were too immature to ſupport the dignities of his father <note n="1" place="bottom">Boyce and Lindſay date the death of Douglas in 1439. His epitaph, Hume's Dougl. I, 267, bears that he died the 26th June 1438: but three origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal deeds confute this date, Aberc. II, 319, and ſhew that for M.CCCC.XXXVIIII (1439) Hume read 1438; or, as not unfrequent, an erroneous date might occur in an epitaph, if placed long after the event.</note>.</p>
               <p>Meantime petty feuds and commotions deſtroyed the public peace and welfare: the flood of ariſtocratic tyranny and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, which had been confined by the ſtern government of James I, burſt the temporary barriers, and deluged the country.</p>
               <p>Joanna, the queen-mother, married Sir James Stuart, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the Black knight of Lorn: the barbariſm of the age rendering it unſafe for a woman of rank to remain without the protection of a warlike huſband. But Sir James Stuart being a friend to the family of Douglas, as is ſaid, Livingſton confined him, and his elder brother, and even the queen, till they engaged not to ſupport the houſe of Douglas. <note place="margin">1440</note> The fruit of Livingſton's inſolence was that the chancellor, by another ſtratagem, recovered the poſſeſſion of the king's perſon, and conveyed him to Edinburgh. But, by the mediation of friends, a laſting agreement was at length formed between them; and the king was committed to Livingſton's care, as ordered by his deceaſed father <note n="2" place="bottom">Boyce, lib. XVIII. Lindſay's tranſlation, 13—24. The impriſonment of the queen is evidenced by a charter, to Alexander Napier, comptroller, for his ſervice to the queen mother, to the king, and the recompence of a hurt in his body, at the time of the traitorous betraying and impriſonment of the ſaid queen, by Alexander Livingſton, knight. The lands granted are thoſe of Philde in the lordſhip of Methven, and ſheriffdom of Perth, in the king's hands by the forfeiture of the ſaid Alexander Livingſton, to be held blanch for a ſilver penny: 7 March 1449-50. Scotſt. Cal. ſub data.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:0141700201:207"/>However this be, it is certain that a parliament was held at Stirling <note n="3" place="bottom">Acts, f. v. 26.</note>,<note place="margin">2 Aug.</note> in which it was decreed that the privileges of the clergy ſhould be obſerved: that the adminiſtrators of juſtice ſhould hold their ſeſſions twice a year: and, by a remarkable act, that "the king ſhould ride through the realm, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon intelligence being ſent to his council, wherever any rebellion, ſlaughter, burning, robbery, outrage, or theft, happened; to call the ſheriff of the ſhire, wherein the crime was committed, before him, and before he leaves the ſhire to remedy the miſchief and puniſh the offenders; in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which ordinance all the barons, with one aſſent, are obliged to aſſiſt <note n="4" place="bottom">Ibid. c. 5.</note>." In this ſingular decree we find the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative body regarding the king in the modern light of a chief magiſtrate, bound equally with the meaneſt ſubject to an obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the laws: yet it may be ſuſpected that this new ſtyle, uſed by the parliament, flowed from temporary circumſtances, and not from fixed principles of the conſtitution; the nonage of the king evidently pointing the act to thoſe who had the cuſtody of his perſon, as implying that the ſovereign was not to be the priſoner of an individual, but the free inſpector of his kingdom at large.</p>
               <p>The power of the houſe of Douglas had ariſen to a formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable height, and was during this reign to contend with the royal authority. Galloway, Annandale, and other extenſive territories in Scotland, the duchy of Touraine and lordſhip of Longueville in France, rendered to the chief of that family revenues perhaps equivalent to thoſe of the Scotiſh monarch. The young earl, now in his ſixteenth year, poſſeſſed the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous ſpirit, and haughtineſs, natural to his age and fortunes.
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0141700201:208"/>His higheſt title, that of duke of Touraine <note n="5" place="bottom">This title was proudly borne in Scotland. Margaret ducheſs of Touraine, counteſs of Douglas and Longueville, occurs in two charters about this time. Scotſt. Cal. Harl. 4620 (unpaged, but beg. J. II.) She was the king's aunt, the widow of Archibald firſt duke of Touraine, ſlain in 1424.</note>, which a weak regency had permitted the houſe to aſſume, and which impolicy had not applied to the French king to diſcontinue, emboldened the Douglas to regard himſelf as a foreign prince, independent of the laws of his country. The prudence of age might have induced a concealment of pomp, and power, from the fear of envy, and danger; but, in the arrogance of youth, William earl of Douglas diſplayed a conſtant train of one thouſand horſe, and a dazzling magnificence in his houſehold; nay he would even create knights, and hold courts in imitation of parliaments <note n="6" place="bottom">Boyce, lib. XVIII. Lindſay's tranſl. p. 13.</note>.</p>
               <p>The chancellor, who, by his office, was chiefly charged to ſee the due execution of the laws, was irritated at the inſults offered to them by the power of Douglas. Inſtead of bearing with the young earl's inſolence, in the hopes that a few years would infuſe moderation and prudence into his conduct; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſecretly uſing the king's influence with the court of France, that the foreign titles and poſſeſſions might be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from the family, Crichton reſolved to cut off the earl, and his brother; a meaſure which might perhaps have admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſome apology, had they been advanced to maturer age, for it ſeems ſtrictly equitable that an oppreſſor, who is above the procedure of juſtice, may be ſacrificed to the laws, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any procedure of juſtice; but which, while we conſider the tender age of the offenders, muſt be pronounced unjuſt, murderous, and tyrannical. Nay when the conſequences are
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0141700201:209"/>ſeen, this act will appear weak and impolitic, and will incur the bittereſt charge of depravity, that of ineffectual guilt.</p>
               <p>By plauſible invitations, and flatteries, William earl of Douglas, his brother David, and Malcom Fleming of Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernauld, a faithful adherent of the family, were inveigled into the caſtle of Edinburgh, and after an inſidious entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a brief and deluſory trial, were beheaded <note n="7" place="bottom">Cont. of Bowar, 518, (and Bowar, 490, note.) Chron. end of Winton. Mair, 322. Among the fables of Boyce, and all becomes fable in his hands, is the tale of the bull's head, preſented before Douglas as a ſymbol of death. Such a ſignal were abſurd in itſelf, and the height of impolicy. As Boyce connects the Scots with the Egyptians, &amp;c. this ſymbol may perhaps be traced in ſome ancient author: at preſent it ſuffices to ſay that it was unknown to Scotiſh hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and manners.</note>. The earldom of Douglas fell to the next male heir, James lord of Abercorn, ſurnamed the Groſs, a prudent and peaceable man, but who unfortunately enjoyed his title only two years, and left a turbulent ſon William, the third of that name: the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entailed eſtates of Galloway, Wigton, Balvenie, Ormond, and Annandale, were inherited by Margaret, ſiſter of the murdered earl, commonly called The Fair Maid of Galloway, who wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her couſin the third William, thereby reſtoring the houſe of Douglas to all its power <note n="8" place="bottom">Yet James the Groſs held theſe titles, or his epitaph is again erroneous. Hume Dougl. I, 295. In a charter of 1440 he is ſpecially called earl of Anen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale, and lord Balveny. Scotſt. Cal. Wigton and Ormond do not appear, and may have been unentailed. If James had Galloway, &amp;c. why did they not paſs to his ſon? Beatrix, wife of James the Groſs, is, by ſome writers, confounded with the fair maid of Galloway.</note>. The want of wiſdom in the government, upon this occaſion, exceeds belief; but it is eaſier to commit a murder, than to perform an action of common prudence, and crime ought never to infer ability. Margaret was apparently a ward of the crown; at any rate the new earl
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0141700201:210"/>William, and the heireſs, were within the degrees of conſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity, and he was forced to apply ſecretly to the pope for a diſpenſation, which not arriving ſo ſpeedily as he hoped he married her on Good Friday, in the time of Lent, a day and period eſteemed as unlawful as the marriage <note n="9" place="bottom">Boyce, lib. XVIII. Lindſay's tranſl. 30. Hume's Dougl. I, 293, 294. Yet the fact is doubtful. She ſeems to have been very young, and only affianced; for in Feb. 1449-50, appears a grant of her marriage to earl William, Scotſt. Cal. and publiſhed in Hay's Vindication of El. More, p. 66.</note>. The oppoſition to this connection ought to have been cogent, the pretexts for annulling it were juſt: but for this unaccountable neglect the regency, the nation, the king, were afterwards ſufficiently to ſuffer.</p>
               <p>An embaſſy arrived from Bretagne, <note place="margin">1441</note> to propoſe a marriage between Francis count de Montfort, ſon and heir of John V ſurnamed the Good and Wiſe, and Iſabella of Scotland ſiſter to the king <note n="1" place="bottom">Lobineau Hiſt. de Bret. Paris 1707, folio, p. 619. On this occaſion Lobineau relates, after Argentré, that on the return of his envoys, Hingant and Pencoedic, duke John V aſking their opinion of the lady, they anſwered that ſhe was beautiful, of elegant ſhape and blooming health, but ſpoke little, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently not from diſcretion but great ſimplicity. The duke's noted reply was, "Chers amis, je vous prie retournez en Eſcoce, et me l'amenez; elle eſt telle que je la deſire. Ces grandes ſubtilités en une femme nuiſſent plus qu'elles ne ſervent; je n'en veux point d'autre. Par Saint Nicolas j'eſtime une femme aſſez ſage, quand elle ſait mettre difference entre la chemiſe et le pourpoint de ſon mari.'" Lobineau gives her portrait from an original in the cathedral church of Vannes.</note>. The propoſals were favourably heard; and Sir George Crichton admiral of Scotland <note n="2" place="bottom">Lobineau, as uſual with the French, corrupts his name to <hi>Trethon.</hi> He was perhaps the ſecond ſon of the chancellor, and is, it is believed, the firſt admiral of Scotland on record, though "the admirals of the Scotiſh king" be mentioned in the truce of 1429. Rymer, X, 482. Crichton appears as admiral of Scotland in a charter of 1 April 1450: in Feb. 1451 he is ſtyled George Crichton of Cairns, admiral of Scotland. On the 8th July 1452 he is earl of Caithneſs. Scotſt. Cal. The title had paſſed to the crown on the forfeiture of Athole; and on the death of Crichton was conferred on the Sinclairs of Orkney. Suth.

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0141700201:212"/>earldom of Orkney, <note place="margin">1443</note> Thomas of Tholac, the biſhop, made a formal report on the ſubject to Chriſtopher III, king of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark Sweden and Norway, in which the right of the houſe of Sinclair is evinced <note n="8" place="bottom">This valuable diploma is printed in Wallace's Orkneys, and in the Ork<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyinga Saga: and is one of the moſt curious hiſtorical pieces of that dark period. The tranſcriber has, by a common error, omitted <hi>quadrageſimo</hi> after <hi>quadringenteſimo,</hi> whence the date 1403: but the real epoch is clear from the contents.</note>.</p>
               <p>The king now approached his fourteenth year, <note place="margin">1444</note> when, by the uſage of moſt kingdoms, he was regarded as capable of managing his affairs: the perturbation of a minority, flattery, and the danger of oppoſing the royal will, as ſoon as the ſlighteſt degree of manly thought appears, concurring to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in princes, whoſe ſtation is the moſt difficult, a far more early diſcretion than is to be found in the common ranks of mankind. That reign muſt indeed be very weak, which tranſcends not the inefficacy, and diſturbances of a regency. By the common courſe of human affairs, the young king de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted the control of Livingſton and Crichton; and the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous friends of the houſe of Douglas were ſucceſsful in ſharpening his reſentment againſt thoſe ſtern guardians, who had held him in captivity, and in turning his affections to the earl of Douglas, whoſe youth was more congenial with that of the king, and whoſe power could irreſiſtibly enforce the royal deſigns. It is ſaid that Galbraith, a partiſan of Douglas, having ſlain Semple deputy governor of Dunbarton caſtle, and ſeized the whole command of that fortreſs, Douglas became anxious for the event, and proceeding to the king's preſence, put himſelf wholly in the power of James, with profeſſions and oaths of the humbleſt fidelity: and that the monarch, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with his ſubmiſſion and behaviour, admitted him to his

Crichton ſhut himſelf up in the caſtle of Edinburgh, of which he had been governor ſince the late reign, with a reſolution to defend himſelf againſt the violence of his enemies: and Livingſton, who was leſs obnoxious, either by office or crimes, held the caſtle of Stirling. Douglas uſed his new power with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, dangerous to the king, and to himſelf. In a ſhort time all the followers of the late adminiſtration were diſplaced, and ſucceſſors devoted to the preſent miniſtry were appointed: three brothers of Douglas ſoon became peers <note n="2" place="bottom">James and Archibald were twin brothers of the ſecond birth. The former was the firſt born, but was in the church, (ſee Drummond 50.) He was how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever afterwards to become earl of Douglas.</note>.

This acceſſion of power to a family, before too potent, was the height of impolicy, and could only be granted by a youth to a favourite.</p>
               <p>Douglas procured a parliament to be held, <note place="margin">1445</note> in which Crich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and Livingſton were denounced rebels, and their eſtates
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0141700201:214"/>forfeited. The caſtle of Crichton was taken, and deſtroyed; and, in revenge, the late chancellor made excurſions from the caſtle of Edinburgh, and ravaged the lands in Lothian be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Douglas. The Kingdom fell into complete anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, and became one ſcene of violence and diſorder <note n="5" place="bottom">Boyce, lib. XVIII. Lindſay's tranſl. 33, 34. It is certain that a parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was held in July 1445, and paſſed an act ordaining that all the lands and effects of the late king ſhould be enjoyed by the preſent during his minority, (Acts, f. 27;) a ſtatute probably pointing at Crichton and Livingſton.</note>.</p>

               <p>Eleanor and Jane, the two unmarried ſiſters of James, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to France, to their ſiſter the dauphineſs, apparently on the death of the queen-mother <note n="7" place="bottom">Perhaps after her death, (Berry, 158) the preciſe date of which is unfixed: but it certainly happened before 24th Nov. 1445, of which date there is a fate conduct to James Stuart the huſband of the deceaſed queen of Scotland. Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, XI, 107.</note>; for Scotland was in a ſtate of lawleſs confuſion; and there was reaſon for apprehenſion, that Douglas would convert he princely bridals into a further ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of power to his family. Upon their arrival, they found the dauphineſs dead <note n="8" place="bottom">Berry hiſt. de Charles VII, (publiſhed with the works of Alain Chartier, Paris 1617, 4to.) p. 158, "elle etoit belle et bonne donne." Duclos hiſt. de Louis XI, 1, 57. She was only in her twenty-ſecond year, and was buried at Chalons.
<p>The ſingular fate of this princeſs may excuſe a digreſſive note, from the original materials furniſhed by Duclos, III, 26—61, being the informations taken in Oct. 1445, and in 1446, concerning the cauſe of her death. Theſe informations purport that certain words ſpoken by the malicious Jamet de Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, an officer of the dauphin, had penetrated ſo deeply the tender and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly heart of Margaret, as to occaſion her death. Their truth ſhe denied on the perdition of her ſoul; but ſhe would recline on her ſofa, and exclaim, Ah Jamet! Jamet! you have gained your purpoſe. If I die it is on your account, on account of the fair words you have ſpoken of me, without cauſe or reaſon. At other times ſhe would ſay, May I die if I ever wronged my huſband! The ſeneſchal of Poitou, preſent when the latter expreſſion eſcaped, exclaimed, Falſe and wicked ſcoundrel, ſhe dies by your malice! On her death-bed her confeſſor could hardly perſuade her to pardon Jamet: and ſhe cried out, Now he has gained his purpoſe. The words, ſhe ſaid, were the worſt that could be pronounced of a woman, and tended to ruin her in the opinion of the dauphin. Almoſt her laſt expreſſion was, Were it not for my conjugal faith, I ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent that I had ever come to France.</p>
                     <p>On the ſecond examination in 1446, May—Aug. Jamet de Tillay was twice queſtioned; and the queen of France herſelf gave a depoſition. Tillay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that, on entering the chamber of the dauphineſs in the duſk of the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and perceiving to lights, he ſaid it was <hi>grande paillardie</hi> in the officers to ſhew ſuch negligence; denied that he accuſed lady Pregente of managing Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet's amours, as he would not wiſh more chaſtity in his own wife, than he was perſuaded belonged to the dauphineſs; and he offered the duel to any man who would ſay that he had arraigned her honour: denied that he aſſerted that Margaret's illneſs aroſe from love, while he only ſaid that it proceeded from her ſitting up all night, making rondeaux and ballads, (44, 52;) and that ſhe would never have a child while ſhe was ſo fond of ſour apples and vinegar. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied that he ſaid the dauphin did not love his wife becauſe "les baſſes marches ne ſe portoient pas bien." The queen's depoſition proves Tillay to have been a malicious meddling fellow, capable of any falſehood. His ſecond examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion bears that Margaret would compoſe twelve rondeaux in a day; that ſhe ſometimes was laced too tight, at other times too looſe. The fatal words at length appear to have been "Avez vous point vu cette dame-la? Elle a mieux maniere d'une paillarde que d'une grande maitreſſe." "Have you ſeen that lady? She has more the appearance of a harlot than of a great princeſs." He denied that he had ſaid them, and offered the duel; aſſerting that no lady could have more of the appearance of high birth. But the words were confirmed by another witneſs, p. 59.</p>
                     <p>On the whole Margaret was too fond of poetry, and her adventure with Alain Chartier is well known; ſhe was too careleſs of her perſon and manners, and had perhaps a ſecret blemiſh which diſguſted the dauphin. But the character of her huſband, afterwards Louis XI, is of black malignity; and her accuſer was proved to be a "ſcoundrel" and "common liar," qualities which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs recommended him to the ſpecial protection of Louis.</p>

               <p>Meanwhile the diſorders of the country encreaſed, under the miſmanagement of Douglas, and cauſed even the regency of Crichton and Livingſton to be regreted. Among the petty feuds, commemorated in our dubious annals, a diſcord of more importance is introduced. A diſpute ariſing between Lindſay ſon of the earl of Crawford, and Ogilby of Innerquharity, the former was joined by his father, the latter by the earl of Huntley, and a deſperate conflict enſued. Crawford, Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, and Ogilby, were ſlain, with many other gentlemen, and near two hundred of their followers <note n="2" place="bottom">Boyce, lib. XVIII.

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0141700201:217"/>to have induced the king and Douglas to ſuch conceſſions: it was probably now diſcovered by both that the aged experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and abilities, of Crichton were neceſſary to give ſome ſtability, and order, to government, and reſtore greater reſpect to the laws. Douglas ſeems to have found that, by graſping all, he would loſe all; and that the acceſſion of Crichton's talents, and fame, would much ſtrengthen the power of his adminiſtration. It alſo appears that Crichton had never been cordially united with Livingſton, but had from neceſſity only conſented to concord; and now when the death of the queen-mother had left Livingſton deſtitute of ſtrong influence, he ungenerouſly made his peace with Douglas, by the ſacrifice of his colleague. It has ſurpriſed ſome that Douglas ſatiated his revenge upon Livingſton and his family, who were innocent of the murder of his two relations; and that Crichton was never charged with that aſſaſſination: but it is reaſonable to infer that there were powerful motives for this conduct; the king himſelf had been preſent at the murder, and in the jealouſy of his authority might conſider it as a matter rather too delicate for diſcuſſion; Douglas might have had little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to condemn an action, which laid the foundation of his power; and the intention of which was perhaps not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to his father, who might otherwiſe have immediately inſtigated the whole force of the houſe of Douglas againſt the government <note n="4" place="bottom">Yet the violence of Livingſton to the queen in 1439, (ſee a note on that year,) indicates the tyranny of his character; and he might be the chief inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gator of the aſſaſſination of the Douglaſes.</note>.</p>
               <p>The earl of Douglas was, about this time, created lieutenant general of the kingdom <note n="5" place="bottom">Abercr. II, 333. The Acts, f. 28, mention a lord lieutenant in 1449.</note>; an office of extreme power, which had been held by one of his predeceſſors at the commencement
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0141700201:218"/>of this reign. He now reſolved upon the perdition of the family of Livingſton, which had only done its duty to the king and kingdom, by oppoſing the exorbitant influence of the houſe of Douglas. Accordingly Sir Alexander Livingſton, formerly keeper of the king's perſon, James his eldeſt ſon, Robert and David Livingſtons, and Sir James Dundas, and Sir Robert Bruce, connected with the family, were committed to ſeveral priſons: but Sir Alexander, and the two other knights, Dundas, and Bruce, were delivered upon paying large ſums of money: the others were tried and beheaded <note n="6" place="bottom">Boyce, lib.

The ſaintly imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility of Henry VI, and the cabals of the queen's party, and that of the duke of Glouceſter, diſtracted the government, and rendered the ſubjects unruly and diſaffected.

                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:0141700201:219"/>Ravages of ſuch importance called greater powers into action; <note place="margin">1448</note> and the battle of Sark, ſo called from a river in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandale, terminated the difference in a manner advantageous to the Scots. Unfortunately we have no Engliſh, nor Scotiſh contemporary account of this battle, the only one which occurs between the nations for a long period of time. When at the diſtance of near a century we find records of this action, the Engliſh paſs it in complete ſilence, and the Scots too much ſwell their victory. The accounts of Jean Chartier, and Monſtrelet, ſeem to deſerve the preference; but even there the number appear to be exaggerated. According to the French hiſtorians, the Engliſh, to the number of fifteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, conducted by the earl of Huntinndon and lord Percy, apparently wardens of the marches, entered Scotland by the weſtern border, and advanced ſix miles into the country. The earl of Douglas haſtily advanced, with only ſix thouſand, attacked the enemy in the open field; conquered, and took the two generals captives. Upon the tidings of this defeat, the earl of Saliſbury, who was lord lieutenant of the north of England, raiſed an army of ſixty thouſand, and ſent this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable force to invade Scotland. Douglas, and his brother Ormond, with thirty-two thouſand men, attacked the Engliſh by ſurprize, and put them to a total route; with the incredible loſs of between twenty and twenty-four thouſand, taken and
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0141700201:220"/>ſlain. The Scots then entered England, and ravaged the country as far as Newcaſtle <note n="8" place="bottom">The reader will in vain conſult the Engliſh hiſtorians for this battle, the only one of importance, from that of Halidon 1402 to that Flodden 1513. Harding, Caxton, Julian Notary, Fabian, Hall, Leland, Coll. 1, 494, even the copious Holinſhed, are equally ſilent. But the Engliſh hiſtory, 1422—1509, is very defective.
<p>Monſtrelet, III, f. 8, edit. 1518, derives his account from the great chronicle of St. Denis; and ſays that three Scotiſh prieſts of the dioceſe of Dunblane, related it upon oath before the chronicler of France at St. Denis. He dates it 1449; but the truces of that year, and the ſilence of Rymer in 1448, ſupport the date commonly aſſigned by our hiſtorians. The battle of Sark alſo occurs, Cont. of Bowar, 519; and the war between England and Scotland in Jean Chartier, p. 142, who, p. 146, narrates the battle of Sark in the ſame way with Monſtrelet, but with many corroborative circumſtances. For Huntingdon he ſeems rightly to put Sir Thomas Harrington. Jean Chartier was himſelf <hi>Chantre</hi> of St. Denis. Add that the chronicle of Zanfliet of Liege, who wrote in 1461, bears at 1450 that the Scots invaded England, and took great prey, but he dates this the ſame year that James wedded Mary of Gelder: col. 471, in Martene's Anecdota.</p>
                     <p>Among the unpubliſhed pieces of Rymer, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 4610, there are ſome articles tending to confirm this war. Art. 14, 3 Feb. 1449, is a commiſſion to Clif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Scrope, &amp;c. on march affairs, mentioning the <hi>malicious purpoſe</hi> of the Scots; <hi>Saliſbury</hi> was warden of the weſtern marches. Art. 15, ſame date, ſame effect; the Scots are ill-diſpoſed to England, and annoy the marches: Henry excuſes the nonattendance of theſe peers in the parliament to meet 12th Feb. (1449, Parl. Hiſt. II, 250.) Art. 9, 8 July 1449, is a commiſſion to the biſhop of Chicheſter, and lord Beaumont, to treat for <hi>abſtinence of war,</hi> or a truce. Art. 10 to ſame effect, 27 Aug. 1449.</p>

In the courſe of a week her nuptials, and coronation, were celebrated with much barbaric pomp <note n="4" place="bottom">De Coucy, 574, ſeq The more minute parts, illuſtrative of manners and cuſtoms, are reſerved for that department.

                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:0141700201:224"/>The victories of Douglas had afforded little compenſation to Scotland for his tyranny and oppreſſion, which ſeemed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in proportion to the continuance of his power. For him, and his followers, there was no law, and the country groaned under the moſt deſtructive anarchy. But the ſix heavy years of his authority were ſoon to expire; and different circumſtances were already preparing to leſſen his influence. The charms and ſenſe of the queen began to infuſe a more manly character into her huſband, to arouſe him from his lethargy, and to form a party capable of undermining the odious power of Douglas.</p>
               <p>James II may now be ſaid to have aſſumed a permanent character, of which the delineation ſhall be here attempted, as far as barren and ſcanty materials will admit. His actions proclaim him a prince of deciſive, and ſometimes even violent, ſpirit. In war he was a valiant and popular leader; and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed his father in a marked attention to military diſcipline. Negligent of pomp, the equal of every ſoldier, he ſhared the mean repaſt of the march, confident that poiſon is ſeldom adminiſtered in vaſſels of wood, repoſing abſolute faith in the love of his people <note n="5" place="bottom">Mair, 326.</note>. The power of his ablities, the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of his intentions in peace, are beſt diſplayed by the laws of his reign, always the moſt inſtructive an valuable portion of hiſtory. His wiſdom appears conſpicuous, in his reverence for the counſels of the wiſe, in guiding his moſt important actions by the experience of Crichton, and the benign and patriotic prudence of Kennedy. The perdition of the ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic and tyrannic houſe of Douglas was to be a ſpirited exertion of juſtice to himſelf, and to his people. But that any fixed plan yet exiſted, for the deſtruction of the ariſtocracy, ſeems a refined theory, incongruous with the ignorance and ſpirit
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0141700201:225"/>and manners of the times; and is beſt confuted by the plain facts, that the families abaſed are ever remarkable for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant crimes, and that the property, and power, which were withdrawn from one houſe, were ever to be beſtowed on another. Even when Louis XI, and Henry VII, were, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the termination of this century, in countries of greater civilization, and political ſcience, to humble the ariſtocracy, an unprejudiced reader will be ready to infer that the events proceed rather from chance, and circumſtances, and the rota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſociety, than from deſign. As to the perſon of the ſecond James, we only know, that it was robuſt; and that a red tinge, which deformed one of his cheeks, gave him the vulgar appellation of James with the fiery face <note n="6" place="bottom">Mair, 322. "James with the red cheek, or with the fire in his face." Chronicle end of Winton, MS. Reg. 17DXX.</note>.</p>
               <p>The truce with England had been, in May, renewed for a very ſhort time; and among the commiſſioners named to prolong it, in September, we find Livingſton, who had been again taken into favour, and appointed juſticiary of Scotland: a circumſtance which appears to preſent a proof that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of Douglas was much on the decline. At length, in Novermber, a truce of a new and ſingular complexion was ratified, bearing no certain term, but that either monarch might violate it, when he pleaſed, upon giving a notice of one hundred and eighty days <note n="7" place="bottom">Rymer, XI, 229, 231, 235, 247. Sir Alex. Livingſton of Calendar, juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary of Scotland, occurs p. 235.

Rymer's Unp. Papers, 4610, art. 49.</note>.</p>
               <p>One of the laſt traces of the power of Douglas occurs in the decrees of a parliament, held at Edinburgh, this year, and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0141700201:226"/>probably in the early part of it. The ſheriffs are therein or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to cauſe reſtitution be made of any ſtolen effects: if they ſhould refuſe, or be negligent, or partial, the complainant is to apply to the king's lieutenant, who is to puniſh the ſheriffs as if they were the robbers: and they are to be treated as thoſe who diſobey the king's acts, given under the royal ſeal, and decreed by the lieutenant, and the three eſtates <note n="8" place="bottom">Acts, f. 28, 20 Jan. 1449, regni 13—1450. Yet this parliament, being diſtinct in the acts from that of Jan. 1449-50, ſeems to belong to 1449.</note>. It would appear, from this ordinance, that the office of lieutenant ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the kingdom wanted little of being a ſole regency.</p>
               <p>This dangerous dignity certainly fell, ſoon after the marriage of the king: and Douglas retired from the court, attended with the execrations of the people. It is ſaid that Sir Richard Colville, having ſuffered repeated injuries from Auchinleck, a follower of Douglas, thought he might now venture upon revenge; which he completed in the ſlaughter of his enemy. Douglas, irritated at this inſult offered to his fallen power, ravaged the lands of Colville, beſieged his caſtle, took it, and left not one inhabitant alive <note n="9" place="bottom">Boyce, lib. XVIII, Lindſay's tranſl. 54.</note>. That age, in the true ſpirit of chivalry, praiſed the earl's exertion of friendſhip: at preſent this action appears in its real colours, as a ſanguinary revenge, as a contempt of juſtice, as an inſult to the laws, and to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; and as peculiarly diſgraceful to him who had been the ſecond magiſtrate in the kingdom.</p>
               <p>The commencement of the king's active authority was ſignalized by a memorable parliament, <note place="margin">1450 Jan.</note> held at Edinburgh, in which a great number of ſalutary regulations were iſſued <note n="1" place="bottom">Acts, f. 28—31. This may be the ſame with the former; but is here, f. v. 28, dated 19 Jan. 1449.</note>. It is ordained that a general peace be proclaimed through all
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0141700201:227"/>the realm, ſo that all men might travel in ſecurity, without any protection, ſave that of the king's peace; and if any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſtand in fear of another he may have <hi>borrowes of peace,</hi> that is a pledge for his good behaviour: that juſt, and able, judges be appointed: that the juſticiary ſhall paſs twice through the country in the year, as ordered by the ancient laws: that any rebellion againſt the king be puniſhed according to its nature, and by the advice of the three eſtates; and if any openly rebel, or make war upon the king's ſubjects, in defiance of his prohibition, the king ſhall advance againſt them with the whole force of the land, if neceſſary, and puniſh them according to their deſerts. Theſe unuſual ordinances ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently paint the diſorders, into which the bad adminiſtration of Douglas had thrown the kingdom. Other ſtatutes decree, that if any perſon aſſiſt thoſe who ſhall be brought to juſtice, he ſhall be puniſhed equally with the tranſgreſſors: that the warden of the marches ſee that the truce be ſtrictly obſerved, and appoint ſuch officers as he ſhall anſwer for: that admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrators of law, who wilfully tranſgreſs, ſhall loſe their office for a year, and be fined: that deſpoilers be compelled to make full, and ſpeedy, reſtitution, pay all expences, and a fine to the king: that the juſticiary or juſtice general, the chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, the coroners, and other officers obliged to travel through the country, have but a moderate attendance, that they may not annoy the people: that foreſtallers of corn be puniſhed, and the corn forfeited to the king; and that even the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors of grain keep no more than is neceſſary for their annual conſumption, and ſell the remainder in open market at the current price.</p>
               <p>Above all, one remarkable act of this parliament deſerves attention, being conceived in the following terms. "It is ordained that if any man, as God forbid, commit or do treaſon
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0141700201:228"/>againſt the king's perſon, or his majeſty, or riſe in war againſt him, or lay hands upon his perſon violently, of whatever age the king be, young, or old; or receive any that have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted treaſon, or that ſupply them with help or advice, or garriſon the houſe of them who are convicted of treaſon, and hold their houſes againſt the king, or garriſon houſes of their own in aſſiſtance of the king's rebels, or that aſſault caſtles, or places where the king's perſon ſhall happen to be, without the conſent of the three eſtates, ſhall be puniſhed as traitors <note n="2" place="bottom">Acts, f. v. 30, c. 25.</note>." This ſtatute has occaſioned altercations between the favourers of monarchy, and thoſe who attach ideas of freedom to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of the middle ages, when the only diſpute lay between monarchy and ariſtocracy.</p>
               <p>It was further ordained that all the regalities, in the royal poſſeſſion, ſhould be judged by the king's juſticiary; and the freeholders of ſuch regalities ſhould appear in parliament, equally with thoſe of the royal domains <note n="3" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. As many large eſtates had fallen to the crown, in the preceding reign, this meaſure ſeems intended to increaſe the king's influence in parliament: and ſuch was the ſpirit of the times that, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the power of the ſovereign, was to enlarge the freedom and happineſs of the people, labouring under the worſt tyranny, that of a feudal ariſtocracy. Other prudent ſtatutes concern the puniſhment of robbery, the regulation of the coin, and the penalties of contumacy againſt the courſe of juſtice <note n="4" place="bottom">Ibid. f. 29, 31.</note>. Such laws ſhine like a coruſcation amid the night of barbariſm; but, it is believed, imparted little of vital heat to the political atmoſphere. It is eaſy to form good laws: the difficulty lies in the execution. The chief felicity of a nation is to have few laws, and to be accuſtomed to obey them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:0141700201:229"/>Douglas, diſguſted at the loſs of his power, or wiſhing to diſplay his pomp in foreign countries, paſſed to the jubilee at Rome, with a train of ſix knights, fourteen gentlemen, and eighty attendants <note n="5" place="bottom">Cont. of Bowar, 519. Mair, 322. The number is eſtimated from the ſafe conduct, granted to him on his return by Henry VI, 12 Nov. 1450; Rymer, XI, 277. In the jubilee of 1450 innumerable people crouded to Rome; and ninety-ſeven were killed by the preſs, at the end of the bridge of St. Angelo, De Coucy, 608.</note>. In his abſence many complaints were made againſt the inſolence of his dependents: the earl of Orkney, a nobleman of princely munificence, reſpectable for his talents, and patronage of letters, was ſent to examine the abuſes, and was inſulted: the king, juſtly enraged, proceeded in perſon with a ſufficient force, took the caſtle of Lochmaben, and demoliſhed that of Douglas <note n="6" place="bottom">Boyce, lib. XVIII, Lindſay's tranſl. 55, 56. Hume's Houſe of Douglas, I, 336—339. Doubtful, for the caſtle appears in 1454.
<p>In 1456, at the inſtance of William Sinclair earl of Orkney and Caithneſs, chancellor of Scotland, Sir Gilbert Hay tranſlated Bonet's then popular book, L'Arbre des Batailies, as appears from the prologue publiſhed by Dr. Mackenzie in his Lives of Scotiſh Writers.

                  </note>. Upon his return from Rome Douglas ſent a ſubmiſſive meſſage to the king; and as he could not, in equity, be reputed guilty of events which happened during his abſence, and for which a ſufficient puniſhment had been taken, he was graciouſly received <note n="7" place="bottom">Boyce, lib.

                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:0141700201:230"/>A commiſſion was granted by James to Douglas, <note place="margin">1451 April</note> and other embaſſadors, to confer with thoſe of England, concerning any breaches of the truce <note n="8" place="bottom">Rymer, XI, 283.</note>. But the earl certainly did not deſerve this confidence, being engaged in a ſecret plan of revenge againſt his ſovereign; and in the following month hi obtained from the Engliſh court a protection for himſelf, his three brothers, twenty-ſix gentlemen, and ſixty-ſeven attendants <note n="9" place="bottom">Ibid.

               <p>Meanwhile Douglas proceeded in his diſorderly, and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, practices. He attempted, as is ſaid, to aſſaſſinate
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0141700201:231"/>Crichton; <note place="margin">1451</note> who eſcaped, and afterwards had nearly ſurprized Douglas, then lodging in Edinburgh with a ſmall train <note n="3" place="bottom">Boyce lib.

Livingſton ſeems to have died about 1450.</note>. The lands of John Herries, a gentleman of eminent loyalty, being ravaged by ſome followers of Douglas, he complained to the earl without effect, and in revenge ravaged a part of Annandale: but he was taken, and hanged by the command of Douglas, in contempt of the king's prohibitory mandate <note n="4" place="bottom">Boyce, lib.

               <p>Theſe appear trivial offence, when compared with a grand meaſure now entered into by Douglas, and which threatened deſtruction to the king, and the kingdom. As Douglas was by far the moſt powerful noble of the ſouth of Scotland, or rather a petty ſovereign in that department, ſo Alexander Lindſay earl of Crawford, and John earl of Roſs, lord of the Iſles, held the higheſt authority in the north. The policy, and vengeance, of Douglas conciliated a league with theſe potent nobles, ſtrictly obliging all the parties to mutual defence againſt every injury <note n="5" place="bottom">Ibid. Lindſay adds the earl of Moray, who was the brother of Douglas, and before in the ſtricteſt union with him. Compare Mair, 323, who only mentions Crawford.
<p>In July 1451 Douglas had reſigned moſt of his lands into the king's hands, and procured new charters, "notwithſtanding any crimes of forfeitry," &amp;c. committed by him or his uncle Archibald. Scotſt. Cal.</p>
                  </note>; and to ſuch a conjunction the laws themſelves were injuries. The monarch trembled at this confederacy, the power of which was in fact ſuperior to the royal authority; but he reſolved to diſſemble for a ſeaſon,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0141700201:232"/>though the nation, in a juſt alarm, already beheld the king dethroned, and the country paſſing, from ariſtocratic tyranny and diſcord, into a ſubjection to foreign dominion.</p>
               <p>An incident however ſoon occurred, <note place="margin">1452</note> which haſtened the execution of the royal vengeance. Douglas had perſuaded or overawed moſt of his vaſſals, eſpecially thoſe in Galloway, Kyle, Carrick, Cunningham, and the diſtricts adjacent, into an engagement of attendance, and aid, even againſt the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign himſelf. But a few of the more moderate, and prudent, were averſe to ſuch illegal ties; and among theſe was diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed Maclelan, guardian of the heir of Bomby, and a near relation of Sir Patrick Gray, who was ſon of lord Gray, and captain of the king's guard, an office of the greateſt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence <note n="6" place="bottom">Among ſome ſlight variations, Lindſay has inſerted this ſtory in his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Boyce, p. 61—64, and its <hi>naif</hi> veracity is far remote from the manner of Boyce. In p. 81—87 is another ſimilar interpolation, afterwards to be uſed. The royal guard now appears for the firſt time, perhaps in imitation of the Scotiſh guards of France eſtabliſhed about 1440.</note>. The earl of Douglas, irritated at Maclelan's obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy in rectitude, ſuddenly beſieged his houſe, took it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed the owner to the caſtle of Douglas, <note n="7" place="bottom">Yet according to the fabulous Boyce it was demoliſhed in 1450.</note> and threw him into ſtrict durance. Upon hearing this, Sir Patrick Gray laid the affair before the king, and inſtantly obtained a mild letter, rather of ſupplication than of command, requeſting Douglas to deliver the priſoner to Gray. The earl was ſitting at dinner in the caſtle of Douglas, when he was told that Gray, a familiar ſervant of the king, was at the gate; and, in ſome ſurprize, aroſe to receive him with much apparent civility, and invited him to partake of the repaſt. During the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the table, Douglas was revolving what Gray's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion could be; and gueſſing the truth gave a ſecret order,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0141700201:233"/>in conſequence of which the priſoner was led to a green beſide the caſtle, where his head was ſtruck off, and taken away, and a cloth was ſpread over the body. The meal ended, Gray produced the royal letter, which was received with all the reſpect of fraud; and the earl having peruſed it ſaid, "I am beholden to you for bringing me ſo gracious a letter from the king, eſpecially conſidering how matters ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us at preſent. The demand ſhall inſtantly be granted, and the more favourably for your ſake." He then took Gray by the hand, and led him to the green, where removing the cloth, Douglas coldly ſaid: "Sir Patrick, you are come a little too late. This is your ſiſter's ſon, but he wants the head. Take his body, and do with it what you will." Gray replied in anguiſh, "My lord, ſince you have taken his head, you may diſpoſe of his body:" then calling for his horſes he mounted, and ſaid to the earl, "My lord, if I live, you ſhall be rewarded for your preſent labour, according to your demerits." Douglas, enraged at this threat, called for his horſe; but Sir Patrick by the goodneſs of his led ſteed eſcaped the purſuit, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended near to Edinburgh.</p>
               <p>The king irritated beyond meaſure at ſuch repeated inſults, aggravated by the moſt ſanguinary cruelty, and the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate contempt of the laws; and anxious to prevent the effects of the formidable league formed againſt his authority, called a choſen council to deliberate upon the meaſures to be followed. It was reſolved, in order to avoid the horrors of civil war, that Douglas ſhould be inveigled into court by flattery, and upon pretence that the king forgave his paſt enormities, and only deſired him to reform his future conduct <note n="8" place="bottom">Boyce, lib. XVIII, Lindſay, 64.</note>. <note place="margin">22 Jan.</note> About this time a paſſport was obtained from the Engliſh king, for Douglas,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0141700201:234"/>his brother James, and lord Hamilton, joined with Crichton, Montgomery, Gray, three biſhops, and others, to go in pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage to Canterbury <note n="9" place="bottom">Rymer, XI, 303.</note>. This ſafe conduct was apparently never uſed; and Douglas and his enemies are ſo ſtrangely blended in it, that there is room to ſuſpect that, under the pretext of a pilgrimage of mutual repentance and conciliation, a ſcheme had been formed to aſſail Douglas, when in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenceleſs garb of a pilgrim.</p>
               <p>However this be, the earl was prevailed upon, towards the beginning of lent, which this year happened in the end of February, to viſit the court at the caſtle of Stirling <note n="1" place="bottom">Lindſay, p. 64, ſays that, according to the report of ſome, Douglas ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a ſafe conduct from James under the great ſeal. Hume I, 351, aſſerts this as fact: and p. 361 he mentions that this ſafe conduct was contumeliouſly dragged at a horſe's tail, after the aſſaſſination. That author's prejudices may be doubted: yet Leſley and Buchanan confirm the ſafe conduct.</note>. After Supper, the king taking him apart into a ſecret chamber, where only ſome of the privy council, and the guard, were in attendance, mildly informed him that he had heard of the league with Crawford, and other nobles; and deſired him to break ſuch illegal engagements. Douglas proudly refuſed, and had the arrogance to upbraid the king with his procedures againſt him, which had forced him, as he aſſerted, to form this confederacy. The ſenſe of repeated inſults, and of an outrageous contempt of his authority, conſpired with the preſent perſonal affront, to kindle a flame of inſtantaneous fury; and the monarch exclaiming, "If you will not break this league, by God I ſhall," drew his dagger, and ſtabbed Douglas. Sir Patrick Gray then ſtruck the earl with a battle ax, and the wound was inſtantly mortal <note n="2" place="bottom">Mair, 323. Boyce, lib. XVIII, Lindſay's tranſl. 64—66. Hume's Dougl.

Then collecting their force, and returning, they burned the town <note n="3" place="bottom">Mair 323 imputes this act to lord Hamilton. Compare Hume I, 362.</note>. Two of their own name were extremely obnoxious, becauſe they were loyal, the earl of Angus, and Sir John Douglas of Dalkeith: the caſtle of the latter they beſieged in vain.

Not to pretend any title to the earl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Wigton, except with the queen's conſent: 2. Nor to the lands of Stewarton, a part of the patrimony of the ducheſs of Touraine, his mother: 3. To abandon in future all hatred, or enmity, againſt all perſons: 4. To preſerve the public peace, and make compenſations to perſons already injured: 5. To obſerve the ſtricteſt duty and reſpect to the king. This inſtrument was ſigned by Douglas, and lord Hamilton, for themſelves and their adherents <note n="7" place="bottom">Ruddiman, notes to Buchanan 441, 442, from a copy in the Advocates Library.

               <p>The public tranquility being completely reſtored, <note place="margin">1453</note> the earl of Douglas, the abbot of melros, and Robert Liddel of Bali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, proceeded on an embaſſy to England, <note place="margin">April</note> to prolong the truce, which would otherwiſe have expired in 1454.

                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:0141700201:238"/>The deepeſt obſcurity impends even over the latter part of the reign of James II, <note place="margin">1454</note> and it is almoſt impoſſible to enlighten the events with the clear colours of chronology. Amid this uncertainty, the moſt probable plan of arrangement ſhall be followed, and committed to the candour of the reader.</p>
               <p>The death of Crichton, the chancellor, who had long mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated public affairs, ſeems to have opened the way to the ſucceeding tumults <note n="3" place="bottom">Crawford, Off. 30, dates his death 1455, and is followed by Douglas. Yet Crawford, 34, ſays Orkney was made chancellor on the death of Crichton; and the former now appears in that capacity. See in Abercr. II, 430, the fabulous titles of Orkney. So in 1764, Douglas, Peerage 185, ſtyles William of Nithſdale <hi>prince of Danſkin,</hi> (Dantzic;) <hi>and lord of Spruce,</hi> (Pruſſia)! Theſe gentlemen ſeem ignorant that foreign countries have hiſtorians.</note>. Meanwhile the Engliſh government complaining of depredations on the frontiers, the biſhop of Brechin, <note place="margin">June</note> and the earl of Orkney chancellor, were appointed embaſſadors to adjuſt the grievances <note n="4" place="bottom">Rymer, XI, 349.</note>: and ſoon after a ſafe conduct appears to Beatrix, <note place="margin">16 June</note> counteſs of Douglas, widow of James the Groſs, and Margaret widow of William, with John Douglas lord of Balveny, on pretence of a pilgrimage to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, but probably to form treaſonable connections between their family and that country <note n="5" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. The conteſts between the houſes of York and Lancaſter had now commenced; and the duke of York being, at this period, poſſeſſed of the ſupreme power, he favoured the houſe of Douglas, in oppoſition to James, who, in conjunction with France, ſupported the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of Henry.</p>
               <p>Crawford, who had joined in the bond which proved fatal to the late earl of Douglas, had been puniſhed with forfeiture, but was pardoned on ſubmiſſion <note n="6" place="bottom">Boyce, lib. XVIII, puts a fabulous oration into the mouth of Crawford, which Lindſay, 73—78, enlarges with family affection.</note>. Yet Moray and Ormond,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0141700201:239"/>the brothers of Douglas, again excited a rebellion in the north, and ravaged the lands of Huntley and other loyal perſons. Huntley aſſembling his followers gave half of Elgin to the flames, becauſe that part of the town ſupported Moray: and, though defeated at Dunkinty, he raiſed freſh troops, and forced the Douglaſes, Moray and Ormond, to leave the north of Scotland, and take ſhelter in the Hebudes, whence they proceeded to join their brother in his grand rebellion <note n="7" place="bottom">Compare Boyce lib. XVIII, Lindſay's tranſlation 69, with Hume's Doug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſes I, 366. But the events of 1452 are intermixed.</note>. <note place="margin">autumn</note>
               </p>
               <p>To underſtand this rebellion aright, it ſeems neceſſary to throw a brief glance on the affairs of England. In the end of the preceding year Henry VI, a prince whoſe weakneſs ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his whole reign one minority, had fallen into a ſtate of inſanity; and Richard duke of York had been ſoon after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared protector of the realm. As James was ever firmly attached to Henry, and evinced on ſubſequent occaſions an eagerneſs to ſupport his intereſts, there is reaſon to infer that York excited, or favoured, the rebellion of Douglas, in order to prevent James from an interference in the affairs of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Nor in caſe of the ſucceſs of Douglas, in driving James from his throne, would the example have been unuſeful to the deſigns of York; nor the ſupreme power of Douglas in Scotland unimportant to his purpoſes. The intercourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween York and Douglas appears to have been mediated by Beatrix, the mother of the latter, and John lord Balveny his brother, who as is abovementioned had proceeded to England; and who were afterwards ſpecially included in the forfeiture of the family, for deſigns on the Scotiſh monarchy ſupported by Engliſh influence.</p>
               <p>When to the aid of York are added the internal cauſes, the native ambition of the houſe of Douglas, unſatiated even by
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0141700201:240"/>the higheſt honours of regal favour; its latent but deep en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, excited by the deſtruction of two of its chiefs, during the preſent reign, and by other injuries and mortifications; its conſciouſneſs that no monarch could ever ſincerely pardon a family, which formed one nurſery of rebellion, which deſpiſed the laws, and rivalled the throne; its apprehenſions, from the recent ruin of its power in the north, that if effectual reſiſtance were not inſtantly oppoſed, the annihilation of the ſtem and other branches might follow; when theſe conſiderations are weighed, the ſources of this grand rebellion may not perhaps appear obſcure. The inflammatory principles had long exiſted, and were deeply and widely ſcattered: the power of York, the money and protection of England, the overthrow of Moray and Ormond, and the conſequent ſtings of apprehenſion and revenge, were only temporary circumſtances, which ſet fire to the train that ſhook Scotland to its centre.</p>
               <p>Such appear to have been the cauſes of this grand rebellion, which threatened to overturn the Scotiſh throne, and which our elder writers ignorantly conſider as a prolongation of that which aroſe in 1452, on the aſſaſſination of William earl of Douglas; but which as is evident from original documents above adduced, was wholly extinguiſhed in that year. Later writers have either followed their example, in confounding diſtinct events; or have, under the general term of England, blended the remote, and oppoſite, intereſts of York and of Henry. They alſo tell us that, ſoon after the death of the former earl, Beatrix his mother, and Margaret the fair maid of Galloway his widow, took refuge in England: that Doug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las accepted the embaſſy, in the view of ſecuring the hand of Margaret, whoſe domains were large; and, in order to obtain a diſpenſation, he afterwards procured a ſafe conduct for a
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0141700201:241"/>pretended pilgrimage to Rome <note n="8" place="bottom">The ſafe conduct is for four years; and might be intended as a reſource in caſe the rebellion failed; and whether Henry or York ſhould happen to be in power.</note>. That a diſpenſation being refuſed, he nevertheleſs wedded Margaret, who in diſguſt fled to the Scotiſh king; and he beſtowing her in marriage on his uterine brother Athole, the conſequence was a civil war. But there is no evidence that James now earl of Douglas wedded his brother's widow: or that ſhe returned to Scotland before the ruin of the family. The ſame writers, who ſtate this affair as the origin of the war, alſo aſſert that Douglas and his brothers were, in July this year, ſummoned before a parliament, to anſwer for their crimes; and upon nonappear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, were declared rebels and forfeited. This latter circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance would of itſelf preſent a ſufficient cauſe of the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but the difficulty in the account of theſe authors conſiſts in diſcovering what new crimes the houſe of Douglas had committed; and the act of forfeiture, 1455, is infallibly the firſt and ſole act againſt the family, as is clear from the records.</p>
               <p>The facts and authorities, about to be adduced, will be found unanimous in the ſupport of the previous obſervations above given. Nor is there any evidence that James had plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the ruin of the potent family of Douglas, as theoretic writers would infer; for he was unprepared, and trembled at the impending danger. The inſtrument of Auguſt 1452, the honourable embaſſy of the following year, indicate complete reconciliation; and though embers of jealouſy might at this ſeaſon be revived, by the ruin of Moray and Ormond, and by the king's interference in fruſtrating the earl's deſign to wed his brother's widow, yet the ambition of Douglas, joined with
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0141700201:242"/>the other cauſes above mentioned, will to a candid mind ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear the chief ſprings of this memorable conteſt.</p>
               <p>Unfortunately there is not, for its commencement in the autumn of this year, that clear evidence which attends its termination in the next. The firſt events reſt upon doubtful and inaccurate authorities, the uſe of which neceſſity alone can vindicate; and all that can be done is to ſelect the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, and probable, circumſtances, omitting ſuch as are contradicted by the genuine records of the enſuing year.</p>
               <p>It appears that James, diſcovering the treaſonable correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence carried on by Douglas in England, and ſuſpecting his deſigns, ſent an herald to ſummon him to appear before the privy council, or perhaps the parliament. Far from ſhewing obedience that potent earl ſent ſecret meſſengers to affix, in the night, placards upon the church-doors of Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, charging the king with the murder of the two chiefs of the houſe of Douglas, and replete with inſulting expreſſions <note n="9" place="bottom">Boyce lib. XVIII, Lindſay's tranſl. 70.</note>.</p>
               <p>Inſtantly aſſembling a ſmall array, James ravaged ſome lands belonging to Douglas. It being the time of harveſt, the king not only felt repugnance in deſtroying the corn, but could not, except in the moſt urgent neceſſity, harraſs his ſubjects by aſſembling a large force: he therefore returned; and, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſing a part of his followers, he ordered the remainder to beſiege Abercorn, a ſtrong caſtle belonging to Douglas, and which, from its proximity to the capital, was an object of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar jealouſy <note n="1" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.</p>
               <p>Yet the ſuddenneſs of the attack on his domains had ſo much alarmed Douglas, who little expected ſuch promptitude, that he withdrew to the borders; whence he ſent lord Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0141700201:243"/>into England to requeſt York's aſſiſtance; and a ſum of money was immediately remitted <note n="2" place="bottom">Boyce, lib. XVIII, Lindſay 81. After this the incidents of 1454 are better authenticated by the ſecond, and laſt, large interpolation of Lindſay 81—87.</note>.</p>
               <p>The circumſtances of Douglas were now reduced to that criſis, that the only choice lay between a bold exertion of his whole ſtrength, in the ardent execution of great and extreme meaſures, or a patient ſubmiſſion to total ruin. Reinforced by the pecuniary ſupply from England, by the imagined fidelity of vaſſals long oppreſſed, by the martial influence of that name, which a ſucceſſion of heroes had rendered the trumpet of war, he reſolved to oppoſe his power in the open field to that of the king. The armed force, that would ariſe at the call of Doug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, was eſtimated at forty thouſand men; moſt of them from their ſituation near the borders, and conſtant exerciſe in fight, far ſuperior to any other troops of Scotland.</p>
               <p>James had ſent the earls of Orkney and Angus, with ſix thouſand men, to beſiege the caſtle of Abercorn, when Doug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las ſummoned all his force to meet him at Douglas, on the tenth day, with proviſion for twenty days, to paſs with him to Abercorn, there to reſcue the fortreſs; or give the king battle, and force him to fight, or to leave the kingdom. Surprized at this intelligence, the king juſtly diſtruſting the ſouth of Scotland, the chief ſeat of the power of Douglas, paſſed in a ſhip to St. Andrews; and his deſpair even ſuggeſted to him an intention to abandon Scotland. But the prudent and reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able biſhop of that ſee, James Kennedy, a ſon of the counteſs of Angus daughter of Robert III, inſinuated motives of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, and of courage. By his advice the king iſſued pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, ſummoning the array of the north, and offering amneſty to all who ſhould now join his ſervice: and in a few days a conſiderable force arrived; the royal banner was raiſed
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0141700201:244"/>in St. Andrews; and the army marched to Falkland in order of battle. Entering Stirling, attended by the barons of Fife, Strathern, and Angus, James remained there, till the more northern troops ſhould approach; and, upon their junction, he found himſelf at the head of forty thouſand men. He then advanced againſt Douglas, whoſe army, amounting to near forty thouſand, (among whom Hamilton, at the head of three hundred horſe, and as many choſen infantry, was to render himſelf remarkable,) had encamped on the ſouth ſide of the Carron, in his march towards Abercorn.</p>
               <p>A battle was believed inevitable, which was to decide whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther James, or Douglas, ſhould have the dominion of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. But biſhop Kennedy, anxious to prevent the effuſion of blood, had attended the royal army, and now ſent a ſecret meſſage to Hamilton, his nephew, aſſuring him, in the king's name, not only of remiſſion, but of high reward, if he would leave Douglas. Hamilton returned rather a favourable anſwer, yet heſitated between the laws of friendſhip, and the advantages of loyalty, when the haughtineſs of Douglas con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired to induce him to embrace the latter. A herald, arriving from the king, charged the rebels to diſperſe, under pain of treaſon: Douglas ſent him back with deriſion; and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately arrayed his hoſt and marched towards the royal army; but ſeeing its ſtrength, and doubting the effect of the proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of amneſty, nay thinking that he perceived its influence in the dubious ſervice, and fallen ſpirit of his people, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted them back into their camp, hoping to reanimate their fidelity and courage, before he led them to battle in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This imprudent procedure was little approved by the barons, and leaders, eſpecially by Hamilton, who immediately went to the earl, and inquired if he intended to give the king battle, or not; affirming at the ſame time that the delay was
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0141700201:245"/>full of danger, as his people were deſerting while the royal army was upon the increaſe. Douglas anſwered, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, "If you are tired, you may depart when you pleaſe;" and Hamilton, that night, paſſed to the king. The other chiefs alarmed at his departure, and ſuſpecting each other, alſo diſbanded; ſo that in the morning Douglas trembled when he beheld a ſilent and deſert camp, not one hundred men remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, beſides thoſe who belonged to his houſehold, or were his immediate ſervants. Upon this unexpected change, the earl fled to Annandale, where he lurked with his brothers till the enſuing ſpring. In this ſurprizing manner fell for ever the enormous power of the houſe of Douglas; which had ariſen from patriotic heroiſm; and was conducted to perdition by ariſtocratic tyranny, and the moſt ungrateful rebellion.</p>
               <p>The events of the ſubſequent year are happily illuſtrated by original evidence, <note place="margin">1455</note> and particularly by a letter from James to Charles VII king of France, reciting at ſome length the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the rebellion of Douglas <note n="3" place="bottom">This important letter is publiſhed by D'Achery in his Spicilegium, Vol. III, p. 801, of the new edition by De la Barre, Paris 1723, folio.

               <p>Having ſent Thomas Spence biſhop of Galloway, John lord Lindſay of the Byres, and Dr. Arons archdeacon of Glaſgow, as embaſſadors to France, in order to ſtate the progreſs and decline of the rebellion, James, as ſoon as the ſeaſon permitted the tedious operations of a ſiege, recommenced that of the caſtle of Abercorn, which had been raiſed on the approach of winter.

               <p>
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:0141700201:246"/>While the monarch's arms were thus employed, Douglas, who had hitherto lurked in the borders, fled into England, attended only by four or five perſons. But his brothers, Moray, Ormond, and Balveny, remaining in Euſdale with ſome fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, they harraſſed the adjacent country, till they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eountered by the Scotts, <note place="margin">1 May</note> and other borderers, who completely routed the marauders.

Balveny eſcaped into England <note n="5" place="bottom">Letter of James.</note>.

James then proceeded againſt the caſtles of Strathaven, Douglas, and others belonging to the rebels, all which he took, and deſtroyed even to the foundations.

               <p>Henry VI having in the mean time ſomewhat convaleſced, James had in May deſtined a ſolemn embaſſy to England <note n="9" place="bottom">Rymer, XI, 349: a ſafe conduct 10th May to Kennedy biſhop of St. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews, Livingſton the chamberlain, &amp;c. with 100 attendants.

               <p>Douglas was received with favour by the ruling party in England, and a penſion was granted to him for ſervices to be done, till he could recover his eſtates, ſeized, as the record expreſſes, by the perſon who calls himſelf king of Scotland <note n="3" place="bottom">Rymer, XI, 367.</note>. When ſuch is the language of a period depreſſed by civil war, we no longer wonder at the <hi>truces</hi> between England and Scotland, and that no ſolid pacification could exiſt: the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of Scotland was ever the chief object of the Engliſh kings, and a contemporary writer of that nation heſitates not to prefer its importance to that of France <note n="4" place="bottom">Harding, f. v. 234.</note>; the Scotiſh court well knew that this obſtinately weak and ambitious pretenſion might ſeem to ſleep, but was always alive.</p>

The ordinance proceeds to declare that the whole cuſtoms of the kingdom, as they ſtood at the death of James I, ſhall be veſted in the preſent monarch; and to ſpecify the lands annexed to the crown, among which we ſind Ettrick foreſt, and Galloway, which belonged to the family of Douglas, but no other lands of that houſe ſeem to be mentioned; a circumſtance unaccounted for by our careleſs writers, and which probably aroſe from the other extenſive domains of Douglas being ſhared among the nobles, and others, who aſſiſted in ſuppreſſing the revolt <note n="6" place="bottom">On the 3d July 1455 was a grant to lord Hamilton of the ſheriffdom of Lanark, forfeited by Douglas.

               <p>This parliament further ordered that the office of warden of the marches ſhould not be hereditary: that all regalities in the king's hands be annexed to the royalty, and that no regalities be granted in future without the ſanction of the ſtates: that no office be hereditary, and that all offices granted ſince the death of James I, be revoked except the wardenſhip of the marches beſtowed on the infant Alexander, earl of March, and lord of Annandale, ſecond ſon of the king, and afterwards duke of Albany. It is alſo decreed that, in the boroughs, a council of eight or twelve perſons, according to the extent of the town, be eſtabliſhed, to decide petty ſuits: and that the members of parliament wear particular habits, which are minutely deſcribed <note n="7" place="bottom">Acts, f. 35, 36. Annandale had belonged to Douglas.</note>.</p>
               <p>The national council having again met, on the thirteenth of October, took into conſideration the report of an intended Engliſh invaſion; and gave directions concerning the arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of beacons and other neceſſary preparations. They then ordered that perſons ſuſpected of treaſon ſhould be impriſoned: that none ſhould paſs into England in time of war, without permiſſion, under pain of treaſon: and ſeveral other regulations
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0141700201:251"/>appear, all relating to hoſtilities, but not of ſuch importance as to merit eſpecial conſideration. To the apprehenſion of war was added a more immediate calamity, that of the peſtilence, which extended its ravages through the kingdom, and perhaps preſerved it from any invaſion at this infectious period <note n="8" place="bottom">Ibid. f. 36, 37.</note>.</p>
               <p>If credit be given to the late, <note place="margin">1456</note> and doubtful, accounts of this reign two invaſions of Scotland took place this year.

XVIII, Lindſay's tranſl. 91.</note>.</p>
               <p>From ſuperior authority it appears that James, enraged at the conduct of the Engliſh court in the ſupply and reception of Douglas, entered the north of England, with a large army; but was met at the river Cayle, by two Engliſh embaſſadors, by whoſe arts he was ſo far deceived, as to return, and diſmiſs his forces. The fraud being ſoon diſcovered, the Scotiſh monarch, in twenty days, raiſed a more formidable army than the former, ravaged Northumberland with fire and ſword; levelled many caſtles with the ground; and returned with ſome ſhew of military fame <note n="2" place="bottom">Contin. of Bowar, 520. Mair, 325. Boyce, ever fabulous, ſuppoſes that James was fighting on York's ſide, Lindſay, 99.

<p>Rymer, XI, 383, gives a letter from York, in Henry's name, in anſwer to the defiance of James, ſent by Lion-king at arms. York treats James as an uſurper, claims homage, charges him with depredations, and returns defiance. This letter is dated 26th July 1456, and probably inſtigated the invaſion by James.</p>

                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:0141700201:252"/>Meanwhile Douglas was admitted to the titles of an Engliſh ſubject <note n="3" place="bottom">Rymer, XI, 381.</note>, and continued in that allegiance to the following mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs Edward IV, and Richard III, but in him the family, and the treaſon, were to become extinct.

               <p>A parliament was held at Edinburgh, <note place="margin">19 Oct.</note> which publiſhed a few ordinances regulating the manner of national defence againſt England, the power of the duke of York the enemy of James, and the invaſion of that country, leading the Scots to expect repriſals. Certain rules were eſtabliſhed, concerning thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the peſtilence, which ſtill deſolated the kingdom, being, it is believed, the fifth great viſitation of that horrid contagion. The value of coin, foreign and domeſtic, was conſiderably raiſed, ſo that the Scotiſh money became to the Engliſh as one to three: and ſome abuſes committed by the king's officers, in exacting the cuſtoms at fairs, were repreſſed. The moſt important act, which was however altered in the next parliament, concerns the holding of the ſeſſions, or high court of juſtice, which was ordered to ſit for three months at a
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0141700201:253"/>time; and was to conſiſt of three eminent clergy, three barons, and three commiſſioners of the burghs, to be changed each month; and who were to be ſworn, in the royal preſence, impartially to adminiſter the laws. The inſtructions ſent to France were voted ſufficient, but their purport is unknown <note n="5" place="bottom">Acts, f. v. 37—39.</note>.</p>
               <p>A truce with England, <note place="margin">1457 June</note> where York was no longer in authority, was negociated, and at length concluded at Conventry to laſt till the ſixth day of July 1459 <note n="6" place="bottom">Rymer, XI, 389. York had remained in power till February this year. To counteract him, Margaret propoſed to the court of France that the two daughters of James I, who went thither when the dauphineſs died, ſhould be married to the two ſons of the late duke of Somerſet her partizan. At the ſame time Margaret prevailed on the French king of aſſiſt Scotland againſt the duke of York: and Loheac and Brezé invaded the ſouth of England, and ravaged <hi>Port</hi> (Portſmouth?) De Coucy 709. Carte, II, 750.</note>. The territory imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately appertaining to the earldom of Douglas, with Douglas-dale, and the appendant domains, was now granted to the earl of Angus, in which family, a branch of the former, it was to remain <note n="7" place="bottom">Hume's Dougl.

This meaſure was imprudent, as it raiſed the houſe of Angus to a power little inferior to that of the preceding lineage of Douglas, and which was afterwards too deeply felt in the kingdom: but individuals learn from experience, while nations, and ſucceſſive kings, ſeldom draw wiſdom from former faults.

               <p>The national council, <note place="margin">1458 6 March</note> being ſummoned to Edinburgh, diſtinguiſhed itſelf by enacting a great number of prudent laws. The ordinance of the year 1456, concerning the ſupreme court of judicature, was reviſed; and it was decreed that the ſeſſions were only to continue for forty days at a time, but ſhould be held three times in the year, at three different cities, Edinburgh, Perth, and Aberdeen; that is once a year at each place, in ſucceſſive periods. This court conſiſted, as has above appeared, of committees of parliament; and, from a ſpecification in the act, it ſeems that the Scotiſh parliament did not now exceed one hundred and ninety members <note n="1" place="bottom">Each committee conſiſted of nine members, three clergymen, three barons, three burgeſſes: theſe diſtinct committees in the year amount to twenty-ſeven members; and the act bears that, on this plan, the judicial capacity of each member would not revolve above once in ſeven years, which infers a total of one hundred and eighty-nine.</note>. The rotation of theſe committees of juſtice was a laudable meaſure, and partook more of a free conſtitution, than the foundation of James V, origin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally projected by John duke of Albany, on the model of a French judicatory parliament, after deſpotiſm had tainted the government of France. This inſtitution alſo contributes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to inſtruct us how a French parliament dwindled into a court of law. Particular regulations were enacted, concerning the cauſes to be tried by this court of ſeſſion, and the mode of
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0141700201:255"/>procedure: <note place="margin">1458</note> but it is unjuſtly, and impoliticly, ordered that the members ſhould defray their own expences. Other acts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the regulation of the coin, of the hoſpitals, and of military diſcipline, particularly for the encouragement of archery. A curious ſumptuary law appears, which ſhall be reſerved for future conſideration: and one common rate of meaſure is ordered to be followed through the kingdom. The decrees for the promotion of agriculture deſerve applauſe; they ordain that lands may be let in fee-farm, and that the king ſhall ſet the example; that woods, trees, and hedges, be planted; that wheat, peas, and beans, be regularly ſown; game is recommended to preſervation; wolves, and birds of prey, to deſtruction. A decent and peaceable attendance on the courts of juſtice is enforced: the violent ſeizure of lands is guarded againſt: he who attains the royal remiſſion is, nevertheleſs, to make com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation to the plaintiff for any robbery or ſpoil: negligent, or corrupt, officers of juſtice are to loſe their office, and profits, for a year and a day, if heritable; if not, for ever <note n="2" place="bottom">Acts, f. v. 39.—f. v. 45.</note>.</p>
               <p>The famous ſtatute of James I is confirmed, concerning <hi>leaſing making,</hi> or the propagation of falſehoods between the king and the people <note n="3" place="bottom">Ibid. f. 45, c. 100.</note>; a law perhaps not deſerving of much blame, during the ſtruggles between monarchy and ariſtocracy, but which afterwards became an oppreſſive engine of ſtate. Two other acts particularly regard the conſtitution; by the one it is wiſely ordained that no leagues or bonds of aſſociation be entered into, nor any commotions raiſed, under the pain of confiſcation, and even the life of the guilty to be in the king's mercy; and that, under the ſame penalty, no inhabitants of boroughs ſhall engage in bonds of attendance; or ride in armour, ſave with the king, his officers, or the lord of the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0141700201:256"/>borough. The other act declares that no freeholder, that holds of the king a property of leſs value than twenty pounds a year, be conſtrained to come to the parliament or general council, as a member, except he be a baron, or be commanded by the king's officer or writ <note n="4" place="bottom">Acts, f. v. 43, c. 88, and f. 43, c. 85.</note>. This ordinance, really intended as a relief of the ſubjects at a period when attendance on parliament was regarded as a burdenſome expence, and loſs of time, has been conſtrued into an intention of undue influence.</p>
               <p>The patriotic exertions of this laſt parliament of James II are terminated with a decree, that the proper officers order its ſtatutes to be copied and proclaimed through the kingdom, in order that none may pretend ignorance. The members con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with an affecting peroration, to the effect that, ſince God has ſent their ſovereign ſuch proſperity, that all rebels and infringers of juſtice are baniſhed, and no party able to excite commotion remains in the realm, if the king and his miniſters be inclined to the quiet and utility of the ſtate, and to diſpenſe juſtice and equity among the people, the parliament therefore exhorts, and requires, the monarch diligently to enforce theſe ſtatutes, that he may meet with the approbation of heaven, and of all his ſubjects; and expreſſes gratitude to God, who has ſent them ſuch a prince to be their governor and defender <note n="5" place="bottom">Ibid. f. 45, c. 102.</note>. Alas, two ſhort years were to cloſe their hopes, and their gratitude! A fatal chance was again to reduce Scotland to the confuſions of a minority, and to retard the civilization, and the glory, of that ill-fated kingdom. That the happineſs of millions ſhould depend upon the infancy of one, is a paradox in human affairs, which may provoke the ſmiles of thoſe who think, and the tears of thoſe who feel. But ſuch inſtances ſeldom occur, and muſt be ſuffered, to avoid greater evils. Severe however,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0141700201:257"/>as are the misfortunes of elective monarchy, when compared with the hereditary calamities of Scotland, they loſe their terrors, and aſſume the aſpect of felicity.</p>
               <p>Plenipotentiaries were named, <note place="margin">1459 July</note> to extend the truce with England, which expired this year; and it was prolonged for nine years <note n="6" place="bottom">To the 6th July 1468.

               <p>A commiſſion was iſſued to Sir William Monipeny of Rattray, <note place="margin">Nov.</note> and Mr. John Kennedy provoſt of St. Andrews, to proceed on an embaſſy to France, and demand the earldom of Xaintonge, which had been granted to James I.

               <p>In the deficiency of hiſtorical materials, <note place="margin">1460</note> it is not eaſy to diſcover the pretences, or cauſes, which induced James to break the truce by beſieging Roxburgh. It is certain that, in June, he ſent embaſſadors to England, to confirm the truce, and to compoſe any ſlight infringements, which might have
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0141700201:258"/>occurred ſince its commencement <note n="9" place="bottom">Rymer, XI, 453.</note>: and that, on the third of Auguſt, he was ſlain. That, in the conteſt between the families of York and Lancaſter, the Scotiſh monarch inclined to the latter is to be inferred from his perſonal relation, by the mother, with the families of Somerſet and Gaunt, and from the aſſiſtance lent by the French king, his ally, to Henry VI; and is aſcertained by the treaties when Henry maintained his authority, and the intervals of war when York was in power, and by the flight of Henry, and his queen, into Scotland. The caſtle of Roxburgh was in the cuſtody of William Nevil, lord Fauconberg, of the houſe of Warwick, the chief pillar of York's honourable cauſe <note n="1" place="bottom">Calendars of ancient charters, 38 H 6, p. 281.</note>. It appears therefore that the embaſſy of June, which conſiſted of not leſs than two biſhops, three abbots, and three peers, had far ſuperior intentions to thoſe expreſſed in the commiſſion; and was ſent to promiſe aid to Henry, upon certain previous terms, probably that Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh and Berwick, held by the enemies of Henry, ſhould be reſtored to Scotland, if taken by James. On the tenth of July the Lancaſtrians had been defeated at Northampton, and Henry reduced to captivity; an event which ſeems inſtantly to have excited the Scotiſh monarch to arms, and he proceeded to ſecure the conceſſions in the firſt place, as not only a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary object of prudence upon his part, but as affording a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction to the arms of York, or a motive to their blame, by holding them out to the Engliſh as the origin of national diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſter, and diſgrace.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, toward the end of July, James, with a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous army, well furniſhed with cannon, and warlike ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinery, proceeded to the ſiege of Roxburgh caſtle; which had ever ſince the battle of Durham remained in the hands of

While the king was obſerving the effects of his artillery, one of the rudely contrived cannons of that age, conſiſting of iron bars, girded with circles of metal, ſuddenly burſt; a fragment ſtruck his thigh, and the great effuſion of blood produced a death almoſt inſtantaneous.

It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to expreſs the grief of the camp, and of the kingdom, at the premature loſs of a beloved ſovereign, in the flower of his age, aggravated by the circumſtances, and by the ſtrange wantonneſs of the fatality. The young regretted the death of a youthful prince, of an ardent leader; the old ſighed at the proſpect of another minority. Could any conſolation have ariſen, it muſt have proceeded from the ſpirit of the queen, Mary of Gelder; who, immediately upon the tidings, arrived in the camp with the infant heir of the monarchy, and ſhewing him to the ſoldiers, while the tears guſhed from her eyes, ſhe conjured them by every domeſtic tye, by the memory of their ſovereign, by the fame of Scotiſh valour, not to depart from their deſign, but to deſtroy this calamitous fortreſs. The caſtle was taken, and levelled with the ground <note n="4" place="bottom">Ibid. but they are ſilent concerning the queen; and it is with heſitation that Hector Boyce, fabulous from firſt to laſt, is quoted with a final adieu to that impoſtor, Lib.

The ſettlement of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency is not a little obſcure; ſome authors inferring the queen, Mary of Gelder, to have been the ſole regent, and to have managed public affairs by the advice of Kennedy; while others add a council of regency, conſiſting of the chancellor lord Evandale, a natural deſcendant of Murdac duke of Albany; the earl of Orkney late chancellor, the lords Graham and Boyd, and the biſhops of Glaſgow and Dunkeld <note n="3" place="bottom">Ib. 107, 108. Leſley, 311. On the reſignation of the earl of Orkney in 1458, the biſhop of Brechin became chancellor. Andrew Stuart lord Evandale, (or Avondale, Lanarkſhire,) a natural ſon of Sir James Stuart, (that ſon of Murdac duke of Albany who fled to Ireland in the beginning of the reign of James I,) had been recalled with his two brothers by James II, and appears as chancellor on the acceſſion of James III.

<p>The fables, and prolix orations, of Buchanan concerning a conteſt between the queen and Kennedy, XI, 6—17 were compoſed by him to ſerve the faction of Murray againſt Mary, and deſerve ſevere reprobation, as they evince that he was capable of perverting the very foundation of hiſtory.</p>
                     <p>About the commencement of this reign it appears, from Scotſtarvet's Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendars, that James lord Livingſton was great chamberlain; James Lindſay provoſt of Lincluden keeper of the privy ſeal; Sir John Colquhoun comptroller; David Guthrie of Kincaldrum treaſurer; Archibald Whitlaw archdeacon of Moray ſecretary.</p>
                  </note>. But it appears moſt probable that this council, if it exiſted, was only of ſtate; and that the oſtenſible management had, by the will of the late king, or the practice of Scotland, paſſed to the queen mother, who uſed the tried wiſdom and abilities of Kennedy, in conducting the government. This prelate, by the beſt influence, that of talents, and probity, and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical ſkill, had acquired an authority before unknown to any churchman in Scotland; a country always more remarkable
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0141700201:263"/>for the moderation of its clergy, than for their ambition: and at a period while even the barren waſtes of Sweden had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the bloody ſcenes of eccleſiaſtical dominion, it is pleaſing to obſerve the Scotiſh prelates only eminent in honeſty, and patriotiſm.</p>
               <p>An important event ſoon attracted the attention of the Scotiſh government. <note place="margin">1461</note> Henry VI of England, having been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated at Touton in Yorkſhire by Edward IV, fled to Scotland, with his queen and ſon; <note place="margin">29 Mar.</note> the dukes of Somerſet and Exeter, lord Roſs, Forteſcue the chief juſtice, and other perſons of rank <note n="4" place="bottom">Hall, 187.

To gain the aſſiſtance of this powerful houſe, Henry VI now entered into an engagement to give George, earl of Angus, lands between the rivers Trent and Humber, amounting to the yearly value of two thouſand marks ſterling; and to erect theſe lands into a dukedom. It was however ſtipulated that the earl might war on England, at the command of the Scotiſh king; and that he ſhould not be amenable to the Engliſh parliament, or courts of juſtice <note n="8" place="bottom">Hume Douglas, II, 21, 22, from the original.</note>.</p>

Duclos, ib. Carte, forgetting that Wyrceſtre's work is poſthumous, and not finally corrected, ſo that ſometimes events are twice mentioned, ſtrangely ſuppoſes Margaret and Brezé to have twice arrived from France and taken Alnwick, 1462, 1463.

Forteſcue the chief juſtice ſeems to have attended her to Flanders, whence he was invited to England. He was ſoon after queſtioned concerning ſome writings againſt Edward's right, which had been circulated from Scotland into England. His declaration in anſwer appears, MS. Harl. 1757, f. 188. It is long and curious, but foreign to this work.</note>. The battle of Hexham fought by her adherents in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing year was fatal to her cauſe: while Henry, ſuſpicious of the Scots, ventured into England in diſguiſe; and, after lurking a year in Lancaſhire, was diſcovered and ſent to the tower of London.</p>
               <p>Warwick had artfully ſhaken the attachment of Mary of Gelder to the cauſe of Henry, by propoſing her marriage with the new Engliſh monarch: and the queen dowager ſeems even to have proceeded to Carliſle, to advance the negotiations <note n="5" place="bottom">In April 1462, according to Wyrceſtre, 493, Warwick met Mary at Dumfries, on the buſineſs of the marriage. In the Paſton letters, I, 270, there are ſome ſingular notices concerning the negotiations in Scotland. "Theſe lords in your other letter, with lord Haſtyngs, and others, ben to Karlyle, to reſſave in the queen of Scots." The ſame letter aſſerts that it was agreed that Henry and his adherents ſhould be delivered up to Edward; theſe terms having been granted by the young lords of Scotland in oppoſition to the old. The ſame diſtinction of party occurs in the minority of James V, which ſee. The earl of Douglas was, by the treaty, to be regarded as an Engliſhman; and retired in conſternation to the abbey of St. Alban's. It appears that the queen and Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedy were in concord, in ſpite of Buchanan's fables; and that their party was that of the young or new lords, created by the houſe of Stuart; while perhaps Angus, attached by intereſt to Henry and to war with England, led the ancient ariſtocracy: but he died this year, leaving a ſon Archibald only nine years of age. Douglas Peer. Hume, II, 27.</note>. But her doubtful reputation, and the ruin of Henry's affairs, fruſtrated the deſign; and ſhe may appear to have fallen a victim to her mortification on the occaſion.

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0141700201:267"/>Her prudence, her ſpirit, her various virtues and abilities, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended her to public veneration, and eſteem. A widow in the bloom of beauty, and vigour of youth, it would not be a matter of ſurpriſe that her chaſtity was dubious; and even this ſtain would diſappear in the ſplendor of her merits, for nothing can be more unjuſt than to infer that the loſs of female modeſty is the loſs of every virtue. But there may perhaps be reaſon to believe that this charge belongs to calumny, and originated among ſome of the ambitious and inimical nobles, who vainly aſpired to her hand or her power; or, while awed by her authority, deſpiſed her ſway as that of a woman and a foreigner <note n="7" place="bottom">The Hepburns of Hales, afterwards of Bothwell, were fatal to the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our queens. Adam Hepburn of Hales is charged by Mair, 327, with committing adultery with Mary of Gelder, he being a married man. The charge is repeated, almoſt verbatim, by Ferrerius, 386, who adds her praiſe, "alias mirum in modum laudatiſſimae:" by Lindſay, 109, and alluded to by Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanan, XII, 18. Sir D. Dalrymple deſends her, Remarks, ch. VII, by ſaying that Mair brought the charge fifty years after her death; but he was advanced in years, when he wrote, and it is to be wiſhed that we had equal evidence for all the events in our hiſtory. Sir David omits another evidence, that of Wyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtre, a contemporary, cited by Carte, II, 766, charging her with an amour with Somerſet, whoſe vanity related it to Louis XI; and Mary in revenge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigated Hales to murder him. Nor could Alexander duke of Albany have branded his brother James III as a baſtard, if their mother's reputation had been holy. Her devotion is more apparent, than her chaſtity, by her foundation of Trinity church and hoſpital, Edinburgh, 1461, confirmed by the biſhop of St. Andrews on the 1st of April 1462. See Arnot's Edinburgh.

               <p>A parliament being ſummoned to Edinburgh, <note place="margin">9 Oct.</note> lord Boyd was ſolemnly pardoned by the king; and appointed governor of his perſon, and of the princes, and royal caſtles, and afterwards one of the council choſen to conduct the marriages of James, his brothers, and ſiſters <note n="8" place="bottom">A ſolemn pardon was granted to Boyd, Adam Hepburn <hi>apparent</hi> (heir) of Hales, John lord Somerville, and Ker <hi>maſter</hi> of Ceſsfurd, 5 Oct.

The privileges of the church were, as uſual, ratified: it was ordered that the dowery of the future queen ſhould amount to one third of the royal revenue, in lands and cuſtoms: ſeveral regulations to reſtrain the avarice of the clergy concerning penſions, and commendams, were iſſued: and a ſtatute of Robert I, denying to any Engliſhmen benefices
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0141700201:272"/>ſecular or religious in Scotland, was confirmed. For the further ſecurity of the public peace, high fines were impoſed upon the <hi>burrows,</hi> or pledges, of thoſe who had been obliged to give ſecurity for their behaviour, and afterwards violated the paction. This parliament further ordained that no perſon ſhould ſend money out of the kingdom, nor take more with him than was neceſſary for his expences, under pain of forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſum, and ten pounds more: an ineffectual proviſion for the want of induſtry, and calculated to fetter commerce, and increaſe that poverty which it was intended to prevent. The increaſing wealth of England rendered the poverty of Scotland more conſpicuous: but we in vain peruſe the Scotiſh acts of parliament, to find encouragement given to the woollen trade, or to manufactures, or any invitation to foreign manufacturers, to ſettle in the kingdom. On the contrary the regulations ſeem only adapted to baniſh commerce; and in conſequence depreſs induſtry; and as it can hardly be conceived that the commiſſioners of the burghs were blind to their own intereſt, there is room to believe that the overbearing nobles, and prelates, intended to cruſh the wealth of the citizens, a ſubject of their envy and ſcorn. The Scotiſh money was now to the Engliſh as one to three; and the Scotiſh ſilver penny became a moſt diminutive coin, ſo that it could not be cut into quarters, or farthings, as formerly: for the benefit of the poor, this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament decreed that billon farthings, of copper mixt with a ſmall portion of ſilver, ſhould be iſſued, being the firſt example of that coinage in Scotland <note n="9" place="bottom">Acts, f. 46—f. v. 47.</note>.</p>
               <p>The national council, having again aſſembled, <note place="margin">1467 31 Jan.</note> publiſhed ſeveral decrees wholly regarding commerce. It was inſtituted that none but freemen of burghs, and their domeſtic factors,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0141700201:273"/>and ſervants, ſhould pretend to foreign trade, except the biſhops, lords, barons, and higher clergy, who might ſend their ſervants: that no craftſmen ſhould engage in foreign mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize: that none ſhould aſpire to trade, who had not a certain property: that no ſhip ſhould ſail, without a formal agreement between the merchants and the maſter of the veſſel; nor enter upon a voyage in winter: that no merchant ſhould freight any veſſel to certain towns in Flanders, among which Bruges, the grand ſtaple of commerce, is mentioned, but that Middleburg ſhould be the only allowed port in the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, while Rochelle, Bourdeaux, and the other havens of France, are left free as before; an ordinance apparently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from ſome freſh diſſention with the Flemings <note n="1" place="bottom">Acts, f. v. 47—f. v. 48.</note>.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile the Boyds proceeded in their ambitious deſigns, and collected a power too heavy for them long to ſupport. Strangers to the prudence of moderation, their career was rapid in the extreme; and the nation beheld with diſguſt, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, their influence ſo far abuſe the weak youth of the king, as to procure his eldeſt ſiſter, who had been affianced to the ſon of Henry VI, in marriage to Sir Thomas, the ſon of lord Boyd. The iſland of Arran, and other lands, were given as the dower of the princely bride, and erected into an earldom in order to elevate the ſtation of her huſband, who was at the ſame time created conſtable of Scotland <note n="2" place="bottom">In Scotſtarvet's Calendars appear grants of the lands of Arran, Stuartoun, &amp;c. to Mary counteſs of Arran, and Thomas <hi>lord Boyd</hi> earl of Arran her huſband, dated 26 April 1467. He is conſtable in October. Carm. Tracts, p. 48.</note>. This connection was the more invidious, as lord Boyd was one of thoſe who had been appointed to manage the nuptials of the royal family; and as it was aſſerted that the princeſs had been promiſed to
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0141700201:274"/>Hamilton's ſon, as a recompence for his critical ſervices to her father, <note place="margin">12 Oct.</note> in withdrawing his forces from Douglas <note n="3" place="bottom">See Abercr. II, 397, but the aſſertion is more than doubtful.</note>.</p>
               <p>The ſtatutes of the two next ſeſſions of parliament chiefly concern the ſtate of money in the kingdom <note n="4" place="bottom">Acts, f. 49, 50.</note>; <note place="margin">1468 12 Jan</note> and muſt have excited diſcontent by the repeated alterations of the value, a ſymptom indicative of a weak or a pernicious government. Scotiſh money now became to the Engliſh as one to four; a circumſtance rather imputable perhaps to the increaſing wealth of England, than to the penury of Scotland; though in the latter country a great ſource of abundance had been ſtopped, by the long diſcontinuance of inroads into England, whence a degree of opulence had ariſen, from the ſpoil and the ranſom of captives. However this be, the unpopular example of James III long ſerved as a beacon to warn the ſucceeding monarchs, and there is no further alteration in the value of money till the reign of Mary.</p>
               <p>Among the ſingular incongruities of human affairs, may be claſſed the fortune of the third James. His feeble and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannic reign was, in its commencement, graced with the capture of Roxburgh, the reddition of Berwick, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant annexation of the Orkneys to the Scotiſh monarchy; any one of which events would have reflected honour on the able reigns of his father, or grandfather. Let us then abandon the maxim, that political prudence, and ſucceſs, are the ſame. The acquiſition of the Orkneys forms an incident, ſo remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in itſelf, and attended with ſuch laſting conſequences, that no apology need be offered for entering into ſome detail upon this intereſting ſubject.</p>
               <p>That the Orkneys were conſidered as a part of Pikland, till the Norwegians ſeized them, with the Hebudes, in the ninth
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0141700201:275"/>century, <note place="margin">1468</note> has been before explained. When the latter iſlands were, in 1266, ſo far recovered by Alexander III, that the Norwegian kings reſigned the title of their ſovereignty to the Scotiſh, though the Lords of the Iſles never paid homage, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept by a conſtraint which ſeldom occurred, the Orkneys ſtill remained an earldom, acknowledging no ſuperior but the king of Norway. The Norwegian line of earls failed about the year 1330, in the perſon of Magnus V: and the earldom paſſed, by female ſucceſſion, to Malis earl of Strathern <note n="5" place="bottom">His right is rather obſcure, but it appears to have been by marriage. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploma of 1443 in Wall. Ork. and Orkn.

William was ſucceeded by Henry Sinclair, the firſt of that name, 1369—1392? He was followed by the ſecond Henry, who died in 1420. The next was William, the celebrated chancellor, who in 1470 ſurrendered the Orkneys to the crown. Crawf. Off. 35.</note>; and in this family they long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained. The undoubted ſuperiority however reſted with the kings of Denmark, to which Norway had been annexed ſince the year 1387; they continued to give the inveſtiture; and, on the failure of heirs, or any pretext of rebellion, or neglect of allegiance, might have reſumed the property. The Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wegian and Daniſh monarchs even conſidered the houſe of Sinclair as rather inveſted with the titular, than with the real, ſucceſſion; and ſometimes appointed other governors <note n="7" place="bottom">Torf. Hiſt. Orc. 178.</note>.</p>
               <p>When Hakon VI, in 1379, admitted the claim of Henry Sinclair to this earldom, his inveſtiture was burthened with ſevere conditions: 1, Sinclair was conſidered as being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed governor, and earl, of the Orkneys, by an abſolute grace of the king: 2, beſides preciſe fidelity upon all occaſions, he is bound to ſerve his ſovereign with one hundred men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely armed, when required, upon a notice of three months:
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0141700201:276"/>3, to defend the Orkneys, and Shetland, againſt any invaſion, not only with the native force, but with the whole power of his houſe: 4, to exert both the ſaid powers in aſſiſtance of his Norwegian ſovereign, when he attacked any foreign ſtate: 5, not to build any caſtles, or forts, in the iſlands without the royal conſent: 6, to maintain all the inhabitants in their own laws: 7, not to ſell, or impledge, the earldom, or the right to it: 8, to be bound to anſwer for maladminiſtration accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the laws of Norway: 9, to attend the king upon any juſt cauſe, or at national council: 10, to aſſiſt Hakon againſt the biſhop of Orkney: 11, the earldom is to return to the king, in caſe there are no male heirs: 12, Sinclair is to pay to the king one thouſand gold nobles. The deed contains other ſtrict clauſes, unneceſſary here to commemorate: nor need it be added that Sinclair, in caſe of a war, muſt have choſen between his Scotiſh and Norwegian fidelity, in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty that the poſſeſſions under both could not be retained <note n="8" place="bottom">Deed of Inveſtiture in Torf.

               <p>The direct ſovereighty of the kings of Denmark and Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, over the Orkneys, appears moſt evidently in the years between 1422 and 1434, when different governors were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, as would ſeem during a minority in the houſe of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clair; for in the latter year the inveſtiture of this earldom was, by Eric the Daniſh monarch, conferred upon the celebrated Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Sinclair, afterwards chancellor of Scotaland. To this great man, who held the earldom, when the ceſſion was made, it may appear that Scotland was not a litte indebted for this advantage <note n="9" place="bottom">In 1418 John Sinclair paid homage to Eric king of Denmark for Hialtland or Shetland.

                  <pb n="262" facs="tcp:0141700201:277"/>Another object to be conſidered upon the preſent occaſion, as leading to the final treaty between Denmark and Scotland, is the <hi>annual of Norway,</hi> as it is termed in a Scotiſh act of parliament <note n="1" place="bottom">Acts, 1466, f. 46.</note>. When after the unſucceſsful expedition, and death, of Hakon IV, Magnus V king of Norway, had, in 1266, ceded the Hebudes to Scotland, it was ſtipulated, in the treaty, that the Scotiſh kings ſhould pay the annual ſum of one hundred marks, as an acknowledgment for the renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This ſmall ſum, as might be expected, was rather allowed to accumulate, than regularly paid, eſpecially when any commotions intervened in the Scotiſh government. The treaty had been confirmed by Robert I in 1312; and by James I in 1426 <note n="2" place="bottom">Torf. 198.</note>. But, in 1457, the payment had been neglected for a long period; and Chriſtiern I, in whom the houſe of Oldenburg had nine years before aſcended the Daniſh throne, having at length attained poſſeſſion of the ſceptres of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, and having in the preceding year concluded an alliance with France, remonſtrated, even with menaces, upon this account to the ſecond James <note n="3" place="bottom">Ibid. 183. The name is ſpelled Chriſtiern (Miles Chriſti,) by the kings themſelves, till about 1550, when <hi>Chriſtian</hi> appears. Many papers, Veſp. F. III.</note>. The object had been conſidered as of ſuch importance by the Daniſh monarch that, in the treaty with France, a ſpecial article bore that, in caſe of any diſpute with the Scotiſh king, upon this occaſion, Denmark ſhould be ſecure of the friendſhip of France <note n="4" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. It appears indeed that the ſum demanded by Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0141700201:278"/>was large; for the penalty of ten thouſand marks, for each failure, was charged: and the aggregate in forty years of omiſſion aroſe to four hundred and four thouſands of marks ſterling, or nearly ten millions preſent currency <note n="5" place="bottom">Torf. 184, ſpeaks of forty years: in p. 185, of twenty-six. The laſt ſeems an error, ariſing from a date 1426, p. 185. Yet from 1426 to 1460 are but thirty-four years. See here May 1426.</note>. After ſome negotiation, the commiſſioners of Denmark and Scotland at length appeared at Paris, in the year 1460, in the preſence of the French king Charles VII. The Danes only producing a copy of the agreement between Eric and James I; and the duplicate original of the Scotiſh archives being in the poſſeſſion of the biſhop of St. Andrews, the chief of the embaſſy, who had been arreſted by ſickneſs at Bruges; the Scotiſh envoys ſeized the occaſion to ſtart objections. The penalty, they affirmed, could not be incurred as the treaty had not been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed, but only neglected; and they even hinted that the long forbearance, on the part of Denmark, implied a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription. Charles, wiſhing to conciliate his allies, alledged the abſence of the orginal treaty as a ground of indeciſion: but prudently recommended a marriage between the heir of Scotland, and the daughter of the Daniſh ſovereign, as the beſt mean of terminating the difference. After ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of this propoſal, the Scotiſh envoys, who appear to have had previous powers, aſſented, upon condition, that the arrears of the annual ſum payable for the Hebudes ſhould be diſcharged, and the payment for ever remitted: that the king of Denmark ſhould abandon his right to the Orkneys and Shetland; and pay one hundred thouſand crowns for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coration of the royal bride. The Danes required time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult their court, but in the meanwhile James II was ſlain:
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0141700201:279"/>upon which event, the king and council of France recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended delay and deliberation <note n="6" place="bottom">Torf. 184—186.</note>.</p>
               <p>It was not to be ſuppoſed that the Scotiſh government would neglect an object of ſuch moment; and the king's approach to maturity recommended it to increaſing attention. The parliament of 1466 had conſidered the marriage of James as connected with the <hi>annual of Norway:</hi> but nothing further ariſes till the preſent year, when Chriſtiern ſent to demand the payment, expreſſing at the ſame time his wiſhes of amity with the Scotiſh monarch. In his anſwer James proteſted an equal deſire of friendſhip with Denmark, a country of ſuch proximity to Scotland, and ſo much connected by mutual commerce; and promiſed to ſend embaſſadors in order to conciliate this, and other affairs <note n="7" place="bottom">Torf. 187.</note>. <note place="margin">28 July</note> Accordingly full powers were granted to lord Evandale chancellor of Scotland, Boyd earl of Arran, the biſhops of Glaſgow, and the Orkneys, and other perſons of inferior note, to viſit the courts of France, England, Spain, Denmark, Burgundy, Bretagne, Savoy, and other regions, that they might ſelect a wife for James, and contract the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; a general commiſſion either intended to provide for a failure in Denmark, or to flatter the Daniſh court by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of choice, and preference <note n="8" place="bottom">Commiſſion in Torf. 192.</note>. This honourable em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſy proceeded to Copenhagen; and awaited Chriſtiern's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from Sweden <note n="9" place="bottom">Torf. 187.</note>.</p>
               <p>Chriſtiern I was one of the moſt powerful monarchs who had ever held the Daniſh ſceptre. Poſſeſſed of the three northern kingdoms, and of the duchies of Sleſwick and Holſtein, pious, prudent, liberal, and a lover of peace, he was regarded with veneration by the neighbouring princes, who conſtantly choſe him as the arbiter of their differences. But the frequent tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0141700201:280"/>of Sweden, and the repeated aſcents of Charles Canutſon upon the throne of that kingdom, one of which happened this year, joined with the ſums paid for the acquiſition of Sleſwick and Holſtein, had exhauſted the penury of the Daniſh trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. No king of Denmark had ever rendered his influence ſo much known in Europe, by foreign alliances; among which that formed with France againſt England was the chief: and a connection with Scotland, important in itſelf, was further recommended by mutual friendſhip and enmity. Theſe circumſtances conſidered will abate any ſurprize at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Chriſtiern, in abandoning to Scotland the iſlands of Orkney and Shetland, remote and little profitable to Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark; and commanded by a Scotiſh family, of divided, and uncertain fidelity.</p>
               <p>But to Scotland the proximity of theſe iſlands, and the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal belief that they had anciently belonged to the monarchy, rendered their acquiſition a matter of glory, and importance; not to mention their intrinſic value, which was far from being inconſiderable. The Scotiſh embaſſadors, aware of the weight of their negotiation, conducted it with zeal and prudence; but could not prevaiol upon Chriſtiern to grant an immediate dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liction of the Orkneys and Shetland; while his deſire of the alliance, and his poverty, conſented to impledge them for the greater part of his daughter's portion. The chief articles of this memorable treaty were; <note place="margin">8 Sept.</note> 1, that the arrears of the annual ſum ariſing from the Hebudes, ſhould be remitted, with all the penalties; and no future payment ſhould be demanded from the king and queen of Scotland, their heirs and child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren <note n="1" place="bottom">"Eorumque heredibus ac liberis duntaxat." Torf. 195.</note>: 2, that the bride's portion ſhould amount to ſixty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand florins, of which ten thouſand are to be diſburſed before
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0141700201:281"/>ſhe leaves Denmark with the embaſſadors; and for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining fifty thouſand Chriſtiern, with the advice and conſent of the prelates, peers, and chiefs of Norway, aſſigns the iſlands of Orkney, as a pledge to be retained, till redeemed by him, or any future Norwegian king: 3, that James ſhould, in caſe of death, confirm Margaret of Denmark in the poſſeſſion of the palace of Linlithgow, and caſtle of Down in Menteith, with their territories; and in a revenue of one third part of the royal income: 4, that if the queen ſhould in widowhood chuſe to leave Scotland, ſhe ſhould, inſtead of this proviſion, accept one hundred and twenty thouſand florins, of which fifty thouſand ſhould be eſteemed paid upon the redeliverance of the Orkneys; provided that the queen did not marry any Engliſhman of whatever rank <note n="2" place="bottom">Ibid. 95—197.</note>.</p>
               <p>The Swediſh commotions continuing to conſume the Daniſh revenues, the delay of the payment agreed on protracted the reſidence of the Scotiſh embaſſy at Copenhagen; and Arran returned to Scotland, to lay the terms before James; and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain inſtructions concerning the conveyance of the bride <note n="3" place="bottom">Torf. 188.</note>. Winter now approached, and the ice and ſtorms of a Scandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>navian ſea being dreadful to the embaſſadors, and their fair charge, it was reſolved that the voyage ſhould be delayed till ſpring; <note place="margin">1469</note> when Arran, with a noble train, again proceeded to Denmark <note n="4" place="bottom">Ferrer, f. v. 388. Buch. XII, 27.</note>. The Scotiſh peers envied not his commiſſion; but reſolved to avail themſelves of his abſence, by completing, what on his former departure they had commenced, his ruin and that of his family. Chriſtiern had not repleniſhed his treaſury; <note place="margin">20 May</note> and his deſpair of ſupply prompted him, while he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the Swediſh war as an apology, to offer the iſlands of Shetland, on the ſame terms with thoſe of Orkney, but a
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0141700201:282"/>pledge only for eight thouſand florins; while he paid the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining two thouſand, a ſum now equal to about twenty thouſand pounds <note n="5" place="bottom">Torf. 188.</note>. The offer was inſtantly accepted: and ſince that period the Orkneys, and Shetland, have been gems of the Scotiſh crown <note n="6" place="bottom">In 1470 William Sinclair earl of Orkney reſigned his claims to the king.

The ſudden elevation of the Boyds had excited uncommon envy; and their pride had created numerous and powerful enemies. During the laſt abſence of Arran, ſuch influence had been exerted, that James had paſſed from extreme favour into a total alienation from that family; and it was natural that, as he advanced in years and intelligence, he ſhould become inimical to a houſe, which had ſo groſsly abuſed his power and his youth. As ſoon as the ſhips which conveyed the Daniſh princeſs, and her attendants, had arrived in the Forth, the ſiſter of James with a laudable zeal for her huſband, haſtened on board to inform Arran that Scotland was now to him a hoſtile, and dangerous, ſoil. They fled together into Denmark, Arran hoping that his wife would prove a pledge for his ſafety <note n="8" place="bottom">Ferrerius, 387, by anticipation: Leſley, 315. Buch. XII, 30.</note>. But the Scotiſh monarch yet further irritated by this inſult, proceeded to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme meaſures againſt the Boyds.

Lord Boyd eſcaped his brother's fate, by retiring into England, where he died in a few years at Alnwick, under the united preſſure of age, and

Of Robert the ſecond ſon nothing is ſaid; and it is ſuſpected that the varying relations of Ferrerius and Buchanan originate from confounding him with Thomas earl of Arran. Though he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear not to be mentioned in the trial, yet his voluntary exile may have followed the ruin of the family. Arran, according to Ferrerius, wandered from Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark to Germany, Venice, Naples, Tuſcany, where he was ſlain by the huſband of a woman, whom he attempted to debauch: according to Buchanan he went from Germany to France and Burgundy, and died at Antwerp, where a mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent tomb was erected to his memory by Charles the Bold, who himſelf died in 1477. However this be, in 1470 or 1472, Arran was in England. John Paſton eſq in a letter to Sir John Paſton his brother, written, as Mr. Fenne the editor obſerves, in one of theſe years, ſays "Alſo I pray you to recommend me, in my moſt humble wiſe, unto the good lordſhip of the moſt courteous, gentleſt, wiſeſt, kindeſt, moſt companionable, freeſt, largeſt, and moſt bounteous knight, my lord the Earl of Arran, which hath married the king's ſiſter of Scotland." Paſton proceeds to ſtyle him "a light, clever, well-ſpoken, fair archer; devouteſt, moſt perfect, and trueſt to his lady, of knights;" and adds that he lodged at the George, Lombard-ſtreet, and had borrowed the ſiege of Thebes (printed by Caxton?) from Miſtreſs Paſton their ſiſter. Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanan's account ſeems to claim the preference. In 1468 Charles of Burgundy married Margaret of York; and, in the amity of the countries, Arran perhaps viſited England as a traveller.</note>. Either after his death, or upon a divorce, the Scotiſh princeſs was at length, in 1474, wedded to lord Hamilton, a connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which was to open to that noble family a near proſpect of the crown. Her children by the firſt marriage, James Boyd, created lord Kilmarnoc in 1482, and ſlain in a feud with the Montgomeries in 1487; and Grecina, wedded to lord Forbes, and after to the earl of Caſſils, died without iſſue. Her ſecond

Stuarts, 40. Buchanan ſays the children by Arran were born during his reſidence in the Burgundian dominions; and Paſton's praiſe above recited indicates his attachment to his wife. It ſeems probable that his death, and not a divorce, ſeparated them. Abercromby, II, 409—414, diſcuſſes this obſcure ſubject. That the princeſs wedded Hamilton in 1474 is evinced by the contract of marriage, among the charters of the duke of Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Abercr.

               <p>The king, who had now nearly attained his eighteenth year, was, upon his marriage, regarded as arrived at the age of majority; and the reins of ſtate were left entirely in his hands. His perſon was elegant, his mind weak. In attachment to favorites, in ſuperſtition, in love of retirement, and literature, he not a little reſembled James VI. The other chief features of his character were avarice, caprice; and a delight in archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture, muſic, and aſtrology, too violent to leave room for the duties of a monarch. His averſion to the ſeverity of public buſineſs rendered the relaxation of his government obnoxious to the united evils of anarchy and tyranny: for, beſides a fixed inclination to deſpotiſm, his impatience of ſlow and moderate meaſures prompted him to ſudden acts of outrage; and his favorites oppreſſed the people, while the indolence of the king abandoned the reins of juſtice; and his lenity to the bad was cruelty to the good. His ſceptre was ſo little ſtained with blood, that the future fate of his brother may excite doubt, or aſtoniſhment: yet oppreſſion may proceed by rapid, though ſilent, ſteps, while the fears and weakneſs of the ſovereign conſtrain him to ſhrink from ſanguinary violence <note n="3" place="bottom">Compare Ferrerius, f. v. 390, Lindſay, 115; Leſley's account of this reign, for, contrary to his uſual practice, he gives no general character. Buchanan, XII, 62, ſhews candour; and a lover of the arts would wiſh to apologize for the third James, their patron; and who fell, becauſe he loved and rewarded them to exceſs, while the proud ariſtocracy murmured to ſee artiſts for the firſt time ſhare their wealth and honours.
<p>Drummond, 116, deſcribes James III as tall, his hair black, countenance oval and aduſt. The picture at Kenſington confirms theſe features, unlike thoſe of the family of Stuart; and which might weigh with the vulgar as an argument that he was ſpurious, as the malice of Albany pretended.</p>

                  <pb n="271" facs="tcp:0141700201:286"/>After the condemnation of the Boyds, the parliament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to ſit, and iſſued ſeveral ſtatutes <note n="4" place="bottom">Acts, f. v. 51—55.</note>. The privileges of the church were confirmed, as not unuſual at the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a reign. Among many acts of leſs importance, ſome deſerve particular notice. In order to prevent the frequency of murder and homicide, which, as the ſtatute declares, had of late become very common, it is decreed that every man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlayer, who flees to the ſanctuary, ſhall be brought out, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to a trial by jury; that if the caſe be not accidental he may be put to death, no murderer having any legal claim to ſanctuary. By the writ, called a brief of diſtreſs, the property of the poor tenants was liable to ſeizure, for the debts of the landlord; an injuſtice which this parliament condemns, and declares that the tenants ſhall only be anſwerable to the amount of the rent due. Theſe acts, and others more minute, as that for the preſervation of ſalmon and trout, and that ordering regiſters to preſerve important writs, deſerve praiſe: but ſome there are of a different complexion, and which ſeem to contain the firſt germ of deſpotiſm ill underſtood. The election of aldermen, (afterwards called provoſts,) and baillies, is formally wreſted from the people of the burghs, upon pretence of avoiding annual clamours; and, by a ridiculous ariſtocracy, the old council of each burgh is to chuſe the new; and both united are to appoint the alderman, the baillies, and other officers. The inſtitution of the lords of the articles is loſt in
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0141700201:287"/>the darkneſs of the fourteenth century, and that innovation ſeems rather an ignorant, than a deſigned, attempt upon the liberties of the parliament, and of the nation. But the preſent was a flagrant infringement of the freedom of the people; and though the commiſſioners of the burghs were generally ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, who gained by the court, or by private intereſt, ſanctioned this meaſure, yet the nation ſaw it in a proper light, and the monarch ſoon became an object of public deteſtation. Another ſtatute of this parliament ſpeaks a new, and ſtrange, language; "it is thought proper that the court of parliament, juſtice's court, chamberlain's court, and <hi>ſuch like</hi> courts, which continue their ſeſſions, need not be continued from day to day; but that they be of the ſame force, until the time that they be diſſolved, the parliament by the king, the juſtice's court by the juſtice, the chamberlain's by the chamberlain, and ſo in other <hi>ſuch like</hi> courts." It is unneceſſary to add that the legiſlative aſſembly of the nation is here, for the firſt time, put upon the mean and dependent footing of a mere court of juſtice, exiſting by the royal pleaſure; and aſſimilated, in terms of contempt, with the inferior courts <note n="5" place="bottom">Acts, f. v. 54, c. 46: <hi>continued</hi> is <hi>prorogued, adjourned.</hi> It is riſible to obſerve Guthrie, amid much wiſe diſcuſſion, paſs theſe acts in ſilence, IV, 107; while, at a loſs to find inſtances of the deſpotiſm aſcribed to this king, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets as ſuch, IV, 105, the fate of the Boyds, and the marriage of the king's ſiſter to Hamilton!</note>. This novelty calls for a pauſe, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, if poſſible, the motives, and adviſers, of ſuch meaſures.</p>
               <p>The youth of James, at this period, and the weakneſs he afterwards diſcovered, lead to a ſtrong ſuſpicion that ſome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite miniſter, or miniſters, were the real authors of the deſpotic procedure, which, during this reign, diſguſted all orders of men. But ſo barren are ſtill our materials, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the internal government of the kingdom, that conjecture,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0141700201:288"/>and probability muſt ſupply the defect of clear information. The power of the chancellor became, in this reign, yet more remarkable than at any prior period; and he now obtained the high diſtinction of a precedence next to that of the princes of royal blood <note n="6" place="bottom">Dr. Gilbert Stuart on the Public Law and Conſtitution of Scotland, chap. iv, p. 32, edit. 1784.</note>. In parliament he preſided, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected the lords of the articles; and in fact the whole legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive body. This office during the far greater part of this reign, from 1460 to 1482, was filled by Andrew Stuart, lord Evandale, the natural ſon of Sir James Stuart, ſon of Murdac duke of Albany. It appears to be a novelty in our hiſtory that one ſo nearly connected with the royal family, eſpecially when Evandale and his brothers were legitimated by the king's mandate in 1472, ſhould hold this important office: and there is room to ſuſpect that Evandale ſacrificed his duty to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the aggrandizement of the royal family, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded as his own. Beſides this motive, other circumſtances conſpired to extend the prerogative during this reign, unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily not upon the prudent plan, ſoon after to be followed by Henry VII of England, in depreſſing the nobles and raiſing the people; but upon that already eſtabliſhed by Louis XI of France, in cruſhing the ſpirit and freedom of the commons, with thoſe of the ariſtocracy. In Scotland the people never knew their own weight, and the government turned between ariſtocracy and deſpotiſm; the nobles and the king commonly forgetting the nation, which deſerved the neglect while it ſilently abandoned its awful claim. But till James VI acceded to the Engliſh throne, and left the Scotiſh nobles at a great diſtance, and in a degrading inferiority, deſpotiſm made but a ſlow progreſs in Scotland, and the chief evils aroſe from the ariſtocracy which prevented the progreſs of induſtry and civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lization.
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0141700201:289"/>Yet the conduct of James III ſeems to evince that the nation could have no reaſon to prefer the power of the king to that of the nobles; for the deſpot who preſcribed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grading laws, and expreſſed open contempt for the nation, repreſented in its legiſlative aſſembly, was yet more inimical than the ariſtocracy; which, even by its diſſenſions, maintained, in ſome degree, the freedom, the vital current of the nation. A chief motive of the arbitrary procedure of James III appears to have ariſen from the temporary humiliation of the nobility; who, though ſtill poſſeſſed of equal power, as they were after to ſhew in the impriſonment and ſlaughter of their ſovereign, yet were awed for a time by the ruinous examples of the houſes of Douglas and Boyd. The contemporary reign of Louis XI <note n="7" place="bottom">1460—1482. Buchanan, XII, 62, adds the cruel example of Edward IV of England 1460—1483, and the ſucceeding one of Richard III. In fact James appears to have been more attached to England than to France: nor is there a renewal of the French league from 1448 till 1492 recorded in Du Tillet, or the MS. Leagues. But the politics of James were in conſtant fluctuation. See 1484.</note> ſeems alſo to have corrupted the counſels of James; for not only did the alliance with France introduce, at different times, many imitations of the French government and inſtitutions into Scotland, but James ſeems to have ſelected Louis for his particular model: yet as a man of abilities never imitates, ſo happily, in the preſent inſtance, abilities cannot be imitated. Crimes and faults may: and we behold Louis reflected, ſo to ſpeak, by James, in the heavy ſuſpicion of a brother's blood, in contempt of the nobility, and in the choice of low favorites, in an appearance of devotion, in attachment to aſtrology, in avarice, in a life of retirement and jealouſy, and in the love of arbitrary power. In their attention to ſome ſciences they were alſo ſimilar; and the patronage of Louis to an ingenious foreigner, Galeotus Martius, is rivalled by that of James to
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:0141700201:290"/>another, William Roger, the Engliſh compoſer of muſic <note n="8" place="bottom">Mezeray, Abr. III, 350. Ferrerius, f. v. 390.</note>. But the ſucceſs of their political plans was very different. Louis, aſſiſted by chance and circumſtances, laid the laſting foundation of abſolute power, levelled the nobility, cruſhed the people; and by diſcontinuing the ſtates general annihilated national freedom. James wiſhed to eſtabliſh arbitrary govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the depreſſion of the nobles, and the people; and by converting the national council, which neither his abilities nor his power would permit him to diſcontinue, into a mere court: but he forgot that neither his revenue, nor his authority, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponded with his deſigns; and fell a ſacrifice to the ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy, whoſe influence reſumed its former ſway. Theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections have been excited by the importance of the ſubject; but their prolixity having already exceeded the intention, it is proper to return to the narration.</p>
               <p>After a ſilent year in the Scotiſh annals, <note place="margin">1471 6 May</note> the firſt object, which arreſts attention, is another parliament, of which ſome ordinances deſerve hiſtorical commemoration <note n="9" place="bottom">Acts, f. 55.</note>. The ſtatute of the laſt parliament againſt murder is enforced, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged; that crime being again declared to have become com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. It is decreed, "conſidering the great poverty of the realm," that none ſhall wear ſilk, the importation being ſo expenſive, except knights, minſtrels, that is performers of muſic, and heralds, and thoſe worth one hundred pounds in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual income of lands. Another ſtatute ſhews that the intereſts of the country began to be ſomewhat underſtood: it concerns the fiſheries, an object of repeated attention, and endeavours, for three centuries; and now, it is to be hoped, the ſucceſsful care of a patriotic ſociety. This remarkable act is conceived
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0141700201:291"/>in theſe terms: <note place="margin">1471</note> "the lords <note n="1" place="bottom">All members of parliament were denominated lords of parliament, as a commoner, or a private clergyman, if embaſſador, was ſtyled lord embaſſador. So Dr. Magnus in the time of James V. The cuſtom is ſtill retained in "lords of ſeſſion," "barons of the exchequer."</note> think expedient, for the common good of the realm, and the great importation of riches to be brought into the realm from other countries, that certain lords ſpiritual and temporal, and ſome burghs, cauſe equip large ſhips, buſſes, and other great pink-boats, with nets and all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries for fiſhing: the execution of this object, and the form, and number, to be conſidered at the prorogation of this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament <note n="2" place="bottom">Acts, f. v. 57, c. 60.</note>." But the ſubject was not reſumed: and the ſcheme only excites a ſigh at the conſideration how eaſily nations are excited to war, or any ruinous project, and with what extreme difficulty any plan of public benefit is carried into execution. Another prudent ſtatute provides againſt the encroachments of the Roman church, now ariſing to ſuch enormity, as, in half a century, provoked the reformation, by prohibiting the clergy, under pain of treaſon, to procure any benefices from the court of Rome, not formerly held by the pope's diſpoſal; or to collect more money for the papal treaſury, than had been regulated by the antient taxation of Bagimont <note n="3" place="bottom">Acts, f. 56. Leſley, 356, ridiculouſly dates the taxation of Bagimont in 1512, inſtead of 1275.</note>. In this act the clergy's title to free election of their dignitaries is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and confirmed: but two years after we find that James deſpoiled the pope only for his own purpoſe, and cruſhed even this mean relict of freedom. The monks of Dunfermlin having choſen an abbot, the king probably won by a ſum of money recommended another to the pope, obtained his confirmation; and this new tyranny became inviolable cuſtom <note n="4" place="bottom">Ferrerius, f. v. 392. Leſl. 317. Buch. XII, 22.</note>. Among the ſecular clergy alſo the monarch uſurped the rights of the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0141700201:292"/>biſhops; and gave, or ſold, benefices to laymen, as well as abbacies and priories, a ſource of great national diſorder and diſcontent <note n="5" place="bottom">Iidem ib. Leſley's invective againſt this odious novelty, by which the alms aſſigned to the poor were conſumed in the luxury of the rich, is emphatic. Even the proteſtant Buchanan murmurs high indignation.</note>. James was unconſcious of the weakneſs of an unſupported throne; and his wild deſpotiſm aſſailed all orders of men.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs the Scotiſh clergy now attained greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, and dignity, from the appointment of a primate. Patrick Graham, the ſucceſſor of Kennedy in the biſhopric of St. Andrews, obtained from the pontiff a bull erecting that ſee into an archbiſhopric: and to this new dignity he added the titles of papal nuntio, and legate <hi>a latere.</hi> Inſtead of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulating their order upon this acceſſion of importance, and the kingdom upon the honour and advantage of a metropolitan ſee, at this period to be found in all the other chief ſtates of chriſtendom; and the want of which, as religion then ſtood, might bear a derogatory interpretation, and had induced and might induce the uſurping claims of the primates of York; a ſpirit of envy ſeized the Scotiſh clergy. By an offer of eleven thouſand marks, the biſhops excited James to oppoſe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult, the archbiſhop: reciprocal intereſts, and abuſes, concurred to unite the king and the prelates againſt Graham, a man of worth and learning, who was impriſoned in the caſtle of Loch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leven; where he died ſeven years after, in the vain enjoyment of his titles <note n="6" place="bottom">Ferrerius, f. v. 389. Leſley, 317. Compare Keith Biſhops, 20. Graham was the uterine brother of Kennedy. Stew. Gen. 62. Drummond, 81, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes the origin of the enmity againſt him to the Boyds. Buchanan, XII, 33, 34, 35, gives a long detail of the perſecution of this venerable prelate, conducted by William Shevez, of Shevis, afterwards archbiſhop of St. Andrews, a favorite of James. The tale does honour to the hiſtorian's feelings; and brands the perſecutors with laſting infamy.</note>.</p>

<p>From Carmichael's Tracts, Edin. 1791, 4to, p. 50, it appears that, in a parliament of this year, James iſſued a ſingular order, that in future there ſhould be no double treſſure around his arms.

                  <pb n="280" facs="tcp:0141700201:295"/>The ſtatutes of the next Scotiſh parliament are too minute for the notice of hiſtory; <note place="margin">1474 9 May</note> but the three eſtates deſired the king to form an alliance with the German emperor, by the means of his father-in-law, the ſovereign of Denmark: and at the ſame time requeſted that an embaſſy might be ſent into England, in order to obtain redreſs concerning the ſeizure of a large ſhip <note n="4" place="bottom">Acts, f. 58.</note>. This veſſel was the noted St. Salvator, commonly called the Biſhop's Barge, having been conſtructed at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of biſhop Kennedy, as formerly mentioned. Remaining the property of the ſee of St. Andrews, this ſhip, freighted with valuable merchandize, on the account of the archbiſhop, (for in this, and the following century, the prelates and nobles in England and Scotland aſpired to commerce,) went aground near Bamborough. Some merchants, literary perſons, and other paſſengers, were drowned: the abbot of St. Colm, being captured by the Engliſh, was detained till a ranſom of eighty pounds was paid <note n="5" place="bottom">Ferrerius, f. v. 392. Leſl. 316. Rymer, XI, 820.</note>. In the following year Edward IV ordered a partial compenſation of five hundred marks, with permiſſion to the Scots to ſue for any further redreſs in the courts of law <note n="6" place="bottom">Rymer, XI, 850.</note>.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile a more important affair was in agitation between the courts of England and Scotland. Edward IV was aware of the arts by which Louis XI had endeavoured to fix the Scotiſh monarch in his intereſts; and reſolved to fruſtrate the deſign by the diſplay of ſuperior advantages. In 1472 the duke of Bretagne had accuſed Louis of inviting the Scots to aſſault that duchy, upon a promiſe of aſſigning it to James; a charge apparently well founded, for Louis had commiſſioned
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0141700201:296"/>his envoy Concreſſault to perſuade the Scotiſh king to equip as many veſſels as he could, <note place="margin">1474</note> and engage troops from Denmark <note n="7" place="bottom">Duclos, II, 73, 75. Lobineau hiſt. de Bretagne, I, 716. The lords of Concreſſault were of Scotiſh extract. Torf. Orc. 185, has "Johannes de <hi>Monizon,</hi> dominus de Congreſſault," A.D. 1460, Monipeny? See 1424.</note>. As the offer of Bretagne was a proof of the artifice of Louis, though too groſs to be attempted except with a young monarch, and unexperienced council; ſo the demand of a Scotiſh fleet was a mark of his ignorance, Scotland having no ſhips of war, and none to ſpare from her ſcanty commerce. On the other ſide, James appears not to have acted without duplicity; for while he conſented to the truce requeſted by England and Burgundy, he imparted their deſigns to Louis, and inſinuated that he could liſten to no propoſal inimical to the French alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. At the ſame time he deſired permiſſion to paſs through France in a pilgrimage to Rome, a deſign which may have proceeded from the known ſuperſtition of James; but which rather ſeems, from the circumſtances, to have been founded upon the ſuppoſition that his abſence might excuſe the Scots from lending any aſſiſtance to France. Louis, in return, ſent Monipeny his chamberlain, to requeſt James not to leave his kingdom in the preſent conjuncture: and the advantages offered by England inducing the Scotiſh king to a deciſion in favor of that kingdom, the advice of Louis was followed, though not the motive <note n="8" place="bottom">Duclos, II, 146: his work is compoſed from the beſt original documents.

The intention of a pilgrimage to the holy land alſo occupied the more vigorous mind of James IV. The violent deaths of prince David, of James I, and II, ſeem to have impreſſed their ſucceſſors with an idea, that the divine wrath impended over the family, and that an expiation was due.

The Scotiſh embaſſadors, who had entered England in July <note n="9" place="bottom">Rymer, XI, 814.</note>, returned to Edinburgh in October, accompanied by the biſhop of Durham, Lord Scrope, and two other Engliſh commiſſioners; who having met with the biſhops of Glaſgow and Orkney, the earls of Argyle and Crawford, and others appointed on the part of Scotland, eſtabliſhed an alliance upon the following terms. <note place="margin">26 Oct.</note> 1. That in order to promote the wealth, peace, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and intereſt, of <hi>this noble iſle callit Gret Britane,</hi> a marriage ſhall be contracted between James the prince of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and Cecilia youngeſt daughter of Edward IV, both in early infancy. 2. That the truce of fifty four years, extending till 1519, ſhall remain in full force. 3. That, during the truce, both monarchs ſhall aſſiſt each other againſt rebels, if required. 4. That the prince being only two years of age, and the bride four, the kings ſhall ſolemnly engage to accompliſh the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in due time. 5. That the prince and princeſs ſhall, during the life of James, enjoy the uſual lands of the heir of Scotland, being the dukedom of Rothſay, the earldom of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric, and the lordſhips called the Stuart-lands. 6. That Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhall give with his daughter the ſum of twenty thouſand marks ſterling, (now equivalent to about one hundred and forty thouſand pounds,) of which two thouſand ſhall be paid yearly in the pariſh church of St. Giles at Edinburgh; the firſt payment to be made on the ſecond day of February next 1475. And laſtly, it was agreed that in caſe of the death of the prince, or princeſs, the heir of Scotland ſhould marry a daughter of England, upon the ſame terms; otherwiſe all the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:0141700201:298"/>ſums advanced ſhall be repaid within four years, except the ſum of two thouſand five hundred marks, which Edward agrees to abandon in conſideration of the intended amity <note n="1" place="bottom">Rymer, XI, 824—832.</note>.</p>
               <p>Such was this memorable treaty, which, had it been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, might have proved highly advantageous to both king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; and in particular might have ſaved Scotland from the loſs of Berwick, and from the ruinous battle at Flodden. The annual payments of Cecilia's portion may be regarded as a ſubſidy of importance, amounting as may be conjectured, to an increaſe of nearly one third in the royal revenue of Scotland; and the Engliſh policy in this advanced mode of diſburſement ſeems aſſumed in order to ſecure the continuance of the Scotiſh amity.

Reſolving to rival, or exceed, France in pecuniary gratifications, England found gold more powerful than ſteel, in fixing the fidelity of her northern neighbour; while Scotland muſt find an excuſe in her penury, and in the general defects of human nature, for expoſing her fidelity to
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0141700201:299"/>the mutual temptations of French and Engliſh ſubſidies. Nor muſt it be forgotten that the moſt able politician might have been perplexed in the deciſion, whether the connection with England, or that with France, would moſt advance the honour and intereſt of Scotland; ſo that no blame of treaſon to their country can reſt with the receivers of the gold of either king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>The treaty, <note place="margin">1475</note> which Edward IV had entered into, had been negotiated at Edinburgh, a mark of friendſhip before un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known between the countries, as the Engliſh monarchs, from precedency of rank, had ever inſiſted on the negotiations being conducted in their own kingdom. To maintain the new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with Scotland, <note place="margin">April</note> Edward ſent Dr. Alexander Legh, his almoner, on an embaſſy to that country. He was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed to give complete redreſs to the Admiral of Scotland, for a ſhip fitted out by James himſelf, which, by a ſingular chance, had been captured by the May-flower, a veſſel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Richard duke of Glouceſter <note n="4" place="bottom">After a long interval, 1436—1475, it is with pleaſure that original papers are quoted.

Any reſtriction, or impoſition, is therefore withdrawn; and it is ordered that after the foreign proviſions are entered in the <hi>tolbooth,</hi> or guildhall, the king, and lords of the council, ſhall have the choice at the market price; and the remainder ſhall
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:0141700201:302"/>be open to general ſale <note n="2" place="bottom">Acts, f. v. 63, c. 91.</note>. The ſtate of the kingdom may be better diſcerned by this ſtatute, than by volumes of declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and it is almoſt unneceſſary to add that this want of common induſtry led to a gradual increaſe of impoveriſhment; for Scotland poſſeſſed not, like ancient Athens, or modern Holland, commerce, arts, and manufactures far more than ſufficient to counterbalance the great diſadvantage of acquiring ſubſiſtence by foreign purchaſe.</p>
               <p>This parliament alſo decreed that an embaſſy ſhould be ſent to the duke of Burgundy, at the expence of the burghs, to confirm and renew the alliance formerly contracted, and to obtain a ratification, and if poſſible an enlargement of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities granted to Scotiſh merchants, and a redreſs of any damages <note n="3" place="bottom">Ibid. f. 63.</note>. This potent prince had ſent conciliating letters to the Scotiſh court, as the act expreſſes: but could the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be yet ignorant that the dead body of Burgundy had been trampled into the ice and mud, before Nanci, on the fifth of January; and that Mary his only daughter was unmarried, not having united thoſe wide territories to the houſe of Auſtria, by her marriage with Maximilian, till the eighteenth of Auguſt?

               <p>The freſh diſputes between England and Scotland appear to have originated in this, or the preceding year; but their cauſe has not been accurately explained. The death of the duke of Burgundy, which changed the views of France and England, ſeems to have been the chief ſource of this altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Louis XI having been delivered from this dreadful foe, and having ſecured himſelf from the enmity of Edward IV by a truce for their lives, by the punctual remiſſion of penſions to the Engliſh king and court, and by flattering Edward with the marriage of the dauphin to Elizabeth his eldeſt daughter, there was reaſon to expect a laſting peace between their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms <note n="8" place="bottom">Duclos, II, 275, 283, 300.</note>. In conſequence, Edward, whoſe temporary fears, and intereſt, had alone formed the treaty with Scotland, and whoſe only deſires were money and luxury, began to regret the annual diſburſements, and to wiſh for another war as a pretext of raiſing money for his pleaſures and profuſion. But their ſacrifice of the French alliance, and their inteſtine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, prevented the Scots from haſtening into an open en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with England.</p>
               <p>The reign of James had hitherto been ſucceſsful; and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had ſhowered favours upon him, which to his wiſer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors had been denied. The acquiſition of Roxburgh,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0141700201:304"/>Berwick, the Orkneys, and Shetland; the honourable mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage treaty with England, the reſumption of the earldom of Roſs, were ſplendid events, which prevented the eruption of public diſcontent at many new and arbitrary meaſures. But James had provoked deep and inveterate hatred; and, having no ſtanding army, could not rule by fear alone. A great alteration is now to take place; imprudence is to incur the uſual deſtiny: and a thick cloud of crimes, and misfortunes, is to darken the ſucceeding years of this reign.</p>
               <p>The character of James was ſtrongly contraſted by thoſe of his brothers, Alexander duke of Albany, and John earl of Mar. While the king, in ſolitary retirement, indulged his favourite ſtudies of muſic, architecture, and aſtrology, he forgot the duties, amid the idle amuſements, of a monarch. The nobles, in the feudal ages, ſeldom viſiting the court, except upon occaſions of buſineſs, or high feſtivals, and being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the arts in which James delighted, he had recourſe to the converſation of thoſe who excelled in them; but forgot the majeſty of the ſovereign ſo far as to make companions and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorites of men of mean origin; imitating Louis XI who had raiſed his barber Oliver le Dain to great wealth, and high dignities; but a ſtranger to the ſtanding army, large revenue, and other reſources, which enabled that king to cruſh the lofty, and exalt the humble. Cochran a maſon or architect, and Rogers the Engliſh maſter of muſic, were reſpectable names among the favourites of the Scotiſh king, when followed by thoſe of Leonard a ſmith, Hommil a taylor, and Torphichan a fencing maſter <note n="9" place="bottom">Ferrer. f. 395.</note>. The contempt and indignation of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility were extreme, when they beheld the public favour of the ſovereign to thoſe minions, joined with a pointed neglect of their haughty order.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:0141700201:305"/>Albany was a ſenſible and ſpirited prince, fond of martial exerciſes, of fine horſes, and of attendants tall and vigorous. In perſon he was of a middle ſtature, ſtrong, and well propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned: his broad ſhoulders, and blooming yet ſtern counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, engaged the praiſe of a martial age: and his known courage, if we believe an hiſtorian, was the only cauſe why the nobles did not rebel againſt James, while he lived in amity with this brother <note n="1" place="bottom">Lindſay, 114, 115.</note>. Mar added ſuperior ſtature to youth, beauty, and elegance of perſon: his gentle manners won every heart; nor did he yield to his brother in the favourite exerciſes of the nobility, or in his attention to the breed of his war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſes: and in hunting, hawking, and every knightly paſtime, his ſkill and grace were admired <note n="2" place="bottom">Id. 115.</note>.</p>
               <p>The wardenſhip of the eaſtern marches had been aſſigned to Albany, for life, by his father James II; to which the honours of governor of Berwick, and lord lieutenant of the borders, had been added. From his father he alſo derived the earldom of March, and its ſtrong caſtle of Dunbar <note n="3" place="bottom">Ibid. The act of forfeiture, &amp;c.</note>. If we credit Lind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay, who ſomewhat depraves his information by repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Alexander lord Home as chamberlain ſince the reign of James II, while he held not that office till the commencement of that of James IV, a violent enmity had taken place between Albany, and the Homes and Hepburns, whoſe eſtates lay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous to his earldom of March. In order to ruin Albany, his enemies applied to Cochran, who reſented that prince's contempt, while he dreaded his power: this favourite knowing the weak part of his ſovereign's character, procured a witch to pronounce to James, that he ſhould be ſlain by one of his neareſt kindred; and his children being infants, the ſuſpicion fell upon his brothers, and led to their ruin. Buchanan im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0141700201:306"/>the king's enmity againſt his brothers to a propheſy of Andrew, a Flemiſh aſtrologer, and favorite of James, that in Scotland a lion ſhould be devoured by his whelps; which, if a real prediction, was ſingular in its accompliſhment: but the account of Lindſay is more probable, as the latter emblem could not point to brothers. From the account of Ferrerius, which is the moſt ancient, it appears that Mar was accuſed of uſing magical arts againſt the king's life <note n="4" place="bottom">Lindſay, 116, 117. Buch. XII, 37. Ferrer. f. v. 393, followed by Leſley 320.</note>. In our choice of weak motives, we are however left certain that the tyranny of James was ſtrong: nor is there the ſmalleſt reaſon to infer from the baſe treaty made with Edward IV by Albany in 1482, and to which he was driven by deſpair and reſentment, that he now entertained any diſloyal deſigns; far leſs any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with England <note n="5" place="bottom">Could any connections between Albany Mar and England be diſcovered, preceding 1479, they might vindicate James; for certain it is that Albany af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards branded the king as a baſtard, (ſee letters of Dacre in the reign of James V,) and openly aſſumed the royal title. It is remarkable that the peers, in 1488, never objected the death of Mar, or exile of Albany, to James.</note>, which kingdom he did not viſit till three years after his eſcape to France; and even then was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the ſpecial invitation, and intereſted views, of Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. It is however not improbable that Albany and Mar, having alſo encountered the king's indifference, ſhared the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments of the nobles, and with them conſpired againſt the royal favourites, who had ſufficient intereſt and addreſs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found their ſafety with that of the government. Amid the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which attends the commiſſion of crimes, it belongs to can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, and reaſon, to infer a motive ſtrong enough to blunt the feelings, and corrupt the heart, for human depravity cannot at once proceed to the utmoſt degree: but when we ſpeak of the
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:0141700201:307"/>"good old times," let us reflect that the three contemporary ſovereigns of France, England, and Scotland, were all ſtained with a brother's blood.</p>
               <p>However obſcure the origin of the tempeſt might be, <note place="margin">1479</note> its effects were apparent and dreadful. Mar was ſeized by the king's command, and confined a cloſe priſoner in the caſtle of Craigmillar, near Edinburgh. Albany was committed to Edinburgh caſtle; and Evandale the chancellor was ſent to beſiege his fortreſs of Dunbar, which ſoon yielded, the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon withdrawing in boats to the Engliſh coaſt <note n="6" place="bottom">The accounts of Ferrerius and Lindſay are ſingularly confuſed. The former dates the flight of Albany to France in 1471! The latter blends events, and periods, totally diſtinct. Leſley and Buchanan are more accurate.

               <p>As the deſpotic temper of the king was certain, his frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal affections dubious, Albany thought proper, after a confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome duration, to contrive means of eſcape. Either by concert, or chance, a French veſſel arrived in the Forth, and anchored near Newhaven, a ſmall and little frequented port to the weſt of Leith, and of ſhort and eaſy acceſs from Edinburgh. The captain, either in the plot before, or now gained by Albany's emiſſaries, pretended that his cargo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of excellent wines; and ſent to the caſtle to requeſt the duke to honour him by the firſt choice. Two ſmall caſks of malmſey, then a favourite wine, were ordered: and the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in one of them concealed a roll of wax, incloſing a paper of intelligence and directions; while the other conveyed a long rope, the mean of deliverance. As the duke's meſſenger was
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:0141700201:308"/>a confidential domeſtic of tried fidelity, he was intruſted with the ſecret, and ſerved his maſter's deſign with zeal. After ſupper the commander of the fortreſs went to the king's apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to receive his orders, James lodging in the caſtle at the time; and having ordered the gates to be ſhut, and ſet the watch, he returned by appointment to Albany's chamber, to enjoy a collation and wine. The duke and his ſervant were abſtemious, while they artfully engaged the commander, and three of the garriſon who guarded the priſoner, in repeated draughts of intoxication. Secure in their ſleep, or in their death, for according to ſome accounts the odious gueſts were ſlain, Albany and his domeſtic proceeded to a retired part of the wall, concealed from the view of the watch; and the rope being fixed, and let down, the ſervant firſt explored the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous height: but from the ſhortneſs of the rope, fell, and broke his thigh: the duke guarded againſt the ſame fate, by increaſing the length with the torn ſheets of his bed, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending ſafely, firſt carried his faithful domeſtic on his back to a place of ſecurity; and then proceeding to Newhaven made the ſignal appointed, and was received on board the ſhip, which immediately ſailed for France. The king was ſo much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized at this eſcape, almoſt from his own preſence, that he would not yield to conviction, till he had himſelf examined the priſoner's apartment, and ſeen the ſpot and inſtrument of his flight. Vain orders were given to ſearch the caſtle, and ſend out horſemen on all ſides, with promiſes of high reward, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the truth was diſcovered <note n="7" place="bottom">Ferrerius and Leſley are contented with mentioning, and both unchronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically, the flight of Albany to France. Buchanan XII, 39, details the eſcape from the caſtle; and Lindſay, 132—135, is agreeably circumſtantial, but, like moſt writers of anecdotes, is inaccurate. He ſuppoſes Albany to have fled to England in 1479, and to have perſuaded Edward to ſend an army in 1481, to deliver James from his peers. James thus reconciled became afterwards jealous of Albany, and impriſoned him in the caſtle of Edinburgh, whence he eſcaped to France in the manner mentioned in the text in 1483. A ſtrange perverſion! In 1479 Albany paſſed to France; in 1483 to England. Leſley is the only writer of our hiſtory, who knows <hi>a little, a very little,</hi> of chronology. The brief chronicle at the end of Winton, MS. Reg. 17 DXX, rightly dates the flight of Albany to France in 1479.</note>.</p>

Louis ordered Monipeny and Concreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, Scotiſhmen of rank, to attend the duke; and his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences were defrayed by the royal favour, but his train not exceeding twelve perſons there was no great room for munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence <note n="8" place="bottom">Chronique Scandaleuſe, written by a contemporary, at the end of Comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, ed. 1706, at the year 1479, p. 257.

               <p>A different fate awaited Mar, who, inſtead of an open trial by his peers, encountered a private condemnation by the king's domeſtic council, apparently conſiſting of Cochran and the other minions <note n="9" place="bottom">Ferer. f. v. 393. Buch. XII, 38. Nor does any veſtige of an open trial appear on the records.</note>. The unfortunate youth was afterwards brought from Craigmillar to the Canongate of Edinburgh, where a vein was cut, and he was allowed to bleed to death; an eaſy mode of extinction, preferred by the philoſophy of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca, and the luxury of Petronius <note n="1" place="bottom">Ferrerius, ib.

Lindſay, 119, "murdered and ſlain in the Canongate, in a bathing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat." The contemporary chronicle, at the end of Winton, ſays at 1479 that many witches and <hi>warlochs</hi> were burnt; and that Mar was SLAIN, becauſe he favoured the witches and <hi>Warlochs,</hi> (magicians.) Almoſt the only now and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable paſſage in Drummond of Hawthornden's hiſtory is, that Mar being ſeized with fever and frenzy, was put into a bath, and ſome veins opened for his cure; but he died through his own rage, or the neglect of the attendants. For this he quotes "B. W. E. who was living in that time, and whoſe records we have followed," p. 91, ed. 1655, certainly biſhop William Elphinſton, as Abercr. II, 429, and other writers infer. With reverence to Drummond's genius, and love of truth, arguments ariſe that he was here impoſed on by ſome careleſs or deſigning antiquary. 1. The hiſtory aſcribed to Elphinſton is extant in the Bodleian library, (the very copy uſed by Drummond, as appears from Craw. Off. 52,) and only extends to the death of James 1, 1437. 2. Had Drummond uſed Elphinſton's hiſtory of James II an III, (a great deſideratum in our literature,) he muſt have enriched his pages with new facts, inſtead of tranſcribing, as he does, Boyce, Ferrerius, Leſley, Buchanan. 3. The cure was new, and probably unknown in that or any age. 4. It was indiſpenſable to the king's reputation to inſtitute open informations, concerning the cauſes of his brother's death. 5. Granting the evidence, Elphinſton's teſtimony would in itſelf be highly objectionable, he being the friend of Shevis, and the favourite of James III, to whom he owed his preferments. Keith, Biſhops, 68, 69.</note>. Several perſons of both

               <p>The wars between England and Scotland now begin to be <note place="margin">1480</note> more unfrequent, and upon this account to deſerve greater attention: that which now commenced is the moſt memorable, ſince the battle of Sark, a ſpace of more than thirty years: and ſimilar diſtances divide the preſent contention, the battle of Flodden, and that of Pinkie. The great inequality of the conteſt is matter of glory to the ſmaller ſtate, which unhappily
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0141700201:311"/>either declined, or was ſtationary, in wealth, and power; while the other was rapidly progreſſive. Henceforth defeated in every great conteſt, the ſpirit of Scotland remained unim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired; and while her ſoldiers knew not the name of fear, they might execrate the caprice of chance, and the want of military ſkill, patience, and genius, in their leaders. The hiſtorian of the houſe of Douglas heſitates not to pronounce that, ſince the fall of that family, Scotland has performed few deeds of arms <note n="3" place="bottom">Hume's Dougl. I, 384.</note>: many of that illuſtrious progeny were indeed <hi>born</hi> generals, and the deficiency of ſuch ſingular genius, which depends upon great and prompt faculties, cool intuition, and a kind of preſcience, and to which the impetuoſity of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional character is highly adverſe, was repeatedly felt by this warlike kingdom.</p>
               <p>If it be often dubious, even in modern times, which of two warring nations was the aggreſſor, a ſuperior certainty is not to be expected in remote ages. Some aſſert that Edward IV was the author of hoſtilities; while others affirm that Louis XI excited the Scotiſh king to arms. The latter opinion might be ſupported by the treaty, which was entered into, in the end of the year 1479, between Edward IV and the dukes of Auſtria and Bretagne, the foes of Louis <note n="4" place="bottom">Duclos, II, 374.</note>: but as the French monarch pretended ignorance of that tranſaction, and continued to pay Edward's penſion, and to cultivate his amity, dreading leſt he ſhould openly aſſiſt the Flemings, with whom the French were at war, it does not ſeem probable that he ſhould wiſh, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing the Scots to arms, to provoke the decided enmity of England. A diverſion of a part of Edward's force was all that could have been gained; while the practices of Louis might have been puniſhed by the remainder. Other arguments againſt
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0141700201:312"/>this ſuppoſition ariſe from the ſilence of Comines, that great contemporary, and other French writers, concerning this war, or any part taken by Louis in its provocation; and from the reception of Albany in France, which argues no friendſhip between Louis and James: the truce of fifty-four years, and the marriage treaty with England, having conſiderably impaired the connection between France and Scotland. On the other hand, as is before obſerved, it is certain that in 1478 Edward, by diſcontinuing the payment of Cecilia's portion, had infringed the amity with Scotland, whoſe reſentment had only been ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the commotions in the royal family, and by the long diſuſe of war. But to guard againſt any hoſtile intention of the Scots, Edward, on the twelfth day of May 1480, had named his brother Richard duke of Gloceſter, the future uſurper, lieutenant-general of the North, and appointed him to lead an army againſt his inveterate enemy the Scotiſh king; whom he accuſes of an intention to violate the truce, and enter the Engliſh territories, "in contempt of his own ſame <note n="5" place="bottom">Rymer, XII, 115, "Spreta ipſius nominis, omniſque nobilitatis, fama." It is riſible to obſerve the ignorance of Abercromby, II, 434, and Granger, (Maitland's hiſt. II, 682,) who ſuppoſe the term <hi>nobilitas,</hi> (nobleneſs of mind, honour,) to apply in a modern ſenſe to the Scotiſh <hi>nobility;</hi> and ſagely infer that Edward was no ſtranger to the diſcontents of the Scotiſh nobles!
<p>Abercromby, II, 434, unchronologically places a ſiege of Berwick in this year, which Leſley, 321, dates 1481, Ferrerius, 394, in 1482. The chronicle at the end of Winton ſays that, in 1480, Angus burned Bamborough, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained three days in England.</p>
                  </note>." But in the ſame of crimes Edward and James were equal; and to that of virtues their pretenſions were ſimilar. Some incurſions having been made by the Scots, Edward, on the twentieth of June following, commanded his array to be in readineſs: yet no important hoſtility followed, till the enſuing year.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="298" facs="tcp:0141700201:313"/>In his averſion for war James ſent a herald to the Engliſh court, <note place="margin">1481</note> offering to redreſs any infringements of the truce com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by his ſubjects, provided that Edward would condeſcend to the ſame terms: but the herald was diſmiſſed without anſwer, a circumſtance which of itſelf ſixes the violation upon Edward <note n="6" place="bottom">Acts, 1481, f. v. 65.</note>. Louis XI having fallen into the malady, which in two years terminated his exiſtence, Edward had entered into an active alliance with Maximilian duke of Auſtria, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to pay him a penſion equal to that allowed by Louis; ſo that the Engliſh king was now at liberty to purſue his own meaſures <note n="7" place="bottom">Rymer, XII, 126, 127.</note>. <note place="margin">2 March</note> Accordingly he ordered preparations to be made for the march of his army to the frontiers <note n="8" place="bottom">Ibid. 140.</note>; and from the writs it ſeems that a ſiege was propoſed, which it is reaſonable to infer was to be directed againſt Berwick, the loſs of which was not a little regretted by the Engliſh.</p>
               <p>To provide againſt the deſigns of the enemy, <note place="margin">2 April</note> a parliament was aſſembled; the ſtatutes of which, and of ſome in preceding reigns, leave it doubtful whether the right of peace and war was conceived to belong to the king, or to the national council; but in thoſe ignorant ages no political department was properly divided or underſtood. Yet the fears, and conſcious unpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity, of James induced him to deſert his deſpotiſm on this occaſion, and to ſubmit much to the deliberations of parliament. Beſides regulations concerning the length of ſpears, and nature of defenſive armour, all perſons aſſembling to the army are prohibited, on ſevere penalties, to commit any damage, or ſpoil, in the Scotiſh dominions; and the caſtles on the borders, and eaſtern coaſt, are ordered to be repaired, and provided with garriſons, and proviſion <note n="9" place="bottom">Acts, f. 65.

About ſixty Scotiſh hamlets were burnt by the incurſions of the Engliſh; and the fleet of Edward, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the Forth, captured eight veſſels, and gave to the flames the village of Blackneſs and another ſhip which lay there; after which actions it regained its native ſhores <note n="1" place="bottom">Ferrerius, 394.

It is ſaid that James led his army into England, but was met by the papal legate, who denounced a peace among the potentates of the weſt, in order to oppoſe the Turks, who in the preceding year had taken Otranto, and alarmed all Italy: upon which the king returned, and diſmiſſed his army, while Edward little regarded the pontifical mandate <note n="5" place="bottom">Ferrerius, 394, Leſley, 321. They ludicrouſly introduce the lord of the iſles, as a mighty leader in the army of James! Had they called him Donald, the continuation of Boyce's fund of fable would have been yet more ſingular.</note>. This is highly probable in point of chronology; but as a ſimilar
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:0141700201:315"/>event occurs in a preceding reign, it is difficult to believe the repeated ſucceſs of the ſame ſtratagem; and the ſiege of Berwick not being attempted by the Engliſh, it may ſeem that the royal hoſt, eſpecially aſſembled for the defence of that place, was in conſequence diſbanded.</p>
               <p>Another parliament being ſummoned, <note place="margin">1482 18 March</note> the members engaged, with great warmth, in the national enmity againſt England <note n="6" place="bottom">Acts, f. v. 65, ſeq. and compare the edition by Murray of Glendook, p. 80, where the date, 18 March 1481-2, is rightly aſſigned. Abercromby, Granger, Guthrie, &amp;c. confound this parliament with that of April 1481. Lord Kaims, Hiſt. Law Tracts, 441, has publiſhed the trial of lord Lyle in this ſeſſion, which ſhews that it commenced on the 18th March 1481-2. The trial was on the 22d March 1482. See alſo Carm. Tracts, 63. The violence of the language was palpably excited by the ravages of the Engliſh in 1481. Incredible confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion has ariſen in our hiſtory, and records, from the varying commencement of the year, in the Roman mode 1 Jan. or according to the manner of the weſt, 25 March. See l'Art. de verifier les dates, p. iii to xi, for a complete ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation.</note>. The depredations of the Engliſh by ſea and land, being more ſenſibly felt after ſo long a period of peace, and being perhaps directed by the innate cruelty of Gloceſter, the commander in chief, appear to have excited an indignation remarkably keen. But the decency of modern times is ſurprized to find the legiſlative body uſing terms of ſuch aſperity, as repeatedly to ſtyle the Engliſh ſovereign, Edward the <hi>reifar,</hi> that is the robber, or pirate; a title due to many kings, but ſeldom employed. It is added that Edward "calls himſelf king of England," for the connection between Scotland, and Henry VI, was not forgotten. The three eſtates engage that, ſince Edward ſeems reſolved to proſecute the war, which he had unjuſtly commenced, they ſhall maintain a firm obedience to their ſovereign, with their perſons, lands, and goods, in defence of his perſon, his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, the realm, and the ſubjects; as they, and their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:0141700201:316"/>had done formerly. They order all men within the kingdom to be prepared, upon a warning of eight days, or leſs if neceſſary, to attend the king in arms, and with proviſions for at leaſt twenty days: and a regulation is given concerning couriers, or poſts, to convey orders and intelligence <note n="7" place="bottom">Louis XI began the foundation of the poſts, or rather regular offices for poſt-horſes to be uſed by royal meſſengers, in 1480, and completed the inſtitution in 1481. Duclos, II, 384, 441.</note>. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the king's great expence, in repairing and fortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the walls of Berwick, and the caſtle, in providing them with artillery, and in maintaining a garriſon of five hundred men in the town, the eſtates oblige themſelves to ſupport gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons in thirteen forts, upon the borders; the Hermitage is to receive one hundred men, the others from twenty to ſixty. This ſtatute is ſingular, and intereſting in many reſpects; the chief captains are nominated by the ſtates, who ordain that the captains ſhall appoint their lieutenants, and ſhall receive the pay of their ſoldiers at the rate of two ſhillings and ſixpence for every ſpear, and two ſhillings for each bow <note n="8" place="bottom">Acts, f. 67. Abercromby, miſled by his own notes, and confounding Roman and Arabic numerals, gravely puts <hi>eleven</hi> for <hi>two.</hi> Guthrie, IV, 154, joins the dance, though Granger, 685, had corrected the error.</note>; the garriſons conſiſting of equal portions armed with theſe weapons, and being allotted to the forts only during the month of May, after which they were to be lodged in Berwick for three months. The clergy engage to maintain two hundred and forty of theſe ſoldiers; the nobility as many; and the boroughs half that number. In another ſtatute the national council, in terms of control, and not of advice, declare that if Edward invade Scotland in perſon, the Scotiſh king ſhall appear in the field, at the head of the whole force of his realm; and the members expreſs their firm reſolution to live or die with their monarch <note n="9" place="bottom">Acts, f. v. 66.</note>.
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:0141700201:317"/>Thoſe who are attached to ſyſtems, the bane of hiſtory, might build a ſplendid ſpeculation upon ſuch decrees: but the wiſer, who prefer even inconſiſtency to ſyſtem, will be perhaps in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to found little upon the fluctuating views of a rude age, in which no branch of power was properly defined, or circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. Yet a degree of bigotry muſt be required not to perceive principles of eminent dignity, and freedom, in theſe tranſactions. The parliament was doubtleſs ariſtocratic; and the Scots having unfortunately no houſe of commons, the deputies of the burghs were annihilated by the pomp of the nobles and prelates; but ſuch had been the deſpotiſm of James that the cauſe of the nobles became that of the people. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the uſual royal influence guided this aſſembly; and the fears of James, expoſed at once to internal diſcord and foreign war, led him to extraordinary conceſſions, in order to ſtrengthen his throne by popularity. Perhaps the ariſtocracy ſeized this critical period to regain loſt authority, and, by plauſible mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, to ſecure the favour of the nation, in the meditated ſcheme againſt the king's favorites. However this be, the loyalty and unanimity expreſſed by the parliament were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely deluſive.</p>
               <p>Other ſtatutes of this aſſembly are eſſential to hiſtory. It is ordered by the king, and parliament of Scotland, that an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſy be ſent from them to the king of France, <hi>and parliament of Paris,</hi> to deſire aid; to aſſure them that James had ever been, and would be ready to act reciprocally; and to complain that Louis had returned no anſwer to repeated letters of James upon this ſubject <note n="1" place="bottom">Acts, f. 68.</note>. This furniſhes an additional proof that Louis was not the author of the war: but did the ſtrange com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment to the parliament of Paris proceed from ignorance, or
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:0141700201:318"/>from a deſign to collate the Scotiſh legiſlature with a court of juſtice? A high reward is offered for the ſlaughter, or capture of James, the exiled earl of Douglas; and even his followers are rated at proportional remunerations; that nobleman acting as a dangerous enemy in the preſent hoſtilities againſt his country <note n="2" place="bottom">Acts, f. v. 66. Among theſe followers is <hi>ſir</hi> Richard Holland, evidently a prieſt, and perhaps the author of the <hi>Houlat,</hi> a ſatire againſt James by a partizan of Douglas named Holland. Scot.

Law Tracts, 441. Carm. Tracts, 64.</note>. In recompence for the apparent loyalty of the parliament, the monarch engaged, by a formal promiſe, to attend to the impartial adminiſtration of juſtice, ſo that the people might have cauſe to rejoice in the public order, to the confuſion of the king's enemies, and of all "falſe traitors and untrue hearts," an expreſſion dangerous and ominous <note n="4" place="bottom">Acts, f. 66.</note>.</p>
               <p>The next important incident of this eventful year was the paſſage of Albany from France into England. That deluded, and deſperate, prince was inſtigated probably by the artifices of Gloceſter, who deſired ſuch an example, to aſpire to the Scotiſh crown, <note place="margin">11 June</note> and to enter into a treaty with Edward IV, diſgraceful to himſelf, and treaſonable to his country. He uſes the title, at once ambitious and degrading, of Alexander king of Scotland, by the giſt of the Engliſh king: conſents to pay homage, and to abandon ſome countries, and places on the ſouth of Scotland, particularly Berwick: and diſclaims the league with France. Edward agrees to aſſiſt Albany in reducing Scotland, and maintaining his royalty againſt James <note n="5" place="bottom">Rymer, XII, 156, 157: of the 9th May appears an order to fit out a <hi>carvell,</hi> called the Michel, commanded by James Douglas, which had lately conveyed Albany from France to England, as a ſhip in the Engliſh ſervice.

<p>Among the unpubliſhed papers of Rymer, No. 4615, art. 82, are inſtructions from Edward, 5 March 1482, to Dr. Legh, Widdrington, &amp;c. commiſſioners to the borders, to examine if lord Carlyle, and ſuch others as James ſhall ſend, be empowered to deliver up the prince of Scotland into Edward's hands, till the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage be accompliſhed.

The Scotiſh king aſſembled his array, and was upon his march to relieve that important place, when he was prevented by a revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, which calls for a pauſe and an ample detail.</p>
               <p>Though conſcious of the diſcontents of the nobles and people, James perſiſted in his attachment to mean favourites. Among theſe Cochran was the chief. This architect, whoſe ſkill, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played in the erection of ſeveral ediſices, might have been rewarded by employment, or by a penſion, became the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of royal favour; and was elevated to a giddy and invidious height of power. The liberal preſents of thoſe who ſued for his protection, and influence, ſoon conſtituted a wealth enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for the perſon, the age, the country: and a part of this baſe opulence procured from the king's avarice the earldom of Mar, the fatal dignity of his murdered brother <note n="7" place="bottom">It is moſt probable that only the revenues of the earldom were aſſigned to him, without the titles, which however his flatterers, or his own vanity, might uſe. Thus in 1471, 4th May, the earldom of <hi>Levenax,</hi> or Lennox, was granted for life to lord Evandale, with the wards and marriages of all the vaſſals. Scotſt. Cal. Yet Buchanan, XII, 46, ſpecially mentions the <hi>title</hi> of Mar as the chief ſource of the hatred of the nobility. The ſilence of the records may ariſe from the crazures of merited ſcorn.</note>. This high
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:0141700201:320"/>honour, diſgraceful to the infatuation of James and of his favourite, was followed by the utmoſt hatred, and ſcorn, of the nobility, and by the execrations of the people. But the new earl of Mar, unconſcious that his extreme elevation was an infallible ſtep to the deepeſt ruin, continued to abuſe his power, and that of his ſovereign, and to increaſe his wealth by every ſpecies of peculation. His oppreſſion extended to all ranks of men. The nobles beheld the places, formerly given by the king to their ſons, now ſold to Mar's followers: the prelates, and dignitaries of the church, ſighed at the increaſe of ſimony: even the daily pittance of the poor did not eſcape, for Cochran had debaſed the current ſilver, with a degree of alloy, which rendered it <hi>black money,</hi> a fraud which led to his ruin, and that of his maſter; and which has been erroneouſly confounded with the <hi>billon</hi> coinage, ordained by the parliament of 1466, which was intended for the benefit of the poor, and was continued in all the ſucceeding reigns. But this corruption of the money was peculiar to that of James III, and was ſuch that the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, and farmers, rather choſe to let the grain rot in their granaries, than to receive the price in ſuch dubious metal: and the populace afterwards repeated with exultation the propheſy of Mar, who, when he was told that his coin would be recalled, anſwered, as an impoſſibility, "That day I ſhall be hanged." In ſhort the whole honour and welfare of the king, and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, were ſacrificed on the domeſtic altar of this baſe, and covetous, minion <note n="8" place="bottom">Lindſay, 119, 120.

               <p>Some of the peers had formerly aſſembled, and conſulted upon the means of delivering the realm from the diſgrace, and deſtruction, inflicted by Cochran, and the other royal favourites.
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:0141700201:321"/>A nobel deputation had even been ſent to the king, requeſting that he would diſmiſs theſe pernicious counſellors; and reſtore the confidence placed by his anceſtors in the loyalty of the nobility. The anſwer of James was far from ſatisfactory; but the peers aſſented to delay; and diſſembled till ſome deciſive occaſion ſhould ariſe. An occaſion now occurred, ſuch as the Scotiſh nobles, to their ſingular diſgrace, have been accuſtomed to ſeize, from the reign of the firſt to the termination of that of the fifth James. Inſtead of uſing the proper period of peace, the proper place of parliament, the day of war, and the camp, have afforded the ruinous ſcene of internal diſſention; and the ſacred intereſts and glory of their country have often been abandoned by the nobility, to gratify a juſt, or unjuſt reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt their ſovereign. But the fatal forms of a Scotiſh parliament, ſo well adapted to royal influence, the conception that it was a royal court, the incapacity of rude nobles to ſpeak againſt an educated clergy, ever devoted to the king the ſource of their fleeting dignities, contribute greatly to abſolve the nobles from this imputation; and it is matter of regret, rather than of ſurpriſe, that they always ſeized the only occaſion when their power was collected and firm.</p>
               <p>The Scotiſh array, amounting to about fifty thouſands, had crouded to the royal banner at Burrough-muir near Edinburgh, <note place="margin">July</note> whence they marched to Soutray, and to Lauder, at which place they encamped between the church and the village <note n="9" place="bottom">Lindſay, 122. Ferrer. f. v. 394. Leſley, 321. Buch. XII, 40.</note>. Cochran, earl of Mar, conducted the artillery; and his preſence and pomp were additional inſults. On the morning after their arrival at Larder, the peers aſſembled in a ſecret council, in the church, and deliberated upon their deſigns of revenge. The earls of Angus, Argyle, Huntley, Orkney or Caithneſs,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:0141700201:322"/>Crawford, the lords Home, Fleming, Gray, Drummond, Hales, and Seton, are chiefly mentioned upon this occaſion; and the diſcontent muſt have ſpread far when we find Evandale the chancellor, and ſome biſhops united to the above names <note n="1" place="bottom">So Lindſay, 123, but this is dubious. Leſley's enumeration is Angus, Huntley, <hi>Lennox,</hi> Buchan, Gray, Lyle. Lindſay's <hi>Bothwell</hi> is lord Hales, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſo ſtyled.</note>. In the courſe of the debate Gray took occaſion to introduce an apologue: the mice conſulted upon the means of deliverance from their tyrannic enemy the cat, and agreed that a bell ſhould be ſuſpended about her neck, to notify her approach and their danger; but what mouſe had courage ſufficient to faſten the bell? "I ſhall bell the cat," exclaimed the impatience of Angus, in whom a current of the blood of Douglas flowed; and the homely times conferred upon him the appellation of Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bald Bell the Cat. It was concluded that the king ſhould be put in a gentle impriſonment, in the caſtle of Edinburgh: and that all his favourites ſhould be inſtantly hanged over the bridge of Lauder.</p>
               <p>Cochran, ignorant of their deſigns, at length left the royal preſence to proceed to the council. This upſtart earl was attended by three hundred men, armed with light battle-axes, and diſtinguiſhed by his livery of white with black fillets. He was clothed in a riding cloak of black velvet, and wore a large chain of gold around his neck: his horn of the chaſe, or of battle, was adorned with gold and precious ſtones: and his helmet, overlaid with the ſame valuable metal, was born before him <note n="2" place="bottom">Even his pavilions were of ſilk, and the faſtening chains were richly gilt. Lindſay, 124.</note>. Approaching the door of the church, he commanded an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant to knock with authority; and Sir Robert Douglas of Lochleven, who guarded the paſſage, enquiring the name, was
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:0141700201:323"/>anſwered, "'Tis I, the earl of Mar," Cochran, and ſome of his friends, were admitted: Angus advanced to him, and pulling the golden chain from his neck, ſaid "A rope will become thee better;" while Douglas of Lochleven ſeized his hunting horn, declaring that he had been too long a hunter of miſchief. Rather aſtoniſhed than alarmed, Cochran ſaid, "My lords is it jeſt or earneſt?" To which it was replied, "It is good earneſt, and ſo thou abuſed our prince's favour; but no longer expect ſuch advantage, for thou and thy followers ſhall now reap the deſerved reward."</p>
               <p>Having ſecured Mar, the lords diſpatched ſome men at arms to the king's pavilion, conducted by two or three moderate and prudent leaders, who amuſed James while their followers ſeized the favourites. Sir William Roger the Engliſh muſician, Preſton a gentleman, Hommil, Torphichan, Leonard, and others, were inſtantly hanged over the bridge at Lauder. John Ramſay of Balmain, having claſped the king's perſon, was alone ſpared. Cochran was now brought out, his hands bound with a rope; and his weak pride deſiring to exchange the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious bonds of a thief for the ſilken cords of his own pavilion, he was anſwered that he was a traitor and only found merited ſhame: he was conducted to the bridge, and hanged above his companions <note n="3" place="bottom">Lindſay, 125. Ferrerius, 395. Leſley, 322. Buchanan, XII, 45.</note>.</p>
               <p>Such was the influence of the ariſtocracy over their warlike followers, that the king was conveyed to the caſtle of Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, without commotion or murmur. Here he was ſerved with reſpect: but was attended by ſome of the peers, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his conduct, and prevent his eſcape, till he ſhould give ample ſecurity not to revenge the death of his favourites; to
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:0141700201:324"/>which he ſhewed obſtinate repugnance. Except this conſtraint, his will was unviolated, and the royal authority remained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>impaired <note n="4" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile the Engliſh army had acquired poſſeſſion of the town of Berwick: and the generals, Gloceſter and Albany, learning that the Scotiſh army was diſbanded, and the king impriſoned, left a party to conduct the ſiege of Berwick caſtle, and advanced with the main force to Endinburgh <note n="5" place="bottom">Ferrer. 396. Leſley, 322. Buch. XII, 47.</note>. Their ſubſequent conduct is not a little myſterious. The capture, or death, of James, and the coronation of Albany might have been expected from the Engliſh treaty: but the next authentic paper preſents to us Albany ſuing for his pardon from James; and our early hiſtorians, ignorant of Albany's ambition, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent him as the deliverer of his brother from the power of the nobles. If, with ſome writers, we believe that James was not impriſoned in the caſtle of Edinburgh, but choſe that fortreſs as a ſecure retreat, the difficulty remains the ſame, or greater <note n="6" place="bottom">The impriſonment is however certain from two charters. Ruddiman's preface to Anderſon's diplomata, and notes on Buchanan, I, 445.</note>. Even records cannot atone for the want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary hiſtorians; and in ſuch England and Scotland are at this period barren. That Edward IV and Albany were ſincere in their agreement appears from its renewal in the following year; which alſo inſtructs us that Angus and Gray were then, if not before, engaged in the treaſonable ambition of Albany. Hence almoſt the only rational view which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents itſelf is, that Albany, finding a great majority of the nobles, and the popular voice, completely adverſe to his unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and baſe ſchemes <note n="7" place="bottom">The continuator of Harding poſitively ſays that Gloceſter gave peace to Scotland, becauſe the peers did not join Albany.</note>, was forced to temporize, and accept
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:0141700201:325"/>a pardon, and the reſtoration of his eſtates; in the hopes that his preſence, and influence, might ſtrengthen his pretenſions before their open declaration. The acquiſition of Berwick would afford a prize ſufficient to ſatisfy Gloceſter; who might judge, from perſonal knowledge, that a delay was more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient than the perdition of the ſcheme by precipitation.</p>
               <p>The Engliſh army amounted only to about ſixteen thouſand; and the materials for a ſiege had been left before Berwick; hence the capture of the caſtle of Edinburgh, and of James, could hardly be attempted by ſo few battalions, liable ſoon to be ſurrounded or intercepted by a ſuperior force. A Scotiſh army was actually aſſembling at Haddington, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of ſeveral patriotic peers; and even the courage of Gloceſter might tremble at the proſpect of a battle, without the poſſibility of a retreat <note n="8" place="bottom">Ferrer. 397, Leſley, 322.</note>. An hiſtorian informs us that thoſe peers prevailed on Albany to paſs to their party, upon an offer of appointing him lieutenant general of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <note n="9" place="bottom">Leſley, 322, who adds that the earldoms of Mar and <hi>March</hi> were to be given to Albany. The latter was in fact reſtored by his deliverance from the forfeiture. Had he ſaid Mar and Garioch, he would have been exact. See the grant, Rudd. Buch. I, 445.</note>; a rank tempting to his ambition, for he might, with greater certainty, aſpire to the crown by Scotiſh, than by Engliſh, aid. However this be, after a brief negotiation, Shevis, the archbiſhop of St. Andrews, Livington the biſhop of Dunkeld, lord Evandale the chancellor, and the earl of Argyle, all rather eminent in attachment to James, entered into a ſolemn engagement with Albany, <note place="margin">2 Aug.</note> that if he preſerved his duty to the king, and the terms of his bond to them, and other Scotiſh lords, his lands and offices ſhould be reſtored, and he and his followers receive an amneſty: they alſo engaged
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:0141700201:326"/>that the king ſhould ratify the treaty in the next parliament <note n="1" place="bottom">Rymer, XII, 160.</note>.

They narrate that James being ſtill retained in the caſtle of Edinburgh, under the care of Athole his uncle, the adminiſtration was conducted by Albany, Evandale the chancellor, and Shevis archbiſhop of St. Andrews; that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bany paſſing to viſit the queen Margaret of Denmark, and the prince her ſon, at Sterling, was inſtigated by her to deliver the king; which he effected after a ſiege of ſome duration, upon which Argyle, Shevis, and the chancellor, fled in conſternation to their reſpective places of abode. Albany hence acquired ſo much favour from his royal brother, that they ſhared one bed and one table <note n="7" place="bottom">Ferrer. 397. Leſl. 323. Buch. XII, 50. Lindſay, 130.

<p>Our ignorance of the views of parties, at this period, creates deep obſcurity. Abercromby, a warm defender of James III, and enemy of Albany, denies the fact, II, 452. But a partizan is little calculated to throw light, where even a candid writer may be bewildered. Neither Albany nor James were entitled to complete fame or reproach. They wavered, like the many, between vice and virtue. Albany ſeems to have aſpired to the government, on the plan of his predeceſſors in the title, Robert and Murdac. This probably was the cauſe of his forfeiture in 1479; and when he gained this in Auguſt 1482, he was ſatisfied. But finding that the former council of James conteſted his authority, and uſurped the royal power in the name of the captive monarch, whom Athole one of their cabal guarded, he would naturally wiſh to have the king in his own power; and ſeems to have offered to free James, provided that he was named lord lieutenant of the kingdom, and had a gift of Mar and Garioch. This eaſy theory reconciles hiſtory and records.</p>
                     <p>Leſley errs concerning the reſignation of the archbiſhopric by Shevis, (ſo called from a village in Aberdeenſhire,) to Andrew Stuart.

If Buchanan be believed, a private pique of James gave occaſion to the condemnation of this peer: for the king having ſeduced Crichton's wife, he, in revenge, found means to win the love of Margaret, the ſiſter of James, by whom he had a daughter named Margaret Crichton, who died not long before our great hiſtorian compoſed his work.

Douglas, now old and unwieldy, was conveyed to the royal preſence; but, either from ſhame or ſcorn, turned his back on the ſon of James II, the deſtroyer of his houſe: a ray of pity illuminated the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potic mind of the king, who had now himſelf taſted misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: he ſentenced the years and infirmities of Douglas, who had been educated to the church, to the religious retirement of Lindoris abbey, while the earl's indifference muttered, "he who may no better be, muſt be a monk."

As the truce permitted the capture of Dunbar, the parliament adviſes the king to proceed againſt that fortreſs, on the firſt day of May; and the right of peace and war again dubiouſly appears, in the particular directions given by the legiſlature. An embaſſy is alſo appointed to the pope, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his confirmation of the French alliance, and of the treaty with Denmark concerning the Orkneys and Shetland; and this embaſſy Shevez, the archbiſhop of St. Andrews, offers to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake at his own expence; a ſingularity, which like the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penditure of the commiſſion to England, betrays great penury of royal revenue. A further ſolicitation was to be moved to the pontiff, that he would grant to the Scotiſh kings a power of ſuperſeding, for ſix months, the diſpenſations to vacant biſhoprics; that they might have time to advance the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch as they could truſt, the biſhops having the firſt vote in parliament, and being of the privy council.

The weak obſtinacy of James was ignorant that there are barriers, and prejudices, which even eaſtern deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm dares not to infringe. Thinking that the ſpirit of the nobility was fled with Albany, the monarch iſſued a mandate that the nobles ſhould no longer wear arms, as before, within the precincts of the court <note n="5" place="bottom">Ferrerius, 399. Guthrie, often affecting to think for himſelf, and often thinking with puerility, contends, IV, 209, againſt Dr. Robertſon concerning this inſtitution, and confounds the court with courts of juſtice!</note>: to add to the diſgrace, Ramſay, the favourite who had eſcaped, and who had been recently created lord Bothwell, was excepted, as captain of the royal guard, and inſtitution which apparently originated in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding reign <note n="6" place="bottom">Our antiquaries, amid their cager purſuit of trifles, neglect objects of real curioſity and importance; and the want of diſſertations on obſcure points of Scotiſh hiſtory is much to be regreted.

From Scotſtarvet's Calendars it appears that, in 1473, <hi>Mr.</hi> David Guthrie was captain of the king's guard, and George Bell lieutenant.</note>.

There is no evidence that the congreſs, appointed to be held by the commiſſioners of England and Scotland in January, took effect; and it even ſeems that the caprice of the Scotiſh king, <note place="margin">May</note> or ſome other cauſe, had alienated Henry, who granted a ſafe-conduct, in terms rather unuſual, to the biſhops of Glaſgow and Dunkeld, the earl of Argyle chancellor of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, the lords Hales and Lyle, the <hi>maſters,</hi> or heirs of Darnley and Home, with one hundred and ſixty attendants <note n="9" place="bottom">Ibid, XII, 340, May. On the 30th Jan. Henry had iſſued a commiſſion to Northumberland, to treat of peace, ib. 334. On the 2d Feb. a ſafe conduct appears to twelve perſons, not named, as envoys ſent by James, ib. In May a commiſſion was given to two people of inferior rank, to treat of a peace; but perhaps really to negotiate with the conſpirators, ib. 340.

<pb n="328" facs="tcp:0141700201:343"/>embaſſadors, but for cauſes unknown, and the more extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary as ſome of them undoubtedly belonged to the conſpiracy, and a rational ſuſpicion muſt affect the others. On all ſides it is agreed that the former traitors, Angus and Gray, united to them Home, juſtly enraged at a deſpotic violation of private property; the firſt and the laſt nobleman being the chief authors of the rebellion. The power of the Hepburns was led into it by lord Hales; and the treaſon of the lords Drummond, and Lyle, is equally unqueſtionable. Darnley, or Lennox, is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the ſame charge, from the ſtrong teſtimony of the earlieſt narration, and from the mention of his ſon in the Engliſh paſſport; which fixes a ſtain on Argyle, the leſs eaſily to be overcome, as he alſo appears in the moſt ancient account. When it is added that to theſe great names afterwards acceded Huntley, Errol, the earl Marſhal, and lord Glamis, the impolicy of James, which could alienate ſo many chiefs, muſt appear in a ſtriking point of view; and the rebellious war of Douglas, in the preceding reign, ſinks into unimportance, when compared with this grand confederacy <note n="1" place="bottom">For the names of the peers who oppoſed James compare Ferrerius, f. 399, Leſley, (who however ſeems here to copy the former,) p. 327: Lindſay, 139, names Angus, <hi>Evandale,</hi> the Hepburns, (ſo underſtand) his erroneous earl of Bothwell,) Home, 140, Gray, Drummond; and from p. 142 it appears that the men were chiefly borderers, whom the juſtice of James wiſhed to repreſs. It muſt be obſerved that <hi>lord</hi> Home is here ſo ſtyled by anticipation, as he did not bear the title till 1489, on the death of his grandfather, a very aged peer. Douglas, 344. Buchanan hardly mentions any names. The dereliction of the royal party by Huntley, Errol, Marſhal, Glamis, is evinced from the act of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity, Acts, f. 82. The records, and events, of the firſt year of James IV alſo preſent veracious teſtimony. Argyle's continuance as chancellor indicates his being one of the rebels. Oliphant, who ſat on the forfeiture againſt Ramſay lord Bothwell, with five of thoſe above-mentioned, may alſo be ſuſpected: and Seton and Fleming, from Lindſay, 146. Redpath, 457, ſuſpects the biſhops of Glaſgow and Dunkeld, named in the English ſafe-conduct; as <hi>ſpiritual</hi> lords are mentioned in the papal remiſſion. Add that the parliament of James IV, Jan. 1489, conſtituted Glaſgow an archbiſhopric in favour of Blacader. Carm. 75.

The cauſes of the conſpiracy have already ariſen to view, in the courſe of the narration: the open pretext was that James had introduced Engliſhmen into the kingdom, with a deſign to ſubdue it to his own abſolute power, and to foreign influence <note n="3" place="bottom">Act of indemnity, Acts, f. v. 82. The charge is ridiculous, and evinces the innocence of James, and the ignorance of the rebels. See the accuſation of Buchan, 8 Oct. 1488, Carm. 77, as a ſharer in the <hi>treaſon,</hi> which was to bring Engliſhmen and their king into Scotland, and to ſell the country to the earl of Northumberland and <hi>ſir William Tilder!</hi> A ſingular obſcurity ſurrounds the events of 1488 and 1489. James probably applied to Northumberland, to aſſiſt him, by invading the borders, the inhabitants of which were his chief enemies; and hence the accuſation againſt himſelf and Buchan.

                  <pb n="330" facs="tcp:0141700201:345"/>Of the events which preceded the deciſive engagement, Buchanan has, contrary to his uſual practice, given the moſt ample and accurate detail, and the moſt concordant with the original records. According to that hiſtorian, James ſhewed diſtinguiſhed favour to Crawford, whom he afterwards created duke of Montroſe; and to Angus, whoſe conduct at Lauder, and attachment to Albany, he affected to forget. But the king's diſſimulation and inſincerity being known, Angus regarded this new affection as only the ſnare of his own deſtruction, and even ſuſpected that his powerful concurrence was courted againſt the peers, with a view to ſow diviſion and ruin, afterwards to recoil upon his own head. It is aſſerted that the factious nobles being aſſembled at Edinburgh, <note place="margin">Jan.</note> the king invited Angus to the caſtle, and propoſed to him to lend his aſſiſtance in making them priſoners. Inſtead of compliance, the earl diſcloſed the deſign to the peers, and joined them in their retreat <note n="4" place="bottom">Buchan. XII, 56, 57. The deep ſhades of this hiſtorian are ſomewhat ſoftened. He ſays that James propoſed to Angus to aſſaſſinate the rebellious peers; but Ferrerius, 400, allows that the king had a marked averſion to ſhedding blood. The aſſemblage of the peers at Edinburgh could only have been on account of the ſeſſion of parliament, there held on the 29th Jan. in which James, as above-mentioned, created four new peers, Carm. 72, with a view to weaken the old ariſtocracy; but one of them, Drummond, ungratefully joined the rebels. On the rebellion of Douglas 1454 many new peers had been, for the ſame reaſon, created.</note>.</p>
               <p>In conſequence of this moſt imprudent confidence, after the deſertion of Angus, the chief potentate on the ſouth of the Forth, who could have assiſted him againſt the rebellious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of the remainder, James diſtruſting the whole of that region, reſolved to paſs into the north, which remained devoted to his intereſts. With his uſual imprudence he croſſed the Forth in one of ſir Andrew Wood's veſſels, employed in the Flemiſh trade. A report immediately ſpread that the king,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:0141700201:346"/>overcome by his fears, had quitted the realm to retire into Flanders; and amid the general conſternation the rebels took the caſtle of Dunbar, and advanced to Leith. Having iſſued order to the array of Fife, Strathern, and Angus, to attend his ſtandard upon an appointed day, James proceeded to Aberdeen, where the northern counties eagerly poured forth their bands in defence of the royal cauſe <note n="5" place="bottom">Leſley's account, 328, 329, is very defective. Ferrerius, f. v. 399, f. 400, confounds the affair at Blackneſs with that at Sauchy; and Lindſay falls into the ſame error p. 137-144; at p. 142 of his hiſtory a hiatus ſhould be marked before the paragraph, "Thus the king being in order," &amp;c. as all before relates to the firſt encounter; and after to the ſecond.</note>.</p>
               <p>The king now returned to Perth with his ſtandard diſplayed, and followed by Athole his uncle, by Huntley, Crawford, and many northern peers and chiefs, and by a numerous army. As he advanced David Lindſay of the Byres, who had gathered warlike experience in the campaigns of France, joined him with a thouſand horſe, and three thouſand infantry, if we credit the, perhaps, partial relation of Lindſay the hiſtorian; who adds, that the king accepted from his hands the ominous preſent of a grey courſer, more fit as would ſeem for flight than for attack. Among others who furniſhed their array, lord Ruthven was alſo remarkable, who led a thouſand gentlemen on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, provided with defenſive armour and ſpears, a thouſand bowmen, and a thouſand armed with ſwords and mail. When James had reached Stirling, he was followed by thirty thouſand men, who only wanted a leader <note n="6" place="bottom">Lindſay, 140, who adds, "by commons," or excluſive of the common at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants of an army. Ferrerius, 400, eſtimates forty thouſand.</note>.</p>
               <p>Thus prepared he advanced againſt the rebels, who had not been deficient in their preparations. <note place="margin">April?</note> He found them near Blackneſs, on the ſouth of the Forth; and an indeciſive ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh followed, in which Crawford, ſir Thomas Turnbull, who
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:0141700201:347"/>bore the royal banner, and Innes of Innes, eminently diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed their valour. But both parties being ſenſible of the odiouſneſs of ſhedding civil blood, and dreading the abſolute deciſion of the conteſt, a negotiation commenced; the king ſubſcribed ſome unknown articles, and delivered Athole to Hales as a pledge of their accompliſhment. The armies were diſmiſſed, and tranquillity was for a very ſhort time reſtored <note n="7" place="bottom">Even Buchanan blends with this ſingular tranſaction ſome circumſtances, palpably belonging to the events of June, as the capture of the prince by the rebels, which, if it had occurred, would have rendered the deliverance of Athole as a pledge uſeleſs, a ſuperior ſecurity being already in their hands. Nor does he hint at any conflict, though the <hi>battle</hi> at Blackneſs be mentioned in the creation of Crawford, duke of Montroſe, for his ſervices in "the ſaid battle," Scotſt. Cal. 18 May 1488. Rudd. Buch. I, 446. Of the ſame date is a charter to ſir Thomas Turnbull of Greenwood, who bore the king's banner. Scotſt. Cal. Of the 24th May is one to Innes of Innes, ib. of the 17th to Colleſs of Balnamone, and Somer of Balyard, confirmed March 1500. Ib. under the latter date. All are for ſervices on this occaſion. Lord Kilmauris was created earl of Glencairn; but the title died in a few weeks with its owner, and was not revived till 1503.</note>. Thus did the timidity of James loſe an occaſion never to be recalled.</p>
               <p>The demands of the rebels appear to have been exorbitant; and James eluding or delaying their accompliſhment, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates gradually extended their influence, and projects, till at length they inſiſted on the king's abdication, and the ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of his ſon in the regency, or on the throne <note n="8" place="bottom">Buch. XII, 59.</note>.</p>
               <p>The monarch learning this formidable deſign diſpatched envoys to France, and England, to ſolicit the immediate inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of theſe powers, by embaſſadors to mediate between him and the diſcontented ariſtocracy: but this mediation, if effected, was fruitleſs <note n="9" place="bottom">Ferrer. f. v. 399. Leſl. 328. Buch. XII, 59.</note>. The royal heralds, ſent to ſummon the refractory peers, were treated with contempt and perſonal
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:0141700201:348"/>injury; and their written mandates torn in deriſion. Both parties again prepared to terminate the diſpute in the field. James fortified the caſtle of Edinburgh, <note place="margin">May</note> where the treaſure ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulated by the unwiſe avarice of many years was placed; and again ſent to ſummon the northern chiefs to his ſtandard.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile the conſpiring peers found means to corrupt Shaw of Sauchy, in whoſe charge the prince had been left at Stirling; and the infamous governor ſurrendered the innocent youth, who was conducted to Linlithgow, and by conſtraint was to appear guilty of a father's blood. It was artfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed that James ſought the life of his ſon, whoſe defence had called the peers to war; and the prince's name was itſelf an army. A part of the king's treaſure, which had formerly been ſeized at Leith, contributed to provide waggons for baggage and ſtores, and to attract the deſperate and the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary <note n="1" place="bottom">Lindſay, 139, 140. Buch. XII, 58. Our hiſtorians ſeem unanimous that the prince was in the hands of the faction, before the affair of Blackneſs; but ſome difficulties attend that ſuppoſition; and they, as mentioned, confound the tranſactions.</note>.</p>
               <p>James proceeded to Stirling, to join the peers of the north and weſt, who were advancing with their troops. On his arrival the treacherous governor denied him admittance. In the north, Huntley, Errol, the earl Marſhal, and Glamis, had now deſerted the royal cauſe; and the junction of ſuch diſtant troops as continued their attachment was attended with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary delay. In the impatience of irreſolution James was led to commit his fortunes to a battle. Glencairn, and other peers of the weſt, having joined the royal army, the king advanced to meet the rebels, who had paſſed the Carron; and a field, about a mile ſouth of the famous ſcene of Bannocburn, was to
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:0141700201:349"/>be the ſpot of this civil conſlict <note n="2" place="bottom">It is called Little Canglar, on the eaſt ſide of Sauchy-burn. Nimmo's Stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingſhire, 226.</note>. The army of the peers was apparently ſuperior in number to the royal battalions: <note place="margin">18 June</note> but the cowardice, and inſtantaneous flight, of the king terminated the action, with ſmall effuſion of blood. It was in vain to defend a cauſe thus betrayed by its patron; and the adverſe ranks ſhrunk from the horrors of mutual ſlaughter. Yet a few ſhowers of arrows had darkened the air, and the long ſpears of Annandale had made an impreſſion on his array, before James left the field: Glencairn, Ruthven, Erſkine, and a few others of rank, were ſlain; and many were wounded <note n="3" place="bottom">Fetrer. 400. Lindſay, 142. Buch. XII, 61. The date alſo appears in the chartulary of Glaſgow, MS. Harl. 4631.</note>.</p>
               <p>As the king, in his ſlight, was about to paſs the rivulet Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocburn, at the hamlet of Miltown <note n="4" place="bottom">Nimmo, 230.</note>, a woman, who was drawing water, alarmed at his appearance, and rapidity, fled, and left her pitcher, which ſtartled the ſteed, or diſordered his career, ſo that the unexperienced rider fell from the ſaddle, and oppreſſed with the weight of his armour fainted away. A miller and his wife conveyed their unknown ſovereign into a corner of the mill; and, to conceal the ſtranger from any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuers, they covered him with a cloth. Some time after he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed his ſenſes; but perceiving himſelf much hurt, and very weak, he called for a prieſt to hear his confeſſion: and to his blunt hoſts, who enquired his name and quality, his impatience anſwered, "I was your king this morning." The woman upon this ran into the road, wringing her hands, and calling aloud for a prieſt to the king. It ſo chanced that ſome of the rebels were in the neighbourhood, engaged in diſorderly purſuit; and a prieſt, one of lord Gray's followers as is ſaid, riding up, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:0141700201:350"/>"I am a prieſt, where is the king?" Being conducted to the place, he knew his ſovereign; and kneeling enquired if he thought he might ſurvive, by the help of ſurgery, to which James anſwered, "I believe that I might; but let me have a prieſt to hear my confeſſion, and to bring me the euchariſt." The prieſt, it is averred, heard his confeſſion; and then ſtabbed the unfortunate monarch: whoſe weakneſs deſerved a milder fate than to fall the victim of a lawleſs ariſtocracy, more inimical to public order, and proſperity, than the feeble deſpotiſm of their ſovereign<note n="5" place="bottom">Ferrer. f. 400, Leſley, 329, Lindſay, 143, 144, Buch. XII, 61. Nimmo, 230, ſays the houſe, where this atrocious deed was committed, is ſtill in exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and is called Beton's miln, probably from its proprietor at the time.</note>.</p>
               <p>On this important event ſome reflections naturally ariſe. Had James been victorious, the power of the Scotiſh ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy might have been cruſhed for ever; and, weak and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potic as he was, it would have been better for the people to have had one tyrant than many. But this monarch, (if we ſet the dubious murder of his brother aſide,) was more weak than vicious; and even when his feebleneſs and impolicy are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, it is rather in a relative than in a poſitive view, for his conduct was chiefly blameable, becauſe ill-adapted to the fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious times and people, which required, in the character of ſovereign, the duties of a magiſtrate, and the valour and ſkill of a general. Had James lived a century or two later, his faults would perhaps have eſcaped obſervation. But the conduct of the rebellious peers, whoſe ſanguinary luſt of power, and eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to continue their lawleſs rapine, oppoſed the ſon in open combat againſt his father, that laſt infamy of civil war, cannot be too ſeverely reprobated. They excite horror, while the monarch attracts a reverential compaſſion. Loyalty, in ſome caſes only the virtue of a ſlave, is in many the trueſt patriotiſm;
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:0141700201:351"/>and it is no wonder that men of eminent ſenſe and integrity have manifeſted an attachment to the houſe of Stuart, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching even to enthuſiaſm. For its intereſts, in oppoſition to thoſe of that wild, ignorant, and ferocious ariſtocracy, which long continued to diſgrace Scotland, were thoſe of the country at large. The exuberant power of the peers, ever eager to gratify their private ambition at the expence of the nation, was the ſole ſpring of the noted misfortunes of the houſe of Stuart. A long reign<note n="6" place="bottom">It is remarkable that ſome hiſtorians hint that James IV fell not at Flodden, but by the hands of ſome one of his peers; and perhaps a theoriſt might infer that the cannon which deſtroyed the ſecond James was not overcharged without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign. But the deaths of James I, the III, the V, were cauſed ſolely by the ariſtocracy.</note>, a ſtable government, would have circumſcribed their ruinous ſway, would have prevented their plans of public plunder; and they ſighed for a minority, a regency, the peculiar ſeaſon of their arrogance, of their ſpoil. The regency of Robert duke of Albany had taught them the ſweets of ſharing the royal power, domains, and revenue; and had contributed to the ſeparation of their intereſts from thoſe of the monarch, whoſe influence reſted on their ſupport, and whoſe limited wealth and authority could little withſtand their continued encroachments. Yet by uncandid or ſuperficial obſervers, the deſire of our kings to reſume their juſt magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy, and to enforce equal laws, has been interpreted as a deſign to overturn the ariſtocracy, while the royal meaſures were ſolely thoſe of defence. But as the peers really poſſeſſed the chief power, it is no wonder that hiſtorians living at the period, flattered, as uſual, the leading authority; and have dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed over their pages calumnies againſt their ſovereigns, eaſy to form and difficult to eradicate. In England, and in France, the fall of the ariſtocracy about this time was occaſioned by
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:0141700201:352"/>chance, by the revolution of human affairs; in the former country by the wars of York and Lancaſter, in which moſt of the ancient noble families periſhed; in the latter by a ſimilar deſtruction in the ſtruggles againſt England: no power of the ſovereign could have effectuated ſo vaſt a plan, even in thoſe more civilized countries: and to impute ſuch a deſign to the ſucceſſive princes of the houſe of Stuart, ſeems the exceſs of ſyſtem and theory, the bane of hiſtorical veracity.</p>
               <p>James III fell the victim of the ambition of others, and not of his own. He had held the ſceptre nearly twenty-eight years, though his age amounted not to thirty-ſix. His iſſue were James his heir; a ſecond James marquis of Ormond, and afterwards duke of Roſs, and archbiſhop of St. Andrews; John earl of Mar.

                  <p>THE origin,<note place="margin">1437—1488</note> and progreſs, of civilization ſeem more to depend on fortuitous circumſtances, than upon any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion of human power, or wiſdom. In India, and Egypt, countries diſtinguiſhed by the firſt dawn of ſcience, the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral fertility of the ſoil redeemed much time from labour; and gave leiſure to the mind to build ſpeculations of knowledge and improvement, of art and luxury. Yet that much depends upon the ability of the governors, may be judged from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the lawgivers of antiquity, and of Peter the great, and others in modern times.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="339" facs="tcp:0141700201:354"/>No theme can be more important than the means of diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing civilization in a barbarous country, yet the richeſt libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries will be found to preſent no diſquiſition on this grand topic. Sir Walter Raleigh has obſerved that "the wiſdom of one age is the fooliſhneſs of another;" and the remark is peculiarly verified in the labyrinths of fruitleſs ſcience, while the paths of uſeful knowledge are ſeldom explored. Many eminent writers have recently reviewed the progreſs of ſociety, from the foreſt to the city, from the feeble canoe to the wooden fortreſs which conveys a thouſand mariners, and thunders its mandates in the moſt diſtant ſeas: but the ſacred plans of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving whole nations, of educating the barbaric mind to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and peace, of ſpeedily advancing a community from rudeneſs to refinement, have not yet attracted the attention which their high importance demands. The very theory would afford uſeful views, and expand political and moral knowledge: but leaving this vaſt theme to the ſedulous labour of philoſophy, the preſent object only warrants a few brief re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections.</p>
                  <p>Amid the various queſtions concerning government, it has rarely been diſcuſſed to what particular ſtages of ſociety the different forms are beſt adapted. One of the chief intentions of government, and ſociety, is to advance the national wiſdom and proſperity; and it ſeems a ſelf-evident propoſition that a democracy of ſavages, or barbarians, would be a mere anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy; and that equality of ignorance, and equality of miſery, would be among the moſt ſacred rights of its conſtitution. As the advantages of laws would be unknown, it would be vain to expect a lawgiver to ariſe; and the more ſagacious could only conſolidate the maſs by the cement of ſome degrading ſuperſtition, in itſelf the very ſtrongeſt obſtacle to knowledge and improvement. But the habits of man forbid ſuch a ſtate
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:0141700201:355"/>to exiſt, except in theory; and an ariſtocracy of chiefs and of prieſts, of ſtrength and of wiſdom, is the earlieſt ſtage of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety yet diſcovered in any country. Even here the ſmallneſs of the communities, their jarring intereſts, their continual conflicts, preſent an inſuperable barrier to improvement; and ſuch is the path of providence in drawing good from evil, that the firſt tyrant who overcomes all the others, and uſurps the ſtyle of monarch, may be hailed as the father of his country. Superſtition, the execration of civilized nations, is in this ſtage moſt uſeful, as uniting the people in one great body politic, and as aſſiſting the imperfection of the laws. The blended tribes aſpire to be a nation, the government aſſumes a ſtable form; the monarch muſt employ the moſt able men in the country, or invite foreign talents, to render his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity laſting and reſpectable; and the court thus becomes a focus of civilization, which muſt enlarge the more rapidly in proportion to the aſcendancy of the regal power. Uncivilized nations may be regarded as in a ſtate of infancy, incapable of judging what is for their benefit; and exertions, even of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiſm, to render a nation more happy, may, it is believed, be pardoned by the warmeſt advocate for univerſal democracy.</p>
                  <p>Such have been the uniform ſteps of civilization, in all ancient and modern nations. The democracies of Greece had paſſed through the ordeal of monarchy: and if the republican form of government be ever found convenient and durable, in a large country, even after the invention of repreſentation, it muſt be when the national character has been enlightened, and improved in a ſuperlative degree.</p>
                  <p>No error can be more fatal to the balance of hiſtorical truth, than the eſtimation of ancient times by modern ideas. An inſtitution, eminently uſeful at one period, may at another become moſt pernicious; and the bane of one epoch may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:0141700201:356"/>come the felicity of another. While in a barbaric country the regal power forms the chief engine of civilization and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and an ignorant ariſtocracy the grand obſtacle to theſe important ends, in a more advanced period an enlightened ariſtocracy may diffuſe multiplied rays through the national maſs, and kindle the flame of induſtry and improvement in the moſt remote corners of a wide empire: may by their preſence and example vanquiſh prejudices, irradicable by the laws or regal power, or by any democratic ſcheme, in which the people may aſſert their right to ignorance and fanaticiſm. In ſhort, whatever form of government moſt promotes domeſtic comfort, and univerſal proſperity, during any particular pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of the national progreſs, may be regarded as the moſt eligible, without attention to any univerſal theory, or predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection for particular conſtitutions. A barbarous common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth (if ſuch ever exiſted without an ariſtocracy) could only become enlightened by the conqueſt of civilized ſtates: Sparta, and Poland, loudly proclaim the diſadvantages of an ignorant ariſtocracy, deſtructive of all art, ſcience, and national ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement: that deſpotiſm is the worſt of all forms for a civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized people, the deſolated regions of the eaſt murmur with a melancholy echo.</p>
                  <p>The ſtate of Scotland continues to preſent a conſiderable degree of barbariſm during the reigns of James II and III. The laudable efforts of the firſt James, to introduce public order, were followed by fatal minorities, and confuſions; and the ariſtocratic ſtorms again ruined the welfare of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. In impreſſive language Bowar, who flouriſhed in the minority of James II, bewails the miſery of his country. "Long appears to us, O king, the time of thy arrival at majority, when thou mayeſt be able to deliver us, confounded as we are with daily tyranny, oppreſſed with rapine and ſpoil;
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:0141700201:357"/>when thou mayeſt dictate laws, and exerciſe juſtice, that the poor, who among us have no helper but God and thee, may be freed from the hand of the powerful. Mayeſt thou remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that thou art a legiſtator in order that thou mayeſt cruſh the robber, and reſtrain thoſe who deal in rapine." "The groans of the humble, and the miſeries of the poor, whom I myſelf, who write this, have ſeen this very day, in my own neighbourhood, ſtripped of their garments, and inhumanely deſpoiled of their domeſtic utenſils, conſtrain me to exclaim with him who ſays, 'I have ſeen the injuries which are done, the tears of the innocent, and no comforter; and that the deſtitute cannot reſiſt violence. I have praiſed the dead more than the living: and happier than both have I eſteemed the unborn, the ſole ſtrangers to the evils of this world.' And in another paſſage, comparing the reign of James I with his own times, "Woe to us miſerable wretches, expoſed to rapine and injury, how can we endure to live, who enjoyed ſuch proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the days of that moſt illuſtrious king, and now by a ſad change of fortune experience the complete reverſe<note n="1" place="bottom">Cont. Fordun. 473, 474, 512.</note>!"</p>
                  <p>It is remarkable that this contemporary author clearly indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates the monarch as the legiſlator, a circumſtance which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the idea formerly advanced that the king and his council prepared the laws, which afterwards received the ſanction of parliament. Nor did James II fail in the hopes which Bowar entertained; for numerous are his laws calculated for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the poor. The preceding pages preſent the more memorable ordinances, but a brief recapitulation may not be improper. The ſtrict obſervation of univerſal internal peace, with the privilege of demanding a ſurety from the turbulent; the equal adminiſtration of juſtice; the puniſhment of thoſe
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:0141700201:358"/>who aſſiſt infringers of the law: the ſecurity of leaſes, for the ſafety "of the poor people who labour the ground," whatever change lords might happen: the privilege to farmers of church lands, not to be expelled on a vacancy of the benefice: the ſevere decrees againſt deſpoliation<note n="2" place="bottom">Parl. 1450, 1469, &amp;c. the privilege to farmers of church lands occurs in a charter of 1450. Harl. 4631, Vol. I.</note>. A ſingular act merits tranſcription; "It is ſtatute and ordained, for the away-putting of ſornars, over-lyars, and maſterful beggars, with horſe, hounds, or other goods, that all officers, ſheriffs, barons, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen, baillies, as well within the burgh as without, take an inquiſition at every court which they hold concerning theſe matters: and if any ſuch perſons be found, that their horſes, hounds, or other goods, be eſcheated to the king; and their perſons ſecured till his will be known. And alſo that the ſheriffs, baillies, and officers, inquire at every court, if there be any pretended fools, bards, or other ſuch like vagabonds; and if any be found, that they be put in cuſtody, or in irons, for their treſpaſs, as long as they have wherewith to live, and when they have not, their ear to be nailed to the trone, or a tree, then cut off, and they baniſhed the country; to which if they return, they ſhall be hanged<note n="3" place="bottom">Parl. 1450, c. 21.</note>." This forcible lodging of ſome of the pretended great, and idle, upon the poor, was a notable grievance; and they are deſervedly placed with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt in the ſame ſtatute which condemns pretended fools, and highland bards. By another ſtatute theſe <hi>ſornars</hi> are puniſhed with death. The country, though long ſince de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from ſuch oppreſſive lodgers, ſtill claſſes ſturdy beggars among its grievances<note n="4" place="bottom">See the valuable Statiſtical Account of Scotland, by Sir John Sinclair, <hi>Paſſim.</hi>

                     <pb n="344" facs="tcp:0141700201:359"/>This prince alſo regulated the cuſtoms exacted at fairs, but apparently not with a ſufficient liberality to trade. James III juſtly extended the prohibition, and forbad any exaction from the poor who carried their little articles to the fairs<note n="5" place="bottom">1469, c. 34.</note>. <hi>Jean Bonhomme</hi> has, in all ages, left a great part of his fleece, either on the brambles of ariſtocratic oppreſſion, or ſhorn by the poliſhed ſcizzars of taxation, often only a circuitous mode of oligarchic avarice and extortion. The regulation of the hoſpitals for the ſickly poor, and other ſtatutes of humane im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, confer honour on the intentions of the legiſlature.</p>
                  <p>James III ordered copper coin to be iſſued, for the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the indigent; that on account of the holidays "and divine ſervice," no diſtreſs for rent ſhould take place, till three days after Whitſunday and Martinmas: that the proprietors of ferry-boats be reſtricted to certain freights: that perſons ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing to the army refrain from injuring graſs, or corn<note n="6" place="bottom">1469, c. 35. 1474, c. 62. 1481, c. 82.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Of the laws concerning the burroughs, paſſed in theſe two reigns, ſome account has already been given in the hiſtorical narrative. The municipal authority became an oligarchy in the reign of James III, on pretence "that great contention had ariſen, through the multitude and clamour of common ſimple perſons<note n="7" place="bottom">1469, c. 30.</note>:" and this form was unhappily to continue, becauſe a few are more eaſily influenced by government, than a great number. But it is ſurely the genuine intereſt of a government to ſtand upon as wide a baſis as poſſible: and for the fake of a few to render a number diſcontented, cannot be an act of political prudence.</p>
                  <p>Edinburgh is, at this period, by an Engliſh contemporary hiſtorian ſtyled a very rich town<note n="8" place="bottom">Cont. Ann. Croyland ap. Gale, Vol. I, p. 563, "ditiſſimum oppidum." The author blames Glouceſter for not ſacking it in 1482; while he took Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick, which coſt England annually 10,000 marks, "perditio non acquiſitio." The remark of this old writer on <hi>benevslences</hi> is curious: "ubi per benevolentiam quilibet daret id quod vellet, imo verius quod nollet," p. 558.

<pb n="345" facs="tcp:0141700201:360"/>Glaſgow were, in 1450, granted to the biſhop, and his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, blanch for a red roſe: and archbiſhop Beton was to date "from my city of Glaſgow<note n="9" place="bottom">Scotſt.

                  <p>A poem written in the latter part of the reign of James III, or beginning of that of James IV, preſents curious intelligence concerning the manners of the citizens<note n="1" place="bottom">The Tales of the Prieſts of Peebles, in Scarce Scotiſh Poems reprinted, London 1792, Vol. I. P. 9.</note>. A queſtion is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, Why the wealth of burgeſſes commonly expires with their immediate heirs? The reaſons aſſigned are, that their fathers begin in rigid poverty, "with good luck, and a half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penny, and a lamb's ſkin;" then proceed to the ſituation of a pedler, who, when his pack becomes worth forty Scotiſh pounds, buys a large horſe, then a cart. The next ſtage is a ſhop in town; with a counter, cheſts, and Flemiſh coffers. He becomes a merchant, and goes to ſea with exports and imports; marries a rich wiſe; his cupboard of plate is worth three thouſand pounds; his gowns and other garments are gay, ſilk on ſundays, green or grey cloth at other times; while his wife is arrayed in ſcarlet. He dies; and his heir ſucceeds to opulence unacquired by labour. The ſon is nurtured in lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury, wears rich rings, and is diſguſted to hear that his father ſold ſheep-ſkins: keeps many ſervants, ſpends his time in the tavern, or playing at <hi>hazard;</hi> till ſinking into penury, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the follower of ſome lord's ſon at court.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="346" facs="tcp:0141700201:361"/>In the ſame poem the maladminiſtration of juſtice is repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly mentioned, as a chief cauſe of the oppreſſion of the poor. The coroners, the juſtices, the ſerjands or mairs, derived their impious emoluments by extortion, on various pretexts, from the more thriving yeomen, till they reduced them to poverty, or forced them to leave their juriſdictions, when their ſucceſſors ſuffered the ſame fate. Bribes alone could ſecure an audience; an honeſt farmer would be accuſed of theft, or rapine; and the fine impoſed was meaſured by the proſperity of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry<note n="2" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 12, 24, &amp;c.</note>. The very laws intended for the protection of the poor were converted into inſtruments of their oppreſſion; while the repeated ſtatutes for the due adminiſtration of juſtice were eluded during the regal ſway, and fell aſleep during a minority. Even ſo late as Mary's reign, the balance of juſtice was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly uſed in weighing which bribe was heavieſt. It was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for England to ſet the firſt example to the world, of complete and impartial juſtice, one of the chief bleſſings of civilized ſociety: and though the expence of the law be great, that of a potent bribe might far exceed it, while equality of wealth could alone ſecure an equitable deciſion.</p>
                  <p>The Burgundian hiſtorian, in deſcribing the marriage of Mary of Gelder, mentions the manners and dreſs of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people as very rude. "There are even," ſays he, "many among them who ſeem to be altogether ſavages<note n="3" place="bottom">De Coucy, at the end of the hiſtory by Jean Chartier, Paris 1661, folio, p. 575.</note>." The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt between a poliſhed Burgundian, of the moſt ſplendid court in Europe at the time, and a Scotiſh highlander, muſt indeed have been ſtriking.</p>
                  <p>Of this barbariſm the want of education was a chief ſource; a defect which Scotland has ſince ſupplied, in a moſt laudable
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:0141700201:362"/>manner, by innumerable ſchools, where the mind may be cultivated at an expence acceſſible by the moſt indigent. It is only to be regretted that ſo little attention is paid to the ſalaries of the humble teachers; who, while their income ought not to raiſe them above their office of educating the poor, ought however to be enabled to preſerve the eaſe, and reſpect, due to ſo uſeful an order of men.</p>
                  <p>The dreſs of the common people continued a long time in the ſtate deſcribed in the former retroſpect. The ſumptuary law of James II ordained that no burghers, except bearing a municipal office, ſhall wear gowns of ſilk, or ſcarlet cloth, or decked with <hi>mertrick</hi> furs. The regulation is extended to their wives, and daughters; who are moreover to uſe no gowns with long trains, except on holidays; and to wear "ſhort kerchiefs with little hoods, as are uſed in Flanders, England, and other countries." Inferior barons, and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are alike reſtricted. None of the clergy are to wear gowns of ſcarlet, or <hi>mertrick</hi> furs, except they be dignitaries of a cathedral, or collegiate church, or doctors; or ſuch as may yearly ſpend two hundred marks, or Engliſh nobles. And with regard to the commons, "that no labourers, nor huſbandmen, wear on the work day other than grey or white; and on the holiday only light blue, green, or red: and their wives the ſame, and kerchiefs of their own making: and that it exceed not the price of forty pence the eln. And that no woman come to church, or market, with her face <hi>muſſalled,</hi> or covered, that ſhe may not be known, under the penalty of forfeiting the head dreſs<note n="4" place="bottom">1458, c. 70.</note>."</p>

                  <p>TO the information already preſented on theſe ſubjects, in the preceding retroſpect, and in the courſe of the narrative, the abundance of materials may preſent large and important additions.</p>
                  <p>The able contemporary Forteſcue, in his treatiſe on the <hi>Dominium Regale</hi> and the <hi>Dominium Politicum et Regale</hi>
                     <note n="5" place="bottom">MS. Harl. 1757, and printed at London 1714, 8vo. but his whole works deſerve republication.</note>; the former a government in which the king makes the laws, or abſolute monarchy; the ſecond when he rules by the laws made by the people, or limited monarchy; claſſes Scotland under the latter deſcription. "The king of Scots," ſays he, "reigneth over his people by this law, to wit <hi>regimine politico et regali.</hi>" He then proceeds to ſhew the miſery of France, becauſe the laws were made, and taxes impoſed, without ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning the three eſtates of the kingdom: that cowardice alone preſerved France from inſurrection, while the Engliſh being rich never aroſe, except againſt injuſtice<note n="6" place="bottom">The <hi>gens de guerre</hi> ruined the French commons. Jaligny, 409.</note>; and their liberties being ſecured by parliaments, induſtry and wealth followed. After diſcuſſing the revenue, and expences, of England, among the latter of which he mentions the borders towards Scotland, and the garriſon of Calais as exorbitant articles, he obſerves that the nobles of France were ſo powerful, that no authority dared to tax them; and that great danger would ariſe if Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land permitted ſubjects to attain ſuch preeminence. He adds
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:0141700201:364"/>that the king of Scots who laſt died, had only from apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of his rebelling expelled Douglas, "whoſe livelihood, and might, were nearly equivalent to his own." In this the venerable chief-juſtice was miſinformed, as the reader has ſeen that more than apprehenſions exiſted.</p>
                  <p>It has already been remarked that in the treaty with France 1484, it was agreed that on a failure of immediate heirs, the ſucceſſion to either crown ſhould be determined by the prelates and nobles. By an act of 1466, it was decreed that the dowry of the future queen ſhould be "a third of the king's <hi>rents of aſſize,</hi> that is to ſay of lands and cuſtoms ONLY<note n="7" place="bottom">Cap. 2.</note>." This would ſeem to imply that the dower of Mary of Gelder had extended to one third of the whole royal revenue.</p>
                  <p>A moſt important topic, the conſtitution of the Scotiſh par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, has been reſerved for this epoch, as a centrical point, upon which the various information bears. Only deſultory knowledge could have been acquired, by dividing the minute authorities into different periods; and the intereſting nature of the ſubject will excuſe ſome length in the diſcuſſion. Till the year 1587, when the repreſentation of the ſhires was fixed and aſcertained, there is hardly a variation in the model of the Scotiſh parliament: and the preſent view will of courſe anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate a century, as well as revert to the records of preceding ages. Nor till the preſent period are the collective materials ſufficiently ample, to authoriſe accurate diſquiſition; though the ſtatutes themſelves aſſume a regular form, at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of the actual reign of the firſt James.</p>
                  <p>Reſerving till another place any remarks on the two ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior ſtates of the kingdom, the clergy and barons, it ſhall here be obſerved that the burgeſſes are firſt mentioned, ſo far as our
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:0141700201:365"/>imperfect records afford poſitive evidence, in the year 1326<note n="8" place="bottom">Abercr. I, 635, from a grant of a tax in the Advocates library.

Whether they appeared before, is rather a queſtion of antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian curioſity, than of real importance; and the cauſe of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened freedom requires no ſupport from the barbaric uſages of dark ages. Suffice it to obſerve that, as all the freemen of a burgh could not appear in parliament, they ſelected perſons for that purpoſe, and inſtituted the firſt example of REPRESEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TATION, that grand ſecret of modern government, and which forms a baſis of liberty unknown to all the ancient ſtates.</p>
                  <p>The able reign of Robert the great was unhappily followed by the diſturbed minority of his ſon David II. Yet the reign of this feeble prince preſents ſome documents concerning the ſtate of parliament, which ſhall here be mentioned, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to former writers, and as preparatory to the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the national council, under his ſucceſſors of the Stuart family.</p>
                  <p>In the parliament held at Perth, on the thirteenth of January 1365, the names of the members are given, forming, it is believed, the earlieſt example of what is called <hi>the roll.</hi> The biſhops are followed by the abbots of Dunfermlin, Arbroth, Paiſley, Scone, Kilwinning, Coupar. Among the peers is John Stuart lord of Kyle. After many knights, are twelve per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons without deſignation, and a general clauſe of "the other perſons uſually called;" nor are the commiſſioners of the burghs ſpecified<note n="9" place="bottom">4to. Regiſter, f. v. 40, in the State Paper office London, when peruſed by the author ſome years ago; now, as he is informed, in a more appropriated repoſitory the Regiſter Office at Edinburgh.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The general council at Scone, 20th of July 1366, conſiſted of the biſhops, abbots, priors, free-tenants <hi>in capite,</hi> "and
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:0141700201:366"/>from each burgh certain burgeſſes ſummoned for eſpecial rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons<note n="1" place="bottom">Ibid. f. v. 44, "qui ad hoc fuerunt <hi>ex cauſa</hi> ſummoniti."</note>." In that held at the ſame place, on the 27th of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember 1367, the <hi>three communities</hi> of the kingdom being called, "certain perſons were choſen by them to hold a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, leave being given to the others, on account of the harveſt ſeaſon, to return to their homes." From the clergy were ſelected ſixteen; from the lords fourteen, at the head of whom is the Steward; and there were abſent, from contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, the earls of March, Roſs, and Douglas. The burghs are only Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Perth, Montroſe, Hadding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and Linlithgow; their ſelected delegates thirteen. The object of diſcuſſion was the royal revenue: and the king is empowered to ſend embaſſadors, and levy the expence by a tax, without recourſe to another parliament.<note n="2" place="bottom">Ibid. fol. v. 50.</note>.</p>
                  <p>In that of Perth, 6th of March 1368, a few were contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maciouſly abſent; but by the conſent of the <hi>three communities,</hi> on account of the inconvenience and ſcarcity of the ſeaſon, "certain perſons were elected to hold the parliament, leave being given to the others to return." Seven biſhops, and nine others, are choſen for the clergy; among the latter are Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Biggar rector of Errol and chamberlain of Scotland, and the <hi>procurators</hi> of the biſhops of Aberdeen and Roſs; but as it was found that fewer were ſufficient, the number was abridged. For the barons are the Steward, the earls of Mar and March, and the <hi>procurator</hi> of earl Douglas, with thirteen landed gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen; and eight others, perhaps for the burghs<note n="3" place="bottom">Ibid. fol. 52. The excuſe is in theſe words, "propter importunitatem et cariſtiam temporis."</note>.</p>
                  <p>At the parliament of Scone, 12th June 1368, appeared "the prelates, lords, and burgeſſes, who would or could be
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:0141700201:367"/>perſonally preſent; others repreſented by their <hi>commiſſaries;</hi> others being abſent from contumacy." Among other acts, it was ordained that all proceſſes of appeal be preſented to the chancellor, before the meeting of parliament; and that the parties ſhould appear in the parliament next following to hear the deciſion<note n="4" place="bottom">Ibid. f. 54. "Aliis per <hi>commiſſarios</hi> comparentibus." The term is here applied to procurators in general.</note>.</p>
                  <p>In the laſt general council recorded of David II, and held at Perth on the 18th of February 1370, the burgeſſes preſent are mentioned to have been ſpecially ſummoned for certain cauſes. Of the lords three were abſent from contumacy, Mar, John of the Iſles, and <hi>Gilleſpic Cambel</hi>
                     <note n="5" place="bottom">Ibid. f. v. 55.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The model of this noted parliament being imitated by the kings of the Stuart line, as mentioned in their ſtatutes, it is proper to lend it due illuſtration. The preamble bears that, as the chief purport of this general council was to conſider the ſtate of the realm, the royal revenue, and ſome points relating to the adminiſtration of juſtice, it was <hi>not expedient</hi> that all the members ſhould attend: for which reaſon ſome were elected, "BY THE GENERAL AND UNANIMOUS CONSENT AND ASSENT OF THE THREE COMMUNITIES ASSEMBLED, to order thoſe things that concern common juſtice, ſuch as the contradicted judgments (or appeals,) queſtions, and other complaints, which ought to be diſcuſſed and determined by parliament. And others were elected, by the SAME CONSENT AND ASSENT OF THE COMMUNITIES, to treat and deliberate on certain SPECIAL, and SECRET, affairs of the king and kingdom, before they came to the knowledge of the ſaid general council<note n="6" place="bottom">Ibid. "PER GENERALEM ET UNANIMUM CONSENSUM ET ASSENSUM TRIUM COMMUNITATUM CONGREGATARUM, ad ea quae concernunt commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem juſticiam, videlicet judicia contradicta, queſtiones, et querelas alias, quae per parlamentum debuerant terminari, diſcutiendas et determinandas.

                     </note>."</p>

                     <pb n="353" facs="tcp:0141700201:368"/>For the matters concerning the adminiſtration of juſtice were choſen ſix of the clergy; ten knights, and four others, for the barons; and ſeven burgeſſes.</p>
                  <p>For the ſecret affairs three clergy; and ten others, among whom the Steward, and the earls of Carrick and March are firſt named, and the laſt is Duncan Wallace, "one of the <hi>attorneys</hi> of the earl of Douglas." It is ſpecially added that the king may name any others.</p>
                  <p>This, as far as appears, was the very firſt inſtitution of the famous LORDS OF THE ARTICLES, originally only a committee for ſecret affairs, ſelected by the voice of the whole legiſlative body. But the power aſſigned to the king, of adding any members he thought proper, led to great abuſes.</p>
                  <p>After the acceſſion of the houſe of Stuart the earlieſt memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable parliament is that of Scone, 2d March 1372, in the firſt year of Robert II. The burgeſſes preſent continued to be ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſummoned, <hi>ex cauſa,</hi> for a certain cauſe. And as the general council is held for purpoſes relating to the king and realm, and the adminiſtration of common juſtice, "in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the order and method which were obſerved in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament held at Perth, in the time of king David of venerable memory, and of his reign the fortieth year," [18 Feb. 1370,] ſome were choſen BY THE GENERAL AND UNANIMOUS CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SENT AND ASSENT OF THE THREE COMMUNITIES, for matters concerning common juſtice. And others, "BY THE CONSENT
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:0141700201:369"/>AND ASSENT OF THE SAID COMMUNITIES, to treat and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate on certain SPECIAL affairs of the king and kingdom, before they come to the knowledge of the general council." The other members were diſmiſſed. For the names of thoſe choſen we are referred to another regiſter. It is remarkable that in this parliament the plea of ſecrecy is omitted; and the lords of the articles are only choſen for SPECIAL affairs.<note n="7" place="bottom">Ibid. f. v. 58. "Imitando videlicet ordinem illum et modum, qui ſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batur in parlamento tento apud Perth, tempore venerandae memoriae domim Regis David, anno regni ipſius quadrageſimo." .... "Et alii, PER CONSEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUM ET ASSENSUM EARUNDEM COMMUNITATUM, electi ad tractandum et deliberandum ſuper certis SPECIALIBUS Regis et Regni negotiis, antequam perveniant ad notitiam concilii generalis."
<p>The ſtatutes of David II are inaccurately copied in a bad hand; but the writing of thoſe of Robert II is greatly improved; whence this paſſage ſerves to illuſtrate the genuine reading of the former.</p>

                  <p>The parliament of Robert III, in February 1401, only bears that there were preſent the biſhops, [abbots,] priors, dukes, earls, barons, "freeholders, and burgeſſes who hold of our lord the king <hi>in capite</hi>
                     <note n="8" place="bottom">Apud Skene Reg. Maj.</note>." But that the inſtitution of the lords of the articles continued an inveterate uſage, appears from the parliament of Perth, 26th May 1424, the firſt of James I<note n="9" place="bottom">Acts edit. 1566, fol. 1. "electae fuerunt certae perfonae ad articulos datos per dominum Regem determinandos, data caeteris licentia recedendi." Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were only to treat and deliberate; now to <hi>determine.</hi>
                     </note>; and the firſt, it is believed, in which the ſtyle of the ARTICLES appears; and from numerous ſucceeding par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments. It is alſo certain that the uſage of diſmiſſing the other members, after the committees of juſtice and of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles had been ſelected, was continued to the parliament of 1424, if not long after: ſo that the prolongation of the ſeſſion, after the appointment of theſe committees, was a mere ſtretch
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:0141700201:370"/>of the prerogative, as well as the latter corrupt mode of chuſing the lords of the articles. At what preciſe epoch the committee of juſtice was divided into two, 1 <hi>ad judicia,</hi> or of judgments in criminal caſes, and 2. <hi>ad cauſas,</hi> or of civil cauſes and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits in the laſt appeal, does not appear: but ſuch was the method in the reign of James III<note n="1" place="bottom">Records of Parliament, Regiſter Office, <hi>paſſim.</hi>
                     </note>. Yet even at this period the lords of the articles were modeſtly named laſt, after the two former committees had been appointed; not firſt, as was afterwards the uſage, when the lords of the articles were named by the influence of the court, whoſe demands uſurped a preference over the adminiſtration of juſtice.</p>
                  <p>The ſteps that led to this radical alteration of the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Scotiſh parliament, which was at firſt to preclude the power of debate, by only requiring the ſanction of a full parliament to decrees already adjuſted; and was afterwards to make that aſſembly a mere inſtrument of the crown; deſerve particular inveſtigation. The chief cauſe was the indolence and avarice of the members, who regarded their attendance in parliament, to which they were not only bound by their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures, but under a ſine of ten pounds for abſence, as a moſt heavy conſtraint and intolerable burden. Even in England at this period committees were frequently appointed and leave given to the other members to depart<note n="2" place="bottom">See Rolls of Parliament. Edward III, in 1340, ordered that in every parliament a prelate, two earls, and two barons, ſhould ſit to judge appeals, 14 E. 3 cap. 5. Barrington on the Statutes, p. 244. And ſee Wight, 98.</note>. The ſole diſtinction was, that in Scotland the cuſtom by a political ſoleciſm re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, while the parliament itſelf continued in full ſeſſion. This apparently ſlight difference, and the equally ſlight cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, that in England the members were too numerous to meet in one room, decided the deſtinies of the two king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:0141700201:371"/>England had a free parliament for diſcuſſion, and a houſe of commons: Scotland an influenced parliament for aſſent, and her commons were overpowered by the preſence of the ſuperior orders.</p>
                  <p>From the advantage which was afterwards taken of this inſtitution of lords of the articles, it would ſeem a device of ſome cunning Auguſtus, to ſap the freedom of his country. It was, on the contrary, the mere product of chance and weakneſs. The appointment of committees, and diſmiſſion of the other members, in September 1367 and March 1368, the firſt on account of the harveſt, the ſecond an unexpectedly ſevere ſeaſon and ſcarcity, evince the progreſs of chance: and the character of David II, and his hatred, at the time, to the Stuarts, who were to be the heirs of his power, ſhew the want of deſign. The unanimous conſent and aſſent, of the whole three eſtates aſſembled, teſtifies that they exulted in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from the ſlavery of attending in parliament, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded the eighteenth day of February, thirteen hundred and ſeventy, as a jubilee of freedom!</p>
                  <p>The ſubſequent ſtatutes, which illuſtrate the conſtitution of parliament, are far from numerous. The moſt memorable is the next in chronological order, that of James I, in March 1428<note n="3" place="bottom">Acts, f. v. 17.</note>.</p>
                  <p>"The king, with conſent of the whole general council, has ordained that the ſmall barons, and free-tenants, need not come to the parliament, or general council, provided that each ſheriffdom ſend two, or more, wiſe men, choſen at the head court of the ſheriffdom, according to its extent, except the ſheriffdoms of Clackmanan and Kinroſs, which may only ſend one member for each.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="357" facs="tcp:0141700201:372"/>"Theſe members ſhall be called Commiſſaries of the ſhire: and, by theſe Commiſſaries of all the ſhires ſhall be choſen a wiſe man; and expert, called the Common Speaker of the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who ſhall propoſe all and ſundry neceſſities and cauſes, pertaining to the Commons, in the parliament or general council<note n="4" place="bottom">The <hi>Common Speaker</hi> is a mere abbreviated phraſe for the <hi>Commons' Speaker,</hi> or Speaker of the Commons. It could never be intended that a commiſſioner of the ſhire ſhould ſupplant the chancellor, and become <hi>general</hi> ſpeaker of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</note>.</p>
                  <p>"The Commiſſaries ſhall have full and entire power from the reſt of the ſheriffdom, teſtified by the ſeal of the ſheriff, and thoſe of ſeveral barons of the ſhire, to hear, treat, and finally to determine, all cauſes to be propoſed in the council or parliament.</p>
                  <p>"Which Commiſſaries, and Speaker, ſhall have their expence defrayed by thoſe of each ſhire who owe appearance in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament or council, an equal aſſeſſment being laid on every pound of rent, except thoſe of biſhops, abbots, priors, dukes, earls, lords of parliament, and <hi>banrents,</hi> whom the king di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects to be ſummoned and admitted to parliament by his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial precept."</p>
                  <p>Such is this remarkable ſtatute, the intentions of which are ſuppoſed never to have been fulfilled till 1587; when it was revived and enforced, and the firſt regular repreſentation for counties commenced in Scotland. It is evident that this great monarch wiſhed to eſtabliſh a Houſe of Commons, on the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh model, and to lay the foundations of genuine liberty, by dividing the landed gentlemen from the peers, and thus ſtrengthening the third eſtate, which only conſiſted of a few burgeſſes, unable to contend againſt the whole landed intereſt united, a French <hi>nobleſſe,</hi> inſtead of a diſtinct order of noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:0141700201:373"/>like thoſe of England. But when this act was revived in 1587<note n="5" place="bottom">Cap. 113.</note>, the clauſe concerning the Common Speaker, or Speaker of the Commons, was carefully omitted: and thus the chief intention was eluded, and the commiſſaries of the ſhires, and burghs, continued to ſit in the ſame houſe with the peers.</p>
                  <p>It has already been obſerved in the hiſtorical narrative that, in 1458, it was enacted that no freeholder ſhall be conſtrained to attend as a member of parliament, if he hold of the king "under the ſum of twenty pounds" in land. In 1504 the exemption is, under "one hundred marks of the extent that now is;" and an extent implies annual value. Twenty pounds in 1458, Scotiſh money being to the Engliſh as one to three, and its power being to the preſent as ten to one, may nearly equal ſeventy pounds ſterling of modern currency. In 1504 the coin was as one to four, and one hundred marks might equal one hundred and ſixty of our pounds. The Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh parliament had enacted, in 1429, that none ſhould <hi>vote</hi> for knight of the ſhire, who had not freeholds of the value of forty ſhillings: but in Scotland it was eſteemed a great privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege to be exempted from ſitting in parliament; and voting could not be enforced even by the united efforts of the monarch and legiſlative body.</p>
                  <p>From 1504 till 1587 there are no ſtatutes concerning the conſtitution of parliament.</p>
                  <p>To return to the conſideration of the period under review, we have ſeen that in 1469, an oligarchic plan of appointing the council, and magiſtrates of burghs, was inſtituted, and the parliament was compared with common courts of juſtice: and in 1482 the mention of the parliament of Paris indicates that the French idea of a parliament was, by the court, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:0141700201:374"/>to the Engliſh. The numerous clergy preſent at a Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh parliament, and the want of an oppoſition, are features delineated and explained in the preceding retroſpect.</p>
                  <p>In 1488, as has already been obſerved, the titled nobles of Scotland amounted to about forty. The ducal denominations were moſtly confined to the royal family: the others were earls and lords. But theſe greater barons had no privileges above the ſmaller: all were <hi>peers,</hi> or <hi>pares,</hi> in courts of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice: a <hi>lord</hi> and a <hi>lard</hi> are the ſame, and the latin only admitted <hi>dominus</hi> for either: the <hi>lard,</hi> or <hi>laird,</hi> was deſigned from his eſtate; and his wife was <hi>lady</hi> by the ſame deſignation even down to modern times. For diſtinction the titled lords were created and ſtyled lords of parliament. While there was no houſe of commons, there was no houſe of peers: every landed gentleman holding of the crown might ſit and vote; but he could not be conſtrained to attend except his eſtate amounted to a certain ſum.</p>
                  <p>Had the great plan of James I been carried into execution, as much additional reſpect would have accrued to the peers, as to the commons: greater luſtre, more important privileges, would have ariſen to the former, as well as to the latter. A diſtinct legiſlative capacity, a marked line of ſeparation from the landed gentlemen, might have gratified the pride, and ſtimulated the abilities, of the peers; while the eſquires, united with the burgeſſes, might have learned by degrees the eminent advantages which commerce and agriculture derive from each other.</p>
                  <p>The leſſer barons or <hi>lairds,</hi> correſponding with the Engliſh LORDS of manors, form ſuch a ſingular and amphibious claſs, in the Scotiſh parliament, that they excite curioſity and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition. The roll of parliament, 1472, will give us an idea
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:0141700201:375"/>of their proportion to the other members; which ſeems to have greatly exceeded that of the roll of 1365 above-mentioned.</p>

                  <p>An idle tradition prevailed in the middle ages, that one of our monarchs diſtributed all the lands of Scotland among his great barons, reſerving none for himſelf, except the Moot-hill of Scone. This tradition, though vague, expreſſed the ſtate of the country, chiefly divided into large territories, the poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of which held of the king; while their numerous vaſſals, enjoying greater or ſmaller allotments, held of their lords. Hence the numerous charters <hi>of confirmation</hi> in our records, only lending the royal ſanction to charters granted by the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons: and a liſt of the tenants <hi>in capite,</hi> including even the ſmaller, would not, it is believed, for the writers who might be expected to illuſtrate this topic, prefer declamation on the feudal ſyſtem; a rich mine, but already exhauſted by the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of Monteſquieu, and other able authors<note n="7" place="bottom">The learned Craig ought to be named among the chief, his work <hi>De Feud's</hi> being the exuberant, and often the <hi>ſilent,</hi> ſource of the riches of more modern authors. The reader who wiſhes to ſtudy this important topic, ſo long the deſtiny of Europe, may begin with that great work; if the prefer not to aſcend to the original anothors, Gerardus Niger or Capagiſtus, and Obertus de <hi>Orto,</hi> two Milaneſe of conſideration, who about the year 1170 compoſed the books <hi>De Uſibus Feudorum,</hi> the early ſtandard of feudal law.

                  <p>In England the <hi>baron</hi> was a <hi>lord,</hi> a peer: in Scotland he was only a <hi>laird,</hi> a man of landed property: the word indeed originally only implies a man of courage, a chief<note n="8" place="bottom">Leges Langob. and in modern Spaniſh <hi>Varon</hi> is either A MAN or a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; not to mention the French <hi>baron et femme.</hi> In like manner the term <hi>Iarl,</hi> or Earl, apparently introduced by the Daniſh conqueſt of England in the eleventh century, only ſignified originally a <hi>man;</hi> thus <hi>Iarl—wagh,</hi> via viri. Sticrnhook de June Sneonum, p. 297. It correſponds with the German <hi>carl,</hi> a ſtrong, man</note>. From Domeſday Book it appears that the immediate vaſſals of the crown amounted, after the conqueſt, to about ſeven hundred, excluſive of the ecceſiaſtic fees<note n="9" place="bottom">Dalr. on feudal property, 313.</note>: of theſe ſeven hundred a few were earls and lords; the remainder would in Scotland have been termed barons or lairds. In the latter kingdom it may ſeem that the immediate vaſſals of the crown could not, before the reign of David I, exceed two hundred; and the profuſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of that prince to the church muſt have diminiſhed the number of lay-fees.</p>
                  <p>Theſe vaſſals of the crown, or tenants <hi>in capite,</hi> were how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſpeedily to be multiplied by various cauſes. New dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the regal demeſne, forfeitures of great fiefs, afterwards divided into ſmaller, gifts of land by vaſſals themſelves to their followers, coheirſhip, and at length purchaſe by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions of commerce or chance, were among the operations which increaſed the number of the vaſſals in chief. Hence in the reign of Henry III of England, repreſentatives appear for the counties at the ſame time with thoſe of the burghs: and ſo rapid was the progreſs of liberty in that fortunate kingdom that, from the firſt appearance of repreſentation for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:0141700201:379"/>all and had a right to vote who held lands, or tenements, of whatever lord or ſuperior; while in Scotland, when this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation was attempted in 1428 and eſtabliſhed in 1587, the privilege, or ſervitude, of voting was confined to the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders of the crown.</p>
                  <p>One great cauſe which defeated the repreſentation for coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in Scotland, and rendered even that for the burghs irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and incomplete, was the avarice of the freeholders, and citizens, which ſhrunk from paying the <hi>coſtage,</hi> or ſalaries of the repreſentatives. And they not only abhorred the duty, or bondage as they ſuppoſed, of ſitting in parliament, but they even deteſted the trouble of giving their votes. Another cauſe was, that the members of parliament had no privileges what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, not even the peers themſelves conſidered in that capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; while the political wiſdom of England had ſtimulated emulation, and had inſpired reſpect for the meaneſt member of the national council, by the freedom from arreſt, and other immunities. Had James I, in his eager wiſh to render the nation free, induſtrious, and happy, aſſigned ſpecial privileges to the repreſentatives of counties and burghs, it is probable he might have ſucceeded in eſtabliſhing two houſes, and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent conſtitution. The ſtruggle is ſingular; the court in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on diffuſing ſome degree of freedom; and the people oppoſed their deliverance with ſurprizing zeal and perſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
                  <p>To return to the conſideration of the <hi>barons</hi> or <hi>lairds,</hi> they were hardly to be diſtinguiſhed, either in common or legal language, from the titled nobility. They were not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated from their eſtates; but to a late period they uſed a titular ſignature, as well as the peers. <hi>Peer,</hi> and <hi>peerage,</hi> do not indeed appear to be Scotiſh terms: in England, when a lord of parliament was created, he was ſtyled a PEER, but
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:0141700201:380"/>there ſeems no veſtige of this uſage in Scotland; and there being no houſe of peers or equals, to which he could be called, the nobles were peers of the realm, and not peers of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The term peerage is indeed vague, even at preſent; an Engliſh peerage is an inelective hereditary right to ſit in parliament; while a Scotiſh peerage is only a right to vote for ſixteen repreſentatives<note n="1" place="bottom">The reader who is deſirous to ſee a clear ſubject embarraſſed by a ſtrange mixture of new names and old ideas, and old names and new ideas, joined with a ſimilar confuſion of chronology, may conſult Wallace on ancient Peer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, Edin. 1785, 8vo.</note>. In ſtrict propriety the word has no connection with the parliament or general council; it is an honour at firſt territorial, and paſſing with the land like a Scotiſh <hi>lairdſhip;</hi> afterwards perſonal and hereditary; but ever implying power, territory, rank, precedence, inveſtiture by the monarch, diſtinction of ſeat and dreſs on ſolemn occaſions. In France the twelve peers ſeem ot have ſucceeded the <hi>comites,</hi> or companion of the early monarchs, after the latter title had dwindled into the <hi>count</hi> or earl; and acknowledging no ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior but the ſovereign, they bore the humble and proud title of peers or equals. The Normans introduced the term into England; where it was to be extended to all who were ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly ennobled by the king, and thereby attained a right of ſitting in the upper houſe, only known in that country, and thence ſtyled the Houſe of Peers. But in Scotland the peers having at no period a ſeparate houſe, and after the extinction of the Scotiſh parliament by the Union, having only a right to ſelect ſixteen of their number; the title remains in its original ſtate, quite diſtinct from any reference to parliament.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Banrents,</hi> or Bannerets, were an intermediate order, between the peers and the <hi>larids;</hi> poſſeſſing eſtates of ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and of ſo many knights fees, that they could lead a great
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:0141700201:381"/>number of followers to the field, whence they had a title to diſplay a <hi>banner</hi>
                     <note n="2" place="bottom">The <hi>ſtandard</hi> was confined to the king or general; the banner to peers and potent chiefs: the <hi>guidon</hi> was a ſmall flag with two peaks or points, and ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to the <hi>pencill</hi> or penon which every knight might put on his lance. See Groſe hiſt. of Engl. army 11, 258.</note>. They were alſo diſtinguiſhed by their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar <hi>enſeigny,</hi> or <hi>cri de guerre;</hi> and by ſupporters to their armorial bearings.</p>
                  <p>But the Scotiſh <hi>barons,</hi> or <hi>lairds,</hi> had none of theſe high diſtinctions. However ſmall their freeholds, they had a title to ſit in parliament, as appears from the above acts, exempting thoſe under a certain revenue from any conſtraint for appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. In civil matters they could decide queſtions of debt, and many of poſſeſſion within their baronies; regulate work and wages; and enforce the payment of their rents. All criminal caſes fell under the cogniſance of the <hi>laird,</hi> except treaſon, and the four pleas of the crown: he had the power of pit and gallows, or drowning female and hanging male cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prits, convicted of theft or robbery; and his juriſdiction com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized many penal ſtatutes<note n="3" place="bottom">Erſkine Principles of Sc. Law, b. I, t. 4, § 14</note>.</p>
                  <p>On the other hand numerous were the diſtinctions between the lord and the <hi>laird.</hi> The latter had no permanent denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, no perſonal honour, his exiſtence was merely territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial: he had no ſolemn inveſtiture, no fixed rank, no prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, nor was he addreſſed with any appropriated term. His tenants indeed called him <hi>Maſter,</hi> not landlord, but this was a ſlaviſh relique of the days of villenage: and hence apparently the Scotiſh phraſe of <hi>Maſter,</hi> for the heir apparent to an eſtate, thus Maſter of Huntley, of Darnley, and the like, frequent in our hiſtory and records, and ſtill retained where there is no ſecond title.</p>

                     <pb n="367" facs="tcp:0141700201:382"/>The ſame cauſes which operated in England were, by ſlower degrees, to increaſe the number of the Scotiſh tenants <hi>in capite.</hi> Money being ſcarce, gifts and rewards were commonly aſſigned in lands; and even a meſſenger of good tidings was recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed by a ſmall eſtate<note n="4" place="bottom">Scotſt.

An inborn preference which moſt men give to land above all other kinds of property, the deſire of retirement eaſe and a rural life, ſo natural to the buſy citizen, conſpired to render the purchaſe of land a great object of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition to the induſtrious merchant, and to the fortunate adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer. Entails were unknown in Scotland, till the ſeventeenth century; a deed of <hi>taillie</hi> merely regulating the manner of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, and commonly altering it from heirs general to heirs male<note n="6" place="bottom">Dalr. on feudal property, 162, 163, where it is alſo ſhewn that Craig, who wrote about the year 1600, knew nothing of entails in the modern ſenſe.

"Certaine Matters," &amp;c. 1594.</note>: but other obſtacles prevented the free acquiſition of
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:0141700201:383"/>land, ſo eſſential to the circulation of the blood of the ſtate. An able judge even ſuppoſes that the <hi>jus retracius</hi> prevailed, by which a right of redemption expoſed the purchaſer to an uncertainty in his property, a bar at once to its enjoyment and improvement. While the famous ſtatute of <hi>Quia Emptores</hi> was to diffuſe wealth and cultivation through England; in the adjacent kingdom the heritable proprietor was to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by the heritable ſterility of his poſſeſſions, and by a firm entail of indolence and poverty. Yet by degrees com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and induſtry were to aſſert their rights, private vices were to become public benefits; and landed prodigality was to miniſter to the national advancement. And though many of the purchaſed lands held of the under lords, there is little room to doubt that the freeholders of the crown were increaſed by this progreſs of ſociety: but a juſt eſtimate of their number could only be formed from an enumeration of the charters in the regiſter at various periods, a toil perhaps ſurpaſſing the value of the information.</p>
                  <p>That no repreſentatives for the counties appeared till 1587, is ſufficiently clear from the ſilence of the ſtatutes, and records: and the act of James II, concerning the parliamentary dreſs, is mute concerning the commiſſioners of the ſhires, or even the leſſer barons in general, though moſt particular in regard to the earls, lords, and burgeſſes. It is hence to be inferred that the <hi>lairds</hi> appeared in parliament in their uſual dreſs; nor does it appear that, in latter times, the repreſentatives of ſhires were diſtinguiſhable by their apparel from the burgeſſes.</p>
                  <p>To cloſe this diſcuſſion concerning the <hi>leſſer barons,</hi> the length of which can only be excuſed by their importance in the national and conſtitutional ſcale, and the ſingularity of
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:0141700201:384"/>their rank in ſociety, when compared with more civilized go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, it ſhall only be further obſerved, that the term <hi>laird</hi> has become of no reſpect, and is even ironically applied to the <hi>portioner</hi> of land, whoſe eſtate is half a field, but who joins the induſtry of an artiſan to the healthy purſuits of his little agriculture. For the denomination, being territorial, is only honourable in proportion to the territory; while the Engliſh term Eſquire, aſſigned to any man who bears a ſhield, or in other words has an armorial blazon, is a perſonal diſtinction, extended to opulence, to eminence of talents, to fortunate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, as well as to conſiderable poſſeſſions of land.</p>
                  <p>In paſſing to the laſt diviſion of the national council, the Burgeſſes, it is firſt to be obſerved that the Royal Burghs alone had a right, or rather, to ſpeak in the language of the times, were burdened by their tenures from the crown with the heavy duty of ſending repreſentatives to parliament. The Burghs of Barony, or thoſe that held of great barons whether temporal or ſpiritual, were exempt from this ſlavery: Glaſgow for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance though a burgh of ſome conſequence, even then, as holding of the biſhop, ſent no commiſſioner. To thoſe already mentioned, in the above roll, may be added Berwick, Jedburgh, Selkirk, Peebles, Lanark, Dunbar, Kinghorn, Forfar, Brechin, Wigton, Kirkudbright, Irvin, Dunbarton, North Berwick, In-verkeithing, Coupar, Perth, Montroſe, and others<note n="7" place="bottom">See Carm. 59, part. 1479. In 1682 they amounted to ſixty. Preſent Skate of Scotland, London 1682, 8vo, p. 131—134.</note>; ſo that the repreſentatives for the burghs might have amounted to between thirty and forty, if another ſingular practice had not prevailed, that of many of the burghs appointing the repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives of the others to be proxies; every method of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from attendance being ſedulouſly practiſed, in order to avoid the trouble and expence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="370" facs="tcp:0141700201:385"/>As the ſeſſion of a parliament commonly laſted only a few days, the chief magiſtrates of the burghs could attend, without a long abſence from their duty; and it appears that they were generally the repreſentatives. The oligarchic form of muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality, introduced by James III, neceſſarily confined the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the town-council, the body of the burgeſſes or freemen being excluded. Hence it is computed that there are not in Scotland, at this day, above three thouſand voters for national repreſentatives, either of counties or towns<note n="8" place="bottom">Dalr. 330.</note>.</p>
                  <p>In the earlieſt Scotiſh parliaments, of which we have any record, it appears that deputies for the burghs attended, to ſettle the proportion of taxes, which the towns were to bear: and it is not improbable that the magiſtrates of the principal burghs may be included in the <hi>ſapientes, probi homines,</hi> or <hi>preud-hommes,</hi> and <hi>tota communitas regni,</hi> of the moſt ancient national councils<note n="9" place="bottom">For thoſe of Scotland ſee the Statuta Willielmi, et Alexandri Secundi, apud Skene Reg. Maj.</note>. Many ancient Engliſh cuſtoms may be traced in more modern Scotiſh uſages; and for this reaſon the ſtudy of the latter is important to ſcience in both kingdoms. That the magiſtrates of the chief towns were, in an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated ſenſe, members of the national council before the reign of Henry III in England, and Robert I in Scotland, there is unhappily no poſitive proof: but that they attended, eſpecially in caſes of taxation, and probably at the bar, there is ſome proof, and every reaſon to infer. In Scotland there were neither towns nor commerce, till a comparatively late period; but the uſages are evidently of Engliſh origin, conſtant inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and an amity ſeldom interrupted, having prevailed between the nations, till the baſe and unkingly conduct of Edward I forced Scotland into the arms of France. Now in
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:0141700201:386"/>England, as in other European kingdoms, no repreſentatives from towns could appear in early times; and the numerous barbaric codes of laws, though moſt minute in other points, are, it is believed, completely ſilent, not only on this head, but on municipal regulation. The reaſon is clear; it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the barbarians who overturned the Roman empire de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted the civic life; and preſerved their ancient rural manners, and occupations. The towns being conquered, had no right to expect a repreſentation in the national aſſemblies of their victors, held in ample plains under the canopy of heaven; and it was to the contempt and indifference of the conquerors, that they were commonly indebted for ſuch privileges as they retained, as the right of electing their own magiſtrates, and other minute reliques of freedom. When the Saxons, when the Normans conquered England, the ſame cauſes muſt have operated; the Engliſh repreſentatives of London muſt have made a ſtrange appearance in an aſſembly of Norman free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, to whoſe language and laws they were abſolute ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. But the magiſtrates might be called to the bar, to adviſe and give their conſent to the beſt manner of proportioning a tax, and enforcing its collection in their reſpective towns, the language of money being very audible and clear.</p>

Even in the reign of James II, as will afterwards appear in this retroſpect, they ſat at the bar of the national council: in that of James III ſeveral acts bear to be paſſed by the clergy and lords: in 1504 a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ſtatute appears, ordaining "that the commiſſaries and heads-men of the burghs be warned when taxes or contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:0141700201:387"/>are given, to have their advice therein, as one of the three eſtates of the realm<note n="2" place="bottom">Cap. 85.</note>." In 1560 we find ten <hi>provoſts</hi> of the chief towns among the lords of the articles<note n="3" place="bottom">Robertſon Append. N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> IV.</note>. As the ſtatutes are ſilent concerning the mode of election, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, for burghs, it would ſeem that one or two of the magiſtrates were nominated by the others, or by the council.</p>
                  <p>The Royal Burghs were indeed bound by their tenures, as holding in chief of the crown, to attend the parliament; but as proxies were allowed, and the fine itſelf for abſence was only ten pounds, the tenure was neglected and illuded. Nor could the incorporation of a burgh by royal charter be an uſage of much antiquity in Scotland, perhaps not more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient than the reign of David I.</p>
                  <p>So much for the Burgeſſes, the only real commons of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; the leſſer barons having weakly preferred an inſignificant mixture with the peers to the noble ambition of heading a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate aſſembly. Modern party has embroiled many of the queſtions on this ſubject; a whig wiſhing to increaſe the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and power of the commons, while a tory endeavours to diminiſh them: but to plain ſenſe, and cool reaſon, the topic is only important as illuſtrative of hiſtory; nor can the diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of barbaric cuſtoms hinder, or advance, the cauſe of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened freedom.</p>
                  <p>Having thus conſidered the ſeveral claſſes of men, which compoſed the three eſtates of the national council, one of the moſt intereſting objects in modern hiſtory; ſome other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars remain to be ſtated, in order to preſent clear informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion concerning its conſtitution, and procedure.</p>
                  <p>The number of the members, we have ſeen, amounted to about one hundred and ninety; but from the rolls there never
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:0141700201:388"/>appears more than half the number; the others being abſent from ſickneſs, diſtance, feuds, nonage, eſpecial affairs, or other reaſonable cauſes; and ſome from contumacy, or an oppoſition to the meaſures of the court at the time. Even in modern times to ſecure the attendance of a certain number, in a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional council, the members ought to double that number. James I ordered, in 1426, that no prelate, earl, baron, or free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder, ſhould appear by a procurator, except on proving a lawful cauſe of abſence<note n="4" place="bottom">Cap. 52. The act of 1504 allows procurators to appear for the leſſer Barons. Mr. Wight, p. 57, ſeems rightly to infer that both the ſtatutes, of 1458, and 1504, only abſolve the perſons from attendance, on condition that they ſent proxies.</note>. It would ſeem that the procurators are omitted in the rolls, and often indeed one member might appear for many; but ſometimes a lawyer was proxy for an abſent peer; and the omiſſion might be according to the forms, or intended to diſcountenance the practice. At any rate the omiſſion of the procurators muſt conſiderably abbreviate the rolls of parliament.</p>
                  <p>It was a royal prerogative to ſummon the general council, which was done by letters, under the ſignet, to the clerical members, and greater barons; and by precepts from chancery to the ſheriffs, for general ſummonſes to all members reſident in each ſhire. During a minority this prerogative was exerted by the council of regency; but few or no permanent laws were ever paſſed, except when the ſovereign had attained the years of majority preſcribed by law.</p>
                  <p>The members having, a day or two before, arrived in the city or town where the parliament was to be held, on the morning of the meeting they aſſembled at an appointed place, and proceeded on horſeback in grant ſtate to their hall. This proceſſion was called the Riding of the Parliament, and was
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:0141700201:389"/>a ſingularity retained to the lateſt period of the Scotiſh legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Amid the ſound of numerous trumpets, and the armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial diſplays of heralds, firſt appeared the commiſſioners of the burghs, then the leſſer barons; followed by the lords, the biſhops, the earls, the archbiſhops, the dukes. Three choſen peers bore the crown, ſceptre, and ſword, before the monarch, who was attended by his guards. At the door of the hall ſat the lord high conſtable, to receive the members as they alighted, and probably in his original office of giving orders concerning the ſtabling of their horſes till their return<note n="5" place="bottom">See the prints of the Riding of the Scotiſh parliament in the reign of Charles II.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The clergy probably took their ſeats on the right, the peers on the left of the throne, as in England: and ſo numerous were the former, that the leſſer barons preſent would merely complete the left ranks. At the bottom, near, or perhaps without, the bar, ſat the commiſſioners of the burghs. The clerk of the regiſter was apparently the clerk of parliament: and it is to be inferred that he, and ſome other officers of ſtate, ſat in the middle before the throne<note n="6" place="bottom">The author of the Preſent State of Scotland, 1682, ſays the Chancellor, and other officers of ſtate, ſat under the throne; and below them the Lords of Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or judges: in the middle were two tables, one bearing the <hi>regalia</hi> by which ſat the Conſtable and Marſhall; at the other was the clerk of regiſter, with his deputy clerks who are the clerks of parliament. P. 84, 85.
<p>In Cal. B. V, 266, is an account of the Scotiſh parliament in the reign of James VI. At that time the members continued in town while the lords of the articles ſat, being a week or two, and all met on the laſt day to approve or condemn. Parliament was either <hi>deſerted</hi> or <hi>current;</hi> the former caſe required a proclamation of forty days before another could be held; the latter only of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days.</p>
                     </note>.</p>
                  <p>The roll being called, and ſome other formalities arranged, the chancellor, or ſometimes the ſecretary, made a ſhort ſpeech; and as they were commonly churchmen, it was in the nature
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:0141700201:390"/>of a ſermon of the time, ſeaſoned with latin quotations from ſcripture. The three eſtates then proceeded to their chief of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, the appointment of commitees of juſtice, and of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles; who being ſelected, the other members were at liberty to depart to their reſpective homes: and often did not aſſemble till next year, when they gave their ſanction to the laws pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by the committees. But it alſo often happened that the ſtatutes and ordinances were already faſhioned by the chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, and other officers of ſtate, or could eaſily be forwarded; ſo that the members remained in the town, and even continued their ſeſſion occaſionally from five to fifteen days, the laſt of which was appropriated to the pronunciation of the deciſions of the committee of juſtice, in preſence of the whole houſe<note n="7" place="bottom">The vote of <hi>Non liquet</hi> was latterly allowed, as in the Roman ſenate; but the uſual votes were <hi>approve</hi> or <hi>not approve;</hi> (Preſ. State 87, 88,) an expreſſion rather belonging to ſanction than debate.</note>.</p>
                  <p>As the members were inelective, the commiſſioners of the burghs alone excepted, the prorogation, or diſſolution, of the parliament could not be alternatives of great conſequence. In England, at this period, a parliament ſeldom ſat above one ſeſſion of twenty or thirty days; but ſometimes three ſeſſions were known. The general form of the Scotiſh parliament ſeems to have been annual; and the magiſtrates, who repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the towns, being commonly of yearly continuance in office, it may be difficult to point out an inſtance of a proro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation from one year to another: though thoſe of two or three months in the ſame year are not unfrequent. A curious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the prorogation of a parliament, followed by its diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, occurs in the records. In the turbulent laſt year of the reign of James III, a parliament met in January, and was prorogued to May. But on the 17th February 1488, James iſſued the following order. "We do you to wit that our ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:0141700201:391"/>lord, by the advice of his council, has for certain rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and great cauſes, deſerted and diſſolved his parliament, which was formerly prorogued till the fifth day of May next to come: and has ordained a new general parliament, to be ſet, and proclaimed to be holden at Edinburgh the twelfth day of May next to come, with continuation of days; and general precepts to paſs to all lords, prelates, barons, frecholders, and commiſſaries; and with ſpecial letters under his ſignet to all the prelates, and great lords of his realm, to ſhew and declare to them the cauſe of the ſitting of his ſaid parliament." Theſe ſpecial letters it is to be preſumed, James did not direct to his enemies: and it is even probable that they were never ſent to members in the oppoſition; an omiſſion which might be regarded as a hint that their abſence would be more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                  <p>After the parliament, the Privy Council attracts the greateſt attention by its dignity and importance. The nature of this meeting has been already explained in the preceding retroſpect, where it is obſerved that it ſucceeded the <hi>Aula Regis,</hi> or King's Court. This court, anciently held in a hall of the palace, has been by ſome authors confounded with the nationa coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; and the vague ſynonymes, and impure latinity, of the writers of the middle ages, have ſometimes blended the terms <hi>curia</hi> and <hi>conſilium,</hi> ſo as to occaſion a doubt whether the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be a general or privy council; and whether the former be a ſenate or parliament in the claſſic acceptation, or an affected ſubſtitute for the <hi>curtis</hi> or court of the king. The explanations of gloſſariſts are alſo arbitrary, and often derived from a ſingle ſentence, without conſidering the ſcope of preceding and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding paragraphs, or the affected ſenſe in which a particular<note n="8" place="bottom">Kaims' Eſſay on Brit. Ant. p. 54.</note>
                     <pb n="377" facs="tcp:0141700201:392"/>writer may uſe a particular expreſſion. That the king's court was merely of conſultation, and of judicature in particular caſes, like the ſucceeding privy council, there is every reaſon to infer; and if the parliament be ſtyled the royal court, in barbaric latinity, it is an abuſe of terms. The king's <hi>baron-courts</hi> were a kind of inqueſts, conſiſting of the great officers of the crown, and other chief barons to judge on important crimes and cauſes: even they differed much from the courts held by the barons themſelves, becauſe the monarch, however controuled and impoveriſhed by the great barons, yet main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained during the feudal ages a ſublime and ſuperlative charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the conſtitution, as the fountain of honour, the general, and chief magiſtrate, of the ſtate. But from theſe courts the parliament, or general council, was diſtinguiſhed in many ways. 1. It ſucceeded the general aſſemblies of the German tribes, mentioned by Tacitus, who ſays that on ſmaller mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or particular caſes, the nobles met and decided; while in larger the whole community aſſembled to determine on affairs of general intereſt<note n="9" place="bottom">Germ. c. xi.</note>. The former was the king's baron-court; the latter a parliament: the former was a meeting of the notables; the latter of the ſtates general. 2. The <hi>aula regis,</hi> or king's baron-court, though perhaps the former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted only of the chief officers of ſtate, the latter added the great barons, yet whether the ſame, or diſtinct, never poſſeſſed any legiſlative power. 3. The ſtates general often oppoſed the royal will; and the Engliſh parliament even depoſed Richard II; attributes which no fancy can aſcribe to the king's own courts, which exiſted only in virtue of his authority. 4. The king's courts met in his palaces, while no parliament ever ſat in a royal manſion; but in convents, abbeys, guild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halls,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:0141700201:393"/>and other detached places<note n="1" place="bottom">Dr. Gilbert Stuart on the Public Law and Conſtitution of Scotland, p. 81, 107, edit. 1784. It is to be regreted that the uſeful information, and ſolid argument, ſometimes preſented in this work, ſhould be diſtorted by the author's perſonal animoſity againſt Dr. Robertſon a writer of great talents. Dr. Stuart's ſtyle is alſo too turgid, and declamatory, to preſent clear information on obſcure topics; and the abominable plan, or rather confuſion, invented by Bayle, who emptied his common-place book on his dictionary, has been unhappily followed by both Robertſon and Stuart, in their enquiries on the progreſs of ſociety, &amp;c. while the ſhort text, and long notes at the end, not only preſent a moſt unclaſſical mode of compoſition, but ſeem merely calculated to diſmember and confuſe a ſubject, and oppreſs the patience of the reader.</note>. It may be added that the tenure <hi>in capite</hi> was not a <hi>right</hi> to ſit in parliament; it was on the contrary an <hi>obligation,</hi> in order that the national council, in which the ſovereign appeared in his greateſt luſtre, might be numerouſly attended, and not exhibit ſymptoms of diſaffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the rarity of the members. Before the feudal tenures prevailed, there can be no doubt but that every free-man had a right to appear in the general aſſembly, while the king's court was ſacred to the chiefs; and ſuppoſing a barony allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial, or free from tenure, that circumſtance could not have operated againſt the right of its poſſeſſor to appear in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional council. But the ſmall tribes, general aſſemblies, and idle life, of the ancient Germans, being followed by wide kingdoms in which no general aſſembly could be held, and by various occupations, it became neceſſary to enforce attendance by tenure, and fines; means from which the queſtion of right, acquired by tenure, is extremely remote.</p>
                  <p>In the more ancient periods of Scotiſh hiſtory the kings were the chief judges in fact, as well as in law; and ſat, at particular times, before a gate of the palace to hear and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine cauſes, eſpecially thoſe of the poor. This judicature was, in more poliſhed times, exerted by the monarch, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:0141700201:394"/>with his privy council: but it was chiefly uſed in puniſhing riots, and in other ſpecial caſes which demanded a ſpeedy remedy, and could not be deferred till the meeting of a parliament, the laſt court of reſort. In the laſt century it was to uſurp the odious powers of a ſtar-chamber, and its fall was matter of national exultation.</p>
                  <p>Such numerous minorities occur in the hiſtory of the Scotiſh monarchs, that the ſtate of the government at thoſe periods deſerves much attention, and will be found explained in ſeveral paſſages of the hiſtorical narration. It appears that the privy council retained its chief powers under a Council of Regency, though the officers of ſtate were often the principal members of both.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Officers of State themſelves claim the next conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and their original importance in the government, and in the national hiſtory, demands that particular attention ſhould be paid to their diſtinct duties and privileges.</p>
                  <p>In Scotland thoſe of chief conſequence at this period were the Lieutenant General of the Kingdom; the Steward, an office now held by the prince, and little exerted; the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; the Marſhall; the Chancellor; the Great Chamberlain; the Treaſurer; the Juſticiary; the Admiral; the Maſter of the Houſehold; the Privy Seal: the Comptroller; the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary. Among thoſe of ſmaller moment may be named the Clerk of the Regiſter; the Treaſurer depute; the King's Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate; the Juſtice Clerk; the King's Chamberlain.</p>
                  <p>The firſt named of theſe offices, though almoſt unknown to all writers on our conſtitution, was doubtleſs the ſecond in the kingdom, and almoſt amounted to a regency during a weak reign or a minority. The Lieutenant General commanded the whole military array and force of the realm; being a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute for the king himſelf, in his high capacity of general of
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:0141700201:395"/>the nation. We have ſeen the ambitious Robert duke of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bany appear in the ſynonymous characters of lieutenant gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and governor of the kingdom, during the reign of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert III his brother. The potent earls of Douglas held this office in the minority of the ſecond James: and it appears at intervals in the minority, and reign, of James V.</p>
                  <p>The ſtewardſhip, upon the acceſſion of the Houſe of Stuart, merged in the principality. As David duke of Rothſay was the ſole prince of that family, who came to majority after the acceſſion of the family, the kings held the lands and privileges of the office: and James IV, in the parliament of 1490, was to order that all the free-holders of the ſteward-lands "ſhould appear an anſwer in the parliaments, and court of circuit, with their ſuits and preſence, in a proper manner, till our ſovereign lord have a ſon, <hi>who ſhall be immediate betwixt the king and them, to anſwer for them in the ſaid parliaments, and courts of juſticiary:</hi> and ſuit-rolls to be made thereupon, which ſhall endure till the prince be born<note n="2" place="bottom">Cap. 16. Mr. Wight, p. 63, ſeems to underſtand that the prince was the natural repreſentative of his tenants in parliament; and ſee his appendix, p. 468, for a paper ſhewing that noblemen were underſtood to <hi>repreſent</hi> their lands, even ſo late as 1681. A curious topic too ample for diſcuſſion here, as leading to great queſtions; whether the nobles were not at firſt conſidered as <hi>repreſenting</hi> their tenants; the origin of repreſentatives for ſhires, after a county had ceaſed to be ſynonymous with an earldom; and others of ſimilar import.</note>." A ſtatute requiring the explanation of ſome legal antiquary.</p>
                  <p>The Conſtable, originally as the name implies, the officer who had charge of the royal ſtables, aroſe by degrees to be commander in chief under the ſovereign; and continued in that high rank in France, even in the century now under view. His office in Scotland appears to have been vague, and titular; and was confined to the arrangement of the royal camp, a duty which ſeldom occurred; to the reception of the
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:0141700201:396"/>members of parliament at the door of their hall; and other objects of more luſtre than utility. The noble family of Hay have long inherited this office; but we have ſeen it uſurped for a ſeaſon by Boyd earl of Arran: yet he might perhaps ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as a delegate for the aged earl of Errol.</p>
                  <p>The Marſhall was maſter of the horſe; as the Seneſchall, Styward, or Steward, was of the herds and flocks, the chief wealth of early times. The marſhall ought to have arranged the army in battle: and he was the chief judge in the courts of chivalry, to determine points of honour and arms. He was alſo conſidered as a commander in the field; and the French marechals long retained the office. The hereditary marſhalſy of Scotland continued for centuries in the family of Keith.</p>
                  <p>In the reign of James III the Chancellor aroſe to a precedence next to the prince of the blood. He was preſident and ſpeaker of parliament; examined, and paſſed, charters under the great ſeal; was preſident of the privy council, where and in the committees of parliament, he exerciſed great juridical func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. In ſhort he had the chief rank in civil affairs, as the Lieutenant General had in military.</p>
                  <p>The Great Chamberlain, an office originally joined with that of Treaſurer, collected the royal revenues, and accompted for the expenditure. His juriſdiction, as appears from the <hi>Iter Camerarii,</hi> was very extenſive: and a great proportion of the revenue ariſing from the cuſtoms, and other duties paid by the royal burghs, they were committed to his particular charge. The management of the magiſtrates, the uſe made of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the towns, the complaints and diſputes of the burgeſſes and craftſmen, the prices of proviſions, the rules of barter and ſale, were among the objects of his authority<note n="3" place="bottom">See the Iter Camerarii in Skene; and Stuart, p. 33.</note>. The collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:0141700201:397"/>of the royal revenues, and his power over the collectors, were alſo ſources of great influence. But the power of the Chamberlain over the Burghs was conſiderably reſtricted by the Court of Four Burghs, conſiſting of commiſſioners from theſe towns, who were ſummoned extraordinarily to hear appeals from the Chamberlain's circuit courts: but their ancient an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual meeting was at Haddington<note n="4" place="bottom">4to. Reg. f. 53.</note>. Theſe four burghs were Edinburgh, Stirling, Roxburgh, and Berwick; till the two latter falling into the hands of the Engliſh, it was ordered in the parliament of March 1368 that Lanark and Linlithgow be ſubſtituted, reſerving the rights of the former when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken<note n="5" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. The meeting of commiſſioners of the burghs at In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verkeithing, authoriſed by James III to form mercantile re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations, ſeems little to have increaſed their importance in national ſcale.</p>
                  <p>Latterly the office and power of the chamberlain were ſhared by the Treaſurer, who received and expended ſuch of the royal revenues, as belonged to the private expence of the king and his family. This office was introduced in 1424 by James I, on his return from England<note n="6" place="bottom">Crawf. Off. 252.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The Juſticiary was originally an officer of great power, as appears from the <hi>Iter Juſticiarii.</hi> His juriſdiction was both civil and criminal; and he held circuit courts twice in the year. Treaſon, and the four pleas of the crown, were ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially reſerved for his cognizance. But while the <hi>Juſtiza</hi> of Arragon was to controul the monarchs, the Scotiſh Juſticiary never attained any preeminence above other officers of ſtate. On the contrary his power was divided; there being often a Juſticiary for the counties ſouth of the Forth and Clyde, and another for the north<note n="7" place="bottom">The ſtatutes, by their frequent mention of the <hi>Juſtices,</hi> ſeem to indicate more; yet the deputies of the Juſticiaries may be implied.</note>. Till the office was aſſigned heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:0141700201:398"/>to the noble family of Argyle by James V, it had been held by Sir Robert Lauder of Baſs, and other names hardly known in hiſtory. And when Charles I withdrew it from Argyle it paſſed to Sir Thomas Hope, and afterwards to Sir Ludovic Stuart, men of talents, but far remote from the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Spaniſh <hi>Juſtizas.</hi> It is ſometimes uſeful to collate do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic cuſtoms with foreign; but to form general views of the feudal ſyſtem, and afterwards apply them to particular coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, without a profound and laborious ſtudy of their hiſtory, is a practice pregnant with errors. The feudal ſyſtem of each European kingdom forms quite a diſtinct province. It is eaſier indeed to draw materials from the literature of France, England, and other enlightened countries, than to ſearch into obſcure chronicles, old manuſcripts, and records, for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine hiſtory of the Scotiſh conſtitution. But an infinite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion ariſes from an injudicious mixture of our hiſtory, and antiquities, even with thoſe of England: they ought ſedulouſly to be keeped apart; and the ſkillful reader may afterwards himſelf compare the topics, as treated by the hiſtorians, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, and antiquaries of the ſiſter nations.</p>
                  <p>It is to be regretted that we have ſo few materials for the hiſtory of the next important office, that of Admiral: nor to the notices, ſcattered in the hiſtorical narrative, can any thing be here added. His juriſdiction in maritime affairs, in the reign of James III, appears from the reference of the Engliſh to his judgment, concerning the capture of vaſſels, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations on that account. In latter times he was Juſtice-general upon the ſeas, on freſh waters within flood-mark, and in all harbours and creeks; his authority extended to all mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time cauſes, comprehending queſtions of charter-parties, freights, ſalvages, bottomries, and the like. His delegate is the judge of the high court of admiralty; and he may appoint
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:0141700201:399"/>inferior deputies for diſtricts, but their ſentences are ſubject to the reviſal of the high court. The admiral's juriſdiction is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, and no queſtion can be transferred even to the ſeſſion, except by ſuſpenſion or reduction. Even many mercantile caſes are by uſage ſubmitted to the admiral<note n="8" place="bottom">Erſkine, Principles, b. I, t. 3, § 18.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The lord Privy Seal was an officer of conſiderable confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, who put the royal ſignet to gifts of moveables, and other ſmall grants not requiring ſeizin. The Secretary wrote the royal letters, and managed ſeveral private departments of buſineſs; latterly he came to be an officer of high rank and importance, and his frequent acceſs to the royal ear gave him ſuch influence that he almoſt rivalled the chancellor.</p>
                  <p>The Maſter of the Houſehold, <hi>Magiſter Hoſpitii,</hi> ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the royal domeſtics; and the Comptroller ſhared the former offices of the chamberlain, and treaſurer, by regulating the expences and checking the accompt, and ſupplying tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary advances of money.</p>
                  <p>The clerk of the regiſter, or maſter of the rolls, had the care of the records and charters, and was clerk of parliament. The treaſurer-depute's duty is explained by his appellation. Royal cauſes, and proſecutions for crimes, eſpecially treaſon, were prerogatives of the king's advocate. The juſtice-clerk, or clerk of juſticiary, was an aſſeſſor to the Juſticiary, to aſſiſt him in points of law; and the lord juſtice-clerk remains an office of importance. The king's chamberlain, or private chamberlain, was an officer of great favour and truſt; Sir William Crichton held this place, while Sir John Foreſter was great chamberlain; and the former was more in confidence with James I, than the latter.</p>

                  <p>"It is thought expedient, and ordained, for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of juſtice, the bringing in of treſpaſſors to law, and their puniſhment, that in time to come when the <hi>Crowner</hi> receives his <hi>porteous<note n="1" place="bottom">

Therefore it is decreed that in future no Crowner pretend to take any ſuch effects, till the ſheriff or his deputy ſhall paſs or ſend, examine the effects, and allot the Crowner his ſhare, the remainder to be delivered to the king's treaſurer; nor ſhall the ſheriff deliver more to the Crowner than his legal portion.

                  <p>In 1475 gifts of lieutenancy were iſſued by James III to Lennox, Argyle, Athole, Huntley, of various ſheriffdoms in which their eſtates lay. Nor were the clergy averſe to ſuch ſecular authority; among other inſtances the abbot of Kilwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning obtained the power of chamberlain over all the abbey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,

                  <p>The court of Seſſion had been inſtituted by James I in 1425. Its members were nominated by the king from the eſtates of parliament; and it was termed the Seſſion becauſe its meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were fixed at certain periods and places. James II or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained particular regulations concerning this court; but as its members only ſerved by rotation, and without ſalary, it was at once ignorant and negligent; and was at length to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed for a daily council, appointed by the patriotic parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of 1504. It is to be regreted that James I did not found courts upon the Engliſh model; but perhaps the penury of the country afforded no funds for ſalaries; perhaps the confined nature of the regal juriſdiction, or ſome other circumſtances prevented ſuch an attempt.</p>
                  <p>But the power of the ſeſſion, the juſticiaries, the ſheriff and coroner, was greatly reſtricted by the Regalities, or Lordſhips Palatine. Their juriſdiction was royal, as the name implies; in civil affairs it equalled that of the ſheriff; and in criminal it even comprized the four pleas of the crown, murder, rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery, rape, and fire-raiſing, rivalling that of the Juſticiaries over every crime, except treaſon. The lord of regality could <hi>repledge,</hi> or reclaim, all criminals ſubject to his juriſdiction, even from the courts of the Juſticiaries<note n="1" place="bottom">Erſkine Principles, b. I, t. 4, § 4.</note>. Theſe extravagant grants, incompatible with the regular adminiſtration of juſtice, had been laviſhed by the royal favour; or extorted by the
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:0141700201:404"/>power of ſeveral great barons, when they had themſelves ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled the Engliſh from their territories, or had rendered ſome eminent public ſervice. In 1455 an attempt was made to prevent any further grants of regality, by ſubjecting them to the conſent of parliament<note n="2" place="bottom">Acts, c. 43.</note>; but the practiſe was as inveterate as it was imprudent. The eccleſiaſtic lords, ever deſirous of exemption from any authority ſave that of the pope, are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have ſet the firſt example of regalities; the temporal authority was delegated to a Bailiff, and often hereditary. Regalities continued to be granted, and confirmed; and the charters of hereditary ſheriffdom to the peers and chiefs within their lordſhips, were almoſt tantamount, and became ſo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous as to extend over all the country. When regality lands were forfeited, the king appointed <hi>ſtewards</hi> over them with ſimilar powers; hence the hereditary ſtewards of Strath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern, Menteith, Annandale, Kirkudbright: while over baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial lands in the crown only <hi>Bailiffs</hi> were nominated, as in Kyle, Carric, Cunningham, and even the laſt-named offices were to be held hereditarily by peers. Happy country, thus filled with hereditary wiſdom and hereditary juſtice!</p>
                  <p>Nor muſt the Spiritual Courts be omitted, which before the reformation were to become great grievances. They origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſprung from the confidence which piety repoſed in the biſhops; who were entruſted with the care of eſtates, and orphan children. Hence their claim to judge in teſtaments and legacies: and marriage being a ſacrament, adminiſtred by eccleſiaſtics ſince the twelfth century, prior to which it was merely a civil contract, all queſtions of divorce, breach of vows, and the like, paſſed to the eccleſiaſtic courts; from which no appeal lay except to the metropolitan, or finally to
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:0141700201:405"/>the pontiff. Tythes and patronage were natural objects of church deciſion, and notaries were appointed by the pope: but ſcandal, and any affairs confirmed by an oath, though ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to eccleſiaſtic juriſdiction, might in all ages ſeem ſecular queſtions. The biſhops were ſuppoſed to be occupied in divine duties, and delegated their power to officials or commiſſaries: but the court was ſtyled the Biſhop's Court, or <hi>Curia Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitatis,</hi> and alſo the Conſiſtorial Court, from the <hi>conſiſtory,</hi> or court of appeals held by the Roman emperors<note n="3" place="bottom">Erſkine, b. I, t. 5, § 23. For the abuſes of the Conſiſtorial Courts ſee Lindſay's Play, p. 164, 170.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Two ſtatutes of James II, concerning the adminiſtration of juſtice, deſerve particular attention. "The three eſtates have ordained that the Juſtices on the ſouth ſide of the Scotiſh ſea (the firth of Forth) hold their courts of circuit twice in the year; and in like manner on the north; according to ancient uſe and cuſtom. And ſo alſo lords of regality within their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galities, and the king's baillies of his regalities. And that the king himſelf, till the due courſe of juſtice be reſtored, paſs to every town where the circuit is held, or to its vicinity, as his council ſhall think convenient<note n="4" place="bottom">1440, c. 5.</note>."—"It is ordained and decreed that in all circuits of juſtice, ſheriff courts, and generally all courts ſpiritual and temporal, all perſons, freeholders and others, ſhall attend in a ſober and quiet manner. And that no man bring with him more perſons than are in his daily houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, and family ſervice. And when he arrives at his lodging, he and they ſhall lay aſide their weapons and armour, if any they bring; and wear no weapon except a knife. And if any be at open enmity, and alledge fear of his life, the ſheriff ſhall require <hi>law-burrows,</hi> or legal ſurety, from both; and prohibit them in the royal name to diſturb the king's peace, on pain of incurring the law, which the king ſhall execute without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:0141700201:406"/>on the infringer. If the ſheriff be negligent he ſhall be puniſhed, according to the ſtatute ordained for reforming the faults of officers of juſtice<note n="5" place="bottom">1458, c. 82.</note>." In 1487 the lords and commons in vain engaged not to ſupport any criminal friends, or rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, at the bar: but the offence was to continue common in the ſucceeding century<note n="6" place="bottom">cap. 98.</note>.</p>
                  <p>James III in 1469 ordered that if the Juſtice, Sheriff, Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, Bailie, or Baron, Provoſt or Baillie of burghs, refuſe to execute juſtice the complainant ſhall repair to the king in council, who ſhall puniſh the offending magiſtrate by the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties there mentioned<note n="7" place="bottom">cap. 27.</note>. Among the grievances of this reign the abuſes of the court of Seſſion appear to have been one of the chief. The want of regular intermediate civil courts, between that of the ſheriff and the king's council, muſt have led to much inconvenience, and maladminiſtration; the power of the privy council having been ever eſteemed one of the grand defects of the Scotiſh conſtitution, being an arbitrary ſtar-chamber un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controuled by genuine juſtice or equity. With all its imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections the court of ſeſſion, conſiſting of all the members of parliament in rotation, muſt have been an inſtitution far more free and impartial.</p>
                  <p>Some regulations appear concerning inqueſts, and juries on criminal cauſes; but the want of juries in civil caſes was to continue a diſgraceful contraſt between Engliſh and Scotiſh juriſdiction.</p>
                  <p>Among the means of preſerving the public peace, the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Law-burrows</hi> muſt not be omitted. The term is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from <hi>borgh,</hi> a pledge or ſurety, which any perſon, in fear of another's violence, had a title to demand, that he ſhould not be injured in his perſon, family, or eſtate<note n="8" place="bottom">Erſkine, b. iv, t. 1, § 21.</note>. He who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:0141700201:407"/>to grant ſuch ſecurity was lyable to high penalties: when granted, the ſureties became amenable in the terms of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſtatute of 1466. "Concerning law-burrows it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, that if they be infringed on any biſhop, abbot, or prelate of the church, earl, or lord of parliament, with their perſonal hurt, or that of their ſervants, the ſureties of the infringer ſhall pay to our ſovereign lord a ſine of one hundred pounds. If on any knight, baron, ſquire, or clergyman of large bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, fifty pounds. If on a burgeſs, yeoman, or prieſt, thirty pounds. Together with due compenſation to the party injured. Unleſs the ſureties produce the infringer before the king or the ſheriff, within forty days. The king to have the fines of all law-burrows broken, that ſhall fall within the juriſdiction of his own officers, either in town or country: and the lords of regalities and baronies to have thoſe taken in their lands, by them or their officers, according to their ancient infeof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and privileges<note n="9" place="bottom">cap. 5.</note>."</p>
                  <p>One of the laſt ſtatutes of James III is in the following terms. "The three eſtates have committed the full power of the whole parliament to the perſons under-written, (they do not appear,) to adviſe, confer, and report to the next parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or general council, concerning the reduction of the king's laws, <hi>Regiam Majeſtatem,</hi> acts, ſtatutes, and other books, to be bound in one volume, and authorized; and the others to be deſtroyed. Four perſons to be appointed for each of the three eſtates. The prelates to bear the expence of the clerical mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: the barons of thoſe they ſhall appoint: and the burghs that of their commiſſaries<note n="1" place="bottom">1487, c. 115.</note>." In like manner James I had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a committee of ſix of each of the eſtates, to examine, and amend, "the books of law, that is to ſay <hi>Regiam Majeſtatem,</hi>
                     <pb n="393" facs="tcp:0141700201:408"/>and <hi>Quoniam Attachiamenta</hi>
                     <note n="2" place="bottom">1426, c. 54.</note>." It has been ſhewn by ſkilful judges that the work quaintly ſtyled <hi>Regiam Majeſtatem</hi> is a tranſcript of Glanville's production. It was probably brought into Scotland by David II, who was greatly attached to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and deſired to bequeath his ſceptre to an Engliſh heir; and by an artful incorporation of ſome genuine laws of Daivd I, Scotland was prepared to receive it as a code of that illuſtrious monarch. The feeble reigns of Robert II and III, and above all the tumultuous regencies of the dukes of Albany, had ſo far obliterated the very memory of the laws, that the error had in the reign of the firſt James taken deep root, and was to ſhoot vigorouſly<note n="3" place="bottom">
                        <p>See Sir D. Dalrymple's Examination of ſome of the arguments for the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity of Regiam Majeſtatem, Edin. 1769, 4to; and the Obſervations on the Regiam Majeſtatem, 8vo, written by John Davidſon, Eſq. a venerable promoter of the ſtudy of Scotiſh hiſtory and antiquities, who aſſiſted Dr. Robertſon in 1757, and continues his laudable reſearches though now in his ſeventy-ſeventh year.</p>
                        <p>While Sir David's arguments prove that the Regiam Majeſtatem could not exiſt before the reign of David II, he yet inclines to deny that it is ſo late as that epoch, becauſe in the reign of James I it was eſteemed an ancient and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic code: but this argument is anſwered in the text, and ignorant ages are ſuch complete ſtrangers to any ſtandard of antiquity, that the <hi>Leges Malcolmi,</hi> a then recent forgery, were ſuppoſed to be laws of Malcom I! To our old hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, Fordun and Winton, the Regiam Majeſtatem is unknown, and it is moſt probable that David II, when attempting to ſettle the ſucceſſion of his crown on a ſon of Edward III, endeavoured ſilently to aſſimilate to Scotiſh laws with the Engliſh, by its introduction. Yet failing, the book lurked in MS. in one or two monaſteries, when James I, equally deſirous of benefiting his kingdom by an emulation of Engliſh polity, revived it: but Craig, a ſuperlative judge, teſtifies that it never was a code of Scotiſh law, and that it has not even the leaſt connexion with the uſages or forenſic practice of Scotland. Lib. I, t. 8, § 7.</p>
                        <p>Sir David's ſecond argument, p. 36, that the Regiam Majeſtatem is more ancient than the time of David II, is ſo ſingular that it ſhall be tranſcribed entire.</p>
                        <p>"To this I add another chronological argument, which appears to have ſome weight. Cardinal Wardlaw, ſecretary to David II, died in 1389. His ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, Henry Wardlaw, was promoted by him to the rectory of Kilbride, and the precentorſhip of the cathedral of Glaſgow. He was made biſhop of St. Andrew's in 1404: and was chancellor of Scotland during the whole reign of James I. It will be admitted that the ſtatute 54, par. 3. James I, 1425, [1426,] was either drawn up by him, or under his direction. Now as biſhop Wardlaw was beneficed by his uncle, it is probable that he had come to man's eſtate before 1389, when his uncle died. Biſhop Wardlaw, educated under the Cardinal ſecretary to David II, muſt have known whether Regiam Majeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem was an ancient, or a very modern, compoſition. This 54th ſtatute ſhows that he conſidered it as an ancient compoſition: and hence, independent of all other arguments, there ariſes a cogent reaſon for believing that Regiam Majeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem was not compiled by the command of David II."</p>
                        <p>This argument is of too delicate, too feeble a texture: it forgets that the forgery might have happened early in the reign of David; that it might be a ſtate ſecret; that the book may not even be older than the reign of James I, no more ancient MS. or reference being known; that this laſt prince was a rational admirer of Engliſh polity, and might wiſh to introduce it by a holy fraud; that the chancellor or ſecretary might in conſequence even interpolate, or alter, the ſtatute, a complaint not unknown. But why waſte diſcuſſion? What muſt be the reader's ſurprize when he ſees this cogent argument completely overturned, only by reminding him that Henry Wardlaw, far from being chancellor, "during the whole reign of James I," <hi>never was chancellor at all?</hi> It was John Cameron, biſhop of Glaſgow, who was chancellor during all that reign, (Crawf. Off. 25:) and the continued favour of James to this able and reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble prelate, ſays more in his favour than is ſufficient to confute the fables of Boyce.</p>
                        <p>The Cromarty MS. of the Regiam Majeſtatem, in the Advocate's Library, concerning the antiquity of which Sir David heſitates to pronounce, is written about 1450, as appears from a ſac-ſimile now before me, and from the opinion of a ſkilful inſpector</p>

<pb n="394" facs="tcp:0141700201:409"/>Laws, ſeem chiefly of genuine indigenous birth. But an edition of our authentic ancient laws, with an ample diſſerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:0141700201:410"/>on the ſubject, is reſerved for enlightened times, of more acute and ſuſpicious judgment than thoſe of James I, or III. The code, of infinite importance to philoſophy, hiſtory and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities, would probably embrace, 1. The genuine laws of David I, forming many pages in the <hi>Regiam Majeſtatem,</hi> not to be found in Glanville: 2. The Laws of the Burghs, appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently ordained by David I: 3. Thoſe of the Baronial courts: 4. The <hi>Statuta Gildae:</hi> 5. The <hi>Iter Camerarii,</hi> and the <hi>Iter Juſticiarii:</hi> 6. The Foreſt Laws. The acts of Robert I, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid II, and the two latter Robert, admit of eaſy and certain authentication: thoſe of William and Alexander II, for none have yet ariſen of the third Alexander, would require more ſedulous care to complete the ſeries; which demands neither eminence of talents, nor exceſs of labour, but is eſſential to the national ſcience and reputation<note n="4" place="bottom">The canons of the councils, publiſhed by Wilkins, and thoſe of John Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meron biſhop of Glaſgow, MS. formerly mentioned, ought to be added, as forming the eccleſiaſtical law of the kingdom.

<pb n="396" facs="tcp:0141700201:411"/>ye that we, with the mature deliberation of our parliament, held at Edinburgh on the twenty eighth day of June, and of our reign the ninth year, have given, granted, and have by this our preſent charter confirmed, to our beloved couſin James <hi>lord</hi> (laird) of Hamilton knight, all and ſingular the lands of the baronies of Cadyhow and of Mawchane, and the ſuperiority of the lands of Hamilton-farm, and the lands of Corbaſkat, with the appendages, lying in the ſheriffdom of Lanark and barony of Kinneil, and with the appendages lying in the ſheriffdom of Linlithgow. Which lands, and ſuperiority, were formerly the hereditary property of the ſaid James; and which he, not moved by force or fear, nor led by error, but of his own free will, did reſtore, and purely and ſimply reſign, by ſtaff and baton, in the preſence of the three eſtates of our kingdom, into our hands, we then ſitting on our throne in parliament, in royal ſtate and majeſty; and he perpetually quitted all right and claim, which he might have, or acquire, to the ſaid lands, ſuperiority, or appendages, for himſelf and his heirs. All which baronies, lands, ſuperiority, and appendages, we create, join, and unite into one real free and entire Lordſhip, which ſhall in all future times be ſtyled and denominated the Lordſhip of Hamilton. And the manor-houſe of the ſaid James, now called the Orchard, ſituated in the barony of Cadyhow, ſhall be in future the principal and capital meſſuage of all the above baronies, ſuperiority, and lands, with appendages, of all the above Lordſhip, and ſhall be ſtyled and denominated <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi> And we create and name the ſaid James an hereditary lord of our parliament.

                     <pb n="398" facs="tcp:0141700201:413"/>At the time of this erection the houſe of Douglas was in the plenitude of its power; and the Hamiltons having ever been attached to that great family, the ſource of favour becomes evident; nor is it matter of ſurprize that lord Hamilton at firſt followed Douglas, againſt his ſovereign. After the fall of that houſe, and the marriage with the princeſs, the Hamiltons were to become one of the moſt potent families of Scotland; and in the ſixteenth and ſeventeenth centuries that of Argyle could alone conteſt the ſuperiority.</p>
                  <p>To the obſervations formerly given on TACTICS little can be added. In a parliament of 1456 James II ordered, "that all men who have lands or goods be ready, horſed and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coutred as their lands and effects will afford, for the defence of the realm, at the command of the king . . . . . . . And that every man, whoſe effects extend to twenty marks, be provided at leaſt with a <hi>jack</hi> with ſleeves to the hands, or ſplents; and a <hi>pricked hat,</hi> a ſword, and a buckler, a bow and a ſheaf of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows if he can procure them, if not an axe; and a targe either of leather, or firm board, with two bands upon the back<note n="6" place="bottom">cap. 56.</note>."</p>
                  <p>James III in 1471 ordained, "that no merchants ſhould import ſpears leſs than ſix elns in length, and that no bowyer in the kingdom ſhould make them of ſhorter ſize . . . that every yeoman, who cannot uſe the bow, ſhall have a good axe, and a targe of leather, to reſiſt the Engliſh arrows, which will only coſt the value of the hyde<note n="7" place="bottom">cap. 45.</note>." By both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments <hi>carts of war</hi> are ordered to be provided, which bore two patereros or ſmall cannon; a machine probably derived from the Flemings or French; and which Henry VIII was, from the Scotiſh example, to introduce into the Engliſh army<note n="8" place="bottom">They are repreſented in the Coudray picture. Groſe hiſt. of Engl. army, 2 vols. 4to, II, 330, a work unlike Daniel on the French, and without plan or chronology.
<p>The ſtatute of James II concerning the carts of war is in theſe terms, "It is thocht ſpeidfull that the king mak requeiſt to certane of the greit burrowis of the land, that ar of ony mycht, to mak cartis of weir; and in ilk cart twa gunnis, and ilk ane to have twa chalmers, with the remanent of the graith that efferis thairto; and ane cunnand man to ſchute thame. And gif they have no craft in the ſchuting of thame as now, they may leir or the tyme come that will be neidful to thame." Acts edit. 1566, fol. 38.</p>
                     </note>.
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:0141700201:414"/>In 1481 the ſpears are ordered to be five elns and a half in length; and the jacks, or leathern tunics, to extend below the knee; the targe of timber, or leather, to be made after the form of one ſent to every ſheriff<note n="9" place="bottom">cap. 81.</note>.</p>
                  <p>While the defenſive armour of the commons was the jack and targe, the leaders were arrayed in plate armour of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete ſteel, which had ſucceeded the mail or interwoven rings. The helmet had a viſor to turn up, for ſight; and a bever to turn down, to admit drink or food: ſometimes they both went up in diviſions under the front of the helmet, ſo as to leave the face open. The gorget, for the throat or neck, reſembled a flat baſon open in the middle. The cuiraſs covered the body; and had projections to defend the ſhoulders from the violent down-ſtroke of the axe or two handed ſword, as the creſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the head; theſe projections were termed paſs-guards. To allow motion to the thighs the culet, or <hi>garde-des-reines,</hi> a ſhort ſteel petticoat was contrived. The arms were protected by the braſers; the thighs by the quiſſets; the legs by the greaves; the gauntlets, ſplents, and other pieces, need hardly be enumerated. Even the horſe had his armour of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated denominations; and all his front was particularly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected from the ſpear, or ſword: the chafron, or cheveron, with a projecting point, covered his forehead; the poitrinal his breaſt; the criniere his neck: the buttock-pieces were

                     </note>.</p>
                  <p>The aſſaſſination of James I probably led to the inſtitution of the royal guard, which appears under his ſucceſſor, and James III; but which James IV was probably to diſcontinue, as on its revival by Albany, in the minority of the fifth James, it was regarded as a novelty. Concerning the number, or pay of the officers and ſoldiers, nothing ariſes till the laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned reign.</p>
                  <p>The Scotiſh guards of France were apparently inſtituted between the years 1453 and 1461; though they may be as ancient as 1445, when the <hi>gendarmerie</hi> were reſtored. In the following century the captain was generally a Frenchman: till 1612 many of the ſoldiers were Scots; under Louis XIV moſt were French: yet even in the middle of this century, when the watch was changed, the anſwer was <hi>Hamir,</hi> a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of "I am here<note n="2" place="bottom">Daniel Milice Françoiſe, Amſt. 1724, 2 vols. 4to.

                  <p>If we except the royal guard, and a few occaſional garriſons on the frontiers, Scotland was a ſtranger to any permanent troops, till the Reſtoration. France, her ally, had long ſet the example of ſtanding forces, at firſt the prop of a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and latterly the ruin. The connexion between that country and Scotland may warrant a brief digreſſion on the origin of an inſtitution, which has produced ſuch memorable effects on the political arrangements of Europe. The original
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:0141700201:416"/>feudal array of France generally ſerved for three months, on their own charges: the period was afterwards reſtricted to forty days, excluſive of the time occupied in joining the army or returning. About the year 1200 Philip Auguſtus had a paid militia, each fief furniſhing and defraying the expence of an apportioned number of ſoldiers; the defaulter was not only conſtrained to pay the ſum required for the ſervice, but a fine: and in 1392 Charles VI extended the penalty to the forfeiture of the fief. The <hi>communes, communitates,</hi> or pariſhes and burghs, alſo furniſhed and paid their proportions. The <hi>ſoldats,</hi> or <hi>ſoudoyers</hi> of Froiſſart, had fixed wages; and the officers and men ſold themſelves to any ſtate engaged in war. But their diſorders becoming exceſſive, Charles V terminated them, and raiſed the <hi>gendarmerie,</hi> the ſoldiery of the ſovereign, who paid the noble leaders from the royal treaſury, they providing the men. In the weak reign of Charles VI the diſorders re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned; Charles VII reeſtabliſhed the <hi>gendarmerie</hi> about 1445. He maintained fifteen troops, of 100 <hi>lances</hi> each; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded the burgeſſes and yeomanry to defray the expence, for their own benefit and protection, for the former <hi>gendarmerie</hi> had been lodged on them: each <hi>lance</hi> had five followers; ſo the whole number was nine thouſand. But there were alſo volunteers who ſerved at their own expence, in the hope of ſucceeding on a vacancy: ſo that the troop, or company, ſometimes amounted to 1200 horſe. They were lodged in the towns, only twenty or twenty five being allotted to one place; and their utility was ſoon perceived by the prevention of public ravages and diſorders, and the conſequent reſtoration of agriculture and commerce. They were all gentlemen, led by the nobles, who were ambitious to be captains of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darmerie, inſtead of leading their feudal force, which hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth was never raiſed except when the <hi>Arriere Ban</hi> was
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:0141700201:417"/>ſummoned. This inſtitution maintained its purity till the reign of Francis I, when modern ſoldiery appeared<note n="2" place="bottom">Daniel I, 55—156. Groſe, Eng. Army I, 330, obſerves that Edward III paid his troops in Normandy, ſixpence to a horſeman, three pence to an archer. At that time the dreſs of the Welch ſoldiers was only a tunic and mantle Ib. II, 2.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Nor muſt it be omitted that Charles VII ordered every pariſh to maintain one archer, who had certain immunities<note n="3" place="bottom">Daniel, I, 172.</note>; an example worthy of the imitation of the Scotiſh ſovereigns, in their anxiety to promote archery, as a band of one thouſand, trained and eminently ſkilled, might have afforded no mean aid in battle, and might have kindled univerſal emulation.</p>
                  <p>From the numbers of the Scotiſh army perhaps the only materials ariſe, from which the population of the country may be vaguely eſtimated: but unhappily the variations are ſo great that no accuracy can be expected. Bowar computes the array in 1436 at 400,000, half horſe half foot, including all between the age of ſixteen and ſixty, capable of arms, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting only herds, officers and ſervants of prelates, and ſome excuſed from neceſſity or merit<note n="4" place="bottom">Cont. Ford. II, 502.</note>. Suppoſing the array a ſixth of the population, the incredible number of two millions, four hundred thouſand, would reſult. Other general arrays are computed at one hundred thouſand; which ſuppoſing every eighth perſon appeared, gives the probable number of eight hundred thouſand. The preſent population exceeds a million and a half, and it has been gradually increaſing in this century: in the middle ages the moſt rational computation would be a million, yielding an array of eighty thouſand effective men; but ſometimes doubled by a diſorderly rabble of unarmed pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants and boys.</p>

                  <p>The ſtatute of James II, 1458, permitting lands to be let in <hi>feu,</hi> free from military ſervice, was a notable introduction to improvement<note n="5" place="bottom">Lindſay in his Play, p. 254, ſays the cuſtom was derived from France, Be ſet in few after the forme of France.</note>.

This reſtraint muſt greatly have impeded the progreſs of improvement, to which the free and frequent alienation of eſtates ſo much contributes; a new and monied poſſeſſor having many incitements, unknown to the indolence and routine of hereditary holders.</p>
                  <p>Severe ſtatutes were iſſued againſt thoſe foreſtallers, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their corn from the market, in expectation of a ſcarcity. In Auguſt 1452 it was ordered that all the corn in the kingdom ſhould be thraſhed out before the laſt day of May then next, and that none ſhould keep more in a granary than was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for their family. The meaſures were regulated in 1458; the firlot, containing eighteen pints, was to be ſixteen inches and a half in the recipient diameter; the half firlot, and peck, to follow in proportion<note n="9" place="bottom">Cap. 37, 73.</note>.</p>
                  <p>A parliament, held in July 1454, ordered every encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to foreign merchants importing grain; and to Scotiſh merchants bringing it from England<note n="1" place="bottom">Cap. 40.</note>. The act for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in 1477 allows, as has already been mentioned, that the chief ſupport of the country was by foreign importation. The low ſtate, and ſlow progreſs, of agriculture may be further judged of from the ſtatute of James II, 1458, ordering that every man, uſing a plough of eight oxen, ſhould ſow every year at the leaſt one firlot of wheat, half a firlot of peaſe, and <hi>forty</hi> beans, under a penalty of ten ſhillings to the baron<note n="2" place="bottom">Cap. 81.</note>: a mere tranſcript of a ſtatute of James I in 1426.</p>
                  <p>The ſame parliament of 1458 decreed that no fences ſhould be made of ſtakes, ſticks, or hewn wood, but only of <hi>lyand</hi>

Ordinances alſo appear for the deſtruction of eagles, buſtards, kites, hawks, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly wolves: for the latter purpoſe the ſheriff or bailiff of the county, where any appear, is to collect the people to hunt them; and the ſlayer of the wolf is to receive one penny from every houſeholder in the pariſh<note n="3" place="bottom">1458, cap. 84, 87.</note>. The burning of heath, from March till Michaelmas, is prohibited under the penalty of five pounds, that the ſtanding corn may not be damaged<note n="4" place="bottom">1477, c. 76.</note>. In 1477 the legiſlature condeſcended to ordain that a ſmith, who injured a horſe in the ſhoeing, ſhould ſupply another till he were ſound; or if irremediable, ſhould exchange him<note n="5" place="bottom">Ib. c. 79.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The ſowing of broom is ordered by a ſtatute of 1458: it is ſtill maſhed, and given to cattle in a ſcarcity of other food. The ſame act orders the freeholders, when they grant their yearly leaſes at Whitſunday, to inſiſt on their tenants' planting wood and trees, and making hedges<note n="6" place="bottom">Cap. 80.</note>. But theſe regulations ſeem to have had little effect; and a tenant liable to be turned out every year, muſt have had little ſpirit to plant or improve. Had the legiſlature ordered long leaſes, their ſkill and patriotiſm would have been more apparent. Even now the Scotiſh pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantry object to hedges, becauſe forſooth they ſhelter flocks of birds, who injure the grain; while the warmth and protection from the wind, ſupply double the ſtore devoured by theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truders. So the uſe of oxen in agriculture is objected to by the ſervants, becauſe they cannot ride them. When we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what mean intereſts, and prejudices, oppoſe improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in enlightened ages, there is leſs room to wonder at the ſlow progreſs of darker times.</p>
                  <p>An old chronicle has the following articles of intelligence. "1439. Was the dear ſummer, for the boll of meal was at
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:0141700201:421"/>twenty four ſhillings, and the boll of malt at two marks, and the boll of wheat at thirty ſhillings; and many died of famine." In 1482, after the king's impriſonment in the caſtle of Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, "the corn became more cheap, for the boll, that was at four pounds, was then ſold for thirty ſhillings of white (pure) ſilver<note n="7" place="bottom">Chron. end of Winton 17 D XX. The numerals in the laſt words are not clear, and may be xxii not xxx.</note>." The learned Ruddiman eſtimates a boll of wheat in 1424 at two ſhillings; of rye, barley, and peaſe, at one ſhilling and four pence; of oats at ſix pence: an ox ſix ſhillings and eight pence; a horſe thirteen and four pence<note n="8" place="bottom">Introd. ad Anderſoni Dipl. but his authority is the taxation act of James I, (ſee Appendix;) and it is probable the articles are not eſtimated at full price.</note>. Even in 1523 the boll of meal was at thirteen ſhillings and four pence. The above ſcarcities muſt of courſe have been enormous, and ſhew the incredible diſtreſs of the country in times of internal commotion; the value of the commoneſt proviſions being increaſed about twenty fold, as if the Engliſh quarter were to riſe from ſixty ſhillings to ſixty pounds!</p>
                  <p>Concerning the Uſeful Arts little information appears.

                  <p>The main objects diſcoverable from thoſe rude rimes are, that the chief exports of Scotland were fells or ſkins, hides, and wool; that the wool was manufactured at Popering and Bell, or Baileul, towns on the ſouthern Flemiſh coaſt, between Dunkirk and Calais; that to make fine cloth it was neceſſary to mingle it with ſome Engliſh wool: and that the Scotiſh im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports from Flanders were mercery, but more haberdaſhery, cart-wheels, and wheel-barrows.</p>
                  <p>Further hints concerning commerce may be derived from the ſtatutes. Salmon formed an important article of export; in 1487 it was ordered that each barrel ſhould be capable of
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:0141700201:424"/>containing fourteen gallons; and that each burgh dealing in that article ſhould have three iron hoops, to meaſure the caſk, which is afterwards to be marked with a hot iron. Cattle were not allowed to be ſold into England, except for ready money<note n="3" place="bottom">1487, c. 110. 1451, c. 35.</note>. Many other regulations concerning merchandize have already been ſtated, in narrating the tranſactions of the parliaments. It is ſingular that an act of 1458<note n="4" place="bottom">Cap. 67.</note>, bearing that merchants muſt be burgeſſes worth at leaſt three <hi>ſerplaiths</hi> of wool, is only enacted by the clergy and barons; the intereſt of the burgeſſes being eſteemed a ground for excluding them from the deliberation.</p>
                  <p>A ſtatute of 1467 conſiderably illuſtrates the ſubject. "It is ordained that in future no ſhip be freighted without a charter-party, containing the following agreements; namely that the maſter of the ſhip ſhall find a ſufficient ſteerſman, <hi>tymmer-men,</hi> and ſhip-men ſit for the ſervice. That the maſter gratuitouſly furniſh the merchants with ſire, water, and ſalt.

That no merchant's goods be torn or ſpoiled by improper ſtowage, nor anywiſe injured by the maſter or his ſervants, on penalty of loſing the freight, over and above compenſation for the damage.

                  <p>Concerning foreign merchants an important regulation was iſſued by James III, in his laſt parliament 1487. "For the common profit of the whole realm, and to excite ſtrangers of other realms to viſit this, with grain and other merchandize, to ſupport the king's ſubjects; it is ordained, that in future all ſtrangers be treated honourably, with all favour, at whatever port they arrive. That none of our ſovereign lord's officers, nor other ſubjects, diſturb them, or arreſt their perſons, ſhips, or goods; but they ſhall have full liberty and freedom to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of their goods, and ſell them to <hi>free-men,</hi> without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion or violence: nor ſhall any price be ſet upon their goods, except in fair bargain and ſale. That no new cuſtoms, impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nor exactions, be levied on them, but ſolely the ancient duties. And when any articles are wanted for the king, that his comptroller, or receiver, after the price has been ſettled, ſhall have as much of the firſt and beſt, as is neceſſary; for which immediate payment ſhall be made, that the ſtrangers may not ſuffer by the delay. That in future no perſon, under pretence of purchaſing for the king, take goods from ſtrangers, to ſell again, under the penalty of exile, and eſcheat of move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables. And any ſtrangers now in the realm, complaining of any goods taken from them, or any injury, ſhall have imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate payment and compenſation, according to juſtice: and in like manner any now abſent, who may arrive with complaints, ſhall receive compenſation and juſtice, againſt any perſon in the kingdom: ſo that by the adminiſtration of juſtice, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable treatment of all ſtrangers, they may be excited to return, to the great utility of the whole kingdom<note n="6" place="bottom">Cap. 114.</note>."</p>

Commerce was now in a flouriſhing condition in many countries: France, the ally of Scotland, had beheld Jaques Coeur, goldſmith or banker to the king, attain enormous wealth by induſtrious trade.

                  <p>The nominal value of the Scotiſh money, compared to the Engliſh, was about one to two, till 1451, when it became as one to two and a half; and five years after as one to three.

The gold coin has St. Andrew on one ſide, and the arms of Scotland on the other; and from the latter it was termed the Lion; it alſo bore the name of Demy, becauſe in the time of James I it weighed half the Engliſh noble.

                  <p>THE few incidents of eccleſiaſtic hiſtory are moſtly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven in the preceding books. Deſervedly jealous of the papal power, our kings continued to guard, by repeated ſtatutes, the liberties of the Scotiſh church, which in ſome meaſure cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponded with thoſe of the Gallican. In 1471 the purchaſe of any benefice or office at Rome was declared treaſon<note n="5" place="bottom">Cap. 44.</note>; that avaricious court contriving at this period to draw immenſe ſums from moſt European kingdoms, by the ſale of benefices, by arbitrary taxations, indulgences, and other arts: but the expence of the bulls of confirmation was to continue a ſevere tax on the Scotiſh biſhops and abbots.</p>
                  <p>The clergy loudly exclaimed againſt James III, for quaſhing the freedom of election, and aſſuming into his own hands the nomination to vacant benefices, which he ſometimes ſold to laymen. This right was to become a conſiderable ſource of influence to the crown, when no minority intervened; but it was perhaps one cauſe of the enmity betrayed by Mair, Boyce, and other eccleſiaſtic writers, againſt the royal family and prerogative. The avarice of the pope, a churchman, would have been more tolerable to them than that of their ſovereign; and the injury of their holy monopoly was an unpardonable oftence. James I had, in his firſt parliament, ordered that no clergyman ſhould paſs or ſend an agent out of the realm, without permiſſion; and that no benefices ſhould be purchaſed<note n="6" place="bottom">Cap. 13, 14.</note>:
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:0141700201:429"/>but the royal nomination ſeems rarely to have been exerciſed till the reign of James III; and the wealth of the church, which was at leaſt equivalent to that of all the lay-intereſt, became a great object of ſtate intrigue. In 1481 "it is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by the king and his three eſtates, concerning the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of the crown, uſed and obſerved in all times paſt, in the preſentation to benefices during a vacancy in the ſees of biſhops, that our ſovereign lord, and his ſucceſſors, ſhall in future, during the vacation of a ſee, have power to preſent to benefices, till the biſhop ſhew his bulls to the king's highneſs and to the chapter. And in caſe that our ſovereign lord, of his ſpecial grace and favour, admit any prelate to his tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities before he ſhew his bulls, ſuch admiſſion ſhall imply no prejudice nor harm to his highneſs, concerning the ſaid privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege and right of preſentation<note n="7" place="bottom">Cap. 85.</note>."</p>
                  <p>While even the penury of Scotland was taxed to pamper papal avarice, and luxury, the miſeries of other kingdoms were extreme. On the enquiry into the cauſes of the poverty of France, inſtituted in the States General held at Tours in 1484, though the <hi>Tiers-Etat</hi> chiefly conſiſted of clergy and <hi>maiſtres,</hi> it was agreed that the chief cauſe was the avarice of the popes, Alexander and Martin, which had drained the kingdom of not leſs than two millions of gold: much of the coin had alſo paſſed to England, and none remained in France except foreign money. The biſhoprics of France at that time amounting to one hundred and one, the abbies and conventual priories to more than three thouſand, the effects of papal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion were very extenſive; and it is ordered that no legate be be in future admitted to pillage the kingdom<note n="8" place="bottom">Jaligny hiſt. de Charles VIII, Paris 1684, folio, p. 399—409.

No religious ſyſtem even perverted morality ſo much as the roman ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic; pardon for ſins is ever a dangerous tenet; a better creed would prevent crimes by denying any celeſtial pardon.</note>.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="415" facs="tcp:0141700201:430"/>It is not a little remarkable that the papal dominions them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, at a time when all the wealth of Europe was pouring into them, were almoſt a deſert; a ſtriking inſtance of the abſurd and heterogeneous nature of eccleſiaſtic power in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral affairs. The ſtate of the church-lands in Scotland re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in obſcurity; but while the clergy ſometimes aſpired to commerce, they do not appear to have advanced agriculture.</p>
                  <p>Eccleſiaſtic cenſures, and excommunication, beginning to be deſpiſed in the reign of James II, they were enforced by ſecular penalties<note n="9" place="bottom">1443, c. 7. 1449, c. 11.</note>. In 1469 the power of appointing notaries in civil cauſes was aſſumed by the king, though the German emperor had before been underſtood to poſſeſs that prerogative. Yet the regal notaries are to be examined by the biſhops; and the papal notaries retain their power.<note n="1" place="bottom">1469, c. 31.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The eloquence of the pulpit remained in a low condition. Some judgment of it may be formed from the latin oration of Whitlaw to Richard III, in which he quotes Virgil, Statius, Cicero, and Seneca; and among other arguments for peace ſays, "Chriſt was born in peace, was buried in peace, ſleeped in peace, and reſted in peace." Yet in England at that period Dr. Shaw, and Friar Pinke, were celebrated preachers at St. Paul's croſs, in the popular idiom to a popular audience; and perhaps inſtituted the execrable example of political ſermons, by promoting the ſanguinary uſurpation of Richard. In de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineating the character of biſhop Kennedy, Lindſay ſays "he cauſed all parſons and vicars, to remain at their pariſh churches,
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:0141700201:431"/>for inſtruction and edifying of their flocks, and cauſed them to preach the word of God unto the people, and to viſit them when they were ſick. And alſo the ſaid biſhop viſited every church within his dioceſe, four times in the year, and preached to the pariſhioners the word of God truly; and enquired of them if they were duly inſtructed in the word of God, by their parſon and vicar, and if their ſacraments were duly admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtered, and if the poor were ſuſtained, and the youth edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and taught, conformably to the order that was taken in the church of God. And where he found that order was not followed he made great puniſhment, to the effect that God's glory might ſhine through all the country within his dioceſe; giving good example to all future archbiſhops, and churchmen in general, to cauſe the patrimony of the church of God be uſed for the glory of God, and the common benefit of the poor<note n="2" place="bottom">P. 110, edit. 1778, 8vo. That ſermons were common in the vulgar tongue before the reformation alſo appears from the <hi>Diarium Vazſtenenſe,</hi> p. 150, where in 1489 the biſhop of Lincopen "fecit ſermonem ad populum <hi>in vuigari.</hi>"</note>."</p>
                  <p>The remainder of the character of this venerable prelate may well intereſt the reader, as a picture of eccleſiaſtic worth, drawn in ſimple and pleaſing colours. "He was a man well learned in the civil laws, and of great experience in them; and by his genius, literature, knowledge, lengthened practice, and years, he knew the nature of Scotiſhmen ſo well, that he was the moſt able of all the lords of Scotland, ſpiritual or temporal, to give any wiſe counſel, or an anſwer when the time occurred, before the prince or the council; and ſpecially in the time of parliament, or when the embaſſadors of other countries came for their affairs, there was none ſo able as he to give them anſwer, conformably to their petition, and the deſires of their maſters. When any commotions occurred in
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:0141700201:432"/>the realm, he ſhewed equal wiſdom; for he gave counſel to king James II, when he was ready to depart out of Scotland, for fear of the earl of Douglas who had gathered againſt him to the number of forty thouſand men, ready to give him battle, or elſe to chaſe him out of the realm." Lindſay adds that the biſhop led the king into his oratory; and after prayers produced a ſheaf of arrows, not to be broken when joined, but eaſily fractured apart: from this demonſtration of an Eſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian apologue he ſhewed that the power of the ariſtocracy muſt be aſſailed by degrees<note n="3" place="bottom">Ibid. Lindſay is ſo fond of this ſtory, that he has interpolated it into his tranſlation of Boyce's reign of James II, p. 82—84; and repeats it here at full length.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The ſtate of the church may alſo be eſtimated from the old poem before quoted<note n="4" place="bottom">Prieſts of Peebles, <hi>ubi ſupra,</hi> p. 16, 17.</note>. One of the queſtions is, Why the pious biſhops, and clergy, of former times, exerciſed all good works, and performed miracles; while no ſuch practiſe or power, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared among their ſucceſſors? The anſwer is, that anciently the biſhops were choſen by the people, after invocation of the Holy Ghoſt, either from among the clergy of that chapter, or by ſelecting from thoſe of all the kingdom the perſon moſt proper for that particular ſee: that now they are appointed by the king, and introduced by the ſole hand of power; ſo that they can work no miracles, except by the ſpecial aſſiſtance of the devil: that no man procures a benefice by merit, literature, or even birth, but ſolely by gold, ſimony being accounted no tranſgreſſion: and the Holy Ghoſt having no hand in the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his precious gifts were in conſequence not imparted; while the regal inſpiration could only confer the love of gold, a gift of no miraculous nature: and the biſhops being them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſhorn, they practiſed the ſhearing of their flocks with
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:0141700201:433"/>great affiduity and ſucceſs; this being the genuine meaning of the ſymbolic eccleſiaſtical tonſure.</p>
                  <p>While the biſhops, and many abbots, were lords as having ſeats in parliament, the inferior clergy were diſtinguiſhed by the titles of <hi>Maſter</hi> and <hi>Sir;</hi> the former perhaps appropriated to a Maſter of Arts, the latter to one who had paſſed all his degrees, or poſſeſſed a conſiderable benefice. When Mary of Gelder came to Scotland, Gerard Boot monk of the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treuſe, her confeſſor attended her; on a voyage to Flanders he was taken by the Engliſh and robbed.

                  <p>Though the repeated internal commotions were unfavourable to the progreſs of literature, yet ſeveral writers aroſe during this period. Margaret the dauphinefs, as has already appeared, was a poeteſs in French; and perhaps ſome of her ballads and rondeaux may lurk in the libraries of France. Holland, the author of the Houlat, wrote about 1450; Henry the Rimer, a ſtrolling poet, repeated his fables concerning Wallace, about 1460 or 1470: and about the ſame period Clerk of Tranent ſeems to have compoſed his metrical romances on the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Gawin, a knight of Arthur's court<note n="6" place="bottom">For the poets in general ſee the various volumes of ancient Scotiſh poetry publiſhed by the author.</note>. The riming prophecies, aſcribed to Merlin, Beda, and others, were of Engliſh growth; but were adopted in Scotland with all the credulity of a dark period, and had even their influence on public meaſures, theſe books of the Sybil being conſulted and repeated, in this and the following century, with great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the application of the prediction<note n="7" place="bottom">They are the beſt remains of the Engliſh poetry of the fifteenth century; and there is an excellent MS in the marquis of Lanſdowne's library.</note>.</p>

                  <p>The chief chronicler of this period was Bowar, the enlarger and continuator of Fordon's work. He wrote in the year 1444<note n="9" place="bottom">P. 490: in the 14th year of the age of James II, born in 1430.</note>; and Scotiſh hiſtory is indebted to his labour, though his deplorable defect of judgment render his work a mere chaos of materials, mingled with eccentric digreſſions, and excurſive reading. Yet from theſe the ſtate of learning in the country may be eſtimated. He quotes upwards of one hundred authors, and among them many latin claſſics; but former compilations no doubt ſupplied him with much of his erudition. The common uſe of paper rapidly increaſed the number of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcripts:
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:0141700201:435"/>and the invention of printing was ſtill more to ſerve the cauſe of ſcience.</p>
                  <p>Bowar had unhappily no ſucceſſor till John Mair wrote in 1521: and for the affairs of the fifteenth century we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to the reſearches of Lindſay, Ferrerius, Leſley, and Buchanan, who do not indicate their ſources of information. Yet apparently ſhort chronicles were written, and preſerved in the monaſteries, till they periſhed in the violence of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, or mouldered amid the neglect of literature, in the ſucceeding century of eccleſiaſtic diſpute and fanaticiſm. In his laſt chapter Bowar ſays he deſiſts from writing, leſt he might ſeem to flatter the living actors; and he cloſes with the following advice. "It is properly ordered in moſt countries, and as I have heard in England, that every monaſtery of royal foundation ſhould have its appropriated ſcribe, to narrate the more memorable events, that occur during each reign, in that and the neighbouring countries, according to ſtrict truth, and chronology. On the death of a king, theſe chroniclers proceed to the firſt general council, and produce their labours; which are referred to the examination of the moſt ſagacious and ſkillful, who from the whole digeſt one ſummary chronicle. The books are then returned to the libraries of the monaſteries, as authentic chronicles deſerving of faith, leſt by the lapſe of time the memory of events ſhould periſh in the kingdom. So would I adviſe our king to order, leſt if the preſent work ſhould be loſt, which heaven forbid, the memory of popes, kings, peers, and illuſtrious men, ſhould alſo periſh; with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citements to virtue, or the cautions againſt faults, which are afforded by the peruſal of their actions<note n="1" place="bottom">P. 516, 517.</note>." This advice was unhappily not followed: and our monarchs, amid their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:0141700201:436"/>of the arts, ſeem little to have attended to the utility and glory of national hiſtory. The monaſtic cellar was better repleniſhed than the library; and the jolly inhabitants preferred one terreſtrial beauty to all the nine muſes. In France, as has appeared in narrating the events of 1448, there was a chronicler at St. Denis, who inſerted narratives upon the oaths of the relators: and indeed every hiſtorian ought to write as if he had made a ſolemn aſſeveration, in the preſence of God and his country, that truth ſhall be his ſole purſuit. The judicious Forteſcue informs us that the chronicler of St. Albans wrote, at the end of every month, what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in its courſe: and that this work, which was called <hi>Flores Chronicarum,</hi> was of more authority than any in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land<note n="2" place="bottom">Declaration of Sir John Forteſcue on certain writings ſent from ſcotland, againſt the title of Edward IV to the Engliſh crown. MS. Harl. 1757.</note>.</p>
                  <p>In the other departments of ſcience little appears. Sir Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Hay, formerly chamberlain to Charles VII of France, in 1456 tranſlated Bonet's Arbre des Batailles, a once popular book of arms and heraldry, into Scotiſh, at the requeſt of William Sinclair earl of Orkney and chancellor<note n="3" place="bottom">Mackenzie's lives Sc. writers from the MS. in his poſſeſſion.</note>.</p>
                  <p>For the language of this epoch the appendix may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted, where ſeveral papers in Scotiſh will be found. In general there is little difference, in the ſpeech of England or Scotland, between this and the following century; and the ſpelling is as little redundant.</p>

                  <p>THE Gothic architecture had now attained its greateſt perfection, in ſublimity, richneſs, and variety. About 1444 William Sinclair, the celebrated earl of Orkney, founded a collegiate church at Roſlin, four miles from Edinburgh, for a provoſt, ſix prebendaries, and two ſinging boys<note n="4" place="bottom">Bowar, 541, ſays it was building when he wrote, 1444. Crawf. Off. 34, dates the foundation 1441. And ſee Spottiſwoode, Rel. Houſes, p. 288. If the remaining chapel be the chief fabric, it can hardly be called a collegiate church.</note>. A chapel, which remains entire, is a gem of Gothic architecture, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally known and admired.</p>
                  <p>James III was ſo fond of this art that Cochran, an architect, became his chief favourite. Beſides the great hall in the caſtle of Stirling, he founded the royal chapel there, an inſtitution of great magnificence for that age<note n="5" place="bottom">Lindſay, &amp;c.</note>. The dean was to be the queen's confeſſor, and to have epiſcopal juriſdiction: this dignity was firſt annexed to the provoſtry of Kirkheugh near St. Andrew's, another royal chapel; and afterwards to the biſhopric of Galloway. There were beſides a ſub-dean, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſtan, chanter, treaſurer, chancellor, arch-deacon, ſixteen chaplains, and ſix ſinging boys, with a maſter of muſic. The endowments conſiſted of two abbies, numerous churches, and lands. James IV was to maintain and enlarge the inſtitution; and to procure the papal confirmation<note n="6" place="bottom">Spottiſwoode, ib.</note>. The architecture,
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:0141700201:438"/>and decorations, apparently correſponded with the greatneſs of the revenue annexed, and with the royal favour and piety.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1458 biſhop Kennedy founded St. Salvator's college in St. Andrew's: and erected a magnificent tomb for himſelf in which he was interred in 1466<note n="7" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. This tomb is a favourable ſpecimen of the ſtate of the arts at that period. But a Turkiſh cuſtom, of a plain ſtone, with a large hole or two to collect rain-water, that the birds may find drink, breathes more of chriſtian humility and charity.</p>
                  <p>The large golden medal of James III, appended to the ſhrine of St. John at Amiens, and minutely deſcribed by Du Cange, was probably the production of an Italian or Flemiſh artiſt. That ſome eminent foreign painter had alſo viſited Scotland about 1482, appears from the celebrated picture at Kenſington, in the form of a folding altar piece, painted on both ſides, or in four compartments. The firſt repreſents the king kneeling; behind him is his ſon, a youth about twelve years of age, which aſcertains the date; and St. Andrew the patron ſaint of Scotland. The royal crown is not arched, nor was apparently till the reign of James V, when new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galia were ordered, but it has high fleurons of great richneſs; the robe is of a lilac hue furred with ermine; the veſt, cloth of gold. In the ſecond compartment the queen appears, alſo kneeling, in a kirtle of cloth of gold, and blue robe; her head-dreſs one blaze of gold and jewels: the arms depicted with exact heraldry indicate the daughter of Denmark; and behind her is a perſonage in plate-armour, apparently her father in the character of St. Canute, the patron of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                  <p>Of the two compartments, on the reverſe of this grand piece, one repreſents the Trinity. In the other an eccleſiaſtic
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:0141700201:439"/>kneels; but his heraldry of three buckles and a cheveron can hardly be traced, except to the obſcure family of Bonkil in the Merſe<note n="8" place="bottom">It may be Sir William Rogers, or ſome other eminent foreigner.</note>. Behind is a kind of organ, with two angels, not of ideal beauty, and perhaps portraits of the king's two ſiſters, Mary lady Hamilton, and Margaret then unmarried; a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture ſupported by the uncommon ornament of a coronet on the head of one of the angels. Hardly can any kingdom in Europe boaſt of a more noble family picture of this early epoch: and it is in itſelf a convincing ſpecimen of the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of James III to the arts<note n="9" place="bottom">The ſtyle of painting, as uſual in ſuch early pieces, is that of the miniatures in manuſcripts enlarged, originally the productions of monks and nuns. In that curious work the <hi>Diarium Vazſtenenſe,</hi> publiſhed by Benzelius at Upſal 1721, 410, being a minute chronicle of events happening at Wadſtena, on the Wetter lake, in a convent of monks and nuns united, a privilege peculiar to frigid regions, the following notices occur, concerning the arts nouriſhed by the monaſteries.

                     <pb n="425" facs="tcp:0141700201:440"/>In deſcribing the character of that prince, Ferrerius men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that he not only loved literature, and invited John Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land a celebrated Scotiſh doctor of the Sorbonne into his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and rewarded his talents with a rich benefice; but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended his patronage to muſic in particular. William Roger, an excellent Engliſh muſician, having attended the embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of Edward IV into Scotland in 1474, James was delighted with his performances; and perſuading him to remain in his court, raiſed him to knighthood. "Under the inſtruction of this man, the moſt celebrated of his profeſſion, numerous eminent muſicians aroſe in the court of Scotland: and, even ſo late as 1529, many great muſicians boaſted that they were of his ſchool<note n="1" place="bottom">f. 391.</note>."</p>
                  <p>Holland, in his poem of the Houlat or owl, apparently a ſatire on James II, by a partizan of the houſe of Douglas, mentions no leſs than twenty five kinds of muſical inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments<note n="2" place="bottom">Scotiſh Poems, 1792, Vol. III, p. 179.</note>.</p>
                  <p>In proceeding to conſider the ſtate of Manners, the military exerciſes attract the firſt notice. To promote the practiſe of archery, the games of foot-ball, and the golf, continued under ſtrong prohibition. Yet the highlanders appear to have been the chief archers in the ancient Scotiſh armies, while the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers preferred the ſpear. In deſcribing the army of James III, in 1488, Lindſay enumerates no leſs than ten thouſand highlanders with bows, under the earls of Huntley and Athole<note n="3" place="bottom">The author of the Preſent State of Scotland, 1682, mentions, p. 6, bows and arrows as the chief weapons of the highlanders, even of that period.</note>. Repeated ſtatutes were ineffectual to introduce
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:0141700201:441"/>archery in the lowlands. One of the moſt preciſe is that of James II, in his noted parliament of 1458. "It is decreed and ordained that the diſplays of weapons be held by the lords and barons, ſpiritual and temporal, four times in the year: and that the foot-ball and golf be utterly cried down, and not to be uſed. That the bow-marks be made, a pair of buts at every pariſh church, and ſhooting be practiſed. That every man ſhoot ſix ſhots at the leaſt; and that two pence be levied upon the abſent, for drink to the ſhooters. The practice to laſt from Eaſter till All-ſaints; and all to be ready by next midſummer. That there be a bowyer, and fletcher, in every chief town of a ſhire; the town to furniſh them with the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary materials to ſerve the country. The penalty on foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball and golf, a fine to the baron; and if he neglect, the king's officers ſhall levy it. If the pariſh be large, there ſhall be three, four, or five bow-marks, in the moſt convenient places; and that all men exceeding twelve and under fifty years of age practiſe archery<note n="4" place="bottom">Cap. 64</note>."</p>
                  <p>Among the great the chief exerciſe of arms was the ſolemn tournament, which might almoſt be claſſed under the head of Tactics, did that ſcience comprize the preparations for war. Theſe grand diſplays of martial ſkill were ſeldom undertaken by any, ſave thoſe who had been ſolemnly inveſted with the order of knighthood, an inſtitution forming a kind of fraternal ſociety throughout Europe, and which contributed not a little to diveſt war of its horrours, to abate national animoſity, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the intercourſe and conſequent civilization of remote kingdoms.</p>
                  <p>Knights were generally created with great ſolemnity by the king himſelf; ſometimes by the general, or other aged knights
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:0141700201:442"/>of eminent fame before a battle. The ancient oath adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in Scotland has been preſerved, and deſerves inſertion, as a curious relique of the ſpirit of chivalry.</p>

                     <pb n="428" facs="tcp:0141700201:443"/>The Scotiſh knights continued to vye with any in Europe. The celebrated tourney of 1449 has already been briefly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the hiſtorical narrative, but a minute account of that noted conteſt ſhall here be tranſlated, as literally as poſſible, from the Memoirs of Olivier de la Marche, a contemporary Burgundian writer; as a picture of manners, delineated in plain and ſimple colours<note n="6" place="bottom">Liv. I. c. 17; p. 271—274, edit. Gand 1566, 4to. Meriadet was a ſquire of Bretagne, ib. p. 265. Jaques de Lalain was at length killed by a cannon-ſhot in 1453, p. 394: the church and manſion of Lalain were in Hainault, a noted country of warriors.</note>.</p>
                  <p>"When Meſſire Jaques de Lalain ſaw that there was no further occaſion for him there, he returned, and ſound the good duke of Burgundy in his city of Lille, who received him favourably: but he ſoon took leave of the duke, and ſet our for Scotland. He was accompanied by Meſſire Simon de La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain his uncle, and Hervé de Meriadet, and many other worthy men; and ſo far as I underſtand Meſſire James Doug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, brother of the earl of Douglas, and the ſaid Meſſire Jaques de Lalain, had formerly wiſhed to meet in arms, and had ſought each other for that purpoſe. At the inſtance of the ſaid Meſſire James Douglas battle was permitted by the king, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and M. Jaques de Lalain: but the affair grew and multiplied ſo that a conflict <hi>to outrance</hi> was concluded on, of three noble Scotiſhmen, againſt M. Simon and M. Jaques de Lalain, and Hervé de Meriadet, all to fight at once before the king of Scotland. And when the day of the conflict came, the king moſt honourably received them in the liſts: and though I was not myſelf a ſpectator, yet I muſt recount the
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:0141700201:444"/>ceremonies, for example to future times. For three memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable things occur, beſides the battle, which was moſt fiercely diſputed on both ſides."</p>
                  <p>"The firſt was, that when the three belonging to the court of Burgundy were all armed, and each his <hi>coat of arms</hi> on his back, ready to enter into battle, M. Jaques de Lalain ſpoke to M. Simon his uncle, and to Meriadet, and ſaid, "Meſſieurs and my brothers in the conflict, you know that it is my enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize which has led us into this kingdom, and that in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence the battle has been granted to M. James Douglas; and although each of us may aſſiſt his comrade, I beg and requeſt you that, whatever befall me this day, none of you attempt to ſuccour me, for it would ſeem that you had paſſed the ſea, and entered into this conflict only to aſſiſt me; and that you did not hold or know me a man able to ſuſtain the aſſault and combat of one knight, and hence leſs account will be held of me and my knighthood."</p>
                  <p>"After this requeſt ſallied from the pavilions the champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in armour, furniſhed with axes, lances, ſwords, daggers; and they had leave either to throw or puſh their lances as they choſe."</p>
                  <p>"The two Meſſires James Douglas and Jaques de Lalain were in the middle, to encounter each other, which they did. On the right was M. Simon de Lalain, who was to engage a Scotiſh ſquire, and Meriadet was to meet a knight of high power and fame; but they found themſelves tranſverſe, ſo that the knight was oppoſite to M. Simon: and then Meriadet, (who deſired to aſſail him who was appointed, without regard to the ſtrength or fame of his antagoniſt,) paſſed acroſs, to place himſelf before M. Simon, and meet his man. But the good knight coldly and firmly turned towards Meriadet, and ſaid, "Brother let each keep himſelf to his opponent; and I
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:0141700201:445"/>ſhall do well if it pleaſe God." So Meriadet reſumed his rank before his antagoniſt: and this is the ſecond thing which I deſired to commemorate."</p>
                  <p>"The champions began to advance each againſt the other; and becauſe that the three on the part of Burgundy doubted leaſt the place might be too confined, for ſo many lances, they all three threw their lances behind them, (the third cauſe of my recital;) and ſeized their axes, and ruſhed on the Scots, who came within puſh of lance, but that availed them nothing. Though all fought at once, I ſhall rehearſe the adventures one after the other."</p>
                  <p>"The two Meſſires James, Douglas and de Lalain, met each other, and approached ſo nigh, that of all their weapons there remained none ſave a dagger, which the Scotiſh knight held. The ſaid M. Jaques de Lalain ſeized him by the arm, near his hand which held the dagger, ſo cloſely, that the Scot could not avail himſelf of it; and he held the other arm below the arm-pit ſo that they turned each other round the liſts for a long time."</p>
                  <p>"M. Simon de Lalain and the Scotiſh knight were ſtrong champions, and neither of them ſkilled in warding blows of the axe: like two valiant knights they attacked each other of often, that in a ſhort time they had cruſhed the viſors of their baſinets, and their weapons and armour, with mutual blows; and the fight ſeemed equal."</p>
                  <p>"On the other ſide was Hervé de Meriadet, whom the Scotiſhman attacked with the puſh of lance; but Meriadet turned off the blow with the but end of his axe, ſo that the lance fell from the Scot's hands: and Meriadet purſued him ſo keenly that, before the Scot could undo his axe, he came within his guard, and with one blow felled him to the earth. Meriadet then left the Scot to ariſe, who was quick, light,
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:0141700201:446"/>and of great ſpirit, and aroſe ſpeedily, and ran to Meriadet for the ſecond time. Meriadet, (who was one of the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted ſquires of his time for ſtrength, lightneſs, coolneſs and ſkill in arms and in wreſtling,) received the aſſault with great compoſure, then returned it, and again ſtruck him to the ground with his axe; when the Scot again attempted to riſe, but Meriadet ſtruck him on the back with his hand and knee, and made him fall flat on the ſand. And notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the requeſt which Meſſire Jaques de Lalain had made, the ſaid Meriadet, ſeeing the ſtruggle of the two knights, advanced to aſſiſt the ſaid Jaques; but the king of Scots threw down his baton, and they were parted. Now though it be againſt my plan, and though I write of this combat without having ſeen it, I nevertheleſs report it truly, by the report of the Scots and of our party."</p>
                  <p>Such is this curious contemporary relation. Other valuable materials concerning the manners of this period, may be found in the annals of De Coucy, another Burgundian coeval hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, who probably attended Mary of Gelder to Scotland in 1449, as before mentioned. On her landing, the clergy, citizens, and people of Leith, were ready to receive her; and ſhe thence proceeded on horſeback, behind the lord of Vere, to Edinburgh, where about ten thouſand people advanced to meet her. A biſhop, and the chancellor, conducted her to the monaſtery of the Jacobins, or Gray Friars. After the king's firſt viſit on thurſday, the counteſſes of Orkney, and March, and another, attended on her by the royal command. When ſhe had ſufficiently refreſhed herſelf from the fatigues of the voyage, James, on the following wedneſday, ſent to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the next day for the wedding; and preſented her with two hackneys worth about thirty French crowns. On thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, the wedding-day, the king came on horſeback, and was
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:0141700201:447"/>dreſſed in a grey robe lined with white cloth, boots and ſpurs. The queen was clothed with a robe of violet colour, lined with ermine; in a ſtrange faſhion, ſays De Coucy, if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with thoſe of France; and her long hair hanging down. The coronation of the queen immediately followed the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage<note n="7" place="bottom">Hiſt. par De Coucy in the edition of Jean Chartier, Paris 1661, folio, p. 574—578.</note>. From ſome of the preceding circumſtances it would rather appear that James II was auſtere in manners, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence; and reverſed his father's magnificence, which was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>popular in a penurious country, and was imputed to an Engliſh education.</p>
                  <p>At the feſtival, which followed the ſolemnity, the firſt diſh was the figure of a boar's head painted, and ſtuck full of <hi>hards,</hi> or coarſe bits of flax, which was ſerved up in an enormous platter, ſurrounded with thirty two banners, bearing the arms of the king and chief nobles. The flax was then kindled, amid the joy and acclamations of the numerous and brilliant aſſembly in the hall. A ſhip of ſilver, exquiſitely wrought, was then introduced, probably containing ſalt and ſpices in diſtinct compartments. The earl of Orkney then entered, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by four knights, preceding the firſt ſervice: and every ſervice was brought by about thirty or forty perſons all bearing diſhes. At the ſecond table the counteſs of Orkney, and other ladies, ſat with the lord of Vere. At a third was a <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch,</hi> ſays De coucy, perhaps a papal legate, or foreign vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitant, or ſome Scotiſhman enjoying a titular dignity; three biſhops, an abbot, and other churchmen; the five dignitaries drinking out of a large <hi>hanap,</hi> or bowl of wood, without ſpil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling any: the wine, and other liquors, being as abundant as ſea-water. The dinner continued about five hours, there
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:0141700201:448"/>being neither dancing nor ſupper. On the following days there was excellent cheer in their way, proceeds this author, which was very rude and ſtrange, when compared with that of France. In five or ſix days Vere ſet out on his return; and the king made <hi>ſome</hi> preſents. The queen weeped at their departure, though Iſabel de Lalain, and two or three other women, and as many men of her country, were left to ſerve her<note n="8" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.</p>
                  <p>In the reign of James III, the author of the old poem before quoted repreſents his three prieſts as enjoying their collation at Peebles, conſiſting of three roaſted capons with ſauce, and many other meats; and imputes to their deſire of privacy that they had only a boy to ſerve them. A <hi>roundel</hi> or round table, covered with a fair cloth, ſtands before them; and neither bread nor liquor are wanting. Taverns, and dice, are repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated; and a merchant's cupboard of plate is eſtimated at three thouſand Scotiſh pounds, or about ſeven thouſand five hundred of modern ſterling currency<note n="9" place="bottom">P. 3, 11, 10. Beſides plate, <hi>mazer</hi> cups are mentioned by the Scotiſh poets. This ſubſtance, correſponding with the French <hi>madre,</hi> appears to be china, or earthen ware, painted like the old vaſes ridiculouſly aſcribed to Raphael.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The advances of luxury among the ariſtocracy, and clergy, may alſo be eſtimated by that of concomitant crimes. The two ſtatutes of 1450, againſt domeſtic and foreign importers of poiſons, ſhew that profligacy had made more rapid ſtrides than civilization. Another ſort of poiſon, bad wine, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdicted by a ſtatute of 1482, declaring the penalty of death to any importer, ſeller, or compoſer of corrupted or mixed liquor<note n="1" place="bottom">1450, c. 30, 31. 1482, c. 89.</note>.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="434" facs="tcp:0141700201:449"/>Game and hunting were luxuries of the great. In 1458 it is ordered that none deſtroy the neſts or eggs, or fowls them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves when moulting; nor kill hares or rabbits in the ſeaſon of ſnow, on pain of indictment. A penalty of ten pounds is in 1474, impoſed on ſtealers of hounds or hawks, trained or untrained; or even taking eggs, or young hawks, out of neſts in another perſon's property: that for robbing the neſts of partridges or wild ducks is forty ſhillings. The ſlaughter of does, roes, or deer, in time of ſnow, or their young under a year's growth, is puniſhed by indictment, and a fine of ten pounds: and the ſtealing of deer or roes from incloſures or parks, rabbits, pigeons, or fiſh in ponds or ditches, is made liable to the ſame puniſhment as any other act of theft<note n="2" place="bottom">1458, c. 84. 1474, c. 60, 61.</note>.</p>
                  <p>To diverſify the prolixity of a life of idleneſs, and relieve the formalities of ceremony, were objects attempted by the maintenance of a regular fool, who however had generally ſenſe enough to reſpect his maſter. He was diſtinguiſhed by his party coloured coat, his cap with large ears and bells, and his club or bauble, ornamented with groteſque alluſions to his profeſſion. The minſtrels and choriſters were muſicians, ſo termed becauſe in the middle ages church muſic was the only branch of the art which was regularly cultivated. But Lind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay mentions that a part of the choriſters of the chapel-royal at Stirling always attended James III, "to make him merry<note n="3" place="bottom">P. 136.</note>;" and it appears that the eccleſiaſtic muſicians did not diſdain ſtrains of recreation. In Holland's poem the minſtrels are ſolely occupied in ſinging hymns, accompanied with numerous muſical inſtruments<note n="4" place="bottom">Scotiſh Poems, 1792, III, 177.</note>. The poets, compoſers of ſongs and romances, were generally of the clerical order: the term of
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:0141700201:450"/>minſtrel was afterwards applied to any muſician, but the only ſtrolling poets were the Iriſh or highland bards, whoſe rude manners are depicted by Holland, and who are claſſed in the ſtatutes with common vagabonds: while James III ſo highly favoured minſtrels, or muſicians, that he permitted them to equal knights or heralds in their apparel. Holland's Iriſh bard ſings a wild ſong, and fabulous genealogy, in his native language: and afterwards fights with two fools, his proper equals and companions<note n="5" place="bottom">Ibid. 180, 181.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The character of RIMER, or poet, was as ſuperior to that of minſtrel, as the <hi>jugler</hi> was beneath it. In Holland's curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous production the <hi>juglour</hi> merely exhibits feats of manual magic; a view of hunting is followed by a ſea-fight: the king's cup is ſuddenly changed; a grey gooſe becomes a gold garland, ſand becomes ſilver; and the like experiments of common adepts<note n="6" place="bottom">Ib. 179. The vague appellations, and corrupt latinity, of the middle ages confound remote characters, as the minſtrel and jugler, &amp;c.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Yet the belief in real magic, and witchcraft, was now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent both in England and Scotland. The ducheſs of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter had been impriſoned as a witch<note n="7" place="bottom">In 1442: and ſee many writs in Rymer <hi>De ſortilegis capiendis.</hi>
                     </note>: and about thirty years after we find many witches and magicians condemned to the flames in Scotland, for conſpiring with Mar againſt the king's life. This new folly was to vegetate, and flouriſh, for near three centuries.</p>
                  <p>The manners of the great may be further illuſtrated from the Tales of the Prieſts of Peebles. One queſtion is, why the peers have ſo much degenerated from their anceſtors in vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, wiſdom, and valour? The anſwer is, that the royal offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of juſtice diminiſh the privileges of the lords, by indicting
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:0141700201:451"/>and fining their tenants for pretended crimes; ſo that the latter are reduced to poverty, and unable to arm themſelves properly to attend their maſters in war, or to pay their rents in peace. The peers in conſequence become poor themſelves, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to repleniſh their coffers by unworthy marriages with the opulent baſtard-daughters of prieſts, or heireſſes of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants; or by ſelling the right of marriage of their ſons to rich commoners<note n="8" place="bottom">Ut ſupra, p. 12, 13.</note>. But this ſatire rather refers to the artful avarice of James III; and ſeems to evince that a great cauſe of the conſpiracy of the peers was their impoveriſhment, occaſioned by his exactions on pretence of the adminiſtration of juſtice; which, as appears from the ſtatutes themſelves, was never in a worſe ſtate than under his reign.</p>
                  <p>The Dreſs of this period may beſt be illuſtrated from ſeveral ſtatutes on the ſubject. The following is of Auguſt 1455<note n="9" place="bottom">Cap. 47.</note>.</p>
                  <p>"Concerning the habits of the Earls, Lords of Parliament, Commiſſioners of Burghs, and Advocates, to be uſed in the parliament or general council, it is ordained,</p>
                  <p>"That all Earls ſhall uſe mantles of brown <hi>granit</hi> (or fine cloth,) open before, lined with white furr, and trimmed in front with ſame furring, of a hand's breadth and down to the belt; with little hoods of the ſame cloth, pendent on the ſhoulders.</p>
                  <p>"And the other Lords of Parliament ſhall have a mantle of red, open in like manner before, lined with ſilk, or furred with <hi>criſtie gray, griece,</hi> or <hi>purray,</hi> (ſome furs inferior to the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine worn by earls;) with a hood of the ſame cloth, furred as the lining.</p>
                  <p>"And all Commiſſioners of Burghs each to have a pair of clokes (a cloke) of blue cloth, furred to the feet, open on the
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:0141700201:452"/>right ſhoulder; the fur of proportional value; and a hood of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>"Whatever Earl, Lord of Parliament, or Commiſſioner of the Burghs, ſhall enter the parliament or general council, except dreſſed as above, ſhall inſtantly depoſit a fine of ten pounds to the king.</p>
                  <p>"In every burgh, where a parliament or general council is to be held, there ſhall be erected at the bar three tiers of benches, each higher than the other, for the commiſſioners of the burghs to ſit upon; under the penalty of ten pounds to be raiſed on the town where the parliament or general council ſhall be held.</p>
                  <p>"All men hired as fore-ſpeakers (or advocates) ſhall wear green habits, in the form of a ſhort tunic, <hi>(tunikil)</hi> the ſleeves to be open like thoſe of a tabard. Any advocate otherwiſe appearing before the parliament or general council, and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a reward, ſhall forfeit five pounds to the king."</p>
                  <p>The curioſity of this ſtatute may excuſe a few remarks. The brown <hi>granit,</hi> worn by the earls, was perhaps a tawny fine cloth, a colour faſhionable in this century, till it was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted by a brighter tint <hi>ſcarlet;</hi> a term correſponding to <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit,</hi> and applied by metonymy to the fineneſs of the cloth or to its colour. The common people, as has been already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, were allowed to wear on holidays light blue, green, or red; tartan being as yet little known or confined to the great: but the fineſt cloths appear to have been generally dyed tawny or ſcarlet; while purple and crimſon were tints almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to velvets, and ſilks, and appropriated to princes. May it not be inferred, from the particular order for ſeats to the commiſſioners of the burghs, either within or without the bar, for the expreſſion is dubious, that they were ſometimes obliged to ſtand in the preſence of the haughty clergy and ariſtocracy?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="438" facs="tcp:0141700201:453"/>In 1458 this act was confirmed; with the addition that the king ſhould order patterns of all the dreſſes to be made<note n="1" place="bottom">Cap. 68.</note>. The ſumptuary law of the ſame year has already been ſtated in the firſt ſection of this retroſpect: it permits the dignified or rich clergy to wear gowns of ſcarlet with coſtly furs.</p>
                  <p>James III in 1471 ordered that, conſidering the great penury of the realm, and the expence of importing ſilk, none ſhould wear it in doublets, gowns, or clokes, whoſe revenue was under one hundred pounds Scotiſh money in landed rent, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting knights, minſtrels, and heralds: and that women, whoſe huſbands came not within the above deſcriptions, ſhould not uſe ſilk in linings, but only in making the collar and ſleeves<note n="2" place="bottom">Cap. 46.</note>. The dreſs of this prince, and his queen, has been already deſcribed.</p>
                  <p>The gowns and mantles were ſometimes indecently ſhort at this period, as appears from a penalty impoſed by an Engliſh ſtatute of the twenty-ſecond year of Edward IV. The doublet and hoſe were long to remain in the ſame form: but ſhoes, more than ſix inches broad at the toes, began to ſucceed the other extreme of long peaks. Louis XI of France, 1461—1483, appears in thoſe broad ſhoes<note n="3" place="bottom">See Camden's Remains, art. Apparel: and Montſaucon Mon. de la mon. Fr.</note>.</p>
                  <p>On the 24th of June 1470 occurs a charter of the lands of Kilmarnoc, and others, forfeited by lord Boyd, to Margaret of Denmark, the queen, during her life, "for her robes, and to ſupply her with the ornaments of her head-dreſs<note n="4" place="bottom">Scotſt. Cal.</note>." Other minute particulars may be traced in the treaſurer's accompt for 1474, reprinted in the appendix. James Homel the king's taylor, and a favourite afterwards executed at Lauder bridge, has four elns of French black to make a long gown for the
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:0141700201:454"/>king, which is lined with ſuſtian. Hoſe of white cloth; ſhirts of fine holland; chamlet gowns, lined with lamb-ſkin; ſocks of white cloth; doublets and hoſe, lined with broad-cloth; a pair of ſpurs valued at four ſhillings; two elns of velvet to make two tippets, and furs to line them; a long mantle of velvet; a bonnet at fifteen ſhillings; and two hats at ten ſhillings each; a ſatin jacket lined with lamb-ſkin; grey cloth for <hi>long ſocks;</hi> black ſatin to cover a prayer-book; velvet for a <hi>cheſabel</hi> to his cloſet, and for his <hi>brigin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynis;</hi> knobs of gold for his ſaddle; a <hi>chymna</hi> or grate for his cloſet; ribbons for his doublet and ſleeves; pillows covered with broad-cloth; drugs from Flanders; an eln of ſcarlet for his petticoat; a gown of cloth of gold, lined with ſatin, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to an Engliſh herald who attended the embaſſy; gloves, <hi>muchis</hi> or caps; are among the articles provided for the king.</p>
                  <p>For the queen are pattens and corks; livery gowns lined with grey for ſix ladies of her chamber on a pilgrimage to Whithern; ſatin for her <hi>turrats;</hi> black cloth for a <hi>ſliding</hi> gown; velvet for another gown; leathern gloves; a cloke and <hi>capite bern</hi> of black, lined with Scotiſh cloth; eight elns of broad cloth to cover a bathing vat, and three for a ſheet to put around her while bathing; hoſe of black cloth; ſeven elns of crimſon ſatin for a kirtle, and to cover bonnets <hi>of tire;</hi> a grate for her cloſet; <hi>band-leather</hi> for furring her gloves; five elns of <hi>criſty gray,</hi> at thirty ſhillings the eln, to line a gown of black damaſk; blue velvet to cover her ſtirrup-irons; half an eln of <hi>double tartan</hi> to line her riding collars; ſatin for tippets and collars; ſeven pounds for more than a year's ſhoes; ſatin for ſtomachers, and ermine to line them; twenty-ſix <hi>beſtes of grece</hi> to line a tippet; ten pounds thirteen ſhillings and four pence "for a maſs-book to her altar, at her command, by captain John Cat," who probably brought it from Flanders.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="440" facs="tcp:0141700201:455"/>The chief articles for the prince, then a babe of two years, are ſhirts and caps of holland cloth; coats of brown lined with white cloth, and ſome of the latter for his cradle; fine broad cloth for his ſheets, or rather blankets; white hoſe and petti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coats, and lawn caps; French brown cloth, and tartan with buckram-binding for his cradle; Engliſh ruſſet for a gown to his nurſe; white fuſtian for blankets, and broad cloth for ſheets; a coat of ſatin, and a gown of cloth of gold, lined with blue tartan.</p>
                  <p>Theſe minute particulars will be excuſed, as they contribute more to illuſtrate the ſtate of manners, and dreſs, than the moſt elaborate diſquiſition.</p>

Withall the Kyng beyng preſent yn his ſaid cowneſell, roſe up with a maneli ſwollon hart a knyght, clepid Sir Robert Grame, a grete gentilman and an Erles ſune, a mane of grete wit and eloquence, wundir futtilye wittyd, and expert in the lawe: ſaying thes wordes opynly to the Lordes, <q>Sirs, yf ye woll firmely ſtand by that at I ſhall ſay to the Kyng, yn youre audience, I truſt to God that we ſhall fynde a good remedye and helpe.</q> To the which ſayng the Lordes co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentid: and ſaide that they truſtyng holly yn his prudent and diſcret manchode, wold conforme and conſent, yn hie and low, to mayntene all that he wold tak on hand to ſay, for the general weele of hem, and of all that land, yn that mater by hym than mevid.</p>
               <p>Upon this the Kyng lete to ſomond a parliament of the iii aſtatis of his rewme, where this ſame Sir Robert Grame, fully ſette and aſurid and purpoſid to performe that at he had behight and promyſid unto the Lordes, as is afore reherſid. He roſe upe with a grete corage, with a violent chere and countenance, ſette handes upon the Kyng ſayng thes wordes, <q>I arreſt you yn the name of all the thre aſtates of your reume, here now aſſemblid yn this preſent parliament, for right as youre liege people be bundun and ſworne to obeye your Majeſte noble riall, yn the ſame wiſe bene ye ſworne and enſurid to kepe youre peple, to kepe and guverne youre lawe, ſo that ye do hem no wronge, bot yn all right mantene and defend hem.</q> And there and then forthwith the ſaid Sir Robert Grame, aſuryng hym fully yn the promyſe made unto hym bi the ſaid Lordes, ſaid, "Is hit nat thus as I ſay?" Unto the which ſayng none of all the aſtates afore reherſid wold, ne durſt ſpeke oone word, bot kapid ſilence. The Kyng therwith percevyng all this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous rebellion, and wirchyng of the ſaid Sir Robert Grame, gretly movyd and ſtirryd ayenſt him, as that reaſon wold, lete do hym arreſt, and commandid to put hym yn ſure and hard priſone.</p>
               <p>This Sir Robert Grame, ſeyng hymſelf thus deſavyd there of the ſaid Lordes, ſpake and ſaid yn this wiſe, "He that ſerveth a comon mane, he ſerveth by ſhort proceſe of tyme." After this the Kynge exiled this Sir Robert Grame; and all his haritages and goodes deemed as forfaturs to the Kyng.</p>
               <p>Upon his exile this Sir Robert Grame toke his [way] ynto the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treis of the Wild Scottis, wherthat he conſpired and ymagynd how that he myght deſtruye his Kyng. And furthwith he renounſed his lege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and by wordes, and by writyng, he defied hem, ſeying that he had deſtruyd hym, his wif, and his childerne, his haritages, and all his other godes, by his cruell tyranny. Wherfor he ſaid he wold ſlee hym [with] his owne handes as his mortall enmye, yf wer he myght ſe tyme, and fynd wais and meanes. Therto the Kyng, hugely vexid in his ſpretes with the traturous and malicious rebellion of the ſaid Sir
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:0141700201:480"/>Robert Grame, did mak an opyn proclamacion by all the rewme of Scotteland that whoſo myght ſlee or tak hyme, and bryng hym to the Kynges preſence, ſhuld have iii thouſand demyes of gold, every pece worth half an Englisſh Noble.</p>
               <p>Nocht long after this the Kyng lete ſo ordeyne his parliament yn due forme, at Edenbourghe, ſomunde yn the yere of oure lord A Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, Foure Hundreth, Six and Thirtye, yn the feſt of All Hallowen. To the which parliament the ſaid Sir Robert Grame ſtired a full cruell vengance ayene the Kyng, ſent privie meſſages and letturs to certayne men and ſervantes of the Duke of Albayne, whome the Kyng a litill afore hade done rigoruſly to deth, lich as hit is entitild here afore, opynly, that if thay conſent and faver hym, he wold uttirly take upon hym for to ſlee the Kyng, leſt thurgh his tirannye and covetiſe he wold deſtruy this reume of Scotteland: and the corone of the land ſhall be yovon to Sir Robert Stuard, which is the Kyng's coſyn, and next of the right of the corone, bot yf the Kyng had a ſune; the ſame Robert's fadir thenne liggyng in hoſtage to the Kyng of England, for the ſaid James Kyng of Scottes, yn the towre of London, till that his fynaunce were fully content and paid. And the ſaid Sir Robert's granteſire, the Erle of Athetelles, of that treiſon and counſell as hit was ſaid; and by hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſecretly deſirid and covetid to have the corone. For which cauſes the ſame Sir Robert Grame was half the better conſentid to bryng thaire purpos to effecte. For this Sir Robert Stuard did ever abide yn the kynges preſence, full famulier aboute hyme at all houres, and moſt privey above all other; and was a full gentill ſquyer, fresſh, luſty, and right amyable. Whome the Kyng entierly loved as his owne ſone; and for the tendure love that he had to hyme he made [hym] Conſtable of all his hoſt, and . . . . at the ſege of Edenbourgh<note n="*" place="bottom">Sic. Roxburgh.</note>.</p>
               <p>After this the Kyng ſodanly aviſid made a ſolempne feſt of the Criſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynmes at Perth, which is clepid Sant Johns towne, which is from Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourgh on that other ſide of the Scotteſh See, the which is vulgarly clepid the Water of Lethe. Yn the myddis of the way thare aroſe a woman of Yreland, that clepid herſelfe as a ſuthſayer. The which anone as ſhe ſaw the Kyng, ſhe cried with lowde voiſe, ſayng thus, "My Lord Kyng, and ye paſe this water, ye ſhall never turne ayane on lyve." The Kyng heryng this was aſtonyed of her wordis; for bot a litill to fore he had red yn a propheſie, that yn the ſelfe ſame yere the Kyng of Scottes ſhuld be ſlayne. And therwithall the Kyng as he rode clepid to him oone of his knyghtis, and gave hym yn co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundment to torne ayane to ſpeke with that woman, and aſk of here what ſheo wold, and what thyng ſheo ment with her lowd cryyng? And ſheo began, and told hym as ye hafe hard of the Kynge of Scottes, yf
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:0141700201:481"/>he paſſed that water. As now the kynge aſkid her how ſheo knew that? And ſheo ſaid that Huthart told her ſo. "ſire," quod ho, <q>men may calant y tak non hede of yond womans wordes, for ſheo nys bot a drunkine fule, and wot not what ſheo ſaith.</q> And ſo with his folk paſſid the water, clepid the Scottiſſhe See, toward Saynt Johnnes towne, bott iiii myles from the cuntreth of the Wild Scottes; where, yn a cloſe of Blakfriars withowt the ſaid towne, the kyng held a gret feſt.</p>
               <p>Where upon a day, as the Kyng plaid at the cheſſes with oone of his knyghtis, whome yn playng wiſe he clepid Kyng of Love, for he was a luſti man, full amorous, and much medeled hym with loves' arte. And as hit came the Kyng to mynd of the prophecie ſpokyne tofore, the Kyng ſaid to this knyght, "Sir Kyng of Love," quod he, <q>hit is nat long agone fith I redd a prophecie, ſpokyne of tofore, that I ſaw how that his yere ſhuld a kyng be ſlayne yn this land. And ye wote wele Sir Alexander, there be no mo kynges yn this reume bot ye and I; and therfor I cowneſell you that ye be well ware, for I let you wit that I ſhall ordeyne for my ſure kepyng ſufficiently, I truſt to God, ſo I am undir youre kynghood and yn the ſervice of Love.</q> And thus the Kyng yn his ſolas plaid with the knyght.</p>
               <p>Withyn ſhort tyme after this, the Kyng beyng in his chambur, talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng and playng with the Lordes, knyghtis, and ſquyers, that were abowte hyme, ſpak of many dyvers maters. Amonges was ther a ſquyer that was right acceptable to the Kyng, that ſpeke, and ſaid, "For ſothe My Lord," quod he, <q>me dremed varelye to nyght that Sir Robert Grame ſhuld hafe ſlayne you.</q> And that heryng the Erle of Orkeney thoo warnyd the ſquyer, that he ſhuld hald his peace, and tell nane ſuch tales yn the Kynges preſence. And therwith the Kyng herying this ſquyers dreme, remembred hymſelfe how that ſame nyght how<note n="*" place="bottom">Heo?</note> had a ſweyvyn ſlepyng; and ſemyd to hym varaly that a cruell ſerpent, and an horribill tode, aſſailid hym furiouſly yn his kynges-chambur; and how he was ſore afright and aferd of hym, and that he had nothyng wherwith he myght ſocoure and defend hymſelfe, bot oonly a paire of tanges that ſtudyn yn the chymneth.</p>
               <p>And many other tokyns, and tailes, liche to this, the which now may well be demyd by varay demonſtracions, and alſo pronoſticacions to the Kyng, of his deth and murdur, had he or the tyme of his deth fell. Alſo oone of kynges traitours, clepid Criſtofere Chawmebur, that was a ſquyer of the Dukes hous of Albayne, iii tymes he drugh hym to the Kynges preſence, for he wold haf playnely opynd, and told hym of the purpos of all the traitours, that wer aboute to murdure hyme, bycauſe that the Kyng withowt any cauſe hatid hym rightfully<note n="†" place="bottom">This, and ſeveral other ſentences, are moſt obſcurely expreſſed.</note>.
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:0141700201:482"/>And thus, as hit is ſaid by the old wiſe fadirs, many years or we were borne, what thyng that deſtyned to a perſon, be hit late be hit ſone, at the laſt ever hit cumyth.</p>
               <p>Thus, after this, cane faſt apporoch the nyght, yn the which the ſaid James Stward kyng of Scottes ſhuld falſely hym unwittyng, ſuffure his horribill deth by murdure; this which is pite that any gentill or gode man to thynk upon. ſo both afore ſoper, and long aftire ynto quarter of the nyght, in the which the Erle of Athetelles, and Robert Stward, were aboute the Kyng; where thay wer occupied att the playng of the cheſſe, att the tables, yn redyng of Romans, yn ſyngyng, and pypyng, yn harpyng; and in other honeſt ſolaces, of grete pleaſance and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. Therwith came the ſaid woman of Yreland, that clepid herſelf a dyvenoureſe, and entred the Kynges courte, till that ſhe came ſtreght to the Kynges chambur dore, where ſheo ſtood, and abode by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that hit was ſhitte. And faſt ſheo knokyd till at the laſt the usſher opyng the dure; marvelyng of that woman's beyng there that tyme of the nyght, and aſkyng here what ſheo wold? <q>Let me yn Sire,</q> quod ſheo, <q>for I haf ſumwhat to ſay, and to tell unto the Kyng; for I am the ſame woman that noght long agone deſirid to haf ſpokyn with hym, at the Lith, whan he ſhuld paſſe the Scottiſh See.</q> The usſher went yn, and told hym of this woman. "Yea," quod the Kyng, "let hir cume to morrow:" bycauſe that he was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied with ſuche diſportes at that tyme, hym lit not to entend her as henne. The usſher came ayane to the chamber dore, to the ſaid woman; and there he told hir that the Kyng was beſye in playng; and bid her cum ſoo ayane upon the morow. "Well," ſaid the woman, <q>hit ſhall repent yow all, that ye wil nat let me ſpeke nowe with the Kyng.</q> Therat the usſher lughe, and held her bot a fule, chargyng her to go her way. And therwithall ſheo went thens.</p>
               <p>Withyn an owre the Kyng aſkid the voidee, and drank, the travers yn the chambure edraw, and every man depairtid and went to riſt. Than Robert Stward, that was right famylier with the Kyng, and had all his commandementes yn the chamber, was the laft that departid; and he knewe well the falſe purveid theiſon, and was conſentid therto, and therfore left the Kynges chamburs doore opyne; and had bruſſed and blundird the lokes of hem, yn ſuch wiſe that no man myght ſhute hem. And abowt mydnyght he laid certayne plaunches, and hurdelles, over the diches of the diche that environd the gardyne of the chambure, upon which the ſaid traitours entred. That is to ſay the forſaid Sir Robert Grame, with other of his covyne ynto the nowmbre of Thre Hundreth perſons; the Kyng that ſame tyme ther ſtondyng in his nyght gowne, all unclothid ſave his ſhirt, his cape, his combe, his coverchif, his furrid pynſons<note n="*" place="bottom">Slippers.</note> upon the forme, and the foote ſheet; ſo ſtondyng

               <p>But he harkynd, and hard grete noiſe without, and grete clateryng of harnych, and men armyd, with grete ſight of torches. Than he remembred hym, and ymagynd anone that hit ſhuld be [the] falſe tratours knyght, his deedy enemy, Sir Robert Grame. And ſodenly the Qwene, with all the other ladis and gentilwomen, rane to the chawmber dure, and fonde hit opyne; and thay wold have ſhitt hit, bot the lokes wer ſo blundrid, that thay nethir cowth ne myght ſhut hit. The Kyng prayd hem to kepe the ſame dore as wele as thay myght, and he wold do all his myght to kept hym to withſtond the falſe malice of his traitours and enmys; he ſuppoiſyng to have breſtyn the farrements of the chaumbur wyndos, bot thay wer ſo ſqware, and ſtrongli ſowdid yn the ſtonys with moltyne lede, that thay myght not be broſtyne for hym, withowtyn more and ſtrenger helpe. For which cauſe he was ugly aſtonyed, and in hys mynd kouth thynk on none other ſocoure, bot ſtart to the chymney, and toke the tonges of yren that men rightid the fire with, yn tyme of neede; and undir his fete he myghtily breſt up a plaunch of the chaumbur flore, and therwithall cuverid hym ayane, and entred adowne lowe beneth amongis th' ordure of the privay, that was all of hard ſtone, and none wyndow ne isſhue therupon, ſave a litill ſquare hole, even at the ſide of the bothum of the pryvay, that at the makyng therof old tyme was levid opyne to clenſe and ferme the ſaid privay.

The traitours withowt laid at the chaum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bur dors, and at the privay dore alſo, with wawis, with levours, and with axes, that at the laſt thay brak up all, and entred, (bycauſe the durs were not faſt ſhutte,) with ſwerdes, axis, glavis, billes, and other terribill and ferefull wepons. Amonges the grete preſe of the which traitours, ther was a faire lady ſore hurt yn the bak; and other gentil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wemen hurt and ſore wondid. With the which the ladis, and all the wemen, mayd a ſorowfull ſkrye, and rane away for the hidos fere of tho boiſtous and merciles men of armes. The traitours furiouſly paſſed forth ynto the chaumbures, and founde the Qwene ſo diſmaid and abaſſid of that horribill and ferfull guvernance, that ſhe cowth nether ſpeke, ne withdrawe here. And as ſho ſtode ther ſo aſtonyd, as a cryature that had loſt here kyndly reaſon, oone of the traitours wowndid here

Sheo is bot a womane. Let us go and ſech the Kyng.</q> And then not wityng wele what ſheo did, or ſhuld do, for that ferfull and terribill affray, fledd yn hir kirtill, her mantell hangyng aboute hir; the other ladyes yn a corner of the chaumbur, cryyng and wepyng, all diſtraite made a pitous and lamentable noſe with full hevy lokyng and chere.</p>
               <p>And ther the traitours ſought the Kyng yn all the chaumbur abowte, yn the withdrawyng chaumburs, yn the litters, undir the preſſes, the fourmes, the chares, and all other places, bot long they beſily ſought the Kyng. Bot they couth nat fynd hym, for they nether knew ne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred the privay. The Kyng heryng of long tyme no noyſe, ne ſtiryng of the traitours, wende and demyd that thay had all begone, cryed to the wemen that they ſhuld cume with ſhettes, and drawe hym up owt of that uncleyne place of the privay. The wemen at his callyng came faſt to the pryvay dore, that was nat ſhutt, and ſo tha opynd hit with labure. And as they were abowteward to helpe upe the Kyng, oone of the ladis, clepid Elizabeth Douglas, fell ynto the pryvay to the Kyng. Therwith oone of the ſaid traitours, called Robert<note n="*" place="bottom">Sic.</note> Chaum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bur, ſuppoiſid varaly ſith thay couth nat fynd, yn none of all the ſayd chaumburs, the Kyng, that he of neſſeſſite had hyd hym yn the pryvay. And therefore he ſaid to his felawes, "Sirs" quod he, <q>wherto ſtond we thus idill, and leſe owre tyme, as for the cauſe that we be cumne forehid? Cumith on furth with me, and I ſhall redily tell you wher the Kyng is.</q> For the ſame Thomas<note n="*" place="bottom">Sic.</note> Chaumbur had bene afore right familier with the Kyng yn all places; and therfore knewe he wele all the pryvay corners of thoo chaumburs. And ſo he went forth ſtreght to the ſame pryvay where the Kyng was, and perſavyd wele an ſawe how a plaunch of the flure was brokyn up, and lift hit up, and with a torch lokyd ynne, and ſaw the Kyng ther, and a woman with hyme. Sayng to his felows, <q>Sirs the ſpows is foundon, wherfore we bene cumne, and all this nyght haf carold here.</q> Therwithall oone of the ſaid tirantes and traitours, clepid Sir John Hall, deſcendid downe to the Kyng, with a grete knyf yn his hand; and the Kyng, dowtyng hym ſore of his lif, kaught hym myghtily by the ſhuldurs, and with full grete violence caſt hym under his fete. For the Kyng was, of his parſone and ſtature, a mane right manly ſtrong. And ſeyyng another of that Hallis brethyrne that the Kyng had the betture of hym, went downe ynto the pryvay alſo, for to deſtroy the Kyng. And anone as he was ther deſcendid, the Kyng kaught hym manly by the nek, and caſt hym above that other; and ſo he defowlid hem both

And gretely the Kyng ſtrogild with hem, for to have berevyd thame thare knyvys; by the which labur his handis wer all forkute. Bot and the Kyng had bene yn any wiſe armyd, he myght well have eſcapid thare malice, by the lengthe of his fightyng with thoo ii falſe traitours. For, yf the Kyng myght any while lengar have ſavyd hymſlefe, his ſervantes, and much other peple of the towne, by ſume fortune ſhuld haf had ſume knaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clege therof, and ſoo haf cumne to his ſocoure helpe. Bot, ellas the while, hit wol not be! Fortune was to hym adverſe, as yn preſerwyng of his life any longer.</p>
               <p>Therwithall that odyus and falſe traitour Sir Robert Grame, ſeyng the Kyng labord ſo ſore with thoo two falſe traitours, which he had caſt undir his fete, and that he wer faynt and wery, and that he was we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poneleſe, the more pite was, deſcenden downe alſo ynto the pryvey to the Kyng, with an horribill and mortall wepone yn his hand. And then the Kyng cried hym mercy. "Thow cruell tirant," quod Grame to hym, <q>thou hadeſt nevyr mercy of lordes borne of thy blode, ne of non other gentilman, that came yn thy dawnger. Therfor no mercy ſhalt thow have here.</q> Thane ſaid the Kyng, <q>I beſech the that, for the ſalvacion of my ſoule, ye woll let me have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſore.</q> Quod the ſaid Grame, <q>Thow ſhalt never have other confeſſore bot this ſame ſwerd.</q> And therwithall he ſmote hym thorogh the body, and therwithall the goode kyng fell downe and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentablé with a pitous voyce he cried hym oft mercy, and behight to gyf hym half hys kyngdam, and much other good, to ſave his lif. And then the ſaid Grame, ſeyng his Kyng and Soveran Lord ynfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned with ſo much deſeyſe, angweſh, and ſorowe, wold hafe ſo levyd, and done hym no more harme. The other traitors above, perceyvyng that, ſayd onto the ſayd Sir Robert, <q>We behote the faithfully, bot yf thow fle hym, or thow depart, thow ſhalt dye for hym on owre handys ſone dowtleſe.</q> And then the ſaid Sir Robert, with the other two that deſcendid firſt downe, fell upon that noble prynce, and yn full horribill and cruell wiſe they murdrid hym. Ellas for ſorow, that ſo ynmefurably cruelte and vengance ſhuld be done to that worthy prynce, fer hit was reportid by true perſons that ſawe hym dede, that he had ſixtene dedely woundes yn his breſte, withowtyn many and other y dyverſe places of his body.</p>

The ſaid Sir Robert Grame ſtondyng there, at the wher he was tofore enditid of treiſon afore the Juſtice and the lawe there, upon his araynment, ſaid playnely that thay had no lawe to do hym to deth, for he ſaid he had nat offendit, bot ſlayne the Kyng his dedely enmye; for by his letturs, ſealed with his ſeale of armes, long tyme afore he had defyed the Kyng, and renouncid his legeaunce, for cauſes reaſonables as he ſaid. And yf thay wold do hym lawe after the ſtatuytes of armes, thay ſhuld delyver hym, and let hym go qwite, bicauſe the Kyng wold have deſtruyd hym yf he had myght.

               <p>All thes thynges the ſaid Sir Robert Grame, with many other yn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenyences, he reherſid there ayanſt the Kyng; the whiche reher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſale wole be ynne Scotteland many a yere here after. For he was a mane of grete hart and manhode, and full diſcrete, and a grete legiſter of lawe poſitive, and canone, and civlle bothe. Yit for all that, at the laſt he was dampned there by the Juges of the deth. This was the ſentance of the jugesment there ſhuld be brought a cart, yn the mydward of the whiche there ſhuld be ſette faſt a tree uperight, longer then a mane; and with that ſame knyf that he ſloughe the Kyng with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, was his hand all upon heghe nalid faſt to that tree, and ſo was he

After that he was nalid nakynd, as he was firſt borne of his modir, drawen thurghe the towne withowte coerture of any parte of his body, as nature brought hym forth from his modirs wombe, and yn the ſame wiſe ladd thorgh all the ſtretes of that towne; and the tourmentours on every ſide hym, withe hookid ynſtrumentes of yryne, fuyre hote all red glowyng, thay pynchid and twynched his theghis, his legges, his armes, his ſides, his bake, his ſhuldurs, his neke, his wombe, and over all his body, that was full ſeke and pitous to loke upon, wher thay ſuppoiſid moſt to anoye hyme and greve, that hit was to any mans kynd to ſorofull and pitous ſight, and to abhomynable to ſe. With the ymportible payne of turment, he cried then pitouſly withe dedely voice, for the panys and paſions that he ſo ſuffird, ſayng to them that thay did that duriſe to hym ayenſt the lawe; <q>this that ye done to me is oonly by rigoure of ynmeſurable tyrannye.

               <p>In the meane tyme many of the other traitours were boweld all qwik, and afterward were quarterd, as wele thay that receyvid the ſaid Sir Robert, as thay that were with hym. Whane the exſecution of the ſaid traiſon was done, and many of tha that were with hym att the day of the Kyng confeſſid, whane thay were ſpokyne to go with the ſaid Sir Robert Grame, hit was not told unto hym of no purpos that was ſaid unto hem that thay ſhuld go with hym, to ravisſhe a faire lady oute of the Kynges houſe, whame the ſaid Sir Robert Stuward ſhuld have weddid the next day folowyng.</p>
               <p>And after this thay ladd aftſounes the ſaid Sir Robert Grame to the place where he ſhuld dye. And ſodeynely thay droughe away the mantall, to the which all his woundes were hardyned, and clave faſt with his blode dried therto; forwith the ſaid payne he fele downe yn a ſwonyng, and ſo lay along on the ground more than a quarter of an owre.

And after this, for the more grefe and ſorow to hyme, thay boweld his ſonne all quyke, and quarterd. hym afor his eene, and drewe owt his hart of his body: the which harte lepe thriſe more than a fote of heghte, after hit was drawen owte of his body: and yn ſemblable wiſe the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane droughe owte all his bowelles, and quarterd hym, and many other moo after hyme.</p>
               <p>Bot the laſt of all Thomas Halle was hedid; for as hit was knawen and veraly wiſt by proof he was the pryncipall and the fynell cauſe of the Kynges deth.

                  <head>Art. I. Curſory View of the State of the Records of Scotland, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to John Pinkerton, Eſq 5 July, 1796<note n="*" place="bottom">This paper, by a William Anderſon <hi>writer</hi> or attorney in Edinburgh, imperfect as it is, may give the reader ſome idea of the ſubject. Of the curious and important Chamberlain's Rolls Mr. A. obſerves, "independent of their being in much diſorder, they are covered with duſt, I might almoſt ſay buried in it." And after the expenſive erection of that ſplendid edifice, the new Regiſter Office, the following remark may ſurprize. "It is a great pity that ſuch a valuable Collection of Records ſhould, in a manner, be rendered entirely uſeleſs to the public, by the expence attending the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection of them, by the ſtate in which they are kept, and by the want of a ſmall fund, to recompenſe the perſon who would undertake to examine them with attention." The expence indeed is enormous, to judge from this attorney's bill, which exceeded Twelve Pounds, (not Scotiſh money but ſterling,) for a trifling labour, which in England would have been held richly recompenſed by three or four guineas.
<p>As the importance of national records is extreme, there ought to be in every country a literary inſpector of the records, independent of the juridical arrangement, to attend to the preſervation of the more ancient, and publiſh curious extracts.</p>

                     <head>RECORDS OF PARLIAMENT.</head>
                     <p>THE oldeſt volumes of the Parliamentary Record are in a ſtate ſo frail, from the waſte of time, and want of proper care, that, unleſs the utmoſt attention is paid in turning over the folios, parts of them are apt to be loſt by the operation. About five years ago, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined every leaf of the three or four firſt volumes; but ſince that time the Keepers, by the deſire of the Lord Clerk Regiſter, prevent them from being handled: and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. William Robertſon is at preſent employed in making an Accurate Copy of them, that they may not be entirely loſt.</p>
                     <p>The firſt three Books of the Parliamentary Record are bound up in one Volume. The two firſt of theſe Books, which contain a part of the Regiam Majeſtatem, and Acts of Robert III, James I, II, III, are not original, but have been copied in 1487. The Genuine Records
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:0141700201:523"/>of the Scots Parliament commence with the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Book of this Volume, in the Reign of James III, Anno 1466, and go down to the year 1474. From this period, to the diſſolution of the Scots Parliament by the Union of the Kingdoms, the Record appears to be pretty entire. There are in all thirty ſix Books, bound up in twenty ſix volumes, all written on good paper and well bound. Of theſe however the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Book, which muſt have contained ſome proceedings of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the minority of James VI, is miſſing.</p>
                     <p>In the general Regiſter Houſe there are also preſerved ſeveral bundles of <hi>Looſe Parliamentary Records;</hi> for inſtance Commiſſions to Parliament in laſt Century, and debates in Diſputed Elections, &amp;c. Beſides the volumes above-mentioned there are ſome <hi>Decreets of Forfeiture</hi> in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, in Annis 1685, &amp; 1690—5.</p>
                     <p>There are alſo ſeveral <hi>Records of the Committee of Eſtates,</hi> during the Common-wealth and Protectorate: but for want of binding, their Condition is ſo bad, that they cannot be properly looked into.</p>

                     <p>The oldeſt Record of Charters, &amp;c. paſſing the Great Seal, which is now known to exiſt, is a Roll of Robert I, about the 1316<note n="*" place="bottom">A Scoticiſm for the <hi>year</hi> 1316.</note>. There are, as I am informed, twelve of theſe Rolls, ſome of which have only about twenty, others one hundred and twenty charters. They are all written on parchment: and the Charters they contain are granted by Robert I, David II, Robert II, and III.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Book of this Record is bound in red turkey; and contains about three hundred and twenty charters: ſome of them granted by David II, from the 33<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, to the 41<hi rend="sup">st</hi>, year of his reign, and others granted by Robert II.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond volume contains charters granted by King James I; but the Record of very ſew of his Charters has been preſerved. It alſo appears that the greateſt part of the Charters by James II, and III,
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:0141700201:524"/>have been loſt. Thoſe granted by James IV, on the contrary, ſeem to be complete; for there are Regiſtred Charters, which have been granted in every year of his long reign, which is far from being the caſe with thoſe of his predeceſſors. A good many alſo of thoſe granted by James V have periſhed. Queen Mary's ſeem to be tolerably entire; and from the reign of James VI downwards, it is thought the whole are extant.</p>

                     <p>The Privy Seal Record, in the General Regiſter Houſe, conſiſts of about 116 volumes. It begins in the year 1499; and ends about the middle of laſt century.</p>
                     <p>This Record is a great repertorium of curioſity; and from this ſource the accurate narrator of facts in hiſtory might reap ſuperior ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, as almoſt every tranſaction within the kingdom, worthy of the ſmalleſt notice, was in thoſe times the object of a Royal Letter. Every improvement in ſcience, every invention tending to comfort or utility, was made the ſubject of a patent under the Privy Seal, ſo that by the Inveſtigation of this Record the introduction of many of the arts into this kingdom, ſuch as printing, &amp;c. might be clearly aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>

                     <p>By Decreet of the Court of Seſſion, the Record of Charters paſſing the Great Seal was ſeveral years ago removed from this Office, and placed under the Charge of the Meſſ<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>. Robertſons.</p>

                  <head>Art. II. Extract from The Caſe of Sir James Johnſtone of Weſterhall, Baronet, claiming the Titles, Honours and Dignities of Marquis of Annandale, &amp;c. Preſented to the Houſe of Lords, 1794.</head>
                  <p>Reſpecting the preſent State of the Public Records of Scotland.</p>
                  <p>Before ſtating the Evidence concerning the Relation of Matthew, the firſt of the Claimant's Line, to the Family of Annandale, it is proper to obſerve, that although the Records of Scotland, in ſo far as concerns Charters, Saſines, and Retours, are now very regularly kept; yet it was not till the year 1617 that an act paſſed, appointing a Public Regiſter to be kept for all Saſines, Reverſions, &amp;c. and declaring the ſame to be ineffectual againſt third parties, unleſs recorded therein, within 60 days.</p>
                  <p>And with reſpect to the Regiſter of Retours, it was not the practice in more ancient times to lodge them in chancery, they remained in the hands of the private parties; and the firſt Retour appearing in the Records of Chancery is dated 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> February 1547; but there were many Retours expede after that period, which do not appear in theſe Records.</p>
                  <p>The Records of the Great Seal, in which Charters were inſerted, were more regularly kept, but it frequently happened that the Parties carried away their Charters, before they were entered in the Record; and though they ſometimes brought them back afterwards to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, yet very often they did not, and the time of bringing them back was various; ſo that Charters are not always recorded in the Books according to their dates, but thoſe of a prior date are frequently inſerted after thoſe of a poſterior date.</p>
                  <p>It is material in the preſent Caſe to obſerve, that the Book, which has been numbered IV, of the Records of Charters, ends with a Charter dated the 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> June 1452, and the Book now numbered V, begins with a Charter, dated the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Auguſt 1458; ſo that a part of the Records has been loſt, as there is an interval of ſix years, in which no Book now exiſts, in which Charters are found recorded. A few are found in Book V. which though dated during that interval, are inſerted among
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:0141700201:527"/>poſterior Charters; but only two of theſe are dated preceding January 1458, one dated 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> October 1456, and another dated 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> December that year.</p>
                  <p>It was only by an act 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> July 1672, that a Regulation was made appointing all Charters, &amp;c. which paſs the Great and Privy Seal, to be regiſtered in the Regiſters of theſe Seals before the Seals be appended to them, and ſuch Regiſtration to be marked thereon by the writers to the different Seals.</p>
                  <p>The Privy Seal Records are not preſerved of an older date than 1499.</p>
                  <p>The Signet, properly ſpeaking, has no Record. It is the place where the Original Signatures or Warrants of Charters ought to be depoſited, but none of theſe are to be found prior to 1607; and theſe Signatures often remained in the private Cuſtody of the Keeper of the Signet, and paſſing to his Repreſentatives, were generally loſt.</p>
                  <p>The Record of Saſines begins in 1617, in terms of the act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament before referred to.</p>
                  <p>The Records of Parliament are very imperfect, and many Books are wanting, particularly about the period of 1455.</p>
                  <p>The Records of the Privy Council, are not preſerved further back than 1545, and ſubſequent to that year many intermediate Books are wanting.</p>
                  <p>The Record of Signatures in Exchequer begin in 1661, and although ſome of an older date are preſerved, yet they are few in number.</p>
                  <p>This imperfect ſtate of the Records, is partly to be aſcribed to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence; but it is alſo certain, that a great part of the ancient Records of Scodand, were carried to England by Oliver Cromwell; and it is ſtated in the Report of the Court of Seſſion to your Lordſhips, 27th February 1740, that when the Regiſters, which had been carried to England during the uſurpation, were ſent back to Scotland by Sea after the Reſtoration, no leſs than Eighty five hogſheads, which in a Storm were taken out of the Eagle Frigate, and put into another veſſel, were all of them loſt by the wreck of that veſſel.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to ancient Deeds in the hands of private Individuals, beſides the Loſs of many in the Calamities of War and Domeſtic Commotions, and by various other Cauſes which prevent the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Private Papers, it became leſs and object in Scotland to preſerve old Deeds and writings after the Act of Parliament had paſſed in the year 1617, by which it was declared that 40 years undiſturbed poſſeſſion, upon a Charter and Saſine, ſhould be held as a complete right to Lands, unleſs in certain caſes excepted.</p>
                  <p>The greateſt deficiency of the Records of Charters and Saſines and Retours, is found to be in thoſe prior to the year 1500.</p>
