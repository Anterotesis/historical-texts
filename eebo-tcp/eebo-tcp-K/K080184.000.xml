            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I WAS not initiated in the Science of Animal Electricity and Magnetiſm, until I was introduced to the Auguſtin Convent at Paris, where the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Father Harvier, attended daily a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of patients, of every rank and degree, gratis. I was inſtantly ſtruck with aſtoniſhment by the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netical Somnambuliſm, which I ſaw conſtantly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming before crouds of the moſt reſpectable and dignified clergy, who aſſembled every day, all of whom were thoroughly convinced that the art was practiſed by men of integrity, without any deceit. I was ſoon after preſented to the famous and learned Marquis de Puyſegur, and to ſeveral other noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, diſtinguiſhed in the literary world; who took delight in ſhewing thoſe phenomena to their friends. Scarcely had I acquired a knowledge of the ſcience, before I put one perſon in a ſtate of Somnambuliſm, which made me exult on the ſucceſs, as my tutors in the ſcience were preſent, viz. General Meziere, Chevalier Juſtamond, who encouraged me to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere. I na little time I produced numbers, who in that ſtate anſwered my queſtions; found out the diſeaſes of the people preſent, and preſcribed infallible cures for them; they are called Malade Medecin, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning whom I ſhall ſpeak at large, in my Treatiſe upon the Doctrine of Somnambuliſm.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0328100200:4"/>
            <p>That it is practicable to put certain perſons into this ſtate, need be no longer doubted, without touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or giving them any previous operation. It is a matter ſtrange to perſons unacquainted with the ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but that will vaniſh when the mind receives inſtruction and becomes familiar with it; in order to the attainment of which, I invite all perſons of every ſex, rank and degree, to come, ſee, and judge for themſelves. I ſhall ſoon publiſh one Number on Theory, and another on the Practice.</p>

            <head>AN ESSAY ON THE PROBABILITIES OF Electrical and Magnetical Somnambules, OR SLEEP-WALKERS.</head>
            <p>OF all the novelties which are created by Animal Electricity and Magnetiſm, Somnambuliſm is, doubtleſs, the moſt intereſting.</p>
            <p>By Somnambuliſm is meant that peculiar ſtate when the ſenſes are ſuſpended between ſleeping and waking; partak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of both, and is alſo productive of many phoenomena, which each are ſtrangers to.</p>
            <p>The patient being reduced to a ſtate of Somnambuliſm, without touching him, is deaf to all that is near him: Motionleſs amidſt the greateſt motions; he ſeems ſeparated from nature, as if it were, to communicate only with the perſon who put him into that ſtate.</p>
            <p>The latter, owing to Magnetiſation alone, has an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate analogy with the patient; by the means of a kind of an inviſible leaver, he cauſes him to move at his pleaſure; and ſuch is the power of his influence, that he not only makes himſelf underſtood by ſpeaking and ſigns, but even by the very thought itſelf; and what is ſtill more extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, the Magnetiſer can, by a ſingle contract, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0328100200:6"/>his faculty to other people; and from that moment there is a conſtant communication between the Somnambule and his new director.</p>
            <p>The patient being put into a ſtate of Somnambuliſm, there is in him a want of organization, which breaks the equili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brium of his ſenſes; ſo that ſome experience an extreme degradation, whilſt others acquire a prodigious degree of ſubtlety.</p>
            <p>Thus, ſome have their hearing entirely loſt or weakened, and their ſight becomes prodigiouſly penetrating. In others, the privation, both of ſight and hearing, are amply com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſated by an incredible delicacy both of feeling and taſte.</p>
            <p>And in many, a ſixth ſenſe appears to declare itſelf by an extreme extent of the intellectual faculty, far ſuperior to the common altitude of the human mind.</p>
            <p>In a word, the phoenomena, attending on the ſtate of Somnambuliſm, daily offer new ſubjects of aſtoniſhment, even to thoſe who ought to be more fami<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iar with them.</p>
            <p>It remains to conſider, whether thoſe pretended phoeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena are ſuch as is propagated; or, whether on the contrary, they are nothing the but illuſions, kept up by the impoſition of ſome ill deſigned perſons and the credulity of others.</p>
            <p>For it is well known that the human mind, naturally bent towards every thing marvellous, eagerly ſeizes on whatever is flattering to the taſte; and there are exalted geniuſſes to be found that employ both their head and talents to realize mere chimeras.</p>
            <p>Among the perſons who have been witneſſes to the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities attending on Somnambuliſm, ſome ſtruck with aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment and admiration, have given full credit to its influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and look on it as an irreſiſtible proof of Animal Electricity and Magnetiſm.</p>
            <p>Others, though convinced of the reality of its phoenomena, are yet incredulous with regard to the cauſe which produced them. They had rather ſuppoſe in this affair ſome ſecret ſpring productive of illuſions; and, though incapable of comprehending thoſe means of intelligence, they have, nevertheleſs, ſuppoſed their exiſtence; alledging, for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, thoſe cunning tricks which a ſubtle philoſopher<note n="*" place="bottom">Caumus and Pinetty.</note> made uſe to aſtoniſh all Paris and London during many years.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0328100200:7"/>
            <p>As to the Phyſicians, moſt of them have diſdained to prove witneſſes to the eſſects of Magnetical Somnambuliſm, under the pretence that it was ſufficient for them ſuch a phoenomenon was contrary to thoſe notions conſecrated in phyſic and phyſiology; they have conſidered thoſe pretended marvels as mere chimeras unworthy a ſerious examination.</p>
            <p>There was even a learned body who went ſo far as to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid their members to entertain the leaſt doubt on the ſubject, and expelled from their ſociety whomſoever have given themſelves up to the ſtudy of this new doctrine<note n="†" place="bottom">A decree of the faculty of Paris, 1784, which is the ſame as they did for inoculation, which is now adopted by them.</note>.</p>
            <p>However, on the other hand, Magnetical Somnambuliſm becomes daily more and more conſiſtent; a great number of people remarkable for their learning, probity, found judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſagacity, certify beyond a doubt the reality of Magnetical Somnambuliſm; and that contradiction of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable authorities on both ſides, leave the public in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, who, to take a deciſive part in the conteſt, impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently wait until the matter is more fully inveſtigated.</p>
            <p>The following impartial reflections may ſerve to fix the opinion of impartial people on the ſubject of Magnetical Somnambuliſm. To treat this object with the more ſucceſs, I think it is neceſſary to divide the diſcuſſion into three parts.</p>
            <p>The firſt point to be conſidered, is to know, in fact, the public have been witneſſes of phoenomena of ſome impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, well deſerving to excite their curioſity, and of which the cauſe ought to be inveſtigated.</p>
            <p>Secondly, ſuppoſe the effects ſpoken of deſerved to be enquired into, it is proper to examine whether they cannot reaſonably be ſuſpected of artifice.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, admitting it impoſſible to find out the artifice, it will remain to examine whether they are contrary to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon notions already received.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Are Magnetical Somnambuliſm phoenomena of ſuch an importance as to deſerve the curioſity of both the public and the learned?</p>
            <p>The object of this queſtion is, I believe, very plain and obvious; I mean to ſay, that previouſly to our being at the trouble of examining whether Magnetical Somnambuliſm be an illuſion, or reality, we muſt eſtabliſh, that, there
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0328100200:8"/>exiſt, at leaſt ſeemingly, ſome ſingularities which concern both the public good and the improvement of learning.</p>
            <p>Many people, however, might have a right to doubt it, becauſe they had no occaſion to know the truth of the aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They have a right to require to be ſatisfied, previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to the diſcuſſion of the two following propoſitions, viz. <q>"That there are either at Paris, Dublin, &amp;c. in the provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or any where elſe ſome people, who being naturally forced into a ſtate of ſleep, really offer the phoenomena which we are about to examine."</q>
            </p>
            <p>For if it was not certain that ſuch a ſcene is not to be met with ſomewhere, it would be a loſs of time to enquire into its principle.</p>
            <p>It is, therefore, a preliminary obligation for any body elſe, to eſtabliſh well the exiſtence of Magnetical Somnam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buliſm, whether right or wrong.</p>
            <p>This point was, for a long time, a matter of general incredulity. They plainly denied that there were any ſuch individuals exiſting any where, and the very diſcourſe held on the ſubject, was looked upon merely as a fable to amuſe the public.</p>
            <p>The firſt writing, which treated of Magnetical Somnam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buliſts, was, if I am not miſtaken, a letter from Mr. Cloquet, paymaſter of rents at Soiſſons, who, relating what he had ſeen at Buzanci's treatment, by the Marquis de Puyſegur, inſinuated ſomething which ſeemed to characteriſe Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Somnambuliſm.</p>
            <p>Since that letter, a gentleman, whoſe candor is above all ſuſpicion, has conſigned in a writing, which is, in every reſpect, intereſting, ſeveral phoenomena he had obſerved in Puzó<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nei's treatment, ſtill more wonderful than thoſe which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. Cloquet had given a ſketch of.</p>
            <p>The peruſal of this performance having inſpired ſome people of the firſt rank with the eager deſire of being wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to a like Somnambuliſm, the author of the above found an opportunity of gratifying their curioſity at Paris, in the winter of 1785.</p>
            <p>More than 5000 people have been at liberty to ſee thoſe phoenomena true or falſe, of which notice was taken both in the national and foreign prints. Theſe Somnambules un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent repeated trials, which all met with more or leſs ſucceſs.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0328100200:9"/>
            <p>Beſides thoſe mentioned, many more were made at Paris, or in ſome other provinces. This Somnambuliſm example having induced the Magnetiſers to adhere to that part of Magnetiſm, they applied themſelves to it with more zeal, as it ſeemed to be a ſure way towards a remedy. Thus, the concern of Magnetiſm, and that of the patient, uniting both to preſcribe that mode of proceeding, it is become the common object of all Magnetiſers attempts, and in all treatment they gloried in ſhewing ſome patient more or leſs improved.</p>
            <p>It is evident then that there exiſts many individuals ſtruck with a ſeeming Somnambuliſm; and I begin to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the queſtion, in order to proceed methodically, after ſettling conſtant and notorious facts, which might lead to infallible conſequences.</p>
            <p>It is then certain and indiſputable, that there are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Somnambules, which offer wonderful phoenomena to the ſpectators, as compenſative gratification for excited curioſity.</p>
            <p>Now, the queſtion is to know what opinion we ſhould form concerning thoſe Somnambules; if it be not a feigned ſtate, by the means of which they endeavour to impoſe on the credulity of thoſe whom they are ſurrounded by.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. How far are Magnetical Somnambules to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved?</p>
            <p>Among the Somnambules I am here ſpeaking of, I do not include that multitude of perſons of both ſexes among the common people, <hi>who are to be ſeen at ſome impoſtors,</hi> and may reaſonably be ſuſpected to perform Somnambuliſm, through imitation, or to make themſelves intereſting, and others who are paid for it.</p>
            <p>It is a misfortune, conſtantly attending on good things, that they can never be preſerved in their native purity, nor eſcape that mixture which malice or cupidity ſeldom fail to blend with them.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who, either through prejudice or intereſt, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to diſplay the diſcovery, take care to examine it on that ſide only, which ſeems to convey an idea of apparent quackery, and never fail to preſent it to the public in that view.</p>
            <p>But thoſe who ſincerely wiſh for information, pay but little regard to ſuch a conſideration, and throwing aſide quackery and exaggerations, carefully penetrate as far as the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0328100200:10"/>principle itſelf. Thus, a botaniſt, deſirous of procuring the fruit of an Almond to be enabled to diſcern its true quality, is not diſcouraged by the putrid fleſh which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounds it; but chearfully lopping all nauſeous ſuperfluities, he finds at laſt the fruit which is to be the rule of his ſtudy.</p>
            <p>In that manner ſhould every unbiaſſed man act, who ſincerely ſeeks for truth, without having intereſt or deſign to deſtroy it.</p>
            <p>Let us contemptuouſly diſregard thoſe ſuſpicious apparent Somnambules, and attend to thoſe who, by their civil exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, their character, manner, &amp;c. are above ſuſpicion; and in whom, beſides Somnambuliſm, the ſcience is por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed, and brought to the higheſt degree of perfection.</p>
            <p>I think thoſe ought to be choſen among patients, in whom Somnambuliſm appears to be in a higher degree of perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſuch a caution is, in my opinion, very material.</p>
            <p>In fact, the more imperfect the Somnambule is, the eaſier it is to impoſe; if he badly anſwers your ſigns, and follows your motions in an untoward and ill contrived manner, he apologizes by ſaying he is not, as yet, arrived to a ſtate of perfect Somnambuliſm, and the obſervator, who really conceives that ſuch a ſtate muſt have its degrees, is puzzled, on account of his not knowing whether the bad ſucceſs he has experienced is to be attributed to the untowardneſs of the Somnambule, or the imperfection of his ſtate.</p>
            <p>But when I fix on a Somnambule, recommended as a perfect being, it is evident that this taſk is very painful. In that caſe, there is neither excuſe nor pretence; the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator is eaſy, and Somnambuliſm has a trial to undergo, which is to prove either his ſhame or his triumph.</p>
            <p>Such perfect Somnambules have not been wanting laſt year in France; and among thoſe who have tried my expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments, there is one with whom I ſtaid more than half an hour, and who has before me, and at my pleaſure, executed ſuch motions as I preſcribed him.</p>
            <p>Being at my own diſpoſal, without witneſſes and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictors, left nothing untried to diſcover the fraud, if there had been in the caſe; but the ſwiftneſs of his evolutions, the preciſion of his movements, a vaſt number of facts which it would be too tedious to relate, diſconcerted all my at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts.</p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0328100200:11"/>
            <p>Many other experiments, which had their intended effects with regard to other perfect Somnambules, have all given me the ſame ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>There are at Paris, and in the provinces, more than 600 perſons, who are in the ſame predicament.</p>
            <p>Therefore, to overthrow the conſequences reſulting from ſuch experiments, there is no other reſource left, but to perſevere in giving out that it was a deceitful trick on the part of Somnambules.</p>
            <p>But ſuch a ſuppoſition carries with it the greateſt difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and is accompanied by improbabilities ſtill more ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than Somnambuliſm itſelf.</p>
            <p>To admit that the phoenomena in queſtion are the reſult of impoſition, two things are abſolutely required:
<list>
                  <item>1ſt. Somnambules muſt have an intention of deceiving.</item>
                  <item>2d. They muſt be endowed with an addreſs to do it. But, we muſt firſt confeſs, that, among thoſe who have already been or are daily inſpired with Somnambuliſm, there are many above all kind of ſuſpicion. They are reſpectable women of family, men of ſtability and known integrity, people of a plain and ſimple turn of mind, children, &amp;c. in whom we cannot reaſonably ſuppoſe to exiſt any deſign or intereſt, to ſeign a like ſituation.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Should they be led by any faction, or the intention of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Animal Electricity and Magnetiſm with any ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reality? But moſt of them have no concern at all, as to the fortune of Animal Electricity and Magnetiſm; nay, many of them had no notion of it at the moment they were confirming Magnetical ſleep.</p>
            <p>Shall it be ſaid, that, it is poſſible ſome of thoſe indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals are encouraged by the partiſans of Animal Electricity and Magnetiſm, and that they are but a mere inſtrument in the hands of the latter to favour the ſucceſs of that ſyſtem?</p>
            <p>But, for what purpoſe ſhould the partiſans of Animal Electricity and Magnetiſm have recourſe to ſo capricious a ſtratagem? The ſuppoſition, would, at the beſt, be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſible, if Somnambuliſm had originally been announced as a neceſſary effect of Magnetiſm; ſo that they muſt have been forced to reſign Animal Electricity and Magnetiſm, had they been deprived of the reſource tendered them by Somnambuliſm: but the caſe is very different.</p>
            <p>Animal Electricity and Magnetiſm was originally an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced without the attendance of Somnambuliſm. This
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0328100200:12"/>ſingularity is a later diſcovery, the reſult of the habitual practice of Magnetiſm. Even now, there are many Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſers who do not look on Somnambuliſm as being an effen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial part of the ſcience, but only as an acceſſary which may indifferently be united to, or ſeparated from Magnetiſm.</p>
            <p>From whence it plainly follows, that if the partiſans of Animal Electricity and Magnetiſm were in want of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource to impoſe on the public, ſurely they muſt have been very deſtitute of penetration to embrace ſo ſtrange a manoeuvre, which carried with it a prodigious complication of ſprings, and inſuperable difficulties in its execution.</p>
            <p>And, that had it been an artifice, it would have been ſufficient to deter every honeſt man from entering or aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating with it.</p>
            <p>They muſt then, have only dealt with, and choſen peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of profligate manners, and of the worſt ſort, to inveſt them with that confidence, at the riſk of ſeeing it betrayed, and made public on the very next day. That is not all, they muſt have found in thoſe individuals an extraordinary ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to act ſo difficult a part, and deceive the experiments of an enlightened and incredulous people, at whoſe tribunal appearance muſt be made.</p>
            <p>Had things been thus tranſacted, Somnambuliſm could not have laſted long, and far from gaining credit, time would ſoon have diſcovered the illuſion and deceit, by the difficulty of finding actors capable of perpetrating the impoſture. But the contrary has happened; every day Somnambuliſm gets new partiſans, and the credit which it conſtantly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, partiſans, and the credit which it conſtantly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, plainly contradicts every idea of deceit.</p>
            <p>Patients are daily ſeen in that condition, in the very boſom of their family, under the inſpection of their neareſt rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and thoſe who are the moſt intereſted to verify their ſituation.</p>
            <p>Who could believe that ſuch patients, ſurrounded with the very horrors of death and moſt painful ſufferings, could diſſemble for the ſole intereſt of Magnetiſm? Their relations, fathers, huſbands, wives, children—are they then concerned in the piot?</p>
            <p>Shall it be ſaid that their illneſs is feigned? It is another ſuppoſition no leſs admiſſible; for beſides that it is no eaſy matter to feign a malignant fever, a fiuxion, dropſy, and other diſeaſes of that kind, there are ſome ſo well averred
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0328100200:13"/>that no man in his ſenſes could poſſibly doubt their exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>Another conſideration may be added here, that is, even in ſuppoſing that a healthy man could long act the part of a ſick man, or the patient take upon himſelf to act the Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nambule; and, that people hidden before the curtain, ſhould preſide over this mummery, I maintain would be impoſſible in the execution; and whatever addreſs may be ſuppoſed to exiſt on both ſides, the deceit muſt ſoon be diſcovered, and, indeed, after a few moments, I would defy the moſt nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble buffoon, the moſt expert of all, and the moſt inured to bodily exerciſes, to aſſect Somnambuliſm before ſcientific perſons, or execute any ſuch thing as is obſerved among the Somnambules, whom I am now treating of. I defy any one to remain during eight or ten hours, having his eyes ſhut, and his eyelids quite cloſe together, without one eyelid ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating from the other during that period of time. Such a perſeverance ſeems to be much above the reach of human power and patience. Who is the man that could remain five or ſix hours in a motionleſs attitude, without ſhewing the leaſt ſenſation of what paſſes round him, inacceſſible to every emotion, and all the ſudden and unforeſeen ſhocks of noiſe which his attention ſhall, at periods, be gratified with? Who is that hiſtrion, ſubtle enough to imitate, with his eyes cloſely ſhut, the different ſigns which will be preſented him, and deſcribe the lines which will be traced with a juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and acuteneſs, that no interval ſhall be found between the order and the compliance. A few experiments of this nature would be ſufficient to diſcourage the moſt conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Saltimbank, and make him give up his undertaking in two hours time.</p>
            <p>Now, when we ſee the ſame effects conſtantly repeated, without the leaſt effort, and multiplied in the preſence of a prodigious number of perſons of all ſexes, age, and rank, we muſt neceſſarily acknowledge that they act through a natural impulſe, without any aſſiſtance of art: for it is well known that nature can eaſily perfect what is impoſſible for art to execute.</p>
            <p>Thus, phyſical probabilities concur with moral ones to eſtabliſh the reality of Magnetical Somnambuliſm.—Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nambuliſm cannot be rejected, without ſuppoſing it a deceit too palpable to credit, and in whatever manner you act, it will prove a phoenomenon, either moral or phyſical; and I
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0328100200:14"/>confeſs the latter is, by far, eaſier to be conceived than the former; for a natural phoenomenon, after all, is ſuſcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of an explanation; and the plot of a deceit, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and motive whatever, is no leſs complicated in its execution.</p>
            <p>A number of people are to be found over whom ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, ſtriking as they are, can never triumph. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever difficulties may be encountered with, to make thoſe ſtratagems ſucceed, they ſuppoſe that ſuch an addreſs takes place, becauſe they ſay in the things hurtful to reaſon, the authority of teſtimonies is of no value.</p>
            <p>That evident impoſſibility is a kind of reſentment on that part of the public who have not ſeen the phoenomena in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and inſpire thoſe who have actually ſeen them, with a certain degree of diffidence.</p>
            <p>If a common fact, conſiſtent with the uſual proceedings of nature, was only agitated, it is in general confeſſed, that there would be more proofs than requiſite to eſtabliſh its credit, on bare words and without having ſeen it. But as to a phoenomenon, ſo little conſiſtent with nature, which is neither explicable nor conceivable, and overthrows all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived notions, we are authoriſed not only to refuſe the teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of others, but even that of our own ſenſes. It is after ſuch an abſurdity that many learned have been heard to ſay, "That they would not believe it if they ſaw it."</p>
            <p>Now then it remains to conſider, whether Magnetical Somnambuliſm, and the ſeveral phoenomena uſually attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on it, are as inconceivable as thoſe gentlemen would inſinuate.</p>
            <p>Are Magnetical Somnambuliſms phoenomena repugnant to the order of nature?</p>
            <p>Phyſicians by affecting the greateſt incredulity in Magnetical Somnambuliſm, under the mere pretence that ſuch phoenomenon is inconceivable, give no ſatisfactory account of their diſbelief, becauſe, that the identical diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty they attempt to condemn, cannot withhold the victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous teſtimonies which militate in favour of Magnetical Somnambuliſm.</p>
            <p>The difficulty of conceiving a phoenomenon, by no mean deſtroys its reality; we are ſurrounded with a multitude of natural marvels, which no one has the leaſt doubt about, though they are incomprehenſible; for it is evident that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0328100200:15"/>nature has preſcribed certain limits which are inacceſſible to human conception.</p>
            <p>But, perhaps, ſome will ſay, <q>"From ſuch a mode of reaſoning it will then follow that we muſt give credit to every abſurdity we hear, and believe the greateſt oddities in the world; and thoſe who will exact ſuch a belief, ſhall only have to invoke the great power of nature, and the immenſe extent of its reſources.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That way of reaſoning would deprive arts of their rules, and baniſh principles from ſciences, in order to make room for raſh aſſertions, &amp;c. our learning, inſtead of being ſuſceptible of improvement and enlargement, would fall again into chaos and confuſion."</q>
            </p>
            <p>But that objection is, by no means applicable; for the queſtion is not to admit a phoenomenon under the ſingle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration that nothing is impoſſible to nature; it is, on the contrary, recommended that we ſhould ſubmit to the trial of contradiction, experience, and reaſoning itſelf, a fact certified by a multitude of perſons of every denomination who have been eye witneſſes to the ſame.</p>
            <p>Thus, till now, preſumption is ſtill in favour of Somnam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buliſm, ſince being grounded on the ſtrongeſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; thoſe conſiderations are neither overcome nor weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by the pretended improbability urged againſt them.</p>
            <p>But what will then be ſaid, if we were to diſcover that Magnetical Somnambuliſm? far from offering to the learned an inconceivable phoenomenon, incompatible with all notions admitted both in phyſic and phyſiology; it is on the contrary, a natural conſequence from thoſe very principles, acceſſary of the common notions with which it is blended and united in a very natural manner?</p>
            <p>It is what I propoſe to demonſtrate, and in order to proceed methodically, I ſhall firſt ſucceſſively examine the two articles of Magnetical Somnambuliſm, which have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited the reclamation of the doctors. 1ſt. The facility of putting a patient in a ſtate of Somnambuliſm. 2d. The phoenomena uſually attending on ſuch a ſtate.</p>
            <p>Article 1ſt. The Somnambuliſm's communication is in the order of the already admitted notions in phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology.</p>
            <p>It is ſomething remarkable to hear many learned men ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately declare it to be abſolutely impoſſible for a patient to be put in a ſtate of Somnambuliſm, by any art whatever,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0328100200:16"/>when we conſider that it is one of the favourite maxims in phyſic, that by the aſſiſtance of art all natural revolutions may be imitated in the human body. It is on that principle that the partiſans of inoculation chiefly relied to defend both the practice and ſucceſs of that proceeding.</p>
            <p>All phyſicians agree, that the art of inoculation conſiſts in preventing by a factitious indiſpoſition in an individual, the real one which nature would have ſoon or late oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned.</p>
            <p>It is ſtill according to the ſame maxim, that phyſicians attempt to inoculate many kinds of diſtempers, either to prevent them, or to make them ſerve as a counterpoiſe to other diſeaſes; and now the art of curing one diſeaſe by another, is eſteemed in medicine as a compleat knowledge of phyſic.</p>
            <p>The caſe being thus, and ſince it is acknowledged that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is liable to imitation, by introducing ſuch or ſuch maladies in the human body, is it ſo ſtrange, ſo inconceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that Somnambuliſm ſhould alſo be tranſmiſſible through artificial means?</p>
            <p>Somnambuliſm is by phyſicians entitled a diſeaſe; it is, therefore, in that quality as in the number of thoſe revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which the power of art introduces. To that effect one more ſtep is to be made in the career of diſtempers, and ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation: but ſuch an extenſion, far from contradicting the principles of phyſiology, only confirms them.</p>
            <p>It is expected, however, that phyſicians will oppoſe this ſimilitude, in eſtabliſhing ſome differences and diſtinctions; nay, they will perhaps forget themſelves ſo far as to take Somnambuliſm from the number of maladies, by diſowning their noſologiſts in this point.</p>
            <p>That no pretence may be left for ſubterfuge, we ſhall be intent on maladies and diſcourſe ſolely on ſleep.</p>
            <p>Neither doctor, or natural philoſophers, have as yet been able to explain the cauſe of ſleep, nor the manner by which it is produced.</p>
            <p>Whatever has been ſaid on the ſubject offers nothing but mere conjectures, the work of imagination; one thing only is certain, that ſleep comes on whenever the body is in any diſpoſition to produce it, and is put in ſuch a diſpoſition by the aſſiſtance of art. Such is the evident effect of narcotical piants, as opium, cockle-weed, &amp;c.</p>
            <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0328100200:17"/>
            <p>Now; if there exiſts any art whatever conducive to put the body in a diſpoſition to ſleep, it is not ſurpriſing at all that Magnetical proceedings might alſo produce the ſame effect. Will they ſay that there is a want of ſimilitude, becauſe in Magnetical proceedings neither decoctions nor infuſions are employed to create ſleep? I anſwer that there is no need at all to have recourſe either to drink, or any drug whatever, to convert any one into the ſtate of ſleep; the ſame effect is produced by a multitude of other means and proceedings; and it is even one of the particular ſingularities inherent to ſleep, that it is produced by an infinitely different number of cauſes, and which are all contrary to each other. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, if exceſſive heat cauſes ſleep, it is alſo the effect of exceſſive cold. Soldiers have been ſeen to fall aſleep on the ſnow, and even periſh with cold in that ſtate of drowſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>If gentle and ſoft friction invite to ſleep, exquiſite ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings act the ſame; which is proved by the example of thoſe wretches, who being put to the torture, fall aſleep at the very moment of their moſt poignant ſufferings. Others are ſaid to have yielded to ſleep while lying on the wheel.</p>
            <p>Gemelli Carreri relates, that when in China he travelled with a Tartar, who, every night, was obliged, in order to procure ſleep, to deſire ſomebody to beat him for a while on the belly, as they do a drum.</p>
            <p>Hunger and the exceſs of food, fatigue and reſt, and cool and warm refreſhments likewiſe produce ſleep; it is alſo the reſult of the increaſe or decreaſe of the blood running in the brain. It is the effect of bathing as well as bleeding: fever, which cauſes inſomnies, likewiſe creates drowſineſs; a ſmall difference in a doſe of wine awakes or makes a man ſleep. It would be an endleſs taſk to ſum up all the various cauſe, which induce man to that ſtate; whether becauſe theſe cauſes produce themſelves, or that many different combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are likewiſe capable of producing ſleep, or becauſe, notwithſtanding the ſeeming diſſerence, the reſult is the ſame.</p>
            <p>But in both caſes, one muſt confeſs that the means productive of ſleep are infinite, and that we are unable to determine on their nature or quality. This conſideration alone, doubtleſs, ſuffices to deſtroy the improbability of a ſleep ariſing from Magnetical feelings.</p>
            <p>Thoſe means, which at firſt ſeem ſo extraordinary, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0328100200:18"/>far leſs marvellous when compared with others ſtill more ſtrange, concerning which, not a doubt can be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably entertained, ſuch as thoſe as have juſt now been mentioned.</p>
            <p>The efficacy of ſimply touching to create ſleep, ſeems be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides to be a neceſſary conſequence, flowing from the general law of nature, that has deſigned the five ſenſes to ſerve as an introduction to ſleep. If touching could not produce it, it would be the only one deprived of that faculty.</p>
            <p>Indeed, if we conſider but a moment the four other ſenſes, hearing, ſmelling, ſight and taſte, we ſhall perceive in <hi>them</hi> as many conductors to ſleep. No one can deny but the ear is a very efficacious way to ſleep: the noiſe of a mill, the murmur of a river, the ſpouting of waters, a lingering converſation, the monotony of the voice, a ſlow and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly muſic organize the body, more or leſs quickly, in a manner fit for ſleep.</p>
            <p>The ſmell of aromatical and narcotical plants occaſions a drowſineſs, and ſome chymiſts have in their works given the receipt of ſomniſerous eſſences, which criminals have often abuſed.</p>
            <p>Taſte is another introductor to ſleep, and medicine eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhes thoſe means in adminiſtering narcotical phyſics, either to procure ſleep to thoſe who naturally want it, or to render patients inſenſible to painful operations.</p>
            <p>It is to be obſerved that moſt of the drugs productive of that effect, diſplay their power, before they have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed in the ſtomach, even before they are come down to it, merely by contract of the palate, or tongue; which plainly ſhews that ſuch an effect belongs to the taſte.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, the ſight is no leſs productive of ſleep. Too bright a light, by inviting the eyelids to ſhut themſelves, inſenſibly encourages and cauſes ſleep.</p>
            <p>It is alſo well known how far reading contributes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite ſleep. Many people never reſiſt that impreſſion, and even they make, upon occaſion, a ſure reſource of it.</p>
            <p>And it muſt not be ſaid that ſleep is then the effect of tediouſenſs, ſince ſleep is, for the moſt part, involuntary, and comes on in the middle of the intereſting lectures we could hear other people deliver, without feeling the leaſt propenſity to ſleep.</p>
            <p>It is then, doubtleſs, ſight, which in that caſe, ſerves as a vehicle to ſleep.</p>
            <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0328100200:19"/>
            <p>From whence it follows, that it is clearly proved that ſleep comes in through five of our ſenſes; now that obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation naturally leads us to think that touching is endowed with the like power, becauſe the conſtant uniformity which is viſible in all nature does not permit us to ſuppoſe that ſenſe alone would have been made particular exception of.</p>
            <p>Moreover, a little reflection will ſhew that the above fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty ought to belong to feeling more ſpecially than any other ſenſe. It is agreed, that, generally ſpeaking, there is but one ſenſe, which is feeling, and that the other four are only a modification of it.</p>
            <p>The ſight, hearing, taſte and ſmelling produce no ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in us but through the means of contact. The light, ſound, ſavours and ſmell only act upon us by ſhaking the nervous tufts of our organs, and ſuch a ſhaking can never be obtained before they have touched them. This is an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovertible truth.</p>
            <p>Feeling, properly ſo called, only differs from other ſenſes by its great energy and vaſt extent. The other ſenſes occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py but a very narrow place, and are only ſuſceptible of a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal impreſſion; but feeling, by experience, is ſpread over all the ſurface of the body: and this is ſufficient to ſhew that feeling ought to enjoy, in a ſuperior manner, the faculty of opening a way to ſleep: for being the chief ſenſe, and almoſt to ſay the principal one, from which the others are derived, how is it poſſible to conceive it deprived of a power which the ſubordinate ſenſes are endowed with?</p>
            <p>Laſtly, it is ſo certain that ſleep is introduced by feeling, that the faculty preſcribe opium taken in topic and applied to the ſkin, which really produces ſleep. The touching<note n="*" place="bottom">We may even recollect on that account manner of touching made uſe of in India, by which means ſlaves procure ſleep to their maſters; which is called <hi>Maſſer.</hi>
               </note> of an organized body may then, without any marvel, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſleep; and it is the point I want to clear and anſwer fully the objection of improbability. But, will they ſay, ſuppoſing the Magnetiſers to be endowed with the power of producing ſleep, there is not the like reaſon to lead us to think that they can likewiſe produce Somnambuliſm?</p>
            <p>The anſwer is plain and obvious.</p>
            <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0328100200:20"/>
            <p>Somnambuliſm itſelf is nothing elſe but a mere modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of ſleep. There is no Somnambuliſm without ſleep.</p>
            <p>We might even add that there is no ſleep without Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nambuliſm, and that every man is born a Somnambule.</p>
            <p>This propoſition, which is apparently a paradox, is no leſs inconteſtable, provided too much extent is not allowed to the meaning of the word Somnambule. Perfect ſleep is a time of reſt, during which, ſenſations are reduced to a ſtate of concentration, which diſcovers ſeemingly no other ſign of life but reſpiration and the motion of the pulſe.</p>
            <p>Imperfect ſleep is that in which ſuch a concentration is not complete, ſo that it ſtill leaves ſome acceſs for the interior diſplay of organs. We ſeldom enjoy the former kind of ſleep.</p>
            <p>In a ſound and natural ſleep, the perſon whoſe mental powers were abſolutely in ſuſpenſion, preſerves ſtill a more or leſs active portion of watching, by the means of which divers motions are performed: Who does not know that during our very ſleep, the body is agitated and combines itſelf, in order to chuſe an advantageous poſition; the hand is continually aſſiſting the incommoded parts, property adjuſts the bed clothes, deſtroys inſects, &amp;c. All theſe things doubtleſs belong to the watch, and of courſe conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a kind of Somnambuliſm. For we muſt comprehend, under that denomation, the exerciſe of every motion what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever occaſioned during ſleep.</p>
            <p>Moſt men carry ſtill farther the effects of Somnambuliſm, ſince there are many people who ſpeak during their ſleep, make different geſtures, hold diſcourſes of a conſiderable length, addreſs thoſe whom they think themſelves in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with, get out of their beds and in again, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>So common are ſuch practices, that they are to be met with almoſt in every houſe.</p>
            <p>Whenever Somnambuliſm acquires a more extended pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, it produces wonderful things.</p>
            <p>Then the ſleeper is ſeen writing, working, opening the doors, lighting the fire, aſcending the tops of houſes, ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming over rivers, currying horſes, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But you muſt obſerve that Somnambuliſm in this laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree is no new ſtate, nor contrary to the nature of ſleep; it is ſingly a reinforced modification of a ſtate natural to man and inherent to ſleep; which naturally leads us back to the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0328100200:21"/>following propoſition, "That every ſleeper is in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of Somnambuliſm;" that whoever gives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up to ſleep is in a near ſtate of Somnambuliſm, which is to diſplay itſelf in a more or leſs ſtriking manner, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the phyſical conſtitution of the ſleeper, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his diſtemper, and eſpecially according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent cauſes which have produced, preceded, or accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied his ſleep.</p>
            <p>From thence it is eaſily conceived that a ſick perſon already inclined, either by his conſtitution, or the nature of his diſeaſe, to a Somnambuliſm in its juvenile ſtate, is liable to receive with Magnetical ſleep a greater determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards Somnambuliſm.</p>
            <p>Is ſuch a ſtate uſeful in curing the diſeaſe? Such a queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not now to be diſcuſſed. Whether Somnambuliſm be ſalutary or not, it is however certain, that it is a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on ſleep, introduces itſelf with it, and ought conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to predominate more or leſs.</p>
            <p>There are people whoſe Magnetical drowſineſs is attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by no very ſtriking ſigns of Somnambuliſm, who are only drowſy, and poſſeſs a continual ſomnolency not inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to any thing that may be tranſacted round them.</p>
            <p>Others are only drowſy for a ſhort time, then awake, and fall again into a ſtate of drowſineſs. The nuances are infinitely multiplied from the very ſleepers, who diſplay nothing but what uſually appears in a common ſleep to thoſe who perform the wonderful things ſo much ſpoken of in all the world.</p>
            <p>It is thoſe very marvels that remain to be explained: for having fully proved that Magnetical proceedings, or a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact graduate and combined according to principles, can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſleep and then Somnambuliſm; I ſhall be obliged to reduce Magnetiſm to that rule which is already known. But the Animal Magnetiſm's adverſaries will not fail to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that Magnetical Somnambuliſm extends ſtill further, by offering the ſpectacle of a Somnambuliſm of which we can have no idea, is attended with phoenomena never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obſerved in natural Somnambuliſm.</p>
            <p>Such is the laſt allegation, which ſerves as a refuge to the incredulity of thoſe who never ſaw any Somnambule, and the diſbelief of them who had it in their power to ſee and be convinced. But it will, in a moment, be deemed ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing, to obſerve that Magnetical Somnambuliſm has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0328100200:22"/>ſuperior to the effects of natural Somnambuliſm; that, on the contrary, it exactly agrees with the phoeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena of the latter ſtate, which is nothing more than a more diſcovery; and ſuch a conſideration might be, by many people, looked on as a victorious argument in favour of Magnetical Somnambuliſm.</p>
            <p>ARTICLE 2d. Magnetical Somnambuliſm's phoenomena, far from being inconceivable, are, on the contrary, a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary conſequence of Somnambuliſm.</p>
            <p>According to the virulent declamations thrown out againſt Magnetical Somnambuliſm, repreſenting it as a baſe and deceitful trick, unworthy the leaſt credit, it would be natural to ſuppoſe that ſuch Phoenomena are without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents, and only concentered in Magnetical Somnambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſm.</p>
            <p>Such is the prevalent opinion with the public, even among the ſenſible part, compoſed of people no leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for their virtues than their learning; but who, not being familiar with phyſiological phoenomena, muſt neceſſarily have adopted that way of thinking.</p>
            <p>Thoſe very perſons might, perhaps, have had a different opinion on that matter, if it had been in their power to know that there exiſts in nature a ſtate abſolutely the ſame as that given out merely as a feigned one; and, that, the ſame phoenomena, which are, in the one, pronounced to be chimerical, impoſſible and inadmiſſible, are, in the other looked upon as inconteſtable, and certainly beyond any manner of doubt.</p>
            <p>Such a circumſtance makes a material difference; for they only refuſe to give credit to the phoenomena of Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netical Somnambuliſm, becauſe reaſon will hardly admit of facts by which it is hurt, and which are grounded on no precedents.</p>
            <p>But if credit ought to be given to natural Somnambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſm, the ſame muſt be granted to Magnetical Somnambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſm; for, it being proved that thoſe phoenomena really exiſt with regard to one of theſe two ſpecies of Somnam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buliſm, it would be to contend for contradiction's ſake only, to deny the poſſibility of their exiſtence in the other.</p>
            <p>We muſt then neceſſarily know that there exiſts a ſtate of natural Somnambuliſm, acknowledged and awarded by the faculty, during which, ſleepers execute things impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for any man awake to perform.</p>
            <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0328100200:23"/>
            <p>Without entering into a detail of the ſingularities alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy obſerved on that account, I ſhall only mention the phoenomena perfectly analogous to thoſe obſerved among Magnetical Somnambules.</p>
            <p>Nothing is more common than to ſee Magnetical Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nambules walk, go towards other people, ſpeak to them, come back to their places, take a book, paper, ink, in a word, perform a prodigious number of things which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports the idea of perfect reaſon and ſenſe.</p>
            <p>Thus is the public juſtly incenſed when any one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes to inſinuate, that ſuch perſons are not in a ſtate of ſleep, and that they neither ſee nor hear through their uſual organs.</p>
            <p>Some of thoſe Somnambules having their eyes open, the ſpectators naturally thought they muſt make uſe of them, and the faculty themſelves have ridiculed this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion, <q>"That people could ſee without the uſe of their eyes, and having their eyes open, could not make uſe of them."</q>
            </p>
            <p>But, unhappily for them, ſuch a puſillanimous obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion loſes much of its ſtrength, when we conſider that even our learned have conſecrated that very truth in one of their books, calculated to teach poſterity the actual ſtate of our knowledge. Open the Encyclopedia, and at the word Somnambule, you may read literally thus:</p>
            <p>
               <q>"People ſtruck with Somnambuliſm, given up to a ſound ſleep, walk, talk, write and perform many other actions as if they were awake; nay, even ſometimes with more diſcernment and exactitude;"</q> and afterwards,</p>
            <p>
               <q>"Some Somnambules have their eyes open, but do not ſeem to make uſe of them."</q>
            </p>
            <p>The learned conſequently (for Encyclopedia is their work) are convinced plainly to believe, with Magnetiſers, that it is poſſible to ſee without the eyes aſſiſtance, and that though the Somnambule has his eyes open <hi>he does not make uſe of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Magnetiſers have often obſerved, that Magnetical Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nambuliſm diſplayed in many patients a wonderful ſubtlety of ſight, ſo far that they diſcern very delicate objects through a bandage, or any other intermediate body.</p>
            <p>That propoſition, has not been more ſavourably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
            <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0328100200:24"/>
            <p>They have laughed at the ſtory of a Magnetical Somnam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bule, who had written when his eyes were covered with a head-band, and corrected words, eraſed letters to ſubſtitute others, upon or near them.</p>
            <p>They ſaid ſuch a thing ſhould be ſeen before it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved; and even after having really ſeen it, they ſuſpected the good faith of the Somnambule, ſo extraordinary the event appeared.</p>
            <p>But how could they forget that our learned had before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand prepared us to believe thoſe phoenomena, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting them to us, as a neceſſary conſequence from Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nambuliſm? <q>"If you follow a Somnambule,"</q> ſays the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready quoted article, <q>"it is caſy to perceive, that his ſleep, ſo much alike when he is awake, offers a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious number of wonderful things. Truth itſelf becomes incredible."</q>
            </p>
            <p>The author deſpiſing the exaggerations often attending on ſuch ſtories, has only referred <q>"to notorious ſacts, of which the truth cannot even be ſuſpected."</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is after ſuch a preamble, that he relates the ſtory of a young Somnambule, a clergyman and fellow-ſtudent of the Archbiſhop of Bourdeaux. That Prelate uſed to go every night in that Somnambule's room, as ſoon as he thought him aſleep. He remarked in particular, that the perſon got up, took paper, compoſed and wrote ſermons. When he had finiſhed a page, he read it over, and repeated it very loud; if, adds the author, that action was done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the eyes aſſiſtance, can it be called reading?</p>
            <p>The ſame clergyman with his eyes ſhut compoſed mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic; a cane ſerved him as a compaſs; with it he traced, at an equal diſtance, the five neceſſary lines, put in their ſtead the <hi>Key, Flat, Sharp,</hi> then marked the notes which he had firſt done all white; and when he had finiſhed, in taking up again every one of them, he made them <hi>black,</hi> ſuch as ſhould have been ſo, and wrote the words under.</p>
            <p>It once happened that he wrote them with too <hi>large characters,</hi> ſo that they were not placed directly under their correſponding notes; he ſoon perceived his miſtake (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the aſſiſtance of his eyes) and in order to mend it, he eraſed what he had juſt done, by paſſing his hand over, and made again lower that muſical line with all poſſible preciſion.</p>
            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0328100200:25"/>
            <p>The Prelate to whom we are indebted for theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, having placed himſelf before the Somnambule to be enabled to follow him with more application, obſerved a very wonderful circumſtance: The young clergyman hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put in ſome place of his ſermon the words, <hi>this divine infant,</hi> perceived in reading it over again, that theſe two words made a diſagreeable diſſonance, and ſubſtituted the epithet <hi>adorable</hi> inſtead of the word <hi>divine;</hi> but that altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion left an imperfection in the phraſe, becauſe there was <hi>ce adorable enfant;</hi> the Somnambule perceiving the error, very dexterouſly added a <hi>t</hi> after <hi>ce,</hi> ſo that it was written <hi>cet adorable enfant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whenever the Somnambule read or corrected what he had written, he took care to put his fingers on the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that were not yet dry; he made a digreſſion to avoid rubbing them: a caution he never took when the letters were not wet.</p>
            <p>It is to be obſerved that the Prelate, in order poſitively to know whether he made <hi>any uſe of his eyes,</hi> had imagined to put a <hi>paſte-board under his noſe;</hi> and it was in that poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he continued the operations above-mentioned.</p>
            <p>There are facts certified in the Encyclopedia itſelf, equally notorious, and above all contradiction; which is no doubt ſufficient evidently to prove one of theſe two points, viz. That the Somnambule can ſee without the <hi>aſſiſtance of his eyes,</hi> or that his ſight, exalted to an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable degree, pierces through his eyelids and the opa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous bodies.</p>
            <p>The memorials of the Academy of Sciences, and the phyſicians works, contain a prodigious number of obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which plainly conſirm the facts hinted, and others of the ſame nature. When an explanation of ſuch a ſingulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is demanded, they all unite to acknowledge the weakneſs of our comprehenſion, and exhort us to admire what we cannot underſtand. What Encyclopedia ſays on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count well deſerves to be related.</p>
            <p>
               <q>"How is it poſſible,"</q> ſays he, <q>"that a man buried in a <hi>ſound</hi> ſleep ſhould hear, walk, write, or ſee; in a word, enjoy the exerciſe of all his ſenſes, and perform divers motions with exactneſs and preciſion?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>We muſt freely own there exiſt many things, the reaſon of which we are quite ignorant of, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0328100200:26"/>which we cannot penetrate into, nature has its myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries."</q>
            </p>
            <p>The author of the ſame article, after having mentioned many ſurpriſing facts, which he aſſerts as inconteſtable, makes a judicious ſarcaſm againſt thoſe pretenders in point of learning, who believe nothing but what they can account for, and will not for a moment ſuppoſe, that there are in nature myſteries impenetrable to their ſagacity. Let us now obſerve the dangerous effect of prejudice.</p>
            <p>Whenever the ſame phoenomena are repeated by a Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netical Somnambule, it is inſinuated thoſe concerned in them uſe deceit and fraud, becauſe ſuch phoenomena are contrary to all received notions, and have no inſtance in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ature to authoriſe a belief. But how is it poſſible to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile ſuch a reclamation with the various examples which have juſt now been quoted?</p>
            <p>One of the chief objections againſt Magnetical Somnam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buliſm is, becauſe it offers both <hi>contradictions and inconſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences</hi> with that pretended ſubtlety of both ſenſe and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>It has been obſerved that thoſe Somnambules, ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning with regard to certain objects, were altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of others.</p>
            <p>For example, ſuch a man who dexterouſly croſſes a row of chairs without touching them, and writes or reads through a paſte-board, ſhall not ſee whether there are people round him; he will take one thing for another, and ſhall not perceive the fraud impoſed on him.</p>
            <p>But natural Somnambuliſm's example fully anſwers that objection, and the ſuppoſed contradiction, far from being an argument againſt the reality of Magnetical Somnambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſm, better eſtabliſhes its veracity, ſince it preſents a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of reſemblance more conſiſtent with natural Somnam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buliſm.</p>
            <p>The natural Somnambule of Encyclopedia well ſaw his paper and letter through a paſte-board, and yet could not ſee the very perſon who was placed before him, buſily employed in examining his motions.</p>
            <p>The ſame Somnambule imagining he was walking on the border of a river, thought he ſaw a child falling into the water; immediately he precipitates himſelf on his bed,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0328100200:27"/>making the ſame geſtures as a man ſwimming, and after having much moved and fatigued himſelf, finding the bed clothes in a heap, he ſuppoſes it the child, takes it up with one hand and employs the other to return, by ſwimming on ſhore; when he thinks himſelf there, he lays himſelf on the bed, and rattles his teeth, conveying the appearance of a man quite wet and cold; he then aſks the byſtanders for a glaſs of brandy to warm him, and as they were giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him a glaſs of water he perceived the trick, and inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on having brandy, which, as ſoon as he has got, he ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly drinks it, declaring, at the ſame time that it does him good.</p>
            <p>By that example it is evident that the Somnambule, though deceived by the ſight and feeling, had his taſte ſound and perfect, ſince he well knew how to diſcern brandy from water.</p>
            <p>Such contradictions being hereditary to natural Somnam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bules, they ſhould not be looked upon as extraordinary in Magnetical Somnambules, ſince both Somnambuliſms are derived from a ſecret diſpoſition which, likely, are very near the ſame.</p>
            <p>I had many times an opportunity of ſeeing myſelf ſuch contradictions, which at firſt produced in me a great diffidence, becauſe I was not then well acquainted with the ſingularities inherent to Somnambuliſm.</p>
            <p>Two years ago being at the Marquis of <hi>Puyſegur</hi>'s I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a Magnetical Somnambule, whom he ſhewed me, to take a hat which was lying on a table in the cloſet, and to go and put it on the head of ſome of the company.</p>
            <p>I did not expreſs my command in ſpeaking, but only by ſign in tracing the line which I gave him to run over, and at the end of which was the hat. The Somnambule, (whoſe eyes were covered with a paſte-board) got up from his chair, follows the direction ſhewn with my finger, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances towards the table, and takes the hat amidſt many other objects that were on the ſame table; but before he preſented it to the perſon, thinks it civil to bruſh it; and though there was no bruſh on the table, he makes the geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a man who took one; and holding the hat with his left hand, he bruſhes it on the three ſides with his right hand, puts the imaginary bruſh on the table, and carries
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0328100200:28"/>the hat, placing it on the head of the indicated perſon. Though that Somnambule had perfectly fulfilled my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I conceived ſome diffidence on account of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the bruſh.</p>
            <p>How could that man whoſe ſight and feeling were ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perfectly ſound, not perceive there was no bruſh on the table! How could he miſtake himſelf ſo far as to think he had one in his hand?</p>
            <p>From thence I inferred, that having committed ſo groſs and palpable a miſtake, he was far from having the feeling and ſight as ſubtile as they would give to underſtand, and that there was in the reſt of his operations more addreſs than fair practice.</p>
            <p>The Magnetical Somnambules, whom I have ſince ſeen, have all given me reaſon for the ſame diſſidence, by diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contradictions of the ſame nature.</p>
            <p>But how great was my ſurpriſe, when, after having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted the works, memorials, and relations made on Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nambuliſm, I obſerved the ſame contradictions in natural Somnambules, and that they were alſo an object of great aſtoniſhment to ſpectators; ſo what at firſt ſeemed to me a motive of ſuſpicion, became at laſt a new reaſen to ground my perſuaſion. <q>"What is inconceivable,"</q> ſays <hi>Pigatti,</hi> an Italian doctor, (ſpeaking of Somnambules) <q>"is, that, on certain occaſions their ſenſations are very ſubtile, whilſt, on others they are very impenetrable."</q>
            </p>
            <p>I ſaw in the ſame work an infinite number of other Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nambules, which, after having at firſt ſhewn a wonderful ſubtlety of ſenſation, ſeemed the next moment to be entirely deprived of them, by taking one thing for another, and confounding the objects which could claim no analogy to one another.</p>
            <p>The moſt aſtoniſhing Somnambule that ever exiſted, is, without a doubt, <hi>John Baptiſt Negretti,</hi> who was both fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and cloſely examined during five ſucceſſive nights, by a vaſt number of people. Mr. Pigatti, who was preſent at thoſe experiments, has given an exact and preciſe account of them, which is found in the <hi>Journal Etranger,</hi> March 1756.</p>
            <p>That Somnambule, having his eyes cloſely ſhut, took ſnuff out of a box preſented to him, came down many large
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0328100200:29"/>ſtairs without groping, heſitation, or even touching, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſtopping preciſely where he ſhould; placed bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, and glaſſes on a ſmall pillar which was in his way; went and came into the different apartments without run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt any thing; ſtopped at doors which were ſhut, and opened them; went to draw water from the well, took out of the buffet napkins, towels, knives, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally all that was neceſſary for a table; and performed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other things no leſs ſurpriſing, too tedious to relate, but which all ſuppoſe an exquiſite ſubtlety in the ſight and feeling.</p>
            <p>Next to this, are to be ſeen miſtakes, which quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict that perfection in the ſenſes. After having looked for a light, the Somnambule imagines he has a candle in his hand; without perceiving his error, he thinks he holds a candleſtick whilſt it is only a bottle; he helps himſelf with that pretended light by carrying it along with him; he draws near the chimney to dry a wet towel, though there is no fire; he ſalutes the ladies and gentlemen in whoſe company he imagines himſelf, whilſt there is not any ſuch perſon as he ſuppoſes among thoſe that ſurround him. He goes to the public-houſe, thinking to be accompanied by a comrade, though there is not ſuch a thing; he pours him ſome drink, addreſſes him, and drinks his health, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out perceiving he is alone. When buſy in eating a ſallad, they take his plate away to ſubſtitute a diſh of cabbages im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed with vinegar and cinnamon, unknown to him: they take the laſt diſh to ſerve him with a plate of raw fritters, and he continues to eat; they give him water inſtead of wine; at laſt ſomebody jeſtingly rubbing his legs with a cane, he takes it for the beating of a dog which he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes near him; he falls in a paſſion againſt the dog, looks for him, endeavours to beat him, goes and ferches a whip to chaſtiſe him: after having returned with the whip, ſome of the ſpectators throw a muff at him; then imagining to lay hold of the dog, he beats him with violenc.</p>
            <p>There are contradictions to explain that which ſtruck me ſo forcibly in the Somnambule of the Marquis of <hi>Puyſegur,</hi> on account of the imaginary bruſh he thought he held.</p>
            <p>There are an infinite number of other examples which might be quoted, and which all tend fully to manifeſt that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0328100200:30"/>inequality of ſenſations and ſenſibility obſerved in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Somnambules.</p>
            <p>The Library of Medicine, vol. x. p. 477. mentions a Somnambule, who getting out of his bed at mid-night, went to a neighbouring decayed houſe, and of which but little remained, ſaving the bare walls and ſome pieces of timber.</p>
            <p>The Somnambule mounted to the very top of that houſe, and jumped from one beam to another, though there was under a profound abyſs.</p>
            <p>In the ſame work is related a ſtory of another Somnam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bule, who, in the night time dreſſed himſelf, put on his boots and ſpurs, and then leapt on the border of a window five ſtories high, which he miſtook for his horſe, and in that poſture agitated himſelf with all the geſtures of a cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier who rides poſt.</p>
            <p>In the two laſt inſtances, there is an inexplicable aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the moſt perfect penetration, with the greateſt ſtupidity. How a man, who had addreſs enough to climb up the top of a decayed houſe, and run on a few weak beams, could not perceive the profound abyſs which lay under? and how he, who dreſſed himſelf as a cavalier, put on his boots and ſpurs, could take the border of a window for a horſe? To explain thoſe ſingularities, the principle of Somnambuliſm, and that want of organization which at that moment took place in the individual, ſhould be better known.</p>
            <p>That induces Mr. <hi>Rehelini,</hi> a colebrated Italian doctor, author of many obſervations on Somnambuliſm, to ſay, that we ought to content ourſelves with admiring the wonderful effects of that condition which Providence ſeems to preſent to the learned, in order to confound them, and ſhew the narrow compaſs of human underſtanding.</p>
            <p>The apparent immobility and inſenſibility of Magnetical Somnambules, for whatever is ſaid or tranſacted round them, is alſo experienced in natural Somnambules. He whom I juſt now ſpoken of, was quite inſenſible to the approach of a candle, which almoſt burnt his eyebrows.</p>
            <p>There is likewiſe in the memorials of the Academy of Sciences for the year 1742, p. 409, a diſſertation of Mr. <hi>de Savage de in Croix</hi> on the Somnambuliſm of a girl from
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0328100200:31"/>Montpellier, exhibiting a ſtriking inſtance of the like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility:</p>
            <p>
               <q>"On the 5th of April, 1757,"</q> ſays the author, <q>"when I viſited the hoſpital at ten o'clock in the morning I found the patient in bed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>She began to ſpeak with a degree of vivacity and wit, which ſhe never ſhewed when out of that ſituation; ſhe changed now and then her diſcourſe, and ſeemed to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs many of her friends who were aſſembling round her bed; what ſhe uttered ſeemed to bear ſome analogy with what ſhe ſaid in her attack of the preceding day, wherein having verbatim related an inſtruction, in the way of a catechiſm, which ſhe heard the day before, ſhe made ſome moral and malicious applications to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the houſe, whom ſhe took care to mention under fictitious names, accompanying the whole with geſtures and motions of her eyes, which ſhe had opened: in a word, with all the circumſtances attending on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion done the day before; and yet ſhe was in a ſound ſleep. It was a very awarded circumſtance which no one doubted; but foreſeeing I could never preſume to aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, unleſs I had previouſly rendered ſome formal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, I made them on her ſenſes and organs whilſt ſhe was in the act of ſpeaking.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>At firſt, as the girl had her eyes open, I thought that diſſimulation, if there was any in the caſe, could not withſtand a ſlap on the hand, or one given ſuddenly on the face; but this repeated experiment did not either occaſion the leaſt grimace or interrupt her diſcourſe: I had recourſe to another experiment, which was to put briſkly my ſinger to her eye, and to approach a lighted wax candle near enough to burn her eye-brows; but ſhe did not even twinkle on the occaſion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Secondly, a hidden perſon made ſuddenly a great noiſe in the girl's ear, and repeated it with a ſtone againſt the bolſter of her bed: at any other time ſhe would have been trembling with fear, but then ſhe appeared perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indifferent and inſenſible to what paſſed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Thirdly, I poured in her eyes and mouth ſome bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and ſpirit of ammoniac ſalt; I even applied on the horny tuniele of the eye, a ſeather's beard, then the end
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0328100200:32"/>of my finger, but in vain: Snuff blown up her noſe, pricking with pins, and fingers extorted, had on her the ſame effect as on a mere machine; ſhe never gave the leaſt ſign of ſentiment."</q>
            </p>
            <p>The 10th vol. of the Medicine's library contains a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial on a female Somnambule, who was inſenſible to the blows ſhe received with a whip on her naked ſhoulders; one day they rubbed her back with honey, and in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition expoſed her in the ſun's meridian to the ſtinging of bees, which occaſioned a great number of bliſters on her body, without ſhewing the leaſt motion in the world: but when ſhe awoke, ſhe ſeemed to ſuffer acute pain in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected places, and bitterly complained of the hard uſage and treament ſhe had met with.</p>
            <p>Concerning that woman, I obſerved an intereſting cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, which is perfectly conformable to what is now paſt; it is becauſe the learned and other profeſſors of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine declined to go and verify the caſe of that ſleeper, under the pretence that ſuch a ſtate contradicted the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons already received in phyſiology.</p>
            <p>The author of the relation thus expreſſes himſelf:</p>
            <p>
               <q>"The long ſtay that woman made at Louvain, gave every body an opportunity of ſeeing her, and ſcrupul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly examining ſo extraordinary a phoenomenon. The ancient profeſſors in that town looking on the event as a fable and mere chimera, could not take on themſelves to increaſe the number of ſpectators. It is thus,"</q> continues the author, <q>"that prejudice ſhuts the eyes of men of the firſt merit, and hinders them from ſtudying and applying themſelves to the diſcovery of ſeveral things which might prove very beneficial to monkind—Laſtly,"</q> ſays the ſame author, <q>t"he young profeſſors and other phyſicians in the town, looking on this phoenomenon with an indifferent eye, ſeriouſly enquired into the caſe of that ſleeper, and after a thorough inveſtigation, had every reaſon to be fully ſatisfied."</q>
            </p>
            <p>It will not be amiſs to obſerve, that the author of this page is <q>"a phyſician of the faculty at Paris."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Such an inſenſibility is true, for the noiſe which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounds Magnetical Somnambules does not extend to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kind of noiſe, ſince the Somnambule preſerves the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0328100200:33"/>of hearing thoſe perſons with whom he is in analogy and harmony.</p>
            <p>This diſtinction has been deemed, by many, a mere ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance, as it is not conceivable how, in the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual, a faculty could exiſt which lies open only to ſuch a perſon, and open for all others.</p>
            <p>But that wonder, repugnant to reaſon, finds its analogy in natural Somnambuliſm, wherein Somnambules are ſeen, who, though deaf to thundering noiſes and the voice of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral people, yet hear very well, and without the leaſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiculty, another perſon with whom they keep an excluſive relation, ſuch as <hi>patients, nurſes,</hi> or others they have more ſpecially approached, as a <hi>huſband, wife,</hi> or <hi>children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe laſt have not only the faculty of making themſelves heard to a natural Somnambule, but even that of making him <hi>ſpeak.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſingularity is ſo very remarkable, that many authors complain that certain perſons avail themſelves of ſuch a circumſtance to catch the ſecret of the Somnambule. It is thus that begins the article Somnambule in Encyclopedia:</p>
            <p>
               <q>"Somnambules are frequently ſeen,"</q> ſays that article, <q>"who, in their ſleep relate whatever happened to them in the courſe of the day; ſome anſwer the queſtions made them, and hold very conſiſtent diſcourſes. There are perſons ſo uncandid as to avail themſelves of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they are in, "to catch in ſpite of them," certain ſecrets which it is much their intereſt to conceal."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Obſerve well theſe expreſſions <q>"to catch in ſpite of them."</q> This plainly ſhews the acknowledgment of the formal influence which certain perſons awake can exerciſe over the Somnambule.</p>
            <p>But by ſimilar means and proceedings can ſuch a relation take place betwixt the perſon awake and the Somnambule? Magnetiſers pretend, and inſinuate, that the relation is eſtabliſhed by mere contact, by touching the Somnambule in the extremities of his fingers or pulſe; or by touching, in a like manner, any body elſe in relation with him; which preſents a kind of reſemblance with the loadſtone.</p>
            <p>They have not failed in exclaiming againſt this affertion; and when experience has ſeemingly convinced them of the truth, a deceit has been ſuſpected on the part of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Somnambule.</p>
            <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0328100200:34"/>
            <p>But to what purpoſe then have they recourſe to that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended reluctance, to admit of ſo ancient an effect, and long ſince well known in the world? A proverbial expreſſion traces us this opinion of old; for, it is well known that moſt proverbs are but ſcattered remains of forgotten truths.</p>
            <p>But as many perſons might refuſe ſuch authority, we muſt furniſh them with a teſtimony given out by the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves, and which fully evinces the efficacy of the proceeding taught Magnetiſers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry de Steers,</hi> a Flemiſh phyſician, certifies, that he knew from his infancy a Somnambule, who, during his ſleep, performed wonderful things; among others, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates that in the middle of night, and during a moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ſleep, he went and took his child out of the cradle where he lay, and then walked over all the houſe, holding the infant in his arms: his wife, who had accidentally per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this, afraid of the child, followed her huſband ſtep by ſtep, with an intent of aſſiſting them if occaſion requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: or, as ſhe had obſerved that, in that ſituation her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band anſwered all queſtions ſhe put to him, and took the freedom of interrogating him on the moſt ſecret things ſhe wanted to know.</p>
            <p>The author obſerves that the huſband was in day-time very circumſpect with his wife on his perſonal affairs, which he affected to conceal from her: but being interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by his wife, when in a ſtate of Somnambuliſm, and <q>"holding his child in his arms,"</q> then, ſaid the author, he plainly anſwered all the queſtions put to him by his wife, who followed him, and <q>"then had nothing concealed from her,"</q> and was often ſurpriſed to hear her ſpeaking of things which he thought were only known to himſelf. Vide Library of Medicine, vol. x. p. 463.</p>
            <p>The te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>timony of a reſpectable author ſerves firſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that influence ſpoken of in the Encyclopedia, which lies in certain perſons <q>"to oblige the Somnambule to ſpeak and declare thoſe very thing which it was his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to conceal."</q> It alſo confirms the poſſibility of finding out a means to eſtabliſh a <hi>relation</hi> between the perſon who is awake and the Somnambule.</p>
            <p>The Somnambule we were ſpeaking of, was in no <hi>relation</hi> with his wife, from the moment he entered into the ſtate of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0328100200:35"/>Somnambuliſm; to eſtabliſh a communication, it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary he ſhould have had <hi>his child in his arms.</hi> Laſtly, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the circumſtance of having his child in his arms, perfectly anſwers the proceedings pointed out by the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netiſers. The child, placed in his father's arms, and on the other hand ſupported by the hands of a trembling mother, eſtabliſhed a relation between the huſband and wife, through the communication and analogy he bore to each of them.</p>
            <p>Thus, that aſtoniſhing marvel, againſt which phyſicians have ſo much inveighed as a mere chimera, a fable, a fraud, has, long ago, been atteſted by one of their authors, who confirms in the moſt preciſe manner what Magnetiſers had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced.—It is eaſy to perceive that Magnetiſers, by putting themſelves in harmony with Magnetical Somnambules, do nothing elſe but procure themſelves that intimate analogy, of which inſtances are to be found in natural Somnambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſm, and into the principle of which they have neglected to enquire.</p>
            <p>As to the faculty the Magnetiſers pretend to be endowed with, to direct the Somnambule's motions, by making him go from the right to the left, forwards and backwards, in a direct and circulary line, after the manner of a loadſtone, in the preſence of the Carupeas, that faculty is a neceſſary conſequence of what has been ſaid before; and after having admitted and acknowledged the power <q>"of making a Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nambule ſpeak againſt his will, and declare thoſe very things he has a material intereſt to conceal,"</q> ought not have any great objection to admit the faculty of directing his motions.</p>
            <p>An inſtance quoted by Kaau Boerhaave, will afford an idea of the aſtoniſhing ſubjection which a man is liable to with regard to another perſon with whom he is in affinity.</p>
            <p>That author ſpeaks of a man who had the whim quickly to enter in affinity with all thoſe whom he approached.</p>
            <p>After a few moments, his body acquired a ſympathetical flexibility which forced him to imitate, with preciſion and rapidity, all the motions he perceived in the perſon he had fixed upon, as, <q>"to move his eyes, lips, hands, arms, feet, to cover or uncover his head, walk, &amp;c."</q> and all this in ſpite of himſelf, and through the influence of a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior force, which prompted his ſympathetical organs to act with thoſe of others.</p>
            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0328100200:36"/>
            <p>It was an amuſement to hold his hands in the preſence of any one who happened to make geſtures, and then he was extremely agitated, continually ſtruggling and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to ſet himſelf at liberty.</p>
            <p>If any kind of ſenſation was required of him, he was in thoſe moments conſtrained, and anſwered he had the head or heart ach.</p>
            <p>Boerhaave adds, that in conſequence of that odd kind of organization, he was obliged to go in the ſtreet with his eyes cloſely ſhut, and that he was a very troubleſome mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſociety.</p>
            <p>The example of ſuch a ſympathetical ſenſibility may ſerve to diminiſh the improbability, of the aſſinity and relation which Animal Magnetiſm ſeems to eſtabliſh between the patient and the Magnetiſer; and it is on that account that Kaau Boerhaave certifies, that a man can, by the means of ſuch an affinity well eſtabliſned, become <q>"a god for another man,"</q> by making him ſubſervient to his will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. <hi>Sic home homini Deus eſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We read in the work of the Marquis de Puyſegur, enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, <q>"Memorials to ſerve for eſtabliſhing Animal Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netiſm,"</q> many obſervations of that nature, concerning the patients he had put in a ſtate of Somnambuliſm.</p>
            <p>The very firſt perſon, whom, to his great aſtoniſhment he put in that ſtate, was in ſuch perfect affinity with him, that he exactly followed all his motions, and loudly repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every air which the Marquis internally ſang.</p>
            <p>That ſingularity which at firſt appeared incredible, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires (notwithſtanding the high character of the author) a new degree of authority from the above related examples, and the teſtimony of the authors, who have ſpoken of that kind of ſympathetical influence.</p>
            <p>The proceedings made uſe of by Magnetiſers find likewiſe their analogy and authority in natural Somnambuliſm.</p>

               </gap>ti was uſed to put an end to the ſtate of Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nambuliſm, by lightly paſſing the extremity of his fingers ever the Somnamoule's eve-lids. It is exactly the method uſed by Magnetiſers. We read in the work of the Marquis de Puyſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ur, that he made, at his pleaſure, a patient change his converſation, by deterring him from ſad objects,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0328100200:37"/>and preſenting him with ſome of a more conſoling na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>
               <q>"When I thought,"</q> ſays the author, that his thoughts <q>"ought to affect him in a diſagreeable manner, I ſtopped him, and tried to inſpire him with agreeable ones, which I eaſily did, and then ſaw him perfectly pleaſed, and imagining that he either aimed at ſome prize, or danced at an entertainment. I united thoſe thoughts in him, and by that means forced him to move himſelf in his chair, as in imitation of dancing, &amp;c."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe phoenomena have been ſuſpected, though they are fully confirmed by the Encyclopedia in the article of Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nambule.</p>
            <p>The author of that article, relating a number of wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful facts in the Somnambule mentioned, continues thus:</p>
            <p>
               <q>"The ſame Somnambule has furniſhed us with a great number of extraordinary facts: but thoſe which I have related are ſufficient to my purpoſe. I ſhall therefore only add, that whenever I had a mind to make him change his diſcourſe, leave off ſad and diſagreeable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, it was ſufficient to paſs a pen over his lip, and immediately he diſcuſſed quite different queſtion."</q>
            </p>
            <p>That conformity betwixt both recitals, ſerves to confirm the one by the other; and if, after that double teſtimony, any one is authorized to perſevere in his ſurprize, he is ſtill more ſo to perſevere in his ſuſpicions.</p>
            <p>To conclude, the laſt proof of reſemblance between the two kinds of Somnambules is, that of waking: they both entirely forget whatever they have either done or ſaid dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſleep.</p>
            <p>I could, by extending ſuch diſcuſſion, account for the communication of thoughts, without the aſſiſtance of either voice or ſigns, it being eaſy to ſhew that this ſingularity is not more difficult to be underſtood than the other; that it has been ſuſpected by ancient phyſiologiſts; and even men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in modern works of celebrated phyſicians; but I think it uſeleſs to expatiate any further on a phoenomenon with which the different minds are not as yet grown fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar enough.</p>
            <p>My object is, by no means, to write a complete work wherein the ſubject of Magnetical Somnambuliſm ſhould
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0328100200:38"/>be fully diſcuſſed. I only meant to elucidate ſome ideas, and to encourage judicious perſons to inveſtigate the matter, excite their reflections, and provoke in them a philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal doubt, and laſtly, to encourage them to contribute, by inveſtigation and obſervations, to reſolve a problem no leſs intereſting to mankind than conducive to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of Sciences.</p>
            <p>In my next I ſhall give an Eſſay on the Theory of Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nambuliſm.</p>
