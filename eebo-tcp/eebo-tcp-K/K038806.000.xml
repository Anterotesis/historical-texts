            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Flatter myſelf my friends will readily conceive, when firſt I made the ſubſequent memorandums, that they were not deſigned for the peruſal of any other perſons than my two daughters; nor ſhould I have been tempted to have made them known, had it not been at the earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt requeſt of a young lady, who, (having the misfortune to loſe her parents when very young, and by a late marriage was removed at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from her friends,) reaſonably ſuppoſing (from my having been the mother of ſeven children, ſhe knew I had ſuckled and ſuperintended) that experience would have enabled me to give her ſome inſtructions that might be uſeful to her in her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; from thoſe conſiderations
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0202501000:4"/>(leſt it ſhould pleaſe God to call me before my dear children were ſettled in life, on whoſe account I had taken ſuch pains) I determined to comply with her requeſt, and accordingly ſent her the following directions, not imagining, at that time, ſhe would have deſired me to print them; but, as I preſume, there may be ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations worthy the attention of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very mother and nurſe, in juſtice to myſelf and family I could do no leſs.</p>

               <salute>DEAR MADAM,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN I conſider how much your preſent ſituation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the advice of a real friend, I ſhall exert my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, though I fear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adequate to the undertaking, to give you ſuch inſtructions as I am perſuaded will tend much to your relief; you very reaſonably imagine, in conſequence of the natural courſes incident to our ſex not appearing at their regular time, that you are breeding; from that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, I readily ſuppoſe, you have taken particular notice when nature was laſt on you; ſhould you continue without any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alteration, you may begin to reckon from the tenth day after the laſt time: this method my mother taught me with my firſt child, and I do aſſure you that my midwife
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0202501000:6"/>paid her a very high compliment on the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
            <p>Riſe at your uſual time; and, if you breed ſick, (which is uſual,) order a cup of camo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile-tea, or pump-water, as ſoon as you come down ſtairs in the morning; that will help to keep your body open. If tea does not agree with you, try coffee, chocolate, milk, milk-porridge, water-gruel, balm-tea, or a calf's-foot boiled in milk; ſome one of which, moſt likely, will.</p>
            <p>Perhaps you may have little or no appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite early in a morning; if ſo, give a general order to have ſomething brought you at eleven o'clock; ſhould you not be inclined to eat, let it not be removed, for, though it ſhould not be agreeable then, it may a little time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.</p>
            <p>By no means ever go out hungry; from that cauſe the deſire of a perſon, for many things they ſee, or ſmell, in general proceeds; to avoid being ſo, I would wiſh you to carry a biſcuit, or ſomething of that kind, at all times in your pocket. Should you be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0202501000:7"/>as to mark the child, be not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, as it will not be of any bad conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and, in ſome caſes, a<note n="*" place="bottom">See the receipts at the end of the book.</note> remedy may be applied.</p>
            <p>During your pregnancy, ſhould you chance to meet, or ſee, any diſagreeable object, ſuch as lame, blind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do not ſuffer it to make any impreſſion on your mind, as you may then reſt aſſured it will have no effect on you or the child.</p>
            <p>When you are three months advanced, on no account keep it ſecret, as many ladies preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice themſelves thereby; ſhould you be hot, or feveriſh, and frequently ſick, it is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary you ſhould make your condition known to your midwife, (that he may order you, at that time, to loſe a little blood,) other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe you may depend upon it you will have ſore nipples, or your navel ſtart; from both thoſe circumſtances I ſuffered much, with my firſt child: it therefore behoves you to be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly careful, to avoid thoſe inconveniences, and, believe me, you cannot do yourſelf, or midwife, juſtice to conceal from him or
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0202501000:8"/>her your condition; a gentleman will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand your meaning at the inſtant.</p>
            <p>Should your body not be regular every day, eat fruit, vegetables, or a few jar-raiſins.</p>
            <p>When you are five months advanced, put on jumps, wear very broad bandages to your upper and under petticoats; ſew an eye to the jumps, that they may hook on; by this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod you take the weight off the loins: and at this time you ſhould engage with a nurſe.</p>
            <p>When turned of ſix months, ſhould feveriſh heats, fixt pains in the ſide, or any inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory ſymptoms appear, loſe more blood, which will give you immediate relief. Should you perceive your water warmer than uſual, take a table-ſpoonful of gum arabic twice a-day: be ſure, at this time, to have your child-bed linen well aired, and put into a large tin-box, in a warm place, for fear of a ſeven-months child, damp linen being particularly hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; ſtrictly obſerving that napkins are not applied to you, or the child, hot, as they would occaſion a violent inflammation in both.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0202501000:9"/>
            <p>As you find yourſelf grow weighty, lie down between the blankets at leaſt three times a-day, to alter the poſture; from which you will find great relief.</p>
            <p>It is neceſſary to have two motions a-day the two laſt months; the laſt fortnight you ſhould drink a glaſs of mountain, with a table-ſpoonful of ſweet oil in it, as it relaxes, and will be of great ſervice in labour.</p>
            <p>Should you, my dear madam, find your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf very uneaſy the latter-part of your time, make not yourſelf unhappy, as it is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable you will come the quicker and better for it.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as you are taken in labour, comb your hair ſmooth, have an inch cut off be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind and before, or you will find it comb off very much at the month's end. I know ſeveral ladies who have loſt very fine heads of hair by this omiſſion. The next thing, put on your night-cap, which will prove very comfortable: ſome ladies will not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to it, and, by that means, are very
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0202501000:10"/>much diſturbed. Four people about you are quite ſufficient, the midwife, nurſe, and two aſſiſtants; more only heat the room, create confuſion, baulk your pains, and prevent your taking them as you otherwiſe would: to prevent flooding, which is too often the caſe, or the fatigue of raiſing yourſelf up, I would recommend a ſilver ſucking-ſpout, by the aſſiſtance of which you may drink without being moved.</p>
            <p>A half-ſhift and body-cloth, with ſtrings, a double napkin to your breaſts, and a ſingle waiſtcoat, with ſleeves, to come as low as your elbows, (made by a ſkilful taylor, as ſoon as your are with child,) are all that are neceſſary; when you ſit up in your bed, throw a double handkerchief over your neck, and ſlip on your bed-gown; lie warm, but not hot.</p>
            <p>Providence has ſo ordained it, that a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, with her firſt child, has ſeldom or ever any after-pains; if you are well, and can eat a biſcuit, or cruſt of bread, the minute after delivery, it will keep the wind out of your ſtomach, and ſtrengthen you very much. Be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0202501000:11"/>ſure to have ſperma-ceti, ſugar, and nutmeg, and plenty of very weak brandy and water: and, in a few hours afterwards, a half-pint baſon of barley-jelly; but no caudle, on any conſideration, till the milk has been at the height, and is quite gone off, ſo that you have not the leaſt fever; as, by ſuppreſſing the milk at that time, according to inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, you will gain ſtrength very faſt.</p>
            <p>For the firſt twelve days, take of ſugar and ſperma-ceti about one-third of an ounce fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently; and, every or every other day, take a quarter of an ounce of manna, as you find occaſion, one motion a day being ſufficient; without which, in all probability, you will have a fever, owing to confinement.</p>
            <p>You may eat part of a boiled rabbit, chicken, or ſuch like food, every day for the firſt week; and, about eleven o'clock, in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, have ſome good broth, beef-tea, or calf's-foot jelly, by way of change, with the barley-jelly; after which time (if you follow my directions) you may live as the family do, provided they dine at one o'clock.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0202501000:12"/>
            <p>If your ſtrength will admit, I would wiſh you to get up the ſecond day, to have your bed made; about the fourth or fifth put on your jumps, and pin your gown quite cloſe; by attending to that, it will ſtrengthen your back much; and, from that day, endeavour to ſit up an hour, and ſo on by degrees, by which means you will recover your ſtrength ſooner than you are aware of: the weak ſtate, ladies in general are reduced to, ariſes from lying in bed too long.</p>
            <p>The fifth day you may drink half a pint of beer, with a glaſs of mountain in it; and, if you have any deſire for cheeſe, at your din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, eat a piece the ſize of a nutmeg, after which drink a glaſs of port-wine. The ſeventh or eighth day you may venture to drink beer alone; in that caſe, at and after dinner, drink a glaſs of port-wine: ſome time after lie down between the blankets, for an hour or more; if you can compoſe yourſelf to reſt, it will be of great ſervice. In this manner you ſhould proceed the firſt three weeks; during which time always breakfaſt in bed, and lie two hours after; before you riſe be ſure to have ſomething warm.</p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0202501000:13"/>
            <p>Dine at one o'clock, and by no means drink tea later than five; for, if you do, it will inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere with the undreſſing your child and getting your ſupper.</p>
            <p>Between your tea and ſeven o'clock drink a little warm jelly, or a glaſs of wine with a cruſt of bread; otherwiſe, undreſſing your child and ſuckling will be too great a fatigue. Sup at nine o'clock, and be in bed by ten; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that time do not ſuffer any perſon to come into your room, as it will diſturb you, and very likely prevent your ſleeping.</p>
            <p>Avoid ſeeing much company; for the weak ſtate you may probably be in will not admit of it: ſhould you be ſo, attend to this for the firſt three weeks, by which means you will regain your ſtrength ſooner.</p>
            <p>When your month is up, and you are able to go abroad, I earneſtly recommend you to obſerve, that if, by any means, you have been prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuckling for ſix, eight, or ten, hours, which will ſometimes be the caſe, you will uſe the Aſſiſtant inſtead of applying the child; ſhould
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0202501000:14"/>your exerciſe have thrown you into a perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, however gentle, make water, put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother cloak on, and drink ſomething warm; the milk then will be freſh and good: ſhould it not have vented itſelf in ſuch a number of hours, you will be convinced, by its ſmelling offenſively, that it muſt be hurtful to the infant; and without thoſe preparations the countenance will immediately turn pale, cauſe it to cry, have a ſtool, or perhaps both; and then it is the blood gets foul: by this omiſſion I loſt a fine boy, four months old. As every diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable eircumſtance injures the milk; if your breaſts are hard, and overful, be aſſured you have taken cold, which is impoſſible to be avoided without great precaution; and thus numbers of children, by the foulneſs of the milk, have been thrown into convulſions.</p>
            <p>I have great reaſon to believe, had I not drawn my breaſts at leaſt fourſcore times, with each of my two laſt children, I ſhould not have been able to have reared them, from trouble of mind, fatigue, and cold.</p>

               <head>THE MANAGEMENT OF THE INFANT.</head>
               <p>WITH reſpect to the treatment of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, though it be your requeſt that I ſhould offer my advice, yet I do not preſume to dictate to your midwife, as I very much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of their method in general; however, I have no doubt that, by purſuing the following directions, great advantage will be found.</p>
               <p>As to the dreſs, it ſhould conſiſt of a belly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, made of a piece of fine linen cloth, dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled about three fingers wide; when the navel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring is off, put it ſingle; when quite well, leave it off, as the ſhirt with ſtrings an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers that purpoſe; a blanket, a ſhort looſe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0202501000:16"/>roller, a little gown, and one cap; a long ſtay may be made uſe of, if you think proper, but not continued more than three weeks, either night or day.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the child is dreſſed, I would have you give it of ſyrup of marſh-mallows and oil of ſweet almonds two tea-ſpoonfuls of each, mixed together, which cleanſes more than ſugar and butter; as the former ſticks to the mouth, cauſes ſore nipples, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently throws children into the watery gripes.</p>
               <p>In the next place, the child ſhould be put to the breaſt; if the milk cannot be obtained, let it be fed with beef-tea, without ſugar; ſhould it be, even in that caſe it muſt be fed with the tea three times a-day, for a ſucking-child requires victuals oftener than you are aware of; if it continues to ſuck, the milk will cleanſe it ſufficiently; ſhould it not, it is neceſſary to give it three doſes of phyſic, by your doctor's or apothecary's order; as I I am perſuaded few nurſes underſtand enough of drugs to cleanſe it properly.</p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0202501000:17"/>
               <p>Should you have overheated yourſelf, had any uncommon uneaſineſs during your preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy, or you or your huſband have any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours in your blood, lay a bliſter on as ſoon as the child is born. I am well acquainted with an eminent and ſkiful midwife who never brings a child into the world without applying one before it is dreſſed, and orders gum-arabic, about a tea-ſpoonful at a time, to be given diſcretionally into its victuals or alone.</p>
               <p>On the eleventh day, as ſoon as the child is dreſſed, to a pap-ſpoonful of purifying lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion add ſix drops of each of the head tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, with which the head, forehead, eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brows, neck, throat, loins, and knees, ſhould be rubbed well; it will give ſpirits and ſtrength to the infant, and may be uſed with ſafety, ſick or well; be careful to dry the head, and as ſoon as done put on the cap, not uſing pomatum on any account. Children, in common, have a great deal of weak hair; by purſuing this method every day, it will either take it off at the month's end, or give ſtrength and make it grow: it will cleanſe an infant's head in ten days, ſhould it have ever
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0202501000:18"/>ſo great a quantity of white or yellow ſcurf, without the leaſt hazard of giving the child cold.</p>
               <p>The miſ-management of childrens heads, in general, induced me to try the experiment on one of my own, by which means I made the diſcovery; I therefore ſtrongly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to you, as I am perſuaded it will be of great ſervice to your child, and will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the fever in the head moſt children are ſubject to from improper treatment.</p>
               <p>There are two diſorders incident to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, in the month, viz. the red-gum and thruſh; the latter ſhould be very cloſely watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, that it may be ſent through as ſoon as poſſible.</p>
               <p>If the child is ſubject to the hicup, which is a ſpecies of convulſions, and proceeds from the wind getting into the ſtomach, it ſhould be put to the breaſt, that it may ſuck it away; if it neither will nor can, give it ſome warm beef-tea.</p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0202501000:19"/>
               <p>At the end of three weeks I would have you coat the child, which, with the ſtay, ſhould be half a yard in length: the ſhirt to be one inch longer, and the frock rather longer than the reſt; they ſhould all tie behind, by which means you may put on the dreſs in a minute. Feed your child as directed, keep it to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar hours, and cool in the night; you will then have little trouble, about that time, Should the child be well, it will then endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſtep up the nurſe's ſtomach, and get on her head. Is it not then abſurd that it ſhould be clothed in ſuch a manner as to deprive it of the proper uſe of its limbs? which it often is, from the common mode of dreſſing, at leaſt ſix months. How did our firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents ſhelter themſelves from cold? The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tells us they came naked into the world, and, had they not touched the forbidden fruit, they would never have known the want of clothing. Nature points out to us to keep ourſelves cool: the great folly of childrens wearing long clothes, I attribute to a miſtaken notion, taken from that paſſage in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, where we are told <q>"Our bleſſed Saviour was wrapped in ſwadling clothes, and laid
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0202501000:20"/>in a manger, as there was no other room for him in the inn."</q> At that time the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was juſt, being the depth of winter: but ſurely there can be none given now for cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a child ſo hot, who is confined for the firſt month, and, for the moſt part, a quarter of a year, either to the lying-in room or nurſery; which, in general, may be more properly compared to a bagnio than any other place.</p>
               <p>When you take an infant of three weeks old in your arms, ſit as upright in your chair as if at your harpſichord; from that poſition you will have the full uſe of your arms; dance it from thigh to thigh, which you will find gives it a notion of ſtepping. That you may not be at a loſs after your nurſe has left you, when the child is at the breaſt, avoid talking loud, as it affrights and makes it quit it; ſhould you have done ſo by chance, ſpeak in a low tone of voice, it will look up in your face, ſmile, and, in all probability, ſuck again.</p>
               <p>The time of day an infant is dreſſed, in general, is about eleven or twelve o'clock, which I look upon to be an improper one; it ſhould be early in a morning, as it not only
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0202501000:21"/>tires, but refreſhes, and gives it an appetite to its breakfaſt: when finiſhed, if not ſleepy, ſend it into the air. I mean at that ſeaſon of the year when the ſhortneſs of the days, and the inclemency of the weather, will otherwiſe prevent its enjoying the benefit of it at a proper time of day: in ſummer it is not material.</p>
               <p>At ſix weeks old it ſhould have no other co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, to ſleep in, but a ſhirt, and a little ſhift, or bed-gown, half an ell long; ſhould it not be kept cool, as much ſtrength will be loſt in one night as gained in two days.</p>
               <p>It is a miſtaken opinion that an infant will ſleep the firſt quarter; ſome may, but, believe me, it is not natural. The firſt four months being the time to give them a notion of their feet; at ſix weeks, if you ſuffer the child to ſtand on your left thigh, you will find it ſhove forwards, and put out its fee to ſtep; you may then with ſafety put on the Nurſe's-Relief, which I have ſo contrived, that it takes off the whole weight of the child, and may be worn at all times. It grieves me to hear parent deſire the nurſe to take the child; it is ſo heavy ſhe cannot hold it. In juſtice to yourſelf and it,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0202501000:22"/>to which particular attendance muſt and ſhould be given for the firſt twelve months, which will fully employ the time of any one perſon; by that means you will, in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, have your child out of arms in that time; on the contrary it may be almoſt two years. You will eaſily judge, by taking it into your arms occaſionally, whether it is properly nurſed or not.</p>
               <p>Some ladies are ſo particular that they think a child ſhould not be ſet on its feet till expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the firſt eight months, which is a falſe notion; for, as I obſerved before, the firſt four months the child ſhould exerciſe its limbs; after that time (and in many children before) the teeth are ſhooting into the gums, and that is often attended with worſe conſequences than actual t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>thing itſelf; becauſe an infant is ſubject to the ſtrangury; and a parent's not knowing or conſidering that circumſtance is what occaſions children to be taken off, from the age of four months to three years old; an inſtance of which I will give you.</p>
               <p>A perſon who takes in children to nurſe, whoſe houſe I had occaſion frequently to paſs,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0202501000:23"/>taking notice of my little boy, then in arms, led me naturally to enquire after her nurſing child, whom I had often ſeen, and remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have been a fine boy: the poor wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man dropped a tear, and ſaid the child was dead. The agitation of mind ſhe then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be in would not permit me to aſk any other queſtions; but, as I was paſſing in the evening, I took the opportunity, while ſhe was ſtanding at the door, of enquiring if he had been long ill; ſhe ſaid he had not: and what age he was, about five months; and had two teeth looked ſo blue, that ſhe had no doubt would have been cut the next day, which led me farther to aſk concerning the child's wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Firſt, whether ſhe perceived any ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page; ſecondly, if he cried before he made any; and thirdly, when he did, if it was not extremely hot; really, ſaid the woman, I did not take ſufficient notice. Another perſon, who occaſionally aſſiſted her, and was then confined to her bed, in the next room, (over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearing the converſation,) deſired I would walk in, when ſhe informed me ſhe recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the child not only cried when it made water, but that the water was ſo extremely
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0202501000:24"/>hot it almoſt fleed him; but that is common. They then ſent for the apothecary, but, before he could come to their aſſiſtance, the child was carried off in a fit, occaſioned by the ſtrangury, which he, being unacquainted with, directly pronounced it to be occaſioned by the two teeth.</p>
               <p>As a farther proof, I will give you an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a child of twenty weeks old, I was called <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n by a neighbour to look at, whom I found in a violent fit of crying, in which it had been about two hours; obſerving the child's knees drawn up to its chin induced me to aſk if it had made water in that time; I was told it had not. In about an hour after I look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in again, and found the child in a ſound ſleep; upon enquiry, I was told he had been very uneaſy before he made water, but, as ſoon as he had, it relieved him, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came compoſed; and, as in the caſe before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, his thighs were almoſt fleed by the heat of its water; in conſequence of which I adviſed her to give it ſome gum-arabic water, which had the deſired effect. The following day ſhe perceived two under teeth look blue, which I recommended her to rub with a gold ring; ſhe did, and they came
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0202501000:25"/>through with great eaſe, encouraged by the gum-arabic, carrying the fever off, by urine, incident to thoſe caſes. She has continued it ever ſince in every thing he eats and drinks; and he is now a fine boy: his grand-mother is of opinion that his life was ſaved by that means. In order to keep the mouth cool, when you perceive the child about its teeth, the firſt thing given it in a morning ſhould be a tea-ſpoonful of cold ſpring water.</p>
               <p>Every mother or nurſe ſhould conſtantly feel the child's pulſe once every day, that ſhe may judge whether it is in health or not: for my own part, though I do not profeſs any ſkill, yet, by accuſtoming myſelf to this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, feeling the water, and examining the ſtools, I am able to ſorm a better judgement than moſt people would imagine. I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to a very eminent phyſician for this hint, and I do verily believe it is a very eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial one to any who have the care of an infant.</p>
               <p>If a child's water appears of the colour of milk, neglect not to give it the gum-arabic three or four times a day, as you may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured it has either caught cold or is about its
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0202501000:26"/>double teeth; in either caſe it has been found of great uſe, unleſs it operates as a purgative, which is very ſeldom the caſe; if it does, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it a day or two.</p>
               <p>Some little time after the foregoing obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, I met a gentleman of the faculty, (the father of a large family,) whoſe opinion I aſked concerning a child's having the ſtrangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and at what age; he ſaid at or about two years old. The earneſt manner in which I put the queſtion to him, I ſuppoſe, led him to aſk me whether I had reaſon, from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience I had had in attending my own chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to imagine it appeared before; I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded the queſtion, as at that time it did not ſuit me to make the confeſſion, knowing it would be of great advantage to every perſon that purchaſed a Nurſe's-Relief of me, as I then intended to make a point of convincing them how neceſſary it is for a parent or nurſe to have the gum-arabic water by them the firſt three years, as few children cut all their double teeth ſooner.</p>
               <p>Should the child frequently heave, when the ſtomach is oppreſſed, which is common
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0202501000:27"/>from ſix weeks to four or five months old, ſend for your apothecary, that he may order ſomething for its relief; otherwiſe, by not checking the diſorder in time, you will moſt likely throw the infant into convulſions.</p>
               <p>It is very abſurd for any one to imagine the faculty do not underſtand the diſorders inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to infants: in many inſtances you will find their opinion requiſite; ſhould that be the caſe, I earneſtly entreat you will make it a rule to aſk in what manner he expects the medicines to operate: they will all acquaint you; but ſome, through hurry of buſineſs, omit it, by which they are often under the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of attending a ſecond time, to ſatisfy the doubts and fears of the nurſe, who, from the child's having two or three motions in an hour, and perhaps frequently ſick, alarms herſelf with apprehenſion of danger; though, at the ſame time, it may be quite neceſſary, and the infant could not be relieved without.</p>
               <p>I was greatly alarmed in a ſimilar caſe with my laſt child, and ſhould have been more ſo, had it not been for my mother, who told me the medicine, the apothecary ſent, would take
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0202501000:28"/>the effect as above mentioned: or, probably, by means of the fright, I might have loſt my milk; inſtances of which have been frequent; as ſoon a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> you have given the medicines, (for they do not always operate alike,) put a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble napkin round its ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>k, and lay it in your lap at leaſt an hour; it poſſibly may fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep; if ſo, the better; and it is a great chance, when it awakes, if it be not ſick, or have a motion; perhaps both: it may otherwiſe paſs off by urine; in which caſe, ſhould it be a little convulſed, do not alarm yourſelf, as it will not be of any bad conſequence.</p>
               <p>Should the child be in a cold clammy ſweat, do not let it make you uneaſy. Apply warm napkins to the neck, face, hands, and bottom; lay your hand on the navel, and gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rub the ſtomach, carefully avoiding to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heat the child; as ſoon as it is eaſy it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward your tender care with a pleaſing ſmile; endeavour to compoſe it, and then you may, with ſafety, put it in the bed or cradle, taking care not to diſturb it on any conſideration: ſhould it ſleep five, ſix, or eight, hours, be ſure, in that time, to draw your breaſts twice,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0202501000:29"/>as more children ſuffer by that omiſſion than you are aware of: among the number, I loſt a fine boy of my own, four months old, by that neglect.</p>
               <p>When your child is five months old, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided you follow my directions, you may put it into a go-cart, which I am perſuaded will be found very convenient; after it is in, tie the cart to the leg of a table or chair; conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue it thus for a fortnight, that it may feel its feet properly; it will take great pleaſure in ſtanding ſo: if you do not obſerve this cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but ſuffer the cart to run on the floor at firſt, it may very likely intimidate the child, and give it a diſlike to it. I have given direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for one to be made with a flag to it, to encourage the child to ſtand upright; and a chair on a different conſtruction from thoſe made uſe of in common, of which I very much diſapprove, as they are too great a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement.</p>
               <p>I have obſerved by my own children, when ill, that they have frequently taken a little warm victuals or drink, becauſe the fatigue of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0202501000:30"/>ſucking has been too great; but, as ſoon as a child finds itſelf eaſy, it will readily receive the nouriſhment from the breaſt, deſigned by nature. When you take the child out of the cradle or off the bed, after ſleeping, it ſhould not be ſet on its feet immediately, as it is apt to make it croſs; the feeble ſtate we our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are in, on our firſt getting out of bed, plainly ſhews the utility of the above caution; you will therefore do well to ſet the child in its chair, and divert it for five minutes; after that time it may, with ſafety, be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to go to play.</p>
               <p>I do not approve of a back-ſtring; nor do I allow a child to run alone till it can get up of itſelf, after falling: neither do I ſuffer any body to take it off the ground, when young; ſhould you accuſtom them to that, they will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I hope by theſe inſtructions, which you have from under my hand, you will be a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
