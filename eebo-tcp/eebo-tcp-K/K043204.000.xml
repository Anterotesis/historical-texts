            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THOSE paſſages that are printed in <hi>Italics</hi> (not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the French) were omitted on the firſt repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, one excepted, page 66, of which the words that then gave offence are diſtinguiſhed by capitals. They are thus pointed out that the reader, who in the heat of political zeal has not quite loſt his underſtanding, may examine what there is in them injurious to truth, or the good of mankind, and find it, if he can. In different times and under different feelings, it will appear aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that any one of theſe paſſages were ſuppreſſed, from any apprehenſion of political reſentment: but ſuch was the fact. That the one unwarily retained ſhould excite the anger which was teſtified is ſtill more aſtoniſhing. A ſentence ſo true as to have been repeated in a thouſand different modes: for all ſtrong moral truths are ſubject to ſuch repetition. A ſentence that, under a variety of forms and phraſeology, is proverbial in all nations. It ought however to be remembered, that the perſons offended, though violent, were few. Their intention doubtleſs was good: the ſame cannot be affirmed of their intellect.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who are acquainted with German literature, and who have read the drama entitled, <hi>Der Deutſche Hauſvater,</hi> by the Baron von Gemmingen, will immediately perceive that the author has availed himſelf of various incidents and thoughts in that piece; though his fable, characters, and denouement are exceedingly different. Others, who wiſh to ſatisfy their curioſity but who cannot read Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, may find a French tranſlation of that piece in vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume VI. of a work entitled <hi>Nouveau Theatre Allemand,</hi> by M. M. Friedel and de Bonneville.</p>

            <p>THE reaſons which have occaſioned the alteration of price in the preſent comedy ought to be ſtated to the public. The previous knowledge of men and manners, and the extraordinary efforts of ſtudy, time, and talents, which are neceſſary to produce a play that has but a chance of being ſanctioned by the town, are ſufficiently obvious. The labourer is worthy of his hire. In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the preſent century, the price of an octavo play was eighteen pence. Since that period, the price of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per has been doubled; the expence of printing is advanced in nearly the ſame ratio; and advertiſing, which now amounts to a conſiderable ſum, was then a burthen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known. It has long been the complaint of the trade that the purchaſe of the copy-right, added to the above coſts, occaſioned plays to be a dangerous ſpeculation. The new tax on paper, in addition to all theſe, has made it impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, at the former price, to reward authors, and afford the bookſeller a reaſonable hope of profit. Theſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations have induced an advance of price, at which it is preſumed no juſt reaſoner will take offence.</p>

                     <p>True. The lord to whom I ſent a pair of pictures has appointed to ſee me. I muſt go. Yet why? I ſhall gain no admittance. Not at home, is the everlaſting anſwer. The inſolent por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will ſcarcely open the gate wide enough for my hand to enter. But I am poor, and muſt wait, and come again, and again, and take affronts patiently. So it is. The lord within, ſits in ſtate, reveling, banqueting, and tantalizing the palled appetite; while the wretch without, repulſed, inſulted, and refuſed his due, is perhaps periſhing with hunger!</p>

                     <p>Me?—Pardon me. I muſt not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited. I know my diſtance, and I will keep it. No footman ſhall ſneer over my ſhoulder.

                     <p>Keep your mouth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhut—Greater: but they did not make a ſyſtem of vice; they were hurried into it by their paſſions. Theirs were the crimes of men. There is a diſgraceful a contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meanneſs in the vices, as well as the perſons of

the preſent puny race; and neither their paſſions nor their bodies have ſufficient proweſs to make them commit acts, that can entitle them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</p>

                     <p>
                        <stage>(Riſes with animation)</stage> If they fight a duel, it is not in the heat of anger, and deſire of revenge; but it is done with as much ceremony and civility as if they were going to walk a minuet, or ſip a diſh of tea: ay and as little danger, too; for, as they manage the matter, there is ten times more terror in a crabtree cudgel than in lead and ſteel.</p>

                     <p>Why as to the merit, or virtue, of fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing duels, either in the old mode or the new, I believe we had better not talk of that.</p>
