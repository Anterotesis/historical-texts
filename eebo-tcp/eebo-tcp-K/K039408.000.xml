            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I am ſenſible how unworthy it appears in a Son to deſcant on the unamiable paſſions of a Father; but as we are alone, and friends, I cannot help ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, in my own defence, that when a Father will not allow the uſe of reaſon to any of his Family—when his purſuit of greatneſs makes him a ſlave abroad—only to be a tyrant at home—when his narrow partiality to Scotland, on every trivial occaſion, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes him to enmity even with his Wife and Children, only becauſe they dare give a national preference where they think it is moſt juſtly due—and when merely to gratify his own ambition, he would marry his Son into a family he deteſts.
<stage>(<hi>With great warmth.</hi>)</stage>
Sure, Sidney, a Son thus circumſtanced (from the dignity of human nature, and the feelings of a loving heart) has a right, not only to proteſt againſt the blindneſs of the Parent, but to purſue thoſe meaſures, that virtue and happineſs point out.</p>

He has baniſhed one Son already, only for daring to differ from his judgment concerning the merits of Scotch and Engliſh hiſtorians.—But this young Man muſt not marry Conſtantia—wou'd his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were here:—ſhe, I ſuppoſe, knows nothing of his indiſcretion, but ſhe ſhall the moment ſhe comes hither—I know it will offend him—no matter, it is our duty to offend, when the offence ſaves the Man we love from a precipitate action, which the world muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn, and his own heart, perhaps, upon reflection, for ever repent.—Yes, I muſt diſcharge the duty of my function, and a friend, tho' I am ſure to loſe the Man whom I intend to ſerve.

Madam, it is with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme regret I tell you, that I can no longer be a ſlave to his temper, his politics, and his ſcheme of marrying me to this woman. Therefore, you had better conſent at once to my going out of the kingdom, and to my taking Conſtantia with me; for without her, I never can be happy.</p>

I will open it to your Father—Pray, dear Charles, be ruled, let me prevail. Here he comes, I will get out of his way—but I beg, Charles, while he is in this ill humour, that you will not oppoſe him, let him ſay what he will—when his paſſion is a little cool, I will return and try to bring him to reaſon—but pray do not thwart him.</p>

                  <p>My dear Lord I beg ten millions of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons for leaving the town before you; but you ken that your Lordſhip at dinner yeſterday poſitively ſettled it, that we ſhould meet this morning at the levee.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir Pert.</speaker>
                  <p>You did, indeed, and accordingly I was at the levee, and waited there till every mortal was gone—and ſeeing you did not come, I concluded that your Lordſhip was gone before, and away I pelted hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as I thought after ye.</p>

                  <p>Why, to confeſs the truth, my dear Mac—that old ſinner, Lord Freakiſh, General Jolly, Sir An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony Soker, and two or three more of that ſet, laid hold of me laſt night at the opera; and as the General ſays, I believe by the intelligence of my head this morning; that we drank deep ere we departed—ha! ha! ha!</p>

                  <speaker>Sir Pert.</speaker>
                  <p>ZOONDS, Sir, I will not hear a word aboot it.—I inſiſt upon it ye were wrong—ye ſhai'd hai paid your court till my Lord, and not hai ſcrupled ſwallowing a bumper, or twa, or twanty, till oblige him.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Egert.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir. I did drink his toaſt in a bumper.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Pert.</speaker>
                  <p>Yas, ye did; but how? how?—Juſt aſs a bairn takes pheeſyc, we averſion, and wry faces, whach my Lord obſerved.—Then to mend the maiter, the moment that he and the Colonel get intill a drunken diſpute aboot religion, ye ſlily ſlunged awa.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Egert</speaker>
                  <p>I thought, Sir, it was time to go, when my Lord inſiſted upon half-pint bumpers.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Pert.</speaker>
                  <p>That was not levell'd at you; but at the Colonel, in order till try his bottom—but they all agreed that ye and I ſhou'd drink out of ſmall glaſſes.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Egert.</speaker>
                  <p>But, Sir, I beg pardon—I did not chuſe to drink any more.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Pert.</speaker>
                  <p>But zoonds, Sir! I tell you there was a neceſſity for your drinking more.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Egert.</speaker>
                  <p>A neceſſity! in what reſpect, Sir?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Pert.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, Sir, I have a certain point to carry, independent of the Lawyers, with my Lord, in this agreement of your marriage, aboot which I am afraid we ſhall hai a warm ſquabble, and therefore I wanted your aſſiſtance in it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Egert.</speaker>
                  <p>But how, Sir, could my drinking contribute to aſſiſt you in your ſquabble?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Pert.</speaker>
                  <p>Yas, Sir, it would hai contributed, and greatly hai contributed till aſſiſt me.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Egert</speaker>
                  <p>How ſo, Sir?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Pert.</speaker>
                  <p>Nai, Sir, it might hai prevented the ſquabble entirely, for as my Lord is prood of ye for a ſon-in law, and of your little French ſongs, your
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0058901400:34"/>
ſtories, about the Popes, and Cardinals, and their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes, and your bon-mots, when ye are in the humour, and guin you had but ſtaid and been a leetle jolly, and drank half a ſcore bumpers we him, till he got a little tipſy, I am ſure when we had him i that mood, we might ha ſettled the point among ourſelves before the Lawyers come; but n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Egert.</speaker>
                  <p>But, when a man is intoxicated, would that have been a ſeaſonable time to ſettle buſineſs, Sir?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Pert.</speaker>
                  <p>The moſt ſeaſonable—the moſt ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able—for, Sir, when my Lord is in his cups, his ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peecion is aſleep, and his heart is aw jolity, ſeen, and gude fellowſhip—and, Sir, can there be a happier mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than that for a bargain, or till ſettle a diſpute we a friend? What is that you ſhrug your ſhouders at, Sir?—and turn up your eyes to heaven, like a duck in thunder!</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Egert.</speaker>
                  <p>At my own ignorance, Sir—for I underſtand neither the philoſophy, nor the morality of your doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Pert.</speaker>
                  <p>I know you do not, Sir—and what is worſe, ye never weell underſtand it, as long aſs ye pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.—In yean word, Chairles, I hai often tauld ye, and again I tell ye, yeance for aw, that the manoeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres of pleeabeelity are as neceſſary to riſe i' the world, aſs wrangling and logical ſublilty at the bar—why, you ſee, Sir, I hai acquired a noble fortune—a princely fortune—and how d'ye think I raiſed it?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Egert.</speaker>
                  <p>Doubtleſs, Sir, by your abilities.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Pert.</speaker>
                  <p>Dootleſs, Sir, ye are a blockhead—Nae, Sir, I'll tell you how I raiſed it, Sir—I raiſed it by boowing—by boowing, Sir.—I never i' my life could ſtand ſtraight i' the preſence of a great man; but was aw ways booing, and booing, and booing—aſs—aſs—if it were by inſtinct.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Egert.</speaker>
                  <p>How do you mean by inſtinct, Sir?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Pert.</speaker>
                  <p>How do I mean by inſtinct, why, Sir, I mean by—by—by the inſtinct of intereſt, Sir, which is the univerſal inſtinct of mankind, Sir; it is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to think what a cordial, what an amicable, nay,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0058901400:35"/>
what an infaleeble influence, booing has upon the pride and vanity of human nature—Chairles, anſwer me ſincerely, hai ye a mind till be convinced of the force of my doctrine, by example and demonſtration?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Egert.</speaker>
                  <p>Certainly, Sir.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Pert.</speaker>
                  <p>Then, Sir, as the greateſt favour I can confer upon you, I will gi ye a ſhort ſketch of the ſtages of my bowing, aſs an excitement, and a land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark for ye till bow by, and aſs an infaleeable noſtrum for a man of the world, till thrive in the world.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Egert.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, I ſhall be proud to profit by your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Pert.</speaker>
                  <p>Vary weel, Sir—ſit ye down then
<stage>(both ſit)</stage>
and now, Sir, you muſt recall till your thoughts, that your Grandfather was a man whoſe penurious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of Captain's half-pay, was the ſum total of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; and, Sir, aw my proveeſion fra him, was a medium of Latin, an expartneſs at areethmatic, and a ſhort ſyſtem of worldly counſel, the chief ingredients of whach were, a perſevering induſtry—a reegid oeconomy—a ſmooth tongue—a pliabeelity of temper—and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant attention till make every great man well pleaſed we himſelf.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Egert.</speaker>
                  <p>Very prudent conduct, Sir.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Pert.</speaker>
                  <p>Therefore, Sir, I lay it before ye.—Now, Sir, wi theſe materials, I ſet out a rough, rawboned ſtrippling fra the North, till try my fortune we them here i' the ſooth—and my firſt ſtep intull the world, was a beggarly clerkſhip in Sawney Gordon's coonting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, here in the city of London, whach you'll ſay afforded but a barren ſort of a proſpect.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Egert.</speaker>
                  <p>It was not a very fertile one, indeed, Sir.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Pert.</speaker>
                  <p>The reverſe—the reverſe—weel, Sir, ſeeing my ſel in this unprofitable ſeetuation, I reflacted deeply. I caſt aboot my thoughts, and concluded that a matrimonial adventure, prudently conducted, would be the readieſt gate I could gang for the better<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of my condition, and accordingly I ſet aboot it, now, Sir, in this purſuit—beauty—beauty—ah I beauty often ſtruck mine een, and played aboot my heart—and fluttered, and beat, and knocked—and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0058901400:36"/>
knocked—but the deel an entrance I ever let it get—for I obſerved, that beauty is generally a prood, vain, ſaucy, expenſive ſort of a commodity.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Egert.</speaker>
                  <p>Very juſtly obſerved, Sir.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Pert.</speaker>
                  <p>And therefore I left it to the prodigals and coxcombs, that could afford till pay for it, and its ſtead, Sir, mark—I luock'd oot for an antient, well jointered, ſuperanuated Dowager—a conſumptive, toothleſs, ptiſical, wealthy widow—or a ſhreeveled, cadaverous, neglected piece of deformity, i' the ſhape of an eezard, or an apperſiand—or in ſhort, any thing—any thing that had the ſiller—the ſiller—for that was the North ſtar of my affection; do you take me, Sir—was nai that right?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Egert.</speaker>
                  <p>O doubtleſs, doubtleſs, Sir.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Pert.</speaker>
                  <p>Now, Sir, where do ye think I ganged to luock for this woman we the ſiller? Nai till court—nai till play-houſes, nor aſſemblies—nai, Sir, I ganged till the kirk—till the anabaptiſt, eendependant, bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleonian, muckletonian meetings—till the morning and evening ſervice of churches and chapples of eaſe—and till the midnight, melting, conciliating love-feaſts of the methodiſts—and there, at laſt, Sir, I fell upon an old, rich, ſower, ſlighted, antiquated, muſty maiden. She was as tall as a grenadier, and ſo thin that ſhe luocked ha! ha! ha! ſhe luocked—juſt like a ſkeleton in a ſurgeons's glaſs-caſe—Now, Sir, this meeſerable object, was releegiouſly angry wi herſelf, and aw the world—and had nai comfort but in a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, vicious, and enthuſiaſtic delirums; ha! ha! ha! Sir, ſhe was mad—aſs mad as a bedlamite.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Egert.</speaker>
                  <p>Not impoſſible, Sir—there are numbers of poor creatures in the ſame condition.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Pert.</speaker>
                  <p>O numbers, numbers—now, Sir, this cracked creature uſed to pray, and ſing, and ſigh, and groan, and weep, and wail, and gnaſh her teeth conſtantly, morning and evening, at the Tabernacle, in Moor-fields, and as ſoon as I found ſhe had the ſiller, aha!—in gude truth, I plumpt me doon upon my knees, cloſe by her, cheek by jole, and praid, and ſighed, and groaned, and gnaſhed my teeth, as ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0058901400:37"/>
aſs ſhe could do for the life of her—ay, and turned up the whites of mine een, till the ſtrings awmoſt crackt again—Weel, Sir, I watched her motions—handed her till her chair—waited on her home—got moſt releegiouſly intimate we her—in a week married her—in a fortnight buried her—in a month touched the ſiller—and we a deep ſuit of mourning, a melancholy port, a ſorrowful veeſage, and a joyful heart, I began the world again—and this, Sir, was the firſt effectual boow I ever made, till the vanity of human nature.—Now, Sir, d'ye underſtand this doctrine?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Egert.</speaker>
                  <p>Perfectly well, Sir.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Pert.</speaker>
                  <p>Ay, boot was it not right? Was it not ingenious, and weel hit off?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Egert.</speaker>
                  <p>Extremely well, Sir.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Pert.</speaker>
                  <p>My next boow, Sir, was till your ain meether, whom I ran away wi fra the boarding ſchool—by the intereſt of whoſe family, I got a good ſmart place in the Treaſury—and, Sir, my vary next ſtep was in till Parliament—the whach I entered we as ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and aſs determined an ambeetion aſs ever agitated the heart o' Ceaſer himſelf!—and then, Sir, I changed my character entirely.—Sir, I bowed, and watched, and harkened, and lurked for intilligence, and ran aboot backwards and forwards, and attended, and dangled upon the then great Mon, till I got intill the very boowels of his confeedence; and then, Sir, I wriggled, and wriggled, and wrought, and wriggled till I wriggled myſelf among the vary thick o' them, till I got my ſnack of the cloathing, the foraging, the contracts, the lottery teeckets, and aw the poleetical bonuſſes—till at length, Sir I became a much weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier Mon, than one half o' the golden calves I had been ſo long a boowing to—
<stage>(he riſes, Egerton riſes too.)</stage>
And was not that boowing to ſome purpoſe, Sir?—Ha!</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Egert.</speaker>
                  <p>It was indeed, Sir.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Pert.</speaker>
                  <p>But are you convinced of the gude ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and of the uteelity of boowing?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Egert.</speaker>
                  <p>Thoroughly, Sir, thoroughly.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Pert.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, it is infaleeble—but, Chairles, ah! while I was thus boowing, and wriggling, and making
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0058901400:38"/>
a princely fortune—ah! I met many heart ſores, and diſappointments, frai the want of leeterature, ailo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and other popular abeelities Sir, guin I could hai both ſpoken i' the houſe, I ſhou'd hai done <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Sir, I determined at any expence till hai ſupplied by the poliſhed education of a Son, who, I hoped, wou'd yean day, raiſe the hoouſe of Mac Sycophant till the higheſt pannicle of meeneeſterial ambeetion.—This, Sir, is my plan, I hai done my part of it, nature has done hers—Ye are ailoquent, ye are popular—aw parties like ye—and noow, Sir<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it only remains for ye to be directed—completion fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>

                  <p>Your liberality, Sir, in my education, and the judicious choice you made of the worthy Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to whoſe virtues and abilities you entruſted me, are obligations I ſhall ever remember, with the deepeſt filial gratitude.</p>

                  <p>Ah! that's lucky; our firſt ſtep then muſt be to take her advice in our conduct, ſo as to keep our faithers in the dark, till we can bit off ſome meaſure, that wee'll wind them aboot till oor ain purpoſe, and the common intereſt of our ain paſſion.</p>

                  <p>You are very right, Madam, for ſhould my father ſuſpect my brother's affection for your Ladyſhip, or mine for Conſtantia, there is no gueſſing what would be the conſequence; his whole happineſs depends upon this bargain with my Lord, for it gives him the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of three boroughs, and thoſe, Madam, are much dearer to him, than the happineſs of his children; I am ſorry to ſay it, but to gratify his political rage, he would ſacrifice every ſocial tie that is dear to friend or family.

                  <speaker>Sir Pert.</speaker>
                  <p>But zoons, Plauſible, do you think I will gee up the nomineetion till three boroughs? Why, I would rather gee him twenty, aw thirty thooſand pounds in any either point of the bargain, eſpecially at this juncture, when votes are likely to become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable?

Why this you ſee begets a commercial intercourſe, begets friendſhip betwixt us, and in a day or two theſe men gang, and give me their ſuffrages.—Noow, pray, Sir, can ye, or any lawyer, divine, or caſuiſt, caw this a bribe? hai, Sir? in fair poleetical reaſoning, it is ainly gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity on the ain ſide, and gratitude on the other—So, Sir, let me hai nai mair of your releegious or philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical refinements; but prepare, attend, and ſpeak to the queſtion, or ye are nai ſon of mine; Sir, I inſiſt on it.</p>
