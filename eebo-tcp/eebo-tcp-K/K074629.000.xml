            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IF the author ſhould ſay, he did not heartily approve of compoſitions of this kind, or admire the conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſtanza, or think the more highly of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for clothing his thoughts in the phraſeology of Spenſer; it might be aſked, what induced him to write the following poem? and how he came to lay it before the public? As to the firſt queſtion, it owes its birth to accident alone. As to the ſecond, he frankly owns, that he flattered himſelf ſome merit would be found in it, independent of the uncouth manner and antiquated dreſs in which it was to appear: and this only he is ſenſible can juſtify the publication of it to a reader of taſte and diſcernment.</p>
            <p>It may be proper perhaps juſt to mention the prior part of the fable, of which this is to be ſuppoſed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. In the 9th Canto of the 2d Book of the Fairy Queen, <hi>Guyon</hi> and <hi>Arthur</hi> journeying together, arrive at the caſtle of <hi>Alma,</hi> which they find beſieged by <hi>Malaeger</hi> and his crew, whom they engage, and put to the rout. They are courteouſly received by <hi>Alma,</hi> who ſhews them her caſtle. In the chamber of <hi>Memory</hi> they find two books, one called, <hi>The Briton Moniments;</hi> the other, <hi>The Antiquity of Fairy Lond;</hi> an account of theſe

takes up the 10th Canto. In the 11th, <hi>Guyon</hi> departs on his adventures againſt the <hi>Bower of Bliſs,</hi> upon which the enemies of <hi>Alma,</hi> being emboldened, return to the ſiege. <hi>Arthur</hi> ſallies out againſt them, and after a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere engagement overcomes their chief, by ſqueezing him to death. His ſquire brings him back to the caſtle covered with wounds:</p>
            <q>
               <l>Where many grooms and ſquires ready were,</l>
               <l>To take him from his ſteed full tenderly;</l>
               <l>And eke the faireſt Alma met him there</l>
               <l>With balm, and wine, and coſtly ſpicerie,</l>
               <l>To comfort him in his infirmitie:</l>
               <l>Eftſoons ſhe caus'd him up to be convey'd,</l>
               <l>And of his arms deſpoiled eaſily;</l>
               <l>In ſumptuous bed ſhe made him to be laid,</l>
