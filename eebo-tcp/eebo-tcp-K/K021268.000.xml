            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN the following Comedy, my purpoſe was, to draw a FEMALE CHARACTER, which with the moſt lively Senſibility, fine Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and elegant Accompliſhments, ſhould unite that beautiful Reſerve and Delicacy which, whilſt they veil thoſe charms, render them ſtill more intereſting. In delineating ſuch a Character, my heart naturally dedicated it to YOUR MAJESTY; and nothing remained, but permiſſion to lay it at Your feet. Your Majeſty's graciouſly allowing me this high Honour, is the point to which my hopes aſpired, and a reward, of which without cenſure I may be proud.</p>

                  <p>I was informed a few days ſince, that my couſins Fallow were come to town, and deſired earneſtly to ſee me at their lodgings in Warwick-Court, Holborn. Away drove I, painting them all the way as ſo many Hebes. They came from the fartheſt part of Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, had never been in town, and in courſe were made up of ruſticity, innocence, and beauty.</p>

Lord, couſin, I am glad you are come!

                  <p>No! ſhe ſhould have ſpirit! fire! <hi>l'air enjoué!</hi> that ſomething, that nothing, which every body feels, and which no body can deſcribe, in the reſiſtleſs charmers of Italy and France.</p>

                  <p>Thanks to the parſimony of my father, that kept me from travel! I would not have loſt my reliſh for true unaffected Engliſh beauty, to have been quarrell'd for by all the Belles of Verſailles and Florence.</p>

                  <p>Pho! thou haſt no taſte. <hi>Engliſh</hi> beauty! 'Tis inſipidity; it wants the zeſt, it wants poignancy, Frank! Why, I have known a Frenchwoman, indebted to nature for no one thing but a pair of decent eyes, reckon in her ſuite as many Counts, Marquiſſes, and <hi>Petits Maî<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres,</hi> as would ſatisfy three dozen of our firſt-rate toaſts. I have known an Italian <hi>Marquizina</hi> make ten conqueſts in ſtepping from her carriage, and carry her ſlaves from one city to another, whoſe real intrinſic beauty would have yielded to half the little <hi>Griſettes</hi> that pace your Mall on a Sunday.</p>

                  <speaker>Doric.</speaker>
                  <p>If ſhe has, ſhe was pleaſed to keep it to herſelf. I was in the room half an hour before I could catch the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1182700800:13"/>
colour of her eyes; and every attempt to draw her into converſation occaſioned ſo cruel an embarraſſment, that I was reduced to the neceſſity of news, French fleets, and Spaniſh captures, with her father.</p>

Have I not heard a thouſand times of my air, my eyes, my ſhape — all made for victory! and to-day, when I bent my whole heart on one poor cooqueſt, I have proved that all thoſe imputed charms amount to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;—for Doricourt ſaw them unmov'd.—A huſband of fifteen months could not have examin'd me with more cutting indifference.</p>

                  <p>Aye, there's the ſting! The blooming boy, who left his image in my young heart, is at four and twenty improv'd in every grace that fix'd him there. It is the ſame face that my memory, and my dreams, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly painted to me; but its graces are finiſhed, and every beauty heightened. How mortifying, to feel my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at the ſame moment his ſlave, and an object of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect indifference to him!</p>

                  <p>I am ſorry you was ſuch a fool. Can you expect a man, who has courted and been courted by half the fine women in Europe, to feel like a girl from a boarding-ſchool? He is the prettieſt fellow you have ſeen, and in courſe bewilders your imagination; but he has ſeen a million of pretty women, child, before he ſaw you; and his firſt feelings have been over long ago.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
                  <p>True; but ſhe has a ſimplicity of heart and manners, that would have become the fair Hebrew dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels toaſted by the Patriarchs.</p>

                  <p>Common—common— <stage>contemptuouſly</stage>. No, Sir, Lady Frances deſpiſes high life ſo much from the ideas I have given her, that ſhe'll live in it like a ſala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in fire.</p>

                  <p>Pſha! I didn't think on what I was ſaying; I meant ſupper—You can't ſup with us?</p>

                  <p>Why, ſupper will be rather more convenient than dinner—But you are fortunate—if you had aſk'd me any other night, I could not have come.</p>

                  <p>Why look ye, Sir George, 'tis very plain you have no inclination to let me ſee your wife at all; ſo here I ſit <stage>throws himſelf on a ſopha.</stage>—There's my hat, and here are my legs.—Now I ſha'n't ſtir till I have ſeen her; and I have no engagements: I'll breakfaſt, dine, and ſup with you every day this week.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
                  <p>Was there ever ſuch a provoking wretch! But, to be plain with you, Doricourt, I and my houſe are at your ſervice: but you are a damn'd agreeable fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and ten years younger than I am; and the women, I obſerve, always ſimper when you appear. For theſe reaſons, I had rather, when Lady Frances and I are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that you ſhould forget we are acquainted, further than a nod, a ſmile, or a how-d'ye.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Doric.</speaker>
                  <p>Very well.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
                  <p>It is not merely yourſelf <hi>in propriâ perſanâ</hi> that I object to; but, if you are intimate here, you'll make my houſe ſtill more the faſhion than it is; and it is already ſo much ſo, that my doors are of no uſe to me. I married Lady Frances to engroſs her to myſelf; yet ſuch is the bleſſed freedom of modern manners, that, in ſpite of me, her eyes, thoughts, and converſation, are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually divided amongſt all the Flirts and Coxcombs of Faſhion.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Doric.</speaker>
                  <p>To be ſure, I confeſs that kind of freedom is carried rather too far. 'Tis hard one can't have a jewel in one's cabinet, but the whole town muſt be gratified with its luſtre. He ſha'n't preach me out of ſeeing his wife, though. <stage>Aſide.</stage>

In her mind, every ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment gives place to the Luſt of Conqueſt, and the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of being particular. The feelings of Wife, and Mother, are loſt in the whirl of diſſipation.

In her manner ſhe is free, in her morals nice. Her behaviour is undiſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhingly polite to her Huſband, and all mankind;—her ſentiments are for their hours of retirement. In a word, a Fine Lady is the life of converſation, the ſpirit of ſociety, the joy of the public!—Pleaſure follows where ever ſhe appears, and the kindeſt wiſhes attend her ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.

                  <p>Heaven and earth! with whom can a man truſt his wife, in the preſent ſtate of ſociety? Formerly there were diſtinctions of character amongſt ye: every claſs of females had its particular deſcription; Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothers were pious, Aunts diſcreet, Old Maids cenſorious! but now aunts, grandmothers, girls, and maiden gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women, are all the ſame creature;—a wrinkle more or leſs is the ſole difference between ye.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
                  <p>Indeed it is—and ranked amongſt the moſt ſerious grievances.—Things went well, Madam, when the tongues at three or four old Virgins kept all the Wives

                  <p>Very well,—very well.—This morning will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to curioſity; my ſale begins to-morrow at eleven. But, Mrs. Fagg, if you do no better than you did in Lord Fillagree's ſale, I ſhall diſcharge you. — You want a knack terribly: and this dreſs—why, nobody can miſtake you for a Gentlewoman.</p>

                  <p>Very true, Mr. Silvertongue; but I can't dreſs like a Lady upon Half-a-crown a day, as the ſaying is— If you want me to dreſs like a Lady, you muſt double my pay.—Double or quits, Mr. Silvertongue.</p>

                  <p>—<hi>Five Shillings</hi> a day! what a demand! Why, Woman, there are a thouſand Parſons in the town, who
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1182700800:36"/>
don't make Five Shilllings a day; though they preach, pray, chriſten, marry, and bury, for the Good of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity.—Five Shillings a day!—why, 'tis the pay of a Lieutenant in a marching Regiment, who keeps a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, a Miſtreſs, a Horſe; fights, dreſſes, ogles, makes love, and dies upon Five Shillings a day.</p>

I talk of the relief of Woovermans, the ſpirit of Teniers, the colouring of the Venetian School, and the correctneſs of the Roman. I diſtinguiſh Claude by his Sleep, and Ruyſdael by his Water. The rapidity of Tintoret's pencil ſtrikes me at the firſt glance; whilſt the harmony of Vandyk, and the glow of Correggio, point out their Maſters.</p>

This elegant Manſion on the left, decorated with Corinthian pillars — who needs be told that it belongs to a Court Lord, and is the habitation of Patriotiſm, Philoſophy, and Virtue? Here's a City Hall—the rich ſteams that iſſue from the windows, nouriſh a neighbouring Work-Houſe. Here's a Church— we'll paſs over that, the doors are ſhut.

Aye, that's it—I'll be Cunning Little Iſaac! If they complain of my want of wit, I'll tell 'em the curſed Duenna wears the breeches, and has ſpoilt my parts. <stage>

                  <speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>

                  <p>Yielded herſelf up to the World! Why did you not bring her to town in a Cage? Then ſhe might have taken a peep at the World!—But, after all, what has the World done? A twelvemonth ſince you was the gayeſt fellow in it:—If any body aſk'd who dreſſes beſt?—Sir George Touchwood.—Who is the moſt gallant Man? Sir George Touchwood.—Who is the moſt wedded to Amuſement and Diſſipation? Sir George Touchwood.— And now Sir George is metamorphoſed into a ſour Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor; and talks of Faſhionable Life with as much bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as the old crabbed Fellow in Rome.</p>

                  <p>The moment I became poſſeſſed of ſuch a jewel as Lady Frances, every thing wore a different complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion: that Society in which I liv'd with ſo much <hi>éclat,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the object of my terror; and I think of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Polite Life, as I do of the atmoſphere of a Peſt-houſe.—My Wife is already infected; ſhe was ſet upon this morning by Maids, Widows, and Bachelors, who carried her off in triumph, in ſpite of my diſpleaſure.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Vill.</speaker>
                  <p>Aye, to be ſure; there would have been no triumph in the caſe, if you had not oppos'd it:—but I have heard the whole ſtory from Mrs. Rackett; and I aſſure you, Lady Frances didn't enjoy the morning at all;—ſhe wiſh'd for you fifty times.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
                  <p>I have a Siſter, Saville, who is amiable; and you are worthy of her, I ſhall give her a commiſſion to ſteal your heart, out of revenge for what you have done.</p>

                  <p>I am infinitely honoured, Sir George; but —</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
                  <p>I cannot liſten to a ſentence which begins with ſo unpromiſing a word. You muſt go with us into Hampſhire; and, if you ſee each other with the eyes I do, your felicity will be complete. I know no one, to whoſe heart I would ſo readily commit the care of my Siſter's happineſs.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Sav.</speaker>
                  <p>I will attend you to Hampſhire, with pleaſure; but not on the plan of retirement. Society has claims on Lady Frances, that forbid it.</p>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sav.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, claims; Lady Frances was born to be the ornament of Courts. She is ſufficiently alarmed, not to wander beyond the reach of her Protector;—and, from the Britiſh Court, the moſt tenderly-anxious Huſband could not wiſh to baniſh his Wife. Bid her keep in her eye the bright Example who preſides there; the ſplendour of whoſe rank yields to the ſuperior luſtre of her Virtue.</p>

It was a ſtrange perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Taſte, that led me to conſider the delicate timidity of your deportment, as the mark of an uninform'd mind, or inelegant manners. I feel now it is to that innate modeſty, <hi>Engliſh</hi> Huſbands owe a felicity the Married Men of other nations are ſtrangers to: it is a ſacred veil to your own charms; it is the ſureſt bulwark to your Huſband's honour; and curſed be the hour—ſhould it ever arrive— in which <hi>Britiſh</hi> Ladies ſhall ſacrifice to <hi>foreign Graces</hi> the Grace of Modeſty!</p>

            <l>NAY ceaſe, and hear me—I am come to ſcold—</l>
            <l>Whence this night's plaudits, to a thought ſo old?</l>
            <l>To gain a Lover, hid behind a Maſk!</l>
            <l>What's new in that? or where's the mighty taſk?</l>
            <l>For inſtance, now—What Lady Bab, or Grace,</l>
            <l>E'er won a Lover—in her <hi>natural</hi> Face?</l>
            <l>Miſtake me not—French red, or blanching creams,</l>
            <l>I ſtoop not to—for thoſe are hackney'd themes;</l>
            <l>The arts I mean, are harder to detect,</l>
            <l>Eaſier put on, and worn to more effect;—</l>
            <l>As thus —</l>
            <l>Do Pride and Envy, with their horrid lines,</l>
            <l>Deſtroy th' effect of Nature's ſweet deſigns?</l>
            <l>The Maſk of Softneſs is at once applied,</l>
            <l>And gentleſt manners ornament the Bride.</l>
            <l>Do thoughts too free inform the Veſtal's eye,</l>
            <l>Or point the glance, or warm the ſtruggling ſigh?</l>
            <l>Not Dian's brows more rigid looks diſcloſe;</l>
            <l>And Virtue's bluſh appears, where Paſſion glows.</l>
            <l>And you, my gentle Sirs, wear Vizors too;</l>
            <l>But here I'll ſtrip you, and expoſe to view</l>
            <l>Your hidden features—Firſt I point at you.</l>
            <l>That well-ſtuff'd waiſtcoat, and that rudily check;</l>
            <l>That ample forehead, and that ſkin ſo ſleek,</l>
            <l>Point out good-nature, and a gen'rous heart—</l>
            <l>Tyrant! ſtand forth, and, conſcious, own thy part:</l>
            <l>Thy Wife, thy Children, tremble in thy eye;</l>
            <l>And Peace is baniſh'd —when the <hi>Father</hi>'s nigh.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:1182700800:89"/>Sure 'tis enchantment! See, from ev'ry ſide</l>
            <l>The Maſks fall off!—In charity I hide</l>
            <l>The monſtrous features ruſhing to my view—</l>
            <l>Fear not, there, Grand-Papa—nor you—nor you:</l>
            <l>For ſhould I ſhew your features to each other,</l>
            <l>Not one amongſt ye'd know his Friend, or Brother.</l>
            <l>'Tis plain, then, all the world, from Youth to Age,</l>
