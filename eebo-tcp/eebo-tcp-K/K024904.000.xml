            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>I Have peruſed a Pamphlet entitled, <hi>Some Reaſons why the Practice of Inoculation ought to be introduced into the Town of</hi> Bury <hi>at Preſent,</hi> and have been ſurprized to find this elaborate Piece ſo little in Subſtance, and ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to the Purpoſe: Inſomuch that at the firſt, I determined on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to point out, and expoſe the Miſtakes of it in Converſation, being under a full Perſwaſion and Conviction, that the Author would <hi>Triumph neither a Week nor a Day,</hi> but that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject <hi>would</hi> very ſoon <hi>end in Confuſion.</hi> Being ſince reminded of a warm Reſolution made by me, to oppoſe any Efforts to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive a Practice ſo juſtly exploded and condemned by all rational Men, I have changed my Mind, and ſet Pen to Paper; but if a Promiſe to anſwer an Author before I knew the weight and Strength of his Arguments, may be by <hi>ſome</hi> thought Raſhneſs and Prejudice, I hope an Abhorrence I have of a Practice ſo cruel, unſafe, and uncertain to Mankind, an impartial Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and full Acquaintance of what has been advanced pro and con, and a great Diffidence of the Author's Abilities to ſupport it, may to <hi>others</hi> clear me from the Imputation of Raſhneſs and Prepoſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>THIS barbarous and dangerous Invention was about 10 Years paſt imported at <hi>London</hi> from <hi>Turkey;</hi> the Curioſity like many other <hi>foreign</hi> Monſters pleaſed at firſt, but ſoon after grew un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governable by it's own Maſters, and when let looſe, made great Havock and Slaughter. But after all the Difficulties and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0205300900:2"/>it was endeavoured to be buoy'd up by <hi>able</hi> Hands which undertook to prove that this <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Method of Inoculation, might ſafely and ſecurely be practiſed in our Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and upon our Conſtitutions, and that a <hi>Circaſſian</hi> Impiety of bringing Diſeaſes upon ourſelves was reconcileable to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Conſcience.</p>
            <p>BUT in ſpight of all ſuch Aids, and Supports, it daily ſunk into diſuſe and contempt, and of late has ſcarce been menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned amongſt Us, till our Author on a reliance of his mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Skill, and a thorough Acquaintance with the Doctrine of Chances, undertook to ſtrike a new Light, to open our Eyes, and by plain and eaſy Calculations, to evince the Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs and Security of it, <hi>even to a Demonſtration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VAIN Deluſion! For if many have died in <hi>London,</hi> when the Inciſions were made by the moſt skillful Hands, and under the Care and Direction of the moſt Eminent <hi>Regular</hi> Phyſicians What (may we ſuppoſe) will be the Conſequence? What a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic Scene ſhall we have? when this Practice ſhall be brought into the Country, and committed to common Hands, Men of leſs Abilities and no Experience; but from hence it appears, <hi>Providence has given ſome Perſons Heads to contrive, and Hands to execute any thing that will ſerve their own Advantage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT to proceed to my Undertaking of an Anſwer, which I ſhall do by giving my Opinion of the Tract in general, and then make ſome Remarks upon the Obſervations, Calculations, and Arguments in particular.</p>
            <p>IN the general View I obſerve three Things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A ſpecious Pretext of a tender Concern for the Detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all Trade, and <hi>perhaps loſs of Aſſizes, Seſſions,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0205300900:3"/>Fairs, and other publick Meetings,</hi> which is a popular Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Tradeſmen of the Town. But here I muſt obſerve, that this Practice was endeavoured to be introduced, when only a Perſon or two had the <hi>Small Pox</hi> when the variolous Matter was to be purchaſed at a <hi>dear</hi> Rate, and all the Tradeſmen were very active and vigilant, to prevent its ſpreading. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever 'twas very neceſſary that this artful Addreſs to the Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, ſhould appear glittering at the Top to engage their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, but unluckily <hi>Self-ſerving</hi> pops up in the Middle, and <hi>Self-regard</hi> lurks and skulks at the Bottom. But this is not the only Inſtance of his Fondneſs of being thought <hi>Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body,</hi> for the Reader muſt be acquainted with his Converſation with Dr. <hi>Jurin</hi> at the Coffee-houſe, and his Correſpondence with Dr. <hi>Nettleton</hi> when he was at <hi>Newark.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. HIS Submiſſion of the <hi>Buſineſs of his Paper to the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi> is reſpectful, but deſigning, and perhaps the Gentlemen of that Order are very little oblig'd to him for his Compliment, for I am very much miſtaken if many of them are not able to give more Reaſons than are founded upon a Suppoſition that the Practice does not <hi>promote our Lives, Healths, and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,</hi> but in Caſuiſtry are convinced that the Practice is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptious and ſinful; but as to the Morality of it, ſhall refer him to thoſe Gentlemen he ſhall have the Honour to have farther Converſe with.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I OBSERVE his Arguments are old, ſtale, and borrow'd, and that he has choſe <hi>ſome Reaſons</hi> out of many, very injudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly; for he has offer'd the Weakeſt and left the moſt Enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ing. Does this ill Choice proceed from want of Judgment? To preſume that, by his Friends would be interpreted a Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my own; I will rather then imagine that he writes with great Cunning and Policy, and has been taught by ſome military Man a ſtratagem in War, <hi>viz.</hi> To place ſometimes the weakeſt of his Forces in the Front, and ſpare his braveſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0205300900:4"/>Men to do the moſt Execution, for which Reaſon, and under which Caution, I ſhall reſerve my Veterans till we come to a cloſer Engagement.</p>
            <p>I NOW proceed to conſider his Obſervations, Calculations, and Arguments in particular.</p>

               </bibl> If Inoculation was generally practiſed— we need not have it ſix Months.</q>
            <p>IF this Limitation of the Small Pox to ſix Months be true it muſt be ſo, becauſe by an Elegancy of Stile, the Author can perſwade all the Timorous to undergo an Operation they think dangerous, and by his Caſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>iſtry can prevail upon the Scrupulous to enter upon an Action they believe Sinful, and can be ſecure upon Inoculation of producing any variolous Symptoms and Puſtules, and beſides all this has by his irrefraga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Arguments, proved a general Inoculation an infallible Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative againſt the Diſtemper in a natural Way. Now if I could imagine this to be Fact, yet I would not dare to aſſert and fix ſo exact a Time as <hi>of ſix Months</hi> for its Continuance. But I am fully aſſured he has not removed the Apprehenſions of the Fearful, or ſatisfied the Doubts of the Conſcientious, nor even promiſed to produce the Diſtemper by Inoculation in every Caſe, nor given good Reaſons of ſecurity againſt the Small Pox in a natural Way after Inoculation; to ſay then we need not have it <hi>ſix Months,</hi> is downright Arrogance and Preſumption.</p>

                  <hi>ART. II.P. 3.</hi>
               </bibl> As the utmoſt Hazard of dying of the ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated Small Pox appears by the laſt authentic Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, to be no more than that of <hi>1</hi> in <hi>50,</hi> and by the ſame Accounts, that of dying of the Natural is ſhewn to be that of <hi>1</hi> in <hi>6.</hi>
            </q>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0205300900:5"/>
            <p>IN this Article our Author appears a Man of as great Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, as in the firſt of Eloquence, and thoſe Gentlemen and Townſmen that have not been perſwaded into a good Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Inoculation by 12 Lines of unanimated Oratory, are to be over-powered by a Demonſtration of Numbers. Let us then ſuppoſe that there are 10,000 Perſons in <hi>Bury,</hi> and but 3 of theſe have any Confidence in the Practice, there will remain 9997 clearly unſatisfied in Inoculation upon this Suppoſition. But ſince this Article is wrote to perſwade the Wiſe, and deceive the Simple, and is the Baſis of all the reſt, I may be thought unſeaſonably Drolling, where I ſhould be ſeriouſly Arguing.</p>
            <p>THE ſtrength and force of this Reaſon depends on the Truth of the Accounts, and what I have to ſay to their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticneſs will be this; the Computations from the Tables are <hi>arithmetically</hi> True and Juſt, but as many Facts have been partially epreſented, many material Circumſtances, which made againſt the Practice, were then ſuppreſſed; as the moving De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations of the dying Patients, and as ſome Miſcarriages by Inoculation were never tranſmitted to the Calculator, all which I think can be made evident beyond Contradiction, in ſuch Caſe the Accounts are ſo far from deſerving an <hi>authentick</hi> Character, that they are mere Impoſitions. I ſay not this to aſperſe the Author of thoſe Accounts, for if I underſtand who is meant, I honour his Learning and Judgment, and have a great Opinion of his Integrity, and believe he uſed an honeſt Diligence to ſtate the Account right, but his Correſpondents a diſingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Induſtry to deceive him. And here I muſt obſerve, that worthy Gentleman promiſed that he would acquaint the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic with the Progreſs of this Practice from Year to Year, till it ſhould be firmly eſtabliſhed or juſtly exploded. But whether from a Diſcovery of the Suppreſſions on one ſide, or the Miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations on the other, he ſound it impracticable to do it with impartiality; or from a general Diſcredit the Method of Inoculation ſoon fell into, he found it uſeleſs, I am not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0205300900:6"/>to determine, but know of none he has publiſh'd for many Years paſt.</p>
            <p>BUT for once I will ſuppoſe the Account authentic, and admit that every Fact was truly, exactly, and faithfully repreſented, and every individual Miſcarriage was tranſmitted to the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culator at the juncture of Time when the Supputation was made; Yet ſurely our Author's Induſtry in getting freſh Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, or his Integrity in concealing what he received, or the little Acquaintance he has with Men of our Profeſſion muſt be called in Queſtion; becauſe he takes no Notice of ſeveral un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Families, ſome of whoſe Branches died miſerable Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to this inhumane Practice, long ſince the Date of his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic Tables. To deny ſuch Facts, ſo well atteſted is <hi>Fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nt,</hi> and to call them <hi>Forgeries</hi> is taking an unwarrantable Liberty with the Character of Witneſſes, for which reaſon I ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear laying before him ſome authentic Original Papers on this Subject, tranſmitted to me by Perſons of good Faſhion, and of undoubted and unqueſtionable Credit, till ſuch time as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſhall creep out of his Ambuſcade, and ſhall freely and openly declare upon what Iſſue he will put this Diſpute. I can eaſily believe Dr. <hi>Jurin</hi> gave our Author ſuch a cautious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to his Query, and encouraged the Practice by Inoculating his own Child, and am as fully perſwaded the Doctor was ſo Ingenuous as to tell him, how Tragically the Practice ended in another Family about that Time, where 2 out of 2, died by Inoculation, which were under his Care.</p>
            <p>BUT to proceed; As I am willing to make our Author all poſſible Conceſſions, I will grant him that not only his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts are truly Authentic, but that they have been carried down to the preſent Time, even to Yeſterday, and that the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation ſtands that only 1 in 50 have died by Inoculation. Happy thoſe who have by ſuch a lucky Chance, met at once their Death and end of all their Miſeries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For are there not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0205300900:7"/>many lamentable Spectacles juſt alive who have been Inocula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, many dreadful Images of Death, Monuments of Terror to any that are capable of Fear? If this be the Caſe, I cannot but compaſſionate the Condition of even thoſe that have ſurvived the Operation, and <hi>what the Inoculators call,</hi> Recovered. But I ſhall conſider this Point more hereafter, and now go on to the Accounts of the Fatality of the natural Infection. And here tho' I could lay down ſeveral Calculations made in different Parts, widely differing from our Author's <hi>laſt Accounts,</hi> yet as I am ſenſible how ready ſome Perſons are to embrace all Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of Cavil and Objection, and perhaps would inſinuate that ſuch diſtant Supputation cannot be rely'd on; To put the Matter out of Queſtion, I have been at the Expence and Trouble to make a <hi>Local</hi> one, whereby it appeared that <hi>Jan.</hi> 28, 1683 Perſons had had the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> out of which Number 124 died, but as it evidently appears to me that many may, and ought to be deducted out of this Account of the deceas'd, I ſhall ſubmit the following Particulars to our Author's and the Reader's Peruſal and Conſideration.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Probably died for want of proper Phyſic, Attendance, Suſtenance, and even Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, notwithſtanding the extraordinary <hi>Charity</hi> of ſome Gentlemen, and the great Care of the Magiſtrates, and Officers. 35</item>
               <item>Abortives ſuppoſed to have died of the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> becauſe the Mother had it. 6</item>
               <item>Suppoſed to have died of the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> without having any Eruption. 3</item>
               <item>Men and Women died of the <hi>Small Pox</hi> between 60 and 70. 5</item>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0205300900:8"/>
               <item>Dy'd of the natural Sort, ſuch as the Inoculators would not have practiſed upon, as appears by their Cautions, which ſee hereafter <hi>in Page</hi> 12. 30</item>
               <item>In all 79</item>
            </list>
            <p>IF this Reduction be allowed me, then the Proportion will be conſiderably altered, and that it may, and ought, is evident to any that will conſider how few have died in Families where there was tolerable Care taken, and proper Medicines and Methods of Cure followed. I could indeed further convince our Author of Miſ-calculation, when he ſays 1 in 6 died, but it muſt be in a Way moſt diſagreeable to myſelf, for I ſhould ſubject myſelf to the Imputation of Oſtentation, when I tell him that out of the great Numbers which I have attended <hi>ab Origine,</hi> not 1 in 70 have died under my Care; but to make him amends for ſuch ſuppoſed Vanity, I will inform him, that, under Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the Succeſs lay in a previous Care, and ſuch Rules of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement I gave to the Perſons, which in a general Infection I ſuppoſed probably might ſoon receive it.</p>
            <p>BUT to return; and make our Author farther Allowances, and totally reject this Reduction, yet after all 'twill not appear the Calculation ſtands good: but ſhall leave and requeſt him to conſider the Proportion between 124 and 1683. To this I am really at a loſs to conceive what he will ſay, unleſs it be what he Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally inſinuated to me, that many Errors and Miſtakes were made by the Perſons who took the Supputation, which put me to a ſecond Trouble, to make a Review and Re-examination of the Matter, which was compared with the Church Books or Clerk's Accounts, and upon the Whole I ſound the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences very immaterial; But to give our Author all poſſible Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, I will indulge him what Numbers he thinks reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0205300900:9"/>for Miſtakes, tho' I am not acquainted with one. Yet I cannot but obſerve that a very material Impoſition was offered me from the <hi>Houſe</hi> where this mighty Project was laid and is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aily carried on, by a falſe Repreſentation that Four had had it and Two died, whereas only One had it who recovered; What Motives could induce a Man of no great Sagacity or reach of Thought to give this Account, I ſhall not determine.</p>
            <p>'TIS now high Time to diſmiſs this Article, I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore only add, that ſuppoſing the Accounts with regard to the inoculated and natural Sort to be Authentic and <hi>True,</hi> yet our new Introducer of this Method lies under, in my Opinion, two inſuperable Difficulties.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THO' I grant him the Numbers given, yet be has not proved that this artificial Eruption is a preſervative againſt a natural One, ſo that ſome who have ſubmitted themſelves to be practiſed upon by theſe <hi>Schematiſts</hi> may fall a Sacrifice to the providential Infection.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I WILL fairly ſuppoſe that ſome Perſons will never have the Small Pox. Now if the Inoculators ſhould practiſe upon ſuch a one, (and for ought they know they may) and the Patient die, and 'tis Preſumption to ſay he ſhall not. What Name ſhall I give the Fact? What can be ſaid to alleviate the Sorrows of the ſurviving Relations? That the Inoculators are Principals of, and the Friends Acceſſories to a <hi>horrid, wicked Act,</hi> is poor Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation.</p>
            <q>
               <bibl>
                  <hi>ART. II.P. 4.</hi>
               </bibl> It is to be obſerved that the inoculated Small Pox has been found to be as favourable to grown People as to Children.</q>
            <p>MONSTROUS is this Obſervation! How many of the Inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators ſhall I produce as Evidences to the Contrary? To ſtumble
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0205300900:10"/>at firſt ſetting out is certainly an ill Omen, and let him be careful that he makes no more falſe ſteps, leaſt he Tumble down.</p>
            <p>Is it not well known that the Operators were ſo Diffident of Succeſs, that they choſe Children as Objects of their Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and whenever they ventured upon grown Perſons, were they not curious in their Choice?</p>
            <p>Is it not a ſecret Caution amongſt 'em not to admit <hi>Women with Child.</hi> 2. <hi>Such to whoſe Families the Small Pox uſed to be fatal.</hi> 3. <hi>Such as are extremcly Fearful, Fanciful,</hi> Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteric or Hypocondriac. 4. <hi>Such as are of choleric Conſtitutions, are apt to Fevers, inflammatory Affections, Pleariſy, Eryſipelas,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and ſuch as have lately ſurfeited and over-heated themſelves with</hi> Bacchus, <hi>or</hi> Venus, <hi>or great Labour.</hi> 5. <hi>Such as uſe to ſpit Blood or have over-much Catamenia.</hi> 6. <hi>Such as have a Phthiſic, Conſumption, Hectic-Fever,</hi> &amp;c. 7. <hi>Such as have the King's Evil, Gout:</hi> Or in Dr. <hi>Jurin</hi>'s Words; <hi>To Inoculate none but Perſons of good Habit of Body, and free not only from any Apparent, but as far as may be judged from any</hi> LATENT <hi>Diſeaſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How many then of both Sexes by theſe Exemptions are diſcharged from the Danger, or not entitled to the Benefit of Inoculation, is an Inference obvious to every Reader; I would therefore (in Mr. <hi>Howgrave</hi>'s Words) ask theſe learned Mimicks of a few Ignorant <hi>Greek</hi> Women two Queſtions. 1. Whether Inoculation is not the moſt Gentle and ſafe Manner of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Small Pox;</hi> and 2dly, Whether a Perſon of a weak Conſtitution, or bad Habit of Body, be not as liable (if not more) to receive the <hi>Small Pox</hi> by Inſection, as the moſt Healthful can be? The former Queſtion they will anſwer in the Affirmative, and the Latter I am conſident they cannot deny. If this be the Caſe, and Ino<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>lation be gentler and ſafer, weak
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0205300900:11"/>and diſordered Perſons ought of all others to be incoulated, as leſs able to bear the more hazardous Effects of the natural Sort.</p>
            <p>THE next Obſervation, P. 5. ſhews the Author has not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered his firſt Trip, but is ſtill ſtaggering on; for ſays he, it is alſo to be obſerved, <hi>all thoſe who have not had the</hi> Small Pox, <hi>and reſolve to continue in the Town, muſt almoſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> have it now. I would willingly underſtand what is meant by that accurate Expreſſion, All-<hi>muſt Almoſt certainly. Almoſt</hi> joined with <hi>muſt have it now,</hi> breaks the Neceſſity of ſome having it at all, if connected with <hi>certainly,</hi> weakens the Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of it. But I ſtand not upon this Criticiſm, ſince as a <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marian</hi> he may be right, yet that he is wrong in the Suppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation will appear by the Account here given.</p>
            <p>THE 3d Article, P. 5. is introduced with an aſtoniſhing Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to all the Rules of Reaſon, and all the reſtraints of Truth, and cloſes with a ſingle Inſtance of an uncommon Slaughter that the <hi>Small Pox</hi> made at <hi>Uxbridge;</hi> For ſays he, <hi>A favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Sort, produces a favourable Sort, a Malignant, a malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant One;</hi> and then the Author with a magiſterial Air, lays down a notorious falſe Aſſertion. <hi>This is certain in Inocula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Surprizing Confidence! 'Tis true indeed, the firſt Inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators did boaſt as much, yet the many Inſtances of the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Sort from a diſtinct Sort, obliged them modeſtly to yield what they could not maintain.</p>
            <p>I HAVE always thought that a malignant or a favourable Sort proceeded from the Diſpoſition of the Blood and Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Perſon receiving the Contagion; if this wants Proof, the different Sorts which have been produced in many Families of this Town, ſhut up and excluded from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce or Sight of any of the infected, is a Demonſtration: For <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aver it upon my own Experience, I have obſerved, tho' ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0205300900:12"/>the firſt of a Family that fell down of the Diſtemper, had I will ſay, a malignant, confiuent Sort, the next the 2d, and 3d, who in all humane Probability received the poiſonous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection from this Perſon, had the Favourable and Diſtinct; and in the ſame Family, the 4th or 5th Patient ſhould have the Malignant, and ſo <hi>vice verſa,</hi> and therefore one Part of this Aſſertion, <hi>[viz.] very highly probable</hi> is falſe.</p>
            <p>LET us examine the other, which with great Boldneſs is pronounced <hi>certain in Inoculation.</hi> Now I would ask this Author whether he thus roundly aſſerts this upon his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in the Method of Inoculation; if he avers this, I am not ſuch an obſtinate Enemy to this dangerous Method as to deny Fact: But if he has not his own Experience to ſupport it, I may be allowed to tell him that the printed
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Vide</hi> The Caſe of Lord <hi>Bathurſt</hi>'s Servant, Mrs. <hi>Waller,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hugh</hi>'s Daughter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> Relations of the unexſpected Stubborneſs and Danger of this Diſtemper under the Inoculators Hands, are Convictions that the Author tramples upon the Rules of Modeſty to ſupport an ill Cauſe. If the famous Operators in this Method have not always had the Charm to raiſe a kind Sort from a mild one, but have frequently <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd</hi> up a malignant Sort which nothing but Death could <hi>bind.</hi> I would gladly know if this Gentleman has been taught this unfound Certainty in Inoculation by <hi>Inſpiration,</hi> and has honeſtly conveyed all the Secret to his Operators altogether unskilled and unacquainted in this Practice; If ſo; I am not ſo hardy as to diſpute (tho' we live in an Age not very ſond of) <hi>Inſpiration.</hi> But I expect proper Credentials, and till he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces 'em, ſhall call in Queſtion his Veracity in the next Lines, as much as I disbelieve the Certainty of his Aſſertion now. For here the Experience of old Nurſes will conſute his Reaſoning, and inform him that the <hi>Small Pox</hi> at its firſt <hi>coming into a Town is not always favourable, and as it ſpreads grows
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0205300900:13"/>more Malignant;</hi> and indeed at this very Time, <hi>viz. Febr.</hi> 20. 'tis notoriouſly otherwiſe. For they have Senſe enough to know, tho' few at its firſt Invaſion die of the Diſtemper, and a great many die when it has continued long, this is owing not to an encreaſe of a malignant Sort, but to the Number of People taking the Infection at one time greater than the other. And thus every old Woman by her Remarks and Methods of telling by her Fingers, is ready to ſay the Author's Arithmetick which comes next, amounts to o. o. o.</p>
            <p>I MUST follow him then thro' the By-Roads he takes to <hi>Uxbridge</hi> near <hi>London,</hi> where I ſtop to lament the Loſs of ſo many People who died of the <hi>Small Pox</hi> in a natural Way; and tell him that to draw an univerſal Inference from a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Inſtance, is very illogical, and unſcholarlike.</p>
            <p>ART. IV. P. 6. The laſt Reaſon, <hi>viz. the general Good of Mankind,</hi> muſt if well ſupported, bring Inoculation into Repute and Practice, and be with great Readineſs embraced by thoſe who have not diveſted themſelves of all Humanity and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence. But our Author leaves the moſt Prevailing of his Reaſons, if true, to ſtand by, and ſhift for its ſelf, for he gives it no enforcement; unleſs Dr. <hi>Jurin</hi>'s Calculation is a Support to it, but having already under the ſecond Reaſon ſhewn the In-equality of that Supputation with our Own, I ſhall add no more; but wiſh our Author had.</p>
            <p>YET I would under this Article ſay, that if Inoculation was thought ſo great a Preſervative to Mankind, We of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion might in 10 or 12 Years, have ſtudy'd the ſafe practical Part of it, and brought it to a greater Perfection then at preſent is appears in, and kept it up in greater Honour then it now maintains amongſt Us. But ſince there is ſuch Uncertainty and Inſecurity in, and ſuch a general Averſion of the People to the Operation, I am ready to believe the Inhabitants of <hi>Bury</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0205300900:14"/>will chooſe to reſign themſelves into the Hands of Providence, rather than to ſubmit to be practiſed upon, in a dangerous, painful Manner by inexpert Operators.</p>
            <p>THAT the <hi>Bark, Opium,</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> have met with Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I own, but have made their Way thro' the Indignation and Contempt of their Enemies, becauſe upon experience they have been proved uſeful Parts of the <hi>Materia Medica;</hi> theſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out queſtion in ſome Hands are very faſe, and very effectual Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, but by Miſ-application have proved very dangerous and deſtructive Ones, and yet he muſt be very Weak that Condemns the uſe of theſe and many other Medicaments, becauſe ſome <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piricks</hi> thro' <hi>Intereſt, Diſhoneſty, Ignorance or Folly,</hi> have wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly or deſignedly given them improperly. But the Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Inoculation is juſtly condemned, becauſe it is found to be unſucceſsful, inſecure, and not to anſwer the Intention.</p>
            <p>AND now I proceed to Objection the 1. P. 7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>WE are not certain that Inoculation is a Security from having the Diſtemper again.</hi> But before I examine our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Solutions of this Objection to Inoculation, give me leave to ſay, if I condemn'd his Judgment in the Choice of his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in Defence of the Practice; I will for once venture to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his Skill in picking out ſuch Objections, which he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined he could anſwer, and paſſing over many more becauſe he could not. For <hi>ſome Reaſons</hi> I beg he would be pleaſed to accept of ſome more Objections, I will not be unmerciful, but at preſent lay before him only theſe. 1. Our Climate and our Blood not ſo proper to an Operation invented and practiſed in <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Aſia.</hi> 2. No Criterion is found to know the Diſpoſition of the Blood, to receive moſt advantageouſly the purulent Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be inoculated. 3. No Proportion of the contagious Matter is agreed on by the Inoculators to do the Work ſafely. When theſe ſhall be anſwer'd, I will ask him a Queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> What
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0205300900:15"/>is the Conſequence in that Conſtitution, where Inoculation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces only an imperfect Sort, or <hi>(as they artifully expreſs it)</hi> has no Effect?</p>
            <p>I WILL now conſider his Anſwer. <hi>Several Perſons who have been Inoculated, have been made to converſe with, to handle, nurſe, lie in the ſame Bed with others ſick of the natural</hi> Pox, <hi>and no one ever had it again, as far as they that have enquired can learn.</hi> To give Force to this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Author ſlily ſuppoſes, the inoculating Method has produced a true genuine <hi>Small Pox,</hi> and as a Proof of it, ſays, all Patients by the Means of receiving the Infection he mentions, <hi>never had it again, as far as they that have enquired can learn.</hi> I will not now enter into a Diſpute, whether a true <hi>Small Pox</hi> is <hi>ever</hi> brought out by Inoculation, or lay before him well atteſted Hiſtories of Perſons <hi>Inoculated,</hi> and ſome Time after, falling down of a <hi>natural Small Pox,</hi> ſince in his ſecond Anſwer I find all theſe muſt go for <hi>Forgeries.</hi> But will tell him a Performance of all theſe kind Offices, which ſome Parents from an innate Affection to their Children have undertaken, others from a Notion of catching a kind Sort have Induſtriouſly ventured on, ſome from a Neceſſity of their Condition at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the Sick in thoſe Offices of Humanity, and eſcaping the Infection then, have Years after received the contagious Diſtemper. There are ſome in this Town who 21 Years paſt, when it was viſited with this Diſtemper ſtood clear of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe, under ſuch Tryals, but have now had it. So that upon parity of Reaſon this Part of his Anſwer is not ſound, for tho' the inoculated Patients have for ſome time ſtood the Teſt, yet they may hereafter fall, and for ought they know very ſoon into the natural <hi>Small Pox.</hi> And I am not without a Rationale of this Obſervation, which will further evidence the Weakneſs of our Author's Anſwer, and confirm the Strength of mine. There is generally agreed to be an occult Diſpoſition or Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium in the Blood to receive the <hi>Labes</hi> of this Diſeaſe, which
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0205300900:16"/>may be ſo entangled in its <hi>Sinus,</hi> and may be under ſuch a ſingular Combination of Texture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as to reſiſt the contagious Effluvia at one time, and at another may be fuſceptible of them. 2d Anſwer. <hi>Several Stories that have been invented to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the World of the Contrary, have been detected, and ſhewn to be Forgeries.</hi> If my Reader is as hard of Belief, as our Author, in Hiſtories well ſupported, which both of them may meet with in thoſe Tracts wrote 1722, 1723, and in many more ſince, I muſt leave them entrenched in their Infidelity and conſider his 3d An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. <hi>As the inoculated</hi> Small Pox <hi>is in</hi> EVERY MINUTE <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance</hi> EXACTLY <hi>like the natural One.</hi> It would be very extraordinary — <hi>if it ſhould not be like in this.</hi> This is an Aſſertion ſo ſhocking, becauſe egregiouſly falſe, that I have not Temper and Patience to ſpeak to it, but will venture to leave his own Practice, if he will allow proper Judges, as he ought to confute it, and am Confident 'tis not only Anomalous in <hi>ſome,</hi> but almoſt in <hi>every</hi> Circumſtance. Under this Head he adds. <hi>Whatever be the Reaſon why the Natural</hi> Small Pox <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves us from Infection, it is inconceiveable that the Inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated ſhould not do the ſame, for the ſame Reaſon.</hi> I will kindly offer him two or three Conjectures, which I lay no great Weight upon. 1. That we take this Diſtemper in a natural Way is moſt generally agreed, from infected Particles in the Air, and conveyed to the Lungs by Inſpiration; and then poſſibly the Veſiculae of the Lungs may undergo ſuch a Mutation and Alteration in their Contexture, as ever after to be unſuſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible of the variolous Infection; but a Transfuſion of this Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom into the Arms and Legs, will not by its Fermentation be any Preſervative at all. 2. If there be a neceſſary Concurrence and Aſſociation of the Texture, Shape, Order, and Magnitude of the Blood required to receive the Infection, this may in the Courſe of Nature meet once and never again; But this Conjunction of Circumſtances being entirely unknown to us Mortals, muſt leave the Inoculators in the Dark, and their Art inſecute. 3. The Alteration made in the Skin by the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> that is, the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0205300900:17"/>of the miliary Glands and Pores, Dr. <hi>Drake</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives to be the true Reaſon why that Diſtemper never comes a ſecond Time; And Dr. <hi>Pitcairne</hi> has obſerved, that thoſe that have taken much <hi>Mercury</hi> which dilates thoſe Pores, are not ſo ſuſceptible of a Fever, for tho' the ſame feveriſh Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition ſhould, and may ariſe in the Inſtances of the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> or after much <hi>Mercury</hi> taken, yet the Paſſages thro' the Skin being more free and open, the Matter will never be ſo ſtop'd as to raiſe the uſual Symptoms in either Caſe.</p>
            <p>BUT that this cannot be the Caſe after Inoculation, is certain both in Reaſon and Fact, for the very Practicers of it have been obliged to confeſs and acknowledge that their Method has ſometimes only produced an <hi>ingenuine or imperfect</hi> Small Pox, and have expreſs'dly granted (becauſe ſeveral Inſtances have prov'd) that ſuch <hi>artificial</hi> Ingraftment was not preventive of of a ſecond natural Crop; and 'tis farther evident as Sir <hi>Richard Blackmore</hi> obſerves, that the Seeds of the Diſeaſe are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways carried off with thoſe Impurities, which are diſcharged by Inoculation: but that thoſe falſe Eruptions may be wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt and unconcern'd with the Principles of the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> ſince they alike follow upon Inoculation, whether the Perſon has ever had, or had not that Diſtemper before. I ſhould now proceed to the 2d Objection, yet cannot but firſt obſerve our Author's artful Inſinuation, that it has been the <hi>Opinion of ſome</hi> (I ſuppoſe he means old Women) <hi>that the natural</hi> Small Pox <hi>was not an abſolute Security againſt it a ſecond Time,</hi> and then thank him that he owns this ſo <hi>rarely happens as not to deſerve Notice.</hi> A very pretty, modeſt Confeſſion! but let me tell him that I hereby call upon him to produce an Inſtance or two of this, under ſome <hi>regular Phyſician</hi>'s <hi>Hand</hi> within <hi>theſe</hi> twelve Years, the Time Inoculation has been practis'd amongſt us, and in return by way of Compliment, promiſe him for every ſuch ſingle Caſe well atteſted, to give him ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, where the natural <hi>Small Pox</hi> has came on, after the Inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0205300900:18"/>had roundly aſſerted all poſſible Security againſt it, and when I have made good this Engagement and produced ſome plain Hiſtories, I ſhall humbly beg our Author to inform me how ſtands the <hi>Proportion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I NOW proceed to the 2d Objection, which is, <hi>That the ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated</hi> Small Pox <hi>often leaves bad Conſequences, as Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Boils, and Blotches, weak Eyes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>WHOEVER is acquainted with the Rules of Controverſy (a State of Life, few that have regard to themſelves would be brought into, but many that have a concern for others may) will own how unfair that Diſputant is, who does not put the Objections againſt him in the ſtrongeſt Light, let the Event of the Diſpute be what it will. Had this Objection, now to be conſidered, been fairly propoſed, I am willing to believe, we might have recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the <hi>Fable</hi> of the Viper and the File, but rather than not anſwer all Difficulties, becauſe ſome are inſolvable, many are to be ſtifled. In this manner our Inocularian cowardly ſuppreſſes a Catalogue of Maladies which are the Conſequences of Inocula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but not of the natural <hi>Small Pox,</hi> and undauntedly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thoſe which are the Conſequences of both. However, I ſhall beg leave to enforce this Objection, by giving an Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Interpretation of the Authors <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and adding to what he has mentioned, CONTRACTED LIMBS, HEMEPLEGIES, PERPETUAL CEPHELALGIES, PHRENSIES, FATAL MORTIFICATIONS.</p>
            <p>HAS the Power of Prepoſſeſſion in favour of this Method barr'd up all the Avenues to our Author's Mind, that Truth ſhall be hindred admittance? Or are the Miſtakes of this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer owing to an excuſable Ignorance, or unpardonable Inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency? For to ſay that the natural <hi>Small Pox</hi> is apt to leave <hi>the ſame ſort</hi> of ill Conſequences is a miſtake I am poſitive, but under <hi>which ſort</hi> to place the Riſe of it. I am really at a Loſs, I had rather our Author ſhould chuſe. But if he will ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0205300900:19"/>on <hi>the ſame ſort of ill Conſequences,</hi> which he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges <hi>there</hi> are Methods which will <hi>for the moſt Part entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevent or remedy, and always do it in ſome Degree.</hi> I muſt expect of him to point me out ſome Caſes from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Sort, ſo formidable and ſo ſtubborn, that the Care and Skill of the moſt eminent Phyſicians and Chirurgeons, have been ſo far baffled and prov'd ineffectual, that they have not <hi>in any Degree</hi> been meliorated by Art; for with many of theſe I take upon me to charge Inoculation, and <hi>at a proper Time</hi> will produce my Vouchers, and if ſo, the <hi>Force of the Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is beyond his reach of Refuting. I will grant indeed our Author that the Diſorders attending the natural <hi>Small Pox</hi> principally (but not altogether) depend on a Reſorbition of the putrid Matter into the Veſſels upon the Declenſion of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe; but in the unnatural Kind, the Caſe is quite otherwiſe, for in this, all the diſmal Train of Maladies, derive their ſource and origine from Nature's Inability, to throw out the venemous, malignant Matter, or in a proper Degree to depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Blood from the Poiſon which has been implanted; and I am firmly of Opinion, that Mr. <hi>Howgrave</hi>'s Obſervation is juſt, that theſe Diſorders are the Effects of the <hi>very Operators</hi> Preparations, which are by <hi>Purging and Bleeding;</hi> for what is propoſed by <hi>Purging,</hi> if the Patient to be inoculated <hi>be not only free</hi> from any APPARENT but even any LATENT Diſeaſe; and if theſe are the only Perſons to be inoculated, which has been ſhewn, Where is the neceſſity of Phyſic or Phyſician? We know not when, or where the Patient is afflicted but by Symptoms, and if none of theſe offer themſelves, we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Body is in a good State, and if any Perſon be of ſuch a Habit of Body as to require theſe Preparations, then by their own Account, he is not a fit Subject for Inoculation. And as to <hi>Bleeding</hi> 'tis not only not neceſſary, but MUST ALLMOST CERTAINLY be prejudicial, eſpecially when the very cold Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimen is rigorouſly enjoyn'd, becauſe by theſe the Craſis of the Blood may be ſo weakned, as to render it incapable of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0205300900:20"/>throwing off the corroſive Matter, which Inoculation has for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into it. 'Tis true indeed, in the natural Sort theſe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preparative Methods, may, and frequently ought to be adviſed, for in this Caſe there will be no Danger, but that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of herſelf, or when properly aſſiſted, will effectually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject whatever is offenſive to her. Notwithſtanding what has been ſaid, I will upon ſecond Thoughts grant our Author that <hi>Preparation</hi> before the Operation, <hi>Attendance of a Phyſician, during the Diſtemper,</hi> and <hi>Care afterwards,</hi> may be very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per— <hi>if the Patient can pay well for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT to be ſerious and return to our Author who, as I before obſerved, has a magiſterial Way of laying down Poſitions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupported, but muſt here remark a Method more ſoft but not leſs affronting to his Reader, when he would <hi>ſmoothly</hi> lead him into two Miſtakes thus: <hi>One would naturally think therefore that where the moſt corrupted Matter of the worſt Kind is returned into the Blood, there the Diſorders ſucceeding the</hi> Small Pox <hi>ſhould be moſt and worſt.</hi> And again, P. 11. <hi>It is inconceivable how a Quantity of corrupted Matter falling into the Body, ſhould be the occaſion of the Diſorders ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the</hi> Small Pox, — and <hi>yet the inoculated</hi> Small Pox <hi>where there is leſs of the Matter, and of a more kindly Nature be attended with worſe Conſequences.</hi> Here are two Things ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for granted which I can by no means allow. 1. That a greater Quantity of the infectious Matter is received Naturally. And 2dly, That 'tis of a more malign Nature than what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by Inoculation. Is there any Argument to make either of theſe good? Is there any Reaſoning to evince the Truth of 'em? No; 'tis enough, <hi>Ipſe Dixit,</hi> and we muſt ſubmit to his ſuperiour Judgment, and implicitly ſwallow down his <hi>Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</hi> But with his Leave let me conſider the Nature of the Malignity of the Infection. Is our Author unacquainted with ſome Poiſons which when communicated to the Blood imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately prove fatal, but when received into the Stomach and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0205300900:21"/>ſo digeſted, are innocent and inoffenſive? May not the Viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the contagious Effluvia of the ſick and infected Things be newly modify'd by the Air, and many of the venomous <hi>Spicula,</hi> broke and blunted in their Paſſage? Whereas the Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of groſs Matter from a Puſtle is no ways ſheath'd or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunded by the Inocularian Conveyance. But when our Author <hi>perſonates</hi> a Phyſician, I have never been ſurpriz'd to find him talking very erroneouſly concerning the Quality of Diſeaſes and Remedies, but as a <hi>Geometrican</hi> I really always expected to have him very exact in any Conſideration of Quantities and Diviſibility of Matter. Let our Author then meditate a little upon the Difference between GROSS MATTER and EFFLU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIA, and if he be at a Loſs after ſuch Reflection, I wou'd refer him to Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> who will inform him that ſeveral Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are ſound to emit Effluvia for a great Number of Years, as Magnets, Electrical Bodies, Ambers, divers Odorous Bodies, the Tenuity of whoſe emanant Corpuſcles are ſo incredibly ſmall that they perceptibly loſe neither Bulk or Weight.—Or let him conſult ſome <hi>Apothecary,</hi> who will inform him how a Tun of Sack is poiſon'd and made an Emetick by a ſmall Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of <hi>Crocus Metallorum,</hi> or by the <hi>Antimonial Cup,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dimunition of its Quantity or Quality: And if theſe will not give him Satisfaction, I cou'd tell him of a worthy Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Neighbourhood which has for many Years been poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd of an Indian Stone, which immerg'd in Water, will make a generous Cordial, and in leſs than a Minutes Time; and this without any apparent Abatement of Subſtance or Quality. Now if this be the Caſe, and the Difference between groſs Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Effluvia be ſo wide, one ſingle Puſtule may contain Particles ſufficient to inſect 10000 Perſons in the Natural Way.</p>
            <p>I SHALL add no more, but conclude this Reply to our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor with informing him, ſince he ſeems to have ſo little Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with Men of our Profeſſion, that ſo many Remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and Notorious Facts have ſupported the Force of this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0205300900:22"/>that the moſt Learned and Judicious Practicers of Phyſick and Surgery, both <hi>at Home and Abroad,</hi> have totally diſcredited and rejected this Operation.</p>
            <p>Obj. 3. P. 13. <hi>By Inoculation we may communicate other Diſtempers.</hi> Whether I was in the right when I commended our Author's Skill in chooſing Objections againſt Inoculation, becauſe he thought he cou'd anſwer them, I know not, but am certain this Objection is founded upon ſolid Reaſon; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by Experience, and is ſo formidable to the Practice, that if our Introducer of this <hi>Mankind-Self-ſerving</hi> Project does not clearly anſwer it, I am fully perſwaded he will be diſappointed of his firſt View injudiciouſly open'd to his Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in his laſt Words, becauſe it leaves them with Impreſſions unfavourable to the Writer. If other Diſtempers may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated and the Small Pox may not, as <hi>ſome Inoculators honeſtly own,</hi> that ſuch a Miſcarriage ſometimes ariſes; I queſtion whether our Inoculator ſtands the <hi>Chance</hi> of <hi>being regarded</hi> by 1 <hi>in</hi> 50, <hi>perhaps</hi> 60, 80, 100, 1000, or even more of the Inhabitants of <hi>Bury</hi> for an Enterprize ſo hazardous to their Lives.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore particularly examine how he anſwers in the way of <hi>his Profeſſion</hi> this ſtubborn Objection.</p>
            <p>MOST <hi>chronical Diſtempers,</hi> ſays our exact NUMERIST, <hi>are chiefly owing to the irregular make of the Veſſels thro' which the Blood and Juices paſs.</hi> Had he ſaid SOME FEW I had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed with him. But ſince ſo many chronical Diſtempers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive their Sources from the Viſcidity, Fermentation, Rareſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Condenſation of the Juices and their conſtituent Parts, the Motion and Circulation of which are often ſtopped and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peded, when they are not well comminuted by Concoction: ſince many more are entirely owing to too great an Increaſe of ſharp and acrimonious Salts, which intermixing with the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0205300900:23"/>Fluids, leave in them ſuch a corroſive Quality, as inſtead of filtrating thro' the Glands, break thro', or wear them up. Since then ſo many chronical Diſtempers take their Origine from other Cauſes, I cannot accede to our Author's Aſſertion. Nay, he is ſo diffident and diſtruſtful of the Truth of his own Sentiments, that ſoon after he acknowledges <hi>there are ſeveral Diſtempers which may be communicated by Methods no ways conſiſtent with this Account.</hi> I ſhall leave therefore the further Examination of this Aſſertion, which indeed has no Force here, and had better have been omitted, ſince if our Calculator is wrong in his Account as he moſt egregiouſly is, the Poſition betrays at the ſame Time his want of Judgment, in the Nature and Cauſe of chronical Diſtempers, and the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of palliating or curing them. But this puts me in mind of an Obſervation of the great <hi>Baglivi,</hi> who if I remember right ſomewhere ſays; <q>"In my Judgment, Mathematicks, Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick, Arithmetic, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are as ſerviceable to an accurate Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of Diſeaſes, as the Art of Painting is to a Muſician."</q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT to follow our Author who goes on thus: <hi>Now if this was the Caſe of all, it would be as juſt to affirm, that Inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation could communicate the Features of another Man's Face, as communicate other Diſtempers.</hi> I muſt own this is to me an unintelligible Conſequence drawn from the Author's own Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes, but as they are innocent, harmleſs Words, and <hi>communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate</hi> no force to his Anſwer, and do no hurt to the Objection, I ſuffer them to ſtand in their Place, or to CIRCULATE <hi>with the Milk thro' the Body of a Nurſe.</hi> But I call myſelf off from breaking ſuch Bubbles, and plead in my Defence, 'tis none of my Fault, if ſome Authors Write ſo Triflingly, that they are not to be ſolidly refuted.</p>
            <p>YET ſince I ſaid this Objection was built upon ſolid Reaſon, and ſupported by Experience, I think myſelf obliged to prove
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0205300900:24"/>the Poſſibility, Probability, and Certainty of communicating of other Diſtempers by Inoculation of the <hi>Small Pox.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. IT is generally allowed that the Stamina or Principles of ſome dangerous Diſeaſes, ſuch as Madneſs, Leproſy, Kings-Evil, Conſumptions, <hi>Lues Venerea, &amp;c.</hi> are by an hereditary Right entailed upon ſome Families for ſome Time.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Theſe Principles compounded and ſormed in the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſome Perſons, are of a ſize ſo exiguous, as to be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible even to the moſt Eagle-ey'd Chirurgeon, and of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo quiet and dormant as not to enter upon Action, unleſs by ſome adventitious Cauſe rouſed up.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A VARIOLOUS FEVER by a violent and extraordinary Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the whole Maſs of Blood, rouſes theſe Seeds, and they mix with thoſe of the <hi>Small Pox:</hi> and a Puſtule taken from ſuch a Perſon, who has the Seeds of any of theſe Diſeaſes, may as well convey the Principles of ſuch Diſeaſes, as of the <hi>Small Pox</hi> into another clear of them before.</p>
            <p n="4">4. WHEN thus conveyed they have a Power in the minuteſt Size to convert a large Maſs of Liquids into their noxious Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and by this Aſſimilation ruin the Craſis of the Blood, and in progreſs of Time produce a homogeneous Diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>THAT I am not ſingular in allowing ſuch <hi>Semina</hi> and Agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of 'em to corrupt the Blood and Humours, and by Degrees bring them into ſuch a ſtate of Aſſimilation as may cauſe a Diſtemper of the ſame Family to break out, will be clear to thoſe who have read the mechanical Account of Poiſon, wrote by the judicious and learned Dr. <hi>Mead,</hi> in which Treatiſe he ſeveral Times, and various Ways confirms and eſtabliſhes this Notion, Particularly p. 84. <q>"What is thrown out from Liquors in a Ferment is capable of inducing the like Motion in another
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0205300900:25"/>Liquor of the ſame Kind, when duly mixt with it".</q> Again, <q>"A Perſon thus affected <hi>(viz. by a mad Dog)</hi> may be ſaid in a Degree to have put on the canine Nature, tho' his Reaſon be all this time untouch'd and entire, may Bite, Howl, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe the like violent Agitation of the Blood in him as was in the Dog, will preſent like Species, and conſequently (ſo far as their different Natures will allow) produce like Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>&amp;c</hi>".</q>
            </p>
            <p>I WILL only add another Quotation, from an Author who is as great an Ornament of our Profeſſion in the <hi>French</hi> Nation, as the Laſt is in our <hi>own, [viz.] Helvetius,</hi> who expreſſly ſays in his <hi>Eſſay on the Animal Oeconomy,</hi> P. 132. <q>"When the Blood abounds with Humours of different Qualities, which are likewiſe diſſolved along with the variolous Humours, the Diſeaſe in that Caſe cannot be Simple, but muſt be compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated".</q> From theſe Authorities it appears that the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſita of ſome bad Diſeaſe may incorporate with the purulent Matter of a Puſtule, and the Puſtule being a Compoſition of variolous Poyſon and of theſe Seeds, may <hi>poſſibly</hi> and <hi>probably</hi> communicate a Chaos of Diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>BUT Poſſibilities and Probabilities are Bugbears and may fright Children, but not move a wiſe Man; For <hi>the infectious Matter</hi> (ſays our Author) <hi>according to Experience appears to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate nothing but what it was intended to communicate, the Small Pox.</hi> Now this is another unſupported Aſſertion againſt Fact, and <hi>muſt be tried</hi> by Experience, which ſhews a CERTAINTY of ſuch complicated Communication, and as a Proof ſhall <hi>at preſent</hi> only beg his Review of the printed Relations, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Miſs <hi>Rolt</hi>'s and Lord <hi>Percival</hi>'s Son's Caſe, both of which in a lingering Diſeaſe miſerably lived <hi>and at laſt</hi> died Victims to this barbarous Practice; but <hi>hereafter</hi> if our Author ſhall think fit to undertake a general Hiſtory of the Succeſs of Ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation

            <p>I GO on with our Author who generally at the beginning of an Article ſeems to <hi>triumph be it only for a Flouriſh</hi> in a <hi>line or two</hi> but at the Cloſe ſuppoſes <hi>all that has hitherto been advanced may be ſet aſide,</hi> and is by my Conſent. But his forſorn Hope being cut off, we muſt depend upon Porters, Ploughmen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>here we have a moral Certainty, that theſe have ſound and healthy Conſtitutions.</hi> Theſe indeed <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi> be Leprous, Scabious, Scorbutick, Rheumatick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> theſe <hi>cannot</hi> be ſubject to any LATENT Diſeaſe; ſo that from theſe, all Gentlemen may be inoculated very ſafely without any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of any other Diſtemper, and the Ladies have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to fear a Communication of Features, <hi>becauſe it would be as juſt to affirm that Inoculation could communicate the Features of another Man's Face, as communicate other Diſtempers.</hi> But I will farther add, and oblige our Author with another neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Caution in the Practice of Inoculation, which perhaps he never heard of before, and tell him that <hi>it is the Opinion of ſome,</hi> that even the vicious Inclination of a Nurſe may by the Milk be communicated to her ſuckling Infant; if ſo, methinks he ſhould be very careful and inquiſitive into the moral Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Perſon from whom the Matter is taken, for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe he may imprudently bring an Honeſt Man to the Gallows, and make a Modeſt Virgin a Brazen Proſtitute; but <hi>this perhaps will ſo rarely happen, as not to deſerve Notice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I HAVE now given a ſhort Anſwer to a Pamphlet, entituled, <hi>Some Reaſons,</hi> &amp;c. If my Friends have expected it ſooner, or wiſh'd for a Longer, I muſt tell a plain and undiſguiſed Truth, I had neither Inclination for the one, nor Time for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and in thoſe Hours I ſat down to write, I have been ſo frequently interrupted, that it is more my Wonder that I
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0205300900:27"/>have finiſh'd ſo ſoon, than that the Impatience of my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance ſhou'd make them think I delay'd too long. But I hope I have ſaid enough to diſcourage a Practice inſecure of its Intention, often pernicious in its Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, frequently fatal in its Event, to thoſe who volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily and freely ſubmit to it; and ſurely neither Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or Compulſion ſhould be uſed when Health and Life are the Stakes. It muſt undoubtedly therefore lay all thoſe who are by fine PROMISES drawn into it, or by inhumane THREATS forc'd into it, under unrequitable Obligations to the Projector.</p>
            <p>IF OTHERS can calmly ſee a deteſtable Method diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited every where elſe, introduced amongſt their Friends and Acquaintance; I muſt own I could not be Paſſive and Silent and with coolneſs of Temper ſee it; I could not even forſee their Miſeries without Horrour, and thought myſelf obliged by the Ties of Humanity and Friendſhip, to do my utmoſt to prevent them. This was the ſole Motive of my Writing this Anſwer, and if I am ſo happy as to ſtop a moſt dangerous Scheme, the Pleaſure of doing good is Reward great enough for me. And ſince our Author in his laſt Line without any Hypocriſy owns an ambitious View of being <hi>regarded,</hi> I with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Envy wiſh he may meet with as much regard, as his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty joined with his Merit may juſtly claim.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>A Letter from Mrs.</hi> Rolt. <hi>Dated</hi> September, 16, 1724.</head>
               <p>WHEN I determin'd by my Friend's Perſwaſion to have my Daughter inoculated, I ſent for Mr. <hi>A—d,</hi> he as'k but few queſtions about her, but I told him ſhe had the <hi>Jaundice</hi> about a Year before, and ſome Months after a ſmall relapſe into it, that from that time ſhe had been very well, till ſhe had the <hi>Meaſles</hi> about two Months before, and getting ſoon well of it, had been ever ſince with a Relation at <hi>Epſome.</hi> He declar'd himſelf very well ſatisfied with her State of Health, and tho' I propos'd having a Phyſician to attend her, ask'd him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there was not to be ſome Preparation, and particularly mention'd, cutting off her Hair; he ſaid there was no occaſion for any thing I had offered, that the Child would be ſo well all the Courſe of the Diſeaſe, that ſhe would play about the Room the whole Time.</p>
               <p>About five or ſix Days after the Inoculation, ſhe was ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great Pains in all her Joints. The <hi>Small Pox</hi> came out about the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> or 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Day very violently, and was what
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0205300900:29"/>they call the <hi>flux</hi> Sort; upon which I propos'd again a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, Mr. <hi>A—d</hi> upon it nam'd one he had a mind, which I conſented to, ſoon after another was call'd, who he ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood Inoculation: ſoon after their Bleeding her, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared a ſwelling upon one of her Elbows, upon which I was very much flatter'd, that it was a mark ſhe would do well, as I was often in the courſe of her Illneſs. In nine Weeks after the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculation, and after the moſt miſerable Suffering, that ever poor Creature underwent, ſhe died worn to nothing but Skin and Bone. She had <hi>ſix and thirty running Sores (none of them having ever been heal'd)</hi> when ſhe died; and they were forced to roll up her <hi>Joints in Paſt-board,</hi> leaſt the Joints ſhould fall out of their Places.</p>
               <p>I am very ſenſible of the Reports which have been ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her, <hi>[viz.]</hi> that ſhe was eat up of the Kings-evil, that ſhe had had the Black-Jaundice, and that ſhe was not well cured of that, nor of the <hi>Meaſles.</hi> The Contrary of which, was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd to me by thoſe who had the Care of her in thoſe Illneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and as to the King's-evil it never happen'd, either to Mr. <hi>Rolt</hi>'s or my Family, nor was it ever ſuſpected by the <hi>Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> who had treated her. And Mr. <hi>A—d</hi> himſelf as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, allowed her to be in a very good Condition, and fit for the Operation even without the help, either of a <hi>Phyſician,</hi> or any Preparation.</p>
               <p>After this it is very extraordinary to have ſuch Reports ſpread; and particularly that <hi>any Man</hi> ſhould talk in Print <hi>of the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Life of a Child of nine Years old;</hi> for near two Years before the <hi>Meaſles,</hi> ſhe had been at Mr. <hi>Caverlas</hi> School, which is allow'd to be one of the beſt govern'd in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I could ſay much more upon this Subject, but as every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular of this is <hi>Fact,</hi> the World may ſee by it the <hi>Humanity</hi> of having ſuch a <hi>Misfortune</hi> aggravated, by the very <hi>People,</hi> who at leaſt ſhould ſhew ſome Repentance, for the Miſery they brought upon an afflicted Mother.</p>
