            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>A Preface to a Play ſeems generally to be
conſidered as a kind of Cloſet-prologue,
in which—if his Piece has been ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful—the
Author ſolicits that indulgence from
the Reader which he had before experienced
from the Audience: But as the ſcope and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
object of a Play is to pleaſe a mixed
aſſembly in <hi>Repreſentation</hi> (whoſe judgment
in the Theatre at leaſt is deciſive) its degree
of reputation is uſually as determined as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic,
before it can be prepared for the cooler
tribunal of the Study. Thus any farther ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude
on the part of the Writer becomes
unneceſſary at leaſt, if not an intruſion: and
if the Piece has been condemned in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance,
I fear an Addreſs to the Cloſet,
like an Appeal to Poſterity, is conſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
as the procraſtination of a ſuit, from
a conſciouſneſs of the weakneſs of the cauſe.
From theſe conſiderations, the following Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
would certainly have been ſubmitted to
the Reader, without any further introduction
than what it had in the Repreſentation, but
that its ſucceſs has probably been founded on
a circumſtance which the Author is informed
has not before attended a theatrical trial, and
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:1182801300:4"/>
which conſequently ought not to paſs unno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed.</p>
            <p>I need ſcarcely add, that the circumſtance
alluded to, was the withdrawing of the Piece,
to remove thoſe imperfections in the firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation
which were too obvious to eſcape
reprehenſion, and too numerous to admit of
a haſty correction. There are few writers, I
believe, who, even in the fulleſt conſciouſneſs
of error, do not wiſh to palliate the faults
which they acknowledge; and, however tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling
the performance, to ſecond their confeſſion
of its deficiencies, by whatever plea ſeems leaſt
diſgraceful to their ability. In the preſent
inſtance, it cannot be ſaid to amount either
to candour or modeſty in me, to acknowledge
an extreme inexperience and want of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on matters, in which, without guidance
from practice, or ſpur from ſucceſs, a young
man ſhould ſcarcely boaſt of being an adept.
If it be ſaid, that under ſuch diſadvantages no
one ſhould attempt to write a play—I muſt
beg leave to diſſent from the poſition, while
the firſt point of experience that I have gained
on the ſubject is, a knowledge of the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
and judgment with which an impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Public diſtinguiſhes between the errors
of inexperience and incapacity, and the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
which it ſhews even to a diſpoſition to
remedy the defects of either.</p>
            <p>It were unneceſſary to enter into any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
extenuation of what was thought excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
in this Play, but that it has been
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:1182801300:5"/>
ſaid, that the Managers ſhould have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
ſome of the defects before its appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to the Public—and in particular the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common
length of the piece as repreſented
the firſt night.—It were an ill return for the
moſt liberal and gentlemanly conduct on their
ſide, to ſuffer any cenſure to reſt where none
was deſerved. Hurry in writing has long
been exploded as an excuſe for an Author;—
however, in the dramatic line, it may happen,
that both an Author and a Manager may wiſh
to fill a chaſm in the entertainment of the
Public with a haſtineſs not altogether cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable.
The ſeaſon was advanced when I firſt
put the play into Mr. Harris's hands:—it was
at that time at leaſt double the length of any
acting comedy.—I profited by his judgment
and experience in the curtailing of it—'till, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
his feeling for the vanity of a young Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
got the better of his deſire for correctneſs,
and he left many excreſcences remaining, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he had aſſiſted in pruning ſo many more.
Hence, though I was not uninformed that the
Acts were ſtill too long, I flatter'd myſelf that,
after the firſt trial, I might with ſafer judgment
proceed to remove what ſhould appear to have
been moſt diſſatisfactory.—Many other errors
there were, which might in part have ariſen
from my being by no means converſant with
plays in general, either in reading or at the
theatre.—Yet I own that, in one reſpect, I did
not regret my ignorance: for as my firſt wiſh
in attempting a Play, was to avoid every ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:1182801300:6"/>
of plagiary, I thought I ſhould ſtand
a better chance of effecting this from being in
a walk which I had not frequented, and where
conſequently the progreſs of invention was
leſs likely to be interrupted by ſtarts of recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection:
for on ſubjects on which the mind
has been much informed, invention is ſlow of
exerting itſelf.—Faded ideas float in the fancy
like half-forgotten dreams; and the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in its fulleſt enjoyments becomes ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
of its offspring, and doubts whether it
has created or adopted.</p>
            <p>With regard to ſome particular paſſages
which on the Firſt Night's Repreſentation
ſeemed generally diſliked, I confeſs, that if
I felt any emotion of ſurpriſe at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approbation,
it was not that they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approved
of, but that I had not before per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
that they deſerved it. As ſome part
of the attack on the Piece was begun too early
to paſs for the ſentence of <hi>Judgment,</hi> which
is ever tardy in condemning, it has been ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted
to me, that much of the diſapproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
muſt have ariſen from virulence of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
rather than ſeverity of Criticiſm: But
as I was more apprehenſive of there being
juſt grounds to excite the latter, than conſcious
of having deſerved the former, I continue
not to believe that probable, which I am ſure
muſt have been unprovoked. However, if it
was ſo, and I could even mark the quarter
from whence it came, it would be ungenerous
to retort; for no paſſion ſuffers more than
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:1182801300:7"/>
malice from diſappointment. For my own
part, I ſee no reaſon why the Author of a
Play ſhould not regard a Firſt Night's Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
as a candid and judicious friend attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
in behalf of the Public, at his laſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſal.
If he can diſpenſe with flattery, he
is ſure at leaſt of ſincerity, and even though
the annotation be rude, he may rely upon the
juſtneſs of the comment. Conſidered in this
light, that Audience, whoſe <hi>fiat</hi> is eſſential
to the Poet's claim, whether his object be
Fame or Profit, has ſurely a right to expect
ſome deference to its opinion, from principles
of Politeneſs at leaſt, if not from Gratitude.</p>
            <p>As for the little puny Critics, who ſcatter
their peeviſh ſtrictures in private circles, and
ſcribble at every Author who has the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
of being unconnected with them, as
they are uſually ſpleen-ſwoln from a vain idea
of increaſing their conſequence, there will
always be found a petulance and illiberality in
their remarks, which ſhould place them as far
beneath the notice of a Gentleman, as their
original dulneſs had ſunk them from the
level of the moſt unſucceſsful Author.</p>
            <p>It is not without pleaſure that I catch at
an opportunity of juſtifying myſelf from the
charge of intending any national reflection in
the character of Sir <hi>Lucius O'Trigger.</hi> If any
Gentlemen oppoſed the Piece from that idea,
I thank them ſincerely for their oppoſition;
and if the condemnation of this Comedy
(however miſconceived the provocation,) could
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:1182801300:8"/>
have added one ſpark to the decaying flame
of national attachment to the country ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to be reflected on, I ſhould have been
happy in its fate; and might with truth have
boaſted, that it had done more real ſervice in
its failure, than the ſucceſsful morality of a
thouſand ſtage-novels will ever effect.</p>
            <p>It is uſual, I believe, to thank the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers
in a new Play, for the exertion of
their ſeveral abilities. But where (as in this
inſtance) their merit has been ſo ſtriking and
uncontroverted, as to call for the warmeſt and
trueſt applauſe from a number of judicious
Audiences, the Poet's after-praiſe comes like
the feeble acclamation of a child to cloſe the
ſhouts of a multitude. The conduct, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
of the Principals in a Theatre cannot be
ſo apparent to the Public.—I think it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
but juſtice to declare, that from this
Theatre (the only one I can ſpeak of from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,)
thoſe Writers who wiſh to try the
Dramatic Line, will meet with that candour
and liberal attention, which are generally al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to be better calculated to lead genius
into excellence, than either the precepts of
judgment, or the guidance of experience.</p>

               </l>
               <l>No <hi>Tricking</hi> here, to blunt the edge of <hi>Law,</hi>

               <l>Or, damn'd in <hi>Equity</hi>—eſcape by <hi>Flaw:</hi>

               <l>But <hi>Judgment</hi> given—<hi>your Sentence</hi> muſt remain;</l>
               <l>—No <hi>Writ of Error</hi> lies—to <hi>Drury-lane!</hi>
               </l>

               <l>We gain ſome favour, if not <hi>Coſts of Suit.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>No ſpleen is here! I ſee no hoarded fury;</l>
               <l>—I think I never fac'd a milder Jury!</l>
               <l>Sad elſe our plight!—where frowns are tranſportation,</l>
               <l>A hiſs the gallows,—and a groan, damnation!</l>
               <l>But ſuch the public candour, without fear</l>
               <l>My Client waves all <hi>right of challenge</hi> here.</l>
               <l>No Newſman from <hi>our</hi> Seſſion is diſmiſs'd,</l>
               <l>Nor Wit nor Critic <hi>we</hi> ſcratch off the liſt;</l>
               <l>His faults can never hurt another's eaſe,</l>
               <l>His crime at worſt—a <hi>bad attempt</hi> to pleaſe:</l>
               <l>Thus, all reſpecting, he appeals to all,</l>

            <stage>Spoken by Mrs. BULKLEY.</stage>
            <l>LADIES for <hi>You</hi>—I heard our Poet ſay—</l>
            <l>He'd try to coax ſome <hi>Moral</hi> from his Play:</l>
            <l>' One moral's plain—cried I—without more fuſs;</l>
            <l>' Man's ſocial happineſs all reſts on Us—</l>
            <l>' Thro' all the Drama—whether d—n'd or not—</l>
            <l>' <hi>Love</hi> gilds the <hi>Scene,</hi> and <hi>Women</hi> guide the <hi>plot.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>' From ev'ry rank—obedience is our due—</l>
            <l>' D'ye doubt?—The world's great ſtage ſhall prove it true.</l>
            <l>The Cit—well ſkill'd to ſhun domeſtic ſtrife—</l>
            <l>Will ſup abroad;—but firſt—he'll aſk his <hi>wife:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>John Trot,</hi> his friend—for once, will do the ſame,</l>
            <l>But then—he'll juſt <hi>ſtep home to tell my dame.</hi>—</l>
            <l>The <hi>ſurly 'Squire</hi>—at noon reſolves to rule,</l>
            <l>And half the day—zounds! Madam is a fool!</l>
            <l>Convinc'd at night—the vanquiſh'd Victor ſays,</l>
            <l>Ah! Kate! <hi>you women have ſuch coaxing ways!</hi>—</l>
            <l>The <hi>jolly Toper</hi> chides each tardy blade,—</l>
            <l>Till reeling Bacchus calls on Love for aid:</l>
            <l>Then with each Toaſt, he ſees fair bumpers ſwim,</l>
            <l>And kiſſes Chloe on the ſparkling Brim!</l>
            <l>Nay, I have heard that Stateſmen—great and wiſe—</l>
            <l>Will <hi>ſometimes</hi> counſel with a Lady's eyes;</l>
            <l>The ſervile ſuitors—watch her various face,</l>
            <l>She ſmiles perferment—or ſhe frowns diſgrace,</l>
            <l>Curtſies a penſion here—there nods a place.</l>
            <l>Nor with leſs awe, in ſcenes of humbler life,</l>
            <l>Is <hi>view'd</hi> the <hi>miſtreſs,</hi> or is <hi>heard</hi> the <hi>wife.</hi>

The pooreſt Peaſant of the pooreſt ſoil,</l>
            <l>The child of Poverty, and heir to Toil—</l>
            <l>Early from radiant Love's impartial light,</l>
            <l>Steals one ſmall ſpark, to cheer his world of night:</l>
            <l>Dear ſpark!—that oft thro' winter's chilling woes,</l>
            <l>Is all the warmth his little cottage knows!</l>
            <l>The wand'ring <hi>Tar</hi>—who, not for <hi>years,</hi> has preſs'd</l>
            <l>The widow'd Partner of his <hi>day</hi> of reſt—</l>
            <l>On the cold deck—far from her arms remov'd—</l>
            <l>Still hums the ditty which his Suſan lov'd:</l>
            <l>And while around the cadence rude is blown,</l>
            <l>The Boatſwain whiſtles in a ſofter tone.</l>
            <l>The <hi>Soldier,</hi> fairly proud of wounds and toil,</l>
            <l>Pants for the <hi>triumph</hi> of his Nancy's ſmile;</l>
            <l>But ere the battle ſhould he liſt' her cries,</l>
            <l>The Lover trembles—and the Hero dies!</l>
            <l>That heart, by war and honour ſteel'd to fear,</l>
            <l>Droops on a ſigh, and ſickens at a tear!</l>
            <l>But Ye more cautious—ye nice judging few,</l>
            <l>Who give to Beauty only Beauty's due,</l>
            <l>Tho' friends to Love—<hi>Ye</hi> view with deep regret</l>
            <l>Our conqueſts marr'd—our triumphs incomplete,</l>
            <l>'Till poliſh'd Wit more laſting charms diſcloſe,</l>
            <l>And Judgment fix the darts which Beauty throws!</l>
            <l>—In female breaſts did Senſe and Merit rule,</l>
            <l>The Lover's mind would aſk no other ſchool;</l>
            <l>Sham'd into ſenſe—the Scholars of our eyes,</l>
            <l>Our Beaux from <hi>Gallantry</hi> would ſoon be wiſe;</l>
            <l>Would gladly light, their homage to improve,</l>
            <l>The Lamp of Knowledge at the Torch of Love!</l>

                  <p>Ah! Thomas, there lies the myſtery o'the

with a lady of a very ſingular taſte: a lady who
likes him better as a <hi>half-pay Enſign</hi> than if ſhe
knew he was ſon and heir to Sir Anthony Abſolute,
a baronet with three thouſand a-year!</p>

                  <p>Oh! there are little amuſements enough—
in the morning we go to the pump-room (though
neither my Maſter nor I drink the waters); after
breakfaſt we ſaunter on the parades or play a
game at billiards; at night we dance: but d—n
the place, I'm tired of it: their regular hours
ſtupify me—not a fiddle nor a card after eleven!
—however Mr. Faulkland's gentleman and I keep
it up a little in private parties;—I'll introduce you
there, Thomas—you'll like him much.</p>

had a quarrel!—And, ſomehow I was afraid he would
never give me an opportunity.—So, laſt Thurſday,
I wrote a letter to myſelf, to inform myſelf that
Beverley was at that time paying his addreſſes to
another woman.—I ſign'd it <hi>your Friend unknown,</hi>
ſhew'd it to Beverley, charg'd him with his falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
put myſelf in a violent paſſion, and vow'd
I'd never ſee him more.</p>

                  <p>Well, Julia, you are your own miſtreſs,
(though under the protection of Sir Anthony) yet
have you, for this long year, been the ſlave to the
caprice, the whim, the jealouſy of this ungrateful
Faulkland, who will ever delay aſſuming the right
of a huſband, while you ſuffer him to be equally
imperious as a lover.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Jul.</speaker>
                  <p>Nay, you are wrong entirely.—We were
contracted before my father's death.—<hi>That,</hi> and
ſome conſequent embarraſſments, have delay'd what
I know to be my Faulkland's moſt ardent wiſh.—
He is too generous to trifle on ſuch a point.—
And for his character, you wrong him there too.—
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1182801300:23"/>
No, Lydia, he is too proud, too noble to be jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous;
if he is captious, 'tis without diſſembling;
if fretful, without rudeneſs.—Unus'd to the ſop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
of love, he is negligent of the little duties
expected from a lover—but being unhackney'd in
the paſſion, his love is ardent and ſincere; and as
it engroſſes his whole ſoul, he expects every thought
and emotion of his miſtreſs to move in uniſon with
his.—Yet, though his pride calls for this full return
—his humility makes him undervalue thoſe qualities
in him, which ſhould entitle him to it; and not
feeling why he ſhould be lov'd to the degree he
wiſhes, he ſtill ſuſpects that he is not lov'd enough:
—This temper, I muſt own, has coſt me many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
hours; but I have learn'd to think myſelf
his debtor, for thoſe imperfections which ariſe from
the ardour of his love.</p>

                  <p>Well, I cannot blame you for defending
him.—But tell me candidly, Julia, had he never
ſav'd your life, do you think you ſhould have been
attach'd to him as you are?—Believe me, the rude
blaſt that overſet your boat was a proſperous gale
of love to him.</p>

inflammatory branches of learning—neither would
it be neceſſary for her to handle any of your mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical,

But, Sir Anthony, I would ſend her, at nine years
old, to a boarding-ſchool, in order to learn a little
ingenuity and artifice.—Then, Sir, ſhe ſhould
have a ſupercilious knowledge in accounts;—and
as ſhe grew up, I would have her inſtructed in
geometry, that ſhe might know ſomething of the
contagious countries;—but above all, Sir Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
ſhe ſhould be miſtreſs of orthodoxy, that ſhe
might not miſ-ſpell, and miſ-pronounce words ſo

                  <p>O, I lied, Sir—I forgot the preciſe lie, but

                  <p>O! upon my ſoul, I never have;—but
what grounds for apprehenſion did you ſay?
Heavens! are there not a thouſand! I fear for
her ſpirits—her health—her life.—My abſence may
fret her; her anxiety for my return, her fears for
me, may oppreſs her gentle temper. And for her
health—does not every hour bring me cauſe to be
alarmed? If it rains, ſome ſhower may even then
have chilled her delicate frame!—If the wind be
keen, ſome rude blaſt may have affected her!
The heat of noon, the dews of the evening, may
endanger the life of her, for whom only I value
mine. O! Jack, when delicate and feeling ſouls
are ſeparated, there is not a feature in the ſky, not
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1182801300:35"/>
a movement of the elements; not an aſpiration of

the worſe for being handſome; but, Sir, if you
pleaſe to recollect, you before hinted ſomething
about a hump or two, one eye, and a few more
graces of that kind—now, without being very nice,
I own I ſhould rather chuſe a wife of mine to have
the uſual number of limbs, and a limited quantity
of back: and tho' <hi>one</hi> eye may be very agreeable,
yet as the prejudice has always run in favour of
<hi>two,</hi> I would not wiſh to affect a ſingularity in

                  <p>They told me Julia would return directly;
wonder ſhe is not yet come!—How mean does
this captious, unſatisfied temper of mine appear to
my cooler judgment! Yet I know not that I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge
it in any other point:—but on this one ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and to this one object, whom I think I love
beyond my life, I am ever ungenerouſly fretful, and
madly capricious!—I am conſcious of it—yet I
cannot correct myſelf! What tender, honeſt joy
ſparkled in her eyes when we met!—How delicate
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1182801300:58"/>
was the warmth of her expreſſions!—I was
aſhamed to appear leſs happy—though I had come
reſolved to wear a face of coolneſs and upbraiding.
Sir Anthony's preſence prevented my propoſed
expoſtulations:—yet I muſt be ſatisfied that ſhe
has not been ſo <hi>very</hi> happy in my abſence.—She is
coming!—Yes!—I know the nimbleneſs of her

                  <p>'Twas but your fancy, Julia.—I <hi>was</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced

I had no cauſe for coldneſs?</p>

                  <p>Well then—ſhall I own to you—but
you will deſpiſe me, Julia—nay, I deſpiſe myſelf

much on the high ſpirits you had enjoyed in
Devonſhire—on your mirth—your ſinging—dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
and I know not what!—For ſuch is my
temper, Julia, that I ſhould regard every mirthful
moment in your abſence as a treaſon to conſtancy:

                  <p>I never can be happy, in your abſence.—
If I wear a countenance of content, it is to ſhew
that my mind holds no doubt of my Faulkland's
truth.—If I ſeem'd ſad—it were to make malice
triumph; and ſay, that I had fixed my heart on
one, who left me to lament his roving, and my
own credulity.—Believe me, Faulkland, I mean
not to upbraid you, when I ſay, that I have often
dreſſed ſorrow in ſmiles, leſt my friends ſhould
gueſs whoſe unkindneſs had cauſed my tears.</p>

                  <p>For no quality! To regard me for any

                  <p>Again, Julia, you raiſe ideas that feed
and juſtify my doubts.—I would not have been
more free—no—I am proud of my reſtraint.—
Yet—yet—perhaps your high reſpect alone for
this ſolemn compact has fettered your inclinations,
which elſe had made worthier choice.—How ſhall
I be ſure, had you remained unbound in thought
and promiſe, that I ſhould ſtill have been the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

                  <p>So I ſhall ſee nothing more of you, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
it be by letter, till the evening.—I would
do myſelf the honour to carry your meſſage; but,
to tell you a ſecret, I believe I ſhall have juſt ſuch
another affair on my own hands. There is a gay
captain here, who put a jeſt on me lately, at the
expence of my country, and I only want to fall in
with the gentleman, to call him out.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir Luc.</speaker>
                  <p>I ſhall be very proud of inſtructing you.
—Well for the preſent—but remember now,
when you meet your antagoniſt, do every thing in
a mild and agreeable manner.—Let your courage
be as keen, but at the ſame time as poliſhed as
your ſword.</p>

                  <speaker>Acres.</speaker>
                  <p>Ah! David, if you had heard Sir Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius!—Odds

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>David.</speaker>
                  <p>Not he, indeed. I hates ſuch blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirſty
cormorants. Look'ee, Maſter, if you'd
wanted a bout at boxing, quarter-ſtaff, or ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaff,
I ſhould never be the man to bid you cry off:
But for your curſt ſharps and ſnaps, I never knew

                  <speaker>David.</speaker>
                  <p>I ſay then, it would be but civil in <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>

Lookee, Maſter, this <hi>honour</hi> ſeems to me to be a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous

falſe friend; aye, truly, a very courtier-like
ſervant.—Put the caſe, I was a gentleman (which,
thank God, no one can ſay of me); well—my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
makes me quarrel with another gentleman of
my acquaintance.—So—we fight. (Pleaſant enough
that) Boh!—I kill him—(the more's my luck.)
Now, pray who gets the profit of it?—Why, my
<hi>honour.</hi>—But put the caſe that he kills me!—
by the Maſs! I go to the worms, and my honour
whips over to my enemy!</p>

                  <speaker>Acres.</speaker>
                  <p>No, David—in that caſe!—Odds crowns

of their company. Look'ee now, Maſter, to go to
them in ſuch haſte—with an ounce of lead in your

as I may ſay, a deſigning and malicious-looking
letter!—and I warrant ſmells of gunpowder like

Phyllis will howl when ſhe hears of it!—Aye, poor

                  <p>Faith! that ſame interruption in affairs
of this nature, ſhews very great ill-breeding.—
I don't know what's the reaſon, but in England, if
a thing of this kind gets wind, people make ſuch
a pother, that a gentleman can never fight in peace
and quietneſs.—However, if it's the ſame to you,
Captain, I ſhould take it as a particular kindneſs,
if you'd let us meet in King's-Mead-Fields, as
a little buſineſs will call me there about ſix o'clock,
and I may diſpatch both matters at once.</p>

                  <p>You ſee before you a wretch, whoſe life
is forfeited.—Nay, ſtart not!—the infirmity of my
temper has drawn all this miſery on me.—I left you
fretful and paſſionate—an untoward accident drew
me into a quarrel—the event is, that I muſt fly
this kingdom inſtantly.—O Julia, had I been ſo
fortunate as to have call'd you mine intirely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this miſchance had fallen on me, I ſhould not ſo
deeply dread my baniſhment!—But no more of
that—your heart and promiſe were given to one
happy in friends, character, and ſtation! they are
not bound to wait upon a ſolitary, guilty exile.</p>

                  <p>My ſoul is oppreſs'd with ſorrow at the

have felt ſtrong comfort in the thought that I could
<hi>now</hi> chaſe from your boſom every doubt of the
warm ſincerity of my love.—My heart has long
known no other guardian—I now entruſt my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to your honour—we will fly together.—When
ſafe from purſuit, my Father's will may be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
—and I receive a legal claim to be the partner
of your ſorrows, and tendereſt comforter. Then
on the boſom of your wedded Julia, you may lull
your keen regret to ſlumbering; while virtuous
love, with a Cherub's hand, ſhall ſmooth the brow
of upbraiding thought, and pluck the thorn from

long has pledged us to each other, it is becauſe it
leaves no room for hard aſperſions on my fame,

                  <p>Well, Jack, we have both taſted the Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
as well as the Sweets, of Love—with this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
only, that <hi>you</hi> always prepared the bitter
cup for yourſelf, while <hi>I</hi>—</p>

                  <p>Was always obliged to <hi>me</hi> for it, hey!
Mr. Modeſty?—But come, no more of that—
our happineſs is now as unallay'd as general.</p>

                  <p>Then let us ſtudy to preſerve it ſo: and
while Hope pictures to us a flattering ſcene of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Bliſs, let us deny its pencil thoſe colours which
are too bright to be laſting.—When Hearts deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Happineſs would unite their fortune, Virtue
would crown them with an unfading garland of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt,
hurtleſs flowers; but ill-judging Paſſion will
force the gaudier Roſe into the wreath, whoſe
thorn offends them, when its Leaves are dropt!</p>
