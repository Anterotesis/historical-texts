            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>THE following descriptive Account of an Excursion to <hi>Brighthelmstone,</hi> is intended to give those, who have not visited that delightfully situated Town and its Environs, an Idea of the Pleasures with which a lively and feeling Mind will be impressed, on viewing those Scenes which the Authors have endeavoured to illustrate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brighthelmstone,</hi>—formerly an insignificant Village, is now become highly interesting on several Accounts.—The purity of the Air, the ever-varying Prospect of the Sea, the excellent Accommodations for Strangers, and the acknowledged Superiority of the Bathing Machines;—these and many other Considerations will always have a powerful Influence on Persons of true Taste,—but when we also consider that a Personage as remarkable for Generosity and Affability and as distinguished for discerning and rewarding Merit as he is exalted by his Birth, has fixed upon this chearful and salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious Spot for his Summer Residence, we are not surprised at seeing a Multitude of Persons of both Sexes (the Pride and Admiration of <hi>Britain</hi>) following the Royal Visitor to the <hi>English Baiae.</hi> Of the Roads which lead to <hi>Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helmstone,</hi> that immediately from <hi>London</hi> being most frequented, the Authors have endeavoured to familiarize it to the Traveller by the Pen and Pencil.</p>
            <p>The various Scenes which are introduced are slightly represented, and intended merely to impress the Mind with the general Effects of Nature.—It is, in short, a Conversation Narrative, illustrated occasionally with <hi>SKETCHES</hi> of those Scenes and Incidents which seemed most worthy of Notice.</p>

            <head>
               <hi>AN</hi> EXCURSION TO BRIGHTHELMSTONE</head>
            <p>CROSSING the <hi>Thames</hi> over <hi>Westminster-Bridge,</hi> we entered the County of <hi>Surry</hi>—of which we think it necessary to prefix a general but concise Description.</p>
            <p>SURRY is terminated, on the West, by <hi>Hampshire;</hi> on the South, by <hi>Sussex;</hi> on the East, by <hi>Kent;</hi> and on the North, by the River <hi>Thames.</hi>—It is 39 Miles in Length from <hi>Rotherhithe,</hi> in the East, to <hi>Trensham,</hi> in the West; and 26 Miles in breadth, from the <hi>Thames,</hi> in the North, to <hi>Awfold,</hi> in the South: and 146 Miles in Circumference. It contains 780 Square Miles, or about 499, 000 Acres; near 28,900 Houses; 14 Hundreds: 140 Parishes; 11 Market Towns; <hi>550</hi> Villages and Hamlets; and about 171,000 Inhabitants.—</p>
            <p>In this County are several Royal Palaces, and a great Number of Noblemen and Gentlemen's Villas.—The Air and the Soil, in the interior Parts, are very different from what they are at the Extremities.—On the Borders, the Air is Mild and healthy; and the Soil, fertile in Corn and Hay, with a Proportion of Woodland,—especially in the
<pb facs="tcp:0683800500:4"/>South, about <hi>Holmsdale;</hi> and in the North, near the <hi>Thames.</hi> But, in the interior Parts, the Air is bleak, and the Soil, in general, sandy and sterile.—The Principal Rivers, which abound with Fish are (exclusive of the <hi>Thames</hi>) the Mole, the Wey, and the Wandle. The Mole, which rises in the South East of the County, obtained its Name from its Sinking in the Earth at the Foot of <hi>Box-Hill,</hi> and after having run under Ground for two Miles, emerging again at <hi>Leatherhead;</hi> from whence it continues its Course Northwards, and falls into the <hi>Thames</hi> at a Village called <hi>Moulsey.</hi> The Wey enters this County from <hi>Hampshire,</hi> near <hi>Farnham;</hi> and runs Eastward to <hi>Godalming;</hi> there turning to the North, it becomes navigable to <hi>Weybridge,</hi> where it falls into the <hi>Thames.—</hi> The Wandle rises near <hi>Carshalton,</hi> and runs with a clear, though small Stream, famous for Trout, by <hi>Merton-Abbey,</hi> to <hi>Wandsworth,</hi> where it falls into the <hi>Thames.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first Place, that deserves Notice, after we had passed <hi>Westminster-Bridge,</hi> was KENNINGTON, a Village near <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and one of the Eight Precincts of that Parish.—On the Common of the same Name, a temporary Gibbet is frequently erected for the Execution of Criminals in the County of <hi>Surry.</hi>—About 2 Miles farther, and 3 Miles and a half from <hi>London,</hi> is CLAPHAM, a very agreeable Village.—On the adjacent Common are many neat and pleasantly situated Houses, chiefly inhabited by Citizens, who enjoy a pure Country air, at a convenient Distance from the Center of Business, <hi>London.</hi>—Here a handsome Church was built in 1776, by the Contribution of the Parishioners; a School-house also was formerly built, for the Education of poor Children.</p>
            <p>Passing through BALLAM, situated about one Mile beyond <hi>Clapham,</hi> and proceeding rather more than a Mile beyond, we arrived at UPPER-TOOTING; a delightful Village.—There is, however, besides its situation, nothing remarkable in it except an Alms-house, built in 1709 by the Mother of Sir <hi>John Bateman,</hi> Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> for the Reception of Six poor Women, to be nominated by the Heir of the Family.</p>
            <p>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0683800500:6"/>About a Mile and a half, South East, is LOWER TOOTING, not worthy of particular Notice.</p>
            <p>Not far from <hi>Upper-Tooting,</hi> at a Village called MARTIN, or MERTON, <hi>Kenulph,</hi> King of the <hi>West Saxons,</hi> was murdered in the House of a Lady, whom he tenderly loved:—It is also celebrated for a stately Abbey, erected here by <hi>Henry</hi> the First, for the Reception of Canons of the Order of St. <hi>Augustin;</hi> Part of the Walls remain, but very insufficient to convey an Idea of its ancient Magnificence.</p>
            <p>Pursuing our Journey,—about 2 Miles beyond <hi>Lower-Tooting,</hi> we arrived at MITCHAM, a well inhabited Village, and extremely well situated.—The following Anecdote, curious in its Circumstances, we hope will not be misplaced, —One <hi>H. Smith,</hi> who, by the Occupation of a Silversmith in <hi>London,</hi> had acquired a considerable Fortune, formed the strange Resolution of spending the Remainder of his Days as a Common Beggar. He confined his Limits to the County of <hi>Surry,</hi> where he was known by the Appellation of <hi>"Dog Smith;"</hi> but having given Offence to an Inhabitant of this Town, he was, by a Justice of the Peace, ordered to be publickly whipp'd. This he resented so much, that he left, at his Death, Fifty Pounds a Year, or One Thousand Pounds in Money, to every Market-Town in the County,—<hi>Mitcham</hi> excepted.</p>
            <p>Here is a Fair on the 12th of <hi>August,</hi> for Cattle, Toys, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>SUTTON,—11 Miles from <hi>London,</hi> is the first Post Stage.—The <hi>Cock,</hi> kept by <hi>Fuller,</hi> is an excellent Inn, where the Traveller may be supplied with good Chaises, and able Horses.—This Village is very pleasantly situated; and the Air is no pure and healthy, that with the additional Inducement of eating the celebrated <hi>Banstead-Down</hi> Mutton, many of the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> resort here on Sundays.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0683800500:7"/>
               <figure/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0683800500:8"/>Proceeding over <hi>Walton-Heath</hi> about 9 Miles beyond <hi>Sutton,</hi> we came to <hi>Reigate-Hill;</hi> a remarkably bold Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, from whence is a delightful Prospect of the South Downs in <hi>Sussex.</hi> But, near the Road, (which is scoop'd out of the Hill,) the Declivity is so steep and abrupt, that the Spectator cannot help being struck with Terror, though softened by Admiration.—The Sublime and the Beautiful are here perfectly united; Imagination is fully exercised, and the Mind delighted.</p>
            <p>REIGATE, the second Post Stage, is 23 Miles from <hi>London.</hi>—It is situated in the Vale of <hi>Holmsdale,</hi> and beautifully surrounded with Hills; is an Ancient Borough by Prescription, and is governed by a Bailiff, chosen annually at the Manor Court.—Here is a handsome Church, a Charity School, and a Market House. This last was, formerly a Chapel, dedicated to Thomas à Becket.—There are also some inconsiderable Remains of a very ancient Castle, in one of the Apartments of which the Barons, who were in Arms against King <hi>John,</hi> are said to have held their private Meetings.</p>
            <p>At the <hi>White-Hart</hi> the Traveller is certain of meeting with every Accommodation he can wish; good Post-horses, an excellent Larder, genuine Wines, &amp;c. which have rendered Mrs. <hi>Sully</hi> worthy the Encouragement she meets with.—His ROYAL HIGHNESS THE PRINCE OF WALES, in his Excursions to <hi>Brighthelmstone</hi> frequently dines here.</p>
            <p>A Fair is held at <hi>Reigate</hi> on <hi>Whit-monday;</hi> and another on the 14th of <hi>September.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, <hi>William Warren,</hi> Earl of <hi>Surry,</hi> founded a Priory of Black Canons, at the bottom of a Hill adjoining to <hi>Reigate,</hi> which is now a Dwelling-House.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0683800500:9"/>Near <hi>Reigate</hi> are two Boroughs, GATTON and BLECHINGLEY;—each of which sends two Members to Parliament.</p>
            <p>GATTON is a Borough by Prescription; near which Place some Roman Coins have been found.</p>
            <p>BLECHINGLEY has nothing particularly remarkable.</p>
            <p>We, therefore, proceeded on our Journey 'till we arrived on the Borders of SUSSEX; of which County it may not be improper, before we enter it, to give a short Description.</p>
            <p>The Name of SUSSEX is derived from a Word which signified the County of the <hi>South Saxons.</hi> It is terminated on the North, by <hi>Surry;</hi> on the East and North East, by <hi>Kent;</hi> on the South, by the <hi>British Channel;</hi> and on the West, by <hi>Hampshire.</hi> Its length is 75 Miles; its breadth 28, and its Circumference 195; containing 1444 square Miles; divided into 6 Rapes or Laths; to each of which, there formerly belonged a Castle, a River, and a Forest. —It is, besides, subdivided into 65 Hundreds, which include 342 Parishes, 1 City, 16 Market-Towns, 1,065 Villages and Hamlets, and has 14, 880 Houses.</p>
            <p>The Air of this County is in general wholesome, though to Strangers, it is sometimes productive of Agues. In the North Parts, it is rather foggy, but healthy; and upon the Downs, it is remarkably pure. The hilly Parts are naturally less fertile than the others; but the Vales, and especially the <hi>Weald,</hi> are highly productive.—The <hi>South Downs,</hi> from whence is a beautiful prospect, are generally covered with Sheep, remarkable for the fineness of their Wool; a great Quantity of which is too often clandestinely smuggled into <hi>France,</hi> (notwithstanding the Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Legislature to this great Object), to the great Injury of the <hi>British</hi> Woollen Manufactures. The Middle

               <figure/>
               <pb facs="tcp:0683800500:12"/>
Part of the County is beautifully interspersed with Meadows, Pasture Grounds, Woods and Corn Fields; the last of which produce great Abundance of Wheat and Barley. The North Part abounds in Woods, which furnish the Dock-Yards with large Quantities of valuable Timber, and supply the Iron-Works, in the Eastern Part of the County with Charcoal.—The principal Rivers are the <hi>Arun,</hi> the <hi>Adur,</hi> the <hi>Ouse,</hi> and the <hi>Rother.</hi> The smaller Rivers are the <hi>Lavant,</hi> the <hi>Cuchmeer,</hi> the <hi>Ashburn,</hi> and the <hi>Astem.</hi> SUSSEX is in the Province of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and in the Diocese of <hi>Chichester.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>CRAWLEY,—31 Miles from <hi>London,</hi> is the first Town in SUSSEX, which we visited; but not meeting any thing here particularly worthy of Notice, continued our Route 'till we arrived at CUCKFIELD,—40 Miles distant from <hi>London.</hi>—Here a Fair is held, in <hi>September,</hi> resorted to by a great Number of pretty rustic Females, and by a multitude of happy Swains.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Cuckfield</hi> to <hi>Brighthelmstone,</hi> about 14 Miles distant, the Country is chearful, and the Prospects various and extensive.</p>
            <p>PRESTON,—1 Mile from <hi>Brighthelmstone,</hi> is a beautiful Spot, adorned with a great Number of venerable Elms. <hi>Preston-House</hi> is said to have been the Residence of <hi>Anne of Cleves,</hi> Consort to <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth; from hence she retired to a Convent at <hi>Falmer,</hi> about 3 Miles distant where she died and was buried.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0683800500:13"/>From hence the bending Sky is seen, at an immeasurable Distance, meeting the Surface of the Ocean, and forming the grand Curve of the sensible Horizon.</p>
            <p>From the great Number of human Bones, which have been dug up in the Neighbourhood of <hi>Brighthelmstone,</hi> we may naturally suppose it to have been the Scene of some great Battle; and, as the Coast of <hi>Sussex</hi> was certainly the Place where the <hi>Belgians</hi> often landed, and at last effected a Settlement; there is no doubt but the <hi>Ancient Britons</hi> had frequent Disputes with them, and that many Battles were fought; one of which, probably, might have been near this Town.</p>
            <p>In the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> when the Kingdom was threatened with an Invasion from <hi>Spain,</hi> this was thought a Place of Importance, and there are yet Remains of a Wall near the Sea, which seems to have been erected about that Time.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Charles</hi> the Second escaped from the Battle of <hi>Worcester,</hi> he wandered through different Parts of the Kingdom, seeking an opportunity to escape to <hi>France;</hi> and coming to this Place, attended by Lord <hi>Wilmot,</hi> and a few other faithful Friends, so disguised, that, without being known by any of the Inhabitants, he was, by means of a fishing Boat, safely landed in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> is said to have landed here, in one of his Expeditions against <hi>Britain.</hi>

               <pb facs="tcp:0683800500:17"/>A great number of <hi>Druidical</hi> Monuments and Altars have been discovered in this Neighbourhood.</p>
            <p>BRIGHTHELMSTONE, (one of the most Southern Towns in the County of <hi>Sussex</hi>) is situated in a Bay, terminated by <hi>Beachy-Head;</hi> on the East, and by <hi>Worthing-Point,</hi> on the West. The <hi>Stein,</hi> at <hi>Brighthelmstone,</hi> is most beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully situated: Three Sides of it are formed by very neat and convenient Lodging-Houses, &amp;c.—The fourth is open to the Sea. The rising Downs behind, are a Shelter and Ornament. The white Cliffs are seen trending to the East, as far as <hi>Seaforth;</hi> and, on the West, the Eye ranges over the Liquid Expanse, and reaches <hi>Portsdown-Hill, Spithead,</hi> the Eastern Part of the <hi>Isle of Wight,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Marine Pavilion of HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE PRINCE OF WALES, on the West Side of the <hi>Stein,</hi> is a striking Object, and is admirably calculated for the Summer Residence of the Royal Personage for whom it was built; and whose Munificence and Affability endear him to all who are not biassed by Party, blinded by Prejudice, or hostile to dignified Merit. This Pavilion, correctly designed, and elegantly executed, was begun and compleated in five Months.—The Furniture is adapted with great Taste to the Stile of the Building. The grand Saloon is beautifully decorated with Paintings by <hi>Rebecca,</hi> executed in his best Manner. The <hi>toul ensemble</hi> of the Building is, in short, perfect Harmony. The Whole was executed by Mr. <hi>Holland,</hi> under the immediate Inspection and Direction of Mr. <hi>Weltjie,</hi> whose Attachment to his Royal Master was faithful and disinterested. The Stables belonging to his Royal Highness are built in a Stile of convenient Simplicity, correspondent with that of the other Buildings.</p>
            <p>The Bathing Machines are under the Care of the attentive <hi>Smoaker.</hi> The number of beautiful Women, who every Morning court the Embraces of the Watery God, far exceeds that of any other Bathing Place in the Kingdom.</p>

            <p>There are two excellent Libraries on the <hi>Stein,</hi> kept by Messrs. <hi>Crauford</hi> and <hi>Dulot;</hi> also a good Print-Shop by Mrs. <hi>Lay,</hi> which with Miss <hi>Currie's</hi> Shop in <hi>North-Street,</hi> are the Places of polite Resort. From the various and excellent Assortments of useful and ornamental Commodities at the above Places, Selections are frequently made for a Raffle.</p>
            <p>A good Band of Music plays on the <hi>Stein,</hi> for some Time, twice a Day.—The lovely Throng of Females (in all the Elegance of a light Summer's Dress, woven in Fancy's Loom) who here suffer the Sea Breezes to riot on their Charms, is exceedingly numerous.</p>
            <p>In the Town is a Hot, and a Cold Bath.—One Mile out of Town is an excellent Chalybeate Spring, possessing all the Properties of the celebrated <hi>Tunbridge</hi> Waters.</p>
            <p>Of Lodging-Houses, those erected on the <hi>Stein,</hi> being most beautifully situated, are consequently most expensive; but there are others suitable to Persons of all Ranks and Fortunes.</p>

            <p>The Race Ground is exceedingly well adapted to the Purpose for which it was intended; and is one of the most beautifully situated Spots in the World. The Prospect is wonderfully extensive and magnificent.</p>
            <p>The Races are in <hi>July.</hi>—There are always Three Fifties, besides several Sweepstakes, Matches, &amp;c. A handsome and convenient Stand, sufficiently capacious to receive a great Number of Spectators, is erected on the Course.</p>
            <p>At a small Distance from the Race Ground, there was formerly a <hi>Roman</hi> Station, now called WHITEHAWKE, some Vestages of which, of a circular Form, are still visible.</p>
            <p>Four Miles East of <hi>Brighthelmstone,</hi> is a delightful Village called ROTTINGDEANE; it's Situation on a Cliff, is remarkably bold and striking, and at a convenient Distance to receive the Overflow of Strangers from <hi>Brighthelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,</hi> who may, here, be accommodated with Lodgings and Bathing Machines.—The Road which leads to this Village, over the Downs, is extremely pleasant, and the Prospect beautiful.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Devil's Dyke,</hi> (formerly a <hi>Roman</hi> Encampment,) about 8 Miles North-west of <hi>Brighthelmstone,</hi> is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Situation.—The Prospect from hence is so very extensive that the Eye takes in, successively, a circumference of 100 Miles;—comprehending a great Number of Spires, Towns and Villages.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0683800500:22"/>At HOOVE,—between <hi>Brighthelmstone</hi> and <hi>New Shoreham,</hi> are the remains of a Church, which seems to have been, originally, a Structure of great Beauty and Grandeur.</p>
            <p>New SHOREHAM,—about 6 Miles from <hi>Brighthelmstone</hi> Westward, is noted for Ship-building; in which Art the Inhabitants are allowed to excell.</p>
            <p>NEWHAVEN,—about 9 Miles East of <hi>Brighthelmstone,</hi> is situated at the Mouth of the River <hi>Ouse;</hi> was formerly famous for its safe and commodious Harbour, which is now, unfortunately choaked up with Mud and Sand; but we may expect, that, from the laudable Exertions of the Inhabitants of the Town, it will in Time recover its former Celebrity.</p>
