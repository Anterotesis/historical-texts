            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT is needleſs to ſay the following Opera is taken from FIELDING'S celebrated novel of <hi>Tom Jones;</hi> a production ſo replete with wit, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and character, that it can never want ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers while the Engliſh language remains. My extreme veneration for the memory of the truly-witty and ingenious noveliſt, naturally led me to <hi>preſerve</hi> as much of FIELDING throughout my Opera, as the nature of my plan would allow. Nay, when it was thought neceſſary to ſhorten the piece, leſt it ſhould be too long in repreſentation, I readily <hi>parted with my own,</hi> to <hi>retain</hi> as much as poſſible of the <hi>invaluable Original.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have made many material deviations from the novel, both in point of fable, and character. I have ſtripp'd its hero of his libertiniſm, to render him, as I imagined, more amiable and intereſting; and have metamorphos'd Parſon <hi>Supple</hi> into a country 'ſquire, to avoid giving offence to the <hi>cloth.</hi> The characters of <hi>Weſtern</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> I have diveſted of their provinciality; leſt the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the performers, to the pronunciation of an uncouth and difficult dialect, ſhould produce an <hi>Inattention</hi> to the more material buſineſs of the drama. I have alſo endeavoured to purge Weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern's character of its coarſeneſs and indelicacy, in conformity to the refined taſte of the preſent age; and of its Jacobitiſm, from an opinion that ſuch political ſect no longer exiſts, as well as from
<pb facs="tcp:0699500600:4"/>a conviction that nothing of party ſhould ever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear within the walls of a theatre.</p>
            <p>While I was writing the laſt act of this Opera (which was in June, 1765), the <hi>French</hi> Tom Jones fell into my hands. I found its plan ſo very confined, and ſo materially different from mine, that I could reap little or no benefit from it. The only particulars, of which I have availed my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from Monſ. POINSINET, are the hint of <hi>legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating</hi> Jones, and the thought, which gave riſe to my <hi>ſecond</hi> air. I have quoted the lines, from which I received advantage in the latter inſtance:</p>

                     <p>Ma'am, I may be miſtaken, it's true; becauſe, as the man ſays, we can be ſure of nothing in this world but death and taxes: however I could tell you ſomething, that looks very like it.</p>

                     <p>He came into the room, as I was ſitting at work, and what ſhould be upon the table but the muff you gave me, and my gentleman whips his hands into it. "La, Mr. Jones, you'll ſpoil it," ſays I; but he ſtill kept his hands in it, and kiſs'd it, and mumbled it, and kiſs'd it—for my part I never ſaw ſuch kiſſes in my life as he gave it.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0699500600:10"/>Jones? A penny for your thoughts"—"Huſſy," ſays he, ſtarting up as from a dream, "what can I be thinking of, when that angel your miſtreſs is playing?"—But I'm afraid you're offended, ma'am?</p>

                     <p>Then ſqueezing my hand—he ſqueez'd ſo hard, that I thought he would have forc'd the blood out of my finger-ends—"Oh! Mrs. Honour, ſays he, how happy will that man be"—and then he ſigh'd—Upon my faith his breath is as ſweet as a noſegay—but for heaven's ſake, ma'am, don't ſpeak of this; for he gave me a guinea never to mention it. However, as I did not ſwear it, it's only a promiſe, and what ſignifies a promiſe?</p>

                     <p>There can be no hopes of her father's conſent; and Mr. Allworthy would never pardon an attempt to marry her without it—nay I could ſcarce pardon myſelf. Conſcience teaches me, that to repay the friendſhips of hoſpitality by this worſt kind of robbery, is to be the meaneſt, the baſeſt of all robbers.—Yet is there not a great difference between clandeſtinely marrying a friend's daughter from a motive of love, and doing it from a ſordid motive of intereſt?—Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly—but then her father would diſclaim her; and ſhall I, whoſe ſole ſupport flows from Mr. Allworthy's unmerited bounty, involve her in my diſtreſs? Her, who has been brought up with ſuch tenderneſs, elegance, and delicacy?—That, that hath determined me—No, no, no; let me not make her unhappy, however miſerable I may be myſelf—I muſt think no more of her.</p>
