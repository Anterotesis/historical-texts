            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Having thus far given ſome View of the Amount of the <hi>South Sea</hi> Capital, I ſhall endeavour to demonſtrate the Reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Terms given by the <hi>South-Sea</hi> Company, as well as the Advantageouſneſs of accepting them. To do which in the moſt convincing manner, I ſhall beg Leave to ſet a Valuation upon the reſpective Funds, at the Time the Company firſt began to engage to redeem them: And then ſhew the Advantage accruing from the Exchange.</p>
            <p>Firſt, as to the Valuation of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Funds.</p>
            <p>The Long Annuities never exceeded 25 Years Purchaſe, and were look'd upon as very dear at that Rate, it bringing but 4<hi>l. per Ann.</hi> to the Purchaſer.</p>

And I believe it is pretty certain, that the Proprietors of the 5<hi>l. per Cent.</hi> Funds would gladly have accepted of 4<hi>l. per Cent.</hi> rather than have been paid off.</p>
            <p>If this be a fair Valuation, let us examine into the Reaſonableneſs and Advantageouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Terms given by the <hi>South-Sea</hi> Company.</p>
            <p>And Firſt, Every Long Annuitant, who ſubſcribed in <hi>April</hi> laſt, received in Stock, Bonds and Money, after the Rate of 36½ Years Purchaſe for an Annuity, which till then was not worth more than 25 Years Purchaſe.</p>
            <p>In like manner, every Proprietor of the 9 <hi>per Cents,</hi> or Lottery 1710, received in Stock, Bonds, and Money, about 19½ Years Purchaſe for what would not have ſold for 15.</p>
            <p>As to the Terms at preſent given to the 2d Subſcribers, they receive in Stock after the Rate of 35½ Years Purchaſe.</p>
            <p>And the 9 <hi>per Cents,</hi> and Lottery 1710, receive in Stock about 18½ Years Purchaſe.</p>

            <p>But to come to the main Point, which is to endeavour to ſhew the due Value of the Stock.</p>
            <p>I hope no one will, in this Particular, too ſtrictly adhere to <hi>Hudibras</hi>'s Rule, which implies that nothing is worth more than it will bring: For at preſent it muſt be ſaid, that the <hi>South-Sea</hi> Stock ſells at a Diſcount, and below its Value.</p>
            <p>For were the Stock to be ſold only at 50<hi>l. per Cent.</hi> and every Man ſhould determine to diſpoſe of his own, it would be impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to find Purchaſers for it; and yet the Stock in Reality would be no ways the worſe for it. And to demonſtrate this the more clearly: Suppoſe every Proprietor of a Landed Eſtate ſhould reſolve to ſell it, it would not be poſſible among our ſelves to find Purchaſers at 3 Years Purchaſe for the whole: Though every Man at preſent would look upon an Eſtate at 20 Years Purchaſe, as a moſt extraordinary Bargain: And yet no Man thinks the worſe of his Eſtate, or would be induc'd to part with it upon ſo ſmall a Conſideration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:1211504000:15"/>To judge of the real Value of the Stock, muſt be by the Dividends, the Company will be able to make upon the Stock, and the Continuance of them: And I hope to make it appear, that the Stock is worth 400<hi>l. per Cent.</hi> by ſhewing that the Company is able to divide after the Rate of 30 <hi>per Cent.</hi> upon their Stock, for ſuch a Number of Years, as will reimburſe every Proprietor his full Principal and Intereſt for every Share purchaſed at that Rate.</p>
            <p>Theſe Dividends are to be made good out of the Annual Sums payable by the Go<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vernment, and out of the Profits which the Company gain or make by their Stock.</p>
            <p>Their Profits ariſe three Ways, from the Stock already ſold, the remaining Part to he diſpoſed of, and the Loans upon the Stock.</p>
            <p>I preſume it is not to be expected from a private Perſon to point out at what Times, in what Proportions, and at what Rates the remaining Stock ſhould be diſpoſed of, that being ſubmitted to the Ability and Management of thoſe Gentlemen whoſe P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="5+ letters">

            <p>Whatever further may be thought upon for the Service of the Company, 'tis not to be doubted but the Legiſlative Power will grant every thing reaſonable, to enable them to go thro ſo great an Undertaking, as that of reducing the whole National Debt.</p>
            <p>Having gone through all the Particulars I at firſt propoſed, and endeavour'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the Reaſonableneſs of the <hi>South-Sea</hi> Scheme, as well as to ſhew the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages ariſing thereby; I beg Leave to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs my ſelf to every body, in Defence and Support of the Publick Credit; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1211504000:18"/>
the Evil being from our ſelves, muſt by our ſelves be relieved.</p>
            <p>I ſhall call upon every Body, becauſe no Perſon is unconcerned, as every one will find when 'tis too late, that does not exert himſelf in this Juſt and National Cauſe.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who enjoy Favours from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, are firſt obliged by their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, Example and Advice to engage themſelves and all others over whom they have any Influence in this juſt Cauſe. Thoſe who receive no particular Favours from the Government, but live in the quiet and pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable Enjoyment of their own, and profeſs themſelves and would be treated as Friends to this preſent happy Eſtabliſhment, ought not to be unactive for its Support, much leſs, if not neceſſitated, to make any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to diſtreſs the Publick Credit.</p>
            <p>Thoſe not engaged in the publick Funds, are as much concerned to ſupport the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of them, as thoſe engaged, as all will feel the good or ill Effects of their Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port or Decay.</p>
            <p>A Decay of Credit muſt unavoidably end in a Decay of Subſtance. The Farmer will find no Market to take off the Produce and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1211504000:19"/>
Effects of his Labour, and conſequently be unable to pay his Landlord. The Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants will find no Demands for their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, and the induſtrious Manufacturer no Employment for his Hands. As the Poor will increaſe, the Means of relieving them will leſſen daily.</p>
            <p>Theſe are Circumſtances which ſhould awaken all of us to guard againſt them, as they are more eaſy to be prevented than remedied.</p>
            <p>Let us not join Hands to work out our own Deſtruction, and give up that Peace, Trade and Wealth, which the united Power and Artifices of our Enemies has hitherto in vain laboured to rob us of.</p>
            <p>Let no Man through unjuſt Fears or groundleſs Jealouſies, lock up his Treaſure in his Coffers, and boaſt himſelf upon a Security which will prove imaginary: Let every Man place his Strength in the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Government, and the Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his Country: And as there is no Attempt made to hurt us, let every Man conſider where ſuch Intereſt is allowed, or ſuch Security given for Money, as in Great <hi>Britain</hi>? Where has publick Faith ever been ſo inviolably maintained? What great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1211504000:20"/>
Security can be deſired, where all the publick Funds are appropriated, the Intereſt, Wealth and Credit of the whole Nation is engaged to ſupport, as it now is by the late happy and ſeaſonable Agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Bank of <hi>England</hi> and the <hi>South-Sea</hi> Company?</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, as we are bleſſed with a wiſe and good Prince, a faithfull and able Miniſtry, and a Parliament capable and diſpoſed to concert ſuch Meaſures as tend to the common Intereſt of all: Let us join our Endeavours to their Reſolutions, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve the Difficulties we labour under; then will our Credit ſoon revive, our Trade flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and we become a great, happy and powerful People to all ſucceeding Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations.</p>
