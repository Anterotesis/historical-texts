            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>WHEN Men caſt their Eyes upon Epiſtles of this Kind, from the Name of the Perſon who makes the Addreſs, and of Him who receives it, they uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally have Reaſon to expect Applauſes improper either to be given or accepted by the Parties concern'd. I fear it will, at firſt Sight, be much more ſo in this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, than any other which has at any Time appear'd; but while common Dedications are ſtuff'd with pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Panegyricks, the plain and honeſt Buſineſs of this, is, only to do an Act of Juſtice, and to End a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Miſunderſtanding between the Author, and Him, whom She, here, makes Her Patron. In Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that one knows not how far what We have ſaid of each other, may affect our Character in the World, I take it for an Act of Honour to declare, on my Part, that I have not known a greater Mortification than when I have reflected upon the Severities which have flow'd from a Pen, which is now, You ſee, diſpos'd as much to celebrate and commend You. On Your Part, Your ſincere Endeavour to promote the Reputation
<pb facs="tcp:0048400400:5"/>
and Succeſs of this TRAGEDY, are infallible Teſtimonies of the Candour and Friendſhip you retain for Me. I rejoice in this publick Retribution, and with Pleaſure acknowledge, That I find by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that ſome uſeful Notices which I had the good Fortune to give You for Your Conduct in former Life, with ſome hazard to my Self, were not to be blotted out of Your Memory by any Hardſhips that follow'd them.</p>
            <p>I KNOW You ſo well, that I am aſſur'd You already think I have, on this Subject, ſaid too much; and I am confident You believe of Me, that did I not conceal much more, I ſhould not ſay ſo much. Be then the very Memory of diſagreeable Things forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for ever, and give Me leave to Thank You for Your Kindneſs to this PLAY, and in return, to ſhew towards Your Merit the ſame Good-will. But when my Heart is full, and my Pen ready to expreſs the kindeſt Sentiments to Your Advantage, I reflect upon what I have formerly heard You ſay, That the Fame of a Gentleman, like the Credit of a Merchant, muſt flow from his own intrinſick Value; and that all Means to enlarge it, which do not ariſe naturally from That real Worth, inſtead of promoting the Character of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, did but leſſen and render it ſuſpicious. I leave You therefore, to the great Opportunities, which are daily in Your Power, of beſtowing on Your Self, what no Body elſe can give You; and wiſhing You Health and Proſperity, I omit to dwell upon ſome very late
<pb facs="tcp:0048400400:6"/>
Actions of Yours in Publick, which unhappy Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices made, as little expected from You, as the Zeal and Sollicitude which You ſhew'd for my private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts in the Succeſs of this PLAY. I ſhall ſay no more, truſting to the Gallantry of Your Temper for further Proofs of Friendſhip; and allowing You, like a true Woman, all the good Qualities in the World now I am Pleas'd with You, as well as I gave You all the ill One's when I was Angry with You: I remain with the greateſt Truth,</p>

So much Beauty and good Nature, could not fail of rend'ring that Perſon happy, for whoſe Benefit they were employ'd: I think my ſelf infinitely bleſs'd in their Smiles, ſince I can be ſenſible of no greater Glory, than to hear, that I have had the Honour to Pleaſe Them.</p>
            <p>TO tell the World that Mr. <hi>Booth</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field's</hi> Action was admirable, in the Parts of <hi>LUCIUS</hi> and <hi>ROSALINDA,</hi> is ſaying nothing New; they are ſo us'd to Charm the Audience, and Delight the beſt Judges of the Theatre: However, I beg leave to make them my publick Acknowledgments, and to pleaſe my ſelf with what I have heard reported of their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance in this <hi>PLAY,</hi> which is, That tho' they have
<pb facs="tcp:0048400400:8"/>
often ſhin'd in ſeveral greater Parts, yet, none ever became them better.
