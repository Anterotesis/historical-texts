            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Devil</hi>'s Divinity, ſaid
good old Biſhop <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer</hi>
the Martyr,
when ſome of the
Moderators in Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
were for Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poriſing
between <hi>Popery</hi> and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Religion,</hi> and for not making
a thorough Turn, for fear of the high
Popiſh Party among the People.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0729700300:3"/>
The Caſe was this, and the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of it may be for our Edification.</p>
            <p>The King being ſettled in the
Throne, and having declar'd Himſelf
a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and that as He was
the firſt <hi>Proteſtant</hi> King that ever
wore the Crown, ſo He reſolv'd to
make the firſt avow'd effectual Step
to a Reformation. The good Biſhops,
the godly and zealous Miniſters, and
the religious People of all Kinds, who
had been Sufferers in the late Reign,
and under the Tyranny of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
theſe, I ſay, began to lift up
their Heads, own'd the King warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and encourag'd Him exceedingly
in the bleſſed Work of Pulling up
Popery and Tyranny by the Roots;
and Planting the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion
and Liberty in the Room of it.</p>
            <p>BY THE WAY, you are deſired
to NOTE, <hi>that Popery and Tyranny
went then always together,</hi> tho' Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
has got another Companion
ſince, call'd <hi>High Church</hi>; with the
Reformation came in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liberty,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0729700300:4"/>
that is to ſay, the Perfection of it;
and as that Reformation went on far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and farther, Liberty grew in its
Stature and Strength, till it arriv'd to
where it is now. But of this, on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Occaſion I may ſay more.</p>
            <p>When the Reformation, I ſay, was
thus attempted, the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Clergy,
the <hi>High Church of that Day,</hi> raiſed
a hideous Out-Cry, that <hi>the Church
was in Danger</hi>; and not only ſo, but
poſſeſs'd the ignorant People all over
the Kingdom with ſuch blind Zeal,
and ridiculous Notions, as well of the
King, as of the Reformation, that it
firſt ſpread in a general Diſaffection,
and afterwards broke out into a moſt
dangerous Rebellion, in ſeveral Parts
of the Kingdom, particularly in the
Weſt; where the City of <hi>Exeter</hi> was
cloſely beſieged by 20000 Rebels;
and at <hi>Norwich,</hi> where <hi>KET,</hi> a Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
at the Head of 30000 Men, took
the City twice, and did a great deal
of Miſchief.</p>
            <p>When theſe Rebellions were, by
the Zeal and Loyalty of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0729700300:5"/>
(<hi>Whig</hi>) Party, and by the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
of ſome Foreign Troops, (<hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>)
reduced, and the Rebels had
received the Reward of their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
ſome in the Field, and ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
at the Gallows, it was not
doubted but then, the King being
eſtabliſhed, and his Enemies ſubdued,
the Work of Reformation might go
on without interruption, and that its
Enemies would receive all poſſible
Diſcouragement at Court; the rather,
becauſe it was known, that the true
Settlement of God's Church, and of
the true Religion, was the King's
fix'd Deſign; That as He had Zeal
ſufficient to ſuffer any thing rather
than to give over his juſt Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
ſo He had Courage, even beyond
himſelf, both to ſtand by his Friends,
and to do Juſtice to his Enemies, and
to fear no Man.</p>
            <p>But in the middle of this happy
Scituation of Things, a curſed Spirit
of Trimming, call'd at that Time <hi>State
Policy,</hi> thruſt it ſelf in among the
great Men at Court; and had not
the Courage, Steddineſs, and Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0729700300:6"/>
of the King, tho' not at that
Time fully acquainted with the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi>
Government, interpoſed, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
had been ruin'd, and cruſh'd
in its Birth; all the Blood and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
ſpent, all the long ſtruggle of
the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Party in the preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Reign, and all the Expectations
the World had entertained of a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Eſtabliſhment in this Nation, had
been loſt and deſtroyed; indeed, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all the King could do,
and even in ſpight of his Reſolution
to the contrary, it did make great
Impreſſions upon his Affairs, and great
Havock among his Friends; brought
his Friends to fall out and quarrel
with one another, and obliged the
mildeſt and moſt merciful King on
Earth to ſign the Execution of his
neareſt Friends; and now, as one
<hi>Party,</hi> then another, got uppermoſt
in the Adminiſtration, the poor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
<hi>Prince</hi> was oblig'd to act now
this Way, then that Way, contrary
even to his own Inclination, and
ſometimes almoſt contrary to his
Principle.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0729700300:7"/>
We, who are the Poſterity of thoſe
<hi>Reformers,</hi> and who now enjoy our
Liberty and Religion, as the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of that excellent Prince's Zeal
and Sincerity in <hi>Religion,</hi> have reaſon
to be thankful that He ſtood his
Ground in religious Matters; and had
He with the ſame ſteddineſs and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
governed his turbulent, merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
and ever-claſhing, diſagreeing
Courtiers, we had, perhaps, enjoy'd
many Ages ago an Inheritance of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
which the World are not yet
acquainted with; for 'tis evident, that
the Pride, the Ambition, the Avarice
and Envy which reign'd among the
Miniſters of that Reign, ſo effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſconcerted their Meaſures, and
divided their Intereſts, that they could
not ſupport the Settlement of the
Succeſſion beyond the Life of that
King, but fell firſt off from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and then fell all in with <hi>Mary,</hi>
the Daughter of King <hi>Henry,</hi> who
was declared Illegitimate, was ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
by the Eſtabliſhment, and was
no better at that Time than a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Pretender; and had not a more
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0729700300:8"/>
Maſculine Spirit govern'd them in
the next Reign after, tho' in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of a Woman, we had, as the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of thoſe Court Diviſions, been all
at this time Papiſts and Slaves, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters
in our religious Conduct, and
mean dejected Scoundrels in our civil
Conduct, and ſuch would our Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
have been alſo.</p>
            <p>The Secret Hiſtory of this Devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Court Snare, I mean as to the
religious Part, and as well what Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
it put the Reformation in, as
alſo how it was quaſh'd with one
noble ſteddy Word of that reſolute and
pious Prince, muſt needs be very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
and profitable to all that read
it, eſpecially at a time, when the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
of the ſame Reformation are
trying the ſame Helliſh Practices up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the very ſame Nation.</p>
            <p>The Sum of the Story is this: The
King being young in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
at his firſt Acceſſion to the
Crown, was however very happily
ſurrounded with grave and wiſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers,
in whoſe Wiſdom and Fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0729700300:9"/>
Vigilance and Courage, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
had a full ſatisfaction: They
fought his Battles abroad with Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry,
and with Succeſs; they go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
his Affairs at Home with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Sagacity, Judgment, Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and Juſtice: The very Name
of the King began to be terrible to
Popery; The Mobbs and Tumults
abated, as well as the Rebellious were
quaſh'd, and which was ſtill better
than all, the general Diſaffection of
the People began to wear off, and
the publick Affairs ſeemed to run with
a full Channel into Peace and Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement,
when two unhappy things,
which on a ſudden broke out among
the Courtiers and Miniſters of State,
had like to have overthrown Peace,
Settlement, Religion, nay, King and
all.</p>
            <p>Theſe were,
<list>
                  <item>1. Trimming, and Temporizing in
the Reformation. And,</item>
                  <item>2. Diviſion and Faction among the
Courtiers.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0729700300:10"/>
I'll be very brief in the Account
I ſhall give of theſe Two unhappy
things, and yet I deſire ſo to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
the Circumſtances, and ſo faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to relate the Conduct of the
Perſons, that the Warning it may be
to future Ages may be flagrant, and
the Moral or Improvement may revive
with the Story.</p>
            <p>The Rebellious juſt now mention'd,
had been in behalf of, or rather on
the Pretence of Zeal for the Church,
and it had been indeed a moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Criſis to have ſuch bold and
deſperate attempts made in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy
of the King's Affairs.</p>
            <p>Some of the <hi>States Men,</hi> who were
in the Main real Friends to the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi>
and very faithful to the
King and his Intereſt, yet intimida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a little by the Dangers they had
been in, and by the Daily Inſolence
and Threats of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Party,
who were ſtill very numerous in the
Country, ſtarted very unhappily, and
in an ill Hour, this wretched Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0729700300:11"/>
or Notion, (<hi>viz.</hi>) That it was
too bold an attempt for the King,
to undertake to make a thorough
<hi>Reformation</hi> at once upon the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
that it would exaſperate the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Party, and as they had power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Alliances abroad, and formidable
Numbers at Home, they would not
only be always Plotting againſt the
publick Peace, but that it was too
probable they might ſome time or
other get the Start of them, and
ruine them all; and that therefore it
were but good <hi>State Policy</hi> to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porize
a little, to go on by Degrees,
and to act with <hi>Popery,</hi> as ſome of
the good Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> did with
Idolatry, of whom it was ſaid, <hi>They
did that which was right in the Sight of the
Lord. Nevertheleſs the high Places were
not taken away, but the People burnt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe
yet in the high Places,</hi> 2 Chron.
XX. 33.</p>
            <p>In like manner, they were for let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the <hi>Reformation</hi> go on gradual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
leaving ſuch of the <hi>Reliques</hi> of
<hi>Popery</hi> as were of leſs Conſequence
for a while unreformed, admitting a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0729700300:12"/>
Mixture of Papiſts and Proteſtants
into their Councils and Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that the former might be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
be engaged by the Court Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
and Preferments, to embark no
more with, or encourage the People
in their Diſaffection; Nor did it end
in this Propoſal of a <hi>motley Miniſtry,</hi>
but even a <hi>motley Reformation</hi> was
to be the Conſequence, and the High
Church were to be ſo blended with
the low, that is to ſay, Papiſt with
Proteſtant, and ſo much of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques</hi>
of Popery were to have been
left in the new Eſtabliſhment of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
that as a famous States Man
of that Day, who had more Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
than all of them, ſaid, meaning
the Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> They would ſet
up a Religion that was neither Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt
nor Proteſtant, that God would
not own, nor themſelves under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.</p>
            <p>When
this Project was laid before
the King, He cauſed the Arch-Biſhop
of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to read it over to Him.
But it diſguſted Him extremely; and
when the other Biſhops began to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0729700300:13"/>
ſpeak in Favour of it, the King, who
had more Courage and Honeſty than
all of them, anſwered in that memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Expreſſion of Scripture, <hi>Curſed
be he that doth the Work of the Lord
deceitfully</hi>: And when another Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
asked a little tartly, <hi>What then
muſt be done? Shall we be always
fighting about difficult Queſtions?</hi> The
King ſtill ſtanding ſteady to his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and ſhewing an abhorrence of
the Cowardice and Treachery of his
Courtiers, riſing up in ſome Heat,
replied in the Words of our Saviour,
<hi>Every Plant which my Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
has not Planted ſhall be rooted
up</hi>; and no Man durſt move any
thing of that Kind to Him ever after.</p>
            <p>This Zeal and Courage of the King
eſtabliſhed the Reformation.</p>
            <p>This Trimming and Treachery,
would have ſent them all back to
Popery.</p>
            <p>Leaving this Hiſtory to be cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
applied, as Occaſion ſhall offer, I
proceed to the ſecond Thing which
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0729700300:14"/>
ruined the Peace of that bleſſed King's
Reign, and which, as I have ſaid,

only, by which to repreſent to our
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0729700300:15"/>
preſent People, the Dangers which
might poſſibly happen upon taking
in their Enemies, to fortifie and form
Intereſts againſt their Friends, and to
ſupport their ſeveral Parties one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
another, it might have been
thrown by and diſregarded as the
Chimera of a ſcribbling Head, which
had in it no more than ſuch People
generally produce.</p>
            <p>But as it is a real Hiſtory, the
Matters of Fact upon Record, and
the Truth of them not to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted;
as the Tragical Part which
follow'd was acted upon the Stage
of our own Country, and the Fire
and Faggot of their Popiſh Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
ſmoaked in our own Streets,
as it was not long ago, and the
Ruine of thoſe who ſuffered under it
is felt in our Families even to this
Day, it comes with the greater E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nergy
upon us, the Force of it is
not to be reſiſted, nor can the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
given from it be called unjuſt or
improper.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0729700300:16"/>
Like Cauſes produce like Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
in all Ages, or at leaſt, may
do ſo; it may not therefore be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
to look briefly over the Court
Diviſions of that <hi>Reign,</hi> and ſee how
they began, how they were carried
on, and how it came to paſs that
the beſt and only Eſtabliſhment of
thoſe Times for a Proteſtant Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
was overthrown and deſtroyed,
meerly and only by the Contention
and Diviſions of the great Men at
Court; and in doing this, we may
take ſome notice of their Perſons.</p>
            <p>The Great Men at Court in that
Day, conſiſted of the Duke of <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet,</hi>
prime Miniſter, Uncle to and
Protector of the King, Captain Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and <hi>Commander</hi> in <hi>Chief</hi> of all
his Forces; the Duke of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi>
formerly Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi>
of the antient Family of <hi>Dudley</hi>;
Mr. <hi>Stanhope,</hi> a great Friend and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtant
to the Duke of <hi>Somerſet</hi>; Mr.
<hi>Cecil,</hi> Secretary of State; the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs
of <hi>Northampton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0729700300:17"/>
Among theſe, it is neceſſary to
give a brief Deſcription of a few;
The Two contending Factions, and
which made moſt ſtir with their
Strife, were the two Dukes of <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet</hi>
and <hi>Northumberland,</hi> commonly
known in thoſe dangerous Times,
when People durſt not ſpeak plain,
by the Diſtinction of Duke <hi>Blue,</hi>
and Duke <hi>Green,</hi> of which I can give
no other Account than by Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that the one being a <hi>Southern</hi>
Title, had reference to the Garter of
St. <hi>George.</hi> And the other being a
<hi>Northern</hi> Title, might have the like
to that of St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> whoſe Enſigns
are the Blue and Green Ribband
But I do not find that the Perſon
was ever received as a Knight of that
Order.</p>
            <p>Duke <hi>Blue</hi> had great Perſonal Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and was exceedingly beloved
both by the King and the People; he
was an able <hi>States Man,</hi> and a very
great <hi>Soldier</hi>; he had by his Wiſdom
and Prudence greatly aſſiſted in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3+ letters">
                  <desc>•••…</desc>
               </gap>g
the Prince upon the Throne,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0729700300:18"/>
and was his laſt reſort for <hi>Council</hi>;
for as he had a great Intereſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the People by his Fame, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Nobility by his great Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liances
with the beſt Families; ſo he
had a Mind always preſent to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in the greateſt Exigence, and
was eſteemed to be the beſt Man of
<hi>Council</hi> of that Age, eſpecially upon
any dangerous Juncture. In the
Field, he was ſuperior to himſelf, if I
may ſo ſay; I mean, that there he
excelled not only all Mankind, but
even outdid all his own other Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies;
and this he ſhew'd at that
memorable Battle of <hi>Pinkie,</hi> by which,
as well as on many other Occaſions,
he had in the preceeding Reigns made
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Arms, as well as his own
<hi>Conduct,</hi> terrible to the World.</p>
            <p>Having ſaid thus much of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
it cannot be omitted, becauſe
ſomething of it will come neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be mention'd hereafter, that he
was not more happy in his own
<hi>Character,</hi> than he was unfortunate in
that of his Wife; a Woman of a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0729700300:19"/>
terrible Spirit, inſupportably Haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Turbulent, Covetous, Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
Revengeful, and being withal
buſie and medling in publick Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
puſh'd her Husband upon the
worſt Scenes of his Life, and which
indeed ended in his Ruine. I have
only to add, that as their <hi>Charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
were the Reverſe of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſo was the influence they had
in the World; one being exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beloved, and the other univerſally
hated by the People.</p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>Green</hi> was of a <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter</hi>
quite different from the other,
having very few good Qualities to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
him; the beſt that could be
ſaid of him was, that he was of a very
great and antient Family, famous for
Heroes, and Men of Gallantry and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
and was himſelf a Man of a da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and enterpriſing Courage. But
tho' he had on many Occaſions ſhewn
his Gallantry in Action, yet he was by
moſt thought fitter to Command un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
another, than to lead Armies as
General in Chief; yet in this it was
thought he had the Misfortune to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
from common Fame in the Opinion
of himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0729700300:20"/>
He ſerv'd under Duke <hi>Blue,</hi> at the
great Battle of <hi>Pinkie</hi>; but was very
willing to have it ſaid, that the great Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
obtained that Day, was owing
more to his Conduct, than that of the
General, and had ſometimes the Vanity
to ſay, that if he had had the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
the War would have been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on more to the King's Advantage;
however, as Duke <hi>Blue</hi> conſented after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to leave the Conduct of the War
to him for one Campaign, it did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
            <p>In
a Word, tho' they both appear'd
Friends to the King, and to his Intereſt,
and on all Occaſions acted with their
utmoſt for his Service, yet it was well
known they were not cordial Friends to
one another; but did one another in
their Turn all the ill Offices they could,
till it brought Duke <hi>Blue</hi> firſt to the
Block, and Duke <hi>Green</hi> followed in a
very little while after, the ſame Way.</p>
            <p>In the Fate of Duke <hi>Blue,</hi> followed
ſeveral of his faſt Friends, for Men of
ſuch Figure ſeldom fall alone, Mr. <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hope,</hi>
Sir <hi>Ralph Vane,</hi>
               <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                  <desc> _____ </desc>
               </gap> and ſeveral others, were put to
Death, tho' all innocent, being meer
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0729700300:21"/>
Sacrifices to the political Rage of Duke
<hi>Green</hi>; and the King himſelf, who lived
but a little while after, yet lived to be
ſatisfied of their Innocence, and to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in the moſt moving Terms, the
fatal Diviſions of his Miniſters, which
had brought him to cut off his moſt
faithful Servants, and had impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, in a moſt vile Manner, to ſhut
his Ears againſt the Remonſtrances of
his beſt Friends in their Favour; the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Remembrance of which, follow'd the
good Prince to his Grave.</p>
            <p>After the King's Death, Duke <hi>Green,</hi>
who was the chief Favourite of the
Succeſſor, aſſumed the Prime Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry
and Management of Affairs. But
the <hi>Pretender</hi> got ground every Day,
tho' really, more by the Hatred the
People bore to Duke <hi>Green,</hi> than from
any real Diſaffection to the Succeſſor;
at length the Proteſtant Succeſſor was
entirely abandoned by the Nation, tho'
a Perſon of the moſt amiable Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
moſt agreeable and engaging Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and moſt perfect Virtue in the
World.</p>
            <p>Thus a Popiſh Pretender was brought
in, the Proteſtant Cauſe was loſt, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0729700300:22"/>
the Proteſtant Succeſſor Depoſed and
Murther'd, purely from the Hatred the
People bore to the wicked Actions of
him, who was then Head of the Party;
whoſe Conduct was always raſh and
fooliſh, and who having broken the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and Harmony which was before
happily carried on thro' all the publick
Affairs, had divided the Court, ſome
one Way, ſome another, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
had taken into the Adminiſtration
People of quite differing Principles from
the King, and of views differing from
his Intereſt; which, it ſeems, he did at
all Hazards, only to make his Party
ſtrong againſt his Enemy; nor was
Duke <hi>Blue,</hi> but eſpecially his Wife, back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in the ſame unhappy Meaſures,
making uſe of their Power with the
King, to bring in, and keep in ſeveral
People, both in the Army, in the Navy,
and in the Civil Affairs, ſuch People as
were not Friends to His Majeſty's Intereſt,
ſo be it they were Friends to their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and willing to engage againſt their
Oppoſers.</p>
            <p>This being the Practice on both ſides,
they declar'd openly againſt one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and were openly called by the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0729700300:23"/>
Neuters at Court, as well as by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the <hi>Blue Faction,</hi> and the <hi>Green
Faction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was indeed another Sort, which
was called the <hi>third Party</hi>; theſe were
headed by Mr. <hi>Cecil,</hi> one of the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries
of State, and by the Perſon who
principally managed the King's Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
whoſe Name I do not remember;
but they were too weak to carry on any
Deſign, and the King alſo was prevailed
with to diſcountenance them, or at leaſt,
not to ſhew them that Favour which
they at firſt expected, ſo that they
were able to do little; and the <hi>Blue</hi> and
<hi>Green</hi> Factions drawing all to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
theſe ſoon loſt their principal Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents,
who were drawn in to ſide
with one Faction or the other, as their
Profits or Deſigns led them on.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Chancellor,</hi> he was a weak,
or rather, indolent Perſon, whoſe Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
was not extraordinary, and his
Body infirm; and Duke <hi>Green</hi> having
no kindneſs for him, and yet not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to puſh directly at him, becauſe he
thought the King had ſome kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
for him, perſuaded him to reſign
the Seals; he having deſired to loſe his
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0729700300:24"/>
Place with as little Diſgrace as poſſible.
The Seals were ſoon after given to a
Perſon quite in another Intereſt.</p>
            <p>From theſe Diſſentions and Diviſions
at Court, ſays a Reverend Hiſtorian of
thoſe Times, it followed, that nothing
was ſeen during that bleſſed King's Reign
but Troubles, Commotions, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiets,
both in Church and State, till
Way was made, by the Diſtractions of
the State, to overthrow the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
deſtroy the Reformation, and
let in Popery and Perſecution in the
Reign that followed.</p>
            <p>It is time to turn to our own Times,
to which we may make a ſudden Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
without letting drop the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of what has been ſaid. It had que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſs
been a piece of very happy
Advice, whoever had given it, if ſome
clear ſighted Perſon had in thoſe Days
earneſtly preſs'd and adviſed the States-Men
of King <hi>Edward</hi> to unite in their
Duty to the King, and their Care of
the Common-wealth, and not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
their Avarice or Ambition, their
Pride, or their Paſſions, to have any
ſhare in the Meaſures they were taking;
but to carry on the Publick Affairs with
Zeal, for the good of their Country, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0729700300:25"/>
the Intereſt of their Sovereign; fortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the King's Intereſt, by the good A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
of his Servants, and the Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of his Councellors, which had they
done, they were able enough to have
tranſmitted the Crown to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Succeſſor, after the King's Death,
in ſpight of all that <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Popiſh</hi>
Intereſts could do to the contrary. For
it was even then true, that the Intereſt
of the Popiſh Succeſſor had very little,
if any Foundation in this Kingdom, but
what was founded among <hi>Proteſtants</hi>
themſelves; making good that old Axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ome
of Policy, that <hi>England</hi> can never be
ruined, or her Liberties deſtroy'd, by
any Power other than her own. So that
it was the Ignorance, Weakneſs, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> that ſet the Crown
at that Time on the Head of <hi>Popery,</hi>
not the real Power of the <hi>Papiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether there may be any Parallel
drawn from thoſe Times to the preſent,
is not ſo much the Deſign of this Work,
as it is to caution the greateſt Men of
the preſent Age againſt the Miſchiefs of
Dividing and Separating themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Parties and Factions of any kind, as
the only fatal thing that can befal them
and the whole Kingdom at this Time,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0729700300:26"/>
and leave the next Reign expoſed to the
Diſaſter of a <hi>Popiſh Succeſſor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The whole Body of the People of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
ſeems now to be united under the
Reign of King <hi>George,</hi> and that Union is
ſettled and confirmed by the ſteddy Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
of his Majeſty's Affairs; by
a well choſen Miniſtry, Faction is found
at preſent only among the Defeated Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and their Diſappointments are made
irretrievable only by the Vigilance and
Unanimity of his Majeſty's Councils
and Meaſures.</p>
            <p>By the ſame Rule, if that Vigilance
and Unanimity abates; if ſome draw one
Way, ſome another; if the Miniſters of
State let go the Reins of the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,
and fall out one with another;
if theſe Conquerors fall out about divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Spoil, where is the Strength
of the Adminiſtration? What will all the
Victory they now triumph in amount
to? Faction will quit the routed Party
immediately, and harbour her hated
Head in the Verge of the very Houſhold:
And what will follow, Diviſions, Envy,
making and ſtrengthening of Parties at
<hi>Court,</hi> fortifying Intereſts, and ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themſelves with Numbers, ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling
for Places, and bringing in Friends;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0729700300:27"/>
and thus, in a Word, the <hi>Civil War</hi> will
be tranſpoſed from the remote Parts to
the very Walls of the King's Palace,
and which is worſt of all, to the very
inſide of thoſe Walls.</p>
            <p>And not to repreſent Things in a
more dangerous Poſture than they real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
will repreſent themſelves, I ſhall lay
down a little the uſual Riſe and Progreſs
of Court Diviſions.</p>
            <p>Court Diviſions generally ſpring
from two Fountains, <hi>Avarice</hi> and <hi>Envy</hi>;
I know there are two ſofter Words to be
given it, which are more Courtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
but not more ſignificant, nor ſo
juſtly adapted to deſcribe the thing,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) <hi>Ambition.</hi> and <hi>Emulation</hi>; but I
keep to the Terms. I think all the
Ambition we now ſee practiſed may be
well ſtyled Avarice, and all their Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
centers in Envy.</p>
            <p>Theſe creep inſenſibly into Courts,
the firſt Diſcovery of it we find in the
Great Men engroſſing Places of vaſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
many of them into one Hand; we
ſaw lately a great Man poſſeſt of about
ſeven, if not more, Places of immenſe
Profit, and juſtly diſmiſs'd for not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
content with that.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0729700300:28"/>
This prompts them to heave and
thruſt at one another, Picquing and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balling
to ſupport themſelves, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant
others; whether this be the Caſe
among us now or not, it is not my Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to enquire; it's evident this has fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
been the Caſe in the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Court in former Times, and it is as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
and for this Reaſon I mention it,
that this Party-making and dividing at
Court, never yet failed to overthrow
and turn out the Party that's ſo divided;
and if this ſhould be the Caſe now, what
have we to expect?</p>
            <p>Wherefore the People of <hi>England</hi> are
more than ordinarily concerned to uſe
the utmoſt Intereſt they have in the
preſent great Miniſters, or thoſe to
whom the Adminiſtration is intruſted,
to perſuade, intreat, and in ſhort, warn
them againſt dividing their Intereſt.</p>
            <p>To begin this Perſuaſion, I ſhall take
the Liberty to tell a ſhort Story, which
I am able to Name the Perſons too who
were concerned.</p>
            <p>Soon after the Reſtoration of King
<hi>Charles</hi> the IId. when the Civil War
was laid aſleep by the general Act of
Oblivion, many of the old Round-Head
Party began to appear openly,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0729700300:29"/>
who had skulkt about for fear of the
Revenge of the Cavalier Party when
they ſhould come in, and who expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be proſcrib'd and excepted, as is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual,
in the general Pardon.</p>
            <p>One Major <hi>Gladman,</hi> an old Soldier,
and who had been very much concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Governing Party, was ſitting
in a Coffee-Houſe in the City ſmoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Pipe, when an antient Gentleman
in a long Shoulder Belt, which was at
that Time the Badge of a Cavalier,
came and ſat by him; he began very
high with him, Are not you ſuch a
Man, Sir? Yes, Sir, replies the Major:
Then you are one of thoſe Fools, Sir, ſays
he, that have managed this poor Nation
after your wretched manner, and muſt
give an Account to Heaven for what
you have done.</p>
            <p>We muſt ſo, Sir, replies the Major;
but, Sir, ſince the King has been pleaſed
to give an Act of Oblivion, and all theſe
Things are laid aſleep Sir, it is not the
kindeſt thing Gentlemen can do to us,
to inſult us with it, when we have no
freedom to reply.</p>
            <p>Yes, yes, the Act of Oblivion has
buried it, ſays the old Gentleman, and
I am not going to revive that; but
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0729700300:30"/>
Heaven will call you all to Account for
being the moſt unaccountableſt Fools in
the World, that when He had given
you Victory, and committed the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to your Government, and we poor
Cavaliers durſt not ſhow our Faces in
the World, you, in a ſhameful and
moſt contemptible manner, pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
one another to pieces for the Spoil;
and giving up all your Advantages,
brought us in again with your own
Hands. Are you not a Parcel of Fools?</p>
            <p>Indeed, Sir, ſays the Major, you have
toucht us in a ſore Place; if our Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
had not opened a Door for you, it
was impoſſible you could ever have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned.</p>
            <p>Let
all thoſe who God and King
<hi>George</hi> have entruſted with any ſhare of
the Honour and Truſts of the preſent
Government, ſtand warned by ſuch a
Story as this. Nothing can wound the
preſent <hi>Intereſt</hi> of King <hi>George,</hi> nothing can
give Life to his Enemies, nothing can
revive the Jacobite Cauſe, in a Word,
nothing can effectually ruine us now,
but dividing.</p>
            <p>Not all the Power of <hi>France</hi> can hurt
us, we ſee that cringing, and reduced,
and complying with any Conditions
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0729700300:31"/>
to get an Alliance with us for their
own Preſervation.</p>
            <p>Not all the other Popiſh Powers of
<hi>Europe</hi> can hurt us; we ſee them ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing
and entreating to be admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the ſame Alliance for their Security.</p>
            <p>Not all the Jacobite High-flying Party
at Home; we ſee them reduced, and the
Pallace of the King crouded with Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners,
begging Reprieves for their
principal Leaders, to ſave them from
the Scaffold and the Gallows.</p>
            <p>What then can hurt us, what can
be capable to weaken our Hands, ſo
ſtrengthen'd by Conqueſt? to weaken
our Meaſures directed by ſuch Heads,
to ſlacken the Reins of our Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,
committed to ſuch; nothing
but private Feuds and Factions, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Diviſions among our ſelves;
and then no Government is ſo fixt, no
King ſo eſtabliſh'd, no Conſtitution
ſo well founded, but it will undo, and
overthrow it.</p>
            <p>Let us go among the High Party,
and hear what they ſay, and indeed
we need go no farther to confirm
the Argument, what is it has given
Life to their dejected Souls, bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0729700300:32"/>
their Countenances, and put their
Expectations again upon the Wing.</p>
            <p>It was but the other Day that
all their broken Reeds having fail'd
them, they were brought to give up
their Cauſe, and to confeſs they had
nothing left to do but to deſpair.</p>
            <p>Now they are another People; they
promiſe themſelves new Scenes, flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
themſelves with new Hopes, and
encourage one another to new Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs;
we ſee their Leaders meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Cabals, great Conferences held
upon the preſent Scituation of their
Affairs, and Meaſures taken with aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
of Succeſs, for the Forming
their Intereſt, and Propagating their
Cauſe, even to <hi>Avignon</hi> it ſelf the
Encouragement is ſpread; and we have
Letters from thence, which ſay, their
Friends in <hi>England</hi> give them En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to look for great Things
in their Favour, for that, ſay they,
we are aſſured there are great Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
at Court; that the <hi>Whigs</hi> are
fallen out among themſelves; that
<hi>Argyle</hi> being out on one Hand, and
<hi>T<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>_…</desc>
                  </gap>d</hi> on the other, great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
are made to bring them in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0729700300:33"/>
again, which there is ſome hopes of;
that, on the contrary, great Parties
are made againſt them; and that by
means of theſe Diſſentions, the Friends
to another Intereſt are careſs'd more
than uſual; for that States Men ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
value who they take into Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
if it be found neceſſary to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
them againſt their Opppoſers.</p>
            <p>To conclude, the beſt Conſtruction
which I can make of the whole Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is, in Favour of this Intelligence
from <hi>Avignon,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi>) that it is a
meer piece of Jacobite News; that
indeed it is an idle Rumour, or a
malicious one; that it is impoſſible
it ſhould be true; and that the Caſe
at Court ſtands directly thus, and
no otherwiſe, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That there is an entire Harmony
and Unity in every Part of the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration</hi>
among the <hi>Miniſters of
State</hi>; that there is not ſo much as
the leaſt Jealouſie, Uneaſineſs, or Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtanding
among them; that a
perfect Friendſhip and good Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence
ſpreads it ſelf through the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0729700300:34"/>
Minds and <hi>Management</hi> of all the
great Men at Court, and an exact
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> in their Meaſures; that if
there is any Ambition among them,
it is only in the great Struggle, to
render their Auguſt Maſter the beſt
Services; be moſt vigilant for his
Safety, and moſt vigorous in Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
to his Enemies the Jacobites.</p>
            <p>Conſequently, that all the Rumours
ſpread aborad of <hi>Factions</hi> in the Court,
and of Diviſions into Parties looking
this Way, and that Way, are Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical,
Groundleſs, and of no Value,
and are not to be regarded other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
than to let us ſee, to what the
Jacobite <hi>Intereſt</hi> tends, what they
drive at, and what we are to expect
from them, if ever that fatal Time
ſhould come, when the <hi>Miniſters of
State</hi> ſhould break and divide from
one another, and open the Gaps and
Breaches which the Proteſtant Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
had ſo happily cloſed.</p>
            <p>The Reaſons in Particular which I
give, why I cannot believe any ſuch
Rumour, and why I muſt believe that

               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0729700300:37"/>
all theſe Accounts of <hi>Diviſions</hi> among
the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> come from a Wicked,
Deſperate, Jacobite Party, who deſire
to ſow Strife among us all, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
a Harveſt to their Party from it;
I ſay, the Reaſons of this <hi>Opinion</hi> of
mine, are ſuch as theſe:<list>
                  <item>1. Becauſe I take the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> to
be honeſt Men, and their Honeſty is
engaged.</item>
                  <item>2. Becauſe I take them to be no
Fools, and their Senſes are engaged.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>It is no time to flatter great Men,
and ſpeak fine Words to them, becauſe
they are in Figure and Authority; the
Nation is intereſted in their Conduct,
and will be injur'd or advantag'd as
they behave.</p>
            <p>We have boaſted of them hitherto,
and hope we have had Reaſon; we have
ſung their Fame, and inſulted the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
when they have attempted to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame
and leſſen them on any Account
whatever; we have reſted upon them
in a full expectation of their anſwering
the beſt Things we could ſay.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0729700300:38"/>
We have upbraided the <hi>Tories</hi> with
their corrupt Adminiſtration, their gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying
their Avarice, their Ambition,
their Revenge; with betraying their
Queen, and Country, and Poſterity, to
puſh their ſeparate Intereſts; After we
had run a Length of Reproaches up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their want of Honeſty, their Vices,
their falſhood to their Oaths, their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
their Country to <hi>French</hi> and
<hi>Popiſh</hi> Tyranny, and their being of
mercenary Turn-coat Principles; do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all this to ſerve the <hi>French,</hi> who
had bought them; and the Clergy,
who had debauch'd the, I ſay, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
we had loaded them with all that
they deſerved on this Account; how
did we at laſt laugh at them for Fools
in their Politicks, weakening and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
their new Schemes, and blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up all their own <hi>Mines,</hi> by breaking
among themſelves, and dividing into
Factions and Parties.</p>
            <p>Did we not tell them, they were
whetting the Knives that would cut
their own Throats, and building the
Scaffolds for their own Execution?
Did we not ſet ſtill and laugh at them,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0729700300:39"/>
for opening the Gaps, at which we
told them, we, the <hi>Whigs,</hi> would enter
and blow them all up? Did we not fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
ſay, that tho' they were ſuch
Knaves as to deſign the <hi>Pretender,</hi> yet
they were withal ſuch Fools, as to bring
in the Houſe of <hi>Hanover</hi> for us, by
the meer Madneſs of their Meaſures?</p>
            <p>What could the Houſe of <hi>Hanover,</hi>
before the King's Acceſſion, deſire more;
or what News could they have deſir'd
more agreeable, more ſatisfactory, than
that their Enemies in the late Miniſtry
were divided, that they were falling
out for Places, and ſetting up Factions
in the Court one againſt another, for
engroſſing the <hi>Adminiſtration?</hi> Was not
this to tell them in plain Words, that
they were not fit for the Poſt they
were in, and that nothing was to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
from them, but that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the Crown ſhould deſcend, they
would either break quite in Pieces, and
vaniſh into nothing, leaving the Way
open for their Enemies to come in
without Reſiſtance; or that they would
be tripping up one another's Heels, to
ſee who ſhould be foremoſt in Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the reſt to the <hi>Succeſſor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0729700300:40"/>
Nor were we in the Wrong in our
Judgment, for juſt thus it was; and
the Event has proved them as great
Fools in their Dividing, as they could
be Knaves in their firſt Uniting.</p>
            <p>Will it be leſs true in the preſent
Caſe, if we could believe any thing of
the Rumours that are ſpread; Can the
Honeſty or the Senſes of the preſent
Miniſtry be ſpoken of with the leaſt
Satisfaction, if they ſhould act thus?
Would they not be the moſt Unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
of all Men that ever pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Uſe of Reaſon, and the worſt
of all Lunaticks? It cannot therefore
be, it muſt all be a Slander, an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
curſed high Church Slander. To

                  </gap>le</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
it muſt be regarded like the Gaſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nades
of the <hi>Tories,</hi> when they told us
of the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Marr</hi>'s mighty Forces,
the terrible Fortifications he had raiſed
about <hi>Perth,</hi> the vaſt Levies making
for him abroad, and the great Succours
he had received from <hi>France</hi>; which
appeared at laſt to be only a great Miſt,
that waſted before the <hi>Sun</hi>; a great
Croud, which ſeparated and diſappear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0729700300:41"/>
at the Approach of but Ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Men.</p>
            <p>The Circumſtances of the preſent
Miniſtry confirm us in this Opinion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo;
they have the moſt happy <hi>Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
in their Hands, that ever this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
enjoy'd, ſecur'd by victorious
Troops, a ſteddy and unanimous Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and an eaſie ſatisfied People;
they are ſupported by a wiſe and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous
Prince, ſtrong in his Intereſt
abroad, growing in the Affections of
the People at home; Rebellion, like
the Dragon under the Feet of St. <hi>George,</hi>
is conquer'd, and lies grovelling in the
Duſt; <hi>Jacobitiſm</hi> is reduc'd to a <hi>State</hi>
of <hi>Deſpair</hi>; <hi>Popery</hi> has laid by its Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions;
and ſuppliant <hi>France</hi> ſeeks
Aid at our Court againſt her own <hi>State</hi>
Factions.</p>
            <p>The preſent <hi>Miniſtry</hi> have nothing
to wiſh which they do not enjoy, they
have nothing to do but to Congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
one another, and enjoy in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
the full Favour of their Prince, do
their Duty, and receive the Reward of
their Fidelity.</p>
            <p>Can it be poſſible then that theſe
Men ſhould fall out with one another?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0729700300:42"/>
Can there be Room among them
for Ambition, or Envy, or Faction, ſo
much as to put a Foot in? no, 'tis
impoſſible. Do they not ſwim in a full
Sea of the King's Bounty? Are not all
their Foes made their Footſtool? Have
they not all that, one would think, Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice
or Ambition could prompt them
to ask? What can they without bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
deſire of their Country more than
they enjoy?</p>
            <p>For theſe Men to fall out, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
into Factions and Parties, what
would it be, but to tell the World,
that they are not the Men they have
been taken for; that however they
have made Pretences to be diſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted,
and to have ſerv'd King <hi>George</hi>
purely for the Juſtice of his Cauſe,
and the good of their Country, that
yet they are true <hi>States Men,</hi> that they
are of the ſame Mold with others that
went before them; that their aim has
been all along their own Intereſt, the
ſatisfying their own voratious Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites,
and the moſt unbounded Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice;
that Pride, and the worſt ſort
of Ambition, has been the Helm that
ſteers all their Actions, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0729700300:43"/>
but to be above one another,
can make Peace among them; in a
Word, that every Man wants to be
prime <hi>Miniſter,</hi> and cannot bear to
ſee any <hi>Man</hi> have a Share of Power
or of Favour equal with himſelf; in
which they muſt make good Mr.
<hi>Dryden</hi>'s ſaying reverſe, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Courtiers of every Party are the ſame.</p>
            <p>For theſe Men to divide, and bandy
againſt one another, as it has been
ſcandalouſly ſaid of them, would be
to tell the World, they have no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
for King <hi>George,</hi> no regard to
his Intereſt, no concern for his Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or his Family; that they ſerve
Him only for what they can get
by Him, and in Hopes of getting
the ſupreme Management under Him;
and care not what Hazard they run
of his Intereſt, to ſecure their own.
For this Reaſon, one cannot without
the greateſt Contempt of their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
and Deſigns, and thinking them
the moſt Perfidious Generation of
Men in the World, I ſay, one <hi>cannot</hi>
ſo much as entertain a Notion of
their being any ways Guilty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:0729700300:44"/>
Should Diviſion and Faction creep
in among the preſent <hi>Mannagers</hi> of
Affairs, what muſt we expect? in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
what may we not expect, but
that the whole Party ſhould divide
as they divide, and where will this
end? <hi>If a Kingdom divided againſt its
ſelf cannot ſtand,</hi> how ſhall a Party
divided againſt it ſelf be ſupported?
And if this preſent <hi>Intereſt,</hi> divide
again, what is before them, but
that the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of the <hi>Tories,</hi> and
the <hi>Pretender,</hi> which has been bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and trampled under Foot, purely
by the Harmony and Unanimity of
<hi>Councils,</hi> with which His Majeſty's
Affairs have been bleſs'd, ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive
and overwhelm us all: United
as we were, <hi>none can ſay</hi> we were
not in Danger, and next to God's
directing Providence, nothing but the
Vigilance and ſteddy Conduct of the
King and his Miniſtry, united toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Heart and Hand, to ſurprize and
circumvent the Enemy, render'd their
too well laid Deſigns abortive.</p>
            <p>If that Unity is broken, if the
Eyes that ſhould watch for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0729700300:45"/>
Safety, are employed in an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
Glancing at one another, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their private Advantages, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant
and diſplace, eſtabliſh and bring
in, as their own ambitious Views
direct; what will become of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Intereſt? Who will look out for
that? And how will the Ship of State
run on Ground and ſplit upon the
Rocks, while the Pilots forget to
<hi>Steer,</hi> and are falling out among
themſelves?</p>
            <p>The firſt Step which Party Men
generally take to ſupport themſelves,
when they lay Deſigns one againſt
another, is, to ſtrengthen themſelves
with <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Dependents,</hi> who
ſhall be ready at all Times to ſerve
and ſupport them, eſpecially where
<hi>any thing</hi> that may injure them is
to be paſſed by Votes. To do this,
they make uſe of their <hi>Intereſt</hi> with
the <hi>Sovereign,</hi> to recommend and
bring ſuch <hi>Perſons</hi> into pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<hi>Employment,</hi> as well to keep
others out, as to fortifie their <hi>own
Intereſt</hi>; for Numbers has always
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0729700300:46"/>
been eſteemed a great Thing at
Court.</p>
            <p>To do this, we always find they
make no ſcruple to court mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
in their turn, I ſay, to court
the Party that are out, who they
bring into play, upon Pretence of
their being turn'd, or of having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to be directed.</p>
            <p>This was what the Courtiers did
in King <hi>William</hi>'s Time, when the
Lord <hi>Haverſhame</hi> deſcribed it by
that unhappy, but ſignificant Word,
a <hi>Motley Miniſtry</hi>; and how far
that Motley Miniſtry went towards
ruining that Prince's Affairs, is too
recent in Memory to be forgot.
How far the like Folly would go
to ruine our preſent Affairs, we ought
to tremble to think of.</p>
            <p>When the Parties thus bring in
their Enemies, Two Things fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
follow, and indeed, ſeldom
fail.<list>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:0729700300:47"/>
                  <item>1. That they cannot, when they
find their miſtake, get them out
again.</item>
                  <item>2. That they often maſter and
throw out thoſe that brought
them in.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>We need not look far back for
Examples of this Kind, the People
now at Court know too much of
this. Truth, to have any occaſion to
be put in Mind of it. The Court
Revolution of 1709, is an eminent
Inſtance of it, and to that they are
referred.</p>
            <p>The Sum of the Matter is, that
it cannot, without moſt uncommon,
and moſt injurious Reflections upon
the preſent Adminiſtration be ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted,
that there are any Miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings,
Dividings, or Factions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them; their Honeſty will not
permit it, their Senſes muſt be their
Protection againſt it, they cannot
do it without being Fools to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
Traytors to King <hi>George,</hi> and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0729700300:48"/>
Knaves to their Country, and for
this Reaſon I conclude that it is all
falſe, a meer Rumour, raiſed by their
Enemies to amuſe the World, ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalize
the Government, and bouy up
their own ſinking Party.</p>
