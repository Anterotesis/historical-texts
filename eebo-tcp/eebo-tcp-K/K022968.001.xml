         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HOWEVER ſparing modern Authors
are in giving due praiſe to their Cotempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
they ſeem to be more united in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
the merit of thoſe who, to uſe the
language of the Pſalmiſt, <q rend="inline">"have ceaſed from
their labours."</q> Writers, whoſe works have
ſtood the teſt of years, have acquired a kind
of preſcriptive title to celebrity, not on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of that ſuperior wiſdom which is often
attributed to times we have ſurvived, or the
ſuppoſed degeneracy of the preſent, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
what has been long known has been
more reflected upon, and what undergoes this
examination is better underſtood.</p>
            <p>In the catalogue of Authors, whoſe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
have met with public reception, none
have been more juſtly celebrated than thoſe
of POPE, and <hi>his Cotemporaries</hi>; inſomuch,
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0699400101:4"/>
that their names have not only been honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
recorded, but the period in which they
lived has been pre-eminently diſtinguiſhed by
the title of the <hi>Auguſtan Age.</hi> Other points
of time have here and there given birth to
a great genius, who, like a leading ſtar, has
enlightened the horizon of literature, but no
particular aera, at leaſt of our hiſtory, has
produced ſo general, and collected a light as
this; a light which, at once, ſhone upon every
part of ſcience, at the ſame time that it il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated
the circle of morality.</p>
            <p>What could have been the cauſe why ſuch
a cluſter of great men flouriſhed at the ſame
period of time, and why we have had no ſimilar
ſucceſſion ever ſince? Whether the firſt aroſe
from the emulation of authorſhip, which, like
the colliſion of hard bodies, ſtruck a fire from
each other, or that the latter was occaſioned
by the number of finiſhed pieces they gave
to the world, which has ever ſince occaſioned
a kind of literary ſatiety, is a queſtion, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
not ſo readily decided. This however
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0699400101:5"/>
is as generally known, as aſſented to, that
from the very few eminent geniuſes who
have ariſen ſince the flouriſhing days of this
illuſtrious Junto, nature ſeems to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged
herſelf in a temporary repoſe.</p>
            <p>When Authors, therefore, have thus long
engaged the public attention, when their
works are read with avidity, and univerſally
receive a claſſical ſtamp, thoſe who can add
any thing to their illuſtration, and recover
by time what has eluded former diligence,
bring an acceptable preſent to the public.
It is with good Authors as with good men;
the nearer, and more intimately they are
viewed, the more we are able to ſet a proper
value upon their characters, and look up to
them as more enforcing examples of imitation
and inſtruction.</p>
            <p>Under this idea, the Editor thinks he need
make no apology in preſenting the public
with two additional volumes to the Works of
Mr. POPE, which contain ſuch of that celebrated
Bard's pieces, in proſe and verſe, together with
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0699400101:6"/>
many of his Cotemporaries, as for particular
and local reaſons were then ſuppreſſed, might
have been miſlaid, or perhaps got into too
remote hands to be collected with eaſe. He
is aware, at the ſame time, that the public
rage for the remains of celebrated men, has
occaſioned many ſpurious productions being
fathered on them, under the well-known titles
of <hi>ſecond parts,</hi> and <hi>poſthumous works.</hi> Our
beſt Authors, and principally our beſt, have
been ſubject to ſuch impoſitions, which, tho'
they have been in time detected, have yet
anſwered the illiberal purpoſes of ſuch a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
publication. The Editor of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Work, to get clear of the ſhadow of
an imputation in this line, is the firſt to
remind the public, that ſeveral of the pieces
here exhibited originally appeared in <hi>The St.
James's Chronicle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The favourable reception they met with
in that fugitive mode of publication, firſt
ſuggeſted to him a wiſh to give them a more
durable form; he accordingly communicated
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0699400101:7"/>
this wiſh to his friends, who aſſiſted him in
his deſign, ſo much beyond his expectation,
that inſtead of <hi>one</hi> volume (his original in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention)
he has, by their favour, been able
to make out <hi>two</hi>; compoſed of ſuch materials,
as he flatters himſelf will acquit him of the
charge of an haſty, or ſelf-intereſted compiler.</p>
            <p>Many of the <hi>Letters</hi> and <hi>Poems,</hi> of which
this publication conſiſts, were tranſcribed
with accuracy from the originals, in the
collections of the late Lords Oxford and
Bolingbroke, who are well known to have
lived in the ſtricteſt intimacy with Mr. POPE,
as well as his literary friends and aſſociates.
Some of the <hi>latter</hi> will be found no way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
to other productions of the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.
All of the fragments, more or leſs,
carry the marks of a maſter. Others of the
Letters are taken from pamphlets printed
ſome years ago, which, in the detached man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
they then appeared, will, it is to be hoped,
fully juſtify their preſent mode of publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
They, for the moſt part, treat of cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0699400101:8"/>
friendly, humorous, and literary ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and abſtracted from theſe, throw new
lights upon the character of Mr. POPE, as a
man.</p>
            <p>His Letters to his favourite Miſs Blount
lead to the ſupport of a charge often urged
againſt him — <hi>his want of original inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>;
for tho' the extent of his erudition, and
his elegant turn of thinking, gave him a
ſuperiority to all his Cotemporaries in poliſhing,
to a degree of <hi>originality,</hi> other people's ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents;
yet here, whether from the careleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
ariſing from intimate friendſhip, idleneſs,
or the ſuppoſition of his not being detected
by his fair correſpondent, he has committed
a plagiariſm on Voiture, which would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
a much leſs celebrated pen than his.</p>
            <p>His Letter to Jabez Hughes, Eſq. brother
to the author of the Siege of Damaſcus, with
that of his to Mr. Dennis, the critic, are
melancholy proofs that the greateſt genius
cannot always ſhield men from duplicity of
conduct in their literary characters, and bring
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0699400101:9"/>
another corroboration to the teſtimony of
Gay's aſſertion, that
<q>
                  <l>"Wits are game-cocks to each other."</l>
               </q>
But if theſe Letters ſhew the weakneſſes,
perhaps the inſeparable weakneſſes from hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
nature, others will ſhew ſome of its
faireſt, and brighteſt ſides; they will exhibit
the ſtrongeſt <hi>traits</hi> of his humanity and
friendſhip, his wit, his learning, and his
morals; they will confirm his more than
Roman affection to his parents, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
to his aged mother, whoſe life he
watched over with ſuch ſoothing ſolicitude
and exemplary reverence, as force us for a
while to turn from the luſtre of his talents to
admire the ſuperiority of his ſilial character.</p>
            <p>A few Poems and Letters will be found
in this collection, which appeared only in
ſome of the editions of his works, in none
of them quite perfect, which are particularly
diſtinguiſhed in the latter, by the additional
paragraphs being printed in Italics. This will
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0699400101:10"/>
juſtify their republication here, more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
as many of them are written in that
unreſerved, open manner, which his original
Editor might have a wiſh to conceal for many
reaſons, that now no longer remain; at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
the reſtoration of them can neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge
vanity, nor gratify ſpleen: they may be
read without any other reaſon than the deſire
of pleaſure, and are therefore only to be
praiſed as that object is obtained.</p>
            <p>To many, in an age like this, where
hypocriſy in morals is much practiſed, (as
is ſhewn by our dramatic, and other writers,)
perhaps a few of the Poems may appear
too looſe and deſcriptive, particularly "The
Farewel to London," the concluſion of the
"Addreſs to Miſs Blount on leaving Town,"
and ſome paſſages in "The Sober Advice
from Horace, &amp;c." by Mr. POPE; together
with the Poem called "Virtue in Danger," and
others by Lady Mary Wortley Montague: but
on a proper examination this charge of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decency
will be found to lie more in the
readers turn of thinking, than the defects of
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0699400101:11"/>
the writer. A poet who wants to give his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
due force, ſhould comply with the rules
of his profeſſion, by uſing <q rend="inline">"proper words in
proper places,"</q> and provided he keeps a
ſteady eye on the moral of his piece, the more
he colours from nature, the more he aſſiſts
his deſign, whilſt the <hi>hint</hi> and <hi>double entendrez,</hi>
thoſe mock draperies of delicacy, often create
a more indecent meaning than the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
will allow, and urge the young and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced
reader more to the exerciſe of his
paſſions than his reaſon.</p>
            <p>Swift's delicacy has been often arraigned
on the ſame principle; and his "Lady's
Dreſſing Room," and others of his Poems
of a ſimilar ſtamp, are ever ſure to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
as convincing proofs of this charge.
But where is the woman of real ſenſe and
cleanlineſs offended at it? Conſcious ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
no ſuch reprehenſion in her own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
ſhe ſees the general force of the ſatire
only directed to the ſlatterns of her ſex, and
is pleaſed with the hope of a conſequent
reformation. In ſhort, the Editor is entirely
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0699400101:12"/>
of opinion, that the ſame rule reſpecting
decency, which a modern artiſt has laid down
in painting, will equally hold good in poetry.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"It is not in ſhewing, or concealing the
naked, that modeſty or lewdneſs depend.
They ariſe entirely from the choice and
intentions of the artiſt himſelf. A great
mind can raiſe great, or pleaſing ideas,
though he ſhews all the parts of the body
in their natural way, whilſt the Cheapſide
prints of the <hi>Buck and Quaker Girl,</hi> the
charms of the <hi>Garter</hi> and <hi>High-wind,</hi> are
proofs that very lewd ideas might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
though little or nothing of the
naked be diſcovered; and there is no doubt,
but that the <hi>Venus De Medicis</hi> might be
converted into a very lewd figure <hi>by dreſſing
her out for that purpoſe</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Barry on the Arts.</note>."</q>
            </p>
            <p>The letters which paſſed between Mr.
POPE, and his bookſellers, which are to be
found in the ſecond of theſe volumes, may
appear to thoſe who are to be no otherwiſe
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0699400101:13"/>
pleaſed with human genius than ſeeing it
eternally on the ſtretch, rather too triſling;
and as the public voice is not a little raiſed
upon like occaſions, the Editor thinks it
may be neceſſary to ſay ſomething on this
ſubject.</p>
            <p>It is objected, that moſt of our great wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
no ſooner eſtabliſh a reputation for their
works, but there are never wanting intereſted
people, who preferring a private lucre either
to the fame of the author, or national honour,
buſy themſelves in gleaning up their moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſting
thoughts on the moſt unintereſting
ſubjects; ſuch as letters to tradeſmen, &amp;c.
and that kind of domeſtic correſpondence,
which, to uſe the language of a modern au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
<q rend="inline">"a wiſe man ſhould be aſhamed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Was a collection of this kind purpoſely
made for the filling up a volume without the
leaſt regard to amuſement, curioſity, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
it muſt ſoon defeat its own pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes;
for, however common readers may for
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:0699400101:14"/>
a while be pleaſed with the novelty, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
it muſt receive from men of ſenſe,
would ſoon diſtinguiſh it as the <hi>mortal part</hi> of
an author, and in this ſtate conſign it to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion.
But trifling as theſe Letters ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be, many of them referring to literary
buſineſs, help to ſettle dates, and explain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences,
which perhaps before were not quite
ſo intelligible, and like thoſe well digeſted
queſtions on a legal examination, which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
ſimple they may appear in reſpect to
their immediate enquiries are yet important, as
they ſtrengthen, or elucidate a fact in their
connections. Others will ſerve to ſhew the
degree of intimacy between the poet and book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller
of that time, the proceſs of publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and many other little anecdotes of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and places, too <hi>trifling</hi> to be otherwiſe
recorded, but by this mode of preſervation,
and yet too <hi>curious</hi> (at leaſt to literary enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers)
to fall down the ſtream of obſcurity.</p>
            <p>The Editor having now made thoſe apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies
which he thought neceſſary for offering
theſe volumes to the public, he will no longer
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:0699400101:15"/>
detain them from the exerciſe of their own
judgement. He cannot, however, conclude
without aſſuring them that his deſign in this
compilation was no more than to collect in one
view, ſuch pieces of our celebrated Engliſh
Bard, and his Cotemporaries, as may be loſt
to the world from a fugitive mode of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication,
and others which might be equally
loſt from their being only open to the inſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

no induſtry, or expence himſelf, and ſtands
much indebted to the reſearches and intereſt
of many of his friends, he hopes to have
the merit of a faithful and uſeful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piler,
and that theſe volumes may not be
thought improper appendages to the preſent

               <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
               <p>OF all kinds of poetry the Didaſcalic is the moſt
valuable, if aiming at the good of mankind be what
juſtly entitles any thing to that character. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptive
kind is like a fine landſkip, where you meet
with two or three principal figures; the reſt is all
rocks, rivulets, hanging woods and verdant lawns,
amuſing to the eye, ſhewing the taſte of the painter,
but carrying little inſtruction along with it. But
the Didaſcalic is like a curious piece of hiſtory paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
where every figure muſt be highly wrought,
every paſſion ſtrongly repreſented, all contributing in
their ſeveral degrees to expreſs the main deſign; in
ſhort, it muſt be a finiſhed piece.</p>
               <p>That this is a very difficult work may be collected
from the ſmall number of thoſe poets who have ever
attempted it. In the early ages of the Grecians, I
remember none who have wrote any thing in this way
but old Heſiod, Aratus, and Nicander; for Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,
the Periegetic, and <note n="*" place="bottom">Ageſilaus, Oppian's father, was a man of great learning and merit as well as wealth and power, in the city of Anazarbus in Cilicia, where he liv'd: Severus making a progreſs, came to that town, and Ageſilaus being not at the proceſſion to meet the Emperor at his entrance, probably on account of his age and infirmities, that prince, to puniſh him for ſo heinous a crime, baniſh'd the poor old man to Malta. Oppian, to amuſe his father under his misfortune, took to writing of poetry, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards dedicated his Halieutics to the Emperor's ſon. The Emperor was ſo pleas'd with the poem, that he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd him a piece of gold for each line, and offer'd him any other favour he would aſk. The firſt part of the ſtory is not at all wonderful, but I muſt confeſs the laſt part is a little ſurprizing.</note> Oppian, liv'd not 'till the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0699400101:79"/>
time of the Roman Emperors. Heſiod's works and
days is the only piece remaining that is allow'd to be
genuine without diſpute; but by Virgil's, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
Manilius's compliments to him, 'tis highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
he wrote others, and perhaps more valuable
ones, tho' Quintilian allows him the <hi>Palma in illo
medio genere dicendi</hi> only, and Le Fevre is much more
hard upon him when he makes him little better than
an almanack-maker, and his work a mean perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
Paterculus and Plutarch ſet him next to
Homer, as well in the value of his works, as in the
period of his age, ſays Mr. Kennet; but perhaps that
may be the other extreme. Aratus wrote a poem, in
two books, which he calls the Phaenomena, and
Dioſemeia, the one aſtronomical, giving an account
of the ſituation and the affection of the heavenly
bodies, the other aſtrological, ſhewing the particular
influences ariſing from their various diſpoſitions and
relations<note n="†" place="bottom">Kennet's lives of the Greek poets.</note>. Tully commends him for his verſifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0699400101:80"/>
and Quintilian ſays, he has fully anſwer'd his
argument, which put together, ſhould make up a
pretty good character. As to Nicander, Voſſius
places him amongſt his Greek hiſtorians, but allows
him to have been <hi>egregius grammaticus, poeta, &amp;

medicus.</hi> His ſurviving works are, however, only
poetry upon poiſons, and the methods of cure for
them. Of the two latter Greek poets, Dionyſius
and Oppian, the one wrote a ſurvey of the world,
and the other Cynegetics and Halieutics, in both which
'tis certain there are very fine parts, however judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
may differ about them.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the Romans, Lucretius and Manilius
may juſtly be ſaid to be the chief of the Didaſcalic
poets. They both wrote with all the fire of their
youth about 'em; for neither of them liv'd to be old.
I have always fancy'd Manilius imitated Lucretius in
his manner, the beginning of his books being pretty
much in the ſame way, beſides, that he loſes no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of launching out into deſcriptions, and is
florid to a fault. He has likewiſe ſome reflections<note n="*" place="bottom">The beginning of the fourth book.</note> on
the follies of men, ſo very much of a piece with what
you meet with in the 5th book of Lucretius, that one
would almoſt think them taken from thence. In
general it may be ſaid, they are both very noble poems,
tho' that of Manilius is far from being finiſh'd, as it
might have been, if the author had liv'd. What
errors are to be found in the philoſophy of the one,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0699400101:81"/>
and the aſtronomy of the other, are owing, perhaps,
as much to the age of the world at that time, as
their own, and their beauties may, in ſome meaſure,
atone for their faults.</p>
               <p>Virgil's Georgics are in the ſame kind, tho' the
ſubjects are of leſs dignity; and I don't know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I might not likewiſe add Ovid, on the account
of his Faſti, the moſt correct of all his works:
Gratius too, about the ſame time, wrote his Cynege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics,
which are very juſtly eſteem'd.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the moderns, Fracaſtorius's <hi>Syphilis,</hi> Quil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let's
<hi>Callipaedia,</hi> and Vida's Art of Poetry, are the
beſt poems of this ſort; Rapin of gardens, and
Vanier's <hi>Praedium Ruſticum,</hi> are not without their
merit, but much inferior to the others. In our own
language too we have ſome poems of this inſtructive
kind: The Eſſays on Poetry, Tranſlated Verſe, and
Criticiſm, are fine inſtances of the worth and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of this manner of writing, to which may be
very truly apply'd what Dr. Young ſays of Satyr,<q>
                     <l>" Heroes and gods make other poems fine,</l>
                     <l>" Plain ſatyr calls for ſenſe in every line<note n="*" place="bottom">Univerſal Paſſion, Sat. II.</note>."</l>
                  </q> The ſtrength of juſt obſervations, convey'd in ſmooth
and flowing numbers, has a prevailing influence,
inſinuates itſelf into the mind almoſt imperceptibly,
and makes a more laſting impreſſion there than one
would eaſily imagine. 'Tis true theſe ſubjects are
purely critical, and ſo of leſs conſequence to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0699400101:82"/>
in general; but yet, poliſhing the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
improving the judgment, and regulating the
taſte, are far from being things indifferent to the
world, ſince they tend not a little to the ſhaming
out of it that ruſticity and barbariſm, thoſe follies
and affectations, in one word, all that littleneſs of
mind which is ſo effectual a bar in the way of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
and noble undertakings. But we have had of
late an undeniable proof that the fineſt and moſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ſort of philoſophy, which conſiſts in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of ourſelves, may be convey'd in ſuch clear,
ſtrong, eaſy, and affecting ſtrains, at the ſame time
convincing and captivating the underſtanding, that
there remains no doubt but that poetry in the hands
of a great genius, may be made as beneficial as ever
it has been entertaining to mankind. The latter
effect is indeed what has been generally moſt aim'd at,
as it is compaſs'd with leſs difficulty to the writer, and
meets with a more univerſal reception amongſt the
common ſort of readers.<note n="*" place="bottom">

to be totally baniſh'd out of poetical writings. 'Tis
true, the Epic Poem, the Ode, and the Tragedy very
often require, and conſequently juſtify the uſe of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
language, as it may be more ſuitable to the
greatneſs of the ſubjects, and better fitted to raiſe the
ſeveral paſſions they are deſign'd to work upon. But
where the appeal lies only to the underſtanding, ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evident
truths, naturally and beautifully expreſs'd, can
never fail of the approbation of a ſound head and a
good taſte: And even Horace himſelf, as elevated
and great a poet as he muſt be allow'd in his <hi>Odes,</hi>
appears to much more advantage in his <hi>Sermones</hi> and
<hi>Epiſtles,</hi> where, as my Lord Roſcommon obſerves on
another occaſion,<q>

               <p>Sir John Denham's Cooper's Hill has met with
univerſal applauſe, tho' its ſubject ſeems rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptive
than inſtructing; but 'tis not the hill, the
river, nor the ſtag chace; 'tis the good ſenſe and the
fine reflections ſo frequently interſpers'd, and as it were
interwoven with the reſt, that gives it the value, and
will make it, as was ſaid of true wit, everlaſting like
the ſun.</p>
               <p>The late Mr. Prior's Solomon ſeems to have coſt
him much time and pains, and was, I believe, his
favourite performance: He is in ſome doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to call it a Didaſcalic or Heroic poem. It has,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0699400101:84"/>
indeed, ſomething of both, and yet ſtrictly ſpeaking,
is perfectly neither: It has not fable, machinery,
nor variety enough to be an Heroic poem, and it is
too diffuſive and luxuriant in the ſtyle, too florid
and full of deſcriptions to be of the Didaſcalic ſort.
In general, it may be juſtly ſaid to be a very fine
piece; though I muſt confeſs I cannot help giving the
preference to his Alma, in which the deſign is more
cloſely purſued, carried on with more ſpirit, and
never loſes your attention.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole, what Mr. Dryden has ſaid in the
preface to his <hi>Religio Laici,</hi> is, I think, very true.
<q rend="inline">"The expreſſions of a poem, deſign'd purely for
inſtruction, ought to be plain and natural, and
yet majeſtic: for here the poet is preſum'd to
be a kind of lawgiver, and thoſe three qualities
which I have named, are proper to the legiſlative
ſtyle. The florid, elevated and figurative way,
is for the paſſions; for love and hatred, fear and
anger are begotten in the ſoul by ſhewing their
objects out of their true proportion; either greater
than the life or leſs; but inſtruction is to be given
by ſhewing them what they naturally are. A man
is to be cheated into paſſion, but to be reaſoned
into truth."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The following ſhort piece may be perhaps a little
too pompouſly introduced by the foregoing obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations;
all I ſhall ſay for it is, I endeavoured to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0699400101:85"/>
follow Mr. Dryden's rules: how far I have ſucceeded,
I can be no proper judge myſelf. But whatever may
be ſaid of the poetry, and about that I am very indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,
the ſentiments muſt ſurely be allowed to be
juſt and good; and I am entirely of Mr. Prior's opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:
<q rend="inline">"I had rather be thought a good Engliſhman,
(which is but another word for an honeſt man)
than the beſt poet, or greateſt ſcholar that ever
wrote."</q>

               <l>Say, Cobham, what amuſes thy retreat,</l>

               <l>To ſee the audacious foe ſo late ſubdu'd,</l>
               <l>Diſpute the terms for which ſo long they ſu'd,</l>

               <l>No mortal pen can figure her ſurprize,</l>

               <l>Fruitleſs her pray'rs, and impotent her rage,</l>
               <l>Yet ſierce as when two female ſcolds engage.</l>

               <l>A calm ſucceeded this tempeſtuous ſcene.</l>
               <l>And thus ſhe ſpoke:</l>
               <l>Ye blooming maids! let my example prove</l>
               <l>How oft your ſex miſtaken are in love!</l>
               <l>When young, we're cruel, and with beauty play,</l>
               <l>Which while we vainly parley, fades away.</l>
               <l>When old, to encreaſe the rigour of our fate,</l>
               <l>We wiſh and talk of lovers when too late.</l>
               <l>As idle travellers who've loſt the day,</l>
               <l>And hope in night through ſhades to find the way;</l>
               <l>Forlorn they tread the thorny paths in vain,</l>
               <l>Not of themſelves, but their hard fate complain.</l>
               <l>So peeviſh maids when paſt their youthful bloom,</l>
               <l>On ſad remains, and fancy'd charms preſume;</l>
               <l>Lonely they wander, no companion find,</l>
               <l>Then rail, and quarrel with all human kind.</l>
               <l>But let us to ourſelves for once be juſt,</l>
               <l>And ſee our own decays and wrinkles firſt.</l>
               <l>Whene'er to melting ſighs we lend an ear,</l>
               <l>Think, youth and beauty make the men ſincere.</l>
               <l>No other powers their ſtubborn hearts can move:—</l>
               <l>Did ever virtue light the torch of love?</l>
               <l>From ſad experience I this truth declare;</l>
               <l>I am now abandon'd, though I once was fair.</l>

            <head>Mr. JOHN PHILIPS's deſigned Dedication to his Poem called THE SPLENDID
SHILLING.</head>
            <head>To W. BROME, Eſq. of <hi>Ewithington,</hi> in the County of
<hi>Hereford.</hi>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT would be too tedious an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
at this time to examine the riſe and progreſs
of Dedications. The uſe of them is certainly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
as appears both from Greek and Latin authors;
and we have reaſon to believe that it was continued
without any interruption till the beginning of this
century, at which time, mottos, anagrams, and
frontiſpieces being introduced, Dedications were
mightily diſcouraged, and at laſt abdicated. But to
diſcover preciſely when they were reſtored, and by
whom they were firſt uſher'd in, is a work that far
tranſcends my knowledge; a work that can juſtly
be expected from no other pen but that of your
operoſe Doctor Bentley. Let us therefore at preſent
acquieſce in the dubiouſneſs of their antiquity, and
think the authority of the paſt and preſent times a
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0699400101:208"/>
ſufficient plea for your patronizing, and my dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
this poem. Eſpecially ſince in this age Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
are not only faſhionable, but almoſt neceſſary;
and indeed they are now ſo much in vogue, that a
book without one, is as ſeldom ſeen as a bawdy-houſe
without a Practice of Piety, or a poet with money.
Upon this account, Sir, thoſe who have no friends,
dedicate to all good chriſtians; ſome to their book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers;
ſome for want of a ſublunary patron to the
manes of a departed one. There are, that have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
to their whores: God help thoſe hen-peck'd
writers that have been forced to dedicate to their own
wives! but while I talk ſo much of other mens
patrons, I have forgot my own; and ſeem rather to
make an eſſay on Dedications, than to write one.
However, Sir, I preſume you will pardon me for
that fault; and perhaps like me the better for ſaying
nothing to the purpoſe. You, Sir, are a perſon
more tender of other mens reputation than your own;
and would hear every body commended but yourſelf.
Should I but mention your ſkill in turning, and the
compaſſion you ſhew'd to my fingers ends when you
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0699400101:209"/>
gave me a tobacco ſtopper, you would bluſh and be
confounded with your juſt praiſes. How much more
would you, ſhould I tell you what a progreſs you
have made in that abſtruſe and uſeful language, the
Saxon? Since, therefore, the recital of your excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies
would prove ſo troubleſome, I ſhall offend
your modeſty no longer. Give me leave to ſpeak a
word or two concerning the poem, and I have done.
This poem, Sir, if we conſider the moral, the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the ſubject, the variety of images, and the
exactneſs of the ſimilitudes that compoſe it, muſt
be allowed a piece that was never equalled by the
moderns or ancients. The ſubject of the poem is
myſelf, a ſubject never yet handled by any poets.
How it to be handled by all, we may learn by thoſe
few divine commendatory verſes written by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
Monſieur le Bog. Yet ſince I am the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and the poet too, I ſhall ſay no more of it,
leſt I ſhould ſeem vain-glorious. As for the moral,
I have took particular care that it ſhould lie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognito,
not like the ancients who let you know at
firſt ſight they deſign ſomething by their verſes. But
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0699400101:210"/>
here you may look a good while, and perhaps, after
all, find that the poet has no aim or deſign, which
muſt needs be a diverting ſurprize to the reader.
What ſhall I ſay of the ſimiles that are ſo full of
geography, that you muſt get a Welſhman to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
them? that ſo raiſe our ideas of the things
they are apply'd to? that are ſo extraordinarily quaint
and well choſen that there's nothing like them? So
that I think I may, without vanity, ſay <hi>Avia Pieri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
peragro loca, &amp;c.</hi> Yet however excellent this
poem is, in the reading of it you will find a vaſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between ſome parts and others; which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
not from your humble ſervant's negligence, but
diet. This poem was begun when he had little
victuals, and no moneys, and was finiſhed when he
had the misfortune at a virtuous lady's houſe to meet
with both. But I hope, in time, Sir, when hunger
and poverty ſhall once more be my companions, to
make amends for the defaults of this poem, by an
eſſay on Minced Pies, which ſhall be devoted to you
with all ſubmiſſion, by,</p>

            <p>I Am entering into propoſals with a
bookſeller for printing a little miſcellany of my own
performances, conſiſting of ſome originals and ſelect
Tranſlations. I beg you to be altogether ſilent in
the matter. Mr. Pope has uſed ſo little of the 23d
Odyſſey that I gave Dr. Younge, that if I put it in
among the reſt I ſhall hardly incur any danger of
the penalty concerning the patent. However, I will
not preſume to publiſh a ſingle line of it after Mr.
Pope's Tranſlation, if you adviſe me (as I deſire you
to do ſincerely) to the contrary. I ſhall ſend you a
ſmall ſpecimen of my Tranſlation, which if you
approve of, I can aſſure you the remainder of the
book is not inferior to it.</p>

            <p>PRAY inform my Lord Harley that
I have on Thurſday laſt ſeen the daughter of Milton
the poet. I carry'd with me two or three different
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0699400101:215"/>
prints of Milton's picture, which ſhe immediately
knew to be like her father; and told me her mother-in-law
(if living in Cheſhire) had two pictures of
him, one when he was a ſchool boy, and the other
when he was about twenty. She knows of no other
picture of him, becauſe ſhe was ſeveral years in
Ireland, both before and after his death. She was
the youngeſt of Milton's daughters by his firſt wife,
and was taught to read to her father ſeveral languages.</p>
            <p>Mr. Addiſon was deſirous to ſee her once, and
deſired ſhe would bring with her teſtimonials of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Milton's daughter, but as ſoon as ſhe came into
the room he told her ſhe needed none, her face
having much of the likeneſs of the pictures he had
ſeen of him.</p>
            <p>For my part, I find the features of her face very
much like the prints. I ſhowed her the painting I
have to engrave, which ſhe believes not to be her
father's picture, it being of a brown complexion,
and black hair, and curled locks. On the contrary,
he was of a fair complexion, a little red in his
cheeks, and light brown lank hair.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:0699400101:216"/>
I deſire you would acquaint Mr. Prior I was ſo
unfortunate to wait on him on Thurſday morning
laſt, juſt after he was gone out of town. It was
with the intent to enquire of him if he remembers
a picture of Milton in the late Lord Dorſet's col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,
as I am told this was; or if he can inform
me how I ſhall enquire or know the truth of this
affair, I ſhould be much obliged to him, being very
willing to have all the certainty on that account
before I begin to engrave the plate, that it may be
the more ſatisfactory to the publick, as well as to
myſelf.</p>

               <p>WE are indebted to Heaven for all
things, and above all for our ſenſe and genius (in
whatever degree we have it); but to fancy yourſelf
indebted to any thing elſe, moves my anger at your
modeſty. The regard I muſt bear you, ſeriouſly
proceeds from myſelf alone; and I will not ſuffer
even one I like ſo much as Mrs. H. to have a ſhare
in cauſing it. I challenge a kind of relation to you
on the <hi>ſoul's</hi> ſide, which I take to be better than
either on a father's or mother's; and if you can
overlook an ugly <hi>body</hi> (that ſtands much in the way
of any friendſhip, when it is between different ſexes)
I ſhall hope to find you a true and conſtant kinſwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in Apollo. Not that I would place all my
pretenſions upon that poetical foot, much leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
them to it; I am far more deſirous to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0699400101:221"/>
as yours, on the more meritorious title of
friendſhip. I have ever believed this as a ſacred
maxim, that the moſt ingenious natures were the
moſt ſincere; and the moſt knowing and ſenſible
minds made the beſt friends. Of all thoſe that I
have thought it the felicity of my life to know, I
have ever found the moſt diſtinguiſhed in capacity,
the moſt diſtinguiſhed in morality: and thoſe the
moſt to be depended on, whom one eſteemed ſo
much as to deſire they ſhould be ſo. I beg you to
make me no more compliments. I could make you
a great many, but I know you neither need them,
nor can like them: be ſo good as to think I do not.
In one word, your writings are very good, and very
entertaining; but not ſo good, nor ſo entertaining,
as your life and converſation. One is but the effect
and emanation of the other. It will always be a
greater pleaſure to me, to know you are well, than
that you write well, though every time you tell me
the one, I muſt know the other. I am willing to
ſpare your modeſty; and therefore, as to your wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
may perhaps never ſay more (directly to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf)
than the few verſes I ſend here; which (as a

               <p>THOUGH I am extremely obliged
by your agreeable letter, I will avoid all mention of
the pleaſure you give me, that we may have no more
words about compliments; which I have often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved

rather wiſh you may love the town (which the

If theſe lines want poetry, they do not want ſenſe.
God Almighty long preſerve you from a feeling of
them! The book you mention, Bruyere's Characters,
will make any one know the world; and I believe
at the ſame time deſpiſe it (which is a ſign it will
make one know it thoroughly). It is certainly the
proof of a maſter-hand, that can give ſuch ſtriking
likeneſſes, in ſuch ſlight ſketches, and in ſo ſew
ſtrokes on each ſubject. In anſwer to your queſtion
about Shakeſpear, the book is about a quarter printed,
and the number of emendations very great. I have
never indulged my own conjectures, but kept meerly
to ſuch amendments as are authorized by old editions,
in the author's life-time: but I think it will be a
year at leaſt before the whole work can be finiſhed.
In reply to your very handſome (I wiſh it were a very

firſt writings had ſuch an effect, upon a man uſed to

unworthy your memory or notice, becauſe he

You have ſpoiled him for a ſolitaire, and a book,
all the days of his life; and put him into ſuch a
condition, that he thinks of nothing, and enquires
of nothing but after a perſon who has nothing to ſay
to him, and has left him for ever without hope of
ever again regarding, or pleaſing, or entertaining
him, much leſs of ſeeing him. He has been ſo mad
with the idea of her, as to ſteal her picture, and
paſſes whole days in ſitting before it, talking to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and (as ſome people imagine) making verſes;

it is ſo much better entertained.</p>

loſs of a friend. It is like the ſhower we have had
this morning, that juſt makes the drooping trees
hold up their heads, but they remain checked and
withered at the root: the benediction is but a ſhort
relief, though it comes from Heaven itſelf. The
loſs of a friend is the loſs of life; after that is gone
from us, it is all but a gentler decay, and waſting
and lingering a little longer. I was the other day

               <p>YOUR laſt letter tells me, that if
I do not write in leſs than a month, you will fancy
the length of yours frighted me. A conſciouſneſs
that I had upon me of omitting too long to anſwer
it, made me look (not without ſome fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling)
for the date of it: but there happened to be
none; and I hope, either that you have forgot how
long it is, or at leaſt that you cannot think it ſo
long as I do, ſince I writ to you. Indeed a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of things (which ſingly ſeem trifles, and yet
all together make a vaſt deal of buſineſs, and wholly
take up that time which we ought to value above all
ſuch things) have from day to day made me wanting,
as well to my own greateſt pleaſure in this, as to my
own greateſt concerns in other points. If I ſeem to
neglect any friend I have, I do more than ſeem to
neglect myſelf, as I find daily by the increaſing ill
conſtitution of my body and mind. I ſtill reſolve
this courſe ſhall not, nay I ſee it cannot, be long;
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0699400101:234"/>
and I determine to retreat within myſelf to the only
buſineſs I was born for, and which I am only good
for (if I am entitled to uſe that phraſe for any thing).
It is great folly to ſacrifice one's ſelf, one's time,
one's quiet (the very life of life itſelf), to forms,
complaiſances, and amuſements, which do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
pleaſe me, and only pleaſe a ſort of people
who regard me no farther than a meer inſtrument of
their preſent idleneſs, or vanity. To ſay truth, the
lives of thoſe we call great and happy are divided
between thoſe two ſtates; and in each of them, we
poetical fiddlers make but part of their pleaſure, or
of their equipage. And the miſery is, we, in our
turns, are ſo vain (at leaſt I have been ſo) as to
chuſe to pipe without being paid, and ſo ſilly to be
pleaſed with piping to thoſe who underſtand muſick
leſs than ourſelves. They have put me of late upon
a taſk before I was aware, which I am <hi>ſick</hi> and <hi>ſore</hi>
of: and yet engaged in honour to ſome perſons
whom I muſt neither diſobey nor diſappoint (I mean
two or three in the world only) to go on with it.
They make me do as mean a thing as the greateſt
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0699400101:235"/>
man of them could do; ſeem to depend, and to
ſolicit, when I do not want; and make a kind of
court to thoſe above my rank, juſt as they do to
thoſe above theirs, when we might much more wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and agreeably live of ourſelves, and to ourſelves.
You will eaſily find I am talking of my tranſlating
the Odyſſey by ſubſcription: which looks, it muſt
needs look, to all the world as a deſign of mine both
upon fame and money, when in truth I believe I
ſhall get neither; for one I go about without any
ſtomach, and the other I ſhall not go about at all.</p>
               <p>This freedom of opening my mind upon my own
ſituation, will be a proof of truſt, and of an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
your goodneſs of nature has made me entertain,
that you never profeſs any degree of good-will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being pretty warm in it. So I tell you my griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances;
I hope in God you have none, wherewith to
make me any return of this kind. I hope that was
the only one which you communicated in your laſt,
about Mrs. H<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>_…</desc>
                  </gap> ſilence; for which ſhe wanted
not reproaches from me; and has ſince, ſhe ſays,
amply atoned for. I ſaw a few lines of yours to her,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0699400101:236"/>
which are more obliging to me than I could have
imagined: if you put <hi>my welfare</hi> into the ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of things which you heartily wiſh (for a ſenſible
perſon, of either ſex, will never wiſh for many), I
ought to be a happier man than I ever yet deſerved
to be.</p>
               <p>Upon a review of your papers, I have repented of
ſome of the trivial alterations I had thought of,
which were very few. I would rather keep them till
I have the ſatisfaction to meet you in the winter,
which I muſt beg earneſtly to do; for hitherto me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
you are to me like a ſpirit of another world,
a being I admire, but have no commerce with: I
cannot tell but I am writing to a Fairy, who has left
me ſome favours, which I ſecretly enjoy, and ſhall
think it unlucky, if not fatal, to part with. So
pray do not expect your verſes till farther ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance.</p>

and to have told it her in diſtant or baſhful terms,
would have appeared ſo like coldneſs in my ſenſe of
good qualities (which I cannot find out in any one,

a great warmth for them) that I was quite at a loſs
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0699400101:238"/>
what to write, or in what ſtile, to you. But I am
reſolved, plainly to get over all objections, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

to be paſt all preliminaries, and forms, I am ready
to treat with you for your friendſhip. I know

wit, ſenſe, and worth enough, to make me reckon

               <p>I do not know, on the other hand, what you can

you ſhall find me a much better man, that is, a
much better friend, or at leaſt a much leſs faulty

               <p>IT happened that when I determined
to anſwer yours, by the poſt that followed my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt

have had the happineſs to give you of my warmth

ſincere condolements with you on that melancholy
ſubject. But nevertheleſs I reſolved to ſend you the
one, though unattended by the other: I begged Mrs.

                  </gap> to incloſe it, that you might at leaſt ſee I
had not the power to delay a moment the doing what
you bid me; eſpecially when the occaſion of obeying
your commands was ſuch, as muſt affect every ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer
and well-wiſher of honour and virtue in the
nation.</p>
               <p>You had it in the very blots, the better to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare

I do not wonder that you decline the poetical
amuſement I propoſed to you, at this time. I know
(from what little I know of your heart) enough at
leaſt to convince me, it muſt be too deeply concerned
at the loſs, not only of ſo great, and ſo near a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but of a good man (a loſs this age can hardly
ever afford to bear, and not often can ſuſtain). Yet
perhaps it is one of the beſt things that can be ſaid
of poetry, that it helps us to paſs over the toils
and troubles of this tireſome journey, our life; as
horſes are encouraged and ſpirited up, the better to
bear their labour, by the jingling of bells about
their heads. Indeed, as to myſelf, I have been uſed
to this odd cordial, ſo long, that it has no effect
upon me: but you, Madam, are in your honey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moon
of poetry; you have ſeen only the ſmiles, and
enjoyed the careſſes, of Apollo. Nothing is ſo
pleaſant to a Muſe as the firſt children of the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination;
but when once ſhe comes to find it meer
conjugal duty, and the care of her numerous progeny
daily grows upon her, it is all a ſour tax for paſt
pleaſure. As the Pſalmiſt ſays on another occaſion,
the age of a Muſe is ſcarce above five and twenty:
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0699400101:242"/>
all the reſt is labour and ſorrow. I find by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

               <p>IT would be a vanity in me to tell you
why I trouble you ſo ſoon again: I cannot imagine
myſelf of the number of thoſe correſpondents whom
you call favourite ones; yet I know it is thought,
that induſtry may make a man what merit cannot:
and if an old maxim of my Lord Oxford's be true,
That in England if a man reſolve to be any thing,
and conſtantly ſtick to it, he may (even a Lord
Treaſurer): if ſo, I ſay, it ſhall not be want of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
that ſhall hinder me from being a favourite.
In good earneſt, I am more ambitious of being ſo
to you, Madam, than I ever was, or ever ſhall be,
of being one to any Prince, or (which is more) any
Prince's miniſter, in Chriſtendom.</p>
               <p>I wiſh I could tell you any agreeable news of what
your heart is concerned in; but I have a ſort of
quarrel to Mrs. H<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>_…</desc>
                  </gap> for not loving herſelf ſo well
as ſhe does her friends: for thoſe ſhe makes happy,
but not herſelf.</p>

There is an air of ſadneſs about her which grieves
me, and which, I have learnt by experience, will
increaſe upon an indolent (I will not ſay an affected)
reſignation to it. It will do ſo in men, and much
more in women, who have a natural ſoftneſs that
ſinks them even when reaſon does not. This I tell
you in confidence; and pray give our friend ſuch
hints as may put her out of humour with melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly:
your cenſure, or even your raillery, may
have more weight with her than mine: a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
either ſo decently, or ſo delicately, take upon
him to be a phyſician in theſe concealed diſtempers.</p>
               <p>You ſee, Madam, I proceed in truſting you with
things that nearly concern me. In my laſt letter I
ſpoke but of a trifle, myſelf: in this I advance
farther, and ſpeak of what touches me more, a
friend.</p>
               <p>This beautiful ſeaſon will raiſe up ſo many rural
images and deſcriptions in a poetical mind, that I
expect, you, and all ſuch as you (if there be any
ſuch), at leaſt all who are not downright dull tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0699400101:252"/>

                        <l>Bold riſing hills, ſlant vales, and far-ſtretch'd plains,</l>

                  </note> BEDINGTON: I could wiſh you tried ſomething
in the deſcriptive way on any ſubject you pleaſe,
mixed with viſion and moral; like pieces of the old
provençal poets, which abound with fancy, and are
the moſt amuſing ſcenes in nature. There are three
or four of this kind in Chaucer admirable: "The
Flower and the Leaf" every body has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
with.</p>
               <p>I have long had an inclination to tell a Fairy tale,
the more wild and exotic the better; therefore a

                  <hi>viſion,</hi> which is confined to no rules of probability,
will take in all the variety and luxuriancy of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
you will; provided there be an apparent
moral to it. I think, one or two of the Perſian
Tales would give one hints for ſuch an invention:
and perhaps if the ſcenes were taken from real places
that are known, in order to compliment particular
gardens and buildings of a fine taſte (as I believe
ſeveral of Chaucer's deſcriptions do, though it is
what nobody has obſerved), it would add great
beauty to the whole.</p>
               <p>I wiſh you found ſuch an amuſement pleaſing to
you: if you did but, at leiſure, form deſcriptions
from objects in nature itſelf, which ſtruck you moſt
livelily, I would undertake to find a tale that ſhould
bring them all together: which you will think an
odd undertaking, but in a piece of this fanciful and
imaginary nature I am ſure is practicable. Excuſe

            <p>☞ IN the Preface to an edition of Monſieur POUILLY
DE CHAMPEAUX's Works very lately publiſhed, is the
Extract of a Letter from Lord BOLINGBROKE to that
Gentleman. The original and tranſlation are inſerted
here. The comment is left to the reader.</p>
            <p>It may be neceſſary to add, That Monſieur POUILLY
DE CHAMPEAUX is a writer much eſteemed on account
of the elegance and ſpirit of humanity that breathe
throughout his literary productions. The chief of theſe
is his Theory of Agreeable Senſations. As to his political
powers, they have never yet been celebrated by his country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in ſuch a ſtrain as to authorize the following compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to him on the part of Lord BOLINGBROKE.</p>

cette foule d'hommes que j'ai pu connoitre, et
dont j'ai cherché à étudier l'eſprit et le charactère,
je n'en ai vu que TROIS qui m'aient paru dignes
qu'on leur confiât le ſoin de gouverner des nations.
Nôtre amitié eſt trop etroite, elle eſt, ainſi que
le diroit Montaigne, trop libre et trop franche dans
