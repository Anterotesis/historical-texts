            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>GO on, dear ſiſter Dolly—And ſo my ſweet girl was brought to the Widow Gadly's, as a relation of her's from Shropſhire, and went by the name of Belton?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>DOL.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, yes—you had not been gone to London two days, before your father and ſhe met in the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow's garden; I was with him, he was very inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive indeed, and was ſtruck with her lively manner; I could hardly get him home to dinner.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>WM.</speaker>
               <p>Why this was beyond expectation; and ſo, Dolly—</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>DOL.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, his liking went much beyond my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
<pb facs="tcp:0569100900:6"/>
or your wiſhes: In a week he fell in love with her, and is at this time a very dangerous rival.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>WM.</speaker>

               <speaker>DOL.</speaker>
               <p>Her ſinging, and twenty little agreeable fooleries ſhe puts, on have bewitch'd him: Her mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miking the Gipſies has ſo inchanted him, that he has prevailed upon her to come to the May-pole to-day among the holiday lads and laſſes, and tell their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. She has dreſs'd up herſelf often and been among 'em, without their knowing who ſhe is—in ſhort, ſhe has bewitch'd the whole village—I am to be there too as her mother—My father will have it ſo.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>WM.</speaker>
               <p>So much the better, while you are telling fortunes, I may talk to her without being obſerv'd; ſend but a fortune-teller, or a mountebank, among country people, and they have no eyes, and ears, for any thing elſe: Where is my father now?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>DOL.</speaker>
               <p>Upon ſome knotty point with Roger Dozey, the clerk—I muſt go, and prepare for the frolick: don't be melancholy, Will; the worſt that can hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen is to marry the girl without your father's conſent, turn gipſy with your wife, and ſend your children to ſteal his poultry.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>WM.</speaker>
               <p>But harkee, Dolly, who is to have Mr. Goodwill's May-day legacy? A hundred pounds is a tolerable foundation to build upon—What is become of George, Dolly?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>DOL.</speaker>
               <p>I have not time to tell you—He is a rogue like the reſt of you: But as I have a heart that can make an honeſt man happy that poſſeſſes it, ſo it has a ſpirit within it to deſpiſe a knave, or a coxcomb.</p>
