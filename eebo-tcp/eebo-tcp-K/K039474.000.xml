            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To the firſt in command, Miſs YOUNGE, I have infinite obligations, which I ſhall always gratefully acknowledge, tho' I may never have it in my power to repay them; nor can the ſkill and conduct of my generals, REDDISH, SMITH and PALMER, be ſufficiently admired. To your patronage and protection I moſt heartily and ſincerely recommend them: If I have been the happy inſtrument of giving them a favourable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of riſing in <hi>your</hi> eſteem, it will give me the greateſt ſatisfaction. <hi>You</hi> can beſt diſtinguiſh their merit, and <hi>you</hi> alone are able to reward it.</p>

               <l>I Thank thee, gentle Bertha, for thy goodneſs;</l>

               <l>Already hath the interpoſing hand</l>
               <l>Of providence redeem'd thee from the rage</l>
               <l>Of ſavage war, and ſhelter'd thee within</l>

               <l>O my friend, oft times</l>
               <l>The flow'ry path that tempts our wand'ring ſteps</l>
               <l>But leads to mis'ry; what thou fondly deem'ſt</l>
               <l>My ſoul's beſt comfort, is its bitt'reſt woe.</l>
               <l>Earl Morcar loves me. To the gen'rous mind</l>
               <l>The heavieſt debt is that of gratitude,</l>
               <l>When 'tis not in our power to repay it.</l>

               <l>I told thee truth.</l>
               <l>Beneath my father's hoſpitable roof,</l>
               <l>I ſpent my earlier happier days in peace</l>
               <l>And ſafety: When the Norman conqu'ror came,</l>
               <l>Diſcord, thou know'ſt, ſoon lit her fatal torch,</l>
               <l>And ſpread deſtruction o'er this wretched land.</l>
               <l>The loyal Ranulph flew to William's aid,</l>
               <l>And left me to a faithful peaſant's care,</l>
               <l>Who liv'd, ſequeſter'd, in the fertile plains</l>
               <l>Of rich Northumbria: There awhile I dwelt</l>
               <l>In ſweet retirement, when the ſavage Malcolm</l>
               <l>Ruſh'd on our borders.</l>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>BERTHA.</speaker>
               <l>I remember well</l>
               <l>The melancholy hour. Confuſion rag'd</l>
               <l>On ev'ry ſide, and deſolation ſpread</l>
               <l>Its terrors round us. How did'ſt thou eſcape?</l>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
               <l>A crew of deſp'rate ruffians ſeiz'd upon me,</l>
               <l>A helpleſs prey: For, O! he was not there,</l>
               <l>Who beſt cou'd have defended his Matilda.</l>
               <l>

Then had I fall'n a wretched ſacrifice</l>
               <l>To rbutal rage, and lawleſs violence,</l>
               <l>Had not the gen'rous Morcar interpos'd</l>
               <l>To ſave me: Tho' he join'd the guilty cauſe</l>
               <l>Of foul rebellion, yet his ſoul abhor'd</l>
               <l>Such violation. At his awful voice</l>
               <l>The ſurly ruffians left me, and retir'd.</l>
               <l>He bore me, half expiring in his arms,</l>
               <l>Back to his tent; with ev'ry kind attention</l>
               <l>There ſtrove to ſooth my griefs, and promis'd, ſoon</l>

               <l>Something ſure</l>
               <l>Was due to gen'rous Morcar for his aid,</l>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MATILDA.</speaker>
               <l>No doubt: But mark what follow'd.</l>
               <l>In my deliverer too ſoon I found</l>
               <l>An ardent lover, ſighing at my feet.</l>

               <l>The pomp of wealth, or ſplendor of a court,</l>
               <l>Can make us happy. In the mind alone,</l>
