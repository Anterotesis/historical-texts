            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IF Tragick Poetry be, as Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> has ſome where ſaid, the moſt excellent and moſt uſeful Kind of Writing, the more extenſively uſeful the Moral of any Tragedy is, the more excellent that Piece muſt be of its Kind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0811500900:3"/>I hope I ſhall not be thought to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate that this, to which I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to prefix your Name, is ſuch; that depends on its Fitneſs to anſwer the End of Tragedy, the exciting of the Paſſions, in order to the correcting ſuch of them as are criminal, either in their Nature, or through their Exceſs. Whether the following Scenes do this in any tolerable Degree, is, with the Deference, that becomes one who wou'd not be thought vain, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to your candid and impartial Judgment.</p>
            <p>What I wou'd infer is this, I think, evident Truth; that Tragedy is ſo far from loſing its Dignity, by being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to the Circumſtances of the Generality of Mankind, that it is more truly auguſt in Proportion to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of its Influence, and the Numbers that are properly affected by it. As it is more truly great to be the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Good to many, who ſtand in need of our Aſſiſtance, than to a very ſmall Part of that Number.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="v" facs="tcp:0811500900:4"/>If Princes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were alone liable to Misfortunes, ariſing from Vice, or Weakneſs in themſelves, or others, there wou'd be good Reaſon for confining the Characters in Tragedy to thoſe of ſuperior Rank; but, ſince the contrary is evident, nothing can be more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable than to proportion the Remedy to the Diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>I am far from denying that Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, founded on any inſtructive and extraordinary Events in Hiſtory, or a well-invented Fable, where the Perſons introduced are of the higheſt Rank, are without their Uſe, even to the Bulk of the Audience. The ſtrong Contraſt between a <hi>Tamerlane</hi> and a <hi>Bajazet,</hi> may have its Weight with an unſteady People, and contribute to the fixing of them in the Intereſt of a Prince of the Character of the former, when, thro' their own Levity, or the Arts of deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men, they are render'd factious and uneaſy, tho' they have the higheſt Reaſon to be ſatisfied. The Sentiments and Example of a <hi>Cato,</hi> may inſpire his Spectators with a juſt Senſe of the Value
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0811500900:5"/>
of Liberty, when they ſee that honeſt Patriot prefer Death to an Obligation from a Tyrant, who wou'd ſacrifice the Conſtitution of his Country, and the Liberties of Mankind, to his Ambition or Revenge. I have attempted, indeed, to enlarge the Province of the graver Kind of Poetry, and ſhould be glad to ſee it carried on by ſome abler Hand. Plays, founded on moral Tales in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Life, may be of admirable Uſe, by carrying Conviction to the Mind, with ſuch irreſiſtable Force, as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage all the Faculties and Powers of the Soul in the Cauſe of Virtue, by ſtifling Vice in its firſt Principles. They who imagine this to be too much to be attributed to Tragedy, muſt be Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the Energy of that noble Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Poetry. <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> who has given ſuch amazing Proofs of his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, in that as well as in Comedy, in his <hi>Hamlet,</hi> has the following Lines.<q>

            <p>Conſidering the Novelty of this At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, I thought it would be expected from me to ſay ſomething in its Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe; and I was unwilling to loſe the Opportunity of ſaying ſomething of the Uſefulneſs of Tragedy in general, and what may be reaſonably expected from the farther Improvement of this excellent Kind of Poetry.</p>
            <p>Sir, I hope you will not think I have ſaid too much of an Art, a mean Specimen of which I am ambitious enough to recommend to your Favour and Protection. A Mind, conſcious of ſuperior Worth, as much deſpiſes Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, as it is above it. Had I found in my ſelf an Inclination to ſo contemptible a Vice, I ſhould not have choſe Sir JOHN EYLES for my Patron. And indeed the beſt writ Panegyrick, tho'
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0811500900:8"/>
ſtrictly true, muſt place you in a Light, much inferior to that in which you have long been fix'd, by the Love and Eſteem of your Fellow Citizens; whoſe Choice of you for one of their Repreſentatives in Parliament, has ſufficiently declared their Senſe of your Merit. Nor hath the Knowledge of your Worth been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the City. The Proprietors in the <hi>South-Sea</hi> Company, in which are included Numbers of Perſons; as conſiderable for their Rank, Fortune, and Underſtanding, as any in the Kingdom, gave the greateſt Proof of their Confidence, in your Capacity and Probity, when they choſe you Sub-Governor of their Company, at a Time when their Affairs were in the utmoſt Confuſion, and their Properties in the greateſt Danger. Nor is the Court inſenſible of your Importance. I ſhall not therefore attempt your Character, nor pretend to add any Thing to a Reputation ſo well eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed.</p>

                  <p>If I manage well, I ſhall have done with him much ſooner, having long had a Deſign on him; and meeting him Yeſterday, I made a full Stop, and gazing wiſhfully on his Face, ask'd him his Name: He bluſh'd, and bowing very low, anſwer'd, <hi>George Barnwell.</hi> I beg'd his Pardon for the Freedom I had taken, and told him, that he was the Perſon I had long wiſh'd to ſee, and to whom I had an Affair of Importance to communicate, at a proper Time and Place. He named a Tavern; I talk'd of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Reputation, and invited him to my Houſe: He ſwallow'd the Bait, promis'd to come, and this is the Time I expect him, <stage>[knocking at the Door.]</stage> Some Body knocks,—d'ye hear; I am at Home to no Body to Day, but him.—</p>

How painful is the Senſe of Guilt to an ingenuous Mind;—ſome youthful Folly, which it were pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent not to enquire into.—When we conſider the frail Condition of Humanity, it may raiſe our Pity, not our Wonder, that Youth ſhould go aſtray; when Reaſon, weak at the beſt when oppos'd to Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſcarce form'd, and wholly unaſſiſted by Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, faintly contends, or willingly becomes the Slave of Senſe. The State of Youth is much to be deplored; and the more ſo becauſe they ſee it not; they being then to danger moſt expos'd, when they are leaſt prepar'd for their Defence.</p>

                  <p>Loſt indeed! Yet how he ſhou'd be guilty of what he there charges himſelf withal, raiſes my Wonder equal to my Grief.—Never had Youth a higher Senſe of Virtue—Juſtly he thought, and as he thought he practiſed; never was Life more regular than his; an Underſtanding uncommon at his Years; an open, generous, manlineſs of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; his Manners eaſy, unaffected and engaging.</p>

                  <p>In attempting to ſave from Shame, one whom we hope may yet return to Virtue, to Heaven, and you, the Judges of this Action, I appeal, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I have done any thing misbecoming my Sex and Character.</p>

                  <p>I own it is ſurprizing:—I don't know which to admire moſt, her feign'd, or his real Paſſion; tho' I have ſometimes been afraid that her Avarice wou'd diſcover her:—But his Youth and want of Experience make it the eaſier to impoſe on him.</p>

                  <speaker>Lucy.</speaker>
                  <p>No, it is his Love. To do him Juſtice, notwithſtanding his Youth, he don't want Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; but you Men are much eaſier impoſed on, in theſe Affairs, than your Vanity will allow you to believe.—Let me ſee the wiſeſt of you all, as much in Love with me, as <hi>Barnwell</hi> is with <hi>Millwood,</hi> and I'll engage to make as great a Fool of him.</p>

                  <p>There was the Difficulty of it.—Had it been his own, it had been nothing.—Were the World his, ſhe might have it for a Smile:—But thoſe golden Days are done;—he's ruin'd, and <hi>Millwood</hi>'s Hopes of farther Profits there, are at an End.</p>

                  <p>Being call'd, by his Maſter, to make up his Accounts, he was forc'd to quit his Houſe and Service, and wiſely flies to <hi>Millwood</hi> for Relief and Entertainment.</p>

                  <p>He griev'd, and, at length, enrag'd at this barbarous Treatment, was preparing to be gone; and, making toward the Door, ſhow'd a Bag of Money, which he had ſtol'n from his Maſter,—the laſt he's ever like to have from thence.</p>

                  <p>Aye, ſhe, with her uſual Addreſs, return'd to her old Arts of lying, ſwearing, and diſſembling.—Hung on his Neck, and wept, and ſwore 'twas meant in Jeſt; till this eaſy Fool, melted into Tears, threw the Money into her Lap, and ſwore he had rather die, than think her falſe.</p>

Fondneſs, ſuch Joy, ſuch Grief, ſuch Pleaſure, and ſuch Anguiſh, that Nature in him ſeem'd ſinking with the Weight, and the charm'd Soul diſpos'd to quit his Breaſt for hers,—juſt then, when every Paſſion with lawleſs Anarchy prevail'd,—and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was in the raging Tempeſt loſt;—the cruel artful <hi>Millwood</hi> prevail'd upon the wretched Youth to promiſe what I tremble but to think on.</p>

                  <p>'Tis true, at the naming the Murder of his Uncle, he ſtarted into Rage; and, breaking from her Arms, where ſhe till then had held him, with well diſſembled Love and falſe Endearments, call'd her, cruel Monſter, Devil, and told her ſhe was born for his Deſtruction.—She thought it not for her Purpoſe to meet his Rage with Rage,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0811500900:46"/>
but affected a moſt paſſionate Fit of Grief;—rail'd at her Fate, and curs'd her wayward Stars,—that ſtill her Wants ſhou'd force her to preſs him to act ſuch Deeds, as ſhe muſt needs abhor, as well as he; but told him Neceſſity had no Law, and Love no Bounds; that therefore he never truly lov'd, but meant, in her Neceſſity, to forſake her;—then kneel'd and ſwore, that ſince, by his Refuſal, he had given her Cauſe to doubt his Love, ſhe never wou'd ſee him more; unleſs, to prove it true, he robb'd his Uncle to ſupply her Wants, and murder'd him, to keep it from Diſcovery.</p>

What drew me from my youthful Innocence, to ſtain my then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted Soul, but Love? What caus'd me to rob my gentle Maſter, but curſed Love?

                  <p>Yes, with Joy, that ſhe had gain'd her Point.—She gave him no Time to cool, but urg'd him to attempt it inſtantly. He's now gone; if he performs it, and eſcapes, there's more Money for her; if not, he'll ne'er return, and then ſhe's fairly rid of him.</p>
