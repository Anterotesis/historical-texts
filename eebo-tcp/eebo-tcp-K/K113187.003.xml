            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In the year 1389, a grand ſyſtem of divinity appeared at Paris, afterwards tranſlated by Caxton under the title of the COURT OF SAPYENCE, which abounds with a multitude of hiſtorical examples, parables, and apologues; and which the writer wiſely ſuppoſes, to be much more likely to intereſt the attention and excite the devotion of the people, than the authority of ſcience, and the parade of theology. In conſequence of the expediency of this mode of of inſtruction, the Legends of the Saints were received into the ritual, and rehearſed in the courſe of public worſhip. For religious romances were nearly allied to ſongs of chivalry; and the ſame groſs ignorance of the people, which in the early centuries of chriſtianity created a neceſſity of introducing the viſible pomp of theatrical ceremonies into the churches, was taught the duties of devotion, by being amuſed with the achieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſpiritual knight-errantry, and impreſſed with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of pious heroiſm. In more cultivated periods, the DECA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MERON of Boccace, and other books of that kind, ought to be conſidered as the remnant of a ſpecies of writing which was founded on the ſimplicity of mankind, and was adapted to the exigencies of the infancy of ſociety.</p>

But among the antient ſtory-books of this character, a Latin compilation entitled GESTA ROMANORUM ſeems to have been the favorite.</p>
            <p>This piece has been before incidentally noticed: but as it operated powerfully on the general body of our old poetry, affording a variety of inventions not only to Chaucer, Gower, and Lydgate, but to their diſtant ſucceſſors, I have judged it of ſufficient importance to be examined at large in a ſeparate diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: which has been deſignedly reſerved for this place, for the purpoſe both of recapitulation and illuſtration, and of giving the reader a more commodious opportunity of ſurveying at leiſure, from this intermediate point of view, and under one comprehenſive detail, a connected diſplay of the materials and original ſubjects of many of our paſt and future poets.</p>
            <p>Indeed, in the times with which we are now about to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, it ſeems to have been growing more into eſteem.

            <p>This work is compiled from the obſolete Latin chronicles of the later Roman or rather German ſtory, heightened by roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic inventions, from Legends of the Saints, oriental apologues, and many of the ſhorter fictitious narratives which came into Europe with the Arabian literature, and were familiar in the ages of ignorance and imagination.

Gower, in the CONFESSIO AMANTIS, often introduces Roman ſtories with the Latin preamble, <hi>Hic ſecundum</hi> GESTA. Where he certainly means the Roman Hiſtory, which by degrees had acquired ſimply the appellation of GESTA. Herman Korner, in his CHRONICA NOVELLA, written about the year 1438, refers for his vouchers to Bede, Oroſius, Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Maximus, Joſephus, Euſebius, and the <hi>Chronicon</hi> et GESTA ROMANORUM. Moſt probably, to ſay no more, by the CHRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NICON he means the later writers of the Roman affairs, ſuch as Iſidore and the monkiſh compilers; and by GESTA the antient Roman hiſtory, as related by Livy and the more eſtabliſhed Latin hiſtorians.</p>
            <p>Neither is it poſſible that this work could have been brought as a proof or authority, by any ſerious annaliſt, for the Roman ſtory.</p>
            <p>For though it bears the title of GESTA ROMANORUM, yet this title by no means properly correſponds with the contents of the collection: which, as has been already hinted, comprehends a multitude of narratives, either not hiſtorical; or, in another reſpect, ſuch as are either totally unconnected with the Roman people, or perhaps the moſt prepoſterous miſrepreſentations of their hiſtory. To cover this deviation from the promiſed plan, which, by introducing a more ample variety of matter, has contributed to encreaſe the reader's entertainment, our col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector has taken care to preface almoſt every ſtory with the name or reign of a Roman emperor; who, at the ſame time, is often a monarch that never exiſted, and who ſeldom, whether real or ſuppoſitious, has any concern with the circumſtances of the narrative. </p>

But I haſten to exhibit a compendious analyſis of the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which form this very ſingular compilation: intermixing occaſional illuſtrations ariſing from the ſubject, and ſhortening or lengthening my abridgement of the ſtories, in proportion as I judge they are likely to intereſt the reader. Where, for that reaſon, I have been very conciſe, I have yet ſaid enough to direct the critical antiquarian to this collection, in caſe he ſhould find a ſimilar tale occurring in any of our old poets. I have omitted the mention of a very few chapters, which were beneath notice. Sometimes, where common authors are quoted, I have only mentioned the author's name, without ſpecifying the ſubſtance of the quotation. For it was neceſſary that the reader ſhould be made acquainted with our collector's track of reading, and the books which he uſed. In the mean time, this review will ſerve as a full notification of the edition of 1488, which is more comprehenſive and complete than ſome others of later publication, and to which all the reſt, as to a general criterion, may be now comparatively referred.</p>
            <p>CHAP. i. Of a daughter of king Pompey, whoſe chamber was guarded by five armed knights and a dog. Being permitted to be preſent at a public ſhew, ſhe is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

All theſe preſents are inſcribed with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbial ſentences, ſuitable to the circumſtances of the princeſs.</p>
            <p>The latter part of this ſtory is evidently oriental. The feudal manners, in a book which profeſſes to record the achievements of the Roman people, are remarkable in the introductory cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. But of this mixture we ſhall ſee many ſtriking inſtances.</p>

            <p>This ſtory, but with a difference of circumſtances, ends like the beautiful apologue of the Prodigal Son.</p>

            <p>CHAP. x. Veſpaſian marries a wife in a diſtant country, who refuſes to return home with him, and yet declares ſhe will kill herſelf if he goes. The emperor ordered two rings to be made, of a wonderous efficacy; one of which, in the ſtone, has the image of Oblivion, the other the image of Memory: the ring of Oblivion he gave to the empreſs, and returned home with the ring of Memory.</p>
            <p>CHAP. xi. The queen of the ſouth ſends her daughter to king Alexander, to be his concubine. She was exceedingly beautiful, but had been nouriſhed with poiſon from her birth. Alexander's maſter, Ariſtotle, whoſe ſagacity nothing could eſcape, knowing this, entreated, that before ſhe was admitted to the king's bed, a malefactor condemned to death might be ſent for, who ſhould give her a kiſs in the preſence of the king.

His houſe was crouded with pilgrims, orphans, and widows, for whom three tables were kept every day.

            <p>CHAP. xvi. A Roman emperor in digging for the foundation of a new palace, finds a golden ſarcophagus, or coffin, inſcribed with myſterious words and ſentences.

Acquitting himſelf in all with ſingular addreſs and fidelity, he is made a knight, and loaded with riches.</p>
            <p>CHAP. xviii. A knight named Julian is hunting a ſtag, who turns and ſays, <q rend="inline">"you will kill your father and mother."</q> On this he went into a diſtant country, where he married a rich Lady of a caſtle. Julian's father and mother travelled into va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious lands to find their ſon, and at length accidentally came to this caſtle, in his abſence; where telling their ſtory to the lady, who had heard it from her huſband, ſhe diſcovered who they were, and gave them her own bed to ſleep in. Early in the morning, while ſhe was at maſs in the chapel, her huſband Julian unexpectedly returned; and entering his wife's chamber, perceived two perſons in the bed, whom he immediately ſlew with his ſword, haſtily ſuppoſing them to be his wife and her adulterer. At leaving the chamber, he met his wife coming from the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; and with great aſtoniſhment aſked her, who the perſons were ſleeping in her bed? She anſwered, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"They are your parents, who have been ſeeking you ſo long, and whom I have honoured with a place in our own bed."</q> Afterwards they founded a ſumptuous hoſpital for the accommodation of travellers, on the banks of a dangerous river.</p>

            <p>I take this opportunity of obſerving, that the Legends of the the Saints, ſo frequently referred to in the GESTA ROMA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NORUM, often contain high ſtrokes of fancy, both in the ſtructure and decorations of the ſtory. That they ſhould abound in extravagant conceptions, may be partly accounted for, from the ſuperſtitious and viſionary caſt of the writer: but the truth is, they derive this complexion from the eaſt. Some were originally forged by monks of the Greek church, to whom the oriental fictions and mode of fabling were familiar. The more early of the Latin lives were carried over to Conſtantinople, where they were tranſlated into Greek with new embelliſhments of eaſtern imagination. Theſe being returned into Europe, were tranſlated into Latin, where they naturally ſuperſeded the old Latin arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>types. Others of the Latin lives contracted this tincture, from being written after the Arabian literature became common in Europe. The following ideas in the Life of Saint Pelagian
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:0373600103:23"/>
evidently betray their original. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"As the bysſhop ſange maſſe in the cyte of Uſanance, he ſaw thre dropes ryghte clere all of one grateneſſe whiche were upon the aulter, and al thre ranne to gyder in to a precyous gemme: and whan they had ſet thys gemme in a croſſe of golde, al the other precyous ſtones that were there, fyllen<note n="d" place="bottom">Fell out.</note> out, and thys gemme was clere to them that were clene out of ſynne, and it was obſcure and darke to ſynners <note n="e" place="bottom">Caxton's GOLD. LEG. f. ccclxxxxviii.</note>, &amp;c."</q> The peculiar caſt of romantic inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was admirably ſuited to ſerve the purpoſes of ſuperſtition.</p>
            <p>Poſſevin, a learned Jeſuit, who wrote about the cloſe of the ſixteenth century, complains, that for the laſt five hundred years the courts of all the princes in Europe had been infatuated by reading romances: and that, in his time, it was a mark of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elegance, not to be familiarly acquainted with Lancelot du Lake, Perceforeſt, Triſtan, Giron the Courteous, Amadis de Gaul, Primaleon, Boccace's Decameron, and Arioſto. He even goes ſo far as to ſay, that the devil inſtigated Luther to procure a tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Amadis from Spaniſh into French, for the purpoſe of facilitating his grand ſcheme of overthrowing the catholic reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. The popularity of this book, he adds, warped the minds of the French nation from their antient notions and ſtudies; introduced a neglect of the ſcriptures, and propagated a love for aſtrology, and other fantaſtic arts <note n="f" place="bottom">BI<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>LIOTH. SELECT. Lib. i. cap. 25. p. 113. edit. 1593.</note>. But with the leave of this zealous catholic I would obſerve, that this ſort of reading was likely to produce, if any, an effect quite contrary. The genius of romance and of popery was the ſame; and both were ſtrengthened by the reciprocation of a ſimilar ſpirit of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity. The dragons and the caſtles of the one, were of a piece with the viſions and pretended miracles of the other. The ridiculous theories of falſe and unſolid ſcience, which, by the way, had been familiariſed to the French by other ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, long before the tranſlation of Amadis, were ſurely more likely to be advanced under the influence of a religion founded on
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:0373600103:24"/>
deception, than in conſequence of Luther's reformed ſyſtem, which aimed at purity and truth, and which was to gain its end by the ſuppreſſion of antient prejudices.</p>
            <p>Many of the abſurdities of the catholic worſhip were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, as I have hinted, in ſome degree neceſſary in the early ages of the church, on account of the ignorance of the people; at leaſt, under ſuch circumſtances they were natural, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore excuſable. But when the world became wiſer, thoſe mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meries ſhould have been aboliſhed, for the ſame reaſon that the preachers left off quoting Eſop's fables in their ſermons, and the ſtage ceaſed to inſtruct the people in the ſcripture-hiſtory by the repreſentation of the MYSTERIES. The advocates of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal communion do not conſider, that in a cultivated age, abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with every ſpecies of knowledge, they continue to retain thoſe fooleries which were calculated only for chriſtians in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of barbariſm, and of which the uſe now no longer ſubſiſts.</p>
            <p>CHAP. xix. When Julius Ceſar was preparing to paſs the Rubicon, a gigantic ſpectre appeared from the middle of the river, threatening to interrupt his paſſage, if he came not to eſtabliſh the peace of Rome. Our author cites the GESTA ROMANORUM for this ſtory.</p>
            <p>It was impoſſible that the Roman hiſtory could paſs through the dark ages, without being infected with many romantic cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions. Indeed, the Roman was almoſt the only antient hiſtory, which the readers of thoſe ages knew: and what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated even to pagan Rome, the parent of the more modern papal metropolis of chriſtianity, was regarded with a ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious veneration, and often magnified with miraculous additions.</p>
            <p>CHAP. xx. The birth of the emperor Henry, ſon of earl Leopold, and his wonderful preſervation from the ſtratagems of the emperor Conrade, till his acceſſion to the imperial throne.</p>
            <p>This ſtory is told by Caxton in the GOLDEN LEGENDE, under the life of Pelagian the pope, entitled, <hi>Here foloweth the lyf of Saynt Pelagyen the pope, with many other hyſtoryes and</hi>

               </note>. Pliny, in relating this ſtory, ſays, that the temperature of glaſs, ſo as to render it flexible, was diſcovered under the reign of Tiberius.</p>
            <p>In the ſame chapter Pliny obſerves, that glaſs is ſuſceptible of all colours. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Fit et album, et murrhinum, aut hyacinthos ſapphiroſque imitatum, et omnibus aliis coloribus.

The firſt notice of windows of a church made of coloured glaſs occurs in chronicles quoted by Muratori. In the year 802, a pope built a church at Rome, and, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"feneſtras ex vitro diverſis coloribus concluſit atque deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravit <note n="s" place="bottom">DISSERT.

To expreſs figures in glaſs, or what we now call the art of

painting in glaſs, was a very different work: and, I believe, I can ſhew it was brought from Conſtantinople to Rome before the tenth century, with other ornamental arts. Guiccardini, who wrote about 1560, in his <hi>Deſcrittione de tutti Paeſi Baſſi,</hi> aſcribes the invention of baking colours in glaſs for church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>windows to the Netherlanders <note n="u" place="bottom">Antw.

It is certain that this art owed much to the laborious and mechanical genius of the Germans; and, in particular, their deep reſearches and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments in chemiſtry, which they cultivated in the dark ages with the moſt indefatigable aſſiduity, muſt have greatly aſſiſted its operations.

            <p>CHAP. lxxx. A devout hermit lived in a cave, near which a ſhepherd folded his flock. Many of the ſheep being ſtolen, the ſhepherd was unjuſtly killed by his maſter as being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the theft. The hermit ſeeing an innocent man put to death, began to ſuſpect the exiſtence of a divine Providence; and reſolved no longer to perplex himſelf with the uſeleſs ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of religion, but to mix in the world. In travelling from his retirement, he was met by an angel in the figure of a man; who ſaid, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I am an angel, and am ſent by God to be your companion on the road."</q> They entered a city; and begged for lodging at the houſe of a knight, who entertained them at a ſplendid ſupper. In the night, the angel roſe from his bed, and ſtrangled the knight's only child who was aſleep in the
<pb n="xxix" facs="tcp:0373600103:36"/>
cradle. The hermit was aſtoniſhed at this barbarous return for ſo much hoſpitality, but was afraid to make any remonſtrance to his companion. Next morning they went to another city. Here they were liberally received in the houſe of an opulent citizen; but in the night the angel roſe, and ſtole a golden cup of ineſtimable value. The hermit now concluded, that his companion was a Bad Angel. In travelling forward the next morning, they paſſed over a bridge; about the middle of which they met a poor man, of whom the angel aſked the way to the next city. Having received the deſired information, the angel puſhed the poor man into the water, where he was immediately drowned. In the evening they arrived at the houſe of a rich man; and begging for a lodging, were ordered to ſleep in a ſhed with the cattle. In the morning the angel gave the rich man the cup which he had ſtolen. The hermit, amazed that the cup which was ſtolen from their friend and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor ſhould be given to one who refuſed them a lodging, began to be now convinced that his companion was the devil; and begged to go on alone. But the angel ſaid, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Hear me, and depart. When you lived in your hermitage a ſhepherd was killed by his maſter. He was innocent of the ſuppoſed offence: but had he not been then killed, he would have committed crimes in which he would have died impenitent. His maſter endeavours to atone for the murther, by dedicating the remainder of his days to alms and deeds of charity. I ſtrangled the child of the knight. But know, that the father was ſo intent on heaping up riches for this child, as to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect thoſe acts of public munificence for which he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo diſtinguiſhed, and to which he has now returned. I ſtole the golden cup of the hoſpitable citizen. But know, that from a life of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tricteſt temperance, he became, in conſequence of poſſeſſing this cup, a perpetual drunkard; and is now the moſt abſtemious of men. I threw the poor man into the water. He was then honeſt and religious. But know, had he walked one half of a mile further, he would
<pb n="xxx" facs="tcp:0373600103:37"/>
have murthered a man in a ſtate of mortal ſin. I gave the golden cup to the rich man who refuſed to take us within his roof. He has therefore received his reward in this world; and in the next, will ſuffer the pains of hell for his inhoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality."</q> The hermit fell proſtrate at the angel's feet; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting forgiveneſs, returned to his hermitage, fully convinced of the wiſdom and juſtice of God's government.</p>
            <p>This is the fable of Parnell's HERMIT, which that elegant yet original writer has heightened with many maſterly touches of poetical colouring, and a happier arrangement of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. Among other proofs which might be mentioned of Parnell's genius and addreſs in treating this ſubject, by reſerving the diſcovery of the angel to a critical period at the cloſe of the fable, he has found means to introduce a beautiful deſcription, and an intereſting ſurpriſe. In this poem, the laſt inſtance of the angel's ſeeming injuſtice, is that of puſhing the guide from the bridge into the river. At this, the hermit is unable to ſuppreſs his indignation.</p>

For what is the reaſon we are ſo much pleaſed with the reading romances and the fictions of the poets, but that here, as Ariſtotle ſays, things are ſet down as they ſhould be; but in the true hiſtory hitherto of the world, things are recorded indeed as they are, but it is but a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, that they have not been as they ſhould be?

And for my own part, I doubt not but that it will ſo come to paſs in the cloſe of the world.

CHAP. ci. Of Ganterus, who for his proweſs in war being elected a king of a certain country, is on the night of his coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation conducted to a chamber, where at the head of the bed is a fierce lion, at the feet a dragon, and on either ſide a bear, toads, and ſerpents. He immediately quitted his new kingdom; and was quickly elected king of another country. Going to reſt the firſt night, he was led into a chamber furniſhed with a bed richly embroidered, but ſtuck all over with ſharp razors. This kingdom he alſo relinquiſhes. At length he meets a hermit, who gives him a ſtaff, with which he is directed to knock at the gate of a magnificent palace, ſeated on a lofty mountain. Here he gains admittance, and finds every ſort of happineſs unembittered with the laeſt degree of pain.</p>
            <p>The king means every man advanced to riches and honour, and who thinks to enjoy theſe advantages without interruption and alloy. The hermit is religion, the ſtaff penitence, and the palace heaven.</p>
            <p>In a more confined ſenſe, the firſt part of this apologue may be ſeparately interpreted to ſignify, that a king, when he enters on his important charge, ought not to ſuppoſe himſelf to ſucceed to the privilege of an exemption from care, and to be put into immediate poſſeſſion of the higheſt pleaſures, conveniencies, and felicities of life; but to be ſenſible, that from that moment, he begins to encounter the greateſt dangers and difficulties.</p>

            <p>The learned reader muſt immediately recollect a ſimilar ſtory of one Androclus, who being expoſed to fight with wild beaſts in the Roman amphitheatre, is recogniſed and unattacked by a moſt ſavage lion, whom he had formerly healed exactly in the ſame manner. But I believe the whole is nothing more than an oriental apologue on gratitude, written much earlier; and that it here exiſts in its original ſtate. Androclus's ſtory is related by Aulus Gellius, on the authority of a Greek writer, one Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, called Pliſtonices, who flouriſhed under Tiberius. The cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Appion, with which Gellius prefaces this tale, in ſome meaſure invalidates his credit; notwithſtanding he pretends to

But the two writers agree only in the general ſubject. Our compiler's narrative has much more ſimplicity than that of Gellius; and contains marks of eaſtern manners and life. Let me add, that the oriental fabuliſts are fond of illuſtrating and enforcing the duty of gratitude, by feigning inſtances of the gratitude of beaſts towards men. And of this the preſent compilation, which is ſtrongly tinctured with orientaliſm, affords ſeveral other proofs.</p>

A ſerpent had a neſt near the ſpot where the bell-rope fell. In the abſence of the ſerpent, a toad took poſſeſſion of her neſt. The ſerpent twiſting herſelf round the rope, rang the bell for juſtice; and by the emperor's ſpecial command the toad was killed. A few days afterwards, as the king was repoſing on his couch, the ſerpent entered the chamber, bearing a precious ſtone in her mouth. The ſerpent creeping up to the emperor's face, laid the precious ſtone on his eyes, and glided out of the apartment. Immediately the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror was reſtored to his ſight.</p>

William of Malmeſbury is, I believe, the firſt writer now extant by whom it is recorded: and he produces it partly to ſhew, that Gerbert was not always ſucceſsful in thoſe attempts which he ſo frequently practiſed to diſcover treaſures hid in the earth, by the application of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cromantic arts. I will tranſlate Malmeſbury's narration of this fable, as it varies in ſome of the circumſtances, and has ſome heightenings of the fiction. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"At Rome there was a brazen ſtatue, extending the forefinger of the right hand; and on its forehead was written <hi>Strike here.</hi> Being ſuſpected to conceal a treaſure, it had received many bruiſes from the credulous and ignorant, in their endeavours to open it. At length Gerbert unriddled the myſtery. At noon-day obſerving the reflection of the forefinger on the ground, he marked the ſpot. At night he came to the place, with a page carrying a lamp. There by a magical operation he opened a wide paſſage in the earth; through which they both deſcended, and came to a vaſt palace. The walls, the beams, and the whole ſtructure, were of gold: they ſaw golden images of knights playing at cheſs, with a king and queen of gold at a banquet, with numerous attendants in gold, and cups of immenſe ſize and value. In a receſs was a carbuncle, whoſe luſtre illuminated the whole palace: oppoſite to which ſtood a figure with a bended bow. As they attempted to touch ſome of the rich furniture, all the golden images ſeemed to ruſh upon them. Gerbert was too wiſe to attempt this a ſecond time: but the page was bold enough to ſnatch from the table a golden knife of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite workmanſhip. At that moment, all the golden images roſe up with a dreadful noiſe; the figure with the bow ſhot at the carbuncle; and a total darkneſs enſued. The page then replaced the knife, otherwiſe, they both would have ſuffered a cruel death."</q> Malmeſbury afterwards mentions a brazen bridge, framed by the enchantments of Gerbert, beyond which
<pb n="xlvi" facs="tcp:0373600103:53"/>
were golden horſes of a gigantic ſize, with riders of gold richly illuminated by the moſt ſerene meridian ſun. A large company attempt to paſs the bridge, with a deſign of ſtealing ſome pieces of the gold. Immediately the bridge roſe from its foundations, and ſtood perpendicular on one end: a brazen man appeared from beneath it, who ſtruck the water with a mace of braſs, and the ſky was overſpread with the moſt horrible gloom. Gerbert, like ſome other learned necromancers of the Gothic ages, was ſuppoſed to have fabricated a brazen head under the influence of certain planets, which anſwered queſtions. But I forbear to ſuggeſt any more hints for a future collection of Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian tales. I ſhall only add Malmeſbury's account of the educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gerbert, which is a curious illuſtration of what has been often inculcated in theſe volumes, concerning the introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of romantic fiction into Europe <note n="f" place="bottom">See DISS. i. And vol. i. 400. ſeq.</note>. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Gerbert, a native of France, went into Spain for the purpoſe of learning aſtrology, and other ſciences of that caſt, of the Saracens; who, to this day, occupy the upper regions of Spain. They are ſeated in the metropolis of Seville; where, according to the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomary practice of their country, they ſtudy the arts of divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and enchantment.—Here Gerbert ſoon exceeded Ptolemy in the aſtrolabe, Alchind in aſtronomy, and Julius Firmicus in fatality. Here he learned the meaning of the flight and language of birds, and was taught how to raiſe ſpectres from hell. Here he acquired whatever human cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity has diſcovered for the deſtruction or convenience of mankind. I ſay nothing of his knowledge in arithmetic, muſic, and geometry; which he ſo fully underſtood as to think them beneath his genius, and which he yet with great induſtry introduced into France, where they had been long forgotten.

            <p>This romantic legend of Barlaam and Joſaphat, which is a hiſtory of conſiderable length, is undoubtedly the compoſition of one who had an intercourſe with the eaſt: and from the ſtrong traces which it contains of the oriental mode of mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſing, appears plainly to have been written, if not by the monk whoſe name it bears, at leaſt by ſome devout and learned aſcetic of the Greek church, and probably before the tenth century.</p>

Alphonſus the ninth, about the year 1214, having expelled the Moors from Toledo, endeavoured to eſtabliſh the Roman miſſal in the place of ſaint Iſidore's. This alarming innovation was obſtinately oppoſed by the people of Toledo; and the king found that his project would be attended with almoſt inſuperable difficulties. The conteſt at length between the two miſſals grew ſo ſerious, that it was mutually reſolved to decide the controverſy, not by a theological diſputation, but by ſingle combat; in which the champion of the Toletan miſſal proved victorious <note n="a" place="bottom">See the MOZARA<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>CHAP. cxix. A king had an oppreſſive Seneſhall, who paſſing through a foreſt, fell into a deep pit, in which were a lion, an ape, and a ſerpent. A poor man who gathered ſticks in the foreſt hearing his cries, drew him up: together with the lion, the ape, and the ſerpent. The Seneſhall returned home, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to reward the poor man with great riches. Soon after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the poor man went to the palace to claim the promiſed reward; but was ordered to be cruelly beaten by the ſeneſhall. In the mean time, the lion drove ten aſſes laden with gold to the poor man's cottage: the ſerpent brought him a pretious ſtone of three colours: and the ape, when he came to the foreſt on his daily buſineſs, laid him heaps of wood. The poor man, in conſequence of the virtues of the ſerpent's pretious ſtone,
<pb n="lv" facs="tcp:0373600103:62"/>
which he ſold, arrived to the dignity of knighthood, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired ample poſſeſſions. But afterwards he found the pretious ſtone in his cheſt, which he preſented to the king. The king having heard the whole ſtory, ordered the ſeneſhall to be put to death for his ingratitude, and preferred the poor man to his office.</p>

            <p>CHAP. XX. King Darius's legacy to his three ſons. To the eldeſt he bequeathes all his paternal inheritance: to the ſecond, all that he had acquired by conqueſt: and to the third, a ring and necklace, both of gold, and a rich cloth. All the three laſt gifts were endued with magical virtues. Whoever wore the ring on his finger, gained the love or favour of all whom he deſired to pleaſe. Whoever hung the necklace over his breaſt, obtained all his heart could deſire. Whoever ſate down on the cloth, could be inſtantly tranſported to any part of the world which he choſe.</p>

            <p>CHAP. cxli. A knight who had diſſipated all his ſubſtance in frequenting tournaments, under the reign of Fulgentius, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to extreme poverty. A ſerpent haunted a chamber of his houſe; who being conſtantly fed with milk by the knight, in return made his benefactor rich. The knight's ingratitude and imprudence in killing the ſerpent, who was ſuppoſed to guard a treaſure concealed in his chamber.</p>
            <p>Medea's dragon guarding the golden fleece is founded on the oriental idea of treaſure being guarded by ſerpents. We are told in Vincent of Beauvais, that there are mountains of ſolid gold in India guarded by dragons and griffins <note n="e" place="bottom">SPECUL. HIST. Lib. i. c. 64. fol. 9. b.</note>.</p>
            <p>CHAP. cxliii. A certain king ordained a law, that if any man was ſuddenly to be put to death, at ſun-riſing a trumpet ſhould be ſounded before his gate.

<pb n="lx" facs="tcp:0373600103:67"/>
The king replied, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Go home, and you ſhall hear my anſwer to morrow."</q> The king ordered his trumpeters to ſound early the next morning before his brother's gate, and to bring him with them to judgement. The brother, on hearing this unexpected dreadful ſummons, was ſeized with horror, and came before the king in a black robe. The king commanded a deep pit to be made, and a chair compoſed of the moſt frail materials, and ſupported by four ſlight legs, to be placed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining over the edge of the pit. In this the brother, being ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped naked, was ſeated. Over his head a ſharp ſword was hung by a ſmall thread of ſilk. Around him four men were ſtationed with ſwords exceedingly ſharp, who were to wait for the king's word, and then to kill him. In the mean time, a table co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with the moſt coſtly diſhes was ſpread before him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with all ſorts of muſic. Then ſaid the king, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"My brother, why are you ſo ſad? Can you be dejected, in the midſt of this delicious muſic, and with all theſe choice dainties?"</q> He anſwered, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"How can I be glad, when I have this morning heard the trumpet of death at my doors, and while I am ſeated in this tottering chair? If I make the ſmalleſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it will break, and I ſhall fall into the pit, from which I ſhall never ariſe again. If I lift my head, the ſuſpended ſword will penetrate my brain; while theſe four tormentors only wait your command to put me to death."</q> The king replied, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Now I will anſwer your queſtion, why I was ſad yeſterday. I am exactly in your ſituation. I am ſeated, like you, in a frail and periſhable chair, ready to tumble to pieces every moment, and to throw me into the infernal pit. Divine judgement, like this ſharp ſword, hangs over my head: and I am ſurrounded, like you, with four executioners. That before me is Death, whoſe coming I cannot tell; that behind me, my Sins, which are prepared to accuſe me before the tribunal of God; that on the right, the Devil, who is ever watching for his prey; and that on the left, the Worm, who is now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

Here is a traite of the private life of our anceſtors, who wanted the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and engagements of modern times to relieve a tedious even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Hence we learn, that when a company was aſſembled, if a
<pb n="lxv" facs="tcp:0373600103:72"/>
jugler or a minſtrel were not preſent, it was their cuſtom to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain themſelves by relating or hearing a ſeries of adventures. Thus the general plan of the CANTERBURY TALES, which at firſt ſight ſeems to be merely an ingenious invention of the poet to ſerve a particular occaſion, is in great meaſure founded on a faſhion of antient life: and Chaucer, in ſuppoſing each of the pilgrims to tell a tale as they are travelling to Becket's ſhrine, only makes them adopt a mode of amuſement which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the converſations of his age. I do not deny, that Chaucer has ſhewn his addreſs in the uſe and application of this practice.</p>
            <p>So habitual was this amuſement in the dark ages, that the graver ſort thought it unſafe for eccleſiaſtics, if the ſubjects ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted any degree of levity. The following curious injunction was deemed neceſſary, in a code of ſtatutes aſſigned to a college at Oxford in the year 1292. I give it in Engliſh. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"CH. xx.—The fellows ſhall all live honeſtly, as becomes Clerks.—They ſhall not rehearſe, ſing, nor willingly hear, BALLADS or TALES of LOVERS, which tend to laſciviouſneſs and idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <note n="t" place="bottom">CANTILENA<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

On looking downward, he ſaw a huge dragon twiſted round the trunk, and gaping to devour him. He alſo obſerved two mice gnawing at the roots of the tree, which began to totter. Four white vipers impregnated the air of the pit with their poiſonous breath. Looking about him, he diſcovered a ſtream of hony diſtilling from one of the branches of the tree, which he began eagerly to devour, without regarding his dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſituation.

Emprinted at Weſtminſter by William Caxton the firſt yere of kynge Edward <hi>V. 1483.</hi>"</q> The French book, which is a viſion, and has ſome degree of imagination, is probably the PELERIN DE L'AME, of Guillaume prior of Chaulis <note n="k" place="bottom">See ſupr. vol. ii. p. 120.</note>. This tranſlation was made from the French, with additions, in the year 1413. For in the colophon are theſe words. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Here endeth the dreme of the PYLGREMAGE OF THE SOWLE tranſlated out of Frenſche into Englisſhe, with ſomwhat of Addicions, the yere of our lorde M.

Not to inſiſt on the correſpondence of time and ſtyle, I obſerve, that the thirty-fourth chapter of Lydgate's metrical LIFE OF THE VIRGIN MARY is literally repeated in the thirty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourth chapter of this Tranſlation. This chapter is a digreſſion of five or ſix ſtanzas in praiſe of Chaucer; in which the writer feelingly laments the recent death of his <hi>maiſter Chaucer, poete of Britaine,</hi> who uſed to <hi>amende and correcte the wronge traces of my rude penne.</hi> No writer beſides, in Lydgate's own life-time, can be ſuppoſed, with any ſort of grace or propriety, to have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned thoſe perſonal aſſiſtances of Chaucer, in Lydgate's own

Ad calc. Opp. Chauc. fol. 376, col. 1.</note>.</p>
            <p>Another piece probably written by Lydgate, yet never ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed or acknowledged to be of his compoſition, is a poem in the octave ſtanza, containing thirty-ſeven leaves in folio, and entitled LABEROUS AND MARVEYLOUS WORKE OF SAPIENCE. After a long debate between MERCY and TRUTH, and JUSTICE and PEACE, all the products of nature and of human know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge are deſcribed, as they ſtand arranged in the palace and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of WISDOM. It is generally allowed to have been printed by Caxton: it has not the name of the printer, nor any date. Had it been written by Caxton, as I once haſtily ſuſpected, or by any of his cotemporaries, the name of Lydgate would have appeared in conjunction with thoſe of Gower and Chaucer, who are highly celebrated in the Prologue as <hi>erthely gods expert in poeſie:</hi> for theſe three writers were conſtantly joined in pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyric, at leaſt for a century, by their ſucceſſors, as the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed triumvirate of Engliſh poetry. In the ſame Prologue, the author ſays he was commanded to write this poem by the king. No poet cotemporary with Caxton was of conſequence enough to receive ſuch a command: and we know that Lydgate compiled many of his works by the direction, or under the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage, of king Henry the fifth. Lydgate was born in Suffolk: and our author from the circumſtance of having lived in a part of England not of a very poliſhed dialect, apologiſes for the rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his language, ſo that he cannot <hi>delycately endyte.</hi> It is much in the ſtyle and manner of Lydgate: and I believe it to have been one of his early performances <note n="l" place="bottom">See ſupr. vol. ii. p. 194.

            <p>CHAP. clxxii. A king of England has two knights, named

Guido and Tirius. Guido having achieved many ſplendid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits for the love of a beautiful lady, at length married her. Three days after his marriage he ſaw a viſion, which ſummoned him to engage in the holy war. At parting ſhe gave him a ring; ſaying, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"as often as you look on this ring, remember me."</q> Soon after his departure ſhe had a ſon. After various adventures, in which his friend Tirius has a ſhare, at the end of ſeven years he returned to England in the habit of a pilgrim. Coming to his caſtle, he ſaw at the gate his lady ſitting, and diſtributing alms to a croud of poor people; ordering them all to pray for the return of her lord Guido from the holy land. She was on that day accompanied by her ſon a little boy, very beautiful, and richly apparelled; and who hearing his mother, as ſhe was diſtributing her alms, perpetually recommending Guido to their prayers, aſked, if that was his father? Among others, ſhe gave alms to her huſband Guido, not knowing him in the pilgrim's diſguiſe. Guido, ſeeing the little boy, took him in his arms, and kiſſed him: ſaying, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"O my ſweet ſon, may God give you grace to pleaſe him!"</q> For this boldneſs he was reproved by the attendants. But the lady, finding him deſtitute and a ſtranger, aſſigned him a cottage in a neighbouring foreſt. Soon afterwards falling ſick, he ſaid to his ſervant, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Carry this ring to your lady, and tell her, if ſhe deſires ever to ſee me again, to come hither without delay."</q> The ſervant conveyed the ring; but before ſhe arrived, he was dead. She threw her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on his body, and exclaimed with tears, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Where are now my alms which I daily gave for my lord? I ſaw you receive thoſe alms, but I knew you not.—You beheld, embraced, and kiſſed your own ſon, but did not diſcover yourſelf to him nor to me. What have I done, that I ſhall ſee you no more?"</q> She then interred him magnificently.</p>
            <p>The reader perceives this is the ſtory of Guido, or Guy, earl of Warwick; and probably this is the early outline of the life and death of that renowned champion.</p>
            <p>Many romances were at firſt little more than legends of devotion,
<pb n="lxxii" facs="tcp:0373600103:79"/>
containing the pilgrimage of an old warrior. At length, as chivalry came more into vogue, and the ſtores of invention were increaſed, the youthful and active part of the pilgrim's life was alſo written, and a long ſeries of imaginary martial adventures was added, in which his religious was eclipſed by his heroic character, and the penitent was loſt in the knight-errant. That which was the principal ſubject of the ſhort and ſimple legend, became only the remote cataſtrophe of the voluminous romance. And hence by degrees it was almoſt an eſtabliſhed rule of every romance, for the knight to end his days in a hermitage. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantes has ridiculed this circumſtance with great pleaſantry, where Don Quixote holds a grave debate with Sancho, whether he ſhall turn ſaint or archbiſhop.</p>
            <p>So reciprocal, or rather ſo convertible, was the pious and the military character, that even ſome of the apoſtles had their ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance. In the ninth century, the chivalrous and fabling ſpirit of the Spaniards transformed ſaint James into a knight. They pretended that he appeared and fought with irreſiſtible fury, completely armed, and mounted on a ſtately white horſe, in moſt of their engagements with the Moors; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>cauſe, by his ſuperior proweſs in theſe bloody conflicts, he was ſuppoſed to have freed the Spaniards from paying the annual tribute of a hundred chriſtian virgins to their infidel enemies, they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him as a profeſſed and powerful champion of diſtreſſed damſels. This apotheoſis of chivalry in the perſon of their own apoſtle, muſt have ever afterwards contributed to exaggerate the characteriſtical romantic heroiſm of the Spaniards, by which it was occaſioned; and to propagate through ſucceeding ages, a ſtronger veneration for that ſpecies of military enthuſiaſm, to which they were naturally devoted. It is certain, that in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of theſe illuſtrious achievements in the Mooriſh wars, ſaint James was conſtituted patron of Spain; and became the founder of one of the moſt magnificent ſhrines, and of the moſt opulent order of knighthood, now exiſting in chriſtendom.

In this age of curioſity, diſtinguiſhed for its love of hiſtorical anecdotes and the inveſtigation of antient manners, it is extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary that a new tranſlation ſhould not be made of Froiſſart from a collated and corrected original of the French. Froiſſart is commonly ranked with romances: but it ought to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, that he is the hiſtorian of a romantic age, when thoſe manners which form the fantaſtic books of chivalry were actually practiſed. As he received his multifarious intelligence from ſuch a variety of vouchers, and of different nations, and almoſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways collected his knowledge of events from report, rather than from written or recorded evidence, his notices of perſons and places are frequently confuſed and unexact. Many of theſe petty incorrectneſſes are not, however, to be imputed to Froiſſart: and it may ſeem ſurpriſing, that there are not more inaccuracies of this kind in a voluminous chronicle, treating of the affairs of England, and abounding in Engliſh appellations, compoſed by a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and printed in France. Whoever will take the pains to compare this author with the coeval records in Rymer, will find numerous inſtances of his truth and integrity, in relating the more public and important tranſactions of his own times. Why he ſhould not have been honoured with a modern edition at the Louvre, it is eaſy to conceive: the French have a national prejudice againſt a writer, who has been ſo much more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſant to England, than to their own country. Upon the whole, if Froiſſart ſhould be neglected by the hiſtorical reader for his want of preciſion and authenticity, he will at leaſt be valued by the philoſopher for his ſtriking pictures of life, drawn without reſerve or affectation from real nature with a faithful and free pencil, and by one who had the beſt opportunities of obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, who was welcome alike to the feudal caſtle or the royal palace, and who mingled in the buſtle and buſineſs of the world, at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>CHAP. clxxix. Ceſarius, ſaint Baſil, the Goſpel, Boethius, and Ovid, are quoted to ſhew the deteſtable guilt of gluttony and ebriety.</p>
            <p>Ceſarius, I ſuppoſe, is a Ciſtercian monk of the thirteenth century; who, beſide voluminous Lives, Chronicles, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, wrote twelve Books on the Miracles, Viſions, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, of his own age. But there is another and an older monkiſh writer of the ſame name. In the Britiſh Muſeum, there is a narrative taken from Ceſarius, in old northern Engliſh, of a lady deceived by the fiends, or the devil, through the pride of rich clothing <note n="h" place="bottom">MSS. HARL. 1022. 4.</note>.</p>

            <p>CHAP. clxxxi. The ſagacity of a lion.</p>
            <p>This is the laſt chapter in the edition of 1488.</p>
            <p>Manuſcript copies of the GESTA ROMANORUM are very numerous <note n="i" place="bottom">See ſupr. vol. ii. p. 19.</note>. A proof of the popularity of the work.

But although the printed copies have one hundred and eighty-one ſtories or chapters, there are many in the manuſcripts which do not appear in the editions.

Berchorius was conſtituted grammatical preceptor to the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of the Benedictine Congregation, or monaſtery, at Clugni, in the year 1340 <note n="l" place="bottom">Oudin. ubi ſupr. p. 1063.</note>. At which time he drew up his Notes on the Proſody, and his Commentary on Ovid, for the uſe of his ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. About the ſame time, and with a view of rendering their exerciſes in Latinity more agreeable and eaſy by an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Latin ſtory-book, yet reſoluble into leſſons of religion, he probably compiled the GESTA: perpetually addreſſing the application of every tale to his young audience, by the paternal and affectionate appellation of CARISSIMI <note n="m" place="bottom">This, by habit, and otherwiſe with no impropriety, he ſeems to have retained in his later and larger works.</note>. There was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore time enough for the GESTA to become a faſhionable book of tales, before Boccace publiſhed his DECAMERON. The action of the DECAMERON being ſuppoſed in 1348, the year of the great peſtilence, we may ſafely conjecture, that Boccace did not begin his work till after that period. An exact and ingenious critic has proved, that it was not finiſhed till the year 1358 <note n="n" place="bottom">See Tyrwhitt's CHAUCER, iv. 115. ſeq.</note>.</p>
            <p>I have juſt obſerved, that Berchorius probably compiled this work for the uſe of his grammatical pupils. Were there not many good reaſons for that ſuppoſition, I ſhould be induced to think, that it might have been intended as a book of ſtories for the purpoſe of preachers. I have already given inſtances, that it was antiently faſhionable for preachers to enforce the ſeveral moral duties by applying fables, or exemplary narratives: and, in the preſent caſe, the perpetual recurrence of the addreſs of CARISSIMI might be brought in favour of this hypotheſis. But I will here ſuggeſt an additional reaſon. Soon after the age of

Berchorius, a ſimilar collection of ſtories, of the ſame caſt, was compiled, though not exactly in the ſame form, profeſſedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for ſermon writers, and by one who was himſelf an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent preacher: for, rather before the year 1480, a Latin volume was printed in Germany, written by John Herolt a Dominican friar of Baſil, better known by the adopted and humble appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of DISCIPULUS, and who flouriſhed about the year 1418. It conſiſts of three parts. The firſt is entitled <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Incipiunt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mones pernotabiles DISCIPULI de Sanctis per anni circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum."</q> That is, a ſet of Sermons on the Saints of the whole year. The ſecond part, and with which I am now chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, is a PROMPTUARY, or ample repoſitory, of examples for compoſing ſermons: and in the Prologue to this part the author ſays, that ſaint Dominic always <hi>abundabat exemplis</hi> in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, and that he conſtantly practiced this popular mode of edification.

            <p>It may not be thought impertinent to cloſe this diſcourſe with a remark on the MORALISATIONS, ſubjoined to the ſtories of the GESTA ROMANORUM. This was an age of viſion and myſtery: and every work was believed to contain a double, or

ſecondary, meaning. Nothing eſcaped this eccentric ſpirit of refinement and abſtraction: and, together with the bible, as we have ſeen, not only the general hiſtory of antient times was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained allegorically, but even the poetical fictions of the claſſics were made to ſignify the great truths of religion, with a degree of boldneſs, and a want of a diſcrimination, which in another age would have acquired the character of the moſt profane levity, if not of abſolute impiety, and can only be defended from the ſimplicity of the ſtate of knowledge which then prevailed.</p>
            <p>Thus, God creating man of clay, animated with the vital principle of reſpiration, was the ſtory of Prometheus, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Chriſt twice born, of his father God and of his mother Mary, was prefigured by Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus, who was firſt born of Semele, and afterwards of Jupiter. And as Minerva ſprung from the brain of Jupiter, ſo Chriſt proceeded from God without a mother. Chriſt born of the Virgin Mary was expreſſed in the fable of Danae ſhut within a tower, through the covering of which Jupiter deſcended in a ſhower of gold, and begot Perſeus. Acteon, killed by his own hounds, was a type of the perſecution and death of our Saviour. The poet Lycophron relates, that Hercules in returning from the adventure of the Golden Fleece was ſhipwrecked; and that being devoured by a monſtrous fiſh, he was diſgorged alive on the ſhore after three days.

At length, compoſitions profeſſedly allegorical, with which that age abounded, were reſolved into allegories for which they were never intended. In the famous ROMAUNT OF THE ROSE, written about the year 1310, the poet couches the difficulties of an ardent lover in attaining the object of his paſſion, under the allegory of a Roſe, which is gathered in a delicious but almoſt inacceſſible garden. The theologiſts proved this roſe to be the white roſe of Jericho, the new Jeruſalem, a ſtate of grace, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine wiſdom, the holy Virgin, or eternal beatitude, at none of which obſtinate heretics can ever arrive. The chemiſts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that it was the philoſopher's ſtone; the civilians, that it was the moſt conſummate point of equitable deciſion; and the phyſicians, that it was an infallible panacea. In a word, other profeſſions, in the moſt elaborate commentaries, explained away the lover's roſe into the myſteries of their own reſpective ſcience. In conformity to this practice, Taſſo allegoriſed his own poem: and a flimſy ſtructure of morality was raiſed on the chimerical conceptions of Arioſto's ORLANDO. In the year 1577, a tranſlation of a part of Amadis de Gaule appeared in France; with a learned preface, developing the valuable ſtores of profound inſtruction, concealed under the naked letter of the old romances, which were diſcernible only to the intelligent, and totally unperceived by common readers; who, inſtead of plucking the fruit, were obliged to reſt contented with <hi>le ſimple</hi> FLEUR <hi>de la Lecture litterale.</hi> Even Spenſer, at a later period, could not indulge his native impulſe to deſcriptions of chivalry, without framing ſuch a ſtory, as conveyed, under the <hi>dark con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit</hi> of ideal champions, a ſet of hiſtoric tranſactions, and an exemplification of the nature of the twelve moral virtues. He preſents his fantaſtic queen with a rich romantic mirrour, which ſhewed the wonderous achievements of her magnificent anceſtry.</p>

            <p>It was not, however, ſolely from an unmeaning and a wanton ſpirit of refinement, that the faſhion of reſolving every thing into allegory ſo univerſally prevailed. The ſame apology may be offered for the cabaliſtical interpreters, both of the claſſics and of the old romances. The former not willing that thoſe books ſhould be quite exploded which contained the antient mythology, laboured to reconcile the apparent abſurdities of the pagan ſyſtem to the chriſtian myſteries, by demonſtrating a figurative reſemblance. The latter, as true learning began to dawn, with a view of ſupporting for a while the expiring credit of giants and magicians, were compelled to palliate thoſe monſtrous incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibilities, by a bold attempt to unravel the myſtic web which had been wove by fairy hands, and by ſhewing that truth was hid under the gorgeous veil of Gothic invention.</p>

            <p>OUR communications and intercourſe with Italy, which began to prevail about the beginning of the ſixteenth century, not only introduced the ſtudies of claſſical lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature into England, but gave a new turn to our vernacular poetry. At this period, Petrarch ſtill continued the moſt favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite poet of the Italians; and had eſtabliſhed a manner, which was univerſally adopted and imitated by his ingenious countrymen. In the mean time, the courts both of France and England were diſtinguiſhed for their elegance. Francis the firſt had changed the ſtate of letters in France, by mixing gallantry with learning, and by admitting the ladies to his court in company with the eccleſiaſtics <note n="a" place="bottom">See ſupr. vol. ii. p. 414.</note>. His carouſals were celebrated with a brilliancy and a feſtivity unknown to the ceremonious ſhews of former princes. Henry the eighth vied with Francis in theſe gaieties. His ambition, which could not bear a rival even in diverſions,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0373600103:106"/>
was ſeconded by liberality of diſpoſition and a love of oſtentation. For Henry, with many boiſterous qualities was magnificent and affable. Had he never murthered his wives, his politeneſs to the fair ſex would remain unimpeached. His martial ſports were unincumbered by the barbaric pomp of the antient chivalry, and ſoftened by the growing habits of more rational manners. He was attached to thoſe ſpectacles and public amuſements, in which beauty aſſumed a principal ſhare; and his frequent maſques and tournaments encouraged a high ſpirit of romantic courteſy. Poetry was the natural accompaniment of theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finements. Henry himſelf was a leader and a chief character in theſe pageantries, and at the ſame time a reader and a writer of verſes. The language and the manners of Italy were eſteemed and ſtudied. The ſonnets of Petrarch were the great models of compoſition. They entered into the genius of the faſhionable manners: and in a court of ſuch a complexion, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trach of courſe became the popular poet. Henry Howard earl Surrey, with a miſtreſs perhaps as beautiful as Laura, and at leaſt with Petrarch's paſſion if not his taſte, led the way to great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements in Engliſh poetry, by a happy imitation of Petrarch, and other Italian poets, who had been moſt ſucceſsful in paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the anxieties of love with pathos and propriety.</p>
            <p>Lord Surrey's life throws ſo much light on the character and ſubjects of his poetry, that it is almoſt impoſſible to conſider the one, without exhibiting a few anecdotes of the other. He was the ſon and grandſon of two lords treaſurers dukes of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk; and in his early childhood diſcovered the moſt promiſing marks of lively parts and an active mind.</p>
            <p>While a boy, he was habituated to the modes of a court at Windſor-caſtle; where he reſided, yet under the care of proper inſtructors, in the quality of a companion to Henry Fitzroy, duke of Richmond, a natural ſon of king Henry the eighth, and of the higheſt expectations.</p>
            <p>This young nobleman, who alſo bore other titles and honours, was the child of Henry's affection: not ſo much on account of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0373600103:107"/>
hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> hopeful abilities, as for a reaſon inſinuated by lord Herbert, and at which thoſe who know Henry's hiſtory and character will not be ſurpriſed, becauſe he equally and ſtrongly reſembled both his father and mother.</p>
            <p>A friendſhip of the cloſeſt kind commencing between theſe two illuſtrious youths, about the year 1530, they were both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to cardinal Wolſey's college at Oxford, then univerſally frequented, as well for the excellence as the novelty of its inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; for it was one of the firſt ſeminaries of an Engliſh uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, that profeſſed to explode the pedantries of the old bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous philoſophy, and to cultivate the graces of polite litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Two years afterwards, for the purpoſe of acquiring every accompliſhment of an elegant education, the earl accompanied his noble friend and fellow-pupil into France, where they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived king Henry, on his arrival at Calais to viſit Francis the firſt, with a moſt magnificent retinue. The frienſhip of theſe two young noblemen was ſoon ſtrengthened by a new tie; for Richmond married the lady Mary Howard, Surrey's ſiſter. Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, however, appears to have died in the year 1536, about the age of ſeventeen, having never cohabited with his wife <note n="b" place="bottom">Wood, ATH.

It was long, before Surrey forgot the untimely loſs of this amiable youth, the friend and aſſociate of his childhood, and who nearly reſembled himſelf in genius, refinement of manners, and liberal acquiſitions.</p>

               </gap> more unintelligible by falſe conjectures. I readily adopt Mr. Walpole's key to the genealogy of the matchleſs Geraldine <note n="e" place="bottom">CATAL. Roy. and Noble Authors, vol. i. p. 105. edit. 1759.</note>.</p>
            <p>Her poetical appellation is almoſt her real name. Gerald Fitzgerald, abovementioned, earl of Kildare in the reign of Henry the eighth, married a ſecond wife, Margaret daughter of Thomas Gray, marquis of Dorſet: by whom he had three daughters, Margaret, Eliſabeth, and Cicely. Margaret was born deaf and dumb; and a lady who could neither hear nor anſwer her lover, and who wanted the means of contributing to the moſt endearing reciprocations, can hardly be ſuppoſed to have
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0373600103:109"/>
been the cauſe of any vehement effuſions of amorous panegyric. We may therefore ſafely pronounce Eliſabeth or Cicely to have been Surrey's favorite. It was probably Eliſabeth, as ſhe ſeems always to have lived in England.</p>
            <p>Every circumſtance of the ſonnet evidently coincides with this ſtate of the caſe. But, to begin with the firſt line, it will naturally be aſked, what was lady Eliſabeth Gerald's connection with Tuſcany? The beginnings of noble families, like thoſe of nations, often owe ſomewhat to fictitious embelliſhment: and our genealogiſts uniformly aſſert, that the family of Fitzgerald derives its origin from Otho, a deſcendant of the dukes of Tuſcany: that they migrated into England under the reign of king Alfred, whoſe annals are luckily too ſcanty to contradict ſuch an account, and were from England ſpeedily tranſplanted into Ireland. Her father was an Iriſh earl, reſident at his earl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Kildare; and ſhe was conſequently born and nurſed in Ireland. Her mother, adds the ſonnet, was of princely paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Here is a no leſs exact correſpondence with the line of the lady's pedigree: for Thomas, marquis of Dorſet, was ſon of queen Eliſabeth Gray, daughter of the ducheſs of Bedford, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from the royal houſe of Luxemburgh. The poet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints us, that he firſt ſaw her at Hunſdon. This notice, which ſeems of an indifferent nature and quite extraneous to the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, abundantly corroborates our conjecture. Hundſdon-houſe in Hertfordſhire was a new palace built by Henry the eighth, and chiefly for the purpoſe of educating his children. The lady Eliſabeth Fitzgerald was ſecond couſin to Henry's daughters the princeſſes Mary and Eliſabeth, who were both educated at Hunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don <note n="f" place="bottom">Strype, ECCL. MEM. vol. i. APPEND. Numb. 71.</note>. At this royal nurſery ſhe therefore <hi>taſted of coſtly foode with kinges childe,</hi> that is, lived while a girl with the young princeſſes her relations, as a companion in their education. At the ſame time, and on the ſame plan, our earl of Surrey reſided at Windſor-caſtle, as I have already remarked, with the young
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0373600103:110"/>
duke of Richmond. It is natural to ſuppoſe, that he ſometimes viſited the princeſſes at Hunſdon, in company with the young duke their brother, where he muſt have alſo ſeen the fair Geral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine: yet by the nature of his ſituation at Windſor, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied a degree of confinement, he was hindered from viſiting her at Hunſdon ſo often as he wiſhed. He therefore pathetically laments,
<q>
                  <l>Windſor, alas, doth chaſe me from her ſight!</l>
               </q>
But although the earl firſt beheld this lady at the palace of Hunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, yet, as we further learn from the ſonnet, he was firſt ſtruck with her incomparable beauty, and his paſſion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced, at Hampton-court.
<q>
                  <l>Hampton me taught to wiſh her firſt for mine!</l>
               </q>
That is, and perhaps on occaſion of ſome ſplendid maſque or carou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, when the lady Eliſabeth Fitzgerald, with the princeſſes Mary and Eliſabeth, and their brother Richmond, with the young lord Surrey, were invited by the king to Hampton-court.</p>
            <p>In the mean time we muſt remember, that the lord Leonard Gray, uncle to lord Gerald Fitzgerald, was deputy of Ireland for the young duke of Richmond: a connection, excluſive of all that has been ſaid, which would alone account for Surrey's acquaintance at leaſt with this lady. It is alſo a reaſon, to ſay no more, why the earl ſhould have regarded her from the firſt with a particular attention, which afterwards grew into the moſt paſſionate attachment. She is ſuppoſed to have been Maid of honour to queen Catharine. But there are three of Henry's queens of that name. For obvious reaſons, however, we may venture to ſay, that queen Catharine Howard was Geraldine's queen.</p>
            <p>It is not preciſely known at what period the earl of Surrey began his travels. They have the air of a romance. He made the tour of Europe in the true ſpirit of chivalry, and with the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0373600103:111"/>
ideas of an Amadis; proclaiming the unparalleled charms of his miſtreſs, and prepared to defend the cauſe of her beauty with the weapons of knight-errantry. Nor was this adventurous journey performed without the intervention of an enchanter. The firſt city in Italy which he propoſed to viſit was Florence, the capital of Tuſcany, and the original ſeat of the anceſtors of his Geraldine. In his way thither, he paſſed a few days at the emperor's court; where he became acquainted with Cornelius Agrippa, a celebrated adept in natural magic. This viſionary philoſopher ſhewed our hero, in a mirror of glaſs, a living image of Geraldine, reclining on a couch, ſick, and reading one of his moſt tender ſonnets by a waxen taper <note n="g" place="bottom">Drayton, HER. EPIST.—HOWARD to GERALDINE, v. 57.</note>. His imagination, which wanted not the flattering repreſentations and artificial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centives of illuſion, was heated anew by this intereſting and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting ſpectacle. Inflamed with every enthuſiaſm of the moſt romantic paſſion, he haſtened to Florence: and, on his arrival, immediately publiſhed a defiance againſt any perſon who could handle a lance and was in love, whether Chriſtian, Jew, Turk, Saracen, or Canibal, who ſhould preſume to diſpute the ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Geraldine's beauty. As the lady was pretended to be of Tuſcan extraction, the pride of the Florentines was flattered on this occaſion: and the grand duke of Tuſcany permitted a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and unmoleſted ingreſs into his dominions of the comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of all countries, till this important trial ſhould be decided. The challenge was accepted, and the earl victorious <note n="h" place="bottom">Wood, ubi ſupr.</note>.

            <p>Theſe heroic vanities did not, however, ſo totally engroſs the time which Surrey ſpent in Italy, as to alienate his mind from letters: he ſtudied with the greateſt ſucceſs a critical knowledge
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0373600103:112"/>
of the Italian tongue, and, that he might give new luſtre to the name of Geraldine, attained a juſt taſte for the peculiar graces of the Italian poetry.</p>
            <p>He was recalled to England for ſome idle reaſon by the king, much ſooner than he expected: and he returned home, the moſt elegant traveller, the moſt polite lover, the moſt learned nobleman, and the moſt accompliſhed gentleman, of his age. Dexterity in tilting, and gracefulneſs in managing a horſe under arms, were excellencies now viewed with a critical eye, and practiſed with a high degree of emulation. In 1540, at a tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament held in the preſence of the court at Weſtminſter, and in which the principal of the nobility were engaged, Surrey was diſtinguiſhed above the reſt for his addreſs in the uſe and exerciſe of arms. But his martial ſkill was not ſolely diſplayed in the parade and oſtentation of theſe domeſtic combats. In 1542, he marched into Scotland, as a chief commander in his father's army; and was conſpicuous for his conduct and bravery at the memorable battle of Flodden-field, where James the fourth of Scotland was killed. The next year, we find the career of his victories impeded by an obſtacle which no valour could reſiſt. The cenſures of the church have humiliated the greateſt heroes: and he was impriſoned in Windſor-caſtle for eating fleſh in Lent. The prohibition had been renewed or ſtrengthened by a recent proclamation of the king. I mention this circumſtance<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In 1544, he was field-marſhal of the Engliſh army in the expedition to Bologne, which he took. In that age, love and arms conſtantly went together: and it was amid the fatigues of this protracted cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign, that he compoſed his laſt ſonnet called the FANSIE of a <hi>wearied Lover</hi>

But as Surrey's popularity encreaſed, his intereſt declined with the king; whoſe caprices and jealouſies grew more violent with his years and infirmities. The brilliancy of Surrey's character, his celebrity in the military ſcience, his general abilities, his wit, learning, and affability, were viewed by Henry with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt and ſuſpicion. It was in vain that he poſſeſſed every advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous qualification, which could adorn the ſcholar, the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, and the ſoldier. In proportion as he was amiable in the eyes of the people, he became formidable to the king. His riſing reputation was miſconſtrued into a dangerous ambition, and gave birth to accuſations equally groundleſs and frivolous<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> He was ſuſpected of a deſign to marry the princeſs Mary; and, by that alliance, of approaching to a poſſibility of wearing the crown. It was inſinuated, that he converſed with foreigners, and held a correſpondence with cardinal Pole.</p>
            <p>The addition of the eſcocheon of Edward the Confeſſor to his own, although uſed by the family of Norfolk for many years, and juſtified by the authority of the heralds, was a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient foundation for an impeachment of high treaſon. Theſe motives were privately aggravated by thoſe prejudices, with which Henry remembered the miſbehaviour of Catharine Howard, and which were extended to all that lady's relations. At length, the earl of Surrey fell a ſacrifice to the peeviſh injuſtice of a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and ungrateful maſter. Notwithſtanding his eloquent and maſculine defence, which even in the cauſe of guilt itſelf would have proved a powerful perſuaſive, he was condemned by the prepared ſuffrage of a ſervile and obſequious jury, and beheaded on Tower-hill in the year 1547 <note n="m" place="bottom">See Stowe, CHRON<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In the affair of Bologne he had made a falſe ſtep. This had offended the king. But Henry, when once offended, could never forgive. And when Hertford was ſent into France to take the command, he could not refrain from
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0373600103:114"/>
dropping ſome reproachful expreſſions againſt a meaſure which ſeemed to impeach his perſonal courage. Conſcious of his high birth and capacity, he was above the little attentions of caution and reſerve; and he too frequently neglected to conſult his own ſituation, and the king's temper. It was his misfortune to ſerve a monarch, whoſe reſentments, which were eaſily provoked, could only be ſatisfied by the moſt ſevere revenge. Henry brought thoſe men to the block, which other monarchs would have only diſgraced.</p>
            <p>Among theſe anecdotes of Surrey's life, I had almoſt forgot to mention what became of his amour with the fair Geraldine. We lament to find, that Surrey's devotion to this lady did not end in a wedding, and that all his gallantries and verſes availed ſo little! No memoirs of that incurious age have informed us, whether her beauty was equalled by her cruelty; or whether her ambition prevailed ſo far over her gratitude, as to tempt her to prefer the ſolid glories of a more ſplendid title and ample for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, to the challenges and the compliments, of ſo magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, ſo faithful, and ſo eloquent a lover. She appears, however, to have been afterwards the third wife of Edward Clinton, earl of Lincoln. Such alſo is the power of time and accident over amorous vows, that even Surrey himſelf outlived the violence of his paſſion. He married Frances, daughter of John earl of Oxford, by whom he left ſeveral children. One of his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Jane counteſs of Weſtmoreland, was among the learned ladies of that age, and became famous for her knowledge of the Greek and Latin languages <note n="n" place="bottom">Dugd.

            <p>Surrey's poems were in high reputation with his cotempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and for many years afterwards.

Surrey is ſaid, by the ingenious author of the MUSES LIBRARY, to have been the firſt who broke through the faſhion of ſtanzas, and wrote in the heroic couplet. But all Surrey's poems are in the alternate rhyme; nor, had this been true, is the other poſition to be granted. Chaucer's Prologues and moſt of the Canterbury Tales are written in long verſe: nor was the uſe of the couplet reſumed, till late in the reign of Eliſabeth.</p>
            <p>In the ſonnets of Surrey, we are ſurpriſed to find nothing of that metaphyſical caſt which marks the Italian poets, his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed maſters, eſpecially Petrarch. Surrey's ſentiments are for the moſt part natural and unaffected; ariſing from his own feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and dictated by the preſent circumſtances. His poetry is alike unembarraſſed by learned alluſions, or elaborate conceits. If our author copies Petrarch, it is Petrarch's better manner: when he deſcends from his Platonic abſtractions, his refinements of paſſion, his exaggerated compliments, and his play upon oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite ſentiments, into a track of tenderneſs, ſimplicity, and nature.

            <p>In the poet's ſituation, nothing can be more natural and ſtriking than the reflection with which he opens his complaint. There is alſo much beauty in the abruptneſs of his exordial exclamation. The ſuperb palace, where he had paſſed the moſt pleaſing days of his youth with the ſon of a king, was now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into a tedious and ſolitary priſon! This unexpected viciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitude of fortune awakens a new and intereſting train of thought. The compariſon of his paſt and preſent circumſtances recals their juvenile ſports and amuſements; which were more to be regretted, as young Richmond was now dead. Having deſcribed ſome of theſe with great elegance, he recurs to his firſt idea by a beautiful apoſtrophe. He appeals to the place of his confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, once the ſource of his higheſt pleaſures: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"O place of bliſs, renewer of my woe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

inhabitant! Echo alone either pities or anſwers my queſtion, and returns a plaintive hollow ſound!"</q> He cloſes his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint with an affecting and pathetic ſentiment, much in the ſtyle of Petrarch. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"To baniſh the miſeries of my preſent diſtreſs, I am forced on the wretched expedient of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering a greater!"</q> This is the conſolation of a warm fancy.

            <p>Some of the following ſtanzas, on a lover who preſumed to compare his lady with the divine Geraldine, have almoſt the eaſe and gallantry of Waller. The leading compliment, which has been uſed by later writers, is in the ſpirit of an Italian fiction. It is very ingenious, and handled with a high degree of elegance.</p>

            <p>But Surrey was not merely the poet of idleneſs and gallantry. He was fitted both from nature and ſtudy, for the more ſolid and laborious parts of literature.

            <p>This is the firſt compoſition in blank verſe, extant in the Engliſh language. Nor has it merely the relative and accidental merit of being a curioſity. It is executed with great fidelity, yet not with a proſaic ſervility. The diction is often poetical, and the verſification varied with proper pauſes.

            <p>This was a noble attempt to break the bondage of rhyme. But blank verſe was now growing faſhionable in the Italian poetry, the ſchool of Surrey. Felice Figlinei, a Saneſe, and Surrey's cotemporary, in his admirable Italian commentary on the ETHICS of Ariſtotle, entitled FILOSOSIA MORALE SOPRA IL LIBRI D' ETHICA D'ARISTOTILE, declaims againſt the barbarity of rhyme, and ſtrongly recommends a total rejection of this Gothic ornament to his countrymen. He enforces his precept by his own example; and tranſlates all Ariſtotle's quotations from Homer and Euripides into verſe without rhyme.

            <p>The revival of the Greek and Roman poets in Italy, excited all the learned men of that country to copy the Roman verſifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and conſequently baniſhed the old Leonine Latin verſe. The ſame claſſical idea operated in ſome degree on the vernacular poetry of Italy. In the year 1528, Triſſino publiſhed his ITA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIA LIBERATA DI GOTI, or, ITALY DELIVERED FROM THE GOTHS, an heroic poem, profeſſedly written in imitation of the Iliad, without either rhyme, or the uſual machineries of the Gothic romance. Triſſino's deſign was to deſtroy the TERZA RIMA of Dante. We do not, however, find, whether it be from the facility with which the Italian tongue falls into rhyme, or that the beſt and eſtabliſhed Italian poets wrote in the ſtanza, that theſe efforts to reſtore blank-verſe, produced any laſting effects in the progreſs of the Italian poetry. It is very probable, that this ſpecimen of the Eneid in blank-verſe by Surrey, led the way to Abraham Fleming's blank-verſe tranſlation of Virgil's Bucolics and Georgics, although done in Alexandrines, publiſhed in the year 1589 <note n="y" place="bottom">London, 4to.</note>.</p>
            <p>Lord Surrey wrote many other Engliſh poems which were never
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0373600103:130"/>
publiſhed, and are now perhaps entirely loſt. He tranſlated the ECCLESIASTES of Solomon into Engliſh verſe. This piece is cited in the Preface to the Tranſlation of the Pſalms, printed at London in 1567. He alſo tranſlated a few of the Pſalms into metre. Theſe verſions of Scripture ſhew that he was a friend to the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. Among his works are alſo recited, a Poem on his friend the young duke of Richmond, an Exhortation to the citizens of London, a Tranſlation of Boccace's Epiſtle to Pinus, and a ſett of Latin epiſtles. Aubrey has preſerved a poetical Epitaph, written by Surrey on ſir Thomas Clere, his faithful retainer and conſtant attendant, which was once in Lambeth-church <note n="y" place="bottom">See Aubrey's SURREY, V. 247.</note>; and which, for its affection and elegance, deſerves to be printed among the earl's poems.

            <p>WITH Surrey's Poems, Tottel has joined, in his editions of 1557 and 1565, the SONGES and SONNETTES of ſir Thomas Wyat the elder <note n="a" place="bottom">Wyat's begin at fol. 19.</note>, and of Uncertain Auctours.</p>
            <p>Wyat was of Allington-caſtle in Kent, which he magnificently repaired, and educated in both our univerſities. But his chief and moſt ſplendid accompliſhments were derived from his travels into various parts of Europe, which he frequently viſited in the quality of an envoy. He was endeared to king Henry the eighth, who did not always act from caprice, for his fidelity and ſucceſs in the execution of public buſineſs, his ſkill in arms, literature, familiarity with languages, and lively converſation. Wood, who degrades every thing by poverty of ſtyle and improper repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, ſays, that <q rend="inline margQuotes">"the king was in a high manner delighted with his <hi>witty jeſts</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="bottom">ATH. OXON. i. 51.</note>."</q> It is not perhaps improbable, that Henry was as much pleaſed with his repartees as his politics. He is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to have occaſioned the reformation by a joke, and to have planned the fall of cardinal Wolſey by a ſeaſonable ſtory <note n="c" place="bottom">S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But he had almoſt loſt his popularity, either from an intimacy with queen Anne Boleyn, which was called a connection, or the gloomy cabals of biſhop Bonner, who could not bear his poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical ſuperiority. Yet his prudence and integrity, no leſs than the powers of his oratory, juſtified his innocence. He laments his ſevere and unjuſt impriſonment on that trying occaſion, in a ſonnet addreſſed to ſir Francis Bryan: inſinuating his ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, that although the wound would be healed, the ſcar would

remain, and that to be acquitted of the accuſation would avail but little, while the thoughts of having been accuſed were ſtill freſh in remembrance <note n="d" place="bottom">Fol. 44.</note>. It is a common miſtake, that he died abroad of the plague in an embaſſy to Charles the fifth. Being ſent to conduct that emperor's embaſſador from Falmouth to London, from too eager and a needleſs deſire of executing his commiſſion with diſpatch and punctuality, he caught a fever by riding in a hot day, and in his return died on the road at Shir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn, where he was buried in the great conventual church, in the year 1541. The next year, Leland publiſhed a book of Latin verſes on his death, with a wooden print of his head pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed, probably done by Holbein <note n="e" place="bottom">NAEN<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>We muſt agree with a critic above quoted, that Wyat co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operated with Surry, in having corrected the roughneſs of our poetic ſtyle. But Wyat, although ſufficiently diſtinguiſhed from the common verſifiers of his age, is confeſſedly inferior to Surrey in harmony of numbers, perſpicuity of expreſſion, and facility of phraſeology. Nor is he equal to Surrey in elegance of ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent, in nature and ſenſibility. His feelings are diſguiſed by affectation, and obſcured by conceit. His declarations of paſſion are embarraſſed by wit and fancy; and his ſtyle is not intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible, in proportion as it is careleſs and unadorned. His compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, like the modes of behaviour in that age, are ceremonious and ſtrained. He has too much art as a lover, and too little as a poet. His gallantries are laboured, and his verſification negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. The truth is, his genius was of the moral and didactic ſpecies: and his poems abound more in good ſenſe, ſatire, and obſervations on life, than in pathos or imagination. Yet there

            <p>It was from the capricious and over-ſtrained invention of the Italian poets, that Wyat was taught to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>orture the paſſion of love by prolix and intricate compariſons, and unnatural alluſions. At one time his love is a galley ſteered by cruelty through ſtormy ſeas and dangerous rocks; the ſails torn by the blaſt of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous ſighs, and the cordage conſumed by inceſſant ſhowers of tears: a cloud of grief envelopes the ſtars<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In another of his ſonnets, he ſays, that all nature ſympathiſes with his paſſion. The woods reſound his elegies, the rivers ſtop their courſe to hear him complain, and the graſs weeps in dew. Theſe thoughts are common and fantaſtic. But he adds an image which is new, and has much nature and ſentiment, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not well expreſſed.

But ſuch paſſages as theſe are not the general characteriſtics of Wyat's poetry. They ſtrike us but ſeldom, amidſt an impracticable
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0373600103:138"/>
maſs of forced reflections, hyperbolical metaphors, and complaints that move no compaſſion.</p>
            <p>But Wyat appears a much more pleaſing writer, when he moraliſes on the felicities of retirement, and attacks the vanities and vices of a court, with the honeſt indignation of an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent philoſopher, and the freedom and pleaſantry of Horace. Three of his poetical epiſtles are profeſſedly written in this ſtrain, two to John Poines <note n="v" place="bottom">He ſeems to have been a perſon about the court. See LIFE of Sir Thomas Pope, p. 46.</note>, and the other to ſir Francis Bryan: and we muſt regret, that he has not left more pieces in a ſtyle of compoſition for which he ſeems to have been eminently qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified.

Sir Francis Bryan was the friend of Wyat, as we have ſeen; and ſerved as a commander under Thomas earl of Surrey in an expedition into Brittany, by whom he was knighted for his bravery <note n="c" place="bottom">Dugd. BAR. ii. 273. a.</note>. Hence he probably became connected with lord Surrey the poet. But Bryan was one of the brilliant ornaments of the court of king Henry the eighth, which at leaſt affected to be polite: and from his popular accompliſhments as a wit and a poet, he was made a gentleman of the privy-chamber to that monarch, who loved to be entertained by his domeſtics <note n="d" place="bottom">Rymer, FO<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>D. xiv. 380.</note>. Yet he enjoyed much more important appointments in that reign, and in the firſt year of Edward the ſixth; and died chief juſticiary of Ireland, at Waterford, in the year 1548 <note n="e" place="bottom">Hollinſh. CHRON. i. 61. And Ibid. Hooker's CONTIN. tom. ii. P. ii. pag. 110. See alſo FOX, MARTYR. p. 991.</note>. On the principle of an unbiaſſed attachment to the king, he wrote epiſtles on Henry's divorce, never publiſhed; and tranſlated into Engliſh from the French, Antonio de Guevara's Spaniſh Diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation on the life of a courtier, printed at London in the year laſt mentioned <note n="f" place="bottom">Cod. Impreſſ. A. Wood, Muſ. Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mol. Oxon.</note>. He was nephew to John Bourchier, lord Berners, the tranſlator of Froiſſart; who, at his deſire, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated at Calais from French into Engliſh, the GOLDEN BOKE, or Life of Marcus Aurelius, about 1533 <note n="g" place="bottom">See the COLOPHON. It was printed by Thomas Berthelett, in 1536, quarto. Often afterwards. Lord Berners was, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty-general of Calais, and its Marches.</note>. Which are Bryan's pieces I cannot aſcertain.</p>
            <p>George Boleyn, viſcount Rochford, was ſon of ſir Thomas Boleyn, afterwards earl of Wiltſhire and Ormond; and at Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford diſcovered an early propenſity to polite letters and poetry. He was appointed to ſeveral dignities and offices by king Henry the eighth, and ſubſcribed the famous declaration ſent to Pope Clement the ſeventh. He was brother to queen Anne Boleyn, with whom he was ſuſpected of a criminal familiarity. The chief accuſation againſt him ſeems to have been, that he was ſeen to whiſper with the queen one morning while ſhe was in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0373600103:147"/>
bed. As he had been raiſed by the exaltation, he was involved in the misfortunes of that injured princeſs, who had no other fault but an un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uarded and indiſcrete frankneſs of nature; and whoſe character has been blackened by the bigotted hiſtorians of the catholic cauſe, merely becauſe ſhe was the mother of queen Eliſabeth. To gratify the oſtenſible jealouſy of the king, who had conceived a violent paſſion for a new object, this amiable nobleman was beheaded on the firſt of May, in 1536 <note n="h" place="bottom">See Dugd. BARON. iii. p. 306. a.</note>. His elegance of perſon, and ſpritely converſation, captivated all the ladies of Henry's court. Wood ſays, that at the <q rend="inline margQuotes">"royal court he was much <hi>adored,</hi> eſpecially by the <hi>female ſex,</hi> for his <hi>admirable</hi> diſcourſe, and <hi>ſymmetry</hi> of body <note n="i" place="bottom">Ath. Oxon. i. 44.</note>."</q> From theſe irreſiſtible allurements his enemies endeavoured to give a plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to their infamous charge of an inceſtuous connection. After his commitment to the Tower, his ſiſter the queen, on being ſent to the ſame place, aſked the lieutenant, with a degree of eagerneſs, <q rend="inline">"Oh! where is my ſweet brother <note n="k" place="bottom">Strype, MEM. i. p. 280.</note>?"</q> Here was a ſpecious confirmation of his imagined guilt: this ſtroke of natural tenderneſs was too readily interpreted into a licentious attachment. Bale mentions his RHYTHMI ELEGANTISSIMI <note n="l" place="bottom">ii. 103.</note>, which Wood calls, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Songs and Sonnets, with other things of the like nature <note n="m" place="bottom">Ubi ſupr.</note>."</q> Theſe are now loſt, unleſs ſome, as I have inſinuated, are contained in the preſent collection; a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, in which it appears to have been the faſhion for every FLOWERY COURTIER to leave ſome of his bloſſoms. But Boleyn's poems cannot now be diſtinguiſhed.</p>
            <p>The lord Vaulx, whom I have ſuppoſed, and on ſurer proof, to be another contributor to this miſcellany, could not be the Nicholas lord Vaux, whoſe gown of purple velvet, plated with gold, eclipſed all the company preſent at the marriage of prince Arthur; who ſhines as a ſtateſman and a ſoldier with uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon luſtre in the hiſtory of Henry the ſeventh, and continued
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0373600103:148"/>
to adorn the earlier annals of his ſucceſſor, and who died in the year 1523. Lord Vaux the poet, was probably Thomas lord Vaux, the ſon of Nicholas, and who was ſummoned to parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in 1531, and ſeems to have lived till the latter end of the reign of queen Mary <note n="n" place="bottom">See what I have ſaid of his ſon lord William, in the LIFE OF SIR THOMAS POPE, p. 221. In 1558, ſir Tho. Pope leaves him a legacy of one hundred pounds, by the name of lord Vaulx.</note>. All our old writers mention the poetical lord Vaux, as rather poſterior to Wyat and Surrey; neither of whom was known as a writer till many years after the death of lord Nicholas. George Gaſcoyne, who wrote in 1575, in his panegyric on the ENGLISH POETS, places Vaux after Surrey.</p>

            <p>Puttenham, author of the ARTE OF ENGLISH POESIE, having ſpoken of Surrey and Wyat, immediately adds, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"In the SAME TIME, or NOT LONG AFTER, was the lord Nicholas<note n="o" place="bottom">The chriſtian name is a miſtake, into which it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Great numbers of Vaux's poems are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in the PARADISE OF DAINTY DEVISES; and, inſtead of the rudeneſs of Skelton, they have a ſmoothneſs and facility of manner, which does not belong to poetry written before the year 1523, in which lord Nicholas Vaux died an old man <note n="q" place="bottom">See Percy's BALL. ii. 49. edit. 1775.</note>. The PARADISE OF DAINTY DEVISES was publiſhed in 1578, and he is there ſimply ſtyled <hi>Lord Vaulx the elder:</hi> this was to diſtinguiſh him from his ſon lord William, then living.

teſtimony of Wood, who ſays, that Nicholas, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"in his juvenile years was ſent to Oxon, where by reading humane and ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic, rather than philoſophical authors, he advanced his genius very much in poetry and hiſtory <note n="r" place="bottom">ATH.

But ſuch was the celebrity of lord Nicholas's public and political character, that he has been made to monopoliſe every merit which was the property of his ſucceſſors. All theſe difficulties, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, are at once adjuſted by a manuſcript in the Britiſh Muſeum: in which we have a copy of Vaux's poem, beginning <hi>I lothe that I did love,</hi> with this title: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"A dyttye or ſonet made by the lord Vaus, in the time of the noble quene Marye, repreſenting the image of Death <note n="s" place="bottom">MSS.

Another of lord Vaux's poems in the volume before us, is the ASSAULT OF CUPIDE UPON THE FORT IN WHICH THE LOVER'S HEART LAY WOUNDED <note n="x" place="bottom">Fol. 71.</note>. Theſe two are the only pieces in our col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, of which there is undoubted evidence, although no name is prefixed to either, that they were written by lord Vaux.

            <p>Theſe three writers were cotemporaries with Surrey and Wyat: but the ſubjects of ſome of the pieces will go far in aſcertaining the date of the collection in general. There is one on the death

            <p>Theſe reflections, reſulting from a retroſpect of the vigorous and active part of life, deſtined for nobler purſuits, and unworthily waſted in the tedious and fruitleſs anxieties of unſucceſsful love, are highly natural, and are painted from the heart: but their force is weakened by the poet's alluſions.</p>

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0373600103:160"/>
was one of the beſt jokers of that age: and there is ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, that this might have fallen from his pen. It is on a ſcholar, who was purſuing his ſtudies ſucceſsfully, but in the midſt of his literary career, married unfortunately.</p>

            <p>Theſe two lines are ſaid to have been written by Mary queen of Scots with a diamond on a window in Fotheringay caſtle, during her impriſonment there, and to have been of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.

But they belong to an elegant little ode of ten ſtanzas in the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection before us, in which a lover complains that he is caught by the ſnare which he once defied <note n="x" place="bottom">Fol. 53.</note>. The unfortunate queen only quoted a diſtich applicable to her ſituation, which ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered in a faſhionable ſett of poems, perhaps the amuſement of her youth.</p>
            <p>The ode, which is the compariſon of the author's <hi>faithful and painful</hi> paſſion with that of Troilus <note n="y" place="bottom">Fol. 81.</note>, is founded on Chaucer's
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0373600103:161"/>
poem, or Boccace's, on the ſame ſubject. This was the moſt favorite love-ſtory of our old poetry, and from its popularity was wrought into a drama by Shakeſpeare. Troilus's ſufferings for Creſſida were a common topic for a lover's fidelity and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duity. Shakeſpeare, in his MERCHANT OF VENICE, compares a night favorable to the ſtratagems or the meditation of a lover, to ſuch a night as Troilus might have choſen, for ſtealing a view of the Grecian camp from the ramparts of Troy.</p>
            <q>
               <l>And ſigh'd his ſoul towards the Grecian tents</l>

            <p>Among theſe poems is a ſhort fragment of a tranſlation into Alexandrines of Ovid's epiſtle from Penelope to Ulyſſes <note n="a" place="bottom">Fol. 89.</note>. This is the firſt attempt at a metrical tranſlation of any part of Ovid into Engliſh, for Caxton's Ovid is a looſe paraphraſe in proſe. Nor were the heroic epiſtles of Ovid tranſlated into verſe till the year 1582, by George Tuberville. It is a proof that the claſſics were ſtudied, when they began to be tranſlated.</p>
            <p>It would be tedious and intricate to trace the particular imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Italian poets, with which theſe anonymous poems abound. Two of the ſonnets<note n="b" place="bottom">Fol. 74.</note> are panegyrics on Petrarch and Laura, names at that time familiar to every polite reader, and the patterns of poetry and beauty. The ſonnet on <hi>The diverſe and contrarie paſſions of the lover</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="bottom">Fol. 107.</note>, is formed on one of Petrarch's ſonnets, and which, as I have remarked before, was tranſlated by ſir Thomas Wyat <note n="d" place="bottom">Supr. p. 31.</note>. So many of the nobility, and principal perſons about the court, writing ſonnets in the Italian ſtyle, is a circumſtance which muſt have greatly contributed to circulate this mode of compoſition, and to encourage the ſtudy of the Italian poets. Beſide lord Surrey, ſir Thomas Wyat, lord Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyn, lord Vaux, and ſir Francis Bryan, already mentioned, Ed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

lord Sheffield, created a baron by king Edward the ſixth, and killed by a butcher in the Norfolk inſurrection, is ſaid by Bale to have written ſonnets in the Italian manner <note n="e" place="bottom">See Tanner BIBL. p. 668. Dugd. BAR. iii. 386.</note>.</p>
            <p>I have been informed, that Henry lord Berners tranſlated ſome of Petrarch's ſonnets <note n="f" place="bottom">MSS. Oldys.</note>. But this nobleman otherwiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved notice here, for his proſe works, which co-operated with the romantic genius and the gallantry of the age. He tranſlated, and by the king's command, Froiſſart's chronicle, which was printed by Pinſon in 1523. Some of his other tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations are profeſſed romances. He tranſlated from the Spaniſh, by deſire of the lady of ſir Nicholas Carew, THE CASTLE OF LOVE. From the French he tranſlated, at the requeſt of the earl of Huntingdon, SIR HUGH OF BOURDEAUX, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came exceedingly popular. And from the ſame language, THE HISTORY OF ARTHUR an Armorican knight. Bale ſays <note n="g" place="bottom">Cent. ix. p. 706.</note>, that he wrote a comedy called <hi>Ite in vineam,</hi> or the PARABLE OF THE VINEYARD, which was frequently acted at Calais, where lord Berners reſided, after veſpers <note n="h" place="bottom">ATH. OXON. i. 33. It is not known, whether it was in Latin or Engliſh. Stowe ſays, that in 1528, at Greenwich, after a grand tournament and banquet, there was the <q rend="inline margQuotes">"moſt goodlieſt Diſguiſing or Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude in Latine, &amp;c."</q> CHRON. p. 539. edit. fol. 1615. But poſſibly this may be Stowe's way of naming and deſcribing a comedy of Plautus. See ſupr. vol. ii. 363.</note>. He died in 1532.</p>
            <p>I have alſo been told, that the late lord Eglintoun had a genuine book of manuſcript ſonnets, written by king Henry the eighth. There is an old madrigal, ſet to muſic by William Bird, ſuppoſed to be written by Henry, when he firſt fell in love with Anne Boleyn <note n="i" place="bottom">I muſt not forget, that a ſong is aſcribed to Anne Boleyn, but with little probability, called her COMPLAINT.

It appears in Bird's PSALMES, SONGS, AND SONNETS, printed with muſical notes, in 1611 <note n="k" place="bottom">See alſo NUGAE ANTIQUAE, ii. 248.</note>. Poetry and muſic are congenial; and it is certain, that Henry was ſkilled in muſical compoſition. Eraſmus atteſts, that he compoſed ſome church ſervices <note n="l" place="bottom">See Hawkins, HIST. MUS. ii. 533.</note>: and one of his anthems ſtill continues to be performed in the choir of Chriſt-church at Oxford, of his foundation. It is in an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable ſtyle, and is for four voices. Henry, although a ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, had little taſte for the claſſical elegancies which now began to be known in England. His education ſeems to have been altogether theological: and, whether it beſt ſuited his taſte or his intereſt, polemical divinity ſeems to have been his favorite ſcience. He was a patron of learned men, when they humoured his vanities; and were wiſe enough, not to interrupt his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, his convenience, or his ambition.</p>

He was a native of Huntingdonſhire, and received the firſt part of his academical inſtitution at Chriſt's college in Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge. Removing to Oxford in the year 1542, he was elected fellow of Merton College: but, about 1547, having opened a rhetorical lecture in the refectory of Chriſt-church, then newly founded, he was tranſplanted to that ſociety, which gave the greateſt encouragement to ſuch ſtudents as were diſtinguiſhed for their proficiency in criticiſm and philology. The ſame year, he wrote a Latin tragedy, which probably was acted in the college, entitled, ARCHIPROPHETA, <hi>

[See ſupr. vol. ii. 379.]</note>. In the year 1548 <note n="d" place="bottom">ii Edw. vi.</note>, he explained all the four books of Virgil's Georgics in a regular proſe Latin paraphraſe, in the public hall of his college <note n="e" place="bottom">Printed at London in 1591. 8vo.</note>. He wrote alſo explanatory commentaries or lectures on the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria of Terence, the Epiſtles of Horace, and many pieces of Cicero, perhaps for the ſame auditory. He tranſlated Tully's Offices into Engliſh. This tranſlation, which is dedicated to the learned Thirlby biſhop of Ely, was printed at London,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0373600103:165"/>
1553 <note n="f" place="bottom">In octavo. Again, 1574.—1596.</note>. He alſo familiariſed ſome of the pureſt Greek claſſics by Engliſh verſions, which I believe were never printed. Among others was the CYROPAEDIA. Bale the biographer and biſhop of Oſſory, ſays, that he turned Chaucer's TROILUS into a play: but whether this piece was in Latin or Engliſh, we are ſtill to ſeek: and the word <hi>Comedia,</hi> which Bale uſes on this occaſion, is without preciſion or diſtinction.

In the eccleſiaſtical hiſtory of Mary's reign, he appears to have been impriſoned for hereſy, and to have ſaved his life, if not his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, by a recantation. But theology does not ſeem to have been his talent, nor the glories of martyrdom to have made any part of his ambition. One of his plans, but which never took effect, was to print a new edition of Joſephus Iſcanus's poem on the TROJAN WAR, with emendations from the moſt correct manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts <note n="l" place="bottom">Bale, ubi ſupr.</note>.</p>

            <p>I have a ſuſpicion, that theſe two pieces in blank-verſe, if not fragments of larger works, were finiſhed in their preſent ſtate, as proluſions, or illuſtrative practical ſpecimens, for our author's courſe of lectures in rhetoric. In that caſe, they were written ſo early as the year 1547. There is poſitive proof, that they appeared not later than 1557, when they were firſt printed by Tottell.</p>
            <p>I have already mentioned lord Surrey's Virgil: and for the ſake of juxtapoſition, will here produce a third ſpecimen of early blank-verſe, little known. In the year 1590, William Vallans publiſhed a blank-verſe poem, entitled, A TALE OF TWO SWANNES, which, under a poetic fiction, deſcribes the ſituation and antiquities of ſeveral towns in Hertfordſhire. The author, a native or inhabitant of Hertfordſhire, ſeems to have been connected

with Camden and other ingenious antiquaries of his age. I cite the exordium.</p>

written for the ſtage. Long before Vallans's TWO SWANNES, many theatrical pieces in blank-verſe had appeared; the firſt of which is, The TRAGEDY OF GORDOBUCKE, written in 1561. The ſecond is George Gaſcoigne's JOCASTA, a tragedy, acted at Grays-inn, in 1566. George Peele had alſo publiſhed his tragedy in blank-verſe of DAVID and BETHSABE, about the year 1579 <note n="h" place="bottom">Shakeſpeare did not begin writing for the ſtage till 1591. Jonſon, about 1598.</note>. HIERONYMO, a tragedy alſo without rhyme, was acted before 1590. But this point, which is here only tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiently mentioned, will be more fully conſidered hereafter, in its proper place. We will now return to our author Grimoald.</p>
            <p>Grimoald, as a writer of verſes in rhyme, yields to none of his cotemporaries, for a maſterly choice of chaſte expreſſion, and the conciſe elegancies of didactic verſification. Some of the couplets, in his poem IN PRAISE OF MODERATION, have all the ſmartneſs which marks the modern ſtyle of ſententious poetry, and would have done honour to Pope's ethic epiſtles.</p>

            <p>It would be unpardonable to diſmiſs this valuable miſcellany, without acknowledging our obligations to its original editor Richard Tottell: who deſerves highly of Engliſh literature, for having collected at a critical period, and preſerved in a printed volume, ſo many admirable ſpecimens of antient genius, which would have mouldered in manuſcript, or perhaps from their detached and fugitive ſtate of exiſtence, their want of length, the capriciouſneſs of taſte, the general depredations of time, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attention, and other accidents, would never have reached the preſent age. It ſeems to have given birth to two favorite and celebrated collections of the ſame kind, THE PARADISE OF DAINTY DEVISES, and ENGLAND'S HELICON, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the reign of queen Eliſabeth <hi rend="sup">•</hi>. <note place="bottom">

            <p>IT will not be ſuppoſed, that all the poets of the reign of Henry the eighth were educated in the ſchool of Petrarch. The graces of the Italian muſe, which had been taught by Surrey and Wyat, were confined to a few. Nor were the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the claſſics yet become general objects of imitation. There are many writers of this period who ſtill rhymed on, in the old proſaic track of their immediate predeceſſors, and never ventured to deviate into the modern improvements. The ſtrain of romantic fiction was loſt; in the place of which, they did not ſubſtitute the elegancies newly introduced.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conſider together, yet without an exact obſervation of chronological order, the poets of the reign of Henry the eighth who form this ſubordinate claſs, and who do not bear any mark of the character of the poetry which diſtinguiſhes this period. Yet ſome of theſe have their degree of merit; and, if they had not neceſſarily claimed a place in our ſeries, deſerve examination.</p>
            <p>Andrew Borde, who writes himſelf ANDREAS PERFORATUS, with about as much propriety and as little pedantry as Bucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan calls one Wiſehart SOPHOCARDIUS, was educated at Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter and Oxford <note n="a" place="bottom">See his INTRODUCTION TO KNOW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEDGE, ut infr. cap. xxxv.</note>; and is ſaid, I believe on very ſlender proof, to have been phyſician to king Henry the eighth.

            <p>Of Borde's numerous books, the only one that can afford any degree of entertainment to the modern reader, is the DIE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TARIE OF HELTHE: where, giving directions as a phyſician, concerning the choice of houſes, diet, and apparel, and not ſuſpecting how little he ſhould inſtruct, and how much he might amuſe, a curious poſterity, he has preſerved many anecdotes of the private life, cuſtoms, and arts, of our anceſtors <note n="t" place="bottom">In his rules for building or planning a Houſe, he ſuppoſes a quadrangle.

being called in as a phyſician to ſir John Drury, the year when cardinal Wolſey was promoted to York; but that he did not chuſe to preſcribe without conſulting doctor Buttes, the king's phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian. He apologiſes to the duke, for not writing in the <hi>ornate</hi> phraſeology now generally affected. He alſo hopes to be excuſed, for uſing in his writings ſo many <hi>wordes of mirth:</hi> but this, he ſays, was only to make <hi>your grace merrie,</hi> and becauſe mirth has ever been eſteemed the beſt medicine. Borde muſt have had no ſmall ſhare of vanity, who could think thus highly of his own pleaſantry.

endured? Of an age, when the Bible was profaned and ridiculed from a principle of piety? But the faſhion of acting myſteries appears to have expired with this writer. He is ſaid, by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to have written a book of Hymns, and another of jeſts and tales: and to have tranſlated the tragedy of PAMMACHIUS <note n="y" place="bottom">CENT. viii. 100. p. 702.

               </note>. A low vein of abuſive burleſque, which had more virulence than humour, ſeems to have been one of Bale's talents: two of his pamphlets againſt the papiſts, all whom he conſidered as monks, are entitled the MASS OF THE GLUTTONS, and the ALCORAN OF THE PRELATES <note n="a" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. Next to expoſing the impoſtures of popery, literary hiſtory was his favorite purſuit: and his moſt celebrated performance is his account of the Britiſh writers. But this work, perhaps originally undertaken by Bale as a vehicle of his ſentiments in religion, is not only full of miſrepreſentations and partialities, ariſing from his religious prejudices, but of general inaccuracies, proceeding from negligence or miſinformation. Even thoſe more antient Lives which he tranſcribes from Leland's commentary on the ſame ſubject, are often interpolated with falſe facts, and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently marked with a miſapplied zeal for reformation. He is angry with many authors, who flouriſhed before the thirteenth century, for being catholics. He tells us, that lord Cromwell fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſcreened him from the fury of the more bigotted biſhops, on account of the comedies he had publiſhed <note n="b" place="bottom">

               <hi>gentle earl</hi> of Kent, called the CITIE OF DAMES, in three books. It was printed in 1521, by Henry Pepwell, whoſe prologue prefixed begins with theſe unpromiſing lines,</p>

            <p>In the diſperſed library of the late Mr. William Collins, I ſaw a thin folio of two ſheets in black letter, containing a poem in the octave ſtanza, entitled, FABYL'S GHOSTE, printed by John Raſtell in the year 1533. The piece is of no merit; and I ſhould not perhaps have mentioned it, but as the ſubject ſerves to throw light on our early drama.

He lived in the reign of Henry the ſeventh, and was buried in the church of Edmonton.

            <p>JOHN HEYWOOD, commonly called the epigrammatiſt, was beloved and rewarded by Henry the eighth for his buffoone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. At leaving the univerſity, he commenced author, and was countenanced by ſir Thomas More for his facetious diſpoſition. To his talents of jocularity in converſation, he joined a ſkill in muſic, both vocal and inſtrumental. His merriments were ſo irreſiſtible, that they moved even the rigid muſcles of queen Mary; and her ſullen ſolemnity was not proof againſt his ſongs, his rhymes, and his jeſts. He is ſaid to have been often invited to exerciſe his arts of entertainment and pleaſantry in her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and to have had the honour to be conſtantly admitted into her privy-chamber for this purpoſe <note n="a" place="bottom">Wood, ATH.

            <p>Notwithſtanding his profeſſional diſſipation, Heywood appears to have lived comfortably under the ſmiles of royal patronage. What the FAIRY QUEEN could not procure for Spenſer from the penurious Eliſabeth and her preciſe miniſters, Heywood gained by puns and conceits.</p>

            <p>The work has its value and curioſity as a repertory of proverbs made at ſo early a period. Nor was the plan totally void of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity, to exhibit theſe maxims in the courſe of a narrative, enlivened by facts and circumſtances. It certainly was ſuſceptible of humour and invention.</p>
            <p>Heywood's largeſt and moſt laboured performance is the SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DER AND THE FLIE, with wooden cuts, printed at London by Thomas Powell, in 1556 <note n="b" place="bottom">In quarto.</note>. It is a very long poem in the octave ſtanza, containing ninety-eight chapters. Perhaps there never was ſo dull, ſo tedious, and trifling an apologue: without fancy, meaning, or moral. A long tale of fictitious manners will always be tireſome, unleſs the deſign be burleſque: and then the ridiculous, ariſing from the contraſt between the ſolemn and the light, muſt be ingeniouſly ſupported. Our author ſeems to have intended a fable on the burleſque conſtruction: but we know not when he would be ſerious and when witty, whether he means to make the reader laugh, or to give him advice. We muſt indeed acknowledge, that the age was not yet ſufficiently

An old Scotch poem called SIR PENNY has been formed from this, printed in AN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIENT SCOTTISH POEMS, p. 153. Edinb. 1770. [See ſupr. vol. i. 9.]</note>. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, the author of the DESCRIPTION OF BRITAINE, prefixed
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0373600103:198"/>
to Hollinſhed's Chronicle, has left a ſenſible criticiſm on this poem. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"One hath made a boke of the SPIDER AND
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0373600103:199"/>
FLIE, wherin he dealeth ſo profoundly, and beyond all mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſkill, that neither he himſelf that made it, neither any one that readeth it, can reach unto the meaning thereof <note n="d" place="bottom">DESCRIPT. BRIT. p. 226. Hollinſh. CHRON. tom. i.</note>."</q> It is a proof of the unpopularity of this poem, that it never was reprinted. Our author's EPIGRAMS, and the poem of PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERBS, were in high vogue, and had numerous editions within the year 1598. The moſt lively part of the SPIDER and FLIE is perhaps the mock-fight between the ſpiders and flies, an awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward imitation of Homer's BATRACHOMUOMACHY. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations for this bloody and eventful engagement, on the part of the ſpiders, in their cobweb-caſtle, are thus deſcribed.</p>

            </q>
            <p>The beginning of all this confuſion is owing to a fly entering the poet's window, not through a broken pane, as might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, but through the lattice, where it is ſuddenly entangled in a cobweb <note n="k" place="bottom">Cap. i.</note>. The cobweb, however, will be allowed to be ſufficiently
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0373600103:200"/>
deſcriptive of the poet's apartment. But I mention this circumſtance as a probable proof, that windows of lattice, and not of glaſs, were now the common faſhion <note n="l" place="bottom">

                  <p>In the CONCLUSION to the SPIDER and FLIE, Heywood mentions queen Mary and king Philip. But as moſt of his pieces ſeem to have been written ſome time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I have placed him under Henry the eighth.</p>

            <p>John Heywood died at Mechlin in Brabant about the year 1565. He was inflexibly attached to the catholic cauſe, and on the death of queen Mary quitted the kingdom. Antony Wood remarks <note n="m" place="bottom">ATH. OXON. i. 150.</note>, with his uſual acrimony, that it was a matter of wonder with many, that, conſidering the great and uſual want of principle in the profeſſion, a poet ſhould become a voluntary exile for the ſake of religion.</p>

It is evidently formed on the tragical ſoliloquies, which compoſe Lydgate's paraphraſe of Boccace's book DE CASIBUS VIRORUM ILLUSTRIUM, and which gave birth to the MIRROR OF MAGISTRATES, the origin of our hiſtoric dramas.

In the fourth ſtanza, ſhe reproaches the aſtrologers for their falſity in having predicted, that this ſhould be the happieſt and moſt fortunate year of her whole life. This, while it is a natural reflection in the ſpeaker, is a proof of More's contempt of a futile and frivolous ſcience, then ſo much in eſteem. I have been prolix in my citation from this forgotten poem: but I am of opinion, that ſome of the ſtanzas have ſtrokes of nature and pathos, and deſerved to be reſcued from total oblivion.</p>
            <p>More, when a young man, contrived in an apartment of his father's houſe a <hi>goodly hangyng of fyne painted clothe,</hi> exhibiting nine pageants, or allegoric repreſentations, of the ſtages of man's life, together with the figures of Death, Fame, Time, and Eternity.

            <p>Tapeſtry, with metrical legends illuſtrating the ſubject, was common in this age: and the public pageants in the ſtreets were often exhibited with explanatory verſes.

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0373600103:207"/>
affords no poſitive indication of that date <note n="y" place="bottom">MSS. HARL. 5396.</note>. It was publiſhed from an antient manuſcript in the year 1631, and reduced to a more modern ſtyle, by William Bedwell, rector of Tottenham, and one of the tranſlators of the Bible. He ſays it was written by Gilbert Pilkington, ſuppoſed to have been rector of the ſame pariſh, and author of an unknown tract, called PASSIO DOMINI JESU. But Bedwell, without the leaſt comprehenſion of the ſcope and ſpirit of the piece, imagines it to be a ſerious narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of a real event; and, with as little ſagacity, believes it to have been written before the year 1330. Allowing that it might originate from a real event, and that there might be ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and local abuſe at the bottom, it is impoſſible that the poet could be ſerious. Undoubtedly the chief merit of this poem, although not deſtitute of humour, conſiſts in the deſign rather than the execution. As Chaucer, in the RIME OF SIR THOPAS <note n="z" place="bottom">I take this opportunity of obſerving, that the ſtanza of one of Laurence Minot's poems on the wars of Edward the third, is the ſame as Chaucer's SIR TOPAS.

Even on a ſuppoſition that here is an alluſion to real facts and characters, and that it was intended to expoſe ſome popular ſtory of the amours of the daughter of the Reve of Tottenham, we muſt acknowledge that the ſatire is conveyed in an ingenious mode. He has introduced a parcel of clowns and ruſtics, the inhabitants of Tottenham, Iſlington, Highgate, and Hackney, places then not quite ſo poliſhed as at preſent, who imitate all

            <p>It appears to me, that the author, to give dignity to his nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, and to heighten the ridicule by ſtiffening the familiarity of his incidents and characters, has affected an antiquity of ſtyle. This I could prove from the caſt of its fundamental diction and idiom, with which many of the old words do not agree. Perhaps another of the author's affectations is the alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terative manner. For although other ſpecimens of alliteration, in ſmaller pieces, are now to be found, yet it was a ſingularity. To thoſe which I have mentioned, of this reign, I take this opportunity of adding an alliterative poem, which may be called the FALCON AND THE PIE, who ſupport a DYALOGUE DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SENSYVE FOR WOMEN AGAYNST MALICYOUS DETRAC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TOURS, printed in 1542 <note n="u" place="bottom">

There is a ſtatute, made in 1337, prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting any under 100l. per annum, to wear fur. I ſuppoſe the richeſt fur was Ermine; which, before the manufactures of gold and ſilver, was the greateſt article of finery in dreſs. But it continued in uſe long after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as appears by antient portraits. In the Statutes of Cardinal Wolſey's College at Oxford, given in the year 1525, the ſtudents are enjoned, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Ne magis pretioſis aut ſumptuoſis utantur PELLIBUS."</q> De VESTITU, &amp;c. fol. 49. MSS. Cott. TIT. F. iii. This injunction is a proof that rich furs were at that time a luxury of the ſecular life. In an old poem written in the reign of Henry the ſixth, about 1436, entitled the ENGLISH POLICIE, <hi>exhorting all England to keepe the ſea,</hi> a curious and valuable record of the ſtate of our traffick and mercantile navigation at that period, it appears that our trade with Ireland, for furs only, was then very conſiderable.

            <p>I FEAR I ſhall be pronounced a heretic to modern criticiſm, in retracting what I have ſaid in a preceding page, and in placing the NOTBROWNE MAYDE under ſome part of this reign. Prior, who, about the year 1718, paraphraſed this poem, without improving its native beauties, ſuppoſes it to have been three hundred years old. It appears from two letters preſerved in the Britiſh Muſeum, written by Prior to Wanley, lord Oxford's librarian, that Prior conſulted Wanley about this antient ballad <note n="a" place="bottom">MSS. HARL. 3777.</note>. It is, however, certain, that Wanley, an antiquarian of unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable ſkill and judgement in theſe niceties, whatever directions and information he might have imparted to Prior on this ſubject, could never have communicated ſuch a deciſion. He certainly in theſe letters gives no ſuch opinion <note n="b" place="bottom">Theſe letters are printed in the AD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DITIONS TO POPE'S WORKS, in two vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes, publiſhed about two years ago.</note>. This is therefore the haſty conjecture of Prior; who thought that the curioſity which he was preſenting to the world, would derive proportionable value from its antiquity, who was better employed than in the petty labour of aſcertaining dates, and who knew much more of modern than antient poetry.</p>
            <p>The NOT-BROWNE MAYDE firſt appeared in Arnolde's CHRONICLE, or CUSTOMS OF LONDON, which was firſt printed about the year 1521. This is perhaps the moſt heterogeneous and multifarious miſcellany that ever exiſted. The collector ſets out with a catalogue of the mayors and ſheriffs, the cuſtoms and charters, of the city of London. Soon afterwards we have
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0373600103:240"/>
receipts to pickle ſturgeon, to make vinegar, ink, and gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder; how to raiſe parſley in an hour; the arts of brewery and ſoap-making; an eſtimate of the livings in London; an account of the laſt viſitation of ſaint Magnus's church; the weight of Eſſex cheeſe, and a letter to cardinal Wolſey. The NOT-BROWNE MAYDE is introduced, between an eſtimate of ſome ſubſidies paid into the exchequer, and directions for buying goods in Flanders. In a word, it ſeems to have been this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piler's plan, by way of making up a volume, to print together all the notices and papers, whether antient or modern, which he could amaſs, of every ſort and ſubject. It is ſuppoſed, that he intended an antiquarian repertory: but as many recent mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials were admitted, that idea was not at leaſt uniformly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; nor can any argument be drawn from that ſuppoſition, that this poem exiſted long before, and was inſerted as a piece of antiquity.</p>
            <p>The editor of the PROLUSIONS infers <note n="c" place="bottom">PROLUSIONS, or <hi>ſelect pieces of antient Poetry,</hi> Lond. 1760. 4to. Pref. p. vii.</note>, from an identity of rhythmus and orthography, and an affinity of words and phraſes, that this poem appeared after ſir Thomas More's JEST OF THE SERJEANT AND FREER, which, as I have obſerved, was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten about the year 1500. This reaſoning, were not other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments obvious, would be inconcluſive, and might be turned to the oppoſite ſide of the queſtion. But it is evident from the language of the NOTBROWNE MAYDE, that it was not written earlier than the beginning, at leaſt, of the ſixteenth century. There is hardly an obſolete word, or that requires a gloſſary, in the whole piece: and many parts of Surry and Wyat are much more difficult to be underſtood. Reduce any two ſtanzas to modern orthography, and they ſhall hardly wear the appearance of antient poetry. The reader ſhall try the experiment on the two following, which occur accidentally <note n="d" place="bottom">V. 168.</note>.</p>

               </gap>RS FOR THE CURIOUS, and prefaced with a little eſſay on our antient poets and poetry, in which it is ſaid to have been three hundred old. Fortunately for modern poetry, this republication ſuggeſted it to the notice of Prior, who perhaps from the ſame ſource might
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0373600103:244"/>
have adopted or confirmed his hypotheſis, that it was coeval with the commencement of the fifteenth century.</p>
            <p>Whoever was the original inventor of this little dramatic dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, he has ſhewn no common ſkill in contriving a plan, which powerfully detains our attention, and intereſts the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, by a conſtant ſucceſſion of ſuſpence and pleaſure, of anxiety and ſatisfaction. Betwixt hopes perpetually diſappointed, and ſolicitude perpetually relieved, we know not how to determine the event of a debate, in which new difficulties ſtill continue to be raiſed, and are almoſt as ſoon removed. In the midſt of this viciſſitude of feelings, a ſtriking contraſt of character is artfully formed, and uniformly ſupported, between the ſeeming unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ingratitude of the man, and the unconquerable attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and fidelity of the woman, whoſe amiable compliance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly defeats every objection, and continually furniſhes new matter for our love and compaſſion. At length, our fears ſubſide in the triumph of ſuffering innocence and patient ſincerity. The Man, whoſe hard ſpeeches had given us ſo much pain, ſuddenly ſurpriſes us with a change of ſentiment, and becomes equally an object of our admiration and eſteem. In the diſentan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glement of this diſtreſsful tale, we are happy to find, that all his cruelty was tenderneſs, and his inconſtancy the moſt invari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able truth; his levity an ingenious artifice, and his perverſity the friendly diſguiſe of the firmeſt affection. He is no longer an unfortunate exile, the profligate companion of the thieves and ruffians of the foreſt, but an opulent earl of Weſtmoreland; and promiſes, that the lady, who is a baron's daughter, and whoſe conſtancy he had proved by ſuch a ſeries of embarraſſing propoſals, ſhall inſtantly be made the partner of his riches and honours. Nor ſhould we forget to commend the invention of the poet, in imagining the modes of trying the lady's patience, and in feigning ſo many new ſituations: which, at the ſame time, open a way to deſcription, and to a variety of new ſcenes and images.</p>
            <p>I cannot help obſerving here, by the way, that Prior has miſconceived
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0373600103:245"/>
and eſſentially marred his poet's deſign, by ſoftening the ſternneſs of the Man, which could not be intended to admit of any degree of relaxation. Henry's hypocriſy is not charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſtically nor conſiſtently ſuſtained. He frequently talks in too reſpectful and complaiſant a ſtyle. Sometimes he calls Emma my <hi>tender maid,</hi> and my <hi>beauteous Emma;</hi> he fondly dwells on the ambroſial plenty of her flowing ringlets gracefully wreathed with variegated ribbands, and expatiates with rapture on the charms of her ſnowy boſom, her ſlender waiſt, and harmony of ſhape. In the antient poem, the concealed lover never abates his affectation of rigour and reſerve, nor ever drops an expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which may tend to betray any traces of tenderneſs. He retains his ſeverity to the laſt, in order to give force to the concluſion of the piece, and to heighten the effect of the final declaration of his love. Thus, by diminiſhing the oppoſition of intereſts, and by giving too great a degree of uniformity to both characters, the diſtreſs is in ſome meaſure deſtroyed by Prior. For this reaſon, Henry, during the courſe of the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, is leſs an object of our averſion, and Emma of our pity. But theſe are the unavoidable conſequences of Prior's plan, who preſuppoſes a long connection between the lovers, which is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the warmeſt profeſſions of a reciprocal paſſion. Yet this very plan ſuggeſted another reaſon, why Prior ſhould have more cloſely copied the caſt of his original.

will ſelect an inſtance, among others, from the ſhews exhibited with great magnificence at the coronation of queen Anne Boleyn, in the year 1533. The proceſſion to Weſtminſter abbey, began from the Tower; and the queen, in paſſing through Grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church ſtreet, was entertained with a repreſentation of mount Parnaſſus. The fountain of Helicon, by a bold fiction unknown to the bards of antiquity, ran in four ſtreams of Rheniſh wine from a baſon of white marble. On the ſummit of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſate Apollo, and at his feet Calliope. On either ſide of the declivity were arranged four of the Muſes, playing on their reſpective

muſical inſtruments. Under them were written epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grams and poeſies in golden letters, in which every Muſe praiſed the queen, according to her character and office. At the Conduit in Cornhill appeared the three Graces; before whom, with no great propriety, was the ſpring of <hi>Grace</hi> perpetually running wine. But when a conduit came in the way, a religious alluſion was too tempting and obvious to be omitted. Before the ſpring, however, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

At the Conduit in Cheapſide, as my chronicler ſays, ſhe was ſaluted with <q rend="inline margQuotes">"a rich pageaunt full of melodie and ſong."</q> In this pageant were Pallas, Juno, and Venus: before them ſtood Mercury, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to her majeſty, in the name of the three goddeſſes, a golden ball or globe divided into three parts, ſignifying wiſdom, riches, and felicity. At entering ſaint Paul's <hi>gate,</hi> an antient portal leading into the church-yard on the eaſt, and long ſince deſtroyed, three ladies richly attired ſhowered on her head wafers, in which were contained Latin diſtichs. At the eaſtern ſide of ſaint Paul's Church-yard, two hundred ſcholars of ſaint Paul's School, addreſſed her in choſen and appoſite paſſages from the Roman poets, tranſlated into Engliſh rhymes. On the leads of ſaint Martin's church ſtood a choir of boys and men, who ſung, not ſpiritual hymns, but <hi>new balads</hi> in praiſe of her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. On the conduit without Ludgate, where the arms and angels had been <hi>refreſhed,</hi> was erected a tower with four turrets, within each of which was placed a Cardinal Virtue, ſymboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally habited.

It may not be foreign to our purpoſe, to give the reader ſome diſtinct idea of the polite amuſements of this reign, among which, the Maſque, already mentioned in general terms, ſeems to have held the firſt place. It chiefly conſiſted of muſic, dancing, gaming, a banquet, and a diſplay of groteſque perſonages and fantaſtic dreſſes. The performers, as I have hinted, were often the king, and the chief of the nobility of both ſexes, who under proper diſguiſes executed ſome preconcerted ſtrategem, which ended in mirth and good humour. With one of theſe ſhews, in 1530, the king formed a ſcheme to ſurpriſe cardinal Wolſey, while he was celebrating a ſplendid banquet at his palace of Whitehall <note n="m" place="bottom">It th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

At night his majeſty in a maſque, with twelve more maſquers all richly but ſtrangely dreſſed, privately landed from Weſtminſter at Whitehall ſtairs. At landing, ſeveral ſmall pieces of canon were fired, which the king had before ordered to be placed on the ſhore near the houſe. The cardinal, who was ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately ſeated at the banquet in the preſence-chamber under the cloth of ſtate, a great number of ladies and lords being ſeated at the ſide-tables, was alarmed at this ſudden and unuſual noiſe: and immediately ordered lord Sandys, the king's chamberlain, who was one of the gueſts, and in the ſecret, to enquire the reaſon. Lord Sandys brought anſwer, that thirteen foreign no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen of diſtinction were juſt arrived, and were then waiting in the great hall below; having been drawn thither by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the cardinal's magnificent banquet, and of the beautiful ladies which were preſent at it. The cardinal ordered them immediately into the banquetting-room, to which they were conducted from the hall with twenty new torches and a concert of drums and fifes. After a proper refreſhment, they requeſted in the French language to dance with the ladies, whom they kiſſed, and to play with them at mum-chance <note n="n" place="bottom">A game of hazard with dic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

On finding their plot in danger, they anſwered, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"If your grace can point him out, he will readily diſcover himſelf."</q> The cardinal pointed to a maſque with a black beard, but he was miſtaken, for it was ſir Edward Nevil. At this, the king could not forbear laughing aloud: and pulling off his own and ſir Edward Nevil's maſque, convinced the cardinal, with much arch complaiſance, that he had for once gueſſed wrong. The king and the maſquers then retired into another apartment to change their apparel: and in the meantime the banquet was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and the table covered afreſh with perfumed clothes. Soon afterwards the king, with his company, returned, and took his ſeat under the cardinal's canopy of ſtate. Immediately two hundred diſhes of the moſt coſtly cookery and confectionary were ſerved up; the contrivance and ſucceſs of the royal joke afforded much pleaſant converſation, and the night was ſpent in dancing, dice-playing, <hi>banketting and other triumphs</hi>

For inſtance, in the great hall of the palace, the uſual place of performance, a vaſt mountain covered with tall trees aroſe ſuddenly, from whoſe opening caverns iſſued hermits, pilgrims, ſhepherds, knights, damſels, and gypſies, who being regaled with ſpices and wine danced a moriſco, or morris-dance. They were then again received into the mountain, which with a ſymphony of rebecs and recorders cloſed its caverns; and tumbling to pieces, was replaced by a ſhip in full ſail, or a caſtle beſieged. To be more particular. The following device was ſhewn in the hall of the palace at Greenwich.

            <p>We are taught in the mythology of the antients, that the three Graces were produced at a birth. The meaning of the fable is, that the three moſt beautiful imitative arts were born and grew up together. Our poetry now beginning to be diveſted of its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtic barbariſm, and to advance towards elegance, was accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by proportionable improvements in Painting and Muſic. Henry employed many capital painters, and endeavoured to invite Raphael and Titian into England. Inſtead of allegorical tapeſtry, many of the royal apartments were adorned with hiſtorical pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Our familiarity with the manners of Italy, and affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Italian accompliſhments, influenced the tones and enriched
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0373600103:264"/>
the modulation of our muſical compoſition. Thoſe who could read the ſonnets of Petrarch muſt have reliſhed the airs of Paleſtrina. At the ſame time, Architecture, like Milton's lion <hi>pawing to get free,</hi> made frequent efforts to diſentangle itſelf from the maſſy incumbrances of the Gothic manner; and began to catch the correct graces, and to copy the true mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, of the Grecian and Roman models. Henry was himſelf a great builder; and his numerous edifices, although conſtructed altogether on the antient ſyſtem, are ſometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſperſed with chaſte ornaments and graceful mouldings, and often marked with a legitimacy of proportion, and a purity of deſign, before unattempted. It was among the literary plans of Leland, one of the moſt claſſical ſcholars of this age, to write an account of Henry's palaces, in imitation of Procopius, who is ſaid to have deſcribed the palaces of the emperor Juſtinian. Frequent ſymptoms appeared, that perfection in every work of taſte was at no great diſtance. Thoſe clouds of ignorance which yet remained, began now to be illuminated by the approach of the dawn of truth.</p>

            <p>THE reformation of our church produced an alteration for a time in the general ſyſtem of ſtudy, and changed the character and ſubjects of our poetry. Every mind, both learned and unlearned, was buſied in religious ſpeculation; and every pen was employed in recommending, illuſtrating, and familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Bible, which was now laid open to the people.</p>
            <p>The poetical annals of king Edward the ſixth, who removed thoſe chains of bigottry which his brother Henry had only looſened, are marked with metrical tranſlations of various parts of the ſacred ſcripture. Of theſe the chief is the verſification of the Pſalter by Sternhold and Hopkins: a performance, which has acquired an importance, and conſequently claims a place in our ſeries, not ſo much from any merit of its own, as from the circumſtances with which it is connected.</p>
            <p>It is extraordinary, that the proteſtant churches ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to a country in which the reformation had never begun to make any progreſs, and even to the indulgence of a ſociety which remains to this day the grand bulwark of the catholic theology, for a very diſtinguiſhing and eſſential part of their ritual.</p>
            <p>About the year 1540, Clement Marot, a valet of the bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber to king Francis the firſt, was the favorite poet of France. This writer, having attained an unuſual elegance and facility of ſtyle, added many new embelliſhments to the rude ſtate of the French poetry. It is not the leaſt of his praiſes, that La Fontaine uſed to call him his maſter. He was the inventor
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0373600103:266"/>
of the rondeau, and the reſtorer of the madrigal: but he became chiefly eminent for his paſtorals, ballads, fables, elegies, epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grams, and tranſlations from Ovid and Petrarch. At length, being tired of the vanities of profane poetry, or rather privately tinctured with the principles of Lutheraniſm, he attempted, with the aſſiſtance of his friend Theodore Beza, and by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of the profeſſor of Hebrew in the univerſity of Paris, a verſion of David's Pſalms into French rhymes. This tranſlation, which did not aim at any innovation in the public worſhip, and which received the ſanction of the Sorbonne as containing nothing contrary to ſound doctrine, he dedicated to his maſter Francis the firſt, and to the Ladies of France. In the dedication to the Ladies or <hi>les Dames de France,</hi> whom he had often before addreſſed in the tendereſt ſtrains of paſſion or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment, he ſeems anxious to deprecate the raillery which the new tone of his verſification was likely to incur, and is embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed how to find an apology for turning ſaint. Conſcious of his apoſtacy from the levities of life, in a ſpirit of religious gallantry, he declares that his deſign is to add to the happineſs of his fair readers, by ſubſtituting divine hymns in the place of <hi>chanſons d' amour,</hi> to inſpire their ſuſceptible hearts with a paſſion in which there is no torment, to baniſh that fickle and fantaſtic deity CUPID from the world, and to fill their apartments with the praiſes, not of the <hi>little god,</hi> but of the true Jehovah.</p>

            <p>Marot's Pſalms ſoon eclipſed the brilliancy of his madrigals and ſonnets. Not ſuſpecting how prejudicial the predominant rage of pſalm-ſinging might prove to the antient religion of Europe, the catholics themſelves adopted theſe ſacred ſongs as ſerious ballads, and as a more rational ſpecies of domeſtic merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Thy were the common accompaniments of the fiddle. They were ſold ſo rapidly, that the printers could not ſupply the public with copies. In the feſtive and ſplendid court of Francis the firſt, of a ſudden nothing was heard but the pſalms of Clement Marot. By each of the royal family and the principal nobility of the court a pſalm was choſen, and fitted to the ballad-tune which each liked beſt. The dauphin prince Henry, who delighted in hunting, was fond of <hi>Ainſi qu'on oit le cerf bruire,</hi> or, <hi>Like as the Hart deſireth the water-brooks,</hi> which he conſtantly ſung in going out to the chaſe.

            <p>At this period John Calvin, in oppoſition to the diſcipline and doctrines of Rome, was framing his novel church at Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva: in which the whole ſubſtance and form of divine worſhip was reduced to praying, preaching, and ſinging. In the laſt of theſe three, he choſe to depart widely from the catholic uſage: and, either becauſe he thought that novelty was ſure to ſucceed, that the practice of antiphonal chanting was ſuperſtitious, or that the people were excluded from bearing a part in the more ſolemn and elaborate performance of eccleſiaſtical muſic, or that the old papiſtic hymns were unedifying, or that verſe was better remembered than proſe, he projected, with the advice of Luther, a ſpecies of religious ſong, conſiſting of portions of the pſalms intelligibly tranſlated into the vernacular language, and adapted to plain and eaſy melodies, which all might learn, and in which all might join. This ſcheme, either by deſign or acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, was luckily ſeconded by the publication of Marot's metri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal pſalms at Paris, which Calvin immediately introduced into his congregation at Geneva. Being ſet to ſimple and almoſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notonous notes by Guillaume de Franc, they were ſoon eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed as the principal branch in that reformer's new devotion, and became a characteriſtical mark or badge of the Calviniſtic worſhip and profeſſion. Nor were they ſung only in his churches. They exhilarated the convivial aſſemblies of the Calviniſts, were commonly heard in the ſtreets, and accompanied the labours of the artificer. The weavers and woollen manufacturers of Flanders, many of whom left the loom and entered into the miniſtry, are ſaid to have been the capital performers into this ſcience. At length Marot's pſalms formed an appendix to the catechiſm of Geneva, and were interdicted to the catholics under the moſt
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0373600103:269"/>
ſevere penalties. In the language of the orthodox, pſalm-ſinging and hereſy were ſynonimous terms.</p>
            <p>It was Calvin's ſyſtem of reformation, not only to ſtrip reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of its ſuperſtitious and oſtenſible pageantries, of crucifixes, images, tapers, ſuperb veſtments, and ſplendid proceſſions, but of all that was eſtimable in the ſight of the people, and even of every ſimple ornament, every ſignificant ſymbol, and decent ceremony; in a word, to baniſh every thing from his church which attracted or employed the ſenſes, or which might tend to mar the purity of an abſtracted adoration, and of a mental in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with the deity. It is hard to determine, how Calvin could reconcile the uſe of ſinging, even when purged from the corruptions and abuſes of popery, to ſo philoſophical a plan of worſhip. On a parallel principle, and if any artificial aids to devotion were to be allowed, he might at leaſt have retained the uſe of pictures in the church. But a new ſect always draws its converts from the multitude and the meaneſt of the people, who can have no reliſh for the more elegant externals. Calvin well knew that the manufacturers of Germany were no judges of pictures. At the ſame time it was neceſſary that his congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be kept in good humour by ſome kind of pleaſurable gratification and allurement, which might qualify and enliven the attendance on the more rigid duties of praying and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Calvin therefore, intent as he was to form a new church on a ſevere model, had yet too much ſagacity to exclude every auxiliary to devotion. Under this idea, he permitted an exerciſe, which might engage the affections, without violating the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of his worſhip: and ſenſible that his chief reſources were in the rabble of a republic, and availing himſelf of that natural propenſity which prompts even vulgar minds to expreſs their more animated feelings in rhyme and muſic, he conceived a mode of univerſal pſalmody, not too refined for common capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, and fitted to pleaſe the populace. The rapid propagation of Calvin's religion, and his numerous proſelytes, are a ſtrong proof of his addreſs in planning ſuch a ſort of ſervice. France
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0373600103:270"/>
and Germany were inſtantly infatuated with a love of pſalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinging: which being admirably calculated to kindle and diffuſe the flame of fanaticiſm, was peculiarly ſerviceable to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of faction, and frequently ſerved as the trumpet to rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. Theſe energetic hymns of Geneva, under the conduct of the Calviniſtic preachers, excited and ſupported a variety of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular inſurrections; they filled the moſt flouriſhing cities of the Low-countries with ſedition and tumult, and fomented the fury which defaced many of the moſt beautiful and venerable churches of Flanders.</p>
            <p>This infectious frenzy of ſacred ſong ſoon reached England, at the very critical point of time, when it had juſt embraced the reformation: and the new pſalmody was obtruded on the new Engliſh liturgy by ſome few officious zealots, who favoured the diſcipline of Geneva, and who wiſhed to aboliſh, not only the choral mode of worſhip in general, but more particularly to ſuppreſs the TE DEUM, BENEDICTUS, MAGNIFICAT, JUBI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LATE, NUNC DIMITTIS, and the reſt of the liturgic hymns, which were ſuppoſed to be contaminated by their long and antient connection with the Roman miſſal, or at leaſt in their proſaic form, to be unſuitable to the new ſyſtem of worſhip.</p>
            <p>Although Wyat and Surrey had before made tranſlations of the Pſalms into metre, Thomas Sternhold was the firſt whoſe metrical verſion of the Pſalms was uſed in the church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Sternhold was a native of Hampſhire, and probably edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated at Wincheſter college. Having paſſed ſome time at Oxford, he became groom of the robes to king Henry the eighth. In this department, either his diligent ſervices or his knack at rhyming ſo pleaſed the king, that his majeſty bequeathed him a legacy of one hundred marks. He continued in the ſame office under Edward the ſixth, and is ſaid to have acquired ſome degree of reputation about the court for his poetry. Being of a ſerious diſpoſition, and an enthuſiaſt to reformation, he was much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at the laſcivious ballads which prevailed among the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers: and, with a laudable deſign to check theſe indecencies, undertook
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0373600103:271"/>
a metrical verſion of the Pſalter, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"thinking thereby, ſays Antony Wood, that the courtiers would ſing them inſtead of their ſonnets, <hi>but did not,</hi> only ſome few excepted <note n="c" place="bottom">ATH. Oxon. i. 76.</note>."</q> Here was the zeal, if not the ſucceſs, of his fellow labourer Clement Marot. A ſingular coincidence of circumſtances is, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, to be remarked on this occaſion. Vernacular verſions for general uſe of the Pſalter were firſt publiſhed both in France and England, by laymen, by court-poets, and by ſervants of the court. Nor were the reſpective tranſlations entirely completed by themſelves: and yet they tranſlated nearly an equal number of pſalms, Marot having verſified fifty, and Sternhold fifty-one. Sternhold died in the year 1549. His fifty-one pſalms were printed the ſame year by Edward Whitchurch, under the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing title. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"All ſuch Pſalms of David as Thomas Stern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde late grome of the kinges Maieſtyes robes did in his ly<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Cotemporary with Sternhold, and his coadjutor, was John Hopkins: of whoſe life nothing more is known, than that he was a clergyman and a ſchoolmaſter of Suffolk, and perhaps a graduate at Oxford about the year 1544. Of his abilities as a teacher of the claſſics, he has left a ſpecimen in ſome Latin ſtanzas prefixed to FOX'S MARTYROLOGY. He is rather a better Engliſh poet than Sternhold; and tranſlated fifty eight of the pſalms, diſtinguiſhed by the initials of his name.</p>
            <p>Of the reſt of the contributors to this undertaking, the chief, at leaſt in point of rank and learning, was William Whytting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, promoted by Robert earl of Leiceſter to the deanery of Durham, yet not without a ſtrong reluctance to comply with the uſe of the canonical habiliments. Among our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious exiles in the reign of Mary, he was Calvin's principal
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0373600103:272"/>
favorite, from whom he received ordination. So pure was his faith, that he was thought worthy to ſucceed to the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Geneva, ſuperintended by Knox, the Scotch reformer; who, from a deteſtation of idols, proceeded to demoliſh the churches in which they were contained. It was one of the natural conſequences of Whyttingham's tranſlation from Knox's paſtorſhip at Geneva to an Engliſh deanery, that he deſtroyed or removed many beautiful and harmleſs monuments of antient art in his cathedral. To a man, who had ſo highly ſpiritualiſed his religious conceptions, as to be convinced that a field, a ſtreet, or a barn, were fully ſufficient for all the operations of chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian worſhip, the venerable ſtructures raiſed by the magnificent piety of our anceſtors could convey no ideas of ſolemnity, and had no other charms than their ample endowments. Beſide the pſalms he tranſlated <note n="d" place="bottom">Among them is the hundreth, and the hundred and nineteenth.</note>, all which bear his initials, by way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novating ſtill further on our eſtabliſhed formularly, he verſified the Decalogue, the Nicene, Apoſtolic, and Athanaſian Creeds, the Lord's Prayer, the TE DEUM, the Song of the three Children, with other hymns which follow the book of pſalmody. How the Ten Commandments and the Athanaſian Creed, to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of ſome of the reſt, ſhould become more edifying and better ſuited to common uſe, or how they could receive im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement in any reſpect or degree, by being reduced into rhym<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But the real deſign was, to render that more tolerable which could not be entirely removed, to accommodate every part of the ſervice to the pſalmodic tone, and to clothe our whole liturgy in the garb of Geneva. All theſe, for he was a lover of muſic, were ſung in Whytting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's church of Durham under his own directions.

But he adviſes Wiſdome to ſteal back again to his tomb, which was in Carfax church at Oxford, ſilent and unperceived, for fear of being detected and intercepted by the Pope or the Turk.

with all other writers employed in a ſimilar taſk.

the idea of the compariſon.

            <p>The miraculous march of Jehovah before the Iſraelites through the wilderneſs in their departure from Egypt, with other marks of his omnipotence, is thus imaged by the inſpired pſalmiſt. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"O God, when thou wenteſt forth before the people, when thou wenteſt through the wilderneſs: the earth ſhook, and the heavens dropped at the preſence of God; even as Sinai alſo was moved at the preſence of God, who is the God of Iſrael.

            <p>Almoſt the entire contexture of the proſe is here literally transferred, unbroken and without tranſpoſition, allowing for the ſmall deviations neceſſarily occaſioned by the metre and rhyme. It may be ſaid, that the tranſlator has teſtified his judgment in retaining ſo much of the original, and proved he was ſenſible the paſſage needed not any adventitious ornament.

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0373600103:281"/>
the church of England. It is certain, had they been more poetically tranſlated, they would not have been acceptable to the common people. Yet however they may be allowed to ſerve the purpoſes of private edification, in adminiſtering ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual conſolation to the manufacturer and mechanic, as they are extrinſic to the frame of our liturgy, and incompatible with the genius of our ſervice, there is perhaps no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety in wiſhing, that they were remitted and reſtrained to that church in which they ſprung, and with whoſe character and conſtitution they ſeem ſo aptly to correſpond. Whatever eſtimation in point of compoſition they might have attracted at their firſt appearance in a ruder age, and however inſtrumental they might have been at the infancy of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in weaning the minds of men from the papiſtic ritual, all theſe conſiderations can now no longer ſupport even a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious argument for their being retained. From the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the times, and the growing refinements of literature, of courſe they become obſolete and contemptible. A work grave, ſerious, and even reſpectable for its poetry, in the reign of Edward the ſixth, at length in a cultivated age, has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the air of an abſolute traveſtie. Voltaire obſerves, that in proportion as good taſte improved, the pſalms of Clement Marot inſpired only diſguſt: and that although they charmed the court of Francis the firſt, they ſeemed only to be calculated for the populace in the reign of Lewis the fourteenth <note n="r" place="bottom">HIST. MOD. ch. ccvii.</note>.</p>
            <p>To obviate theſe objections, attempts have been made from time to time to moderniſe this antient metrical verſion, and to render it more tolerable and intelligible by the ſubſtitution of more familiar modes of diction. But, to ſay nothing of the unſkilfulneſs with which theſe arbitrary corrections have been conducted, by changing obſolete for known words, the texture and integrity of the original ſtyle, ſuch as it was, has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed: and many ſtanzas, before too naked and weak, like a

plain old Gothic edifice ſtripped of its few ſignatures of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, have loſt that little and almoſt only ſtrength and ſupport which they derived from antient phraſes. Such alterations, even if executed with prudence and judgment, only corrupt what they endeavour to explain; and exhibit a motley performance, belonging to no character of writing, and which contains more improprieties than thoſe which it profeſſes to remove. Hearne is highly offended at theſe unwarrantable and incongruous emen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, which he pronounces to be <hi>abominable</hi> in any book, <q rend="inline">"much more in a ſacred work;"</q> and is confident, that were Sternhold and Hopkins <q rend="inline margQuotes">"now living, they would be ſo far from owning what is aſcribed to them, that they would proceed againſt the innovators as CHEATS <note n="s" place="bottom">GLOSS.

But the queen and thoſe biſhops to whom ſhe had delegated the buſineſs of ſuperviſing the liturgy, among which was the learned and liberal archbiſhop Parker, objected, that too much attention had already been paid to the German theology.

which was profeſſedly written to ſhew the ſpiritual efficacy or virtue of the pſalms in metre, and in which he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects a diſtinct and audible mode of congregational ſinging, he probably ſuppreſſed it, becauſe he ſaw that the practice had been abuſed to the purpoſes of fanaticiſm, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Some of our muſical antiquaries, however, have juſtly conjectured, that the archbiſhop, who was ſkilled in muſic, and had formerly founded a muſic-ſchool in his college of Stoke Clare, intended theſe pſalms, which are adapted to complicated tunes of four parts probably conſtructed by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and here given in ſcore, for the uſe of cathedrals; at a time, when compoſitions in counterpoint were uncommon in the church, and when that part of our choir-ſervice called the motet or anthem, which admits a more artificial diſplay of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and which is recommended and allowed in queen Eliſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth's earlieſt eccleſiaſtical injunctions, was yet almoſt unknown, or but in a very imperfect ſtate. Accordingly, although the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection is not quite comprehenſible, he orders many of them to be ſung by the <hi>rector chori,</hi> or chantor, and the <hi>quier,</hi> or choir, alternately. That at leaſt he had a taſte for muſic, we may conclude from the following not inelegant ſcale of modulation, prefixed to his eight tunes abovementioned.</p>

            <p>A conſiderable contributor to the metrical theology was Robert Crowley, educated in Magdalene college at Oxford, where he obtained a fellowſhip in 1542. In the reign of Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the ſixth, he commenced printer and preacher in London. He lived in Ely-rents in Holborn: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"where, ſays Wood, he ſold books, and at leiſure times exerciſed the gift of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the great city and elſewhere <note n="r" place="bottom">ATH. OXON. i. 235.</note>."</q> In 1550 he printed the firſt edition of PIERCE PLOWMAN'S VISION, but with the ideas of a controverſialiſt, and with the view of helping forward the reformation by the revival of a book which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the abſurdities of popery in ſtrong ſatire, and which at preſent is only valuable or uſeful, as it ſerves to gratify the harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs reſearches of thoſe peaceable philoſophers who ſtudy the progreſſion of antient literature. His pulpit and his preſs, thoſe two prolific ſources of faction, happily cooperated in propagating his principles of predeſtination: and his ſhop and his ſermons were alike frequented. Poſſeſſed of thoſe talents which qualified him for captivating the attention and moving the paſſions of the multitude, under queen Eliſabeth he held many dignities in a church, whoſe doctrines and polity his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcerning zeal had a tendency to deſtroy. He tranſlated into popular rhyme, not only the pſalter, but the litany, with hymns, all which he printed together in 1549. In the ſame year, and in the ſame meaſure, he publiſhed <hi>The Voice of the laſt Trumpet blown by the ſeventh angel.</hi> This piece contains twelve ſeveral leſſons, for the inſtruction or amendment of thoſe who ſeemed at that time chiefly to need advice; and among whom he enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merates <hi>lewd</hi> prieſts, ſcholars, phyſicians, beggars, yeomen, gentlemen,

magiſtrates, and women. He alſo attacked the abuſes of his age in thirty-one EPIGRAMS, firſt printed in 1551. The ſubjects are placed alphabetically. In his firſt alphabet are <hi>Abbayes, Alehouſes, Alleys,</hi> and <hi>Almeſhouſes.</hi> The ſecond, <hi>Bailiffs, Bawds, Beggars, Bear-bayting,</hi> and <hi>Brawlers.</hi> They diſplay, but without ſpirit or humour, the reprehenſible prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices and licentious manners which then prevailed. He pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in 1551, a kind of metrical ſermon on Pleaſure and Pain, Heaven and Hell. Many of theſe, to ſay nothing of his almoſt innumerable controverſial tracts in proſe, had repeated editions, and from his own preſs. But one of his treatiſes, to prove that Lent is a human invention and a ſuperſtitious inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, deſerves notice for its plan: it is a Dialogue between Lent and Liberty.

            <p>BUT among the theological verſifiers of theſe times, the moſt notable is Chriſtopher Tye, a doctor of muſic at Cambridge in 1545, and muſical preceptor to prince Edward, and probably to his ſiſters the princeſſes Mary and Eliſabeth. In the reign of Eliſabeth he was organiſt of the royal chapel, in which he had been educated. To his profeſſion of muſic, he joined ſome knowledge of Engliſh literature: and having been taught to believe that rhyme and edification were cloſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected, and being perſuaded that every part of the Scripture would be more inſtructive and better received if reduced into verſe, he projected a tranſlation of the ACTS OF THE APOS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TLES into familiar metre. It appears that the BOOK OF KINGS had before been verſified, which for many reaſons was more capable of ſhining under the hands of a tranſlator. But the moſt ſplendid hiſtorical book, I mean the moſt ſuſceptible of poetic ornament, in the Old or New Teſtament, would have become ridiculous when clothed in the faſhionable eccleſiaſtical ſtanza. Perhaps the plan of ſetting a narrative of this kind to muſic, was ſtill more prepoſterous and exceptionable. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he completed only the firſt fourteen chapters: and they were printed in 1553, by William Serres, with the following title, which by the reader, who is not acquainted with the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar complexion of this period, will hardly be ſuſpected to be ſerious. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"The ACTES OF THE APOSTLES tranſlated into Englyſhe metre, and dedicated to the kinges moſt excellent maieſtye by Criſtofer Tye, doctor in muſyke, and one of the

            <p>Doctor Tye's ACTS OF THE APOSTLES were ſung for a time in the royal chapel of Edward the ſixth. But they never became popular. The impropriety of the deſign, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency of the execution, ſeem to have been perceived even by his own prejudiced and undiſcerning age. This circumſtance, however, had probably the fortunate and ſeaſonable effect, of
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0373600103:298"/>
turning Tye's muſical ſtudies to another and a more rational ſyſtem: to the compoſition of words judiciouſly ſelected from the proſe pſalms in four or five parts. Before the middle of the reign of Eliſabeth, at a time when the more ornamental and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate muſic was wanted in our ſervice, he concurred with the celebrated Tallis and a few others in ſetting ſeveral anthems, which are not only juſtly ſuppoſed to retain much of the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſtrain of our antient choral melody before the reformation, but in reſpect of harmony, expreſſion, contrivance, and general effect, are allowed to be perfect models of the genuine eccleſiaſtic ſtyle.

            <p>It is not my intention to purſue any farther the mob of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious rhymers, who, from principles of the moſt unfeigned piety, devoutly laboured to darken the luſtre, and enervate the force, of the divine pages. And perhaps I have been already too prolix in examining a ſpecies of poetry, if it may be ſo called, which even impoveriſhes proſe; or rather, by mixing the ſtile of proſe with verſe, and of verſe with proſe, deſtroys
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0373600103:299"/>
the character and effect of both. But in ſurveying the general courſe of a ſpecies of literature, abſurdities as well as excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, the weakneſs and the vigour of the human mind, muſt have their hiſtorian. Nor is it unpleaſing to trace and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template thoſe ſtrange incongruities, and falſe ideas of perfection, which at various times, either affectation, or caprice, or faſhion, or opinion, or prejudi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I muſt not, however, forget, that king Edward the ſixth is to be ranked among the religious poets of his own reign. Fox has publiſhed his metrical inſtructions concerning the euchariſt, addreſſed to ſir Antony Saint Leger. Bale alſo mentions his comedy called the WHORE OF BABYLON, which Holland the heroologiſt, who perhaps had never ſeen it, and knew not whether it was a play or a ballad, in verſe or proſe, pronounces to be a moſt elegant perfo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Its elegance, with ſome, will not perhaps apologiſe or atone for its ſubject: and it may ſeem ſtrange, that controverſial ribaldry ſhould have been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to enter into the education of a great monarch. But the genius, habits, and ſituation; of his age ſhould be conſidered. The reformation was the great political topic of Edward's court. Intricate diſcuſſions in divinity were no longer confined to the ſchools or the clergy. The new religion, from its novelty, as well as importance, intereſted every mind, and was almoſt the ſole object of the general attention. Men emancipated from the ſeverities of a ſpiritual tyranny, reflected with horror on the ſlavery they had ſo long ſuffered, and with exultation on the triumph they had obtained. Theſe feelings were often expreſſed in a ſtrain of enthuſiaſm. The ſpirit of innovation, which had ſeized the times, often tranſgreſſed the bounds of truth. Every change of religion is attended with thoſe ebullitions, which growing more moderate by degrees, afterwards appear eccentric and ridiculous.</p>

We who live at a diſtance from this great and national ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle between popery and proteſtantiſm, when our church has been long and peaceably eſtabliſhed, and in an age of good ſenſe, of politeneſs and philoſophy, are apt to view theſe effuſions of royal piety as weak and unworthy the character of a king. But an oſtentation of zeal and example in the young Edward, as it was natural ſo it was neceſſary, while the reformation was yet immature. It was the duty of his preceptors, to impreſs on his tender years, an abhorrence of the principles of Rome, and a predilection to that happy ſyſtem which now ſeemed likely to prevail. His early diligence, his inclination to letters, and his ſeriouſneſs of diſpoſition, ſeconded their active endeavours to cultivate and to bias his mind in favour of the new theology, which was now become the faſhionable knowledge. Theſe and other amiable virtues his cotemporaries have given young Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in an eminent degree. But it may be preſumed, that the partiality which youth always commands, the ſpecious proſpects excited by expectation, and the flattering promiſes of religious liberty ſecured to a diſtant poſterity, have had ſome ſmall ſhare in dictating his panegyric.</p>
            <p>The new ſettlement of religion, by counteracting inveterate prejudices of the moſt intereſting nature, by throwing the clergy into a ſtate of contention, and by diſſeminating theological opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions among the people, excited ſo general a ferment, that even the popular ballads and the ſtage, were made the vehicles of the controverſy between the papal and proteſtant communions <note n="g" place="bottom">See inſtances already given, before the Reformation had actually taken place, ſupr. p. 144.</note>.</p>

Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually to reſtrain theſe abuſes, Henry, who loved to create a ſubject for perſecution, who commonly proceeded to diſannul what he had juſt confirmed, and who found that a freedom of enquiry tended to ſhake his eccleſiaſtical ſupremacy, framed a law, that not only Tyndale's Engliſh Bible, and all the printed Engliſh commentaries, expoſitions, annotations, defences, replies, and ſermons, whether orthodox or heretical, which it had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned, ſhould be utterly aboliſhed; but that the kingdom ſhould alſo be <hi>purged</hi> and <hi>cleanſed</hi> of all religious plays, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes, rhymes, ballads, and ſongs, which are equally <hi>peſtiferou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This was a MANNA to be <hi>gathered by every man.</hi> The claim of the people was too powerful to be overruled by the bigottry, the prejudice, or the caprice of Henry.</p>
            <p>I muſt add here, in reference to my general ſubject, that the tranſlation of the Bible, which in the reign of Edward the ſixth was admitted into the churches, is ſuppoſed to have fixed our language. It certainly has tranſmitted and perpetuated many antient words which would otherwiſe have been obſolete or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible. I have never ſeen it remarked, that at the ſame time this tranſlation contributed to enrich our native Engliſh at an early period, by importing and familiariſing many Latin words <note n="h" place="bottom">
                  <hi>More particularly in the Latin deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſubſtantives, ſuch as,</hi> divination, perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, adoption, manifeſtatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </note>.</p>
            <p>Theſe were ſuggeſted by the Latin vulgate, which was uſed as a medium by the tranſlators. Some of theſe, however, now interwoven into our common ſpeech, could not have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by many readers even above the rank of the vulgar, when the Bible firſt appeared in Engliſh. Biſhop Gardiner had therefore much leſs reaſon than we now imagine, for complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the too great clearneſs of the tranſlation, when with an inſidious view of keeping the people in their antient ignorance, he propoſed, that inſtead of always uſing Engliſh phraſes, many Latin words ſhould ſtill be preſerved, becauſe they contained an inherent ſignificance and a genuine dignity, to which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon tongue afforded no correſpondent expreſſions of ſufficient energy <note n="i" place="bottom">Such as, <hi>Idololatria, contritus, holo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſta, ſacramentum, elementa, humilitas, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactio, ceremonia, abſolutio, myſterium, peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>To the reign of Edward the ſixth belongs Arthur Kelton, a native of Shropſhire or Wales. He wrote the CRONICLE OF
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0373600103:310"/>
THE BRUTES in Engliſh verſe. It is dedicated to the young king, who ſeems to have been the general patron; and was printed in 1547 <note n="k" place="bottom">Lond. Octavo. Pr. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"In the golden time when all things."</q>
               </note>. Wood allows that he was an able antiquary; but laments, that he <q rend="inline margQuotes">"being withall poetically given, muſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth write and publiſh his lucubrations in verſe; whereby, for rhime's ſake, many material matters, and the due timing of them, are omitted, and ſo conſequently rejected by hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians and antiquarians <note n="l" place="bottom">ATH. OXON. i. 73.</note>."</q> Yet he has not ſupplied his want of genealogical and hiſtorical preciſion with thoſe ſtrokes of poetry which his ſubject ſuggeſted; nor has his imagination been any impediment to his accuracy. At the end of his CRONICLE is the GENEALOGY OF THE BRUTES, in which the pedigree of king Edward the ſixth is lineally drawn through thirty-two ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, from Oſiris the firſt king of Egypt. Here too Wood reproaches our author for his ignorance in genealogy. But in an heraldic enquiry, ſo difficult and ſo new, many miſtakes are pardonable. It is extraordinary that a Welſhman ſhould have carried his genealogical reſearches into Egypt, or rather ſhould have wiſhed to prove that Edward was deſcended from Oſiris: but this was with a deſign to ſhew, that the Egyptian monarch was the original progen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Without patronage and without readers, I may add without models, the earlier Italian writers, while their country was ſhook by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine tumults of the Guelfes and Guibelines, continued to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce original compoſitions both in proſe and verſe, which yet ſtand unrivalled. The age of Pericles and of the Peloponneſian war was the ſame. Careleſs of thoſe who governed or diſturbed the world, and ſuperior to the calamities of a quarrel in which two mighty leaders contended for the prize of univerſal domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, Lucretius wrote his ſublime didactic poem on the ſyſtem of nature, Virgil his bucolics, and Cicero his books of philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.

At both univerſities he became celebrated as a Latin and Engliſh poet; and he carried his love of poetry, which he ſeems to have almoſt ſolely cultivated, to the Inner Temple. It was now faſhionable for every young man of fortune, before he began his travels, or was admitted into parliament, to be initiated in the ſtudy of the law. But inſtead of purſuing a ſcience, which could not be his profeſſion, and which was unaccommodated to the bias of his genius, he betrayed his predilection to a more pleaſing ſpecies of literature, by compoſing the tragedy juſt mentioned, for the entertainment and honour of his fellow-ſtudents. His high birth, however, and ample patrimony, ſoon advanced him to more important ſituations and employments. His eminent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments and abilities having acquired the confidence and eſteem of queen Eliſabeth, the poet was ſoon loſt in the ſtateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and negotiations and embaſſies extinguiſhed the milder ambitions of the ingenuous Muſe.

Nor is it foreign to our purpoſe to remark, that his original elegance and brilliancy of mind ſometimes broke forth, in the exerciſe of his more formal political functions.

            <p>About the year 1557, he formed the plan of a poem, in which all the illuſtrious but unfortunate characters of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh hiſtory, from the conqueſt to the end of the fourteenth century, were to paſs in review before the poet, who deſcends like Dante into the infernal region, and is conducted by SORROW. Although a deſcent into hell had been ſuggeſted by other poets, the application of ſuch a fiction to the preſent deſign, is a conſpicuous proof of genius and even of invention. Every perſonage was to recite his own misfortunes in a ſeparate ſoliloquy. But Sackville had leiſure only to finiſh a poetical preface called an INDUCTION, and one legend, which is the life of Henry Stafford duke of Buckingham. Relinquiſhing therefore the deſign abruptly, and haſtily adapting the cloſe of his INDUCTION to the appearance of Buckingham, the only ſtory he had yet written, and which was to have been the laſt in his ſeries, he recommended the completion of the whole to Richard Baldwyne and George Ferrers.</p>
            <p>Baldwyne ſeems to have been graduated at Oxford about the year 1532. He was an eccleſiaſtic, and engaged in the education of youth.

            <p>Here we ſee that a company was feigned to be aſſembled, each of which, one excepted, by turns perſonates a character of one of the great Unfortunate: and that the ſtories were all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected, by being related to the ſilent perſon of the aſſembly, who is like the chorus in the Greek tragedies, or the Hoſt in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. The whole was to form a ſort of dramatic interlude, including a ſeries of independent ſoliloquies. A continuity to this imagined repreſentation is preſerved by the introduction, after every ſoliloquy, of a proſe epilogue, which alſo ſerves as a prologue to the ſucceeding piece, and has the air of a ſtage-direction. Boccace had done this before. We have this interpoſition, which I give as a ſpecimen, and which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains the method of the recital, between the tragedies of king RICHARD THE SECOND and OWEN GLENDOUR. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Whan he had ended this ſo wofull a tragedye, and to all PRINCES a right worthy inſtruction, we pauſed: having paſſed through a miſerable tyme, full of pyteous tragedyes.

You mynd ſo much ſome other belyke, that thoſe do not move you. And to ſay the trouth, there is no ſpecial cauſe why they ſhould. Howbeyt Owen Glendoure, becaus he was one of Fortune's darlynges, rather than he ſhould be forgotten, I will tel his tale for him, under the privelidge of Martine hundred.

            <p>Nothing more fully illuſtrates and aſcertains the reſpective merits and genius of different poets, than a juxtapoſition of their performances on ſimilar ſubjects. Having examined at large Sackville's Deſcent into Hell, for the ſake of throwing a ſtill ſtronger light on his manner of treating a fiction which gives ſo large a ſcope to fancy, I ſhall employ the remainder of this Section in ſetting before my reader a general view of Dante's Italian poem, entitled COMMEDIA, containing a deſcription of Hell, Paradiſe, and Purgatory, and written about the year 1310.

            <p>Dante, under the conduct of Virgil, penetrates hell. But he does not on this occaſion always avail himſelf of Virgil's deſcriptions and mythologies.

            <p>I have not time to follow Dante regularly through his dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues and adventures with the crouds of ghoſts, antient and modern, which he meets in the courſe of this infernal journey. In theſe interviews, there is often much of the party and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics of his own times, and of alluſion to recent facts. Nor have I leiſure particularly to diſplay our author's puniſhments and phantoms. I obſerve in general, that the ground-work of his hell is claſſical, yet with many Gothic and extravagant innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The burning lakes, the foſſes, and fiery towers which ſurround the city of DIS, and the three Furies which wait at its entrance, are touched with new ſtrokes <note n="s" place="bottom">See CANT. ix. vii.</note>. The Gorgons, the Hydra, the Chimera, Cerberus, the ſerpent of Lerna, and the reſt of Virgil's, or rather Homer's, infernal apparitions, are dilated with new touches of the terrible, and ſometimes made ridiculous by the addition of comic or incongruous circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, yet without any intention of burleſque. Becauſe Virgil had mentioned the Harpies in a ſingle word only <note n="t" place="bottom">Gorgones, HARPYIAEQUE. vi. 289.</note>, in one of the lothſome groves which Dante paſſes, conſiſting of trees whoſe leaves are black, and whoſe knotted boughs are hard as iron, the Harpies build their neſts <note n="u" place="bottom">CANT. xiii.</note>.</p>

appears in the ſhape of a Centaur covered with curling ſnakes, and on whoſe neck is perched a dragon hovering with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded wings <note n="w" place="bottom">CANT. xxv.</note>. It is ſuppoſed that Dante took the idea of his INFERNO from a magnificent nightly repreſentation of hell, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by the pope in honour of the biſhop of Oſtia on the river Arno at Florence, in the year 1304. This is mentioned by the Italian critics in extenuation of Dante's choice of ſo ſtrange a ſubject. But why ſhould we attempt to excuſe any abſurdity in the writings or manners of the middle ages? Dante choſe this ſubject as a reader of Virgil and Homer. The religious MYSTERY repreſented on the river Arno, however magnificent, was perhaps a ſpectacle purely orthodox, and perfectly conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the ideas of the church. And if we allow that it might hint the ſubject, with all its inconſiſtencies, it never could have furniſhed any conſiderable part of this wonderful compound of claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical and romantic fancy, of pagan and chriſtian theology, of real and fictitious hiſtory, of tragical and comic incidents, of fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar and heroic manners, and of ſatirical and ſublime poetry. But the groſſeſt improprieties of this poem diſcover an origina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of invention, and its abſurdities often border on ſublimity. We are ſurpriſed that a poet ſhould write one hundred cantos on hell, paradiſe, and purgatory. But this prolixity is partly owing to the want of art and method: and is common to all early compoſitions, in which every thing is related circumſtantially and without rejection, and not in thoſe general terms which are uſed by modern writers.</p>
            <p>Dante has beautifully enlarged Virgil's ſhort compariſon of the ſouls lingering on the banks of Lethe, to the numerous leaves falling from the trees in Autumn.</p>

            <p>Among many others of his friends, he ſees Franciſca the daughter of Guido di Polenta, in whoſe palace Dante died at Ravenna, and Paulo one of the ſons of Malateſta lord of Rimini. This lady fell in love with Paulo; the paſſion was mutual, and ſhe was betrothed to him in marriage: but her family choſe rather that ſhe ſhould be married to Lanciotto, Paulo's eldeſt brother. This match had the moſt fatal conſequences. The injured lovers could not diſſemble or ſtifle their affection: they were ſurpriſed, and both aſſaſſinated by Lanciotto. Dante finds the ſhades of theſe diſtinguiſhed victims of an unfortunate attachment at a diſtance from the reſt, in a region of his IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FERNO deſolated by the moſt violent tempeſts. He accoſts them both, and Franciſca relates their hiſtory: yet the converſation is carried on with ſome difficulty, on account of the impetuoſity of the ſtorm which was perpetually raging. Dante, who from many circumſtances of his own amours, appears to have poſſeſſed the moſt refined ſenſibilities about the delicacies of love, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires in what manner, when in the other world, they firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated their paſſion to each other. Franciſca anſwers, that they were one day ſitting together, and reading the romance of LANCELOT; where two lovers were repreſented in the ſame critical ſituation with themſelves. Their changes of colour and countenance, while they were reading, often tacitly betrayed
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0373600103:347"/>
their yet undiſcovered feelings. When they came to that paſſage in the romance, where the lovers, after many tender approaches, are gradually drawn by one uniform reciprocation of involuntary attraction to kiſs each other, the book dropped from their hands. By a ſudden impulſe and an irreſiſtible ſympathy, they are tempted to do the ſame. Here was the commencement of their tragical hiſtory.</p>

Milton, has its origin in the legendary hell of the monks. The hint ſeems to have been taken from an obſcure text in the Book of JOB, dilated by ſaint Jerom and the early commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators <note n="r" place="bottom">JOB, xxiv. 19.</note>. The torments of hell, in which the puniſhment by cold is painted at large, had formed a viſionary romance, under the name of ſaint Patrick's Purgatory or Cave, long before Dante wrote <note n="s" place="bottom">See ſupr. vol. ii. 199.

And ESSAY ON POPE, p. 254.</note>. It is not improbable, that the ſhades of unfortunate men, who deſcribed under peculiar ſituations and with their proper attributes, are introduced relating at large their hiſtories in hell to Dante, might have given the hint to Boccace's book DE CASIBUS VIRORUM ILLUSTRIUM, On the Misfortunes of Illuſtrious Perſonages, the original model of the MIRROUR OF MAGISTRATES.</p>
            <p>Dante's PURGATORY is not on the whole leſs fantaſtic than his HELL. As his hell was a vaſt perpendicular cavity in the earth, he ſuppoſes Purgatory to be a cylindric maſs elevated to a prodigious height. At intervals are receſſes projecting from the outſide of the cylinder. In theſe receſſes, ſome higher and ſome lower, the wicked expiate their crimes, according to the proportion of their guilt. From one department they paſs to another by ſteps of ſtone exceedingly ſteep. On the top of the whole, or the ſummit of Purgatory, is a plat-form adorned with trees and vegetables of every kind. This is the Terreſtrial Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, which has been tranſported hither we know not how, and which forms an avenue to the Paradiſe Celeſtial. It is extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary that ſome of the Gothic painters ſhould not have given us this ſubject.</p>
            <p>Dante deſcribes not diſagreeably the firſt region which he traverſes on leaving Hell. The heavens are tinged with ſapphire, and the ſtar of love, or the ſun, makes all the orient laugh. He ſees a venerable ſage approach. This is Cato of Utica, who, aſtoniſhed to ſee a living man in the manſion of ghoſts, queſtions Dante and Virgil about the buſineſs which brought them hither. <note place="bottom">
                  <hi rend="sup">y</hi> PURGAT. CANT. i.</note>
               <pb n="252" facs="tcp:0373600103:356"/>
Virgil anſwers: and Cato adviſes Virgil to waſh Dante's face, which was ſoiled with the ſmoak of hell, and to cover his head with one of the reeds which grew on the borders of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring river. Virgil takes his advice; and having gathered one reed, ſees another ſpring up in its place. This is the golden bough of the Eneid, <hi>uno avulſo non deficit alter.</hi> The ſhades alſo, as in Virgil, croud to be ferried over Styx: but an angel performs the office of Charon, admitting ſome into the boat, and rejecting others. This confuſion of fable and religion deſtroys the graces of the one and the majeſty of the other.</p>
            <p>Through adventures and ſcenes more ſtrange and wild than any in the Pilgrim's Progreſs, we at length arrive at the twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firſt Canto. A concuſſion of the earth announces the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of a ſoul from Purgatory. This is the ſoul of Statius, the favorite poet of the dark ages. Although a very improper companion for Virgil, he immediately joins our adventurers, and accompanies them in their progreſs. It is difficult to diſcover what pagan or chriſtian idea regulates Dante's diſpenſation of rewards and puniſhments. Statius paſſes from Purgatory to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, Cato remains in the place of expiation, and Virgil is condemned to eternal torments.</p>
            <p>Dante meets his old acquaintance Foreſe, a debauchee of Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. On finiſhing the converſation, Foreſe aſks Dante when he ſhall have the pleaſure of ſeeing him again. This queſtion in Purgatory is diverting enough. Dante anſwers with much ſerious gravity, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I know not the time of death: but it cannot be too near. Look back on the troubles in which my country is involved <note n="z" place="bottom">CANT. xxiv.</note>!"</q> The diſpute between the pontificate and the empire, appears to have been the predominant topic of Dante's mind. This circumſtance has filled Dante's poem with ſtrokes of ſatire. Every reader of Voltaire muſt remember that lively writer's paraphraſe from the INFERNO, of the ſtory of count Guido, in which are theſe inimitable lines. A Franciſcan friar abandoned to Beelzebub thus exclaims.</p>

            <p>Dante thus tranſlated would have had many more readers than at preſent. I take this opportunity of remarking, that our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's perpetual reference to recent facts and characters is in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Virgil, yet with this very material difference. The perſons recogniſed in Virgil's ſixth book, for inſtance the chiefs of the Trojan war, are the cotemporaries of the hero not of the poet. The truth is, Dante's poem is a ſatirical hiſtory of his own times.</p>
            <p>Dante ſees ſome of the ghoſts of Purgatory advancing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, more meagre and emaciated than the reſt. He aſks how this could happen in a place where all live alike without nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment. Virgil quotes the example of Meleager, who waſted with a firebrand, on the gradual extinction of which his life de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended. He alſo produces the compariſon of a mirror reflecting a figure. Theſe obſcure explications do not ſatisfy the doubts of Dante. Statius, for his better inſtruction, explains how a child grows in the womb of the mother, how it is enlarged, and by degrees receives life and intellect. The drift of our
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0373600103:358"/>
author is apparent in theſe profound illuſtrations. He means to ſhew his ſkill in a ſort of metaphyſical anatomy. We ſee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this in the TESORETTO of Brunetto. Unintelligible ſolutions of a ſimilar ſort, drawn from a frivolous and myſterious philoſophy, mark the writers of Dante's age.</p>
            <p>The PARADISE of Dante, the third part of this poem, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles his PURGATORY. Its fictions, and its allegories which ſuffer by being explained, are all conceived in the ſame chimerical ſpirit. The poet ſucceſſively views the glory of the ſaints, of angels, of the holy Virgin, and at laſt of God himſelf.</p>
            <p>Heaven as well as hell, among the monks, had its legendary deſcription; which it was hereſy to diſbelieve, and which was formed on perverſions or miſinterpretations of ſcripture. Our author's viſion ends with the deity, and we know not by what miraculous aſſiſtance he returns to earth.</p>
            <p>It muſt be allowed, that the ſcenes of Virgil's ſixth book have many fine ſtrokes of the terrible. But Dante's colouring is of a more gloomy temperature. There is a ſombrous caſt in his imagination: and he has given new ſhades of horror to the claſſical hell. We may ſay of Dante, that
<q>
                  <l>—Hell</l>
                  <l>Grows DARKER at his FROWN <note n="a" place="bottom">PAR. L. ii. 720.</note>.—</l>
               </q>
The ſenſations of fear impreſſed by the Roman poet are leſs harraſſing to the repoſe of the mind: they have a more equable and placid effect. The terror of Virgil's tremendous objects is diminiſhed by correctneſs of compoſition and elegance of ſtyle. We are reconciled to his Gorgons and Hydras, by the grace of expreſſion, and the charms of verſification.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, it may ſeem a matter of ſurpriſe, that the Italian poets of the thirteenth century who reſtored, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, and ſtudied the claſſics, did not imitate their beauties. But while they poſſeſſed the genuine models of antiquity, their
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0373600103:359"/>
unnatural and eccentric habits of mind and manners, their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments to ſyſtem, their ſcholaſtic theology, ſuperſtition, ideal love, and above all their chivalry, had corrupted every true princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of life and literature, and conſequently prevented the progreſs of taſte and propriety. They could not conform to the practices and notions of their own age, and to the ideas of the antients, at the ſame time. They were dazzled with the imageries of Virgil and Homer, which they could not always underſtand or apply: or which they ſaw through the miſt of prejudice and miſconception. Their genius having once taken a falſe direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when recalled to copy a juſt pattern, produced only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint and affectation, a diſtorted and unpleaſing reſemblance. The early Italian poets disfigured, inſtead of adorning thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> works, by attempting to imitate the claſſics. The charms which we ſo much admire in Dante, do not belong to the Greeks and Romans. They are derived from another origin, and muſt be traced back to a different ſtock. Nor is it at the ſame time leſs ſurpriſing, that the later Italian poets, in more enlightened times, ſhould have paid ſo reſpectful a compliment to Dante as to acknowledge no other model, and with his excellencies, to tranſcribe and perpetuate all his extravagancies.</p>

It is impoſſible that ſoliloquies of ſuch prolixity, and deſigned to include much hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical and even biographical matter, ſhould every where ſuſtain a proper degree of ſpirit, pathos, and intereſt.

            <p>Many compariſons are introduced by the diſtreſſed ſpeaker.

The captive Proteus has his ſimile of the nightingale; and Eneas decorates his narrative of the diſaſtrous conflagration of Troy with a variety of the moſt laboured compariſons.</p>
            <p>Buckingham in his reproaches againſt the traiterous behaviour of his antient friend Banaſtre, utters this forcible exclamation, which breathes the genuine ſpirit of revenge, and is unloaded with poetical ſuperfluities.</p>

            <p>If internal evidence was not a proof, we are ſure from other evidences that Shakeſpeare's tragedy preceded Niccols's legend. The tragedy was written about 1597.

He retired to Magdalene Hall, where he was graduated in Arts, 1606. Ibid.</note>. It is eaſy to point out other marks of imitation. Shakeſpeare has taken nothing from Seagars's Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard the third, printed in Baldwine's collection, or firſt edition, in the year 1559.

            <p>That it ſhould have been the object even of an ingenious ſatiriſt, is ſo far from proving that it wanted either merit or popularity, that the contrary concluſion may be juſtly inferred.

in a general criticiſm on the ſtyle of our moſt noted poets before the year 1600, places the MIRROUR OF MAGISTRATES in a high rank. It is under that head of his HYPERCRITICA, entitled <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Prime Gardens for gathering Engliſh according to the true gage or ſtandard of the tongue about fifteen or ſixteen years ago."</q> The extract is a curious piece of criticiſm, as writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by a judicious cotemporary. Having mentioned our proſe writers, the chief of which are More, Sidney, queen Eliſabeth, Hooker, Saville, cardinal Alan, Bacon, and Raleigh, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds thus. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"In verſe there are Edmund Spenſer's HYMNES <note n="c" place="bottom">The pieces mentioned in this extract will be conſidered in their proper places.</note>. I cannot adviſe the allowance of other his poems as for practick Engliſh, no more than I can Jeffrey Chaucer, Lydgate, Pierce Plowman, or LAUREATE Skelton. It was laid as a fault to the charge of Saluſt, that he uſed ſome old outworn words ſtoln out of Cato in his books de Originibus. And for an hiſtorian in our tongue to affect the like out of thoſe our poets, would be accounted a foul overſight.—My judgement is nothing at all in poems or poeſie, and therefore I dare not go far; but will ſimply deliver my mind concerning thoſe authors among us, whoſe Engliſh hath in my conceit moſt propriety, and is neareſt to the phraſe of court, and to the ſpeech uſed among the noble, and among the better ſort in London: the two ſovereign ſeats, and as it were parliament tribunals, to try the queſtion in.

Michael Drayton's Heroical Epiſtles are well worth the reading alſo for the purpoſe of our ſubject, which is to furniſh an Engliſh hiſtorian with choice and copy of tongue. Queen Elizabeth's verſes, thoſe which I have ſeen and read, ſome exſtant in the elegant, witty, and artificial book of the ART OF ENGLISH POETRIE, the work, as the fame is, of one of her gentlemen-penſioners, Puttenham, are princely as her proſe. Never muſt be forgotten St. PETER'S COMPLAINT, and thoſe other ſerious poems ſaid to be father Southwell's: the Engliſh whereof, as it is moſt proper, ſo the ſharpneſs and light of wit is very rare in them. Noble Henry Conſtable was a great maſter in Engliſh tongue, nor had any gentleman of our nation a more pure, quick, or higher delivery of conceit, witneſs among all other that Sonnet of his before his Majeſty's LEPANTO. I have not ſeen much of ſir Edward Dyer's poetry. Among the leſſer late poets, George Gaſcoigne's Works may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured.

But before in age, if not alſo in noble, courtly, and luſtrous Engliſh, is that of the Songes and Sonnettes of Henry Howard earl of Surrey, (ſon of that victorious prince, the duke of Norfolk, and father of that learned Howard his moſt lively image Henry earl of Northampton,) written chiefly by him, and by ſir Thomas Wiat, not the dangerous commotioner, but his worthy father.

The Engliſh poems of ſir Walter Raleigh, of John Donne, of Hugh Holland, but eſpecially of ſir Foulk Grevile in his matchleſs MUSTAPHA, are not eaſily to be mended. I dare not preſume to ſpeak of his Majeſty's exerciſes in this heroick kind.

            <p>It is reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that the publication of the MIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ROUR OF MAGISTRATES enriched the ſtores, and extended the limits, of our drama. Theſe lives are ſo many tragical ſpeeches in character. We have ſeen, that they ſuggeſted ſcenes to Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare. Some critics imagine, that HISTORICAL Plays owed their origin to this collection. At leaſt it is certain, that the writers of this MIRROUR were the firſt who made a poetical uſe of the Engliſh chronicles recently compiled by Fabyan, Hall, and Hollinſhed, which opened a new field of ſubjects and events; and, I may add, produced a great revolution in the ſtate of popular knowledge. For before thoſe elaborate and volumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous compilations appeared, the Hiſtory of England, which had been ſhut up in the Latin narratives of the monkiſh annaliſts, was unfamiliar and almoſt unknown to the general reader.</p>

            <p>When queen Eliſabeth viſited Oxford in 1566, ſhe was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by Edwards, who was on this occaſion employed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a play called PALAMON AND ARCITE, which was acted before her majeſty in Chriſt-church hall <note n="d" place="bottom">See ſupr. vol. ii. 382.</note>. I believe it was never printed. Another of his plays is DAMON AND PYTHIAS, which was acted at court.

The word Interlude is here of wide extent. For Edwards, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that he was a writer of regular dramas, appears to have been a contriver of maſques, and a compoſer of poetry for pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants. In a word, he united all thoſe arts and accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which miniſter to popular pleaſantry: he was the firſt fiddle, the moſt faſhionable ſonnetteer, the readieſt rhymer, and the moſt facetious mimic, of the court. In conſequence of his love and his knowledge of the hiſtrionic art, he taught the choriſters over which he preſided to act plays; and they were formed into a company of players, like thoſe of ſaint Paul's cathedral, by the queen's licence, under the ſuperintendency of Edwards <note n="h" place="bottom">See ſupr. vol. ii. 393.</note>.</p>

            <p>ABOUT the ſame time flouriſhed Thomas Tuſſer, one of our earlieſt didactic poets, in a ſcience of the higheſt uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and which produced one of the moſt beautiful poems of antiquity.

            <p>He was born of an antient family, about the year 1523, at Rivenhall in Eſſex; and was placed as a choriſter, or ſinging<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boy, in the collegiate chapel of the caſtle of Wallingford in Berkſhire <note n="a" place="bottom">This chapel had a dean, ſix preben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries, ſix clerks, and four choriſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Before I proceed, I muſt ſay a few words concerning the very remarkable practice implied in theſe ſtanzas, of ſeizing boys by a warrant for the ſervice of the king's chapel. Strype has printed an abſtract of an inſtrument, by which it appears, that emiſſaries were diſpatched into various parts of England with full powers to take boys from any choir for the uſe of the chapel of king Edward the ſixth. Under the year 1550, ſays Strype, there was a grant of a commiſſion <q rend="inline margQuotes">"to Philip Van Wilder gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of the Privy Chamber, in anie churches or chappells within England to take to the king's uſe, ſuch and as many

As the word Minſtrel is of an extenſive ſignification, and is applied as a general term to every character of that ſpecies of men whoſe buſineſs it was to entertain, either with oral recitation, muſic, geſticulation, and ſinging, or with a mixture of all theſe arts united, it is certainly difficult to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, whether ſingers only, more particularly ſingers for the royal chapel, were here intended.

            <p>It muſt be acknowledged, that this old Engliſh georgic has much more of the ſimplicity of Heſiod, than of the elegance of Virgil: and a modern reader would ſuſpect, that many of its ſalutary maxims originally decorated the margins, and illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated the calendars, of an antient almanac. It is without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations, digreſſions, and deſcriptions: no pleaſing pictures of rural imagery are drawn from meadows covered with flocks and fields waving with corn, nor are Pan and Ceres once named. Yet it is valuable, as a genuine picture of the agriculture, the rural arts, and the domeſtic economy and cuſtoms, of our induſtrious anceſtors.</p>

            <p>AMONG Antony Wood's manuſcripts in the Bodleian library at Oxford, I find a poem of conſiderable length written by William Forreſt, chaplain to queen Mary <note n="a" place="bottom">In folio. MSS. Cod. A. Wood. Num. 2. They were purchaſed by the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity after Wood's death.</note>. It is entitled, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"A true and moſt notable Hiſtory of a right noble and famous Lady produced in Spayne entitled the ſecond GRESIELD, practiſed not long out of this time in much part tragedous as delectable both to hearers and readers."</q> This is a panegyrical hiſtory in octave rhyme, of the life of queen Catharine, the firſt queen of king Henry the eighth. The poet compares Catharine to patient Griſild, celebrated by Petrarch and Chaucer, and Henry to earl Walter her huſband <note n="b" place="bottom">The affecting ſtory of PATIENT GRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SILD ſeems to have long kept up its cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brity.

Catha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine had certainly the patience and conjugal compliance of Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſild: but Henry's cruelty was not, like Walter's, only artificial and aſſumed. It is dedicated to queen Mary: and Wood's ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript, which was once very ſuperbly bound and emboſſed, and is elegantly written on vellum, evidently appears to have been the book preſented by the author to her majeſty. Much of its antient finery is tarniſhed: but on the braſs boſſes at each corner is ſtill diſcernible AVE, MARIA GRATIA PLENA. At the end
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:0373600103:416"/>
is this colophon. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Here endeth the Hiſtorye of Gryſilde the ſecond, dulie meanyng Queene Catharine mother to our moſt dread ſoveraigne Lady queene Mary, fynyſched the xxv day of June, the yeare of owre Lorde 1558. By the ſymple and unlearned Syr Wylliam Forreſt preeiſte, propria manu."</q> The poem, which conſiſts of twenty chapters, contains a zealous condemnation of Henry's divorce: and, I believe, preſerves ſome anecdotes, yet apparently miſrepreſented by the writer's religious and political bigotry, not extant in any of our printed hiſtories. Forreſt was a ſtudent at Oxford, at the time when this notable and knotty point of caſuiſtry proſtituted the learning of all the univerſities of Europe, to the gratification of the capricious amours of a libidinous and implacable tyrant. He has recorded many particulars and local incidents of what paſſed in Oxford during that tranſaction <note n="c" place="bottom">In the firſt chapter, he thus ſpeaks of the towardlineſs of the princeſs Catha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine's younger years.

            <p>In the Britiſh Muſeum is another of Forreſt's poems, written in two ſplendid folio volumes on vellum, called <q rend="inline margQuotes">"The tragedious troubles of the moſt chaſt and innocent Joſeph, ſon to the holy patriarch Jacob,"</q> and dedicated to Thomas Howard duke of Norfolk <note n="d" place="bottom">MSS.

Many more of his manuſcript pieces both in proſe and verſe, all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſional and of the religious kind, were in the hands of Robert earl of Aileſbury <note n="h" place="bottom">Wood, ATH.

Forreſt, who muſt have been living at Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, as appears from his poem on queen Catharine, ſo early as the year 1530, was in reception of an annual penſion of ſix pounds from Chriſt-church in that univerſity, in the year 1555 <note n="i" place="bottom">MSS. Le Neve. From a long chapter in his KATHARINE, about the building of Chriſt-church and the regimen of it, he appears to have been of that college.</note>. He was eminently ſkilled in muſic: and with much diligence and expence, he collected the works of the moſt excellent Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh compoſers, that were his cotemporaries. Theſe, being the choiceſt compoſitions, of John Taverner of Boſton, organiſt of Cardinal-college now Chriſt-church at Oxford, John Merbeck who firſt digeſted our preſent church-ſervice from the notes of the Roman miſſal, Fairfax, Tye, Sheppard, Norman, and others, falling after Forreſt's death into the poſſeſſion of doctor Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Hether, founder of the muſical praxis and profeſſorſhip at

            <p>In the year 1554, a poem of two ſheets, in the ſpirit and ſtanza of Sternhold, was printed under the title, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"The VN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GODLINESSE OF THE HETHNICKE GODDES, or <hi>The Down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall of Diana of the Ephe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The writer, whoſe arguments are as weak as his poetry, attempts to prove, that the cuſtomary mode of training youths in the Roman poets encouraged idolatry and pagan ſuperſtition. This was a topic much laboured by the puritans. Prynne, in that chapter of his HISTRIOMASTIX, where he expoſes <q rend="inline margQuotes">"the obſcenity, ribaldry, amorouſneſſe, HEA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THENISHNESSE, and prophaneſſe, of moſt play-bookes, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadias, and fained hiſtories that are now ſo much in admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,"</q> acquaints us, that the infallible leaders of the puritan perſuaſion in the reign of queen Eliſabeth, among which are two biſhops, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Hollingſhead mentions Lucas Shepherd of Colcheſter, as an eminent poet of queen Mary's reign <note n="p" place="bottom">CHRON. vol. iii. p. 1168.</note>. I do not pretend to any great talents for decyphering; but I preſume, that this is the ſame perſon who is called by Bale, from a moſt injudicious affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Latinity, Lucas OPILIO. Bale affirms, that his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary, Opilio, was a very facetious poet: and means to pay him a ſtill higher compliment in pronouncing him not inferior even to Skelton for his rhimes <note n="q" place="bottom">Par. poſt. p. 109.</note>. It is unlucky, that Bale, by diſguiſing his name, ſhould have contributed to conceal this writer ſo long from the notice of poſterity, and even to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teract his own partiality. Lucas Shepherd, however, appears to have been nothing more than a petty pamphleteer in the cauſe of Calviniſm, and to have acquired the character of a poet from a metrical tranſlation of ſome of David's Pſalms about the year 1554. Bale's narrow prejudices are well known. The puritans never ſuſpected that they were greater bigots than the papiſts. I believe one or two of Shepherd's pieces in proſe are among biſhop Tanner's books at Oxford.</p>
            <p>Bale alſo mentions metrical Engliſh verſions of ECCLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIASTES, of the hiſtories of ESTHER, SUSANNAH, JUDITH, and of the TESTAMENT OF THE TWELVE PATRIARCHS, printed and written about this period, by John Pullaine, one of the original ſtudents of Chriſt-church at Oxford, and at length archdeacon of Colcheſter.

At the general reſtoration of knowledge and taſte, it was a great impediment to the progreſs of our language, that all the learned and ingenious, aiming at the character of erudition, wrote in Latin. Engliſh books were written only by the ſuperficial and illiterate, at a time when judgment and genius ſhould have been exerted in the nice and critical taſk of poliſhing a rude ſpeech. Long after the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of typography, our vernacular ſtyle, inſtead of being ſtrengthened and refined by numerous compoſitions, was only corrupted with new barbariſms and affectations, for want of able and judicious writers in Engliſh. Unleſs we except ſir Thomas More, whoſe DIALOGUE ON TRIBULATION, and HISTORY OF RICHARD THE THIRD, were eſteemed ſtandards of ſtyle ſo low as the reign of James the firſt, Roger Aſcham was perhaps the firſt of our ſcholars who ventured to break the ſhackles of Latinity, by publiſhing his TOXOPHILUS in Engliſh; chiefly with a view of giving a pure and correct model of Engliſh compoſition, or rather of ſhewing how a ſubject might be treated with grace and propriety in En<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>liſh as well as in Latin. His own vindication of his conduct in attempting this great innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is too ſenſible to be omitted, and reflects light on the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of our poetry. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"As for the Lattine or Greeke tongue, euerye thinge is ſo excellentlye done in Them, that none can do better.

He that will write well in any tongue, muſt folow this counſell of Ariſtotle; to ſpeake as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people do, to thinke as wiſe men do. And ſo ſhoulde euerye man vnderſtand him, and the iudgement of wiſe men alowe him. Manye Engliſhe writers haue not done ſo; but vſinge ſtraunge wordes, as Lattine, French, and Italian, do make all thinges darke and harde.

Cicero in folowing Iſocrates, Plato, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes, encreaſed the Lattine tongue after another ſort. This way, becauſe diuers men that write do not know, they can neyther folow it becauſe of their ignoraunce, nor yet will prayſe it for uery arrogancy: two faultes ſeldome the one out of the others companye.

            <p>Aſcham's example was followed by other learned men. But the chief was Thomas Wilſon, who publiſhed a ſyſtem of LOGIC and RHETORIC both in Engliſh. Of his LOGIC I have already ſpoken. I have at preſent only to ſpeak of the latter, which is not only written in Engliſh, but with a view of giving rules for compoſing in the Engliſh language. It appeared in 1553, the firſt year of queen Mary, and is entitled, THE ARTE OF RHETORIKE <hi>for the vſe of all ſuche as are ſtudious of Eloquence, ſette forthe in Engliſhe by</hi> THOMAS WILSON <note n="c" place="bottom">Lond. 1553. 4to.

            <p>I muſt premiſe, that Wilſon, one of the moſt accompliſhed ſcholars of his times, was originally a fellow of King's Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege <note n="d" place="bottom">Admitted ſcholar in 1541. A native of Lincolnſhire. MS. Hatcher.</note>, where he was tutor to the two celebrated youths Henry and Charles Brandon dukes of Suffolk. Being a doctor of laws, he was afterwards one of the ordinary maſters of requeſts, maſter of ſaint Katharine's hoſpital near the Tower, a frequent embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador from queen Eliſabeth to Mary queen of Scots, and into the Low countries, a ſecretary of ſtate and a privy counſellor, and at length, in 1579, dean of Durham. He died in 1581. His remarkable diligence and diſpatch in negotiation is ſaid to have reſulted from an uncommon ſtrength of memory. It is another proof of his attention to the advancement of our Engliſh ſtyle, that he tranſlated ſeven orations of Demoſthenes, which, in 1570, he dedicated to ſir William Cecill <note n="e" place="bottom">Which had b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But the French had even an ART OF POETRY ſo early as the year 1548. In that year Thomas Sibilet publiſhed his <hi>Art poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique</hi> at Paris, <hi>Veuve</hi> François Regnault <note n="z" place="bottom">In 16mo.</note>. This piece preſerves many valuable anecdotes of the old French poetry: and, among other particulars which develope the ſtate of the old French drama, has the following ſenſible ſtrictures. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"The French farce contains little or nothing of the Latin comedy. It has neither acts nor ſcenes, which would only ſerve to introduce a tedious prolixity: for the true ſubject of the French farce, or SOTTIE, is every ſort of foolery which has a tendency to provoke laughter.—The ſubject of the Greek and Latin comedy was totally different from every thing on the French ſtage. For it had more morality than drollery, and often as much truth as fiction. Our MORALITIES hold a place in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently between tragedy and comedy: but our farces are
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:0373600103:453"/>
really what the Romans called mimes, or <hi>Priapées,</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended end and effect of which was exceſſive laughter, and on that account they admitted all kinds of licentiouſneſs, as our farces do at preſent. In the mean time, their pleaſantry does not derive much advantage from rhymes, however flowing, of eight ſyllables <note n="a" place="bottom">Liv. ii. ch. viii. At the end of Sibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let's work is a critical piece of Quintil againſt Ch. Fontaine, firſt printed ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately at Paris, 1538. 16mo.</note>."</q> Sibilet's work is chiefly founded on Horace. His definitions are clear and juſt, and his precepts well explained. The moſt curious part of it is the enumeration of the poets who in his time were of moſt repute. Jacques Pelletier du Mans, a phyſician, a mathematician, a poet, and a volumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous writer on various ſubjects both in proſe and verſe, alſo pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed an ART POETIQUE at Lyons, in 1555 <note n="b" place="bottom">By Jean de Tournes. 8vo.</note>. This critic had ſufficient penetration to perceive the falſe and corrupt taſte of his cotemporaries. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Inſtead of the regular ode and ſonnet, our language is ſophiſticated by <hi>ballads, roundeaux, lays,</hi> and <hi>triolets.</hi> But with theſe we muſt reſt contented, till the farces which have ſo long infatuated our nation are converted into comedy, our martyr-plays into tragedy, and our romances into heroic poems <note n="c" place="bottom">Ch. de L'ODE.</note>."</q> And again, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"We have no pieces in our language written in the genuine comic form, except ſome affected and unnatural MORALITIES, and other plays of the ſame character, which do not deſerve the name of comedy.

            <p>The Italian vernacular criticiſm began chiefly in commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and diſcourſes on the language and phraſeology of Dante, Petrarch, and Boccace. I believe one of the firſt of that kind is, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Le tre Fontane di Nicolò Liburnio ſopra la grammatica, e l'eloquenza di Dante, del Petrarcha, e del Boccacio.

Immediately after the publication of their reſpective poems, Arioſto, whoſe ORLANDO FURIOSO was ſtyled the <hi>nuova poeſia,</hi> and Taſſo, were illuſtrated or expounded by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators more intricate than their text.

But I reſign this labyrinth of reſearch to the ſuperior opportunities and abilities of the French and Italian antiquaries in their native literature. To have ſaid nothing on the ſubject might have been thought an omiſſion, and to have ſaid more, impertinent. I therefore return to our own poetical annals.</p>
            <p>Our three great poets, Chaucer, Gower, and Lydgate, ſeem to have maintained their rank, and to have been in high repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, during the period of which we are now treating. Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did impreſſions of large works were at this time great under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings. A ſumptuous edition of Gower's CONFESSIO AMANTIS was publiſhed by Berthelette in 1554.

I have before incidentally remarked <note n="n" place="bottom">See ſupr. vol. ii. p. 44.</note>, that Nicholas Briggam, a polite ſcholar, a ſtudent at Oxford and at the Inns of Court, and a writer of poetry, in the year 1555, depoſited the bones of Chaucer under a new tomb, erected at his own coſt, and inſcribed with a new epitaph, in the chapel of biſhop Blaſe in Weſtminſter abbey, which ſtill remains <note n="o" place="bottom">Undoubtedly Chaucer was originally buried in this place.

<pb n="354" facs="tcp:0373600103:456"/>
this muſt be reſtricted to the courtiers of Edward the ſixth. And indeed there is a peculiar reaſon why Chaucer, excluſive of his real excellence, ſhould have been the favorite of a court which laid the foundations of the reformation of religion. It was, that his poems abounded with ſatyrical ſtrokes againſt the corruptions of the church, and the diſſolute manners of the monks. And undoubtedly Chaucer long before, a lively and popular writer, greatly aſſiſted the doctrines of his cotemporary Wickliffe, in opening the eyes of the people to the abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of popery, and expoſing its impoſtures in a vein of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and pleaſantry. Fox the martyrologiſt, a weak and a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous compiler, perhaps goes too far in affirming, that Chaucer has undeniably proved the pope to be the antichriſt of the apocalypſe <note n="p" place="bottom">Tom. ii. p. 42. edit. 1684.</note>.</p>
            <p>Of the reign of queen Mary, we are accuſtomed to conceive every thing that is calamitous and diſguſting.

I believe it was printed before that of 1571, for it retains all the errors of Griffith's firſt or ſpurious edition of 1565. In the Preface prefixed to the edition of 1571, is the following paſſage. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Where [whereas] this tragedy was for furniture of part of the grand Chriſtmaſſe in the Inner-temple, firſt written about nine years ago by the right honourable Thomas now lord Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurſt, and by T. Norton; and afterwards ſhowed before her maieſtie, and neuer intended by the authors thereof to be publiſhed: Yet one W. G. getting a copie thereof at ſome young mans hand, that lacked a little money and much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, in the laſt great plague <hi>anno</hi> 1565, about fiue yeares paſt, while the ſaid lord was out of England, and T.

G. is William Grif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fith, the printer in Fleet ſtreet, abovementioned. Mr. Garrick had another old quarto edition, printed by Alde, in 1590.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the circumſtances of the fable of this tragedy. Gordobuc, a king of Britain about ſix hundred years before Chriſt, made in his life-time a diviſion of his kingdom to his ſons Ferrex and Porrex. The two young princes within five years quarrelled for univerſal ſovereignty. A civil was enſued, and Porrex <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lew his elder brother Ferrex. Their mother Viden, who loved Ferrex beſt, revenged his death by entering Porrex's chamber in the night, and murthering him in his ſleep. The people, exa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>perated at the cruelty and treachery of this murther, roſe in rebellion, and killed both Viden and Gordobuc. The nobility then aſſembled, collected an army, and deſtroyed the
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:0373600103:460"/>
rebels. An inteſtine war commenced between the chief lords: the ſucceſſion of the crown became uncertain and arbitrary, for want of the lineal royal iſſue: and the country, deſtitute of a king, and waſted by domeſtic ſlaughter, was reduced to a ſtate of the moſt miſerable deſolation.</p>
            <p>In the dramatic conduct of this tale, the unities of time and place are eminently and viſibly violated: a defect which Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare ſo frequently commits, but which he covers by the magic of his poetry. The greater part of this long and eventful hiſtory is included in the repreſentation. But in a ſtory ſo fertile of bloodſhed, no murther is committed on the ſtage. It is worthy of remark, that the death of Porrex in the bed-chamber is only related. Perhaps the players had not yet learned to die, nor was the ponyard ſo eſſential an article as at preſent among the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements of the property-room. Nor is it improbable, that to kill a man on the ſtage was not now avoided as a ſpectacle ſhocking to humanity, but becauſe it was difficult and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to be repreſented. The writer has followed the ſeries of facts related in the chronicles without any material varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or fictitious embarraſſments, and with the addition only of a few neceſſary and obvious characters.</p>
            <p>There is a Chorus of Four Antient and Sage Men of Britain, who regularly cloſe every Act, the laſt excepted, with an ode in long-lined ſtanzas, drawing back the attention of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the ſubſtance of what has juſt paſſed, and illuſtrating it by recapitulatory moral reflections, and poetical or hiſtorical alluſions. Of theſe the beſt is that which terminates the fourth Act, in which prince Porrex is murthered by his mother Viden. Theſe are the two firſt ſtanzas.</p>

            <p>Every Act is introduced, as was the cuſtom in our old plays, with a piece of machinery called the DUMB SHOW, ſhadowing by an allegorical exhibition the matter that was immediately to follow. In the conſtruction of this ſpectacle and its perſoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, much poetry and imagination was often diſplayed. It is ſome apology for theſe prefigurations, that they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly too myſterious and obſcure, to foreſtal the future events with any degree of clearneſs and preciſion. Not that this mute mimicry was always typical of the enſuing incidents. It ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſerved for a compendious introduction of ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, as could not commodiouſly be comprehended within the bounds of the repreſentation. It ſometimes ſupplied deficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and covered the want of buſineſs. Our anceſtors were eaſily ſatified with this artificial ſupplement of one of the moſt important unities, which abundantly filled up the interval that was neceſſary to paſs, while a hero was expected from the Holy Land, or a princeſs was imported, married, and brought to bed.
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:0373600103:463"/>
mean time, the greater part of the audience were probably more pleaſed with the emblematical pageantry than the poetical dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, although both were alike unintelligible.</p>
            <p>I will give a ſpecimen in the DOMME SHEWE preceding the fourth act. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Firſt, the muſick of howeboies began to plaie. Duringe whiche, there came forth from vnder the ſtage, as thoughe out of hell, three Furies, ALECTO, MEGERA, and CTESIPHONE <note n="n" place="bottom">Tiſiphone.</note>, clad in blacke garments ſprinkled with bloud and flames, their bodies girt with ſnakes, their heds ſpread with ſerpents inſtead of heare, the one bearing in her hande <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſnake the other a whip, and the thirde a burning firebrande: eche driuynge before them a kynge and a queene, which moued by Furies vnnaturally had ſlaine their owne children. The names of the kinges and queenes were theſe, TANTALUS, MEDEA, ATHAMAS, INO, CAMBISES, ALTHEA. After that the Furies, and theſe, had paſſed aboute the ſtage thriſe, they departed, and then the muſicke ceaſed. Hereby was ſignified the vnnaturall murders to followe, that is to ſaie, Porrex ſlaine by his owne mother. And of king Gordobuc and queene Viden killed by their owne ſubjectes."</q> Here, by the way, the viſionary proceſſion of kings and queens long ſince dead, evidently reſembles our author Sackville's original model of the MIRROUR OF MAGISTRATES; and, for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, reminds us of a ſimilar train of royal ſpectres in the tent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcene of Shakeſpeare's KING RICHARD THE THIRD.</p>
            <p>I take this opportunity of expreſſing my ſurpriſe, that this oſtenſible comment of the Dumb Shew ſhould not regularly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the tragedies of Shakeſpeare. There are even proofs that he treated it with contempt and ridicule. Although ſome critics are of opinion, that becauſe it is never deſcribed in form at the cloſe or commencement of his acts, it was therefore never introduced. Shakeſpeare's aim was to collect an audience, and for this purpoſe all the common expedients were neceſſary. No

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>matic writer of his age has more battles or ghoſts. His re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations abound with the uſual appendages of mechanical terror, and he adopts all the ſuperſtitions of the theatre. This problem can only be reſolved into the activity or the ſuperiority of a mind, which either would not be entangled by the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or which ſaw through the futility, of this unnatural and extrinſic ornament. It was not by declamation or by panto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mime that Shakeſpeare was to fix his eternal dominion over the hearts of mankind.</p>
            <p>To return to Sackville. That this tragedy was never a favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite among our anceſtors, and had long fallen into general obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion, is to be attributed to the nakedneſs and unintereſting nature of the plot, the tedious length of the ſpeeches, the want of a diſcrimination of character, and almoſt a total abſence of pathetic or critical ſituations. It is true that a mother kills her own ſon. But this act of barbarous and unnatural impiety, to ſay nothing of its almoſt unexampled atrocity in the tender ſex, proceeds only from a brutal principle of ſudden and impetuous revenge. It is not the conſequence of any deep machination, nor is it founded in a proper preparation of previous circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. She is never before introduced to our notice as a wicked or deſigning character. She murthers her ſon Porrex, becauſe in the commotions of a civil diſſenſion, in ſelf-defence, after repeated provocations, and the ſtrongeſt proofs of the baſeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude and treachery, he had ſlain his rival brother, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the deepeſt compunction and remorſe for what he had done. A mother murthering a ſon is a fact which muſt be received with horror; but it required to be complicated with other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and prompted by a cooperation of other cauſes, to rouſe our attention, and work upon our paſſions. I do not mean that any other motive could have been found, to palliate a murther of ſuch a nature. Yet it was poſſible to heighten and to divide the di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>treſs, by rendering this bloody mother, under the notions of human frailty, an object of our compaſſion as well as of our abhorrence. But perhaps theſe artifices were not yet known
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:0373600103:465"/>
or wanted. The general ſtory of the play is great in its political conſequences; and the leading incidents are important, but not ſufficiently intricate to awaken our curioſity, and hold us in ſuſpence. Nothing is perplexed and nothing unravelled. The oppoſition of intereſts is ſuch as does not affect our nicer feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. In the plot of a play, our pleaſure ariſes in proportion as our expectation is excited.</p>
            <p>Yet it muſt be granted, that the language of GORDOBUC has great purity and perſpicuity; and that it is entirely free from that tumid phraſeology, which does not ſeem to have taken place till play-writing had become a trade, and our poets found it their int<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>reſt to captivate the multitude by the falſe ſublime, and by thoſe exaggerated imageries and pedantic metaphors, which are the chief blemiſhes of the ſcenes of Shakeſpeare, and which are at this day miſtaken for his capital beauties by too many readers. Here alſo we perceive another and a ſtrong reaſon why this play was never popular.</p>
            <p>Sir Philip Sydney, in his admirable DEFENCE OF POESIE, remarks, that this tragedy is full of <hi>notable moralitie.</hi> But tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies are not to inſtruct us by the intermixture of moral ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, but by the force of example, and the effect of the ſtory. In the firſt act, the three counſellors are introduced debating about the diviſion of the kingdom in long and elaborate ſpeeches, which are replete with political advice and maxims of civil prudence. But this ſtately ſort of declamation, whatever elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence it may diſplay, and whatever policy it may teach, is undramatic, unanimated, and unaffecting. Sentiment and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will never ſupply the place of a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tion upon the ſtage. Not to mention, that theſe grave harangues have ſome tincture of the formal modes of addreſs, and the ceremonious oratory, which were then in faſhion. But we muſt allow, that in the ſtrain of dialogue in which they are profeſſedly written, they have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common merit, even without drawing an apology in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from their antiquity: and that they contain much dignity, ſtrength of reflection, and good ſenſe, couched in clear expreſſion

            <p>The illuſtration from Brutus is here both appoſite and poetical.</p>
            <p>Spence, with a reference to the ſituation of the author lord Buckhurſt in the court of queen Eliſabeth, has obſerved in his preface to the modern edition of this tragedy, that <q rend="inline margQuotes">"'tis no wonder, if the language of kings and ſtateſmen ſhould be leſs happily imitated by a poet than a privy counſellor."</q> This is an inſinuation that Shakeſpeare, who has left many hiſtorical tragedies, was leſs able to conduct ſome parts of a royal ſtory than the ſtateſman lord Buckhurſt. But I will venture to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, that whatever merit there is in this play, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in the ſpeeches we have juſt been examining, it is more owing to the poet than the privy counſellor. If a firſt miniſter was to write a tragedy, I believe the piece will be the better, the leſs it has of the firſt miniſter. When a ſtateſman turns poet, I ſhould not wiſh him to fetch his ideas or his language from the canbinet. I know not why a king ſhould be better qualified than a private man, to make kings talk in blank verſe.</p>

It is well known, that the Calviniſts carried their ideas of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and refinement into government as well as religion: and it ſeems probable, that theſe eight verſes were ſuppreſſed by Thomas Norton, Sackville's ſuppoſed aſſiſtant in the play, who was not only an active and I believe a ſenſible puritan, but a licencer of the publication of books under the commiſſion of the biſhop of London <note n="x" place="bottom">For inſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>As to Norton's aſſiſtance in this play, it is ſaid on better au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority than that of Antony Wood, who ſuppoſes GORDOBUC to have been in old Engliſh rhime, that the three firſt acts were written by Thomas Norton, and the two laſt by Sackville. But the force of internal evidence often prevails over the authority of aſſertion, a teſtimony which is diminiſhed by time, and may be rendered ſuſpicious from a variety of other circumſtances. Throughout the whole piece, there is an invariable uniformity of diction and verſification. Sackville has two poems of conſiderable

Thomas Norton's poetry is of a very different and a ſubordinate caſt: and if we may judge from his ſhare in our metrical pſalmody, he ſeems to have been much more properly qualified to ſhine in the miſerable mediocrity of Sternhold's ſtanza, and to write ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual rhymes for the ſolace of his illuminated brethren, than to reach the bold and impaſſioned elevations of tragedy.</p>

            <p>THIS appearance of a regular tragedy, with the diviſion of acts and ſcenes, and the accompaniment of the antient chorus, repreſented both at the Middle-temple and at Whitehall, and written by the moſt accompliſhed nobleman of the court of queen Eliſabeth, ſeems to have directed the attention of our more learned poets to the ſtudy of the old claſſical drama, and in a ſhort time to have produced vernacular verſions of the JOCASTA of Euripides, as it is called, and of the ten Tragedies of Seneca. I do not find that it was ſpeedily followed by any original compoſitions on the ſame legitimate model.</p>
            <p>The JOCASTA of Euripides was tranſlated by George Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coigne and Francis Kinwelmerſh, both ſtudents of Grays-inn, and acted in the refectory of that ſociety, in the year 1566. Gaſcoigne tranſlated the ſecond, third, and fifth acts, and Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welmerſh the firſt, and fourth. It was printed in Gaſcoigne's poems, of which more will be ſaid hereafter, in 1577, under the following title, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"JOCASTA, a Tragedie written in Greeke by Euripides. Tranſlated and digeſted into Acte, by George Gaſcoigne and Francis Kinwelmerſhe of Graies inn, and there by them preſented, An. 1566."</q> The Epilogue was written in quatraines by Chriſtopher Yelverton, then one of their bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtudents. So ſtrongly were our audiences ſtill attached to ſpectacle, that the authors did not venture to preſent their play, without introducing a DUMB SHEW at the beginning of every act. For this, however, they had the example and authority of GORDOBUC. Some of the earlieſt ſpecimens of Inigo Jones's Grecian architecture are marred by Gothic ornaments.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="373" facs="tcp:0373600103:477"/>
It muſt, however, be obſerved, that this is by no means a juſt or exact tranſlation of the JOCASTA, that is the PHOENISSAE, of Euripides. It is partly a paraphraſe, and partly an abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of the Greek tragedy. There are many omiſſions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments, and tranſpoſitions. The chorus, the characters, and the ſubſtance of the ſtory, are entirely retained, and the tenor of the dialogue is often preſerved through whole ſcenes. Some of the beautiful odes of the Greek chorus are neglected, and others ſubſtituted in their places, newly written by the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlators.

But I will give a ſpecimen of this performance as a tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from that affecting ſcene, in which Oedipus, blind and exiled from the city, is led on by his daughter Antigone, the rival in filial fidelity of Lear's Cordelia, to touch the dead and murthered bodies of his queen Jocaſta, and his ſons Eteocles and Polynices. It appears to be the chief fault of the tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, that they have weakened the force of the original, which conſiſts in a pathetic brevity, by needleſs dilatations, and the affectations of circumlocution. The whole dialogue in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal is carried on in ſingle lines.

            <p>Of Thomas Newton, a ſlender contributor to this volume, yet perhaps the chief inſtrument of bringing about a general tranſlation of Seneca, and otherwiſe deſerving well of the litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this period, ſome notices ſeem neceſſary. The firſt letter of his Engliſh THEBAIS is a large capital D. Within it is a ſhield exhibiting a ſable Lion rampant, croſſed in argent on the ſhoulder, and a half moon argent in the dexter corner, I ſuppoſe his armorial bearing. In a copartment, towards the head, and under the ſemicircle, of the letter, are his initials, T. N. He was deſcended from a reſpectable family in Cheſhire, and was ſent while very young, about thirteen years of age, to Trinity college in Oxford <note n="h" place="bottom">REGISTR. ibid.</note>. Soon afterwards he went to Queen's college in Cambridge; but returned within a very few years to Oxford, where he was readmitted into Trinity college <note n="i" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.

Reprinted by Hearne, Oxon. 1715. 8vo.</note>. Moſt of the learned and ingenious men of that age, appear to have courted the favours of this polite and popular encomiaſt. His chief patron was the unfortunate Robert earl of Eſſex. I have often incidentally mentioned ſome of Newton's recommendatory verſes, both in Engliſh and Latin, prefixed to cotemporary books, according to the mode of that age. One of his earlieſt philological publications is a NOTABLE HISTORIE OF THE SARACENS, digeſted from Curio, in three books, printed at London in 1575 <note n="m" place="bottom">In quarto.

In the general character of an author, he was a volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous and a laborious writer. He died at Little Ilford, and was interred in his church, in 1607. From a long and habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual courſe of ſtudious and induſtrious purſuits he had acquired a conſiderable fortune, a portion of which he bequeathed in charitable legacies.</p>
            <p>It is remarkable, that Shakeſpeare has borrowed nothing from the Engliſh Seneca. Perhaps a copy might not fall in his way. Shakeſpeare was only a reader by accident. Hollinſhed and tranſlated Italian novels ſupplied moſt of his plots or ſtories. His ſtorehouſe of learned hiſtory was North's Plutarch. The only poetical fable of antiquity, which he has worked into a play, is TROILUS. But this he borrowed from the romance of Troy. Modern fiction and Engliſh hiſtory were his principal reſources. Theſe perhaps were more ſuitable to his taſte: at leaſt he found that they produced the moſt popular ſubjects. Shakeſpeare was above the bondage of the claſſics.</p>
            <p>I muſt not forget to remark here, that, according to Ames, among the copies of Henry Denham recited in the regiſter of the Company of Stationers <note n="s" place="bottom">I find nothing of this in REGISTER.

            <p>I take this opportunity of obſerving, that I have ſeen an old bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lad called GADS-HILL by <hi>Faire,</hi> that is probably our tranſlator Phaier.

            <p>It will perhaps be ſufficient barely to mention Spenſer's CU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEX, which is a vague and arbitrary paraphraſe, of a poem not properly belonging to Virgil. From the teſtimony of many early Latin writers it may be juſtly concluded, that Virgil wrote an elegant poem with this title. Nor is it improbable that in the CU<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>EX at preſent attributed to Virgil, ſome very few of the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal phraſes, and even verſes, may remain, under the accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated incruſtation of critics, imitators, interpolators, and para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſts, which corrupts what it conceals. But the texture, the character, and ſubſtance, of the genuine poem is almoſt entirely loſt. The CEIRIS, or the fable of Niſus and Scylla, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, although never mentioned by any writer of antiquity, has much fairer pretenſions to genuineneſs. At leaſt the CEIRIS, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing for uncommon depravations of time and tranſcription, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in its preſent ſtate to be a poem of the Auguſtan age, and is perhaps the identical piece dedicated to the Meſſala whoſe patronage it ſolicits. It has that rotundity of verſification, which ſeems to have been ſtudied after the Roman poetry emerged from barbariſm.
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:0373600103:511"/>
It has a general ſimplicity, and often a native ſtrength, of colouring; nor is it tinctured, except by the caſual innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of grammarians, with thoſe ſophiſtications both of ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and expreſſion, which afterwards of courſe took place among the Roman poets, and which would have betrayed a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent forgery. It ſeems to be the work of a young poet: but its digreſſions and deſcriptions which are often too prolix, are not only the marks of a young poet, but of early poetry. It is interſperſed with many lines, now in the Eclogues, Georgics, and Eneid. Here is an argument which ſeems to aſſign it to Virgil. A cotemporary poet would not have ventured to ſteal from poems ſo well known. It was natural, at leaſt allowable, for Virgil to ſteal from a performance of his youth, on which he did not ſet any great value, and which he did not ſcruple to rob of a few ornaments, deſerving a better place. This conſideration excludes Cornelius Gallus, to whom Fontanini, with much acute criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm, has aſcribed the CEIRIS. Nor, for the reaſon given, would Virgil have ſtolen from Gallus. The writer has at leaſt the art of Virgil, in either ſuppreſſing, or throwing into ſhade, the trite and unintereſting incidents of the common fabulous hiſtory of Scylla, which were incapable of decoration, or had been preoccupied by other poets. The dialogue between the young princeſs Scylla, who is deeply in love, and her nurſe, has much of the pathos of Virgil. There are ſome traces which diſcover an imitation of Lucretius: but on the whole, the ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the verſes, and the predominant caſt and manner of the compoſition, exactly reſemble the ARGONAUTICA of Catullus, or the EPITHALAMIUM of PELEUS AND THETIS. I will inſtance in the following paſſage, in which every thing is diſtinctly and circumſtantially touched, and in an affected pomp of numbers. He is alluding to the ſtole of Minerva, interwoven with the battle of the giants, and exhibited at Athens in the magnificent Panathenaic feſtival. The claſſical reader will perceive one or two interpolations: and lament, that this rich piece of embroidery
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:0373600103:512"/>
has ſuffered a little from being unſkilfully darned by another and a more modern artificer.</p>

            <p>The ſame ſtately march of hexameters is obſervable in Tibul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus's tedious panegyric on Meſſala: a poem, which, if it ſhould not be believed to be of Tibullus's hand, may at leaſt, from this reaſoning be adjudged to his age.

Scylla, Niſus's daughter, falls in love with Minos, whom ſhe ſees from the walls of Megara: ſhe finds means to cut off this ſacred ringlet, the city is taken, and ſhe is married to Minos.

            <p>Coxeter ſays, that he had ſeen one of Ovid's Epiſtles tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Robert earl of Eſſex. This I have never ſeen; and, if it could be recovered, I truſt it would only be valued as a curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. A few of his ſonnets are in the Aſhmolean Muſeum, which have no marks of poetic genius. He is a vigorous and elegant writer of proſe. But if Eſſex was no poet, few noblemen of his age were more courted by poets. From Spenſer to the loweſt rhymer he was the ſubject of numerous ſonnets, or popular bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lads. I will not except Sydney. I could produce evidence to prove, that he ſcarce ever went out of England, or even left London, on the moſt frivolous enterpriſe, without a paſtoral in his praiſe, or a panegyric in metre, which were ſold and ſung in
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:0373600103:526"/>
the ſtreets. Having intereſted himſelf in the faſhionable poetry of the times, he was placed high in the ideal Arcadia now juſt eſtabliſhed: and among other inſtances which might be brought, on his return from Portugal in 1589, he was complimented with a poem, called <q rend="inline margQuotes">"An Egloge gratulatorie entituled to the right honorable and renowned ſhepherd of Albions Arcadie Robert earl of Eſſex and for his returne lately into England <note n="q" place="bottom">Licenced to R. Jones, Aug. 1, 1589. REGISTR. STATION. B. fol. 246. b.</note>."</q> This is a light in which lord Eſſex is ſeldom viewed. I know not if the queen's fatal partiality, or his own inherent attractions, his love of literature, his heroiſm, integrity, and generoſity, qualities which abundantly overbalance his preſumption, his vanity, and impetuoſity, had the greater ſhare in dictating theſe praiſes. If adulation were any where juſtifiable, it muſt be when paid to the man who endeavoured to ſave Spenſer from ſtarving in the ſtreets of Dublin, and who buried him in Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter-abbey with becoming ſolemnity. Spenſer was perſecuted by Burleigh, becauſe he was patroniſed by Eſſex.</p>

As Marlowe, being now conſidered as a tranſlator, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe being generally ranked only as a dramatic poet, will not occur again, I take this opportunity of remarking here, that the delicate ſonnet called the PASSIONATE SHEPHERD TO HIS LOVE, falſely attributed to Shakeſpeare, and which occurs in the third act of THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR, followed by the nymph's Reply, was written by Marlowe <note n="c" place="bottom">See Steevens's SHAKESP. vol. i. p. 297. edit. 1778.</note>.

I do not ſay that this is Chapman's fault: but he has by no means repreſented the dignity or the ſimplicity Homer.

            <p>My copy once belonged to Pope; in which he has noted many of Chapman's abſolute interpolations, extending ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the length of a paragraph of twelve lines. A diligent obſerver will eaſily diſcern, that Pope was no careleſs reader of his rude predeceſſor. Pope complains that Chapman took advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of an unmeaſureable length of line. But in reality Pope's lines are longer than Chapman's. If Chapman affected the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of rendering line for line, the ſpecious expedient of chuſing a protracted meaſure which concatenated two lines toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, undoubtedly favoured his uſual propenſity to periphraſis.</p>
            <p>Chapman's commentary is only incidental, contains but a ſmall degree of critical excurſion, and is for the moſt part a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantic compilation from Spondanus. He has the boldneſs ſeverely to cenſure Scaliger's impertinence. It is remarkable that he has taken no illuſtrations from Euſtathius, except through the cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of other commentators.

therefore, which were begun before the year 1600, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that we ſhould here acquaint the reader with ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of his life. He wrote eighteen plays, which although now forgotten, muſt have contributed in no inconſiderable degree to enrich and advance the Engliſh ſtage. He was born in 1557, perhaps in Kent. He paſſed about two years at Trinity college in Oxford, with a contempt of philoſophy, but in a cloſe atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Greek and Roman claſſics <note n="n" place="bottom">From the information of Mr. Wiſe, late Radcliffe's librarian, and keeper of the Archives, at Oxford.</note>. Leaving the univerſity about 1576, he ſeems to have been led to London in the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a poet; where he ſoon commenced a friendſhip with Spenſer, Shakeſpeare, Marlowe, and Daniel, and attracted the notice of ſecretary Walſingham. He probably acquired ſome appointment in the court of king James the firſt; where un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely death, and unexpected diſgrace, quickly deprived him of his liberal patrons Prince Henry and Carr. Jonſon was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly too proud, either to aſſiſt, or to be aſſiſted; yet he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged with Chapman and Marſton in writing the Comedy of EASTWARD HOE, which was performed by the children of the revels in 1605 <note n="o" place="bottom">The firſt of Chapman's plays, I mean with his name, which appears in the Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners Regiſters, is the Tragedy of CHARLES DUKE OF BYRON.

All the three authors, however, were in danger of being pilloried for ſome reflections on the Scotch nation, which were too ſeriouſly underſtood by James the firſt. When the ſocieties of Lincoln's-inn and the Middle-temple, in 1613, had reſolved to exhibit a ſplendid maſque at Whitehall in honour of the nuptials of the Palſgrave and the princeſs Eliſabeth,
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:0373600103:552"/>
Chapman was employed for the poetry, and Inigo Jones for the machinery. It is not clear, whether Dryden's reſolution to burn annually one copy of Chapman's beſt tragedy BUSSY D'AM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BOISE, to the memory of Jonſon, was a cenſure or a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note n="p" place="bottom">Preface to SPANISH FRYER.</note>. He ſays, however, that this play pleaſed only in the repreſentation, like a ſtar which glitters only while it ſhoots. The manes of Jonſon perhaps required ſome reconciliatory rites: for Jonſon being delivered from Shakeſpeare, began unexpectedly to be diſturbed at the riſing reputation of a new theatric rival. Wood ſays, that Chapman was <q rend="inline margQuotes">"a perſon of moſt reverend aſpect, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and temperate, QUALITIES RARELY MEETING IN A POET <note n="q" place="bottom">ATH. OXON. i. 592.</note>!"</q> The truth is, he does not ſeem to have mingled in the diſſipations and indiſcretions, which then marked his profeſſion. He died at the age of ſeventy-ſeven, in 1634, and was buried on the ſouth ſide of ſaint Giles's church in the Fields. His friend Inigo Jones planned and erected a monument to his memory, in the ſtyle of the new architecture, which was unluckily deſtroyed with the old church <note n="r" place="bottom">Wood has preſerved part of the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>This poem is a general ſatire on life, yet without peeviſhneſs or malevolence; and with more of the ſolemnity of the cenſor, than the petulance of the ſatiriſt. Much of the morality is couched under allegorical perſonages and adventures. The Latinity is tolerably pure, but there is a mediocrity in the verſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.

Having ſtarted a topic, he purſues it through all its poſſible affinities, and deviates into the moſt diſtant and unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary digreſſions. Yet there is a facility in his manner, which is not always unpleaſing: nor is the general conduct of the work void of art and method. He moraliſes with a boldneſs and a liberality of ſentiment, which were then unuſual; and his maxims and ſtrictures are ſometimes tinctured with a ſpirit of libertiniſm, which, without expoſing the opinions, muſt have offended the gravity, of the more orthodox eccleſiaſtics. He fancies that a confident philoſopher, who raſhly preſumes to ſcrutiniſe the remote myſteries of nature, is ſhewn in heaven like an ape, for the public diverſion of the gods. A thought evidently borrowed by Pope <note n="g" place="bottom">See ESSAY ON POPE, p. 94.</note>. Although he ſubmits his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance to the ſentence of the church, he treats the authority of the popes, and the voluptuous lives of the monks, with the ſevereſt acrimony. It was the laſt circumſtance that chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to give this poem almoſt the rank of a claſſic in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed countries, and probably produced an early Engliſh tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation. After his death, he was pronounced an heretic; and his body was taken up, and committed to the flames. A meaſure

            <p>Googe ſeems chiefly to have excelled in rendering the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and flowery paſſages of this moral ZODIAC. He thus deſcribes the Spring.</p>

            <p>One cannot but remark, that the conduct and machinery of the old viſionary poems is commonly the ſame. A rural ſcene, generally a wilderneſs, is ſuppoſed. An imaginary being of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate wiſdom, a hermit, a goddeſs, or an angel, appears; and having purged the poet's eye with a few drops of ſome celeſtial elixir, conducts him to the top of an inacceſſible moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, which commands an unbounded plain filled with all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. A cavern opens, and diſplays the torments of the damned: he next is introduced into heaven, by way of the moon, the
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:0373600103:561"/>
only planet which was thought big enough for a poetical viſit. Although ſuddenly deſerted by his myſtic intelligencer, he finds himſelf weary and deſolate, on the ſea-ſhore, in an impaſſable foreſt, or a flowery meadow.</p>

uſeleſs ſubtlety, of method which cannot be applied to practice, and of that affectation of unneceſſary deduction and frivolous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation, which characteriſes the philoſophy of the Greeks, and which is conſpicuous not only in the demonſtrations of Euclid, but in the Socratic diſputations recorded by Xenophon. The ſolid ſimplicity of common ſenſe would have been much leſs ſubject to circumlocution, embarraſſment, and ambiguity. We do not want to be told by a chain of proofs, that two and two make four. This ſpecific character of the ſchools of the Greeks, is perhaps to be traced backwards to the loquacity, the love of paradox, and the fondneſs for argumentative diſcourſe, ſo peculiar to their nation. Even the good ſenſe of Epictetus was not proof againſt this captious phrenzy. What patience can endure the ſolemn quibbles, which mark the ſtoical confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of that philoſopher perſerved by Arrian? It is to this ſpirit, not ſolely from a principle of invidious malignity, that Tully alludes, where he calls the Greeks, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Homines conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis quam veritatis cupidiores <note n="e" place="bottom">De ORATORE, Lib. i. §. xi.</note>."</q> And in another part of the ſame work he ſays, that it is a principal and even a national fault of this people, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Quocunque in loco, quoſcunque inter homines viſum eſt, de rebus aut DIFFICILLIMIS aut non NE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CESSARIIS, ARGUTISSIME DISPUTARE <note n="f" place="bottom">Ibid.

Beſide theſe verſions of the Greek and Roman poets, and of the antient writers in proſe, incidentally mentioned in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view, it will be ſufficient to obſerve here in general, that almoſt all the Greek and Roman claſſics appeared in Engliſh before the year 1600. The effect and influence of theſe tranſlations on our poetry, will be conſidered in a future ſection.</p>

            <p>BUT the ardour of tranſlation was not now circumſcribed within the bounds of the claſſics, whether poets, hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, orators, or critics, of Greece and Rome.</p>
            <p>I have before obſerved, that with our frequent tours through Italy, and our affectation of Italian manners, about the middle of the ſixteenth century, the Italian poets became faſhionable, and that this circumſtance, for a time at leaſt, gave a new turn to our poetry. The Italian poets, however, were but in few hands; and a practice of a more popular and general nature, yet ſtill reſulting from our communications with Italy, now began to prevail, which produced ſtill greater revolutions. This was the tranſlation of Italian books, chiefly on fictitious and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative ſubjects, into Engliſh.</p>
            <p>The learned Aſcham thought this novelty in our literature too important to be paſſed over without obſervation, in his reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the courſe of an ingenuous education. It will be much to our purpoſe to tranſcribe what he has ſaid on this ſubject: although I think his arguments are more like the reaſonings of a rigid puritan, than of a man of liberal views and true penetration; and that he endeavours to account for the origin, and to ſtate the conſequences, of theſe tranſlations, more in the ſpirit of an early calviniſtic preacher, than as a ſenſible critic or a polite ſcholar. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Theſe be the inchauntments of Circe, brought out of Italie to marre mens manners in England: much, by example of ill life, but more by precepts of fonde bookes, of late tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated oute of Italian into Engliſh, ſolde in euery ſhop in London, commended by honeſt titles, the ſooner to corrupt

            <p>Aſcham talkes here exactly in the ſtyle of Prynne's HISTRIO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MASTIX. It muſt indeed be confeſſed, that by theſe books many pernicious obſcenities were circulated, and perhaps the doctrine of intrigue more accurately taught and exemplified than before. But every advantage is attended with its inconveniencies and abuſes. That to procure tranſlations of Italian tales was a plot of the papiſts, either for the purpoſe of facilitating the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of their opinions, of polluting the minds of our youth, or of diffuſing a ſpirit of ſcepticiſm, I am by no means con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced. But I have nothing to do with the moral effects of theſe verſions. I mean only to ſhew their influence on our literature, more particularly on our poetry, although I reſerve the diſcuſſion of this point for a future ſection. At preſent, my deſign is to give the reader a full and uniform view of the chief of theſe tranſlations from the Italian, which appeared in England before the year 1600.</p>
            <p>I will begin with Boccace. The reader recollects Boccace's THESEID and TROILUS, many of his Tales, and large paſſages from Petrarch and Dante, tranſlated by Chaucer. But the golden mine of Italian fiction opened by Chaucer, was ſoon cloſed and forgotten. I muſt however premiſe, that the Italian language now began to grow ſo faſhionable, that it was explained in lexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons and grammars, written in Engliſh, and with a view to the illuſtration of the three principal Italian poets. So early as 1550, were publiſhed, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Principal rules of the Italian grammar, with a dictionarie for the better vnderſtanding of Boccaſe, Petrarche, and Dante, g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The third edition of this book is dated in 1567. Scipio Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulo's Italian grammar was tranſlated into Engliſh in 1578, by Henry Grantham <note n="f" place="bottom">For T.

But to proceed.</p>
            <p>Before the year 1570, William Paynter, clerk of the Office of Arms within the Tower of London, and who ſeems to have been maſter of the ſchool of Sevenoaks in Kent, printed a very conſiderable part of Boccace's novels. His firſt collection is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"The PALACE OF PLEASURE, the firſt volume, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſixty novels out of Boccacio, London, 1566."</q> It is dedicated to lord Warwick <note n="l" place="bottom">A ſecond edition was printed for H.

It would be ſuperfluous to point out here the uſes which Shakeſpeare made of theſe volumes, after the full inveſtigation which his antient alluſions and his plots have ſo lately received. One William Painter, undoubtedly the ſame, tranſlated William Fulk's ANTIPROGNOSTICON, a treatiſe written

            <p>It muſt not be forgot, that Sachetti publiſhed tales before Boc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cace. But the publication of Boccace's DECAMERON gave a ſtabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to this mode of compoſition, which had exiſted in a rude ſtate before the revival of letters in Italy. Boccace collected the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon tales of his country, and procured others of Grecian origin from his friends and preceptors the Conſtantinopolitan exiles, which he decorated with new circumſtances, and delivered in the pureſt ſtyle. Some few perhaps are of his own invention. He was ſoon imitated, yet often unſucceſsfully, by many of his countrymen, Poggio, Bandello, the anonymous author of LE CIENTO NOVELLE ANTIKE, Cinthio, Firenzuola, Maleſpini, and others. Even Machiavel, who united the livelieſt wit with the profoundeſt reflection, and who compoſed two comedies while he was compiling a political hiſtory of his country, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended to adorn this faſhionable ſpecies of writing with his NOVELLA DI BELFEGOR, or the tale of Belphegor.</p>

In Luigi's novel, Juliet awakes from her trance in the tomb before the death of Romeo. From Turberville's poems printed in 1567, we learn, that Arthur Brooke was drowned in his paſſage to New-haven, and that he was the author of this tranſlation, which was the diſtinguiſhed proof of his excellent poetical abilities.</p>

                  </gap>ISTR. B. fol. 237. a.</note>. I was informed by the late Mr. Collins of Chicheſter, that Shakeſpeare's TEMPEST, for which no origin is yet aſſigned, was formed on this favorite ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance. But although this information has not proved true on examination, an uſeful concluſion may be drawn from it, that Shakeſpeare's ſtory is ſomewhere to be found in an Italian novel, at leaſt that the ſtory preceded Shakeſpeare. Mr. Collins had ſearched this ſubject with no leſs fidelity, than judgment and induſtry: but his memory failing in his laſt calamitous indiſpoſition, he probably gave me the name of one novel for another. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber he added a circumſtance, which may lead to a diſcovery, that the principal character of the romance, anſwering to Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare's Proſpero, was a chemical necromancer, who had bound a ſpirit like Ariel to obey his call and perform his ſervices. It was a common pretence of the dealers in the occult ſciences to have a demon at command. At leaſt Aurelio, or Orelio, was probably one of the names of this romance, the production and multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of gold being the grand object of alchemy. Taken at large, the magical part of the TEMPEST is founded in that ſort of philoſophy which was practiſed by John Dee and his aſſociates, and has been called the Roſicruſian. The name Ariel came from the Talmudiſtic myſteries with which the learned Jews had infected this ſcience.</p>

            <p>ENOUGH has been opened of the reign of queen Eliſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, to afford us an opportunity of forming ſome general reflections, tending to eſtabliſh a full eſtimate of the genius of the poetry of that reign; and which, by drawing concluſions from what has been ſaid, and directing the reader to what he is to expect, will at once be recapitulatory and preparatory. Such a ſurvey perhaps might have ſtood with more propriety as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction to this reign. But it was firſt neceſſary to clear the way, by many circumſtantial details, and the regular narration of thoſe particulars, which lay the foundation of principles, and ſuggeſt matter for diſcurſive obſervation. My ſentiments on this ſubject ſhall therefore compoſe the concluding ſection of the preſent volume.</p>
            <p>The age of queen Eliſabeth is commonly called the golden age of Engliſh poetry. It certainly may not improperly be ſtyled the moſt POETICAL age of theſe annals.</p>
            <p>Among the great features which ſtrike us in the poetry of this period, are the predominancy of fable, of fiction, and fancy, and a predilection for intereſting adventures and pathetic events. I will endeavour to aſſign and explain the cauſe of this charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſtic diſtinction, which may chiefly be referred to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing principles, ſometimes blended, and ſometimes operating ſingly: The revival and vernacular verſions of the claſſics, the importation and tranſlation of Italian novels, the viſionary reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries or refinements of falſe philoſophy, a degree of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition ſufficient for the purpoſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of poetry, the adoption of
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:0373600103:595"/>
the machineries of romance, and the frequency and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of allegoric exhibition in the popular ſpectacles.</p>
            <p>When the corruptions and impoſtures of popery were abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, the faſhion of cultivating the Greek and Roman learning became univerſal: and the literary character was no longer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to ſcholars by profeſſion, but aſſumed by the nobility and gentry. The eccleſiaſtics had found it their intereſt to keep the languages of antiquity to themſelves, and men were eager to know what had been ſo long injuriouſly concealed. Truth propagates truth, and the mantle of myſtery was removed not only from religion but from literature. The laity, who had now been taught to aſſert their natural privileges, became impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of the old monopoly of knowledge, and demanded admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the uſurpations of the clergy. The general curioſity for new diſcoveries, heightened either by juſt or imaginary ideas of the treaſures contained in the Greek and Roman writers, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited all perſons of leiſure and fortune to ſtudy the claſſics. The pedantry of the preſent age was the politeneſs of the laſt. An accurate comprehenſion of the phraſeology and peculiarities of the antient poets, hiſtorians, and orators, which yet ſeldom went farther than a kind of technical erudition, was an indiſpenſable and almoſt the principal object in the circle of a gentleman's education. Every young lady of faſhion was carefully inſtituted in claſſical letters: and the daughter of a ducheſs was taught, not only to diſtil ſtrong waters, but to conſtrue Greek. Among the learned females of high diſtinction, queen Eliſabeth herſelf was the moſt conſpicuous. Roger Aſcham, her preceptor, ſpeaks with rapture of her aſtoniſhing progreſs in the Greek nouns; and declares with no ſmall degree of triumph, that during a long reſidence at Windſor-caſtle, ſhe was accuſtomed to read more Greek in a day, than <q rend="inline margQuotes">"ſome prebendary of that church did Latin, in one week <note n="a" place="bottom">SCHOOLEMASTER. p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

from Plutarch's Lives, may be thought at preſent a more incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible and extraordinary character, than a canon of Windſor underſtanding no Greek and but little Latin, yet Eliſabeth's paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for theſe acquiſitions was then natural, and reſulted from the genius and habitudes of her age.</p>
            <p>The books of antiquity being thus familiariſed to the great, every thing was tinctured with antient hiſtory and mythology. The heathen gods, although diſcountenanced by the Calviniſts on a ſuſpicion of their tending to cheriſh and revive a ſpirit of idolatry, came into general vogue. When the queen paraded through a country-town, almoſt every pageant was a pantheon. When ſhe paid a viſit at the houſe of any of her nobility, at en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the hall ſhe was ſaluted by the Penates, and conducted to her privy-chamber by Mercury. Even the paſtry-cooks were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert mythologiſts. At dinner, ſelect transformations of Ovid's metamorphoſes were exhibited in confectionary: and the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did iceing of an immenſe hiſtoric plumb-cake, was emboſſed with a delicious baſſo-relievo of the deſtruction of Troy. In the afternoon, when ſhe condeſcended to walk in the garden, the lake was covered with Tritons and Nereids: the pages of the family were converted into Wood-nymphs who peeped from every bower: and the footmen gamboled over the lawns in the figure of Satyrs. I ſpeak it without deſigning to inſinuate any unfavourable ſuſpicions, but it ſeems difficult to ſay, why Eliſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth's virginity ſhould have been made the theme of perpetual and exceſſive panegyric: nor does it immediately appear, that there is leſs merit or glory in a married than a maiden queen. Yet, the next morning, after ſleeping in a room hung with the tapeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the voyage of Eneas, when her majeſty hunted in the Park, ſhe was met by Diana, who pronouncing our royal prude to be the brighteſt paragon of unſpotted chaſtity, invited her to groves free from the intruſions of Acteon. The truth is, ſhe was ſo profuſely flattered for this virtue, becauſe it was eſteemed the characteriſtical ornament of the heroines, as fantaſtic honour was the chief pride of the champions, of the old barbarous romance.
<pb facs="tcp:0373600103:597" rendition="simple:additions"/>
It was in conformity to the ſentiments of chivalry, which ſtill continued in vogue, that ſhe was celebrated for chaſtity: the compliment, however, was paid in a claſſical alluſion.</p>
            <p>Queens muſt be ridiculous when they would appear as women. The ſofter attractions of ſex vaniſh on the throne. Eliſabeth ſought all occaſions of being extolled for her beauty, of which indeed in the prime of her youth ſhe poſſeſſed but a ſmall ſhare, whatever might have been her pretenſions to abſolute virginity. Notwithſtanding her exaggerated habits of dignity and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and a certain affectation of imperial ſeverity, ſhe did not perceive this ambition of being complimented for beauty, to be an idle and unpardonable levity, totally inconſiſtent with her high ſtation and character. As ſhe conquered all nations with her arms, it matters not what were the triumphs of her eyes. Of what conſequence was the complexion of the miſtreſs of the world? Not leſs vain of her perſon than her politics, this ſtately coquet, the guardian of the proteſtant faith, the terror of the ſea, the mediatrix of the factions of France, and the ſcourge of Spain, was infinitely mortified, if an embaſſador, at the firſt audience, did not tell her ſhe was the fineſt woman in Europe. No negociation ſucceeded unleſs ſhe was addreſſed as a goddeſs. Encomiaſtic harangues drawn from this topic, even on the ſuppoſition of youth and beauty, were ſurely ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, unſuitable, and unworthy; and were offered and received with an equal impropriety. Yet when ſhe rode through the ſtreets of the city of Norwich, Cupid, at the command of the mayor and aldermen, advancing from a groupe of gods who had left Olympus to grace the proceſſion, gave her a golden arrow, the moſt effective weapon of his well-furniſhed quiver, which under the influence of ſuch irreſiſtible charms was ſure to wound the moſt obdurate heart. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"A gift, ſays honeſt Hollinſhed, which her majeſty, now verging to her fiftieth year, received very thankfullie <note n="b" place="bottom">CHRON. iii. f. 1297.</note>."</q> In one of the fulſome interludes at

court, where ſhe was preſent, the ſinging-boys of her chapel preſented the ſtory of the three rival goddeſſes on mount Ida, to which her majeſty was ingeniouſly added as a fourth: and Paris was arraigned in form for adjudging the golden apple to Venus, which was due to the queen alone.</p>
            <p>This inundation of claſſical pedantry ſoon infected our poetry. Our writers, already trained in the ſchool of fancy, were ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly dazzled with theſe novel imaginations, and the divinities and heroes of pagan antiquity decorated every compoſition. The perpetual alluſions to antient fable were often introduced without the leaſt regard to propriety. Shakeſpeare's Mrs. Page, who is not intended in any degree to be a learned or an affected lady, laughing at the cumberſome courtſhip of her corpulent lover Falſtaffe, ſays, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I had rather be a gianteſs and lie under mount Pelion <note n="c" place="bottom">MERRY W. Act. ii. Sc. i.</note>."</q> This familiarity with the pagan ſtory was not, however, ſo much owing to the prevailing ſtudy of the original authors, as to the numerous Engliſh verſions of them, which were conſequently made. The tranſlations of the claſſics, which now employed every pen, gave a currency and a celebrity to theſe fancies, and had the effect of diffuſing them among the people. No ſooner were they delivered from the pale of the ſcholaſtic languages, than they acquired a general notoriety. Ovid's metamorphoſes juſt tranſlated by Golding, to inſtance no farther, diſcloſed a new world of fiction, even to the illiterate. As we had now all the antient fables in Engliſh, learned allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, whether in a poem or a pageant, were no longer obſcure and unintelligible to common readers and common ſpectators. And here we are led to obſerve, that at this reſtoration of the claſſics, we were firſt ſtruck only with their fabulous inventions. We did not attend to their regularity of deſign and juſtneſs of ſentiment. A rude age, beginning to read theſe writers, imitated their extravagancies, not their natural beauties. And theſe, like other novelties, were purſued to a blameable exceſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="495" facs="tcp:0373600103:599"/>
I have before given a ſketch of the introduction of claſſical ſtories, in the ſplendid ſhow exhibited at the coronation of queen Anne Boleyn. But that is a rare and a premature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: and the pagan fictions are there complicated with the barbariſms of the catholic worſhip, and the doctrines of ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtic theology. Claſſical learning was not then ſo widely ſpread, either by ſtudy or tranſlation, as to bring theſe learned ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles into faſhion, to frame them with ſufficient ſkill, and to preſent them with propriety.</p>
            <p>Another capital ſource of the poetry peculiar to this period, conſiſted in the numerous tranſlations of Italian tales into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh. Theſe narratives, not dealing altogether in romantic in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, but in real life and manners, and in artful arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of fictitious yet probable events, afforded a new gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a people which yet retained their antient reliſh for tale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling, and became the faſhionable amuſement of all who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to read for pleaſure. They gave riſe to innumerable plays and poems, which would not otherwiſe have exiſted; and turned the thoughts of our writers to new inventions of the ſame kind. Before theſe books became common, affecting ſituations, the combination of incident, and the pathos of cataſtrophe, were almoſt unknown. Diſtreſs, eſpecially that ariſing from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts of the tender paſſion, had not yet been ſhewn in its moſt intereſting forms. It was hence our poets, particularly the dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic, borrowed ideas of a legitimate plot, and the complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of facts neceſſary to conſtitute a ſtory either of the comic or tragic ſpecies. In proportion as knowledge encreaſed, genius had wanted ſubjects and materials. Theſe pieces uſurped the place of legends and chronicles. And although the old hiſtorical ſongs of the minſtrels contained much bold adventure, heroic enterpriſe, and ſtrong touches of rude delineation, yet they failed in that multiplication and diſpoſition of circumſtances, and in that deſcription of characters and events approaching nearer to truth and reality, which were demanded by a more
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:0373600103:600"/>
diſcerning and curious age. Even the rugged features of the original Gothic romance were ſoftened by this ſort of reading: and the Italian paſtoral, yet with ſome mixture of the kind of incidents deſcribed in Heliodorus's Ethiopic hiſtory now newly tranſlated, was engrafted on the feudal manners in Sydney's ARCADIA.</p>
            <p>But the reformation had not yet deſtroyed every deluſion, nor diſinchanted all the ſtrong holds of ſuperſtition. A few dim characters were yet legible in the mouldering creed of tradition. Every goblin of ignorance did not vaniſh at the firſt glimmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the morning of ſcience. Reaſon ſuffered a few demons ſtill to linger, which ſhe choſe to retain in her ſervice under the guidance of poetry. Men believed, or were willing to believe, that ſpirits were yet hovering around, who brought with them <hi>airs from heaven, or blaſts from hell,</hi> that the ghoſt was duely releaſed from his priſon of torment at the ſound of the curfue, and that fairies imprinted myſterious circles on the turf by moonlight. Much of this credulity was even conſecrated by the name of ſcience and profound ſpeculation. Proſpero had not yet <hi>broken and buried his ſtaff,</hi> nor <hi>drowned his book deeper than did ever plummet ſound.</hi> It was now that the alchymiſt, and the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial aſtrologer, conducted his occult operations by the potent intercourſe of ſome preternatural being, who came obſequious to his call, and was bound to accompliſh his ſevereſt ſervices, under certain conditions, and for a limited duration of time. It was actually one of the pretended feats of theſe fantaſtic philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, to evoke the queen of the Fairies in the ſolitude of a gloomy grove, who, preceded by a ſudden ruſtling of the leaves, appeared in robes of tranſcendent luſtre <note n="d" place="bottom">Lilly's LIFE, p. 151.</note>. The Shakeſpeare of a more inſtructed and poliſhed age, would not have given us a magician darkening the ſun at noon, the ſabbath of the witches, and the cauldron of incantation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="497" facs="tcp:0373600103:601"/>
Undoubtedly moſt of theſe notions were credited and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in a much higher degree, in the preceding periods. But the arts of compoſition had not then made a ſufficient progreſs, nor would the poets of thoſe periods have managed them with ſo much addreſs and judgement. We were now arrived at that point, when the national credulity, chaſtened by reaſon, had produced a ſort of civilized ſuperſtition, and left a ſet of tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, fanciful enough for poetic decoration, and yet not too violent and chimerical for common ſenſe. Hobbes, although no friend to this doctrine, obſerves happily, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"In a good poem both judgement and fancy are required; but the fancy muſt be more eminent, becauſe they pleaſe for the EXTRAVA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GANCY, but ought not to diſpleaſe by INDISCRETION <note n="e" place="bottom">LEVIATH. Part i. ch. viii.</note>."</q>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time the Gothic romance, although ſomewhat ſhook by the claſſical fictions, and by the tales of Boccace and Bandello, ſtill maintained its ground: and the daring machine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of giants, dragons, and inchanted caſtles, borrowed from the magic ſtorehouſe of Boiardo, Arioſto, and Taſſo, began to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by the epic muſe. Theſe ornaments have been cenſured by the bigotry of preciſe and ſervile critics, as abounding in whimſical abſurdities, and as unwarrantable deviations from the practice of Homer and Virgil. The author of AN ENQUIRY INTO THE LIFE AND WRITINGS OF HOMER is willing to allow a fertility of genius, and a felicity of expreſſion, to Taſſo and Arioſto; but at the ſame time complains, that, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"quitting life, they betook themſelves to aerial beings and Utopian characters, and filled their works with Charms and Viſions, the modern Supplements of the Marvellous and Sublime.

are turned into ſhips in the Orlando, nymphs are transformed into ſhips in the Eneid. Cacus is a more unnatural ſavage than Caliban. Nor am I convinced, that the imagery of Iſmeno's necromantic foreſt in the Gieruſalemme Liberata, guarded by walls and battlements of fire, is leſs marvellous and ſublime, than the leap of Juno's horſes in the Iliad, celebrated by Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginus for its ſingular magnificence and dignity <note n="g" place="bottom">IL<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But I forbear to anticipate my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of a ſyſtem, which will more properly be conſidered, when I come to ſpeak of Spenſer. I muſt, however, obſerve here, that the Gothic and pagan fictions were now frequently blended and incorporated. The Lady of the Lake floated in the ſuite of Neptune before queen Eliſabeth at Kenilworth; Ariel aſſumes the ſemblance of a ſea-nymph, and Hecate, by an eaſy aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, conducts the rites of the weird ſiſters in Macbeth.</p>
            <p>Allegory had been derived from the religious dramas into our civil ſpectacles. The maſques and pageantries of the age of Eliſabeth were not only furniſhed by the heathen divinities, but often by the virtues and vices imperſonated, ſignificantly deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, accurately diſtinguiſhed by their proper types, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by living actors. The antient ſymbolical ſhews of this ſort began now to loſe their old barbariſm and a mixture of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and to aſſume a degree of poetical elegance and preciſion. Nor was it only in the conformation of particular figures that much fancy was ſhewn, but in the contexture of ſome of the fables or devices preſented by groupes of ideal perſonages. Theſe exhibitions quickened creative invention, and reflected back on poetry what poetry had given. From their familiarity and public nature, they formed a national taſte for allegory; and the allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical poets were now writing to the people. Even romance was turned into this channel. In the Fairy Queen, allegory is wrought upon chivalry, and the feats and figments of Arthur's round table
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:0373600103:603"/>
are moraliſed. The virtues of magnificence and chaſtity are here perſonified: but they are imaged with the forms, and under the agency, of romantic knights and damſels. What was an after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought in Taſſo, appears to have been Spenſer's premeditated and primary deſign. In the mean time, we muſt not confound theſe moral combatants of the Fairy Queen with ſome of its other embodied abſtractions, which are purely and profeſſedly allegorical.</p>
            <p>It may here be added, that only a few critical treatiſes, and but one ART OF POETRY, were now written. Sentiments and images were not abſolutely determined by the canons of compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition: nor was genius awed by the conſciouſneſs of a future and final arraignment at the tribunal of taſte. A certain dignity of inattention to niceties is now viſible in our writers. Without too cloſely conſulting a criterion of correctneſs, every man indulged his own capriciouſneſs of invention. The poet's appeal was chiefly to his own voluntary feelings, his own immediate and peculiar mode of conception. And this freedom of thought was often expreſſed in an undiſguiſed frankneſs of diction. A cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, by the way, that greatly contributed to give the flowing modulation which now marked the meaſures of our poets, and which ſoon degenerated into the oppoſite extreme of diſſonance and aſperity. Selection and diſcrimination were often overlooked. Shakeſpeare wandered in purſuit of univerſal nature. The glancings of his eye are from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven. We behold him breaking the barriers of imaginary method. In the ſame ſcene, he deſcends from his meridian of the nobleſt tragic ſublimity, to puns and quibbles, to the meaneſt merriments of a plebeian farce. In the midſt of his dignity, he reſembles his own Richard the ſecond, the <hi>ſkipping king,</hi> who ſometimes diſcarding the ſtate of a monarch,

            <p>No Satires, properly ſo called, were written till towards the latter end of the queen's reign, and then but a few. Pictures drawn at large of the vices of the times, did not ſuit readers who loved to wander in the regions of artificial manners.

            <p>The importance of the female character was not yet acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, nor were women admitted into the general commerce of ſociety.

Percy, Henry the fifth, and Maſter Fenton. Their tragic heroines, their Deſdemonas and Ophelias, although of ſo much conſequence in the piece, are degraded to the back-ground. In comedy, their ladies are nothing more than MERRY WIVES, plain and chearful matrons, who ſtand upon the <hi>charineſs of their honeſty.</hi> In the ſmaller poems, if a lover praiſes his miſtreſs, ſhe is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plimented in ſtrains neither polite nor pathetic, without elegance and without affection: ſhe is deſcribed, not in the addreſs of intelligible yet artful panegyric, not in the real colours, and with the genuine accompliſhments, of nature, but as an eccentric ideal being of another ſyſtem, and as inſpiring ſentiments equally unmeaning, hyperbolical, and unnatural.</p>
            <p>All or moſt of theſe circumſtances, contributed to give a deſcriptive, a pictureſque, and a figurative caſt to the poetical language. This effect appears even in the proſe compoſitions of the reign of Eliſabeth. In the ſubſequent age, proſe became the language of poetry.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, general knowledge was encreaſing with a wide diffuſion and a haſty rapidity. Books began to be multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and a variety of the moſt uſeful and rational topics had been diſcuſſed in our own language. But ſcience had not made too great advances. On the whole, we were now arrived at that period, propitious to the operations of original and true poetry, when the coyneſs of fancy was not always proof againſt the approaches of reaſon, when genius was rather directed than go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by judgement, and when taſte and learning had ſo far only diſciplined imagination, as to ſuffer its exceſſes to paſs without cenſure or controul, for the ſake of the beauties to which they were allied.</p>
