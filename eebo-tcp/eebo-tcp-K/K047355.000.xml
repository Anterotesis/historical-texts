            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE PUBLICK.</head>
            <p>THE reader will perceive at firſt ſight that the hint of this piece is borrowed from an Italian Opera, entitled, <hi>Il Filofofo di Campagna.</hi> There is alſo a circumſtance from Moliere, which, except about twenty lines taken from different publications, and thrown occaſionally into the ſongs, are the only paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in it that have ever appeared either on the ſtage, or in print.</p>
            <p>Indeed conſcious of my own inability, I ſhould have collected all the materials, had it been practicable; but attempting this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſucceſs, and being unwilling to throw away a ſubject than which 'tis hardly poſſible to conceive any thing more operatical, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to make a tryal of what I could do to it myſelf, and this in no reſpect with a view of ſetting myſelf up for an author, but merely from a deſire of aſſiſting my reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as a muſician.</p>
            <p>And now I ſhould very little deſerve the
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0670102400:5"/>
pains they have taken for me, if I did not in the warmeſt manner acknowledge my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations to the performers, to whoſe merit I am convinced I owe a conſiderable ſhare of that applauſe the WEDDING RING has been favoured with.</p>
            <p>I have little more to ſay concerning the piece. The dialogue is given for nothing more than ſuch as would immediately ariſe from the ſituations; and if the ſongs are found to be irregular, I would beg leave to remark, that they were written ſo (the comic ones eſpecially) on purpoſe, it being very often neceſſary, that the meaſure ſhould halt in order to give a novelty to the expreſſion of the muſick. And having ſaid thus much, ſuch as it is, I take the liberty of ſubmitting this trifle to the public; to that public to whom I have ſuch infinite obligations, whoſe humanity and generoſity I have ſo lately ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, and to whoſe amuſement it will always be my greateſt pride, that I have the honour of endeavouring to contribute.</p>

But then is not this the requeſt of a tender and indulgent father, who has always made my happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs his conſtant ſtudy; and even now wiſhes this union from no one motive, but to ſee me plac'd in a ſtill ſuperior ſituation? alas, how weak and vain! as if felicity was the ceriain conſequence of ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour; and that all the pleaſures and enjoyments of life follow'd in the train of the great.

She is gone into her dreſſing-room I ſee—how lucky—by that means, when this creature comes, he'll be left to my management, and if I don't give a good account of him I'll be content to be thought the arranteſt novice in love-affairs that ever liv'd.</p>

                  <p>I believe, if you ſtay till you get her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, your patience will be pretty well exercis'd.</p>

laſt requeſt I have to make you, allow me to hear a confirmation of this from your daughter?</p>

                  <speaker>Hen.</speaker>
                  <p>I don't abſolutely ſay that; but it would be a ſatisfaction to me, I confeſs, to hear it from the young lady herſelf.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pan.</speaker>
                  <p>Oh, Sir, you ſhall have that ſatisfaction in a minute, for here ſhe comes.—Felicia, here's a ſtrange importunate ſort of a gentleman, who has the audacity to expect my conſent to his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with you; I told him of the promiſe you made me, and nothing, forſooth, will ſatisfy him but hearing it from your mouth.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Hen.</speaker>
                  <p>Indeed, Madam, what I heard from your father might well ſurpriſe me, I was in doubt, I own; and that final ſentence, which determines the fate of my unbounded paſſion, muſt be ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly felt by me, that it can be no offence if I deſire a repetition of it.</p>

                  <speaker>Fel.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, I'd have it known, that fate has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented two objects to my view, which inſpiring me with different ſentiments, agitate all the paſſions of my ſoul, one, by a reaſonable choice whereto honour engages me—</p>

                  <p>I know, 'tis highly improper for young women to own their love ſo freely; but in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition fate has plac'd me, theſe liberties may be allow'd, and I can without a bluſh confeſs, that I have declared my real ſentiments.</p>

                  <p>I never heard ſuch a piece of impudence ſince I was born, but I am angry with myſelf for liſtening to it. Felicia, I am going to ſee that Zerbino makes all the neceſſary preparations, and ſhall be with you again in half an hour.</p>
