            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PROPOSALS <hi>FOR PUBLISHING</hi> A NEW AND IMPROVED EDITION OF SHAKSPEARE ILLUSTRATED.</head>
            <byline>BY <hi>CHARLOTTE LENNOX.</hi>
            </byline>
            <p>AT a very early period of the Author's life this Work was written, and publiſhed with all the vivacity and confidence of youth: Elated by diſcovering that ſhe had traced from whence the immortal dramatic Poet of our nation had borrowed many of his plots, and fond of diſplaying her critical ſagacity in ſhewing that he made uſe of the old tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of CYNTHIO, BANDELLO, and ARIOSTO'S Tales and Novels, and not of the originals, of which ſhe gives a new tranſlation in this Work, ſhe was thought by ſome to have treated SHAKSPEARE with leſs reverence than might have been wiſhed. Nevertheleſs the Public was pleaſed to ſee ſo much merit in the performance, that it was received with very general favour, and was honoured by ſuch marks of attention, as not to acknowledge would argue rather arrogance than modeſty. The learned Profeſſor GOTSCHED of LEIPSIC tranſlated her remarks into the German language, and the illuſtrious Dr. JOHNSON adopted ſome of them in his edition of SHAKSPEARE. He preſented her book to the Univerſity of Oxford, depoſiting it in the Bodleian library; and quoted it as one of the authorities in his Dictionary.</p>
            <p>Now, when the fame of SHAKSPEARE has had conſiderable acceſſions by the labours of various commentators, and when, by a wide diffuſion of good taſte, his works juſtly enjoy a popularity ſo extenſive, that the world is ready to afford the moſt liberal patronage to correct, elegant, and ſplendid editions of them, ſhe is willing to flatter herſelf that her friends are not miſtaken in thinking that her book, entitled, SHAKSPEARE ILLUSTRATED, may now advantageouſly be produced in a more reſpectable form, and with the improvements which, at a mature age, ſhe truſts ſhe can give it: She therefore propoſes to publiſh it on the following
<list>
                  <head>CONDITIONS.</head>
                  <item>I. THE Work to be elegantly printed in Two Volumes octavo; the price to Subſcribers to be Twelve Shillings in boards.</item>
                  <item>II. The Work to be put to the preſs as ſoon as there is a ſufficient number of Subſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and it is to be hoped it will be ready for delivery in January 1794.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>SUBSCRIPTIONS received at <hi>Mr. CADELL'S,</hi> in the Strand; <hi>Mr. DILLY'S,</hi> in the Poultry; <hi>Mr. HOOKHAM'S,</hi> in Bond Street; and <hi>Mr. BECKETT'S,</hi> in Pall-mall.</p>
