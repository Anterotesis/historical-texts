            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>MEMOIRS of the AUTHOR.</head>
            <p>THE enthuſiaſm of poetry, like that of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
has frequently a powerful influence on
the conduct of life, and either throws it into the
retreat of uniform obſcurity, or marks it with irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities
that lead to miſery and diſquiet. The
gifts of imagination bring the heavieſt taſk upon
the vigilance of reaſon; and to bear thoſe faculties
with unerring rectitude, or invariable propriety,
requires a degree of firmneſs and of cool attention
which doth not always attend the higher gifts of
the mind. Yet, difficult as nature herſelf ſeems to
have rendered the taſk of regularity to genius, it is
the ſupreme conſolation of <hi>dulneſs</hi> and <hi>folly,</hi> to point
with gothic triumph to theſe exceſſes, which are
the overflowings of faculties they never enjoyed.
Perfectly unconſcious that they are indebted to their
ſtupidity for the conſiſtency of their conduct, they
plume themſelves on an imaginary virtue, which
has its origin in what is really their diſgrace.—Let
ſuch, if ſuch dare approach the ſhrine of COLLINS,
withdraw to a reſpectful diſtance, and, ſhould they
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:1196200700:5"/>
behold the ruins of genius, or the weakneſs of an
exalted mind, let them be taught to lament that
nature has left the nobleſt of their works imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
            <p>OF ſuch men of genius as have borne no public
character, it ſeldom happens that any memoirs can
be collected, of conſequence enough to be record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the biographer. If their lives paſs in obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
they are generally too uniform to engage our
attention; if they cultivate and obtain popularity,
envy and malignity will mingle their poiſon with
the draughts of praiſe; and through the induſtry
of thoſe unwearied fiends, their reputation will be
ſo chequered, and their characters ſo diſguiſed, that
it ſhall become difficult for the hiſtorian to ſeparate
truth from falſhood.</p>
            <p>OF our exalted poet, whoſe life, though far
from being popular, did not altogether paſs in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy,
we meet with few other accounts than ſuch
as the life of every man will afford, <hi>viz.</hi> when he
was born, where he was educated, and where he
died. Yet even theſe ſimple memoirs of the man
will not be unacceptable to thoſe who admire the
poet: for we never receive pleaſure without a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to be acquainted with the ſource from whence
it ſprings; a ſpecies of curioſity, which, as it ſeems
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:1196200700:6"/>
to be inſtinctive, was, probably, given us for the
noble end of gratitude; and, finally, to elevate the
enquiries of the mind to that fountain of perfection
from which all human excellence is derived.</p>
            <p>CHICHESTER, a city in Suſſex, had the honour
of giving birth to the author of the following po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems,
about the year 1721. His father, who was
a reputable tradeſman in that city, intended him
for the ſervice of the church; and with this view,
in the year 1733, he was admitted a ſcholar of that
illuſtrious ſeminary of genius and learning, Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter
college, where ſo many diſtinguiſhed men
of letters, ſo many excellent poets have received
their claſſical education. Here he had the good
fortune to continue ſeven years under the care of
the very learned Dr. Burton; and at the age of
nineteen, in the year 1740, he had merit ſufficient
to procure a diſtinguiſhed place in the liſt of thoſe
ſcholars, who are elected, upon the foundation of
Wincheſter, to New College in Oxford. But as
there were then no vacancies in that ſociety, he
was admitted a commoner of Queen's College in
the ſame univerſity; where he continued till July
1741, when he was elected a demy of Magdalen
College. During his reſidence at Queen's, he was
at once diſtinguiſhed for genius and indolence; his
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:1196200700:7"/>
exerciſes, when he could be prevailed upon to
write, bearing the viſible characteriſtics of both.
This remiſs and inattentive habit might probably
ariſe, in ſome meaſure, from diſappointment: he
had, no doubt, indulged very high ideas of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademical
mode of education, and when he found
ſcience within the fetters of logic and of Ariſtotle,
it was no wonder if he abated of his diligence to
ſcek her where the ſearch was attended with artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
perplexities, and where, at laſt, the purſuer
would graſp the ſhadow for the ſubſtance.</p>
            <p>WHILE he was at Magdalen College, he applied
himſelf chiefly to the cultivation of poetry, and
wrote the epiſtle to Sir Thomas Hanmer, and the
Oriental Eclogues, which, in the year 1742, were
publiſhed under the title of <hi>Perſian Eclogues.</hi>—The
ſucceſs of theſe poems was far from being equal to
their merit; but to a novice in the purſuit of fame,
the leaſt encouragement is ſufficient: if he does
not at once acquire that reputation to which his
merit intitles him, he embraces the encomiums of
the few, forgives the many, and intends to open
their eyes to the ſtriking beauties of his next Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication.</p>
            <p>WITH proſpects ſuch as theſe, probably, Mr.
Collins indulged his fancy, when, in the year 1743,
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:1196200700:8"/>
after having taken the degree of a batchelor of arts,
he left the univerſity, and removed to London.</p>
            <p>To a man of ſmall fortune, a liberal ſpirit, and
uncertain dependencies, the metropolis is a very
dangerous place. Mr. Collins had not been long in
town before he became an inſtance of the truth of
this obſervation. His pecuniary reſources were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted,
and to reſtore them by the exertion of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
and learning, though he wanted not the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
he had neither ſteadineſs nor induſtry. His ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities,
indeed, ſometimes carried him as far as a
ſcheme, or a title page for a book; but, whether
it were the power of diſſipation, or the genius of
repoſe that interfered, he could proceed no farther.
Several books were projected, which he was very able
to execute; and he became, in idea, an hiſtorian,
a critic, and a dramatic poet by turns. At one time he
determined to write an hiſtory of the revival of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
at another to tranſlate and comment upon
Ariſtotle's Poetics; then he turned his thoughts to
the Drama, and proceeded ſo far towards a trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy—as
to become acquainted with the manager.</p>
            <p>UNDER this unaccountable diſſipation, he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
the greateſt inconveniencies. Day ſucceeded
day, for the ſupport of which he had made no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion,
and in which he was to ſubſiſt either by the
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:1196200700:9"/>
long-repeated contributions of a friend, or the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity
of a caſual acquaintance.—Yet indolence
triumphed at once over want and ſhame; and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the anxieties of poverty, nor the heart-burning
of dependance had power to animate reſolution to
perſeverance.</p>
            <p>As there is a degree of depravity into which if a
man falls, he becomes incapable of attending to any
of the ordinary means that recall men to virtue, ſo
there are ſome circumſtances of indigence ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
degrading, that they deſtroy the influences
of ſhame itſelf; and moſt ſpirits are apt to ſink,
under their oppreſſion, into a ſullen and unambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
deſpondence.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER this might be with regard to Mr.
Collins, we find that, in the year 1746, he had
ſpirit and reſolution enough to publiſh his <hi>Odes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptive
and allegorical.</hi> Mr. MILLAR, a book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller
in the <hi>Strand,</hi> and a favourer of genius,
<hi>when once it has made its way to ſame,</hi> publiſhed
them ON THE AUTHOR'S ACCOUNT.—He hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
indeed, to be in the right not to publiſh
them on his own; for the ſale was by no means
ſucceſsful: and hence it was that the author, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
a juſt indignation againſt a blind and taſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
age, burnt the remaining copies with his own
hands.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:1196200700:10"/>
ALLEGORICAL and abſtracted poetry was above
the taſte of thoſe times, as much, or more than it
is of the preſent. It is in the lower walks, the
plain and practical paths of the muſes only that the
generality of men can be entertained. The higher
efforts of imagination are above their capacity;
and it is no wonder therefore, if the Odes deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
and allegorical met with few admirers.</p>
            <p>UNDER theſe circumſtances, ſo mortifying to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
juſt expectation, when neither his wants were
relieved, nor his reputation extended, he found
ſome conſolation in changing the ſcene, and viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his uncle, colonel MARTIN, who was, at that
time, with our army in Flanders. Soon after his
arrival, the colonel died, and left him a conſiderable
fortune.</p>
            <p>HERE, then, we ſhould hope to behold him
happy; poſſeſſed of independence, and removed
from every ſcene, and every monument of his former
miſery. But, fortune had delayed her favours till
they were not worth receiving. His faculties had
been ſo long harraſſed by anxiety, diſſipation, and
diſtreſs, that he fell into a nervous diſorder, which
brought with it an unconquerable depreſſion of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and at length reduced the fineſt underſtanding
to the moſt deplorable childiſhneſs. In the firſt
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:1196200700:11"/>

with ſhort intervals<note n="*" place="bottom">It ſeems to have been in one of theſe intervals, that he was viſited by an ingenious friend, who tells us he found him with a book in his hand, and being aſked what it was, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that "he had but one book, but that was the beſt."

            <p>MR. Collins was, in ſtature, ſomewhat above the
middle ſize; of a brown complexion, keen, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive
eyes, and a ſixed, ſedate aſpect, which, from
intenſe thinking, had contracted an habitual frown.
His proſiciency in letters was greater than could
have been expected from his years. He was ſkilled
in the learned languages, and acquainted with the
<hi>Italian, French,</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh.</hi>—It is obſervable that
none of his poems bear the marks of an amorous
diſpoſition, and that he is one of thoſe few poets, who
have ſailed to Delphi, without touching at Cythera.
The alluſions of this kind that appear in his Orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Eclogues were indiſpenſable in that ſpecies of
poetry; and it is very remarkable that in his <hi>Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
an ode for muſic, love is omitted, though it
ſhould have made a principal figure there.</p>

               <p>THE genius of the paſtoral, as well as of every
other reſpectable ſpecies of poetry, had its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
in the Eaſt, and from thence was tranſplanted by
the Muſes of Greece; but whether from the continent
of the leſſer Aſia, or from Egypt, which, about the
aera of the Grecian paſtoral, was the hoſpitable nurſe
of letters, it is not eaſy to determine. From the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
and the manner of Theocritus, one would incline
to the latter opinion, while the hiſtory of Bion is in
ſavour of the former.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER, though it ſhould ſtill remain a doubt
through what channel the paſtoral travelled weſtward,
there is not the leaſt ſhadow of uncertainty concerning
its Oriental origin.</p>
               <p>In thoſe ages, which, guided by ſacred chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
from a comparative view of time, we call the
early ages, it appears from the moſt authentic hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
that the chieſs of the people employed themſelves
in rural exerciſes, and that aſtronomers and legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
were at the ſame time ſhepherds. Thus Strabo
informs us that the hiſtory of the creation was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
to the Egyptians by a Chaldean ſhepherd.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:1196200700:79"/>
FROM theſe circumſtances it is evident not only
that ſuch ſhepherds were capable of all the dignity
and elegance peculiar to poetry, but that whatever
poetry they attempted would be of the paſtoral kind;
would take its ſubjects from thoſe ſcenes of rural ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
in which they were converſant, and, as it was
the offspring of Harmony and Nature, would employ
the powers it derived from the former to celebrate the
beauty and benevolence of the latter.</p>
               <p>ACCORDINGLY we find that the moſt ancient po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems
treat of agriculture, aſtronomy, and other objects
within the rural and natural ſyſtems.</p>
               <p>WHAT conſtitutes the difference between the Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic
and the Paſtoral is love, and the colloquial, or dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic
form of compoſition peculiar to the latter: this
form of compoſition is ſometimes diſpenſed with,
and love and rural imagery alone are thought ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to diſtinguiſh the paſtoral. The tender paſſion,
however, ſeems to be eſſential to this ſpecies of poetry,
and is hardly ever excluded from thoſe pieces that
were intended to come under this denomination: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in thoſe eclogues of the Amoebean kind, whoſe only
purport is a trial of ſkill between contending ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds,
love has its uſual ſhare, and the praiſes of
their reſpective miſteſſes are the general ſubjects of the
competitors.</p>
               <p>IT is to be lamented that ſcarce any oriental com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
of this kind have ſurvived the ravages of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:1196200700:80"/>
tyranny and time; we cannot doubt that
many ſuch have been extant, poſſibly as far down as
that fatal period, never to be mentioned in the world
of letters without horrour, when the glorious monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of human ingenuity periſhed in the aſhes of the
Alexandrian library.</p>
               <p>THOSE ingenious Creeks whom we call the parents
of paſtoral poetry were, probably, no more than imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators
of imitators, that derived their harmony from
higher and remoter ſources, and kindled their poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
fires at thoſe unextinguiſhed lamps which burned
within the tombs of oriental genius.</p>
               <p>IT is evident that Homer has availed himſelf of
thoſe magnificent images and deſcriptions ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to be met with in the books of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and why may not Theocritus, Moſchus and
Bion have found their archetypes in other eaſtern wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
whoſe names have periſhed with their works?
yet, though it may not be illiberal to admit ſuch a
ſuppoſition, it would, certainly, be invidious to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clued
what the malignity of cavillers alone could ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
with regard to Homer, that they deſtroyed the
ſources from which they borrowed, and, as it is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
of the young of the pelican, drained their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters
to death.</p>
               <p>As the ſeptuagint-tranſlation of the Old Teſtament
was performed at the requeſt, and under the patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:1196200700:81"/>
of Ptolemy Philadelphus, it were not to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
if Theocritus, who was entertained at that
prince's court, had borrowed ſome part of his paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
imagery from the poetical paſſages of thoſe books.—I
think it can hardly be doubted that the Sicilian
poet had in his eye certain expreſſions of the prophet
Iſaiah, when he wrote the following lines.</p>

               <p>The cauſe, indeed, of theſe phenomena is very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in the Greek from what it is in the Hebrew po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et;
the former employing them on the death, the
latter on the birth of an important perſon: but the
marks of imitation are nevertheleſs obvious.</p>
               <p>IT might, however, be expected that if Theocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
had borrowed at all from the ſacred writers, the
celebrated paſtoral Epithalamium of Solomon, ſo
much within his own walk of Poetry, would not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
have eſcaped his notice. His Epithalamium on
the marriage of Helena, moreover, gave him an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:1196200700:82"/>
field for imitation; therefore, if he has any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations
to the royal bard, we may expect to find
them there. The very opening of the poem is in the
ſpirit of the Hebrew ſong:

This deſcription of Helen is infinitely above the ſtyle
and figure of the Sicilian paſtoral—"She is like the
riſing of the golden morning, when the night de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth,
and when the winter is over and gone.
She reſembleth the cypreſs in the garden, the
horſe in the chariots of Theſſaly." Theſe figures
plainly declare their origin, and others equally imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
might be pointed out in the ſame idyllium.</p>
               <p>THIS beautiful and luxuriant marriage-paſtoral of
Solomon is the only perfect form of the oriental ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
that has ſurvived the ruins of time; a happineſs
for which it is, probably, more indebted to its ſacred
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:1196200700:83"/>
character than to its intrinſic merit. Not that it is by
any means deſtitute of poetical excellence: like all the
eaſtern poetry, it is bold, wild and unconnected in
its figures, alluſions and parts, and has all that grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and magnificent daring which characteriſes its
metaphorical and comparative imagery.</p>
               <p>IN conſequence of theſe peculiarities, ſo ill adapted
to the frigid genius of the north, Mr. COLLINS could
make but little uſe of it as a precedent for his oriental
eclogues; and even in his third eclogue, where the
ſubject is of a ſimilar nature, he has choſen rather to
follow the mode of the Doric and the Latian paſtoral.</p>
               <p>THE ſcenery and ſubjects then of the following ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues
alone are Oriental; the ſtyle and colouring are
purely European; and, for this reaſon, the author's
preface, in which he intimates that he had the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
from a merchant who traded to the Eaſt, is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
as being now altogether ſuperfluous.</p>
               <p>WITH regard to the merit of theſe eclogues, it
may juſtly be aſſerted, that in ſimplicity of deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and expreſſion, in delicacy and ſoftneſs of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
and in natural and unaffected tenderneſs, they
are not to be equalled by any thing of the paſtoral

               <p>THIS eclogue, which is entitled Selim, or the
Shepherd's Moral, as there is nothing drama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic
in the ſubject, may be thought the leaſt entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the four: but it is, by no means, the leaſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable.
The moral precepts which the intelligent
ſhepherd delivers to his fellow-ſwains and virgins,
their companions, are ſuch as would infallibly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
the happineſs of the paſtoral life.</p>
               <p>IN imperſonating the private <hi>virtues,</hi> the poet has
obſerved great propriety, and has formed their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogy
with the moſt perfect judgment, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents
them as the daughters of <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>wiſdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE characteriſtics of <hi>Modeſty</hi> and <hi>Chaſtity</hi> are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
happy and <hi>peintureſque:</hi>

                     <l>To lead the train, ſweet <hi>Modeſty</hi> appear!</l>
                     <l>With thee be <hi>Chaſtity,</hi> of all afraid,</l>
                     <l>Diſtruſting all, a wiſe ſuſpicious maid;</l>
                     <l>Cold is her breaſt, <hi>like flowers that drink the dew,</hi>

The two <hi>ſimiles</hi> borrowed from rural objects are not
only much, in character, but perfectly natural and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive.
There is, notwithſtanding, this defect in
the former, that it wants a peculiar propriety; for
purity of thought may as well be applied to <hi>chaſtity</hi>
as to <hi>modeſty;</hi> and from this inſtance, as well as from
a thouſand more, we may ſee the neceſſity of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing,
in characteriſtic poetry, every object by
marks and attributes peculiarly its own.</p>
               <p>IT cannot be objected to this eclogue that it wants
both theſe eſſential <hi>criteria</hi> of the paſtoral, love and
the drama; for though it partakes not of the latter,
the former ſtill retains an intereſt in it, and that too
very material, as it profeſſedly conſults the virtue and
happineſs of the lover, while it informs what are the
qualities
—that muſt lead to love.</p>

               <p>ALL the advantages that any ſpecies of poetry
can derive from the novelty of the ſubject and
ſcenery, this eclogue poſſeſſes. The rout of a camel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driver
is a ſcene that ſcarce could exiſt in the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of an European, and of its attendant diſtreſſes
he could have no idea.—Theſe are very happily and
minutely painted by our deſcriptive poet. What ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
ſimpliciry of expreſſion! what nervous plainneſs
in the opening of the poem!
<q>
                     <l>In ſilent horror o'er the boundleſs waſte</l>
                     <l>The driver Haſſan with the camels paſt.</l>
                  </q>
The magic pencil of the poet brings the whole ſcene
before us at once, as it were by enchantment, and in
this ſingle couplet we feel all the effect that ariſes from
the terrible wildneſs of a region unenlivened by the
habitations of men. The verſes that deſcribe ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutely
the camel-driver's little proviſions, have a touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
influence on the imagination, and prepare to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
more feelingly into his future apprehensions of
diſtreſs:
<q>
                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:1196200700:87"/>
                     <l>Bethink thee Haſſan, where ſhall thirſt aſſuage,</l>
                     <l>When fails this cruiſe, his unrelenting rage!</l>
                  </q>
It is difficult to ſay whether his apoſtrophe to, the
"mute companions of his toils" is more to be
admired for the elegance and beauty of the poetical
imagery, or for the tenderneſs and humanity of the
ſentiment. He who can read it without being affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
will do his heart no injuſtice, if he concludes it to
be deſtitute of ſenſibility:
<q>
                     <l>Ye mute companions of my toils, that bear</l>
                     <l>In all my grieſs a more than equal ſhare!</l>
                     <l>Here, where no ſprings in murmur break away,</l>
                     <l>Or moſs-crown'd fountains mitigate the day,</l>
                     <l>In vain ye hope the green delights to know,</l>
                     <l>Which plains more bleſt, or verdant vales beſtow:</l>
                     <l>Here rocks alone, and taſteleſs ſands are found,</l>
                     <l>And faint and ſickly winds for ever howl around.</l>
                  </q>
Yet in theſe beautiful lines there is a flight error,
which writers of the greateſt genius very frequently
fall into.—It will be needleſs to obſerve to the accurate
reader that in the fifth and ſixth verſes there is a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal
pleonaſm, where the poet ſpeaks of the <hi>green</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
of <hi>verdant</hi> vales. There is an overſight of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:1196200700:88"/>
the ſame kind, in the Manners, an Ode; where the
poet ſays,
<q>
                     <l>—Seine's <hi>blue</hi> nymphs deplore,</l>
                     <l>In <hi>watchet</hi> weeds—</l>
                  </q>
This fault is indeed a common one, but to a reader
of taſte it is nevertheleſs diſguſtful; and it is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
here as the error of a man of genius and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that men of genius and judgment may guard
againſt it.</p>
               <p>MR. COLLINS ſpeaks like a true Poet as well in ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent
as expreſſion, when, with regard to the thirſt
of wealth, he ſays,
<q>
                     <l>Why heed we not, while mad we haſte along,</l>
                     <l>The gentle voice of peace, or pleaſure's ſong?</l>
                     <l>Or wherefor think die flowery mountain's ſide,</l>
                     <l>The fountain's murmurs, and the valley's pride,</l>
                     <l>Why think we theſe leſs pleaſing to behold,</l>
                     <l>Than dreary deſerts, if, they lead to gold?</l>
                  </q>
But, however juſt theſe ſentiments may appear to thofſe
who have not revolted from nature and ſimplicity, had
the author proclaimed them in Lombard-ſtreet, or
Cheapſide, he would, not have been complimented with
the underſtanding of the bellman.—A ſtriking proof
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:1196200700:89"/>
that our own particular ideas of happineſs regulate
our opinions concerning the ſenſe and wiſdom of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers!</p>
               <p>It is impoſſible to take leave of this moſt beautiful
eclogue without paying the tribute of admiration ſo
juſtly due to the following nervous lines.
<q>
                     <l>What if the lion in his rage I meet!—</l>
                     <l>Oft in the duſt I view his printed feet:</l>
                     <l>And fearful! oft, when day's declining light</l>
                     <l>Yields her pale empire to thc mourner night,</l>
                     <l>By hunger rous'd, he ſcours the groaning plain,</l>
                     <l>Gaunt wolves and fullen tygers in his train:</l>
                     <l>Before them death with ſhrieks directs their way,</l>
                     <l>Fills the wild yell, and leads them to their prey.</l>
                  </q>
This, amongſt many other paſſages to be met with in
the writings of Collins, ſhews that his genius was
perfectly capable of the grand and magnificent in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription,
notwithſtanding what a learned writer has
advanced to the contrary. Nothing, certainly, could
be more greatly conceived, or more adequately ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
than the image in the laſt couplet.</p>
               <p>THAT deception, ſometimes uſed in rhetoric and
poetry, which preſents us with an object, or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent
contrary to what we expected, is here intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to the greateſt advantage:
<q>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:1196200700:90"/>
                     <l>Farewell the youth, whom ſighs could not detain,</l>
                     <l>Whom Zara's breaking heart implor'd in vain!</l>

                     <l>Weak and unfelt as theſe rejected ſighs!</l>
                  </q>

than a real, or natural beauty.</p>

               <p>THAT innocence, and native ſimplicity of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
which, in the firſt eclogue, was allowed
to conſtitute the happineſs of love, is here beautifully
deſcribed in its effects. The Sultan of Perſia marries
a Georgian ſhepherdeſs, and finds in her embraces
that genuine felicity which unperverted nature alone
can beſtow. The moſt natural and beautiful parts of
this eclogue are thoſe where the fair Sultana refers
with ſo much pleaſure to her paſtoral amuſements,
and thoſe ſcenes of happy innocence in which ſhe had
paſſed her early years; particularly when, upon her
firſt departure,
<q>
                     <l>Oft as ſhe went, ſhe backward turn'd her view,</l>
                     <l>And bad that crook and bleating flock adieu.</l>

               <p>THE beautiful, but unfortunate country, where
the ſcene of this pathetic eclogue is laid, had
been recently torn in pieces by the depredations of its
ſavage neighbours, when Mr. Collins ſo affectingly
deſcribed its misfortunes. This ingenious man had
not only a pencil to pourtray, but a heart to feel for
the miſeries of mankind, and it is with the utmoſt
tenderneſs and humanity he enters into the narrative
of Circaſſia's ruin, while he realizes the ſcene, and
brings the preſent drama before us. Of every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
that could poſſibly contribute to the tender
effect this paſtoral was deſigned to produce, the poet
has availed himſelf with the utmoſt art and addreſs.
Thus he prepares the heart to pity the diſtreſſes of
Circaſſia, by repreſenting it as the ſcene of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt
love.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>In fair Circaſſia, where, to love inclin'd,</l>
                  <l>Each ſwain was bleſt, for every maid was kind.</l>
               </q>
               <p>To give the circumſtances of the dialogue a more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
ſolemnity, he makes the time midnight, and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:1196200700:93"/>
deſcribes the two ſhepherds in the very act of flight
from the deſtruction that ſwept over their country:
<q>
                     <l>Sad o'er the dews, two brother ſhepherds fled,</l>
                     <l>Where wildering fear and deſperate ſorrow led:</l>
                  </q>
There is a beauty and propriety in the epithet <hi>wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
which ſtrikes us more forcibly, the more we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
it.</p>
               <p>THE opening of the dialogue is equally happy,
natural and unaffected; when one of the ſhepherds,
weary and overcome with the flight, calls upon his
companion to review the length of way they had paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.—This
is, certainly, painting from nature, and the
thoughts, however obvious, or deſtitute of refinement,
are perfectly in character. But as the cloſeſt purſuit
of nature is the ſureſt way to excellence in general,
and to ſublimity in particular, in poetical deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ſo we find that this ſimple ſuggeſtion of the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
is not unattended with magnificence. There is
grandeur and variety in the landſkip he deſcribes:
<q>
                     <l>And firſt review that long extended plain,</l>
                     <l>And yon wide groves, already paſt with pain!</l>
                     <l>Yon ragged cliff, whoſe dangerous path we tried!</l>
                     <l>And laſt, this lofty mountain's weary ſide.</l>
                  </q>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:1196200700:94"/>
There is, in imitative harmony, an act of expreſſing
a ſlow and difficult movement by adding to the uſual
number of pauſes in a verſe. This is obſervable in
the line that deſcribes the aſcent of the mountain:
<q>And laſt ‖ this loſty mountain's ‖ weary ſide ‖</q>
Here we find the number of pauſes, or muſical bars,
which, in an heroic verſe, is commonly two, increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to three.</p>
               <p>THE liquid melody, and the numerous ſweetneſs of
expreſſion in the following deſcriptive lines is almoſt
inimitably beautiful:
<q>
                     <l>Sweet to the fight is Zabran's flowery plain,</l>
                     <l>And once by nymphs and ſhepherds lov'd in vain!</l>
                     <l>No more the virgins ſhall delight to rove</l>
                     <l>By Sargis' banks, or Irwan's ſhaddy grove;</l>
                     <l>On Tarkie's mountain catch the cooling gale,</l>
                     <l>Or breathe the ſweets of Aly's flowery vale.</l>

Nevertheleſs in this delightful landſkip there is an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
ſault: there is no diſtinction between the plain
of Zabran and the vale of Aly; they are both <hi>flowery,</hi>
and conſequently undiverſiſied. This could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from the poet's want of judgment, but from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attention:
it had not occurred to him that he had
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:1196200700:95"/>
employed the epithet <hi>flowery</hi> twice within ſo ſhort a
compaſs; an overſight which thoſe who are accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed
to poetical, or, indeed, to any other ſpecies
of compoſition, know to be very poſſible.</p>
               <p>NOTHING can be more beautifully conceived, or

                  <l>Their eye's blue languiſh, and their golden hair!</l>
                  <l>Thoſe eyes in tears their fruitleſs grief ſhall ſend;</l>
                  <l>Thoſe hairs the Tartar's cruel hand ſhall rend.</l>

               <p>THE genius of COLLINS was capable of every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of excellence in lyric poetry, and perfectly
qualified for that high province of the muſe. Poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of a native ear for all the varieties of harmony and
modulation, ſuſceptible of the fineſt feelings of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
and humanity, but, above all, carried away
by that high enthuſiaſm, which gives to imagination
its ſtrongeſt colouring, he was, at once, capable of
ſoothing the ear with the melody of his numbers, of
influencing the paſſions by the force of his <hi>pathos,</hi> and
of gratifying the fancy by the luxury of deſcription.</p>
               <p>IN conſequence of theſe powers, but, more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly,
in conſideration of the laſt, he choſe ſuch
ſubjects for his lyric eſſays as were moſt favourable for
the indulgence of deſcription and allegory; where he
could exerciſe his powers in moral and perſonal paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
where he could exert his invention in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
new attributes on images or objects already
known, and deſcribed, by a determinate number of
characteriſtics; where he might give an uncommon
eclat to his figures, by placing them in higher atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:1196200700:98"/>
or in more advantageous lights, and introduce
new forms from the moral and intellectual world into
the ſociety of inperſonated beings.</p>
               <p>SUCH, no doubt, were the advantages he derived
from the deſcriptive and allegorical nature of his
themes.</p>
               <p>IT ſeems to have been the whole induſtry of our
author (and it is, at the ſame time, almoſt all the
claim to moral excellence his writings can boaſt) to
promote the influence of the ſocial virtues, by paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them in the faireſt and happieſt lights.
<q>Melior fieri tuendo,</q>
would be no improper motto to his poems in general,
but of his lyric poems it ſeems to be the whole moral
tendency and effect. If, therefor, it ſhould appear
to ſome readers that he has been more induſtrious to
cultivate deſcription than ſentiment; it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
that his deſcriptions themſelves are ſentimental,
and anſwer the whole end of that ſpecies of writing,
by embelliſhing every feature of virtue, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying,
through the effects of the pencil, the fineſt
moral leſſons to the mind.</p>
               <p>HORACE ſpeaks of the fidelity of the ear in preſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the uncertainty of the eye; but if the mind
receives conviction, it is, certainly, of very little im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:1196200700:99"/>
through what medium, or by which of the
ſenſes it is conveyed. The impreſſions left on the
imagination may, poſſibly, be thought leſs durable
than the depoſits of the memory, but it may very
well admit of a queſtion whether a concluſion of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
or an impreſſion of imagination, will ſooneſt make
its way to the heart. A moral precept conveyed in
words is only an account of truth in its effects; a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
picture is truth exemplified; and which is moſt
likely to gain on the affections, it may not be difficult
to determine.</p>
               <p>THIS, however, muſt be allowed, that thoſe works
approach the neareſt to perfection which unite theſe
powers and advantages; which at once influence the
imagination, and engage the memory; the former
by the force of animated, and ſtriking deſcription,
the latter by a brief but harmonious conveyance of
precept: thus, while the heart is influenced through
the operation of the paſſions, or the fancy, the effect,
which might otherwiſe have been tranſient, is ſecur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the co-operating power of the memory, which
treaſures up in a ſhort aphoriſm the moral of the
ſcene.</p>
               <p>THIS is a good reaſon, and this, perhaps, is the
only reaſon that can be given, why our dramatic per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances
ſhould generally end with a chain of coup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets.
In theſe the moral of the whole piece is uſually
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:1196200700:100"/>
conveyed, and that aſſiſtance which the memory bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
from rhyme, as it was probably the original
cauſe of it, gives its uſefulneſs and propriety even there.</p>
               <p>AFTER theſe apologies for the <hi>deſcriptive</hi> turn of
the following odes, ſomething remains to be ſaid on
the origin and uſe of <hi>allegory</hi> in poetical compoſition.</p>
               <p>BY this we are not to underſtand the trope in the
ſchools, which is defined <hi>aliud verbis, aliud ſenſu
oſtendere,</hi> and of which Quintilian ſays, <hi>Uſus eſt, ut
triſtia dicamus melioribus verbis, out bonae rei gratia
quaedam contrariis ſignificemus,</hi> etc. It is not the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,
but the ſentimental allegory, not allegorical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
(which, indeed, might come under the term
of <hi>metaphor</hi>) but allegorical imagery, that is here
in queſtion.</p>
               <p>WHEN we endeavour to trace this ſpecies of figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
ſentiment to its origin, we find it coeval with
literature itſelf. It is generally agreed that the moſt
ancient productions are poetical, and it is certain
that the moſt ancient poems abound with allegorical
imagery.</p>
               <p>IF, then, it be allowed that the firſt literary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions
were poetical, we ſhall have little or no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
in diſcovering the origin of allegory.</p>
               <p>At the birth of letters, in the tranſition from hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphical
to literal expreſſion, it is not to be wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
if the cuſtom of expreſſing ideas by perſonal ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:1196200700:101"/>
which, had ſo long prevailed, ſhould ſtill retain
its influence on the mind, though the uſe of letters
had rendered the practical application of it ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
Thoſe who had been accuſtomed to exprefs
ſtrength by the image of an elephant, ſwiftneſs by
that of a panther, and courage by that of a lion,
would make no ſcruple of ſubſtituting, in letters, the
ſymbols for the ideas they had been uſed to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
               <p>HERE we plainly ſee the origin of <hi>allegorical expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi>
that it aroſe from the <hi>aſhes</hi> of hieroglyphics;
and if to the ſame cauſe we ſhould refer that figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
boldneſs of ſtyle and imagery which diſtinguiſh
the oriental writings, we ſhall, perhaps, conclude
more juſtly, than if we ſhould impute it to the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
grandeur of the eaſtern genius.</p>
               <p>FROM the ſame ſource with the <hi>verbal,</hi> we are to
derive the <hi>ſentimental</hi> allegory, which is nothing more
than a continuation of the metaphorical or ſymbolical
expreſſion of the ſeveral agents in an action, or the
different objects in a ſcene.</p>
               <p>The latter moſt peculiarly comes under the denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of allegorical imagery; and in this ſpecies of
allegory we include the imperſonation of paſſions, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
virtues and vices, <hi>etc.</hi> on account of which,
principally, the following odes were properly termed
by their author, allegorical.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:1196200700:102"/>
WITH reſpect to the utility of this figurative writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the ſame arguments, that have been advanced in
favour of deſcriptive poetry, will be of weight like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
here. It is, indeed from imperſonation, or, as
it is commonly termed perſonification, that poetical
deſcription borrows its chief powers and graces. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the aid of this, moral and intellectual painting
would be flat and unanimated, and even the ſcenery
of material objects would be dull without the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of fictitious life.</p>
               <p>THESE obſervations will be moſt effectually illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated
by the ſublime and beautiful odes that occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
them: in thoſe it will appear how happily this
allegorical painting may be executed by the genuine
powers of poetical genius, and they will not fail to
prove its force and utility by paſſing through the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
to the heart.</p>

Suffex, in which country the Arun is a ſmall river,
had the honour of giving birth to OTWAY as well as
to COLLINS. Both theſe poets became the objects
of that pity by which their writings are diſtinguiſhed.
There was a ſimilitude in their genius and in their
ſufferings. There was a reſemblance in the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
and in the diſſipation of their lives; and the
circumſtances of their death cannot be remembered
without pain.</p>
               <p>THE thought of painting in the temple of Pity the

It is impoſſible to contemplate the image conveyed in

The archetype of the Engliſh poet's idea was in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

That nutritive enthuſiaſm, which cheriſhes the ſeeds of
poetry, and which is, indeed, the only ſoil wherein
they will grow to perfection, lays open the mind to
ail the influences of fiction. A paſſion for whatever
is greatly wild, or magnificent in the works of nature,
ſeduces the imagination to attend to all that is extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant,
however unnatural. Milton was notoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Collins, who in genius and enthuſiaſm bore no very

               <p>THIS ode is ſo infinitely abſtracted and replete
with high enthuſiaſm, that it will find few readers
capable of entering into the ſpirit of it, or of reliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
its beauties. There is a ſtyle of ſentiment as ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
unintelligible to common capacities, as if the
ſubject were treated in an unknown language; and it
is on the ſame account that abſtratcted poetry will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have many admirers. The authors of ſuch po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems
muſt be content with the approbation of thoſe
heaven-favoured geniuſes, who, by a ſimiliarity of
taſte and ſentiment, are enabled to penetrate the high
myſterics of inſpired fancy, and to purſue the loftieſt
flights of enthuſiaſtic imagination. Nevertheleſs the
praiſe of the diſtinguiſhed few is certainly preferable
to the applauſe of the undiſcerning million; for all
praiſe is valuable in proportion to the judgment of
thoſe who conſer it.</p>
               <p>As the ſubject of this ode is uncommon, ſo are the
ſtyle and expreſſion highly metaphorical and abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:1196200700:112"/>
thus the ſun is called "the rich-hair'd youth of
morn," the ideas are termed "the ſhadowy tribes
of mind," <hi>etc.</hi> We are ſtruck with the propriety
of this mode of expreſſion here, and it aſſords us new
proofs of the analogy that ſubſiſts between language
and ſentiment.</p>
               <p>NOTHING can be more loſtily imagined than the
creation of the Ceſtus of Fancy in this ode: the alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorical
imagery is rich and ſublime: and the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
that, the dangerous paſſions kept aloof, during
the operation, is founded on the ſtricteſt philoſophical
truth; for poetical fancy can exiſt only in minds that
are perfectly ſerene, and in ſome meaſure abſtracted
from the influences of ſenſe.</p>

                  </q>
This alludes to a fragment of Alcaeus ſtill remaining,
in which the poet celebrates Harmodius and Ariſtogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:1196200700:115"/>
who ſlew the tyrant Hipparchus, and thereby

               <p>THE fall of Rome is here moſt nervouſly deſcribed
in one line:
<q>With heavieſt ſound, a giant-ſtatue, fell.</q>
The thought ſeems altogether new, and the imitative
harmony in the ſtructure of the verſe is admirable.</p>
               <p>AFTER, bewailing the ruin of ancient liberty, the
poet conſiders the influence it has retained, or ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,

and the ſmall Marino, which, however unreſpectable
with regard to power or extent of territory, has, at
leaſt, this diſtinction to boaſt, that it has preſerved
its liberty longer than any other ſtate ancient or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern,
having, without any revolution, retained its
preſent mode of government near 1400 years. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
the patron ſaint who founded it, and from whom

is, perhaps, the only ſaint that ever contributed to
the eſtabliſhment of freedom.

               <p>THE iambic kind of numbers, in which this ode

and plaintive ſubjects, as for thoſe where ſtrength or
rapidity is required—This, perhaps, is owing to the
repetition of the ſtrain in the ſame ſtanza; for ſorrow
rejects variety, and affects an uniformity of complaint.

               <head>ODE TO EVENING.</head>
               <p>THE blank ode has for ſome time ſolicited ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
into the Engliſh poetry; but its efforts
hitherto ſeem to have been vain, at leaſt its recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
has been no more than partial. It remains a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
then, whether there is not ſomething in the
nature of blank verſe leſs adapted to the lyric than to
the heroic meaſure, ſince, though it has been gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
received in the latter, it is yet unadopted in the
former. In order to diſcover this, we are to conſider
the different modes of theſe different ſpecies of poetry.
That of the heroic is uniform; that of the lyric is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious:
and in theſe circumſtances of uniformity and
variety, probably, lies the cauſe why blank verſe
has been ſucceſsful in the one, and unacceptable in
the other. While it preſented itſelf only in one form,
it was familiarized to the ear by cuſtom; but where
it was obliged to aſſume the different ſhapes of the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric
muſe, it ſeemed ſtill a ſtranger of uncouth figure,
was received rather with curioſity than with pleaſure,
and entertained without that eaſe, or ſatisfaction,
which acquaintance and familiarity produce—More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
the heroic blank verſe obtained a ſanction of
infinite importance to its general reception, when it
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:1196200700:120"/>
was adopted by one of the greateſt poets the world e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
produced, and was made the vehicle of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt
poem that ever was written. When this poem
at length extorted that applauſe which ignorance and
prejudice had united to withhold, the verſification ſoon
found its imitators, and became more generally ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful
than even in thoſe countries from whence it was
imported. But lyric blank verſe has met with no ſuch
advantages; for Mr. Collins, whoſe genius and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in harmony might have given it ſo powerful an
effect, has left us but one ſpecimen of it in the Ode to
Evening.</p>
               <p>IN the choice of his meaſure he ſeems to have had
in his eye Horace's ode to Pyrrha; for this ode bears
the neareſt reſemblance to that mixt kind of the aſcle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piad
and pherecratic verſe; and that reſemblance in
ſome degree reconciles us to the want of rhyme, while
it reminds us of thoſe great maſters of antiquity,
whoſe works had no need of this whimſical jingle
of ſounds.</p>
               <p>FROM the following paſſage one might be induced
to think that the poet had it in view to render his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
and his verſification ſuitable to each other on this
occaſion, and that, when he addreſſed himſelf to the
ſober power of evening, he had thought proper to lay
aſide the ſoppery of rhyme;
<q>
                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:1196200700:121"/>
                     <l>Now teach me, Maid compos'd,</l>
                     <l>To breathe ſome <hi>ſoſten'd</hi> ſtrain,</l>
                     <l>Whoſe numbers ſtealing thro' thy dark'ning vale,</l>
                     <l>May not unſeemly with its <hi>ſtillneſs</hi> ſuit;</l>
                     <l>As, muſing ſlow, I hail</l>
                     <l>Thy genial, lov'd return!</l>
                  </q>
But whatever were the numbers, or the verſification
of this ode, the imagery and enthuſiaſm it contains
could not fail of rendering it delightful. No other of
Mr. Collins's odes is more generally characteriſtic of
his genius. In one place we diſcover his paſſion for
viſionary beings:
<q>
                     <l>For when thy ſolding ſtar ariſing ſhews</l>
                     <l>His paly circlet, at his warning lamp</l>
                     <l>The fragrant Hours and Elves</l>
                     <l>Who ſlept in buds the day,</l>
                  </q>
                  <q>
                     <l>And many a nymph, who wreaths her brows with fedge,</l>
                     <l>And ſheds the freſhening dew, and, lovelier ſtill,</l>
                     <l>The penſive pleaſures ſweet</l>
                     <l>Prepare thy ſhadowy car.</l>
                  </q>
In another we behold his ſtrong bias to melancholy:
<q>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:1196200700:122"/>
                     <l>Then let me rove ſome wild and heathy ſcene,</l>
                     <l>Or find ſome ruin 'midſt its dreary dells,</l>
                     <l>Whoſe walls more awful nod</l>
                     <l>By thy religious gleams.</l>
                  </q>
Then appears his taſte for what is wildly grand and
magnificent in nature; when, prevented by ſtorms
from enjoying his evening walk, he wiſhes for a ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
<q>
                     <l>That from the mountain's ſide,</l>
                     <l>Views wilds and ſwelling floods.</l>
                  </q>
And, through the whole, his invariable attachment to
the expreſſion of painting;
<q>
                     <l>—and marks o'er all</l>
                     <l>Thy dewy fingers draw</l>
                     <l>The gradual, duſky veil.</l>
                  </q>
It might be a ſufficient encomium on this beautiful
ode to obſerve, that it has been particularly admired
by a lady to whom Nature has given the moſt perfect
principles of taſte. She has not even complained of
the want of rhyme in it, a circumſtance by no means
unfavourable to the cauſe of lyric blank verſe; ſor
ſurely, if a fair reader can endure an ode without
bells and chimes, the maſculine genius may diſpenſe

               <head>THE MANNERS. AN ODE.</head>
               <p>FROM the ſubject and ſentiments of this ode, it
ſeems not improbable that the author wrote it
about the time when he left the Univerſity; when, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
with the purſuit of academical ſtudies, he no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
confined himſelf to the ſearch of theoretical know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,
but commenced the <hi>ſcholar of humanity,</hi> to ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
nature in her works, and man in ſociety.</p>
               <p>THE following farewell to ſcience exhibits a very
juſt as well as ſtriking picture; for however exalted
in the theory the Platonic doctrines may appear, it is
certain that Platoniſm and Pyrrhoniſm are nearly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied:
<q>
                     <l>Farewell the porch, whoſe roof is ſeen</l>
                     <l>Arch'd with th' enlivening olive's green:</l>
                     <l>Where Science, prank'd in tiſſued veſt,</l>
                     <l>By Reaſon, Pride, and Fancy dreſt,</l>
                     <l>Comes like a bride, ſo trim array'd,</l>
                     <l>To wed with Doubt in Plato's ſhade!</l>
                  </q>
When the mind goes in purſuit of viſionary ſyſtems,
it is not far from the regions of doubt; and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
its capacity to think abſtractedly, to reaſon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:1196200700:124"/>
the more it will be expoſed to and bewildered in
uncertainty.—From an enthuſiaſtic warmth of temper,
indeed, we may for a while be encouraged to perſiſt
in ſome adopted ſyſtem; but when that enhuſiaſm,
which is founded on the vivacity of the paſſions, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
cools and dies away with them, the opinions
it ſupported drop from us, and we are thrown upon
the inhoſpitable ſhore of doubt.—A ſtriking proof of
the neceſſity of ſome moral rule of wiſdom and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and ſome ſyſtem of happineſs eſtabliſhed by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring
knowlege and unlimited power!</p>
               <p>IN the poet's addreſs to Humour in this ode, there
is one image of ſingular beauty and propriety. The
ornaments in the hair of <hi>wit</hi> are of ſuch a nature,
and diſpoſed in ſuch a manner, as to be perfectly ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical
and characteriſtic:
<q>
                     <l>Me too amidſt thy band admit,</l>
                     <l>There, where the young-ey'd, healthful Wit,</l>
                     <l>(Whoſe jewels in his. criſped hair</l>
                     <l>Are plac'd each other's beams to ſhare,</l>
                     <l>Whom no delights from thee divide)</l>
                     <l>In laughter loos'd attends thy ſide.</l>
                  </q>
Nothing could be more expreſſive of wit, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
in a happy colliſion of comparative and relative
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:1196200700:125"/>
images, than this reciprocal reflection of light from
the diſpoſition of the jewels.
<q>
                     <l>O Humour, thou whoſe name is known</l>
                     <l>To Briton's favour'd iſle alone!</l>
                  </q>
The author could only mean to apply this to the
time when he wrote, ſince other nations had produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
works of great humour as he himſelf acknowleges
afterwards.
<q>
                     <l>By old Miletus, <hi>etc.</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>By all you taught the Tuſcan maids, <hi>etc.</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q>
The Mileſian and Tuſcan romances were by no means
diſtinguiſhed for humour; but as they were the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels
of that ſpecies of writing in which humour was
afterwards employed, they are, probably for that
reaſon only, mentioned here.</p>

               <head type="sub">An Ode for Muſic.</head>
               <p>IF the muſic, which was compoſed for this ode, had
equal merit with the ode itſelf, it muſt have been
the moſt excellent performance of the kind, in which
poetry and muſic have, in modern times, united.
Other pieces of the ſame nature have derived their
greateſt reputation from the perfection of the muſic
that accompanied them, having in themſelves little
more merit than that of an ordinary ballad: but in
this we have the whole ſoul and power of poetry—Expreſſion
that, even without the aid of muſic, ſtrikes
to the heart; and imagery, of power enough to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport
the attention without the forceful alliance of
correſponding ſounds! what, then, muſt have been
the effect of theſe united!</p>
               <p>IT is very obſervable that though the meaſure is
the ſame, in which the muſical efforts of fear, anger
and deſpair are deſcribed, yet by the variation of the
cadence, the character and operation of each is ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expreſſed: thus particularly of deſpair:
<q>
                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:1196200700:127"/>
                     <l>With woeful meaſures wan Deſpair—</l>
                     <l>Low ſullen ſounds his grief beguil'd,</l>
                     <l>A ſolemn, ſtrange and mingled air,</l>
                     <l>'Twas ſad by fits; by ſtarts 'twas wild.</l>
                  </q>
He muſt be a very unſkilful compoſer who could not
catch the power of imitative harmony from theſe lines.</p>
               <p>THE picture of Hope that follows this is beautiful
almoſt beyond imitation. By the united powers of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery
and harmony, that delightful Being is exhibited
with all the charms and graces that pleaſure and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
have appropriated to her:
<q>
                     <l>Relegat, qui ſemel percurrit;</l>
                     <l>Qui nunquam legit, legat.</l>
                  </q>
                  <q>
                     <l>But thou, O Hope! with eyes ſo fair,</l>
                     <l>What was thy delighted meaſure?</l>
                     <l>Still it whiſper'd promis'd pleaſure,</l>
                     <l>And bad the lovely ſeenes at diſtance hail!</l>
                     <l>Still would her touch the ſtrain prolong,</l>
                     <l>And from the rocks, the woods, the vale,</l>
                     <l>She call'd on Echo ſtill thro' all the ſong;</l>
                     <l>And where her ſweeteſt theme ſhe choſe,</l>
                     <l>A ſoft reſponſive voice was heard at every cloſe,</l>
                     <l>And Hope enchanted ſmil'd, and wav'd her gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
hair.</l>
                  </q>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:1196200700:128"/>
In what an exalted light does the above ſtanza place
this great maſter of imagery and harmony! what va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
ſweetneſs of numbers! what delicacy of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and expreſſion! how characteriſtically does Hope
prolong her ſtrain, repeat her ſoothing cloſes, call
upon her aſſociate Echo for the ſame purpoſes, and
diſplay every pleaſing grace peculiar to her!
<q>And Hope enchanted ſmil'd, and wav'd her golden
hair.</q>
                  <q>
                     <l>Legat, qui nunquam legit;</l>
                     <l>Qui ſemel percurrit, relegat.</l>
                  </q>
The deſcriptions of joy, jealouſy and revenge are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
though not equally ſo; thoſe of melancholy
and chearfulneſs are ſuperior to every thing of the
kind; and, upon the whole, there may be very little
hazard in aſſerting that this is the fineſt ode in the
Engliſh language.</p>

            <p>MR. COLLINS had <hi>ſkill to complain.</hi> Of that
mournful melody and thoſe tender images
which are the diſtinguiſhing excellencies of ſuch pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
as bewail departed friendſhip, or beanty, he was
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:1196200700:130"/>
an almoſt unequalled maſter. He knew perfectly to
exhibite ſuch circumſtances, peculiar to the objects,
as awaken the influences of pity; and while, from his
own great ſenſibility, he felt what he wrote, he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
addreſſed himſelf to the feelings of others.</p>
            <p>To read ſuch lines as the following, all beautiful
and tender as they are, without correſponding emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of pity, is ſurely impoſſible:
<q>The tender thought on thee ſhall dwell.</q>
               <q>
                  <l>Each lonely ſcene ſhall thee reſtore,</l>

                  <l>And mourn'd, 'till Pity's ſelf be dead.</l>
               </q>
The ode on the death of Thomſon ſeems to have been
written in an excurſion to Richmond by water. The
rural ſcenery has a proper effect in an ode to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of a poet, much of whoſe merit lay in deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the ſame kind, and the appellations of
"Druid" and "meek nature's child" are happily
characteriſtic. For the better underſtanding of this
ode, it is neceſſary to remember that Mr. Thomſon
lies buried in the church of Richmond.</p>
