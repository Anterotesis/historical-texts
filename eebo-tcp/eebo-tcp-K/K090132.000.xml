            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>INCE I preſent this Book to the World in general, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dedicating it to any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to protect me, it may be neceſſary to ſay ſomething in my own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
            <p>What I write is from Remarks on Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Practical Obſervations, with an Intention to improve the Method of cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſeaſes; for the Art of healing is in a declining Way, the Practice of Phyſick, is become a Perfect Ceremony; that ſtrong Beam, which ought to ſupport it, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into different Branches: Here is one Man ſhall be a Phyſician, another a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, one an Apothecary, another a Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus (in this preſent Age) each
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0010402200:3"/>Man ſticks to his particular Branch, and thinks it Scandal to meddle or interfere, with any more than one Part only; but in former Ages, a Man was not deem'd worthy to be call'd a Phyſician, unleſs he was Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of every one of theſe following Arts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(Firſt.)</hi> Phyſiology, or a Knowledge of Human Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(Secondly.)</hi> Anatomy, or a Knowledge of the Parts of Human Bodies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(Thirdly.)</hi> Pharmacy and Chymiſtry, or the Method of making all manner of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines.</p>
            <p>Indeed, the Firſt and Principal Point is, judging and diſtinguiſhing the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, and Cauſes of Diſeaſes ; but it is impoſſible for a Phyſician to be perfect in this Point, until he is perfect in Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy and Surgery: For I call Surgery the Practical Part of Anatomy; there being more Experience gain'd from Accidental Practice and Obſervations upon living Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, than from Lectures and Courſes of Anatomy over dead Bodies.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe it is as neceſſary for a Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, to know the different Qualities of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0010402200:4"/>that he may be able to relieve the different Diſorders which Human Bodies are afflicted with: Therefore, every Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner ought to know the preparing of all Kind of Medicines, for both Internal and External Uſes; becauſe the Maker of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, or Things of any Kind, is moſt able to know the Power of ſuch Things as he himſelf hath made.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paracelſus</hi> call'd Phyſick a Short Art, meaning, that when it is Short and Eaſy it is moſt Perfect: For where the Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice is long and tedious, the Patient ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers; and when Writings are long and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, the Reader's Mind is no Ways im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd thereby: but Books are too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly eſteem'd according to the Fame of the Author, and when any Thing new is publiſh'd, the firſt Enquiry is, who is the Author? Inſtead of, what has he wrote?</p>
            <p>Although I ſay ſomething in Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the preſent Rules in Phyſick, I do not riſe up againſt the Phyſicians in general; for I know ſome Excellent Men in Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, whoſe Methods I always obſerv'd to improve my own Thoughts, ſo far I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0010402200:5"/>therefore I will ſay nothing that ſhall offend the Wiſe and Worthy; but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Ignorance and Envy there can be no Defence, ſince People will always have dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Taſtes; ſome Perſons like a Surgeon for being diligent in dreſſing a Green Wound, twice a Day, when certainly, the oftner a Green Wound is open'd, the longer it muſt be before it heals, becauſe the Air makes a Wound more tender, and hinders the Fibres from uniting. Others like a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, under whoſe Care they are always ſick.</p>
            <p>And ſome People like to read Books, which confound their Underſtanding; I might name a certain Author, in great Eſteem, who at his Beginning, takes up five Pages in explaining the Word Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe; now I will explain the meaning of the Word, Diſeaſe, in a few Lines.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe I find a Perſon uneaſy, I may then ſay he has a Diſ-eaſe, becauſe he is not at Eaſe; and ſo may we ſay of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and Diſ-temper. Thus I would make the Path of Practice, Plain and Eaſy, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I will begin firſt with the Nerves and Senſes, by way of Introduction.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="introduction">

            <head>THE INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> HAVE obſerv'd that ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Authors who have wrote upon the Animal Spirits, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out explaining themſelves, have been ridicul'd and condemn'd, for picking out an Abſtruſe Term, to build an Argument upon; and as my Thoughts may lead me to make uſe of that Term, I will tell the Reader what I mean thereby; in Hopes it may in ſome Meaſure defend me from Calumny, or at leaſt vindicate other Authors: For certainly every Man has an Idea of what he writes; indeed he may not meaſure it out to the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of every Reader.</p>
            <p>Therefore, when I ſay the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, I mean the Principal Seat of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, where the Prime Senſe gives imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Judgment between Pain and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0010402200:7"/>and theſe following Gates, lead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, as, Seeing, Hearing, Taſting, Smelling, and Feeling.</p>
            <p>Yet the Mind, or Animal Spirits, can conceive either Fear, Grief, or Joy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out drawing it in by any of thoſe Organs; but when one Perſon infects another, with either Fear, Joy, or Pain, it muſt then be carried to the Prime Seat of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, by ſome one of the five Senſes: And when any Hurt or Surprize, Infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Fear, or Malignity of any Kind, reaches the Animal Spirits, or the Prime Seat of Senſe, from thence is ſhewn an Antipathy in all the Nerves, by a rigorous ſhivering and ſhaking of every Muſcle, throughout the whole Body; and it is then (as in Holy Writ) that the Keepers of the Houſe ſhall tremble, Fears being in the Way.</p>
            <p>Now I muſt own, the <hi>Liquidum Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorum,</hi> (or rather the Nerves themſelves) may properly be call'd the Animal Spirits.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>
                  <hi>But nearer to the Fountain Head,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>More Cryſtal flows the Silver Stream.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0010402200:8"/>
            <p>For certainly the Nerves are govern'd by the Mind, and Force or Quickneſs of Thought, as is plainly demonſtrated, when we catch a flying Ball, or when we defend our Heads from a Blow, our Arm is then mov'd by the Nerves guiding the Muſcles, yet the Nerves are directed by the Mind; for although the Performances and OEco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy of the Nerves, are noble, they are not deſign'd (by Nature) to contract, or extend a Muſcle, without Order from the Mind, or Prime Seat of Senſe.</p>
            <p>Moreover when it happens (contrary to Nature) that any of the Nerves contract a Muſcle, without Commiſſion from the Mind, that Muſcle ſo mov'd, is then cramp'd, or in Convulſion.</p>
            <p>Therefore as the Mind commands the Nerves, the Mind or Thought, muſt be the Animal Spirit; likewiſe the Mind muſt be the Throne of the Soul.</p>
            <p>Thus in purſuit of Nature, as one hard Cauſe we overtake, ſtill harder ſtand before us; ſo from Cauſe to Cauſe, our Thoughts are led, even to that mighty Power, the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0010402200:9"/>Sun, by whoſe Beams we live, move, and generate.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>
                  <hi>Without that Warmth, and lively Light,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>So mortal Cold this Globe would be,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>That Nature muſt in Darkneſs fix,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>And every Thing that's living dye.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <p>For the Sun is Nature's Lord, the firſt Power from God, and the only Cauſe of the Courſe and Changes of Things on this Earth.</p>
            <p>The Moon has no Influence over Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Bodies, nor over any Thing on this Globe: Indeed, the Tide keeps Time with the Moon; but it is becauſe the Moon and the Earth both, have the ſame Circular Motion to the Sun.</p>
            <p>I would demonſtrate how the Tide, is caus'd, by the Atmoſphere preſſing againſt the Sea, as the Earth moves; and how the Wind, and Combuſtions of Weather, are caus'd by a Fermentation in the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere; but it would be tedious here, and keep me from what I propoſe, which is chiefly to treat on Diſtempers, and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature.</p>

               <head>Of Malignant Fevers.</head>
               <p>FEVERS commonly call'd Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant, being in their Nature moſt ſubtle and ſevere, which prey upon the Animal Spirits, ſome Time before the Blood is infected.</p>
               <p>This Kind of Fever does not proceed from contagious Particles in the Air; nor is it infectious any otherwiſe, than by our being afraid of it, and thus it gets Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion into the Prime Fancy or Animal Spirits, by conceiving a Fear of Death within ourſelves, upon any ſlight Illneſs, or ſudden Surprize of Danger; and the moſt dangerous Symptom is, when the Thoughts have drawn in an Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Dread of Death, upon the Spirits; for without this Dread, it is not a real Malignant Fever.</p>
               <p>The Sick is ſeiz'd at firſt, with a Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering and Coldneſs, a weary Pain and Weakneſs, throughout the whole Body, proceeding from that Diſorder upon the Nerves and Spinal Marrow, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0010402200:11"/>the Sinews and Muſcles incapable of doing their Offices; likewiſe a continual reaching to vomit, and a Watchfulneſs upon the Spirits, which hinders him from ſleeping, although he's attended with a great Drowſineſs, theſe are the Symptoms of a Malignant Fever, at the firſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, before the Blood is inflam'd. The Patient ſhould then by all means ſubmit himſelf to his Bed, and not ſtrive againſt Nature; for ſhe will not be conquer'd.</p>
               <p>Now a Phyſician being call'd, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes according to his Judgment, for Phyſicians differ in their Methods of Practice, as they do in their Opinions, and full as much as Human Bodies differ in their Conſtitutions; ſome will boldly give purging Medicines, others give Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doriſicks, and ſome Bliſter more and more, even to the laſt Gaſp.</p>
               <p>I do not pretend to be a Pilot; I only wiſh the Wanderer may know, which Path will miſlead him; as for Bliſtering, I cannot ſee why it ſhould do any Hurt, yet I may reaſonably make an Objection, ſince Practice has convinc'd me, that Bli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0010402200:12"/>afford no Relief in real Malignant Fevers. Purging is an Ignorant Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and dangerous; for all ſudden Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations, or immoderate Diſcharges, add to the Rigour and Anxiety of the Mind, therefore muſt tend to deſtroy Life, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than ſave. Sudorificks are very proper, if we uſe ſuch as may bring on gentle Sweats; for if the Sweats come on exceſſively, Nature will be reduced ſo low, as to be paſt defending herſelf, ſo Critical are theſe Malignant Fevers; and likewiſe if we find a Difficulty in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Patient to ſweat, we muſt forbear heating Medicines, otherwiſe we ſhall put the Blood into a violent Ebullition, and hurry the Patient out of the World, when perhaps, if he had been ſupply'd with a proper Regimen, yielding to Nature, he might have recover'd, by the Help of gentle Cardiack, and Diluting Medicines. The <hi>Lapis Contrayerva,</hi> and Teſtace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Powders repeated often, and given in a Julep of Black-Cherry Water, Syrup of Saffron and Compound Piony Water, will help to correct the Acidity in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0010402200:13"/>and cheriſh the Animal Spirits; for if we can find out how, and where Nature is oppreſs'd, we then muſt uſe Means to ſet her Free, that ſhe may (on her own Accord) bring on ſuch Sweats, as are not only neceſſary and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but highly preferable to all that can be forc'd by Art.</p>
               <p>The only Sudorifick Medicine that I ever found effectual in Malignant and Peſtilential Fevers, is the Elixir of Vipers, as I have ſet down in the Chapter of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory Fevers; in it, there is a ſubtle Virtue, which never fails to bring on the Moderate and Neceſſary Sweats, and as if it were a Specifick, temperates the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits, without augmenting the Heat in the Blood: But it is impoſſible to ſet a Rule to practiſe by, in either Acute or Chronical Diſeaſes; nor even how to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a proper Regimen, or a fit Liquor for the Patient in a Malignant Fever; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the Phyſician may order Chicken Broth, which certainly is very proper, if the Patient can drink as much as his Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver requires; but after he has drank one
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0010402200:14"/>Sort of Liquor five of ſix Times, he bears ſo great an Antipathy to it, that his Stomach will not take the ſame Liquor any longer, yet he is confin'd to it for ſeveral Days; this Way of reſtraining the Patient to one Sort of Liquor, is barbarous, if rightly conſider'd; for we ſhould endeavour to find out which Sort of Liquor he likes, and divert him with Variety of Liquors; firſt one Sort, and then another. By this Means, he will drink as much as is Neceſſary: Proper Liquors in Fevers are Broths, Sage-Tea, Sack-Whey, Pectoral Drinks, White Drink, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, if the Patient ſhould have a Longing, or Deſire for a Draught of Small Beer, we ſhould by all means let him have it, with a Piece of Bread put into it burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hot: This ſometimes is of ſingular Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, by affording a Satisfaction to the Mind; for every Thing that is grateful to a Perſon in a Fever, gives a Courage and better enables him to endure his Afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>It may be of ſome Weight, to ſet down the Qualifications of a Good Nurſe, one who is chearful, obedient, and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0010402200:15"/>not one that reads, ſighs, and whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in the Room, as if ſhe was talking to a Spirit: but this I mention by the bye, becauſe the Patient never ſleeps in a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Fever, being ſo very watchful he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſlumbers, and when he hears any Whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering, he is affrighted, and commonly ſtarts up to liſten; ſo it infects his Thoughts with freſh Dreads, and thus it hurts him, becauſe the Malignity of this Fever is Rigour and Fears upon the Mind or Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits; therefore I adviſe the Nurſe to ſpeak out briskly, or be quite ſilent, likewiſe to move briskly, or ſit quite ſtill.</p>
               <p>But, as I was ſaying before, how unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably Proper Remedies may be apply'd, as in this Fever, Bleeding may be of great Service, when the Blood comes to too High a Fermentation, but if on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary we ſhould bleed at the firſt Approach of the Diſeaſe, we ſhall thereby conceal the Fever upon the Spirits, and depreſs Nature, inſomuch that the Patient dyes in a Languid Manner.</p>
               <p>Nor do I digreſs by bringing in compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, how improper it would be, to give
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0010402200:16"/>the Jeſuit's Bark in the Cold ſhivering Fit of an Intermittent Fever. I might note ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Proofs, while I am treating of Malignant Fevers, ſince the Word Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lign alludes to all that is unfavourable, ſevere, and dangerous; yet I will explain the Nature of Peſtilential, and Inflammato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Fevers, the Small Pox, and other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, ſingularly and faithfully, as far as I have obſerv'd, by looking from one Cauſe into another.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <head>Of Peſtilential Fevers.</head>
               <p>PEſtilential Fevers are in no wiſe more dangerous, than the Fever deſcrib'd in the foregoing Chapter, although the Name may ſound more terrible. Indeed Peſtilential Fevers are very fatal in one Reſpect, by running through whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies and Towns, for ſeveral Miles, as if the Air was loaded with Contagious Particles.</p>
               <p>I believe, the wiſeſt Men that ever wrote were always loſt by looking into
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0010402200:17"/>the Cauſes and Nature of Infection; and as ſeveral Authors have attempted it, I will venture to give my Opinion, in Hopes it may, in ſome Meaſure, conduct thoſe Men into right Notions, that are capable of judging mine to be wrong.</p>
               <p>Then in my way of Thinking, Infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on moſt commonly is drawn into Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Bodies, by the Power of Sympathy and Antipathy, working upon the Nerves or the Mind: As for Example; when one Perſon complains to another, that he feels an unwholeſome Rawneſs in the Air; the other whom he complains to, will be apt to draw the ſame Notion into his own Mind; likewiſe when one in Company gapes or yawns for Sleep, others in the ſame Company, who bear the leaſt Sympathy to Drowſineſs, will be ſoon ſeiz'd with the like gaping or yawning; beſides, it is worth obſerving, how a Dampneſs in a Room juſt waſh'd, or Damp Linen hanging in a Room, will infect thoſe who bear an Antipathy thereto, yet it very ſeldom hurts thoſe who are in no wiſe afraid of ſuch like Dampneſſes; and alſo, as the Sweet
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0010402200:18"/>Notes, and Swells in Muſick, only ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates ſuch Souls as feel its Charms, ſo any Particulr Impureneſs in the Air, can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infect ſuch Bodies as are fit to receive that Kind of Impureneſs; and thus it comes to paſs, that the Small Pox cannot infect thoſe who have had the Small Pox before, becauſe their Bodies are not capable of receiving that kind of Infection; and moſt certainly every one's Body is not at all Times in a Diſpoſition for admitting in a Peſtilential Contagion; and as Nature hath order'd that ſuch Fevers as begin with great Violence, by the ſame Rule, ſhall the ſooner come to a Criſis.</p>
               <p>A Peſtilential Fever is attended with various Symptoms from the Beginning, through the whole Courſe; but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly at its firſt coming, it ſeizes with great violence the Head, Stomach, and Lungs; the Blood ſoon takes the Flame in this Fever, and the Heat being then in the greateſt Degree, Nature begins to ſtrive to force out the Enemy, either by Carbuncles, Biles, Eruptions in the Skin, or Exceſſive Sweats, and ſometimes a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0010402200:19"/>Looſeneſs, which is the worſt of all the foregoing Symptoms, and I can ſcarce believe that Nature brings on a Looſeneſs of her own Accord; I rather think it is caus'd by forcing the Sick to take ſome Medicines, or perſwading him to eat ſome Victuals his weak Stomach cannot bear. The Patient finds Relief from all the other Symptoms, for as the Blood receives the Fever, the Animal Spirits are in ſome Meaſure reliev'd; therefore the Phyſician muſt always endeavour to promote the foregoing Symptoms: Since it is certain, unleſs ſome of 'em concur, the Patient muſt die in a few Hours, by the Animal Spirits being overſet with the Violence of the Fever.</p>
               <p>There commonly is a continual Keck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in drawing in the Breath, which is a ſtrong Proof that raw and unwholeſome Air, has made an Impreſſion upon the Lungs. By this Diſorder, in drawing in the Breath, the Stomach becomes very weak and unfit to receive many Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines; therefore as Alexipharmacks are
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0010402200:20"/>moſt proper, we muſt be very careful not to give ſuch as are too loading.</p>
               <p>Peſtilential Fevers require a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of diluting Liquors, for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we muſt endeavour, as much as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to relieve the Diſorder in the Stomach and Lungs, that he may be able to drink as much as is neceſſary.</p>
               <p>Bliſters are of great Service in Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential Fevers, for relieving both the Head and Lungs; and to correct the Stomach, let the Patient take the following Draught every four Hours.—Take Salt of Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, a Scruple; Juice of Lemons, half an Ounce; mix'd together in a large Cup, and ſtir it till it has done fermenting; then put to it an Ounce of Barley Cinnamon Water. As this Draught muſt be repeated, it will be convenient to mix up ſix times the Quantity at once, and divide it.</p>
               <p>If the Fever, or the Heat in the Blood, ſhould be very violent, it will be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to keep the Body open by Glyſters, or gentle Lenitives, ſuch as Manna, or a Decoction made of Tamerinds and Senna, of each two Drams, and Salt of Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0010402200:21"/>ten Grains, boil'd in two Ounces of Water; as ſoon as it boils, take if from the Fire, and ſtrain it off, before it is quite cold. This is an excellent Cathar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, yet, if miſapply'd, it is liable to do Miſchief.</p>
               <p>I have been told of Bleeding to the Quantity of an hundred Ounces at once, but they muſt know very little of Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my that believe it; yet I confeſs, in my Opinion, when we bleed in Peſtilential Fevers we ought to take a large Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, in order to aſſwage the Heat, or Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of the Fever: for by taking the common Quantity, which is about ten Ounces, we only depreſs the natural Courſe of the Diſtemper, and prolong the Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances the Patient lyes under.</p>
               <p>The Teſtaceous Powders are hurtful in this Fever, by reaſon that the Stomach abounds with Phlegm, and Oily Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines are improper for no other reaſon, than the Stomach being weak, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear 'em.</p>
               <p>Thus the Symptoms of every Diſeaſe, muſt always indicate what Remedies, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0010402200:22"/>when they ought to be applied; only let this be a ſtanding Rule, what Medicines ſoever are fit to be given in Peſtilential Fevers, ought to be made up in little Quantities, and repeated often.</p>
               <p>I ſhould be glad to find out better Rules, but ſo critical and various are the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms in Fevers, that he may be deem'd an exceeding good Practitioner that does no hurt in them.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <head>Of Inflammatory Fevers.</head>
               <p>FEVERS under this Denomination, affect the Body by a Flux of inflam'd Blood, falling on particular Parts, caus'd frequently by drinking cold Liquors, or ſome ſudden Coldneſs in the Air, at a time when the Body is overheated; ſo this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory Fever comes in either a Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſy, a Quinzy, or a <hi>St. Anthony's</hi> Fire.</p>
               <p>Theſe Fevers are not without Danger, although the Animal Spirits be not infeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Dread and Malignity, yet Nature
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0010402200:23"/>may be overſet by the violent Heat in the Blood.</p>
               <p>In theſe kind of Fevers it is neceſſary to keep the Body open, by cooling Gly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and diluting Purgatives; for Relief is given by all moderate Evacuations, bleeding in particular: Sweating is of great ſervice, only Sudorificks are ſo very apt to inflame the Blood; but our Method of Practice is ſo common in thoſe Caſes, that I need not mention bleeding, bliſtering, and other Applications. My Deſign is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſet down ſuch things as have not been explain'd hitherto, and ſuch things as may be uſeful hereafter, for which reaſon I will ſet down a Fomentation for the Part affected in a <hi>St. Anthony's</hi> Fire, which I have experienc'd, and know to be valuable.</p>
               <p>Take a Pint of Lime-Water, make it boiling hot, put to it a Pint of rectify'd Spirit of Wine, it will be of a right Heat, and muſt be appli'd thus; wrap a Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen Cloth (not Woollen) round, or upon the Inflammation, ſo that the Cloth may be four or five in thickneſs, then pour this
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0010402200:24"/>Mixture through the Cloth: upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd Part; this repeated three times a Day, without taking off the Cloth, is much preferable to camphorated Spirit of Wine, Poultices, or any kind of Hot Fomentation; yet we muſt uſe inward Means, at the ſame Time, to cool the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and temper the Fermentation in the Blood.</p>
               <p>But it happens ſometimes, that theſe Fevers are attended with all the ill Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of a Malignant Fever, which is very fatal to the Patient, and renders the Cure more difficult to the Phyſician; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Blood being ſizy, indicates both bleeding, bliſtering, and other Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions, yet the Rigour upon the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits, contradicts that way of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, becauſe both bleeding and bliſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing depreſs Nature, and irritate the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits, and is apt to bring on greater Rigour and Dread. Therefore in a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Pleuriſy, I will recommend an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of Stone-Horſe Dung, made thus: Take ſix Globules of the Horſe Dung, and pour upon it a Quart of the Pectoral De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0010402200:25"/>boiling Hot; let it ſtand to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe in an Earthen Veſſel, cloſe cover'd, about an Hour, then ſtrain it off: This In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion both temperates and comforts the Animal Spirits, and commonly keeps the Patient in a gentle Sweat; for gentle Sweats tend to a Recovery, but by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Sweats, Nature is overſet, and the Phyſician often deceiv'd by the Patient dying at a time, when he thought him paſt all Danger. The foregoing Infuſion is to be drank frequently, very Hot, about a Quarter of a Pint at a time.</p>
               <p>Let the Patient take about thirty Drops of the Elixir of Vipers, in a Cup of the aforeſaid Infuſion, twice a Day; it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to keep his Body open by Glyſters, but not to purge upon any Account, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til all the Symptoms of Malignity are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd.</p>
               <p>If the Patient's Stomach will bear to take a Bolus, make him up two Scruples of <hi>Edenborough</hi> Treacle, and ſix Grains of Salt of Amber; this muſt be given eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſix Hours, with a Draught of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Infuſion, or any other diluting Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0010402200:26"/>quor after it, for we muſt not confine him to the Infuſion of Horſe Dung, though it is wonderful in this Caſe; we muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert him with a Change, when he's tir'd of any one ſort of Liquor.</p>
               <p>As I have mentioned the Elixir of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, I will ſet it down before I go any farther, that I may not be accus'd of Quackery, or deſigning this Book an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement for my own Intereſt.</p>
               <p>Take the Skins of Vipers, dry'd and powder'd, Millepedes dry'd, Contrayer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va Roots in Powder, of each an Ounce, mix theſe Ingredients into a Paſt in a Glaſs Mortar, with two Ounces of Spirit of Salt, tye the Mortar cloſe over with a Bladder, let it ſtand for five or ſix Days, then put it into a Florence Flask, with four Ounces of Spirit of <hi>Nitre Dulcis,</hi> let it ſtand to digeſt in the Sun, or a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Sand Heat, ten or twelve Days, then preſs it out, and filter it, it muſt be kept in a Bottle with a Glaſs Stopper, for it will corrode, and eat a common Cork. This Medicine opens all Obſtructions in the Body, and wonderfully revives, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0010402200:27"/>cheriſhes the Mind, or Animal Spirits; alſo cauſes Perſpiration, and quickens Vital Motion.</p>
               <p>Yet every Profeſſor of Phyſick, knows not when, and how to apply a good Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, no more than every Man in Jack Boots, is fit to mount the manag'd Horſe.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <head>Of Intermittent Fevers.</head>
               <p>THESE Fevers vary both according to the Difference in Conſtitutions, and Degrees of Malignity, therefore liable to be a Quotidian, a Tertian, or a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan: The moſt favourable ſort is, when it comes every Day; the next in Degree, is when it intermits one Day; and the worſt ſort of all, is when the Patient is well two Days together, and the third Day has his Fever.</p>
               <p>There is yet another Sort, which is commonly call'd a double Tertian: In this the Patient is ill two Days together, and well the third; this is thought the worſt Species of all Intermittents; but whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0010402200:28"/>examins ſtrictly, will find it only a Quartan Ague, wherein Nature is by ſome Means obſtructed, ſo that ſhe cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the Malignity by Sweats the firſt Day; ſo the Fever remains two Days together. I have obſerv'd the Patient to ſweat the firſt Day, but not a Diſcharge ſufficient for a Quartan Ague, which is not a jot inferiour to either a Malignant, or a Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential Fever, for the Time it holds him in the ſhivering Fit; beſides I have obſerv'd the Sweats have not ſmelt ſour and fetid, until the ſecond Day; therefore it ought to be call'd an irregular, or a depreſs'd Quartan.</p>
               <p>It may be thought miraculous, that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termittent Fevers ſhould go off, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn ſo regularly at ſtated Periods, when one might reaſonably have ſuppos'd the Patient to have been quite freed from the Diſtemper by the Sweats, at the Termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the laſt Fit.</p>
               <p>Now I am of opinion, that the Body draws in the infectious Particles, from the ſourneſs of the Sweats, back again; as ſoon as Nature has thruſt out ſuch Sweats;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0010402200:29"/>ſo as I judge it in this Fever, the Body is capable of admitting in ſuch Infection, as Nature at that time diſcharges through the Pores; ſo it returns again in as many Hours as it requires to reach the Animal Spirits, to cauſe a freſh Diſturbance; and then the Nerves again ſhow the Rigour and Antipathy, by ſhaking every Fibre and Muſcle in the Body.</p>
               <p>But let this be how it will, Intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Fevers are ſo familiar to us, that the Cure is become very eaſy; the only Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty is, when the Bark purges, which is commonly prevented by Opiates; yet the Stomach is manag'd much better with Preparations of Sulphur; for Opiates by thickening the Blood, and cauſing a ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Internal Motion, bring on very often the Rheumatiſm, a Dropſy, or ſome other Evil much harder to be cur'd, than the Intermittent Fever.</p>

               <head>Of the Small-Pox.</head>
               <p>WHenever the Small-Pox breaks out in any Part, it commonly takes a run through the whole Place, whether Town or City, and frequently ſeveral Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages near each other, for twelve Miles round.</p>
               <p>The Confluent Sort is not a Degree milder than a Peſtilential Fever, and is full as contagious among choſe who have not had the Small-Pox before; neither is the Infection limited to the Small-Pox only; for frequently when the Fever comes to a Criſis, and the Puſtules begin to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, the purulent Matter then diffuſes out an offenſive Smell, which will even infect thoſe who have had the Small-Pox before; but as their Bodies are not liable to the Small-Pox, the Infection will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get a Fever full as bad, if not worſe; and notwithſtanding one's Body being incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of admitting the very ſame ſort of Fever, yet the Infection may produce a Fever of ſome other kind; ſo great is the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0010402200:31"/>Affinity in Malignant and Peſtilential Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers one towards another.</p>
               <p>I can give one Inſtance of myſelf in particular, by lying in the ſame Bed with a Man who had a Quartan Ague; his Sweats were very ſour and fetid, to which Smell I bore ſo great an Antipathy, that it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected me, and had, as I thought, receiv'd an Intermittent Fever, until the Small-Pox came out to convince me to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. I remember a Child in the ſame Houſe had the Small-Pox, about ten Days after me; and this Diſtemper went no farther; ſo that it is plain the Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Air was not fit at that time for an Infection of the Small-Pox, no more than my Body was in a Conſtitution to receive in an Intermittent Fever.</p>
               <p>As I have compar'd the Small-Pox to Peſtilential Fevers, we ſhould regard eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Symptom in the ſame manner; for both bleeding and bliſtering ought to be us'd, when Nature is in danger of being overſet, by the violent kecking in drawing the Breath; or likewiſe the Pain in the Head, and Neck, or other Symptoms be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0010402200:32"/>too violent for Nature to find out her true Courſe for Freedom.</p>
               <p>We ought never to force any thing upon the Patient that he has any diſlike to, tho 'tis too common for the Nurſe to urge the Patient to drink beyond his Thirſt, either Tare Drink, or ſome particular Liquor which ſhe has an opinion of; which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently brings on a vomiting, and a Looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, not by its Quality, but by the Quantity he drinks: For although a Liquid be aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, if the Sick drink more than Nature can bear, it muſt purge it ſelf off.</p>
               <p>The Patient (as I ſaid before in Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential Fevers) muſt be diverted with ſuch diluting Liquors, as beſt ſuits his Deſire, in order to cheriſh Nature, that ſhe may be able to do her Part; yet we have Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of relieving ſeveral bad Symptoms in the Small-Pox; but to ſet down what to apply when ſuch a Symptom appears, and ſuch a Medicine in ſuch a kind of Diſorder, a Man might write all his Life time, and his Work would be imperfect at laſt, and ſerve only to delude, rather than inſtruct; therefore an Eye of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0010402200:33"/>looking on the Patient in this and all other Diſeaſes, will conduct Medicines more effectual, than any Rule ſet forth by the greateſt Author in the World.</p>
               <p>Before I conclude upon this Subject, I ought to conſider how it comes to paſs that the Small-Pox are favourable to young Children, when their Bodies are more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to receive any kind of Hurt or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection from the Air by that Tenderneſs in them; yet we muſt allow that they are not ſo much ſubject to either Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy or Antipathy, neither have they any Dread or Apprehenſion of Death, until the Nurſes begin to infect their tender Thoughts with Tales of frightful Ghoſts; ſo that the Small-Pox is more favourable, if the Thoughts keep free from Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Dread; this is the beſt Reaſon I can give at preſent, but if Time and Practice introduce me hereafter to a better Knowledge in this, or any other Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, I ſhall be glad to publiſh it, ſince my Deſire is to improve the Art of heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as far as Providence has given me a Commiſſion.</p>

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0010402200:35"/>in ſome meaſure ſuppreſs'd, and ting'd of a reddiſh Colour; and as one Evil begets another, ſo this Grief in the Kidneys and Urinary Veſſels, cauſes that violent Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which always enſues and commonly laſts about eight or ten Hours before it begins to abate then the Raſh comes out; and for want of a free courſe of Urine, there commonly comes on a Looſeneſs at the ſame time, ſo the Patient begins to find ſome Eaſe by intervals. Now the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms go off by Degrees; only the Cough which began at firſt, continues, and may prove of ill Conſequence, if not remov'd in time by proper means; ſuch as Emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions made with <hi>Sperma Ceti,</hi> to be drank frequently, and a Mucilage made of Quince Seeds, with ſome Nutmeg grated into it, and a little Sugar to make it agreeable, to be taken by a ſpoonful at a time, as often as the Cough is troubleſome.</p>
               <p>Let him take a Paper of Powder made of prepar'd Coral and <hi>Lac Sulphur,</hi> of each fifteen Grains, twice a Day in a quarter of a Pint of new Milk; theſe Medicines will anſwer the End if continued for ten
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0010402200:36"/>or fifteen Days, being made and apply'd as they ought, I mean by having a due regard to the Conſtitution of the Patient and the Symptoms of the Diſorders; he may eat at the ſame time Broths, and any nouriſhing Meats in Moderation, ſuch as his Fancy prompts him to; he may drink for his common Drink, Barley Water, and ſometimes a Draught of Small Beer, if it is not too ſtale; for the Pectoral Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are of no ſervice in this Cough, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are the common Linctus's, made of Oils and Pectoral Syrups.</p>
               <p>All heating Medicines are hurtful, from the beginning quite thro' the whole Courſe of the Diſeaſe; and the vain pretence of ſtriking the Diſtemper out from the Heart, is without any Grounds of Reaſon or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
               <p>The Patient muſt forbear all Spirituous Liquors, and Cordial Medicines, unleſs we find the Spirits very much reduc'd by Sweats and other Evacuations; and even then we ſhould be very careful how we attempt to elevate, ſince moſt Medicines under the Denomination of Cordials, are
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0010402200:37"/>liable to encourage the Fever to run beyond its natural Meaſure; and it is by this means that a Hectick Fever, and a Conſumptive Cough, ſo often follows the Meaſles and Fever of this Kind.</p>
               <p>A Scarlet Fever is of the very ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and muſt be treated in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>As the Raſh and Meaſles are ſo apt to affect the Lungs, I will ſet forth the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Hectick Fever, Coughs, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions in the following Chapter; keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cloſe to Truth, which is the principal Virtue, and ought to be the Care of every Author in Phyſick.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <head>Of Conſumptions.</head>
               <p>COnſumptions which befal Young People, are always introduc'd by a Hectick Fever, wherein the Blood is too thin and ſpirituous, and partly of a Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butick Quality.</p>
               <p>If we duly conſider that the Lungs are ſupply'd with Moiſture no other way than
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0010402200:38"/>by what perſpires out of the Diaphragma, and Pleura; it is not ſo wonderful that a ſharpneſs in the Blood ſhould afflict the Lungs with that continual hecking and tickling Cough: ſince it is plain that the Moiſture within the Thorax muſt conſiſt of the Serum, and the moſt thin Particles from the Blood; for both the Diaphrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma and Pleura abound with Minute San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiferous Veſſels; and as a Conſumptive Cough is introduc'd by this Heat, or ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Blood, ſo this Hectick Fever is caus'd by Victuals of too high Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Liquors too Rich and Strong for Perſons whoſe Blood is apt to be too ſpirituous, being in their Youth and Vigour.</p>
               <p>Some People, for want of a true Idea, will be apt to diſpute this being the only Cauſe of a Hectick Fever; yet I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is; though it ſo often comes at the Concluſion of other Fevers; it is not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to ſucceed any of 'em; but caus'd by the ill Meaſures aforeſaid; neither is it difficult to cure, if the Patient can be regulated into a proper Regimen, ſuch as Panada, Mutton-Broth, made without
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0010402200:39"/>Turnips; Rice in any form, Jelleys, Flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mery, Raw Milk, warm from the Cow, and all Things that are cooling and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>He muſts abſtain from Salt Meats, Rich Soops, and all Victuals of high Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; neither muſt he drink Wines, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous Drams, nor any kind of Cordials.</p>
               <p>When the Patient will ſet a Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to diet himſelf in the foregoing Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, we may promiſe a Cure by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Method.</p>
               <p>Firſt take away nine or ten Ounces of Blood; then let the Patient drink plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully of Emulſions made of the Cold Seeds, with ten Drops of the Balm of <hi>Gilead</hi> to every Quart; and let him take as often as the Cough troubles him, a ſpoonful of a Mucilage made of Quince Kernels, with ſome Nutmeg grated into it, and a little Sugar to make it agreeable, and no more, (for Sugar is apt to cauſe too quick a Fermentation in the Stomach.) Pearl Juleps are of ſingular uſe, being cooling and grateful; he may drink com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Whey ſometimes for a Change, it is
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0010402200:40"/>very proper, having in it an Emollient Quality; he may take a gentle Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Senna, and Rhubarb, to open his Body as often as there is occaſion; for it is neceſſary to keep him rather Laxative, than Coſtive.</p>
               <p>The Patient muſt uſe no violent Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, nor give a Looſe to Paſſions of the Mind; for all raſh Motions or Thoughts of Revenge, and all ſudden Surprizes, or Thoughts of Pleaſure, will cauſe remiſſive Bluſhes in the Countenance, and ſudden ſharp Sweats, which remit and return, as often as thoſe Paſſions affect him.</p>
               <p>This is the true Nature of this kind of Conſumption, which is (by the Vulgar) commonly called the galloping Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and indeed a very proper Name, if we conſider that in this Diſtemper, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is too much elevated, and running her Courſe unrein'd, falls flat before ſhe makes out half her Length.</p>

               <head>Of the Phthiſic, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>NOW it is to be noted, that Old People's Blood may be made too rich; yet not ſo apt to be ſpirituous and ſharp, but rather heavy and clammy, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it produces in them the Phthiſic, Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, or ſome ſuch kind of Diſorder; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Lungs are overloaded with a tough Mucus, or Flegm.</p>
               <p>In this Caſe all ſpirituous Liquors (drank in Moderation) are proper, and every thing that may quicken the Fermentation in the Stomach; for this is a ſlackneſs of Motion, as the former is a quickneſs; therefore riding, and all Brisk Exerciſes of the Body, are proper in this Caſe, as they are hurtful in the former; and as the other is from the Force of Eagerneſs and Raſhneſs in Youth, this the Effect of Heavineſs in Old Age; and although this ſort of Conſumption is not of ſo ſharp a Nature, yet it is much harder to cure; notwithſtanding the Patient may be very much reliev'd by expectorating Medicines;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0010402200:42"/>even when he gaſps for Breath, the Tubes in the Lungs being clog'd and contracted by the viſcid Mucus or Flegm.</p>
               <p>The beſt and moſt effectual Remedies are theſe following: A Linctus made of Oximel of Squills, Syrrup of Balſam and Linſeed Oil, of each equal Quantities; let the Patient take a Spoonful every Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but when it happens that his Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach will not bear this Linctus, make up inſtead of it, a Mixture of Gum Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniacum, two Drams, diſſolv'd in ſix Ounces of Penny-Royal-Water; he muſt take three Spoonfuls of this Mixture every Morning; if it ſhould purge him too much, let him take leſs in Quantity.</p>
               <p>An Ounce of Tincture of <hi>Hiera Picra,</hi> with thirty Drops of Liquid <hi>Laudanum,</hi> to be taken every fourth Night going to Bed; Malt Drink is hurtful, becauſe it is heavy and clogging, therefore I adviſe him to Punch made with Oranges, to drink moderately as his Spirits require it.</p>
               <p>By this Means the Patient may be made ſo eaſy, or at leaſt reliev'd ſo far, as he ſhall find very little inconveniency in it,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0010402200:43"/>yet he may be afflicted with this Sort of Conſumption (I mean the Phthiſic and Aſthma) above twenty Years; and even at laſt his Death may be imputed to Old Age.</p>
               <p>In this Place it may be obſerv'd, that what Man ſoever would prolong his Courſe with Nature, this muſt be his Rule, depreſs her gently, as there is Occaſion, in his youthful Years, and cheriſh her as he grows Old.</p>
               <p>I wiſh I could ſet forth the Ideas I have of Conſumptions in a fairer Light; yet it may be underſtood from what I have ſaid, that every wheeſing Cough is not a Conſumption, nor every hecking or tickling Cough the Phthiſic.</p>
               <p>Thus the Virtue of a Phyſician con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in judging exactly the Nature of the Diſtemper, and the Conſtitution of the Patient; and this was the Advantage that Doctor <hi>Radcliff</hi> had, in knowing his Maker, (I mean he judg'd Nature) better than other Men: So ſprang his unpara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel'd Succeſs.</p>

               <head>Of the Dropſy.</head>
               <p>SOME Phyſical Writers have erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neouſly drawn other Diſtempers to this Title, making three or four different Sorts of Dropſies.</p>
               <p>I beg their Pardon for ſaying that no Diſtemper is a Dropſy, but an Overſet of Water that preſſes againſt the Valves, and contracts the Paſſages which (by Nature) are deſign'd to receive or ſuck up that Water which is in the Abdomen, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to diſcharge it out of the Body.</p>
               <p>A Tympany cannot be call'd a Dropſy, becauſe it is Wind pent up without Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,, ſo it is call'd <hi>Tympanum,</hi> or a Drum.</p>
               <p>And what is call'd a Dropſy in the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia,</hi> is a Hurt by Coition, when the Textures or Animalculas of the Seed are broken or imperfect, which being receiv'd, embrac'd, and retain'd in the <hi>Orchis,</hi> draws to it the <hi>Mucus</hi> or nouriſhment, which attends and flows to the Parts of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in a natural and vital Conception.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0010402200:45"/>Now this Mucilaginous Matter concoct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by vital Warmth, becomes hard and tough; it increaſes in bigneſs, and grows every Day more hard to cure.</p>
               <p>When we meet with any one under this Misfortune, we muſt depreſs Nature by Rough Medicines, which are cold and revulſive, in order to give a ſudden Shock to the Parts of Generation; for all warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Medicines are hurtful in this Diſeaſe, becauſe the Warmth of Nature glutinates all ſlimy Matter to a Toughneſs, as a Coldneſs of Nature reduces it to a Soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or a Fluidity.</p>
               <p>Thus a Falſe Conception reſembles a Natural one; yet although this Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance between a Dropſy, a Tympany, and a Conception, may deceive the Eye, it ought not to deceive the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Therefore a real Dropſy is, when the <hi>Viſcera</hi> and all the Urinary Veſſels are ſtun'd and obſtructed, which the Patient feels by a Heavineſs and Numbneſs in the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> and all the lower Part of the Body; the Bowels are relax'd, and the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0010402200:46"/>Periſtaltick Motion very ſlow; by this Slowneſs of the Internal Motion, and Weakneſs in the Bowels and Urinary Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels; the Water in the Cavity of the Belly has no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> its Motion nor Freedom, to paſs out of the Body; ſo it cauſes firſt the Belly to ſwell, and the Legs ſoon after, by the Weight of this watery Humour preſſing downwards. And the ſhortneſs of Breath which always attends this Diſtemper, is caus'd by the Cavity of the Belly being ſo fill'd with Water, that it preſſes againſt the the Diaphragma or Midriff; thus it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts or ſtraitens the Cheſt or Thorax, which contains the Heart and Lights, ſo that this Preſſure that the Water makes againſt the Midriff, hinders the Cheſt from expanding, and the Lungs from dilating ſufficiently for Reſpiration.</p>
               <p>I may (with a good Aſſurance) object againſt the common Proceedings in this Diſeaſe; ſince both Reaſon and Practice will defend me.</p>
               <p>The Common Method is rough Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharticks and Emeticks; ſuch as Turbiths Mineral, Panacea of Antimony, Gambo-Elebor,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0010402200:47"/>Elaterium, and ſuch like Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, which by Repetition, relax and tear thoſe Veſſels that are already weaken'd with the Diſeaſe: Thus the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is reduc'd into ſuch a wea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it will be paſt the Art of Man to reſtore him; notwithſtanding he is flatter'd at firſt, and thinks himſelf ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better, when his Stomach and Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els are emptied by the aforeſaid Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Thus the Phyſician and the Patient are both deceiv'd, for want of knowing that every rough Purge and ſtraining Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit weakens the Periſtaltick Motion, and benumbs the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> and all the Uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Veſſels that are deſign'd to ſuck up the Water, when there is more in the Belly, than the neceſſary Quantity.</p>
               <p>Now it is worth the Phyſician's While to conſider that the Bowels ſwim in this Water; the Water is not in the Bowels, therefore if we aim at a perfect Cure, we muſt uſe Diureticks, and reſtorative Medicines; for as ſoon as the <hi>Viſcera</hi> and Urinary Veſſels recover their Strength, and the Bowels the Warmth and natural Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0010402200:48"/>the uſual Paſſages will then be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of receiving the Water, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging it out, both by Urine and Stool.</p>
               <p>I do not want to conceal any thing, that might be depended upon, to render my Works more uſeful for the Health and Preſervation of Mankind; although there are ſome particular Medicines which I have found ſucceſſful, and know to be infallible, if duly adminiſtred, and the Patient at the ſame time rightly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged; but ſo various are the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Human Bodies, and ſo particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar are their Tempers, that if a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine does not ſuit with their Ways of thinking, they can hardly be perſuaded to take it; and even then they will not repeat it, becauſe it does not take away the Swelling all of a ſudden, as a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, at her full Time with Child, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd of her Big-belly by a Midwife.</p>

               <head>Of the Stone and Gravel.</head>
               <p>MOST Jellys, or mucilaginous Matter, fix'd, or lying in any part of the Body without motion, by vital Heat becomes hard or tough; and, in time, turns to Bone or Stone.</p>
               <p>So the Stone (being bred of Slime, which fixes itſelf in the Urinary Veſſels) is more ſubject to Children, than grown Perſons; whoſe Bodies are by Nature ſtronger, and more liable to caſt off by Evacuation, that ſort of ſlimy Matter, which petrifies by lying in the urinary Veſſels without motion.</p>
               <p>Indeed, the Gravel is more apt to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict grown People; for, as Time turns moſt hard things to duſt; ſo the Stone, as it grows ripe, begins to canker and crumble to Sand and Gravel, which cauſes Pain as it paſſes out through the Ure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thra; therefore it is a great Miſtake, to think that the Gravel breeds the Stone; for it is the Stone that produces the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.</p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:0010402200:50"/>
               <p>We muſt be very cautious in giving Diureticks; for by their forcing Quality the Patient is very much tormented.</p>
               <p>A Decoction of Mallows, Emulſions, and all oily Medicines, are neceſſary, by mollifying and healing the Fibres in the urinary Paſſages: But no Medicine can be more effectual, when the Pain is vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, than a Turpentine Glyſter; which gives Eaſe by its unctuous and healing Quality. Thus, as often as the ſharpneſs of the Diſeaſe returns, the Patient may be made tolerable eaſy; until Time crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Stone into Particles, ſmall enough to come away without much Pain.</p>
               <p>It ought to be conſider'd, that People in Years are apt to have Inflammations, and Soreneſſes in the Bladder and <hi>Pelvis,</hi> which are frequently miſtaken for the Stone.</p>
               <p>Manna taken once in ten Days, is an exceeding good Medicine for any Sore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Ulcer in the Bladder or Kidneys; and is alſo very proper, even in the Stone and Gravel, by preventing any Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Kidneys: For Manna being
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0010402200:51"/>opening and cooling, gently carries off all corroſive Humours from thoſe Parts.</p>
               <p>As I was objecting againſt forcing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, I will further ſay, that when we attempt to force Nature, we commonly obſtruct her, as is demonſtrable to any skilful. Practitioner: yet with Care the Stone may, in a great meaſure, be caus'd to crumble to Pieces.</p>
               <p>I once thought myſelf Maſter of this Knack of diſſolving the Stone (as I call'd it) having had ſurpriſing Succeſs in three different Children, who were about five or ſix Years old; which puff'd me up with Vanity; until I was call'd to a Child of Mr. <hi>Weſt</hi>'s, a Carpenter, in <hi>Swan Yard,</hi> in the <hi>Strand:</hi> I was then very young and giddy headed; aſſur'd 'em I could diſſolve the Stone, and bring it away. Here I was diſappointed; the Child's Pain increaſed ſo much, that they ſent to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, who had recourſe to his Knife; and I was laugh'd at, and deſpis'd; and perhaps it was better it happen'd ſo: For had I ſucceeded here, I ſhould have been more obſtinate in my Practice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0010402200:52"/>Reaſon: Since this, I never would attempt to break the Stone in the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Though, I confefs, if I had a Child of my own afflicted with it, I would uſe all Means, before he ſhould receive that Hurt by Lithotomy, which they ſcarce ever perfectly recover.</p>

               <p>THIS Diſeaſe has certainly been for Time out of mind, although it has ſhown itſelf of late Years in ſharper Symptoms, by reaſon of eating great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of Sugar, and foreign Sweets, which create a corroſive Quality in the Fluids; and I really believe it was this Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that in old Times was call'd the Plague of a Leproſy, and the hoary Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer; and was thought to be occaſioned by the Men cohabiting with their Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the time of Natural Purgations; and to prevent theſe kind of Diſorders, or Uncleanneſſes, the Elders made very
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0010402200:53"/>ſtrict Laws to reſtrain the People at ſuch Times. But if they had reſtrained every Man to one Woman only, and likewiſe every Woman to one Man only, it would then have had the deſir'd Effect; for the Pox was caus'd then, as it may now, by Exceſs; (for exceſs of any thing is Poiſon,) I mean Exceſs in Venery; when one Woman admits, or is compell'd to receive the Seeds of ſeveral Men one immediately after another, though they are all ſound Men, and the Woman like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſound and well, yet the variety of Seeds thus fermenting within the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix, will inflame and corrode the Parts of Generation.</p>
               <p>I need not ſet down the nature of a freſh Clap, becauſe it is done by ſo many before; nor the Method of Cure, ſince People, for the ſake of ſaving their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, will apply to any Apprentice, or Quack, who plies 'em off with rough Medicines, and puts even themſelves to ſix times the Expence that is neceſſary, and the Patient, to ſixty times the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency. For there are ſome Symptoms,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0010402200:54"/>at the firſt beginning, which are very ſharp and dangerous, and prove of fatal Conſequence, if not manag'd with both Care and Judgment.</p>
               <p>I have not had a great deal of Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in Venereal Caſes, yet I have met with ſome particular Diſorders which may be worth mentioning; ſuch as ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born <hi>Gonorrhaeas;</hi> a continual pain, or rather a Tenderneſs upon the Bone of the Noſe; a Flux of ſharp Humour from the Ears; an Ulcer in the Throat, or <hi>Uvula,</hi> and ſuch like Diſorders: which I have met with in Perſons whoſe Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions have in a manner been worn out, by repeating Mercurial Medicines ſo often, that at laſt they would neither purge nor ſalivate, by reaſon of the Glands being ſtunn'd, and the <hi>Mucus</hi> and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Moiſture exhauſted.</p>
               <p>In ſuch like Caſes the Cure conſiſts in warming reſtorative Medicines; the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, at the ſame time, muſt ſtick to a nouriſhing Diet, in order to cheriſh and ſtrengthen Nature; for as the Glands re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their true Tone, and the Fluids
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0010402200:55"/>their vital Spirit, the mercurial Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, which lie dormant, will then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to work their Effect, either by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Purging, or a gentle Salivation. This is what I can affirm from Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience, which is a Proof beyond Reaſon itſelf.</p>
               <p>I would not have the World miſtake me, to think that I am exclaiming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Mercury; for I find it the moſt effectual, and the eaſieſt Method of Cure; and indeed the ſafeſt, if it is manag'd rightly. And that Hoarſeneſs, or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order upon the Lungs, which ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently enſues a Salivation, proceeds not from the Mercury, but from ſome Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>management, either in their Diet, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper Medicines given upon Mercury, under pretence of taking off the Sali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: For Mercury is ſeldom mended by other Medicines, it is frequently made worſe. Neither does the Virtue of Diet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinks conſiſt in the Quality of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients, but in the Quantity the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient drinks. For ſuppoſe there ſhould remain a corroſive Quality in the Body

               <p>But however I am convinc'd that Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, if honeſtly prepar'd, leaves no Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon behind it, if the Phyſician will let it work off in its own eaſy Manner; yet as the Lungs are refin'd by a Salivation, they become very tender, and liable to be hurt by all Cordial Medicines or Wines, and any Spirituous Liquors: There is not half ſo much Danger of taking Cold as is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd; for if I was to ſalivate a Perſon at the Hazard of my own Life, I would keep him no hotter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <head>Of the Gout.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>JUVENIS Voluptate abundans edit potatque; Senectute autem invadente, vigor naturalis evaneſcet, multis occupatur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que moeroribus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So the Gout proceeds from Indulgencies
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0010402200:57"/>we give ourſelves up to, when we find a Slackneſs of Deſire; for then we begin to fear a Decay; and with vain Hopes of prompting ourſelves to our former Gaiety and Vigour, drink Wines and Spirituous Liquors, without a Natural Thirſt or real Deſire, and eat Loads of Rich Victuals, without the true Rule of Appetite.</p>
               <p>Thus, by overloading the Stomach, the Fibres and Pores or Paſſages, by which the Nouriſhment ſteams or perſpires out of the Stomach into the Lacteals, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lax'd or dilated; ſo that the Nouriſhment which is drawn into the Lacteals, is too heavy, and of a crude and clammy Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; which Diſtemper being communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the Blood, irregulates the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Artery and the Nerve; for there is a Nerve lies cloſe along with every Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and at every Pulſation of Blood from the Heart, theſe Nerves give a Jirk (for a better Expreſſion I may call it a recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or an aſſiſtive Motion) which draws along the Pulſation of Blood by the ſame Motion at the ſame Moment into every Artery in the Body; for notwithſtanding the Motion of the Heart being very forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0010402200:58"/>it could not drive the Blood with that Quickneſs into the extreme Parts at every Syſtole, if it was not aſſiſted by the Nerve in the Manner I have deſcrib'd.</p>
               <p>Now the Blood being heavy and clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, cannot circulate back again by the Veins quick enough to receive the Blood from the Artery; and when an Artery is thus obſtructed, the Pulſations come by Puſhes, or Thruſts, ſtriving for Freedom, yet the Nerve keeps it's true Motion; and this Irregularity of Time and Motion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Nerve and the Artery, tears ſome of the fine Membranes which brace 'em together.</p>
               <p>Now thoſe Membranes being tore by the aforeſaid Puſhes, or Thruſts, cauſe that violent Pain, and produce a kind of Jel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which by lying in a continual Heat, grows Hard, ſo that in time it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble Chalk Stones, which I confeſs is very ſurpriſing; yet an Egg Shell is more like Chalk, being form'd of a Natural Matter and a neceſſary Heat, as the Gout Stones are form'd of falſe Matter, and Supernatural Heat.</p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:0010402200:59"/>
               <p>I am very certain that the Gout may be cur'd where the Patient will regulate his Life, and conquer himſelf to a proper Diet.</p>
               <p>I might make a long Diſcourſe on the Particulars, from the Experience I have had, having been afflicted with it myſelf before I was two and thirty Years Old: I confeſs I am partly aſhamed, as I impute the Gout to the aforeſaid Cauſes, yet I may tell it with ſome Pride, the Conqueſt I have made in being entirely free from any Symptom of it now.</p>
               <p>But I can hardly believe any one will reſtrain himſelf with ſo much Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as I did, therefore I need not ſet down the Method I took with myſelf, only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe the Patient never to eat above a Quarter of a Pound of Solid Victuals at one Meal, although that Quantity may be eaten every three Hours; neither muſt he drink above a Quarter of a Pint of Liquor at one Draught, yet he may drink as often as Deſire prompts him, ſo that his Liquor be not too ſtrong, nor ſtale, but rather new and upon the Ferment; for
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0010402200:60"/>new working Small Beer, and even parch'd Peas are very proper, likewiſe all windy Things whatſoever that may in any Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure quicken Motion and Circulation; perhaps ſome Perſons may object againſt windy Things, for fear of the Cholick, yet it is without Reaſon; for the Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick cannot be cur'd without things that ferment in the Stomach, and quicken the Periſtaltick Motion.</p>
               <p>In the Gout it is neceſſary that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient ſhould drink plentifully, ſo his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors are proper; for it is a kind of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as we find when we are awak'd out of our Sleep with the Pain, and a rigorous Diſorder in the Nerves throughout the whole Body; yet it is not ſafe to attempt a Cure by the aforeſaid Method, nor any ways to depreſs Nature, until the violence of the Fit goes off; therefore Strong Wines and all warming Bitters are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to defend the Stomach, while the Patient has the Fit upon him; yet a ſtrong Decoction of Camomile Flowers drank hot every Night going to Bed, is prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0010402200:61"/>to Snake Root, or any other Bitter whatſoever.</p>
               <p>I am not guilty of fancying one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Medicine Univerſal, or fit to be given in all Diſtempers; yet I will recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Elixir of Vipers in the Gout; it may be given even in the violence of the Fit; it ſecures the Stomach by cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating an inward Briskneſs and Thirſt; for a Thirſt is a very good Symptom in the Gout, as a devouring Appetite is a bad one, before the Fit comes on.</p>
               <p>It is very remarkable how the Patient eats with a prodigious Greedineſs a Day or two before the Fit begins, but not with a Natural Hunger, nor Pleaſure; for when a Man who is very hungry ſits down calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to a Diſh of Soop, or ſome ſuch thing half digeſted, he may feel in three or four Minutes a Sweetneſs and Delight flow to each Breaſt, as the Nouriſhment ſteams out of the Stomach into the Lacteal Veſſels; and when a Perſon debars himſelf from eating longer than ordinary, Nature then calls in the <hi>Mucus</hi> from all the Glands, and the Moiſture in the Muſcles from
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0010402200:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>all the extreme Parts, to ſupport the Heart and Spirit that Motion may not ceaſe; but ſtill this Suction of Nature will reach farther; for if a Man was to be quite debar'd from eating and drinking, his Life might be preſerv'd conſiderably long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by a nouriſhing Poultice made of Bread moiſten'd with Wine and Gravy, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to each Breaſt, for the Breaſts are moſt capable of communicating a Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment to cheriſh and ſupport the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits, becauſe there is no Muſcle or fleſhy Subſtance outwardly, that has ſo near a Communication to the Heart and Stomach; <hi>here I make a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> Stop.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With ſome Doubt and Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I am reflecting on my own Works; been telling a Friend, a Man in Practice, that I have ſpent a few Hours in writing the Natural Cauſes and Steps to the Cure of ſeveral Diſtempers, who gave me a deſpiſable Sneer, and told me that a great many Fools are publiſh'd of late, and are as much aſham'd of themſelves, when they come to ſee their Thoughts in Print, as they were in love with their Works whilſt
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0010402200:63"/>in Manuſcripts: Beſides, ſays he, can a giddy headed young Fellow of five and thirty be capable of Matters in Phyſick, which ought to be from Thoughts moſt ſolid and ſublime?</p>
               <p>I confeſs the Spirit that leads me is ſelf-Opinion, and I believe no Man writes without it, and the ſtronger this Spirit is in any Author, the more valuable are his Works, if there be but the Weight of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in his Thoughts; and the Thoughts of ſeveral valuable and ſublime Things are loſt, for want of being comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and encouraged.</p>
               <p>Thus I recover myſelf again from that Reflection of Youth and Vanity, with an Aſſurance that if a Man be ever capable of doing Wonders, it muſt be while he is in his Prime; before heavy Days come, when his Senſes grow ſlack and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; for then his Sight, his Taſte, and Smell deceive him.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe a Man whoſe Sight is decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was to give a Deſcription of a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle burning about ſix Yards from him; how muſt he deſcribe it to us? Muſt he
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0010402200:64"/>ſay there's a Circle round it, or Streams of Light, or ſome ſuch Imperfection which he ſees, though he's ſure it is not in the Candle, but in his Senſe of Sight; how is he ſure? Becauſe he remembers the Candle burnt perfect when his Sight was clear. But the Diſorders in the Eyes, I ſhall preſerve among ſome practical Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations and Experiments in Anatomy, which if I had a full Authority, I ſhould be glad to publiſh, with the Cauſes of ſeveral other Chronical Diſeaſes: For my Deſign is to ſet down the real Cauſes of Diſtempers, and ill Proceedings in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral remarkable Caſes, whereby many bad Symptoms in ſeveral Diſeaſes may be ſhun'd eaſier than cur'd; yet Wonders may be done in all Diſtempers by a skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Phyſician, and a careful Nurſe, where the Patient complies with Rules neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for his Diſorder.</p>
               <p>I cannot believe it the Will of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, that a Man ſhall be ſnatch'd away before he has run his due Courſe with Nature.</p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:0010402200:65"/>
               <p>For certainly, when there is a Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it ought to come to a Natural Birth, at a Natural Time; and after a Child is born, (if it is not hurt nor hinder'd) it muſt grow to a Natural Strength, and the Courſe of Life to be of a Natural Length; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Diſeaſes are always caus'd by ſome Hurt or ill Rules of Life.</p>
               <p>People cannot die in their Youth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Nature be depreſs'd, or overſet; Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may be depreſs'd even to Death by Hunger, Coldneſs, or Loſs of Blood; and She may be overſet by Dread, or Surprize, violent Motion, or exceſſive Eating and Drinking: How often do we find Nurſes deſtroy Young Children by Strong Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, or ſtuffing 'em to ſuch a Degree, that Nature is overſet, and they are ſeiz'd with Convulſions, and die.</p>
               <p>Yet it may be neceſſary ſometimes to curb, or rather depreſs Nature; at other times it may be neceſſary to cheriſh, or rather prompt her; ſo the Courſe of Life may in ſome Meaſure be prolong'd by Management and Care.</p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:0010402200:66"/>
               <p>But I am very ſenſible that Nature will change, and Life muſt come towards a Period; for as Deſire abates, we then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to bow down our Faces with Care againſt the Earth, to ſee that we tread our Steps in Safety; and when the Marks of Age are carried in the Face of Man, he lies down to reſt in Grief, ſlumbering, in his Fancy hears the Bird o' th' Night, ſtarts up in Fear of that which is on High; While thus he liſtens, his Ears, and all the Gates are open, until his Thoughts are overſet with Dread, then the Harmony ceaſes, becauſe the Strings of Muſick are ſlack; thus, the Gariſon is given up to the great Conqueror, and the Soul to God that gave it.</p>
