            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IN an age advanced to the higheſt degree of refinement, that ſpecies of curioſity commences, which is buſied in contemplating the progreſs of ſocial life, in diſplaying the gradations of ſcience, and in tracing the tranſitions from barbariſm to civility.</p>
            <p>That theſe ſpeculations ſhould become the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite purſuits, and the faſhionable topics, of ſuch a period, is extremely natural. We look back on the ſavage condition of our anceſtors with the triumph of ſuperiority; we are pleaſed to mark the ſteps by which we have been raiſed from rudeneſs to elegance: and our reflections on this ſubject are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a conſcious pride, ariſing in great meaſure from a tacit compariſon of the infinite diſproportion between the feeble efforts of remote ages, and our preſent improvements in knowledge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0373500101:4"/>
In the mean time, the manners, monuments, cuſtoms, practices, and opinions of antiquity, by forming ſo ſtrong a contraſt with thoſe of our own times, and by exhibiting human nature and human inventions in new lights, in in unexpected appearances, and in various forms, are objects which forcibly ſtrike a feeling imagination.</p>
            <p>Nor does this ſpectacle afford nothing more than a fruitleſs gratification to the fancy. It teaches us to ſet a juſt eſtimation on our own acquiſitions; and encourages us to cheriſh that cultivation, which is ſo cloſely connected with the exiſtence and the exerciſe of every ſocial virtue.</p>
            <p>On theſe principles, to develop the dawnings of genius, and to purſue the progreſs of our national poetry, from a rude origin and obſcure beginnings, to its perfection in a poliſhed age, muſt prove an intereſting and inſtructive inveſtigation. But a hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of poetry, for another reaſon, yet on the ſame principles, muſt be more eſpecially productive of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment and utility. I mean, as it is an art, whoſe object is human ſociety: as it has the peculiar merit, in its operations on that object, of faithfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording the features of the times, and of preſerving
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0373500101:5"/>
the moſt pictureſque and expreſſive repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of manners: and, becauſe the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of compoſition in every nation are thoſe of the poet, as it poſſeſſes the additional advantage of tranſmitting to poſterity genuine delineations of life in its ſimpleſt ſtages. Let me add, that anec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes of the rudiments of a favourite art will always be particularly pleaſing. The more early ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens of poetry muſt ever amuſe, in proportion to the pleaſure which we receive from its finiſhed productions.</p>
            <p>Much however depends on the execution of ſuch a deſign, and my readers are to decide in what degree I have done juſtice to ſo ſpecious and promiſing a diſquiſition. Yet a few more words will not be perhaps improper, in vindication, or rather in explanation, of the manner in which my work has been conducted. I am ſure I do not mean, nor can I pretend, to apologiſe for its defects.</p>
            <p>I have choſe to exhibit the hiſtory of our poetry in a chronological ſeries: not diſtributing my mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into detached articles, of periodical diviſions, or of general heads. Yet I have not always adhered ſo ſcrupulouſly to the regularity of annals, but that I
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0373500101:6"/>
have often deviated into incidental digreſſions; and have ſometimes ſtopped in the courſe of my career, for the ſake of recapitulation, for the purpoſe of collecting ſcattered notices into a ſingle and uniform point of view, for the more exact inſpection of a topic which required a ſeparate conſideration, or for a comparative ſurvey of the poetry of other nations.</p>
            <p>A few years ago, Mr. MASON, with that liberality which ever accompanies true genius, gave me an authentic copy of Mr. POPE'S ſcheme of a Hiſtory of Engliſh Poetry, in which our poets were claſſed under their ſuppoſed reſpective ſchools. The late lamented Mr. GRAY had alſo projected a work of this kind, and tranſlated ſome Runic odes for its illuſtration, now publiſhed: but ſoon relinquiſhing the proſecution of a deſign, which would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained him from his own noble inventions, he moſt obligingly condeſcended to favour me with the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his plan, which I found to be that of Mr. POPE, conſiderably enlarged, extended, and improved.</p>
            <p>It is vanity in me to have mentioned theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications. But I am apprehenſive my vanity will juſtly be thought much greater, when it ſhall appear, that in giving the hiſtory of Engliſh poetry,
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0373500101:7"/>
I have rejected the ideas of men who are its moſt diſtinguiſhed ornaments. To confeſs the real truth, upon examination and experiment, I ſoon diſcovered their mode of treating my ſubject, plauſible as it is, and brilliant in theory, to be attended with difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and inconveniencies, and productive of embaraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both to the reader and the writer. Like other ingenious ſyſtems, it ſacrificed much uſeful intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to the obſervance of arrangement; and in the place of that ſatisfaction which reſults from a clearneſs and a fulneſs of information, ſeemed only to ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute the merit of diſpoſition, and the praiſe of contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance. The conſtraint impoſed by a mechanical atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this diſtribution, appeared to me to deſtroy that free exertion of reſearch with which ſuch a hiſtory ought to be executed, and not eaſily recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable with that complication, variety, and extent of materials, which it ought to comprehend.</p>
            <p>The method I have purſued, on one account at leaſt, ſeems preferable to all others. My performance, in its preſent form, exhibits without tranſpoſition the gradual improvements of our poetry, at the ſame time that it uniformly repreſents the progreſſion of our language.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0373500101:8"/>
Some perhaps will be of opinion, that theſe annals ought to have commenced with a view of the Saxon poetry. But beſides that a legitimate illuſtration of that jejune and intricate ſubject would have almoſt doubled my labour, that the Saxon language is familiar only to a few learned antiquaries, that our Saxon poems are for the moſt part little more than religious rhapſodies, and that ſcarce any compoſitions remain marked with the native images of that people in their pagan ſtate, every reader that reflects but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on our political eſtabliſhment muſt perceive, that the Saxon poetry has no connection with the nature and purpoſe of my preſent undertaking. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Norman acceſſion, which ſucceeded to the Saxon government, we were an unformed and an unſettled race. That mighty revolution obliterated almoſt all relation to the former inhabitants of this iſland; and produced that ſignal change in our policy, conſtitution, and public manners, the effects of which have reached modern times. The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of theſe annals ſeems therefore to be moſt properly dated from that era, when our national character began to dawn.</p>
            <p>It was recommended to me, by a perſon eminent in the republic of letters, totally to exclude from
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0373500101:9"/>
theſe volumes any mention of the Engliſh drama. I am very ſenſible that a juſt hiſtory of our Stage is alone ſufficient to form an entire and extenſive work; and this argument, which is by no means pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by the attempt here offered to the public, ſtill remains ſeparately to be diſcuſſed, at large, and in form. But as it was profeſſedly my intention to compriſe every ſpecies of Engliſh Poetry, this, among the reſt, of courſe claimed a place in theſe annals, and neceſſarily fell into my general deſign. At the ſame time, as in this ſituation it could only become a ſubordinate object, it was impoſſible I ſhould examine it with that critical preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and particularity, which ſo large, ſo curious, and ſo important an article of our poetical literature demands and deſerves. To have conſidered it in its full extent, would have produced the unwieldy excreſcence of a diſproportionate epiſode: not to have conſidered it at all, had been an omiſſion, which muſt detract from the integrity of my intended plan. I flatter myſelf however, that from evidences hitherto unexplored, I have recovered hints which may facilitate the labours of thoſe, who ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be inclined to inveſtigate the antient ſtate of dramatic exhibition in this country, with due com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion and accuracy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0373500101:10"/>
It will probably be remarked, that the citations in the firſt volume are numerous, and ſometimes very prolix. But it ſhould be remembered, that moſt of theſe are extracted from antient manuſcript poems never before printed, and hitherto but little known. Nor was it eaſy to illuſtrate the darker and more diſtant periods of our poetry, without producing ample ſpecimens. In the mean time, I hope to merit the thanks of the antiquarian, for enriching the ſtock of our early literature by theſe new acceſſions: and I truſt I ſhall gratify the reader of taſte, in having ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently reſcued from oblivion the rude inventions and irregular beauties of the heroic tale, or the romantic legend.</p>
            <p>The deſign of the DISSERTATIONS is to prepare the reader, by conſidering apart, in a connected and comprehenſive detail, ſome material points of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and preliminary nature, and which could not either with equal propriety or convenience be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, at leaſt not ſo formally diſcuſſed, in the body of the book; to eſtabliſh certain fundamental princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to which frequent appeals might occaſionally be made, and to clear the way for various obſervations ariſing in the courſe of my future enquiries.</p>

            <head>OF THE ORIGIN OF ROMANTIC FICTION in EUROPE.</head>
            <head type="sub">DISSERTATION I.</head>
            <p>THAT peculiar and arbitrary ſpecies of Fiction which we commonly call Romantic, was entirely unknown to the writers of Greece and Rome. It appears to have been imported into Europe by a people, whoſe modes of thinking, and habits of invention, are not natural to that country. It is generally ſuppoſed to have been borrowed from the Arabians. But this origin has not been hitherto perhaps examined or aſcertained with a ſufficient degree of accuracy. It is my preſent deſign, by a more diſtinct and extended inquiry than has yet been applied to the ſubject, to trace the manner and the period of its introduction into the popular belief, the oral poetry, and the literature, of the Europeans.</p>
            <p>It is an eſtabliſhed maxim of modern criticiſm, that the fictions of Arabian imagination were communicated to the
<pb facs="tcp:0373500101:16"/>
weſtern world by means of the cruſades. Undoubtedly thoſe expeditions greatly contributed to propagate this mode of fabling in Europe. But it is evident, although a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which certainly makes no material difference as to the principles here eſtabliſhed, that theſe fancies were intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced at a much earlier period. The Saracens, or Arabians, having been for ſome time ſeated on the northern coaſts of Africa, entered Spain about the beginning of the eighth cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury <note n="a" place="bottom">See ALMAKIN, edit. Pocock. p. 72.</note>. Of this country they ſoon effected a complete con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt: and impoſing their religion, language, and cuſtoms, upon the inhabitants, erected a royal ſeat in the capital city of Cordoua.</p>
            <p>That by means of this eſtabliſhment they firſt revived the ſciences of Greece in Europe, will be proved at large in another place <note n="b" place="bottom">See the ſecond Diſſertation.</note>: and it is obvious to conclude, that at the ſame time they diſſeminated thoſe extravagant inventions which were ſo peculiar to their romantic and creative genius. A manuſcript cited by Du Cange acquaints us, that the Spaniards, ſoon after the irruption of the Saracens, entirely neglected the ſtudy of the Latin language; and captivated with the novelty of the oriental books imported by theſe ſtrangers, ſuddenly adopted an unuſual pomp of ſtyle, and an affected elevation of diction <note n="c" place="bottom">

               </note>. The ideal tales of theſe eaſtern invaders, recommended by a brilliancy of deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a variety of imagery, and an exuberance of invention, hitherto unknown and unfamiliar to the cold and barren conceptions of a weſtern climate, were eagerly caught up, and univerſally diffuſed. From Spain, by the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a conſtant commercial intercourſe through the ports of Toulon and Marſeilles, they ſoon paſſed into France and Italy.</p>

Milton, whoſe imagination was much ſtruck with the old Britiſh ſtory, more than once alludes to the Welſh colony planted in Armorica by Maximus and the prince of Meiriadoc.

            <p>This migration of the Welſh into Britany or Armorica, which during the diſtractions of the empire, in conſequence of the numerous armies of barbarians with which Rome was ſurrounded on every ſide, had thrown off its dependence on the Romans, ſeems to have occaſioned a cloſe connection between the two countries for many centuries <note n="k" place="bottom">This ſeceſſion of the Welſh, at ſo cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical a period, was extremely natural, into a neighbouring maritime country, with which they had conſtantly trafficked, and which, like themſelves, had diſclaimed the Roman yoke. It is not related in any Greek or Roman hiſtorian. But their ſilence is by no means a ſufficient warrant for us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the numerous teſtimonies of the old Britiſh writers concerning this event. It is mentioned, in particular, by Llywarchen, a famous bard, who lived only one hundred and fifty years afterwards. Many of his poems are ſtill extant, in which he cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brates his twenty-four ſons who wore gold chains, and were all killed in battles againſt the Saxons.</note>. Nor will
<pb facs="tcp:0373500101:19"/>
it prove leſs neceſſary to our purpoſe to obſerve, that the Corniſh Britons, whoſe language was another dialect of the antient Britiſh, from the fourth or fifth century downwards, maintained a no leſs intimate correſpondence with the natives of Armorica: intermarrying with them, and perpetually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorting thither for the education of their children, for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, for procuring troops againſt the Saxons, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of traffick, and various other occaſions. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection was ſo ſtrongly kept up, that an ingenious French antiquary ſuppoſes, that the communications of the Armori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans with the Corniſh had chiefly contributed to give a roughneſs or rather hardneſs to the romance or French language in ſome of the provinces, towards the eleventh century, which was not before diſcernible <note n="l" place="bottom">

And this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe will appear more natural, if we conſider, that not only Armorica, a maritime province of Gaul, never much frequented by the Romans, and now totally deſerted by them, was ſtill in ſome meaſure a Celtic nation; but that alſo the inhabitants of Cornwall, together with thoſe of Devonſhire and of the adjoining parts of Somerſetſhire, intermixing in a very ſlight degree with the Romans, and having ſuffered fewer important alterations in their original conſtitution and cuſtoms from the imperial laws and police than any other province of this iſland, long preſerved their genuine manners and Britiſh character: and forming a ſort of ſeparate princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality under the government of a ſucceſſion of powerful chieftains, uſually denominated princes or dukes of Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall, remained partly in a ſtate of independence during the Saxon heptarchy, and were not entirely reduced till the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man conqueſt.

And here I digreſs a moment to remark, that in the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance juſt mentioned about Wales, of its connection with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morica, we perceive the ſolution of a difficulty which at firſt ſight appears extremely problematical: I mean, not only that Wales ſhould have been ſo conſtantly made the theatre of the old Britiſh chivalry, but that ſo many of the favorite fictions which occur in the early French romances, ſhould alſo be literally found in the tales and chronicles of the elder Welſh bards <note n="n" place="bottom">The ſtory of LE COURT MANTEL, or the BOY AND THE MANTLE, told by an old French troubadour cited by M. de Sainte Palaye, is recorded in many manuſcript Welſh chronicles, as I learn from original letters of Lhuyd in the Aſhmolean Muſeum. See Mem. Anc. Chev. i. 119. And Obſ. Spenſer, i. §. ii. p. 54. 55. And from the ſame authority I am informed, that the fiction of the giant's coat compoſed of the beards of the kings whom he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, is related in the legends of the bards of both countries. See Obſ. Spenſ. ut ſupr. p. 24. ſeq. But inſtances are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable.</note>. It was owing to the perpetual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication kept up between the Welſh, and the people of Armorica who abounded in theſe fictions, and who na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally took occaſion to interweave them into the hiſtory of their friends and allies. Nor are we now at a loſs to give the reaſon why Cornwall, in the ſame French romances, is made the ſcene and the ſubject of ſo many romantic adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures <note n="o" place="bottom">Hence in the Armorican tales juſt quoted, mention is made of Totneſs and Exeter, anciently included in Cornwall. In Chaucer's ROMAUNT OF THE ROSE we have <q rend="inline">"Hornpipis of Cornewaile,"</q> among a great variety of muſical inſtruments. v. 4250. This is literally from the French original, v. 3991.</note>. In the meantime we may obſerve, what indeed has been already implied, that a ſtrict intercourſe was upheld between Cornwall and Wales. Their languages, cuſtoms, and alliances, as I have hinted, were the ſame; and they were ſeparated only by a ſtrait of inconſiderable breadth. Cornwall is frequently ſtyled Weſt-Wales by the Britiſh writers. At the invaſion of the Saxons, both countries became indiſcriminately the receptacle of the fugitive Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons. We find the Welſh and Corniſh, as one people, often uniting themſelves as in a national cauſe againſt the Saxons. They were frequently ſubject to the ſame prince <note n="p" place="bottom">Who was ſometimes choſen from Wales and Cornwall, and ſometimes from AR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MORICA.

Llygad Gwr, a Welſh bard, in his ſublime and ſpirited ode to Llwellyn, ſon of Grunfludd, the laſt prince of Wales of the Britiſh line, has a wiſh, <q rend="inline">"May the prints of the hoofs of my prince's ſteed be ſeen as far as CORNWALL <note n="q" place="bottom">Evans, p. 43.</note>.</q> Traditions about king Arthur, to mention no more inſtances, are as popular in Cornwall as in Wales: and moſt of the romantic caſtles, rocks, rivers, and caves, of both nations, are alike at this day diſtinguiſhed by ſome noble atchievement, at leaſt by the name, of that celebrated champion. But to return.</p>
            <p>About the year 1100, Gualter, archdeacon of Oxford, a learned man, and a diligent collector of hiſtories, travelling through France, procured in Armorica an antient chronicle written in the Britiſh or Armorican language, entitled, BRUT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Y-BRENHINED, or THE HISTORY OF THE KINGS OF BRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAIN <note n="r" place="bottom">In the curious library of the family of Davies at Llanerk in Denbighſhire, there is a copy of this chronicle in the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing of Guttyn Owen, a celebrated Welſh bard and antiquarian about the year 1470, who aſcribes it to Tyſſilio a biſhop, and the ſon of Brockmael-Yſcythroc prince of Powis. Tyſſilio indeed wrote a HIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TORY OF BRITAIN; but that work, as we are aſſured by Lhuyd in the ARCHAEO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOGIA, was entirely eccleſiaſtical, and has been long ſince loſt.</note>. This book he brought into England, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated it to Geoffrey of Monmouth, a Welſh Benedictine monk, an elegant writer of Latin, and admirably ſkilled in the Britiſh tongue. Geoffrey, at the requeſt and recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Gualter the archdeacon, tranſlated this Britiſh chronicle into Latin <note n="s" place="bottom">See Galfr. Mon.

Hiſt. Engl. p. 12. There are no FLAMINES or ARCHFLAMINES in the Britiſh book. See Uſher's Primord. p. 57. Dubl. edit. There are very few ſpeeches in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, and thoſe very ſhort. Geoffrey's FULGENIUS is in the Britiſh copy SU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIEN, which by analogy in Latin would be JULIANUS. See Milton's Hiſt. Eng. p. 100. There is no LEIL in the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh; that king's name was LLEON. Geoffrey's CAERLISLE is in the Britiſh CAERLLEON, or Weſt-Cheſter. In the Britiſh, LLAW AP CYNFARCH, ſhould have been tranſlated LEO, which is now rendered LOTH. This has brought much confuſion into the old Scotch hiſtory. I find no BELINUS in the Britiſh copy; the name is BELI, which ſhould have been in Latin BELIUS, or BELGIUS. Geoffrey's BRENNUS in the original is BRAN, a common name among the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons; as BRAN AP DYFNWAL, &amp;c. See Suida's <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>. It appears by the original, that the Britiſh name of CA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAUSIUS was CARAWN; hence TRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GARAUN, i. e. TREGARON, and the river CARAUN, which gives name to ABERCORN. In the Britiſh there is no diviſion into books and chapters, a mark of antiquity. Thoſe whom the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator calls CONSULS of Rome, when Brennus took it, are in the original TWYSOGION, i. e. princes or generals. The Gwalenſes, GWALO, or GWALAS, are added by Geoffrey, B. xii. c. 19."</q> To what is here obſerved about SILIUS, I will add, that abbot Whethamſted, in his MS. GRANARIUM, mentions SILOIUS the father of Brutus. <q rend="inline">"Quomodo Brutus SILOII filius ad litora Angliae venit," &amp;c.</q>

The manuſcript in Jeſus college library at Oxford, which Wynne pretends to be the ſame which Geoffrey himſelf made uſe of, is evidently not older than the ſixteenth century. Mr. Price, the Bodleian librarian, to whoſe friendſhip this work is much indebted, has two copies lately given him by Mr. Banks, much more antient and perfect. But there is reaſon to ſuſpect, that moſt of the Britiſh manuſcripts of this hiſtory are tranſlations from Geoffrey's Latin: for <hi>Britannia</hi> they have BRYTTAEN, which in the original would have been PRYDAIN. Geoffrey's tranſlation, and for obvious reaſons, is a very common manuſcript. Compare Lhuyd's Arch. p. 265.</p>

It is difficult to aſcertain exactly the period at which our tranſlator's original romance may probably be ſuppoſed to have been compiled. Yet this is a curious ſpeculation, and will illuſtrate our argument. I am inclined to think that the work conſiſts of fables thrown out by different rhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſodiſts at different times, which afterwards were collected and digeſted into an entire hiſtory, and perhaps with new decorations of fancy added by the compiler, who moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably was one of the profeſſed bards, or rather a poetical hiſtorian, of Armorica or Baſſe Bretagne. In this ſtate, and under this form, I ſuppoſe it to have fallen into the hands of Geoffrey of Monmouth. If the hypotheſis hereafter ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced concerning the particular ſpecies of fiction on which this narrative is founded, ſhould be granted, it cannot, from what I have already proved, be more antient than the eighth century: and we may reaſonably conclude, that it was compoſed much later, as ſome conſiderable length of time muſt have been neceſſary for the propagation and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that ſpecies of fiction. The ſimple ſubject of this chronicle, diveſted of its romantic embelliſhments, is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the Welſh princes from the Trojan Brutus to Cadwallader, who reigned in the ſeventh century <note n="u" place="bottom">This notion of their extraction from the Trojans had ſo infatuated the Welſh, that even ſo late as the year 1284, arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop Peckham, in his injunctions to the dioceſe of St. Aſaph, orders the people to abſtain from giving credit to idle dreams and viſions, a ſuperſtition which they had contracted from their belief in thedream of their founder Brutus, in the temple of Diana, concerning his arrival in Britain. The archbiſhop very ſeriouſly adviſes them to boaſt no more of their relation to the conquered and fugitive Trojans, but to glory in the victorious croſs of Chriſt. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. Wilkins, tom. ii. p. 106. edit. 1737. fol.</note>. It muſt
<pb facs="tcp:0373500101:24"/>
be acknowledged, that many European nations were antiently fond of tracing their deſcent from Troy. Hunnibaldus Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, in his Latin hiſtory of France, written in the ſixth cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, beginning with the Trojan war, and ending with Clovis the firſt, aſcribes the origin of the French nation to Francio a ſon of Priam <note n="w" place="bottom">It is among the SCRIPTORES RER. GERMAN. Sim. Schard. tom. i. p. 301. edit. Baſil. 1574. fol. It conſiſts of eighteen books.</note>. So univerſal was this humour, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to ſuch an abſurd exceſs of extravagance, that under the reign of Juſtinian, even the Greeks were ambitious of being thought to be deſcended from the Trojans, their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and notorious enemies. Unleſs we adopt the idea of thoſe antiquaries, who contend that Europe was peopled from Phrygia, it will be hard to diſcover at what period, or from what ſource, ſo ſtrange and improbable a notion could take its riſe, eſpecially among nations unacquainted with hiſtory, and overwhelmed in ignorance. The moſt rational mode of accounting for it, is to ſuppoſe, that the revival of Virgil's Eneid about the ſixth or ſeventh century, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the Trojans as the founders of Rome, the capital of the ſupreme pontiff, and a city on various other accounts in the early ages of chriſtianity highly reverenced and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, occaſioned an emulation in many other European nations of claiming an alliance to the ſame reſpectable origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. The monks and other eccleſiaſtics, the only readers and writers of the age, were likely to broach, and were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in propagating, ſuch an opinion. As the more bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous countries of Europe began to be tinctured with lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature, there was hardly one of them but fell into the faſhion of deducing its original from ſome of the nations moſt cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in the antient books. Thoſe who did not aſpire ſo
<pb facs="tcp:0373500101:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
high as king Priam, or who found that claim preoccupied, boaſted to be deſcended from ſome of the generals of Alexander the Great, from Pruſias king of Bithynia, from the Greeks or the Egyptians. It it not in the mean time quite impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that as moſt of the European nations were provincial to the Romans, thoſe who fancied themſelves to be of Trojan extraction might have imbibed this notion, at leaſt have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a general knowledge of the Trojan ſtory, from their conquerors: more eſpecially the Britons, who continued ſo long under the yoke of Rome <note n="x" place="bottom">See infr. SECT. iii. p. 127, 128.</note>. But as to the ſtory of Brutus in particular, Geoffrey's hero, it may be preſumed that his legend was not contrived, nor the hiſtory of his ſucceſſors invented, till after the ninth century: for Nennius, who lived about the middle of that century, not only ſpeaks of Brutus with great obſcurity and inconſiſtency, but ſeems totally uninformed as to every circumſtance of the Britiſh affairs which preceded Ceſar's invaſion. There are other proofs that this piece could not have exiſted before the ninth century. Alfred's Saxon tranſlation of the Mercian law is mentioned <note n="y" place="bottom">L. iii. c. 13.</note>. Charlemagne's Twelve Peers, and by an ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chroniſm not uncommon in romance, are ſaid to be preſent at king Arthur's magnificent coronation in the city of Caer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon <note n="z" place="bottom">L. ix. c. 12.</note>. It were eaſy to produce inſtances, that this chronicle was undoubtedly framed after the legend of ſaint Urſula, the acts of ſaint Lucius, and the hiſtorical writings of the venerable Bede, had undergone ſome degree of circulation in the world. At the ſame time it contains many paſſages which incline us to determine, that ſome parts of it at leaſt were written after or about the eleventh century. I will not inſiſt on that paſſage, in which the title of legate of the apoſtolic ſee is attributed to Dubricius in the character of primate of Britain; as it appears for obvious reaſons to have been an artful interpolation of the tranſlator, who was an eccleſiaſtic. But I will ſelect other arguments. Canute's foreſt, or Cannock-wood
<pb facs="tcp:0373500101:26"/>
in Staffordſhire occurs; and Canute died in the year 1036 <note n="z" place="bottom">L. vii. c. 4.</note>. At the ideal coronation of king Arthur, juſt mentioned, a tournament is deſcribed as exhibited in its higheſt ſplendor. <q rend="inline">"Many knights, ſays our Armoric fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler, famous for feats of chivalry, were preſent, with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel and arms of the ſame colour and faſhion. They formed a ſpecies of diverſion, in imitation of a fight on horſeback, and the ladies being placed on the walls of the caſtles, darted amorous glances on the combatants. None of theſe ladies eſteemed any knight worthy of her love, but ſuch as had given proof of his gallantry in three ſeveral encounters. Thus the valour of the men encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged chaſtity in the women, and the attention of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men proved an incentive to the ſoldier's bravery <note n="a" place="bottom">L. ix. c. 12.</note>."</q> Here is the practice of chivalry under the combined ideas of love and military proweſs, as they ſeem to have ſubſiſted after the feudal conſtitution had acquired greater degrees not only of ſtability but of ſplendor and refinement <note n="b" place="bottom">Pitts mentions an anonymous writer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of EREMITA BRITANNUS, who ſtudied hiſtory and aſtronomy, and flouriſhed about the year 720. He wrote, beſides a book in an unknown language, entitled, <hi>Sanchem Graal, De Rege Arthuro et rebus geſtis ejus.</hi> Lib. i. <hi>De Menſa rotun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da et</hi> STRENUIS EQUITIBUS, lib. i. See Pitſ. p. 122. Bale, x. 21. Uſſer. Primord. p. 17. This ſubject could not have been treated by ſo early a writer.</note>. And although a ſpecies of tournament was exhibited in France at the recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation of the ſons of Lewis the feeble, in the cloſe of the ninth century, and at the beginning of the tenth, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation of the emperor Henry was ſolemnized with mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial entertainments, in which many parties were introduced fighting on horſeback; yet it was long afterwards that theſe games were accompanied with the peculiar formalities, and ceremonious uſages, here deſcribed <note n="c" place="bottom">
                  <p>See infr. SECT. iii. p. 109. xii. p. 347, 348. I will here produce, from that learned orientaliſt M. D'Herbelot, ſome curious traites of Arabian knight-errantry, which the reader may apply to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of this Diſſertation as he pleaſes.</p>

               </note>. In the mean time, we
<pb facs="tcp:0373500101:27"/>
cannot anſwer for the innovations of a tranſlator in ſuch a deſcription. The burial of Hengiſt, the Saxon chief, who is ſaid to have been interred not after the <hi>pagan</hi> faſhion, as Geoffrey renders the words of the original, but after the <hi>manner of the</hi> SOLDANS, is partly an argument that our ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance was compoſed about the time of the cruſades. It was not till thoſe memorable campaigns of miſtaken devotion had infatuated the weſtern world, that the ſoldans or ſultans of Babylon, of Egypt, of Iconium, and other eaſtern kingdoms, became familiar in Europe. Not that the notion of this piece being written ſo late as the cruſades in the leaſt invalidates the doctrine delivered in this diſcourſe. Not even if we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that Geoffrey of Monmouth was its original compoſer. That notion rather tends to confirm and eſtabliſh my ſyſtem. On the whole we may venture to affirm, that this chronicle, ſuppoſed to contain the ideas of the Welſh bards, entirely conſiſts of Arabian inventions. And, in this view, no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is made whether it was compiled about the tenth century, at which time, if not before, the Arabians from their ſettlement in Spain muſt have communicated their ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic fables to other parts of Europe, eſpecially to the French; or whether it firſt appeared in the eleventh cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, after the cruſades had multiplied theſe fables to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive degree, and made them univerſally popular. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the general caſt of the inventions contained in this romance is alone ſufficient to point out the ſource from whence they were derived, yet I chuſe to prove to a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration what is here advanced, by producing and examining ſome particular paſſages.</p>
            <p>The books of the Arabians and Perſians abound with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant traditions about the giants Gog and Magog. Theſe they call Jagiouge and Magiouge; and the Caucaſian wall,

It was an old tradition among the Tartars, that the people of Jajgioue and Majiouge were perpetually endeavouring to make a paſſage through this fortreſs; but that they would not ſucceed in their attempt till the day of judgment. See Hiſt. Geneal. des Tartars, d'Abulgazi Bahadut Khân. p. 43. About the year 808, the caliph Al Amin having heard wonderful reports concerning this wall or barrier, ſent his interpreter Salam, with a guard of fifty men, to view it. After a dangerous journey of near two months, Salam and his party arrived in a deſolated country, where they beheld the ruins of many cities deſtroyed by the people of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jiouge and Majiouge. In ſix days more they reached the caſtles near the mountain Kokaiya or Caucaſus. This mountain is inacceſſibly ſteep, perpetually covered with ſnows and thick clouds, and encompaſſes the country of Jagiouge and Magiouge, which is full of cultivated fields and cities.

The valves, lintels, threſhold, bolts, lock and key, are all repreſented of proportionable mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude. The governor of the caſtle above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, once in every week mounted on horſeback with ten others on horſeback, comes to this gate, and ſtriking it three times with a hammer weighing five pounds, and then liſtening, hears a murmuring noiſe from within. This noiſe is ſuppoſed to proceed from the Jagiouge and Magiouge confined there. Salam was told that they often appeared on the battlements of the bulwark.

It ſeems at firſt ſight to be built of ſtone: but it conſiſts of petrified earth, ſand, and ſhells, which compoſe a ſubſtance of great ſolidity. It has been chiefly deſtroyed by the neighbouring inhabitants, for the ſake of its materials: and moſt of the adjacent towns and villages are built out of its ruins.

The firſt and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous hiſtory of the eaſtern nations, will perhaps be found to begin with the exploits of this Grecian hero.</note>. One of the moſt formidable giants, according to our Armorican romance,
<pb facs="tcp:0373500101:29"/>
which oppoſed the landing of Brutus in Britain, was Goemagot. He was twelve cubits high, and would unroot an oak as eaſily as an hazel wand: but after a moſt obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate encounter with Corineus, he was tumbled into the ſea from the ſummit of a ſteep cliff on the rocky ſhores of Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall, and daſhed in pieces againſt the huge crags of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clivity. The place where he fell, adds our hiſtorian, taking its name from the giant's fall, is called LAM-GOEMAGOT, or GOEMAGOT'S LEAP, to this day <note n="f" place="bottom">Lib. i. c. 16.</note>. A no leſs monſtrous giant, whom king Arthur ſlew on Saint Michael's Mount in Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall, is ſaid by this fabler to have come from Spain. Here the origin of theſe ſtories is evidently betrayed <note n="g" place="bottom">L. x. c. 3.</note>. The Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians, or Saracens, as I have hinted above, had conquered Spain, and were ſettled there. Arthur having killed this redoubted giant, declares, that he had combated with none of equal ſtrength and proweſs, ſince he overcame the mighty giant Ritho, on the mountain Arabius, who had made himſelf a robe of the beards of the kings whom he had killed. This tale is in Spenſer's Faerie Queene. A magician brought from Spain is called to the aſſiſtance of Edwin, a prince of Northumberland <note n="h" place="bottom">The Cumbrian and Northumbrian Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, as powerful opponents of the Saxons, were ſtrongly allied to the Welſh and Corniſh.</note>, educated under Solomon king of the Armoricans <note n="i" place="bottom">Lib. xii. c. 1, 4, 5, 6.</note>. In the prophecy of Merlin, delivered to Vorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gern after the battle of the dragons, forged perhaps by the tranſlator Geoffrey, yet apparently in the ſpirit and manner of the reſt, we have the Arabians named, and their ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Spain and Africa. <q rend="inline">"From Conau ſhall come forth a wild boar, whoſe tuſks ſhall deſtroy the oaks of the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of France.

In a battle which Arthur fights againſt the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, ſome of the principal leaders in the Roman army are Alifantinam king of Spain, Pandraſus king of Egypt, Boccus king of the Medes, Evander king of Syria, Micipſa king of Babylon, and a duke of Phrygia <note n="m" place="bottom">Lib. x. c. 5. 8. 10.</note>. It is obvious to ſuppoſe how theſe countries became ſo familiar to the bard of our chronicle. The old fictions about Stonehenge were derived from the ſame inexhauſtible ſource of extravagant imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. We are told in this romance, that the giants con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed the ſtones which compoſe this miraculous monument from the fartheſt coaſts of Africa. Every one of theſe ſtones is ſuppoſed to be myſtical, and to contain a medicinal virtue: an idea drawn from the medical ſkill of the Arabians <note n="n" place="bottom">See infr. SECT. i. p. 10. And SECT. xiii. p. 378. infr.</note>, and more particularly from the Arabian doctrine of attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting healing qualities, and other occult properties, to ſtones <note n="o" place="bottom">This chronicle was evidently compiled to do honour to the Britons and their affairs, and eſpecially in oppoſition to the Saxons. Now the importance with which theſe romancers ſeem to ſpeak of Stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henge, and the many beautiful fictions with which they have been ſo ſtudious to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſh its origin, and to aggrandiſe its hiſtory, appear to me ſtrongly to favour the hypotheſis, that Stonehenge is a Britiſh monument; and indeed to prove, that it was really erected in memory of the three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Britiſh nobles maſſacred by the Saxon Hengiſt. See SECT. ii. infr. p. 52. No DRUIDICAL monument, of which ſo many remains were common, engaged their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention or intereſted them ſo much, as this NATIONAL memorial appears to have done.</note>. Merlin's transformation of Uther into Gorlois, and of Ulfin into Bricel, by the power of ſome medical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, is a ſpecies of Arabian magic, which profeſſed to work the moſt wonderful deceptions of this kind, and is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned at large hereafter, in tracing the inventions of Chaucer's poetry.

            <p>Arthur and Charlemagne are the firſt and original heroes of romance. And as Geoffrey's hiſtory is the grand repoſitory of the acts of Arthur, ſo a fabulous hiſtory aſcribed to Turpin is the ground work of all the chimerical legends which have been related concerning the conqueſts of Charlemagne and his twelve peers. Its ſubject is the expulſion of the Saracens
<pb facs="tcp:0373500101:32"/>
from Spain: and it is filled with fictions evidently cogenial with thoſe which characteriſe Geoffrey's hiſtory <note n="w" place="bottom">I will mention only one among many others. The chriſtians under Charlemagne are ſaid to have found in Spain a golden idol, or image of Mahomet, as high as a bird can fly. It was framed by Mahomet himſelf of the pureſt metal, who by his knowledge in necromancy had ſealed up within it a legion of diabolical ſpirits. It held in its hand a prodigious club; and the Saracens had a prophetic tradition, that this club ſhould fall from the hand of the image in that year when a certain king ſhould be born in France, &amp;c.

            <p>Some ſuppoſe, as I have hinted above, this romance to have been written by Turpin, a monk of the eighth century; who, for his knowledge of the Latin language, his ſanctity, and gallant exploits againſt the Spaniſh Saracens, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the archbiſhoprick of Rheims by Charlemagne. Others believe it to have been forged under archbiſhop Turpin's name about that time.

That is, on the recent pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of this fabulous hiſtory of Charlemagne. Hiſtorical evidence concurs with numerous internal arguments to prove, that it muſt have been compiled after the cruſades.

I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late one from that lively picture of the Spaniards, RELATION DU VOYAGE D'ES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PAGNE, by Madamoiſelle Danois. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the antient caſtle of Toledo, they ſay, there was a vaſt cavern whoſe entrance was ſtrongly barricadoed. It was univerſally believed, that if any perſon entered this cavern, the moſt fatal diſaſters would hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to the Spaniards. Thus it remained cloſely ſhut and unentered for many ages. At length king Roderigo, having leſs cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity but more courage and curioſity than his anceſtors, commanded this formidable receſs to be opened. At entering, he began to ſuſpect the traditions of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be true: a terrible tempeſt aroſe, and all the elements ſeemed united to embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſs him. Nevertheleſs, he ventured for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards into the cave, where he diſcerned by the light of his torches certain figures on ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of men, whoſe habiliments and arms were ſtrange and uncouth. One of them had a ſword of ſhining braſs, on which it was written in Arabic characters, that the time approached when the Spaniſh nation ſhould be deſtroyed, and that it would not be long before the warriors, whoſe images were placed there, ſhould arrive in Spain. The writer adds, <q rend="inline">"Je n'ai jamais été en aucun endroit, où l'on faſſe PLUS DE CAS des CONTES FABULEUX qu'en Eſpagne."</q>

And, by the way, from the tranſlator's declaration, that there was a great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety in tranſlating Latin proſe into verſe, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that at the commencement of the thirteenth century the French generally made their tranſlations into verſe.</p>
            <p>In theſe two fabulous chronicles the foundations of romance ſeem to be laid. The principal characters, the leading ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and the fundamental fictions, which have ſupplied ſuch ample matter to this ſingular ſpecies of compoſition, are here firſt diſplayed. And although the long continuance of the cruſades imported innumerable inventions of a ſimilar complexion, and ſubſtituted the atchievements of new cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions and the wonders of other countries, yet the tales of Arthur and of Charlemagne, diverſified indeed, or enlarged with additional embelliſhments, ſtill continued to prevail, and to be the favourite topics: and this, partly from their early popularity, partly from the quantity and the beauty of the fictions with which they were at firſt ſupported, and eſpecially becauſe the deſign of the cruſades had made thoſe ſubjects ſo faſhionable in which chriſtians fought with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels. In a word, theſe volumes are the firſt ſpecimens
<pb facs="tcp:0373500101:36"/>
extant in this mode of writing. No European hiſtory before theſe has mentioned giants, enchanters, dragons, and the like monſtrous and arbitrary fictions. And the reaſon is obvious: they were written at a time when a new and unnatural mode of thinking took place in Europe, intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by our communication with the eaſt.</p>
            <p>Hitherto I have conſidered the Saracens either at their immigration into Spain about the ninth century, or at the time of the cruſades, as the firſt authors of romantic fabling among the Europeans. But a late ingenious critic has advanced an hypotheſis, which aſſigns a new ſource, and a much earlier date, to theſe fictions. I will cite his opinion of this matter in his own words. <q rend="inline">"Our old romances of chivalry may be derived in a LINEAL DES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CENT from the antient hiſtorical ſongs of the Gothic bards and ſcalds.—Many of thoſe ſongs are ſtill preſerved in the north, which exhibit all the ſeeds of chivalry before it became a ſolemn inſtitution.—Even the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon arbitrary fictions of romance were moſt of them familiar to the antient ſcalds of the north, long before the time of the cruſades. They believed the exiſtence of giants and dwarfs, they had ſome notion of fairies, they were ſtrongly poſſeſſed with the belief of ſpells and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment, and were fond of inventing combats with dragons and monſters <note n="m" place="bottom">Percy, on, ANTIENT METR. ROM. i. p. 3. 4. edit. 1767.</note>."</q> Monſieur Mallet, a very able and elegant inquirer into the genius and antiquities of the northern nations, mantains the ſame doctrine. He ſeems to think, that many of the opinions and practices of the Goths, however obſolete, ſtill obſcurely ſubſiſt. He adds, <q rend="inline">"May we not rank among theſe, for example, that love and admiration for the profeſſion of arms which prevailed among our anceſtors even to fanaticiſm, and as it were through ſyſtem, and brave from a point of honour?—
<pb facs="tcp:0373500101:37"/>
Can we not explain from the Gothic religion, how judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary combats, and proofs by the ordeal, to the aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of poſterity, were admitted by the legiſlature of all Europe <note n="n" place="bottom">For the judiciary combats, as alſo for common athletic exerciſes, they formed an amphitheatrical circus of rude ſtones. <q rend="inline">"Quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam [ſaxa] CIRCOS claudebant, in qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus gigantes et pugiles DUELLO ſtrenue decertabant."</q>

                     <bibl>p. 65.</bibl> It is remarkable, that circs of the ſame ſort are ſtill to be ſeen in Cornwall, ſo famous at this day for the athletic art: in which alſo they ſometimes exhibited their ſcriptural interludes. See infr. SECT. vi. p. 237. Frotho the Great, king of Denmark, in the firſt century, is ſaid to have been the firſt who commanded all controverſies to be decided by the ſword. Worm. p. 68. In favour of this barbarous inſtitution it ought to be remembered, that the practice of thus marking out the place of battle muſt have prevented much blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and ſaved many innocent lives: for if either combatant was by any accident forced out of the circus, he was to loſe his cauſe, or to pay three marks of pure ſilver as a redemption for his life. Worm. p. 68, 69. In the year 987, the ordeal was ſubſtituted in Denmark inſtead of the duel; a mode of deciſion, at leaſt in a political ſenſe, leſs abſurd, as it promoted military ſkill.</note>: and how, even to the preſent age, the people are ſtill infatuated with a belief of the power of magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, witches, ſpirits, and genii, concealed under the earth or in the waters?—Do we not diſcover in theſe religious opinions, that ſource of the marvellous with which our anceſtors filled their romances; in which we ſee dwarfs and giants, fairies and demons," &amp;c <note n="o" place="bottom">Mallet, Introduction a l' Hiſtoire de Dannemarc, &amp;c. tom. ii. p. 9.</note>.</q>  And in another place. <q rend="inline">"The fortreſſes of the Goths were only rude caſtles ſituated on the ſummits of rocks, and rendered inacceſſible by thick misſhapen walls. As theſe walls ran winding round the caſtles, they often called them by a name which ſignified SERPENTS or DRAGONS; and in theſe they uſually ſecured the women and young virgins of diſtinction, who were ſeldom ſafe at a time when ſo many enterpriſing heroes were rambling up and down in ſearch of adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. It was this cuſtom which gave occaſion to antient romancers, who knew not how to deſcribe any thing ſimply, to invent ſo many fables concerning princeſſes of great beauty guarded by dragons, and afterwards delivered by invincible champions <note n="p" place="bottom">Ib. ch. ix. p. 243. tom. ii.</note>.</q>

            <p>It is notorious, that many traces of oriental uſages are found amongſt all the European nations during their pagan ſtate; and this phenomenon is rationally reſolved, on the ſuppoſition that all Europe was originally peopled from the eaſt. But as the reſemblance which the pagan Scandina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vians bore to the eaſtern nations in manners, monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, opinions, and practices, is ſo very perceptible and apparent, an inference ariſes, that their migration from the eaſt muſt have happened at a period by many ages more recent, and therefore moſt probably about the time ſpecified by their hiſtorians. In the mean time we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that a diſtinction is to be made between this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Odin's Goths, who formed a ſettlement in Scandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>navia, and thoſe innumerable armies of barbarous adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, who ſome centuries afterwards, diſtinguiſhed by the ſame name, at different periods overwhelmed Europe, and at length extinguiſhed the Roman empire.</p>
            <p>When we conſider the rapid conqueſts of the nations which may be comprehended under the common name of Scythians, and not only thoſe conducted by Odin, but by Attila, Theodoric, and Genſeric, we cannot aſcribe ſuch ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes to brutal courage only. To ſay that ſome of theſe irreſiſtible conquerors made war on a luxurious, effeminate, and enervated people, is a plauſible and eaſy mode of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting for their conqueſts: but this reaſon will not ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with equal force in the hiſtories of Genghizcan and

Tamerlane, who deſtroyed mighty empires founded on arms and military diſcipline, and who baffled the efforts of the ableſt leaders. Their ſcience and genius in war, ſuch as it then was, cannot therefore be doubted: that they were not deficient in the arts of peace, I have already hinted, and now proceed to produce more particular proofs. Innumerable and very fundamental errors have crept into our reaſonings and ſyſtems about ſavage life, reſulting merely from thoſe ſtrong and undiſtinguiſhing notions of barbariſm, which our prejudices have haſtily formed concerning the character of all rude nations <note n="i" place="bottom">See this argument purſued in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing DISSERTATION.</note>.</p>
            <p>Among other arts which Odin's Goths planted in Scandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>navia, their ſkill in poetry, to which they were addicted in a peculiar manner, and which they cultivated with a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful enthuſiaſm, ſeems to be moſt worthy our regard, and eſpecially in our preſent inquiry.</p>
            <p>As the principal heroes of their expedition into the north were honourably diſtinguiſhed from the Europeans, or ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Scandinavians, under the name of Asae, or Aſiatics, ſo the verſes, or language, of this people, were denominated ASAMAL, or ASIATIC ſpeech <note n="k" place="bottom">

Their poetry contained not only the praiſes of their heroes, but their popular traditions and their religious rites; and was filled with thoſe fictions which the moſt exaggerated pagan ſuperſtition would natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally implant in the wild imaginations of an Aſiatic people. And from this principle alone, I mean of their Aſiatic origin, ſome critics would at once account for a certain capricious ſpirit of extravagance, and thoſe bold eccentric conceptions, which ſo ſtrongly diſtinguiſh the old northern poetry <note n="l" place="bottom">A moſt ingenious critic obſerves, that <q rend="inline">"what we have been long accuſtomed to call the ORIENTAL VEIN of poetry, becauſe ſome of the EARLIEST poetical productions have come to us from the eaſt, is probably no more ORIENTAL than OCCIDENTAL."</q>

A propenſity to this mode of expreſſion is neceſſarily occaſioned by the poverty of their language, which obliges them frequently to ſubſtitute ſimilitudes and circumlocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: it ariſes in great meaſure from feelings undiſguiſed and unreſtrained by cuſtom or art, and from the genuine efforts of nature working more at large in uncultivated minds. In the infancy of ſociety, the paſſions and the imagination are alike uncontrouled. But another cauſe ſeems to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred in producing the effect here mentioned. When ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious terms and phraſes evidently occurred, the Runic poets are fond of departing from the common and eſtabliſhed dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They appear to uſe circumlocution and compariſons not as a matter of neceſſity, but of choice and ſkill: nor are theſe metaphorical colourings ſo much the reſult of want of words, as of warmth of fancy <note n="n" place="bottom">In a ſtrict geographical ſenſe, the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal country of theſe Aſiatic Goths might not be ſo ſituated as phyſically to have produced theſe effects. Yet it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that intercourſe and vicinity are in this caſe ſometimes equivalent to climate. The Perſian traditions and ſuperſtitions were current even in the northern parts of Tartary. Georgia, however, may be fairly conſidered as a part of Perſia. It is equal in fertility to any of the eaſtern Turkiſh provinces in Aſia. It affords the richeſt wines, and other luxuries of life, in the greateſt abundance. The moſt beautiful virgins for the ſeraglio are fetched from this province. In the mean time, thus much at leaſt may be ſaid of a warm climate, excluſive of its ſuppoſed immediate phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal influence on the human mind and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament. It exhibits all the productions of nature in their higheſt perfection and beauty: while the exceſſive heat of the ſun, and the fewer incitements to labour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, diſpoſe the inhabitants to indolence, and to living much abroad in ſcenes of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0373500101:45"/>
Their warmth of fancy, however, if ſuppoſed to have proceeded from the principles above ſuggeſted, in a few ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations after this migration into Scandinavia, muſt have loſt much of its natural heat and genuine force. Yet ideas and ſentiments, eſpecially of this ſort, once imbibed, are long remembered and retained, in ſavage life. Their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, among other cauſes, might have contributed to keep this ſpirit alive; and to preſerve their original ſtock of images, and native mode of expreſſion, unchanged and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated by climate or country. In the mean time we may ſuppoſe, that the new ſituation of theſe people in Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinavia, might have added a darker ſhade and a more ſavage complexion to their former fictions and ſuperſtitions; and that the formidable objects of nature to which they became familiariſed in thoſe northern ſolitudes, the piny precipices, the frozen mountains, and the gloomy foreſts, acted on their imaginations, and gave a tincture of horror to their imagery.</p>
            <p>A ſkill in poetry ſeems in ſome meaſure to have been a national ſcience among the Scandinavians, and to have been familiar to almoſt every order and degree.

This order of men, as we ſhall ſee more diſtinctly below, was held in the higheſt honour and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: they received the moſt liberal rewards for their verſes, attended the feſtivals of heroic chiefs, accompanied them in battle, and celebrated their victories <note n="p" place="bottom">The Sogdians were a people who lived eaſtward of the Caſpian ſea, not far from the country of Odin's Goths.

            <p>Theſe Scandinavian bards appear to have been eſteemed and entertained in other countries beſides their own, and by that means to have probably communicated their fictions to various parts of Europe. I will give my reaſons for this ſuppoſition.</p>
            <p>In the early ages of Europe, before many regular govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments took place, revolutions, emigrations, and invaſions, were frequent and almoſt univerſal. Nations were alternately
<pb facs="tcp:0373500101:47"/>
deſtroyed or formed; and the want of political ſecurity expoſed the inhabitants of every country to a ſtate of eternal fluctuation. That Britain was originally peopled from Gaul, a nation of the Celts, is allowed: but that many colonies from the northern parts of Europe were afterwards ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively planted in Britain and the neighbouring iſlands, is an hypotheſis equally rational, and not altogether deſtitute of hiſtorical evidence. Nor was any nation more likely than the Scandinavian Goths, I mean in their early periods, to make deſcents on Britain. They poſſeſſed the ſpirit of adventure in an eminent degree. They were habituated to dangerous enterpriſes. They were acquainted with diſtant coaſts, exerciſed in navigation, and fond of making expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, in hopes of conqueſt, and in ſearch of new acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions. As to Scotland and Ireland, there is the higheſt probability, that the Scutes, who conquered both thoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and poſſeſſed them under the names of Albin Scutes and Irin Scutes, were a people of Norway. The Caledo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians are expreſsly called by many judicious antiquaries a Scandinavian colony. The names of places and perſons, over all that part of Scotland which the Picts inhabited, are of Scandinavian extraction. A ſimple catalogue of them only, would immediately convince us, that they are not of Celtic, or Britiſh, origin. Flaherty reports it as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived opinion, and a general doctrine, that the Picts mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grated into Britain and Ireland from Scandinavia <note n="q" place="bottom">

            <p>In theſe expeditions, the northern emigrants, as we ſhall prove more particularly below, were undoubtedly attended by their ſcalds or poets. Yet even in times of peace, and without the ſuppoſition of conqueſt or invaſion, the Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinavian ſcalds might have been well known in the Britiſh iſlands. Poſſeſſed of a ſpecious and pleaſing talent, they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented the courts of the Britiſh, Scottiſh, and Iriſh chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. They were itinerants by their inſtitution, and made voyages, out of curioſity, or in queſt of rewards, to thoſe iſlands or coaſts which lay within the circle of their mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time knowledge. By theſe means, they eſtabliſhed an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, rendered their profeſſion popular, propagated their art, and circulated their fictions, in other countries, and at a diſtance from home.

It was a conſtant old Britiſh tradition, that king Arthur conquered Ireland, Gothland, Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, and Norway. See Galfrid. Monum. ix. 11. Rob. of Glouc. ed. Hearne, p. 180. 182. What is ſaid in the text muſt have greatly facilitated the Saxon and Daniſh conqueſts in England. The works of the genuine Caedmon are written in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the antient Angles, who were nearly connected with the Jutes. Hence that language reſembled the antient Daniſh, as appears from paſſages of Caedmon cited by Wanley. Hence alſo it happened, that the later Dano-Saxonic dialect, in which Junius's POETICAL PARAPHRASE OF GENESIS was written, is likewiſe ſo very ſimilar to the language of the antient Angles, who ſettled in the more northern parts of England. And in this dialect, which indeed prevailed in ſome degree almoſt over all England, many other poems are compoſed, mentioned likewiſe in Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley's Catalogue. It is the conſtant doctrine of the Daniſh hiſtorians, that the Danes and Angles, whoſe ſucceſſors gave the name to this iſland, had the ſame origin.</note>. Indeed it may be naturally concluded from theſe ſuggeſtions, that the Scandinavian tongue became fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar in the Britiſh iſlands by the ſongs of the ſcalds: unleſs it be rather preſumed, that a previous knowledge of that tongue in Britain was the means of facilitating the admiſſion of thoſe poets, and preparing the way for their reception.</p>
            <p>And here it will be much to our preſent argument to obſerve, that ſome of the old Gothic and Scandinavian ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions are to this day retained in the Engliſh language.

But I will give a literal Engliſh tranſlation of this poem, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be well underſtood without premiſing its occaſion. In the year 938, Anlaff, a pagan king of the Hybernians and the adjacent iſles, invited by Conſtantine king of the Scots, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the river Abi or Humber with a ſtrong fleet. Our Saxon king Athelſtan, and his brother Eadmund Clito, met them with a numerous army, near a place called Brunen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh; and after a moſt obſtinate and bloody reſiſtance, drove them back to their ſhips. The battle laſted from day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>break till the evening. On the ſide of Anlaff were ſlain ſix petty kings, and ſeven chiefs or generals. <q>"King Adelſtan, the glory of leaders, the giver of gold chains to his nobles, and his brother Eadmund, both ſhining with the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a long train of anceſtors, ſtruck [the adverſary] in war; at Brunenburgh, with the edge of the ſword, they clove the wall of ſhields. The high banners fell. The earls of the departed Edward fell; for it was born within them, even from the loins of their kindred, to defend the treaſures and the houſes of their country, and
<pb facs="tcp:0373500101:53"/>
their gifts, againſt the hatred of ſtrangers. The nation of the Scots, and the fatal inhabitants of ſhips, fell. The hills reſounded, and the armed men were covered with ſweat. From the time the ſun, the king of ſtars, the torch of the eternal one, roſe chearful above the hills, till he returned to his habitation. There lay many of the northern men, pierced with lances; they lay wounded, with their ſhields pierced through: and alſo the Scots, the hateful harveſt of battle. The choſen bands of the Weſt-Saxons, going out to battle, preſſed on the ſteps of the deteſted nations, and ſlew their flying rear with ſharp and bloody ſwords. The ſoft effeminate men yielded up their ſpears. The Mercians did not fear or fly the rough game of the hand. There was no ſafety to them, who ſought the land with Anlaff in the boſom of the ſhip, to die in fight. Five youthful kings fell in the place of fight, ſlain with ſwords; and ſeven captains of Anlaff, with the innumerable army of Scottiſh mariners: there the lord of the Normans [Northern-men] was chaſed; and their army, now made ſmall, was driven to the prow of the ſhip. The ſhip ſounded with the waves; and the king, marching into the yellow ſea, eſcaped alive. And ſo it was, the wiſe northern king Conſtantine, a veteran chief, returning by flight to his own army, bowed down in the camp, left his own ſon worn out with wounds in the place of ſlaughter; in vain did he lament his earls, in vain his loſt friends. Nor leſs did Anlaff, the yellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haired leader, the battle-ax of ſlaughter, a youth in war, but an old man in underſtanding, boaſt himſelf a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror in fight, when the darts flew againſt Edward's earls, and their banners met. Then thoſe northern ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, covered with ſhame, the ſad refuſe of darts in the reſounding whirlpool of Humber, departed in their ſhips with rudders, to ſeek through the deep the Iriſh city and their own land. While both the brothers, the
<pb facs="tcp:0373500101:54"/>
king and Clito, lamenting even their own victory, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther returned home; leaving behind them the fleſh-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring raven, the dark-blue toad greedy of ſlaughter, the black crow with horny bill, and the hoarſe toad, the eagle a companion of battles with the devouring kite, and that brindled ſavage beaſt the wolf of the wood, to be glutted with the white food of the ſlain. Never was ſo great a ſlaughter in this iſland, ſince the Angles and Saxons, the fierce beginners of war, coming hither from the eaſt, and ſeeking Britain through the wide ſea, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Britons excelling in honour, and gained poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of their land <note n="m" place="bottom">The original was firſt printed by Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loc in the Saxon Chronicle, p. 555.

            <p>This piece, and many other Saxon odes and ſongs now remaining, are written in a metre much reſembling that of the ſcaldic dialogue at the tomb of Angantyr, which has been beautifully tranſlated into Engliſh, in the true ſpirit of the original, and in a genuine ſtrain of poetry, by Gray. The extemporaneous effuſions of the glowing bard ſeem na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally to have fallen into this meaſure, and it was probably more eaſily ſuited to the voice or harp. Their verſification for the moſt part ſeems to have been that of the Runic poetry.</p>
            <p>As literature, the certain attendant, as it is the parent, of true religion and civility, gained ground among the Saxons, poetry no longer remained a ſeparate ſcience, and the profeſſion of bard ſeems gradually to have declined among them: I mean the bard under thoſe appropriated characteriſtics, and that peculiar appointment, which he ſuſtained among the Scandinavian pagans. Yet their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional love of verſe and muſic ſtill ſo ſtrongly predominated, that in the place of their old ſcalders a new rank of poets aroſe, called GLEEMEN or Harpers <note n="n" place="bottom">
                  <p>GLEEMAN anſwers to the Latin JO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CULATOR.

riſe to the order of Engliſh Minſtrels, who flouriſhed till the ſixteenth century.</p>
            <p>And here I ſtop to point out one of the principal reaſons, why the Scandinavian bards have tranſmitted to modern times ſo much more of their native poetry, than the reſt of their ſouthern neighbours. It is true, that the inhabitants of Sweden, Denmark, and Norway, whether or no from their Aſiatic origin, from their poverty which compelled them to ſeek fortunes at foreign courts by the exerciſe of a popular art, from the ſucceſs of their bards, the nature of their republican government, or their habits of unſettled life, were more given to verſe than any other Gothic, or even Celtic, tribe. But this is not all: they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained pagans, and retained their original manners, much longer than any of their Gothic kindred. They were not completely converted to chriſtianity till the tenth century <note n="o" place="bottom">See biſhop Lloyd's Hiſt. Account of Church Government in Great Britain, &amp;c. chap. i. §. 11. pag. 4to. Lond. 1684. And Crymog. Arngrim. L. i. cap. 10. p. 104.</note>. Hence, under the concurrence however of ſome of the cauſes juſt mentioned, their ſcaldic profeſſion acquired greater degrees of ſtrength and of maturity: and from an uninterrupted poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion through many ages of the moſt romantic religious ſuperſtitions, and the preſervation of thoſe rough manners which are ſo favourable to the poetical ſpirit, was enabled to produce, not only more genuine, but more numerous, compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions. True religion would have checked the impetuoſity of their paſſions, ſuppreſſed their wild exertions of fancy, and baniſhed that ſtriking train of imagery, which their
<pb facs="tcp:0373500101:56"/>
poetry derived from a barbarous theology. This circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance alſo ſuggeſts to our conſideration, thoſe ſuperior advantages and opportunities ariſing from leiſure and length of time, which they enjoyed above others, of circulating their poetry far and wide, of giving a general currency to their mode of fabling, of rendering their ſkill in verſifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more univerſally and familiarly known, and a more conſpicuous and popular object of admiration or imitation to the neighbouring countries. Hence too it has happened, that modern times have not only attained much fuller information concerning their hiſtorical tranſactions, but are ſo intimately acquainted with the peculiarities of their character.</p>
            <p>It is probable, that the Daniſh invaſions produced a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable alteration in the manners of our Anglo-Saxon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors. Although their connections with England were tranſient and interrupted, and on the whole ſcarcely laſted two hundred years, yet many of the Daniſh cuſtoms began to prevail among the inhabitants, which ſeem to have given a new turn to their temper and genius. The Daniſh faſhion of exceſſive drinking, for inſtance, a vice almoſt natural to the northern nations, became ſo general among the Anglo-Saxons, that it was found neceſſary to reſtrain ſo pernicious and contagious a practice by a particular ſtatute <note n="p" place="bottom">See Lambarde's Archaionom. And Bartholin. ii. c. xii. p. 542.</note>. Hence it ſeems likely, that ſo popular an entertainment as their poetry gained ground; eſpecially if we conſider, that in their expeditions againſt England they were of courſe attended by many northern ſcalds, who conſtantly made a part of their military retinue, and whoſe language was underſtood by the Saxons. Rogwald, lord of the Orcades, who was alſo himſelf a poet, going on an expedition into Paleſtine, carried with him two Iſlandic bards <note n="q" place="bottom">

An action is carried on by a ſet of the moſt aweful ideal perſonages, finely imagined. The goddeſſes of battle, Odin, his ſons Hermode and Brago, and the ſpectre of the deceaſed king, are all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced, ſpeaking and acting as in a drama.

               </note>, king of Norway, was compoſed on a battle in which that prince, with eight of his brothers fell, by the ſcald Eyvynd; who for his ſuperior ſkill in poetry was called the CROSS of POETS, and fought in the battle which he celebrated. Hacon earl of Norway was accompanied by five celebrated bards in the battle of Jomſburgh: and we are told, that each of them ſung an ode to animate the ſoldiers before the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement began <note n="s" place="bottom">Bartholin. p. 172.</note>. They appear to have been regularly brought into action. Olave, a king of Norway, when his army was prepared for the onſet, placed three ſcalds about
<pb facs="tcp:0373500101:58"/>
him, and exclaimed aloud, <q rend="inline">"You ſhall not only record in your verſes what you have HEARD, but what you have SEEN."</q> They each delivered an ode on the ſpot <note n="t" place="bottom">Olaf. Sag. apud Verel. ad HERV. SAG. p. 178. Bartholin. p. 172.</note>. Theſe northern chiefs appear to have ſo frequently hazarded their lives with ſuch amazing intrepidity, merely in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of meriting a panegyric from their poets, the judges, and the ſpectators of their gallant behaviour. That ſcalds were common in the Daniſh armies when they invaded England, appears from a ſtratagem of Alfred; who, availing himſelf of his ſkill in oral poetry and playing on the harp, entered the Daniſh camp habited in that character, and procured a hoſpitable reception. This was in the year 878 <note n="u" place="bottom">Ingulph: Hiſt. p. 869. Malmeſb. ii. c. 4. p. 43.</note>. Anlaff, a Daniſh king, uſed the ſame diſguiſe for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connoitring the camp of our Saxon monarch Athelſtan: tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſtation near Athelſtan's pavilion, he entertained the king and his chiefs with his verſes and muſic, and was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed with an honourable reward <note n="w" place="bottom">Malmeſb. ii. 6. I am aware, that the truth of both theſe anecdotes reſpecting Alfred and Anlaff has been controverted. But no ſufficient argument has yet been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for pronouncing them ſpurious, or even ſuſpicious. See an ingenious Diſſerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the ARCHAEOLOGIA, vol. ii. p. 100. ſeq. A. D. 1773. 4to.</note>. As Anlaff's dialect muſt have diſcovered him to have been a Dane; here is a proof, of what I ſhall bring more, that the Saxons, even in the midſt of mutual hoſtilities, treated the Daniſh ſcalds with favour and reſpect. That the Iſlandic bards were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in England during the Daniſh invaſions, there are numerous proofs. Egill, a celebrated Iſlandic poet, having murthered the ſon and many of the friends of Eric Blodoxe, king of Denmark or Norway, then reſiding in Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland, and which he had juſt conquered, procured a pardon by ſinging before the king, at the command of his queen Gunhilde, an extemporaneous ode <note n="x" place="bottom">See Crymogr. Angrim. Jon. Lib. ii. pag. 125 edit. 1609.</note>. Egill compliments the king, who probably was his patron, with the appellation of the
<pb facs="tcp:0373500101:59"/>
Engliſh chief. <q rend="inline">"I offer my freight to the king. I owe a poem for my ranſom. I preſent to the ENGLISH CHIEF the mead of Odin <note n="y" place="bottom">See Ol. Worm. Lit. Run. p. 227. 195. All the chiefs of Eric were alſo preſent at the recital of this ode, which is in a noble ſtrain.</note>."</q> Afterwards he calls this Daniſh conqueror the commander of the Scottiſh fleet. <q rend="inline">"The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the Scottiſh fleet fattened the ravenous birds. The ſiſter of Nera [Death] trampled on the foe: ſhe trampled on the evening food of the eagle."</q> The Scots uſually joined the Daniſh or Norwegian invaders in their attempts on the northern parts of Britain <note n="z" place="bottom">See the Saxon epinicion in praiſe of king Athelſtan. ſupr. citat. Hen. Hunting. L. v. p. 203. 204.</note>: and from this circumſtance a new argument ariſes, to ſhew the cloſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication and alliance which muſt have ſubſiſted between Scotland and Scandinavia. Egill, although of the enemy's party, was a ſingular favourite of king Athelſtan. Athelſtan once aſked Egill how he eſcaped due puniſhment from Eric Blodoxe, the king of Northumberland, for the very capital and enormous crime which I have juſt mentioned. On which Egill immediately related the whole of that tranſaction to the Saxon king, in a ſublime ode ſtill extant <note n="a" place="bottom">Torfaeus Hiſt. Orcad. Praefat. <q rend="inline">"Rei ſtatim ordinem metro nunc ſatis obſcuro expoſuit."</q> Torfaeus adds, which is much to our purpoſe, <q rend="inline">"nequaquam ita narraturus NON INTELLIGENTI."</q>
               </note>. On another occaſion Athelſtan preſented Egill with two rings, and two large cabinets filled with ſilver; promiſing at the ſame time, to grant him any gift or favour which he ſhould chuſe to requeſt. Egill, ſtruck with gratitude, immediately compoſed a panegyrical poem in the Norwegian language, then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to both nations, on the virtues of Athelſtan, which the latter as generouſly requited with two marcs of pure gold <note n="b" place="bottom">Crymog. Arn. Jon. p. 129. ut ſupr.</note>. Here is likewiſe another argument that the Saxons had no ſmall eſteem for the ſcaldic poetry. It is highly rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to conjecture, that our Daniſh king Canute; a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate of moſt extenſive juriſdiction, and not only king of
<pb facs="tcp:0373500101:60"/>
England, but of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, was not without the cuſtomary retinue of the northern courts, in which the ſcalds held ſo diſtinguiſhed and important a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Human nature, in a ſavage ſtate, aſpires to ſome ſpecies of merit; and in every ſtage of ſociety is alike ſuſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible of flattery, when addreſſed to the reigning paſſion. The ſole object of theſe northern princes was military glory. It is certain that Canute delighted in this mode of entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which he patroniſed and liberally rewarded. It is related in KNYTLINGA-SAGA, or Canute's Hiſtory, that he commanded the ſcald Loftunga to be put to death, for daring to comprehend his atchievements in too conciſe a poem. <q rend="inline">"Nemo, ſaid he, ante te, auſus eſt de me BREVES CANTILENAS componere."</q> A curious picture of the tyrant, the patron, and the barbarian, united! But the bard extorted a ſpeedy pardon, and with much addreſs, by producing the next day before the king at dinner an ode of more than thirty ſtrophes, for which Canute gave him fifty marcs of purified ſilver <note n="c" place="bottom">Bartholin. Antiquit. Danic. Lib. i. cap. 10. p. 169. 170. See KNYTLINGA SAGA, in Catal. Codd. MSS. Bibl. Holm. Hickeſ. Theſaur. ii. 312.</note>. In the mean time, the Daniſh language began to grow perfectly familiar in England. It was eagerly learned by the Saxon clergy and nobility, from a principle of ingratiating themſelves with Canute: and there are many manuſcripts now remaining, by which it will appear, that the Daniſh runes were much ſtudied among our Saxon anceſtors, under the reign of that monarch <note n="d" place="bottom">Hickes, ubi ſupr. i. 134. 136.</note>.</p>
            <p>The ſongs of the Iriſh bards are by ſome conceived to be ſtrongly marked with the traces of ſcaldic imagination; and theſe traces, which will be reconſidered, are believed ſtill to ſurvive among a ſpecies of poetical hiſtorians, whom they call TALE-TELLERS, ſuppoſed to be the deſcendants of the original Iriſh bards <note n="e" place="bottom">
                  <p>We are informed by the Iriſh hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, that ſaint Patrick, when he converted Ireland to the Chriſtian faith, deſtroyed three hundred volumes of the ſongs of the Iriſh bards. Such was their dignity in this country, that they were permitted to wear a robe of the ſame colour with that of the royal family. They were conſtantly ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to a triennial feſtival: and the moſt approved ſongs delivered at this aſſembly were ordered to be preſerved in the cuſtody of the king's hiſtorian or antiquary. Many of theſe compoſitions are referred to by Keating, as the foundation of his hiſtory of Ireland. Ample eſtates were appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to them, that they might live in a condition of independence and eaſe. The profeſſion was hereditary: but when a bard died, his eſtate devolved not to his eldeſt ſon, but to ſuch of his family as diſcovered the moſt diſtinguiſhed talents for poetry and muſic. Every principal bard retained thirty of inferior note, as his attendants; and a bard of the ſecondary claſs was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by a retinue of fifteen. They ſeem to have been at their height in the year 558. See Keating's Hiſtory of Ireland, p. 127. 132. 370. 380. And Pref. p. 23. None of their poems have been tranſlated.</p>
                  <p>There is an article in the LAWS of Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth king of Scotland, promulged in the year 850, which places the bards of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, who certainly were held in equal eſteem with thoſe of the neighbouring countries, in the loweſt ſtation. <q rend="inline">"Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivos, BARDOS, otio addictos, ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Nor is it improbable that the Welſh bards <note n="g" place="bottom">
                  <p>The bards of Britain were originally a conſtitutional appendage of the druidical hierarchy. In the pariſh of Llanidan in the iſle of Angleſey, there are ſtill to be ſeen the ruins of an arch-druid's manſion, which they call TRER DREW, that is the DRUID'S MANSION. Near it are marks of the habitations of the ſeparate conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſocieties, which were under his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate orders and inſpection. Among theſe is TRER BEIRD, or, as they call it to this day, the HAMLET OF THE BARDS. Row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands's MONA, p. 83. 88. But ſo ſtrong was the attachment of the Celtic nations, among which we reckon Britain, to poetry, that, amidſt all the changes of government and manners, even long after the order of Druids was extinct, and the national reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion altered, the bards, acquiring a ſort of civil capacity, and a new eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſtill continued to flouriſh. And with regard to Britain, the bards flouriſhed moſt in thoſe parts of it, which moſt ſtrongly retained their native Celtic character. The Britons living in thoſe countries that were between the Trent or Humber and the Thames, by far the greateſt portion of this iſland, in the midſt of the Roman garriſons and colonies, had been ſo long inured to the cuſtoms of the Romans, that they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved very little of the Britiſh; and from this long and habitual intercourſe, before the fifth century, they ſeem to have loſt their original language. We cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the ſlighteſt trace, in the poems of the bards, the LIVES of the Britiſh ſaints, or any other antient monument, that they held any correſpondence with the Welſh, the Corniſh, the Cumbrian, or the Strath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluyd Britons. Among other Britiſh inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions grown obſolete among them, they ſeem to have loſt the uſe of Bards; at leaſt there are no memorials of any they had, nor any of their ſongs remaining: nor do the Welſh or Cumbrian poets ever touch upon any tranſactions that paſſed in thoſe countries, after they were relinquiſhed by the Romans.</p>
                  <p>And here we ſee the reaſon why the Welſh bards flouriſhed ſo much and ſo long. But moreover the Welſh, kept in awe as they were by the Romans, harraſſed by the Saxons, and eternally jealous of the attacks, the encroachments, and the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of aliens, were on this account attached to their Celtic manners: this ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and theſe circumſtances, inſpired them with a pride and an obſtinacy for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a national diſtinction, and for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving their antient uſages, among which the bardic profeſſion is ſo eminent.</p>

their communications with Armorica, mentioned at large above. The proſody of the Welſh bards depended much on alliteration <note n="h" place="bottom">See infr. SECT. x. p. 32.</note>. Hence they ſeem to have paid an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the ſcaldic verſification. The Iſlandic poets are ſaid to have carried alliteration to the higheſt pitch of exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in their earlieſt periods: whereas the Welſh bards of the ſixth century uſed it but ſparingly, and in a very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect degree. In this circumſtance a proof of imitation, at leaſt of emulation, is implied <note n="i" place="bottom">I am however informed by a very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent antiquary in Britiſh literature, that there are manifeſt marks of alliteration in ſome druidical fragments ſtill remaining, undoubtedly compoſed before the Britons could have poſſibly mixed in the ſmalleſt degree with any Gothic nation. Rhyme is likewiſe found in the Britiſh poetry at the earlieſt period, in thoſe druidical triplets called ENGLYN MILWR, or the WAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIOR'S SONG, in which every verſe is cloſed with a conſonant ſyllable. See a metrical Druid oracle in Borlaſe's Antiquit. Cornwall. B. iii. ch. 5. p. 185. edit. 1769.</note>. There are moreover, ſtrong inſtances of conformity between the manners of the two nations; which, however, may be accounted for on general principles ariſing from our comparative obſervations on rude life. Yet it is remarkable that mead, the northern nectar, or favourite liquor of the Goths <note n="k" place="bottom">And of the antient Franks. Gregory of Tours mentions a Frank drinking this liquor; and adds, that he acquired this habit from the BARBAROUS or Frankiſh nations. Hiſt. Franc. lib. viii. c. 33. p. 404. ed. 1699.

                  <p>The caliphs, and other eaſtern potentates, had their bards: whom they treated with equal reſpect. Sir John Maundeville, who travelled in 1340, ſays, that when the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of Cathay, or great Cham of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, is ſeated at dinner in high pomp with his lords, <q rend="inline">"no man is ſo hardi to ſpeak to him except it be MUSICIANS <hi>to ſolace the emperour.</hi>"</q> 
                     <bibl>chap. lxvii. p. 100.</bibl> Here is another proof of the correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence between the eaſtern and northern cuſtoms: and this inſtance might be brought as an argument of the bardic inſtitution being fetched from the eaſt. Leo Afer mentions the <hi>Poetae curiae</hi> of the Caliph's court at Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dad, about the year 990. De Med. et Philoſ. Arab. cap. iv. Thoſe poets were in moſt repute among the Arabians, who could ſpeak extemporaneous verſes to the Caliph. Euſeb. Renaudot. apud Fabric. Bibl. Gr. xiii. p. 249. Thomſon, in the CASTLE of INDOLENCE, mentions the BARD IN WAITING being introduced to lull the Caliph aſleep. And Maundeville men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions MINSTRELLES as eſtabliſhed officers in the court of the emperor of Cathay.</p>
               </note>. Nor muſt I paſs over, what reflects much light on this reaſoning, that the eſtabliſhment of the houſhold of the old Iriſh chiefs, exactly reſembles that of the Welſh kings. For, beſides the bard, the muſician, and the ſmith, they have both a phyſician, a huntſman, and other correſponding officers <note n="x" place="bottom">See Temple, ubi ſupr. p. 346.</note>. We muſt alſo remember, that an intercourſe was neceſſarily produced between the Welſh and Scandinavians, from the piratical irruptions of the latter: their ſcalds, as I have already remarked, were reſpected and patroniſed in the courts of thoſe princes, whoſe territories were the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal objects of the Daniſh invaſions. Torfaeus expreſsly affirms this of the Anglo-Saxon and Iriſh kings; and it is
<pb facs="tcp:0373500101:66"/>
at leaſt probable, that they were entertained with equal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard by the Welſh princes, who ſo frequently concurred with the Danes in diſtreſſing the Engliſh. It may be added, that the Welſh, although living in a ſeparate and detached ſituation, and ſo ſtrongly prejudiced in favour of their own uſages, yet from neighbourhood, and unavoidable communications of various kinds, might have imbibed the ideas of the Scandinavian bards from the Saxons and Danes, after thoſe nations had occupied and overſpread all the other parts of our iſland.</p>
            <p>Many pieces of the Scottiſh bards are ſtill remaining in the high-lands of Scotland. Of theſe a curious ſpecimen, and which conſidered in a more extenſive and general reſpect, is a valuable monument of the poetry of a rude period, has lately been given to the world, under the title of the WORKS OF OSSIAN. It is indeed very remarkable, that in theſe poems, the terrible graces, which ſo naturally characteriſe, and ſo generally conſtitute, the early poetry of a barbarous people, ſhould ſo frequently give place to a gentler ſet of manners, to the ſocial ſenſibilities of poliſhed life, and a more civiliſed and elegant ſpecies of imagination. Nor is this circumſtance, which diſarranges all our eſtabliſhed ideas concerning the ſavage ſtages of ſociety, eaſily to be accounted for, unleſs we ſuppoſe, that the Celtic tribes, who were ſo ſtrongly addicted to poetical compoſition, and who made it ſo much their ſtudy from the earlieſt times, might by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees have attained a higher vein of poetical refinement, than could at firſt ſight or on common principles be expected among nations, whom we are accuſtomed to call barbarous; that ſome few inſtances of an elevated ſtrain of friendſhip, of love, and other ſentimental feelings, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting in ſuch nations, might lay the foundation for intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing a ſet of manners among the bards, more refined and exalted than the real manners of the country: and that panegyrics on thoſe virtues, tranſmitted with improvements
<pb facs="tcp:0373500101:67"/>
from bard to bard, muſt at length have formed characters of ideal excellence, which might propagate among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple real manners bordering on the poetical. Theſe poems, however, notwithſtanding the difference between the Gothic and the Celtic rituals, contain many viſible veſtiges of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinavian ſuperſtition. The alluſions in the ſongs of Oſſian to ſpirits, who preſide over the different parts and direct the various operations of nature, who ſend ſtorms over the deep, and rejoice in the ſhrieks of the ſhipwrecked mariner, who call down lightning to blaſt the foreſt or cleave the rock, and diffuſe irreſiſtible peſtilence among the people, beautifully conducted indeed, and heightened, under the ſkilful hand of a maſter bard, entirely correſpond with the Runic ſyſtem, and breathe the ſpirit of its poetry. One fiction in particular, the moſt EXTRAVAGANT in all Oſſian's poems, is founded on an eſſential article of the Runic belief. It is where Fingal fights with the ſpirit of Loda. Nothing could aggrandiſe Fingal's heroiſm more highly than this marvellous encounter. It was eſteemed among the antient Danes the moſt daring act of courage to engage with a ghoſt <note n="y" place="bottom">Bartholin. De Contemptu Mortis apud Dan. L. ii. c. 2. p. 258. And ibid. p. 260. There are many other marks of Gothic cuſtoms and ſuperſtitions in Oſſian. The faſhion of marking the ſepulchres of their chiefs with circles of ſtones, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponds with what Olaus Wormius relates of the Danes. Monum. Danic. Hafn. 1634. p. 38. See alſo Ol. Magn. Hiſt. xvi. 2. In the HERVARER SAGA, the ſword of Suarfulama is forged by the dwarfs, and called Tirſing. Hickes, vol. i. p. 193. So Fingal's ſword was made by an enchanter, and was called the SON of LUNO. And, what is more, this Luno was the Vulcan of the north, lived in Juteland, and made complete ſuits of armour for many of the Scandinavian heroes. See TEMORA, B. vii. p. 159. OSSIAN, vol. ii. edit. 1765. Hence the bards of both countries made him a celebrated enchanter. By the way, the names of ſword-ſmiths were thought worthy to be recorded in hiſtory.

But we are not informed whether theſe were Scandinavian, Celtic, or Teutonic poems.</p>
            <p>About the beginning of the tenth century, France was invaded by the Normans, or NORTHERN-MEN, an army of adventurers from Norway, Denmark, and Sweden. And although the conquerors, eſpecially when their ſucceſs does not ſolely depend on ſuperiority of numbers, uſually aſſume

At leaſt they ſeem to have prepared the way for the more eaſy admiſſion of the Arabian fabling about the ninth century, by which they were, however, in great meaſure, ſuperſeded. The Arabian fictions were of a more ſplendid nature, and better adapted to the increaſing civility of the times. Leſs horrible and groſs, they had a novelty, a variety, and a magnificence, which carried with them the charm of faſcination. Yet it is probable, that many of the ſcaldic imaginations might have been blended with the Arabian. In the mean time, there is great reaſon to believe, that the Gothic ſcalds enriched their vein of fabling from this new and fruitful ſource of fiction, opened by the Arabians in Spain, and afterwards propagated by the cruſades. It was in many reſpects cogenial with their own <note n="d" place="bottom">Beſides the general wildneſs of the imagery in both, among other particular circumſtances of coincidence which might be mentioned here, the practice of giving names to ſwords, which we find in the ſcaldic poems, occurs alſo among the Arabians.

SECT. iii. p. 132.</note>. It is not likely that theſe pieces, to ſay no more, were compoſed till the Scandinavian tribes had been converted to chriſtianity; that is, as I have before obſerved, about the cloſe of the tenth century.

               </note>. It has, however, been urged, that as the irruption of the Normans into France, under their leader Rollo, did not take place till towards the beginning of the tenth century, at which period the ſcaldic art was arrived to the higheſt perfection in Rollo's native country, we can eaſily trace the deſcent of the French and Engliſh romances of chivalry from the Northern Sagas. It is ſuppoſed, that Rollo carried with him many ſcalds from the north, who tranſmitted their ſkill to their children and ſucceſſors: and that theſe, adopting the religion, opinions, and language, of the new country, ſubſtituted the heroes of chriſtendom, inſtead of thoſe of their pagan anceſtors, and began to celebrate the feats of Charlemagne, Roland, and Oliver, whoſe true hiſtory they ſet off and embelliſhed with the ſcaldic figments of dwarfs, giants, dragons, and inchantments <note n="p" place="bottom">Percy's Eſſ. Metr. Rom. p. viii.</note>. There is, however, ſome reaſon to believe, that theſe fictions were current among the French long before; and, if the principles advanced in the former part of this diſſertation be true, the fables adhering to Charlemagne's real hiſtory muſt be referred to another ſource.</p>
            <p>Let me add, that the inchantments of the Runic poetry are very different from thoſe in our romances of chivalry. The former chiefly deal in ſpells and charms, ſuch as would preſerve from poiſon, blunt the weapons of an enemy, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure victory, allay a tempeſt, cure bodily diſeaſes, or call the dead from their tombs: in uttering a form of myſterious words, or inſcribing Runic characters. The magicians of romance are chiefly employed in forming and conducting a train of deceptions. There is an air of barbaric horror in the
<pb facs="tcp:0373500101:75"/>
incantations of the ſcaldic fablers: the magicians of romance often preſent viſions of pleaſure and delight; and, although not without their alarming terrors, ſometimes lead us through flowery foreſts, and raiſe up palaces glittering with gold and precious ſtones. The Runic magic is more like that of Canidia in Horace, the romantic reſembles that of Armida in Taſſo. The operations of the one are frequently but mere tricks, in compariſon of that ſublime ſolemnity of necromantic machinery which the other ſo awefully diſplays.</p>
            <p>It is alſo remarkable, that in the earlier ſcaldic odes, we find but few dragons, giants, and fairies. Theſe were intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced afterwards, and are the progeny of Arabian fancy. Nor indeed do theſe imaginary beings often occur in any of the compoſitions which preceded the introduction of that ſpecies of fabling. On this reaſoning, the Iriſh tale-teller mentioned above, could not be a lineal deſcendant of the elder Iriſh bards. The abſence of giants and dragons, and, let me add, of many other traces of that fantaſtic and bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant imagery which compoſes the ſyſtem of Arabian ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, from the poems of Oſſian, are a ſtriking proof of their antiquity. It has already been ſuggeſted, at what period, and from what origin, thoſe fancies got footing in the Welſh poetry: we do not find them in the odes of Talieſſin or Aneurin <note n="q" place="bottom">Who flouriſhed about the year 570. He has left a long ſpirited poem called GO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DODIN, often alluded to by the later Welſh bards, which celebrates a battle fought againſt the Saxons near Cattraeth, under the conduct of Mynnydawe Eiddin, in which all the Britons, three only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, among which was the bard Aneurin himſelf, were ſlain. I will give a ſpecimen. <q rend="inline">"The men whoſe drink was mead, comely in ſhape, haſtened to Cattraeth. Theſe impetuous warriors in ranks, armed with red ſpears, long and bending, began the battle. Might I ſpeak my revenge againſt the people of the Deiri, I would overwhelm them, like a deluge, in one ſlaughter: for unheeding I have loſt a friend, who was brave in reſiſting his enemies. I drank of the wine and metheglin of Mordai, whoſe ſpear was of huge ſize. In the ſhock of the battle, he prepared food for the eagle. When Cydwal haſtened forward, a ſhout aroſe: before the yellow morning, when he gave the ſignal, he broke the ſhield into ſmall ſplinters. The men haſtened to Cattraeth, noble in birth: their drink was wine and mead, out of golden cups. There were three hundred and ſixty three adorned with chains of gold; but of thoſe, who filled with wine, ruſhed on to the fight, only three eſcaped, who hewed their way with the ſword, the warrior of Acron, Conan Dacarawd, and I the bard Aneurin, red with blood, otherwiſe I ſhould not have ſurvived to compoſe this ſong. When Caradoc haſtened to the war, he was the ſon of a wild boar, in hewing down the Saxons; a bull in the conflict of fight, he twiſted the wood [ſpear] from their hands. Gurien ſaw not his father after he had lifted the gliſtening mead in his hand. I praiſe all the warriors who thus met in the battle, and attacked the foe with one mind. Their life was ſhort, but they have left a long regret to their friends. Yet of the Saxons they ſlew more than ſeven ..... There was many a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhedding tears. The ſong is due to thee who haſt attained the higheſt glory: thou who waſt like fire, thunder and ſtorm: O Rudd Fedell, warlike champion, excellent in might, you ſtill think of the war. The noble chiefs deſerve to be celebrated in verſe, who after the fight made the rivers to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow their banks with blood. Their hands glutted the throats of the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brown eagles, and ſkilfully prepared food for the ravenous birds. Of all the chiefs who went to Cattraeth with golden chains,"</q> &amp;c. This poem is extremely difficult to be underſtood, being written, if not in the Pictiſh language, at leaſt in a dialect of the Britons very different from the modern Welſh. See the learned and ingenious Mr. Evans's DISSERTATIO DE BARDIS, p. 68.—75.</note>. This reaſoning explains an obſervation
<pb facs="tcp:0373500101:76"/>
of an ingenious critic in this ſpecies of literature, and who has ſtudied the works of the Welſh bards with much attention. <q rend="inline">"There are not ſuch extravagant FLIGHTS in any poetic compoſitions, except it be in the EASTERN; to which, as far as I can judge by the few tranſlated ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens I have ſeen, they <hi>bear a near reſemblance</hi>

Such a fiction as this is entirely different from the caſt and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plection of the ideas of the original Welſh poets. It is eaſy to collect from the Welſh odes, written after the tenth century, many ſignatures of this EXOTIC imagery. Such as, <q rend="inline">"Their aſſault was like ſtrong lions. He is valourous as a lion, who can reſiſt his lance? The dragon of Mona's ſons were ſo brave in fight, that there was horrible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation, and upon Tal Moelvre a thouſand banners. Our lion has brought to Trallwng three armies. A dragon he was from the beginning, unterrified in battle. A dragon of Ovain. Thou art a prince firm in battle, like an elephant. Their aſſault was as of ſtrong lions. The lion of Cemais fierce in the onſet, when the army ruſheth to be covered with red. He ſaw Llewellyn like a burning dragon in the ſtrife of Arſon. He is furious in fight like an outrageous dragon.

Compare Aneurin's ode, cited above.</note>."</q> Theſe images are all drawn from their own country, from their ſituation and circumſtances; and, although highly poetical, are in general of a more ſober and temperate colouring. In a word, not only that elevation of alluſion, which many ſuppoſe to be peculiar to the poetry of Wales, but that fertility of fiction, and thoſe marvellous fables recorded in Geoffrey of Monmouth, which the generality of readers, who do not ſufficiently attend to the origin of that hiſtorian's ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic materials, believe to be the genuine offspring of the Welſh poets, are of foreign growth. And, to return to the ground of this argument, there is the ſtrongeſt reaſon to ſuſpect, that even the Gothic EDDA, or ſyſtem of poetic mythology of the northern nations, is enriched with thoſe higher ſtrokes of oriental imagination, which the Arabians had communicated to the Europeans. Into this extravagant tiſſue of unmeaning allegory, falſe philoſophy, and falſe theology, it was eaſy to incorporate their moſt wild and romantic conceptions <note n="z" place="bottom">
                  <p>Huet is of opinion, that the EDDA is entirely the production of Snorro's fancy. But this is ſaying too much. See Orig. Roman. p. 116. The firſt Edda was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled, undoubtedly with many additions and interpolations, from fictions and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions in the old Runic poems, by Soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund Sigfuſſon, ſurnamed the Learned, about the year 1057. He ſeems to have made it his buſineſs to ſelect or digeſt into one body ſuch of theſe pieces as were beſt calculated to furniſh a collection of poetic phraſes and figures. He ſtudied in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, and chiefly at Cologne. This firſt Edda, being not only prolix, but perplexed and obſcure, a ſecond, which is that now extant, was compiled by Snorro Sturleſon, born in the year 1179.</p>
                  <p>It is certain, and very obſervable, that in the EDDA we find much more of giants, dragons, and other imaginary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, undoubtedly belonging to Arabian romance, then in the earlier Scaldic odes. By the way, there are many ſtrokes in both the EDDAS taken from the REVEL ATIONS of Saint John, which muſt come from the compilers who were Chriſt ians.</p>

It muſt be confeſſed, that the ideas of chivalry, the appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and the ſubject of romance, ſubſiſted among the Goths. But this muſt be underſtood under certain limitations. There is no peculiarity which more ſtrongly diſcriminates the manners of the Greeks and Romans from thoſe of modern times, than that ſmall degree of attention and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect with which thoſe nations treated the fair ſex, and that inconſiderable ſhare which they were permitted to take in converſation, and the general commerce of life. For the truth of this obſervation, we need only appeal to the claſſic writers: in which their women appear to have been devoted to a ſtate of ſecluſion and obſcurity. One is ſurpriſed that barbarians ſhould be greater maſters of complaiſance than the moſt poliſhed people that ever exiſted. No ſooner was the Roman empire overthrown, and the Goths had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered Europe, than we find the female character aſſuming an unuſual importance and authority, and diſtinguiſhed with new privileges, in all the European governments eſtabliſhed by the northern conquerors. Even amidſt the confuſions of ſavage war, and among the almoſt incredible enormities committed by the Goths at their invaſion of the empire, they forbore to offer any violence to the women. This perhaps is one of the moſt ſtriking features in the new ſtate of manners, which took place about the ſeventh century: and it is to this period, and to this people, that we muſt refer the origin of gallantry in Europe. The Romans never intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced theſe ſentiments into their European provinces.</p>

The Goths believed ſome divine and prophetic quality to be inherent in their women; they admitted them into their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and conſulted them on the public buſineſs of the ſtate. They were ſuffered to conduct the great events which they predicted.

            <p>But the deference paid to the fair ſex, which produced the ſpirit of gallantry, is chiefly to be ſought for in thoſe ſtrong and exaggerated ideas of female chaſtity which prevailed among the northern nations. Hence the lover's devotion to his miſtreſs was encreaſed, his attentions to her ſervice multiplied, his affection heightened, and his ſollicitude ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated, in proportion as the difficulty of obtaining her was enhanced: and the paſſion of love acquired a degree of delicacy, when controlled by the principles of honour and purity. The higheſt excellence of character then known was a ſuperiority in arms; and that rival was moſt likely to gain his lady's regard, who was the braveſt champion. Here we ſee valour inſpired by love. In the mean time, the ſame heroic ſpirit which was the ſureſt claim to the favour of the ladies, was often exerted in their protection: a protection much wanted in an age of rapine, of plunder, and piracy; when the weakneſs of the ſofter ſex was expoſed to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual dangers and unexpected attacks <note n="g" place="bottom">See inſtances of this ſort of violence in the antient HISTORY of HIALMAR, a Runic romance, p. 135. 136. 140.

It is eaſy to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the officious emulation and ardour of many a gallant young warrior, preſſing forward to be foremoſt in this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable ſervice, which flattered the moſt agreeable of all paſſions, and which gratified every enthuſiaſm of the times,
<pb facs="tcp:0373500101:82"/>
eſpecially the faſhionable fondneſs for a wandering and mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary life. In the mean time, we may conceive the lady thus won, or thus defended, conſcious of her own importance, affecting an air of ſtatelineſs: it was her pride to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved her chaſtity inviolate, ſhe could perceive no merit but that of invincible bravery, and could only be approached in terms of reſpect and ſubmiſſion.</p>
            <p>Among the Scandinavians, a people ſo fond of cloathing adventures in verſe, theſe gallantries muſt naturally become the ſubject of poetry, with its fictitious embelliſhments. Accordingly, we find their chivalry diſplayed in their odes; pieces, which at the ſame time greatly confirm theſe obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations. The famous ode of Regner Lodbrog, affords a ſtriking inſtance; in which, being impriſoned in a loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome dungeon, and condemned to be deſtroyed by venomous ſerpents, he ſolaces his deſperate ſituation by recollecting and reciting the glorious exploits of his paſt life. One of theſe, and the firſt which he commemorates, was an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievement of chivalry. It was the delivery of a beautiful Swediſh princeſs from an impregnable fortreſs, in which ſhe was forcibly detained by one of her father's captains. Her father iſſued a proclamation, promiſing that whoever would reſcue the lady, ſhould have her in marriage. Regner ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in the attempt, and married the fair captive. This was about the year 860 <note n="h" place="bottom">See Torf. Hiſt. Norw. tom. i. lib. 10. Saxo Grammat. p. 152. And Ol. Worm. Lit. Rom. p. 221. edit. 4. I ſuſpect that the romantic amour between Regner and Aſlauga is the forgery of a much later age See REGNARA LODBROG'S Saga. C. 5. apud Biorneri Hiſtor. Reg. Her. et Pugil. Res. praeclar. geſt. Stockholm. 1737.</note>. There are other ſtrokes in Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's ode, which, although not belonging to this particular ſtory, deſerve to be pointed out here, as illuſtrative of our argument. Such as, <q rend="inline">"It was like being placed near a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful virgin on a couch.—It was like kiſſing a young widow in the firſt ſeat at a feaſt. I made to ſtruggle in the twilight that golden-haired chief, who paſſed his mornings among the young maidens, and loved to converſe with
<pb facs="tcp:0373500101:83"/>
widows.—He who aſpires to the love of young virgins, ought always to be foremoſt in the din of arms <note n="i" place="bottom">St.. 13. 14. 19. 23.</note>."</q> It is worthy of remark, that theſe ſentiments occur to Regner while he is in the midſt of his tortures, and at the point of death. Thus many of the heroes in Froiſſart, in the greateſt extremities of danger, recollect their amours, and die think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their miſtreſſes. And by the way, in the ſame ſtrain, Boh, a Daniſh champion, having loſt his chin, and one of his cheeks, by a ſingle ſtroke from Thurſtain Midlang, only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected how he ſhould be received, when thus maimed and disfigured, by the Daniſh girls. He inſtantly exclaimed in a tone of ſavage gallantry, <q rend="inline">"The Daniſh virgins will not now willingly or eaſily give me kiſſes, if I ſhould perhaps return home <note n="k" place="bottom">Chron. Norveg. p. 136.</note>."</q> But there is an ode, in the KNYTLINGA-SAGA, written by Harald the VALIANT, which is profeſſedly a ſong of chivalry; and which; excluſive of its wild ſpirit of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, and its images of ſavage life, has the romantic air of a ſet of ſtanzas, compoſed by a Provencial troubadour. Harald, appears to have been one of the moſt eminent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers of his age. He had killed the king of Drontheim in a bloody engagement. He had traverſed all the ſeas, and viſited all the coaſts, of the north; and had carried his pira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical enterpriſes even as far as the Mediterranean, and the ſhores of Africa. He was at length taken priſoner, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for ſome time at Conſtantinople. He complains in this ode, that the reputation he had acquired by ſo many hazardous exploits, by his ſkill in ſingle combat, riding, ſwimming, gliding along the ice, darting, rowing, and guiding a ſhip through the rocks, had not been able to make any impreſſion on Eliſſiff, or Eliſabeth, the beautiful daughter of Jarilas, king of Ruſſia <note n="l" place="bottom">Bartholin. p. 54.</note>.</p>
            <p>Here, however, chivalry ſubſiſted but in its rudiments. Under the feudal eſtabliſhments, which were ſoon afterwards erected in Europe, it received new vigour, and was inveſted
<pb facs="tcp:0373500101:84"/>
with the formalities of a regular inſtitution. The nature and circumſtances of that peculiar model of government, were highly favourable to this ſtrange ſpirit of fantaſtic heroiſm; which, however unmeaning and ridiculous it may ſeem, had the moſt ſerious and ſalutary conſequences in aſſiſting the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral growth of refinement, and the progreſſion of civiliſation, in forming the manners of Europe, in inculcating the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of honour, and in teaching modes of decorum. The genius of the feudal policy was perfectly martial. A nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous nobility, formed into ſeparate principalities, affecting independence, and mutually jealous of their privileges and honours, neceſſarily lived in a ſtate of hoſtility. This ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion rendered perſonal ſtrength and courage the moſt requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite and eſſential accompliſhments. And hence, even in time of peace, they had no conception of any diverſions or public ceremonies, but ſuch as were of the military kind. Yet, as the courts of theſe petty princes were thronged with ladies of the moſt eminent diſtinction and quality, the ruling paſſion for war was tempered with courteſy. The prize of contending champions was adjudged by the ladies; who did not think it inconſiſtent to be preſent or to preſide at the bloody ſpectacles of the times; and who, themſelves, ſeem to have contracted an unnatural and unbecoming ferocity, while they ſoftened the manners of thoſe valorous knights who fought for their approbation. The high notions of a noble deſcent, which aroſe from the condition of the feudal conſtitution, and the ambition of forming an alliance with powerful and opulent families, cheriſhed this romantic ſyſtem. It was hard to obtain the fair feudatary, who was the object of univerſal adoration. Not only the ſplendor of birth, but the magnificent caſtle ſurrounded with embattelled walls, guarded with maſſy towers, and crowned with lofty pinnacles, ſerved to inflame the imagination, and to create an attachment to ſome illuſtrious heireſs, whoſe point of honour it was to be chaſte and inacceſſible. And the difficulty
<pb facs="tcp:0373500101:85"/>
of ſucceſs on theſe occaſions, ſeems in great meaſure to have given riſe to that ſentimental love of romance, which acquieſced in a diſtant reſpectful admiration, and did not aſpire to poſſeſſion. The want of an uniform adminiſtration of juſtice, the general diſorder, and ſtate of univerſal anarchy, which naturally ſprung from the principles of the feudal policy, preſented perpetual oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of checking the oppreſſions of arbitrary lords, of delivering captives injuriouſly detained in the baronial caſtles, of puniſhing robbers, of ſuccouring the diſtreſſed, and of avenging the impotent and the unarmed, who were every moment expoſed to the moſt licentious inſults and injuries. The violence and injuſtice of the times gave birth to valour and humanity. Theſe acts conferred a luſtre and an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance on the character of men profeſſing arms, who made force the ſubſtitute of law. In the mean time, the cruſades, ſo pregnant with enterprize, heightened the habits of this warlike fanaticiſm. And when theſe foreign expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were ended, in which the hermits and pilgrims of Paleſtine had been defended, nothing remained to employ the activity of adventurers but the protection of innocence at home. Chivalry by degrees was conſecrated by religion, whoſe authority tinctured every paſſion, and was engrafted into every inſtitution, of the ſuperſtitious ages; and at length compoſed that ſingular picture of manners, in which the love of a god and of the ladies were reconciled, the ſaint and the hero were blended, and charity and revenge, zeal and gallantry, devotion and valour, were united.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who think that chivalry ſtarted late, from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the feudal conſtitution, confound an improved effect with a ſimple cauſe. Not having diſtinctly conſidered all the particularities belonging to the genius, manners, and uſages of the Gothic tribes, and accuſtomed to contemplate nations under the general idea of barbarians, they cannot look for the ſeeds of elegance amongſt men, diſtinguiſhed
<pb facs="tcp:0373500101:86"/>
only for their ignorance and their inhumanity. The rude origin of this heroic gallantry was quickly overwhelmed and extinguiſhed, by the ſuperior pomp which it neceſſarily adopted from the gradual diffuſion of opulence and civility, and that blaze of ſplendor with which it was ſurrounded, amid the magnificence of the feudal ſolemnities. But above all, it was loſt and forgotten in that higher degree of embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment, which at length it began to receive from the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of romance.</p>
            <p>From the foregoing obſervations taken together, the following general and comprehenſive concluſion ſeems to reſult.</p>
            <p>Amid the gloom of ſuperſtition, in an age of the groſſeſt ignorance and credulity, a taſte for the wonders of oriental fiction was introduced by the Arabians into Europe, many countries of which were already ſeaſoned to a reception of its extravagancies, by means of the poetry of the Gothic ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>alds, who perhaps originally derived their ideas from the fame fruitful region of invention. Theſe fictions, coinciding with the reigning manners, and perpetually kept up and improved in the tales of troubadours and minſtrels, ſeem to have centered about the eleventh century in the ideal hiſtories of Turpin and Geoffrey of Monmouth, which record the ſuppoſititious atchievements of Charlemagne and king Arthur, where they formed the ground-work of that ſpecies of fabulous narrative called romance. And from theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings or cauſes, afterwards enlarged and enriched by kindred fancies fetched from the cruſades, that ſingular and capricious mode of imagination aroſe, which at length compoſed the marvellous machineries of the more ſublime Italian poets, and of their diſciple Spenſer.</p>

            <head type="sub">DISSERTATION II.</head>
            <p>THE irruption of the northern nations into the weſtern empire, about the beginning of the fourth century, forms one of the moſt intereſting and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant periods of modern hiſtory. Europe, on this great event, ſuffered the moſt memorable revolutions in its govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and manners; and from the moſt flouriſhing ſtate of peace and civility, became on a ſudden, and for the ſpace of two centuries, the theatre of the moſt deplorable devaſtation and diſorder. But among the diſaſters introduced by theſe irreſiſtible barbarians, the moſt calamitous ſeems to have been the deſtruction of thoſe arts which the Romans ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſo ſucceſsfully to cultivate in their capital, and which they had univerſally communicated to their conquered pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces. Towards the cloſe of the fifth century, very few traces of the Roman policy, juriſprudence, ſciences, and literature,
<pb facs="tcp:0373500101:88"/>
remained. Some faint ſparks of knowledge were kept alive in the monaſteries; and letters and the liberal arts were happily preſerved from a total extinction during the confuſions of the Gothic invaders, by that ſlender degree of culture and protection which they received from the prelates of the church, and the religious communities.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding the famous academy of Rome<note n="a" place="bottom">Theodoſius the younger, in the year 425, founded an academy at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, which he furniſhed with able profeſſors of every ſcience, intending it as a rival inſtitution to that at Rome. Gianon. Hiſt. Napl, ii. ch. vi. ſect. 1. A noble library had been eſtabliſhed at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople by Conſtantius and Valens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the year 380, the cuſtody of which was committed to four Greek and three Latin antiquaries or curators. It contained ſixty thouſand volumes. Zonaras relates, that among other treaſures in this library, there was a roll one hundred feet long, made of a dragon's gutt or inteſtine, on which Homer's Iliad and Odyſſey were written in golden letters. See Bibl. Hiſtor. Literar. Select. &amp;c. Ienae, 1754: p. 164. ſeq. Literature flouriſhed in the eaſtern empire, while the weſtern was depopulated by the Goths; and for many centuries af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards. The Turks deſtroyed one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty thouſand volumes, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in the imperial library, when they ſacked Conſtantinople in the year 1454.

He adopted into his ſervice Boe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thius, the moſt learned and almoſt only Latin philoſopher of that period. Caſſiodorus, another eminent Roman ſcholar, was Theodoric's grand ſecretary: who retiring into a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery in Calabria, paſſed his old age in collecting books, and practiſing mechanical experiments <note n="c" place="bottom">Func. ut ſupr. xiii. p. 471. xi. p. 595.</note>. He was the author of many valuable pieces which ſtill remain <note n="d" place="bottom">Cave. Saecul. Eutych. Hiſt Lit. p. 391.</note>. He wrote with little elegance, but he was the firſt that ever digeſted a ſeries of royal charts or inſtruments; a monument of ſingular utility to the hiſtorian, and which has ſerved to throw the
<pb facs="tcp:0373500101:89"/>
moſt authentic illuſtration on the public tranſactions and legal conſtitutions of thoſe times. Theodoric's patronage of learning is applauded by Claudian, and Sidonius Apollinaris. Many other Gothic kings were equally attached to the works of peace; and are not leſs conſpicuous for their juſtice, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and temperance, than for their fortitude and magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity. Some of them were diligent in collecting the ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered remains of the Roman inſtitutes, and conſtructing a regular code of juriſprudence <note n="d" place="bottom">Gianon. Hiſt. Nap. iii. c. 1</note>. It is highly probable, that thoſe Goths who became maſters of Rome, ſooner acquired ideas of civility, from the opportunity which that city above all others afforded them of ſeeing the felicities of poliſhed life, of obſerving the conveniencies ariſing from political economy, of mixing with characters reſpectable for prudence and learning, and of employing in their counſels men of ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior wiſdom, whoſe inſtruction and advice they found it their intereſt to follow. But perhaps theſe northern adventurers, at leaſt their princes and leaders, were not even at their firſt migrations into the ſouth, ſo totally ſavage and unciviliſed as we are commonly apt to ſuppoſe. Their enemies have been their hiſtorians, who naturally painted theſe violent diſturbers of the general repoſe in the warmeſt colours. It is not eaſy to conceive, that the ſucceſs of their amazing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes was merely the effect of numbers and tumultuary depredation: nor can I be perſuaded, that the laſting and flouriſhing governments which they eſtabliſhed in various parts of Europe, could have been framed by brutal force alone, and the blind efforts of unreflecting ſavages. Superior ſtrength and courage muſt have contributed in a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able degree to their rapid and extenſive conqueſts; but at the ſame time, ſuch mighty atchievements could not have been planned and executed without ſome extraordinary vigour of mind, uniform principles of conduct, and no common talents of political ſagacity.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:0373500101:90"/>
Although theſe commotions muſt have been particularly unfavourable to the more elegant literature, yet Latin poetry, from a concurrence of cauſes, had for ſome time begun to relapſe into barbariſm. From the growing encreaſe of chriſtianity, it was deprived of its old fabulous embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhments, and chiefly employed in compoſing eccleſiaſtical hymns. Amid theſe impediments however, and the neceſſary degeneration of taſte and ſtyle, a few poets ſupported the character of the Roman muſe with tolerable dignity, during the decline of the Roman empire. Theſe were Auſonius, Paulinus, Sidonius, Sedulius, Arator, Juvencus, Proſper, and Fortunatus. With the laſt, who flouriſhed at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the ſixth century, and was biſhop of Poitiers, the Roman poetry is ſuppoſed to have expired.</p>
            <p>In the ſixth century Europe began to recover ſome degree of tranquillity. Many barbarous countries during this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, particularly the inhabitants of Germany, of Frieſland, and other northern nations, were converted to the chriſtian faith <note n="e" place="bottom">Cave. Saecul. Monoth. p. 440.</note>. The religious controverſies which at this time di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Greek and Latin churches, rouſed the minds of men to literary enquiries. Theſe diſputes in ſome meaſure called forth abilities which otherwiſe would have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known and unemployed; and, together with the ſubtleties of argumentation, inſenſibly taught the graces of ſtyle, and the habits of compoſition. Many of the popes were perſons of diſtinguiſhed talents, and promoted uſeful knowledge no leſs by example than authority. Political union was by degrees eſtabliſhed; and regular ſyſtems of government, which alone can enſure perſonal ſecurity, aroſe in the various provinces of Europe occupied by the Gothic tribes. The Saxons had taken poſſeſſion of Britain, the Franks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came maſters of Gaul, the Huns of Pannonia, the Goths of
<pb facs="tcp:0373500101:91"/>
Spain, and the Lombards of Italy. Hence leiſure and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe diffuſed a mildneſs of manners, and introduced the arts of peace; and, awakening the human mind to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of its powers, directed its faculties to their proper objects.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, no ſmall obſtruction to the propagation or rather revival of letters, was the paucity of valuable books. The libraries, particularly thoſe of Italy, which abounded in numerous and ineſtimable treaſures of literature, were every where deſtroyed by the precipitate rage and undiſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing violence of the northern armies. Towards the cloſe of the ſeventh century, even in the papal library at Rome, the number of books was ſo inconſiderable, that pope Saint Martin requeſted Sanctamand biſhop of Maeſtricht, if poſſible to ſupply this defect from the remoteſt parts of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many <note n="g" place="bottom">Concil.

See Catal. Bibl. Leidenſ. p. 381. A. D. 1716. Poggius Florentinus, an eminent reſtorer of claſſical literature, ſays, that in the year 1446, he found a much more correct copy of Quintilian's Inſtitutes than had been yet ſeen in Italy, almoſt periſhing, at the bottom of a dark neglected tower of the monaſtery of ſaint Gall, in France, together with the three firſt books, and half the fourth of Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Flaccus's Argonautics, and Aſconius Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianus's comment on eight orations of Tully. See Poggii Op. p. 309. Amſt. 1720. 8vo. The very copy of Quintilian, found by Poggius, is ſaid to have been in lord Sunderland's noble library now at Blenheim. Poggius, in his Dialogue De Infelicitate Principum, ſays of himſelf, that he travelled all over Germany in ſearch of books. It is certain that by his means Quintilian, Tertullian, Aſconius Pedianus, Lucretius, Salluſt, Silius Italicus, Colu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mella, Manilius, Tully's Orations, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianus Marcellinus, Valerius Flaccus, and ſome of the Latin grammarians, and other antient authors, were recovered from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion, and brought into general notice by being printed in the fifteenth century.

This collection was principally made by Charles the fifth, who began his reign
<pb facs="tcp:0373500101:98"/>
in 1365. This monarch was paſſionately fond of reading, and it was the faſhion to ſend him preſents of books from every part of the kingdom of France. Theſe he ordered to be elegantly tranſcribed, and richly illuminated; and he placed them in a tower of the Louvre, from thence called, <hi>la toure de la libraire.</hi> The whole conſiſted of nine hundred volumes. They were depoſited in three chambers; which, on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, were wainſcotted with Iriſh oak, and cieled with cypreſs curiouſly carved. The windows were of painted glaſs, fenced with iron bars and copper wire. The Engliſh became maſters of Paris in the year 1425.

Even ſo late as the year 1471, when Louis the eleventh of France borrowed the works of the Arabian phyſician Rhaſis, from the faculty of medicine at Paris, he not only depoſited by way of pledge a quantity of valuable plate, but was obliged to procure a nobleman to join with him as ſurety in a deed <note n="f" place="bottom">See Bury's PHILOBIBLON, mentioned at large below, <hi>De modo communicandi ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentibus libros noſtros.</hi> cap. xix.</note>, by which he bound himſelf to return it under a conſiderable forfeiture <note n="g" place="bottom">Robertſon's Hiſt.

            <p>After the calamities which the ſtate of literature ſuſtained in conſequence of the incurſions of the northern nations, the firſt reſtorers of the antient philoſophical ſciences in Europe, the ſtudy of which, by opening the faculties and extending the views of mankind, gradually led the way to other parts of learning, were the Arabians. In the beginning of the eighth century, this wonderful people, equally fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for their conqueſts and their love of letters, in ravaging the Aſiatic provinces, found many Greek books, which they read with infinite avidity: and ſuch was the gratification they received from this fortunate acquiſition, and ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully their curioſity was excited to make further diſcoveries in this new field of knowledge, that they requeſted their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liphs to procure from the emperor at Conſtantinople the beſt Greek writers. Theſe they carefully tranſlated into Arabic <note n="k" place="bottom">See Abulfarag. per Pocock, Dynaſt. p. 160. Greek was a familiar language to the Arabians. The accompts of the caliph's treaſury were always written in Greek till the year of Chriſt 715. They were then ordered to be drawn in Arabic. Many proofs of this might be mentioned. Greek was a familiar language in Mahomet's houſhold. Zaid, one of Mahomet's ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, to whom he dictated the Koran, was a perfect maſter of Greek. Sale's Prelim. Diſc. p. 144, 145. The Arabic gold coins were always inſcribed with Greek legends till about the year 700.</note>. But every part of the Grecian literature did not equally gratify their taſte. The Greek poetry they rejected, becauſe it inculcated polytheiſm and idolatry, which were inconſiſtent with their religion. Or perhaps it was too cold and too correct for their extravagant and romantic conceptions <note n="l" place="bottom">Yet it appears from many of their fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that ſome of the Greek poets were not unfamiliar among them, perhaps long before the period aſſigned in the text. Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus Edeſſenus, a Maronite, by profeſſion an aſtronomer, tranſlated Homer into Syriac about the year 770. Theophan. Chronogr. p. 376. Abulfarag. ut ſupr. p. 217. Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſius, in his very curious account of the <hi>manuſcript collection of Greek chemiſts</hi> in the library of Saxe-Gotha, relates, that ſoon after the year 750, the Arabians tranſlated Homer and Pindar, amongſt other Greek books. Erneſt. Salom. Cyprian. Catal. Codd. MSS. Bibl. Gothan. p. 71. 87. Apud Fabric. Bibl. Gr. xii. p. 753. It is however certain, that the Greek philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers were their objects.

Of the Greek hiſtory they made no uſe, becauſe it recorded events which preceded their prophet Mahomet.

The Greek ethics were ſuper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

into England by Adrian, a Neapolitan monk, and a native of Africa, who was equally ſkilled in ſacred and profane learning, and at the ſame time appointed by the pope to the abbacy of ſaint Auſtin's at Canterbury. Bede informs us, that Adrian requeſted pope Vitellian to confer the arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhoprick on Theodore, and that the pope conſented on condition that Adrian, <q rend="inline">"who had been <hi>twice in France,</hi> and on that account was <hi>better acquainted</hi> with the nature and difficulties of ſo long a journey,"</q> would conduct Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore into Britain <note n="h" place="bottom">Bed.

Benedict ſeems at this time to have been one of the moſt diſtinguiſhed of the Saxon eccleſiaſtics: availing himſelf of the arrival of theſe two learned ſtrangers, under their direction and aſſiſtance, he procured workmen from France, and built the monaſtery of Weremouth in Northumberland. The church he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed of ſtone, after the manner of the Roman architec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and adorned its walls and roof with pictures, which he purchaſed at Rome, repreſenting among other ſacred ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects the Virgin Mary, the twelve apoſtles, the evangelical hiſtory, and the viſions of the Apocalypſe <note n="k" place="bottom">See Bede, Hiſt.

Benedict added to his monaſtery an ample library, which he ſtored with Greek and Latin volumes, imported by himſelf from Italy <note n="l" place="bottom">Lel. ubi ſupr. 110.</note>.

            <p>The beſt writers among the Saxons flouriſhed about the eighth century. Theſe were Aldhelm, biſhop of Shirburn, Ceolfrid, Alcuine, and Bede; with whom I muſt alſo join king Alfred. But in an enquiry of this nature, Alfred de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves particular notice, not only as a writer, but as the illuſtrious rival of Charlemagne, in protecting and aſſiſting the reſtoration of literature. He is ſaid to have founded the univerſity of Oxford; and it is highly probable, that in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Charlemagne's ſimilar inſtitutions, he appointed learned perſons to give public and gratuitous inſtructions in theology, but principally in the faſhionable ſciences of logic, aſtronomy, arithmetic, and geometry, at that place, which was then a conſiderable town, and conveniently ſituated in the neighbourhood of thoſe royal ſeats at which Alfred chiefly reſided. He ſuffered no prieſt that was illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate to be advanced to any eccleſiaſtical dignity <note n="y" place="bottom">MS. Bever. MSS. Coll. Trin. Oxon. Codd. xlvii. f. 82.</note>. He invited his nobility to educate their ſons in learning, and requeſted thoſe lords of his court who had no children, to ſend to ſchool ſuch of their younger ſervants as diſcovered a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing capacity, and to breed them to the clerical profeſſion <note n="z" place="bottom">Bever, ibid.</note>. Alfred, while a boy, had himſelf experienced the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies ariſing from a want of ſcholars, and even of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon inſtructors, in his dominions: for he was twelve years of age, before he could procure in the weſtern kingdom a maſter properly qualified to teach him the alphabet.

He cauſed ſix wax tapers to be made, each twelve inches long, and of as many ounces in weight: on theſe tapers he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the inches to be regularly marked; and having found that one of them burned juſt four hours, he committed the care of them to the keepers of his chapel, who from time to time gave due notice how the hours went.

            <p>In the mean time we muſt not form too magnificent ideas of theſe celebrated maſters of ſcience, who were thus invited into foreign countries to conduct the education of mighty monarchs, and to plan the rudiments of the moſt illuſtrious academies.

Their circle of reading was contracted, their ſyſtems of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy jejune; and their lectures rather ſerved to ſtop the growth of ignorance, than to produce any poſitive or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant improvements in knowledge.

            <p>But Bede, whoſe name is ſo nearly and neceſſarily connected with every part of the literature of this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, and which has therefore been often already mentioned, emphatically ſtyled the Venerable by his cotemporaries, was by far the moſt learned of the Saxon writers.

perſpicuity and facility in his Latin ſtyle. But it is void of elegance, and often of purity; it ſhews with what grace and propriety he would have written, had his mind been formed on better models. Whoever looks for digeſtion of mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, diſpoſition of parts, and accuracy of narration, in this writer's hiſtorical works, expects what could not exiſt at that time. He has recorded but few civil tranſactions: but beſides that his hiſtory profeſſedly conſiders eccleſiaſtical affairs, we ſhould remember, that the building of a church, the preferment of an abbot, the canoniſation of a martyr, and the importation into England of the ſhin-bone of an apoſtle, were neceſſarily matters of much more importance in Bede's conceptions than victories or revolutions. He is fond of minute deſcription; but particularities are the fault and often the merit of early hiſtorians <note n="r" place="bottom">An ingenious author, who writes under the name of M. de Vigneul Marville, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, that Bede, <q rend="inline">"when he ſpeaks of the Magi who went to worſhip our Saviour, is very particular in the account of their names, age, and reſpective offerings.

Eginhart relates, that Charlemagne could ſpeak Latin as fluently as his native Frankiſh: but ſlightly paſſes over his accompliſhment in Greek, by artfully ſaying, that he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood it better than he could pronounce it <note n="f" place="bottom">Vit. Kar. Magn. p. 30.</note>. Nor, by the way, was Charlemagne's boaſted facility in the Latin ſo remarkable a prodigy. The Latin language was familiar to the Gauls when they were conquered by the Franks; for they were a province of the Roman empire till the year 485. It was the language of their religious offices, their laws, and public tranſactions. The Franks who conquered the Gauls at the period juſt mentioned, ſtill continued this uſage, imagining there was a ſuperior dignity in the language of imperial Rome: although this incorporation of the Franks with the Gauls greatly corrupted the latinity of the latter, and had given it a ſtrong tincture of barbarity before the reign of Charlemagne. But while we are bringing proofs which tend to extenuate the notion that Greek was now much known or cultivated, it muſt not be diſſembled, that John Erigena, a native of Aire in Scotland, and one of king Alfred's firſt lecturers at Oxford <note n="g" place="bottom">Wood Hiſt.

It is certain that literature was at its height among our Saxon anceſtors about the eighth century. Theſe happy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings were almoſt entirely owing to the attention of king Alfred, who encouraged learning by his own example, by founding <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eminaries of inſtruction, and by rewarding the labours of ſcholars. But the efforts of this pious monarch were ſoon blaſted by the ſupineneſs of his ſucceſſors, the incurſions of the Danes, and the diſtraction of national af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. Bede, from the eſtabliſhment of learned biſhops in every dioceſe, and the univerſal tranquillity which reigned over all the provinces of England, when he finiſhed his ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical hiſtory, flatters his imagination in anticipating
<pb facs="tcp:0373500101:126"/>
the moſt advantageous conſequences, and triumphantly cloſes his narrative with this pleaſing preſentiment. The Picts, at this period, were at peace with the Saxons or Engliſh, and converted to chriſtianity. The Scots lived contented within their own boundary. The Britons or Welſh, from a natural enmity, and a diſlike to the catholic inſtitution of keeping Eaſter, ſometimes attempted to diſturb the national repoſe; but they were in ſome meaſure ſubſervient to the Saxons. Among the Northumbrians, both the nobility and private perſons rather choſe their children ſhould receive the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtic tonſure, than be trained to arms <note n="x" place="bottom">Bede, Eccl.

            <p>But a long night of confuſion and groſs ignorance ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded. The principal productions of the moſt eminent monaſteries for three centuries, were incredible legends which diſcovered no marks of invention, unedifying homilies, and trite expoſitions of the ſcriptures. Many biſhops and abbots began to conſider learning as pernicious to true piety, and confounded illiberal igno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The conqueror himſelf patroniſed and loved letters.

To mention no more inſtances, ſuch great inſtitutions of perſons dedicated to religious and literary leiſure, while they diffuſed an air of civility, and ſoftened the manners of the people in their reſpective circles, muſt have afforded powerful invitations to ſtudious purſuits, and have conſequently added no ſmall degree of ſtability to the intereſts of learning.</p>
            <p>By theſe obſervations, and others which have occurred in the courſe of our enquiries, concerning the utility of monaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, I certainly do not mean to defend the monaſtic ſyſtem.

               </gap>onours which they conferred on ſcholars, the eſtabliſhment of colleges, the introduction of new ſyſtems of ſcience, the univerſal ardour which prevailed of breeding almoſt all perſons to letters, and the abolition of that excluſive right of teaching which the eccleſiaſtics had ſo long claimed; the monaſteries of courſe grew inattentive to ſtudies, which were more ſtrongly encouraged, more commodiouſly purſued, and more ſucceſsfully cultivated, in other places: they gradually became contemptible and unfaſhionable as nurſeries of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and their fraternities degenerated into ſloth and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. The moſt eminent ſcholars which England produced, both in philoſophy and humanity, before and even below the twelfth century, were educated in our religious houſes. The encouragement given in the Engliſh monaſteries for tranſcribing books, the ſcarcity of which in the middle ages we have before remarked, was very conſiderable. In every great abbey there was an apartment called the SCRIPTORIUM: where many writers were conſtantly buſied in tranſcribing not only the ſervice-books for the choir, but books for the library <note n="h" place="bottom">This was alſo a practice in the monaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries abroad; in which the boys and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices were chiefly employed.

            <p>Smoothneſs of verſification was an excellence which, like their Saxon predeceſſors, they ſtudied to a fault. Henry of Huntingdon, commonly known and celebrated as an hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, was likewiſe a terſe and polite Latin poet of this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod. He was educated under Alcuine of Anjou, a canon of Lincoln cathedral. His principal patrons were Aldwin and Reginald, both Normans, and abbots of Ramſey. His turn for poetry did not hinder his arriving to the dignity of an archdeacon.

Praef. p. xii.</note>. His merits as an hiſtorian have been juſtly diſplayed and recommended by lord Lyttelton <note n="k" place="bottom">In his Hiſtory of Henry the ſecond.</note>. But his abilities were not confined to proſe. He wrote many pieces of Latin poetry; and it is remarkable, that almoſt all the profeſſed writers in proſe of this age made experiments in verſe. His patron was Robert earl of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter; who, amidſt the violent civil commotions which diſquieted the reign of king Stephen, found leiſure and opportunity to protect and promote literary merit <note n="l" place="bottom">See Cave, Hiſt. Lit. p. 661.</note>. Till Malmeſbury's works appeared, Bede had been the chief and principal writer of Engliſh hiſtory. But a general ſpirit of writing hiſtory, owing to that curioſity which more poliſhed manners introduce, to an acquaintance with the antient hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, and to the improved knowledge of a language in which facts could be recorded with grace and dignity, was now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing.

His ARCHITRENIUS is a learned, ingenious, and very entertaining performance. It is a long Latin poem in nine books, dedicated to Walter biſhop of Rouen.

It is a ſituation fit for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of religion; and a religious edifice was firſt founded in this ſequeſtered retreat to the honour of a ſolitary life, by two hermits, remote from the noiſe of the world, upon the banks of the river Hondy, which winds through the midſt of the valley.—The rains which mountainous countries uſually produce, are here very frequent, the winds exceedingly tempeſtuous, and the winters almoſt

There ſeems to have been a rival ſpirit of writing Latin heroic poems about this period. In France, Guillaume le Breton, or William of Bretagny, about the year 1230, wrote a Latin heroic poem on Philip Auguſtus king of France, about the commencement of the thirteenth century, in twelve books, entitled PHILIPPIS <note n="d" place="bottom">He wrote it at fifty-five years of age. PHILIPP. lib. iii. v. 381. It was firſt printed in Pithou's Eleven Hiſtorians of France, Francof. 1536. fol. Next in D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Brito ſays in the PHILIPPIS, that he wrote a poem called KARLOTTIS, in praiſe of <hi>Petri Carlotti ſui,</hi> then not fifteen years old. PHILIPP. lib. i. v. 10. This poem was never printed, and is hardly known.</note>.

The verſification much reſembles that of Joſeph Iſcanus. He appears to have drawn a great part of his materials from Roger Hoveden's annals. But I am of opinion, that the PHILIPPID is greatly exceeded by the ALEXANDREID of Philip Gualtier de Chatillon, who flouriſhed likewiſe in France, and was provoſt of the canons of Tournay, about the year 1200 <note n="f" place="bottom">It was firſt printed, Argent. 1513. 8vo.

Greek manuſcripts found their way into Europe from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople in the time of the cruſades: and we might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that the Italians, who ſeem to have been the moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed and intelligent people of Europe during the barbarous ages, carried on communications with the Greek empire as early as the reign of Charlemagne.

            <p>But, to return to the leading point of our enquiry, this promiſing dawn of polite letters and rational know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge was ſoon obſcured. The temporary gleam of light did not arrive to perfect day. The minds of ſcholars were diverted from theſe liberal ſtudies in the rapidity of their career; and the arts of compoſition, and the ornaments of language were neglected, to make way for the barbarous and barren ſubtleties of ſcholaſtic divinity. The firſt teachers of this art, originally founded on that ſpirit of intricate and metaphyſical enquiry which the Arabians had communicated to philoſophy, and which now became almoſt abſolutely neceſſary for defending the doctrines of Rome, were Peter Lombard archbiſhop of Paris, and the celebrated Abelard: men whoſe conſummate abilities were rather qualified to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the church, and to reſtore uſeful ſcience, than to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt both, by confounding the common ſenſe of mankind with frivolous ſpeculation <note n="l" place="bottom">They both flouriſhed about the year 1150.</note>. Theſe viſionary theologiſts never explained or illuſtrated any ſcriptural topic: on the contrary, they perverted the ſimpleſt expreſſions of the ſacred text, and embarraſſed the moſt evident truths of the goſpel by laboured diſtinctions and unintelligible ſolutions. From the univerſities of France, which were then filled with mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of Engliſh ſtudents, this admired ſpecies of ſophiſtry was adopted in England, and encouraged by Lanfranc and Anſelm, archbiſhops of Canterbury <note n="m" place="bottom">

               <pb facs="tcp:0373500101:164"/>
Nor was the profeſſion of the civil and canonical laws a ſmall impediment to the propagation of thoſe letters which humaniſe the mind, and cultivate the manners. I do not mean to deny, that the accidental diſcovery of the imperial code in the twelfth century, contributed in a conſiderable degree to civiliſe Europe, by introducing, among other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial conſequences, more legitimate ideas concerning the nature of government and the adminiſtration of juſtice, by creating a neceſſity of transferring judicial decrees from an illiterate nobility to the cogniſance of ſcholars, by leſſening the attachment to the military profeſſion, and by giving ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and importance to civil employments: but to ſuggeſt, that the mode in which this invaluable ſyſtem of juriſpru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence was ſtudied, proved injurious to polite literature. It was no ſooner revived, than it was received as a ſcholaſtic ſcience, and taught by regular profeſſors, in moſt of the univerſities of Europe. To be ſkilled in the theology of the ſchools was the chief and general ambition of ſcholars: but at the ſame time a knowledge of both the laws was become an indiſpenſable requiſite, at leaſt an eſſential re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation, for obtaining the moſt opulent eccleſiaſtical dignities. Hence it was cultivated with univerſal avidity. It became ſo conſiderable a branch of ſtudy in the plan of academical diſcipline, that twenty ſcholars out of ſeventy were deſtined to the ſtudy of the civil and canon laws, in one of the moſt ample colleges at Oxford, founded in the year 1385. And it is eaſy to conceive the pedantry with which it was purſued in theſe ſeminaries during the middle ages. It was treated with the ſame ſpirit of idle ſpeculation which had been carried into philoſophy and theology, it was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with endleſs commentaries which diſclaimed all elegance of language, and ſerved only to exerciſe genius, as it afforded materials for framing the flimſy labyrinths of caſuiſtry.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0373500101:165"/>
It was not indeed probable, that theſe attempts in elegant literature which I have mentioned ſhould have any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent effects. The change, like a ſudden revolution in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, was too rapid for duration. It was moreover premature, and on that account not likely to be laſting. The habits of ſuperſtition and ignorance were as yet too powerful for a reformation of this kind to be effected by a few polite ſcholars. It was neceſſary that many circumſtances and events, yet in the womb of time, ſhould take place, before the minds of men could be ſo far enlightened as to receive theſe improvements.</p>
            <p>But perhaps inventive poetry loſt nothing by this relapſe. Had claſſical taſte and judgment been now eſtabliſhed, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination would have ſuffered, and too early a check would have been given to the beautiful extravagancies of romantic fabling. In a word, truth and reaſon would have chaſed before their time thoſe ſpectres of illuſive fancy, ſo pleaſing to the imagination, which delight to hover in the gloom of ignorance and ſuperſtition, and which form ſo conſiderable a part of the poetry of the ſucceeding centuries.</p>

            <p>The laſt of theſe three dialects, with which theſe Annals of Engliſh Poetry commence, formed a language extremely bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, irregular, and intractable; and conſequently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes no very ſtriking ſpecimens in any ſpecies of compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Its ſubſtance was the Daniſh Saxon, adulterated with French. The Saxon indeed, a language ſubſiſting on uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form principles, and poliſhed by poets and theologiſts, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever corrupted by the Danes, had much perſpicuity, ſtrength, and harmony: but the French imported by the Conqueror and his people, was a confuſed jargon of Teutonic, Gauliſh, and vitiated Latin. In this fluctuating ſtate of our national ſpeech, the French predominated. Even before the conqueſt the Saxon language began to fall into contempt, and the French, or Frankiſh, to be ſubſtituted in its ſtead: a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which at once facilitated and foretold the Norman acceſſion. In the year 652, it was the common practice of

The religious could not otherwiſe have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood their original charters.

An intermixture of the Saxon character is common in Engliſh and Latin manuſcripts, before the reign of Edward the third: but of a few types only.</note>. Yet this is almoſt a ſingle example. That monarch's motive was perhaps political: and he ſeems to have practiſed this expedient with a view of obliging his queen, who was of Saxon lineage; or with a deſign of flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering his Engliſh ſubjects, and of ſecuring his title already ſtrengthened by a Saxon match, in conſequence of ſo ſpecious and popular an artifice. It was a common and indeed a very natural practice, for the tranſcribers of Saxon books, to change the Saxon orthography for the Norman, and to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute in the place of the original Saxon, Norman words and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0373500101:170"/>
phraſes. A remarkable inſtance of this liberty, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times perplexes and miſleads the critics in Anglo-Saxon litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, appears in a voluminous collection of Saxon homilies, preſerved in the Bodleian library, and written about the time of Henry the ſecond <note n="s" place="bottom">MSS.

            <p>Among the manuſcripts of Digby in the Bodleian library at Oxford, we find a religious or moral Ode, conſiſting of one hundred and ninety-one ſtanzas, which the learned Hickes places juſt after the conqueſt <note n="f" place="bottom">Ling.

This is enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled <hi>Tractatus guidam in Anglico.</hi> The Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by manuſcript has no title.</note>: but as it contains few Norman terms, I am inclined to think it of rather higher an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity.

Although theſe four lines may be perhaps reſolved into two Alexandrines; a meaſure concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which more will be ſaid hereafter, and of which it will be ſufficient to remark at preſent, that it appears to have been uſed very early. For I cannot recollect any ſtrophes of this ſort in the elder Runic or Saxon poetry; nor in any of the old Frankiſh poems, particularly of Otfrid, a monk of Weiſſenburgh, who turned the evangelical hiſtory into Frankiſh verſe about the ninth century, and has left ſeveral

There is a circumſtance belonging to the antient Frankiſh verſification, which, as it greatly illuſtrates the ſubject of allite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, deſerves notice here. Otfrid's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of his Evangelical hiſtory to Lewis the firſt, king of the oriental France, conſiſts of four lined ſtanzas in rhyming couplets: but the firſt and laſt line of every ſtanzas begin and end with the ſame letter: and the letters of the title of the dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reſpectively, and the word of the laſt line of every tetraſtic.

            <p>Another Norman Saxon poem cited by the ſame induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious antiquary, is entitled THE LIFE OF SAINT MARGARET.

This poem is profeſſedly in rhyme, and the meaſure like that of the heroic Alexandrine of the French poetry. See Mallet's Introd. Dannem. &amp;c. ch. xiii.</note>.

Although pieces not abſolutely religious are ſometimes intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, the ſcheme of the compiler or tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criber ſeems to have been, to form a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete body of legendary and ſcriptural hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory in verſe, or rather to collect into one view all the religious poetry he could find.

            <p>This legend of Saint Thomas of Becket is exactly in the ſtyle of all the others; and as Becket was martyred in the latter part of the reign of Henry the ſecond from hiſtorical evidence, and as, from various internal marks, the language of theſe legends cannot be older than the twelfth century, I think we may fairly pronounce the LIVES OF THE SAINTS to have been written about the reign of Richard the firſt <note n="x" place="bottom">

But I am chiefly induced to cite this piece, as it proves the exceſſive attachment of our earlieſt poets to rhyme: they were fond of multiplying the ſame final ſound to the moſt tedious monotony; and without producing any effect of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This mode of writing is not uncommon in antient manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts of French poetry. And ſome critics may be inclined to ſuſpect, that the verſes which we call Alexandrine, acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally aſſumed their form merely from the practice of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd tranſcribers, who frugally choſe to fill their pages to the extremity, and violated the metrical ſtructure for the ſake
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0373500101:201"/>
of ſaving their vellum. It is certain, that the common ſtanza of four ſhort lines may be reduced into two Alexandrines, and on the contrary. I have before obſerved, that the Saxon poem cited by Hickes, conſiſting of one hundred and ninety one ſtanzas, is written in ſtanzas in the Bodleian, and in Alexandrines in the Trinity manuſcript at Cambridge. How it came originally from the poet I will not pretend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine.</p>
            <p>Our early poetry often appears in ſatirical pieces on the eſtabliſhed and eminent profeſſions. And the writers, as we have already ſeen, ſucceeded not amiſs when they cloathed their ſatire in allegory. But nothing can be conceived more ſcurrilous and illiberal than their ſatires when they deſcend to mere invective. In the Britiſh Muſeum, among other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples which I could mention, we have a ſatirical ballad on the lawyers <note n="e" place="bottom">MSS. ut ſup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The elder French poetry abounds in allegorical ſatire: and I doubt not that the author of the ſatire on the monaſtic profeſſion, cited above, copied ſome French ſatire on the ſubject. Satire was one ſpecies of the poetry of the Proven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial troubadours. Anſelm Fayditt a troubadour of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth century, who will again be mentioned, wrote a ſort of ſatirical drama called the HERESY of the FATHERS, HERE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GIA DEL PREYRES, a ridicule on the council which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the Albigenſes. The papal legates often fell under

            <p>In the Harleian manuſcripts I find an ancient French poem, yet reſpecting England, which is a humorous pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyric on a new religious order called LE ORDRE DE BEL EYSE. This is the exordium.</p>

            <p>The poet ingeniouſly feigns, that his new monaſtic order conſiſts of the moſt eminent nobility and gentry of both ſexes, who inhabit the monaſteries aſſigned to it promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly; and that no perſon is excluded from this eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment who can ſupport the rank of a gentleman. They are bound by their ſtatutes to live in perpetual idleneſs and lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury: and the ſatyriſt refers them for a pattern or rule of prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in theſe important articles, to the monaſteries of Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pringham in Lincolnſhire, Beverley in Yorkſhire, the Knights Hoſpitalers, and many other religious orders then flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in England <note n="i" place="bottom">MSS. ibid. f. 121.</note>.</p>
            <p>When we conſider the feudal manners, and the magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of our Norman anceſtors, their love of military glory, the enthuſiaſm with which they engaged in the cruſades, and the wonders to which they muſt have been familiariſed from thoſe eaſtern enterpriſes, we naturally ſuppoſe, what will hereafter be more particularly proved, that their retinues
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0373500101:203"/>
abounded with minſtrels and harpers, and that their chief entertainment was to liſten to the recital of romantic and martial adventures. But I have been much diſappointed in my ſearches after the metrical tales which muſt have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in their times. Moſt of thoſe old heroic ſongs are periſhed, together with the ſtately caſtles in whoſe halls they were ſung. Yet they are not ſo totally loſt as we may be apt to imagine. Many of them ſtill partly exiſt in the old Engliſh metrical romances, which will be mentioned in their proper places; yet diveſted of their original form, poliſhed in their ſtyle, adorned with new incidents, ſucceſſively mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derniſed by repeated tranſcription and recitation, and retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing little more than the outlines of the original compoſition. This has not been the caſe of the legendary and other reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious poems written ſoon after the conqueſt, manuſcripts of which abound in our libraries. From the nature of their ſubject they were leſs popular and common; and being leſs frequently recited, became leſs liable to perpetual innovation or alteration.</p>
            <p>The moſt antient Engliſh metrical romance which I can diſcover, is entitled the GESTE OF KING HORN. It was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently written after the cruſades had begun, is mentioned by Chaucer <note n="k" place="bottom">Rim. Thop. 3402. Urr.</note>, and probably ſtill remains in its original ſtate. I will firſt give the ſubſtance of the ſtory, and afterwards add ſome ſpecimens of the compoſition. But I muſt premiſe, that this ſtory occurs in very old French metre in the manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts of the Britiſh Muſeum <note n="l" place="bottom">MSS. Harl. 527. b. f. 59.

Here the princeſs Rymenild falls in love with him, declares her paſſion, and is betrothed. Horne, in conſequence of this engagement, leaves the princeſs for ſeven years; to demonſtrate, according to the ritual of chivalry, that by ſeeking and accompliſhing dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous enterpriſes he deſerved her affection. He proves a moſt valorous and invincible knight: and at the end of ſeven years, having killed king Mury, recovered his father's king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and atchieved many ſignal exploits, recovers the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs Rymenild from the hands of his treacherous knight and companion Fykenyld; carries her in triumph to his own country, and there reigns with her in great ſplendor and proſperity.

To talk of the groſſneſs and abſurdity of ſuch manners is little to the purpoſe; the poet is only concerned in the juſtneſs and faithfulneſs of the repreſentation.</p>

            <p>HITHERTO we have been engaged in examining the ſtate of our poetry from the conqueſt to the year 1200, or rather afterwards. It will appear to have made no very rapid improvement from that period. Yet as we proceed, we ſhall find the language loſing much of its antient barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm and obſcurity, and approaching more nearly to the dialect of modern times.</p>
            <p>In the latter end of the reign of Henry the third, a poem occurs, the date of which may be determined with ſome degree of certainty. It is a ſatirical ſong, or ballad, written by one of the adherents of Simon de Montfort earl of Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter, a powerful baron, ſoon after the battle of Lewes, which was fought in the year 1264, and proved very fatal to the intereſts of the king. In this deciſive action, Richard king of the Romans, his brother Henry the third, and prince Edward, with many others of the royal party, were taken priſoners.</p>

            <p>A learned and ingenious writer, in a work which places the ſtudy of the law in a new light, and proves it to be an entertaining hiſtory of manners, has obſerved, that this ballad on Richard of Alemaigne probably occaſioned a ſtatute againſt libels in the year 1275, under the title, <q rend="inline">"Againſt ſlanderous reports, or tales to cauſe diſcord betwixt king and people <note n="z" place="bottom">OBSERVATIONS UPON THE STA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUTES, CHIEFLY THE MORE ANCIENT, &amp;c. edit. 1766. p. 71.</note>."</q> That this ſpirit was growing to an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance which deſerved to be checked, we ſhall have occaſion to bring further proofs.</p>

of Henry the third, it will not be foreign to add, that in the thirty-ſixth year of the ſame king, forty ſhillings and one pipe of wine were given to Richard the king's harper, and one pipe of wine to Beatrice his wife <note n="e" place="bottom">Rot.

            <p>The firſt poet whoſe name occurs in the reign of Edward the firſt, and indeed in theſe annals, is Robert of Gloceſter, a monk of the abbey of Gloceſter. He has left a poem o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

From theſe and other circumſtances this piece appears to have been compoſed about the year 1280. It is exhibited in the manuſcripts, is cited by many antiquaries, and printed by Hearne, in the Alexandrine meaſure: but with equal probability might have been written in four-lined ſtanzas. This rhyming chronicle is totally deſtitute of art or imagination. The author has cloathed the fables of Geoffrey of Monmouth in rhyme, which have often a more poetical air in Geoffrey's proſe. The
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0373500101:214"/>
language is not much more eaſy or intelligible than that of many of the Norman Saxon poems quoted in the preceding ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: it is full of Saxoniſms, which indeed abound, more or leſs, in every writer before Gower and Chaucer. But this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity is perhaps owing to the weſtern dialect, in which our monk of Gloceſter was educated. Provincial barbariſms are naturally the growth of extreme counties, and of ſuch as are ſituated at a diſtance from the metropolis: and it is probable, that the Saxon heptarchy, which conſiſted of a cluſter of ſeven independent ſtates, contributed to produce as many different provincial dialects. In the mean time it is to be conſidered, that writers of all ages and languages have their affectations and ſingularities, which occaſion in each a peculiar phraſeology.</p>

            <p>Many of theſe lines are literally tranſlated from Geoffry of Monmouth. In king Arthur's battle with the giant at

            <p>It was a tradition invented by the old fablers, that giants brought the ſtones of Stonehenge from the moſt ſequeſtered deſerts of Africa, and placed them in Ireland; that every ſtone was waſhed with juices of herbs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a medical power; and that Merlin the magician, at the requeſt of king Arthur, tranſported them from Ireland, and erected them in circles on the plain of Ameſbury, as a ſepulchral monument for the Britons treacherouſly ſlain by Hengiſt.

This I grant: but not when known authenticated facts ſtood in their way, and while the real cauſe was remembered.

It appears from this and previous inſtances, that political bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lads, I mean ſuch as were the vehicles of political ſatire, prevailed much among our early anceſtors. About the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent era, we meet with a ballad complaining of the exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant fees extorted, and the numerous taxes levied, by the king's officers <note n="o" place="bottom">Ibid. f. 64. There is a ſong half Latin and half French, much on the ſame ſubject. Ibid. f. 137. b.</note>. There is a libel remaining, written indeed in French Alexandrines, on the commiſſion of trayl-baſton <note n="p" place="bottom">See Spelman and Dufreſne in Voc. And Rob. Brunne's Chron. ed. Hearne, p. 328.</note>, or the juſtices ſo denominated by Edward the firſt, during his abſence in the French and Scotch wars, about the year 1306. The author names ſome of the juſtices or commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, now not eaſily diſcoverable: and ſays, that he ſerved the king both in peace and war in Flanders, Gaſcony, and Scotland <note n="q" place="bottom">MSS. Harl. ibid. f. 113. b.</note>. There is likewiſe a ballad againſt the Scots, trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to Edward the firſt, and taken priſoners at the battles of Dunbar and Kykenclef, in 1305, and 1306 <note n="r" place="bottom">Ibid. f. 59.</note>. The licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs of their rude manners was perpetually breaking out in theſe popular paſquins, although this ſpecies of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulance uſually belongs to more poliſhed times.</p>
            <p>Nor were they leſs dexterous than daring in publiſhing their ſatires to advantage, although they did not enjoy the many conveniencies which modern improvements have afforded for the circulation of public abuſe. In the reign of Henry the ſixth, to purſue the topic a little lower, we find a ballad of this ſpecies ſtuck on the gates of the royal palace, ſeverely reflecting on the king and his counſellors then ſitting in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.

            <p>At the cloſe of the reign of Edward the firſt, and in the year 1303, a poet occurs named Robert Mannyng, but more commonly called Robert de Brunne. He was a Gilbertine monk in the monaſtery of Brunne, or Bourne, near Depyng in Lincolnſhire: but he had been before profeſſed in the priory of Sixhille, a houſe of the ſame order, and in the ſame county. He was merely a tranſlator. He tranſlated into Engliſh metre, or rather paraphraſed, a French book, written by Groſthead biſhop of Lincoln, entitled, MANUEL PECHE, or MANUEL de PECHE, that is, the MANUAL OF SINS. This tranſlation was never printed <note n="s" place="bottom">MSS. Bibl. Bodl. N. 415. membr. fol. Cont. 80. pag. Pr.<q> "Fadyr and ſone and holy goſte." </q>And MSS. Harl. 1701.</note>. It is a long work, and treats of the decalogue, and the ſeven deadly ſins, which are illuſtrated with many legendary ſtories. This is the title of the tranſlator. <q rend="inline">"Here bygynneth the boke that men clepyn in Frenſhe MANUEL PECHE, the which boke made yn Frenſhe Robert Grooſteſte byſhop of Lyncoln."</q> From the Prologue, among other circumſtances, it appears that Robert de Brunne deſigned this performance to be ſung to the harp at public entertainments, and that it was written or begun in the year 1303 <note n="t" place="bottom">Fol. 1. a.</note>.</p>

Hence Robert de Brunne, ſomewhat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accurately, calls it ſimply the BRUT <note n="m" place="bottom">The BRUT OF ENGLAND, a proſe Chronicle of England, ſometimes continued as low as Henry the ſixth, is a common ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript. It was at firſt tranſlated from a French Chronicle [MSS. Harl. 200. 4to.] written in the beginning of the reign of Edward the third. I think it is printed by Caxton under the title of <hi>Fructus Temporum.</hi> The French have a famous ancient proſe romance called BRUT, which includes the hiſtory of the Sangreal.

                     <p>I am of opinion, that ſome of the great military battering engines, ſo frequently mentioned in the hiſtories and other writers of the dark ages, were fetched from the cruſades. See a ſpecies of the catapult, uſed by the Syrian army in the ſiege of Mecca, about the year 680. Mod. Univ. Hiſt. B. i. c. 2. tom. ii. p. 117. Theſe expeditions into the eaſt undoubtedly much improved the European art of war. Taſſo's warlike machines, which ſeem to be the poet's invention, are formed on deſcriptions of ſuch wonderful machines which he had read in the cruſade hiſtorians, particularly Wilhelmus Tyrenſis.</p>

high deſcription, and that ſort of phraſeology which was then uſed by the minſtrels and harpers: that he rather aimed to give information than pleaſure, and that he was more ſtudious of truth than ornament. As he intended his chronicle to be ſung, at leaſt by parts, at public feſtivals, he found it expedient to apologiſe for theſe deficiencies in the prologue; as he had partly done before in his prologue to the MANUAL OF SINS.</p>

It was undoubtedly a great impediment to the cultivation and progreſſive improvement of the Engliſh language at theſe early periods, that the beſt authors choſe to write in French. Many of Robert Groſthead's pieces are indeed in Latin; yet where the ſubject was popular, and not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately addreſſed to learned readers, he adopted the Romance or French language, in preference to his native Engliſh. Of this, as we have already ſeen, his MANUEL PECHE, and his CHATEAU D' AMOUR, are ſufficient proofs, both in proſe and verſe: and his example and authority muſt have had conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable influence in encouraging this practice. Peter Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toft, our Auguſtine canon of Bridlington, not only compiled the large chronicle of England, above recited, in French; but even tranſlated Herbert Boſcam's Latin Life of Thomas of Beckett into French rhymes <note n="c" place="bottom">Pitſ. p. 890. Append. Who with great probability ſuppoſes him to have been an Engliſhman.</note>. John Hoveden, a native of London, doctor of divinity, and chaplain to queen Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor mother of Edward the firſt, wrote in French rhymes a book entitled, <hi>Roſarium de Nativitate, Paſſione, Aſcenſione, Jheſu Chriſti</hi>

                  <p>In the ſame manuſcript I find a French poem probably written by an Engliſhman, and in the year 1300, containing the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Gilote and Johanne, two ladies of gallantry, in various parts of England and Ireland; particularly at Wincheſter and Pontefract. f. 66. b. The curious reader is alſo referred to a French poem, in which the poet ſuppoſes that a minſtrel, <hi>jugleour,</hi> travelling from London, cloathed in a rich tabard, met the king and his retinue. The king aſks him many queſtions; particularly his lord's name, and the price of his horſe. The minſtrel evades all the king's queſtions by impertinent anſwers; and at laſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes to give his majeſty advice. Ibid. f. 107. b.</p>
               </note>. Yet this faſhion proceeded rather from neceſſity and a principle of convenience, than from affectation. The vernacular Engliſh, as I have before remarked, was rough and unpoliſhed: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though theſe writers poſſeſſed but few ideas of taſte and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, they embraced a foreign tongue, almoſt equally familiar, and in which they could convey their ſentiments with greater eaſe, grace, and propriety. It ſhould alſo be conſidered, that our moſt eminent ſcholars received a part of their education at the univerſity of Paris. Another, and a very material circ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, concurred to countenance this faſhionable practice of compoſing in French. It procured them readers of rank and diſtinction. The Engliſh court, for more than two hundred years after the conqueſt, was totally French: and our kings, either from birth, kindred, or marriage, and from a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual intercourſe, ſeem to have been more cloſely connected with France than with England. It was however fortunate that theſe French pieces were written, as ſome of them met
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0373500101:252"/>
with their tranſlators: who perhaps unable to aſpire to the praiſe of original writers, at leaſt by this means contributed to adorn their native tongue: and who very probably would not have written at all, had not original writers, I mean their cotemporaries who wrote in French, furniſhed them with models and materials.</p>
            <p>Hearne, to whoſe diligence even the poetical antiquarian is much obliged, but whoſe conjectures are generally wrong, imagines, that the old Engliſh metrical romance, called RY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHARDE CUER DE LYON, was written by Robert de Brunne. It is at leaſt probable, that the leiſure of monaſtic life pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced many rhymers. From proofs here given we may fairly conclude, that the monks often wrote for the minſtrels: and although our Gilbertine brother of Brunne choſe to relate true ſtories in plain language, yet it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that many of our antient tales in verſe containing fictitious adventures, were written, although not invented, in the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious houſes. The romantic hiſtory of <hi>Guy earl of Warwick,</hi> is expreſſly ſaid, on good authority, to have been written by Walter of Exeter, a Franciſcan Friar of Carocus in Cornwall, about the year 1292 <note n="g" place="bottom">Carew's Surv. Cornw. p. 59. edit. ut ſupr. I ſuppoſe Carew means the metri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Romance of GUY.

            <p>That the pope ſhould here pronounce the funeral pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyric of Edward the firſt, is by no means ſurpriſing, if we conſider the predominant ideas of the age. And in the true ſpirit of theſe ideas, the poet makes this illuſtrious monarch's atchievements in the holy land, his principal and leading topic. But there is a particular circumſtance alluded to in
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0373500101:273"/>
theſe ſtanzas, relating to the cruſading character of Edward, together with its conſequences, which needs explanation. Edward, in the decline of life, had vowed a ſecond expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Jeruſalem: but finding his end approach, in his laſt moments he devoted the prodigious ſum of thirty thouſand pounds to provide one hundred and forty knights <note n="u" place="bottom">The poet ſays eighty.</note>, who ſhould carry his heart into Paleſtine. But this appointment of the dying king was never executed. Our elegiſt, and the chroniclers, impute the crime of witholding ſo pious a legacy to the advice of the king of France, whoſe daughter Iſabel was married to the ſucceeding king. But it is more probable to ſuppoſe, that Edward the ſecond, and his profligate mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion Piers Gaveſton, diſſipated the money in their luxurious and expenſive pleaſures.</p>

            <p>WE have ſeen, in the preceding ſection, that the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of our poetical compoſition began to be changed about the reign of the firſt Edward: that either fictitious adventures were ſubſtituted by the minſtrels in the place of hiſtorical and traditionary facts, or reality diſguiſed by the miſrepreſentations of invention; and that a taſte for ornamental and even exotic expreſſion gradually prevailed over the rude ſimplicity of the native Engliſh phraſeology. This change, which with our language affected our poetry, had been growing for ſome time; and among other cauſes was occaſioned by the introduction and increaſe of the tales of chivalry.</p>
            <p>The ideas of chivalry, in an imperfect degree, had been of old eſtabliſhed among the Gothic tribes. The faſhion of challenging to ſingle combat, the pride of ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

All theſe cuſtoms were afterwards encouraged and confirmed by correſponding circumſtances in the feudal conſtitution. At length the cruſades excited a new ſpirit of enterpriſe, and introduced into the courts and ceremonies of European princes a higher degree of ſplendor and parade, caught from the riches and magnificence of eaſtern cities <note n="a" place="bottom">I cannot help tranſcribing here a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious paſſage from old Fauchett.

eſtabliſhed a taſte for hyperbolical deſcription, and propagated an infinity of marvellous tales, which men returning from diſtant countries eaſily impoſed on credulous and ignorant minds. The unparalleled emulation with which the nations of chriſtendom univerſally embraced this holy cauſe, the pride with which emperors, kings, barons, earls, biſhops, and knights ſtrove to excel each other on this intereſting occaſion, not only in proweſs and heroiſm, but in ſumptuous equipages, gorgeous banners, armorial cogniſances, ſplendid pavilions, and other expenſive articles of a ſimilar nature, diffuſed a love of war, and a fondneſs for military pomp. Hence their very diverſions became warlike, and the martial enthuſiaſm of the times appeared in tilts and tournaments. Theſe practices and opinions co-operated with the kindred ſuperſtitions of dragons <note n="b" place="bottom">See Kircher's Mund. Subterran. viii. § 4. He mentions a knight of Rhodes made grand maſter of the order for killing a dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, 1345.</note>, dwarfs, fairies, giants, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanters, which the traditions of the Gothic ſcalders had already planted; and produced that extraordinary ſpecies of compoſition which has been called ROMANCE.</p>
            <p>Before theſe expeditions into the eaſt became faſhionable, the principal and leading ſubjects of the old fablers were the atchievements of king Arthur with his knights of the round table, and of Charlemagne with his twelve peers. But in the romances written after the holy war, a new ſet of champions, of conqueſts and of countries, were intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. Trebizonde took place of Rouncevalles, and Godfrey of Bulloigne, Solyman, Nouraddin, the caliphs, the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dans, and the cities of Aegypt and Syria, became the favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite topics. The troubadours of Provence, an idle and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettled race of men, took up arms, and followed their barons
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0373500101:276"/>
in prodigious multitudes to the conqueſt of Jeruſalem. They made a conſiderable part of the houſhold of the nobility of France. Louis the ſeventh, king of France, not only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained them at his court very liberally, but commanded a conſiderable company of them into his retinue, when he took ſhip for Paleſtine, that they might ſolace him with their ſongs during the dangers and inconveniencies of ſo long a voyage <note n="c" place="bottom">Velley, Hiſt.

Many of the troubadours, whoſe works now exiſt, and whoſe names are recorded, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied their lords to the holy war. Some of the French nobility of the firſt rank were troubadours about the eleventh century: and the French critics with much triumph obſerve, that it is the GLORY of the French poetry to number <hi>counts</hi> and <hi>dukes,</hi> that is <hi>ſovereigns,</hi> among its profeſſors, from its commencement. What a glory! The wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipfull company of Merchant-taylors in London, if I recollect right, boaſt the names of many dukes, earls, and princes, enrolled in their community.

Here a new and more copious ſource of fabling was opened: in theſe expeditions they picked up numberleſs extravagant ſtories, and at their return enriched romance with an infinite variety of oriental ſcenes and fictions. Thus theſe later wonders, in ſome meaſure, ſupplanted the former: they had the recommendation of novelty, and gained ſtill more attention, as they came from a greater diſtance <note n="e" place="bottom">The old French hiſtorian Mezeray goes ſo far as to derive the origin of the French poetry and romances from the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſades.

If the critic means to inſinuate, that the French troubadours acquired their art of verſifying from theſe Norman bards, this reaſoning will favour the ſyſtem of thoſe, who contend that metrical romances lineally took their riſe from the hiſtorical odes of the Scandinavian ſcalds: for the Normans were a branch of the Scandinavian ſtock.

moſt early notice of a profeſſed book of chivalry in England, as it ſhould ſeem, appears under the reign of Henry the third; and is a curious and evident proof of the reputation and eſteem in which this ſort of compoſition was held at that period. In the revenue-roll of the twenty-firſt year of that king, there is an entry of the expence of ſilver claſps and ſtuds for the king's great book of romances. This was in the year 1237. But I will give the article in its original dreſs. <q rend="inline">"Et in firmaculis hapſis et clavis argenteis ad mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num librum ROMANCIS regis <note n="k" place="bottom">Rot. Pip. an. 21.

At leaſt the victorious atchievements of that monarch were ſo famous in the reign of Henry the ſecond, as to be made the ſubject of a picture in the royal palace of Claren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don near Saliſbury. A circumſtance which likewiſe appears from the ſame antient record, under the year 1246. <q rend="inline">"Et in camera regis ſubtus capellam regis apud Clarendon lambruſcanda, et muro ex tranſverſo illius camerae amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vendo et hyſtoria Antiochiae in eadem depingenda cum DUELLO REGIS RICARDI <note n="l" place="bottom">Rot.

            <p>But not only the pieces of the French minſtrels, written in French, were circulated in England about this time; but tranſlations of theſe pieces were made into Engliſh, which containing much of the French idiom, together with a ſort of poetical phraſeology before unknown, produced various innovations in our ſtyle. Theſe tranſlations, it is probable, were enlarged with additions, or improved with alterations of the ſtory. Hence it was that Robert de Brunne, as we have already ſeen, complained of <hi>ſtrange</hi> and <hi>quaint</hi> Engliſh, of the changes made in the ſtory of SIR TRISTRAM, and of the liberties aſſumed by his cotemporary minſtrels in altering facts and coining new phraſes. Yet theſe circumſtances en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched our tongue, and extended the circle of our poetry. And for what reaſon theſe fables were ſo much admired and encouraged, in preference to the languid poetical chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles of Robert of Glouceſter and Robert of Brunne, it is obvious to conjecture. The gallantries of chivalry were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited with new ſplendour, and the times were growing more refined. The Norman faſhions were adopted even in Wales. In the year 1176, a ſplendid carouſal, after the manner of the Normans, was given by a Welſh prince. This was Rhees ap Gryffyth king of South Wales, who at Chriſtmas made a great feaſt in the caſtle of Cardigan, then
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0373500101:281"/>
called Aberteivi, which he ordered to be proclaimed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Britain; and to <q rend="inline">"which came many ſtrangers, who were honourably received and worthily entertained, ſo that no man departed diſcontented. And among deeds of arms and other ſhewes, Rhees cauſed all the poets of Wales<note n="p" place="bottom">In illuſtration of the argument purſued in the text we may obſerve, that about this time the Engliſh minſtrels flouriſhed with new honours and rewards. At the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent marriage of the counteſs of Holland, daughter of Edward the firſt, every king minſtrel received xl. ſhillings. See Anſtis Ord. Gart. ii. p. 303. And Dugd.

He is likewiſe in Dante's Paradiſe. Fayditt was extremely profuſe and voluptuous. On the

death of king Richard, he travelled on foot for near twenty years, ſeeking his fortune; and during this long pilgrimage he married a nun of Aix in Provence, who was young and lively, and could accompany her huſband's tales and ſonnets with her voice. Fouquett de Marſeilles had a beautiful perſon, a ready wit, and a talent for ſinging: theſe popular accompliſhments recommended him to the courts of king Richard, Raymond count of Tholouſe, and Beral de Baulx; where, as the French would ſay, <hi>il fit les delices de cour.</hi> He fell in love with Adelaſia the wife of Beral, whom he cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in his ſongs.

If not a ſuperſtitious belief of the times, it was an hyperbolical invention ſtarted by the minſtrels, which ſoon grew into a tradition, and is gravely recorded by the chroniclers, that Richard carried with him to the cruſades king Arthur's celebrated ſword CALIBURN, and that he preſented it as a gift, or relic, of ineſtimable value to Tancred king of Sicily, in the year 1191 <note n="l" place="bottom">In return for ſeveral veſſels of gold and ſilver, horſes, bales of ſilk, four great ſhips, and fifteen gallies, given by Tancred.

Indeed the Arabian writer of the life of the ſultan Saladin, mentions ſome exploits of Richard almoſt incredible. But, as lord Lyttelton juſtly obſerves, this hiſtorian is highly valuable on account of the knowledge he had of the facts which he relates. It is from this writer we learn, in the moſt authentic manner, the actions and negotiations of Richard in the courſe of the enterpriſe for the recovery of the holy land, and all the particulars of that memorable war <note n="o" place="bottom">See Hiſt. of Hen. ii. vol. iv. p. 361.

            <p>But I do not mean to repeat here what has been already obſerved<note n="u" place="bottom">See Diſſ. i.</note> concerning the writings of Geoffry of Monmouth and Turpin. It will be ſufficient to ſay at preſent, that theſe two fabulous hiſtorians recorded the atchievements of Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemagne and of Arthur: and that Turpin's hiſtory was artful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forged under the name of that archbiſhop about the year 1110, with a deſign of giving countenance to the cruſades from the example of ſo high an authority as Charlemagne, whoſe pretended viſit to the holy ſepulchre is deſcribed in the twentieth chapter.</p>
            <p>As to the Siege of Troy, it appears that both Homer's poems were unknown, at leaſt not underſtood in Europe, from the abolition of literature by the Goths in the fourth cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, to the fourteenth. Geoffry of Monmouth indeed, who wrote about the year 1160, a man of learning for that age, produces Homer in atteſtation of a fact aſſerted in his hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory: but in ſuch a manner, as ſhews that he knew little more than Homer's name, and was but imperfectly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Homer's ſubject.

This work was abridged by Vincen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Bellovacenſis, a friar of Burgundy, about the year 1244. See his Specul. Hiſtor. lib. iii. 63.</note>. Dictys Cretenſis is a proſe Latin hiſtory of the Trojan war, in ſix books, paraphraſed about the reign of Diocleſian or Conſtantine by one Septimius, from ſome Grecian hiſtory on the ſame ſubject, ſaid to be diſcovered under a ſepulchre by means of an earthquake in the city of Cnoſſus, about the time of Nero, and to have been compoſed by Dictys, a Cretan, and a ſoldier in the Trojan war. The fraud of diſcovering copies of books in this extraordinary manner, in order to infer from thence their high and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable antiquity, ſo frequently practiſed, betrays itſelf. But that the preſent Latin Dictys had a Greek original, now loſt, appears from the numerous greciſms with which it abounds: and from the literal correſpondence of many paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages with the Greek fragments of one Dictys cited by antient authors. The Greek original was very probably forged under the name of Dictys, a traditionary writer on the ſubject, in the reign of Nero, who is ſaid to have been fond of the Trojan ſtory <note n="z" place="bottom">See Perizon.

But this tradition appears to have been older than the Edda. And it is more probable, that the Britons and Francs borrowed it from the Scandinavian Goths, and adapted it to themſelves; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we ſuppoſe that theſe nations, I mean the former, were branches of the Gothic ſtem, which gave them a ſort of inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent right to the claim. This reaſoning may perhaps account for the early exiſtence and extraordinary popularity of the Trojan ſtory among nations ignorant and illiterate, who could only have received it by tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Geoffry of Monmouth took this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent of the Britons from Troy, from the Welſh or Armoric bards, and they perhaps had it in common with the Scandinavian ſcalders.

               </note>. But we ſhould remember its origin. The Arabian books abound with the moſt incredible fictions and traditions concerning Alexander the Great, which they probably borrowed and improved from the Perſians. They call him Eſcander. If I recollect right, one of the miracles of this romance is our hero's horn. It is ſaid, that Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der gave the ſignal to his whole army by a wonderful horn of immenſe magnitude, which might be heard at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of ſixty miles, and that it was blown or ſounded by ſixty men at once <note n="x" place="bottom">It is alſo in a manuſcript entitled <hi>Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Secretorum Ariſtotelis,</hi> Lib. 5.

This is the horn which Orlando won from the giant Jatmund, and which, as Turpin and the Iſlandic bards report, was endued with magical power, and might be heard at the diſtance of twenty miles.

Berni, and Arioſto have all ſuch a horn: and the fiction is here traced to its original ſource. But in ſpeaking of the books which furniſhed the ſtory of Alexander, I muſt not forget that Quintus Curtius was an admired hiſtorian of the romantic ages. He is quoted in the POLICRATICON of John of Saliſbury, who died in the year 1181 <note n="z" place="bottom">viii. 18.</note>.

            <p>Oddegir the Dane makes a part of Charlemagne's hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; and, I believe, is mentioned by archbiſhop Turpin. But his exploits have been recorded in verſe by Adenez, an old French poet, not mentioned by Fauchett, author of the two metrical romances of <hi>Berlin</hi> and <hi>Cleomades,</hi> under the name of <hi>Ogier le Danois,</hi> in the year 1270. This author was maſter of the muſicians, or, as others ſay, herald at arms, to the duke of Brabant. Among the royal manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts in the Muſeum, we have a poem, <hi>Le Livre de Ogeir de Dannemarche</hi>

To this ſubject, although almoſt equally belonging to that of Charlemagne, we may alſo refer a French romance in verſe, written by Philipes Mouſques, canon and chancellor of the church of Tournay. It is in fact, a chronicle of France: but the author, who does not chuſe to begin quite ſo high as Adam and Eve, nor yet later than the Trojan war, opens his hiſtory with the rape of Helen, paſſes on to an ample deſcription of the ſiege of Troy; and, through an exact detail of all the great events which ſucceeded, conducts his reader to the year 1240. This work comprehends all the fictions of Turpin's Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemagne, with a variety of other extravagant ſtories diſperſed in many profeſſed romances. But it preſerves numberleſs cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious particulars, which throw conſiderable light on hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical facts. Du Cange has collected from it all that concerns the French emperors of Conſtantinople, which he has printed at the end of his entertaining hiſtory of that city.</p>
            <p>It was indeed the faſhion for the hiſtorians of theſe times, to form ſuch a general plan as would admit all the abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of popular tradition. Connection of parts, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of ſubject, were as little ſtudied as truth. Ages of ignorance and ſuperſtition are more affected by the marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous than by plain facts; and believe what they find written, without diſcernment or examination.

Vincent de Beauvais, who lived under Louis the ninth of France, and who, on account of his extraordinary erudition, was appointed preceptor to that king's ſons, very gravely claſſes archbiſhop Turpin's Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemagne among the real hiſtories, and places it on a level with Suetonius and Ceſar. He was himſelf an hiſtorian,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0373500101:303"/>
and has left a large hiſtory of the world, fraught with a variety of reading, and of high repute in the middle ages; but edifying and entertaining as this work might have been to his cotemporaries, at preſent it ſerves only to record their prejudices, and to characteriſe their credulity <note n="q" place="bottom">He flouriſhed about 1260.</note>.</p>

The conqueſts of Alexander the great were celebrated by one Simon, in old Pictavian or Limoſin, about the twelfth century. This piece thus begins:

An Italian poem on Alexander, called <hi>Trionfo Magno,</hi> was preſented to Leo the tenth, by Dominicho Falugi Anciſeno, in the year 1521. Creſcimbeni ſays it was copied from a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vencial romance <note n="w" place="bottom">Iſtor. Volg. Poeſ. i. iv. p. 332.

But one of the moſt valuable pieces of the old French poetry is on the ſubject of this victorious monarch, entitled, <hi>Roman d' Alexandre.</hi> It has been called the ſecond poem now remaining in the French language, and was written about the year 1200.

Alexander's will, in which he nominates ſucceſſors to his provinces and kingdom, was a tradition commonly received, and is mentioned by Diodorus Siculus, and Ammianus Marcellinus.

It has been ſuppoſed, that before the appearance of this poem, the <hi>Romans,</hi> or thoſe pieces which celebrated GESTS, were conſtantly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in ſhort verſes of ſix or eight ſyllables: and that in this <hi>Roman d' Alexandre</hi> verſes of twelve ſyllables were firſt uſed. It has therefore been imagined, that the verſes called ALEXANDRINES, the preſent French heroic meaſure, took
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0373500101:306"/>
their riſe from this poem; Alexander being the hero, and Alexander the chief of the four poets concerned in the work. That the name, ſome centuries afterwards, might take place in honour of this celebrated and early effort of French poetry, I think is very probable; but that verſes of twelve ſyllables made their firſt appearance in this poem, is a doctrine which, to ſay no more, from examples already produced and examined, is at leaſt ambiguous <note n="d" place="bottom">See Pref. <hi>Le Roman de la Roſe,</hi> par Monſ.

In another place, from the ſame romance, he turns aſtronomer, and ſoars to the moon by the help of four gryphons.

            <p>Theſe were the four reigning ſtories of romance. On which perhaps Engliſh pieces, tranſlated from the French, exiſted before or about the year 1300.

            <p>BEUVES <hi>de Hanton,</hi> or <hi>Sir Beavis of Southampton,</hi> is a French romance of conſiderable antiquity, although the hero is not older than the Norman conqueſt. It is alluded to in

Bevis was a Saxon chieftain, who ſeems to have extended his dominion along the ſouthern coaſts of England, which he is ſaid to have defended againſt the Norman invaders.

            <p>GUY EARL OF WARWICK is recited as a French romance by Labbe <note n="n" place="bottom">Ubi ſupr.</note>. In the Britiſh Muſeum a metrical hiſtory in very old French appears, in which Felicia, or Felice, is called the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0373500101:308"/>
daughter of an earl of Warwick, and Guido, or Guy of Warwick, is the ſon of Seguart the earl's ſteward. The manuſcript is at preſent imperfect <note n="o" place="bottom">MSS. Harl. 3775. 2.</note>.

Again, <hi>Le Livre de Guy de Warwick et de Harold d' Ardenne</hi> 
               <note n="p" place="bottom">Catal. MSS. p. 792.</note>. This Harold d'Arden is a diſtinguiſhed warriour of Guy's hiſtory, and therefore his atchievements ſometimes form a ſeparate romance: as in the royal manuſcripts of the Britiſh Muſeum, where we find <hi>Le Romant de Herolt Dardenne</hi> 
               <note n="q" place="bottom">15 E. vi. 8. fol.</note>. In the Engliſh romance of Guy, mentioned at large in its proper place, this champion is called <hi>Syr Heraude of Arderne</hi> 
               <note n="r" place="bottom">Sign. L. ii. verſ.</note>. At length this favourite ſubject formed a large proſe ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, entitled <hi>Guy de Warwick Chevalier d'Angleterre et de la belle fille Felix ſamie,</hi> and printed at Paris in 1525 <note n="s" place="bottom">Fol.

This romance was compoſed, or perhaps enlarged, after the cruſades; as we find, that Guy's redoubted encounters with Colbrond the Daniſh giant, with the monſter of Dunſmore heath, and the dragon of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland, are by no means equal to ſome of his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements in the holy land, and the trophies which he won from the ſoldan under the command of the emperor Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick.</p>
            <p>The romance of SIDRAC, often entitled, <hi>Le Livere Sydrac le philoſophe le quel hom appele le livere de le funtane de totes Sciences,</hi> appears to have been very popular, from the preſent frequency of its manuſcripts. But it is rather a romance of Arabian philoſophy than of chivalry. It is a ſyſtem of natural knowledge, and particularly treats of the virtues of
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0373500101:309"/>
plants. Sidrac, the philoſopher of this ſyſtem, was aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomer to an eaſtern king. He lived eight hundred and forty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeven years after Noah, of whoſe book of aſtronomy he was poſſeſſed. He converts Bocchus, an idolatrous king of India, to the chriſtian faith, by whom he is invited to build a mighty tower againſt the invaſions of a rival king of India. But the hiſtory, no leſs than the ſubject of this piece, diſplays the ſtate, nature, and migrations of literature in the dark ages. After the death of Bocchus, Sidrac's book fell into the hands of a Chaldean renowned for piety. It then ſucceſſively becomes the property of king Madian, Namaan the Aſſyrian, and Grypho archbiſhop of Samaria. The latter had a prieſt named Demetrius, who brought it into Spain, and here it was tranſlated from the Greek into Latin. This tranſlation is ſaid to be made at Toledo, by Roger de Palermo, a mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite friar, in the thirteenth century. A king of Spain then commanded it to be tranſlated from Latin into Arabic, and ſent it as a moſt valuable preſent to Emir Elmomenim, lord of Tunis. It was next given to Frederick the Second, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of Germany, famous in the cruſades. This work, which is of conſiderable length, was tranſlated into Engliſh verſe, and will be mentioned on that account again. Sidrac is recited as an eminent philoſopher, with Seneca and king Solomon, in the <hi>Marchaunt's Second tale,</hi> aſcribed to Chau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer <note n="w" place="bottom">Urr. p. 616. v. 1932. There is an old tranſlation of SIDRAC into Dutch, MSS. Marſhall, Bibl. Bodl. 31. fol.</note>.</p>
            <p>It is natural to conclude, that moſt of theſe French ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances were current in England, either in the French ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals, which were well underſtood at leaſt by the more polite readers, or elſe by tranſlation or imitation, as I have before hinted, when the romance of <hi>Richard Cuer de Lyon,</hi> in whoſe prologue they are recited, was tranſlated into Engliſh. That the latter was the caſe as to ſome of them,

            <p>Various cauſes concurred, in the mean time, to multiply books of chivalry among the French, and to give them a ſuperiority over the Engliſh, not only in the number but in the excellence of thoſe compoſitions. Their barons lived in greater magnificence. Their feudal ſyſtem flouriſhed on a more ſumptuous, extenſive, and laſting eſtabliſhment. Schools were inſtituted in their caſtles for initiating the young nobility in the rules and practice of chivalry. Their tilts and tournaments were celebrated with a higher degree of pomp; and their ideas of honour and gallantry were more exaggerated and refined.</p>

We may add, what indeed has been before incidentally remarked, that their troubadours were the firſt writers of metrical romances. But by what has been here advanced, I do not mean to inſinuate without any reſtrictions, that the French entirely led the way in theſe compoſitions. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly the Provencial bards contributed much to the progreſs of Italian literature. Raimond the fourth of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon, count of Provence, about the year 1220, a lover and a judge of letters, invited to his court the moſt celebrated of the ſongſters who profeſſed to poliſh and adorn the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vencial language by various ſorts of poetry <note n="b" place="bottom">Giovan. Villani, Iſtor. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Charles the firſt, his ſon-in-law, and the inheritor of his virtues and dignities, conquered Naples, and carried into Italy a taſte for the Provencial literature. At Florence eſpecially this taſte prevailed, where he reigned many years with great ſplendour, and where his ſucceſſors reſided. Soon afterwards the Roman court was removed to Provence <note n="c" place="bottom">Villani acquaints us, that Brunetto Latini, Dante's maſter, was the firſt who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to poliſh the Florentines by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving their taſte and ſtyle; which he did by writing his grand work the TESORO in Provencial. He died in 1294. See Villan. ibid. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Provencial writers eſtabliſhed a common dialect: and their examples convinced other nations, that the modern languages were no leſs adapted to compoſition than thoſe of antiquity <note n="d" place="bottom">Dante deſigned at firſt that his <hi>Inferno,</hi> and Treatiſe on monarchy, ſhould appear in Latin. But finding that he could not ſo effectually in that language impreſs his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirical ſtrokes and political maxims on the laity, or illiterate, he altered his mind, and publiſhed thoſe pieces in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>talian. Had Petrarch written his <hi>Africa,</hi> his Eclogues, and his proſe compoſitions in Italian, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terature of his country would much ſooner have arrived at perfection.</note>. They introduced a love of reading, and diffuſed a general and popular taſte for poetry, by writing in a language intelligible to the ladies and the people. Their verſes being conveyed in a familiar tongue, became the chief amuſement of princes and feudal lords, whoſe courts had now begun to aſſume an air of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0373500101:313"/>
greater brilliancy: a circumſtance which neceſſarily gave great encouragement to their profeſſion, and by rendering theſe arts of ingenious entertainment univerſally faſhionable, imperceptibly laid the foundation of polite literature. From theſe beginnings it were eaſy to trace the progreſs of poetry to its perfection, through John de Meun in France, Dante in Italy, and Chaucer in England.</p>
            <p>This praiſe muſt undoubtedly be granted to the Provencial poets. But in the mean time, to recur to our original ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, we ſhould be cautious of aſſerting in general and indiſcriminating terms, that the Provencial poets were the firſt writers of metrical romance: at leaſt we ſhould aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, with rather more preciſion than has been commonly uſed on this ſubject, how far they may claim this merit. I am of opinion that there were two ſorts of French trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badours, who have not hitherto been ſufficiently diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed. If we diligently examine their hiſtory, we ſhall find that the poetry of the firſt troubadours conſiſted in ſatires, moral fables, allegories, and ſentimental ſonnets. So early as the year 1180, a tribunal called the <hi>Court of Love,</hi> was inſtituted both in Provence and Picardy, at which queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in gallantry were decided. This inſtitution furniſhed eternal matter for the poets, who threw the claims and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the different parties into verſe, in a ſtyle that afterwards led the way to the ſpiritual converſations of Cyrus and Clelia <note n="e" place="bottom">This part of their character will be inſiſted upon more at large when we come to ſpeak of Chaucer.</note>. Fontenelle does not ſcruple to acknowledge, that gallantry was the parent of French poetry <note n="f" place="bottom">Theatr. Fr. p. 13.</note>. But to ſing romantic and chivalrous adventures was a very different taſk, and required very different talents. The troubadours therefore who compoſed metrical romances form a different ſpecies, and ought always to be conſidered ſeparately. And
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0373500101:314"/>
this latter claſs ſeems to have commenced at a later period, not till after the cruſades had effected a great change in the manners and ideas of the weſtern world. In the mean time, I hazard a conjecture. Cinthio Giraldi ſuppoſes, that the art of the troubadours, commonly called the <hi>Gay Science,</hi> was firſt communicated from France to the Italians, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the Spaniards <note n="g" place="bottom">Apud Huet, Orig. Rom. p. 108.</note>. This perhaps may be true: but at the ſame time it is highly probable, as the Spaniards had their JUGLARES or convivial bards very early, as from long connection they were immediately and intimately acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the fictions of the Ara<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ians, and as they were naturally fond of chivalry, that the troubadours of Provence in great meaſure caught this turn of fabling from Spain. The communication, to mention no other obvious means of intercourſe in an affair of this nature, was eaſy through the ports of Toulon and Marſeilles, by which the two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions carried on from early times a conſtant commerce. Even the French critics themſelves univerſally allow, that the Spaniards, having learned rhyme from the Arabians, through this very channel conveyed it to Provence. Taſſo preferred <hi>Amadis de Gaul,</hi> a romance originally written in Spain, by Vaſco Lobeyra, before the year 1300 <note n="h" place="bottom">Nic. Antonius, Bibl. Hiſpan.

But this is a ſubject which will perhaps receive illuſtration from a writer of great taſte, talents, and induſtry, Monſieur de la Curne de Sainte Palaye, who will ſoon oblige the world with an ample hiſtory of Provencial poetry; and whoſe reſearches into a kindred ſubject, already publiſhed, have opened a new and extenſive field of information concerning the manners, inſtitutions, and literature of the feudal ages <note n="k" place="bottom">See <hi>Memoires ſur l'ancienne Chevalerie,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>VARIOUS matters ſuggeſted by the Prologue of RICHARD CUEUR DE LYON, cited in the laſt ſection, have betrayed us into a long digreſſion, and interrupted the regularity of our annals. But I could not neglect ſo fair an opportunity of preparing the reader for thoſe metrical tales, which having acquired a new caſt of fiction from the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſades and a magnificence of manners from the encreaſe of chivalry, now began to be greatly multiplied, and as it were profeſſedly to form a ſeparate ſpecies of poetry. I now therefore reſume the ſeries, and proceed to give ſome ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens of the Engliſh metrical romances which appeared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or about the reign of Edward the ſecond: and although moſt of theſe pieces continued to be ſung by the minſtrels in the halls of our magnificent anceſtors for ſome centuries afterwards, yet as their firſt appearance may moſt probably be dated at this period, they properly coincide in this place with the tenour of our hiſtory. In the mean time, it is natural to ſuppoſe, that by frequent repetition and ſucceſſive changes of language during many generations, their original ſimplicity muſt have been in ſome degree corrupted. Yet ſome of the ſpecimens are extracted from manuſcripts writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the reign of Edward the third. Others indeed from printed copies, where the editors took great liberties in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating the language to the times. However in ſuch as may be ſuppoſed to have ſuffered moſt from depravations of this ſort, the ſubſtance of the ancient ſtyle ſtill remains, and at leaſt the ſtructure of the ſtory. On the whole, we mean to give the reader an idea of thoſe popular heroic tales in verſe, profeſſedly written for the harp, which began to be multiplied among us about the beginning of the fourteenth

century. We will begin with the romance of RICHARD CUEUR DE LYON, already mentioned.</p>
            <p>The poem opens with the marriage of Richard's father, Henry the ſecond, with the daughter of Carbarryne, a king of Antioch. But this is only a lady of romance. Henry mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Eleanor the divorced queen of Louis of France. The minſtrels could not conceive any thing leſs than an eaſtern princeſs to be the mother of this magnanimous hero.</p>

This <hi>fyre grekys,</hi> or Grecian fire, ſeems to be a compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion belonging to the Arabian chemiſtry. It is frequently mentioned by the Byzantine hiſtorians, and was very much uſed in the wars of the middle ages, both by ſea and land. It was a ſort of wild-fire, ſaid to be inextinguiſhable by water, and chiefly uſed for burning ſhips, againſt which it was thrown in pots or phials by the hand. In land engagements it ſeems to have been diſcharged by machines conſtructed on purpoſe. The oriental Greeks pretended that this artificial fire was invented by Callinicus, an architect of Helio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis, under Conſtantine; and that Conſtantine prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited them from communicating the manner of making it to any foreign people. It was however in common uſe among the nations confederated with the Byzantines: and Anna Commena has given an account of its ingredients <note n="d" place="bottom">See Du Cange, Not. ad Joinvil. p. 71. And Gl. Lat. V. IGNIS GRAECUS.</note>, which were bitumen, ſulphur, and naptha. It is called <hi>feu gregois</hi> in the French chronicles and romances. Our minſtrell, I believe, is ſingular in ſaying that Richard ſcattered this fire on Saladin's ſhips: many monkiſh hiſtorians of the holy war, in deſcribing the ſiege of Acon, relate that it was em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ployed on that occaſion, and many others, by the Saracens againſt the Chriſtians <note n="e" place="bottom">See more particularly Chron.

            <p>Richard arming himſelf is a curious Gothic picture. It is certainly a genuine picture, and drawn with ſome ſpirit; as is the ſhock of the two necromantic ſteeds, and other parts of this deſcription. The combat of Richard and the Soldan, on the event of which the chriſtian army got poſſeſſion of the city of Babylon, is probably the DUEL OF KING RICHARD, painted on the walls of a chamber in the royal palace of Clarendon <note n="q" place="bottom">See ſupr. p. 114.</note>. The ſoldan is repreſented as meeting Richard with a hawk on his fiſt, to ſhew indifference, or a contempt of his adverſary; and that he came rather prepared for the chace, than the combat. Indeed in the feudal times, and long afterwards, no gentleman appeared on horſeback, unleſs going to battle, without a hawk on his fiſt. In the <hi>Tapeſtry of the Norman conqueſt,</hi> Harold is exhibited on horſeback, with a hawk on his fiſt, and his dogs running before him, going on an embaſſy from king Edward the Confeſſor to William Duke of Normandy <note n="r" place="bottom">The hawk on the fiſt was a mark of great nobility. We frequently find it, upon antique ſeals and miniatures, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to perſons of both ſexes. So ſacred was this bird eſteemed, that it was forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in a code of Charlemagne's laws, for any one to give his hawk or his ſword as part of his ranſom. <q rend="inline">"In compoſitionem Wirigildi volumus ut ea dentur quae in lege continentur excepto <hi>accipitre et ſpatha.</hi>"</q> Lindebrog.

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0373500101:347"/>
ſtudied, and the romantic poet ſought to gain new attention, and to recommend his ſtory, by giving it the advantage of a plan. Moſt of the old metrical romances are, from their nature, ſuppoſed to be incoherent rhapſodies. Yet many of them have a regular integrity, in which every part contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to produce an intended end. Through various obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and difficulties one point is kept in view, till the final and general cataſtrophe is brought about by a pleaſing and unexpected ſurpriſe. As a ſpecimen of the reſt, and as it lies in a narrow compaſs, I will develope the plan of the fable now before us, which preſerves at leaſt a coincidence of events, and an uniformity of deſign.</p>
            <p>A king's daughter of England, extremely beautiful, is ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited in marriage by numerous potentates of various king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. The king her father vows, that of all theſe ſuitors, that champion alone ſhall win his daughter who can unhorſe him at a tournament. This they all attempt, but in vain. The king every year aſſiſted at an anniverſary maſs for the ſoul of his deceaſed queen, who was interred in an abbey at ſome diſtance from his caſtle. In the journey thither, the princeſs ſtrays from her damſels in a ſolitary foreſt: ſhe is diſcovered by a knight in rich armour, who by many ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations prevails over her chaſtity, and, at parting, gives her a ſword without a point, which he charges her to keep ſafe; together with a pair of gloves, which will fit no hands but her own <note n="g" place="bottom">Gloves were antiently a coſtly article of dreſs, and richly decorated.

At length ſhe finds the road to her father's caſtle, where, after ſome time, to avoid diſcovery, ſhe is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly delivered of a boy. Soon after the delivery, the princeſs having carefully placed the child in a cradle, with twenty pounds in gold, ten pounds in ſilver, the gloves given her by the ſtrange knight, and a letter, conſigns him to one
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0373500101:348"/>
of her maidens, who carries him by night, and leaves him in a wood, near a hermitage, which ſhe diſcerned by the light of the moon. The hermit in the morning diſcovers the child; reads the letter, by which it appears that the gloves will fit no lady but the boy's mother, educates him till he is twenty years of age, and at parting gives him the gloves found with him in the cradle, telling him that they will fit no lady but his own mother. The youth, who is called Degore, ſets forward to ſeek adventures, and ſaves an earl from a terrible dragon, which he kills. The earl in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites him to his palace, dubs him a knight, gives him a horſe and armour, and offers him half his territory. Sir Degore refuſes to accept this offer, unleſs the gloves, which he had received from his foſter-father the hermit, will fit any lady of his court. All the ladies of the earl's court are called before him, and among the reſt the earl's daughter, but upon trial the gloves will fit none of them. He therefore takes leave of the earl, proceeds on his adventures, and meets with a large train of knights; he is informed that they were going to tourney with the king of England, who had promiſed his daughter to that knight who could conquer him in ſingle combat. They tell him of the many barons and earls whom the king had foiled in ſeveral trials. Sir Degore, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, enters the liſts, overthrows the king, and obtains the princeſs. As the knight is a perfect ſtranger, ſhe ſubmits to her father's commands with much reluctance. He marries her; but in the midſt of the ſolemnities which preceded the conſummation, recollects the gloves which the hermit had given him, and propoſes to make an experiment with them on the hands of his bride. The princeſs, on ſeeing the gloves, changed colour, claimed them for her own, and drew them on with the greateſt eaſe. She declares to Sir Degore that ſhe was his mother, and gives him an account of his birth: ſhe told him that the knight his father gave her a pointleſs ſword, which was to be delivered to no perſon but the ſon
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0373500101:349"/>
that ſhould be born of their ſtolen embraces. Sir Degore draws the ſword, and contemplates its breadth and length with wonder: is ſuddenly ſeized with a deſire of finding out his father. He ſets forward on this ſearch, and on his way enters a caſtle, where he is entertained at ſupper by fifteen beautiful damſels. The lady of the caſtle invites him to her bed, but in vain; and he is lulled aſleep by the ſound of a harp. Various artifices are uſed to divert him from his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, and the lady even engages him to encounter a giant in her cauſe <note n="h" place="bottom">All the romances have ſuch an obſtacle as this. They have all an enchantreſs, who detains the knight from his queſt by objects of pleaſure; and who is nothing more than the Calypſo of Homer, the Dido of Virgil, and the Armida of Taſſo.</note>. But Sir Degore rejects all her temptations, and purſues his journey. In a foreſt he meets a knight richly accoutred, who demands the reaſon why Sir Degore preſumed to enter his foreſt without permiſſion. A combat enſues. In the midſt of the conteſt, the combatants being both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſed, the ſtrange knight obſerving the ſword of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary not only to be remarkably long and broad, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a point, begs a truce for a moment. He fits the ſword to a point which he had always kept, and which had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly broken off in an encounter with a giant; and by this circumſtance diſcovers Sir Degore to be his ſon. They both return into England, and Sir Degore's father is married to the princeſs his mother.</p>

IPOMEDON is mentioned among the romances in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of RICHARD CUER DE LYON; which, in an antient copy of the Britiſh muſeum, is called SYR IPOMYDON: a name borrowed from the Theban war, and transferred here to a tale of the feudal times <note n="r" place="bottom">MSS. Harl. 2252. 44. f. 54. And in the library of Lincoln cathedral, (K k. 3. 10.) is an ancient imperfect printed copy, wanting the firſt ſheet.</note>. This piece is evidently derived from a French original. Our hero Ippomedon is ſon of Ermones king of Apulia, and his miſtreſs is the fair heireſs of Calabria. About the year 1230, William Ferra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bras <note n="s" place="bottom">Bras de fer. <hi>Iron arms.</hi>
               </note>, and his brethren, ſons of Tancred the Norman, and well known in the romantic hiſtory of the Paladins, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the ſignories of Apulia and Calabria. But our Engliſh romance ſeems to be immediately tranſlated from the French; for Ermones is called king of <hi>Poyle,</hi> or Apulia, which in French is <hi>Pouille.</hi> I have tranſcribed ſome of the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting paſſages <note n="t" place="bottom">MSS. f. 55.</note>.</p>
            <p>Ippomedon, although the ſon of a king, is introduced waiting in his father's hall, at a grand feſtival. This ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude was ſo far from being diſhonourable, that it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways required as a preparatory ſtep to knighthood <note n="u" place="bottom">See p. ſupr.</note>.</p>

See alſo p. 24. ibid.</p>
                  <p>As to Sir <hi>Ippotis,</hi> an antient poem with that title occurs in manuſcript, MSS. Cotton, Calig. A. 2. f. 77. and MS. Vernon, f. 296. But as Chaucer is ſpeaking of romances of chivalry, which he means to ridicule, and this is a religious legend, it may be doubted whether this is the piece alluded to by Chaucer. However I will here exhibit a ſpecimen of it from the exordium. MS. Vernon, f. 296.</p>

is neither my inclination nor intention to write a catalogue, or compile a miſcellany. It is not to be expected that this work ſhould be a general repoſitory of our antient poetry. I cannot however help obſerving, that Engliſh literature and
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0373500101:374"/>
Engliſh poetry ſuffer, while ſo many pieces of this kind ſtill remain concealed and forgotten in our manuſcript libraries. They contain in common with the proſe-romances, to moſt of which indeed they gave riſe, amuſing images of antient cuſtoms and inſtitutions, not elſewhere to be found, or at leaſt not otherwiſe ſo ſtrikingly delineated: and they preſerve pure and unmixed, thoſe fables of chivalry which formed the taſte and awakened the imagination of our elder Engliſh claſſics. The antiquaries of former times overlooked or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected theſe valuable remains, which they deſpiſed as falſe and frivolous; and employed their induſtry in reviving ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure fragments of uninſtructive morality or unintereſting hiſtory. But in the preſent age we are beginning to make ample amends: in which the curioſity of the antiquarian is connected with taſte and genius, and his reſearches tend to diſplay the progreſs of human manners, and to illuſtrate the hiſtory of ſociety.</p>
            <p>As a further illuſtration of the general ſubject, and many particulars, of this ſection and the three laſt, I will add a new proof of the reverence in which ſuch ſtories were held, and of the familiarity with which they muſt have been known, by our anceſtors. Theſe fables were not only perpetually repeated at their feſtivals, but were the conſtant objects of their eyes. The very walls of their apartments were clothed with ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic hiſtory. Tapeſtry was antiently the faſhionable fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture of our houſes, and it was chiefly filled with lively repreſentations of this ſort.

            <p>Edward the ſecond is ſaid to have carried with him to the ſiege of Stirling caſtle, in Scotland, a poet named Robert Baſton. He was a Carmelite friar of Scarborough; and the king intended that Baſton, being an eye-witneſs of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, ſhould celebrate his conqueſt of Scotland in verſe. Hollingſhead, an hiſtorian not often remarkable for pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, mentions this circumſtance as a ſingular proof of Edward's preſumption and confidence in his undertaking againſt Scotland: but a poet ſeems to have been a ſtated officer in the royal retinue when the king went to war <note n="g" place="bottom">Leland. Script. Brit. p. 338. Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingſh. Hiſt. ii. p. 217. 220.

<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0373500101:398"/>
the Latin tongue, deſerve notice in inveſtigating the progreſs of our poetry. For the ſame reaſon I muſt not paſs over a Latin piece, called a comedy, written in this reign, perhaps by Peter Babyon; who by Bale is ſtyled an admirable rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rician and poet, and flouriſhed about the year 1317. This comedy is thus entitled in the Bodleian manuſcript, <hi>De Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bione et Croceo domino Babionis et Viola filiaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

It is written in long and ſhort Latin verſes, without any appearance of dialogue. In what manner, if ever, this piece was repreſented theatrically, cannot eaſily be diſcovered or aſcertained. Unleſs we ſuppoſe it to have been recited by one or more of the characters concerned, at ſome public entertainment. The ſtory is in Gower's CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FESSIO AMANTIS. Whether Gower had it from this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance I will not enquire. It appears at leaſt that he took it from ſome previous book.</p>
            <q>
               <l>I find writte of Babio,</l>
               <l>Which had a love at his menage,</l>
               <l>Ther was no fairer of hir age,</l>
               <l>And hight Viola by name, &amp;c.</l>
               <l>And had affaited to his hande</l>

            </q>
            <p>In the mean time it ſeems moſt probable, that this piece has been attributed to Peter Babyon, on account of the likeneſs of the name BABIO, eſpecially as he is a ridiculous character. On the whole, there is nothing dramatic in the ſtructure of this nominal comedy; and it has certainly no claim to that title, only as it contains a familiar and comic ſtory carried
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0373500101:399"/>
on with much ſcurrilous ſatire intended to raiſe mirth. But it was not uncommon to call any ſhort poem, not ſerious or tragic, a comedy. In the Bodleian manuſcript, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends Babyon's poem juſt mentioned, there follows CO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MEDIA DE GETA: this is in Latin long and ſhort verſes <note n="n" place="bottom">Carmina compoſuit, voluitque placere poeta.</note>, and has no marks of dialogue <note n="o" place="bottom">f. 121.</note>. In the library of Corpus Chriſti college at Cambridge, is a piece entitled, COMEDIA <hi>ad monaſterium de Hulme ordinis S. Benedicti Dioceſ.

            <p>It is certain, that theſe MIRACLE-PLAYS were the firſt of our dramatic exhibitions. But as theſe pieces frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the introduction of allegorical characters, ſuch as Charity, Sin, Death, Hope, Faith, or the like, and as the common poetry of the times, eſpecially among the French, began to deal much in allegory, at length plays were formed entirely conſiſting of ſuch perſonifications. Theſe were called MORALITIES. The miracle-plays, or MYSTERIES, were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally deſtitute of invention or plan: they tamely repreſented ſtories according to the letter of ſcripture, or the reſpective legend. But the MORALITIES indicate dawnings of the dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic art: they contain ſome rudiments of a plot, and even attempt to delineate characters, and to paint manners. From hence the gradual tranſition to real hiſtorical perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages was natural and obvious. It may be alſo obſerved, that many licentious pleaſantries were ſometimes introduced in theſe religious repreſentations. This might imperceptibly lead the way to ſubjects entirely profane, and to comedy, and perhaps earlier than is imagined. In a<note n="r" place="bottom">MSS. Digb. 134. Bibl.

This tragical buſineſs is treated with the moſt ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous levity. The good women of Bethlehem attack our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0373500101:408"/>
that ſubjects of ſcripture hiſtory would be ſupported with proper dignity. But then an enlightened age would not have choſen ſuch ſubjects for theatrical exhibition. It is certain that our anceſtors intended no ſort of impiety by theſe monſtrous and unnatural mixtures. Neither the writers nor the ſpectators ſaw the impropriety, nor paid a ſeparate attention to the comic and the ſrious part of theſe motley ſcenes; at leaſt they were perſuaded that the ſolemnity of the ſubject covered or excuſed all incongruities. They had no juſt idea of decorum, conſequently but little ſenſe of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous: what appears to us to be the higheſt burleſque, on them would have made no ſort of impreſſion. We muſt not wonder at this, in an age when courage, devotion, and ignorance, compoſed the character of European manners; when the knight going to a tournament, firſt invoked his God, then his miſtreſs, and afterwards proceeded with a ſafe conſcience and great reſolution to engage his antagoniſt.

Adam and Eve appear naked and <hi>not aſhamed,</hi> and the old ſerpent enters lamenting his fall. He converſes with Eve.

their nakedneſs: this very pertinently introduces the next ſcene, in which they have coverings of fig-leaves. This extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſpectacle was beheld by a numerous aſſembly of both ſexes with great compoſure: they had the authority of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for ſuch a repreſentation, and they gave matters juſt as they found them in the third chapter of Geneſis. It would have been abſolute hereſy to have departed from the ſacred text in perſonating the primitive appearance of our firſt parents, whom the ſpectators ſo nearly reſembled in ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity: and if this had not been the caſe, the dramatiſts were ignorant what to reject and what to retain.</p>

            <p>In France the religious MYSTERIES, often called PITEAUX, or PITOUX, were certainly very faſhionable, and of high antiquity: yet from any written evidence, I do not find them more antient than thoſe of the Engliſh.

But the French MYSTERIES were chiefly performed by the religious communities, and ſome of their FETES almoſt entirely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of a dramatic or perſonated ſhew. At the FLAST of ASSES, inſtituted in honour of Baalam's Aſs, the clergy walked on Chriſtmas day in proceſſion, habited to repreſent the prophets and others. Moſes appeared in an alb and cope, with a long beard and rod. David had a green veſtment. Baalam with an immenſe pair of ſpurs, rode on a wooden aſs, which incloſed a ſpeaker. There were alſo ſix Jews and ſix Gentiles. Among other characters the poet Virgil was introduced as a gentile prophet and a tranſlator of the Sibylline oracles. They thus moved in proceſſion, chanting verſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and converſing in character on the nativity and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt, through the body of the church, till they came into the choir.

to deduce the practice of our plays being acted by the choir-boys of St. Paul's church, and the chapel royal, which continued, as I before obſerved, till Cromwell's uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Engliſh and French ſtages mutually throw light on each other's hiſtory. But perhaps it will be thought, that in ſome of theſe inſtances I have exemplified in nothing more than farcical and geſticulatory repreſentations. Yet even theſe traces ſhould be attended to. In the mean time we may obſerve upon the whole, that the modern drama had its foundation in our religion, and that it was raiſed and ſupported by the clergy. The truth is, the members of the eccleſiaſtical ſocieties were almoſt the only perſons who could read, and their numbers eaſily furniſhed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers: they abounded in leiſure, and their very relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were religious.</p>

            <p>EDWARD the third was an illuſtrious example and patron of chivalry. His court was the theatre of ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic elegance. I have examined the annual rolls of his wardrobe, which record various articles of coſtly ſtuffs deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered occaſionally for the celebration of his tournaments; ſuch as ſtandards, pennons, tunics, capariſons, with other ſplendid furniture of the ſame ſort: and it appears that he commanded theſe ſolemnities to be kept, with a magnificence ſuperior to that of former ages, at Litchfield, Bury, Guild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Eltham, Canterbury, and twice at Windſor, in little more than the ſpace of one year <note n="a" place="bottom">Comp.

At his triumphant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from Scotland, he was met by two hundred and thirty knights at Dunſtable, who received their victorious monarch with a grand exhibition of theſe martial exerciſes.

of king Arthur <note n="b" place="bottom">Walſing, p. 117.</note>. Anſtis treats the notion, that Edward in this eſtabliſhment had any retroſpect to king Arthur, as an idle and legendary tradition <note n="c" place="bottom">Ord. Gart. ii. 92.</note>. But the fame of Arthur was ſtill kept alive, and continued to be an object of veneration long afterwards: and however idle and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous the fables of the round table may appear at preſent, they were then not only univerſally known, but firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved. Nothing could be more natural to ſuch a romantic monarch, in ſuch an age, than the renovation of this moſt antient and revered inſtitution of chivalry. It was a prelude to the renowned order of the garter, which he ſoon after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards founded at Windſor, during the ceremonies of a magnificent feaſt, which had been proclaimed by his heralds in Germany, France, Scotland, Burgundy, Heynault, and Brabant, and laſted fifteen days <note n="d" place="bottom">Barnes, i. ch. 22. p. 292.

In the mean time riches and plenty, the effects of conqueſt, peace, and proſperity, were ſpread on every ſide; and new luxuries were imported in great abundance from the conquered countries.

See more in Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the Fairy Queen, ii. §. xi. p. 281.</note>. This poem contains a ſeries of diſtinct viſions, which the author imagines himſelf to have ſeen, while he was ſleeping, after a long ramble on Malverne-hills in Worceſterſhire. It is a ſatire on the vices of almoſt every profeſſion: but particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly on the corruptions of the clergy, and the abſurdities of ſuperſtition. Theſe are ridiculed with much humour and ſpirit, couched under a ſtrong vein of allegorical invention. But inſtead of availing himſelf of the riſing and rapid im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements of the Engliſh language, Longland prefers and adopts the ſtyle of the Anglo-Saxon poets. Nor did he make theſe writers the models of his language only: he likewiſe imitates their alliterative verſification, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in uſing an aggregate of words beginning with the ſame letter. He has therefore rejected rhyme, in the place of which he thinks it ſufficient to ſubſtitute a perpetual al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literation. But this impoſed conſtraint of ſeeking identical initials, and the affectation of obſolete Engliſh, by demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a conſtant and neceſſary departure from the natural and obvious forms of expreſſion, while it circumſcribed the powers of our author's genius, contributed alſo to render his
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0373500101:432"/>
manner extremely perplexed, and to diſguſt the reader with obſcurities. The ſatire is conducted by the agency of ſeveral allegorical perſonages, ſuch as Avarice, Bribery, Simony, Theology, Conſcience, &amp;c. There is much imagination in the following picture, which is intended to repreſent human life, and its various occupations.</p>

               <l>To Wy and to Wincheſter <note n="h" place="bottom">
                     <p>Antiently, before many flouriſhing towns were eſtabliſhed, and the neceſſaries or ornaments of life, from the convenience of communication and the encreaſe of provincial civility, could be procured in various places, goods and commodities of every kind, were chiefly ſold at fairs; to which, as to one univerſal mart, the people reſorted periodically, and ſupplied moſt of their wants for the enſuing year. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play of merchandiſe, and the conflux of cuſtomers, at theſe principal and almoſt only emporia of domeſtic commerce, was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious: and they were therefore often held on open and extenſive plains. One of the chief of them ſeems to have been that of St. Giles's hill or down near Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter, to which our poet here refers. It was inſtituted and given as a kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue to the biſhop of Wincheſter, by William the conqueror; who by his charter permitted it to continue for three days. But in conſequence of new royal grants, Henry the third prolonged its continuance to ſixteen days. Its juriſdiction extended ſeven miles round, and comprehended even Southampton, then a capital trading town: and all merchants who ſold wares within that circuit, forfeited them to the biſhop. Officers were placed at a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſtance, at bridges and other avenues of acceſs to the fair, to exact toll of all merchandiſe paſſing that way. In the mean time, all ſhops in the city of Wincheſter were ſhut. In the fair was a court called the pavilion, at which the biſhop's juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciaries and other officers aſſiſted, with power to try cauſes of v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rious ſorts for ſeven miles round: nor among other ſingular claims could any lord of a manor hold a court-baron within the ſaid circuit, without licence from the pavilion. During this time, the biſhop was empowered to take toll of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>very load or parcel of goods paſſing through the gates of the city. On Saint Giles's eve, the mayor, bailiffs, and citizens of the city of Wincheſter, delivered the keys of the
four city gates to the biſhop's officers; who, during the ſaid ſixteen days, appointed a mayor and bailiff of their own to govern the city, and alſo a coroner to act within the ſaid city. Tenants of the biſhop, who held lands by doing ſervice at the pavilion, attended the ſame with horſes and armour, not only to do ſuit at the court there, but to be ready to aſſiſt the biſhop's officers in the execution of writs and other ſervices. But I cannot here enumerate the many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary privileges granted to the biſhop on this occaſion; all tending to obſtruct trade, and to oppreſs the people. Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous foreign merchants frequented this fair: and it appears, that the juſticiaries of the pavilion, and the treaſurer of the biſhop's palace of Wolveſey, received annually for a fee, according to antient cuſtom, four baſons and ewers, of thoſe foreign mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants who ſold braſen veſſels in the fair, and were called <hi>mercat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It is not improbable, that Longland here had his eye on the old French ROMAN D' ANTECHRIST, a poem written by Huon de Meri, about the year 1228. The author of this piece ſuppoſes that Antichriſt is on earth, that he viſits every profeſſion and order of life, and finds numerous par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſans. The VICES arrange themſelves under the banner of ANTECHRIST, and the VIRTUES under that of CHRIST.

            <p>TO the VISION OF PIERCE PLOWMAN has been commonly annexed a poem called PIERCE THE PLOWMAN'S CREDE, and which may properly be conſidered as its appendage <note n="a" place="bottom">The firſt edition is by R. Wolfe, Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, 1553. 4<hi rend="sup">to</hi>. In four ſheets. It was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed, and added to Rogers's, or the fourth edition of the <hi>Viſion,</hi> 1561. It was evidently written after the year 1384.

See alſo Fuller's Worth. p. 8. <hi>Wales.</hi> The reader will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don this ſmall anticipation for the ſake of connection.</note>. It is profeſſedly written in imitation of our VISION, but by a different hand. The author, in the character of a plain uninformed perſon, pretends to be ignorant of his creed; to be inſtructed in the articles of which, he applies by turns to the four orders of mendicant friers. This circumſtance affords an obvious occaſion of expoſing in lively colours the tricks of thoſe ſocieties. After ſo unexpected a diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he meets one Pierce, or Peter, a plowman, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves his doubts, and teaches him the principles of true religion. In a copy of the CREDE lately preſented to me by the biſhop of Glouceſter, and once belonging to Mr. Pope, the latter in his own hand has inſerted the following abſtract of its plan. <q rend="inline">"An ignorant plain man having learned his Pater-noſter and Ave-mary, wants to learn his creed. He aſks ſeveral religious men of the ſeveral orders to teach it him. Firſt of a friar Minor, who bids him beware of the Carmelites, and aſſures him they can teach him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, deſcribing their faults, &amp;c. But that the friars Minors ſhall ſave him, whether he learns his creed or not.
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0373500101:453"/>
He goes next to the friars Preachers, whoſe magnificent monaſtery he deſcribes: there he meets a fat friar, who declaims againſt the Auguſtines. He is ſhocked at his pride, and goes to the Auguſtines. They rail at the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norites. He goes to the Carmes; they abuſe the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, but promiſe him ſalvation, without the creed, for money. He leaves them with indignation, and finds an honeſt poor PLOWMAN in the field, and tells him how he was diſappointed by the four orders. The plowman an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers with a long invective againſt them."</q>
            </p>
            <p>The language of the CREDE is leſs embarraſſed and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure than that of the VISION. But before I proceed to a ſpecimen, it may not be perhaps improper to prepare the reader, by giving an outline of the conſtitution and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the four orders of mendicant friars, the object of our poet's ſatire: an enquiry in many reſpects connected with the general purport of this hiſtory, and which, in this place at leaſt, cannot be deemed a digreſſion, as it will il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate the main ſubject, and explain many particular paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, of the PLOWMAN'S CREDE <note n="b" place="bottom">And of ſome perhaps quoted above from the VISION.</note>.</p>
            <p>Long before the thirteenth century, the monaſtic orders, as we have partly ſeen in the preceding poem, in conſequence of their ample revenues, had degenerated from their primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive auſterity, and were totally given up to luxury and indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Hence they became both unwilling and unable to execute the purpoſes of their eſtabliſhment: to inſtruct the people, to check the growth of hereſies, or to promote in any reſpect the true intereſts of the church. They forſook all their religious obligations, deſpiſed the authority of their ſuperiors, and were abandoned without ſhame or remorſe to every ſpecies of diſſipation and licentiouſneſs. About the beginning therefore of the thirteenth century, the condition and circumſtances of the church rendered it abſolutely neceſſary
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0373500101:454"/>
to remedy theſe evils, by introducing a new order of religious, who being deſtitute of fixed poſſeſſions, by the ſeverity of their manners, a profeſſed contempt of riches, and an unwearied perſeverance in the duties of preaching and prayer, might reſtore reſpect to the monaſtic inſtitution, and recover the honours of the church. Theſe were the four orders of mendicant or begging friars, commonly deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated the Franciſcans, the Dominicans, the Carmelites, and the Auguſtines <note n="d" place="bottom">The Franciſcans were often ſtyled friars-minors, or minorites, and grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friars: the Dominicans, friars-preachers, and ſometimes black-friars: The Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites white-friars; and the Auſtins grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friars. The firſt eſtabliſhment of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicans in England was at Oxford in 1221. Of the Franciſcans at Canterbury. Theſe two were the moſt eminent of the four orders. The Dominican friary at Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford ſtood in an iſland on the ſouth of the city, ſouth-weſt of the Franciſcan friary, the ſite of which is hereafter deſcribed.</note>.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſocieties ſoon ſurpaſſed all the reſt, not only in the purity of their lives, but in the number of their privileges, and the multitude of their members. Not to mention the ſucceſs which attends all novelties, their reputation aroſe quickly to an amazing height. The popes, among other uncommon immunities, allowed them the liberty of travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling wherever they pleaſed, of converſing with perſons of all ranks, of inſtructing the youth and the people in general, and of hearing confeſſions, without reſerve or reſtriction: and as on theſe occaſions, which gave them opportunities of appearing in public and conſpicuous ſituations, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited more ſtriking marks of gravity and ſanctity than were obſervable in the deportment and conduct of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of other monaſteries, they were regarded with the higheſt eſteem and veneration throughout all the countries of Europe.</p>
            <p>In the mean time they gained ſtill greater reſpect, by cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivating the literature then in vogue, with the greateſt aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duity and ſucceſs. Gianoni ſays, that moſt of the theological
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:0373500101:455"/>
profeſſors in the univerſity of Naples, newly founded in the year 1220, were choſen from the mendicants <note n="e" place="bottom">Hiſt. Nap. xvi. 3.</note>. They were the principal teachers of theology at Paris, the ſchool where this ſcience had received its origin <note n="f" place="bottom">See Boul. Hiſt. Academ. Pariſ. iii. p. 138. 240. 244. 248, &amp;c.</note>. At Oxford and Cambridge reſpectively, all the four orders had flouriſhing monaſteries. The moſt learned ſcholars in the univerſity of Oxford, at the cloſe of the thirteenth century, were Franciſcan friars: and long after this period, the Franciſcans appear to have been the ſole ſupport and ornament of that univerſity <note n="g" place="bottom">
                  <p>This circumſtance in ſome degree rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the monks from their indolence, and induced the greater monaſteries to procure the foundation of ſmall colleges in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities for the education of their novices. At Oxford the monks had alſo ſchools which bore the name of their reſpective orders: and there were ſchools in that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity which were appropriated to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar monaſteries. Kennet's Paroch. Ant. p. 214. Wood, Hiſt. Ant. Univ. Oxon. i. 119. Leland ſays, that even in his time, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Itin. vi. p. 21. And it appears, that the greater part of the proceeders in theology at Oxford and Cambridge, juſt before the reformation, were monks. But we do not find, that in conſequence of all theſe efforts, the monks made a much greater figure in literature.</p>
                  <p>In this rivalry which ſubſiſted between the mendicants and the monks, the latter ſometimes availed themſelves of their riches: and with a view to attract popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and to eclipſe the growing luſtre of the former, proceeded to their degrees in the univerſities with prodigious parade. In the year 1298, William de Brooke, a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictine of Saint Peter's abbey at Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter, took the degree of doctor in divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity at Oxford. He was attended on this important occaſion by the abbot and whole convent of Glouceſter, the abbots of Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter, Reading, Abingdon, Eveſham, and Malmeſbury, with one hundred noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and eſquires, on horſes richly capari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned. Theſe were entertained at a ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous feaſt in the refectory of Glouceſter college. But it ſhould be obſerved, that he was the firſt of the Benedictine order that attained this dignity. Wood, Hiſt. Ant. Univ. Oxon. i. 25. col. 1. See alſo Stevens, Mon. 1. 70.</p>

Among many other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which might be given of the learning of the mendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants, there is one which greatly contributed to eſtabliſh their literary character. In the eleventh century, Ariſtotle's philoſophy had been condemned in the univerſity of Paris as heretical. About a hundred years afterwards, theſe prejudices began to ſubſide; and new tranſlations of Ariſtotle's writings were publiſhed in Latin by our countryman Michael Scotus, and others, with more attention to the original Greek, at leaſt without the pompous and perplexed circumlocutions which appeared in the Arabic verſions hitherto uſed. In the mean time the mendicant orders ſprung up: who hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily availing themſelves of theſe new tranſlations, and making them the conſtant ſubject of their ſcholaſtic lectures, were the firſt who revived the doctrines of this philoſopher, and acquired the merit of having opened a new ſyſtem of ſcience <note n="t" place="bottom">See Joann.

            <p>The buildings of the mendicant monaſteries, eſpecially in England, were remarkably magnificent, and commonly much exceeded thoſe of the endowed convents of the ſecond mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude. As theſe fraternities were profeſſedly poor, and could not from their original inſtitution receive eſtates, the munificence of their benefactors was employed in adorning their houſes with ſtately refectories and churches: and for theſe and other purpoſes they did nor want addreſs to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure multitudes of patrons, which was facilitated by the notion of their ſuperior ſanctity. It was faſhionable for perſons of the higheſt rank to bequeath their bodies to be buried in the friary churches, which were conſequently filled with ſumptuous ſhrines and ſuperb monuments <note n="w" place="bottom">Their churches were eſteemed more ſacred than others.</note>. In the
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:0373500101:459"/>
noble church of the Grey friars in London, finiſhed in the year 1325, but long ſince deſtroyed, four queens, beſides upwards of ſix hundred perſons of quality, were buried, whoſe beautiful tombs remained till the diſſolution <note n="x" place="bottom">Weav. Fun. Mon. p. 388.</note>. Theſe interments imported conſiderable ſums of money into the mendicant ſocieties. It is probable that they derived more benefit from caſual charity, than they would have gained from a regular endowment. The Franciſcans indeed enjoyed from the popes the privilege of diſtributing indulgences, a valuable indemnification for their voluntary poverty <note n="y" place="bottom">See Baluz. Miſcellan. tom. iv. 490. vii. 392.</note>.</p>
            <p>On the whole, two of theſe mendicant inſtitutions, the Dominicans and the Franciſcans, for the ſpace of near three centuries, appear to have governed the European church and ſtate with an abſolute and univerſal ſway: they filled, during that period, the moſt eminent eccleſiaſtical and civil ſtations, taught in the univerſities with an authority which ſilenced all oppoſition, and maintained the diſputed prerogative of the Roman pontiff againſt the united influence of prelates and kings, with a vigour only to be paralleled by its ſucceſs. The Dominicans and Franciſcans were, before the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, exactly what the Jeſuits have been ſince. They diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded their monaſtic character and profeſſion, and were employed, not only in ſpiritual matters, but in temporal affairs of the greateſt conſequence; in compoſing the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of princes, concluding treaties of peace, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certing alliances: they preſided in cabinet councils, levied national ſubſidies, influenced courts, and managed the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines of every important operation and event, both in the religious and political world.</p>
            <p>From what has been here ſaid it is natural to ſuppoſe, that the mendicants at length became univerſally odious. The high eſteem in which they were held, and the tranſcendent degree of authority which they had aſſumed, only ſerved to
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:0373500101:460"/>
render them obnoxious to the clergy of every rank, to the monaſteries of other orders, and to the univerſities. It was not from ignorance, but from a knowledge of mankind, that they were active in propagating ſuperſtitious notions, which they knew were calculated to captivate the multitude, and to ſtrengthen the papal intereſt; yet at the ſame time, from the vanity of diſplaying an uncommon ſagacity of thought, and a ſuperior ſkill in theology, they affected no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties in doctrine, which introduced dangerous errors, and tended to ſhake the pillars of orthodoxy. Their ambition was unbounded, and their arrogance intolerable. Their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing numbers became, in many ſtates, an enormous and unweildy burthen to the commonwealth. They had abuſed the powers and privileges which had been entruſted to them; and the common ſenſe of mankind could not long be blinded or deluded by the palpable frauds and artifices, which theſe rapacious zealots ſo notoriouſly practiſed for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching their convents. In England, the univerſity of Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford reſolutely reſiſted the perpetual encroachments of the Dominicans <note n="z" place="bottom">Wood, ut ſupr. i. 150. 154. 196.</note>; and many of our theologiſts attacked all the four orders with great vehemence and ſeverity. Excluſive of the jealouſies and animoſities which naturally ſubſiſted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween four rival inſtitutions, their viſionary refinements, and love of diſputation, introduced among them the moſt violent diſſenſions. The Dominicans aimed at popularity, by an obſtinate denial of the immaculate conception. Their pretended ſanctity became at length a term of reproach, and their learning fell into diſcredit. As polite letters and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral knowledge encreaſed, their ſpeculative and pedantic divinity gave way to a more liberal turn of thinking, and a more perſpicuous mode of writing. Bale, who was himſelf a Carmelite friar, ſays, that his order, which was eminently diſtinguiſhed for ſcholaſtic erudition, began to loſe their eſtimation about the year 1460. Some of them were imprudent
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0373500101:461"/>
enough to engage openly in political controverſy; and the Auguſtines deſtroyed all their repute and authority in England by ſeditious ſermons, in which they laboured <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

About the year 1530, Leland viſited the Franciſcan friary at Oxford, big with the hopes of finding, in their celebrated library, if not many valuable books, at leaſt thoſe which had been bequeathed by the learned biſhop Groſthead.

The roof of the church of Caſſino in Italy is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be painted in 1349, like that of St. John Lateran at Rome. Hiſt. Caſſin. tom. ii. p. 545. col. 1.

I ſuppoſe, becauſe the walls of theſe apartments were reſpectively adorned with paintings of each. Geneura is Arthur's queen. In the pipe-rolls of Henry the third we have this notice, A. D. 1259. <q rend="inline">"Infra portam caſtri et birbecanam, etc. ab exitu CAMERAE ROSAMUNDAE uſque capel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam ſancti Thomae in Caſtro Wynton."</q> Rot. Pip. Henr. iii. an. 43. This I once ſuppoſed to be a chamber in Wincheſter caſtle, ſo called becauſe it was painted with the figure or ſome hiſtory of fair Roſamond. But a ROSAMUND-CHAMBER was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon apartment in the royal caſtles, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in imitation of her BOWER at Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock, literally nothing more than a <hi>cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> which yet was curiouſly conſtructed and decorated, at leaſt in memory of it.

This was a recent and notorious inſtance. But in this appointment the king probably paid a compliment to that prelate's ſingular talents for buſineſs, his activity, circumſpection, and management, rather than to any ſcientific and profeſſed ſkill in architecture which he might have poſſeſſed. It ſeems to me that he was only a ſuperviſor or comptroller on this occaſion. It was common to depute churchmen to this department, from an idea of their ſuperior prudence and probity. Thus John, the prior of St. Swithin's at Wincheſter in 1280, is commiſſioned by brief from the king, to ſuperviſe large repairs done by the ſheriff in the caſtle of Wincheſter, and the royal manor of Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.

among other things, that the clergy ſhould not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs eſtates, that the eccleſiaſtical ceremonies obſtructed true devotion, and that mendicant friars, the particular object of our Plowman's CREDE, were a public and inſupportable grievance. But Wickliffe, whom Mr. Hume pronounces to have been an enthuſiaſt, like many other reformers, carried his ideas of purity too far; and, as at leaſt it appears from the two firſt of theſe opinions, under the deſign of deſtroying ſuperſtition, his undiſtinguiſhing zeal attacked even the neceſſary aids of religion. It was certainly a lucky circumſtance, that Wickliffe quarrelled with the pope. His attacks on ſuperſtition at firſt probably proceeded from reſentment. Wickliffe, who was profeſſor of divinity at Oxford, finding on many occaſions not only his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince invaded, but even the privileges of the univerſity fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently violated by the pretenſions of the mendicants, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified his warmth of temper by throwing out ſome ſlight cenſures againſt all the four orders, and the popes their principal patrons and abettors. Soon afterwards he was deprived of the wardenſhip of Canterbury hall, by the arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of Canterbury, who ſubſtituted a monk in his place. Upon this he appealed to the pope, who confirmed the archie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal ſentence, by way of rebuke for the freedom with which he had treated the monaſtic profeſſion. Wickliffe, highly exaſperated at this uſage, immediately gave a looſe to his indignation, and without reſtraint or diſtinction attacked
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:0373500101:475"/>
in numerous ſermons and treatiſes, not only the ſcandalous enormities of the whole body of monks, but even the uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations of the pontifical power itſelf, with other eccleſiaſtical corruptions. Having expoſed theſe palpable abuſes with a juſt abhorrence, he ventured ſtill farther, and proceeded to examine and refute with great learning and penetration the abſurd doctrines which prevailed in the religious ſyſtem of his age: he not only exhorted the laity to ſtudy the ſcriptures, but tranſlated the bible into Engliſh for general uſe and popular inſpection. Whatever were his motives, it is certain t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>at theſe efforts enlarged the notions of mankind, and ſowed thoſe ſeeds of a revolution in religion, which were quickened at length and brought to maturity by a favourable coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of circumſtances, in an age when the encreaſing growth of literature and curioſity naturally led the way to innovation and improvement. But a viſible diminution of the authority of the eccleſiaſtics, in England at leaſt, had been long growing from other cauſes. The diſguſt which the laity had contracted from the numerous and arbitrary en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments both of the court of Rome, and of their own clergy, had greatly weaned the kingdom from ſuperſtition; and conſpicuous ſymptoms had appeared, on various occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, of a general deſire to ſhake off the intolerable bondage of papal oppreſſion.</p>

            <p>Notwithſtanding what has been ſuppoſed above, it is not quite certain, that Longland was the firſt who led the way in this ſingular ſpecies of verſification. His VISION was written on a popular ſubject, and is the only poem, compoſed in this capricious ſort of metre, which has been printed. It is eaſy to conceive how theſe circumſtances contributed to give him the merit of an inventor on this occaſion.</p>
            <p>The ingenious doctor Percy has exhibited ſpecimens of two or three other poems belonging to this claſs <note n="e" place="bottom">Eſſay on the Metr. of P. P. Viſ. p. 8. ſeq.</note>. One of theſe is entitled DEATH AND LIFE: it conſiſts of two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty-nine lines, and is divided into two parts or <hi>Fitts.</hi> It begins thus:</p>
            <q>
               <l>Chriſt chriſten king that on the croſs tholed,</l>
               <l>Hadde paines and paſſyons to defend our ſoules;</l>

               <l>For that royall red blood that rann from thy ſide.</l>
            </q>
            <p>The ſubject of this piece is a VISION, containing a conteſt for ſuperiority between <hi>Our lady Dame</hi> LIFE, and the <hi>ugly fiend</hi>
               <pb n="313" facs="tcp:0373500101:480"/>
               <hi>Dame</hi> DEATH: who with their ſeveral attributes and conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitants are perſonified in a beautiful vein of allegorical paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Dame</hi> LIFE is thus forcibly deſcribed.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Shee was brighter of her blee than was the bright ſonn:</l>
               <l>Her rud redder than the roſe that on the riſe hangeth:</l>
               <l>Meekely ſmiling with her mouth, and merry in her lookes;</l>
               <l>Ever laughing for love, as ſhee like would:</l>
               <l>And as ſhe came by the bankes the boughes eche one</l>
               <l>They lowted to that ladye and layd forth their branches;</l>
               <l>Bloſſomes and burgens breathed full ſweete,</l>
               <l>Flowers flouriſhed in the frith where ſhe forth ſtepped,</l>
               <l>And the graſſe that was gray grened belive.</l>
            </q>
            <p>The figure of DEATH follows, which is equally bold and expreſſive. Another piece of this kind, alſo quoted by doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor Percy, is entitled CHEVELERE ASSIGNE, or DE CIGNE, that is the <hi>Knight of the Swan.</hi> This is a romance which is extant in a proſe tranſlation from the French, among Mr. Garrick's noble collection of old plays <note n="f" place="bottom">K. vol. 10. <q rend="inline">"Imprinted at London by me Wylliam Copland."</q> There is an edition on parchment by W. de Worde, 1512. <q rend="inline">"Newly tranſlated out of Frenſhe into Englyſhe at thinſtigacion of the puyſſaunt prynce lorde Edward duke of Buckynghame."</q> Here I underſtand French proſe.</note>.

            <p>This alliterative meaſure, unaccompanied with rhyme, and including many peculiar Saxon idioms appropriated to poetry, remained in uſe ſo low as the ſixteenth century. In doctor Percy's <hi>Antient Ballads,</hi> there is one of this claſs called THE SCOTTISH FEILDE, containing a very circumſtantial narrative of the battle of Flodden fought in the year 1513.</p>
            <p>In ſome of the earlieſt of our ſpecimens of old Engliſh poetry <note n="i" place="bottom">See Sect. i.</note>, we have long ago ſeen that alliteration was eſteemed a faſhionable and favourite ornament of verſe. For the ſake of throwing the ſubject into one view, and further illuſtrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what has been here ſaid concerning it, I chuſe to cite in this place a very antient hymn to the Virgin Mary, never printed, where this affectation profeſſedly predominates <note n="k" place="bottom">

            <p>ALTHOUGH this work is profeſſedly confined to England, yet I cannot paſs over two Scotch poets of this period, who have adorned the Engliſh language by a ſtrain of verſification, expreſſion, and poetical imagery, far ſuperior to their age; and who conſequently deſerve to be mentioned in a general review of the progreſs of our national poetry. They have written two heroic poems. One of them is John Barbour, archdeacon of Aberdeen. He was edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated at Oxford; and Rymer has printed an inſtrument for his ſafe paſſage into England, in order to proſecute his ſtudies in that univerſity, in the years 1357 and 1365 <note n="a" place="bottom">Fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In the library of Worceſter college at Oxford, there is a poem in French, reciting the atchievements of Edward the Black Prince, who died in the year 1376. It is in the ſhort verſe of romance, and was written by the prince's herald, who attended cloſe by his perſon in all his battles, according to the eſtabliſhed mode of thoſe times. This was John Chandois-herald, frequently mentioned in Froiſſart. In this piece, which is of conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able length, the names of the Engliſhmen are properly ſpelled, the chronology exact, and the epitaph <note n="l" place="bottom">It is a fair and beautiful manuſcript on vellum.

            <p>It were eaſy to illuſtrate this doctrine by various examples. The famous French romance of SAINTRE was evidently the performance of a herald.

The pompous circumſtances of which theſe heraldic narratives conſiſted, and the minute prolixity with which they were diſplayed, ſeem to have infected the profeſſed hiſtorians of this age. Of this there are various inſtances in Froiſſart, who had no other deſign than to compile a chronicle of real facts. I will give one example out of many. At a treaty of marriage between our Richard the ſecond and Iſabel daughter of Charles the fifth king of France, the two monarchs, attended with a noble retinue, met and formed ſeveral encampments in a ſpacious plain, near the caſtle of Guynes. Froiſſart expends many pages in relating at large the coſtly furniture of the pavilions, the riches of the ſide-boards, the profuſion and variety of ſumptuous liquors, ſpices, and diſhes, with their order of ſervice, the number of the attendants, with their addreſs and exact diſcharge of duty in their reſpective offices, the preſents of gold and precious ſtones made on both ſides, and a thouſand other particulars of equal importance, relating to the parade of this royal interview <note n="g" place="bottom">See Froiſſart's CRONYCLE, tranſlated by Lord Berners. Pinſon, 1523. vol. ii. f. 242.</note>. On this account, Cax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, in his exhortation to the knights of his age, ranks Froiſſart's hiſtory, as a book of chivalry, with the romances of Lancelot and Percival; and recommends it to their attention, as a manual equally calculated to inculcate

            <p>As we are approaching to Chaucer, let us here ſtand ſtill, and take a retroſpect of the general manners. The tourna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and carouſals of our antient princes, by forming ſplendid aſſemblies of both ſexes, while they inculcated the moſt liberal ſentiments of honour and heroiſm, undoubtedly contributed to introduce ideas of courteſy, and to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage decorum. Yet the national manners ſtill retained a great degree of ferocity, and the ceremonies of the moſt refined courts in Europe had often a mixture of barbariſm, which rendered them ridiculous. This abſurdity will always appear at periods when men are ſo far civiliſed as to have loſt their native ſimplicity, and yet have not attained juſt ideas of politeneſs and propriety. Their luxury was inelegant, their pleaſures indelicate, their pomp cumberſome and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wieldy. In the mean time it may ſeem ſurpriſing, that the many ſchools of philoſophy which flouriſhed in the middle ages, ſhould not have corrected and poliſhed the times. But as their religion was corrupted by ſuperſtition, ſo their philoſophy degenerated into ſophiſtry. Nor is it ſcience alone, even if founded on truth, that will poliſh nations.

            <p>THE moſt illuſtrious ornament of the reign of Edward the third, and of his ſucceſſor Richard the ſecond, was Jeffrey Chaucer; a poet with whom the hiſtory of our poetry is by many ſuppoſed to have commenced; and who has been pronounced, by a critic of unqueſtionable taſte and diſcernment, to be the firſt Engliſh verſifier who wrote poetically <note n="a" place="bottom">Johnſon's DICTION. Pref. p. 1.</note>. He was born in the year 1328, and educated at Oxford, where he made a rapid progreſs in the ſcholaſtic ſciences as they were then taught: but the livelineſs of his parts, and the native gaiety of his diſpoſition, ſoon recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended him to the patronage of a magnificent monarch, and rendered him a very popular and acceptable character in the brilliant court which I have above deſcribed. In the mean time, he added to his accompliſhments by frequent tours into France and Italy, which he ſometimes viſited under the advantages of a public character. Hitherto our poets had been perſons of a private and circumſcribed edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and the art of verſifying, like every other kind of compoſition, had been confined to recluſe ſcholars. But Chaucer was a man of the world: and from this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance we are to account, in great meaſure, for the many new embelliſhments which he conferred on our language and our poetry. The deſcriptions of ſplendid proceſſions and gallant carouſals, with which his works abound, are a proof that he was converſant with the practices and diverſions of polite life. Familiarity with a variety of things and objects, opportunities of acquiring the faſhionable and courtly modes

of ſpeech, connections with the great at home, and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal acquaintance with the vernacular poets of foreign countries, opened his mind and furniſhed him with new lights <note n="b" place="bottom">The earl of Saliſbury, beheaded by Henry the fourth, could not but patroniſe Chaucer.

Although Chaucer had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly ſtudied the works of theſe celebrated writers, and particularly of Dante, before this fortunate interview; yet it ſeems likely, that theſe excurſions gave him a new reliſh for their compoſitions, and enlarged his knowledge of the Italian fables. His travels likewiſe enabled him to cultivate the Italian and Provencial languages with the greateſt ſucceſs; and induced him to poliſh the aſperity, and enrich the ſterility of his native verſification, with ſofter cadences, and a more copious and variegated phraſeology. In this attempt, which was authoriſed by the recent and popular examples of Petrarch in Italy and Alain Chartier in France <note n="d" place="bottom">Leland Script.

But theſe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations would have been alone inſufficient to have produced or ſuſtained any conſiderable revolution in our language: the great work was reſerved for Gower and Chaucer.

The orthodox divines of this period generally wrote in Latin: but Wickliffe, that his arguments might be familiariſed to common readers and the bulk of the people, was obliged to compoſe in Engliſh his numerous theological treatiſes againſt the papal corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Edward the third, while he perhaps intended only to baniſh a badge of conqueſt, greatly contributed to eſtabliſh

the national diaiect, by aboliſhing the uſe of the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man tongue in the public acts and judicial proceedings, as we have before obſerved, and by ſubſtituting the natural lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the country. But Chaucer manifeſtly firſt taught his countrymen to write Engliſh; and formed a ſtyle by naturaliſing words from the Provencial, at that time the moſt poliſhed dialect of any in Europe, and the beſt adapted to the purpoſes of poetical expreſſion.</p>
            <p>It is certain that Chaucer abounds in claſſical alluſions: but his poetry is not formed on the antient models. He appears to have been an univerſal reader, and his learning is ſometimes miſtaken for genius: but his chief ſources were the French and Italian poets.

            <p>Boccacio was the diſciple of Petrarch: and although prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally known and deſervedly celebrated as a writer or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventor of tales, he was by his cotemporaries uſually placed in the third rank after Dante and Petrarch. But Boccacio having ſeen the Platonic ſonnets of his maſter Petrarch, in a fit of deſpair committed all his poetry to the flames <note n="k" place="bottom">Goujet, Bibl. Fr. Tom. vii. p. 328.

But whether or no this proſe HISTOIRE DU CHEVALIER THESEUS is the ſtory of Theſeus in queſtion, or whether this is the ſame Theſeus, I cannot aſcertain.

I confeſs I am of opinion, that Boccacio's THESEID is an original compoſition. But there is a Greco-barbarous poem extant on this ſubject, which, if it could be proved to be antecedent in point of time to the Italian poem, would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade Boccacio to a mere tranſlator on this occaſion. It is a matter that deſerves to be examined at large, and to be traced with accuracy.</p>
            <p>This Greek poem is as little known and as ſcarce as Boc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacio's THESEID. It is entitled, <gap reason="foreign">

It is not mentioned by Cruſius or Fabricius; but is often cited by Du Cange in his Greek gloſſary, under the title, DE NUPTIIS THESEI ET AEMILIAE. The heads of the chapters are adorned with rude wooden cuts of the ſtory. I once ſuſpected that Boccacio, having received this poem from ſome of his learned friends among the Grecian exiles, who being driven from Conſtantinople took refuge in Italy about the fourteenth century, tranſlated it into Italian. Under this ſuppoſition, I was indeed ſurpriſed to find the ideas of chivalry, and the ceremonies of a tournament minutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, in a poem which appeared to have been written at Conſtantinople. But this difficulty was ſoon removed, when I recollected that the Franks, Venetians, and Germans had been in poſſeſſion of that city for more than one hundred years; and that Baldwin earl of Flanders was elected emperor of Conſtantinople in the year 1204, and was ſucceeded by four Latin or Frankiſh emperors, down to the year 1261 <note n="b" place="bottom">About which period it is probable that the anonymous Greek poem, called the <hi>Loves of Lybiſter and Rhodamna,</hi> was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.

He adds, <q rend="inline">"et mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicae teſtudines."</q> It is written in the iambic meaſure mentioned below.

From the ſame communication likewiſe, I mean the Greek exiles, I fancied Boccacio might have procured the ſtories of ſeveral of his tales in the DECA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MERON: as, for inſtance, that of CYMON and IPHIGENIA, where the names are entirely Grecian, and the ſcene laid in Rhodes, Cyprus, Crete, and other parts of Greece belonging
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:0373500101:516"/>
to the imperial territory <note n="d" place="bottom">Giorn. v. Nov. 1.</note>. But, to ſay no more of this, I have at preſent no ſort of doubt of what I before aſſerted, that Boccacio is the writer and inventor of this piece. Our Greek poem is in fact a literal tranſlation from the Italian THESEID. It conſiſts of twelve books, and is written in Boccacio's octave ſtanza, the two laſt lines of every ſtanza rhyming together. The verſes are of the iambic kind, and ſomething like the VERSUS POLITICI, which were common among the Greek ſcholars a little before and long after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople was taken by the Turks, in the year 1443. It will readily be allowed, that the circumſtance of the ſtanzas and rhymes is very ſingular in a poem compoſed in the Greek language, and is alone ſufficient to prove this piece to be a tranſlation from Boccacio. I muſt not forget to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the Greek is extremely barbarous, and of the loweſt period of that language.</p>
            <p>It was a common practice of the learned and indigent Greeks, who frequented Italy and the neighbouring ſtates about the fifteenth and ſixteenth centuries, to tranſlate the popular pieces of Italian poetry, and the romances or tales moſt in vogue, into theſe Greco-barbarous iambics <note n="e" place="bottom">That is <hi>verſus politici</hi> abovementioned, a ſort of looſe iambic. See Langii PHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOLOGIA GRAECO-BARBARA. Tzetes's Chiliads are written in this verſification. See Du Cange, Gl. Gr. ii. col. 1. 96.</note>. PASTOR FIDO was thus tranſlated.

            <p>We are ſurpriſed to find, in a poet of ſuch antiquity, numbers ſo nervous and flowing: a circumſtance which greatly contributed to render Dryden's paraphraſe of this poem the moſt animated and harmonious piece of verſifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the Engliſh language. I cannot leave the KNIGHT'S TALE without remarking, that the inventor of this poem, appears to have poſſeſſed conſiderable talents for the artificial conſtruction of a ſtory. It exhibits unexpected and ſtriking turns of fortune; and abounds in thoſe incidents which are calculated to ſtrike the fancy by opening reſources to ſublime deſcription, or intereſt the heart by pathetic ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. On this account, even without conſidering the poetical and exterior ornaments of the piece, we are hardly diſguſted with the mixture of manners, the confuſion of times, and the like violations of propriety, which this poem, in common with all others of its age, preſents in almoſt every page. The action is ſuppoſed to have happened ſoon after the marriage of Theſeus with Hippolita, and the death of Creon in the ſiege of Thebes: but we are ſoon tranſported into more recent periods. Sunday, the celebration of matins, judicial aſtrology, heraldry, tilts and tournaments, knights of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and targets of Pruſſia <note n="x" place="bottom">The knights of the Teutonic order were ſettled in Pruſſia, before 1300.

            <p>CHAUCER'S ROMAUNT OF THE ROSE is tranſlated from a French poem entitled, LE ROMAN DE LA ROSE. It was begun by William of Lorris, a ſtudent in juriſpru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, who died about the year 1260 <note n="a" place="bottom">Fauchet, p. 198.</note>. Being left unfiniſhed, it was completed by John of Meun, a native of a little town of that name, ſituated on the river Loire near Orleans, who ſeems to have flouriſhed about the year 1310 <note n="b" place="bottom">Id. ibid. p. 200. He alſo tranſlated Boethius <hi>De Conſolatione,</hi> and <hi>Abelard's Letters,</hi> and wrote <hi>Anſwers of the Sybills,</hi> &amp;c.</note>. This poem is eſteemed by the French the moſt valuable piece of their old poetry. It is far beyond the rude efforts of all their preceding romancers: and they have nothing equal to it before the reign of Francis the firſt, who died in the year 1547. But there is a conſiderable difference in the merit of the two authors. William of Lorris, who wrote not one quarter of the poem, is remarkable for his elegance and luxuriance of deſcription, and is a beautiful painter of allegorical perſonages. John of Meun is a writer of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſt. He poſſeſſes but little of his predeceſſor's inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and poetical vein; and in that reſpect was not properly qualified to finiſh a poem begun by William of Lorris. But he has ſtrong ſatire, and great livelineſs <note n="c" place="bottom">
                  <p>The poem conſiſts of 22734 verſes. William of Lorris's part ends with v. 4149. viz.</p>

            <p>The difficulties and dangers of a lover, in purſuing and obtaining the object of his deſires, are the literal argument of this poem. This deſign is couched under the allegory of

a Roſe, which our lover after frequent obſtacles gathers in a delicious garden. He traverſes vaſt ditches, ſcales lofty walls, and forces the gates of adamantine and almoſt impregnable caſtles.

                     <l>"Vous aurez abſolution."</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>But Chaucer has made ſeveral omiſſions in John of Meun's part, before he comes to this period. He has tranſlated all William of Lorris's part, as I have obſerved; and his tranſlation of that part ends with v. 4432. viz.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>"Than ſhuldin I fallin in wanhope."</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>Chaucer's cotemporaries called his <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant of the Roſe,</hi> a tranſlation. Lydgate ſays that Chaucer</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>—Notably did his buſineſſe</l>
                     <l>By grete avyſe his wittes to diſpoſe,</l>
                     <l>To <hi>tranſlate</hi> the ROMANS OF THE ROSE.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>Prol. Boch. ſt. vi. It is manifeſt that Chaucer took no pains to diſguiſe his tranſlation. He literally follows the French, in ſaying, that a river was <q rend="inline">"leſſe than <hi>Saine.</hi>"</q> i. e. the Seine at Paris. v. 118. <q rend="inline">"No wight in all Paris."</q> v. 7157. A grove has more birds <q rend="inline">"than ben in all the relme of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> 
                     </q>v. 495. He calls a pine, <q rend="inline">"A tree in <hi>France</hi> men call a pine."</q> v. 1457. He ſays of roſes, <q rend="inline">"ſo faire werin nevir in <hi>Rone.</hi>"</q> v. 1674. <q rend="inline">"That for Paris ne for Pavie."</q> v. 1654. He has ſometimes reference to French ideas, or words, not in the original. As <q rend="inline">"Men clepin hem Sereins in France."</q> v. 684. <q rend="inline">"From Jeruſalem to Burgoine."</q> v. 554. <q rend="inline">"Grein de Paris."</q> v. 1369. Where Skin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſays, <hi>Paris</hi> is contracted for <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> In mentioning minſtrells and juglers, he ſays, that ſome of them <q rend="inline">"Songin ſonges of Loraine."</q> v. 776. He adds,
<q>
                        <l>For in Loraine there notis be</l>
                        <l>Full ſwetir than <hi>in this contre.</hi>
                        </l>
                     </q>
There is not a ſyllable of theſe ſongs, and ſingers, of Loraine, in the French. By the way, I ſuſpect that Chaucer tranſlated this poem while he was at Paris. There are alſo many alluſions to Engliſh affairs, which I ſuſpected to be Chaucer's; but they are all in the French original. Such as, <q rend="inline">"Hornpipis of Cornevaile."</q> v. 4250. Theſe are called in the original, <q rend="inline">"Chale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaux de Cornouaille."</q> v. 3991. A knight is introduced, allied to king <q rend="inline">"Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of Bretaigne."</q> v. 1199. Who is called, <q rend="inline">"Bon roy Artus de Bretaigne."</q> Orig. v. 1187. Sir Gawin, and Sir Kay, two of Arthur's knights, are characteriſed, v. 2206. ſeq. See Orig. v. 2124. Where the word <hi>Keulx</hi> is corrupt for Keie. But there is one paſſage, in which he mentions a <hi>Bachelere</hi> as fair as <q rend="inline">"The Lordis ſonne of Windiſore."</q> v. 1250. This is added by Chaucer, and intended as a compliment to ſome of his patrons. In the <hi>Legende of good Women,</hi> Cupid ſays to Chaucer, v. 329.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>For in plain text, withoutin nede of gloſe,</l>

            <p>The fiction that Sickneſs, Melancholy, and other beings of the like ſort, were counſellors in the palace of OLD AGE, and employed in telling her day and night, that <q rend="inline">"DEATH ſtood <hi>armed</hi> at her gate,"</q> was far beyond the ſentimental and ſatirical vein of John of Meun, and is conceived with great vigour of imagination.</p>
            <p>Chaucer appears to have been early ſtruck with this French poem. In his DREME, written long before he begun this tranſlation, he ſuppoſes, that the chamber in which he ſlept was richly painted with the ſtory of the ROMAUNT OF THE ROSE <note n="p" place="bottom">v. 322. Chaucer alludes to this poem in The MARCHAUNT'S TALE, v. 1548. p. 72. Urr.</note>. It is natural to imagine, that ſuch a poem muſt have been a favorite with Chaucer. No poet, before William of Lorris, either Italian or French, had delineated allegorical perſonages in ſo diſtinct and enlarged a ſtyle, and with ſuch a fullneſs of characteriſtical attributes: nor had deſcriptive poetry ſelected ſuch a variety of circumſtances, and diſcloſed ſuch an exuberance of embelliſhment, in form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing agreeable repreſentations of nature. On this account, we are ſurpriſed that Boileau ſhould mention Villon as the firſt poet of France who drew form and order from the chaos of the old French romancers.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Villon ſçeut le PREMIER, dans ces ſiecles groſſiers</l>

            </q>
            <p>But the poetry of William of Lorris was not the poetry of Boileau.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="383" facs="tcp:0373500101:550"/>
That this poem ſhould not pleaſe Boileau, I can eaſily conceive. It is more ſurpriſing that it ſhould have been cenſured as a contemptible performance by Petrarch, who lived in the age of fancy. Petrarch being deſired by his friend Guy de Gonzague to ſend him ſome new piece, ſent the ROMAN DE LA ROSE. With the poem, inſtead of an encomium, he returned a ſevere criticiſm; in which he treats it as a cold, inartificial, and extravagant compoſition: as a proof, how much France, who valued this poem as her chief work, was ſurpaſſed by Italy in eloquence and the arts of writing <note n="r" place="bottom">See Petrarch. Carm. L. i. Ep. 30.</note>. In this opinion we muſt attribute ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to jealouſy. But the truth is, Petrarch's genius was too cultivated to reliſh theſe wild excurſions of imagination: his favorite claſſics, whom he revived, and ſtudied with ſo much attention, ran in his head. Eſpecially Ovid's ART OF LOVE, a poem of another ſpecies, and evidently formed on another plan; but which Petrarch had been taught to vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, as the model and criterion of a didactic poem on the paſſion of love reduced to a ſyſtem. We may add, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the poem before us was founded on the viſionary doctrines and refinements concerning love invented by the Provencial poets, and conſequently leſs unlikely to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably received by Petrarch, yet his ideas on that delicate ſubject were much more Platonic and metaphyſical.</p>

            <p>CHAUCER'S poem of TROILUS and CRESSEIDE is ſaid to be formed on an old hiſtory, written by Lollius, a native of Urbino in Italy <note n="a" place="bottom">Petrus Lambeccius enumerates Lollius Urbicus among the <hi>Hiſtorici Latini profani</hi> of the third century.

            <p>Whether the HOUSE OF FAME is Chaucer's invention, or ſuggeſted by any French or Italian poet, I cannot determine. But I am apt to think it was originally a Provencial compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, among other proofs, from this paſſage.</p>

ſituated, like that of Ovid, between earth and ſea. In their paſſage thither, they fly above the ſtars; which our author leaves, with clouds, tempeſts, hail, and ſnow, far beneath him. This aerial journey is partly copied from Ovid's Phaeton in the chariot of the ſun. But the poet apologiſes for this extravagant fiction, and explains his meaning, by alledging the authority of Boethius; who ſays, that Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation may ſoar on the wings of Philoſophy above every element. He likewiſe recollects, in the midſt of his courſe, the deſcription of the heavens, given by Marcianus Capella in his book <hi>De Nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii</hi>

            <p>The hall was filled with the writers of antient tales and romances, whoſe ſubjects and names were too numerous to be recounted. In the mean time crouds from every nation and of every condition filled the hall, and each preſented his claim to the queen. A meſſenger is diſpatched to ſummon Eolus from his cave in Thrace; who is ordered to bring his two clarions called SLANDER and PRAISE, and his trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter Triton. The praiſes of each petitioner are then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſounded, according to the partial or capricious appointment of Fame; and equal merits obtain very different ſucceſs. There is much ſatire and humour in theſe requeſts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and in the diſgraces and honours which are indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminately diſtributed by the queen, without diſcernment and by chance. The poet then enters the houſe or labyrinth of RUMOUR. It was built of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Theſe are romantic exaggerations of Ovid's inventions on the ſame ſubject. It was moreover ſixty miles in length, and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually turning round. From this houſe, ſays the poet, iſſued tidings of every kind, like fountains and rivers from the ſea. Its inhabitants, who were eternally employed in hearing or telling news, together with the riſe of reports, and the formation

            <p>Pope has imitated this piece, with his uſual elegance of diction and harmony of verſification. But in the mean time, he has not only miſrepreſented the ſtory, but marred the character of the poem. He has endeavoured to correct it's extravagancies, by new refinements and additions of another caſt: but he did not conſider, that extravagancies are eſſential to a poem of ſuch a ſtructure, and even conſtitute it's beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. An attempt to unite order and exactneſs of imagery with a ſubject formed on principles ſo profeſſedly romantic and anomalous, is like giving Corinthian pillars to a Gothic palace.

            <p>NOTHING can be more ingeniouſly contrived than the occaſion on which Chaucer's CANTERBURY TALES are ſuppoſed to be recited. A company of pilgrims, on their journey to viſit the ſhrine of Thomas a Beckett at Canterbury, lodge at the Tabarde-inn in Southwark. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſtrangers to each other, they are aſſembled in one room at ſupper, as was then the cuſtom; and agree, not only to travel together the next morning, but to relieve the fatigue of the journey by telling each a ſtory <note n="a" place="bottom">There is an inn at Burford in Oxford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, which accommodated pilgrims on their road to Saint Edward's ſhrine in the abbey of Glouceſter.

Boccacio ſuppoſes, that when the plague began to abate at Florence, ten young per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of both ſexes retired to a country houſe, two miles from the city, with a deſign of enjoying freſh air, and paſſing ten days agreeably. Their principal and eſtabliſhed amuſement, inſtead of playing at cheſs after dinner, was for each to tell a tale. One ſuperiority which, among others, Chaucer's plan afforded above that of Boccacio, was
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:0373500101:565"/>
the opportunity of diſplaying a variety of ſtriking and dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic characters, which would not have eaſily met but on ſuch an expedition. A circumſtance which alſo contributed to give a variety to the ſtories. And for a number of perſons in their ſituation, ſo natural, ſo practicable, ſo pleaſant, I add ſo rational, a mode of entertainment could not have been imagined.</p>
            <p>The CANTERBURY TALES are unequal, and of various merit. Few, if any, of the ſtories are perhaps the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That of the CANTERBURY TALES, which deſerves the next place, as written in the higher ſtrain of poetry, and the poem by which Milton deſcribes and characteriſes Chaucer, is the SQUIER'S TALE.

In the midſt of the ſolemnity, the gueſts are alarmed with a miraculous and unexpected ſpectacle: the minſtrells ceaſe on a ſudden, and all the aſſembly is huſhed in ſilence, ſurpriſe, and ſuſpence.</p>

            <p>This idea of a horſe of braſs took it's riſe from their chemical knowledge and experiments in metals.

It accidentally fell into his hands, while he reſided at Arque between Venice and Padua, in the year one thouſand three hundred and ſeventy-four. The tale of Griſilde ſtruck him the moſt of any: ſo much, that he got it by heart to relate it to his friends at Padua. Finding that it was the moſt popular of all Boccacio's tales, for the benefit of thoſe who did not underſtand Italian, and to ſpread its circulation, he tranſlated it into Latin with ſome alterations. Petrarch relates this in a letter to Boccacio: and adds, that on ſhewing the tranſlation to one of his Paduan friends, the latter, touched with the tenderneſs of the ſtory, burſt into ſuch frequent and violent fits of tears, that he could not read to the end. In the ſame letter he ſays, that a Veroneſe having heard of the Paduan's exquiſiteneſs of feeling on this occaſion, reſolved to try the experiment. He read the whole aloud from the beginning to the end, without the leaſt change of voice or countenance; but on returning the book to Petrarch, confeſſed that it was an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting ſtory: <q rend="inline">"I ſhould have wept, added he, like the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duan, had I thought the ſtory true.

            <p>Dryden and Pope have moderniſed the two laſt mentioned poems. Dryden the tale of the NONNES PRIEST, and Pope that of JANUARY and MAY: intending perhaps to give pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns of the beſt of Chaucer's Tales in the comic ſpecies. But I am of opinion that the MILLER'S TALE has more true humour than either. Not that I mean to palliate the levity of the ſtory, which was moſt probably choſen by Chaucer in compliance with the prevailing manners of an unpoliſhed age, and agreeable to ideas of feſtivity not always the moſt delicate and refined. Chaucer abounds in liberties of this kind, and this muſt be his apology. So does Boccacio, and perhaps much more, but from a different cauſe. The licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs of Boccacio's tales, which he compoſed <hi>per cacciar le malincolia delle femine,</hi> to amuſe the ladies, is to be vindicated, at leaſt accounted for, on other principles: it was not ſo much the conſequence of popular incivility, as it was owing to a particular event of the writer's age. Juſt before Boc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacio wrote, the plague at Florence had totally changed the cuſtoms and manners of the people. Only a few of the
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:0373500101:591"/>
women had ſurvived this fatal malady; who having loſt their husbands, parents, or friends, gradually grew regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of thoſe conſtraints and cuſtomary formalities which before of courſe influenced their behaviour. For want of female attendants, they were obliged often to take men only into their ſervice: and this circumſtance greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to deſtroy their habits of delicacy, and gave an opening to various freedoms and indecencies unſuitable to the ſex, and frequently productive of very ſerious conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. As to the monaſteries, it is not ſurpriſing that Boccacio ſhould have made them the ſcenes of his moſt libertine ſtories. The plague had thrown open their gates. The monks and nuns wandered abroad, and partaking of the common liberties of life, and the levities of the world, forgot the rigour of their inſtitutions, and the ſeverity of their eccleſiaſtical characters. At the ceaſing of the plague, when the religious were compelled to return to their cloiſters, they could not forſake their attachment to theſe ſecular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences; they continued to practice the ſame free courſe of life, and would not ſubmit to the diſagreeable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſocial injunctions of their reſpective orders. Cotemporary hiſtorians give a ſhocking repreſentation of the unbounded debaucheries of the Florentines on this occaſion: and eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical writers mention this period as the grand epoch of the relaxation of monaſtic diſcipline<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Boccacio did not eſcape the cenſure of the church for theſe compoſitions. His con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion was a point much laboured; and in expiation of his follies, he was almoſt perſuaded to renounce poetry and the heathen authors, and to turn Carthuſian. But, to ſay the truth, Boccacio's life was almoſt as looſe as his writings; till he was in great meaſure reclaimed by the powerful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances of his maſter Petrarch, who talked much more to the purpoſe than his confeſſor. This Boccacio himſelf acknowledges in the fifth of his eclogues, which like thoſe

He peeps through a crevice of the door, and at length diſcovers the ſcholar, who is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious that he was ſeen, in an affected trance of abſtracted meditation.

In this piece the reader obſerves that the humour of the characters is made ſubſervient to the plot.</p>
            <p>I have before hinted, that Chaucer's obſcenity is in great meaſure to be imputed to his age. We are apt to form romantic and exaggerated notions about the moral innocence of our anceſtors. Ages of ignorance and ſimplicity are thought to be ages of purity. The direct contrary, I believe, is the caſe. Rude periods have that groſſneſs of manners which is not leſs friendly to virtue than luxury itſelf. In the middle ages, not only the moſt flagrant violations of modeſty were frequently practiſed and permitted, but the moſt infamous vices. Men are leſs aſhamed as they are le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="433" facs="tcp:0373500101:600"/>
after the time of Chaucer. It is the work of ſome taſteleſs imitator, who has ſufficiently diſguiſed his original, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining none of its ſpirit. I mention theſe circumſtances, leſt it ſhould be thought that this frigid abridgment was the ground-work of Chaucer's poem on the ſame ſubject. In the claſs of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>umourous or ſatirical tales, the SOMPNOUR'S TALE, which expoſes the tricks and extortions of the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicant friars, has alſo diſtinguiſhed merit. This piece has incidentally been mentioned above with the PLOWMAN'S TALE, and Pierce Plowman.</p>
            <p>Genuine humour, the concomitant of true taſte, conſiſts in diſcerning improprieties in books as well as characters. We therefore muſt remark under this claſs another tale of Chaucer, which till lately has been looked upon as a grave heroic narrative. I mean the RIME OF SIR THOPAS. Chau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, at a period which almoſt realiſed the manners of roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic chivalry, diſcerned the leading abſurdities of the old romances: and in this poem, which may be juſtly called a prelude to Don Quixote, has burleſqued them with exquiſite ridicule. That this was the poet's aim, appears from many paſſages. But, to put the matter beyond a doubt, take the words of an ingenious critic. <q rend="inline">"We are to obſerve, ſays he, that this was Chaucer's own Tale: and that, when in the progreſs of it, the good ſenſe of the hoſt is made to break in upon him, and interrupt him, Chaucer approves his diſguſt, and changing his note, tells the ſimple inſtructive Tale of MELIBOEUS, <hi>a moral tale vertuous,</hi> as he terms it; to ſhew what ſort of fictions were moſt expreſſive of real life, and moſt proper to be put into the hands of the people.

<pb n="434" facs="tcp:0373500101:601"/>
his own, but a ſtory of antique fame, and very cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in the days of chivalry: ſo that nothing could better ſuit the poet's deſign of diſcrediting the old ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, than the choice of this venerable legend for the vehicle of his ridicule upon them <note n="o" place="bottom">See Dr. Hurd's LETTERS ON CHIVALRY AND ROMANCE. Dialogues, &amp;c. iii. 218. edit. 1765.</note>.</q> But it is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, that Chaucer's deſign was intended to ridicule the frivolous deſcriptions, and other tedious impertinencies, ſo common in the volumes of chivalry with which his age was overwhelmed, not to degrade in general or expoſe a mode of fabling, whoſe ſublime extravagancies conſtitute the marvellous graces of his own CAMBUSCAN; a compoſition which at the ſame time abundantly demonſtrates, that the manners of romance are better calculated to anſwer the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of pure poetry, to captivate the imagination, and to produce ſurpriſe, than the fictions of claſſical antiquity.</p>

phyſic; an art then but imperfectly known and practiced in moſt parts of Europe. Being well verſed in the Arabic tongue, from their commerce with Africa and Egypt, they had ſtudied the Arabic tranſlations of Galen and Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates; which had become ſtill more familiar to the great numbers of their brethren who reſided in Spain. From this ſource al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Here was a beneficial effect of the diſperſion and vagabond condition of the Jews: I mean the diffuſion of knowledge. One of the moſt eminent of theſe learned Jews was Moſes Maimonides, a phyſician, philoſopher, aſtrologer, and theologiſt, educated at Cordoua in Spain under Averroes. He died about the year 1208. Averroes being accuſed of heretical opinions, was ſentenced to <hi>live with the Jews in the ſtreet of the Jews</hi> at Cordoua. Some of theſe learned Jews began to flouriſh in the Arabian ſchools in Spain, as early as the beginning of the ninth century. Many of the treatiſes of Averroes were tranſlated by the Spaniſh Jews into He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew: and the Latin pieces of Averroes now extant were tranſlated into Latin from theſe Hebrew verſions. I have already mentioned the ſchool or univerſity of Cordoua. Leo Africanus ſpeaks of <q rend="inline">"Platea bibliothecariorum Cordouae."</q> This, from what follows, appears to be a ſtreet of bookſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers.

            <p>Chaucer's ſcheme of the CANTERBURY TALES was evidently left unfiniſhed. It was intended by our author, that every pilgrim ſhould likewiſe tell a Tale on their return from Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury <note n="b" place="bottom">Or rather, two on their way thither, and two on their return. Only Chaucer himſelf tells two tales. The poet ſays, that there were twenty-nine pilgrims in company: but in the CHARACTERS he deſcribes more. Among the TALES which remain, there are none of the Prioreſſe's Chaplains, the Haberdaſher, Carpynter, Webbe, Dyer, Tapicer, and Hoſte.

It was firſt printed by Urry, who ſuppoſed it to be Chaucer's <note n="c" place="bottom">Urr. Chauc. p. 595.</note>. In the Prologue which is of conſiderable length, there is ſome humour and contrivance: in which the author, happily enough, continues to charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſe the pilgrims, by imagining what each did, and how each behaved, when they all arrived at Canterbury. After dinner was ordered at their inn, they all proceed to the cathedral. At entering the church one of the monks ſprinkles them with holy water. The Knight with the better ſort of the company goes in great order to the ſhrine of Thomas a Beckett. The Miller and his companions run ſtaring about the church: they pretend to blazon the arms painted in the glaſs windows, and enter into a diſpute in heraldry: but the Hoſte of the Tabarde reproves them for their improper beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and impertinent diſcourſe, and directs them to the martyr's ſhrine. When all had finiſhed their devotions, they return to the inn. In the way thither they purchaſe toys for which that city was famous, called <hi>Canterbury brochis:</hi> and here much facetiouſneſs paſſes betwixt the Frere and the Sompnour, in which the latter vows revenge on the former, for telling a Tale ſo palpably levelled at his profeſſion, and proteſts he will retaliate on their return by a more ſevere ſtory. When dinner is ended, the Hoſte of the Tabarde thanks all the company in form for their ſeveral Tales. The party then ſeparate till ſupper-time by agreement. The Knight goes to ſurvey the walls and bulwarks of the city, and explains to his ſon the Squier the nature and ſtrength of them. Mention is here made of great guns. The Wife of Bath is too weary to walk far; ſhe propoſes to the Prioreſſe to divert themſelves in the garden, which abounds with herbs proper for making ſalves. Others wander about the ſtreets. The Pardoner has a low adventure, which ends
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:0373500101:623"/>
much to his diſgrace. The next morning they proceed on their return to Southwark: and our genial maſter of the Tabarde, juſt as they leave Canterbury, by way of putting the company into good humour, begins a panegyric on the morning and the month of April, ſome lines of which I ſhall quote, as a ſpecimen of our author's abilities in poetical deſcription <note n="c" place="bottom">There is a good deſcription of a magical palace, v. 1973—2076.</note>.</p>

            <p>IT is not my intention to dedicate a volume to Chaucer, how much ſoever he may deſerve it; nor can it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that, in a work of this general nature, I ſhould enter into a critical examination of all Chaucer's pieces. Enough has been ſaid to prove, that in elevation, and elegance, in har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and perſpicuity of verſification, he ſurpaſſes his predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors in an infinite proportion: that his genius was univerſal, and adapted to themes of unbounded variety: that his merit was not leſs in painting familiar manners with humour and propriety, than in moving the paſſions, and in repreſenting the beautiful or the grand objects of nature with grace and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limity. In a word, that he appeared with all the luſtre and dignity of a true poet, in an age which compelled him to ſtruggle with a barbarous language, and a national want of taſte; and when to write verſes at all, was regarded as a ſingular qualification. It is true indeed, that he lived at a time when the French and Italians had made conſiderable advances and improvements in poetry: and although proofs have already been occaſionally given of his imitations from theſe ſources, I ſhall cloſe my account of him with a diſtinct and comprehenſive view of the nature of the poetry which ſubſiſted in France and Italy when he wrote: pointing out in the mean time, how far and in what manner the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular models of thoſe nations contributed to form his taſte, and influence his genius.</p>
            <p>I have already mentioned the troubadours of Provence, and have obſerved that they were fond of moral and alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorical fables <note n="a" place="bottom">See ſupr. p. 148.</note>. A taſte for this ſort of compoſition they

partly acquired by reading Boethius, and the PSYCHOMACHIA of Prudentius, two favorite claſſics of the dark ages; and partly from the Saracens their neighbours in Spain, who were great inventors of apologues. The French have a very early metrical romance DE FORTUNE ET DE FELICITE, a tranſlation from Boethius's book DE CONSOLATIONE, by Reynault de Louens a Dominican friar <note n="b" place="bottom">See Mem. Lit. tom. xviii. p. 74<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. 4<hi rend="sup">to</hi>. And tom. vii. 293. 294. I have before mentioned John of Meun's tranſlation of Boethius. It is in verſe. John de Langres is ſaid to have made a tranſlation in proſe, about 1336. It is highly probable that Chaucer tranſlated Boethius from ſome of the French tranſlations. In the Bodleian library there is an EXPLANATIO of Boe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thius's CONSOLATION by our countryman Nicholas Trivett, who died before 1329.</note>. From this ſource, among many others of the Provencial poems, came the Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of ANTICHRIST above-mentioned, which contains a combat of the Virtues and Vices <note n="c" place="bottom">See ſupr. p. 285.</note>: the Romaunt of Richard de Liſle, in which MODESTY fighting with LUST<note n="d" place="bottom">PUTERIE.

Viſions were a branch of this ſpecies of poetry, which admitted the moſt licentious excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of fancy in forming perſonifications, and in feigning imaginary b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oduction of Provence.</p>
            <p>But the principal ſubject of their poems, dictated in great meaſure by the ſpirit of chivalry, was love: eſpecially among the troubadours of rank and diſtinction, whoſe caſtles being crowded with ladies, preſented perpetual ſcenes of the moſt ſplendid gallantry. This paſſion they ſpiritualiſed into various metaphyſical refinements, and filled it with abſtracted notions of viſionary perfection and felicity. Here too they were perhaps influenced by their neighbours the Saracens, whoſe philoſophy chiefly conſiſted of fantaſtic abſtractions. It is
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:0373500101:626"/>
manifeſt, however, that nothing can exceed the profound pedantry with which they treated this favorite argument. They defined the eſſence and characteriſtics of true love with all the parade of a Scotiſt in his profeſſorial chair: and bewildered their imaginations in ſpeculative queſtions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the moſt deſperate or the moſt happy ſituations of a ſincere and ſentimental heart <note n="e" place="bottom">In the mean time the greateſt libertie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Not long afterwards, on the ſame principle, a ſociety was eſtabliſhed in Languedoc, called the <hi>Fraternity of the Penitents of Love.</hi> Enthuſiaſm was here carried to as high a pitch of extravagance as ever it was in religion. It was a contention of ladies and gentlemen, who ſhould beſt ſuſtain the honour of their amorous fanaticiſm.

In winter, their love again perverted the nature of the ſeaſons: they then cloathed themſelves in the lighteſt and thinneſt ſtuffs which could be procured. It was a crime to wear fur on a day of the moſt piercing cold; or to appear with a hood, cloak, gloves, or muff. The flame of love kept them ſufficiently warm. Fires, all the winter,

            <p>The early univerſality of the French language greatly contributed to facilitate the circulation of the poetry of the troubadours in other countries. The Frankiſh language was familiar even at Conſtantinople and its dependent provinces in the eleventh century, and long afterwards.

Petrarch's refined ideas of love are chiefly drawn from thoſe amorous reveries of the Provencials which I have above deſcribed; heightened perhaps by the Platonic ſyſtem, and exaggerated by the ſubtiliſing ſpirit of Italian fancy. Varchi and Pignatelli have written profeſſed treatiſes on the nature of Petrarch's love. But neither they, nor the reſt of the Italians who, to this day, continue to debate a point of ſo much conſequence, conſider how powerfully Petrarch muſt have been influenced to talk of love in ſo peculiar a ſtrain by ſtudying the poets of Provence.

The French and Italian poets, whom Chaucer imitates, abound in allegorical perſonages: and it is remarkable, that the early poets of Greece and Rome were fond of theſe creations. Homer has given us, STRIFE, CONTENT<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ON, FEAR, TERROR, TUMULT, DESIRE, PERSUASION, and BENEVOLENCE. We have in Heſiod, DARKNESS, and many others, if the Shield of Hercules be of his hand. COMUS occurs in the Agamemnon of Eſchylus; and in the Promet heus of the ſame poet, STRENGTH and FORCE are two perſons of the drama, and perform the capital parts. The fragments of Ennius indicate, that his poetry conſiſted much of perſoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications. He ſays, that in one of the Carthaginian wars, the gigantic image of SORROW appeared in every place: <q rend="inline">"Omnibus endo locis ingens apparet imago TRISTITIAS."</q> Lucretius has drawn the great and terrible figure of SU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PERSTITION, <q rend="inline">"Quae caput e coeli regionibus oſtende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat."</q> He alſo mentions, in a beautiful proceſſion of the Seaſons, CALOR ARIDUS, HYEMS, and ALGUS. He introduces MEDICINE <hi>muttering with ſilent fear,</hi> in the midſt of the deadly peſtilence at Athens. It ſeems to have eſcaped the many critics who have written on Milton's noble but romantic alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory of SIN and DEATH, that he took the perſon of Death from the Alceſtis of his favorite tragedian Euripides, where ΘΑΝΑΤΟΣ is a principal agent in the drama. As knowledge and learning encreaſe, poetry begins to deal leſs in imagination: and theſe fantaſtic beings give way to real manners and living characters.</p>

            <p>AN INDEX TO THE HISTORY OF ENGLISH POETRY By THOMAS WARTON, B. D. FELLOW OF TRINITY COLLEGE, OXFORD, AND OF THE SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES, AND LATE PROFESSOR OF POETRY IN THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD.</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>THE Index to WARTON'S HISTORY of ENGLISH POETRY, which is here presented to the world, was not originally intended for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication. The great inconvenience arising from the want of its assistance, must have been severely felt by all who have, in the course of their literary pursuits, had occasion to refer to this noble treasure of poetical knowledge. To obviate the disadvantage, as it related exclusively to himself, the compiler, at a period of leisure, drew out the present Index. The experience of its utility suggested the idea of multiplying the copies, by which it is trusted that a commendable service has been rendered to literature. Though none can with reason think these pages wholly useless, some may not find it needful to their studies to possess them; therefore, it has been thought fit to suffer the impression of them to fall far short of that of the History. It does not exceed one-fourth of the number.</p>
            <p>Whether an entire Index of the three volumes together would not have been a plan more desirable than that which has been pursued, is a question not now to be examined. It has been considered, and this is the reply: The HISTORY of ENGLISH POETRY is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finished work. The learned and elegant historian was "gathered to his fathers" almost in the midst of his instructive and entertaining labours. Much yet remains to be done; and as it is the reverse of improbable that some other foot (we <hi>faintly</hi> hope, <hi>"passibus aequis,")</hi> will traverse the ground, which he has left untrodden, it cannot be denied, that with regard to uniformity, a separate table to each volume was the preferable mode to adopt.</p>
            <p>If an Index be copious and correct, it possesses the first qualities belonging to the nature of such an undertaking. This merit, as far as human diligence could succeed, the compiler claims, with, in his opinion, the no mean praise of having been useful.</p>
