            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                           <hi>Stanza</hi> II. 3.] Pindar was contemporary with Ariſtides and Cimon, in whom the glory of ancient Greece was at its height. When Xerxes invaded Greece Pindar was true to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon intereſt of his country, though his fellow-citizens the Thebans had ſold themſelves to the Perſian king. In one of his odes he expreſſes the great diſtreſs and anxiety of his mind occaſioned by the vaſt preparations of Xerxes againſt Greece, <bibl>(<hi>Iſthm.</hi> viii.)</bibl> in another he celebrates the victories of Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis, Plataea, and Himera, <bibl>(<hi>Pyth.</hi> i.)</bibl> It will be neceſſary to add two or three other particulars of his life, real or fabulous, in order to explain what follows in the text concerning him. Firſt, then, he was thought to be ſo great a favourite of Apollo that the prieſts of that deity allotted him a conſtant ſhare of their offerings. It was ſaid of him as of ſome other illuſtrious men, that at his birth a ſwarm of bees lighted on his lips and fed him with their honey: it was alſo a tradition concerning him that Pan was heard to recite his poetry, and ſeen dancing to one of his hymns on the mountains near Thebes. But a real hiſtorical fact in his life is, that the Thebans impoſed a large fine upon him on account of the veneration which he expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his poems for that heroick ſpirit ſhewn by the people of Athens in defence of the common liberty which his own fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-citizens had ſhamefully betrayed; and as the argument of this ode implies that great poetical talents and high ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of liberty do reciprocaily produce and aſſiſt each other, ſo Pindar is perhaps the moſt exemplary proof of this connexion which occurs in hiſtory. The Thebans were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in general for a ſlaviſh diſpoſition through all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of their commonwealth at the time of its ruin by Philip, and even in its beſt ſtate under the adminiſtration of Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidas and Epaminondas; and every one knows they were no leſs remarkable for great dulneſs and want of all genius. That Pindar ſhould have equally diſtinguiſhed himſelf from the reſt of his fellow-citizens in both theſe reſpects ſeems ſomewhat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, and is ſcarce to be accounted for but by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding obſervation.</note>

               <head>AN EPISTLE TO CURIO<note n="*" place="bottom">Curio was a young Roman Senator of diſtinguiſhed rank and parts. Being profuſely extravagant he ſoon diſſipated a ſplendid fortune, to ſupply the want of which he entered into the deſigns of Caeſar againſt the liberties of his country, altho' he had formerly been a profeſſed enemy to him. Cicero, to whoſe care he had been committed upon his firſt entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Forum, exerted himſelf to prevent his ruin, but without effect, and he became one of the firſt victims in the Civil war. This Epiſtle was firſt publiſhed in the 1744, when a celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted patriot was ſuppoſed to have deſerted the cauſe of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The Author afterwards transformed it into the Ode to Curio, <q rend="inline">"a performance diſgraceful only to its Author,"</q> ſays a celebrated writer. The Epiſtle, which is too curious to be omitted, we here give in its original form. The Ode is printed p. 31. of this volume.</note>.</head>

                        <p>℣. 25. <hi>—Love—Elder than Chaos.</hi>] Heſiod in his Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gony gives a different account, and makes Chaos the eldeſt of beings, though he aſſigns to Love neither father nor ſuperiour, which circumſtance is particularly mentioned by Phaedrus in Plato's Banquet as being obſervable not only in Heſiod but in all other writers both of verſe and proſe, and on the ſame occaſion he cites a line from Parmenides, in which Love is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly ſtyled the eldeſt of all the gods. Yet Ariſtophanes, in The Birds, affirms that <q rend="inline">"Chaos and Night, and Erebus and Tartarus, were firſt, and that Love was produced from an egg which the ſable-winged Night depoſited in the immenſe boſom of Erebus."</q> But it muſt be obſerved that the Love deſigned by this comick poet was always diſtinguiſhed from the other, from that original and ſelfexiſtent being the ΤΟ ΟΝ or ΑΓΑΘΟΝ of Plato, and meant only the ΔΗΜΙΟΥΡΓΟΣ or ſecond perſon of the old Grecian trinity, to whom is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed an hymn among thoſe which paſs under the name of Orpheus, where he is called Protogonos, or the Firſt-begotten, is ſaid to have been born of an egg, and is repreſented as the principal or origin of all theſe external appearances of Nature. In the Fragments of Orpheus collected by Henry Stephens he is named Phanes, the Diſcoverer or Diſcloſer, who unfolded the ideas of the Supreme Intelligence, and expoſed them to the perception of inferiour beings in this viſible frame of the world, as Mocrobius, and Proclus, and Athenagoras, all agree to interpret the ſeveral paſſages of Orpheus which they have preſerved.</p>
                        <p>But the Love deſigned in our text is the one ſelfexiſtent and Infinite Mind, whom if the generality of ancient mythologiſts have not introduced or truly deſcribed in accounting for the production of the world and its appearances, yet to a modern poet it can be no objection that he hath ventured to differ from them in this particular, though in other reſpects he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth to imitate their manner and conform to their opinions; for in theſe great points of natural theology they differ no leſs remarkably among themſelves, and are perpetually confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the philoſophical relations of things with the traditionary circumſtances of mythick hiſtory; upon which very account Callimachus in his Hymn to Jupiter declareth his diſſent from them concerning even an article of the national creed, adding that the ancient bards were by no means to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on. And yet in the exordium of the old Argonautick poem aſcribed to Orpheus it is ſaid that <q rend="inline">"Love, whom mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals in later times call Phanes, was the father of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally begotten Night,"</q> who is generally repreſented by theſe mytholOgical poets as being herſelf the parent of all things and who in The Indigitamenta, or Orphick Hymns, is ſaid to be the ſame with Cypris, or Love itſelf. Moreover, in the body of this Argonautick poem, where the perſonated Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheus introduceth himſelf ſinging to his lyre in reply to Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, he celebrateth <q rend="inline">"the obſcure memory of Chaos, and the natures which it contained within itſelf in a ſtate of perpetual viciſſitude; how the heaven had its boundary determined, the generation of the earth, the depth of the ocean, and alſo the ſapient Love, the moſt ancient, the ſelf-ſufficient, with all the beings which he produced when he ſeparated one thing from another:"</q> which noble paſſage is more directly to Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle's purpoſe in the firſt book of his Metaphyſicks than any of thoſe which he has there quoted to ſhew that the ancient poets and mythologiſts agreed with Empedocles, Anaxagoras, and the other more ſober philoſophers, in that natural antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation and common notion of mankind concerning the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of mind and reaſon to account for the connexion, motion, and good order of the world. For though neither this poem nor the hymns which paſs under the ſame name are, it ſhould ſeem, the work of the real Orpheus, yet beyond all queſtion they are very ancient. The hymns more particularly are allowed to be older than the invaſion of Greece by Xerxes, and were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably a ſet of publick and ſolemn forms of devotion, as appears by a paſſage in one of them, which Demoſthenes hath almoſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally cited in his firſt oration againſt Ariſtogiton, as the ſaying of Orpheus, the founder of their moſt holy myſteries. On this account they are of higher authority than any other mytholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical work now extant, the Theogony of Heſiod himſelf not excepted. The poetry of them is often extremely noble, and the myſterious air which prevails in them, together with its delightful impreſſion upon the mind, cannot be better expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than in that remarkable deſcription with which they inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the German editor Eſchenbach when he accidentally met with them at Leipſick: <q rend="inline">"Theſaurum me reperiſſe credidi,"</q> ſays he, <q rend="inline">"et proſecto theſaurum reperi.

As to the three Fates or Deſtinies of the poets, they repreſented that part of the general ſyſtem of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cauſes which relate to man and to other mortal beings, for ſo we are told in the hymn addreſſed to them among the Orphick Indigitamenta, where they are called the daughters of Night (or Love) and contrary to the vulgar notion are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by the epithets of Gentle and Tenderhearted.
