            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IN writing a Hiſtory of the <hi>Union,</hi> it could not be reaſonably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that I ſhould go any farther than the Finiſhing, Ratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Exchanging the Treaty in the Reſpective Parliaments of the two Nations to be United—and this I think I have Finiſhed in the following Sheets.</p>
            <p>However, ſince the Work has lyen longer in the Preſs than I at firſt Expected; and ſome Remarkable things have in Conſequence of, and very much Depending upon the <hi>UNION</hi> happened ſince, I could not Satisfy my ſelf, without giving a ſhort Abridgement of the State of Things, between the Time of Finiſhing the Treaty, and the Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Work, which tho it be rather a Kind of Summary Reca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulation of things, than a Historical Narration, may yet be Equally Profitable to him that ſhall Enquire into the Affairs of the United Kingdoms at that Time.</p>
            <p>The Union took Place, as has been Noted the 1ſt of <hi>May</hi> 1707, The Management of the Revenue, the Trials in the <hi>Exchequer</hi> and <hi>Admirality,</hi> were all Settled on a New Foot, Commiſſioners of the <hi>Cuſtoms, Exciſe</hi> and <hi>Equivalent,</hi> were appointed; Judges of the Court of <hi>Exchequer;</hi> a New <hi>Admirality,</hi> and their reſpective Offices were all fix'd; the Coin was Reformed, and entirely Reduc'd to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Standard <hi>(the ſmall Copper Money only Excepted)</hi> Weights and Meaſures were Regulated in part, and the reſpective Alterations and Models, whether in Government, or Commerce, Enacted by the <hi>Union,</hi> began every where to be put in Practice.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Britiſh Parliament</hi> had been Aſſembled at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Treaty, and had been Concluded with a General Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; And Her Majeſty began to ſee the Compleat End of Her Wiſhes, in the <hi>Union</hi> being actually Conſummated; The <hi>Northern Peers</hi> and <hi>Commons Sitting,</hi> and that too with a General Satisfaction and Applauſe in that <hi>Firſt Parliament</hi> of <hi>Great Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this <hi>Parliament,</hi> ſeveral Things were done for the <hi>better Improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and as it was Called then, <hi>Rendring more Effectual,</hi> the <hi>UNION,</hi> particularly that of Diſſolving the <hi>Privy Council,</hi> Re-establiſhing the 
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0554400100:3"/>
               <hi>Seſſions</hi> of the <hi>Peace</hi> by <hi>Juſtices,</hi> &amp;c. Settling the <hi>Militia,</hi> and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Lord Lieutenants, Deputy Lieutenants,</hi> &amp;c. in every County <hi>as in England;</hi> of all which particular Mention is made in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Sheets—, ſeveral Regulations alſo in <hi>Trade</hi> were made here, for the Eaſe of <hi>North Britain;</hi> particularly the Removing the Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of bringing Foreign Imported <hi>Goods</hi> from <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> and the great Debate about the <hi>Wine, Brandy,</hi> &amp;c. brought into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in the Interval between the Finiſhing, and Effectual taking Place of the <hi>Union,</hi> was put to an End, entirely in the Favour of <hi>Scotland,</hi> every thing being Cleared at once, and all Interruptions of <hi>Commerce</hi> thereby Removed.</p>
            <p>But in the Middle of all this <hi>Harmony,</hi> an Accident interveen'd, which if it had not been Mercifully prevented by the immediate Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of a <hi>Divine Power,</hi> had at once Unravelled all this happily finiſhed <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> and that in a manner that the moſt Violent <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer</hi> of the <hi>Union,</hi> could not in his warmeſt Thoughts have honeſtly wiſhed to have ſeen.</p>
            <p>This was the <hi>French Invaſion;</hi> which Endangered not the <hi>Union</hi> only, but bid fair for Overturning the whole Frame of the preſent <hi>Eſtabliſhment</hi> in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> tearing up the very Foundation of our <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> I mean the <hi>Revolution;</hi> and Restoring, not only <hi>Tyranny</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Government,</hi> but even <hi>Popery</hi> it ſelf, that had ſo many Years ſince, and at ſuch Expence of Blood and Treaſure been Dethroned in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall need to bring very few Arguments to prove this, to have been the immediate Conſequence of the Succeſs of this Expedition, after I have given a Summary Account of the Matter of Fact, which is briefly as follows.</p>
            <p>About <hi>January</hi> 1707, frequent Advices from <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> gave the <hi>Government</hi> Notice, That the <hi>French</hi> were making great Preparations at <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> for ſome ſecret Expedition; upon far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Search into the Matter of Fact, it appeared that ſeveral Men of War were fitting out there with the utmost Expedition, and unuſual Quantities of Arms and Ammunition providing, with a large Train of Artillery; which were all to be Shipped forthwith on Board the Ships fitting up as above.</p>
            <p>Theſe Advices were ſtill Seconded with others, till at last the <hi>French</hi> themſelves making it no longer a Secret, and ſome of the Men of War being ready, they Ordered the Stores, Arms and Ammunition to be actually Shipped on Board, drew their Troops down to the Shore, and Openly Declared that this Expedition was Deſigned for <hi>Scotland,</hi> to Re-inſtate the King of <hi>Great Britain, So they Stiled the Pretender,</hi> in the Poſſeſſion of his Lawful <hi>Dominions,</hi> as <hi>they Called them,</hi> and this they ſaid was done at the Earnest Request of his Subjects in that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>It is true, and <hi>moſt People thought it reaſonable to judge,</hi> that it was not probable, the King of <hi>France</hi> would Embark in a Deſign of ſo Great Conſequence, had he not received Invitations from <hi>Scotland:</hi> Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the Deſign not Succeeding, thoſe Correſpondences never came to
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0554400100:4"/> be effectually diſcover'd; And therefore the <hi>Houſe of Lords</hi> in their Addreſs to <hi>Her Majeſty</hi> take Notice, That the King of <hi>France</hi> making an Attempt to invade <hi>Her Majeſties</hi> Dominions with ſuch a contemptible Force, was a ſufficient Evidence that he must have Encouragment from ſome Perſon in <hi>Scotland</hi> diſaffected to <hi>Her Majeſties Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, The strictest Inquiſition after theſe Correſpondencies could never make any conſiderable Diſcovery, tho many Perſons were taken up, which ſeemed to be owing rather to the Miſcarriage of the Deſign, the <hi>French</hi> never coming on Shore with any <hi>Forces,</hi> and their Friends on Shore being too politick to ſhow themſelves till they ſaw their Troops on Shore, and in ſome Poſture and Condition to protect them;—There were ſeveral Gentlemen taken up upon general Suſpicions, which however it gave ſome Offence to the People, yet was thought neceſſary at that time, <hi>of which by and by.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About the End of <hi>February,</hi> theſe Preparations of the <hi>French</hi> were come to ſuch a Height, and the Deſign of invading <hi>Scotland ſo out of doubt,</hi> that the <hi>Government</hi> here thought it high Time to prepare for the Defence of <hi>Scotland:</hi> And to that Purpoſe, <hi>Her Majeſty</hi> wrote a Letter to the <hi>Privy Council</hi> in <hi>Scotland (which, tho determined to expire by an Act of Parliament, yet was in Being, and had Power to act, till the firſt Day of</hi> May <hi>following.)</hi> In this Letter, <hi>Her Majeſty</hi> gave them Notice that ſhe had received Information of an <hi>Intended Invaſion</hi> back'd with a <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Popiſh Power,</hi> deſign'd againſt <hi>Scotland</hi> in Favour of the <hi>Pretender;</hi>—And therefore recommended to them the Security of the Kingdom, the Preſervation of the publick Peace, and that they would uſe all poſſible Means to that Effect.</p>
            <p>In the mean Time, Vigorous Preparations were made in <hi>England</hi> for preventing the Deſigns of the <hi>French,</hi> as well by equipping a Fleet to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept them at Sea, and ſo prevent their Landing; as by providing Forces to give them a warm Reception, in caſe they ſhould land in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know there were Complaints made, and Endeavours uſed to expoſe the Conduct of the <hi>Government</hi> in their Preparations; ſuggeſting, That due Care was not taken to put <hi>Scotland</hi> in a Poſture of Defence in caſe the <hi>French</hi> had landed: and a certain <hi>Noble Perſon</hi> cauſed the Letters of the <hi>E.</hi> of <hi>Leven</hi> the <hi>General</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which were written in the midſt of that <hi>Hurry,</hi> and in which his <hi>Lordſhip</hi> wrote in preſſing Terms for Aſſiſtance, to be Printed;—But when theſe Things came to be Examin'd in <hi>Parliament,</hi> it appeared otherwiſe than thoſe Gentlemen repreſented, and the <hi>Parliament</hi> receiv'd full Satisfaction, that all the Diligence was uſed which the Nature of the Thing would admit,—<hi>But be that as it will,</hi> by the Event we found that <hi>Providence</hi> bleſſed the Meaſures taken, ſo as that they not only prevented the Execution of the Deſign at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> but diſpirited the Party in ſuch a Manner, that they durst not make the Attempt any where elſe, which they might have done with too much Effect, and might but too well have made themſelves Amends for the Diſappointment, by ruining the Country, and keeping the Affairs of <hi>Britain</hi> in longer Suſpence.</p>
            <p>I ſhall however, without meddling with theſe Diſputes which are dead with the Thing, ſhow by the meer Relation of Fact, That <hi>England</hi> was in no
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0554400100:5"/>
Condition to have made any Preparation that could have been effectual to prevent the Landing of the French;—And thus all they had done, as to Stores, Magazines, or Arms, as the Thing then ſtood, had been only leaving the greater Booty to the Enemy, and furniſhing them with Weapons to uſe against our ſelves,—Since the Number of Troops, or the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Fortifications of <hi>Scotland</hi> were ſuch as could make no tolerable Reſiſtance, nor ſo much as protect the Magazines, if any had been E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.</p>
            <p>But to return to the Preparations made in <hi>England:</hi>—<hi>Firſt,</hi> with <hi>Incredible Celerity,</hi> all the Men of War that could be found in any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition were fitted out, mann'd, and victualled in Order to put to Sea, and wait for the Enemies Fleet;—And the Expedition in this Caſe was ſo ſurpriſing, That the <hi>French</hi> who had been inform'd that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Navy was in no Condition to offer them any Diſturbance in their Deſign, and upon which Preſumption, they own'd afterward they made their Deſign publick; found to their Diſappointment ſixteen <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men of War cruiſing before <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> before they (the <hi>French</hi>) were in any Condition to put to Sea—This however did not put a Stop to their Deſign,—but they went on with their Equipment; And their Fleet being ready, they embark'd their Troops about the fifth of <hi>March,</hi> their whole Force conſiſting of <hi>Twenty eight Sail</hi> of <hi>Ships,</hi> whereof ſixteen were <hi>Men of War,</hi> and twelve were large <hi>Friggots</hi> or <hi>Privateers;</hi>—Their <hi>Land-Forces</hi> conſiſted of 15<hi> French Battalions,</hi> and about 300<hi> Volunteers,</hi> the most part <hi>Iriſh,</hi> being to ſerve as <hi>Officers</hi> for the raiſing <hi>New Regiments</hi> in <hi>Scotland;</hi>—Theſe Forces being on Board with the <hi>Pretender,</hi> and ſome few <hi>Scots</hi> Gentlemen, particularly, the two Sons of the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Middletoun,</hi> with the Old Lord <hi>Griffin, &amp;c.</hi> They came out of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> about the ſixth of <hi>March,</hi> commanded by the <hi>French</hi> Admiral <hi>Monſieur Fourbin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Time the Diligence of our <hi>Admiralty</hi> was ſuch, tho <hi>England</hi> was at that Time very bare of Ships, that the <hi>Engliſh Squadron</hi> before <hi>Dunkirk</hi> was made up to 36 Sail, including ſome <hi>Dutch Men of War,</hi> that had alſo joined them; And as the <hi>French</hi> Fleet lay in <hi>Newport Pits,</hi> watching an Opportunity to ſail, ſo the <hi>Engliſh</hi> lay off of <hi>Graveline,</hi> ready to ſtart with them, and reſolv'd, <hi>if poſſible,</hi> to engage them in their <hi>Paſſage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, The <hi>French</hi> truſting to their <hi>Canvas;</hi> the Cleanneſs of their <hi>Bottoms,</hi> and their <hi>Nimble Sailing,</hi> reſolved to put to Sea; tho, <hi>as it were,</hi> in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iew of a ſuperior Force: And accordingly, the Wind blowing freſh at <hi>North-weſt,</hi> they weighed and ſet Sail;—The various Courſe of the Fleets, and the Succeſs, as to the ſailing part, was the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of much Diſcourſe: I ſhall therefore be the Exacter in it, ſince it was wondred very much, how the <hi>French</hi> who lay in View of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Fleet could ſo get the Start of them, as to be at the <hi>Firth</hi> of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> about two Days before them; By which, had they not overſhot their Port, they might have fairly put their Deſign in Execution, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the Power of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet at their Heels.</p>
            <p>The Wind, as I noted before, blew at <hi>North-weſt,</hi> a freſh Gale, and the <hi>French</hi> weighing upon the Top of High Water, went away with the
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0554400100:6"/>
Tide of Ebb to the <hi>North-</hi> ward, keeping the <hi>Dutch</hi> Coaſt on Board, which was then the Weather-Shore.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> lying in <hi>Gravling-Pits,</hi> had the following Diſadvantages in the Purſuit; <hi>Firſt,</hi> That it was about <hi>Eight Hours</hi> after the <hi>French</hi> were ſailed, before they could get Notice of it, and be under Sail.</p>
            <p>It was indeed wondred at by ſome, why the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet knowing very well that the <hi>French</hi> were deſigned for <hi>Scotland,</hi> which was <hi>North:</hi> and that they lay in <hi>Newport</hi> Road, ſhould <hi>themſelves</hi> ly in <hi>Graveling,</hi> which was at leaſt 25 Miles to the <hi>South;</hi>—By which Means, when ever the French ſhould ſail, they would neceſſarily be-behind them a conſiderable Way.</p>
            <p>But this is Anſwered by the Sailers, and which I ſhall not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to confute, <hi>viz.</hi> that it blew very hard, the Wind at <hi>North,</hi> and <hi>North</hi>-weſt: And there was no other Place where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet could ride with Safety:</p>
            <p>I ſhall leave this Diſpute as I find it, and content my ſelf with only naming it, as I ſhall others that came after it.—</p>
            <p>Be it as it will, the Matter of Fact was ſo;—The <hi>French</hi> Fleet being ſailed about Eight Hours before,—Advice was brought to Sir <hi>George Bing,</hi> who weigh'd with all Expedition, and followed with all the Sail he could make.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>George</hi> had alſo another Diſadvantage, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>French</hi> ſailing with the first of the Ebb, he loſt a Tide of them—So that in their firſt Starting, the <hi>French</hi> had the Advantage of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Fleet, as follows.—<list>
                  <item>Eight Hours in Time,</item>
                  <item>Twenty five Miles in Space,</item>
                  <item>And the Ebb of the Tide.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>With theſe Helps, and having first left out the lower Tire of their Guns to make them Light for ſailing, their Ships being clean, and new fitted, the <hi>French</hi> Ships alſo being really better Sailers, generally ſpeaking, than ours: with theſe Helps, I ſay, they got a very great Start of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in their firſt ſetting out.</p>
            <p>When they came to Sea, another Thing happened, which gave them ae yet farther Advantage of the <hi>Engliſh;</hi>—The <hi>French</hi> Fleet kept a large <hi>Offing,</hi> as they call it, keeping to <hi>Windward</hi> all the Way rather nearer the <hi>German</hi> Coaſt than the <hi>Britiſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet bore away for their own Coast, and were ſeen off of <hi>Loeſtof</hi> and <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> and from the Shore of <hi>Norfolk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reaſons for this different ſhaping their Courſe ſeem theſe;—The <hi>French</hi> were by all means poſſible to avoid the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Shore, leſt they ſhould be taken ſhort by the Wind, and might be Embay'd, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently Overtaken, having a Superior Force behind them. Alſo it was not fit for them to be ſeen before they came to the <hi>Firth,</hi> that they might not give the <hi>Alarm</hi> to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to be ready for them.</p>
            <p>On the other Hand, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> made their own Coast, leſt the <hi>French</hi> ſhould fallin there with their <hi>Merchants,</hi> and ſweep the Coaſt of their Ships: Which had they done, they might indeed have made great <hi>Havock.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However it was, theſe Diſadvantages gave the <hi>French</hi> ſuch a Start of
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0554400100:7"/>
the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that they were on the Coaſt of <hi>Scotland</hi> two Days before the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet, and had not <hi>Heaven</hi> blinded their <hi>Pilots,</hi> ſo as to miſs their Port, they might have put their Deſign in Execution in Spight of all our Forces.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Friday March</hi> the 12<hi>th,</hi> they made the Coast of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but found themſelves the Hight of <hi>Montroſs,</hi> about fifteen Leagues to the North of the <hi>Mouth</hi> of the <hi>Firth</hi> of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>—Here they made Signals, and ſome Boats going off to them, they were Informed where they were,—then they ſtood away Southward, and ſpent all that Day before they got to the <hi>Mouth</hi> of the <hi>Firth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now they ſent one Ship, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Saliſbury,</hi> up the <hi>Firth,</hi> whether it was to make any Signal to their Party, to give Notice of their Coming, Or to get any Intelligence, remains yet Undetermined;—they made the <hi>Firth</hi> juſt as the Tide was ſpent, and were therefore Obliged to ſpend ſix Hours more at Anchor, under the Iſle of <hi>Maii</hi> in the <hi>Mouth</hi> of the <hi>Firth,</hi> and here, on the fourteenth early in the Morning, they find themſelves Overtaken, their <hi>Scouts</hi> Diſcovering the <hi>Engliſh Fleet</hi> ſtanding in for the <hi>Mouth</hi> of the <hi>Firth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here then, they find their <hi>Enterpriſe</hi> at an End, their Moments are gone, in which they might have put their Errand in Execution,—and now they have no more to do, but to make the beſt of their Way to Sea.</p>
            <p>Upon this, therefore they Weigh, and ſtand away for the <hi>North,</hi> with all the Sail they can make, and the <hi>Engliſh Fleet</hi> after them.</p>
            <p>The Foremost of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships came often within Gunſhot of them, but not ſo many as could stop their <hi>Fleet,</hi> or bring them to Engage,—but they maintained a Kind of a Runing <hi>Fight</hi> with thoſe of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> that Purſued, in which little Harm was done on either Side, ſave that in the Night, one of their Ships being the <hi>Saliſbury,</hi> formerly taken from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> fell in among the <hi>Engliſh Fleet,</hi> and being Surrounded was Taken.</p>
            <p>With this Booty, and the <hi>French</hi> Out-ſailing the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> Sir <hi>George Bing</hi> having Purſued them to the North-east Point of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> Called <hi>Buchan-neſs,</hi> ſeen them ſeveral Leagues to the North of that, and at last loſt Sight of them, he returned to the <hi>Firth</hi> of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh;</hi> And keeping his <hi>Fleet</hi> in a Sailing Posture, with his <hi>Scouts</hi> continually Abroad to gain Intelligence of the <hi>Enemy,</hi> he continued in the <hi>Firth</hi> till the Begining of <hi>April;</hi> When the Government having Intelligence that the <hi>French</hi> were Returned into <hi>Dunkirk</hi> with their <hi>Fleet,</hi> Sir <hi>George Bing</hi> was alſo Ordered Southward with the <hi>Engliſh Fleet,</hi> and ſo the whole War on that Side ended.</p>
            <p>I come now to ſpeak a little of the <hi>Preparations</hi> made by the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> by Land, in Order to Meet this New Eruption; ſuppoſing the <hi>French</hi> had Landed,—which indeed was not without Hazard.</p>
            <p>In Order to this, ſuch Troops as were at Hand, were immediately Ordered to March Northward, particularly they ſent away two Troops of the Queens Horſe Guards, the Duke of <hi>Northumberland's</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Horſe, with the three Regiments of Dragoons of <hi>Eſſex, Raby</hi> and <hi>Carpenter;</hi> beſides which, two Regiments of Dragoons, and one
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0554400100:8"/>
Regiment of Horſe were Ordered to March to the North of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to ly ready there, to be Embark'd on the first Orders.</p>
            <p>Of Foot there were Thirteen Battalions then in <hi>England</hi> ſent for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, including the Queens Guards, and ſome new Raiſed not quite Compleat, and Ten Battalions from <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is to be Noted, That as ſoon as ever the Certainty of the Deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Invaſion</hi> came to the Knowledge of the <hi>States,</hi> they Ordered Tranſports immediately to Carry Ten Battalions of <hi>Britiſh</hi> Troops to <hi>England,</hi> to Aſſist the Queens Troops there; and when Sir <hi>George Bing</hi> Purſued the <hi>French Fleet,</hi> as above, he ſent <hi>Admiral Baker,</hi> with Twelve Men of War into <hi>Holland,</hi> to bring thoſe Troops away to <hi>New Caſtle</hi> upon <hi>Tyne,</hi> that ſo being Landed there, they might be ready to joyn the Land Army, and the Ships to joyn the Fleet.</p>
            <p>The Forces being thus Appointed, Marched all Northward, but the Rendezvous was Appointed at <hi>York;</hi> For the Generals knowing the Troops in <hi>Scotland</hi> to be Weak, and not aſſured how the People there would behave themſelves in general, had Reſolved not to March any Troops into <hi>Scotland,</hi> till the whole Army was Aſſembled, that they might March in a Body—and to this Purpoſe the Earl of <hi>Leven,</hi> with theſe few Forces he had in <hi>Scotland,</hi> was Ordered, if he could not Prevent their Landing, to make his Retreat to <hi>Berwick.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>It may be thought by ſome remote to my Purpoſe to Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate this; But when I conſider, what Differing Notions the People in <hi>England</hi> have of the Attempt of the <hi>French,</hi> and of their Succeſs in it; I can not think it an Uſeleſs La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to give you a Brief Eſſay, at what the Event of that Enterprize might probably have been,—that ſo we may ſee what we have to be thankful for.</p>
            <p>I am now to ſuppoſe the <hi>French</hi> Safe on Shore, their Magazine and Train of Artillery Landed, and the Earl of <hi>Leven</hi> the <hi>General for Her Majeſty,</hi> Retreating towards <hi>Berwick,</hi> as he must undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly have done,—and <hi>as his Orders directed him to do</hi>—, without which his Retreat being Cut off, he must have been Surrounded and Taken, or have been Cut in Pieces, having no Place of Strength to Retreat to.</p>
            <p>Had they been thus on <hi>Shore,</hi> there is no Doubt, but in two Hours they had been Maſters of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> an open City, and without De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; the <hi>Caſtle</hi> indeed might have Held Out ſome Time, but the <hi>City</hi> could have made no Reſistance.—But that which was worſe, the Circumſtances of the Time was ſuch, and the People were ſo Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, that the <hi>City</hi> must have ſent down to <hi>Leith</hi> to have ſought Protection from the <hi>French</hi> against their own Rabbles, and they muſt have Deſired the <hi>French</hi> to have Come and Taken them into their Protection, to have Preſerved them from Plunder and Confuſion.</p>
            <p>I think <hi>whatever the Reaſons of this were,</hi> which I deſire to bury in Silence, the Fact will be readily granted; and indeed all Men owned at that Time, that if the <hi>French</hi> Landed their Forces, they muſt be Master of the City of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> without any Oppoſition.</p>
            <p>It is true that I am now but upon Suggestion and meer Suppoſition, and I do not Affirm poſitively; But I leave it to any Man to judge of Probabilities, and whether what I Suggeſt is Rational or no;—When the <hi>French</hi> were thus Poſſeſt of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> it is very reaſonable to Imagine that the firſt Thing they would have done, was to <hi>Proclaim</hi> their <hi>King:</hi> If the Magiſtrates of the <hi>City</hi> would not have Agreed to have Performed the <hi>Ceremony,</hi> the <hi>Tolbooth</hi> was near at Hand, and the <hi>Citizens</hi> being Aſſembled, could ſoon have Choſen New <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> who would Chearfully have done it—.</p>
            <p>Their King being Proclaimed, it ſeems Rational to Suppoſe, they ſhould next Summon the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> to take an <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Fidelity</hi> to him; Such as Refuſed would have their <hi>Eſtates Confiſcated,</hi> and perhaps be Impriſoned; and if they got Room to Flee, would have their Houſes Plundred.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="x" facs="tcp:0554400100:11"/>
Being thus Maſters of the <hi>Capital,</hi> and the <hi>Queens</hi> Troops having Fled or Retreated towards <hi>Berwick,</hi> the Country expoſed to their Power; I think I make no Treſpaſs on good Manners or Juſtice, if I ſay, The Northern <hi>High-landers</hi> would have been ſoon Raiſed by the Influence of their <hi>Superiors,</hi> who are for the moſt part <hi>Jacobites,</hi>—Theſe being in Arms, the <hi>Low-Lands</hi> are at their Mercy, and they had ſoon Poſſeſt themſelves of the whole <hi>Country,</hi> the <hi>Militia</hi> being entirely without a <hi>Head,</hi> and without Order, Unlockt from the former Settlement; and Unfixt in a New.</p>
            <p>Being thus Poſſeſt of the <hi>Low-Lands,</hi> they ſoon would have been <hi>Maſter</hi> of the whole <hi>Country;</hi> and indeed there was very Few that Durſt ſhow their Faces againſt them, the Forwardneſs of One Party, and the Diviſions and Diſorders of the Other making Way for it,—when they had thus Reduc'd the <hi>Low-Lands,</hi> they had no more to do, than to call a <hi>Convention</hi> of <hi>Eſtates,</hi> as at the <hi>Revolution;</hi> and finding theſe Faſt to their <hi>Intereſt;</hi> The firſt <hi>Laws</hi> ſhould be to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcind the <hi>Revolution,</hi> Declare the <hi>Limited Succeſſion</hi> a <hi>Viſible Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,</hi> and an <hi>Invaſion</hi> of the <hi>Right</hi> of another—, and thus a compleat National Turn ſhould have paſs'd upon us—, and the <hi>Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution</hi> ſhould ſuffer a <hi>Re-revolution</hi> in a few Weeks, <hi>for theſe things would require but little Time:</hi> Neither is it Preſumption to Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, they ſhould have gotten a <hi>Repreſentative</hi> returned, that would have come into ſuch Meaſures, ſince they having the Abſolute Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>Country,</hi> the Influencing them under ſuch Circumstances, to the Chooſing ſuch Perſons as they ſhould think fit to put upon them was eaſie enough,—Inſtances of which have been but too Common in this <hi>Iſland,</hi> under a leſs Tyrannical Power than a <hi>French</hi> Army.</p>
            <p>While they were thus Settling their <hi>Civil Government</hi>—, Their <hi>Military Affairs</hi> could not have failed; the Inclination of the Common People about <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and the Influence of the <hi>Chiefs</hi> and <hi>Heads</hi> of <hi>Clans</hi> in the <hi>High-Lands,</hi> would have ſoon furniſhed Men for New <hi>Revolutions,</hi>—The <hi>ſixteen</hi> Regiments which they brought with them, (ſo it ſeems they had determined) ſhould have had <hi>two hundred</hi> Men added to every Regiment, by way of filling up—five Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Dragoons,</hi> and <hi>fourty</hi> Battalions of <hi>Foot</hi> was to have been Raiſed immediately—; The Command of theſe Troops was to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>Iriſh</hi> Officers, and of ſuch, they brought great Numbers with them; ſave only that the <hi>Colonels</hi> and ſome <hi>Captains,</hi> were to be Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen of the <hi>Superiors</hi> or <hi>Chiefs</hi> where they were Raiſed, to Encourage the Raiſing them.</p>
            <p>Thus in leſs than ſix Weeks, they ſhould have had 30000 Men added to the Troops they brought with them—; The Money they would have given the <hi>High-Land Gentlemen,</hi> would Effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have brought theſe <hi>Gentlemen</hi> to Forſake their Party, and Joyn with them, and then the Deſign would have gone on beyond Expectation.</p>
            <p>We are next to Enquire what was to become of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration all this while? You have heard what <hi>Strength</hi> they were of when come together; But it could not be poſſible that they could be all brought together, their <hi>Magazines</hi> furniſhed, <hi>For the</hi> French <hi>would have taken Care, they ſhould have Subſiſted ill enough in</hi> Scotland, <hi>Their</hi> 
               <pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0554400100:12"/> Train of <hi>Artillery</hi> have been come up, and they in Condition to have Marched into <hi>Scotland</hi> in Battalia, as they muſt have done, under ſix Weeks or two Months—; the Difficulties of the Roads, <hi>the Country being at that Time very Deep,</hi> and the Carriages Heavy, would have made it very bad, Marching an <hi>Army</hi>—; and the Want of <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage</hi> would have made it Impracticable to have done it ſooner.</p>
            <p>All this Time the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Jacobites</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> would have had, to have Strengthned their <hi>New Settlement,</hi> form'd their <hi>Army,</hi> Fortified <hi>Leith,</hi> and other Places, and have prepared for War.</p>
            <p>I ſhall readily Grant as any Body can deſire, That when the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Army</hi> came to be ready, and to enter <hi>Scotland,</hi> they ſhould Beat theſe <hi>New Invaders</hi> out of all; and that they ſhould in Time pay Dear for the Attempt; But it muſt be granted, this would have theſe Conſequences withal, 1<hi>.</hi> That it would have Ruin'd <hi>Scotland.</hi> 2. Brought the <hi>Seat</hi> of <hi>War</hi> home to our own Doors. 3<hi>.</hi> Cauſe a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of our <hi>Forces,</hi> and be an Occaſion of withdrawing our <hi>Troops</hi> from <hi>Flanders,</hi> where the <hi>Enemy</hi> felt the greatest Weight of the <hi>War</hi>—. And 4<hi>.</hi> Have exceedingly protracted the <hi>War:</hi> Thoſe <hi>Gentlemen</hi> that were for having them Land, may Conſult theſe probable Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, and they will ſee whether they have not very good Reaſon to be ſenſible of the <hi>Happineſs</hi> of the Diſappointment.</p>
            <p>I can not but take Notice here, of the <hi>Temper</hi> of the <hi>People</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> at this Time; none will Doubt, but the Minds of Men were variouſly agitated as their ſeveral <hi>Tempers, Intereſt</hi> and <hi>Party</hi> guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them—, <hi>Hope</hi> on one Side, and <hi>Fear</hi> on the other Diſcovered it ſelf in a manner which both Sides would fain have Concealed, nor was there wanting a <hi>Party</hi> who openly and avowedly, profest their Deſires to have the <hi>French</hi> Land, and their <hi>Reſolution</hi> to joyn with them, and this in ſo Open, ſo Rude, and ſo Threatning a Manner, as gave juſt Cauſe of <hi>Terror</hi> to the Honest Loyal <hi>Party</hi> on the other Hand, who ſaw themſelves inevitably Ruin'd, <hi>if the</hi> French <hi>Landed,</hi> by their own Rabbles—, The other <hi>Party</hi> having openly Threatned and Mark'd out the <hi>Houſes</hi> of ſuch <hi>Families</hi> as were most Eminent for their <hi>Zeal</hi> to the Eſtabliſh't <hi>Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was Expected, and indeed Apprehended very much in <hi>England,</hi> that thoſe of the <hi>Preſbyterians,</hi> who had before Vigorouſly Appeared against the <hi>Union,</hi> and profeſt their Diſlike of it upon all Occaſions, would have Appeared against the <hi>Government,</hi> at this Juncture, and either have joyn'd with the <hi>Invaders,</hi> or have formed a Third <hi>Party,</hi> and ſo have made a Diviſion, which had in its Kind been equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fatal.</p>
            <p>But in this alſo they were diſappointed, for the People who were most warm againſt the <hi>Union,</hi> nay even the <hi>Weſtern Men</hi> who do not own or join with the <hi>Church,</hi> yet all as one Man declared againſt joining with <hi>French Invaders, Papiſts,</hi> and a <hi>Returning Tyranny,</hi> which they eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foreſaw muſt be the Conſequence of an <hi>Invaſion;</hi> And therefore lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide all their Old Animoſities, private Grudges, and Cavils at the <hi>Union, &amp;c.</hi> They unanimouſly declared their Reſolution to ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:0554400100:13"/>
and with their Lives and Eſtates to defend the <hi>Government</hi> and their <hi>Country</hi> againſt all the <hi>Powers</hi> of <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>Pretender;</hi> And to this End, they began to form Aſſociations, the Burghers of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> listed Men, and ſubſcribed, for their Maintenance, ſome 10, ſome 20, ſome more, and in other Places they were apreparing to do the like;—the <hi>Weſtern Men</hi> ſent them Word they would come and join with them, <hi>if there was Occaſion;</hi> And in the mean time ſome of the People called <hi>Cameronians</hi> made their open Proteſtation againſt it.</p>
            <p>This was a very great Encouragment to the <hi>Government</hi> at that Time, when the Vaunts of the other Party run high, and their Hopes were great; But <hi>GOD</hi> in his <hi>Providence</hi> prevented the evil Conſequences of this Affair, as you have heard: and the good People who had made great Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of <hi>Unanimity,</hi> found themſelves delivered another and an eaſier Way.</p>
            <p>It happened very well at this Time, That the <hi>Commiſſion</hi> of the <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> was juſt ſet down, and the <hi>Miniſters</hi> ſeeing the <hi>Storm</hi> coming, both on the <hi>Eccleſiaſtick,</hi> as well as <hi>Civil Liberties</hi> of the <hi>Nation, Religion</hi> and <hi>Property</hi> being viſibly struck at together in the <hi>Flood</hi> of <hi>Foreign Deſtruction,</hi> plainly Threatning to ſwallow up both—appointed a <hi>Solemn Faſt</hi> to be kept over the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
            <p>I ſhall make no <hi>Comments</hi> on the Subject Matter of this <hi>Faſt,</hi> the <hi>Act</hi> of the <hi>Commiſſion</hi> does ſufficiently ſhow the Senſe of the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> and in what Manner the <hi>Invaſion</hi> was like to reliſh among them; and therefore I have Inſerted it in this Place, to Record the <hi>Temper</hi> that appear'd at that Time; and what Hope the <hi>Pretender,</hi> or his <hi>Party</hi> had Ground to raiſe upon the ſuppoſed <hi>Diviſions</hi> of the <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> about the <hi>Union.</hi>

            <p>But this is not all, the Seaſonableneſs of this <hi>Solemn Faſt</hi> was
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:0554400100:15"/>
ſuch, and ſo Serviceable to the <hi>Government,</hi> being brought out at the very Juncture of Time, when the <hi>Eyes</hi> both of <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Enemies</hi> were upon them, that it muſt be acknowledged, it ſhewed not only the <hi>Zeal</hi> of the <hi>Preſbyterian Miniſters</hi> for the <hi>Queen,</hi> the <hi>Government</hi> and their Establiſht Intereſt; but it ſhewed their <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> in ſo happily timing an Action of that Determining Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and taking the very Moment of its being moſt Effectual, as well to Convince the <hi>Enemy,</hi> that they had nothing to expect that Way, but the whole United Force of the <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> againſt them—To ſatisfy the <hi>Government</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, <hi>among whom Jealouſies of the Contrary had been Induſtriouſly ſpread</hi>—, that the <hi>Preſbyterains,</hi> one and all would Declare againſt the <hi>Invaders;</hi>—<hi>as alſo,</hi> to Settle and Determin ſuch among themſelves, <hi>if any ſuch were,</hi> who might be otherwiſe unfix'd in their <hi>Reſolutions,</hi> and doubtful what <hi>Courſe</hi> to take.</p>
            <p>Nor was this all, but the <hi>Miniſters</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in their reſpective <hi>Pariſhes,</hi> upon the Occaſion of the ſaid <hi>Faſt,</hi> applyed themſelves to the Informing their <hi>People,</hi> what the real Views, and probable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of this <hi>Attempt</hi> were, what was Threatned to their <hi>Church,</hi> to their <hi>Eſtabliſht Religion,</hi> to their <hi>Liberties,</hi> to their <hi>Proteſtant Succeſſion,</hi> and to the <hi>Revolution;</hi> How, whatever the ſpecious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of Preſerving the <hi>Eſtabliſht Church</hi> might be, <hi>Popery</hi> in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and <hi>Tyranny</hi> in Practice were certainly Incompatible with the <hi>Proteſtant Eſtabliſhment</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which was Founded in <hi>Liberty,</hi> Depended upon <hi>Law,</hi> and could not Subſist, humanely ſpeaking, but upon the ſupported Baſis of <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> together; That the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion</hi> was a Viſible Appearance of <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Popiſh Tyranny,</hi> the ſame that for <hi>twenty eight</hi> Years, bad Influenced the <hi>Councils</hi> and <hi>Governments</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> while they Trampled on the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> Silenc'd their preaching <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> Perſecuted and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly Murthered their <hi>Innocent Brethren,</hi> and bid Defiance to the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>GOD,</hi> and the <hi>Liberties</hi> of <hi>Scotland;</hi> that theſe <hi>Days</hi> would inevitably return upon them, and that all the <hi>Miſeries</hi> they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly felt, were Effectually contain'd in the Womb of an <hi>Invaſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this Method the <hi>Miniſters</hi> opened-the <hi>Eyes</hi> of the whole <hi>Nation,</hi> and the <hi>People,</hi> Rous'd by this happy Vigour in their <hi>Clergy,</hi> began to Hir every where; Immediately a new Face appear'd upon the <hi>Publick Affairs,</hi> the General Dejection and Heſitation, which ſeemed before to make the <hi>People</hi> look Dark and Unreſolved, was quite Removed, and nothing was to be ſeen among the <hi>Preſbyterian Party</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi>—but <hi>Aſſociations, Addreſſes, Preparations</hi> for Fighting, fitting up their <hi>Arms,</hi> and a Chearful reſolved <hi>Temper</hi> of <hi>Fighting</hi> the <hi>French</hi> where-ever they were to be found.</p>
            <p>Some of the <hi>Miniſters</hi> themſelves were ſo Vigorous in this, that they Cauſed their whole <hi>Pariſhes</hi> to Aſſociate and Bind themſelves, One to another, and all together to the <hi>Government,</hi> to ſtand as one Man against the <hi>Invaders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Service this did the <hi>Government,</hi> the Encouragement it gave
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:0554400100:16"/>
in <hi>England,</hi> and the Diſcouragement it gave to the <hi>Jacobite Party</hi> at that Juncture, was ſuch, as the last eſpecially will not eaſily forget;—and I thought it very Uſeful to Tranſmit the <hi>Memory</hi> of it thus to <hi>Poſterity,</hi> that they may know how their <hi>Anceſtors</hi> Acted in this <hi>Great Affair;</hi> and how they ought to Act on the like Occaſions.</p>
            <p>In this Poſture the Affairs of this <hi>Iſland</hi> ſtood, when the <hi>French baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled by the immediate Hand of GOD's Providence, in miſſing their Port,</hi> were purſued by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet, and made their Eſcape <hi>by the Goodneſs of their Sails</hi> to <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> where their <hi>Troops</hi> were put on Shore, <hi>and ſo the Expedition ended.</hi>

            <p>The ten <hi>Battalions</hi> which came from <hi>Holland</hi> to <hi>New-Caſtle</hi> were not at all landed, but went immediately back, and were in the Field again Time enough to ſhow themſelves in the <hi>Firſt of the Campaign</hi>—The <hi>Engliſh Troops</hi> march'd back without entring into <hi>Scotland;</hi> The Priſoners taken on Board the <hi>Salisbury</hi> were brought to <hi>Hull,</hi> and treated as <hi>Priſoners of War,</hi> in Order to be ſent over to <hi>Holland</hi> for Exchange.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Griffin,</hi> with the two Sons of the Earl of <hi>Middletoun,</hi> and 15<hi> Iriſh reform'd Officers</hi> were carry'd to <hi>London;</hi> The three firſt were committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> to <hi>Newgate,</hi> being to be Tryed, <hi>as Traitors,</hi> againſt the <hi>QUEEN,</hi> whoſe natural born Subjects they appeared to be.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Griffin</hi> having been formerly attainted and outlaw'd, it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not that he ſhould be brought to any Tryal: but, <hi>being carryed up to the QUEEN's Bench Bar</hi> he received <hi>Sentence of Death</hi> on the Foot of the ſaid Outlawry, <hi>without any Tryal;</hi>—However, the <hi>Dauphin of France</hi> having wrot a particular Letter in his Behalf, <hi>to the Duke of Marlborcugh</hi> to intreat the <hi>QUEEN's Mercy to him,</hi> and that he <hi>(the Dauphin)</hi> made it his Request to the <hi>Queen, the Lord</hi> Griffin <hi>being his Servant;</hi>—The ſaid Lord <hi>Griffin</hi> was reprived from Time to Time, and is yet living <hi>in the Tower,</hi> at the publiſhing theſe Sheets.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iriſh Officers</hi> alſo, and the Lord <hi>Middletoun's</hi> Sons remain yet <hi>Priſoners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other Hand, Great Heats and Diſputes happened about the Gentlemen who were taken up upon Suſpition.—</p>
            <p>The Parliament, <hi>in the Heat of the Alarm,</hi> had paſſed a Bill ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the <hi>Habeas Corpus Act</hi> for a Time, ſo far as ſhould concern the Perſons apprehended on this Account, and empowering the <hi>Queen</hi> to take up, and keep in Priſon, ſuch Perſons as there ſhould be Ground to ſuſpect, were guilty of Confederating with, or Encouraging the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had the Gentlemen concerned, been apprehended in anyother Juncture, they would perhaps have had no other Trouble than to have lyen ſtill, and when the Thing had been over, have been releaſed again, as was done at that Time in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Fury of our Diviſions on either Hand run ſo high, that this could not be: Some thought the Perſons taken up had more Hand in the <hi>Invaſion</hi> than appeared, and that they ought not too lightly to be let go,
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:0554400100:17"/>
left it might encourage both them and others to make the like Attempt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>And theſe were very warm for Proſecutions, and for propoſing Rewards to encourage Perſons to come in to charge the <hi>Priſoners:</hi>—And would have all Manner of Methods tryed to faſten ſomething upon them.</p>
            <p>Others again <hi>Inveighed againſt the Miniſtry</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as having partial and Party-Regards in the picking out <hi>ſuch or ſuch Perſons</hi> to put in Priſon, <hi>on Pretence of this Suſpicion,</hi> as might gratifie the private Deſigns of particular Perſons, either as to <hi>Private Picks</hi> and <hi>Perſonal Revenge,</hi> or to prejudice their Interests in Elections, <hi>there being a new Parliament then to be choſen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Contentions, <hi>however grounded on either Side,</hi> had certainly this Effect, that they gave a great deal of Trouble to the <hi>Priſoners,</hi> which otherwiſe might have been avoided; For the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> ſeeing ſuch pointing at probable Guilt on one Hand, and ſuch Complaints of Injustice on the other, found it neceſſary to make the <hi>Proceedings more formal,</hi> and to have all the Gentlemen up to <hi>London,</hi>—That they might either be proſecuted, or let out upon <hi>Bail: as the Council ſhould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon their coming up to <hi>London,</hi> they were all admitted to Bail, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>Four</hi> who were committed to Priſon, and were after ſent to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to be Tryed; but theſe however were acquitted, <hi>the Lords of the Juſticiary</hi> and <hi>Her Majeſties Advocate</hi> differing upon ſome Forms; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, the Lords refuſing to admit the <hi>Lord Advocate</hi> to produce more Witneſſes—after the first Day of <hi>Tryal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not my Buſineſs to enter into this Diſpute, <hi>otherwiſe I could be more large on this Head:</hi>—But the <hi>Government was ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible</hi> of the Inconveniencies of the old Method of proſecuting upon <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, from this Nicety,</hi> that preſently upon this the <hi>Parliament</hi> reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to bring in a Bill to make the Laws for <hi>Tryals, in Caſes of Treaſon,</hi> the ſame in <hi>Scotland</hi> as in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this Period is alſo to be dated the Diſtractions which followed in the Affair of Religion, <hi>and of which I think it is very material to ſpeak,</hi> becauſe they have made a great Noiſe in the World, <hi>and every one is not rightly appriſed of the Thing</hi>—particularly many have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Prejudices againſt the good People in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as if they had been acted by a <hi>Spirit of Paſſion and Perſecution,</hi> when indeed, upon a full and clear Examination of the Matter of Fact, the contrary will evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear; And therefore I could not ſatisfie my ſelf without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Piece of Juſtice to the Church and People of <hi>Scotland,</hi>—as to give an impartial Relation of the Fact, as it is atteſted out of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Regiſters, by the proper Officers: and being myſelf an Eye and Ear-Witneſs to every part of the <hi>Proceeding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About the End of <hi>February</hi> 1707/8, Her Majeſty by Her Letter to the Privy Council in <hi>Scotland,</hi> gave Notice of the intended In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion, back'd with a <hi>French</hi> Power, deſign'd againſt <hi>Scotland;</hi> recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending to them the Security of the Kingdom, the Preſervation of the Publick Peace, and that they would uſe all poſſible Means to that Effect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:0554400100:18"/>
The Privy Council taking this Affair into their Conſideration, it natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally occur'd; That to diſcourage the Enemies of the Government at Home, was <hi>among others,</hi> one of the beſt Steps to prevent the miſchiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conſequences of an <hi>Invaſion</hi> from Abroad; and in order to this, that it was reaſonable to ſuppreſs the publick Meetings of thoſe, who under pretence of Divine Worſhip, admitted ſuch Ministers to officiate, as the Law in that Caſe had prohibited, having not qualifyed themſelves by tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Oaths, praying for the Q<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>EEN, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by which the Publick Diſaffection was upheld and encourag'd.</p>
            <p>It was then agreed to <hi>Nemine Contradicente,</hi> in the Privy-Council; <hi>and for the Truth of which we refer our Reader to the Minutes of the Council for Proof;</hi> That Orders ſhould be Iſſued out to all inferiour Magiſtrates, to put this Reſolve in Execution; and Orders were accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly Iſſued out to the Magistrates of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> for that Purpoſe, who thereupon Legally called before them ſeveral Ministers or Preachers, who were known to keep Publick Meeting-Houſes within their Bounds—Asking them plainly in Terms of Law, If they prayed for Her Majeſty <hi>NOMINATIM,</hi> in their Publick Meeting-Houſes; and if they had qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifyed themſelves by taking the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> and ſubſcribing the ſame with the <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> as the Law requir'd?</p>
            <p>Some of them anſwer'd directly, but others avoiding the Queſtion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd a Legal Tryal, by way of Libel and Proof; which was accordingly Appointed, and whereof the preciſe Points were, their not taking the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> and ſubſcribing the ſame with the <hi>Aſſurance;</hi> their not praying for Her Hajeſty <hi>NOMINATIM,</hi> as the Law requires; and their not obſerving <hi>Publick Faſts</hi> and <hi>Thankſgivings;</hi> all which were Notour, and being <hi>Negatives</hi> proved themſelves.</p>
            <p>To this Libel the foreſaid Preachers made Anſwers, and alſo took a Protest, That they were not legally cited, not being call'd either on fifteen Days as the old Law requires, or on ten Days, as the late Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt <hi>Intruders</hi> preſcribes.</p>
            <p>To which it was Anſwered, That as to the fifteen Days, the known and perpetual Custom within Burgh had over-ruled it to <hi>twenty four</hi> Hours; and as to the ten Days, they were only appointed in the Tryal of <hi>Intruders.</hi> But the Preachers call'd, being conveen'd for notour Diſaffection by not Praying, and by not taking the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> nor keeping <hi>Faſts</hi> and <hi>Thankſgivings,</hi> the <hi>Citations</hi> were good, and the <hi>Procedure</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable; and yet the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> thought fit to give them a farther <hi>Indulgence,</hi> and to allow them to give in all their <hi>Defences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Sum of which <hi>Defences,</hi> as contain'd in a <hi>Repreſentation</hi> exhibit by the ſaid <hi>Preachers,</hi> being first the foreſaid <hi>Dilators</hi> to this, they added, That by the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> 1693, Requiring all <hi>Miniſters</hi> and <hi>Preachers</hi> to take the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> It is provided, that the <hi>Contraveener</hi> ſhall be Puniſh'd by Baniſhment, or otherways as the <hi>Privy-Council</hi> ſhould think fit, and therefore the <hi>Libel</hi> was improperly tabled before the <hi>Magiſtrates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was Anſwer'd, To the <hi>firſt Dilators,</hi> that the former <hi>Anſwers</hi> were repeated; And to the <hi>ſecond,</hi> That the <hi>Privy-Council</hi> having
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:0554400100:19"/>
refer'd the Execution to the <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> there could be no more <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate</hi> about their <hi>Competency</hi> on that <hi>Head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then they went on to Object againſt the Relevancy. And as to the <hi>Act</hi> of the <hi>Convenion,</hi> Ordaining all <hi>Miniſters</hi> to Pray for the KING and QUEEN <hi>Nominatim,</hi> They Anſwer'd, That that <hi>Act</hi> did die and expire with King <hi>WILLIAM</hi> and Queen <hi>MARY.</hi> And as to the <hi>Act</hi> 1693, Ordaining all <hi>Preachers</hi> to take the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> and Sign the ſame with the <hi>Aſſurance;</hi> They Anſwer'd, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That that <hi>Act</hi> did only concern <hi>Miniſters</hi> provided to Benefices and Stipends; and could not be extended to ſuch <hi>Preachers,</hi> as enjoy no Benefice under the <hi>Government;</hi> And <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Act</hi> Recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing Her Majeſty Queen <hi>ANNE,</hi> enjoyns the Taking of the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> &amp;c. to ſuch as are in publick Truſt, and <hi>Preachers</hi> not benefic'd cannot be ſaid to be in any publick Trust; And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> 1693, limited to the Perſons of King <hi>WILLI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>AM</hi> and Queen <hi>MARY,</hi> is out of Doors with them.</p>
            <p>To which it was Reply'd, That the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Convention,</hi> Ordaining all <hi>Miniſters</hi> and <hi>Preachers</hi> to Pray for the KING and QUEEN <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatim,</hi> is certainly to be understood likeways, of all their Royal Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, ſpecially ſince it is ſo plainly founded upon the Command of the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> and the Duties of all <hi>Subjects. Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Act</hi> 1693, expreſly relates to all <hi>Preachers,</hi> whether Benefic'd or not, and withal defines all <hi>Preachers</hi> to be Perſons in publick Truſt; ſo that the <hi>Act</hi> recognizing Her Majesty did exactly fall within it, and affords no Relief to the <hi>Defenders.</hi> And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Act</hi> 1693, tho' it men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion King <hi>WILLIAM</hi> and Queen <hi>MARY,</hi> yet is not limited to them, but being a perpetual Law, extends to all their Royal <hi>Succeſſors;</hi> Likeas by the ſaid <hi>Act</hi> recognizing Her Majeſty, it is <hi>de facto</hi> ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
            <p>Which <hi>Defences</hi> and <hi>Replies</hi> being Read and Conſidered by the <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> they repell'd the <hi>Dilators,</hi> as alſo all the other <hi>Defences</hi> proponed for the <hi>Defenders,</hi> and found, that ſince they had not Pray'd for Her Majesty Queen <hi>ANNE, Nominatim,</hi> and taken the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance, &amp;c.</hi> they had incur'd the Pains of Law, and therefore Ordain'd them, and every one of them, to deſist from keeping of any Meeting-Houſes within the City of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and Liberties thereof, and from Preaching or Exerciſing any Part of the <hi>Miniſterial Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> within the ſame in Time coming, under the Pain of Impriſonment, and to find Caution for that Effect betwixt and the 30<hi>th</hi> Day of <hi>March</hi> then inſtant, and in the mean Time that their <hi>Meeting-Houſes,</hi> be forthwith ſhut up. But tho' this <hi>Sentence</hi> was then paſt, yet nothing follow'd upon it, until that the <hi>Privy-Council</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd by an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> after the 1st of <hi>May,</hi> theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected <hi>People</hi> judging, that the <hi>Councils</hi> Orders were alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pir'd with the <hi>Council</hi> that gave them, did about the 20<hi>th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> fall again to their <hi>Preaching,</hi> and enter'd their <hi>Meeting-Houſes.</hi> And further they reſolv'd among themſelves, that they would continue to Preach and not Deſist; which mov'd the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> to renew the former <hi>Prohibition</hi> about the ſaid 20<hi>th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> last, which they ſtill
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:0554400100:20"/>
Neglecting and Deſpiſing, they were again call'd before the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> about the 16<hi>th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> and requir'd to find <hi>Caution</hi> or <hi>Bail</hi> to <hi>Deſiſt,</hi> as being the known legal Execution upon ſuch prohibitory Sentences, or otherways to go to <hi>Priſon.</hi> But they still refuſing to obey, the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> thought fit on the 13<hi>th</hi> to ſend Five only to <hi>Priſon,</hi> which Five were alſo at length reliev'd; ſo indulgent were the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> in this Matter.</p>
            <p>This whole <hi>Trial,</hi> and all the Steps thereof, being tranſmitted to <hi>Her Majeſty,</hi> it pleaſed <hi>Her Majeſty</hi> by Her Royal Letters under Her Hand and Seal of the 18<hi>th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> laſt, to approve what was done by the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in the ſaid Matter, as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable Service; and further to judge it neceſſary for the Safety of Her <hi>Royal Perſon</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> that all ſuch <hi>Meeting-Houſes</hi> in every other Place ſhould be ſhut up.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus far the Matter of Fact.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is most true, that in this first <hi>Proſecution,</hi> there was no other or further <hi>Deſign,</hi> than the giving a <hi>Check</hi> to the <hi>Invaſion,</hi> and to the <hi>Inſolence</hi> of ſome of the <hi>non jurant Party,</hi> who at that Time began to be more formidable in <hi>Scotland</hi> than in <hi>England;</hi> and this is apparent in the Lenity and Forbearance of the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> and <hi>Juſtices</hi> of the <hi>Peace</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who as ſoon as the <hi>Invaſion</hi> was over, and the <hi>Danger</hi> from abroad ſeem'd at an <hi>End,</hi> were very eaſy with them again, the <hi>Miniſters</hi> who had been Confined were ſilently let go, and their former <hi>Liberty</hi> conniv'd at again; ſo that their <hi>Meetings</hi> became as frequent as they were before, notwithstanding they still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to take the <hi>Oaths,</hi> or Pray for the <hi>QUEEN.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here it began to appear, that there were ſome among thoſe <hi>People,</hi> who had other <hi>Aims</hi> in theſe things, than meerly the <hi>Liberty</hi> of their <hi>Conſciences,</hi> and the <hi>Worſhiping GOD</hi>—; and that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ought to be attempted to make the <hi>People Uneaſy,</hi> and to bring them by <hi>Force</hi> to Proſecute and Attack them.</p>
            <p>And to this End, ſince refuſing the <hi>Oaths,</hi> ſince refuſing to Pray for the <hi>QUEEN,</hi> nay actually praying for the <hi>PRETENDER,</hi> would not provoke the <hi>Government,</hi> and <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>Perſecute</hi>—; They find out another <hi>Expedient,</hi> which they are aſſured will not fail, being what they know the <hi>Scots</hi> will not bear, what ever it Coſt them; and this was Erecting the <hi>Common Prayer</hi> or <hi>Engliſh Liturgy</hi> in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>People</hi> that made this <hi>Attempt,</hi> behoved to get ſome Body to do it; that however <hi>Jacobite</hi> he might be in <hi>Principle,</hi> was yet La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudinarian enough in <hi>Conſcience,</hi> that he could ſwallow all the <hi>Oaths</hi> which ſhould be offered to him—; Indeed ſome of the <hi>Jacobite Clergy</hi> were ſo honeſt, that as they would not take the <hi>Oaths,</hi> ſo they did not approve of this <hi>Attempt,</hi> but openly Diſavowed it—; Nor had the <hi>Epiſcopal People</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> ever ſet up the <hi>Engliſh Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy,</hi> altho they had Reign'd in <hi>Scotland</hi> for <hi>twenty eight</hi> Years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, before the <hi>Revolution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Deſign being concerted, they found a Tool; a <hi>poor Curate</hi> of 15 <hi>lib.</hi> a Year in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but born in <hi>Scotland,</hi> comes over to 
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:0554400100:21"/>
               <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to mend his <hi>Commons;</hi> and having taken the <hi>Oaths,</hi> he falls in with this <hi>Party,</hi> who finding him a Perſon of proſtituted <hi>Morals,</hi> a large Stock in the Face, and ready, if well paid, to do their Work, they promiſe him <hi>Fourſcore Pound</hi> a Year, and accordingly begin a <hi>Subſcription</hi> for it.</p>
            <p>Some <hi>Engliſh Gentlemen</hi> had, it ſeems, promiſed him ſome <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement</hi> towards that <hi>Sum</hi> to be raiſed—, and this they make a Handle of preſently, and Reported that this was ſet up to Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate the <hi>Engliſh Strangers</hi> who could not Conform to the <hi>Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Engliſh Gentlemen</hi> ſeeing into the Deſign, and that they were to be made a Property to Embroil the <hi>Government,</hi> and foment a <hi>Diviſion</hi> between the Two lately <hi>United Nations;</hi> They ſoon aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned him and his <hi>Deſign</hi>—; However, he reſolved to put his <hi>Project</hi> in Execution, and accordingly takes a <hi>Houſe</hi> juſt at the <hi>Croſs</hi> in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> fits it put for a <hi>Chapel,</hi> and begins to Read the <hi>Engliſh Service.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>People,</hi> as every Body knew they would, immediately took Fire at the thing—; But not doing him the Honour to Rabble him, <hi>which ſeem'd to be what his Party expected;</hi> they Complain to the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates</hi>—; The Perſon that had let him the <hi>Houſe,</hi> finding what Uſe he was putting it to, began with him, and <hi>on Pretence of his having made ſome Spoil in pulling down Partitions,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>not Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized by his Contract</hi>—, Gets him Turn'd out of the <hi>Houſe,</hi> and ſo he betakes himſelf to a Place leſs publick, but ſtill goes on with his <hi>Service-Book Worſhip;</hi> However it gave leſs Offence here, the other ſeeming to be a Defyance of the <hi>Laws;</hi> It happened at this Time, or in a few Days after, that the <hi>Commiſſion</hi> of the <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> was to meet—, as ſoon as they ſat down, a <hi>Repreſentation</hi> or <hi>Addreſs</hi> is made to them by the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> and other Places againſt this thing; The <hi>Paper</hi> mentions other <hi>Complaints</hi> indeed, but this was the Main Thing aim'd at—; The <hi>Addreſs</hi> is as follows.</p>

            <p>I ſhall only give a Summary of their <hi>Proceedings</hi> againſt him, for it is not their Form of <hi>Proceeding,</hi> but the Nature of the Thing that ſeems to call for this prefatory <hi>Narration.</hi> It is to be Obſerved, that the <hi>Preſbytery</hi> did not Proceed againſt him upon the Subject of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation,</hi> or his having ſet up the <hi>Common-Prayer</hi>—at all, nor was it once Mentioned to him, or in the <hi>Sentence</hi> of the <hi>Preſbytery</hi>—; But they firſt Demanded <hi>Who he was, whence he Came,</hi> and what <hi>Authority</hi> he had to Execute the <hi>Office</hi> of a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> and not being able to produce any <hi>Legal Ordination,</hi> or <hi>Miniſterial Induction,</hi> except from the <hi>Exauctorate Depoſed Biſhops,</hi> to whom neither by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland's Conſtitution,</hi> or by the <hi>Epiſcopal Church</hi> of <hi>England's Conſtitution,</hi> any ſuch <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Office</hi> remained—; they Proceeded to their <hi>Sentence</hi> againſt him, Declaring him <hi>Uncapable</hi> to Exerciſe any Part of the <hi>Miniſterial Function</hi> in their <hi>Bounds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He Declined their <hi>Authority,</hi> Treated them with <hi>Contempt,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to <hi>Appear</hi> at their <hi>Subſequent Citation</hi>—, they took no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Notice of him, but ſent a <hi>Copy</hi> of their <hi>Sentence</hi> to the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi>
               <pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:0554400100:24"/> of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> in order to the <hi>Civil Power</hi> putting it in Execution.</p>
            <p>In Purſuance of this <hi>Sentence,</hi> the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> ſend for him, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him <hi>Intimation</hi> of the <hi>Sentence</hi> of the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> they give <hi>Notice</hi> that he do not preſume to Preach any more within the Bounds of the <hi>City,</hi> on Pain of <hi>Impriſonment,</hi> &amp; gave him time to ſhow his <hi>Obedience</hi> to their <hi>Order:</hi> He carries himſelf with the ſame <hi>Haughtineſs</hi> to the <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> tells them poſitively, That he would not obey them, and accordingly the next <hi>Sabbath</hi> he Preaches openly in the <hi>City;</hi> nor yet would the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates</hi> have <hi>Committed</hi> him, had he not inſolently triumphed in his <hi>Contempt</hi> of their <hi>Authority,</hi> appeared openly at the <hi>Croſs,</hi> to let them ſee that <hi>Contempt,</hi> and by all the Methods poſſible to him, inſulted them in the Affair of their <hi>Sentence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This brought the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> to an abſolute Neceſſity to <hi>Commit</hi> him, in Vindication of their <hi>Authority,</hi> and that they might not give their own <hi>Conſent</hi> to be Trampled on by the whole Party; accordingly they ſent for him again, and ſtill offering him his <hi>Liberty,</hi> upon <hi>Obedience</hi> to their former <hi>Order,</hi> and the <hi>Sentence</hi> of the <hi>Presbytery</hi> which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultingly refuſed, they <hi>committed</hi> him to the <hi>Tolbooth</hi> of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>

            <p>It were very little worth while, to fill this <hi>Preface</hi> with the Story of this Perſon, were it not the Occaſion of bringing upon the <hi>Stage Debates</hi> of ſeveral kinds, which it ſeems neceſſary to ſet in a clear Light to the World; in the Miſrepreſenting which, the <hi>Church</hi> as well as <hi>People</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> really receive much Wrong, to whom, I think, it is the Duty of an honeſt <hi>Man,</hi> as well as of a faithful <hi>Hiſtorian,</hi> to do Juſtice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Caſes are ſuch as theſe,</hi> 
               <list>
                  <item>Whether the <hi>Scots</hi> in theſe <hi>Proſecutions</hi> are not <hi>Perſecutors</hi> for <hi>Conſcience?</hi>

                  </item>
                  <item>Whether the <hi>Epiſcopal Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the eſtabliſh't <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> are at all of Kin, or no?</item>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall ſay ſomething to all theſe, ſo far as Matter of <hi>Fact</hi> and a Hiſtorical <hi>Narration</hi> requires, and ſomething by <hi>Obſervation,</hi> as far as the <hi>Civil Rights</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> are concerned, and thus far I think they are proper to be ſpoken to by Way of <hi>Preface:</hi> As to the <hi>Theological</hi> part of the <hi>Diſpute,</hi> I ſhall have occaſion to handle it elſewhere, neither can it be reaſonable to expect it here.</p>
            <p>In taking Notice of the firſt of theſe <hi>Queries,</hi> Whether the <hi>Scots</hi> in theſe <hi>Proſecutions</hi> are not <hi>Perſecutors</hi> for <hi>Conſcience?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be alledged, That all <hi>Proſecutions</hi> of <hi>Law,</hi> where the <hi>Offender</hi> pleads <hi>Conſcience</hi> againſt his <hi>Obedience,</hi> are <hi>Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions</hi> for <hi>Conſcience</hi>—; And if this be brought by Way of <hi>Argument</hi> in this Caſe, then my <hi>Anſwer</hi> is very brief; The <hi>Scots,</hi> and with them all the <hi>Chriſtian Nations</hi> in the World; 
<pb n="xxiv" facs="tcp:0554400100:25"/>
but eſpecially the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> are <hi>Perſecutors, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Question ought to be ſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if you will reſtrict the Term <hi>Perſecution,</hi> to the generally received <hi>Senſe</hi> of it, <hi>viz.</hi> Diſturbing, Proſecuting, and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing the peaceable <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of <hi>Religious orſhip,</hi> perform'd meerly in Obedience to the <hi>Dictates</hi> and <hi>Commands</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi>—: Then I may ſafely challenge all the World in Behalf of the People of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to ſhew the leaſt Veſtige or Appearance of <hi>Perſecution</hi> among them.</p>
            <p>I think, while I am in this <hi>Argument,</hi> Addreſſing my ſelf prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to the People of <hi>England,</hi> and among them to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi>—, I can do nothing better, than bring their own Practice to a Parallel with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as a strong and convincing Way of arguing, <hi>to them eſpecially,</hi> in the Caſe I am upon; <hi>And Firſt,</hi> I take the Authority of the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>England</hi> againſt <hi>Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,</hi> in the great <hi>Act</hi> for Settlement of the <hi>Toleration,</hi> where it is ſaid, <hi>Whereas it is reaſonable, that all juſt Tenderneſs ſhould be ſhown to Tender</hi> Conſciences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then in the <hi>Preamble</hi> of the late famous <hi>Occaſional Bill,</hi> are theſe words, <q rend="inline">"<hi>Whereas</hi> Perſecution <hi>for</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience <hi>ſake, is contrary to the Principles of the</hi> Christian Religion, <hi>and the</hi> Doctrine <hi>of the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> England.</q>Take theſe two, and compare them with the <hi>Act 1. WILLIAM</hi> and <hi>MARY Cap.</hi>—. <hi>By</hi> which all thoſe <hi>Eccleſiaſticks</hi> who would not take the Oaths, are Depoſed and Deprived <hi>ab Officio &amp; Beneficio;</hi> and it will neceſſarily follow, at leaſt in my Opinion, that either the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> in Depoſing the <hi>Non Jurant Clergy</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> acts <hi>contrary to her own</hi> Doctrine <hi>and the Principles of the</hi> Chriſtian Religion, <hi>ut ſupra: OR,</hi> That Depoſing and Depriving the <hi>Non Jurant Biſhops,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Is not</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution <hi>for</hi> Conſcience.</p>
            <p>I humbly refer this to the <hi>Determination</hi> of all that ſhall Read im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially if it be not clear and fairly ſtated.</p>
            <p>If then Depoſing and Depriving the <hi>Clergy</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> who refufe to take the <hi>Oaths</hi> to the <hi>Government,</hi> be not <hi>Perſecution;</hi> it remains for the other Party to prove, that the ſame thing in <hi>Scotland</hi> can be called <hi>Perſecution,</hi> and in <hi>England</hi> no <hi>Perſecution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Depoſing <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> it ſelf in <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſeems to come in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion here, and would require a long Diſcourſe—; But as I am ſpeaking chiefly to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> in this Caſe, I am very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to make her a Judge—, and I preſume it will be arguing <hi>ad ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem,</hi> to ſay, tho' I do not lay the Streſs here neither.</p>
            <p>That Depoſing <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and Depoſing <hi>Popery</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> stand in many Caſes upon the ſame Foot—, and the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> has offered little or no <hi>Violence</hi> to the <hi>Epiſcopal Church</hi> in <hi>Scotland;</hi> But what the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> has offered to the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> in <hi>England</hi>—: Now tho' in General this would be no Argument, yet 'tis a Reaſon in this Caſe, why the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> above all other, ought not to charge the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> with <hi>Perſecution</hi> in that particular—. But to go further, the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> did not immediately pull down <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi>—,
<pb n="xxv" facs="tcp:0554400100:26"/> I mean, the <hi>Church</hi> abſtractly conſidered in her <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances—; But it was done by the <hi>Government</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Body of the People, I mean the <hi>Parliament</hi> before the <hi>Presbyterian Church</hi> was Establiſhed—. And it is evident <hi>by the Claim of Right,</hi> that <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy</hi> was turn'd out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> not as a thing Eſtabliſht, but as an <hi>Intrud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> upon the Eſtabliſhed <hi>Religion,</hi> which <hi>Scotland</hi> had from the very <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi> Embrac't, which they had Sworn in their <hi>National Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> to maintain, and which by <hi>Law</hi> it was their Right to restore; in ſhort <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> was turn'd out as a Man who has had his Estate ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from him by <hi>Oppreſſion,</hi> recovers his <hi>Right</hi> by <hi>Law,</hi> and then Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſes the wrongful <hi>Incroacher</hi> or <hi>Invader,</hi> and enters upon his own.</p>
            <p>
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal <hi>Hiſtory</hi> will allow, That the <hi>Scots</hi> Reform'd first into the <hi>Geneva</hi> Model, by the Agency of the famous <hi>John Knox</hi> and others, and that they had no <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> in their firſt <hi>Eſtabliſhment</hi> at all; nor can all the Labour that has been ſpent to make the <hi>Superintendents,</hi> who were ſent into the ſeveral Parts of the Kingdom, to ſettle <hi>Eccleſiaſtick</hi> Affairs, <hi>look like Biſhops</hi>—, for this will for ever ſupercede that Suggeſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> That theſe <hi>Superintendents,</hi> tho' Veſted with <hi>Power</hi> over the <hi>Miniſters</hi> they went to Viſit—, yet received that <hi>Power</hi> from, and exerciſed it in Subordination to the <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> of the <hi>Presbyterian Church</hi>—, and were often called to an Account, Cenſured, and Removed by the <hi>Synods,</hi> nay and ſome ſay, even by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate <hi>Presbyteries,</hi> See <hi>Calderwood's Hiſtory of the Church of</hi> Scotland <hi>Fol.</hi>

               <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> being thus ſuppoſed an <hi>Invader</hi> and <hi>Spoiler,</hi> the <hi>Revolution</hi> did no more than take from them their uſurped <hi>Authority,</hi> cauſe them to Diſgorge what they had moſt unjustly devoured, and the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vader</hi> having thus been turned out, the right <hi>Owners</hi> of the <hi>Houſe</hi> came again, and took Poſſeſſion of their own; <hi>And this can by no means be called</hi> Perſecution.</p>
            <p>My ſecond <hi>Enquiry</hi> is upon <hi>a new Diſpute,</hi> and I think admits of no Difficulties in Matters of <hi>Law,</hi> whatever it may in Matters of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi>—viz. <hi>Whether the Depoſed Exauctorate</hi> Biſhops <hi>have</hi> Power <hi>left to Ordain</hi> Miniſters—? Indeed the Queſtion ſeems rather to ly here, Whether ſuch <hi>Preachers</hi> as ſhall be Licenſed or Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Exauctorate <hi>Biſhops,</hi> ought to be eſteem'd as <hi>Miniſters,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in that <hi>Church</hi> which has ſo Depoſed them—? This being the preſent Debate, it rather reſpects the <hi>Civil</hi> than <hi>Eccleſiaſtick</hi> Part of the Queſtion.</p>
            <p>It ſeems to me highly abſurd, that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> ſhould receive as a <hi>Miniſter</hi> among them, a Man Ordain'd <hi>BY HIM WHOM</hi> they will not owne or receive as a <hi>Miniſter</hi> of their <hi>Church;</hi> for if the <hi>Biſhop</hi> after Deprivation ſhall Ordain <hi>Miniſters,</hi> how then is that <hi>Biſhop</hi> Deprived <hi>AB OFFICIO</hi>—? Nor indeed do I know that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> has at all admitted this Abſurdity among them—; The thing is only ſtarted in <hi>Scotland</hi> to beget new Broils on that Head, and it ſeems ſtill more abſurd, that the <hi>Non Jurant Biſhops</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould have <hi>Power</hi> to Ordain a <hi>Miniſter</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to ſupport this Abſurdity, a worſe is ſtarted among us, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Epiſcopal Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> is Incorporated into the <hi>Church</hi> of 
<pb n="xxvi" facs="tcp:0554400100:27"/>
               <hi>England</hi> by the <hi>UNION,</hi> and this is the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of my Third <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry.</hi> 
               <list>
                  <item>3. <hi>Whether the</hi> Epiſcopal Church <hi>of</hi> Scotland, <hi>and the preſent</hi> Establiſht Church <hi>of</hi> England, <hi>are at all of</hi> Kin, <hi>or no?</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Enquiry,</hi> if it be directly Trac'd, will lead to a New <hi>Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, viz.</hi> What is to be Meant by the <hi>Church of</hi> England? <hi>I mean in this Queſtion onely</hi>—, and therefore I ſhall <hi>Anſwer</hi> it both Ways very briefly.</p>
            <p>If by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> we mean, The <hi>Church</hi> as now Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd, or rather Recognized by the <hi>Revolution</hi>—, and now <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd</hi> and <hi>Acknowledged</hi> by the <hi>QUEEN</hi> and <hi>Parliament;</hi> Then indeed this pretended <hi>Incorporation,</hi> is an <hi>Abſurdity</hi>—, and there is no more any ſuch thing, than there is an <hi>Incorporation</hi> between <hi>GOD</hi> and <hi>Baal;</hi> for the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> ſo <hi>Underſtood</hi> has ſpued the other out as <hi>Illegal,</hi> has Rejected Her as <hi>Jacobite,</hi> and has Joyn'd in and Conſented to <hi>by the UNION,</hi> the <hi>Eſtabliſhment</hi> of the <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Church</hi> in her Stead, and upon her Ruines, as the <hi>True Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion,</hi> and <hi>Eſtabliſht National Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland, vide</hi> the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>UNION,</hi> and from this Stipulation, ſhe (the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi>) her ſelf, can not go back—; But if on the other Hand, by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> is to be underſtood the <hi>Dodwellian-Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite-Faction</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> who refuſe to own either the <hi>Religous</hi> or <hi>Civil Eſtabliſhment</hi> now Reigning in <hi>Britain,</hi> eſteeming the QUEEN an <hi>Uſurper,</hi> the <hi>Revolution</hi> a <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England Schiſmatical</hi>—, if <hi>thus they Underſtand</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> then they and the <hi>Epiſcopal Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> may for ought I know, be <hi>Incorporated</hi> into each other, and may be esteemed <hi>One Body</hi>—; and <hi>they are welcome to be ſo accounted:</hi> But how this is done by the <hi>Union,</hi> remains for thoſe <hi>Gentlemen</hi> who pretend to it to make <hi>Out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I think, I need not Deſcend to many <hi>Arguments</hi> in this <hi>Caſe,</hi> the <hi>Caſe</hi> is evident, the <hi>Epiſcopal Church</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> being entirely <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobite</hi> at this Time, can not be ſaid to <hi>Incorporate</hi> with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> who Acknowledge <hi>Queen ANNE,</hi> becauſe they <hi>Reject</hi> Her as <hi>Schiſmatical</hi> and <hi>Apoſtate</hi>—, and that they can <hi>Reject</hi> Her, and be <hi>Incorporated</hi> into Her at the ſame Time, ſeems <hi>Impracticable</hi> and <hi>Abſurd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It remains to Enquire, <hi>whether</hi> Epiſcopacy <hi>and the</hi> Engliſh Liturgy <hi>may not be Tolerated in</hi> Scotland—; and here I ſhall wave the various <hi>Arguments</hi> about the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> and <hi>Obligation</hi> which lyes on all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to pay <hi>Reverence</hi> to <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and in Order to give all poſſible <hi>Liberty</hi> to <hi>Religious Opinions</hi>—; but I ſhall lay the <hi>Streſs</hi> of my preſent <hi>Arguing</hi> another way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Speaking of <hi>Scotland,</hi> we are to Distinguiſh between Tolerat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> and Tolerating of <hi>Jacobitiſm</hi>—, and if this be Distinguiſht right here, we ſhall have little need of the <hi>Queſtion</hi> at all—; And in the Name of the <hi>Scots,</hi> I may very well ſay to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi>—, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> when you pleaſe to Tolerate <hi>Jacobitiſm</hi> by <hi>Law</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> we will Conſider of Tolerating <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcpacy</hi>
               <pb n="xxvii" facs="tcp:0554400100:28"/> in <hi>Scotland</hi>—, and this way of <hi>Arguing</hi> ſeems very juſt, becauſe if you pleaſe to Abſtract <hi>Jacobitiſm</hi> from <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> you will leave no <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> there, but what is already To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated by <hi>Law</hi>—, <hi>viz.</hi> by the <hi>Act</hi> the firſt <hi>Perliament</hi> WIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIAM <hi>and</hi> MARY, which Ordained that all thoſe <hi>Epiſcopal Miniſters</hi> who would take the <hi>Oaths</hi> ſhould Continue in their <hi>Churches</hi>—, <hi>and there they remain to this Day,</hi> a kind of <hi>Toleration</hi> much Superior to that in <hi>England,</hi> for theſe Enjoy the <hi>Preſbyterian Stipends</hi> and <hi>Manſes</hi>—, and in ſome of their <hi>Pariſhes</hi> the <hi>Eſtabliſht Church Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters</hi> Preach by them in <hi>Meeting Houſes</hi> to this Hour, as Mr. <hi>Ponton</hi> in <hi>Kinghorn,</hi> and others, if the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> will not call this <hi>Toleration,</hi> they will find it hard to tell us what is <hi>Toleration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Champions</hi> of this <hi>Toleration Project,</hi> finding this <hi>Argument</hi> turned too Hard upon them—, have ſet up a New One—, and which therefore I have added in the <hi>Queſtion,</hi> and this is about Tolerat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Common-Prayer Book</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi>—, and this brings a New <hi>Diſpute</hi> upon the <hi>Stage</hi>—, a <hi>Diſpute</hi> that ſeems to have more <hi>Policy</hi> than <hi>Religion</hi> in it, and I doubt not but it will ſoon be Detected.</p>
            <p>That this is not a <hi>Caſe</hi> of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> but a <hi>Party Trick</hi> to Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broil, will appear, if we Conſider two or three Things.<list>
                  <item>1. That for <hi>twenty eight</hi> Years preceeding the <hi>Revolution,</hi> when the <hi>Epiſcopal Church</hi> was (humanely ſpeaking) Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant in <hi>Scotland,</hi> they never admitted of the <hi>Engliſh Liturgy</hi> among them; nor was it ever Attempted for 100 Years before, but once by Arch-biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> and his <hi>Party,</hi> which <hi>Attempt</hi> was the <hi>Overthrow</hi> of all the <hi>Contrivers,</hi> and it is more than Probable may be ſo again, if they go on with it; This proves it is not any part of the <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of the <hi>Epiſcopal Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi>—, and therefore can not be ſaid to be Demanded in behalf of <hi>Conſcience.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. From the <hi>Revolution</hi> to the Time of the <hi>Union,</hi> during which Time the <hi>Epiſcopal non-jurant Clergy</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> have Erected ſeveral <hi>Meetings</hi> or <hi>Conventicles</hi> of their Party for <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Worſhip</hi>—, they have had very little Thought of the <hi>Engliſh Liturgy,</hi>—but what of it is come among them, is a meer <hi>Innovation</hi> thruſt in upon them by the Artifice of a <hi>Party,</hi> in part to claim <hi>Kindred</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and partly to Inflame and Enrage the <hi>People</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who they know are <hi>Averſe</hi> to it.</item>
                  <item>3. At this Time, while the <hi>Leaders</hi> of the <hi>Party</hi> are Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this upon the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>People</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi>—; They have ſome Difficulty to make their own <hi>People</hi> Agree to, and Eſpouſe it—, the thing is ſo far from being Deſired by the <hi>People</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that even theſe who frequent their <hi>Meetings,</hi> that are <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> in <hi>Religious Principles,</hi> and <hi>Jacobite</hi> in <hi>Politick Principles,</hi> yet Shun the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> Diſlike it—, and are with <hi>Difficulty</hi> and <hi>Reluctance</hi> brought to bear it; nay in moſt Parts they will not <hi>Comply</hi> with it, but <hi>Abandon</hi> thoſe that Read it, and Throng after thoſe <hi>Epiſcopal Ministers</hi> that Decline it.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:0554400100:29"/>
Theſe are Sufficient to make it appear, that the <hi>Attempt</hi> of Erecting the <hi>Common Prayer-Book</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> is not founded in the <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences</hi> of the <hi>People</hi>—, That it is a <hi>Politck Deſign</hi> to carry on a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Intereſt</hi> among us in <hi>England,</hi> and Embroil, if poſſible, the <hi>People</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> with the <hi>Government,</hi> is evident from the last <hi>Head,</hi> that they are at Pains to bring their own <hi>People</hi> to Eſpouſe it, which if it were not to Serve their <hi>Civil Intereſt,</hi> it will be hard to Suggeſt on what <hi>Foundation</hi> they make the <hi>Attempt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I come next to <hi>Enquire</hi> into the <hi>Civil Rights</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> as they stand, either <hi>Supported</hi> or <hi>Invaded</hi> by this <hi>Attempt</hi>—; if then the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> has a <hi>Civil Right</hi> to the <hi>Eccleſiaſtick Immunity</hi> ſhe Enjoys, and that the <hi>Union</hi> had Confirmed theſe <hi>Rights,</hi> then nothing can be Impoſed upon her, againſt her preſent <hi>Settlement,</hi> without Breach of the <hi>Union:</hi> And this I preſume to ſay, No <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Authority</hi> now Eſtabliſht in <hi>Britain,</hi> can ſo much as Attempt without <hi>Diſſolving</hi> the very <hi>Conſtitution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the <hi>UNION</hi> then, and the ſeveral <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> for the <hi>Security</hi> of the <hi>Preſbyterian Church,</hi> which are Confirmed by, and made <hi>Part</hi> of that <hi>Union</hi>—; The <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Uniformity</hi> of the <hi>Worſhip, Diſcipline</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> is to be Preſerved <hi>to the People of</hi> Scotland WITHOUT ANT AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERATION, Mark theſe <hi>Words,</hi> I Repeat them again, WITHOUT ANT ALTERATION to all <hi>Succeeding Generations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any Man will ſay, That Tolerating the <hi>Common Prayer</hi> can Conſist with <hi>Preſerving</hi> the <hi>Uniformity</hi> of the <hi>Worſhip</hi>—, or the Tolerating <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> can Conſist with the preſerving the <hi>Government</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> or either of them with Preſerving the <hi>Diſcipline;</hi> then I may be ready to Enquire further.</p>
            <p>On the other Hand, if they are not, then they cannot be offered to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland;</hi> nor can even the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>Britain</hi> Erect ſuch a <hi>Toleration</hi> without <hi>Invading</hi> the <hi>UNION,</hi> which I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive they have not <hi>Power</hi> to do.</p>
            <p>Nor can the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>People</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> legally give their <hi>Conſent</hi> to any ſuch <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Toleration;</hi> becauſe this <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Uniformity</hi> is to be <hi>Preſerved</hi> to all <hi>Succeeding Generations;</hi> and the preſent <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration</hi> has no more <hi>Power</hi> to give up what by the <hi>Union</hi> is thus En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed on their <hi>Poſterity,</hi> than the <hi>Parliament</hi> can give up what is Conceded to the ſaid Preſent Generation.</p>
            <p>By this it ſeems, the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> is ſo Establiſhed, that neither can her <hi>Enemies</hi> Impoſe <hi>Toleration</hi> upon her; neither can her Treacherous or Negligent <hi>Friends,</hi> too many of whom ſhe may have <hi>in Power,</hi> give up her <hi>Claim</hi> to her <hi>Eſtabliſhment;</hi> neither can ſhe her ſelf Abandon her <hi>Right</hi> to, or her <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> of her <hi>Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment,</hi> Excluſive of all manner of <hi>Innovations</hi> or <hi>Invaſious</hi> on the <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Uniformity</hi> of her <hi>Worſhip, Diſcipline</hi> or <hi>Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I think is the preſent State of the <hi>Queſtion</hi> about <hi>Toleration</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> what Gloſs the Artifice of <hi>Enemies,</hi> and the Craft of <hi>Parties</hi> may put upon the <hi>Attempts</hi> now making, of Invading the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> I have nothing to do with in
<pb n="xxix" facs="tcp:0554400100:30"/>
this <hi>Treatiſe;</hi> I am ſure if the <hi>Repreſentatives</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> are <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> and <hi>Vigilant,</hi> ſhe is in no <hi>Danger</hi>—; nor can Her <hi>Church Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges</hi> be Invaded by a <hi>Toleration,</hi> without Deſtroying the <hi>Civil</hi> as well as <hi>Eccleſiaſtick Conſtitution,</hi> upon which whole <hi>Britain</hi> is at this Time Establiſht by the <hi>UNION.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two Things I find fall naturally in our Way as <hi>Objections</hi> (in <hi>England eſpecially,</hi>) when we <hi>argue</hi> againſt Tolerating the <hi>Engliſh Liturgy</hi> in <hi>Scotland; Firſt,</hi> That this is falling upon the <hi>Common Prayer Book,</hi> and Inſulting the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi>—; And <hi>Secondly,</hi> That this will be Injurious to the <hi>Toleration</hi> which the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> Enjoy in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is moſt certain in strict Juſtice, That tho' both theſe were true, it makes nothing to the <hi>Argument.</hi> The <hi>Queſtion</hi> is not of Civility to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> or of Prudentials to the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> but of <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi>—, We are here in a <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Property</hi> Capitulated for by the <hi>UNION,</hi> Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulated for, and Agreed to by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> that <hi>no Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> ſhall be made; that the <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Uniformity</hi> ſhall be Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: Either it is Preſerved, or it is not—; If the <hi>Common Prayer</hi> be Impoſed on them; If <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> be Tolerated, their <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> is Altered, or it is not—; if it be, then the <hi>Union</hi> is Invaded, or it is not; the <hi>Queſtions</hi> are ſhort, and need no Cavilling—, tho' ſpeaking of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and of the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> The <hi>Scots</hi> may be Civil to one, and Careful of the other; yet they must not give up their <hi>Eſtabliſht Rights</hi> on that Score, this were to Complement them at too great an <hi>Expence</hi>—: Would the <hi>Conſcientious Epiſcopal People</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> be Eaſy, no <hi>Body</hi> Molested them, they Enjoyed their <hi>Liberty</hi> Unmoleſted enough, and in a manner which the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> in <hi>England</hi> for many Years would have Rejoyc'd at—; but when nothing will Satisfy, but <hi>Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> upon <hi>Declared</hi> and <hi>Eſtabliſht Rights,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> is then bound to Aſſert her own <hi>Property,</hi> and neither the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> or the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> ought to take it ill from them.</p>
            <p>But after all, the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> have no Reaſon to <hi>take it ill,</hi> that the <hi>Scots</hi> do not make Uſe of the <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> any more than the <hi>Scots</hi> have to <hi>take it ill,</hi> that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> do not make Uſe of the <hi>Preſbyterian Diſcipline;</hi> They are two <hi>National Churches;</hi> Either of them have their reſpective <hi>Kingdom</hi> to which they belong, <hi>Conſtitution</hi> on which they are built, and <hi>Laws</hi> by which they are Establiſht; They are perfectly <hi>Independent</hi> one of another, and have no <hi>Superiority</hi> over, or <hi>Subjection</hi> to one another—, They are <hi>Confederated</hi> by the <hi>UNION,</hi> and the <hi>Butts</hi> and <hi>Bounds</hi> of their reſpective <hi>Influence,</hi> are <hi>Stated</hi> and Irreverſibly <hi>Determined,</hi> I ſay, they are but Confederated, <hi>for it is no more,</hi> the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> are <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated,</hi> but the <hi>Churches</hi> are but <hi>Confederated;</hi> but the <hi>Links</hi> of this <hi>Chain</hi> are ſo nicely Twisted together, that the <hi>Confederacy</hi> can not be <hi>Broken</hi> withouthout <hi>Deſtroying</hi> the <hi>Incorporation,</hi> and the One is the <hi>Bond</hi> of the Other—; It can then be no <hi>Affront</hi> to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> to have the <hi>Scots</hi> ſay, We will have nothing to
<pb n="xxx" facs="tcp:0554400100:31"/>
do with your <hi>Common Prayer</hi>—, Nor to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to have the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> ſay, We will have nothing to do with your <hi>Preſbyterian Diſcipline</hi>—: It was the Great <hi>Preliminary</hi> of the <hi>Treaty,</hi> That the <hi>Churches</hi> of either <hi>Kingdom,</hi> ſhould have nothing to do with One Another—; And therefore the <hi>Treaters</hi> on both Hands, were expreſly Forbid to Meddle with the <hi>Affair</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>—, whoſe <hi>Eſtabliſhments,</hi> it was found abſolutely Neceſſary ſhould not in the least Interfere with One Another—, nor their reſpective <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> be Suffered to <hi>Incroach</hi> upon, or <hi>Invade</hi> One the Other. If any have Reaſon therefore, to <hi>take ill</hi> any thing from the Other, the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> has the firſt <hi>Offence</hi> given her, by this <hi>Attempt</hi> of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading</hi> her <hi>Uniformity;</hi> Only this is to be ſaid for it, That it is the <hi>Act</hi> and <hi>Deed</hi> of a <hi>Party,</hi> not of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Danger</hi> to the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> with Reſpect to the <hi>Tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> they now Enjoy in <hi>England</hi>—; The <hi>Fears</hi> of that ſeem to be altogether Groundleſs, to any Man that Rightly <hi>Underſtands,</hi> either the Nature of the <hi>Toleration</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> or the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Queſtion</hi> concerning <hi>Toleration</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi>—, in which it is Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that the <hi>Difference</hi> is ſo Wide, that no <hi>Argument</hi> can be drawn from the One to the Other, either to <hi>Strengthen</hi> or <hi>Deſtroy.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> Oppoſe a <hi>Toleration</hi> by a <hi>Claim</hi> of <hi>Right,</hi> ſtipulated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Two <hi>Nations,</hi> and it is evident—, when the <hi>Act</hi> for <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> was paſt in <hi>Scotland</hi>—, this very Matter of <hi>Toleration</hi> was not a little Debated, and the <hi>Preſbyterian Oppoſers</hi> of the <hi>UNION</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> were not Backward to expreſs their Apprehenſions of a <hi>Toleration</hi> being Brought upon them by the <hi>UNION</hi>—, They were <hi>Anſwered</hi> by the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Security,</hi> which was ſuppoſed, believed, and intended to be Effectual againſt <hi>ſuch a Thing</hi>—, and had they not thought it Sufficient, but inſiſted in <hi>Words</hi> at length, That <hi>the</hi> Engliſh Liturgy <hi>ſhould not have been Tolerated,</hi> or at all Uſed in <hi>Scotland</hi> in Publick. I may Appeal to all the <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> Concern'd, either in <hi>Scotland,</hi> or here in <hi>England,</hi> That it would not have been Denyed—; And the <hi>Author</hi> of this is Witneſs to <hi>Large Aſſurances</hi> given to this Purpoſe; but it was thought Modeſter to ſet it down in leſs pointed Terms—, no Man Doubting but that an <hi>Article</hi> to Preſerve the <hi>Uniformity</hi> of <hi>Worſhip</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> WITHOUT ANY ALTERATION in all <hi>Succeeding Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> muſt be ſuppoſed to contain a Sufficient <hi>Security</hi> againſt the <hi>Engliſh Liturgy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now it would ſeem a very Groſs <hi>Suggeſtion,</hi> and Reproach the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> with ſtrange <hi>Injuſtice,</hi> to allege that they ſhould Diſcontinue their <hi>Toleration</hi> to <hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they themſelves, having Conſented to the <hi>Excluſion</hi> of <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> hold them to their <hi>Bargain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides the <hi>Toleration</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> would <hi>the</hi> Diſſenters <hi>ſee their own Right to it,</hi> has a Legal <hi>Claim,</hi> and a <hi>Capitulation</hi> alſo on which it is Founded, and can not without Manifeſt <hi>Injuſtice</hi> be Invaded by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> but to Invade it, becauſe the <hi>Scots</hi> will not Tolerate <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> which they (the <hi>Engliſh</hi>) Conſented ſhould
<pb n="xxxi" facs="tcp:0554400100:32"/>
not be Tolerated, would be a double <hi>Injuſtice,</hi> and is a <hi>Reproach</hi> to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> ſo much as to imagine.</p>
            <p>I think this Argument needs no further Diſcourſe—; The <hi>Scots</hi> do inſist upon it, that by the <hi>UNION</hi> they ought not, and by tha <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of their <hi>Church</hi> they can not admit the <hi>Common-Prayer Book</hi> to be publickly uſed in <hi>Scotland</hi>—; and thoſe that offer it to them, know the People there will by no means bear it—, I am loath to ſay that's the chief <hi>Motive</hi> of the <hi>Attempt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Several other <hi>Diſputes</hi> happned in <hi>Scotland</hi> after the <hi>UNION,</hi> which can not be brought into the Compaſs of a <hi>Preface,</hi> and muſt be refer'd to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Hiſtories</hi> of thoſe <hi>Times</hi>—; As the <hi>Act</hi> for making the <hi>Trials</hi> in Caſes of <hi>High Treaſon,</hi> the ſame in both <hi>Countries</hi>—; Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned, as is Noted before, by the <hi>Diſputes</hi> which happened at the <hi>Trials</hi> of the four <hi>Gentlemen</hi> brought from <hi>England</hi> on the <hi>Invaſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Caſe of the <hi>Drawbacks</hi> on <hi>Fiſh</hi> Cured with <hi>Foreign Salt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported</hi> between the making the <hi>UNION,</hi> and the <hi>firſt</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> which being a <hi>Debate</hi> that can never happen again, is not Material; only to Note, that tho' the <hi>Intent</hi> and <hi>Meaning</hi> of the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>UNION,</hi> was not for them, nor indeed the <hi>Equity</hi> of the Caſe—; For they could not be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to <hi>Drawback</hi> what they never paid, yet the Letter of the <hi>UNION</hi> being for them, the <hi>Parliament</hi> Voted them their <hi>Money,</hi> which was a <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of the Regard the <hi>Britiſh Parliament</hi> always have, and muſt always have to the <hi>UNION;</hi> The Caſe in ſhort was this,</p>
            <p>By the Eighth <hi>Article</hi> of the <hi>UNION,</hi> ſeveral <hi>Allowances</hi> are made, as <hi>Drawbacks</hi> upon <hi>Fiſh</hi> Cured in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Exported</hi> again—; The reaſon of this <hi>Allowance,</hi> was, becauſe the Salt with which they are Cured paying a great <hi>Duty</hi>—, that <hi>Duty</hi> ought to be drawn back upon <hi>Exportation</hi>—; Now between the Ratifying the <hi>Treaty</hi> and the <hi>firſt</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> when it was to take Place, a very great Quantity of Foreign Salt <hi>(French)</hi> was <hi>Imported,</hi> which by the paſſing all the <hi>Goods</hi> ſo <hi>Imported</hi> as before, paid none of the <hi>Engliſh Duties</hi>—. Now it was alledged, that as the <hi>Duty</hi> did not <hi>Commence</hi> upon the <hi>Salt,</hi> ſo the <hi>Drawback</hi> ought not to <hi>Commence,</hi> which was the <hi>Effect</hi> of that <hi>Duty</hi>—; But the Letter of the <hi>Act</hi> being expreſs <hi>Article</hi> the <hi>VIII. That all</hi> Fiſh <hi>Cured with Foreign</hi> Salt <hi>ſhall Drawback,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Parliament</hi> Voted it, and <hi>Scotland</hi> got about Twenty Seven Thouſand Pound <hi>Sterling Drawback,</hi> where they paid little or nothing of <hi>Duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not remember any thing Material that happened in this <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,</hi> more than what has been hinted at here—; The <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>BRITAIN</hi> went on to Eaſe the <hi>Scots</hi> in every Thing that came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and except the <hi>Act</hi> above-mentioned about <hi>Treaſon,</hi> I know nothing that past againſt the <hi>Joynt Opinion</hi> of the <hi>Scots Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> in Two <hi>Seſſions</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> which have ſat before the writing theſe <hi>Sheets.</hi>

            <head>A GENERAL HISTORY OF UNIONS IN BRITAIN.</head>
            <p>IN order to come to a clear Underſtanding in the whole Frame of this wonderful Tranſaction, THE UNION, 'tis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to let the Reader into the very Original of it, and Enquire where the firſt Springs are to be found, from whence this mighty Tranſaction has been Form'd.</p>
            <p>And tho' this will of courſe lead us back a great way into Hiſtory, yet it will carry this Advantage along with it, that we ſhall ſee all the ſeveral Steps which have been taken, how Providence has led the Nations, as it were, by the Hand, and brought them by the Hints of their mutual Diſaſters, to ſeek this Treaty, as the only Harbour the Ship of the State could ſafely come to an Anchor in.</p>
            <p>Nor is it unworthy Obſervation, eſpecially to thoſe who love to remark the Connection of Providences in the Affairs of this World, and the various Turns the Iſland of <hi>Britain</hi> has had in the Compaſs of a few paſt Years; All which have had their direct Tendency to this great Event, tho' perfectly Unforeſeen, either by the Actors or the Lookers on in thoſe Ages.</p>
            <p>The Animoſities between theſe two Nations, would require a great deal of Time and Art to Deſcribe, they are not ſo remarkable for their Antiquity and Original, as for their Nature and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
            <p>Never two Nations that had ſo much Affinity in Circumſtances, have had ſuch Inveteracy and Averſion to one another in their Blood.</p>
            <p>They have been both the Inhabitants of the Richeſt, the Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulleſt, &amp; moſt populous Iſland in the World. And by frequent mutual
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0554400100:35"/>
Invaſions made upon them, by the ſame Foreign Nations, who have left their Race behind them, it is not at all an Excurſion to ſay, They are the ſame in Blood, of the ſame Off-ſpring, and became Inhabitants the ſame way.</p>
            <p>If it be Objected, That the North and North-Weſt Parts of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> are <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and retain both the Sirnames, Manners, and Language of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> or the Ancient <hi>Scoti,</hi> from whence the whole Kingdom had its Name; It is alſo Anſwered, ſo has <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Wales, Cornwal,</hi> &amp; <hi>Weſtmorland</hi> the Ancient <hi>Britains,</hi> who retain their Sirnames, Manners and Languages, as diſtinctly as the Highlanders in the North, or the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in the Iſlands of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But take the South Part of <hi>Scotland,</hi> on this fide the <hi>Tay,</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, <hi>tho' very Ancient,</hi> muſt be allowed to be the Remains of the <hi>Roman</hi> Colonies, afterwards of the <hi>Danes,</hi> ſome <hi>Saxons;</hi> and among all theſe, the <hi>Picts,</hi> who we ſuppoſe, to have been the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, <hi>England</hi> is much more mixt in Blood, and the Reaſon of this is plain, in that, being a Nation powerful in Wealth, Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Soil, and above all, increaſing in Commerce, more Nations have ſought to ſettle among them, numbers of People have flowed in upon them, from all Parts of the World, and blending their Blood with the moſt ancient Families, have deſtroyed all that can be called National, as to Antiquity among them, and they do not pretend to it.</p>
            <p>Whereas in <hi>Scotland,</hi> under all the Mixtures they have ſuffered, their ancient Families ſeem to have been preſerved, and Foreign Nations have only ſeemed to increaſe their Number.</p>
            <p>However this be, there is Nearneſs of Blood enough, I mean as to Originals, to have occaſioned ſome Propenſity to Coalition, and mutual Neighbourhood between the Nations; &amp; one would have thought, ſome happy Accident might have fallen out, ſome Lucid Interval, ſome convenient Criſis of Circumſtances, or Juncture of Inclination, to have brought them together, made them faſt Friends, and ſo have joyn'd their victorious Arms, to the Terrour of their Neighbours.</p>
            <p>But the Rancor has run in the Blood, the Hatred between the Nations, has lookt like a meer Original, a ſort of Antipathy, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detary from Generation, Born with the very Nations, and has long Threatned us with being too faſt rooted there, ever to be remov'd, but <hi>like a malignant rank Leproſie,</hi> by pulling up Foundations.</p>
            <p>Nor will all the Hiſtory which I ſhall Trace in the purſuit of this Affair, Illuſtrate it more than the very Story of <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion it ſelf;</hi> The ſtrange Oppoſition made to the Treaty, and to the Parliament in <hi>Scotland,</hi> againſt all manner of Reaſoning, againſt Nature, againſt Intereſt, the Averſion to it among thoſe very People that are now made Happy by it, with what Convulſions this evil Spirit was caſt out, what Struggles it made at parting, how the poor Enſlaved People fought againſt their approaching Freedom, Inſulted the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots of their Liberty, and with inexpreſſible Uneaſineſs, received
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0554400100:36"/>
the Bleſſing of Univerſal Peace. Theſe things, I ſay, will be laſting Teſtimonies to that Original Averſion that was planted in the Minds of the People, notwithſtanding the Nearneſs of their Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in other Caſes.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not go back to the Wars here, between the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> and the <hi>Britains,</hi> in the Time of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and how afterwards in the declining of their Empire, the <hi>Britains fatally to them,</hi> called in the <hi>Saxons</hi> to ſupport them againſt the Fury of the <hi>Scots;</hi> The Famous <hi>Picts</hi> Wall built in the Time of the <hi>Romans,</hi> the Remains whereof are viſible to this day, are ſad Tokens of the Ancient Quarrels, Wars, and Devaſtations that were carried on between the two Kingdoms, even beyond our Accounts of Time.</p>
            <p>Nor does it appear to me, That there was in all thoſe Times, any Propenſity between the Nations to ſuch a thing as Peace, no not for many Ages after thoſe Times, but if either Side found it convenient to Treat, even thoſe Treaties were carried on with a kind of a profeſſed Reſolution of renew'd War on the firſt occaſion; and I think Hiſtory gives us no Account of any firm reſolv'd Peace ever made among them, but only ſhort Truces of Peace for a Term of Years, very often for One year, Two or Three, at the end of which, the War was ſuppoſed to break out again of courſe.</p>
            <p>Nor were theſe Wars carried on like the Wars between other Nations, with Policy, Temper, and Points of Honour, but all that could be expected, when two Terrible and War-like Nations, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to all poſſible Extreams, ſhall meet, have been to be found here—; Theſe unhappy Wars have therefore been all Devaſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Blood, the Invaſions on either Side have always been Fire and Death, the Land laid waſte with Burnings and Plunder, and then the Armies Fighting with Fury and Deſperation, no Nations that ever Fought, <hi>ſince what we are told of in the old Eaſtern and</hi> Roman <hi>Empires,</hi> have killed ſo many in Fight; And if I ſhould enter into proportions of Land &amp; People, I need not make Exceptions for them either, Sixty Thouſand, Thirty Thouſand, Twenty and Fifteen Thouſand ſlain of a Side, have been the frequent Numbers, of which Hiſtory gives Account in the Wars between theſe two miſerable Nations, and that not ſeldom, but very often, and ſome very lately.</p>
            <p>I forbear to enter into a further Deſcription of the ancient Feuds of theſe Nations, as what is but a Melancholly Retroſpect, to any that have but common Compaſſion for their Countrey; this may ſerve to Illuſtrate the preſent Subject, and make the Peace we now enjoy, the more valuable to Poſterity.</p>
            <p>The firſt Entrance I ſhall make on the Matter of Coalition ſeems to begin with <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt King of <hi>England,</hi> and this as it was on a wrong Foot, ſo its Continuance was accordingly—; That Victorious Monarch poſſeſt the whole Iſland of <hi>Britain,</hi> for he pierced <hi>Scotland</hi> to the <hi>Orcades,</hi> and Traverſed all the Mountains of <hi>Wales,</hi> ſubdued all the petty Princes of the <hi>Britains,</hi> and had projected to call himſelf King of <hi>Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0554400100:37"/>
But Providence had better Things in Store for this Iſland, his projected Empire, Founded on Conqueſt, Ended ere it began, all his Victories were Unravelled in his Effeminate Luxuriant Son, and he that had Torn the Crown from his Neighbours, had in his Poſterity his own Crown laid at the Foot of Juſtice, and taken from the Heads of a Thoughtleſs young Tyrant his Son, whoſe Life was made to pay for the Oppreſſions of his own Subjects.</p>
            <p>It was in this Kings Reign, the firſt Project of Uniting the two Kingdoms was laid, and tho' it proved Abortive in its moſt Early Execution, yet it is very uſeful to the preſent purpoſe, and to the Readers Information, to give the World a Scheme of this deſigned Union, and to let thoſe Gentlemen who have Oppoſed it now as a Novelty, know, that it was the Opinion of both the Nations in all Ages, for this was in 1386, that a Union would be for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Good of the whole—; See Engliſh <hi>Buchan. Fol.</hi> 245.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, we find one of the Kings of <hi>Scotland,</hi> viz. <hi>Robert Bruce,</hi> who was really one of the Greateſt Kings <hi>Scotland</hi> ever had, among the Inſtructions left for the Conduct of his Succeſſor, leaving this ſtated Rule, <hi>viz.</hi> Never to make a perpetual Amity with the <hi>Engliſh, Buchan. Lib.</hi> 8. <hi>Fol.</hi> 86.</p>
            <p>But the Reaſons given for it, will not at all be brought in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of a Union, or Incorporation of the two Nations, for as to long Receſſes which that Prince argued, to prove, that the <hi>Scots</hi> by Diſuſe would be rendred unfit for Arms, and ſo be the more eaſily worſted by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who by Foreign Wars were always kept Active and Vigorous, and by that means were likely to have Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of them; that can be no Argument, the Nations now ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no more occaſion for that Emulation.</p>
            <p>Nor does it ſeem to me but the ſame principle of Care for his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Countrey, which led King <hi>Robert</hi> to be ſo Thoughtful for Time to come, <hi>Could he have ſeen what theſe Ages have been brought to know,</hi> would by the ſame Reaſoning, have led him vigorouſly to have purſued a Conjunction of the two Kingdoms, into one Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated Body; If he had ſeen the leaſt Proſpect of ſuch an Attempt, being Feaſible: and I believe this not from the Nature of the Thing only, and its Correſpondence with his General Intereſt—; But from this Note, That in his Succeſſors Times—, when the firſt proper Seaſon ſeemed to offer, it was not Thought of on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but purſued with all poſſible Diligence, as ſhall appear in its proper place.</p>
            <p>But to go back to the State of the Wars in his Reign, and a little before.</p>
            <p>Who ever will give himſelf leave to Read the Hiſtory of the Wars at that Time, will wonder how <hi>Scotland</hi> was able to Struggle with ſuch Terrible Loſſes, and may reckon up above 200000 <hi>Scotſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> ſlain in Fight, only againſt King <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, beſides all the other Havock, five ſeveral Invaſions of a Conquering Enemy, muſt be attended with.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0554400100:38"/>
And yet with what Vigour they ſhook off the Yoke, how they were to his Death, I mean King <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, preparing new Armies, and in the ſpace of but two years after it, ventured a Battle with his Son <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, at the Head of 100000 <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> at <hi>Bannockburn,</hi> and beat him out of the Field with the greateſt Slaughter that was ever made in <hi>Britain,</hi> ſince the Fight between <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror and King <hi>Harold,</hi> there being, as ſome Hiſtories ſay, 60000 Men ſlain on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Side.</p>
            <p>Thus ended the Union of Conqueſt between the Nations, <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> recovered her Liberty, and <hi>England</hi> paid very dear for the Experiment.</p>
            <p>But this is not the Reaſon why I begin at this Period, but as the firſt Senſe of the Bleſſings of Union began to touch the People of this Age, it can not but be acknowledged the great, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the only Point of Time, to take the Riſe of this Voluminous Story from.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> was one of the greateſt Inſtances of the Viciſſitudes and precarious Condition of a Royal State in the World, in the ſpace of about three Years, he had two Wives, and a flouriſhing Off-ſpring, was left firſt a Widower, then Childleſs, and at laſt Lifeleſs, and the Crown of <hi>Scotland</hi> in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Hopeleſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> the Second King of <hi>England</hi> Dying, King <hi>Alexander</hi> and his Queen takes a Journey to <hi>England,</hi> in Complement to King <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt, and to be preſent at his Coronation; I ſhall avoid Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting here any thing of the ſo much controverted Article of Homage, let it be how it will, 'tis not to the preſent purpoſe, to me it ſeems not at all the Buſineſs of that Journey, if it had, there had been no need of the Queens going too, nor do I Read of any Thing but a Viſit of Complement, or a Journey of Curioſity, to ſee the Pomp and Grandeur of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court, which was then very great.</p>
            <p>In this Journey, Fatal to the Family as well as to <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Queen Sickned, and ſoon after Dyed; She was followed in a few Months by both her Sons, <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> the latter being but juſt Married to the Daughter of <hi>Baldwin</hi> Earl of <hi>Flanders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor was this all, Diſaſters ſeldom come alone, <hi>Margaret</hi> the Kings only Daughter Married to the King of <hi>Norway,</hi> Dyed the ſame year, leaving one Daughter only, Named alſo <hi>Margaret;</hi> Of whom preſently.</p>
            <p>The King ſurprized with this general Shock of Mortality upon his Family, finding himſelf Childleſs, and Unmarried, <hi>but being in his Prime of Age and Strength,</hi> Reſolves upon Marriage to Reſtore his Family, and accordingly he Marries <hi>Joletta</hi> Daughter of the Earl of <hi>Dreux</hi> in <hi>Normandy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Heaven had yet further Judgments for <hi>Scotland,</hi> for before any Children were born of this Marriage, the King himſelf fell from his Horſe, and his Kingdom, both at once, for he Broke his
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0554400100:39"/>
Neck in the Fall at or near <hi>Kinghorn,</hi> a little Town in <hi>Fife,</hi> on the North-ſide of the Firth over againſt <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The only Heir to the Crown, was now <hi>Margaret</hi> Daughter of <hi>Hangonanus</hi> King of <hi>Norway,</hi> by <hi>Margaret</hi> aforeſaid, the only Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third King of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here is the firſt Demonſtration of what I ſhall all along in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt on in this Hiſtory, <hi>viz.</hi> That never any rational Proſpect of Uniting theſe Kingdoms appeared in the World, but both the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions unanimouſly agreed, that Union was for the mutual Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of both, and that it never was Oppoſed by either Nation, <hi>as a Nation,</hi> but only as Private Intereſt, Strength of Parties, Court Intrigues, and the Enemies of both the Nations have prevailed, to prevent their Happineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> Dyed in the year 1285, without Iſſue, Vid. <hi>Buchan. De Rerum</hi> Scoticarum <hi>Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>Fol.</hi> 71. <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt King of <hi>England,</hi> a Powerful and Politick Prince, ſaw himſelf in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to Manage <hi>Scotland</hi> by Force, as afterwards too ſadly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, but a better Proſpect at that Time being in View, he falls immediately upon a Scheme, which, if Providence had permitted it to have taken Effect, would have ſecured the Peace of theſe Kingdoms from that Time, and prevented the terrible Effuſion of Blood, which happened that very ſame Age, as well as for many Ages ſince between both Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>And this Project was UNION, the King had one Son <hi>Edward,</hi> Heir to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> who afterwards proved the moſt Unfortunate Prince that ever Reigned in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Crown of <hi>Scotland</hi> had but one Heir, <hi>viz. Margaret</hi> of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> Grandchild to <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third, by <hi>Margaret</hi> his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Married to the King of <hi>Norway.</hi> It preſently Occurs to the King and his Council, That a Marriage between <hi>Edward</hi> his Son and this young Lady <hi>Margaret,</hi> then commonly called, <hi>The Maid of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> would neceſſarily Devolve both the Crowns upon his Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and immediately Eſtabliſh the Peace of both Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>Nor was the Relation very Remote, for <hi>Margaret</hi> was, as above ſaid, the Daughter of <hi>Margaret,</hi> only Daughter of King <hi>Alexander,</hi> by King <hi>Edwards</hi> own Siſter; and therefore the Diſpenſations from the Pope, were then thought neceſſary to be obtained, as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear preſently.</p>
            <p>Upon the Death of King <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſays <hi>Buchanan</hi> in the 8<hi>th.</hi> Book of his Hiſtory, <hi>a Convention of the Eſtates was held at</hi> Scoon, <hi>to Treat about Creating a new King.</hi> Theſe are <hi>Buchanans</hi> Words; <hi>Alexandro cum tota ſtirpe (praeter unam ex filia Neptem) Extincto, Conventus Ordinum</hi> Sconam <hi>indicitur, in quo de novo Rege Creando &amp; ſtatu Regni interim Componendo ageretur.</hi> Buch. Lib. 8. Fol. 72.</p>
            <p>I confeſs, conſidering the Character and Authority of <hi>Buchanan,</hi> I much wonder how he could ſay, They Met about <hi>Creating a new King,</hi> when in the ſame Paragraph, he ſays, <hi>The whole Linage of</hi> Alexander, <hi>except one Grandchild by his Daughter,</hi> being Extinct—; Now if one Grandchild was in Being, the Convention of Eſtates could not be Met to Create a new King.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0554400100:40"/>
Nor does it appear that their Buſineſs was to Create a new King, but to Settle the Government of the Kingdom in ſuch Hands, as might ſecure the publick Peace, during the Abſence of their young Queen, and till ſhe could Arrive from <hi>Norway</hi>—; And that this was their Buſineſs, is alſo evident from <hi>Buchanans</hi> own Relation, in the ſame Chapter Quoted above, where he ſays, That when moſt of the Nobility were come to the ſaid Convention, in the Firſt place, they appointed Vicegerents to Govern Matters, <hi>Eo cum Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quens Nobilitas Veniſſet, primum Omnium Sex Creant, qui ſummae Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram praeeſſent,</hi> Buch. Lib. 8. Fol. 72. for the preſent, That is, till their Queen ſhould Arrive.</p>
            <p>To this Aſſembly <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt King of <hi>England,</hi> ſends his Ambaſſadors to Treat with them, to deſire their Queen, <hi>ſays Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanan,</hi> as a Wife to his Son.</p>
            <p>The Hiſtorical part of this Affair, is not ſo ſignificant to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe, as the Subſtance and Inſention, the Opinion and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Nobility, Princes and People of both Nations had of the Thing they were then doing, in which it will appear,<list>
                  <item>1. That an intire Incorporation of Countries, a Coalition of Intereſts and Affection, as well as Commerce and Conſtitution, was Deſigned, even at that diſtance of Time, as the only Means to Settle the Peace and Happineſs of both Nations.</item>
                  <item>2. That it was the beſt Juncture that ever had happened, or could happen for ſuch a Coalition, and nothing but the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Hand of Providence, who reſerv'd it for a more happy Time, and for more happy Inſtruments to Finiſh, could have prevented.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore <hi>Buchanan</hi> ſays of it, <hi>Hi, cum in Conventu publico Multa de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tilitate publica, quae hoc Matrimonium eſſet ſecatura, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruiſſent,</hi> Scotorum <hi>animos ab ea Affinitate non alienos Invenerunt. Erat enim</hi> Edwardus <hi>Vir Magni animi, Magnaeque Potentiae: Majoris etiam Cupidus: Ejuſque virtus, Patre Vivo, in Bello Sacro, &amp; Mortuo, in ſubigenda Vallia, Enituerat. Neque</hi> Scotorum <hi>nomen unquam Anglo Conjunctius fuiſſe, Meminerant; quam ſub poſtremis Regibus, nec Odia vetusta, unquam Commodius aboleri poſſe videbantur, quam ſi uterque populus honeſtis &amp; aequis Conditionibus, in unum Coiret.</hi> Buch. de Rer. Scot. Lib. 8. Fol. 72. Which his homely Tranſlator has <hi>Engliſhed</hi> thus;<q>The Ambaſſadors in this Seſſion, Diſcourſed much of the publick Utility like to accrue to both Kingdoms by this Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, neither did they find the <hi>Scots</hi> Averſe therefrom, for <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> was a Man of great Courage and Power, yet he deſired to increaſe it; and his Valour highly appeared in the Holy War, in his Fathers Lifetime, and after his Death in his ſubduing of <hi>Wales,</hi> neither were there ever more Endearments paſt between the <hi>Scots</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> than under the laſt Kings; yea the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0554400100:41"/>
ancient Hatred ſeemed no way more likely to be Aboliſhed, than if both Nations on juſt and equal Terms might be United into one.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here is the very ſubſtance of the Queens late Letter to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> about the Union now made; only here, the People unhappily ſeem'd Blind to their own Happineſs, and ſo long ago they were able to ſee it their mutual Intereſt.</p>
            <p>The Ambaſſadors Diſcourſed with the Nobility in the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, about the publick Utility like to accrue to both Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>What is this but mutual Stipulations, Regulations, and in ſhort, a Treaty between them how to make a Union between the Nations, ſuch as might be for the publick Advantage of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</p>
            <p>And this was done with General Endearments between the Kingdoms, mutual Civilities paſſed between the Gentlemen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned on both Sides, for the Good of both; we read of no Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies, no Prejudices, no radicated Antipathies, but the publick Good convinced both Sides, that nothing could Contribute more to the Rooting out and Aboliſhing the ancient Hatred, than to have both Nations on juſt and equal Terms be UNITED INTO ONE.</p>
            <p>Nor is it remote to this purpoſe, to enter a little into the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of this Union, for tho' Hiſtory is very ſilent in this Matter, yet, as I have promiſed to ſearch every Thing in this Hiſtory to the Bottom, I find among the Records in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> an Ancient Inſtrument or Form of this Union or Confederacy, which in the <hi>Appendix</hi> to this Work, you will have Printed at large, and is Numbred 1.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Firſt,</hi> to let the World be ſatisfied, that even in ſo remote a Time, things of this nature were Tranſacted with the ſame due Caution and Regard to the Liberties and Good of the People, as they are now, and that it was a National not a private Act, not an Act of a few, Over-awed by the Power of King <hi>Edward,</hi> tho' ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Steps taken in it, will be very neceſſary to be Noted, for I take this to be the moſt exact Pattern of the preſent Treaty, of any that has ever gone before it, as it was a Treaty ſeriouſly ſet about by both Nations, with a real Deſign for the general Utility, and with a Deſign on both Sides to bring it to paſs, which is more than can be ſaid of all the Treaties which have been ſet on Foot ſince.</p>
            <p>The firſt Step the King took after his ſending Ambaſſadors to Treat with the Convention, ſeems to me to be the obtaining a Diſpenſation from the Pope; the Queen and the young Prince being nearly Allyed; and ſuch was the ſubjection of the Princes of the World to the <hi>Roman</hi> Tyranny, that nothing could go on of this Nature, without the Sanction of the Church, where, by the way may be obſerved;</p>
            <p>That the Pope, as in all Ages Popes have done, made his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Occaſion, and takes this Opportunity, to Demand of the King an old Arrear of an annual Penſion of 1000 Merks,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0554400100:42"/>
Granted by King <hi>John</hi> to the Holy See, and which King <hi>Edward</hi> had leſt five years unpaid.</p>
            <p>The King, who knew well enough the Influence ready Money had in ſuch Caſes, readily anſwers the Popes Demands, and Iſſued his Writ for payment of the Money.</p>
            <p>The true Copy of the Original Warrant to the Treaſurer, is added in the <hi>Appendix</hi> to this Work, which being very ſhort, I thought not Improper to inſert there, as a Thing the Curious may be very well pleaſed to Read, and is marked N<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> (8.)</p>
            <p>It is to be Noted the End of King <hi>Edward</hi> in payment of this Money, was plainly to get the Diſpenſation Expedited, for he never paid any more that I read of, nor his Succeſſors either, I mean, on account of that old Penſion or Grant of King <hi>John's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Holineſs was ſo exceedingly obliged by this payment of 5000 Merks, that he immediately diſpatched the Diſpenſation for the Marriage of Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> with the Heireſs of the Crown of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> tho' within the prohibited Degrees of Conſanguinity; which Diſpenſation is Enrolled in the patent Roll of 17. <hi>Ed.</hi> 1ſt. and may be found in the <hi>Appendix</hi> to this Work, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>The next Step the King takes is, to ſend Ambaſſadors and Letters to the King of <hi>Norway,</hi> giving his Proxie to the Biſhop of <hi>Durham,</hi> one of the ſaid Ambaſſadors, to Eſpouſe the Lady in the Name of his Son <hi>Edward,</hi> wherein the Diſpenſation obtained from the Pope, is Repeated; This Letter and Proxie is added in the <hi>Appendix,</hi> N<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>At the ſame Time he ſends Letters to the Keepers or Guardians of the Realm of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and to the King of <hi>Norway</hi> in Anſwer to Letters received from them, containing all the Articles and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on which it was that he propoſed this Marriage, which were Publiſhed by the King, for the Satisfaction of the Subjects of both Nations, in which you will find all poſſible Care taken of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Good, and ſincere Proteſtations, that the End of this Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, was, as is expreſſed in one of the Letters, <hi>Ad Honorem Dei &amp; Tranquilitatem Totius Communitatis ejuſdem Regni.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Teſtimonials are too ſignificant not to deſerve a Place in this Hiſtory, and therefore are placed in their Order in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, and Numbred 4, 5, 6, 7.</p>
            <p>Nor was this all, but I find a large Charter or Grant made by the Agreement of ſpecial Commiſſioners on both Sides, and Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the King himſelf, to the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſhort, it is a meer Treaty of Union between the Kingdoms, tho' not much Collateral, but rather particularly to <hi>Scotland,</hi> this has the Great Seal affixed to it, and the King took an Oath to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, under the Penalty of One Hundred Thouſand Pounds <hi>Sterling, an immenſe Sum in thoſe days,</hi> to be paid to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> towards carrying on the Wars in the Holy Land, and on the farther Penalty of Excommunication, and ſubjecting his whole Kingdom to an Interdict; Things very Terrible in thoſe Days.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0554400100:43"/>
This Inſtrument alſo is at large found among the Records in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and is Re-printed in <hi>Prynnes</hi> Collection <hi>Fol.</hi> 395. 396, 397. and added in the <hi>Appendix</hi> or <hi>Collection</hi> to this Work, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>Another Inſtrument is alſo Recorded in old <hi>French,</hi> wherein the Security to <hi>Scotland,</hi> for Surrendring her Forts and Strengths to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> on this Marriage, is Settled, and which you will find in the <hi>Collection</hi> alſo, N<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> 10.</p>
            <p>Thus the Affair of an Union was finiſhed above Four Hundred and Twenty Years ago, and theſe Nations had Flouriſhed under its Conſequences no doubt—; But Heaven Frown'd on ſo great a Work, and the Sins of both Nations permitted not that Bleſſing to come in their Day; for the Lady Dyed in her Voyage from <hi>Norway</hi> to <hi>Scotland,</hi> having a Rough Paſſage, and being not able to bear the Fatigues of the Sea; And thus all this fair Fabrick came to nothing, was Daſh'd in a Moment, to the inexpreſſible Loſs and Regret of both the Nations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Buchanan</hi> ſays, She Dyed in <hi>Norway</hi> before the Commiſſioners Arrived, but our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hiſtorians, &amp; Mr. <hi>Tyrrel</hi> in particular, whom in this I follow, <hi>Lib.</hi> 9. <hi>Vol.</hi> 3. <hi>Fol.</hi> 6. ſays poſitively, ſhe Dyed in Her Voyage between <hi>Norway</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot omit to Re-mind the Reader of theſe Sheets, what were the Diſmal Conſequences of this Diſappointment to both theſe Kingdoms, and as it was nothing but the immediate Hand of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence that brought it to paſs, ſo it may, without any Charge of <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> or Over-ſtraining the Caſe, be allowed, to be one of the ſevereſt Judgments that ever Heaven Inflicted on this Iſland.</p>
            <p>And I inſiſt on this, not ſo much as it relates to the preſent Hiſtory, but as it may be needful for ſuch People to Reflect upon, who have, <hi>at the ſame Time that they pretended to be Lovers of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,</hi> yet vigorouſly Oppoſed the Uniting theſe Nations in this laſt Treaty.</p>
            <p>The breaking of the happy Proſpect of Union between the two Kingdoms, was attended with ſtrange Confuſions, all which ſerve to Enhance the Value of their preſent United State, the hopes of a proſperous Peace were not greater on one Hand, than the proſpect of Diſmal Confuſions was Horrid on the other; And tho' it be a Digreſſion, I ſhall venture the Treſpaſs to give a ſhort Abridgement of the Hiſtory of thoſe Times, as in the Courſe of theſe Sheets it ſhall be needful to Form a due Connexion, and I promiſe my ſelf, the Diverſion will be as pleaſant as profitable, and that no body will think it loſt Labour to Read over, what in thoſe Ages was Tranſacted on the Stage of their Native Countrey.</p>
            <p>With the Death of this Princeſs, all the Thoughts of Union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Kingdoms Dyed alſo, each Party began to Examine their ſeparate Intereſts, not Conſulting what was fit to be done for the carrying on their National and General Advantages.</p>
            <p>The Buſineſs of <hi>Scotland</hi> was, how to Settle the Crown, and who to Declare King, the Conſervators or Keepers of the Kingdom, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0554400100:44"/>
by the Convention of the Eſtates Aſſembled at <hi>Scoon,</hi> were according to <hi>Buchanan, Duncan Macduff</hi> Earl of <hi>Fife, John Cumin</hi> Earl of <hi>Buchan, William Frazer</hi> Arch-biſhop of St. <hi>Andrews, Robert</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> another <hi>John Cumin,</hi> and one <hi>John Steuart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The principal Pretenders to the Crown, were, <hi>John Baliol</hi> and <hi>Robert Bruce,</hi> their Deſcent, and the Foundation of their Claim, is at large to be found in <hi>Buchanans</hi> Hiſtory <hi>Lib.</hi> 8. their Titles were remote, and not only pretty equally founded, but their Intereſt among the Nobility was ſo equal, and either way ſo powerful, that nothing but an immediate and Bloody War was apprehended, as the Conſequence of their Pretenſions.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>England</hi> diſappointed in his Hopes of bringing the Kingdoms to a laſting Peace, by Uniting them into one, as before, applyed himſelf no more to Conſult their General Good.</p>
            <p>But conſidering them in their ſeparate Capacity, as two Nations that could not long Agree, made it his whole Study, either firſt to ſubject <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> ſo as that making her Dependent on <hi>England,</hi> ſhe ſhould not be able to Break with him; or ſo to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the <hi>Scots</hi> among themſelves, as that they ſhould be in no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to Hurt him.</p>
            <p>Both his Ends ſeemed eaſie to Anſwer in the Occaſion that now offered it ſelf; for the <hi>Scots</hi> Nobility being, <hi>as I have Noted,</hi> ſo equally divided in the Intereſts of <hi>Baliol</hi> and <hi>Bruce,</hi> that they knew not what Courſe to take, they reſolved, in order to avoid the Confuſions of a War, and conſequently the Ruin of their Countrey, to refer it to the Arbitriment of the King of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was a full Teſtimony of the Harmony and good Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which was then between the Nations, and what a happy Juncture it had been for a Union, if Heaven had thought fit to bleſs the Deſign with Succeſs, any body may obſerve; for the King of <hi>England</hi> was looked upon as ſuch a Diſintereſted Friend to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and one that would willingly concern himſelf for their Good, that they leave the Determination of the weightieſt Thing in the World, <hi>to their Nation,</hi> wholly to his Sentence.</p>
            <p>But I can not ſay the King Acted with equal Candor to the <hi>Scots,</hi> if what the Hiſtories of thoſe Times ſay, may be depended upon; For being a politick Prince, and having a long View of the Effects of Things before him, he reſolved to keep his Eye upon the two Particulars Noted above, in his Determining this Affair, and rather to regard his own Intereſt than the Good of <hi>Scotland,</hi> or than the Juſtice of the Claim; he reſolved to Sound the Inclinations of the two Canditates for the Crown, and ſo to give the Kingdom to him, that would conform himſelf moſt to his Meaſures.</p>
            <p>Upon this he Treats firſt with the Nobility, and appoints a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Berwick,</hi> then he Exacts an Oath of the Competitors, to ſtand intirely to and be Determined by his Award; Then he orders a Select Number out of the Nobility of each Nation, as a Council in this Caſe, Twelve of a Side, Mr. <hi>Tyrrel</hi> ſays, Fourty of a Side, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0554400100:45"/>
Exacts an Oath of them, to Adviſe, Judge, and Determine Rightly and Truly according to their Conſciences.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the Politick Appearances of his Management, the better to cover his true Deſign; for all this while he cauſes the two Competitors to be Sounded Under-hand, to find out which was moſt likely to Comply with his Demands.</p>
            <p>At laſt, the publick Debates beginning to draw near a Period, it was eaſie to ſee, That <hi>Baliols</hi> Title was like to be Approved by the Twenty Four, as the beſt Claim, and that <hi>Bruce</hi> would loſe it, this the King thought, was the Juncture to put it home in, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cauſes it to be propoſed to <hi>Bruce,</hi> That tho' it was plain he would loſe the Crown, yet if he would ſubject himſelf and the Crown, to the Authority of the King of <hi>England,</hi> he ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately Declared.</p>
            <p>All Men muſt Allow it was Politickly Managed, <hi>but all the Craft of Hell is loſt upon an honeſt Man, Bruce</hi> like a Man of Honour, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects the Propoſal with Contempt, and told them that propoſed it, That <hi>he ſcorned to enjoy the Crown at the Price of his Countries Bondage.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Baliol,</hi> whoſe Principle was worſe, tho' his Title was better, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts the baſe Conditions, and obtains the Crown, Swears Fealty to the King of <hi>Kngland,</hi> and makes all the Nobility that were in his Intereſt, do the ſame.</p>
            <p>All our Hiſtorians do not agree in this Account, and Mr. <hi>Tyrrel,</hi> who is very particular in relating the Proceedings, <hi>Vol.</hi> 3. <hi>Lib.</hi> 9. <hi>Fol.</hi> 70, 71, 72. takes no Notice of this, but others, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly <hi>Buchanan</hi> being very poſitive, <hi>Lib.</hi> 8. <hi>Fol.</hi> 24. I put it down as Fact, giving my Authors Authority for it, and leave the Reader to believe as much as he thinks fit of the Fact, the Subject I am upon, not depending upon it at all.</p>
            <p>But he that baſely yields to a Diſhoneſt Yoke, in order to Gratifie his Ambition, is much more likely to break the Conditions he makes, than he that adheres to Honourable Articles, and inſiſts on what Juſtice gives him a Claim to, and thus it was here, for on the firſt Affront offered to <hi>Baliol</hi> by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in conſequence of his Subjection, he threw off the Yoke, and Renounced that Subjection; The Caſe in ſhort was as follows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Macduff</hi> Earl of <hi>Fife</hi> being Injured, as he conceives, in a Suit Depending between him and the <hi>Abernethians,</hi> for the Murder of his elder Brother, <hi>The King having Determined in Favour of the Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,</hi> Appeals to the King of <hi>England</hi> againſt <hi>Baliol</hi>—; When the Cauſe came to be heard, <hi>John Baliol</hi> was then at the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court, and being preſent when he was Called to Anſwer, offers to Plead by a Proxy, <hi>or as we ſay,</hi> to be heard by his Council, but was refuſed, and obliged to come down, and ſtand at the Bar like a Criminal, and plead for himſelf.</p>
            <p>This broke off all his Subjection, fills him with Indignation; and from this Time, he Studies nothing but Revenge; an Opportunity ſoon offered to his Mind, for a War breaking out between the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0554400100:46"/>
and the <hi>French,</hi> and both Soliciting <hi>Scotland</hi> for Aid, the Eſtates of <hi>Scotland</hi> Determine, <hi>Tho' in an ill Hour for Scotland,</hi> to Aſſiſt the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus all the good Temper of both Nations one towards another Vaniſhed at once, and the moſt Bloody Wars that ever this Iſland felt, happened between them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Baliol</hi> by a ſolemn Embaſſy, Renounces his Submiſſion to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as Extorted by unjuſt Methods, and his Friendſhip alſo—; And <hi>Edward</hi> in Return, furiouſly Invades <hi>Scotland</hi> both by Sea and Land.</p>
            <p>'Tis not at all my Deſign, nor to my Purpoſe, to enter here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Hiſtory of theſe Wars, or the Battels, Ravages, Fire and Blood, which the two Nations felt during the whole Reign of the three <hi>Edwards</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> with but ſmall Intermiſſions; the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars whereof would of themſelves make a large Volume—; The true Reaſon of my mentioning theſe Things, will appear in my further proſecuting this Story: The ſhort Uſe of it is this, That theſe two unhappy Nations were always in Extremes with one another; Nothing but the <hi>cloſest <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> or the moſt deſtructive <hi>War,</hi> can be the State they muſt live in together; And this I ſhall but too often make evident in theſe Sheets.</p>
            <p>From this Breach, the War between the Nations came to a ſtrange height, <hi>Edward</hi> proved Victorious over the <hi>Scots,</hi> and the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of that are eaſie to Gueſs, <hi>Baliol</hi> was Cruſht, his Armies Overthrown, the Countrey Pierc't, even to the Extremeſt part by the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edward</hi> calls <hi>Bruce</hi> to his Side, <hi>Baliol</hi> is taken Priſoner and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renders the Kingdom, then the Famous <hi>Wallace</hi> gets up, and carries on the War on the Subject of meer National Liberty, Overthrows the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in ſeveral Encounters, and is made Regent: But is again Overthrown by <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Bruce</hi> at the great Battel of <hi>Falkirk,</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> then intirely ſubmits to <hi>Edward,</hi> whoſe Tyrannical Government makes the very <hi>Scots</hi> who had taken part with him againſt <hi>Baliol,</hi> Conſpire together to Recover their Liberty, and one <hi>Cuming</hi> Leaguing with <hi>Robert Bruce,</hi> Son to that <hi>Bruce</hi> who was to have been King; Theſe, tho' Enemies before, joyn together to free their Countrey. But <hi>Cuming</hi> deſigning to Betray <hi>Bruce,</hi> is Killed by him with his own Hands in the very Church at <hi>Drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How <hi>Bruce</hi> after this Recovered the Kingdom from that Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> How he was often Overthrown by <hi>Edward,</hi> and ſeveral times reduced to hide himſelf in the Mountains, and moſt ſecret Places of the Kingdom, and ſometimes ſo long, that he was ſuppoſed to be Dead;—How yet at laſt by innumerable Attempts, Unwearied Pains, and Invincible Courage he retrived his Fortune, Drove the <hi>Engliſh</hi> out of his Countrey, Overthrew them with a terrible Slaughter at <hi>Bannockburn</hi> near <hi>Stirling,</hi> and after a Reign of Twenty Four Years full of continual War, againſt the moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Princes <hi>England</hi> had in theſe Ages of the World; he Died in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0554400100:47"/>
Peace, his Countrey being Recovered out of their Hands; Theſe Things would be too long a Story here to relate.</p>
            <p>In this War, by the beſt Calculations I can make, of Armies Raiſed, and Battels Fought, no leſs than Six Hundered Thouſand People of both Nations periſhed, and all for want of that happy UNION, ſo near perfected, and ſo diſaſtruouſly loſt. A good Looking-glaſs for thoſe Gentlemen <hi>(who have openly wiſhed theſe Nations might make a Breach either on one Side or another)</hi> to look into, and for them to ſee, <hi>if their Deſigns had</hi> ſucceeded, what their Poſterity might have had cauſe to Thank them for.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If it be Objected,</hi> that it does not follow, That on a Breach of this laſt Treaty <hi>of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> a War muſt neceſſarily have happened, I ſhall take the Liberty to enter upon that Head by it ſelf, and believe theſe Sheets will prove, That a War muſt have been the inevitable Conſequence of breaking up this laſt Treaty, eſpecially if broken up according to the Project of thoſe People that appeared to Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it, who, we all know, acted on Principles, both as to Trade, Civil Government, and Succeſſion, Incompatible with the Intereſt of both the preſent Eſtabliſhments, and as much as can be ſaid perfectly impracticable, as the Kingdoms were thus Conſtituted; But of this more hereafter.</p>
            <p>From this Time, we meet with no Overtures of ſettled Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity between the Kingdoms, till the Days of <hi>Henry</hi> VII. of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe Daughter <hi>Margaret</hi> was Married to <hi>James</hi> IV. King of <hi>Scotland</hi>—; And tho' this Marriage was the Mother of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (as I may Term it) and laid the Foundation of almoſt all the Projects that have happened ſince, and from whence at laſt the Crown of <hi>England</hi> Devolved upon the Royal Line of <hi>Scotland,</hi> yet in his Time there were no immediate Steps taken towards it. The outmoſt Effect of this Marriage, was an immediate Peace between the Nations, which, however, did not laſt long, but King <hi>James</hi> falling in with the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt, fell out with his Father-in-law King <hi>Henry</hi> VII. and after with his Brother King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. and loſt his Life in that War.</p>
            <p>The firſt Attempt ſubſequent to this, was a Propoſal of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. who, after this great Quarrel was ended, tho' he was Victor, offered <hi>to Match his Daughter</hi> Mary <hi>(Prince</hi> Edward, <hi>afterwards King</hi> Edward VI. <hi>being then not Born)</hi> to <hi>James</hi> the 5<hi>th.</hi> King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and to ſecure the poſſeſſion of the Crown after himſelf to them Joyntly; And the deſign of this Match, <hi>it was evident,</hi> could be nothing elſe, but a firm, laſting, and eſtabliſhed Peace between the two Nations; For having himſelf no Sons, and expecting none, <hi>(For the buſineſs of the Divorce of his Wife Queen</hi> Katharine <hi>was not then come into his Head)</hi> He foreſaw this was the only Step to Unite the Nations, and put an End to theſe Bloody Contentions, that for ſo many Ages had been between them, for that the Heirs of that Match would by conſequence be poſſeſt of both, and ſo the whole Iſland would become one Happy and moſt powerful People, United in Intereſt, in Government, and in every Thing that would make them Great.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0554400100:48"/>
This Propoſal was ſo Rational, and ſo viſibly tending to the general Advantage of both Kingdoms, That it could not be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to meet with any Oppoſition from ſuch, as were in the leaſt concerned for the Good of their Native Country on either Hand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>On the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Side</hi> it met with an immediate good Reception, for King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII, contrary to the general Conduct of that Prince, whoſe Temper was (generally ſpeaking) Bloody, Fierce, Haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and too apt to Inſult ſuch as fell into his Hands; Yet here, changing his Temper, he cauſed the <hi>Scots</hi> Priſoners, taken at the late Battel, to be very well Treated, and Committed to the ſeveral Keepings of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility, who uſed them Honourably, and according to their Quality.</p>
            <p>I know it is ſaid, That the King, who had this Project firſt in his Head, diſtributed the <hi>Scots</hi> Noblemen in the Houſes of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Lords, That theſe might, according to his private Inſtructions, deal with them apart, and ſtrive, by Promiſes, and ſuch like Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, to bring them to hearken to ſuch a Propoſal, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the Treaty—; And that the ſaid <hi>Scots</hi> Noblemen were, by this Artifice, prompted, and brought to make the firſt Offer of this Marriage, as from <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let this be as it will, let the Honour of the Propoſal ly where it will, it is manifeſt, both Parties were well pleaſed with it, and look'd upon it as the beſt Method, to bring both Nations to a State of Proſperous and Durable Peace. But <hi>Satan hindered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was evident, That both Kingdoms had a fixed Inclination, at this time, for the Union: <hi>Henry</hi> ſhewed his Good Will, in that he offered to heap up unuſual Honours upon the King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> upon the firſt Project of the Match, as upon his undoubted Succeſſor to the Crown, ſuch as making him a Peer of <hi>Britain,</hi> by the Royal Title of Duke of <hi>York,</hi> a Title Veſted in the Crown, and ſince the Father of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, reckoned the next Step to the Throne; But this was not all, he offered to declare him Lord Lieutenant, or Deputy Governour of <hi>England,</hi> immediately upon the Match; This was to put the Government, as it were, in his actual Poſſeſſion, and make him King by the Conſequence of the Thing—; There is no doubt, but, had this Match ſucceeded, there would have been mutual Stipulations of a compleat Coalition entred into by the reſpective Parliaments of both Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>But <hi>French</hi> and Popiſh Counſels prevented this Happy Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as they have ſeveral others ſince, <hi>and would have done the laſt;</hi> For the Clergy of <hi>Scotland</hi> finding <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. of <hi>England</hi> had cruſht the Power of the Clergy in <hi>England,</hi> and was ſuppreſſing the Abbeys and Monaſteries, curbing the extended Authority of the Pope, and as they apprehended deſtroying their Church, they ſet themſelves by all poſſible Artifice, to prevent this Propoſals taking Effect; And getting the <hi>French</hi> King to joyn his Intereſt with theirs, they wrought the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> to ſuch a Diſlike of the Match, That he rejected King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Propoſal with ſome Indecencies, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed him an Interview at <hi>York,</hi> tho' he had given his Word to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0554400100:49"/>
meet him there—; This King <hi>Henry</hi> ſo reſented, That a War immediately followed, (as upon a Defeat of an Union has gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally happened) in which War, the <hi>Scots</hi> Nobility were ſo ſenſible of the wrong Meaſures of their Prince, and the Advantages to their Country, which he had raſhly rejected, That they followed him very unwillingly, and at laſt wholly abandoned him at <hi>Solan-Moſs,</hi> Declaring, They thought it was not their Duty to ruine their Country, to gratifie the Paſſion of their Deluded Monarch, and the Blinded Fury of the Clergy: This coſt King <hi>James</hi> his Life, who died of Grief, as <hi>Buchanan</hi> relates, <hi>Rerum Scoticarum, Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>Fol.</hi> 76.</p>
            <p>Its true, had this Match gone forward, it had not had the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned Effect, at leaſt not immediately, becauſe King <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. afterwards had a Son born, who ſucceeded to the Crown <hi>(viz.) Edward</hi> the VI—; But this is not to the preſent Caſe, the Deſign was the ſame, nor did it die with the reſpective Kings—; Nay, after the Birth of the Young Prince, King <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. made a ſecond Propoſal of an Union, <hi>viz.</hi> Of a Match between his Son <hi>Edward,</hi> and the Daughter of the late King of <hi>Scots;</hi> And this went ſo far, as to be Approved in the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as may be ſeen in the Regiſters of that Time; But this was again interrupted, as the former had been, by the Death of King <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. who left the Crown to his Son <hi>Edward</hi> the VI.</p>
            <p>In this Reign, the Project of Uniting the Kingdoms revived im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Council ſaw clearly the Advantages ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruing to both Nations by an Union, and could not ſlip that Happy Juncture: Their King was a Child not above Nine Years of Age, the Queen of <hi>Scotland</hi> was the like, left by her Father at Five Days old, and Crowned in her Cradle: The Regency of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Council of Governours of the Young King, revive the Treaty, and propoſe a Match between the King of <hi>England</hi> and the Queen of <hi>Scotland</hi>—, and built it upon the late Agreement made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween King <hi>Henry</hi> and the Parliament of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>French</hi> and Popiſh Party, who, as I have noted already, oppoſed Uniting the Kingdoms before, on the pretence of the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, had now much more Reaſon to do ſo; Since King <hi>Edward</hi> had declared himſelf, <hi>as they eſteemed it,</hi> an Heretick, had diſowned the Pope, and had erected a Proteſtant Church on the Ruine of the <hi>Romiſh;</hi> And on theſe Arguments they rejected the Propoſal, and broke their former Agreement.</p>
            <p>And here happened, <hi>what I have all along obſerved to be the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of breaking up a Treaty between the Two Nations, viz.</hi> A Bloody War, like as certainly muſt have happened again, had not this laſt Happy Treaty interveened, of which I am to Diſcourſe, in theſe Sheets.</p>
            <p>It is not my Buſineſs to enter upon the Particulars of the War on this Occaſion, but two Things it will be neceſſary to obſerve, 1<hi>ſt,</hi> That this War iſſued in the Defeat of the <hi>Scots</hi> Popiſh Army at the Battel at <hi>Pinkie,</hi> after which it was expected the Young Queen ſhould have been delivered to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and Marryed to their King:
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0554400100:50"/>
And truly, if the Frank and Generous Offer of the Conquerors had been in the leaſt regarded, it had been ſo, who, after the Victory made no Spoil or Havock in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but, as Friends, made a Fair De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of their <hi>(the Scots)</hi> Queen to be Married to their <hi>(the Engliſh)</hi> King, That ſo the Nations being United, might for ever remain One—; And this is to be ſeen in that Famous Declaration of the Duke of <hi>Somerſet</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> General, which, as it is in a Stile peculiar, and not uſual in the World among Conquerors, I could not omit, and is in the <hi>Appendix, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>But, 1. It was in Vain to Talk Reaſon to a People reſolved; The Popiſh Party, who ſaw evidently the Ruine of their Church, and the <hi>French,</hi> who ſaw the Deſtruction of their Ancient League wrapt up in the projected Union of the Kingdoms, fruſtrated all the Deſign, by Conveying the Young Princeſs into <hi>France;</hi> And ſo this Scheme came alſo to nothing.</p>
            <p>This had ſeveral bad Effects, which <hi>Scotland</hi> afterwards Regret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That it delayed the Reformation in <hi>Scotland</hi> for near Thirty Years after that in <hi>England,</hi> and made it both Difficult, Bloody, Tedious, and for a long Time Imperfect, of which I have Treated elſewhere. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It brought her under a <hi>French</hi> Yoke, and for a long Time ſhe Groaned under the Tyranny of <hi>French</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, till the Nation threw off Tyranny and Popery together, and Reformation came on Hand in Hand with Liberty.</p>
            <p>And now the Notion of Union between the Two Kingdoms be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to wear out, as a Thing, That, <hi>tho' both Nations had Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on enough to engage in,</hi> yet there was no Juncture to make it Feaſible, till the Death of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who dying without Iſſue, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Crown devolved upon the <hi>Scots</hi> Line; And this produced <hi>a kind of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> I mean an Union of the Crowns, but not an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Kingdoms; Of the Imperfection, Deficiency and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of which to both Kingdoms, I ſhall make ſome brief Obſervations, as they have been the Motives to the frequent At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts for a more near Conjunction in the ſucceeding Times.</p>
            <p>The Inconveniencies to <hi>Scotland</hi> in this partial Union were, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Their removing their Court to <hi>England,</hi> their King, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Prophetick Saying of <hi>Henry</hi> the VII, removing his Seat of Government from the leſs to the greater—; This was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally attended with the Decay of Trade in <hi>Scotland,</hi> by removing the Concourſe of Strangers from <hi>Scotland,</hi> whoſe Conſumption of Proviſions and Manufactures, which are the Foundation of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, was a great Loſs to Trade—; With the Exporting their ready Money out of the Kingdom, by the conſtant Attendance of their Gentry and Nobility at the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court, where they ſpent their Eſtates, and ſuck'd out the Blood of their Country, to ſupport their Luxury and Magnificence—; With the continued empty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Nation of their People, who all flocked to <hi>England,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for publick or private Employment, and Depopulated, as well as Impoveriſhed, their Native Country; <hi>But above all,</hi> the bringing <hi>Scotland</hi> under <hi>Engliſh</hi> Influence, both as to Civil and Religious
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0554400100:51"/>
Government, was a manifeſt Token of the Deficiency of this partial Union; For <hi>Scotland</hi> was after this, in a Political Senſe, tho' not in a Legal Senſe, always under the Management of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court: It had the Subjection without the Advantages—; Her Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were preſs'd into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Service as Subjects, yet, at the ſame time, excluded the Merchants Service as Foreigners, an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship Sailed with above one Third <hi>Scots</hi> Men would be ſeized, as not being Sailed by <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men, and the Colonies of <hi>England</hi> were at laſt all barred from them, as much as from the <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Dutch;</hi> It would be too long a Digreſſion, to recite here the various Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies <hi>Scotland</hi> laboured under, from the Deficiency of this partial, or meerly Regal Union, and which made all the Well-Wiſhers to <hi>Scotland</hi> deſire, either that there were a more intire Union, or that there were no Union at all—</p>
            <p>Nor was this unforeſeen by either Nation, and therefore, no ſooner was King <hi>James</hi> the VI. of <hi>Scotland</hi> come to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> but he began (before he had learn'd quite to forget his own Country) to project a more near Union of the Nations, as the only way to make them both compleatly Happy; This was in the Year 1604—, when, <hi>after ſeveral Projects of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niting by his own Abſolute Authority, a Thing then newly taken up in the World,</hi> finding all other Methods fail, he propoſed it to the Parliament of <hi>England, That,</hi> to uſe his own Words, <hi>as they were made One in the Head, they might be inſeparably Conjoined, and all Memory of paſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions be Extinguiſhed;</hi> At the ſame time he propoſed it in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and both Nations were ſo ſenſible of the mutual Advantages of Union, That they readily agreed to it, and Commiſſioners were appointed on both Sides to Treat. The Names of the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were as follows,<list>

            <p>We do not find among our Authors any particular of the Debates of theſe Commiſſioners: <hi>Spotſwood</hi> in his Hiſtory <hi>Fol.</hi> 481. gives in a Draught of the Articles they agreed on, which for want of Room I only refer the Reader to, but having obtained from good hands, a Manuſcript of Sir <hi>George Mackenzies,</hi> being a little like a Journal of their Proceedings, I could not but think it very much to the purpoſe, to inſert it in the Appendix to this Work, where may be ſeen the true Ground Plat of the preſent Union, and the Intereſt of both Kingdoms, clearly ſtated—as it ſtood then, and ſaving in matters of Religion remains ſtill, ſee Appendix <hi>N</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>Theſe Articles thus mutually agreed, were Engroſſed and Signed by the Commiſſioners on both Sides, and preſented to the King the 6<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>December</hi> 1604—; But it was obſerved. That the Earl of <hi>Saliſburry</hi> at the preſenting the Draught to the King, expreſſed it to be the meaning of the Commiſſioners, That theſe Articles were but an imperfect Agreement, and that they were willing to finiſh and go through the ſame when ever he pleaſed.</p>
            <p>However, the King offered it to the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> and as <hi>Spotſwood</hi> ſays, Recommended it Earneſtly to them; But the more ſecret Hiſtory of that Affair, was, That the King himſelf fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in at that Time with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Clergy, and Oppoſing the Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of his own Countrey, upon the Score of Religion and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Will, found Ways and Means to puzzle this Cauſe in Parliament; and <hi>Firſt,</hi> The difficulty of the <hi>Poſt-Nati, a Thing, which had the</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh <hi>at that Time purpoſed a Hearty <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> would never have ſtuck with them, occaſioned long Struggle, and at laſt the Parliament referr'd it to the Common Law; While this was doing, the National Averſion, particularly in <hi>England,</hi> ſeemed to revive, and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0554400100:53"/>
Appearances in <hi>England</hi> of a Spirit of Diviſion, were ſuch, <hi>as one obſerves,</hi> That very well diſcover'd the King was become <hi>on Engliſh Man,</hi> otherwiſe he would never have born with thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives and Railings at <hi>Scotland,</hi> which Sir <hi>Thomas Craig</hi> in his Book <hi>De <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nione Regnorum,</hi> ſays, were then publickly uſed in the Pulpits and in Printed Books, while their King was a <hi>Scotſman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor was this all, but the King in ſtead of forwarding the Union of the two Kingdoms, or promoting the particular Advantage of <hi>Scotland,</hi> fell in with the arbitrary Projects of that Time, to make himſelf Abſolute in <hi>Scotland</hi>—, as he was alſo doing in <hi>England.</hi> This would lead me into a vaſt Ocean of National Confuſions, which received their Riſe and Conception in the Tyrannical Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of this Prince, in which he laid the Foundation of the Ruine of his Poſterity, which as remote to my preſent Buſineſs, purpoſely I Omit.</p>
            <p>Asto Union, nothing further was done till the year 1660—, and till that Time, which was about 56 years, the Subjects of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> enjoyed a Freedom of Commerce in Common with the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> to all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonies; But then ſome Acts in <hi>England</hi> paſſing in prejudice of that Freedom of Commerce, the <hi>Scots</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed their Complaints, and a Commiſſion ſays, Sir <hi>George Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenzie</hi> was granted in the 3<hi>d.</hi> Seſſion of the firſt Parliament of <hi>Charles</hi> 2<hi>d.</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and by an Act at the ſame time in <hi>England,</hi> Nominating Commiſſioners to Adjuſt theſe Differences; This was in 1666.</p>
            <p>Theſe Commiſſioners met the 21<hi>ſt. January</hi> 1667, and the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners gave in a Propoſal to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for ſettling the Differences about Trade, which Paper I have alſo given you from an Original Manuſcript of the ſaid Sir <hi>George Mackenzie,</hi> and which you will find in the Appendix N<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> 13.</p>
            <p>The Debates which followed this Paper, ſays <hi>Sir George,</hi> ſerved only to ſhew the King the Neceſſity of Commencing a further Treaty, <hi>viz.</hi> Of a Union, and how Ineffectual all other Treaties would be to bring about the publick Peace of the two Nations.</p>
            <p>To this End, a Parliament being called in <hi>Scotland</hi> the 19<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>October</hi> 1667, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament meeting the ſame Day, he cauſed the great Affair of an Union to be propoſed to both at the ſame time; The Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by their Letter to the King, expreſſed their Readineſs to concur with the Popoſal; And that they would grant Commiſſion to ſuch, as His Majeſty ſhould Nominate for that Purpoſe, to Treat as their Repreſentatives; And left it to the King to Name the Time, Place, and <hi>Quorum</hi> of their Meetings—; This being the Subſtance of the Letter, I have omitted the Letter it ſelf, which is to be ſeen in the Regiſters in <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Parliament of <hi>England, by what Affairs obſtructed I ſhall not determine,</hi> did nothing in it that Seſſion, but reaſſumed it in 1670, and Impowered the King by an Act 22. <hi>Carol.</hi> 2. almoſt in the Terms the <hi>Scots</hi> had done before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0554400100:54"/>
The Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> purſuant to this, granted a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for a Treaty, which was almoſt <hi>Verbatim</hi> the ſame with that granted in <hi>England;</hi> that no Debates might ariſe between the Commiſſioners of both Kingdoms, about the Difference of their Commiſſions, as had fallen out in the year 1604.</p>
            <p>And becauſe I ſhall endeavour to relate Matter of Fact, Abſtracted from my own Obſervations in this Hiſtory, I have with ſome Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, obtained an Original Manuſcript of the Minutes of this ſhort Treaty—; Which are as follows.</p>

            <p>Any one that peruſes this ſhort Treaty, or rather Conference, may ſee, That theſe Times were not Tempered for an Effectual Union; And thoſe that know any Thing of the Secret Hiſtory of that Day, will alſo know, there were private Deſigns then on Foot, which made a nearer Union, inconſiſtent with the Views of the Court.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> inſiſted on a Conjunction of Parliaments, not an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation of Foundations, <hi>as has now been propoſed; England</hi> durſt never hear of ſuch a Conjunction of Parliaments, on Account of Church Matters; Knowing, That, tho' Epiſcopacy was then Eſtabliſhed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> yet, that the Secret Bent of that Nation was Presbyterian; and they durſt not think of a Conjunction of Houſes on that Score.</p>
            <p>And here I would ask leave of the Gentlemen in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who have Oppoſed the preſent Union, in regard of its Hazard to the Presbyterian Church, <hi>to Re-mind them,</hi> what reaſon they have to look back to the Days of this Treaty, <hi>and be Thankful,</hi> That the Union was not Compaſſed at this Time; and to conſider why they ſhould have ventured putting it off to a further Time, ſince, had it happned in that Time, when Epiſcopacy had the Face of a legal Eſtabliſhment in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Presbyterian Church had for ever ſunk under its Weight, and been Exploded by the Laws of both Kingdoms; both Kingdoms had been obliged to keep it down, and it could never, <hi>Miracles excepted,</hi> have recovered it ſelf in that Nation.</p>
            <p>And thus I have Traced the ſeveral Endeavours to Unite theſe Kingdoms in former Times, in which I have been as Brief as I can: I ſhall conclude this with only one Remark, which I believe will appear to be juſt; Thro' the whole Courſe of the ſeveral Treaties hitherto named, the firſt excepted, which was diſappointed by a meer Judgment from Heaven, <hi>I mean the Death of the Maid of</hi> Norway; All the reſt of the Propoſals for Union between theſe Kingdoms, met with their particular Obſtructions from Popery, <hi>French-</hi>Intereſt, Home-Tyranny or Court-Intrigues; Theſe were
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0554400100:64"/>
the only Enemies of Union, and I believe it may, without Partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity be added, <hi>AND SO IT IS NOW:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are now come to the preſent Times, King <hi>James</hi> the II: in <hi>England,</hi> or VII. in <hi>Scotland,</hi> had no other Union in View, but that of Uniting all his Kingdoms, to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and this put him upon Meaſures perfectly diſtinct from all that had gone before him, from whence we have had Two Famous <hi>Revolutions</hi> in <hi>Britain,</hi> one in the Regal State of both Kingdoms, the other in the Eccleſiaſtick State of <hi>Scotland,</hi> from Epiſcopal to Presbyterian:—This was no ſooner brought to paſs, but <hi>Scotland</hi> put the King in mind of their Deſires to Unite, in their Letter to King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam;</hi> Of which preſently—. But all that Prince's Reign, this good Deſign met with Obſtructions, of which I ſhall be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing particular in its place. And thus we are brought down to Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> in whoſe Reign this great Work was once Attempted, but proved Abortive, and at the ſecond Eſſay was brought to Perfection, as will be ſeen in the Sequel of this Story.</p>

            <head>OF AFFAIRS IN BOTH KINGDOMS, INTRODUCTORY OF A TREATY of UNION.</head>
            <p>BEFORE I enter upon the Proceedings in the Reign of Queen <hi>ANNE,</hi> towards a General Union of theſe Kingdoms, it is abſolutely neceſſary to the right Underſtanding of Things, to take a ſhort View of the Poſture of Publick Affairs in the reſpective Kingdoms, and what it was that rendred the Union ſo abſolutely Neceſſary at this Time, that to all Conſidering People, who made any tolerable Judgment of Things, it was plain, there was no other way left, to prevent the moſt Bloody War that ever had been between the two Nations.</p>
            <p>At the Revolution, as has been already Noted, and ſeveral times during the Reign of the late King <hi>William,</hi> Motions had been made frequently both on the King's Side and on the Peoples alſo, to come to a Treaty; But that Prince had always one Thing or other caſt in his Way, to prevent his good Deſign.</p>
            <p>The King was often heard to ſay, That this Iſland could never be Eaſie without a Union, and if either of them underſtood their own Happineſs, they would never reſt till it was brought to paſs. And, as I had the Honour to mention it once among other Things, in a Scheme of General Peace among the Proteſtant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts in <hi>Europe, I can not forget,</hi> That His Majeſty Expreſſing ſome Concern at it, Returned, <hi>I have done all I can in that Affair, but I do not ſee a Temper in either Nation that looks like it</hi>—; And added, after ſome other Diſcourſe, <hi>It may be done, but not yet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0554400100:66"/>
During the whole Reign of this Prince, the Breaches between the two Kingdoms rather Widened and Increaſed, than tended to a Cloſe, and ſeveral National Unkindneſſes paſt between them, which prepared both Sides as it were to Reflect upon, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the other; There wanted not alſo a Set of wicked Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments always to blow the Coals of Diſcord between the Kingdoms into a Flame, and if poſſible, to bring the Nations to a Rupture.</p>
            <p>Some of theſe Paſſages which, I ſay, tended to Eſtrange the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and as it were prepare them for a Breach, rather than for an Union, were theſe,<list>
                  <item>The ſettling an <hi>African</hi> or <hi>Indian</hi> Company in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the ſeveral Claſhings of Intereſt between the two Nations on that Head.</item>
                  <item>The Affairs of <hi>Glenco.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>The Difficulties about the Succeſſion and Limitations.</item>
                  <item>The Act of Security there.</item>
                  <item>The Act in <hi>England</hi> Intituled, <hi>An Act for preventing Dangers ariſing from the Act of Security in</hi> Scotland.</item>
                  <item>The Seizing the Ship the <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and Execution of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Green,</hi> and ſeveral others—.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>All theſe Things concurred, to convince thoſe that had the leaſt Knowledge of Affairs in both Kingdoms, that nothing but an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could prevent the Nations falling all to pieces, as ſoon as ever the Queen ſhould Die, if not ſooner; and that therefore it was immediately and heartily to be ſet about, as the only way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the publick Tranquillity, and prevent the certain Miſchiefs that threatned the whole Body.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not enter into a particular Hiſtory of theſe ſeveral Caſes, as being too tedious for this Tract, but as 'tis neceſſary to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of them, to convey the right Underſtanding of theſe Matters to Poſterity, and that more regularly to introduce the General Thing I am upon, <hi>viz.</hi> The Union, I cannot wholly Omit them.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Firſt, For the African Company,</hi> the large Commiſſion that Company obtained, by which they ſeem'd to Rival the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> both in their <hi>Guinea, Eaſt-India,</hi> and <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Trade, was ill reliſh'd by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who at that Time were in an Odd and Unſettled Poſture, as to thoſe Trades at Home. And as this is not rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by a great many, that run round about for Reaſons of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament's falling upon that Affair, it may not be a miſs to ſet it in a clearer Light.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh East India</hi> Trade, being for a long time Preſcrib'd in the narrow Limits of an excluſive Company, who Tyrannized not a little in their abſolute Management of that Trade, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Grievous to the reſt of the Merchants, many Attempts were made to lay open their Stock, and Increaſe ſo great, and ſo Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial a Trade; But the Company withſtood all the Attempts that way, and kept all Invaders off; till at laſt by the mighty Advance of Two Millions to the Government, the New <hi>Eaſt-Indian</hi> Company got a Charter, and ſet up againſt them—; How they Rival'd
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0554400100:67"/>
one another, and with mighty Struggles, too much Embarraſſed the whole Nation; till the King himſelf was obliged to concern himſelf in Uniting them, and how he brought that great Work to paſs, are Things not ſo much to my preſent purpoſe; But at this time, <hi>viz.</hi> 26 <hi>June</hi> 1695, the <hi>Scots</hi> Company obtained their Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>What ever Proſpects the Projectors of that Company had in their View, ſome of which will, <hi>I doubt,</hi> hardly bear a Hiſtory, I never heard one of them pretend, That either the Stock to carry it on, or the Market for their Trade, could be found in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and from hence, with other particular Objections, which I believe they never Debated, I pretend to ſay, They could never really pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any rational probability of Succeſs.</p>
            <p>If they imagined to obtain Help from Abroad, they indeed were in the right, for they could not but know, That the Merchants in <hi>England</hi> would leap at a Propoſal to get into the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade, free from the Bondage of the Company mentioned before—; But if they imagined alſo, That this could do leſs than Embark the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government againſt them, and bring the Publick to concern themſelves about it, they were exceeding Short-ſighted, or muſt at the ſame Time believe, the other very Ignorant in the Affairs before them.</p>
            <p>The firſt Step the Company took, was to open Books for Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions at <hi>London,</hi> and afterwards at <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> and this was no ſooner done, but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company took the Alarm at both; and obtained by their Intereſt with the Government, Inſtructions to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Reſident at <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> to Oppoſe it there, which was done moſt effectually. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Reſident, as it was ſaid, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely Threatning the <hi>Hamburghers,</hi> That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould remove their Staple of Cloth to the City of <hi>Bremen,</hi> and ruine the Trade of <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> whether he did actually Threaten them ſo or no, I do not Affirm, but 'tis certain, he ſo managed Affairs, that the Subſcriptions begun there, were ſtopt, and the Deſign on that Side effectually ruined; Then they, <hi>I mean the</hi> Engliſh Eaſt-India <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,</hi> Applyed themſelves to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament, and by offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plauſible Reaſons there, ſoon obtained their Votes againſt it alſo, and againſt any of the Subjects of <hi>England</hi> Subſcribing to it, and the <hi>Scots</hi> Merchants who had ſubſcribed in <hi>England,</hi> were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be Impeacht of a Miſdemeanour, tho' the Parliament being near a Cloſe, thoſe Impeachments dropt of courſe.</p>
            <p>Theſe things had the deſired Effect, for they cruſhed the Attempt of raiſing a <hi>New</hi> Eaſt-India <hi>Company</hi> in theſe Parts of the World, and the Projectors then played their other Game of <hi>Darien,</hi> in which they had the ſame Unhappineſs, <hi>viz.</hi> To put the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under a Neceſſity of Oppoſing them.</p>
            <p>I do readily allow, the firſt Scheme of a Trade to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> had a Probability of Succeſs in it, a Thing I can not grant to the Affair of <hi>Darien;</hi> which, I think, had not one Branch belonging to its Contrivance, but what was Big with neceſſary Abortions,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0554400100:68"/>
ſuch as remote Mines of Gold to be gained and maintained by Force againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> in which <hi>England</hi> could not without Breach of Faith aſſiſt, ſuch as a Trade for <hi>European</hi> Goods with the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Colonies, which muſt always have been by Force or by Stealth, and neither of theſe had any Rational Probability.</p>
            <p>As to their Trade over Land to the South Seas, and thence to the <hi>Indies,</hi> tho' much boaſted of, it anſwers for it ſelf, and ſeems a too Impracticable Whimſy to merit any Reply, much like that other Dream of making a Navigation, or Communication between the South Seas and the Gulph of <hi>Mexico,</hi> by the River of <hi>Darien</hi>—; Which, if all were done, and the Diſtance meaſured to that Part of <hi>India,</hi> to which we chiefly Trade, <hi>viz.</hi> The Coaſt of <hi>Coromondel, Surrat,</hi> Bay of <hi>Bengal, &amp;c.</hi> I think any Body will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the Voyage by the <hi>Cape de Bon Eſperance,</hi> the better Paſſage by much, and very little if any thing longer.</p>
            <p>But to come to the Caſe, the Company, or rather the Projectors, who had now embark'd the Gentlemen in a Subſcription of 400000 Pounds <hi>Sterling,</hi> carried on their Deſign, and with Two Ships.</p>
            <p>Men and a Cargo perfectly unqualified for any kind of Trade, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſet Sail, and landing at <hi>Darien,</hi> made a Settlement there, fortified themſelves, and prepared to maintain it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who claim a Right there, and whether that Right be diſputeable or no, is not the Queſtion here, immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed by a double Method, firſt, To prepare to diſlodge them by Force, and ſecondly, Apply themſelves to the King of <hi>England,</hi> claiming, <hi>by virtue of the Treaty made with</hi> England, <hi>Ratified and Exchanged,</hi> That no Succour ſhould be given to the <hi>Scots</hi> from any of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonies in <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, as an expreſs Stipulation, could not be denyed by the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Court, and accordingly a Proclamation was exhibited by the King of <hi>England,</hi> and ſent to all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations, forbidding Trade or Correſpondence with them.</p>
            <p>I cannot help ſaying, had the Managers of the Companies Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs had the leaſt Forecaſt of Things, they could not but have expected all that happened here; And alſo might have known, That, had they Acted right, thoſe Proclamations could have done them no manner of Damage.</p>
            <p>Whover has the leaſt Knowledge of the Affairs of that Country, and of the Trade of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonies, muſt needs know, That, had the <hi>Scots</hi> Company, who had plac'd themſelves at <hi>Darien,</hi> been furniſh'd either with Money, or Letters of Credit, they had never wanted Proviſions, or come to any other Diſaſter, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Proclamations of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> againſt Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>Nor will any Man be ſo vain to ſay, That they ought to have ventured on ſuch a Settlement, depending on Supplies from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> eſpecially when, in their Affairs of <hi>Hamburgh</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> which were before all this, they had ſeen the <hi>Engliſh</hi> concerning
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0554400100:69"/>
themſelves againſt their Company; Much leſs ſhould they have gone to Plant themſelves in a Climate unfit for Product it ſelf, with neither Caſh, nor Credit, to Buy in other Places.</p>
            <p>At laſt 'tis apparent, That, notwithſtanding the Proclamations, and after all the Officious Care of the Governours of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonies, yet ſeveral Sloops of Proviſions came to them, but found them on the other Hand unfurniſh'd to purchaſe, except with ſuch Goods as were fit for no Market, nor could they give Bills any where to make Good the Value.</p>
            <p>The Trade to the <hi>Spaniſh Weſt-Indies</hi> is forbidden in thoſe Parts, under the ſevereſt Penalties of Loſs of Goods, Confiſcation of the Ship, and Death of the People; And yet we ſee, That, at <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica</hi> for the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and <hi>Curaſoe</hi> for the <hi>Dutch,</hi> they carry on a prodigious Trade encouraged by the Gain of it.</p>
            <p>Had the <hi>Scots</hi> at <hi>Darien</hi> had any thing ſufficient to encoutage the Traders thither, they had never wanted Proviſions; And as they were unprovided that way, they muſt have ſtarved, had there been no Prohibitions at all, for they would have found few of the Planters, or Merchants of the Colonies, inclined to have furniſh'd them without Money.</p>
            <p>This I think clears up the Caſe ſufficiently, and therefore I ſhall ſay no more to it here; 'Tis thus far to the preſent Purpoſe, <hi>That,</hi> This Diſaſter of the <hi>Scots, be the Fault where it will,</hi> was one of the great Occaſions of Ill Blood between the Nations, while thoſe that took all Opportunities to widen our Breaches on both Sides, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually cryed out in <hi>England,</hi> That the <hi>Scots</hi> were encroaching upon our Trade, and ſetting up a New <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade—; And, on the other Hand, in <hi>Scotland,</hi> they complained of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural and Barbarous Treatment of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>—; Both which took with the Common People of either Nations, to the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Diſquieting of their Minds, and raiſing continual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches againſt one another, without giving themſelves leave to enquire into the Grounds and Reaſons of Things.</p>
            <p>I have been the larger on this Head, becauſe I think this to be the firſt Handle that our Quarrelſome People took Hold of to Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject againſt one another, and on which the future Jealouſies between the Nations were pretended to be built.</p>
            <p>The Affair of <hi>Glenco</hi> was another Step to National Breaches; And tho' every Body tells me, I muſt handle this very gently, perhaps they may ſee, there is not ſo much Cauſe for it, as they imagine.</p>
            <p>And having the Honour to have had ſomething of this from Perſons very near the King, and perhaps from His Majeſties own Mouth; I ſhall only ſtate the General ſo far as it has been report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Injury of that Glorious Prince, and to the exciting Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Animoſities between us.</p>
            <p>In doing this, I ſhall only avoid Naming of Perſons, let the Guilt dye in their Graves, we are not now calling up the Perſons to Judgment, but ſetting the Matter in a clear Light.</p>

That the <hi>Glenco-men</hi> among ſeveral other <hi>Clans</hi> of the <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> were Enemies to the Government at that time, had been in Arms under <hi>Dundee,</hi> and had on all occaſions ſhown their impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Averſion to King <hi>William,</hi> and all the Intereſt of the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, needs no Proof, and is own'd even by the greateſt Friends to the Cauſe.</p>
            <p>That theſe People were not only very troubleſome, bu tdange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and had committed ſeveral Hoſtilities, Murders, Robberies and Depredations, on both the Innocent Country People their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, as well as on the Garriſons of Souldiers plac'd on that ſide to ſuppreſs them, is alſo out of diſpute.</p>
            <p>The Defence made for this is ſhort, That they were fair Enemies and had profeſſ't open War.</p>
            <p>It is Anſwered thus, That <list>
                  <item>1. They cannot be own'd as open Enemies, becauſe they really had no Commiſſions from King <hi>James.</hi> And 2<hi>ly,</hi> The War was as it were ſuppreſt; the Generality had laid down their Arms, and ſubmitted; and theſe as a few Deſperado's kept up the Quarrel rather as an advantage of Rapine and Plunder, than a Service to their pretended Maſter, or his Cauſe.</item>
                  <item>2. Suppoſe them at open War, It has been the known Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in War, when a Governour of a Garriſon holds out with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Expectation of Relief, without any proſpect but meer Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration and Miſchief, to give ſuch no Quarter; no Conditions at all, but even after taking the Place to hang them up in cold Blood, as wild Beaſts, that make no fair War, and deſerve no fair Treatment.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>As His Majeſty had this Account given him of theſe People, and I do not find but it was a true Account too, it was the Advice of the General and Officers imployed at that time, that it was a Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief which as Times then went might be very dangerous to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; &amp; that therefore it behoved them to take ſome immediate Courſe with them; And ſince deſperate Miſchiefs require Remedies of the ſame kind, they thought the firſt Force the beſt, and propoſed to march immediately with a Body of Troops into the Place, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely root them out as a Den of Thieves and Deſtroyers, without which the peaceable Subjects could never be ſafe, nor the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be eaſie; That the Charge of maintaining Troops there, was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable Burden to the Countrey, and as there was no other way could prevail to preſerve the Peace, it was abſolutely neceſſary to come to Extremity.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty, who by his Experience in Military Affairs, was ſoon convinc'd both of the Juſtice in Point of War, &amp; Neceſſity in Point of Government of this Advice; yet out of His meer Goodneſs of Diſpoſition &amp; general Clemency, anſwered, <hi>He agreed to their Reaſons,</hi> but requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that before any ſuch Extremities ſhould be uſed with them, a Proclamation ſhould be publiſhed, offering Pardon, or Remiſſion for all Violences, and Villanies paſt, to all theſe People without Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who within a certain time ſhould come in, lay down their
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0554400100:71"/>
Arms, and ſubmit to the Government, and take the Oaths as peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Subjects.</p>
            <p>'Tis here viſible that His Majeſties Intentions were not only Juſt and Honourable to theſe People, <hi>tho his implacable Enemies,</hi> but that he reſolved like a merciful Prince, to try all reaſonable Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Tenderneſs, and Goodneſs, if poſſible, to keep the Peace, and ſave the Offenders too.</p>
            <p>With this Proclamation, Commiſſion was given to the Military Power, if this merciful Method could not prevail, they ſhould proceed to Extremities; and by Force of Arms deſtroy all thoſe that ſhould ſtand out, and not comply with the Proclamation. And His Majeſties Orders were, as far as relates to this part, as follows.</p>
            <p>The Inſtructions were to Sir <hi>Thomas Livingstoun,</hi> dated <hi>Jan.</hi> 11. 1692. the firſt Clauſe is thus,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You are hereby Ordered and Authorized to march our Troops which are now posted at</hi> Innerlochie <hi>and</hi> Innerneſs <hi>to act againſt thoſe Highland Rebels who have not taken the benefite of Our Indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, by Fire and Sword, and all manner of Hostilities, to burn their Houſes, ſeize or deſtroy their Goods, Cattel, Pleniſhing or Clothes, and to cut off the Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Fourth Article runs thus,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Rebels may not think themſelves abſolutely deſperate, we allow you to give Terms and Quarters, but we are ſo convinc'd of the Neceſſity of Severity, and that they cannot be reclaim'd, that we will not allow you to give any other Terms to Chiftains, Heretors, or Leaders, but to be Priſoners of War, whereby their Lives are ſaved; but for all other things they muſt ſurrender on Mercy, and take the Oath of Alledgeance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Additional Inſtructions, one Clauſe is thus dated 16 <hi>Jan.</hi> 1692.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If that</hi> Mackean <hi>of</hi> Glenco <hi>and his Tribe can be well ſeparated from the rest, it will be a proper Vindication of the publick justice to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate that Sect of Thieves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus far I think I may undertake to ſay His Majeſty proceeded, by the known Cuſtom of all the moſt juſt Governments in the World, and it would be needleſs to Examine Hiſtories to bring Precedents here to juſtifie the Method.</p>
            <p>It is certain, and all Men allow that the <hi>Glenco-men</hi> had not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed with the Proclamation; Nay they had rejected two Indemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>I know 'tis objected, that <hi>Glenco</hi> came and took the Oath ſix days after the time, made a legal and juſt Excuſe, and ſent word of his willingneſs to comply with it, and that it was only a Treſpaſs of Time, which they ſuppoſed he had repaired, that the end of the Proclamation was anſwered, and that the King who was mercifully inclin'd, would never have taken the Lives of People reſolved to ſubmit for a Treſpaſs of days.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, as His Majeſty himſelf did in that Caſe, that indeed had he been in the Field, and on the Spot, and that Excuſe had been ſent to him, he might have accepted it—, But that as
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0554400100:72"/>
Commiſſions in Caſes of War, are to be punctually Executed, he could not require it of the Officers to accept it, as an Excuſe againſt a poſitive Proclamation, and an expreſs Order; Beſides, I do not find any, but the Chief had gone thus far, the reſt not having come in at all.</p>
            <p>It is alledged, That the Execution was from private Malice—; but none could ever yet have the Face to charge His Majeſty with that, and I could never hear of any Reaſon given why the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of the Forces ſhould have any, much leſs thoſe at whom the Scandal of it was pointed, upon pretence of giving Unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable Orders.</p>
            <p>But the Caſe chiefly lyes here, the Men fell under the Misfortune of a Criſis in War, they brought themſelves into it by an Omiſſion of Time, to ſay, They could not avoid it, does not reach the Caſe, if the Officers can be charged with any private Revenge in this Caſe, I have only this to ſay.<list>
                  <item>1. I never yet ſaw any Reaſon to think ſo, no Perſonal Grudge or Quarrel ever appeared, that I ever met with, or was ſo much as—, alledged in it, or Gain pretended to be made by it, if the E. of <hi>B.</hi>—had any private Game, it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affected the King, nor the other Perſons Charged with the Thing.</item>
                  <item>2. If it were ſo, it no way affects the King, againſt whom the Reproach of this Affair is ſince pointed, who acted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what was agreeable to the Laws of War, and mixt it with that General Bleſſing of his Temper, an unuſual Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency.</item>

            </p>
            <p>If the Commiſſion given was Executed with Barbarity, and Blood, Killing People in what we call cold Blood, ſurprizing them in Peace, and Dependence on Safety, all this will turn upon the Merits of the firſt Cauſe; For if they were by the Laws of War to be Deſtroyed, all manner of Surprizes become Juſtified by the ſame Law: As to the Cruelties and Exceſſes of the Furious Soldiers, no Man can have the Face to Reproach His Majeſty with that.</p>
            <p>The Grand Queſtion remains yet behind, Why did not the King cauſe the Offenders to be made Examples, and ſeverely puniſh the Murderers.</p>
            <p>I ſhall Anſwer,<list>
                  <item>1. If His Majeſties Peculiar was too much Clemency, I think ſome of thoſe that make loudeſt Exclamations on this Article ought to be ſilent, ſince, had Exemplar Juſtice been His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Employment from his firſt Landing, we ſhould have no Reaſon to have ſaid, It was a Bloodleſs Revolution, nor they perhaps have been alive to Complain.</item>
                  <item>2. For the Reaſons aforeſaid, His Majeſty often ſaid, it was <hi>a Moot-point</hi> in War, whether they had broke Orders or no, and tho' I have the Honour to know, that His Majeſty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly reſented the Manner, yet it did not appear at all, that they had laid themſelves open to Military Juſtice in it,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0554400100:73"/>
or ſo much as given ground to call them to account before a Council of War.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>As to National or Civil Juſtice, the Memory of the King can never be Reflected upon in that, unleſs ſome Perſons had purſued them at Law, obtained Sentence againſt them, and His Majeſty had Protected them from the Proſecution or Execution of ſuch Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences.</p>
            <p>Thus far, I think, the King himſelf is intirely clear of this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who elſe may have been Guilty, and how, either of breaking Orders, going beyond them on Niceties, and Executing them with Barbarities, I have no Occaſion to enter upon here; I ſhall be far from Defending ſuch Things, and I am ſure His Majeſty was far from Approving it.</p>
            <p>But this is more compleatly Anſwered, by putting the World in mind, That His Majeſty did refer the Proſecution of that Affair wholly to the Parliament, as more particularly appears by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments Addreſs of Thanks to His Majeſty for ſo doing.</p>
            <p>And that in their Proſecution, they found no room for legal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, except againſt the Officer who Executed the Orders in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſo Barbarous, which Officer fled from Juſtice, and was Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed for not Compearing.</p>
            <p>So that here was no legal Proceſs interrupted, but all was Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remitted by His Majeſty to the ſevereſt Methods of Juſtice, which if it would not reach the Perſons concerned, 'tis very hard the Slander ſhould reach the King.</p>
            <p>It might be ſaid here, You have no Occaſion to Defend the King's Memory in this Caſe, ſince the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> clear'd His Majeſty, by their Unanimous Vote of 14<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>June, viz.</hi> That His Majeſties Inſtructions contained no Warrant for the Execution of the <hi>Glenco</hi> Men.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only Note, That it is true the Parliament paſt ſuch a Vote, and 'tis as true, the King reſented very ill their Uſage of him, as he had great Reaſon to do, frequently repeating, That he Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> they had uſed him better than <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> had done his Grandfather, for they had Tryed him for his Life, and brought him in <hi>NOT G<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ILTY.</hi> I muſt confeſs, it was very Unaccountable the Houſe ſhould paſs ſuch a Vote upon their Sovereign, whom no Man had had the Impudence to owne a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon in the Caſe, tho' they did it Clandeſtinely; and it had much better have become them, to have Searched after, and Puniſhed thoſe that Slandered the King on that Account.</p>
            <p>But the Reproaching the King, and thoſe imployed by him, and who under him gave Orders in it, had its Party Uſes; what End it anſwered at that Time, is very well known, and would make a very good Hiſtory, to the Reproach of ſome Pretenders to Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Principles; But I chooſe to bury theſe Things in Silence, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they any part of this Deſign.</p>
            <p>I have Aſſign'd this as a ſecond Ground of National Animoſity, not that it was Acted by any of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, but as the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0554400100:74"/>
Gentlemen who improved it, turned it all againſt the King, it was ſtill furniſhing matter of Railry againſt the Revolution, and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, which both turned upon one Point, and was now ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported and puſht on in <hi>Scotland,</hi> by the Intereſt and Influence of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court.</p>
            <p>I have Digreſt upon the Subject on no other Ground, than to clear up the Reproaches which Envy would fain fix on the King and his Memory, which, I think, not at all accountable for it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The next General Head, on which our National Diſcontents have been Revived, and indeed which has been ſtrangely Iſſued, has been the Succeſſion of the Crown.</p>
            <p>This has a long Chain of Derivations to fetch it from, but I'll Contract them into as ſmall a Compaſs as I can.</p>
            <p>The Original of the whole Debate is to be placed, if we will do Juſtice, in His late Majeſties ſincere and conſtant Care for the Peace and Security of theſe Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>The King had ſeen the Proſpects of an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> fly like a remote Shadow, as it were out of Ken, and finding reaſon to lay aſide the Thoughts of that bleſſed Conjunction, he found the next Step needful was, to preſerve the Publick Peace, and hand down our Liberties to Poſterity, under the ſame Security he had ſo happily Fixt them in; in order to this, His Majeſty began to ſet himſelf ſeriouſly to Work, to ſettle the Succeſſion of the Crown in the Proteſtant Line.</p>
            <p>Before I enter into this large Field, I muſt take one Opportunity more to Exalt the Memory of the King, and put theſe Nations in mind of the Care that Prince took, abſtracted from his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, to ſettle both the Liberties and Religion of this Iſland, in ſpight of all the ill Treatment he met with here.</p>
            <p>Upon the Revolution, a great deal of Clamour and Reproach had been Level'd at the King, as if he purſued his own Intereſt in the taking the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> tho' I muſt acknowledge I am at a Loſs, to find out what he Gain'd by it, tho' I have had Opportunities to know ſomething of His Majeſties Affairs; But ſure, no Body could Charge His Majeſty with having an Eye to his Intereſt, in what ſhould happen after his Death; He could have nothing to propoſe to himſelf beyond the Grave; It could be of no Moment to him, who ſhould Enjoy the Crown after him, ſince he had no Children of his own, nor could he expect the Succeſſion ſhould come to any Branch of his Family.</p>
            <p>Covetouſneſs and Ambition may guide Princes in their Purſuit of Honours and Poſſeſſions, to themſelves and their Families, but when a Prince has no Family, no Relations that can Enjoy after him, it can not be Rational to talk of Ambition or Intereſt in that Caſe.</p>
            <p>His Majeſties Memory is therefore Untainted, and even the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of his Fame are Defeated <hi>here;</hi> for <hi>the very pretence fails them,</hi> his Anxiety for the Settlement of the Succeſſion, could ſavour of nothing but a meer Concern and Reſpect for the Intereſt, Safety,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0554400100:75"/>
and Liberty of the Countrey, and let any Man give any other ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Account of it, if he can; <hi>But this is by the way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In purſuit of this Original Deſign, His Majeſty laid the Ground-Plot of the Succeſſion to the Houſe of <hi>Hannover,</hi> went himſelf to <hi>Hannover,</hi> and thence to <hi>Zell,</hi> to Concert the Meaſures of it on that Side, Maſter'd ſome Difficulties there too, and then propoſed it to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament.</p>
            <p>How it paſſed in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, what Oppoſition was made to it <hi>there, and by whom,</hi> what ſubſequent Laws were made to ſtrengthen and ſupport it, is not much to the preſent Purpoſe to Examine, Hiſtories are full of the particular Circumſtances, and no Body that knows any thing of what paſt in thoſe Times, can be ignorant of it.</p>
            <p>It remained only to make the ſame Proviſion for <hi>Scotland;</hi> and the King began to turn his Eyes thither, when he was taken off by Death; And Queen <hi>ANNE</hi> Succeeded not to his Crown only, but to the ſame Care and Concern for the Publick Peace, and for the Settlement of the Nations, by ſecuring the Succeſſion of the Crown.</p>
            <p>But to look into <hi>Scotland</hi> a little, the <hi>Scots</hi> receiv'd the Propoſal of the Succeſſion, with more Coldneſs &amp; Diffidence than was expected; and the Heats occaſioned by the Debates on both Sides, were Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary; The Oppoſition made to the Continuation of their United State in a Succeſſor, had a ſpecious and moſt unanſwerable Pretence to be made for it, tho' it was made Uſe of by two ſorts of People, with a quite different Proſpect.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> had been very ſenſible of the viſible Decay of Trade, Wealth, and Inhabitants in their Country, even from the firſt giving away their Kings to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Succeſſion, and as the Sinking Condition of their Nation, was plainly owing to the Loſs of their Court, Concourſe of People, the Diſadvantages of Trade, and the Influence the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had over their Kings; So it was as plain, there was no way to Recover themſelves, but either better Terms of Union and Alliance, or a Returning back to their ſeparate Self-Exiſting State.</p>
            <p>The moſt Confidering and Diſintereſted People, Reflected back upon their Eaſie Complying with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and Joyning with the Revolution, without any Conditions made for themſelves with <hi>England</hi> as a Nation; <hi>And plainy ſaid,</hi> If they had demanded bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Terms, they might have had them, ſince their Joyning at that Time was a Thing of ſuch Conſequence, and upon which ſo much did Depend, that <hi>England</hi> could not have denied them, and what they had to ask was ſo reaſonable, that nothing in reaſon could have been objected.</p>
            <p>The People who were of this Opinion, being ſome of them at the ſame Time, as far from Embarking in the wrong Intereſt, Mov'd Strenuouſly for a Treaty with <hi>England,</hi> to aſcertain the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, <hi>Chiefly reſpecting Commerce,</hi> on which they were willing to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0554400100:76"/>
ſettle the Crown; but were Unanimouſly for refuſing to ſettle it at all, <hi>but with ſuch a Treaty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As theſe Gentlemen inſiſted upon a Treaty with <hi>England,</hi> in caſe they ſettled the Succeſſion with them, ſo they conſidered in the next place of Limitations, both in caſe of failing of ſuch Treaty, or in caſe of its being Concluded, in order to preſerve the Liberties of the People, and to Aſſert the Right and Power of Parliaments; And one of theſe Limitations was, That in caſe the Treaty did not ſucceed then in the ſettling the Crown, it was Provided, the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor ſhould not be King or Queen of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet I confeſs it ſeems plain to me, the Deſign of theſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was not againſt having the Succeſſion ſettled even in Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with <hi>England,</hi> as it now is, and their General Behaviour ſince, Confirms this Opinion, beſides the General Character of the Men themſelves, but their Deſign appeared plainly to bring <hi>England</hi> over to ſuch Terms in Matters of Commerce, as really it appeared <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> wanted, and as <hi>England</hi> ought to Grant.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, a Party Joyn'd in this, that were againſt any Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at all, that were againſt any Succeſſion but that of King <hi>James,</hi> and whoſe real Deſign was againſt the General Correſpondence of the Nations, and both Sides had People among them who made uſe of theſe Things, further and further to Divide the Nation.</p>
            <p>Nor did they fail of Succeſs, for this was taken very Hainouſly in <hi>England,</hi> eſpecially by the ignorant kind of People, and they began in <hi>England</hi> to Treat the <hi>Scots</hi> very Courſely; The Writers of the Age began to Diſcuſs the ſeparate Sovereignties, and Exalt the Titles of either Side.</p>
            <p>In <hi>England,</hi> one Doctor <hi>Drake</hi> Writes a Preface to an Abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Scots</hi> Hiſtory, wherein ſpeaking ſomething Reflecting upon the Freedom and Independency of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cauſed it to be Burnt by the Hangman at <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> Another <hi>Engliſh</hi> Author Writes of the Abſolute Dominion of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Crown over the Crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but he received the juſt Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of being little regarded; Another Writes of the Eaſineſs of Reducing <hi>Scotland</hi> by Arms—. Againſt theſe Mr. <hi>Anderſon, Hodges,</hi> and others, Write of the Antiquity, Freedom, and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency of <hi>Scotland,</hi> Aſſerting it in the Face of the World, for which Books the Parliament Rewarded them publickly.</p>
            <p>Thus, on both Sides, the Caſe ſtood between the Nations, a Pen and Ink War made a daily Noiſe in either Kingdom, and this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to Exaſperate the People in ſuch a manner, one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that never have two Nations Run upon one another in ſuch a manner, and come off without Blows.</p>
            <p>The Heats on both Sides being thus ſtrangely blown up, and the People of either Kingdom beginning to run into Exceſſes—, juſt in this Juncture, as if the Nature and Neceſſity of the Thing had driven both Nations to it, the Queen propoſes to the reſpective Parliaments, a Treaty of Union to be begun between the two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; This was in the year 1702, the Well-Wiſhers to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0554400100:77"/>
Peace earneſtly longed for this Union on both Sides; But I cannot ſay that they had equal Expectations of it, as Times then went.</p>
            <p>It was the firſt year of Her Majeſty's Reign, and the Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of things being then <hi>in hands</hi> in both Kingdoms, which Her Majeſty afterward thought fit to change, there is not ſo much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der why this Treaty came to nothing.</p>
            <p>There had been Obſtructions to the Deſign in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where Things were yet carried with more Jealouſie of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court than afterwards they ſaw Reaſon to do; This occaſioned a Proteſt from one ſort of Gentlemen againſt the Queens Naming the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners to Treat—; But even the very Gentlemen who proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, thought fit afterwards to come in to the Union as it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and had no ſmall Influence in the Succeſs of it.</p>
            <p>The Succeſs of the Union no doubt depended upon the Choice of the Perſons appointed to Treat, and this depended very much on the Repreſentation of the Miniſtry in either Nation to the Queen. As to the Miniſtry in <hi>Scotland</hi> I ſhall ſay nothing, the Gentlemen nominated there might perhaps have come into Meaſures for a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty well enough, moſt of the former Treaters being the ſame as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards finiſhed it—; But the Deſign of the Miniſtry in <hi>England</hi> ſeemed to act upon Meaſures not ſo conſiſtent with the true Intent and Meaning of the Treaty as could have been wiſht.</p>
            <p>Again the Jealouſneſs on both ſides about Church Affairs, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Union, were the ground of ſuch Difficulties as no Body could ſurmount, and lay as a Secret Mine, with which that Party who deſigned to keep the Nation divided, were ſure to blow it up at laſt, and therefore knew that all they did till that Point was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſt ſignified nothing, and that when ever they pleaſed to put an end to it, they had an immediate Opportunity.</p>
            <p>Without therefore entring upon ſuch juſt Reflections as I might very well be allowed to make upon the ſeveral Perſons, and Parts acting and acted in that, <hi>I had almost ſaid ſham Treaty,</hi> I may place the whole Miſcarriages of it very juſtly upon <hi>this one Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, viz,</hi> That the Affairs of Religion were left to the abſolute Determination and Appointment of the Treaters, and this might have inſtructed any Body that this Treaty would come to nothing, ſince it was morally impracticable that the Nice Article of Religion, as it particularly then ſtood between the two Churches, could have been ſettled to the mutual Satisfaction of both Kingdoms by a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, in which there was not one Perſon deputed or named by the Church, or inſtructed by them to enter upon the ſeveral Articles of a Treaty on either Hand.</p>
            <p>I know it has been ſaid, <hi>and perhaps there may have been ſome Truth in it,</hi> That the Article of Religion was to have lien paſſive and dormant, and neither Side was to have concerned themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, by which ſome would have had it underſtood, that either Side was to remain in the Condition they were then in—, and that this was the Meaning of the words of a certain Perſon, who when
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0554400100:78"/>
he was ask't, what Care was taken of the Church in that Treaty, Replyed, <hi>For GOD's Sake, let Us have no more of that Jargon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I confeſs, It's a charitable Conſtruction of the Words, to ſay, The Author only meant that Things ſhould be left to ſtand as they were, and the Treaters ſhould have no other Concern about it,—but I preſume thoſe People hardly conſidered that then the Eſtabliſhment of either Church had been left intirely to the future Diſpoſition of a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, who, whenever they were governed by a Majority on this or that Side might have Over-whelmed intirely the <hi>Scots</hi> Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, and erected Epiſcopacy upon them, or <hi>Vice verſa</hi> with the Church of <hi>England:</hi> And I preſume neither Church would have thought themſelves ſafe upon ſuch a Foundation, I am ſure, they would not have had Reaſon to have thought ſo.</p>
            <p>Such a Precarious Union muſt needs have begot future Convulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in both Kingdoms; And <hi>if We may judge by what has happned ſince,</hi> the Treaters would have met with but very Ordinary Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>Scotland</hi> when they came Home, and the abandoning the Church to the Mercy of the Parliament, which was in Effect, giving Her up to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> would certainly have Inflamed the whole Countrey.</p>
            <p>It is therefore the much kinder Reflection to ſay theſe Gentlemen never deſigned any Union at all, ſince to ſuppoſe the other, would be to ſuggeſt that they deſigned to give up their Native Countrey to a Bondage in Matters Religious, which they knew was Intolerable to their Countrey, and to lead them by the Hand to an Inevitable Breach between the Nations.</p>
            <p>For this Reaſon I ſay, that Treaty was never ſincerely deſign'd; if it was, it muſt reflect either upon the Underſtandings, or upon the Integrity of the Perſons concern'd.</p>
            <p>However, as I am here upon Matters of Hiſtory, and collecting together all that has been done with relation to uniting the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, as well what was Abortive as what came to Perfection; I think this Work cannot be compleat without giving you the Minutes of this Treaty alſo, as far as it proceeded—; But becauſe I would not interrupt the Threed of Hiſtory, I have adjourned it to the <hi>Appendix,</hi> where you have it at large, as I received it from the hand of a Perſon of Honour and undoubted Integrity, who was one of the Commiſſioners to that Treaty, and wrote it down with his own Hand. The Minutes are marked in the <hi>Appendix</hi> (N 14.)</p>
            <p>Upon the breaking up of this Treaty, three things happned to the further widening the unhappy Breaches between the Nations, which however they diſcovered the furious Temper of a Party of Men in both Kingdoms, ready and forward to inflame us and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve both Nations in Blood, yet their evil Deſign had this happy Iſſue, that it brought the Nations to the <hi>Griſis</hi> which inevitably brought on the great Treaty; it put us all into ſuch a Condition, that nothing but a Treaty for a nearer Union, or a Bloody and Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcilable Rupture could be the Conſequence—. And this I
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0554400100:79"/>
take to be a moving Argument, which in the Judgment of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry made the Treaty of Union abſolutely neceſſary, and thus the greateſt Good came out of the greateſt deſigned Evil.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe was the Affair of Captain <hi>Green</hi> and the Ship <hi>Worceſter.</hi> About the <expan>

            <p>The <hi>African</hi> Company there having a Ship formerly ſeized by the <hi>East-India</hi> Company in <hi>London,</hi> as ſhe was fitting out in the River of <hi>Thames;</hi> And for which they had in vain ſolicited Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, they obtain of the Government a Power to Seize and Stop this Ship by way of Repriſal.</p>
            <p>Accordingly the Ship was ſeized on, and brought into <hi>Brunt-iſland,</hi> and ſome time paſſed while the Ship lay under ſuch Circumſtances.</p>
            <p>During this Time, ſome of the Ships Crew, whether in their Drink, or otherwiſe, let fall ſome Words, implying that they had been Pirating, and particularly ſome very ſuſpicious Diſcourſes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating that there had been Blood in the Caſe.</p>
            <p>This prompted further Enquiries, and at laſt a plain and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Information was procured, that this Captain <hi>Green</hi> with this Ship <hi>Worcester</hi> had met with a <hi>Scots</hi> Ship commanded by one <hi>

                  </expan> Drummond</hi> in the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> had made Prize of the Ship, and Murthered <hi>Drummond</hi> and all his Crew.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſuſpicious and dark Speeches were ſo taken hold of, and trac't, that at laſt it came upon the Stage, and brought <hi>Green</hi> and his Ships Crew into the Courſe of publick Juſtice, and after a very long Tryal, they were found guilty of <hi>Piracy, Robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> and <hi>Murder;</hi> And particularly the Captain and five more were condemned to Dye for it, and the Captain with two more were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly executed.</p>
            <p>It is not the work of this Book to relate that Story at its full length, but I can not paſs it here without a ſhort Abridgement of the Proceedings; Becauſe as <hi>Scotland</hi> lyes under much Scandal on this Account, which, as to the Methods of publick Juſtice, I think ſhe does not deſerve, ſo the clearing up that Point, and the Relation it has to the preſent Subject I am upon, I think will come out Hand in Hand; and for that Reaſon I ingage in it.</p>
            <p>Some of <hi>Green</hi>'s Men, either in their Anger, or their Cups, or both, having let fall Words that rendred him very much ſuſpected of having been guilty of great Villanies, they were further watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Diſcourſe by ſome that had taken hold of their Words, particularly two Negroes, one <hi>Haines,</hi> and another, who, it ſeems, being diſguſted at the Captain, frequently let fall ſuch Expreſſions as gave the Hearers Reaſon to ſuſpect there had been great Villanies among them. Theſe Speeches are all to be ſeen in the Depoſitions of the Witneſſes, too long to repeat here, and particularly in the Printed Tryal, to which I refer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:0554400100:80"/>
I ſhall not take upon me here, either to Condemn or Acquit either Side, I know the World is divided on the Subject, ſome will have <hi>Green</hi> and his Crew, to be Guilty of all that is Charged on them; others ſay, The Company carried all againſt them, that they might have a good Pretence for Confiſcating the Ship. But be that as it will, it is moſt certain, the Folly and Imprudence of the Men Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, <hi>to ſay no more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From a little to more, from dark Expreſſions, they fell to down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Quarrelling, and calling one another Names, which there ſeems to be good reaſon to believe, might in part be true on both Sides, <hi>For ſome of them, however innocent of this Matter, had been, it ſeems, Guilty of Wickedneſſes of other ſorts, black enough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Folly of theirs, came at laſt to ſuch a Hight, that it could be no longer Concealed, for it became the publick Diſcourſe, That they had been Guilty not of Murder and Piracy only, but of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common Barbarities, and not that only, but that it was particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on a <hi>Scots</hi> Ship, and <hi>Scots</hi> Men, <hi>viz.</hi> Captain <hi>Drummond,</hi> as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>At length it was brought to the Ears of the Government, and as the publick Juſtice of all Nations is obliged to take Cogniſance of ſuch Horrid Things as were here ſuggeſted, the Fellows were Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and they frankly Confeſſing, <hi>Green</hi> and five of his Men were taken up; The poſitive Evidence were only two <hi>Negroes,</hi> but others ſo Corroborated what they ſaid, and Circumſtances con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring, to make almoſt every Body believe the Fact, at leaſt in that Hurry, they were upon a long Hearing ſeverally found Guilty of Piracy and Murder.</p>
            <p>There are ſometimes ſuch Criſis, ſuch Junctures in Matters, when all Things ſhall concur to poſſeſs, not a Man, but even a Nation with a Belief, of what at another Time they would not believe, even upon the ſame Evidence; And, <hi>in this,</hi> Man ſeems acted by a kind of ſupernatural Influence, as if inviſibly directed, to bring to paſs ſome particular Thing pointed out by Providence to be done, for Reaſons of his own, and known only to his Inſcrutable Wiſdom.</p>
            <p>Juſt ſuch a Caſe this ſeemed to be; the Circumſtances of <hi>Green</hi> and his Crew, were very Unhappy for them; Their being put into <hi>Scotland,</hi> where they had no manner of Buſineſs, no Diſtreſs to Force them in; Their being Seized by the Company, the Mens fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out among themſelves, and being the open Inſtruments of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting, what no one ever could ha' Charged them with, their ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there when they might have gone, and had no more Buſineſs there, from whence ſome alledge, they had no power to depart; Theſe, and more concurring Circumſtances which were obſerved by the moſt curious, and ſome of which were Noted upon the Trial, ſeem'd to Jump together ſo viſibly, that all People ſeem'd to acknowledge a wonderful and inviſible Hand in it, directing and pointing out the Detecting ſome Horrible Crime, which Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance ſuffered not to go Unpuniſhed.</p>

Nor was this the ſenſe of a few, but Generally ſpeaking of the whole Nation, I mean of conſidering People, and ſuch as uſually notice ſuch Things, and particularly of many of thoſe who cried out loudeſt of the matter, when it was too late to apply any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, in which, I cannot but think, they act Unkindly to their Country, and indeed very Unjuſtly, ſince, when the Conviction of ſuch Circumſtances was on the minds of the People, It is no wonder the Men were found Guilty by the Jury; and I perſwade my ſelf, they themſelves would have done the ſame.</p>
            <p>On their being found Guilty, they were not immediately Executed, but ſeveral Applications were made to <hi>England</hi> for their Reprive; the Council of <hi>Scotland</hi> Reprived them for ſome Days; And as ſome People began then to object, That the Evidence was but too ſlight, and that there was but one Witneſs to matter of Fact, and that the one Witneſs was but a <hi>Negroe,</hi> That he was not capable of the Impreſſions of the Solemnity of an Oath, That there was Malice in it, and the like; On theſe, and other Conſiderations, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ſo Tender of the Blood of the Men, that ſome have thought they had not Died, but for the Rage of the Common People, who hearing that they were further to be Reprived, got together in an unuſual Multitude, on the Day appointed for their Execution, crying out for Juſtice.</p>
            <p>And this part of the Story, is the Occaſion of my relating ſo much of it, ſince the Tendency it had to Inflame the Nations one againſt another, began here.</p>
            <p>On the Day appointed for Execution, the Privy Council was Set, and the Magiſtrates of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> were called to Aſſiſt—, where the Point was Debated, Whether the Condemned Perſons ſhould be Executed, or no; I will not ſay the Rabble Influenc'd the Council in their Determinations that way—; But this is certain, That the Diſcontent of the Common People was very well known, and that they were Furiouſly bent upon ſome Violent Methods, was very much feared—; That a vaſt Concourſe of People was ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered at that Inſtant in the Parliament Cloſs, at the Croſs, at the Priſon, and throughout the whole City, that they publickly Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Magiſtrates, and even the Council it ſelf, in caſe they were not brought out that Day, and ſome talked of pulling down the Tolbooth, which if they had Attempted, they would have Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed them in a way more like that of <hi>De Wit,</hi> than an Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Juſtice.</p>
            <p>However, it was the Council Determined the matter, that Three of them, <hi>viz.</hi> The Captain <hi>Thomas Green, John Mather,</hi> and <hi>James Simpſon,</hi> who were thought to be Principals in the Murder, ſhould be put to Death that Day.</p>
            <p>When the Magiſtrates of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> came out, they aſſured the People, That they were Ordered to be Executed, and that if they would have a little patience, they would ſee them brought out; and this pacified them for the preſent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:0554400100:82"/>
Soon after the Council breaking up, My Lord Chancellor came out, and driving down the Street in his Coach, as he paſt by the Croſs, ſome Body ſaid aloud, <hi>The Magistrates had but cheated them, and that the Council had repriv'd the Criminals</hi>—; This run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning like Wild-fire was ſpread in a Moment among the People; immediately they ran in a Fury down the Street after the Chancellor, ſtopt his Coach juſt at the <hi>Trone-Church,</hi> broke the Glaſſes, abuſed his Servants, and forc't him out of the Coach; ſome Friends that were concerned for the Hazard he was in, got him into a Houſe, ſo that he had no perſonal Hurt: 'twas in Vain for his Lordſhip to proteſt to them that the Men were ordered to be executed, they were then paſt Hearing of any Thing, the whole Town was in an Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar, and not the Mob of the City, but even from all the Adjacent Countrey was come together, Nothing, but the Blood of the Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers could appeaſe them: and had not the Execution followed imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, it cannot be expreſs'd, what Miſchief might have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.</p>
            <p>At laſt the Priſoners were brought out, and led through the Streets down to <hi>Leith,</hi> the Place of Execution, being by the Laws appointed there for Crimes committed upon the Sea—; The Fury and Rage of the People was ſuch, that it is not to be expreſt, and hardly did they ſuffer them to paſs, or keep their Hands off from them as they went, but throw a thouſand Inſults, Taunts and Revilings; they were at laſt brought to the Gibbet erected at the Sea-Mark, and there hang'd.</p>
            <p>Nor can I forget to Note, that no ſooner was the Sacrifice made, and the Men dead, but even the ſame Rabble, ſo fickle is the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, exclaim'd at their own Madneſs, and openly regrated what they had done, and were ready to tear one another to pieces for the Exceſs.</p>
            <p>This was not acted there with more Fury, than it was with the outmoſt Indignation reſented in <hi>England</hi>—, ſtill I am to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the common People; For the Government of neither Side had any Reſentment or Diſpute, all things having been carried on by legal Methods, Proceſs and Tryal, according to the Form of Law and Uſage of the Country.</p>
            <p>But here was new Matter for the Enemies of both Nations to work upon, and too much Fewel was thrown into the Fire of National Contention on both Sides.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Scotland</hi> it was ſaid the Court of <hi>England</hi> would protect them, and they would be pardon'd, <hi>only becauſe they were</hi> Scots-<hi>Men that were murdered;</hi> And the like.</p>
            <p>In <hi>England</hi> it was ſaid, the Rabble had cry'd out to hang them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> that they had ſaid they wiſht they could hang the whole Nation ſo, and that they inſulted them as they went to Execution with the Name of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Dogs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Never was ſuch an unfortunate Circumſtance to exaſperate the common People on both Sides, and to fill them with irreconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0554400100:83"/>

Averſions that might prepare them for Blood, and if in <hi>England</hi> it had gone a little higher, it would not have been ſafe for a <hi>Scots</hi> Man to have walk't the Street.</p>
            <p>Certain it is, that tho the Men had been innocent, <hi>for that was now alledged,</hi> yet as they were condemned by a due Courſe of Law, Tryed and Executed by the common Form of Juſtice in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and in the ſame manner by which their own Subjects were tryed and executed, the Fault muſt ly in the Witneſſes and the Jury that believ'd them; But there could be no pretence to make it a National Quarrel at all.</p>
            <p>That in <hi>England</hi> it had been but too frequent to Try and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn innocent Men, and that if Evidences ſwore the Fact, it might be the Misfortune of any innocent Man to fall under ſuch a Diſaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the Crime lay in the Villany and Perjury of Witneſſes, but the Nation could not be quarrelled on that Account.</p>
            <p>But ſtill theſe Things left a Corroded Maſs of ill Blood in the Minds of the People on either Side, &amp; as Improved by the Malitious Fomenters of our Diviſions, they were very Unhappy at that Time.</p>
            <p>To Exaſperate the People yet more, it was reported, That Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Drummond</hi> was yet Living, that neither he, nor any of his Men was ever Touch't by <hi>Green</hi> or his Crew, and ſome Seamen who Landed in <hi>England,</hi> made <hi>Affidavit</hi> directly contrary to the Evidence that Hang'd them.</p>
            <p>I ſhall no further enter into the Merits of the Caſe, than ſerves to the matter of National Heats—; The Thing was Generally, thought to be a haſty Execution, but the Argument, That it ought to be no Ground of a National Quarrel, prevailed in <hi>England,</hi> and the reſt of the Priſoners in <hi>Scotland</hi> were Reprived from Time to Time, and at laſt let go.</p>
            <p>In both theſe Caſes, the Miſchiefs of Tumult and Rabbles is to be obſerved, and how eaſie it is to ſet Nations on a flame, by the Violent Fomenting the Paſſions and Humours of the People, and how much thoſe ſort of Men are to be Deteſted, who blow the Coals of Strife and Diſſention in a Nation, prompt the Fury of an Enraged Multitude to Fly in one anothers Faces, and Inſult the Laws and Governments of both Countrys at once.</p>
            <p>The End of this Account, is to make out what I at firſt Noted, concerning the Cauſes which wrought theſe two Nations up to ſuch a Neceſſity of a Union, that either it muſt have been a Union or a War, the Animoſities on both Sides being raiſed to ſuch a pitch, that they could no longer have remained in the uſual <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> of Peace—; Nor was this Unhappy Story, the leaſt cauſe of the growing Averſion between us, which was now come to a very great Hight.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Head, to which I aſcribe the growing Alienation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two Kingdoms, was the Act of Security in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Act made a great Noiſe in the World, and was magnified in <hi>England,</hi> to ſuch a Hight, that it was look'd upon as in effect a Declaration of War, to Commence at the Queen's Demiſe, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0554400100:86"/>
however deſigned, was effectually made ſo, by what after hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.</p>
            <p>The Marquiſs of <hi>Tweeddale</hi> was High Commiſſioner to this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, a Perſon of Extraordinary Temper, Candor and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty—; The matter of the Succeſſion had in the preceeding Parliament been rejected, on this Suppoſition, That it was not Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent for <hi>Scotland</hi> to Joyn with <hi>England,</hi> except ſuch Conditions of Commerce and Navigation were firſt obtained by Treaty with <hi>England,</hi> as were Juſt and Honourable for <hi>Scotland,</hi> and abundance of Honeſt Gentlemen, who were far enough from ſo much as being ſuſpected of Favouring the Jacobite Intereſt, joyned together in this Demand; They were willing to come into the Succeſſion, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they had ſuch and ſuch Conditions, as they thought were reaſonable to be inſiſted on in behalf of <hi>Scotland,</hi> among which the Liberty and Freedom of Trade to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations was one—.</p>
            <p>There were many very Learned Debates in the preceeding Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament upon this Head; Great and Popular Speeches made on the Subject—, and the Act of Security was offered, and Voted, but could not then be paſt, for Things began to run high in the Parliament, which occaſioned a Receſs.</p>
            <p>This was taken in <hi>England</hi> in a moſt Hainous manner, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was now talked of there, but the <hi>Scots</hi> Buying Arms and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, Training and Exerciſing their Men, and Mighty Things were ſuggeſted in <hi>England,</hi> which the <hi>Scots might do,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times which they <hi>would do;</hi> The Printed News Papers gave a moſt Formidable Journal of the Duke of <hi>Athole</hi> drawing out his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers, Encamping three Days with Seven Thouſand Men, how Armed, how well Officer'd, and the like; Another Paper told the World of Sixty Thouſand Men in <hi>Scotland,</hi> Arm'd and Train'd, and ready to take the Field.</p>
            <p>However abſurd theſe Things were, and that Wiſer Men who knew the State of <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſaw there was nothing in it, but what every Nation in the World would have done in the like caſe, that it was neither more nor leſs than Arming their Militia, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them into ſome Order, which, for ſeveral years paſt had been intirely neglected, yet I ſay, However abſurd the Suggeſtions were, they were Improved in <hi>England</hi> to all manner of Extremes, and ſome moſt ridiculous Exceſſes were run into, both publick and private.</p>
            <p>It is, no doubt, but as <hi>Scotland</hi> was acknowledged to be Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, whatever the forward Pens of our Politicians would have pretended, yet I ſay, being acknowledged Independent even by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament, it was a very material Thing to have Her Concur in Eſtabliſhing the Succeſſion of the Crown, on the ſame Perſon, as <hi>England</hi> had done.</p>
            <p>Two Things mov'd in this Affair on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Side.<list>
                  <item>1. Some would not have it done at all, and therefore were for Irritating the <hi>Engliſh</hi> againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> that it might come to a Rupture in ſtead of a Settlement, and this by putting it
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0554400100:87"/>
upon <hi>Scotland</hi> to Declare, without a previous Treaty, which they knew would never be accepted.</item>
                  <item>2. Others would gladly have had the <hi>Scots</hi> come into the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, but were willing to have them do it without any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, thinking that <hi>Scotland</hi> ought ſtill be kept Low, for fear of their Principles, which lead them to be no Friends to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church Eſtabliſhment.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Both theſe cried out, and Exclaim'd at this Act of Security, and repreſented it to the World, as if the <hi>Scots</hi> were going actually to ſeparate from <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was one Clauſe in the Act of Security, which intirely Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the Succeſſor to the Crown from Governing both Kingdoms together.</p>
            <p>This the Enemies of <hi>Scotland</hi> preſently Repreſented in <hi>England,</hi> as a Deſign to Reſtore King <hi>James,</hi> and a great many Honeſt People were brought in to believe, that the <hi>Scots</hi> even the Presbyterians themſelves, were ſo alienated from <hi>England,</hi> and ſo obſtinately bent againſt joyning with her on any account, that they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver again be under the ſame Head, nay that they would rather League themſelves with <hi>France,</hi> and reſtore King <hi>James,</hi> than come to any Terms with her. And this was as it were confirmed when the <hi>Scots</hi> ſubſequent to theſe things paſſed an Act for Trading with <hi>France,</hi> tho' as their Circumſtances then ſtood, it was very neceſſary to them.</p>
            <p>Nor was this run to any thing leſs in <hi>England,</hi> and they began to talk loudly there of <hi>forcing the</hi> Scots <hi>to the Succeſſion;</hi> But this was by ſuch as either coveted a Breach between the two Nations u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon any Terms, or really did not underſtand what they ſaid. The latter appeared by their printing ſome Pieces to prove the Right of the Houſe of <hi>Hannover</hi> to the Crown by Succeſſion, a Thing all People that kno' any thing of the Affairs of <hi>Europe,</hi> kno' it was the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation upon which the preſent Eſtabliſhment pretends to be built—, But on that much ſafer, and much more Divine Right of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſtitution, and <hi>Scots</hi> alſo, I mean Parliamentary Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Things ran very high now in both Nations, the Meaſures ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in <hi>Scotland</hi> ſeem'd to be very well grounded, and their Aim well taken, for either <hi>England</hi> muſt comply with <hi>Scotland,</hi> as to ſuch Treaties as were reaſonable, or elſe ſhe might have the Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to ſee clearly <hi>Scotland</hi> by this Act was plac't in an intire ſeparate State from her, who ſhe wou'd joyn with, what Prince ſhe wou'd bring in, where ſhe would beſtow her Crown, was not to the purpoſe; Two Things ſhe had made plain.<list>
                  <item>1. That ſhe was reſolved to have it wholly in her own Hands, to beſtow as ſhe thought fit.</item>
                  <item>2. That wherever the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Crown was beſtowed, the <hi>Scots</hi> Crown ſhould not without Conditions be obtain'd.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>This effectually Settled and Declar'd the Independency of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:0554400100:88"/>
and put her into a Poſture fit to be treated with, either by <hi>England,</hi> or by any other Nation.</p>
            <p>Nor did the Apprehenſions which this gave the World of the <hi>Scots</hi> deſigning to reſtore King <hi>James</hi> do her any Diſſervice, for tho' nothing is more certain than that the <hi>Jacobites as they are called,</hi> conceived great Hopes from theſe Things, and flattered themſelves exceedingly, that the Return of their King, <hi>as they called him,</hi> would be the Effect of all theſe Breaches; And therefore fell in heartily with all theſe Things, and as far as poſſible carried on the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to a Settlement with <hi>England;</hi> Yet it is as certain, that the Gentlemen who mainly carried on this Project, had no more Eye that way than to the Great <hi>Turk,</hi> but were ſincerely bent to the Proſperity of their Country, and the Eſtabliſhment both Religious and Civil, as fully appeared afterwards by their heartily purſuing the Treaty that followed.</p>
            <p>The Drift of the whole Matter was, the bringing <hi>England</hi> to Terms, bringing the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation to a Treaty, and tho' it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that the Proſpect was Remote and Melancholly, <hi>England</hi> at the time being averſe to any ſuch thing; yet as theſe Gentlemen ſaw there was no other way to redeem <hi>Scotland</hi> from the Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhe then lay under, with reſpect to the Abſence of her Court, the Dependance of her Gentry and Nobility, the Limitations and Reſtrictions of Trade, which by the Act of Navigation ſhe was fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with, and ſeveral Diſadvantages her preſent Conjunction, <hi>which was made without any Treaty</hi> laid her under—, and therefore they ſtood ſtrictly and reſolutely to their Meaſures, and the more the Court in <hi>England</hi> puſht at her joyning in the Settlement, and uſed all poſſible means to bring it to paſs, the more averſe they appeared, and the farther they went off from it.</p>
            <p>Thus I ſay this Act of Security being only attempted in the firſt Seſſion of Parliament, was perfected in the next, and every day fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and further Advances were made ſeemingly to an entire and laſting Separation of the Kingdoms from one another.</p>
            <p>There were other Steps made to this on both Sides as to Matters of Trade, as ſhall appear immediately.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>England</hi> who was all this while under a very unhappy Conduct, and acted upon quite different Foundations, from what we have ſeen her happily brought over to ſince, took the worſt Meaſures upon the <hi>Scots</hi> Proceedings then, that ever a wiſe People could have taken; For the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament ſitting ſoon after, <hi>viz.</hi> 1704. the <hi>Scots</hi> Act of Security came to be conſidered, and however influenc't by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitant Party, <hi>God only knows,</hi> they paſt an Act in my Opinion the moſt Impolitick, I had almoſt ſaid unjuſt, that ever paſt that great Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>This was that Act of Parliament, Intituled, <hi>An Act to prevent the Miſchiefs ariſing to</hi> England <hi>from the Act of Security in</hi> Scotland. In which they in a manner declar'd open War with <hi>Scotland,</hi> unleſs by the 24th of <hi>Decemb.</hi> the next year they ſhould ſettle the Crown in the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0554400100:89"/>
ſame Perſon as now ſettled in <hi>England</hi>—; For they appointed 24 Men of War to be fitted out, to prevent the <hi>Scots</hi> Trading with <hi>France,</hi> declared the <hi>Scots</hi> in <hi>England</hi> Aliens, and ſeveral other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, as in the Act it ſelf may more at large appear.</p>
            <p>This was done in that famous Parliament, called, <hi>The Tacking Parliament,</hi> and it was the leſs to be wondred at, Becauſe, <hi>which is the Subject I am at preſent upon,</hi> the Heats between the Nations, which were at this time improv'd by the Parties on both Sides, were riſen to a very great Hight, all things tended to Exaſperations and Provocations, no Man of Temper ſeemed to ſhow himſelf on either Hand, and thoſe who bore the leaſt Regard to the general Good of both Kingdoms, foreſaw nothing but an unavoidable War between us; And indeed had Matters ſtood thus but a very little longer, it had been impoſſible to have avoided it, and that in a moſt unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able time for <hi>Europe,</hi> which was then engaged in the moſt furious and moſt critical Juncture of the War with <hi>France,</hi> being the year before the Battle at <hi>Blenheim.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the Party in <hi>Scotland</hi> who had laid their Scheme, in hopes that <hi>England</hi> would have come into Meaſures for the general Good, ſaw themſelves diſappointed; and tho' its true, that had <hi>England</hi> then ſeen with the Eyes of her National Underſtanding, and had ſhe not been ridden by a Party who openly purſued the Ruine of her ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Conſtitution, I mean as eſtabliſh't on the Revolution Principle, I ſay, had ſhe not been under that unhappy Influence, ſhe had taken other Meaſures, yet as it was, nothing was to be expected.</p>
            <p>However, the Gentlemen in <hi>Scotland</hi> happily reſolved to wait for the Iſſue of Things, and firmly adhered to their new Scheme; <hi>Scotland</hi> began to be talk'd up in the World a little, and theſe very Enemies who, <hi>as they thought,</hi> wounded her by talking up the mighty formidable Things this Act of Security might produce, really raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her Reputation; nothing was more abſurd, than their allarming <hi>England</hi> at the <hi>Chimeras</hi> of their own Heads, ſuch as <hi>Scotlands</hi> buying 30000 ſtand of Arms in <hi>Holland,</hi> laying in 10000 Barrels of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, arming 60000 Men, and the like, all which in Reality was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all but muſtering their Train'd-bands, <hi>as they call them in</hi> England, and buying about 500 Barrels of Powder for the Caſtle of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> In their allarming <hi>England</hi> I ſay, at theſe mighty things, they really raiſed the Reputation of <hi>Scotland</hi> in the World, and made her begin to make a different Figure in the Eyes of other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and there is no doubt had things gone on to a Rupture, as wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Men on both Sides wiſhed, and good Men began to fear, <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> might have found ſome powerful Princes willing to have accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her Crown, and to have in the mean time Supported, Supplyed and Encourag'd her to ſtand upon her own Feet.</p>
            <p>But I'll do the Gentlemen who Managed this Affair, this Juſtice, that I believe they had it not at all in their Deſign, to fly to the Protection of any Foreign Power, no not to any Proteſtant Power
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0554400100:90"/>
in <hi>Europe,</hi> unleſs Forc'd to it by the precipitant Meaſures <hi>England</hi> was then in all probability going into; and if they had done it then, I can not ſee how they could have been blam'd—. But as to the preſent State of Things, the Gentlemen who Managed this Part, ſeem'd to me, always to aim at obliging <hi>England</hi> to give them good Terms, and to put themſelves in ſuch a Poſture in the World, as ſhould make <hi>England</hi> ſee, it was worth their while to do ſo, as well as that they ought to do ſo; And this was ſo juſt a Step, and the Aim ſo well taken, as by the Conſequence appeared, that I think, 'tis the greateſt Panegyrick that can be made on thoſe Gentlemen, to ſay, They brought to paſs by it, all the great Things which GOD in his Providence has thought fit to do towards our Peace and Happineſs in this Iſland.</p>
            <p>If they did not deſign this, or had not this Honeſt Aim in View, they leſs deſerve the Praiſe; but it is evident, Providence made their Meaſures Inſtrumental to bring it to paſs.</p>
            <p>Thus ſtood the Affairs of this Iſland, at the End of the Year 1705, when the Averſions between the two Kingdoms, by the ſeveral Steps I have noticed, was come to a great Hight, the People ſeem'd Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated againſt one another to the higheſt Degree, the Governments ſeem'd bent to act Counter to one another in all their Councils; Trade Claſh't between them in all its Circumſtances, and every Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament run further and further into the moſt diſobliging Things that could be: <hi>England</hi> laid a new Impoſt upon <hi>Scots</hi> Cloth; <hi>Scotland</hi> Prohibited all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woollen Manufacture in General, and Erected Manufacturies among themſelves, which, had they been prudently Managed too, might have been very Advantageous to them; But, <hi>of that by the way. Scotland</hi> freely and openly Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported their Wool to <hi>France, Germany</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> to the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Loſs of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manufactures, having great Quantities of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Wool brought into <hi>Scotland</hi> over the Borders, which, it was impoſſible for <hi>England</hi> to prevent; So that the Famous Trade for Wool to <hi>France</hi> by <hi>Rumney Marſh, commonly called Owling,</hi> was intirely Dropt, and <hi>France</hi> not Supplyed only, but Glutted with Wool.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, <hi>England</hi> was proceeding to Prohibite the Importation of <hi>Scots</hi> Cattel, and to interrupt by Force their Trade with <hi>France,</hi> and had this laſt proceeded to Practice, all the World could not have prevented a War between both Nations.</p>
            <p>But more prudent Counſels prevailed, and GOD's Providence Unravelled all theſe Schemes of Deſtruction, which mad Men had drawn for the Ruine of their Native Country; And as many times Things evil in their Deſign, are Over-ruled by an Inviſible Hand, and bring to paſs that very Good, which they were prepar'd to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy; Even ſo it was here, for theſe Confuſions were the very Things that brought both the Nations to their Senſes, I mean, brought them both to better Temper—; The conſequences of a Bloody War juſt breaking out in the Bowels of their Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, in the Ruine and certain Deſolation of which they muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0554400100:91"/>
have a great Share, opened the Eyes of the moſt thinking People on both Sides, even of thoſe who in themſelves had no real inclination to the Conjunction of the Kingdoms, and thus the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of taking new Meaſures began to appear both ways.</p>
            <p>In <hi>England,</hi> the Weight of the preſent War which every Day rather Increaſed than Decreaſed; In <hi>Scotland,</hi> their declining Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and Diſunited Circumſtances; in <hi>England,</hi> the matter of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the proſpect of Advantage, all concurred to ſway the Inclinations of Wiſe-men to heal theſe Breaches.</p>
            <p>I have now ſhown by what Steps theſe two Nations were brought to the very Brink of mutual Deſtruction, and the Sequel of the Story will tell any body, who were the Parties that prompted both Nations to theſe Unhappy Extremes: I ſhall in the next place a little Examine how all this Tide of Miſchief and Folly turned, and how they began to come to themſelves in both Kingdoms, and this will ſo naturally lead us to the Hiſtory of the Union, that I can not think of a more proper Introduction.</p>
            <p>The Party in <hi>England</hi> who had the Reins of the Adminiſtration in their Hands, had given other Teſtimonies than this of their precipitant Meaſures, and as they had made not this Nation only Uneaſie, but their own too, ſo as Things Generally take new Turns, when they come to Extremes, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation began to be Allarm'd at the Proceedings, as tending to the Subverſion of all the Fabrick of Government erected by the Revolution.</p>
            <p>The occaſion of all this, is too long to relate here, and the Hiſtory of the Tacking the Occaſional-Bill to the Money-Bill in that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in <hi>England,</hi> is too well known, to need any Recital. It is enough to ſay here, That puſhing at ſuch Hot Meaſures in <hi>England,</hi> as is uſual in all Precipitations, like an Ax ſtruck upon a hard Stone, the Blow rebounded, and the Weapon flew out of the Hand of the Unskilful Workman—; the Project fail'd, the Party Overthrew themſelves, and never Recover'd.</p>
            <p>The Queen, far from approving the Extravagancies they were running Things to, and awakned by the Danger of her Peoples Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, which were as dear to her ſelf as to them, finding to what Miſchiefs theſe Warm Gentlemen were leading her, and being by the goodneſs of her Diſpoſition, as well as Experience in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Affairs, particularly Averſe to Things Hard or Severe upon her People, much more ſo to all manner of illegal Severities—, put a full ſtop to this Career of Miſchief—. And tho' indeed they had brought Things to the very Edge of Deſtruction both in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> on their own Buſineſs, as well as in the Affairs of the two Kingdoms, yet the Queen immediately ſhifting Hands, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with her uſual Wiſdom, to the Eſtabliſhing the Minds of her People, Retriv'd this whole Affair, reſtor'd <hi>England</hi> to the Tranquillity ſo much deſired, filled up her Miniſtry, and all Offices of Truſt, with Men of the ſame Candor and Moderation with her ſelf, openly Abandoned and Diſcouraged the Meaſures of thoſe People, who had run Things to ſuch Exceſſes, and Re-ſettled the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0554400100:92"/>
Minds of her People, Diſtracted with Apprehenſions of Ruine and Party-Confuſion.</p>
            <p>Thus the Miniſtry in <hi>England</hi> was intirely Changed, the Lord Keeper, Sir <hi>Nathan Wright</hi> Depoſed, Sir <hi>Edward Seymour</hi> Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller of the Houſhold put out of Her Family, the Earl of <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinghame</hi> Secretary of State, and ſeveral others laid aſide; the Props of the High-flying Party, <hi>as they were called,</hi> were left out of the Council, and removed from their Places in the Government.</p>
            <p>In the ſeveral Countries, the Peoples Approbation of Her Majeſties Proceedings, and their Joy at this Change of Inſtruments, was teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Univerſal Contempt put upon the Affair of the Tacking; and of the Occaſional-Bill, as well as of all Hot Men and Hot-Meaſures; and this teſtified by the Change in their Elections of Parliament-men, a new Parliament being then to be Choſen, in which ſo General an Averſion to the Occaſional-Bill, or any thing Invading the Toleration, and particularly to the Affair of the Tack appeared, that in ſpight of all Oppoſitions a great number of the Tacking Members were thrown out, and ſuch a Change of Men appeared in the next Parliament, that whereas in the other Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the High-Party had a Majority of Sixty Two or there about, for every Thing they joyn'd in; On the firſt Tryal of the Strength of the Houſe, which was perhaps the Greateſt that has been known of late Years, it appear'd the Whig-Party had the Majority by above Seventy Voices, and theſe by the turning out ſeverals on the Trials of Elections, and other Circumſtances, roſe up to be above a Hundred, tho' after they ſeem'd to loſe ſome Ground again, but it did not laſt.</p>
            <p>Things being thus happily turned in <hi>England,</hi> and the firſt Step for the Eſtabliſhing and Settling this new Party in their Seats of Management taken, it was wonderful to ſee the Change it made in all the Affairs of the Nation, how every Thing ſucceeded, unheard of Victories Abroad, unuſual Chearfulneſs at Home, and a new Face of Proſperity ſeem'd to Guild the Affairs of the Nation, the Feuds of Parties died in every place; Peace, Union, and Temper began to be the Companion of every Society, and the Ancient Animoſities between Neighbour and Neighbour, between Friend and Friend, which formerly crept, <hi>not into Society only,</hi> but even into our Families, and our very Beds, declined a pace; The Queen Encouraged Peace and Love, and Unity among her People, and preſſed the Nation to it upon all Occaſions, and all Good Men began to Encourage it by their Examples.</p>
            <p>In this General Felicity of Affairs in <hi>England, Scotland</hi> came into Remembrance; Her Majeſty as having an equal Regard to the Good of all Her Subjects, and as being juſtly Concerned, not for the Change of the Temper and Condition of Her People only, but for the Continuance of it to them in Ages to come, could not but be Solicitous for the removing the Obſtructions which lay in the way on either Side.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:0554400100:93"/>
When the Wiſeſt Heads in both Nations had been Conſulted with on this Article, tho' Opinions differ'd, yet no <hi>Medium</hi> could ever be found ſo Effectual to ſecure this Peace, and remove all poſſibility of a Fracture, like renewing the Treaty of Union.</p>
            <p>And thus I am brought down to the General Article of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by the meer Threed of the Story, the Feuds of Parties, the Folly of Stateſmen, the Fury of Rabbles, and the General Revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the old Animoſities between the People, had been Screwed up to a dangerous Hight, as is Noted already, by that very Party, who had on all Occaſions, ſhown themſelves Enemies to the preſent Eſtabliſhment, and future Peace even of both Nations, and by this Method, they thought they had rendred the Succeſſion to both Crowns Impracticable for the Houſe of <hi>Hannover,</hi> and ſecured an inevitable Rupture between the Nations, when ever it ſhould pleaſe GOD to Remove Her Majeſty out of this World.</p>
            <p>But great are the Wonders of Inſcrutable Providence, theſe very Schemes contrived in the Deeps of Infernal Malice, Brooded on by that Party who ever Envied the Liberty of Proteſtants, and the Tranquility as well as Privileges Enjoy'd by the People of this whole Iſland, and Hatch'd by the warm Influence of a reigning Party, by which they Flattered themſelves, They had effectually Overthrown the Project of a Union of the Kingdoms, made their Coalition Impoſſible, and all Schemes projected for it Impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable; I ſay, theſe very Things made way for that ſame Union, they were Calculated to Deſtroy.</p>
            <p>The Hight thoſe Meaſures I have been ſpeaking of, was brought to, made, as it were, a Force upon both Nations to come to this Treaty.</p>
            <p>It was now but a few Months to come, when the Nations muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly fall out, <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men of War muſt be fitted out to cruiſe upon the <hi>Scots,</hi> and we that conſented, or at leaſt did not ſcruple to have the <hi>Dutch</hi> carry on a free Trade with <hi>France,</hi> muſt go &amp; fight with our own Brethren for it—; Whereas, had we been in our Trading Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, we would have done it our ſelves.</p>
            <p>The Criſis things were come to now, was ſuch, that they could no longer ſtand at a Stay, but we muſt fall out with the <hi>Scots,</hi> or unite with them, all Methods to bring them to ſettle the Succeſſion without a Treaty had been in vain uſed by the Party before, who would gladly have Tricked them into it, but the <hi>Scots</hi> were too wiſe to fall into that Snare.</p>
            <p>The preſent Miniſtry were for fairer Dealings with them at the ſame time, wiſely concluding, that to gain of the <hi>Scots</hi> what they ought to grant, it was reaſonable to grant to the <hi>Scots</hi> what they ought to have—, and that a Treaty with them might be made ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, the only way was to ſet about it, upon an honeſt Foot, and then purſue it ſincerely, and not upon Sharping and Tricking on either Side as before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:0554400100:94"/>
But there yet ſeemed to ly one invincible Obſtruction in the way of this Treaty, and that was the Act of Parliament paſſed in <hi>England</hi> the laſt Seſſion, which, as before noted, had declared a kind of War againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> in caſe they did not come into the Succeſſion by ſuch a Day; And upon the firſt Motion to a Treaty, the <hi>Scots</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared they could not enter into any Treaty with <hi>England,</hi> till that Act was Repealed.</p>
            <p>This had indeed a great deal of Reaſon in it, and ſuch as could not be withſtood, for the Honour of the <hi>Scots</hi> ſeemed very much impaired in that Act, and that they could not come to a Treaty u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon equal Terms while ſuch a Law ſtood in force upon them, which ſeem'd as if it had been a Sword over their Heads drawn to awe them into a Treaty.</p>
            <p>The Queen, who was reſolved if poſſible to bring this great Event to paſs, and who ſtrove to do it ſo, as might give all Her Subjects Satisfaction, undertook to clear up this Difficulty, and at the next Parliament which met in <hi>England, Octob.</hi> 23. 1706, in Her Speech to both Houſes, Recommended the taking away of this Obſtruction, by Repealing that Act, in order to introduce a Treaty of Union, which Her Majeſty ſaw now more clearly in view than ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>I know there were ſtrong Struggles in <hi>England</hi> againſt Repealing this Act, and that chiefly without Doors, the Party foreſeeing, that if this Step was taken in Parliament, the Union which they really dreaded would of courſe come upon the Stage, to this end it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as Diſhonourable to make ſuch an Advance to the <hi>Scots:</hi> That it was an Inſulting of <hi>England</hi> to have the <hi>Scots</hi> ſay, they would not Treat with her till ſuch and ſuch Conditions were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed—; That this was letting the <hi>Scots</hi> preſcribe Prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries upon <hi>England,</hi> and if <hi>England</hi> complyed, it would make them more Encroaching.</p>
            <p>But the Temper in the Parliament was quite different from this, it was plain there that the <hi>Scots</hi> were in the Right to aſk this as a Preliminary, that the Treaty would for ever be ſubject to this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, that it was not free, but done under the Terror or Force of that Act of Parliament, that as it was not Honourable for the <hi>Scots</hi> to have a Treaty forced upon them under ſuch Circumſtances; So neither was it Honourable for <hi>England</hi> to force a Treaty upon them, that the Act was unreaſonable in its own Nature, that <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> could have no pretence but meer Violence to intermeddle with the <hi>Scots</hi> Commerce, who were a free Nation, and ought to be at Liberty to Trade with any Nation that they thought fit to Trade with, that their Trade with <hi>France</hi> was done by their own Act of Parliament paſſed by the Queen, and was not inconſiſtent with, or contraveening any Treaty or Contract with <hi>England,</hi> that <hi>Scotland</hi> was under no Treaty of Commerce, or under no Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to Trade, or not to Trade as <hi>England</hi> did; That as to the Confederacy, and the War in which they were embark't with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:0554400100:95"/>
that laid them under no Obligation, ſince the <hi>Dutch</hi> were in the ſame Confederacy, and yet openly proclaimed a free Trade with <hi>France;</hi> Nor did the <hi>Engliſh</hi> pretend to obſtruct them in it; That <hi>Scotland</hi> was as Independent of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government as the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and ought to be at liberty to Trade unmoleſted as well as they.</p>
            <p>Theſe Arguments back't with an Adminiſtration of Government now quite recovered from the Tyrannical Principles of thoſe former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Power, ſoon influenc't the Parliament to Repeal the Act, and take this Step by way of advance to the Scots, by which they let the <hi>Scots</hi> ſee they were in the hands of their Friends, that now they might expect fair Dealings, and had Room to Treat with Freedom and Honour.</p>
            <p>This was a great Mortification to thoſe Gentlemen who had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted that Act, who now together with their whole Party, ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with all their Artifice to oppoſe the Treaty in all its Parts in both Kingdoms; to raiſe Scruples, imprint Jealouſies, Miſrepreſent Perſons and Things, embroil Councils, raiſe Scandals, and in ſhort to do every manner of thing they could to embarraſs and obſtruct the Treaty: And in the firſt place to prejudice the Minds of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People againſt the Union as ſuch. What fatal Succeſs they had, how they carryed it on, even beyond the Concluſion of the Treaty, with what Difficulties it was encountred, how begun, how carried on, how finiſhed, and how ſince aſſaulted, and with difficulty enough preſerved, will be the Subject of the enſuing Sheets.</p>

            <p>I Am now come to the Great and Capital Treaty, which has at laſt, by the Bleſſing of GOD, been brought to a Happy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.—</p>
            <p>I am not Inſenſible, That, in the ſtrange Variety of Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Changes of Proſpects, the Turns of Management, the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and Niceties, with which it has been carryed on, the Infinite Difficulties the Zealous Promoters of it met with, the Reſtleſs At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks of a Strong Party to Diſappoint it, who never gave over their Struggle, no not even after it was done: In this Labyrinth of Untrode Paths, I may eaſily miſplace ſome things, and omit others; and I cannot but Introduce my Account of it with this Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that tho' I believe no Man can have Collected with more Care, nor has had the Opportunity to Remark things with more Advantage, having been Eye Witneſs to much of the General Tranſaction, and furniſh'd by the beſt Hands with every moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Affair in the Carrying it on; yet many Minute Things may have paſt my Pen, which it is impoſſible for me to Attone for, but by making this <hi>Proviſo,</hi> That the Reader may be aſſured, nothing Material can have ſlipp'd me; and I have uſed all neceſſary Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to furniſh my ſelf with the whole Truth of Fact, whatever Omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Circumſtances I may make an Apology for:</p>
            <p>I have already related the Iſſue of the Treaty begun the firſt Year of the Queen, and made my Obſervations of the Reaſon of its Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage: It may be obſerved, That Her Majeſty underſtanding the true Reaſons of the Diſappointment, which 'twas thought lay in the Perſons Treating, particularly on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Side, whoſe Diſpoſition to finiſh it for the Publick Good, it was ſuppoſed, did not appear at all to Her Satisfaction, <hi>in which I have further already Explain'd my ſelf,</hi> Obtain'd a New Act of Parliament in <hi>England,</hi> and the like in <hi>Scotland,</hi> Impowering the Queen to Appoint Commiſſioners on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hand, to Treat of an Union between the Two Nations.—</p>
            <p>And here 'tis neceſſary to obſerve, how well the Ground Plot of this Work was laid, that all Obſtacles might be removed, which might threaten it with another Abortion; It had been noted, that the moſt Dangerous Rock of Difference, on which this Union could Split, and which could now render it Ineffectual, was that of Religion: Here it was certain they could never Unite, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0554400100:97"/>
the Breach therefore being Irreconcileable, the beſt Courſe that could be taken with it, was to let it quite alone as a thing neither ſide ſhould meddle with at all, and conſequently the Jealouſies and Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious on both ſides muſt vaniſh, and the great Obſtructions which the Enemies of the Treaty relyed on for its Miſcarriage were at once removed.</p>
            <p>This was a Maſter-Piece of Policy, and ſhewed, that Her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty had other Perſons to Conſult with, and had taken other Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures than before, and gave People very early Impreſſions of the Succeſs which has ſince appear'd.</p>

            <p>The Vehemence with which the ſeveral Parties, who managed theſe Topicks, acted their reſpective and exceedingly remote Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects; and by what ſtrange Myſtery, concurring Providence, like the Wheel within all their Wheels, center'd them all, in Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Nations; as it is a ſecret Hiſtory few underſtood, and may be as Neceſſary as Diverting, ſo the Heads of it may be view'd in the following Scheme.<list>
                  <item>1. The Succeſſion being the main thing that lay at the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of every ones Project, I ſhall firſt ſpeak to the Particulars of that.
<p>There was a Party in both Kingdoms, but moſt Powerful in <hi>Scotland,</hi> whoſe Deſign was principally and directly againſt the Proteſtant Succeſſion as ſuch; Theſe we muſt allow to be ſetting every Wheel at Work, and Acting with all their Power and Policy againſt every thing which look'd that way.</p>

            <p>When they ſaw it convenient, they acted againſt an Union in its general Term, and frequently ſome of the leſs Politick of that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty let fall the Excreſcence of their Principles in direct Terms, and Pamphlets were wrote upon that Scheme, ſuch as one ſhewing the Neceſſities of a War with <hi>England, &amp;c,</hi> another ſhowing the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of an Union with other Nations, and <hi>France</hi> in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; others argued continually the mighty Terms, and the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of Commerce <hi>Scotland</hi> might obtain from <hi>France,</hi> and not only propoſed them as Equivalent to the Trade with <hi>England,</hi> but run on to ſuch weak Extremes, as to ſay, that <hi>Scotland</hi> made no Advantage of her Commerce with <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But theſe may well be ſaid to be the leſs Politick Part of theſe Gentlemen who were in the Deſign above, for they loſt Ground even againſt the Union it ſelf by it; and when the Committee of Parliament, Appointed to Examine the Exports and Imports, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, That <hi>Scotland</hi> Exported to <hi>England</hi> above 200000 Pounds
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0554400100:98"/>
               <hi>Sterling per Annum</hi> in Linen, Cattel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Imports from thence appear'd ſo ſmall, that the Objectors dropp'd their Arguments upon that Head, and learn'd to talk with more Caution.</p>
            <p>But the more Subtile Managers of this Deſign againſt the Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, went on by different Meaſures, and with great Policy they acted every Party, as far as they thought they could be brought in to be ſubſervient to their Deſign.</p>
            <p>Thus firſt ſeeming to quit their direct Oppoſition to the Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as a Thing too open, and too much Claſhing with the Temper of the Time, they fall in with that Party, who were for the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion with Limitations; Not that they wou'd have concurr'd with the Event, had theſe Limitations been never ſo great, but that, in their Debating the Limitations, they might find Room to Clog the Succeſſion it ſelf, in ſuch manner as the other Party could by no Means accept of it.</p>
            <p>From the ſame Principle proceeded that Famous Reſolve in their Act of Security, by which the Succeſſion met with two Invincible Obſtacles, from whence they knew, ſome time or other, new Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes muſt ariſe, 1. That no Succeſſor at all ſhould be Named, till after the Queen. 2. That when it was Named, it ſhould be with this Limitation, that it ſhould not be the ſame that ſhould Succeed to the Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was a Maſter-Piece of Policy, and had the moſt Specious Pretence in the World, <hi>viz.</hi> The Hardſhips which <hi>Scotland</hi> had ſuffered under the Influence of <hi>England</hi> in Matters of Commerce and Sovereignty; and therefore it was added immediately upon the ſaid Clauſe, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs that in this Preſent Seſſion of Parliament, or any other Seſſion of this, or any enſuing Parliament, there be ſuch Conditions of Government Settled and Enacted, as may Secure the Honour and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty of this Crown and Kingdom, the Freedom, Frequency and Power of Parliament, the Religion, Liberty and Trade of the Nation from</hi> Engliſh, <hi>or any Forreign Influence.</hi> See the Act of Security Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Appendix</hi> to this Work, <hi>N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>.</hi> (1)</p>
            <p>The running things to this Height in <hi>Scotland,</hi> put every Parties Meaſures to a full Stop; The Gentlemen who were againſt the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion in general, and of whom I am now Treating, had moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually carryed their Point; for as they preſumed <hi>England</hi> could never come in to ſuch a Treaty as they demanded, ſo they had effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually forecloſed the Succeſſion of <hi>Hannover,</hi> by Determining, that the Succeſſor of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould not be the ſame.</p>
            <p>And 'tis remarkable to note here, how univerſally all thoſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whoſe Aim was, <hi>Againſt</hi> the Succeſſion, fell in with thoſe whoſe Deſign was only to have Advantageous Terms from <hi>England</hi> for it.</p>
            <p>But this very Point gain'd, brought about the main Work, and the Contraries that concurr'd in this Act, tho' from Claſhing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, by the ſtrange Circulation of Cauſes, work'd all together into another Extreme, which none of them deſign'd, and that was the Union.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0554400100:99"/>
Upon the paſſing the Act of Security, <hi>England</hi> grew very uneaſy, and not to mention the common Apprehenſions of the People, nor how, and by whom they were encreaſed and fomented, the Act of Parliament paſt, Intituled, <hi>An Act to prevent the Dangers ariſing from the Act of Security in</hi> Scotland, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is a Demonſtration of what the Tendency of theſe Things would be; For this Act, which I have alſo, for the better underſtanding of the Story, Abridg'd and Printed in the <hi>Appendix, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>.</hi> (2.) brought both Nations under the Neceſſity of a War by the <hi>Chriſtmaſs</hi> following; the <hi>Engliſh</hi> being then obliged to fit out a Fleet, to interrupt the <hi>Scots</hi> Commerce, if their Act of Security was not Repealed.</p>
            <p>Things being brought to this Extremity, the only Remedy that thoſe who wiſhed well to both Nations could contrive, was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive a Treaty of Union, and ſet heartily about it,—and the firſt Step the Queen took towards it, was to propoſe it to the <hi>Scots</hi> Parliament, who Voted,—<hi>That they could enter into no Treaty of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, till that Act of Parliament mentioned above was Repealed in</hi> England.</p>
            <p>Tho' this was a very bold Reſolve, yet the Queen, who ſaw ſome Reaſonableneſs in it, managed Things with ſo much Wiſdom and Moderation; and the Parliament, who ſaw with differing Eyes from the other, and was of a quite differing Temper, found ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo ſevere and ſo hard upon <hi>Scotland</hi> in that Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that they made no Difficulty to make that Step in Advance to <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this Foot turn'd the firſt Appearance of the Union; Now let us ſee how the Parties managed themſelves on all ſides.</p>
            <p>The Inclination on both ſides to an Union, <hi>however afterwards manag'd,</hi> ſeem'd ſo univerſal, That the Party I am ſpeaking of, thought it was not proper to appear againſt it directly; but acting ſtill under Diſguiſe, they puzzle the Cauſe, <hi>firſt,</hi> With the wild Debate of a Federal Union, or an Union Partial and Imperfect;—and thus they fell in with the Party who were for the Union, not that they had the Union in their Deſign; but becauſe they thought the Thing Impracticable in it ſelf; That it would make the People Sceptick in Government; and that ſo it would certainly miſcarry, and the Succeſſion would be loſt that way.</p>
            <p>Accordingly the Limitations were by ſecret Influence oppoſed, and the Scheme of Succeſſion laid aſide to go upon the <hi>Chimera</hi> of an Union, <hi>as they thought it to be;</hi> and I could be very Merry with ſome Gentlemen here, upon the Banters and Jeſts they always Treated the Scheme of an Union with, as a Thing they little thought would ever be licked into any Shape, or ever obtain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Nations to paſs into a Law.</p>
            <p>Thus I have brought the remoteſt Party, who were downright Enemies of the Union, to fall into it;—From whence, let their Deſign be what it will, I muſt tell them, they did it this Service, that it made the Union <hi>very Popular,</hi> however it came to be otherways afterward.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0554400100:100"/>
I come next to the Difficulty about Nobility, and this work'd in to an Union, by, as it were a Natural Conſequence; For the Antient Nobility finding their Sway with the People leſſen'd, and their Power, as well as their Honour, eclips'd, by the Crown day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Creating Numbers of what <hi>they</hi> called Upſtart Lords, were ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily engaged in Limitations, to prevent their Future Monarch's en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing the Numbers of their Rank, to the Diminution, as they took it, of the Antient Families.</p>
            <p>But when they came to conſider the Scheme of Diſtinction made for the Repreſenting the Nobility in a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, they were the more eaſily brought into the Union, as an effectual Step to prevent the Reducing their Honour, by Multiplying their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and as a thing which would ſeem to diſtinguiſh them from ſuch of the Modern Nobility, which they reckon'd already a Burthen to them.</p>
            <p>Next, among the <hi>Whig</hi> Intereſt, and who were really Honeſt in their Deſigns for the General Good, were yet two Parties.</p>
            <p>One Party, without Reflection on any, had taken a juſt Umbrage at the Growing Power of a certain Great Man; and as they had Reaſon to Ward off Perſonal Reſentments, in caſe their Figure was diminiſhed; and having their true Intereſt in View, together with the Publick Good, eſteem'd it their Good Fortune, to have them both ſtand upon one Bottom;—And theſe Gentlemen came hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily and honeſtly into the Meaſures of the Union.</p>
            <p>Another Party were for the Succeſſion <hi>Limited, &amp;c.</hi> but not for the Union; Theſe brought the former firſt to them, thinking they would rather be for the Succeſſion, and lay by the Thoughts of the Union; but finding them intirely for the Union, they fell in together.</p>
            <p>The View of the Court in <hi>England</hi> was plain, <hi>viz. For the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion at any Rate;</hi> and therefore, till this Juncture, they had Eſpouſed that Party in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who were for the Succeſſion, tho' with Limitations; and this the more eaſily brought thoſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men into the Union, ſince there they ſecured the Succeſſion, and had the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Limitations Confirm'd, which they knew and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd were better than their own.</p>
            <p>Thus the two <hi>Whig</hi> Parties joyn'd, and the Duke of <hi>Queensberry,</hi> who had, in Concert with Her Majeſty and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved all the ſeeming Difficulties on the part of <hi>Scotland,</hi> appearing publickly for it, the Union, as I have already noted, grew very Popular, the Court and the <hi>Whig</hi> Lords concurr'd in the General Good, the <hi>Jacobite</hi> Intereſt were abandon'd, and the Union grew up between all the Extremes as a Conſequence; and it was meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Formed by the Nature of Things, rather than by the Deſigns of the Parties.</p>
            <p>Things being brought to this Paſs, the Acts of Parliament paſſed, and the Queen Impowered to Name Commiſſioners; I ſhall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the Proceedings in Order as they ly before me, and make the needful Obſervations as I go.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0554400100:101"/>
The reſpective Acts of Parliament for this Nomination, as abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to the better underſtanding of the Caſe, and laying a Regular Scheme of the whole Matter before the Eye of the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, I have annexed in the Collection herewith marked.</p>
            <p>They that had ſo wiſely contrived the Beginning of this Work, could not be at a Loſs to find out proper Perſons for the Managing the Treaty in both Kingdoms; And therefore it was not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Her Majeſty Named the Commiſſioners for both Kingdoms, whoſe Names we ſhall preſently come to.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not deſcend to Encomiums on the Perſons of the Treaters; For I am not about to write Panegyricks here, but an Impartial and Unbyaſt Hiſtory of Fact. But ſince the Gentlemen have been ill treated, eſpecially in <hi>Scotland,</hi> upon this very Head, Charg'd with ſtrange Things, and Expoſed in Print by ſome, who had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but their Averſion to the Treaty to move them to Maletreat them: I muſt be allowed, on all Occaſions, to do them Juſtice in the Proceſs of this Story.—And as I muſt owne, That, generally ſpeaking, they were Perſons of the greateſt Probity, the beſt Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, and the ſteadieſt Adherence to the true Intereſt of their Countrey; ſo, their Abilities will appear in every Step taken in ſo great a Work, the bringing it to ſo ſhort a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, and that, in ſo little Time, the Reducing it to ſo Conciſe a Form, and ſo Fixing it, That, when all the Obſtruction imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable was made to it afterward in the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Mountains of Objection, which at firſt Amuſed the World proved ſuch Mole-hills, were ſo eaſily Removed, Raiſed ſo much Noiſe, and Amounted to ſo little in Subſtance, That, after all was granted, that in Reaſon could be Demanded, the Amendments were ſo few, and of ſo little Weight, that there was not one Thing Material e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, to obtain a Negative in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament.</p>
            <p>I cannot but note here, That even thoſe Amendments were not made, by Reaſon of any Omiſſion in the Treaters; But the Parliament found the Oppoſing Party to the Succeſſion had two Handles to lay hold on in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and therefore in Prudence gave way to ſuch Amendments, as they had the leaſt Reaſon to Juſtify; Theſe two Heads, which I call Handles againſt the Succeſſion, were,<list>
                  <item>1. Strength of Party, by which they hop'd to Carry it at once, and Throw out the Treaty <hi>Brevi Manu;</hi> and this they endeavour'd to Form upon a General Diſlike, they having Blacken'd it with the Mark of a Thing Diſhonourable to the Sovereignty and the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence of the Nation.</item>
                  <item>2. If they found that would not do, then to load it with ſuch Ridiculous Amendments, as they knew would cauſe it to miſcarry in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament; which they alſo thought would give <hi>Scotland</hi> great Advantage, and Encreaſe the Animoſities in <hi>Scotland</hi> againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> when the Rupture ſhould appear to be from <hi>England,</hi> and the moſt Reaſonable Conceſſions of <hi>Scotland</hi> be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by them.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0554400100:102"/>
But both theſe Projects failed them; The firſt was effectually Anſwer'd by the Nature of the Thing; and their Strength fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, they found they had caſt up their Account falſe, their Motion being thrown out by a great Majority in Voting the firſt Article, as will appear preſently.</p>
            <p>The ſecond, when they came to Examine Particulars, had not ſufficient Strength of Reaſon to ſupport it; all the Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they could pretend to, were ſo ſmall, That, <hi>as above,</hi> the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> never thought it worth their while to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute them; and the Treaters themſelves, for the moſt part, went into thoſe Amendments, as they were offered.</p>
            <p>Indeed this was a Diſappointment to ſome People, who made no Queſtion, at leaſt, to puzzle the Cauſe, and raiſe ſuch Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as ſhould Require a Remitting the Treaty back to <hi>Scotland;</hi> and ſo ſpin it out in Length, that the Nations might have Leiſure to Form the ſeparate Parties into ſome Order; and raiſing their Friends on both Sides, if poſſible, bring it to a Breach—; And that I do not paſs an unjuſt Cenſure, I refer the Reader, among Infinite Pamphlets publiſh'd againſt this Affair, to one very plain and bare-fac'd Author mentioned before, Entituled, <hi>The Neceſſity of a War with</hi> England, <hi>in Order to Cure the preſent Diſtempers of the Times.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhould do the Fomenters of the Nations Diviſions too much Credit, to Trouble the Reader of this with any of their Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Oratory againſt this Union, much leſs enter into any Diſquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the Subject of their Clamours;—But I may, perhaps, touch upon the principal Heads of their Objections, and let the World know alſo, who were ſome of the Objectors.</p>
            <p>When the Acts were thus paſs'd, and Her Majeſty had Nam'd Commiſſioners on both Sides, and the Work ſeemed to be going about in Earneſt; The Learned Scriblers of the Age began to Harraſs the World with their Schemes, and all the Mountebank Stateſmen of the Times ſet to Work, to propoſe their Wondrous Methods for Curing this Antient Diſtemper of the Nations, and ſtriving to have it ſaid of themſelves, who was Forwardeſt in the Great Work.</p>
            <p>The Induſtry they diſcover'd had, in nothing, a greater Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, than in this, That the whole Croud of Writers, with an Univerſal Agreement, had the Honour to be intirely miſtaken; and not one of them had Eyes to ſee to the true Intereſt of the Nations; every Man, as, in ſuch Caſes is uſual, Eyed the reſpective Intereſts or Advantages, as he thought, of the Nation to which he belong'd, and ſet himſelf to Work to Anſwer the Objections of the other, Defending, Arguing, and Fatiguing their own Heads, and their Readers, with the Confuſed Labyrinths of their own Projects; but not once touching the true String, which, with a National Uniſon, would have immediately Sounded out the Harmony of General Peace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0554400100:103"/>
Nor am I at all Arrogant, in ſaying, they were all ſo generally miſtaken in their Notions of what this Union ſhould be; Since, as I have ſaid, every one fell to Arguing the ſingle and ſeparate Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of the Nation they belong'd to; Inſiſting on their Politick Notions, and Wiſe Schemes for their reſpective Advantages: But, not one, that I met with, ever Entered into the True and Only Notion Eſſential to the Union; I mean the Principle of Self-Denial, how far either Nation was to Condeſcend and Advance to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, How the preſent Union Conſiſted not, in Gaining Advantages on either Hand of one and other; but in Abatements, in giving each other Advantages, in yielding up Privileges, opening the Treaſures and Strength of either Nation, to the Good and Benefit of the whole.</p>
            <p>They never dream'd, That, to Unite, was, in it ſelf, a full and a general Retribution for every Step taken from one Side to the other; That a New National Intereſt was to be Erected; and that giving or Conceding Rights, Advantages and Intereſts, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Commerce or in Privileges, was loſing nothing at all; but was like a Man giving Preſents to a Lady, whom he deſigns to make his Wife; which is but taking his Money out of one Pocket, and putting it into another; or like a Man ſettling his Eſtate in Joynture on his Wife, which is ſtill his own, and is effectually ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured for his Poſterity.</p>
            <p>The Gentlemen muſt pardon me, if I tell them, That, for want of this True and Original Notion of Union, they took but too much Pains to Inform us all, they had neither the Spirit of Union in their Minds, nor the Knowledge of it in their Heads—; And this run them upon Wild <hi>Dilemmas</hi> and Dark Schemes of Federati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Confederations; This ſent them to <hi>Belgia, Helvetia, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia,</hi> and I know not whither, for Examples for Schemes, Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and I know not what ſtrange Syſtems of National Unions; all which, I muſt take the Liberty to ſay, were as Wide from the only Step, that could make theſe Nations happy, as the Eaſt is from the Weſt, tended to nothing, but Confuſion of Intereſts, National Jealouſies, and in the end War and Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Theſe Gentlemen were for making Bargains between the Nations, not for bringing two Great and Mighty Kingdoms into one Vaſt United Body, the ſame in Intereſt, the ſame in Proſpect, the ſame in every Subſtantial Conſtituting Part; The Advocates of either People talk'd like Counſellors Pleading for their Clients, not like two Friends, that were Striving, who ſhould part with moſt, for the Intereſt and Engagement of the Love of each other.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, the Union has been brought to paſs, not by gaining from, but by yielding to one another; Not by making Conditions and Advantages of one another, but by Conceding to one another; One part opens the Treaſures of their Trade, the other ſtruggles to bear their Share of the Weight and Burden of Expenſive and Bloody Wars; This part yields up one thing, that abates another, and Mutual Condeſcenſions, not Mutual Encroachments, have brought this Work to paſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0554400100:104"/>
And here lyes the great Myſtery of the Union; They that think ſtrange of the Circumlocutions the Wiſeſt Heads have taken, may find them here; They that Enquire into the Reaſons of former Miſcarriages, may find them all here; If there was any want of Temper, any mutual Diſtruſts, any ſecret Murmurs of Parties, any Jealouſies of Conſequences, it was all to be found here; That the People, who Debated theſe Points, never Look'd beyond the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State, never Conſidered the Conjunct Capacity of the Nations, never drew the Ballance of Intereſts, or ſtated the Affairs of both Nations into one Account Current.</p>
            <p>Had they ever done this, they would have ſeen that Monſter, as they call'd the Union, a moſt Beautiful Creature, Admirable in its Contexture, Agreeable in its Figure, Squar'd like a moſt Exquiſite Piece of Architect, both for Ornament, Strength, and Uſefulneſs; They would have ſeen it a Compleat Circle, all the Lines of which were drawn from, and depended upon one General Centre, the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good, a Mighty Arch, every Stone of which mutually contribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not to its Private Support only, but to the Strength of the whole: Here is the True Original of the Union, and the Wiſdom of the Treaters on both ſides, was in nothing more Conſpicuous, than that they came to this Treaty furniſhed with the true Notions of what they were to do, and conſequently the propereſt and only Method for the doing it could not be Concealed from them; and we cannot but obſerve, That, thro' all the Courſe of the Treaty, the Gentlemen kept themſelves cloſs to this Principle, to yield to one another in every thing, which the Nature of the Union they aim'd at requir'd, and the Nature of the Thing before them would poſſibly permit.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs, to me, all the Notions of Federal Unions, Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantees, and Everlaſting Peace, which our ſeveral Writers fill'd our Heads with, while the Treaty was appointed, but not yet begun; appear'd to me as imperfect <hi>Embrios,</hi> falſe Conceptions, and Births that muſt end in Abortions and Diſappointments; I will not ſay, I had Foreſight of Events enough to preſcribe what Methods ſhould be taken, or what Iſſue would be produced from the Treaty then in View; but this I took the Freedom always to tell the World, That it muſt be a general, compleat, intire and indiſſolvable Union of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts and Parties, depending upon Equalities of Privileges, and Equalities of Burdens, Equalities of Proſpects, and Equalities, if poſſible, in Deſires, or that it would be Imperfect in its Parts, and Confuſed in its Whole.</p>
            <p>I know one Reaſon why this ſort of Union was leſs thought on, than perhaps it would have been, was, becauſe the Gentlemen, when they come to Examine what had ever been Attempted this way, found nothing of a full and intire Union, but that under the Conqueſt of the Parliament Times—; And, <hi>Alas! SAYS ONE,</hi> This muſt be rendered ſo Odious, becauſe 'twas the Work of a Tyrant, an Uſurper, and what not, that no Body could bear to Recommend it; and if at any time a Man was driven by the Neceſſity of his
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0554400100:105"/>
Judgment, the Convictions of his Reaſon, and the Conſequences of Argument, to come to the Borders of that Scheme, he would Start at the Hint, as if he had ſeen a <hi>Spectrum,</hi> and fly even from his own Reaſon, becauſe it concurr'd with what was hit upon by the Man and the People he did not Approve.</p>
            <p>And why will you go by <hi>Whitehall</hi> Gentlemen, where ſo many wicked Rebels Triumph'd over their Monarch? Why will you uſe the Navy, nay ſome of the very Ships, with which the ſame <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> Beat your Neighbours?</p>
            <p>If <hi>Oliver</hi> had not been a Maſter of Politicks, he had never been <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> in the Terms we are now Talking of him; and becauſe he hit upon the only Step that could be taken to Fix the Union of the two Nations, muſt we Reject it, and rather Deſtroy the Kingdoms, than cloſe with his Unhallowed Method?</p>
            <p>Reaſon and the Nature of Things guides all Men, whoſe Eyes are open, to the ſame Methods, when they are purſuing the ſame Deſigns, let <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> be what he will, and who he will, 'tis no part of my Buſineſs here, take him in all the Blackeſt Figures he can be Repreſented—; What was the End he purſued in his Uniting <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>England</hi>—? It was ſo to joyn them, that both Parties being made intirely eaſy, might, without Heſitation, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves to his otherwiſe precarious Authority; and was he right in this, That, to give the two Nations a free and full Communication, both of Trade, Privileges and Advantages, was the true and only way to make all People eaſie—? So far his Project may be good for us, without ſo much as touching upon the Parallel.</p>
            <p>The Buſineſs of the Union was, to make the Nations eaſie, to put them in a State of Mutual Advantage; If fourty Tyrants have purſued the Method for it, tho' with Wicked Deſigns, it was for us to take the Method, and mend the Deſign, as much as we could.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> made a Conqueſt of <hi>Scotland</hi>—, well, and what then—? Let thoſe People, who have Talk'd ſo much of an Union of Subjection, and Conquering <hi>Scotland,</hi> go back hither for a Precedent; <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> knew as well what belong'd to Conqueſt, as any Body in this Age will pretend to; Nor was he leſs Politick in Keeping, than Terrible in Obtaining; and what did he reſolve all his Northern Conqueſt into—? Nothing but Union, the beſt Concerted, the beſt Executed, the beſt Approved, that ever this Iſland ſaw till now; Nor could all the Heads in Chriſtendom have Formed the preſent Happy Union, but from the Schemes of thoſe Times.</p>
            <p>If ever Nation gain'd by being Conquer'd, it was here; They were Subdued firſt, and then made Happy; and <hi>Scotland</hi> Flouriſhed, Juſtice had its Uninterrupted Courſe, Trade Increas'd, Money plentifully Flowed in, and all under what they call'd Tyranny and Uſurpation, all under a Standing Army, Government, and with all the Diſadvantages that can be imagined from ſuch a Conſtitution, as tended to Subjection, not Liberty, Poverty and Miſery, not Peace and Plenty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0554400100:106"/>
And what was the Foundation of all this? Nothing but the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Product of Common Reaſoning, he found, that the only way to preſerve the Conqueſt he had made on the Powers of the Nations, was to make a Conqueſt of their Affections; That the only way to do this, was to let them ſee their Intereſt and Happineſs in his Government; and that this could only be brought to paſs, by Uniting and intirely Incorporating the Nations into one; Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating Peace, Privileges, and all poſſible Advantages to them—; And thereby letting them ſee the true way to their proſperity.</p>
            <p>No Man will ſay, this was not the moſt Politick Step he could take; and muſt we Contemn the Method, becauſe we cannot be Reconcil'd to the Man—? Certainly if Union and Incorporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Intereſts was able to make the Nation Happy under a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Army, and an Abſolute Government, as that was; Things in their Nature, Inconſiſtent with Liberty and National Proſperity; it muſt be much more Capable under a Juſt and Limited Government, where Law Governs the very Actions of the Sovereign, and all the Branches of Power are ſquar'd by, and ſincerely Imploy'd for the Publick Good: And it can be no Leſſening the Value of any True Scheme of National Management, that a Perſon Uſed or Contriv'd it, that we call a Tyrant or an Uſurper; Let him be never ſo much a Tyrant, he ſhow'd he had the True Spirit of Government in him by this, that he knew the only way to make his Government ſafe, was to make it eaſy; and to have the People quiet, was to make them Happy—; And this he did by <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> an intire In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated Union—; And the Event proved, his Meaſures were rightly taken.</p>
            <p>Our End is now the ſame, tho' our Views are differing, to make the People Happy is the End—; If <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> be the way, why is it to be liked the worſe, becauſe <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> drew the Scheme?</p>
            <p>I have made this Digreſſion, not purely to ſhow, how our Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers came to be miſtaken in their Schemes, and why they never hit upon this Draught in all their Propoſals, tho' that introduc'd it; but alſo to prove, that this Intire Incoporating Union has in it ſelf the Seed of National Felicity, in that it wrought then that Wonder which the World can rarely produce, <hi>viz.</hi> Liberty in Tyranny, Proſperity in Conqueſt, and a Nation Saved even in being Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued.</p>
            <p>Could it produce this Wonderful Effect, much more muſt it be ſuppoſed Capable now? And I am perſwaded, no Man in his Senſes will like the Effect of the preſent Union the worſe, for its receiving any of its parts from the Politicks of theſe Times, if the Happineſs of the preſent Time may be ſeen in it.</p>
            <p>And here I muſt own, That the preſent Union has ſome Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, <hi>tho' the Nations have paid dear for the Experiment,</hi> in that it has been Formed upon the Foot of all the moſt Politick Schemes of former Times; and all the Miſcarriages of former Treaties have been as Warnings to Furniſh the Experience of theſe Times
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0554400100:107"/>
to make them wary, and inſtruct them how to avoid the Rocks that others Split on.</p>
            <p>I have now brought the Treaters to <hi>London;</hi> Their Names, and the Commiſſion for them reſpectively to Treat, I have Inſerted in the Minutes of the Treaty, as it was laid before the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and immediately following this Part.</p>
            <p>When they firſt met, they hardly knew what Meaſures they ſhould take; They knew what Buſineſs they came to do, but I dare ſay, the Gentlemen will bear with me, in ſaying, they could not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee the Manner and Management that follow'd; and it was a pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Surprize, to find all Sides and Parties to agree, in leaving all Politick Methods formerly ſtudied, rather to Delay and Defeat the Deſign of an Union, than to Compleat it; and to fall in heartily to Conſider, as the General <hi>Theſis,</hi> what could Conduce moſt to the Main Deſign of their Meeting, <hi>THE <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NION;</hi> And in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to this, they Reſolved not to Study Advantages againſt one another; nor to Demand on either Side any Thing, but what was agreeable to both Kingdoms, in their United Capacity; This was a Happy Indication, That both Sides came together with a True Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Union among them; That they ſincerely intended to apply themſelves to it with the utmoſt Diligence, and to purſue it by all the moſt proper Methods to bring it to paſs—; The very contrary Extreme of which, is what, as I have already noted, has been the principal Occaſion of the Miſcarriage of all the former Treaties, and which Good Men were very much afraid of now—.</p>
            <p>Before they met in Publick, ſome of the Commiſſioners on both Sides had a Meeting among themſelves, privately to Conſider of the Method of Proceeding.</p>
            <p>And here it was firſt Debated, in what Manner Propoſals ſhould be Delivered and Receiv'd; Some were for having Conferences of every Thing that ſhould be propoſed, for the Convenience of Free Reaſoning; Others Objected againſt that as Tedious, and Offered as the moſt Expeditious Method, That every Thing ſhould be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in Writing, and then the Commiſſioners reſpectively Meeting apart, might Reaſon among themſelves, and give in their Reſolutions the more perfect—; And this was agreed on by both parties.</p>
            <p>This is the Cauſe, That, in the Minutes of this Treaty, we have little of their private Reaſonings Recorded; ſince, their having been thus by themſelves, they have not been noticed ſo, as to come to Light in any Regular Manner.</p>
            <p>There was but one Publick Conference, which was Deſir'd by the Commiſſioners for <hi>Scotland;</hi> and this was about the Number of the <hi>Scots</hi> Repreſentatives in Parliament; and in this 'tis impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to get the particular Arguments uſed on both Sides. The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons on either Side were as follows,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> the Lord Treaſurer of <hi>England,</hi> who Opened the Thing, and Deſir'd the Commiſſioners for <hi>Scotland</hi> to propoſe their Reaſons, why the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould give a greater Number than was mentioned.</p>
            <p>Lord Chancellor of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſpoke next, and gave Reaſons why they Inſiſted upon a greater Number.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0554400100:108"/>
Mr. Secretary <hi>Harley</hi> Replyed to Lord Chancellor of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord Chancellor Spoke a Second Time, in Anſwer to Mr. Secretary <hi>Harley.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> Spoke after, to what the Lord Chancellor had offered.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Stair</hi> Replyed to the Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi>'s Speech.</p>
            <p>The Lord Keeper ſpoke next.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>David Dalrymple</hi> Follow'd the Lord Keeper.</p>
            <p>Duke of <hi>Devonſhire</hi> to Sir <hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Mr. <hi>Seton</hi> of <hi>Pitmedden</hi> Concluded.</p>
            <p>The great Deſign of the Arguments on the part of the <hi>Scots</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, were ſumm'd up in this;</p>
            <p>That they could have no Precedent, as to Number of Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives, Argued from <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi>'s Diviſion; becauſe he was Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary, and neither gave a juſt Repreſentation to <hi>England,</hi> or to <hi>Ireland;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the preſent Scheme of Taxes could not be the Rule; but, if the Repreſentative was to be Meaſur'd by the Proportion of Taxes, it was on their Side; ſince, immediately upon the Union, thoſe Taxes would be greater;</p>
            <p>That, if any Rule could be laid down, it ought to be an Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metical Proportion, between the Number of People and the Taxes paid, Conſidered on both Sides reſpectively; In which Caſe, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were brought as an Example, where, if you take the People, without their Circumſtances of Wealth, they Bear no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, becauſe their Riches are vaſtly greater than their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; If their Riches are taken without their People, the Diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion would be as great the other way.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole it was Concluded, there could be no certain Rule, to Direct their Lordſhips the Commiſſioners, but the preſent Circumſtances of the Nations ſhould be Judg'd of by both Sides, and ſuch a Repreſentative to be Allow'd, as ſhould be Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Juſtice in both.</p>
            <p>Upon this Debate, their Lordſhips Retired on either Hand; and the next Day, the Commiſſioners for <hi>England</hi> brought in a Propoſal for a Repreſentative for <hi>Scotland,</hi> Augmented to Fourty Five Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners, and Sixteen Lords, which the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſc'd in, as will more particularly appear by the Minutes of the Treaty, which are inſerted at large, as they were Extracted out of the Books of the Commiſſioners, and beginning with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions reſpectively given to the Perſons Appointed to Treat, as follows.</p>

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0554400100:117"/>
us the ſame Sentiments, which ſo lately appeared in the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> when they took care to manifeſt by a ſolemn Act, that they did poſtpone all other Conſiderations to their evidencing a good and Friendly Diſpoſition towards the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> in making that unexpected Advance, ſeem'd Reſolved, if poſſible, to attain that Union, which hath been ſo long thought neceſſary, by all that wiſh well to the Proſperity of both Nations.</p>
                                    <p>And We moſt ſincerely aſſure your Lordſhips, That we accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly meet your Lordſhips, with Hearts fully Reſolv'd to uſe our outmoſt Endeavours to remove all Difficulties in this Treaty, to prevent all Miſunderſtandings, to cheriſh and Improve the Good Diſpoſitions to one another we meet with, to have the General and Joynt Good of both Kingdoms, ſolely in our View, and not the ſeparate of either; but to Act, as if we were already United in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and had nothing left to Conſider, but what Settlements and Proviſions are moſt likely to conduce to the common Safety and Happineſs of this whole Iſland of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>

                                    <p>Which Meaſures, if purſued on both Parts, we hope may enable us to prepare ſuch Terms of Union, as may prove ſatisfactory to Her Majeſty, and the Parliaments of both Kingdoms.</p>

                                    <p>THe Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>Scotland,</hi> have deſired me to Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure your Lordſhips, that they meet you on this Occaſion, with great Willingneſs and Satisfaction, to Treat of an Union between the two Kingdoms, and of ſuch other Matters and Concerns, as may be for Her Majeſties Honour, and the maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Good Underſtanding between the two Nations.</p>
                                    <p>We are convinced that an Union will be of a great Advantage to both; the Proteſtant Religion will be thereby the more Firmly Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured; the Deſigns of our Enemies effectually Diſappointed; and the Riches and Trade of the whole Iſland Advanced.</p>
                                    <p>This Union has been often Endeavour'd, both before, and ſince the Kingdoms were United in Allegiance under one Sovereign; and ſeveral Treaties have been ſet on foot for that End, tho without the deſired Succeſs; But now we are hopeful that this ſhall be the Happy Opportunity of Accompliſhing it; Her Majeſty hath fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſignify'd Her Good Inclinations towards it; And we are the more Encouraged to expect Succeſs in this Treaty, by the Good Diſpoſition appeared in the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> for it, and by the Friendly proceedings in the laſt Seſſion of the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> which gave general ſatisfaction.</p>
                                    <p>

We have great Confidence in your Lordſhips Good Intentions, and we ſhall be ready on our parts, to enter into ſuch Meaſures with you, as may bring the Treaty to ſuch a Concluſion, as may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to Her Majeſty, and to the Parliaments of both Kingdoms.</p>

                              <p>THE Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>England</hi> are ſo fully convinced, that nothing but an Entire Union of the two Kingdoms, will ſettle perfect and laſting Friendſhip between them; That they therefore think fit to decline entring into any further Conſideration of the Propoſal now made by the Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>Scotland,</hi> as not tending to that End and Deſire; That the Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>Scotland</hi> would be pleaſed to give in their Anſwer, to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal delivered on <hi>Munday</hi> the 22<hi>d</hi> inſtant by the Lords Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners for <hi>England,</hi> in order to an entire Union of both Kingdoms.</p>

                              <head>OBSERVATIONS on the <hi>MINUTS</hi> of the three firſt Days.</head>
                              <p>The Ceremonies on either Hand being over, <hi>Wedneſday</hi> was the firſt Day in which it may be ſaid, any thing of Buſineſs was entred upon.</p>
                              <p>The Commiſſioners on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſide preſented a Summary, as it may be call'd, of an Union in General, by which it is plain, a compleat Incorporation of the two Kingdoms was propoſed.</p>
                              <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> Propoſal was leſs General, and yet readily agreeing to the Succeſſion, to a Communication of Privileges, and an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Trade.</p>
                              <p>I mention this here, becauſe it was afterwards objected to the Treaters on the <hi>Scots</hi> ſide in the following Parliament, That
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0554400100:120"/>
they had given up their Countrey to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in coming into an Incorporating Union immediately, without propoſing any Terms which might have been more Advantageous to <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>It is manifeſt the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners did make Propoſals of Uniting, which were not Incorporating; or at leaſt, which being reſtricted to their own Countrey only, were ſignificant of a Concern for <hi>Scotland,</hi> leaving the Propoſal on the behalf of <hi>England,</hi> to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſſioners.</p>
                              <p>But, as will appear in the ſubſequent Minuts, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commſſioners were come to a Reſolution previous to this Treaty, <hi>viz.</hi> That nothing could compleat the Felicity of either King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and for ever remove all poſſible Difficulties, Breaches, and Separation of Intereſts from among them for the future, but an entire and Incorporating Union, by which the two Nations ſhould be formed into one Government, be under one Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Head, in one Repreſented Body, ſtanding upon one Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, enjoying equal Privileges, and in common bearing one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral proportion of Burdens, the ſame in End and Mean, having but one Common Intereſt, one Name, and being for ever here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after but one People.</p>
                              <p>This therefore they laid down as the <hi>Theſis</hi> of their future Conferences, and purſuant to this, the firſt General they delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in, contain'd the Three and moſt Eſſential Articles of the following Treaty, <hi>viz.</hi> The Uniting the Two Kingdoms into One, the ſettling the Repreſentation in one Aſſembly of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and the ſettling the Succeſſion in the ſame Line.</p>
                              <p>And the <hi>Scots</hi> Propoſals being ſhort in the General Incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating Part, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſſioners inſiſted upon it, as above, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to Treat upon Particulars till that was firſt Determin'd, all Debate of Particulars being not ſo directly tending to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, till the great and main Queſtion was Agreed to, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Union ſhould be Entire or no, in the ſenſe as above.</p>
                              <p>The proſecuting this Queſtion will effectually Defend the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners, who tho they were afterward convinc'd of the main Point in Debate, <hi>viz.</hi> That nothing but an Entire Union would be effectual to ſettle a laſting Friendſhip between the two Nations, yet did not ſo eaſily give up their other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals, as was ſuggeſted; nor did they give them up at all meerly upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſſioners refuſing to Treat on any other Foot—. For the directeſt Anſwer to a Reſolution ſo poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive as that might have been thought to have been an equal Stiffneſs, and refuſing to reſolve upon ſo general a Clauſe, till other Heads had been Adjuſted.</p>
                              <p>But the Commiſſioners on the <hi>Scots</hi> ſide found themſelves convinc'd, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Of the Sincerity and candid Intentions of the Commiſſioners on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Part, to purſue ſuch a Treaty, and in ſuch a manner, as might moſt conduce to the mutual Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0554400100:121"/>
of both Kingdoms, and to make the Union both Laſting and Effectual.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Secondly,</hi> They found themſelves convinc'd upon ſerious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate and further Enquiry into Particulars, that nothing but this Incorporation of Intereſts, Privileges, and Circumſtances, could make an Effectual, Laſting, Indiſſolvable Union, and ſo they came unto it with the ſame Sincerity, and from the ſame candid Deſign of ſettling the whole, and of Acting to the advantage of Either Party—. Not being at all Over-ruled, Awed, or Drawn in, as was objected afterwards againſt them—. And this would appear at large, if the long Debates, Speeches, and Arguments on both Sides could have been recover'd.</p>

                              <p>The main Points of Union being thus ſettled, as above, and all the Federal Provincial and Confederating Schemes, which the World without Doors had filled their Heads with, being va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd, the Commiſſioners fell cloſs to their Work; and the firſt Article propoſed by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſſioners laid the Scheme of the whole Affair, <hi>viz.</hi> Cuſtoms, Exciſes, and Temporary Taxes, Prohibitions, Reſtrictions, and Regulations of Trade.</p>
                              <p>The great Queſtion now before them was, how to fix a Center in all theſe, or a great Standart of Equalities, ſo as every part might bear its equal Share of the Burdens of the War, in Proportion to its Capacity, and every part enjoy its equal Share of the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of Commerce, each bear an equal part of the Weight of the Government, and reap an equal part of its Protection. This Scale of Equalities had a great Variety of Diſcording Parts in it; To bring together the Difficulties of which was the Buſineſs now before them, and the Method of Reconciling them, will appear in the further Obſervations on theſe Proceedings.</p>
                              <p>The firſt thing requiſit to bring this Matter into a way of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, was for either ſide to give in a True State of the ordinary Revenue, the Debts and the Extraordinary Taxes of either King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that a Scale of Proportions might be formed.</p>
                              <p>I mention it here, to note how naturally every thing occurr'd, in order to the main End; and how, after the firſt Conceſſion of an entire Incorporation, every thing, that might tend to Compleating that Deſign, came in of Courſe; For, without doubt, Equalities and Proportion of Taxes, Privileges and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, was, and muſt be the only Method, to bring about a compleat entire Union of Intereſts, and it was impoſſible to be done without it.</p>
                              <p>The Undertaking indeed Amazed the World, and when People began to look into it with but a Tranſient View, it appeared a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0554400100:125"/>
perfect <hi>Chaos,</hi> a Maſs of Abſurdities, which it would be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to Reconcile; The People, who had propoſed their Fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Schemes, laugh'd at this Project, and talk'd of it as impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, called it a <hi>Chimera</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miniſtery, and pretended to Propheſy its Dwindling into Nothing, and bringing the Treaty to the ſame Iſſue, as was done in the laſt Commiſſion.</p>
                              <p>But, when Abler Heads began to look into it, and take it to Pieces, the Parts all appear'd capable of Reduction into Form, and the Preſages of the Gentlemen who had ſo Banter'd it, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd groundleſs, the Maſs began to move, and every thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring to its proper place, guided by the Temper, Moderation, and Application of the Commiſſioners, the Beautiful Thing, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Union, began to ſhew it ſelf, and the Nation began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Hopes of its being perfected, in ſpight of all the ſeeming Difficulties, with which the Enemies to the Deſign had clog'd Mens Expectation—, as will appear hereafter.</p>
                              <p>To bring the Ballance of Circumſtances upon the Stage, it was abſolutely neceſſary to enter into the ſeveral Inequalities, in which the two Kingdoms then ſtood; Theſe Inequalities, as they lay particularly before the Treaters, conſiſted in Matters of Taxes, Cuſtoms, Exciſes and Commerce.</p>
                              <p>In order to ſtate theſe, the ſeveral Debts and Revenue of the reſpective Nations were ſtated; Abſtracts of which are annexed to theſe Obſervations, as they were given in to the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of both Kingdoms.</p>

<list>
                                    <item>1. <hi>England</hi> had very large Incomes or Revenues, and their Cuſtoms and Exciſe brought in vaſt Sums, <hi>viz.</hi>

<list>
                                    <item>2. <hi>Scotland</hi> had but ſmall Revenues, her Cuſtoms and Exciſe producing but the following Sums, <hi>viz.</hi>
                                       <list>

                              <p>Now, upon the Uniting the Revenues of both Kingdoms, under theſe differing Circumſtances, there were but two poſſible Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods that could be propoſed;
<list>
                                    <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0554400100:127"/>
                                    <item>Either, 1. That each Kingdom coming to a full Point in Matters of Revenue, ſhould, like two Tradeſmen coming into Partnerſhip, pay off their own reſpective Debts, and bring in their ſeveral Proportions of Stock clear of all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumberances.</item>
                                    <item>Or, 2. That, putting the General Accounts of Debts and Stock together, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould make good the Inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities to the <hi>Scots</hi> ſome other way.</item>
                                 </list>
                              </p>
                              <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners wiſely propoſed, for the Eaſe of their own Country, That the Revenues of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould not be at all Chargeable with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Debts—; And this was thought to be a very good Argument, to Excuſe <hi>Scotland</hi> from ſome Duties, which, notwithſtanding the General Article of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Equal Taxes, <hi>Scotland</hi> could by no means bear; Of theſe, as they reſpect Cuſtoms or Exciſes, Foreign or Home Trade, I ſhall ſpeak as they come in Order.</p>
                              <p>But the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſſioners adhering to the firſt Principle of the Treaty, <hi>viz.</hi> Of its being an intire Incorporating Union, were on that Account obliged to inſiſt upon this alſo, which formed afterward, the Sixth Article, <hi>viz.</hi> That there be an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality of <hi>Cuſtoms, Exciſes,</hi> and all other Taxes thro'out the United Kingdom, as that without which the Union could not be entire.</p>
                              <p>This being laid down as a general <hi>Theſis</hi> in the whole Debate, two things came in Courſe to be Examined as <hi>Mediums.</hi>
                                 <list>
                                    <item>1. A Scale of Proportions to form the Equalities.</item>
                                    <item>2. An Equivalent to be given for ſupplying unavoidable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equalities.</item>
                                 </list>
                              </p>
                              <p>And this will be found to run thro' the whole Series of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as the Foundation of the whole; and however after Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cul'd and Reflected on by the Oppoſers of the Treaty, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be the only Foundation they could have gone upon, and which was the only <hi>Medium</hi> to bring the Treaty into a poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of coming to a happy Concluſion.</p>
                              <p>No Man could deny but all Equalities conſiſted in Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to have extended the thing called Equality of Taxes, to a Numerical Equality, as ſome pretend in <hi>England,</hi> was ſaying nothing, the Cuſtoms, manner of Valuation of Land, and innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Circumſtances of <hi>Scotland,</hi> rendering it Impracticable.</p>
                              <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſsioners therefore when they inſiſted upon an Equality of Taxes, readily agreed to the giving <hi>Scotland</hi> an Equivalent for the payment of their own Debts, ſo far as their Cuſtoms and Exciſes ſhould come into the Appropriations of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Revenue.</p>
                              <p>What Alterations, Exceptions, and Abatements were made as to Equalities of Taxes, will be ſpoken to in the Minutes of the <hi>Scots</hi> Parliament, where the Exceptions were made, and thoſe Calculations Adjuſted.</p>

                              <p>The Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſince the laſt General Meeting, have again conſidered the Propoſition made by the Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>England</hi> the 29<hi>th April</hi> laſt, <hi>viz.</hi> That there be the ſame Cuſtoms, Exciſes and all other Taxes; and the ſame Prohibitions, Reſtrictions and Regulations of Trade thro'-out the United Kingdom of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> with the Papers which have been ſince delivered by the Commiſſioners of both Kingdoms upon that Subject, and do with great Satisfaction Obſerve, that the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, as to that Important Propoſal, is brought to a very narrow Compaſs.

                              <p>The Commiſſioners were now entered upon the great Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry about Equalities, and the firſt Matter relating to Taxes was that of the Land Tax; The Land Tax in <hi>England</hi> was a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable Thing, being called a Tax of Four Shillings in the Pound of the Rent of Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the People who were Fond of Throwing a Tangled Skein in the Hands of the Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that might Shock them at the beginning, would have gone upon that Foot, alledging, That tho' the Rents in <hi>Scotland</hi> were differing from thoſe in <hi>England;</hi> yet that 20 <hi>ſh. ſterl.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue being the ſame thing any where, it could as well afford to pay 4 <hi>ſh.</hi> out of it in <hi>Scotland</hi> as any where elſe; and upon this Foot, it ſeems, were for bringing the Rents of Land in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to a true Eſtimate, and ſo they would call this way of Taxing an Equality.</p>
                              <p>But to this it was Anſwer'd, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the <hi>Scots</hi> way of Collecting their Taxes, being rigorous and exact, if 4 <hi>s. per l.</hi> were laid by Parliament upon the whole Iſland, their Aſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments would <hi>bona fide</hi> be 4 <hi>s. per l.</hi> upon the Rack Rent of all their Lands.</p>
                              <p>Whereas 4 <hi>s. per l.</hi> in <hi>England</hi> never puts the Aſſeſſors out of their old Road, but every County being Rated in the very Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Act, the Title is <hi>Ipſo Facto</hi> Repeal'd, ſince if the Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of that Country will raiſe the Money by an Aſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of 1 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d. per</hi> Pound, <hi>and 'tis known ſome do for leſs,</hi> the Law is ſatisfied, and the End anſwered.</p>
                              <p>Now to Tax <hi>Scotland</hi> at 4 <hi>s. per l.</hi> upon her Nett Rent, and Tax the Northern and Weſtern Counties of <hi>England</hi> but at ſo much Money, which they can raiſe by a Proportion of 16 <hi>d.</hi> to 20 <hi>d.</hi> at moſt <hi>per l.</hi> would be unreaſonable.</p>
                              <p>So that it was plain, <hi>Scotland</hi> could not be Taxed at a Pound Rate, but at a Proportioned Summ, leaving them to the Diviſion of it, to raiſe it as they ſee fit.</p>
                              <p n="2">II. The Sum charg'd upon Lands in <hi>England,</hi> after it is le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied and raiſed from the Tenant, ſtands charg'd with large De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0554400100:133"/>
and Charges, upon the Levying, Collecting, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving; and thoſe Charges, if ſome Calculations are right, amount to little leſs than 9 <hi>d. per l.</hi> upon the Money receiv'd, beſides publick Loſſes by the Inſolvency of Receivers and their Securities, which oftentimes runs deep into the Money; and which tho' they cannot be brought into an exact Account, yet put all together, 12 <hi>d. per</hi> Pound may at leaſt very well be Charg'd upon the whole, as an Off-Reckoning or Diſcount up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Money, between the Collection and Exchequer.</p>
                              <p>This 12 <hi>d. per</hi> Pound upon the Money Collected is 2 <hi>d.</hi> 8/20 <hi>per</hi> Pound upon all the Rents in <hi>England,</hi> and amounts in every Land Tax to near a Hundred Thouſand Pound <hi>Sterling.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Now as on the other hand, the <hi>Scots</hi> Collect all their Tax at their own Charges, clear of all Loſſes, Deficiencies or Defalca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and pay it in Nett to the Exchequer or Publick Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to Charge them by the ſame Numerical Equality with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> would be to make them pay their Taxes clear of Charge, and bear part of the Expence and Loſs in Collecting ours.</p>
                              <p n="3">III. Differing Cuſtoms and Manners of paying Rent, and letting out Lands in the two Kingdoms, make a Numerical Equality Impracticable.</p>
                              <p>In <hi>England</hi> the Rents are paid in Mony, in <hi>Scotland</hi> they are, generally ſpeaking, paid in Kind, or Victual, as they call it: Now tho' 'tis true this may, and is, in ſome reſpect, brought to a Head by a General Valuation, yet, with this Difference, againſt a <hi>Scots</hi> Landlord to an <hi>Engliſh, viz.</hi> That the <hi>Scots</hi> Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord ſtays two Terms, and runs two Riſques in his receiving the Rent of his Land.</p>
                              <p>Firſt he ſtays the Term agreed to receive of his Tenant, and ſecondly he truſts the Merchant a ſecond Term, to whom he ſells the Produce he receives of his Tenant; in the ſame Senſe he runs two Hazards; one in the Solvency of the Tenant, and the other of the Merchant; which makes a conſiderable Difference in the Eſſential Value of the Rent, and conſequently of the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of ſuch an Eſtate; and tho' the Purchaſe or Real Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of Lands in <hi>Scotland</hi> may not come into this Diſpute; yet were an Eſtate let in <hi>England</hi> to pay the Rent in Kind, it would ſell for much leſs than an Eſtate of the ſame Value paid in Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: Nor would it be Tax'd at near ſo much in our Common Aſſeſſment.</p>
                              <p n="4">IV. The Difference in letting Lands in <hi>England,</hi> which are in many Places fin'd down, and the ſtated Rents reduc'd, makes another Variation: Whereas in <hi>Scotland</hi> Lands are let without Leaſes, or but on ſhort Terms, and at a Rack-Rent; any Man that knows what belongs to Letting or Taking Lands in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> cannot be ignorant—, That the Landlord, letting a long Leaſe to the Tenant, confining him to ſuch and ſuch Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, makes frequent Conſiderations in the Rent, and ſo the Land being Taxed by the Rent, is Taxed under the Value.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0554400100:134"/>
On the other hand, ſhould this Article of 4 <hi>s. per l.</hi> be inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on in the literal Sence, and the <hi>Scots</hi> come to conſider how to avoid it, by Fining down Rents and other Advantageous Methods, which they may eaſily find out, they might ſoon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the Act, and pay little or nothing; and this would be an Evil hard to diſcover; and if found out, almoſt impoſſible to cure.</p>
                              <p>From theſe Reaſons it was plain, a Numerical or Arithmetical Equality could not be the Foundation of thoſe Debates—; But as it was very well Stiled, it behoved to be a Geometrical Equality, founded on a Scale of Proportions, and that Scale for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med upon due Conſiderations, not of real Value only, but of Circumſtances and Proſpects of either Kingdom.</p>
                              <p>A ſecond Calculate was then propoſed from the Proportion which <hi>Scotland</hi> was oblig'd to pay under <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> who having reduc'd <hi>Scotland</hi> by Arms, Incorporated them into one Body with this Nation; and by this Incorporation they were Rated at 6000 <hi>l. per</hi> Month in their Land Tax, when <hi>England</hi> was Rated at 70000 <hi>l. per</hi> Month.</p>
                              <p>It alſo appears by the ſame Calculation, that <hi>Scotland</hi> paid this 6000 <hi>l. per</hi> Month, when <hi>England</hi> paid but 35000 <hi>l. per</hi> Month.</p>
                              <p>Now to apply this Calculation to the preſent caſe, the Land Tax in <hi>England</hi> in time of War, at 4 <hi>s. per l.</hi> is ſuppos'd to raiſe two Millions <hi>ſterling.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> paying 6000 to <hi>Englands</hi> 35000 <hi>per</hi> Month, which is ſomething leſs than a ſixth part; By the ſame Rule in two Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions <hi>per Annum,</hi> which the ſaid Land Tax raiſes, they muſt be chargeable with 333333. 6. 8. <hi>per Annum,</hi> Land Tax.</p>
                              <p>But this Arbitray difference which <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> and his Parliament made; as is obſerv'd, was, <hi>In conſideration that</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>had, for Divers years paſt, been at almoſt all the Expence of War;</hi> Yet ſtill, at the former Calculation, <hi>Scotland</hi> would in a four Shilling Aid, pay half that Sum, <hi>viz.</hi> 166666. 13. 4. <hi>per Annum.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Now to examine the Rents of each Kingdom, the Annual Rents of Lands in <hi>Scotland,</hi> muſt by the firſt Calculation, amount to One Million, Six Hundred, Sixty Six Thouſand, Six Hundred, Sixty Six Pound, Thirteen and Four Pence Sterling, <hi>per Annum,</hi> and by the laſt Calculation juſt half the Money.</p>
                              <p>Both which Sums it was alleaged are far wide of an Equality, and far beyond what <hi>Scotland</hi> is able to raiſe.</p>
                              <p>I am the larger on this Head, that Poſterity may ſee the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why theſe Calculations were made, and have the Arguments preſerved for their uſe, if it be Diſputed hereafter, why <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ſhould pay ſo ſmall a Proportion in the Land Taxes or four Shilling Aid, and which may help others to Defend <hi>Scotland</hi> againſt future Attempts, to enlarge their Expences.</p>
                              <p>The next thing was to Examine what was, or what might be counted a due Equality; and here it will be neceſſary to enter
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0554400100:135"/>
a little into the ſhort Hiſtory of Taxes in <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſince the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration; which, bringing it down to the preſent Time, may ſerve as a Rule to this Matter.</p>
                              <p>Anciently the levying Money upon Land in <hi>Scotland,</hi> was called in General <hi>the Taxation;</hi> and the manner of levying it was by Rules altogether obſolete and now grown out of Uſe, as the Cuſtom of Tenths, Fifteenths, Subſidies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are in <hi>England.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>The now Method of Taxing Land has its beginning, as to Practice, in the Aſſeſſment of 6000 <hi>l. per</hi> Month, ſettle in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s time, when an Union was actually form'd and ſettled between the Nations; of which, however deficient in it ſelf, without doubt this may be ſaid, that it had in it the Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Parts, and might be modell'd into a compleat Coalition.</p>
                              <p>This is the Tax they now go by in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and is called there THE CESS, by which is underſtood <hi>a Month's Aſſeſſment;</hi> 'tis raiſed upon Land by a Method peculiarly exact, and I have never heard any one complain of the Inequality.</p>
                              <p>'Tis raiſed, as is before noted, without any Charge, Deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Defalcation, and is paid <hi>Nett</hi> into the Treaſury.</p>
                              <p>According as the Occaſions of the Government require, this Tax is encreaſed; but then not the Sum <hi>per</hi> Month is encreaſed, but the number of Months are encreaſed, which by the help of time encreaſes the Sum.</p>
                              <p>The Original of the Demand was as before, and of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, but the Continuance of it was thus introduced;</p>
                              <p>In former times, the Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> contented themſelves with the ancient Demeſnes, Crown-Lands, Cuſtoms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and on extraordinary Caſes <hi>the Taxation, as above,</hi> was their Supply, Exciſes of any ſort were altogether unknown, till the Days of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second.</p>
                              <p>King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second in the Year 1661, obtained of the <hi>Scots</hi> to give him a ſettled Sum of 40000 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling during his Life, in conſideration whereof, he promiſed never to demand any Ceſs or <hi>Taxation,</hi> except in time of War, as by the Words of the Act as follows—.</p>

This 40000 <hi>l.</hi> was raiſed by 8000 <hi>l.</hi> laid as Impoſt on Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Importations, and 32000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> on Malt, brewed into Liquor for Sale; but as this was a Novelty and uncertain in its Produce, a Ceſs was granted to make good the Deficiency, which Deficiency generally amounted to 2 Months Ceſs more or leſs, and other Ceſs than this <hi>Scotland</hi> knew none till the Convention 1666, which being a Time of War, a Ceſs was impoſed, but not exceeding 3 Months.</p>
                              <p>Here it may be obſerv'd, That in theſe times the Exciſes and Cuſtoms of <hi>Scotland</hi> could not raiſe 40000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> put together; which I note for the other Uſes which I ſhall make of it hereafter: but to go on with my Hiſtory.</p>
                              <p>From this time to the Year 1678, <hi>Scotland</hi> had no more Ceſs, nor was at any Charge more than to make good the Deficiency of the 40000 <hi>l.</hi> mentioned before; except 3 Months Ceſs during the <hi>Dutch</hi> War, expiring at <hi>Candlemas,</hi> 1674:</p>
                              <p>About this time, the Nation being very unhappily divided into Parties, had the Misfortune, not only to have a Religious Diviſion, but a Court Diviſion alſo; and People ſtrove at any Price to oblige the Sovereign in giving up their Priviledges and Liberties to be trampled on by Arbitrary Deſigns.

                              <p>Thus poor <hi>Scotland</hi> was bought and ſold, and the Example is uſeful for our Obſervation a great many ways; for thus ſhall every Nation be uſed, that is divided into contending Parties, and expos'd to an encroaching Government.</p>
                              <p>But that I may not have ſaid all this foreign to the preſent Purpoſe, it is very obſervable, <hi>and this is the Reaſon of the Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> that this will make one PERIOD for Taxation, <hi>viz.</hi> the

higheſt that an Arbitrary Prince back'd with a Mercenary Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and a Governing Clergy, even in the greateſt Extream of Abſolute Tyranny, ever impos'd upon this Nation, which at that time 'tis evident they deſir'd to ſqueeze, and car'd not if they entirely ruin'd.</p>
                              <p>Come we now to the Revolution, which theſe Exorbitances had no little Influence upon; the firſt thing Tranſacted upon the Meeting of the Eſtates or Convention of <hi>Scotland,</hi> was to break theſe Chains; re-aſſume the Power of raiſing Taxes by Parliament, and make themſelves Judges both of the Occaſion, and of the Sum.</p>
                              <p>However as in <hi>England</hi> ſince the Revolution, greater Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have call'd for immenſe Sums to carry on the War; and ſuch Taxes have been rais'd as were never heard of before; ſo in <hi>Scotland</hi> the Parliament have agreed to ſuch Taxes, as, the aforeſaid Time of Tyranny excepted, were never known in <hi>Scotland</hi> before.</p>
                              <p>Yet, in the carrying on this War, ſix or ſeven Months Ceſs, has, one time with another, been thought <hi>Scotland</hi>'s full Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, and the late KING, excepting one or two Years on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Occaſions, always contented himſelf with it, and this at the ſame time that <hi>England</hi> rais'd 4 <hi>s. per l.</hi> upon their Land; Nor did Queen <hi>Anne</hi> ever demand more of her Subjects in <hi>Scotland,</hi> tho' the Weight of the War was as great as ever, and this was called another PERIOD of Taxation.</p>
                              <p>Now, what was mean't by a Geometrical Scale, or Equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Taxes, is drawn from theſe Proportions.</p>
                              <p>That, ſince exact Valuation of Rents cannot be made on both ſides, and leaſt of all in <hi>England,</hi> it ſeems as good a way to come at this Equality, as any could be propoſed.</p>
                              <p>That the higheſt Period of Taxes that ever <hi>Scotland</hi> bore ſince the Reſtoration, may be taken on one hand, and ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the higheſt Period of Taxes that ever <hi>England</hi> bore, <hi>that is,</hi> of a Land Tax on both ſides; and put theſe together as the Scale of Equality.</p>
                              <p>Thus ſuppoſe the <hi>Scots</hi> 8 Months Ceſs, tho' that was the heighth of Tyrannick Impoſition, and tho' 'tis allowed the <hi>Scots</hi> are manifeſtly impoveriſh'd, and leſs able to bear it than they were; yet ſay, it be full 8 Months Ceſs, and ſet this againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> 4 <hi>s. per l.</hi> it could not be found, that any more juſt Calculation could be made; And the Proportion ſeem'd ſo clear, that every ſide appeared content with it.</p>
                              <p>Thus when ever a Tax upon Land for 4 <hi>s. per</hi> Pound is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the <hi>Scots</hi> pay 8 Months Ceſs, if of 2 <hi>s. per</hi> Pound in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> 4 Months Ceſs; and ſo in Proportion.</p>
                              <p>There were other Calculations offered about that time, but none ſeemed ſo rationally and ſo exactly ſtated to the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the Nations, or built on ſo juſt a Foundation; and therefore it met with leſs Difficulty than was expected, as will appear hereafter.</p>

                              <p>THE Lord Chancellor, in Name of the Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>Scotland,</hi> deliver'd to the Board their Lordſhips Anſwer to the Papers deliver'd by the Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>England</hi> the 15th and 18th Inſtant, which was Read.</p>
                              <p>THE Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>Scotland</hi> have taken into their Conſideration, the Papers delivered by the Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>England</hi> on the 15th and 18th Inſtant, and do underſtand that the Firſt contains all the ſeveral kind of Burthens and Exciſes now in uſe in <hi>England,</hi> beſides thoſe to which the Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>Scotland</hi> have already agreed.</p>
                              <p>And as to the ſeveral particulars contain'd in the ſaid Papers.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. As to Duties on Stampt Paper, Vellom and Parchment, ſeing the Exemption from that Impoſition can have no Influence on Trade or Manufacturies, and that the ſaid Duty does affect the Securities of the Subjects Eſtates, adding likewiſe a new Condition, which being omitted may make their Rights and Titles void: And further conſidering, that the ſaid Duty will be uneaſie to the People, chargeable in collecting, and of ſmall value; The Lords Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners for <hi>Scotland</hi> do propoſe, That the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> be wholly exempted from the ſame, or at leaſt that the Exemption from the ſaid Duties, agreed to by the Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>England</hi> in the ſaid Paper of the 15th Inſtant, be prolong'd beyond the Year 1710, to a certain Period, as to that Moiety which is impoſed for Perpetuity.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. As to the other particular Duties which expire in the Year 1710 or ſooner, from which the Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>England</hi> have agreed, that the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhall be exempted: The Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>Scotland</hi> do underſtand, that it was the Meaning of the Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>England,</hi> to extend that Exemption to the Duty laid on Cynders.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. As to the Duty on Salt; The Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>England</hi> having conſented, that the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhall, for a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent time after the Union, remain Exempted from the payment of that Duty, for all Salt ſpent in kind, or uſed in Proviſions, within the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> provided that the Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould propoſe effectual Methods for ſecuring, that the like Duties as are now payable in <hi>England,</hi> be Paid and Collected in the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> after the Union, as to all Salt Exported from that Kingdom, either in Kind or Proviſions: The Lords Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners for <hi>Scotland</hi> have herewith given in a Scheme of ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations as have occurr'd to them, for ſecuring, that the Duty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd be collected in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as to all Salt Exported from that Kingdom in Kind or Proviſions, and are willing to agree to what other Methods ſhall be propos'd on that behalf by the Lords Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners for <hi>England;</hi> And their Lordſhips are ready to enter with the Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>England,</hi> on the Conſideration of the time to which the ſaid Exemption ſhall be limited; And the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0554400100:141"/>
Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>Scotland</hi> doubt not, but as the Lords Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners for <hi>England</hi> have agreed to the Exemption propos'd from all Burthens or Exciſes now in uſe, but thoſe conſented to by the Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>Scotland,</hi> That the Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>England</hi> will alſo agree, That the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> remain Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from any Duties (except theſe agreed to) which may be laid on by the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> before the Union.</p>
                              <p>AND as to the General Exemption formerly propos'd on the part of <hi>Scotland,</hi> from all other Burtheus than thoſe conſented to for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent time. The Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>Scotland</hi> conſidering what the Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>England</hi> have obſerv'd, that it cannot be ſuppos'd the Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> will ever lay any ſort of Burthens upon the United Kingdom, but what they ſhall find of neceſſity at that time, for the Preſervation and Good of the whole, and with due Regard to the Circumſtances and Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of every part of the United Kingdom. Therefore the Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>Scotland,</hi> to avoid the Difficulty that may ariſe in that Matter, do agree, not to inſiſt further at preſent, but to leave the Continuation of the ſaid Exemption to be determin'd by the Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>AND the Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>Scotland</hi> having, by this and their former Papers, Anſwer'd the Propoſal made by the Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>England</hi> on the 29th <hi>April,</hi> concerning the Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Taxes, The Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>Scotland</hi> take this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to put the Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>England</hi> in mind of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal given in to their Lordſhips the 9th Inſtant, concerning the <hi>Quota</hi> of Land-Tax for the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> not doubting, but that the Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>England</hi> will agree to the ſame.</p>
                              <p>THE Lord Chancellor did alſo, in Name of the Lords Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners for <hi>Scotland,</hi> deliver to the Board the following Propoſal, which was read.</p>
                              <p>PROPOSAL for the effectual preventing the Exportation of <hi>Scots</hi> Salt to <hi>England,</hi> or the Plantations, without paying the ſame Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, with which <hi>Engliſh</hi> Salt is charg'd, during the Exemption al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to <hi>Scotland</hi> from the ſaid Duty.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. THAT no Salt be Tranſported from <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>England</hi> by Land, under the Penalty of Forfeiting the Salt and the Horſes uſed in Tranſporting it, and pay ten Shillings for every Buſhel of Salt ſo Tranſported, for which the Carrier, as well as the Owner, ſhall be lyable Conjunctly and Severally, and the Carriers to be Impriſon'd until the ſaid Penalty be paid.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. That all Salt Water-born be enter'd at a Cuſtom Office, and that before Shipping there be a Report made, expreſſing to what Port the Ship or Veſſel is bound, and if bound to any Port within <hi>Scotland,</hi> there ſhall be ſufficient Security given for the Duty payable in ſix Moneths, with this condition, that in caſe a Certificate be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from the Collector or Collectors where the Ship or Veſſel is bound, that the ſame Quantity was truly and without Fraud found Loaded at the ſaids Port or Ports, reaſonable Allowance being made
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0554400100:142"/>
for Waſte ſince the Embarkation; Then and in that Caſe the Bond for the Duty to be come void: And in caſe the Ship or Veſſel be bound for <hi>England</hi> or the Plantations, The Exciſe or Duty chargeable on the like Salt in <hi>England</hi> ſhall be preſently paid in Money, and a Tranſire or Certificate Subſcribed by the Collector, expreſſing the quantity of Salt Enter'd and the Duty paid; and if any Ship or Veſſel Load Salt on Board, and Export the ſame without duly Reporting, Entring and carrying the ſaid Tranſire or Certificate along with him, to be produced at the Port of Diſcharge; The Ship or Veſſel unload<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhall be confiſcated, and the Maſter Impriſon'd for three Months, and in caſe of any Fraud or Connivance in the Collector or other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Cuſtom-houſe, the ſaid Collector or other Officer ſhall be lyable to pay a years Sallary, and be deprived of his Office.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. As to Proviſions; All Fiſhes and Fleſh Barrel'd for Exportation, are appointed to be Packt and Cured with Forreign Salt without any Mixture of <hi>Scotch</hi> or <hi>Engliſh</hi> Salt, by the Law of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which Forreign Salt falls under the Regulation of Forreign Trade, and there are no other valuable Proviſions that can be Imported from <hi>Scotland;</hi> and the Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>Scotland</hi> are willing to agree to any further Propoſal that ſhall be made for preventing Fraud, in Importing <hi>Scotch</hi> Salt or ſalted Proviſions.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Her Majeſty came to the Meeting, and being ſeated in her Chair, ſpoke to the Lords Commiſſioners as followeth.</hi>

                                    <p>

                                    <p>I Am ſo much concerned for the UNION of the two Kingdoms, That I could not ſatisfie my ſelf without coming before I went out of Town, to ſee what Progreſs you had made in the Treaty, and to recommend very earneſtly to you the bringing it to a happy Concluſion, with as much diſpatch as the nature of it will admit, not doubting of the General ſatisfaction which my Subjects of both Kingdoms will receive in finding you overcome all difficulties to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſo great and publick a Good.</p>
                                 </q>
                              </p>
                              <p>THE Lord Keeper deſired to know of Her Majeſty, if ſhe would be pleaſ'd to hear the Propoſals made on either ſide, and the Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons hitherto taken thereupon, read by the reſpective Secretaries; which her Majeſty was pleaſed to allow of, and the ſame were Read accordingly.</p>
                              <p>After Reading whereof, Her Majeſty went away, and the Lords Commiſſioners Adjourned to <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 23d Inſtant, 10 a Clock in the Morning.</p>

                              <p>And thus after all the Difficulties which were thought Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurmountable by ſome, and endeavoured to be made ſo by others, the Affair of the Land Tax was ſettled; The next Article was the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0554400100:143"/>
Equality of Exciſes, Cuſtoms and other appropriated Funds, and theſe had ſundry Difficulties.</p>
                              <p>Some were grievous to <hi>Scotland</hi> with reſpect to their Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude only, in which caſe tho' <hi>Scotland</hi> was to be ſuppoſed to pay Duties under the ſame Denominations, yet the <hi>Scots</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners pretended to inſiſt upon it, that they were not able to pay the ſame Sums with <hi>England,</hi> but that it muſt be reduced to a proportioned Equality as in the Land Tax, and this reſpected the Exciſe and ſeveral Branches of the Cuſtoms.</p>
                              <p>Others were grievous to <hi>Scotland</hi> in the kind, and were thought Impracticable, at leaſt for a time, the Trade, Poverty, and other Circumſtances of <hi>Scotland</hi> not admitting them, theſe were the Tax upon Malt, and the Exciſe, or Duty on Salt.</p>
                              <p>Others again were ſuch as were altogether Impracticable, as having none of the Materials to work on in <hi>Scotland,</hi> or ſuch as could not rationally be expected from them, ſuch as the Taxes upon Coals, Culm, Hawkers and Pedlars, Hakney-Coach-Men, Births, Burials, and Marriages, Glaſs-Windows, Stampt-Paper, and the like.</p>
                              <p>In the beginning of the Debate on theſe Heads, the Equality of Cuſtoms, Export and Import, with the ſame Reſtrictions and Regulations of Trade was Agreed to by the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners; for the neceſſity of Commerce made it plain, there could be no adjuſting Trade without that. An open free uninterrupted Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce by Land being the Conſequence of an Union, they would otherwiſe ruine the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trade, by ſupplying the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Markets with all ſorts of Imported Goods, cheaper than the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants could do; and this would be a moſt deſtructive Article in Trade, eſpecially in fine Goods. For Example, in Linens from <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi> or <hi>Holland,</hi> or in Tobacco, Coffee, Tea, Chacolate, and ſuch other things as were then under large Duty and ſmall Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; theſe would all be ſpread over <hi>England</hi> by the <hi>Scots,</hi> and make unſpeakable Confuſions in Trade.</p>
                              <p>It was the ſooner concluded therefore, that the Cuſtoms, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions, and Charges of all foreign Importations, muſt be nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merically and literally the ſame in both Nations. But as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cuſtoms were already Impropriated to pay the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Debts, and the <hi>Scots</hi> had before propoſed, that neither Kingdom be burthened with the Debts of the other Contracted before the Union; this Equality was found very difficult; and next to Impracticable, and this brought on the affair of an Equivalent; of which hereafter.</p>
                              <p>This now run thro' all the Heads of Taxes, for there remained no Queſtion, but that an Equivalent was a full Compenſation for any Difficulty propoſed; and yet the ſettling an Equivalent here ſeem'd no Satisfaction. It was alleged an Equivalent was a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Satisfaction indeed, but not a perſonal, that it could not relieve the particular People it Oppreſſed, no, nor make good the Damage of the particular Trade it would injure; and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0554400100:144"/>
therefore the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners ſtrove hard to avoid the Taxes wholly, rather than to come into them tho' with an Equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent—, but it was not to be done; there could be no other Method that could make both ſides equally Eaſy.</p>
                              <p>After this had therefore been long Diſcours'd, the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners came in to the Article of Equality of Exciſes on Liquors, &amp; the Cuſtoms on Exported and Imported Goods, the Debate of what that Equality was did not ly before them, but ſeem'd referr'd on both ſides to the reſpective Parliaments, and there we ſhall meet with it again at large.</p>
                              <p>The Cuſtoms &amp; Exciſes on Liquors being thus ſettled, the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners Excepted againſt all other Exciſes &amp; Burthens, and inſiſted upon it as a Thing <hi>Scotland</hi> was not then in a Condition to come into, at leaſt for the preſent, as you ſee it expreſſed in the Minuts of <hi>May</hi> 13. And it is obſervable the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners made this Propoſal with a great deal of Candor and Regard to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as appears by their obviating the Objection which they knew would be made of the Carrying Salt and Malt into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> for it was the particular Duties on Salt and Malt which they had an Eye to in this Propoſal, in which they deſired Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption for ſo much only as ſhould be conſumed in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Upon this occaſion the Committee was appointed to Examine and State the Nature of the Equivalent, and on which particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Articles it was to be allowed; And as this was doing, the Commiſſioners in their Meeetings went upon the particular Points of Exciſes, or Taxes which were to be objected againſt.</p>
                              <p>The Stampt Paper, the Births, Burials, Windows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were without much Difficulty conceded to the <hi>Scots;</hi> for as the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of thoſe Duties made them improper, ſo the Stampt Duties could not have been extended to <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Methods and Cuſtoms of which would have made it Impracticable in ſome Caſes, and Intolerable in others.</p>
                              <p>The Duties on Coals, Culm, and Cinders, alſo occaſioned very ſmall Debates, the <hi>Scots</hi> being no otherwiſe Exempted from thoſe Duties, than a great part of <hi>England</hi> is, who pay no Duty for all their River-born Coals; and the Quantity of Coals carried by Sea in <hi>Scotland,</hi> is ſo very ſmall as not to deſerve any notice; Howbeit all the Coal Exported from <hi>Scotland,</hi> or <hi>Scots</hi> Coal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended in <hi>England,</hi> pays as in <hi>England.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>The Births and Burial Act expired, and having been grievous in <hi>England,</hi> it was not probable it ſhould be Renewed.</p>
                              <p>The Hakney-Coach-Mens Act could not concern <hi>Scotland,</hi> there being ſo few Hakney-Coaches in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> as not to make it worth notice.</p>
                              <p>The Malt and Salt Tax occaſioned the greateſt Debate, the Circumſtances of <hi>Scotland</hi> were argued, tho' with great Modeſty and Decency, on either ſide; and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſſioners were ſoon made ſenſible, That, in the preſent Circumſtances of <hi>Scotland,</hi> thoſe Duties could not be born there.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="50" facs="tcp:0554400100:145"/>
And indeed they would have been intolerable to the Poor, and not only as to the Magnitude, but as the manner of Taxing them had been particularly Oppreſſive to the <hi>Scots</hi> in their Trade.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. Becauſe they are Exorbitant in their Rate, being Charg'd not upon the Value, but upon the Bulk of the Commodity; and the Goods bearing ſo different a Value in <hi>Scotland</hi> and in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to put the Duty equal, would be to Tax the <hi>Scots</hi> in three times the Sum they are Tax'd at in <hi>England.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>For Example, the Duty upon Salt is charg'd by Weight in general, and this being Calculated in <hi>Scotland,</hi> would amount to 16 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> Sterling, upon 3 <hi>s.</hi> value, and in <hi>England</hi> to but 16 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> Sterling, upon 10 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> Value, or thereabout; let any Man ſtate the Proportion, here they will eaſily allow the Tax to be intolerable to the <hi>Scots;</hi> ſince by the ſame Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ought to pay 2 <hi>l.</hi> 17 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> for the ſame quantity of Salt, or the <hi>Scots</hi> ought to pay but 4 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> for that which by this Tax is rated at 16 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> and the like, tho not in ſo great a Difference, for the Malt.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. The Weight of the Salt Tax lyes eſpecially on the Poor, who in <hi>Scotland</hi> live very much on Salt Meats, and whoſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Condition from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> does not permit, nor cannot bear being Tax'd at all, much leſs equal to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Theſe Arguments brought the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſſioners to agree to an Exemption for a time, the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners inſiſted upon an Exemption to perpetuity, but the Anſwer of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſſioners ſtated in the Minuts of the 13<hi>th May</hi> is very clear, and obliged the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners to Acquieſce.</p>
                              <p>For it could not be thought reaſonable to tye up the Hands of the United Kingdom for ever, not to lay on ſuch Duties or Taxes as the Circumſtances of Trade and of the Nation, might make reaſonable.</p>
                              <p>The Treaters on both ſides therefore Acquieſced in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from the other ſeveral Duties during the reſpective Terms they were given for; leaving the Conſideration of further Exemptions to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, what Alteration this part received, and upon what Conſideration in the Parliament enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſhall appear in its place—.</p>
                              <p>There was an Objection offered here about what Duties might be laid on by the very next Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> which being to ſit almoſt at the ſame time with the Parliament in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and conſequently before the Union could Commence, might alter the ſtate of the preſent Duties; And ſo the Concluſions might be all to be made over again.</p>
                              <p>But this was after ſome Debate Regulated as <hi>per</hi> the Minuts, by obliging <hi>Scotland</hi> to raiſe her part of the Charge of the Year 1707, as uſual, and <hi>England</hi> her part, each ſeparately and a part, and the ſeveral Duties and Funds mentioned, were to remain juſt as they ſtood at the time of the Treaty.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="51" facs="tcp:0554400100:146"/>
This, and the <hi>Quota</hi> of Land-Tax being brought in together, was readily Agreed to on both ſides.</p>
                              <p>And thus this great Difficulty, which was thought the moſt dangerous in the whole Treaty, was brought into a very narrow Compaſs; For the Buſineſs was now, only to ſtate the matter of the Equivalent, what it ſhould be, and how to be diſpoſed.</p>
                              <p>What it ſhould be, admitted no long Debate; For, as it was a payment of Money, nothing but Money could be an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent to it.</p>
                              <p>How much it was to be, depended upon Matter of Fact, and was reſerv'd to exact Calculation from the Foot of the Cuſtoms and Exciſe.</p>
                              <p>As to the manner how it ſhould be diſpoſed, the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners did not adjuſt it at all, ſave in Generals, of which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after in its Courſe.</p>
                              <p>It has been objected indeed, as an Omiſſion in the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, That they did not adjuſt the Application of the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent in <hi>Scotland;</hi> But their Reaſons were, 1. Becauſe they had a Reſpect to the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> who were to come after them, and who perhaps might enter farther into that part, and indeed might claim a Right excluſive of all others to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of it.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. They were not willing to enter upon a thing, in which the Determination of Properties might be entangled, conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it did not ly before them to conclude private Intereſts, or exclude any, <hi>as they might have done,</hi> who had Reaſon to claim upon old Debts, ſome in King <hi>James</hi>'s Time, and ſome in King <hi>Charles</hi>'s Time, and the like.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. It was thought, this might raiſe Objections againſt the Union in People, who, being byaſs'd by their Intereſt, would oppoſe the General Intereſt on their own particular Accounts.</p>
                              <p>It was now that the Union appear'd hopeful, and People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be ſurprized at the Succeſs; The Queen Her ſelf, pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Proſpect, came to the Meeting, and hearing the Minuts Read, Expreſſed an Extraordinary Satisfaction in the Steps taken by the Commiſſioners, and the Hopes conceived of bringing this Great Matter to a Happy Concluſion.</p>

                              <p>The Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>England</hi> having conſidered the Papers deliver'd by the Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>Scotland,</hi> on the 21<hi>ſt</hi> Inſtant, and being deſirous to remove all Difficulties in this Treaty, return this Anſwer.</p>

That whereas the Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>England</hi> have already conſented, That the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> be exempted from the whole Duty on ſtampt Paper, Vellom and Parchment till the 1<hi>ſt</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1710, at which time one part thereof expires; The Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>England</hi> do now conſent, That the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhall not be charged with the other part of that Duty dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the continuance of that Duty by any Act now in Force.</p>
                              <p>And do Agree, It was and is the Intent of the Lords Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners for <hi>England,</hi> That the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> be exempted from the payment of the Duty laid on Cynders, in ſuch manner as the Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>England</hi> have before agreed, That the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> be exempted from the payment of the Duty on Coal and Culm.</p>
                              <p>And as to the Scheme propoſed by the Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>Scotland,</hi> for ſecuring, that the Duty on Salt now payable in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> be collected in <hi>Scotland</hi> after the Union, as to all Salt export<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from that Kingdom in Kind, or Proviſions; The Lords Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners for <hi>England</hi> have thought it neceſſary to receive ſome Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation concerning that Matter, from the Officers principally concern'd in the Management of that Duty; and until the Lords Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners for <hi>England</hi> can be ſatisfyed concerning the Sufficiency of theſe or other Methods for the end propos'd, They conceive they cannot properly enter with the Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>Scotland</hi> on the Conſideration of the time, to which the Exemption of <hi>Scotland</hi> from that Duty ſhall be Limited.</p>
                              <p>And as to the Duty which may be laid on by the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> before the Meeting of the Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> for the Service of the Year 1707: The Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> do agree, that the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhall not be charged with thoſe Duties, upon this Conſideration, that the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> do make the neceſſary Proviſion for the publick Charge and Service of the Year 1707 in that Kingdom, provided, that if the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> ſhall think fit to lay a further Charge on the Cuſtoms, or thoſe Exciſes, of which the Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>Scotland</hi> have agreed to bear equal Burthens in ſuch caſes; The Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>England</hi> propoſe the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> be ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the ſame Cuſtoms and Exciſes, having an Equivalent to be ſettled by the Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain:</hi> And as to the <hi>Quota</hi> of a Land Tax for the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> propos'd by the Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>England</hi> do agree, that whenever the Summe of 1997763 <hi>lib.</hi> 8 <hi>ſh.</hi> 4½<hi>d.</hi> ſhall be enacted by the Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> to be rais'd in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> on Land, and other things uſually charg'd in Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for granting an Aid to the Crown by Land-Tax, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhall be charged by the ſame Act with the further Summe of <hi>lib.</hi> 48000 as the <hi>Quota</hi> of that Kingdom to ſuch Tax, and ſo proportionably for any greater or leſſer Summe rais'd on the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> by any Tax upon Land, and other things uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally charg'd together with the Land.</p>

                              <p>It is very remarkable here, That, in the Exemptions from ſeveral Duties in this Treaty, there is a certain Limitation only to the Act then in Force, and to the Time for which theſe Duties were then laid on; From whence ſome afterward took Occaſion againſt the Treaters on the <hi>Scots</hi> ſide, as if they had thereby tacitly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, that thoſe Duties ſhould be charged upon <hi>Scotland</hi> after the Expiration of the Time Limited.</p>
                              <p>But they that pleaſe to Examine more Nicely into this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, will find it quite otherwiſe: The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſſioners con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to an Exemption from Taxes to the <hi>Scots,</hi> For, as far as the ſeveral Duties debated were laid, ſeem'd as much as could reaſonably be expected they ſhould agree to; ſince, to have gone farther, had been to abridge the United Parliament that was to follow, and tacitly to acknowledge what was but too frequently ſuggeſted, that they would be Partial to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and conſequently might oppreſs the <hi>Scots;</hi> This was the true Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that part of the Anſwer the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſſioners gave to the <hi>Scots</hi> Paper, <hi>May</hi> 18, <hi>viz. But if the Lords Commiſſioners for</hi> Scotland <hi>would extend their Propoſal of the</hi> 13th <hi>to an Exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from all Burthens and Exciſes, which the Parliament of</hi> Great-Britain <hi>may hereafter find neceſſary to Impoſe on the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; The Lords Commiſſioners for</hi> England <hi>are of Opinion, That it cannot be ſuppos'd, the Parliament of</hi> Great-Britain <hi>will ever lay any ſort of Burthens upon the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Kingdom, but what they ſhall find of neceſſity at that time, for the Preſervation and Good of the whole, and with due Regard to the Circumſtances and Abilities of every part of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Kingdom, and to allow of any Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the contrary, would be to form and ſet up an unanſwerable Argument againſt the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion it ſelf.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>This was very happily foreſeen, and by this Method pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented; For nothing was more certain, than that this very Argument would be raiſed, and in the debating this Treaty in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the Parliament there, it was one of the great Pleas, and thought to be an Unanſwerable Argument againſt the Union, <hi>viz. That the Parliament of</hi> Great-Britain <hi>might and would,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing byaſs'd by the Majority of Votes on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſide, <hi>lay Burthens on</hi> Scotland, <hi>without Regard to the Circumſtances and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of that part of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Kingdom;</hi> And it would indeed have been an Unanſwerable Argument, if the Lords Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners had extended their Limitations of Taxes beyond the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration of the Acts which were then in being.</p>
                              <p>Therefore they reſolved to leave it indefinite, only with their Conceſſions, as Reaſons for, and Precedents of future Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to <hi>Scotland;</hi> And this the Commiſſioners of <hi>Scotland</hi> found ſo reaſonable, as that they could not indeed object againſt it,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0554400100:149"/>
as to any Duties which the Parliament then in being in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and which were at hand to fit, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>October</hi> next follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it was but juſt to ty them up, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſſioners came readily into that; and thus they went on hand in hand, yielding to one another in every thing which might without Injury be granted, and which might in the leaſt contribute to the great and main End of the Treaty <hi>THE <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NION.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>And now they having Clerks appointed to aſſiſt them in the Calculations of the Equivalent, which took up a great deal of Time, they were obliged to adjourn the Affair of Funds, Taxes, Proportion of Debts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and go upon other Articles in the mean time.</p>

                              <p>The Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>Scotland</hi> are very ſenſible of the Care, which the Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>England</hi> have taken, to remove Difficulties in this Important Article, concerning common Taxes and Impoſitions; And their Lordſhips doubt not, that the Joynt Deſires and Endeavours of the Lords Commiſſioners for both Kingdoms, will bring this Treaty to a good and ſpeedy Concluſion in every Point.</p>
                              <p>And as to the Particulars contain'd in the Anſwer, given in by the Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>England;</hi> the 23<hi>d</hi> Inſtant; The Lords Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners for <hi>Scotland</hi> do accept the ſaid Anſwer as ſatisfying, as to the Exemption of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> from the Duties upon Stampt Paper, Vellom and Parchment, and upon Cynders, and as to the <hi>Quota</hi> of Land Tax for <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>And as to the Article concerning the Salt, The Lords Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners for <hi>Scotland</hi> are very well ſatisfy'd, that the Lords Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners for <hi>England</hi> take what time they judge needful for Informing themſelves, and preparing the moſt proper Methods, for ſecuring what their Lordſhips propoſed; The Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> being very ready to concur on their part.</p>
                              <p>As to the Duties which may be laid on by the Parliament of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> before the Meeting of the Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> The Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>Scotland</hi> do underſtand, that the ſaid An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is intended by the Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>England,</hi> as an Agreement to the Propoſal made by the Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>Scotland,</hi> That that Kingdom might remain Exempted from all other Duties laid on by the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> before the Union, except theſe conſented to; And the Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>Scotland</hi> do Agree, That all neceſſary Proviſion ſhall be made within the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for the Charge and Service of that Kingdom, during the time that ſhall Interveen before the Meeting of the Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>
                              </p>

And whereas the Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>England</hi> do propoſe, That if the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> ſhall think fit to lay a further Charge on the Cuſtoms, or thoſe Exciſes, of which the Lords Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners for <hi>Scotland</hi> have agreed to bear equal Burthens, in ſuch caſes the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> be lyable to the ſame Cuſtoms and Exciſes, having an Equivalent to be ſettled by the Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> The Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>Scotland</hi> do conſent in the Terms propos'd.</p>
                              <p>And ſeing the Adjuſting of the Equivalent, and ſettling the Endurance of the Exemption from the Duty on Salt may require ſome time, the Lords Commiſsioners for <hi>Scotland</hi> are ready, either to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed on theſe Matters, until they be fully Adjuſted, or to enter on the conſideration of the Conſtitution of the Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain;</hi> The Reſervation of Laws and Judicatures, or any other remaining Head to be Treated on, as ſhall be Agreed by the Lords Commiſsioners for both Kingdoms, while in the mean time the Committee is preparing what lyes before them.</p>

That all Laws for the Regulating Trade, Cuſtoms and Exciſes, be the ſame in <hi>Scotland</hi> after the Union as in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> This was abſolutely neceſſary to be done, <hi>tho' if they ſhould extend the word,</hi> to all Laws for Regulation of Trade it might be run out to difficult Extremes, &amp; occaſion an unanſwerable Diſpute; but moderately ſpeaking, it was abſolutely neceſſary to prevent the confuſion among Officers in Collecting the Revenue, ſtating and ſettling

the Cuſtoms and Exciſes, which were now to be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to both Countries.</item>
                                    <item>2. Again, it was moſt neceſſary that their other Laws ſhould <hi>be alterable by the Parliament of Great Britain,</hi> otherwiſe this had been to tye up the Hands of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Conſtitution from making neceſſary Proviſion againſt whatever Inconveniencies might happen in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; And I mention this here, becauſe in the tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary Clamours raiſed afterwards againſt the Treaty, and againſt the Treaters, this was one of the great Quarrels, That they had given up the Laws and Conſtitution of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and had ſubjected them to the arbitrary Votes of a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, in which it was alledged, the Majority being ſo much <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> could expect nothing but Diſadvantage. But it is apparent, and was at the time of the Treaty conſidered, that the leaving the Laws of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſubject to Alteration by the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, ſignified no more than leaving room for the Parliament in Caſes of Neceſſity, or indeed on all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, to make Laws for <hi>Scotland,</hi> as ſhould appear need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the publick Advantage, always reſerving their general Form of Law and Proceedings of Juſtice, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; And without this, <hi>Scotland</hi> muſt have been miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably left without a <hi>Legiſlature,</hi> and have had no oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to have helped her ſelf in Caſes contingent, or have obtained any more or other Laws for the Rectifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any of the common Abuſes of her Government, which it ſeems theſe Objectors did not think it worth their while to conſider.</item>

                              <p>And that this alone was the meaning of this word, <hi>Alterable by the Parliament of Great Britain,</hi> and that it was underſtood ſo on both Hands, is evident from the very words of the Propoſal of the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners, when they propoſe the Alternative between publick and private Right—, <hi>With this difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Laws concerning publick Right, Policy and Government, and thoſe which concern privat Right; That the Laws which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern publick Right, Policy and Government may be made the ſame thro-out the whole <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Kingdom; But that no Alteration be made in the Laws which conern privat Right, except for evident utility of the Subjects within that part of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Kingdom now called</hi> Scotland.</p>
                              <p>The three next Articles do alſo ſtill more evidently Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this, <hi>viz.

                              <p>Now it was thought moſt Irrational to argue, That the Laws and Conſtitution of Juſtice in <hi>Scotland</hi> was in this Treaty, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up to the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> When as, by theſe Articles, the Courts of Juſtice, and the General Form of Adminiſtration, ſuch as the Seſſion, Juſticiary, and all other Courts, were to remain in Force for ever, or in all time coming:</p>
                              <p>And yet, as if this had not been enough to ſecure the <hi>Scots</hi> from this Fear, the Commiſſioners for <hi>Scotland</hi> Form the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, and in it enter on the Particulars, <hi>viz. That no Cauſes in the Kingdom of</hi> Scotland <hi>be Cognoſcible by the Courts of Chancery, Queens Bench, Common Pleas, or any other Courts in</hi> Weſtminſter <hi>Hall, and that the ſaid Courts, or any other of the like Nature, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, ſhall have no Power to Cognoſce, Review, or Alter the Acts or Sentences of the Judicatures within</hi> Scotland, <hi>or ſtop the Execution of the ſame.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>The Privy Council indeed was left to the Queen to Diſſolve or Continue, as Her Majeſty might ſee Cauſe—; But that was by the Treaty ſubject to Parliamentary Determination, and how the Queen referr'd it to the Parliament, will appear in its Courſe.</p>
                              <p>Nay the Treaters were ſo tender of this General Invading the Particulars, That they took Care to Exempt Private Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Properties from the Power or Cognizance of Parliament, which is what is not done in <hi>England,</hi> and which, it has been thought even in <hi>Scotland</hi> too, had been better left to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in time, to have Diſſolved, giving Satisfaction to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties concerned, <hi>I mean,</hi> ſuch as Heretable Offices, Juriſdictions for Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>All theſe Proviſions were ſo exactly ſtated, and ſo forcible in themſelves, and the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners had ſo ſhown both their Capacity in the Affairs of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and their Candor in reſpect to Union, in the Great Affair before them, That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſſioners made no Objection, but agreed to it, as they, the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners had brought it in, without any Amendment.</p>
                              <p>And this Formed the 18, 19, 20, 21 Articles of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which were ſo clearly digeſted, that they admitted little or no Debate afterwards in the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> where

                              <p n="1">1. As to that part of the ſecond Article, <hi>viz.</hi> That if any Salt which is not made in <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhall be Imported to <hi>England</hi> from thence, the ſame to be charg'd with the Duties of Forreign Salt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into <hi>England,</hi> to be levied and ſecured in the ſame manner: The Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>Scotland</hi> do underſtand, That it is not the Meaning of the Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>England,</hi> by the ſaid Propoſal, to lay a double Duty on Forreign Salt, Exported from <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> once to be exacted at Importation of the ſaid Salt into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the like Duty at the Importation into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> from <hi>Scotland,</hi> but that the Forreign Salt Imported into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> be charg'd at the Importation there, with the ſame Duties after the UNION, as the like Salt is charg'd with, being Imported into <hi>England,</hi> to be levied and ſecured in the ſame manner; And for further ſecurity in that caſe, The Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>Scotland</hi> do propoſe, that Certificates be ſent with Forreign Salt, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported from <hi>Scotland</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> from the Cuſtom-Office in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where the ſaid Forreign Salt was firſt Imported, to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom Office in <hi>England,</hi> where the ſaid Salt ſhall happen to be Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, bearing the payment of, or ſecurity given for the Duties at the ſaid Port, under this Penalty, that Forreign Salt Exported from <hi>Scotland</hi> into <hi>England</hi> without ſuch Certificates, ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcated.</p>

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0554400100:159"/>
concern ſuch Fiſh and Fleſh as is cured in whole or in part with <hi>Scots</hi> Salt, there being an obvious Difference betwixt the Caſe of theſe, and of ſuch Fiſh and Fleſh, Exported from <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> as is wholly cur'd with Forreign Salt, in regard that Forreign Salt is to pay the like Duty as in <hi>England</hi> at Importation into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and therefore ought not to pay a ſecond Duty.</p>

                              <p>There were ſome Debates and a little time ſpent about the Matter of the Admiralty, but it was ſoon adjuſted, and needs no Remark on it; only as to the Matter of Appeals to <hi>England,</hi> which however were found neceſſary, and agreed to with ſome little Trouble.</p>
                              <p>But here had like to have happened a Difficulty about Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals in Cauſes of private Right in <hi>Scotland</hi>—; Before the Union, Appeals in Law lay from the Lords of the Seſſion to the Parliament; and the Houſe of Peers of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> being now to be the Sovereign Judicature of <hi>Britain,</hi> there could be no Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals but to them in Parliament: This it was thought would be a Grievance, by Reaſon of the Diſtance of Place, the Expence of Travelling, and the Charge of Proſecuting thoſe Tryals at the Bar of the Houſe of Peers.</p>
                              <p>It was Objected, That the <hi>Scots</hi> Peers could not be allow'd to Vote in Matters of Judicature, either in Civil or Criminal Caſes in <hi>England;</hi> and they gave a ſeeming ſubſtantial Reaſon for it, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Scots</hi> reſerving their Judicature, Seſſion and Juſticiary to themſelves, in which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have no Voice, it would be unreaſonable to deſire the <hi>Scots</hi> ſhould be let into that in <hi>England,</hi> which is reſerv'd from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

                                 <pb n="67" facs="tcp:0554400100:162"/>
But to this it was Anſwered,<q>The Lords in <hi>England,</hi> as Peers Aſſembled in Parliament, as they were before the Sovereign Judicature of <hi>England,</hi> would after the Union be together with the ſixteen <hi>Scots</hi> Peers, the only Sovereign Judicature of <hi>Britain,</hi> and have their Voices in the Judicature of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as well as of <hi>England</hi>—; If this be made out, then the Objection againſt the <hi>Scots</hi> Noblemen Voting in Judicial Matters in <hi>England,</hi> would by Conſequence fall to the Ground.</q>

                              <p>The Judicature of the Lords conſiſts in their trying their own Members for Life, and in Determining the Proceedings of all the other Courts of Juſtice in the Nation; an Appeal going to them from all other Judicatures whatſoever, whether before or after Judgment.</p>
                              <p>In Tryals of Peers, 'tis plain by this Union, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lords will have a Vote in the <hi>Scots</hi> Judicature, ſince they will have the Power to try all the <hi>Scots</hi> Peers for their Lives or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, in any Caſe wherein they ſhall become Obnoxious to the Law.</p>
                              <p>And as to Appeals, it was therefore abſolutely neceſſary they ſhould ly before the Houſe of Lords, they being the only Supreme Judicature; and to have had Appeals before any other, had been to have two Supremes, unleſs Commiſſioned by them; And if Commiſſioned by them and made certain, they had been too Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, and alſo not to be depended upon in Matters of ſuch Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. To ſolve this Difficulty, a ſhort Scheme was handed about for the Regulating that Point, ſo as to Veſt the whole Authority of the Law judicially in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Peers in Parliament, and ſettle the Eſſential Part in them, without nevertheleſs impoſing the Trouble upon the <hi>Scots</hi> of coming up with their Cauſes to the Lords Bar, which would be intolerable.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>The Scheme was as follows.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> have now an Appeal from the Lords of Seſſion, which are their Judges of Aſſize, or whatever elſe they may call them.</p>
                              <p>This Right of Appeal muſt not dy tho' the Parliament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom it lyes is Diſſolved, but muſt Devolve upon that Power to which as the Center of the whole their Parliament De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves, <hi>viz. The Parliament of Britain;</hi> Otherwiſe ſhould the Right of Appeal dy, which is one Article of the <hi>Scots</hi> Claim of Right, they endanger their Property, and may upon a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand not unlikely Circumſtances Revert to Tyrrannick Power, and even a Parliament may not help them.</p>
                              <p>The Right of Appeal being not Diſſolv'd, but Transfer'd to the general Center of Power, where, or on which Branch of that Power muſt it reſide? Not in the Commons, that would be to make them a Court of Judicature, which they to not pretend to, and can not by their Conſtitution accept.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="68" facs="tcp:0554400100:163"/>
Not to the ſelect Number of <hi>Scots</hi> Repreſentatives, that would be to give them more power than the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Repreſentatives; one having a judicial Authority, the other not.</p>
                              <p>Not to a Number choſen by the <hi>Scots,</hi> that would be a new Creation, and be a Reſerve of ſome Power ſuperior even to the general ſupreme power of Parliament, and many ways give Umbrage of a poſſibility of Return to a ſeparate Conſtitution, which would be really inconſiſtent with a National Incorporated Union, and capable of keeping on foot continual Jealouſies, Complaints, and Diſcontents among us, and might ſometime or other break out into a Rupture again, and Unravel the very Union it ſelf.</p>
                              <p>To regulate this, we muſt fly to one general Maxime, which we muſt adhere cloſsly to in all Matters of this Diſpute, <hi>viz.</hi> That the great Center of Power whether Civil or Criminal is, and is to be lodg'd in the Parliament then to be called, <hi>The Parliament of</hi> Great-Britain.</p>
                              <p>The Judicial Power in <hi>Scotland</hi> is immediately in the Seſſion, as it is in <hi>England</hi> in the Judges; the Lords of the Seſſion in <hi>Scotland</hi> as the Judges in <hi>England,</hi> receive their Commiſſions from the Sovereign, and in Her Name, and by Her Authority, tho' by ſpecial Law obtained in both Kingdoms, they are ſo fixed as that they can not be turn'd out but upon Misbehaviour.</p>
                              <p>From the Seſſion in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and all Acts, Sentences or Decreets there, lyes an Appeal to the Parliament, who ſitting in one Houſe are the ſovereign Judicature of the Nation, as well Commons as Lords; From the Judges in <hi>England</hi> Appeals ly to the Chancery, and from thence to the Houſe of Lords as the ſupreme Judicature of this Nation.</p>
                              <p>But both Parliaments being to be Incorporated into one as both Nations by conſequence will be one, ſo the publick Juſtice muſt run in the ſame Channel, and the Appeals of both Kingdoms ly before the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Peers only, as that ſovereign Ocean of Juſtice into which all the Streams muſt flow.</p>
                              <p>But to the end that <hi>Scotland</hi> may, as far as may be, Eas'd in that Inconveniency, which her diſtance from the Capital may bring upon Her, &amp; in which ſhe ſuffers otherways deeply enough, Appeals from the Courts of Juſtice in <hi>Scotland,</hi> may be tryed in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>A Court of Appeals may be Erected in <hi>Scotland,</hi> delegated from the Peers of <hi>Britain</hi> aſſembled in Parliament, to be named Annually or Triennially, or every Seſſion, or otherwiſe, as in the Treaty of Union ſhall be agreed.</p>
                              <p>Theſe Delegates to be Nam'd out of the <hi>Scots</hi> Nobility and Gentry, to be choſen by Ballot, or by the uſual way of Voting in the Houſe of Peers.</p>
                              <p>That they ſhould be <hi>Scots</hi> is but equal, as they are only to Judge of Cauſes in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and is agreeable to the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>England,</hi> which cauſes all Tryals at Law to be tryed in
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0554400100:164"/>
the County where the Party dwells, and to be Determined by a Jury of the Freeholders or Inhabitants of that particular County, and of no other.</p>
                              <p>And yet this does no way leſſen the Authority of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but preſerves the Title of the Lords here to a Voice even in the Supreme Judicature of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>This Scheme as it Entitules the Parliament of United <hi>Britain</hi> to its full and compleat Juriſdiction; ſo it preſerves the Right of Appeal to the <hi>Scots,</hi> prevents the Expenſive proceeding of carrying their Appeals to <hi>England,</hi> and takes away all the Force of the Objection againſt the <hi>Scots</hi> Noblemen having a Voice in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Judicature.</p>
                              <p>Thus the Union in point of Judicature may ſtill be compleat, and the general Incorporation not at all Obſtructed, the Courſe of Juſtice left free and open, and both Nations equally concern'd in it.</p>
                              <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Peers are let into the Sovereignty of the <hi>Scots</hi> Judicature as well as of their own; and the <hi>Scots</hi> let into all the neceſſary Privileges which the Right of their Peerage, and the nature of an Incorporated Equality requires.</p>
                              <p>There were Reaſons to be given why this Propoſal was not further entred upon, tho' both ſides approved of the Method, ſome of which were perhaps ſuch as theſe.<list>

                              <p>There was now the only remaining Difficulty of the Union before them, and this was the Conſequence of the Third Article, <hi>viz.</hi> The Uniting the Parliament, and how to ſtate the Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Repreſentative was the preſent Caſe.</p>
                              <p>The Difficulty was double, not only how to draw the Proportion ſo, as might conſiſt with the Equalities ſpoken of before, which were the Foot or Rule of the Treaty, but how to draw it ſo, as that either Parliament, who were to Confirm this Work, ſhould be rationally ſuppoſed to come into it.</p>
                              <p>Abundance of Schemes were propoſed for this, as Mens Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies guided them, and the Debates without Doors were much warmer, than thoſe within; However, as it was a Thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired particular Application, ſo it was the beſt Step that could have been taken, by way of preliminary, to propoſe a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, wherein both ſides had full Scope to deliver their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Reaſons in the Caſe; ſince, to have gone on by Propoſals and Anſwers in Writing, would have taken up more time than was needful to be ſpent in ſuch an Affair, and have kept it depending; whereas both ſides were pleaſed with the Hopes, and both the Kingdoms big with Expectation of the Succeſs of this Treaty, and the Concluſion of the long expected Union.</p>
                              <p>There was no Occaſion to look far back into former Years for Help in this Calculation; There was but one Precedent in the whole World, from which any Scheme could be drawn, and that was in the tranſient Union made by <hi>Oliver Cromwel;</hi> in which, as I have noted before, he brought every thing by a Scale of Proportions to a Point, as things then ſtood.</p>
                              <p>This Model of a Repreſentative was taken from the Scheme of Proportions, upon which he had formed his Taxation, in which <hi>Scotland</hi> being Rated at about a 13<hi>th</hi> part of the Land Tax, had alſo allowed her about a 13<hi>th</hi> part of the Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, as follows;<list>

                              <p>13 times 30 is 390 Members, and 13 times 6000 <hi>l.</hi> is 78000 <hi>l.</hi> whereas one is 8000 <hi>l.</hi> over in the Money, ſo the other is 10 under in the Repreſentative.</p>
                              <p>I will not ſay, this was the moſt equal Judgment that ever was made of this kind as to <hi>Scotland,</hi> but I may be allowed to ſay, that, with Reſpect to <hi>England,</hi> it was certainly the moſt
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0554400100:168"/>
equal Diſtribution of Elections that ever was, and much beyond our preſent Method; For, in this Scheme, the Diſproportion of Numbers was taken away, and the Election of Members to Repreſent Ruin'd Heaps, Decayed Caſtles and Depopulated Towns, was let fall: But of this by the way.</p>
                              <p>The preſent Calculation was not very remote from this in Effect, tho' not built upon the ſame Foot; and it was very rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly argued here, That the Proportion could not be taken barely from the Share of Taxes paid, which was the Scheme which moſt of the Politicians of that time pretended to go upon; but that the Proportion muſt be doubly calculated, which if it be Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd, and were to be Applyed in <hi>Holland,</hi> and other parts of the World, muſt have been done.</p>
                              <p>For Inſtance the Share in Taxes.</p>
                              <p>And the Number of the People.</p>
                              <p>If, on one Hand, the Share of Taxes may be low, yet the Number of People great; or, on the other Hand, the Share of Taxes high, and the People few, the Extremes are to bear their Weight in the Proportion.</p>
                              <p>

                                    <item>Thus, tho' the <hi>Scots,</hi> by this Union, paid but 48000 <hi>l.</hi> for <hi>Scotland</hi> to 1997000 <hi>l. Engliſh,</hi> which was about 1/40 part, forty times 48000 <hi>l.</hi> being 1920000 <hi>l.</hi> to have argued from thence, That they ſhould have but 13 Members, which, to the Houſe of Commons, is 1/39 6/13 part of 513: This would appear ridiculous.</item>
                                    <item>Again, if you take an Eſtimate of the People of both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we ſhall find <hi>Scotland</hi> Eſteemed to contain Two Millions, and <hi>England,</hi> at the higheſt Calculation, under Six; and this brings <hi>Scotland</hi> to a Third Part of the Members, which would be Extravagant the other way, and oblige them to ſend 171 Members to the Houſe.</item>
                                    <item>But, if you ſet theſe Extremes againſt one another, it will appear, That a Tenth of the Repreſentative Anſwer'd as nigh to an Equality, as ſuch a Thing could well be reduced to; and on this Foot, the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be near the Matter, when they deſired 50 Members might be the Repreſentative for <hi>Scotland.</hi>

                              <p>However this was, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſſioners having propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 38, <hi>as by the Minutes,</hi> a Conference was agreed to.</p>
                              <p>And here the Commiſſioners ſincerely and candidly applyed themſelves to one another, debating not only the Reaſons and Proportions on either Hand, but the Temper and Circumſtances of either Nation; ſo, if poſſible, to Accommodate themſelves to both, and to conſider not only what was equal, but alſo what was likely to take place in the Minds of the reſpective Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which were to debate it after them; of which none knew the Difficulties better than themſelves, neither were theſe things fit to have been the Subject of Minutes, which, in time, were to be ſuppoſed, would be made publick, and be canvaſs'd
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0554400100:169"/>
on either ſide by the moſt Critical Heads of Two Nations, and particularly by thoſe in both the Nations, whoſe Study it would be to oppoſe and obſtruct the Union.</p>
                              <p>And indeed, in this Prudence of the Commiſſioners, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the beſt Proſpect of bringing this Treaty to a Happy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</p>
                              <p>The Conference was Happy in its Succeſs, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners were convinc'd by the Reaſons given on the other ſide, they ſaw the Difficulties which the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented lay before them; and regarding the End of their Meeting, which was to contribute, as much as in them lay, to Unite the Two Kingdoms, they advanced their Number to 45, and gave their Reaſons and Difficulties on the other Hand, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively determining the Point, that they could go no further; Upon which the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners, from the ſame Zeal for bringing the Treaty, which was now in ſo Happy a Forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to a Concluſion, acquieſced.</p>
                              <p>As for the Number of the Peers, there was no Room to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, ſince the Number propoſed, which was 16, was a full Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the other, &amp; had more of an Equality in it a great deal, than any other part of the Treaty; Eſpecially conſidering, That ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the <hi>Scots</hi> Peers then were Peers of <hi>England,</hi> and hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter might become Peers of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> by Creation.</p>
                              <p>And thus this great Difficulty was alſo happily got over, and now the Union began to ſhew it ſelf, and People on every Hand began to Expect, it ſhould be Compleated in a few Days.</p>

                              <p>They agree, That the ſixteen Peers who are to ſit in the Houſe of Lords of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> for that part of the United Kingdom called <hi>Scotland,</hi> after the Union ſhall have all Priviledges of Parliament, which the Peers of <hi>England</hi> now have, and which they or any Peers of <hi>Britain</hi> ſhall have after the Union, and particularly the Right, of ſitting upon the Tryals of Peers.</p>
                              <p>They agree, That in caſe of the Tryal of any Peer in time of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journment or Prorogation of Parliament, the ſaid ſixteen Peers ſhall be ſummon'd in the ſame manner, and have the ſame powers and priviledges at ſuch Tryals, as any other Peers of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>And they do further agree, That in caſe any Tryals of Peers ſhall hereafter happen, when there is no Parliament in Being, the ſixteen Peers of <hi>Scotland</hi> who ſat in the laſt preceeding Parliament, ſhall be ſummon'd in the ſame manner, and have the ſame Powers and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges at ſuch Tryals, as any other Peers of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>The Lord Treaſurer did alſo in Name of the Lords Commiſsioners for <hi>England,</hi> deliver to the Board the following Paper, which was Read.</p>
                              <p>The Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>England</hi> do agree to the Propoſal delivered the 21ſt. <hi>June,</hi> by the Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>Scotland,</hi> touching Ships belonging to Her Majeſties Subjects in <hi>Scotland,</hi> with the Alterations following, <hi>viz.</hi>

                              <p>The Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>Scotland</hi> do agree to the Alteration made by the Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>England</hi> in the Propoſal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd by the Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>Scotland,</hi> touching Ships belonging to Her Majeſties Subjects of <hi>Scotland,</hi> with this further Explanation.</p>

                              <head>OBSERVATION XI.</head>
                              <p>The Debates about the 16 Peers are ſo clear, and the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions and Anſwers in themſelves ſo direct, That they require no Explanation; Nor was there any thing conſiderable paſs'd upon thoſe Heads, which is not expreſs'd in the Minute.</p>
                              <p>The ſettling the different Privileges between the Sitting Peers for the Time being, and the other Peers, ſeem'd to be the main Difficulty, and was quickly Regulated.</p>
                              <p>I know it was alledged in <hi>Scotland,</hi> That the Privilege of Peerage being, by this Treaty, extended to the Nobility of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> I mean, as to Protection of their Perſons and Eſtates, was both a Diſhonour and a Diſadvantage to them; A Diſhonour, as if they were ſtooping to accept of an Exemption from an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Diſcharge of their Debts, and a Diſadvantage, ſince now, they being not lyable to Proſecutions for Debt, would obtain no Perſonal Credit, whatever their Occaſions might be—; And that a private Gentlemans Bond would now be more Valuable than a Noblemans, ſince it could be Sued and made Heretable, whereby his Eſtate ſhould become lyable, as well after his Death, as in his Lifetime, whereas a Noblemans Bond could no way be put in Suit.</p>
                              <p>However this was, there was no making a Diſtinction, at a time when a Treaty was Tranſacting, to bring all, if poſſible, to an Equality of Circumſtances, unleſs the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility, ſhould have laid themſelves and their Eſtates open, to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Proceſs of the Law, which had been Inconſiſtent with their Conſtitution, and much more with their Convenience.</p>
                              <p>I have not meddled with the frequent Propoſals, Anſwers and Replyes about the Salt Tax, as a Thing I ſhall ſpeak more at large to, when I ſhall obſerve upon the Minutes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where that Matter received a New Turn, and all theſe Scruples were effectually ſettled under one Head of Limitation, and ſo are needleſs to be Repeated here.</p>
                              <p>It may be needful to Explain ſomething here, of the Debate and Reſtriction about Shipping; The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſſioners had in their View the Act of Navigation, which, in <hi>England,</hi> obliges all the Ships Employed to and from <hi>England,</hi> except only ſuch Ships as Import any Thing of the Growth or Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture of their own Country, to which thoſe Ships belong, to be <hi>Engliſh</hi> built Ships, and the Mariners, or Sailers Navigating the ſame, to be Two Thirds, at leaſt, Natural Born Subjects of <hi>England.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Now as <hi>Scotland</hi> of late Years wanting Timber, or other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials for Building, had but very few Ships of their own Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they carryed on the greateſt part of their Forreign Trade in Ships built in <hi>Holland, Hamburgh,</hi> the <hi>Baltick,</hi> or other For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Parts; Wherefore the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſſioners, in order
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0554400100:177"/>
to ſet Bounds to the Introducing of Forreign Bottoms into our Trade as Free Ships, offered the Clauſe as in the Minute.</p>
                              <p>It was moved in the <hi>Scots</hi> Behalf, to give a certain time for the clearing up this Point, and that a Ship ſhould be deemed Free at the time of the Union, if part of her was owned by <hi>Scots</hi> Men at the time of the Union, becauſe as the <hi>Scots</hi> Traded much to <hi>Holland,</hi> ſo the Merchants of <hi>Amſterdam, Camphere, &amp;c.</hi> were in part Owners, in Company with the <hi>Scots</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, of many of their Ships; And therefore it was thought hard, That if the Major Part of the Owners were <hi>Scots</hi> Men, yet the Ship ſhould be deemed Forreign, which would either oblige the <hi>Scots</hi> Merchant to buy the Remainder, at what Price the Forreign Owner pleaſed to Exact, or oblige him to ſell and caſt off the Ship, which he could not carry on his Trade with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</p>
                              <p>But as this would have claſhed directly with the Act of Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and created innumerable Inconveniencies in Trade, it was left out; For then Forreigners had had no more to do, but to Intereſt <hi>Scots</hi> Men in a Moiety of their Ships, and ſo have made great Numbers of Forreign built Bottoms have paſs'd for Free Ships in <hi>Britain,</hi> to an Inexpreſſible Damage of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trade.</p>
                              <p>This Point therefore being given up, it remained only to diſpute the time, at which any Veſſel belonging entirely to <hi>Scots</hi> Owners ſhould be deemed Free; The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſſioners put it, to be at the time of Signing the Treaty, the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners inſiſted on the time of the Commencement of the Union; But the Reaſons given againſt that Latitude were ſo Convincing, that the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners Complyed with it.</p>
                              <p>The principal Reaſon was, That, in that Interval of time, the Merchants of either Kingdom might furniſh themſelves with great Numbers of Forreign Ships, which being built cheaper than the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and becoming Free by this Clauſe, would be a great Prejudice to Trade; And ſeing it was the known Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of both Kingdoms, to Encourage the Building of Merchants Ships among themſelves, it could not but be the Intereſt of both, to prevent the Crowding in of Forreign Ships among them.</p>
                              <p>This was Debated again in the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and, after long Diſcourſes, obtain'd to paſs with this ſmall Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Time <hi>of Ratifying,</hi> inſtead of the Time <hi>of Signing</hi> the Union, as ſhall appear in its place.</p>
                              <p>The Affairs of the Standards, Weights and Meaſures, were Things admitted no Debate in either Kingdom, ſo need no Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation; I ſhall give a Scale of the Differences hereafter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it may be uſeful in Matters of Trade.</p>
                              <p>The Affair of the Coin made ſome Noiſe Abroad among the People, but the Anſwering the Loſs of private Perſons out of the Equivalent put a Stop to it, and it was alſo Adjuſted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Heſitation.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="83" facs="tcp:0554400100:178"/>
Neither was there any Difficultie before them about the Affair of the Great-Seal of <hi>Britain,</hi> or of any Regulations with reſpect to a Seal in <hi>Scotland,</hi> for the paſſing ſuch Acts, either relating to private Rights or publick Juſtice; but it appeared ſo equal, that it made no Difficulties, even at the time of the Parliament in <hi>Scotland,</hi> when moſt of the other Heads admitted ſuch ſtrong Debates.</p>
                              <p>But the next thing proceeded upon, was the Calculation of the Equivalent, which a Committee had been buſy in ſettling, with Clerks appointed to Examine the Calculations, and State them for the Commiſſioners, the Reſult of which was now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them.</p>

the private Rights of the ſaid Company in <hi>Scotland</hi> be purchaſ'd from the ſaid Proprietors; The Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>England</hi> in Anſwer thereto, ſay they are of opinion, That the continuance of that Company is inconſiſtent with the Good of Trade in the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited Kingdom and conſequently againſt the intereſt of <hi>Great-Britain;</hi> And therefore, they inſiſt that it ought to be determined; But the Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>England</hi> being ſenſible that the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes of that Company have been the occaſion of Miſ-underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and Unkindneſſes between the two Kingdoms, and thinking it to be above all things deſireable, that upon the Union of the Kingdoms, the Subjects of both may be entirely United in affection; Do therefore wiſh that regard may be had to the Expences and Loſſes of the particular Members of the ſaid Company, in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner hereafter-mentioned, and they hope when the Lords Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners for <hi>Scotland</hi> have conſidered how Generally that undertaking was enter'd upon in <hi>Scotland</hi> and conſequently how univerſal that Loſs was, they will readily agree to the Propoſal.</p>

                              <p>In making Obſervations on the Affair of the <hi>African</hi> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, it may be neceſſary to ſtate that part of the <hi>African</hi> Affair, as belongs to this immediate Debate.</p>
                              <p>The <hi>African</hi> Company having, as has been related in the beginning of this Work, met with ſeveral Diſaſters and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, in ſome of which, the National Intereſts of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> had but too much claſhed, and which had been the Occaſion of a great deal of ill Blood between them, it was
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0554400100:181"/>
abſolutely neceſſary, in the bringing to paſs an Union between the Kingdoms, to remove every Occaſion of Diſcontent; and particularly every Interfereing Intereſt, being Inconſiſtent with a compleat entire Union, the Thing now aim'd at, there was therefore an abſolute Neceſſity to Remove or Reconcile every Thing of that Nature, as far as poſſible, before ſuch an Union could be made.</p>
                              <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners were in the right to propoſe, That their <hi>African</hi> Company ſhould be ſupported and defended as a private Right, all Rights and Privileges of Corporations and Companies being to be Reſerved; And this having been a National Concern, in which they had but made an Eſſay, and miſcarrying in their firſt Attempt, had let it reſt for a while, but had Various Proſpects of Future Projects and Attempts; It could not be equal, to oblige them to quit theſe Proſpects, and their Legal Right to a Trade to the <hi>Indies,</hi> which was ſo Valuable in other Countries, and which might in Time Reſtore their Loſſes; and therefore they propoſed the Reſerving to themſelves the Charters, Rights and Privileges of their <hi>African</hi> and <hi>Indian</hi> Company.</p>
                              <p>On the other Hand, the Caſe of <hi>England</hi> made this Impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable; For, whereas there was already a Company Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>England,</hi> Formed, and, with great Difficulty United in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to One, from two Contending and Powerful Companies; And that theſe were entirely ſupported, and depended upon their Excluſive Charters, by which no other Perſons could Trade to the <hi>Indies</hi> but themſelves, or, by their Permiſſion: If this Company Eſtabliſhed in <hi>Scotland</hi> had continued after the Union, the Article for a Free Intercourſe of Trade between the Nations, had immediately open'd to them all the Ports of <hi>England,</hi> for their Ships and Goods; And it had been, in Event, a perfect laying open the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade, or at leaſt Erecting a New <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company in <hi>Britain,</hi> which, whoever knows the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of Uniting the laſt Contending Companies, and the Injury they did both their Trade in particular, and the whole Nation of <hi>England</hi> in general, before they could be brought together, will acknowledge, is not to be born within <hi>Britain.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>This the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners foreſaw, and therefore very frankly propoſed the Alternative, <hi>viz. That if the Priviledges of that Company ſhall be judg'd Inconvenient for the Trade of the Reſt of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Kingdom, that the private Rights of the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in</hi> Scotland <hi>be purchas'd from the Proprietors.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>This was the leaſt that could be demanded; For, if <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> found it Impracticable to ſuffer, or Intolerable to their Two Companies to bear, it was but reaſonable, that the Company, who was to quit its Right, ſhould have Satisfaction for parting with that Right: And the next Queſtion was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, what muſt this Purchaſe be, and who muſt pay it, and this was no ſmall Point.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="87" facs="tcp:0554400100:182"/>
                                 <hi>England</hi> was ſo clear and fair in all their Offers as to the Equivalent, That the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners were, in a manner, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented in every thing they had to ask; The Offers of a full Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence in Money, advanc'd for all the Money which <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould be charg'd to pay towards the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Debts, and of applying the whole remaining Revenue of <hi>Scotland</hi> for the Encouraging Trade, and Employing the Poor, had in it ſo much Evidence of the hearty Deſign of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſſioners, to conſider every Thing for the Good of the Community after the Union, That it could bear but little Objection: It ſeem'd therefore but reaſonable, That the <hi>Scots</hi> ſhould, at their own Charge, put themſelves in Condition of Uniting, <hi>That is,</hi> That, if they had any National Obſtruction, which was Inconſiſtent with the deſign'd Union, and without Removing which it could not be made, that then the Removing that Difficulty ſhould ly at their Door.</p>
                              <p>It was this kind of Reaſoning, which directed the Purchaſe of the private Rights of the <hi>African</hi> Company in <hi>Scotland</hi> to be made out of the Equivalent Money; And to which, after very little Debate, as you may ſee, both Parties agreed.</p>
                              <p>Then the Queſtion was, What Price ſhould theſe private Rights be purchaſed at; And this would have met with great Difficulties, ſome magnifying the Proſpects of their Company in Trade, as a Thing not to be Valued, and which alone was able to Enrich their Nation; Others leſſening it in the moſt contemptible manner, as a Thing that not only had now, but never had any Proſpect or Poſſibility of Succeſs, as it had been managed. Of which by it ſelf—.</p>
                              <p>But the Method propoſed appeared ſo fair, That it left no Room for Objection, it being a Valuation from the True Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, <hi>viz.</hi> That every private Adventurer ſhould be put in the ſame Condition as he was in at firſt, ſuppoſing his Money put out to Intereſt—; So that every Man was to receive his full Original Capital Stock which he had at firſt advanced, and 5 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Intereſt to the Time of Payment.</p>
                              <p>Nor can I forbear ſaying, That the Surprize of this Offer had Various Effects upon the People; for this Stock was a dead Weight upon a great many Families, who wanted very much the Return of ſo much Money: It had not only been long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burs'd, but it was, generally ſpeaking, abandoned to Deſpair, and the Money given over for loſt; Nay, ſo entirely had People given up all Hopes, That a Man might even, after this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the Treaty, have bought the Stock at 10 Pound for an Hundred; And after all this, to find the whole Money ſhould come in again with Intereſt for the Time, was a Happy Surprize to a great many Families, and took off the Edge of the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, which ſome People would otherwiſe have made to the Union in general.</p>

                              <p>I might make Obſervations here upon the manner of ſtating the Equivalent; for in a Matter of that Moment it is not to be doubted but there were various Judgments paſt, Projects found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Propoſals made on every ſide, for the bringing this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                              <p>The main Difficulty, as I have hinted already, was the Propoſal it ſelf of an Equivalent, and indeed without this it had been impoſſible to bring this Union to a Concluſion; Nor was the way ever ſeen clear towards a Union till the project of an Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent was thought of; The Manner of it therefore might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently be ſuppoſed to introduce equal Difficulty, ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it in an Annual payment of Intereſt to <hi>Scotland</hi> of <hi>lib.</hi> 30000 <hi>per Annum,</hi> or 600000 <hi>lib.</hi> in Money, to be ſtated at 5 <hi>lib. per Cent.</hi>

                              <p>But the People that made theſe Propoſals, built upon the Suppoſition, of the <hi>Scots</hi> Revenues paying a far greater ſhare of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Debt, than upon a further ſearch into the ſeveral Articles, appeared probable; and at beſt built upon imaginary Encreaſes on one ſide, and imaginary Expences on the other, as will appear by the following Schemes of the improved Taxes of <hi>Scotland</hi> after the Union.</p>

                              <p>I ſhould not Record this Imaginary and Erroneous Scheme, but to illuſtrate and ſhew the Neceſſity and Original of the True; perhaps the Author of this Scheme had as near a View as any body at that time of Day could come at.</p>
                              <p>But when the Commiſſioners on both ſides came to Form themſelves into a Committee to ſtate this ſo, as that neither Kingdom might object, they found themſelves under a Neceſſity of keeping a <hi>Medium</hi> between two dangerous Extremes, That the <hi>Scots</hi> on one Hand might not plead a Diſparity of Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and conſequently deny its being an Equivalent, which would overthro' the Foundation; And the <hi>Engliſh</hi> might not complain they were wrong'd in the Calculation, and paid more for the Proportion than it was worth.</p>
                              <p>To bring this therefore to a Head, they went back to the Principles, which was an infallible Rule to Judge by, and taking the Cuſtoms and Exciſes of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which were the only Taxes which Could be appropriated to the payment of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Debts, and ſtating them at the preſent produce as they were then Farmed out, they advance to the <hi>Scots</hi> as much Money as the annual Produce of thoſe Sums appropriated as above comes to—. This was capable of a moſt exact Calculation to the leaſt Fraction, and was exactly caſt up as in the Tables an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the Minutes, which I have alſo Printed, that Poſterity may ſee how exactly this Matter was carry'd between both, and may for ever be ſatisfied with the Juſtice which was done them in either Nation.</p>
                              <p>The Calculation being made exactly for the preſent Revenue of <hi>Scotland;</hi> It was not for the Commiſſioners to attempt a real Advance upon imaginary Encreaſes, which might or might not come to paſs, as Trade might or might not be Enlarged by <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion.</hi> But to remove all poſſible Objections, they firſt State how much ſhall be appropriate to the payment of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Debts, upon every Thouſand Pound that any of the Revenues of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhall thereafter advance, and then appointing an exact Account to be kept of ſuch Advance; Agree, that <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhall be Re-imburſed by way of Equivalent, as much as ſhall be paid out of ſuch advanced Revenues, and that Commiſsioners be
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0554400100:192"/>
appointed both to ſee the Calculations made and Accompts kept, and alſo to pay the ſaid Equivalent as it becomes due.</p>
                              <p>This was ſo clear, ſo juſt, and ſo unexception'd a Method, that it could admit of no Diſpute, and brought the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate part of the whole Treaty to a happy concluſion.</p>
                              <p>The Queſtion about the manner of payment was now all that remained, and the Propoſal for an <hi>Annual</hi> Intereſt found no room; for this had been but the ſame thing with letting the Revenues of <hi>Scotland</hi> pay themſelves as it came in; Nor could it enable <hi>Scotland</hi> to anſwer the Incumbrances which were then upon her, and which it behoved her to clear her ſelf of to make way for the Union, ſuch as the paying of, or purchaſing the Capital Stock of the <hi>African</hi> Company, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> making good the deficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Coin, paying the publick Debts <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>To ſolve this, the Calculation being made, they propoſed to Eſtimate the Value of the Proportions which <hi>Scotland</hi> would ſo pay of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Debts, and reduce them to a Rate in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Money, according to the common Eſtimates then current for advanced payment to the Government; and that then <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ſhould pay the full Sum down in ready Money, the payment to become due upon the ſigning the Union.</p>
                              <p>This was thought not only Juſt, but Advantageous to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and indeed Neceſſary to her, to ſupply the Stagnation which might be upon the current Caſh of that Kingdom on the Alteration of the Coyn, and to cauſe Money to circulate among them, which was then much wanted.</p>
                              <p>This part of the Calculation I have therefore cauſed to be Printed here as it ſtands in the Books of the Commiſſioners, to clear up the Particulars, and to convince the niceſt Objectors with what Exactneſs and equal proportion every part of this Tranſaction was carried on.</p>

In theſe we have come to an Agreement on every point, we Judg'd Neceſſary to Effect a compleat and laſting Union, and we have En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured not to ſtir into any Matter we had Reaſon to think was not ſo.</p>
                                    <p>And altho' we have Unanimouſly carried this Treaty thus far, purely from a Conviction, that we have done therein to GOD, Your Majeſty, and our Countries Good Service; Yet we are far from thinking, that what we have done will or ought to be of any Weight or Authority elſewhere; but do moſt entirely ſubmit theſe our Labours to the High Wiſdom of Your Majeſty, and both Your Parliaments, to ſtand or fall by the Reaſon, Juſtice, and publick Utility on which they are founded.</p>
                                    <p>Your MAJESTIES Royal Preſence and Seaſonable Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to us at the fitteſt Junctures were (we moſt Thankfully Acknowledge) a very great Encouragement and Aſſiſtance to us in the Difficulties we met with.</p>
                                    <p>Your Majeſties Glory is already perfect, and the finiſhing this Work is all that is wanting to compleat as well as ſecure the Happineſs of ſo great a People, as Your Subjects may now without any arrogance pretend to be.</p>
                                    <p>May Your Majeſty Live not only to give a Sanction of this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Bleſſing to all Your People, but alſo to ſee in a long and proſperous Reign over us the many Immediat (or near) Good Effects of it; But as for that great and main Conſequence of it, for which Your Majeſty is making by a moſt Gracious and Charitable Foreſight, this only Effectual Proviſion, I mean the continuance of Peace and Tranquility in this Iſland, upon a deſcent of the Crown inſtead of that Blood ſhed and Diſtraction which would probably follow upon the fatal Diviſion of it.</p>

            <head>OF THE Carrying of the TREATY in SCOTLAND.</head>
            <p>AND thus the Treaty at <hi>London</hi> ended, which, tho' it ſeemed very perfect in all its parts, and as abundance of People thought, could not want any Corrections, yet as by the ſequel appeared, the moſt difficult Work was yet to do.</p>
            <p>I know ſome were of the Opinion, that this Treaty could admit of no Additions, Amendments or Alterations, and that the Words in the reſpective Acts of Parliament previous to it, (which ſaid, <hi>Provided that nothing in this Treaty ſhould be binding to either Nation, unleſs it ſhall be Ratified in the reſpective Parliament of both Kingdoms</hi>) Implyed that the reſpective Parliaments had no Power to enter into the Articles ſeparately and apart, but only debating on the whole, to Approve or Diſapprove, Ratifie or Reject it as a Treaty.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not Trouble the Reader with any of the Reaſons given for this Notion, nor make any other Remark upon it than this,—That the People who were for this Opinion were of two ſorts, and both ſuch as the Nations on either ſide, were very little behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They were ſuch, who having no great Concern for the eſſential part of the Treaty, <hi>viz. The Good of their Country,</hi> were for taking all upon Truſt, and concerned not themſelves either with the Event, or with the Circumſtances, and therefore without any Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty were willing to put all upon a meer plurality of Voices, not much regarding whether it went this way or that. I ſhall be Kinder to theſe Gentlemen than to Record their Names, or leave them (ſo eminent in Folly) to be known by Poſterity, leſt their Children ſhould be told hereafter how little their Country was obliged to them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The other ſort, whoſe Follies ought equally to be concealed, I mean as to Naming them, were ſuch who were willing to have them put to the Queſtion in Groſs; Preſuming,<list>
                  <item>1. That either their being ſo Voted, would hand them down Clogg'd with ſo many Inconveniencies as would in Time force the Nations to break the Articles, or bringing them to the neceſſity of falling to pieces, the Treaty ſhould Diſſolve of Courſe. Or,</item>
                  <item>2. That being Voted in general, with ſo many apparent Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties as they pretended to ſee in them, they would infallibly be loſt in this Parliament, and ſo as formerly, the whole Treaty come to nothing.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0554400100:213"/>
That theſe People aim'd not at ſhortning the Labour, but at cutting off the Union it ſelf, is manifeſt, and it was but too appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent afterwards; ſince Debates, and that in every Article; by which they plainly made it appear, that they did not argue ſo much to Rectify and Amend as to Deſtroy, not ſo much to make the Articles more Perfect, or more Explicit, more Advantagious, or more Satisfying, but to annihilate them as Articles, and diſſolve the very Life and Being of the Treaty: And this appeared in that, thro' all the Debates that happened afterwards, they ſhew'd themſelves equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt every Article, and at the ſame time that they Objected againſt things, very ſeldome concern'd themſelves, to propoſe the Alternatives, but rather puſht at overthrowing the ſubſtance of the thing; and if poſſible, to Urge the moſt Neceſſary Articles as Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable and Inconſiſtent.</p>
            <p>As on the one Hand, this diſcovered the Deſign of the Perſons to be <hi>not Amending,</hi> but Deſtroying the Articles: So it manifeſtly expoſed their Ignorance, either of their own Strength in <hi>Scotland,</hi> or of the Strength of their Friends in the South, in both which parts, (had their weak Politicks prevailed to have put the Treaty in general to a Vote) they would have loſt it by a Majority of Voices, the generality of both Nations being fully Convinc'd of the abſolute Neceſſity of a Union, and would rather have Voted it without the Amendments than have loſt it.</p>
            <p>If I am ask'd how I prove this, I think I have a very good Foundation for it.<list>
                  <item>1. In the Motions firſt made in the Parliament Houſe in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, November</hi> 1. 1706, when the strength of the Houſe, as they call it, was effectually Tryed.<list>
                        <item>1. It was Moved that the Parliament now proceed to the farther and more particular Conſideration of the Articles of the Union, in order to Approve them or not.
<p>☞ Nota, <hi>The Articles had been Read and Diſcourſed on ſeverally in the Houſe, and had taken up ſixteen Days, barely Reading them one by one, to hear what one another could ſay, and to give the Members Light into the particulars,</hi> viz. <hi>from the fifteenth of</hi> October, <hi>to the firſt of</hi> November.</p>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. Upon this firſt Motion another followed, <hi>viz.</hi> That the farther Conſideration of the Union be yet delayed for ſome conſiderable Time, that the Sentiments of the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> thereanent be known, and that the Members of Parliament may Conſult thoſe they Repreſent.—<hi>Vide</hi> the Minuts of Parliament, <hi>Numb.</hi> 13. But neither of theſe Attempts could be Carried in the Houſe, nor could they bring the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to a Vote in the Terms the Propoſal was made, <hi>viz.</hi> Of Conſulting Conſtituents, or waiting till the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament ſhould Sit.—To both which I ſhall ſpeak in their Turn.—I only mention it here, to ſhow that it was apparent theſe Motions proceeded only from a deſire to gain Time, which they
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0554400100:214"/>
thought might furniſh a variety of Accidents to diſappoint the whole.—And the many weak Attempts and low Steps ſome Gentlemen took, if poſſible, to delay the proceedings, plainly ſhew'd the very juncture of Time when this was doing, was one of the greateſt Unhappineſſes, <hi>as they thought it,</hi> which befell the Party.</item>
                     </list>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. But I prove this further by the Unanimity of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in paſſing the Treaty, and Ratifying without any Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, what they thought they had Clogg'd with ſo many Inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, on the other ſide, that it could never go down with them.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall further convince the Reader of the manifeſt Deſign of the Party againſt the Union, <hi>as ſuch,</hi>—from their frequent Attempts to Clog the Articles with ſuch Things as they knew it was impoſſible the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> could grant—as a Liberty to Export Wool, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> different Draw-backs, and different Prohibitions in Trade, differing and diſproportioned Exciſes, Cuſtoms and Taxes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of which I ſhall take the Freedom to ſpeak in their Turn.</p>
            <p>But being diſappointed in theſe, they found the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> ſo Unanimous that they paſt all their Amendments, ſome of which were ſuch, as the Party having meerly Clamour'd the Houſe into, were really paſt, not ſo much for any Reſpect to their true Signification, as for the ſake of giving ſome Satisfaction to Uneaſie People.</p>
            <p>How much more then the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> would have paſt the whole Treaty Unaltered, is very evident, and conſequently 'tis as plain that theſe People had taken no aim in their offering to Vote the Articles in the groſs, upon a Preſumption that it would be a mean to make the whole miſcarry.</p>
            <p>The Treaty being concluded in <hi>England,</hi> and the Commiſſioners ſeparated; The next thing was the Meeting of the reſpective Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments of the two Kingdoms for Ratification of the Articles.</p>
            <p>The Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> was firſt, being to meet the third of <hi>October</hi> 1706.—The Queen was Repreſented in this Parliament by the Duke of <hi>Queensberry.</hi>—I know 'tis not the part of a Hiſtorian to make Panegericks, and I think I have given Demonſtrations to the World, as to my ſelf, that I will flatter no Man—But I cannot but give this Teſtimony here, that the Prudence, Calmneſs, Temper and Moderation of this Noble Perſon had theſe two viſible Effects.<list>
                  <item>1. It gave a wonderful Teſtimony to the Queens Judgment, and the right Notions ſhe had entertained of the true ſtate, not of Her Affairs only, but of Her People; that Her Majeſty knew this Work muſt be carried on, not by too much Fire or too much Water, neither by want of Zeal or too much Zeal, That here was an inſolent Party to deal with, who muſt be born with, not Exaſperated, Calm'd not Enraged; That here would be as much Difficulty required to deal with Friends as with Enemies, to Reconcile Jarring Intereſts, Claſhing Parties, and keep all in Temper.—Here was a ſtrong Party for the Union,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0554400100:215"/>
but they were made up of ſeveral Parties, juſt come together as for the Occaſion; They were like <hi>Epicurus</hi>'s Attoms by a ſtrange fortuitous Chance of concurring Circumſtances brought to joyn in this, who were perfect Antipodes in all their former meaſures, and could never agree to act together before; It was not a Matter of the leaſt Conſequence to bring together and keep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſtrong and differing Parties, who acted even in this very Thing, from different Views, and ſome with directly contrary Deſigns,—and it was all the way as Fatiguing to keep ſome Gentlemen in ſuited Temper, for this great Work, as to oppoſe the Fire and Fury of thoſe that ſet themſelves againſt it.—Under the ſolid Conſideration of all this, and with a full view of the Difficulties, at leaſt in general, Her Majeſty pitches upon the Duke of <hi>Queensberry,</hi> as a Perſon of Temper, Prudence and Moderation, unexceptionable in Knowledge of what was before him, reſolute in purſuing it thro' all Difficulties, and of a calm Courage in all the paſſive part of it, of which I ſhall ſpeak more at large hereafter.</item>
                  <item>2. It had this particular Advantage, that it was in a great Meaſure the only thing that carried this difficult Work on, That the Duke in all the Heats and Animoſities of the Party, in all the Convulſions of the Kingdom, carried on the Treaty with Eaſineſs, Temper and extraordinary Conduct, not taking Advantages of the Raſhneſs and Rudeneſs of the People, Pity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rather than apprehending Danger from their Folly, he kept his hand upon the Work, his Eye upon the principals of the Oppoſite Party, he diſappointed all their Meaſures, he let himſelf into the Darkeſt of their Counſels,—he purſued the main and great Work in hand,—and with a Contempt, above my power to expreſs, received all their Inſults, laught at their Threatnings, Treated them Courteouſly and Calmly, under the moſt intollerable Carriage,—and this under the ſupream Conduct, was the only Step by which this great Work could have been brought to paſs.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Had warmer Heads been liſtned to, had Reſentment been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing, had Provocations, almoſt beyond the power of Fleſh and Blood to bear, been prevailing,—<hi>and I muſt own, who was an Eye Witneſs to it all, that I often wondred how it was poſſible to bear ſuch things;</hi> I ſay, had the Gentlemen of Warmer Heads been liſtned to, nay even with ſtrong Reaſonings, and from Men of ſound Judgments too,—all had been undone, and the Nation had been in a Flame, we had been deſtroyed not delivered, the Government had been diſſolved, not United, and <hi>Britain</hi> had by this time been the Seat of Blood, not an United and proſpering Nation.</p>
            <p>But this by the way, the Parliament being to meet, Her Majeſties high Commiſſioner haſtned down to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Queen on all Occaſions, expreſſing Her Hopes that this Treaty would come to a happy Iſſue.—It was generally expected it would be received with the ſame Chearfulneſs and Alacrity in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and all our Eyes were bent upon the Meeting of the Approaching Parliament.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0554400100:216"/>
In this general Expectation, I cannot forbear hinting here, that my Curioſity preſt me to take a Journey thither, and being by all my Friends, to whom I communicated my Deſign, encouraged, to think I might be uſeful there to prompt a Work that I was fully convinced was for the general Good of the whole Iſland; and particularly neceſſary for the ſtrengthning the Proteſtant Intereſt, I was moved purely on theſe Accounts to undertake a long Winter, a Chargeable, and as it proved, a Hazardous Journey.—</p>
            <p>I contemn, as not worth mentioning, the Suggeſtions of ſome People, of my being imployed thither, to carry on the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of a Party.—I have never loved any Parties, but, with my utmoſt Zeal have ſincerely Eſpouſed the Great and Original Intereſt of this Nation, and of all Nations, I mean Truth and Liberty,—and who ever are of that Party, I deſire to be with them.</p>
            <p>However, by this Journey, I had the Opportunity of Seeing and Hearing all the Particulars of the following Tranſactions, and of uſing my beſt Endeavours to Anſwer the many, many, and I muſt ſay of ſome of them, the moſt frivolous and ridiculous Objections, formed and improved there with great Induſtry, againſt every Article of the Union; and this is my Reaſon for mentioning it here, that I may acquaint Poſterity how I came to the Knowledge of what I Write, and for no Oſtentation at all: And as I had the Honour to be frequently ſent for into the ſeveral Committees of Parliament, which were appointed to ſtate ſome difficult Points relating to Equalities, Taxes, Prohibitions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'Tis for thoſe Gentlemen to ſay, whether I was uſeful or not, that's none of my Buſineſs here; but by this means I have the greater Aſſurance to relate the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and Fact as it ſtood before them, and can not be afraid of being detected in any material Miſtake.</p>
            <p>And as this is the Reaſon of my making any mention of my ſelf, ſo the Reader cannot but be content to know, from what Foundation this Relation is handed down to Poſterity, and what aſſurance he has that the Author he Reads was Capable of giving him a right ſtate of the Matter.</p>
            <p>I have hinted already with what Freedom the Scriblers of the Age, if I may give them that Title, took upon them in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Affair, to Determine what ſort of Union was proper to be Treated of, and every one having vented his Politicks this way and that way, as his Intereſt or Party, or particular Imployer Dictated, we thought that Storm had been over; when the Parliament firſt Sat down in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the generality of People ſeem'd very eaſy and forward for a Union in general, as what had long indeed been the deſire of the whole Nation; and therefore the ſtrange Alienation of the Humours of the People, on the general part of it, was the more Wonderful, and the more Unexpected: Of which, and its Cauſes, I am now to ſpeak; of the Effects I ſhall be more particular hereafter.</p>
            <p>On the third of <hi>October</hi> the Parliament met, his Grace Her Majeſties High Commiſſioner opened the Seſſion according to the uſual Forms.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0554400100:217"/>Firſt Her Majeſties Letter to the Parliament was preſented to the Houſe by the High Commiſſioner, and being received, was Read by the <hi>Lord Clerk Regiſter,</hi> and is as follows.</p>

                        <p>SINCE your laſt Meeting, We did Nominat Commiſſioners to Treat of an Union betwixt Our two Kingdoms of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> and by their great Care and Diligence, a Treaty, is happily concluded and laid before Us.</p>
                        <p>We have called You together as ſoon as Our Affairs could Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, That the Treaty may be under Your Conſideration, in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of the Act made in the laſt Seſſion of Our Parliament there; and We hope the Terms will be acceptable to You.</p>
                        <p>The Union has been long Deſired by both Nations, and We ſhall Eſteem it as the greateſt Glory of Our Reign to have it now Perfected, being fully perſwaded, That it muſt prove the greateſt Happineſs of Our People.</p>
                        <p>An intire and perfect Union will be the ſolid Foundation of laſting Peace; It will ſecure Your Religion, Liberty and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, remove the Animoſities amongſt Your Selves, and the Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies and Differences betwixt Our two Kingdoms: It muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe Your Strength, Riches and Trade, and by this Union the whole Iſland being joyned in Affection, and free from all Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of different Intereſts, will be enabled to Reſiſt all its Enemies, ſupport the Proteſtant Intereſt every where, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Liberties of <hi>Europe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We do upon this Occaſion Renew the Aſſurances We have formerly given You, of Our Reſolution to maintain the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, as by Law Eſtabliſhed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Acts of both Parliaments, upon which this Treaty proceeded, having reſerved their reſpective Governments of the Church in each Kingdom; the Commiſſioners have left that Matter Entire; and you have now an Opportunity for doing what may be neceſſary for Security of Your preſent Church Government after the Union within the Limits of SCOTLAND.</p>
                        <p>The ſupport of our Government, and your Own Safety does Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, That You do make neceſſary Proviſion for Maintaining the Forces, Ships and Gariſons, until the Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> ſhall provide for theſe Ends in the United King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                        <p>We have made choice of our Right Truſtie, and Right Entirely Beloved Couſin and Counſellor, <hi>James</hi> Duke of <hi>Queensberry,</hi> to be Our Commiſſioner, and Repreſent Our Royal Perſon, being well ſatisfyed with his Fitneſs for that Truſt, from the Experience We have of his Capacity, Zeal and Fidelity to Our Service, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0554400100:218"/>
the Good of his Countrey; which, as it has determined Us in the Choice, We doubt not but will make him acceptable to You.</p>
                        <p>We have fully Inſtructed him in all things We think may fall under Your Conſideration, and ſeems to be neceſſary at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: Therefore We deſire that you may give entire Truſt and Credit to him.</p>

                        <p>It cannot but be an Encouragement to You to Finiſh the Union at this Time, That GOD Almighty has bleſſed Our Arms, and thoſe of Our Allies with ſo great Succeſs, which gives Us the nearer Proſpect of a happy Peace, and with it You will have the full Poſſeſſion of all the Advantages of this Union; and You have no Reaſon to doubt but the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> will do what is neceſſary on their part, after the Readineſs they have ſhown to remove what might obſtruct the entering on the Treaty. We moſt earneſtly Recommend to You Calmneſs and Unanimity in this Great and Weighty Affair, That the Union may be brought to a happy Concluſion, being the only effectual Way to ſecure your preſent and future Happineſs, and to Diſappoint the Deſigns of Our and Your Enemies, who will doubtleſs on this Occaſion, uſe their outmoſt Endeavours to Prevent or Delay this Union, which muſt ſo much Contribute to our Glory, and the Happineſs of Our People; And ſo We bid You heartily Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well. <hi>Given at Our Court at</hi> Windſor Caſtle <hi>the thirty firſt Day of</hi> July 1706, <hi>and of Our Reign the Fifth Year.</hi>

            <p>This Letter having been twice Read, the Duke of <hi>Queensberry</hi> ſeconded the Queens Letter with the following Speech.<q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>HER Majeſty, by Her Gracious Letter, has acquainted You, That the Treaty of Union, between the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England</hi> (purſuant to an Act made in your laſt Seſſion) has been happily agreed on, which is now in my Lord Regiſters Hands, ready to be laid before You.</p>
                  <p>The Lords Commiſſioners for this Kingdom, have been Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and Zealous in concerting Juſt and Reaſonable Terms; and, it muſt be acknowledged, We met with a very Fair and Friendly Diſpoſition in the Lords Commiſſioners on the other Part.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0554400100:219"/>
The Treaty has, with all Humility, been preſented to the Queen, and was moſt Graciouſly received; and tho' no Reign was ever ſo truly Great, for Wiſe and Steady Councils, and ſo many Important Succeſſes, as that of Her Majeſty; yet, you ſee, She is pleaſed to Eſteem the Perfecting of this Union, as the greateſt Glory of Her Reign, being the moſt ſolid Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a laſting Security to the Proteſtant Religion, and the Liberties of <hi>Europe,</hi> and of Peace and Happineſs to Her People.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Reaſons, I doubt not, will make the Treaty acceptable to You; And I perſwade my ſelf that you will proceed with ſuch Calmneſs and Impartiality, as the Weight of the Subject Requires, and as becomes ſo great an Aſſembly.</p>
                  <p>The Lords Commiſſioners for both Kingdoms were Limited in the Matter of Church Government; For the Security of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Government in this Church, you have the Laws already made for its Eſtabliſhment, the Queens Repeated Aſſurances to preſerve it, and I am Impowered to Conſent to what may be further neceſſary after the Union.</p>
                  <p>Her Majeſty has been pleaſed to Recommend to You to make Proviſion for the Forces, Ships and Gariſons, which is very neceſſary, the Subſidies granted at Your laſt Meeting being run out; ſo, I doubt not, You will ſpeedily Renew them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am not inſenſible of the Difficulties that attend the Weighty Character, it has pleaſed Her Majeſty to Honour me with, but with your favourable Aſſiſtance, (upon which I very much Rely) I hope, by my Zeal and Fidelity for Her Majeſties Service, and the Good of my Countrey, which are inſeparable, to Diſcharge my Duty on this extraordinary Occaſion.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And this was followed with another Speech by the Earl of <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> Lord Chancellor of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which I have alſo inſerted here, as follows<q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IT hath been, and is the great Happineſs of this Nation, That the Queen Our Sovereign, hath always made it the chief Deſign of Her Reign, to protect Her Subjects, in the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all their Rights and Privileges, to Promove their Good, and to Eſtabliſh their Peace and Proſperity, upon ſure and laſting Foundations.</p>
                  <p>For theſe Ends, Her Majeſty, in Her moſt Gracious Letter, doth, with great Earneſtneſs, Recommend to You the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Union of the Two Kingdoms, and has plainly and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0554400100:220"/>
fully laid before You the great Advantages that this Union muſt bring with it to all <hi>BRITAIN,</hi> and in particular to this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                  <p>The Lords Commiſſioners Named by Her Majeſty for this Kingdom to Treat of this Union, have endeavoured to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge this great Truſt, with all Fidelity, and have Agreed to ſuch Terms and Conditions, as, I hope, ſhall be found Juſt, Honourable and Advantageous: The Treaty has been already received very Graciouſly by Her Majeſty, and is now ready to be Reported to you for your Conſideration.</p>
                  <p>I do not think it proper at this time to deſcend into the particular Articles of the Treaty; I ſhall only beg leave to ſay in general, That it muſt be of great Advantage to have this whole Iſland Unite under one Government, and Conjoyned Intirely in Intereſt and Affection, having Equality of all Rights and Privileges, with a free Communication and Intercourſe of Trade, which muſt certainly Eſtabliſh Our Security, Augment Our Strength, and Increaſe Our Trade and Riches.</p>
                  <p>We can never expect a more favourable Juncture for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating this Union, than at preſent, when Her Majeſty has not only Recommended it, but Declared, That She will Eſteem it the greateſt Glory of Her Reign, to have it perfected; And when the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> has ſhown their Inclinations for it, by Removing all theſe Obſtacles that did ly in the way of the Treaty: And it muſt alſo be acknowledged, that the Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>England</hi> did Teſtify their good Diſpoſition all along in this Affair: And the Great and Glorious Succeſſes wherewith GOD has Bleſſed Her Majeſties Arms, and thoſe of Her Allies, give us the Hope of a Near and Advantageous Peace, whereby we will be put in the Poſſeſſion, and attain to the full Enjoyment of all the Liberties and Privileges of Trade, now offered by the Treaty.</p>
                  <p>The Commiſſioners of both Sides, have only Treated of ſuch Things as concern the Civil Government, Liberties, Privileges, Trade, and Taxes; but found themſelves Limited as to the Church-Government, that being Reſerved to each Kingdom by the reſpective Acts of Parliament, upon which the Treaty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded: And you have now not only the Laws already made, with Her Majeſties moſt Gracious Repeated Aſſurances, for maintaining and continuing Presbyterian Church-Government within this Kingdom; But this further Opportunity of making ſuch Conditions and Proviſions, as ſhall be found Neceſſary for its Security, after the Concluſion of this Union, within the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of <hi>SCOTLAND.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Her Majeſty Recommends to You to provide the neceſſary Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies for the Troops, Gariſons and Ships; The Funds formerly given are expired: And therefore I doubt not, but you will eaſily comply with what is ſo plainly Neceſſary for the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the publick Safety, and preventing the Deſigns of Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies now in time of War.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0554400100:221"/>
                     <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Since We have now the Opportunity of Eſtabliſhing for Our Selves and Our Poſterity, by this Union with <hi>England,</hi> all that concerns Our Religion and Liberties, together with the moſt valuable Privileges of Trade; I am hopeful, that You will proceed to the Conſideration of the Articles of the Treaty, in ſuch manner as ſhall bring it to the deſired Concluſion, and it cannot but tend to the laſting Honour of this Seſſion of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to have ſo happily finiſhed this moſt Important and Weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Matter.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I chooſe to place theſe Speeches here, rather than in the <hi>Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix,</hi> becauſe they ſo immediatly relate to the Story, and to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the Thread of the Story, which now comes to be Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed of, that I thought they could not be ſo properly Tranſpoſed.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not enter here into the particular Vote of every Day, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Abſtracted thoſe things by way of Journal, in another part of the Work, with Notes upon them, drawn from my own Obſervation, and from the generous Aſſiſtance of many Honourable Gentlemen preſent in the very Occurrences of every Day, and of Impartial Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byaſſed Judgment in the Affair it ſelf;—But one thing I muſt remark here, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt thing the Houſe did, after the Speeches above, was to call for the Treaty of the Union, as it was drawn up and ſigned by the Commiſſioners,—and having cauſed it to be Read in the Houſe.—Upon ſome general Debate, which laſted not long, it was Ordered to be Printed, and Copies to be Delivered to the Members of Parliament, which was accordingly done.</p>
            <p>Till this very Day all things had gone on well, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in general were very well pleaſed with the Thoughts of the Union—They had not yet had Subject for the Turbulent Spirits to work upon, and having in general only Diſcourſed upon the Advantages of both ſides, which were indeed in themſelves viſible enough,—the Clamorous Party which followed had not Concerted their Meaſures, from what Topicks to work upon the Humours of the People.</p>
            <p>No ſooner then were the Articles Printed, and put into the Hands of the People,—but the Gentlemen, who ſet themſelves up againſt them, began to Preach upon the general Heads, as their Humour and Talent inſtructed them, in order to poſſeſs the People againſt the Particulars.</p>
            <p>I cannot but diſtinguiſh here between the ſeveral parties that now oppoſed the Union: In my Obſervation there were Four ſeveral ſorts of People, who were againſt this Treaty, and who, either within Doors, or without, either in Parliament, in Commiſſion, or in Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, joyned to Oppoſe, Clamour at, or Object againſt the Union;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0554400100:222"/>
and 'tis really neceſſary here to diſtinguiſh of them, that when I talk, <hi>as I ſhall have frequent Occaſion in the Proceſs of this Story,</hi> of the Oppoſers, and the Parties Oppoſing, it may, by the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their Oppoſing, be diſtinguiſht who is mean't; For I ſhall not name Perſons in my Diſcourſe of thoſe things, not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it neceſſary to make this Hiſtory a Satyr upon any one Family, or Record to Poſterity the Steps they took in particular, or their Reaſons for it in this Affair.</p>
            <p>Where particular Actions, more than ordinary publick, have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed Perſons, that is their own Act and Deed, and lyes not at my Door; But to come to the Heads of Parties.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There was the profeſt <hi>Jacobite</hi> Party who Oppoſed the Treaty, purely on the Account of the Succeſſion, which they ſaw evidently was ſtruck at, and would be effectually fixt, contrary to their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and Eternally Excluſive of the Family they Adhered to; And theſe Declared their Averſion to the Union, upon all Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, publickly and fairly, and, for ought I know, were ſome of the honeſteſt of the Enemies to the Treaty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There was the Diffenters from the Church, or the Epiſcopal Party, theſe Oppoſed the Union alſo publickly, as it tended in its Conſequences, entirely to ſettle the Presbyterian Eſtabliſhment, for ever to fore-cloſe them, and bar the Door againſt all poſſibility of their Recovering the Government of the Church in the manner they deſired; Since they ſaw but too plainly, however blind others were to it, that this Treaty would ſo ſettle the Presbyterian Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and ſo fortify it by Law, that if ever they ſhould attempt to Recover the Hierarchy of Epiſcopacy here, even the very Epiſcopal Church, their own Brethren in <hi>England,</hi> would be obliged to Oppoſe and Suppreſs them.—And theſe, ſo far as they acted fairly, were honeſt and open Enemies alſo to the Union.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There was a miſtaken People, <hi>I hope I may ſay ſo much of my own Opinion without Offence, for truly I think them miſtaken,</hi> who, tho this Union was calculated entirely for their Safety, and tended to their indiſſoluble Eſtabliſhment, as by the Alarm of their Enemies was very viſibly demonſtrated, yet were drawn in by their Fears, and, I doubt, thoſe Fears too much inflam'd by the Policy and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Artifice of Whiſperers and diſguiſed Enemies, to Oppoſe the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as dangerous to the Church, and as interfereing with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral publick Engagements the Nation had entered into.—Theſe, or moſt of them, were Honeſt, Well-meaning, and ſome of them moſt pious and valuable People; However ſome of them might ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Moderation in the manner of their Diſſenting, and a little too warmly puſh on their private Opinions.</p>
            <p>Of theſe People I ſhall be far from ſaying any thing ſevere, for indeed I cannot think any thing ill of them, I mean as to Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Evil. The Weakneſs any of them might diſcover in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding, countenancing, or giving a Name to the Diſorders of the Times, was rather the Artifice of a Party, who eneavoured to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame the Nation, and put the Appearance of it upon them, Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0554400100:223"/>
their Names upon every Action, and Intituling every Tumult to their Protection.</p>
            <p>But deſcending to particulars, we ſhall find; that however forward, and if their Enemies deſire it, I'll venture to ſay, Indiſcreet ſome of them might be, in diſcovering their Sentiments with Warmth in Converſation, yet upon all publick Occaſions their whole Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Treaty was confin'd to legal Applications and peaceable Endeavours, the Tumult at <hi>Dumfries</hi> only excepted; For as to that of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> it was wholly <hi>Jacobite,</hi> meer Rabble and Tumult of that Party, and the poor Blinded Commonality Deluded and Impoſed upon by them, contrary to the Opinions, and without the Aſſiſtance of the People I am ſpeaking of, as will appear hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But laſtly, There was a Party, who Vigorouſly and Violently, by all manner of Artifice, Trick, and Underhand Dealing, Oppoſed this Union, meerly upon Politick <hi>Enigmas,</hi> Reaſons of Party, found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon State Principles, Ambition, Emulation, Party-Pick, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, and a vaſt variety of unhappy Conjunctions, as ſerv'd to Enflame and Agitate their Spirits againſt it.—And as theſe were many of them Gentlemen of the firſt Rank, and ſome of them other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe even well enough Affected to both the Succeſſion, and to the Church; So I ſhall ſhow more Reſpect to their Perſons, than to Record them in a Caſe which I promiſe my ſelf, they will ſome time or other reckon it their Misfortune to have Oppoſed, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be as Zealous now its finiſhed to preſerve, as they were before it was finiſhed, to prevent.</p>
            <p>Yet I muſt Confeſs, it was to theſe Gentlemen we owe the Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Nation with ſo many unhappy Prejudices, the Alarming them with ſuch ungrounded Apprehenſions, and the Embarking the Common People againſt it, meerly on the appearing of ſuch Men in it, on whoſe Judgments, and on whoſe Quality they had ſo much Dependence.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the Fatal People againſt this Treaty, theſe ſtruggled within Doors and without, theſe brought to paſs that monſtrous Conjunction of Oppoſite and Diſcording Parties, and brought the <hi>Jacobites</hi> to cry out for the Succeſſion, the Epiſcopal People to want Security for the Presbyterian Church, the Tory to cry out, Breach of Covenant, and the well Minded Presbyterian ignorantly excite the People to a Rabble.</p>
            <p>Theſe went about Preaching Oppoſition in every Shape, juſt as it ſuited the People they had to do with, they undertook to join <hi>Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronian</hi> and Perſecutor; Presbyterian and Papiſt; Proteſtant Succeſſion and <hi>Jacobitiſm;</hi> Parties as Oppoſite as the Elements, as Diſtant as the <hi>Poles;</hi> And theſe are the People I deſire to be underſtood of, when in this Book I talk in general of the Oppoſers of this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I Name no Body, whoever the Coat fits, they are Welcome to wear it.</p>
            <p>Having thus deſcribed the Parties, it would be endleſs to enter into their ſeveral Methods, by which they Concurr'd together, <hi>I do</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0554400100:224"/>
               <hi>not ſay Confederated,</hi> for that was Impracticable, their ſeveral Aims conſider'd; But all concurr'd nevertheleſs, to put the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Affair into the following Confuſions.</p>
            <p>Till the Printing of theſe Articles, as I have already noted, the People were generally very deſirous of the Union, as a thing which tended to the putting an end to all former Animoſities, bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ancient Feuds between the Nations, and removing the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions good People on both ſides had juſtly entertain'd of a new Rupture, in caſe of the Queens Demiſe.</p>
            <p>But no ſooner were theſe Articles printed and diſpers'd, but as if every Body had ſet themſelves to raiſe Objections, form Scruples, and find Faults in them, the whole Nation fell into a general kind of Labour, in Canvaſſing, Banding, and Cavilling at the Conditions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The poor People were terrifyed with the Apprehenſions of inſupportable Taxes, Loſs of Imployment, Want of all Things, and large Payments upon their Salt and Malt.</p>
            <p>They were again filled with ſtrange Stories of being ſold to the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> their Parliament, Crown, Scepter, and even their Name as a Nation to be loſt, and all carryed to <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Merchants were frighted with printed Schemes of Exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Cuſtoms and Impoſitions, and the ſtrangeſt Projects of Trade were ſpread about the Kingdom that ever were ſeen, which being gotten into the Heads of thoſe People, who yet, by their Concern in Trade, one would have thought, in common Charity, ſhould have known better, were ſo managed, that it is hardly poſſible to believe, ſuch prepoſterous Notions could prevail upon People, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe Knowing enough; Such as, 1. The Profitableneſs of a Trade to <hi>France,</hi> tho all the Returns from thence was in periſhable Goods, ſuch as Wines, Brandy, and Trifles for Conſumption at Home.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Unprofitableneſs of a Trade to <hi>England,</hi> whither their Export of Cattle and Linen, amounting to above Two Hundred Thouſand Pound <hi>Sterling per Annum,</hi> brought back very little but ready Money.</p>
            <p>Thoſe were ſtrange things, but ſo popularly puſh'd on, that they amuſed the whole Nation, and the poor People were told, the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would beggar the Country, and ſtarve the Nation; And this talk'd up to an Extravagant Height, made the poor perfectly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted.—Taxes were calculated, without allowing for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of the Cuſtoms, in other Caſes taken off, without conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Taxes on Malt and Salt were remote, and probable never to be laid, without conſidering Proportions, Equalities, and the Reaſons, Nature, or Neceſſity of things, that the poor People were Exaſperated to the higheſt Degree, and fill'd with Apprehenſions, that they ſhould have neither Food to eat, nor Beer to drink, that they were juſt to be ſacrificed to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> be ſubdued, ruin'd and deſtroy'd.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thoſe Articles, which left ſome things Contingent to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary Juriſdiction, were improved to perſwade the People, that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0554400100:225"/>
all their Laws, Liberties, Eſtates, and whatever was near and dear to them, was left intirely to the Determination and abſolute Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament; In which, they being to have but a ſmall Repreſentation, ſuppoſing their own Members to be always Unbyaſs'd and Impartial, they ſhould always be Over-ruled, Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted, Oppreſs'd and Subjected: To talk to them, in this Caſe, of the Words <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nalterable</hi> and <hi>Perpetual,</hi> was to ſay nothing; To ſay, the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament could make no Alterations, was to ſay nothing. Theſe things had ſo filled the Heads of the People, that nothing could pacify them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But above all this, and which was yet moſt unhappy, as it tended to an univerſal Alarm, and to Embark a great many Sober and well Affected People againſt it, it was carefully repreſented to be Dangerous to the Church Government, That all the Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would be ſubjected to a Vote of Parliament, and a Parliament, where the Prelates had a Voice againſt them; that if the Biſhops ſhould pleaſe to Vote Epiſcopacy into <hi>Scotland,</hi> they getting a Majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the Parliament, it would be done; that the Church would be ruin'd; that if ſhe obtain'd a Tolleration, it was the moſt that could be expected in this Caſe, and that was precarious and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and what they muſt come a begging to the Biſhops for. This made an unſpeakable Diſorder in the Minds of the People, and all the Methods taken to convince them, that the Parliament could not encroach upon the Church, or any ways concern themſelves about it, were to no purpoſe; they declared the Act of Security to be inſufficient, railed at the <hi>Scots</hi> Parliaments conſenting in blank to the Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and inveighed againſt a Tolleration of Epiſcopacy here, which they ſaid would be the Conſequence.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And laſt of all came an Univerſal Cry, that this was a plain Breach of the National Covenant and Solemn League, by which the Nation had bound themſelves by Oath to GOD Almighty, among other things, to endeavour the pulling down the Epiſcopal Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, and to Reform, to the utmoſt of their Power, the Church of <hi>England</hi> alſo.—All theſe things were not only brought as Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but puſh'd with ſo much Heat, ſo much want of Charity and Courteſy, that really it began to break all good Neighbourhood, it ſowred all Societies, and the National Quarrel broke into Families, who were ever jangling, divided, and oppoſite one among another.—Nor was there any offering the Expoſitions, no not of their own Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, who had declared, that the Obligations of the Covenant intitul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to no other Endeavour of Reforming the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but ſuch as conſiſted in Prayers, Exhortations, Chriſtian Arguments and Examples, <hi>Vide</hi> Doctor <hi>Rule</hi>'s <hi>Vindication of the Church of</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>P.</hi> 16. However there was no talking to the People at this Time, nothing but Patience and Time could be expected to remedy it.</p>
            <p>In this Juncture, and if poſſible to compleat the Diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the People, one Gentleman, by Name Mr. <hi>Hodges,</hi> and who had formerly been ſuppoſed to write for the Common Good of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and was rewarded for it by Parliament, by what Fate, Party,

            <p>This is not a place to confute theſe things, they did not want their Anſwer in their Seaſon, and the People in time did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſee their Error, and how this Author had, by manifeſt For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, impoſed upon them.—But ſtill this did the Miſchief it was calculated for, before any Anſwer could take place; for this Book was eagerly eſpouſed by the Party, and there was no room to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion it was writ at their private Appointment: It was induſtriouſly ſpread over all the Kingdom in a few days, and no Body of any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration but had a ſight of it; nay, it was handed about among the poor People, to ſtir them up and enflame them, and it had all the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs the wickedeſt Creature could wiſh for; It confounded and amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the People, the dark Side of every thing was ſhown them, and the true Senſe of things concealed, and who can but think the People thus abuſed ſhould run out into Extravagancies.</p>
            <p>It is not ſo much, that a Book fraught with Abſurdities, Falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Contradictions, merits a Note in this Work: But I think 'tis abſolutely neceſſary, to ſhew where the general Diſaffection at the Union began, ſince it was manifeſt, that, till this time, the People were, in general, very well ſatisfyed, and the Proſpect of an Union was very grateful to them.</p>
            <p>It cannot but be ſome Satisfaction to all thoſe who have heartily eſpouſed this Union, that the Oppoſition had ſuch a beginning; that its Foundation was laid in the Party-Prejudices of a few, whoſe Refuge and Support was the meer Aſſiſtance of Falſities and unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd Forgeries, by which the poor ignorant People were amuſed, impoſed upon, and led blindly on, even to the Brink of their own Deſtruction; from whence, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0554400100:227"/>
It was at leaſt a Fortnight, that the Heats of the People, on Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of theſe Articles, continued, before they produced any extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant Effects, and this time was generally ſpent in the Parliament, in reading over, diſcourſing upon, and preparing to Debate the Articles.</p>
            <p>For it may be noted, as will appear by the Minuts, that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles were read over one by one in the Houſe, before the main read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, and the Members were admitted to ſpeak freely their Opinions on every Head, but to put nothing to the Vote.</p>
            <p>During this Work, which was from the third of <hi>October</hi> to the <hi>firſt</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> the Ferment increaſed, and the whole Kingdom ſeemed to be in a Diſorder, ſome Accounts of which may be very proper here.</p>
            <p>There had always been a ſtrong Oppoition in this Country to the preſent Settlement, both Eccleſiaſtical and Civil, and the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution was not eſtabliſh'd without a Civil War, which, tho it was but ſhort, came to a Deciſive Battel, which had this particular ſeeming Contradiction in it, that the Kings Army loſt the Battel, and got the Victory.</p>
            <p>The Viſcount of <hi>Dundee,</hi> formerly <hi>Graham</hi> of <hi>Claverhouſe,</hi> headed the Malecontent Party, the Kings Forces were routed, but <hi>Dundee,</hi> unhappily for his Party, was found among the Slain: His Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Party, by his Death, not only loſt the Advantage of their Victory, but having loſt the Chief of their Army, they ſoon diſperſed for want of a Head, and the preſent Eſtabliſhment prevailed.</p>
            <p>But ſtill they left the North Highlands full of Diſaffection to the preſent Government, never ſubmitting, but, as it were, by meer Force, even to this Day.</p>
            <p>All the Remains of this Party, called particularly the <hi>Jacobite,</hi> were unanimouſly againſt the Union, as they were againſt the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſon.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Epiſcopal Party were againſt it as before, becauſe they fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw, that the Presbyterian Church would ſtrengthen their Settlement, by the Addition of <hi>England,</hi> who by this Treaty, would on all Occaſions, be obliged to ſupport and defeud them, and ſo the Party would of Courſe be finally excluded.</p>
            <p>Theſe two Parties ſaw themſelves abandoned by thoſe who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly oppoſed the Succeſſion on different Reaſons, and that thoſe Gentlemen had fallen into the Union, as is before hinted; And tho I will not ſay, that they and the Papiſts and <hi>Jacobite</hi> Party were all in an Intereſt before, yet it was manifeſt they fell in together now, unanimouſly to oppoſe the Union.</p>
            <p>What Oppoſition they had formerly made was under Hand, partly by Solicitation of Friends, and Claſhing of Parties; they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways look'd on it as a thing remote and impracticable, and a thing which the conſtant Jarrs, they induſtriouſly promoted among the People, and particularly the National Antipathy would always prevent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0554400100:228"/>
But when, contrary to their Expectation, they found, That the Union was brought to a Head in <hi>England;</hi> That the Court puſh'd heartily to bring it to a Concluſion; and to their great Surpriſe found the ſeveral Oppoſing Parties joyn'd together; and that every one, from what different Proſpects ſoever, concurr'd in the Union, and ſeem'd to make their Court to the Times on the Foot of the Zeal they ſhould ſhow for this new Proſpect of Settlement.</p>
            <p>This exceedingly alarm'd them; and they found, That now or never was the time to oppoſe it; That if it obtain'd now upon the Humour of the People, it was certain to be finiſhed, and they and their Cauſe effectually fore-cloſed, from all Hopes of ever retrieving their Intereſt.</p>
            <p>No ſooner therefore was the Parliament met, and the Eyes of al the Nation fix'd upon the Event of this great Affair, but all the Engines of the ſeveral Parties were ſet to Work: Some to Expoſe, ſome to Defend both the Proceedings that were already perfected in <hi>England,</hi> and thoſe that were now entring upon.</p>
            <p>Innumerable Pamphlets were printed and diſpers'd over the whole Kingdom; and induſtriouſly Harrangu'd upon by the Engines of the reſpective Parties, as their Intereſts led them.</p>
            <p>The next Step was to find out popular Arguments to gratify the Humours of the ſeveral Orders or Diviſions of the People; and to alarm them with thoſe things in particular, which their ſeveral Tempers, Parties, or Deſigns led them moſt to apprehend.</p>
            <p>Thus they ſpread all poſſible Scandals and Satyrs againſt the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in general, as well in Print as in Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>As that it was Diſhonourable to <hi>Scotland;</hi> Surrendering her Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignity and Conſtitution, Subjecting her to her Ancient and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable Enemies.—That it was Depreſſing the Honour and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of a Kingdom, that had Defended her Liberty againſt <hi>England</hi> with ſuch Gallantry and Bravery, for ſo many Hundred Years, as if ſhe was leſs able to Fight now than ever, her Sons leſs Bold, her Gentry leſs Daring, or leſs willing to Die for their Country; That now they were to be Slaves, and muſt run to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> to Vote with a Handful of Members, who would never be able to carry a Queſtion, or to make any Weight there, but juſt for Forms ſake ſit in the Houſe, and be laugh'd at.</p>
            <p>That the Figure <hi>Scotland</hi> would make in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, would not be like a Kingdom, but like a Province; That one County in <hi>England. viz.</hi> of <hi>Cornwall</hi> ſent up as many Members, one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, as the whole Kingdom; and that this was an Eternal Badge of their Subjection, and the like.</p>
            <p>This was a general Cry, and began to be very popular: The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple cryed out they were <hi>Scots</hi> Men, and they would be <hi>Scots</hi> Men ſtill; They contemn'd the Name of <hi>Britains,</hi> fit for the <hi>Welſh</hi> Men, who were made the Scoff of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> after they had reduc'd them.—<hi>Scotland</hi> had always had a Name and a Fame in Forreign Courts; They were Naturalized in <hi>France,</hi> Enjoy'd for many Years great Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges there, and Honours bought with the Blood of their Anceſtors;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0554400100:229"/>
and they would never give away their Birthright, tho ſome of their Nation had been driving a Bargain for themſelves, at the Price of Selling their Country.—Thus they fill'd the Mouths of the common People, who would go about the Street crying, No Union, and call the Treaters Traitors, and ſoon after began to threaten them openly to their Faces.</p>
            <p>The Succeſs the Party obtain'd here to incenſe the common People was too much, not to encourage them to proceed; And the next Step was, to infuſe like Prejudices into the Heads of the ſeveral Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Perſwaſions of People. And this was divided into two.
<list>
                  <item>1. To perſwade the Honeſt Presbyterian, that the Church would be ſubjected to the Votes, the Power and the Oppreſſion of the Epiſcopal Hierarchy in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I will not poſitively aſſert, that this was a meer <hi>Jacobite</hi> Chime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, or had its pure Original in Plot and Deſign; The Fears and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of Honeſt People might at firſt lead them a great way in that Caſe: But I believe no Body will take Offence if I ſay thoſe Fears and Apprehenſions were ſoon made a Handle by this Party, who ſat ready to take all Occaſions, and they immediatly raiſed a Cry; That the Church was betray'd; That Epiſcopacy was coming in upon them; That in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament they ſhould be ſubjected to the Plurality of Voices, in which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Biſhops, beſide their Influence on the Nobility and Gentry, had alſo their own Voices: And that, if the Union ever went forward, they ſhould be certainly ſuppreſſed by the Prelates, and reduced to a Tolleration at beſt, if perhaps that ſhould be obtained.</p>
            <p>I cannot be cenſur'd by any Body, in this Concluſion of mine, if it be remembred, what ſtrange Advocats the Church had at this Time,—when thoſe that never came to the Church, never owned the Juriſdiction of the Church; but on the contrary, were always known to maltreat her, reject her Eſtabliſhment, and never joyned with her, either in Doctrine or Diſcipline, Worſhip or Government, went up and down, Exclaiming at the Deſigns of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Biſhops, to overthrow the Eſtabliſhed Church.</p>
            <p>Nor will it be remote to the purpoſe to obſerve, that when the Act for the Security of the Church came to be Debated in Parliament, thoſe very Gentlemen appear'd Zealous to obtain larger Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Voted the Overture inſufficient for the Churches Safety, who were never ſuppoſed to owe the Church ſo much good Will or ever before were obſerved to make her Security any part of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern: Nay, nor were ever known ſo much as to joyn with the Church, owne her Diſcipline, or call themſelves Members.—But this ceaſed to be a Myſtery, when ſome of thoſe Gentlemen honeſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, this was only done to ſtrengthen their Intereſt againſt the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and openly began to draw their Arguments into a Chain of Succeſſive Neceſſities; That, from the very <hi>Papiſt</hi> to the <hi>Jacobite,</hi> the <hi>Prelatiſt,</hi> the <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> the <hi>Cameronian,</hi> every one might find Reaſons to Act together againſt the Union, as a Common and a National Evil. But of this I ſhall find Occaſion to ſpeak again preſently.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0554400100:230"/>
The early ſpreading theſe Prejudices had but too much Succeſs; the Party applyed themſelves, as they found it ſuit the <hi>Genius</hi> and Tempers of the People.</p>
            <p>To ſome it was Fatal to the Church, and they would be ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Prelacy, and the Plurality of Votes in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament.</p>
            <p>To others it was Dangerous to the State, and the Independency, Honour and Sovereignity of the Kingdom was betray'd and given up.</p>
            <p>Nay to the very Children and moſt ignorant People, they had their Arguments; ſuch as, That the Honours, as they call them, the Crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi> Sword and Scepter, ſhould be carryed away to <hi>England;</hi> And the Boys and Mob were invited by a great Perſon, in a Melancholly Tone, to go in and ſee the Ancient Crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for that it would ſoon be carryed away, and they might never ſee it any more.</p>
            <p>To others they had a more ſubtil Argument; which tho it was perhaps begun among thoſe that had no ill in their Deſign, <hi>as is ſaid of the firſt,</hi> yet they carefully improved this, as they did all other things, to the general Confuſion of the Times: And this was a Notion, that it was abſolutely againſt the National Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, in which the People had Sworn to two Things, which this Treaty directly would contraveen and render impoſſible.<list>
                  <item>1<hi>ſt,</hi>—That <hi>Scotland</hi> had Sworn in the National Covenant, to ſupport the Sovereignity of the Kingdom, which they ſaid was now to be given up.</item>
                  <item>2. That <hi>Scotland</hi> had engaged to pull down Epiſcopacy in <hi>England,</hi> to the utmoſt of their Power.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The ſtarting theſe two things had two fatal Proſpects; which indeed, had they not been both over-ruled by that Secret Hand, which had ſingularly appeared in the carrying this Treaty on thro' ſo many ſeemingly inſuperable Difficulties, might have involved both Nations in Confuſion.</p>
            <p>From the firſt of theſe, they pretended to be bound to preſerve the State in its immediate ſeparate Condition; as if Confederating with, and Joyning to a more powerful Nation, on Terms Honourable, and tending to ſupport the Sovereignity and Power of the whole, was not conſiſting with that part of the Covenant; which could no otherwiſe be underſtood there, than to ſignify the Supporting and Defending the Conſtitution of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as it was or ſhould be legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Eſtabliſh'd.</p>
            <p>As to the other Suggeſtion, it was effectually Anſwer'd by one of the moſt Learned Divines of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> Doctor <hi>Rule;</hi> where he Explains the Meaning of the Covenant to be in that Caſe, no Attempt by Force to reduce the Church of <hi>England, &amp;c.</hi> but <hi>what we are bound to by</hi> the Covenant, <hi>is not to Reform them, but to Concur with them, when lawfully called, to Advance Reformation either there, or any where elſe: And it is far from our Thoughts to go beyond that Boundary,</hi> Vindication of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> Pag. 16.</p>
            <p>But this Clamour had another Effect, which might have been as Fatal in its Conſequence, had not the Scene of Affairs been very
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0554400100:231"/>
much changed in <hi>England:</hi> For this very Pretence, which the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal Party prompted as much as in them lay here, and drew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Good and Well meaning People into, in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as an Objection againſt the Union, they immediately turned upon them in <hi>England,</hi> and ſet ſome of the Church of <hi>England</hi> Clergy, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe warm Gentlemen who were againſt the Union; They ſet them, <hi>I ſay,</hi> upon raiſing of the old Alarm again, of the Danger of the Church, ariſing from the Union; even from this very Argument, that the Presbyterians in <hi>Scotland</hi> were Sworn by the Covenant, to do their utmoſt to pull down Epiſcopacy in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall, as little as poſſible, concern this Hiſtory with Debates of any of our Party Quarrels; but the Contradiction which theſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple fell into, was remarkable; and could it have been conſidered, might have very much Expoſed them.</p>
            <p>For if it was true, that the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> had Sworn to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne Epiſcopacy; and that the Presbyterians were againſt the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe it would deprive them of that Power, and for ever ty their Hands from that Work,—Then they were but ill Friends to the Church of <hi>England</hi> among her own Clergy, who were for that Reaſon againſt the Union.—And it was an Argument of the ſtrongeſt Nature to prove, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſhould have been with all her Heart for the Union, if ſhe had the leaſt Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of her own Intereſt.</p>
            <p>It is plain from Doctor <hi>Rule,</hi> that the Obligation of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant extended no further, than to oblige them to concur with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> when lawfully called to a General Reformation.</p>
            <p>But the Party in <hi>England</hi> run theſe things a great deal higher, and plyed the warm Addreſſes of the People; and eſpecially one of the <hi>Cameronians,</hi> and of their Leader Mr. <hi>John Hepburn,</hi> againſt the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; calling what thoſe weak People put into their Addreſſes, the Act and Deed of the whole Presbyterian Church of <hi>Scotland:</hi> When 'tis known, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That Mr. <hi>Hepburn</hi>'s Addreſs had but ſeven Hands to it. 2. Thoſe People, tho in other things many of them are good People, yet do neither owne the Church nor the State; neither the Civil Government nor the Eccleſiaſtick. Of which I ſhall be larger hereafter.</p>
            <p>By theſe Artifices 'tis hardly credible, what Averſions they raiſed in the People againſt the Union in general, even before the Articles were made publick, or at all Debated in the Houſe.</p>
            <p>But when the Articles were printed, and every one began to read Lectures upon them, according as their ſeveral Fancies guided them, or their Intereſt ſeem'd to claſh with them, I want Words to expreſs what a Clamour was raiſed on all Hands, and what Feuds began to appear in every Corner of the Nation.</p>
            <p>Parties and People, whoſe Intereſts and Principles differed as much as Light and Darkneſs; who were as contrary in Opinion, and as far aſunder in every thing, as the <hi>Poles,</hi> ſeemed to draw together here.—'Twas the moſt monſtrous Sight in the World, to ſee the <hi>Jacobite</hi> and the <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> the perſecuting Prelatic <hi>Non-juror</hi> and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0554400100:232"/>
the <hi>Cameronian,</hi> the <hi>Papiſt</hi> and the Reformed <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> Parle toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Joyn Intereſt, and Concert Meaſures together.</p>
            <p>To ſee the <hi>Jacobites</hi> at <hi>Glaſgow</hi> Huzzaing the Mob, and Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging them to have a Care of the Church; The High-flying Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Diſſenter crying out, the Overture was not a ſufficient Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for the Church.</p>
            <p>Such Convulſions as theſe Agitated the whole Kingdom; And it was the Unaccountableſt Thing that ever was known, to find a Nation, That, but a few Months before, were earneſtly crying out for an Union, and the nearer the better; and that were fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of the Neceſſity they had of this Union, now fly in the Face of their Maſters, and upbraid the Gentlemen, who managed it, with Selling and Betraying their Country, and Surrendering their Conſtitution, Sovereignity and Independency to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſuch was the Clamour againſt the Treaters, that I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and I aſſure you, I do not give my private Opinion in it,—had the Articles of the Treaty been publiſhed before the Treaters came home; and the Feuds been the ſame againſt them as were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, there was not many of them would dared to have gone home, without a Guard to protect them.</p>
            <p>The Merchants, the Burghs, the Country People, all cryed out of Oppreſſion, and of Ruine and Deſtruction in Trade.—And yet, the Amendments that were offered by that Party to the Articles, in the Time of their Debate, were ſo ſmall and ſo trifling, tho they had a free Debate on every Head, that their own Friends cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out upon them, for demanding ſo little; and uſed this as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt them afterwards, that they might have had more, if they had asked it.</p>
            <p>Nor is it to be forgotten, that thoſe very Gentlemen, who raiſed moſt Noiſe at the General of the Treaty, had leaſt to ſay to the Particulars; had feweſt Objections to make, and leaſt of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd themſelves in the Amendments.—The Reaſon was plain, the Deſign was not to Amend the Treaty, but to Deſtroy it; They were not Sollicitous to have a good Treaty, but to have no Treaty; The Drift was to Confound it with Infinite Objections, and to Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour the People out of their Wits, that they might, if poſſible, Clamour the Parliament out of the Houſe: And of this, ſuch evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Proofs will appear in the Proceſs of this Story, as no Body, I believe, will make any Doubt, but that there is Reaſon for ſuch an Objection.</p>
            <p>The Parliament was now met, and the Party who oppoſed the Treaty diligently, made up their greateſt Strength within Doors in order to it.—I will not ſay, that ſeveral took the Oath of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, on purpoſe to be able to do Service againſt it, who never took the ſaid Oath before,—but I know it was ſo underſtood of ſeveral Gentlemen,—and they were reported to be adviſed by their Friends to do ſo.</p>
            <p>The firſt Step they took without Doors, <hi>for the Matters within Door, I refer to the Abſtract I ſhall make of the Minuts in the end of</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0554400100:233"/>
               <hi>this Work:</hi> But the firſt Step they took without Doors, as to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, was to ſet on Foot a Notion, that the Members of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had <hi>no Right to</hi> alter the Conſtitution, without the particular Conſent of their <hi>Conſtituents;</hi> And that therefore the Parliament ought to have an Adjournment for ſome time, that the Members might go down into the ſeveral and reſpective Countries, which they Repreſented, and know the Mind of their Conſtituents.</p>
            <p>And tho, this ſeem'd to be many ways confuted by Strength of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument; wherein it was alledged, that this was not an Altering or Giving up the Conſtitution; And therefore, ſuppoſe it were true, that the Members were not impowered to Act, without the Conſent of their Conſtituents, in Giving up the Conſtitution, yet this did not reach here.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It was alledged, that this Parliament was Summoned by Her Majeſty, with an expreſs Signification in the Proclamation, that it was to Treat of, Conſult about, and Conclude an Union with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> And being ſent up, for that declared purpoſe, by their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituents, there remain'd no Occaſion to demand any further, or other Inſtructions from them; but they became Plenipotentiaries from that particular Circumſtance.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That, by the Conſtitution, it was not required, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituents ſhould be conſulted on any ſuch Occaſion; That the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of Eſtates Tranſpoſed the Crown, Altered the Succeſſion, and Settled the Revolution; which, in all Circumſtances, was as Eſſential to the Conſtitution as this; and that they never Conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Conſtituents in that Caſe at all; nor did the Oppoſers of the Revolution demand it; but Proteſted, and went out of the Houſe.</p>
            <p>And, in this Caſe, their Champion Mr. <hi>Hodges</hi> alſo was againſt them, who owned, that their Commiſſioners to the Parliament had full Power to Act for them in this Caſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>However,</hi> As things began to run very high, and the People, prompted by theſe Popular Arguments, Aſſum'd every thing they thought fit to call their Right; ſeveral Burghs wrote Letters to their Repreſentatives, in their own Names, and by their own Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Requiring them not to give their Votes, or Aſſents to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporating Union;—<hi>Or, in ſhort,</hi> not to the Union as now coming on, in the Terms of the Treaty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But this was not all;</hi> For, finding that this was not much regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Members; and that Precedents in like Caſes, would not ſupport the Practice; They turn'd their private Letters into Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Addreſſes, and thoſe introduc'd Mobs, Tumults, Inſultings of Magiſtrates, Flight of Gentlemen from their Houſes, and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Popular Diſorders; Till, at laſt, it came to downright In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and Rebellion: Which, had not Circumſtances, and the Seaſon particularly prevented, had riſen up to Blood, Civil War, and all the Terrible Conſequences of an Inrag'd and Divided Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as ſhall more at large be related in its Courſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0554400100:234"/>
But to return to the Party who oppoſed the Treaty; at firſt they ſtrove to carry on their Oppoſition by wiſer Methods; and, by their Force of Arguments, to poſſeſs the Peoples Minds with ſuch Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as might convince the Parliament, they were Acting againſt the general Current of the Nation.</p>
            <p>And having not at <hi>firſt</hi> appear'd againſt the thing in general, it behoved them to deſcend to particular Objections; For, to ſay, they would have no Union at all, would have been Impolitick, and have formed too great a Party againſt them: It was neceſſary therefore, to form themſelves into a Body of Objectors, that had ſome Reaſon on their Side, and could deſcend to Particulars to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force their Opinion.</p>
            <p>Nor could they, in good Manners to the Queen, object againſt an Union in general, who, in Her Letters to the Parliament, had ſo earneſtly recommended, upon all Occaſions, the Union of Her People, as what Her Majeſty eſteem'd ſo much for their mutual Good; That ſhe would count it Her ſingular Happineſs, to have it compleated in Her Reign: On this Score, I ſay, ſhould they have rejected all manner of Union, or Treaty of Union, it would have been ſo directly flying in the Face of the Queens Recommendation, that it would have not only appeared rude, but have loſt them a conſiderable Party, whoſe Aſſiſtance they found very great Occaſion for.</p>
            <p>This brought all the ſeveral Parties, who were againſt the Treaty, as well thoſe that were againſt it, on the Account of the Succeſſion, as thoſe that were againſt it in general, to fall in with thoſe, who on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly objected againſt the Circumſtances of it; <hi>I mean,</hi> the Conditions, and Stipulations publiſhed in the Articles.</p>
            <p>Thus the great Variety of Objectors, to make themſelves perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Formidable, however different in Notion or Deſign, made up one Body; and turn'd their Arguments from being pointed againſt the Union in general, to be pointed againſt the Terms of it, <hi>An Incorporating <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This brought them back to the ſeveral Schemes of Forreign Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Nations, ſuch as <hi>Switzerland,</hi> the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> and the like: And ſome propoſed one thing, ſome another, not foreſeeing, that, had even any of their Propoſals come to have been the real Treaty; yet this Party, who were againſt the Union <hi>as ſuch,</hi> would have been as much againſt that, as they were againſt this; and ſo at laſt they muſt have divided, broke their Intereſt, and loſt the whole, which was the main thing aim'd at.</p>
            <p>And thus now ſtood the Debate.—<hi>No Incorporating <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> was the Word,<hi>—Let us have an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with</hi> England <hi>with all our Hearts,—but no Incorporation; Let us keep our Parliament, keep our Sovereignity,</hi> keep <hi>our Independency,</hi> keep <hi>our Conſtitution,</hi> and for all the reſt, <hi>we are ready to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nite with you, as firmly as you can De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was thought, by moſt, to be juſt reviving the former Notions of a Federal Union,—with ſo many inconſiſtent Noun-Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0554400100:235"/>
in their Government, that had upon all Occaſions been found Impracticable; and which would ſo intirely have left both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Expoſed to the Poſſibility of a Relapſing into a divided Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that it could not be expected, <hi>England, whoſe Conſiderations for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niting, were Peace, Strength, and ſhutting a back Door of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual War, and Confuſion from the North,</hi> ſhould communicate Trade, Freedom of Cuſtoms in all her Ports, and Plantations, with the Egreſs and Regreſs of Manufactures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and leave the main things yet precarious and uncertain.</p>
            <p>It would be endleſs to trouble the Reader here with the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on both ſides,—which came reſolved at laſt to this ſhort Head.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the Treaty at <hi>London,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners had refuſed to Treat, but upon an intire and Incorporating Union,—and had given ſuch Reaſons, why all other Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals, would not only be inſufficient, but impracticable; That the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners were convinc'd of it, and ſatisfyed to enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Treaty of an intire Union, as the only way to eſtabliſh the laſting Peace and Proſperity of both Nations.</p>
            <p>To talk then of a Federal Union at this time, ſeem'd only to put the Queſtion, whether the Parliament ſhould take the Articles into Conſideration, or no.—And this run all the Oppoſers back to the Schemes of thoſe, that were againſt the Union in general, and by this they loſt Ground; For tho they made a ſtrong Oppoſition againſt the very Reading the Articles at all, and would gladly have rejected them in the Groſs; yet <hi>there</hi> ſeveral of their Friends left them, and ſo they loſt the firſt Queſtion, <hi>Whether the Articles ſhould be read,</hi> which was carryed in the Affirmative <hi>October</hi> 3<hi>d,</hi> the firſt Day of the Meeting of the Parliament, as will appear by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes.</p>
            <p>This was the firſt Strait they were brought to; And therefore, to back theſe two Principles, they ſet to Work to procure a Throng of Addreſſes from the ſeveral Towns,—and which 'tis viſible they attempted to back with Force, to awe the Parliament into a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance, as will hereafter appear.</p>
            <p>Moſt of theſe Addreſſes were worded to the ſame purpoſe, and in Subſtance contain'd a Claim of the Conſtituents Right, to limit and inſtruct their Commiſſioners,—and a Direction to avoid an Incorporating Union; Some of them were decently prefac'd with Expreſſions of Courteſy to <hi>England,</hi> and Willingneſs to Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, or Unite with them on other Terms; but Proteſted againſt an Incorporation of Government, as contrary to their Liberties, and deſtructive to their Sovereignity and Independency, the Glory of their Anceſtors, the Honour of the Ancient Kingdom, and a great many ſuch plauſible Allegations, in order to make the Ground of their Addreſſing ſeem the more Specious, and to pleaſe the People: Others leſs Courteous, ſpoke higher Words and rougher Language, talk'd of their Defending their Conſtitution againſt the Invaſion of Strangers, reflected on their Treaters, and their being wheedled and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0554400100:236"/>
drawn in to give up their Country, their Liberties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We ſhall come to them preſently.</p>
            <p>As the Parliament was now ſitting, ſo was the Commiſſion,—this is a Deputation from the General Aſſembly, being a certain Number of Miniſters, Impowered by an Act of the Aſſembly, to meet in the Intervals of their Seſſion, to take Care of the Affairs of the Church.</p>
            <p>The Tranſactions within the Parliament, I refer to the Abſtract of the Minutes, with Obſervations immediately following this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. <hi>Folio</hi> 
               <expan>
                  <am>

               </expan> But that this Account, which contains things done without Doors, may run Hand in Hand with the ſaid Abſtract, it is neceſſary to give an Account what was Tranſacting in the Commiſſion at the ſame time, at leaſt ſo far as it relates to the preſent Affair.</p>
            <p>It is obſerv'd in the Minutes of the 12<hi>th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> that a Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was made in Parliament for a Publick Faſt; which, however, was oppoſed by thoſe, that ſome thought, had more Inclination to the Work of a Publick Faſt, than thoſe that propoſed it; How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as the Commiſſion had been ſeveral days met, the Gentlemen in Parliament, who were againſt the having a Publick Faſt appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Parliament, ſeemed to refer it to the Commiſſion.</p>
            <p>It was indeed oppoſed in the Commiſſion of the Aſſembly, for the ſame Reaſons that it was in Parliament, <hi>viz.</hi> Not for any Diſlike of Faſting and Praying, but to prevent the Alarming and Amuſing the People, which was the principal Work on Foot at that Time; However, not to neglect the Work, or be found op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing ſuch a thing, as Praying to GOD, on whatſoever Account; It was moved in the Commiſſion, That they ſhould ſet apart a Time for themſelves to Faſt and Pray, as Miniſters aſſembled on ſo great an Occaſion;) and that a Circular Letter ſhould be ſent to the ſeveral Presbyteries, to do the ſame in their ſeveral Diſtricts.</p>
            <p>The Act of the Commiſſion, for this Day of Prayer, neither Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd them to a Day, or preſcrib'd the Manner;) The Act it ſelf is to be found in the <hi>Appendix, N A x,</hi> as Copied from the Original in the Regiſter.</p>
            <p>There had been ſtrong Rumours ſpread abroad, That the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion would not Act, <hi>in this Caſe,</hi> without the General Aſſembly; but that they ſhould Proteſt againſt the Union's being Concluded, till a General Aſſembly was Called; and Addreſs the Parliament to Adjourn the Debate of it, till the Aſſembly ſhould meet, which was not to be till <hi>April.</hi>—Or, that the Lords of Her Majeſties Council ſhould procure from Her Majeſty, that the Aſſembly might be Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſooner.</p>
            <p>But, as this was the Contrivance of a Party, only to gain Time; and of a piece with the Delays offered at in the Houſe, at the ſame time; ſo it met with no Incouragement in the Commiſſion: Not, but that there was too ſtrong a Party willing to have Befriended it, at that time, even in the Commiſſion it ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0554400100:237"/>
               <hi>However,</hi> a very Moderate and well Temper'd Addreſs was drawn up in the Commiſſion; it was Agreed to in the Commiſſion the 11<hi>th,</hi> but not preſented till the 17<hi>th:</hi> In which, they recommend to the Parliament, the Security of the Presbyterian Church of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and its Doctrine, Diſcipline, Worſhip and Government, to be ſecured by the Treaty, as you may ſee by the Addreſs it ſelf, which is printed in the <hi>Appendix, N B x.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, the Commiſſion was again preſſed about the Faſt; and more Miniſters being come to Town, than were at the firſt; and coming with the Senſe of the Country People freſh in their Minds, who were, by this time, every where rendered very uneaſy, the Motion of a Faſt was renewed; And tho ſome were againſt a Faſt as National, yet, as no Body was againſt Praying to GOD, on ſo Solemn Occaſion, ſo the Commiſſion began with themſelves as follows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>October</hi> 17<hi>th,</hi> It was Agreed, That the Members of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, with ſuch as pleaſed to joyn with them, ſhould Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veen in the High Church of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> for <hi>Prayer</hi> the Day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing; That the Moderator ſhould begin with a ſhort Diſcourſe from the Pulpit, concerning the Occaſion and Reaſon of that Meeting, and the Miniſters to Pray, and the Orders of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe were ſettled by the Commiſſion.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, on the 18<hi>th,</hi> there was a very great Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where was preſent many Members of Parliament, and the Work continued till two of the Clock, very Publick and Solemn; but without any of the Exceſſes, which ſome People flattered themſelves to find there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>However,</hi> after this, the Motion for a Faſt was brought on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and carryed in the Commiſſion on the 21<hi>ſt</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> as from the Regiſter follows.</p>
            <p>There having formerly been a Motion made, for Application to the Parliament for a Publick National Faſt; The Matter was this Day reſumed, and much Debate about it; The Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion being pretty full, it took longer time; Some were for Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying to the Parliament, for their Civil Sanction to it; Others, that Presbyteries ſhould be wrote to, to Appoint a Faſt, without Applying to the Parliament; becauſe it was feared, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might not be Unanimous in that Matter; and the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning of a Faſt there, might, perhaps, in the preſent Circumſtances, be Occaſion of Strife: And after long Deliberation, it was Unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly Agreed unto, that Application ſhould not be made to the Parliament; and a Committee was Named to bring in a Draught of the Paper about that Faſt; which Committee brought in the ſame, in Form of an Act, upon the 22<hi>d</hi> of <hi>October;</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome few Amendments, the ſame was Unanimouſly Approven.</p>
            <p>This Faſt was obſerved in <hi>Edinburgh</hi> very Solemnly, His Grace Her Majeſties Commiſſioner, the Lord Chancellor, the Great Officers of State, and many Members of Parliament appear'd at Church, and joyn'd in it, tho the Appointment had not the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0554400100:238"/>
of the Civil Authority to ſupport it.—A clear Proof, by the way, of the Parliaments owning the Power of Appointing Faſts, to be in the Church.</p>
            <p>Yet was not this ſuch a General National Faſt, as ſome people de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired; hoping to obtain upon the People, by the Solemnity of the Thing; and by the Warmth of the Miniſters, who, they vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expected, would, in the Pulpit, run out againſt the Treaty; Bring the People to a general Averſion againſt it; and, by Conſequence, to ſome violent Meaſures for preventing it.</p>
            <p>But the Prudence of the Miniſters prevented all this deſigned Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief;—and tho the Day was, as I have ſaid, obſerv'd with great Solemnity, and Affection; yet it was to their great Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the Miniſters generally, <hi>as well thoſe who were againſt the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> as thoſe <hi>who were for it,</hi> in their reſpective Pariſhes, applyed themſelves only ſummarily to the Subſtance, nay, to the very Words of the Aſſemblies Act, <hi>viz. That all the Determinations of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of Parliament, with reſpect to an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with</hi> England, <hi>might be Influenced and Directed by Divine Wiſdom, to the Glory of GOD, the Good of Religion, and particularly of the Church of</hi> Scotland.</p>
            <p>Thus the Thing was carryed thro', except as hereafter, without the Miſchievous Effect, which ſome expected from it; who now begun to turn their Expectations another way, <hi>viz.</hi> To <hi>THE PEOPLE,</hi> who, they had, by various Arts, ſcrew'd up to an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected Fermentation; as, in the enſuing Tumults, appear'd.</p>
            <p>I am ſorry, that, in the Proceſs of this Story, eſpecially in this, which I count the fowleſt and blackeſt part of it that could have been Acted, I ſhall be obliged to mention ſome Perſons of great Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and Ancient Families; who were pleaſed, for Reaſons of their own, to Act againſt the Union, and to appear ſo publickly in the Oppoſition of it, that <hi>the People,</hi> I do not ſay, by their own Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, <hi>I hope not,</hi> ſingled them out as the Patriots of their Country againſt this Tranſaction; and, by their Shouts and Huzzas after them, as they went and came to and from the Parliament, made them, as it were, the Heads of the Party, who oppoſed the Union.</p>
            <p>The Dukes of <hi>Hamilton</hi> and <hi>Athole</hi> were the Chief of theſe, and were almoſt every day in Parliament, ſtrenuouſly Arguing againſt the Articles, and preſſing for other Meaſures, as by the Obſervations on the Minutes will appear.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Hamilton</hi> being Indiſpoſed by ſome Lameneſs, I cannot deſcribe the Occaſion, was generally carryed to and from the Houſe in his Chair.</p>
            <p>The common People now ſcrew'd up to a Pitch, and Ripe for the Miſchief deſigned, and prompted by the particular Agents of a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Party, began to be very Inſolent: It had been whiſpered about ſeveral Days, that the Rabble would riſe, and come up to the Parliament Houſe, and cry out, <hi>No <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion;</hi> That they would take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Honours, <hi>as they call them, viz.</hi> The Crown, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and carry them to the Caſtle, and a long Variety of Fooliſh Reports of this kind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0554400100:239"/>
But the firſt Appearance of any thing Mobiſh was, that every day, when the Duke went up, but principally as he came down in his Chair from the Houſe, the Mob follow'd him, ſhouting and crying out, GOD bleſs his Grace, for ſtanding up againſt the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and appearing for his Country, and the like.</p>
            <p>And as Extremes are generally accompanyed with their Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; ſo, while his Grace the Duke of <hi>Hamilton</hi> had theſe fancied Honours paid him, the Queens Repreſentative, the High Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner, had all the Inſults, Reproaches and Indignities offered him, that they durſt, for fear of publick Juſtice, ſhew him. As will by and by appear.</p>
            <p>Far be it from me to ſay, the Duke of <hi>Hamilton</hi> deſired or encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged this Tumultuary kind of Congratulation; That ſort of Popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity muſt be too much below a Perſon of his Character; and his Grace knows the World too well, and is too Wiſe a Man, not to know, that ſuch things always tend to Confuſion, and to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Civil Peace in the World.</p>
            <p>Nor do I doubt, but his Grace did what he could, to prevent their ſingling him out, to ſhow their Mob Courteſie to; but there was no Cruſhing a Rabble, that had ſo many Wheels to ſet it in Motion; and the ſeeming Cauſes of which encreaſed every day, <hi>as the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion began to draw forward,</hi> and as the Members appeared reſolved to go forward with it ſeriouſly, in order to a Concluſion.</p>
            <p>On the 22<hi>d</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> they follow'd the Dukes Chair quite thro' the City down to the Abbey Gate; The Guards prevented their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing further; But all the way as they came back, they were heard to threaten what they would do the next day; That then they would be a thouſand times as many; That they would pull the Traitors, <hi>ſo they call'd the Treaters of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion at</hi> London, out of their Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and they would ſoon put an end to the Union.</p>
            <p>On the 23<hi>d,</hi> they made part of their Words good indeed; For, as the Parliament ſat ſomething late, the People gather'd in the Streets, and about the Doors of the Parliament Houſe, and particularly the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament Cloſs was almoſt full, that the Members could not go in or out without Difficulty; when Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> coming out of the Houſe, the Mob Huzza'd as formerly, and follow'd his Chair in a very great Number; The Duke, inſtead of going down to <hi>the Abbey</hi> as uſual, went up the High-Street to the <hi>Land-Market,</hi> as they call it, and ſo to the Lodgings of the Duke of <hi>Athole;</hi> Some ſaid, he went to avoid the Mob; Others maliciouſly ſaid, he went to point them to their Work.</p>
            <p>While he went in to the Duke of <hi>Athole</hi>'s Lodgings, the Rabble at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended at the Door; and, by Shouting and Noiſe, having increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Numbers to ſeveral thouſands, they began with Sir <hi>Patrick Johnſton,</hi> who was one of the Treaters, and the Year before had been Lord Provoſt; Firſt they aſſaulted his Lodgings with Stones and Sticks, <hi>and Curſes not a few;</hi> but his Windows being too high, they came up the Stairs to his Door, and fell to Work at it with Sledges, or great Hammers; And, had they broke it open in their firſt Fury,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0554400100:240"/>
he had, without doubt, been Torn in Pieces without Mercy; and thus only, becauſe he was a Treater in the Commiſſion to <hi>England;</hi> For, before that, no Man was ſo well Belov'd, as he, over the whole City.</p>
            <p>His Lady, in the utmoſt Deſpair with this Fright, comes to the Window, with two Candles in her Hand, that ſhe might be known; and cryed out, <hi>for GODs Sake,</hi> to call the Guards: An Honeſt Apothecary in the Town, who knew her Voice, and ſaw the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs ſhe was in, and to whom the Family, under GOD, is obliged, for their Deliverance, ran immediately down to the Town Guard; but they would not ſtir, without the Lord Provoſts Order;—but that being ſoon obtain'd, one Captain <hi>Richardſon,</hi> who Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, taking about thirty Men with him, March'd bravely up to them; and making his way with great Reſolution thro' the Croud, they Flying, but Throwing Stones, and Hallowing at him, and his Men, he Seized the Foot of the Stair Caſe; and then boldly went up, clear'd the Stair, and took ſix of the Rabble in the very Act; and ſo delivered the Gentleman and his Family.—</p>
            <p>But this did not put a Stop to the general Tumult, tho it deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this particular Family; For the Rabble, by this time, were prodigiouſly increaſed, and went Roving up and down the Town, Breaking the Windows of the Members of Parliament, and Inſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in their Coaches, in the Streets; They put out all the Lights, that they might not be diſcovered; and the Author of this had one great Stone thrown at him, for but looking out of a Window; for they ſuffered no Body to look out, eſpecially with any Lights, leſt they ſhould know Faces, and Inform againſt them afterwards.</p>
            <p>By this time, it was about eight or nine a Clock at Night, and now they were abſolute Maſters of the City; and it was Reported, they were going to ſhut up all the Ports;—The Lord Commiſſioner being Inform'd of that, ſent a Party of the Foot Guards, and took Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Nether-Bow,</hi> which is a Gate in the Middle of the High-Street, as <hi>Temple-Bar</hi> between the City of <hi>London</hi> and the Court.</p>
            <p>The City was now in a Terrible Fright, and every Body was under Concern for their Friends; The Rabble went Raving about the Streets till Midnight, frequently Beating Drums, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing more People; when my Lord Commiſſioner being Inform'd, there were a Thouſand of the Seamen and Rabble come up from <hi>Leith;</hi> and Apprehending, if it were ſuffered to go on, it might come to a Dangerous Head, and be out of his Power to ſuppreſs,—he ſent for the Lord Provoſt, and Demanded, that the Guards ſhould March into the City.</p>
            <p>The Lord Provoſt, after ſome Difficulty, yielded; tho it was alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it was what was never known in <hi>Edinburgh</hi> before—About one a Clock in the Morning, a Battallion of the Guards entred the Town, Marched up to the Parliament Cloſs, and took Poſt in all
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0554400100:241"/>
the Avenues of the City, which prevented the Reſolutions taken to Inſult the Houſes of the reſt of the Treaters.</p>
            <p>The Rabble were intirely reduc'd by this, and gradually diſpers'd, and ſo the Tumult ended.</p>
            <p>It is not eaſy to deſcribe here, the Conſternation all Good Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were in, at the Riſing of this Tumult; and had not ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions been at laſt taken, as is above-mentioned, <hi>which the other Party did not expect,</hi> it had been the fataleſt Rabble the Nation had ever ſeen.</p>
            <p>In this Caſe my Lord Commiſſioner greatly diſappointed the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who, having Inſulted his Graces Lenity before, as a Faintneſs of Reſolution, had ſpread about Scandalous Reports, That the Government durſt not look the Rabble in the Face; That the High Commiſſioner was afraid of being Rabbled in his Palace; and that, if they once roſe in a Mob, all would fly before them; That the Parliament would run away, and diſſolve themſelves, or fly to the Caſtle; and another worſe thing than all, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Souldiers were on their ſide, and would not fight againſt their Country, as they called it.</p>
            <p>But the Reſolution of the Lord Commiſſioner diſappointed them all, who now ſhew'd them, he had as much cheerful Bravery in the Action, as he had Calmneſs and Temper in the Parliament; This broke all their Meaſures; and when they ſaw the Guards, led by Brave and Faithful Officers, ſtand firm to their Duty, and ſhew themſelves reſolutely forward to defend the Government, they loſt all their Courage; it defeated all their Expectations, and they began to lay aſide that ſort of violent Proceedings, and apply themſelves to the Artifice of Words, and the Managry of Parties in the Houſe.</p>
            <p>It is to be obſerved alſo, That this Rabble was a Mine ſprung before its Time, which blew backwards, and deſtroyed the Engi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers, rather than the Enemies; <hi>The Plot</hi> being otherwiſe laid, <hi>viz.</hi> That it ſhould not have broken out, till ſome Days following; when, as was ſaid, all would have been in readineſs, to have fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the Work at one Blow, <hi>viz.</hi> To have blown up the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at once.</p>
            <p>They had been Tampering with the Souldiery, in order to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch them from their Duty; and ſome People talk'd of retiring from the Parliament, and of ſome Great Men Heading the People; which, had their Patience been more, and their Conduct a little more ſecret, they had, without Doubt, effectually brought it to paſs; But they blew their own Project up by their Precipitation, and ſo ſaved their Country by their very Attempt to deſtroy it.</p>
            <p>The Author of this had his Share of the Danger in this Tumult, and tho unknown to him, was watch'd and ſet by the Mob, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to know where to find him, had his Chamber Windows In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted, and the Windows below him broken by Miſtake.—But, by the Prudence of his Friends, the Shortneſs of its Continuance, and GODs Providence, he eſcaped.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0554400100:242"/>
Several of the Rabble were ſeized upon, and apprehended; and there was a Diſcourſe of making Examples of ſome of them; but the Mercy of the High Commiſſioner, <hi>however provoked and abuſed,</hi> prevail'd to Compaſſionate, rather than Puniſh their Follies; They were only kept ſome time in Priſon, and afterwards let go, without any other Puniſhment.</p>
            <p>And thus ended the moſt dangerous Juncture of the whole Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and a Tumult, which ended to the Advantage of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Diſheartning the Party, who, before that, carryed it with ſuch an unheard of Inſolence; That, had they not been, as they thought, ſure of their Cauſe, they would never have An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd it to their own Diſcretion, to have Acted in ſo Open and Inſulting a Manner.</p>
            <p>The Foot Guards, and two other Regiments of Foot, did now conſtant Duty in the City, <hi>viz.</hi> The Regiments of <hi>Strathnaver</hi> and <hi>Grant;</hi> The Horſe Guards attended the Commiſſioner, the other Battallion of Guards at the Palace, and the Gariſon at the Caſtle.</p>
            <p>And all was little enough; For the Regiments were thin, and few; and all the Forces then in the Kingdom, <hi>ſome Independent Companies in the Highlands excepted,</hi> did not exceed three thouſand Men; and great Endeavours were uſed, as I have ſaid, to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch the Souldiers, tho in vain; they appearing Faithful and Forward, to do their Duty on all Occaſions.</p>
            <p>The next day the Parliament did not ſit; but a great Council was aſſembled, where the Meaſures the Lord Commiſſioner had taken, as to bringing the Guards into the City, was Ratified and Approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and a Proclamation publiſhed for ſuppreſſing the Rabble; which being ſomething particular, is inſerted in the <hi>Appendix, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. C x.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have printed this Proclamation, tho this Work could very ill ſpare Room for it; both becauſe it recites the Acts of Parliament in <hi>Scotland</hi> in Force againſt Rabbles; as alſo, for that the Method is particular to that place, and very good to prevent Tumults, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Of obliging the Deacons of Crafts, <hi>that is, as in</hi> London, <hi>the Maſters of Companies,</hi> to Summon the Inhabitants, and make them give Security for the Behaviour of their Servants, Apprentices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. Giving an Indemnity to the Souldiers, either of the Regiments, or Town-Guards, in caſe they ſhould wound or kill any Perſon, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Command given for all to retire from the Streets.—</p>
            <p>Indeed there was Occaſion enough for ſuch a Proclamation; and, had not the Party been broken, <hi>as before,</hi> all would have been little enough, to have ſuppreſs'd the Fury of this Enraged Multitude.</p>
            <p>No Body would undertake to juſtify the Rabble, <hi>eſpecially after they had been defeated in the Deſign.</hi>—Every Body cryed out, it was a Dangerous Thing; and the whole City might have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to Plunder, Riot, and all manner of Diſorder.</p>
            <p>But, as the Party could not juſtify the Rabble, ſo they began a new Clamour; and now they exclaim'd, That the Privileges of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0554400100:243"/>
the City of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> were invaded, and Souldiers brought in, to awe and oppreſs the Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>That this had not been done in ſixty Years before, nor ever, but in the Time of War and Tyrannick Government; and that it was a Fore-runner of the Slavery of the Nation.</p>
            <p>Then they cryed out, this was an Invaſion of the Freedoms of Parliament, and an Awe upon the Members, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See the Minuts of the 25<hi>th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> where that Matter was urged very warmly.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, it had been to be wiſhed, the Affair could have been carryed on, without any Jealouſies and Inſults; But, on the other ſide, it was alledged, That the Force put on the Government by the Rabble, was an Invaſion of the Publick Peace; and that the Mob were the Aggreſſors, and the Parliament was much more likely to be Awed by the Ungovern'd Rabbles of the Streets, if they had gotten a Head, than by the Forces brought in for their Security; who being at their Command, did nothing but ſecure them from the Inſults of the Mob, and keep that Peace which the Civil Authority had not Power to preſerve.</p>
            <p>That the Military Power is always ſuppoſed to be aſſiſting to the Civil, when oppreſt by Rabbles and Tumults; and while in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervience to the Civil Peace, and Subordinate to the Civil Powers, the proper Safe-Guard of a State;—and as the Force of theſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments carryed all things before them in the Houſe, all the legal Pretences were overthrown, by the Reaſon and Nature of the Thing, and the Parliament approved of all that had been done.</p>
            <p>Nor did they Approve it only; but Ordered the Guards to be Continued, or recommended it to the Lord High Commiſſioner, and the Privy Council, to continue their Care for the Safety and Security of the Parliament. <hi>Vide the Minuts of October</hi> 25<hi>th.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, by this Method, the Appearance of the Rabbles, and the Fury of the Streets, were, in ſome Meaſure, Abated; yet the People appeared Exaſperated to the laſt Degree; The Huzzaing and Crouding about Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> continued, notwithſtanding all his Endeavours to prevent it; and unuſual Threatnings and dark Speeches were heard among the People.</p>
            <p>The Lords, and others, who oppoſed the placing Guards in the Streets, made Proteſts againſt it, as Infringing the Liberties of the Parliament; tho it was very plain, that there was nothing Impoſed in Parliament, nothing offered to be Carryed, but by Reaſoning and fair Voting.</p>
            <p>From this Time, they began to talk of Country Tumults; and that, ſince the Commiſſioner had ſuppreſs'd the Mob in the Town, the whole Country ſhould riſe, and come up to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and remove the Guards by Force from Impriſoning the Parliament.</p>
            <p>The Pretence was Specious; They pretended, the Guards were a Force upon the Members of Parliament; That this was Craming the Union down their Throats; That the Country was Unanimouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt it, and would not bear, that a few People in the Houſe, becauſe they had the Majority within Doors, and a Band of Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0554400100:244"/>
to back them, ſhould Impoſe a Conjunction with <hi>England</hi> upon them, whether they would or no:—(Any Body may judge what a Time this was, when every day the Town was alarm'd; To Day the North was up in Arms, to Morrow the Weſt; To Day ſuch a Shire, to Morrow another, the next Day a Third; <hi>Glaſgow, Dumfries, Hamilton, Perth,</hi> all the places which the Imagination of the People dictated, and the Fears of others apprehended.</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible to expreſs the Conſternation of the People: Thoſe that wiſhed well to the Publick Peace, and who ſaw, that a Commotion at this Time, muſt immediatly involve the Nation in War, and Blood, not with <hi>England</hi> only, but with one another; theſe Trembled for Fear of the Deſolation of their Country, the Blood and Ruine that always attends a Civil War, and the Danger of the Lives of themſelves and their Relations.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who look'd ſeriouſly into the Drift of ſome of that Party, who moſt eagerly puſh'd on theſe Diviſions, who ſaw how the Intereſt of a Popiſh, a <hi>Jacobite,</hi> and a Perſecuting Bloody Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration <hi>lately extinguiſh'd, and now full of Hopes,</hi> was Twiſted, and all joyn'd in Anti-Union Principles, could not but be heartily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd for the Eſtabliſh'd Religion, and Proteſtant Church; which they muſt have been wilfully blind, who could not ſee was plainly ſtruck at, by the Oppoſers of this Treaty.</p>
            <p>To ſee others, whoſe Deſigns could not be ſuſpected of any thing, to the Detriment of either Religion, or their Native Country, yet joyning blindly with a Wicked and Degenerate Race, and ſeeming to approve the Steps which were taken, to the Ruine and Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of both; To ſee theſe ſhut their Eyes againſt the plain Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of a ſtated Reſolution againſt both Liberty and Religion, and encourage, <hi>nay, in too much</hi> joyn with them, who were known Enemies both to the National Church, and Proteſtant Succeſſion; Theſe, I ſay, were very Melancholly Things, when the Proſpect of them was ſo near to thoſe, who were ſincerely concerned for the Peace of the Country, and the Safety of the Reformed Religion;—And People went up and down wandering and amazed, expecting every day ſtrange Events; afraid of Peace, and afraid of War; Many knew not which way to fix their Reſolutions; They could not be clear for the Union; yet they ſaw Death at the Door, in its breaking off; Death to their Liberty, to their Religion, and to their Country.</p>
            <p>Here were good People of all Opinions, as well as others; Some were againſt the Union, on a Principle of Juſtice and Honeſty, as earneſtly as others were againſt it, on a Principle of Treachery to their Country; Some were firmly poſſeſs'd, that they were under National Engagements, which, in the Nature of them, claſh'd with the Union; and that therefore, however it might be neceſſary for the Safety, and Peace of either Church, or Nation, they could not get over thoſe Obligations, or conſent to this Evil, that the other Good might come;—And however theſe might, in the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the Thing, Countenance the wicked Foundation, on which
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0554400100:245"/>
the other acted; yet I cannot but do them that Juſtice, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, they were far from the leaſt Intention, to encourage the ſtrengthening a Party, whoſe Principle was <hi>French</hi> Government, and a Popiſh Sovereign. I will not anſwer for Indiſcretion, or Errors in Temper in ſome; neither will I be ſo unjuſt, as to call every wrong Step an Error of Principle, and every miſtaken Man a Plotter againſt his Country.</p>
            <p>This was the unhappy divided Condition of this People, at the beginning of the Treaty. The Diviſion was ſo general, that it ſpread thro' every part; The Gentry were divided, the Common People divided, nay, the very Miniſters were divided; Parliament, Aſſembly, Court, City, Counties, Towns, nay, almoſt every Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily were divided; and as the Event began to be feared on every ſide, People ſtood ſtrangely doubtful of one another.</p>
            <p>The Commiſſion of the Aſſembly hitherto carryed, <hi>as before noted,</hi> with a great deal of Prudence and Moderation; and tho there were ſome unhappy Struggles there, which perhaps were pointed, by the ſame Party, at making a Breach; yet as they came to no Head, and were ſoon cruſh'd by the Wiſdom and Conduct of the reſt, I ſhall not preſerve the Memory of them to Poſterity; The general Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of that Reverend Body being always Tempered with Modeſty, Calmneſs, and Diſcretion, at the ſame time that they were anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly concerned for the Security of the Foundation on which they ſtood, and had the whole Weight of the Church of <hi>Scotlands</hi> Safety upon their Hands.</p>
            <p>They had Addreſs'd the Parliament, That Care might be taken of the Church in the Treaty; and had been aſſured, they ſhould have their Expectation fully Anſwer'd.</p>
            <p>And I cannot but remark here, That the Foundation of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty herein appeared to have been wiſely laid; The Underſtandings and well poiſed Judgments of its firſt Contrivers was very Conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, in leaving the reſpective Parliaments a full Liberty, ſo to Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the ſeveral Churches, as that all the Security they could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, one againſt the other, ſhould be granted them; That every Root of Jealouſy might be pull'd up, and there might be no Room for the Sowers of Diſcord to begin here, where they always uſed to begin; and from whence all the Miſchiefs of former Diſſention uſed to flow.</p>
            <p>The Parliament had alſo been Encouraged by the Queen, in Her Majeſties Letter, <hi>Vide Folio</hi> 3<hi>d. of this Part,</hi> at the Opening this Seſſion, to Form ſuch Security for the Church Government, as might fully Eſtabliſh the National Church of <hi>Scotland;</hi>—For the Queen having, by long Experience, and the former Contention on both ſides, ſeen, that an Union of Principles was no more to be expected,—but plainly ſeeing alſo, that, with the Aſſiſtance of Mutual Charity, that Difference in Principle might be Conſiſting with an Union of Intereſts, and Affection, among Her People, ſaw, at the ſame time, that the only way to Eſtabliſh this Peace, was, to Form ſuch Securities to both Churches, as might, for ever, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remove
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0554400100:246"/>
all juſt Ground of Jealouſies, from among them, take away the Suſpicions, and ſhut all the Doors againſt the Fears, which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had entertain'd of each other; and which wicked Men daily took hold of, as Handles of Contention, to keep open an Eternal Breach, and keep us always divided, <hi>Ephraim</hi> againſt <hi>Judah,</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> againſt <hi>Ephraim;</hi> ever vexing and envying one another.</p>
            <p>In this Poſture, I ſay, ſtood the Affairs of the Church; when, in the Interval of Time, between the firſt Addreſs to the Parliament, and the ſecond Reading of the Articles, <hi>Vide Minuts, Folio</hi> An Overture, or Draught of an Act for the Church, was conceived, and on the <expan>
                  <am>

                  <ex>left blank</ex>
               </expan> was preſented to the Houſe.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not enter into a long Debate which aroſe here, both with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Doors and within. 1. As to the Sufficiency and Inſufficiency of the Overture, which, in ſome part, may be Anſwer'd, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it received ſome Amendments or Additions afterwards, at the paſſing into an Act. Or, 2. As to any Act of Parliament being a ſufficient Security for the Church; That Objection being raiſed at firſt, not by ſuch as deſigned a better Security, but by ſuch as real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſigned no Security at all, for the Eccleſiaſtical Eſtabliſhment in this Nation: It is hard, That we muſt be forced to diſtinguiſh the Diſputes in this Caſe, by diſtinguiſhing the Perſons; for there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeveral Parties here, and of ſeveral Principles, who all ſeem'd to make but one Party againſt the Union, it was abſolutely neceſſary to Examine who was for this, or that Argument; and, by the Man, the Reaſon of his Argument, was to be diſtinguiſhed.</p>
            <p>This Untiddled the Myſtery, which appear'd in the Debates of this Time; when thoſe that had really leaſt Kindneſs for the Church, were the loudeſt, and appear'd the moſt Zealous for her Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity: Nay, thoſe that never owned, or acknowledged either her Diſcipline, or Government, never ſubmitted to her Judicatories, or joyn'd with her Worſhip, were now every day crying out of want of Security, Expoſing the Church to the Votes of the Biſhops in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, and giving the Epiſcopal Church of <hi>England</hi> the Aſcendant over the Presbyterian Church of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Language could be no otherwiſe underſtood, but by diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing the People that ſpoke it; The very Party were Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicks to the Dialect; and he muſt be blinder than moſt People are, in this Intelligent Age, that could imagine, theſe People ſpoke this from a true Deſign to obtain for the Church a farther or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Security, ſo much as to embarras the Church and the State, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broil the Parliament with the Commiſſion; and either prevent its being finiſhed at all, or obtain what they generally drove at, in all their Managements now in the Affair; and, which was the only thing they could hope in, <hi>I mean, A DELAY.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to leave this Matter a while, the Parliament was all this time Reading over the Articles, and Diſcourſing or Reaſoning upon them, but had not yet come to any Vote; The Tumult at <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> was blown over, without the expected Event; we ſhall now ſee, that it was not in <hi>Edinburgh</hi> alone, that a Tumult was deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

but Steps were taken, <hi>and indeed Politickly enough,</hi> to have the general Senſe of the Kingdom to run in the ſame Channel.</p>
            <p>To this End, Addreſſes were ſet on Foot, in ſeveral parts of the Kingdom againſt the Union: I ſhall not pretend to croud this Book with the particular Addreſſes, tho ſome of them are remarkable enough; However, I ſhall give <hi>Specimens</hi> of ſome of them to judge from, and to make the Matter, as I go along, the plainer.</p>
            <p>And, among them, I cannot omit one from the Convention of the Royal Burghs; becauſe ſome Gentlemen, eſpecially in <hi>England,</hi> having valued their Opinion from thence, as if it were the Senſe of the whole Nation: It is a little neceſſary, towards clearing up this Point, That, tho the People were ſcrew'd up to a moſt Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected, and indeed Unaccountable Averſion; yet that, in the whole, the main Body of the Nation did not run the length which ſome of their Leaders deſir'd of them, and which they would have had paſs'd as their Act and Deed.</p>
            <p>The Royal Burghs have a Cuſtom in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that they act in a Body, and have a Convention, or Repreſentative of their own, which meets upon Occaſion at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and are conveened by the Lord Provoſt of <hi>Edinburgh:</hi> To this Convention, every Burgh ſends one Member, and the Burgh of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> two; Their whole Repreſentative is ſixty ſix in Number.—Now the Calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation which was obſervable here, was in the Number and Quality of the Burghs, which Voted in the Convention; The Addreſs was carryed by four Voices indeed, but the State of the Caſe is thus; Of ſixty ſix Burghs, twenty Voted againſt Addreſſing, and twenty four for it, the reſt were abſent. But take the Quality of the Burghs, to make the Calculation by, and there the thing will diſcover it ſelf as follows;</p>
            <p>Take the Burghs that refuſed to Addreſs, and theſe that did not think it worth while to appear; and the Majority againſt the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſers, is, by the Proportion of <hi>their Ceſs,</hi> as eighty ſix to four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen. Nay, ſuppoſe all thoſe that did not appear to be Affirmatives, tho that be altogether improbable, and that they would have been for the Addreſs, yet the Proportion had been, as thirty one to ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty nine.—</p>
            <p>But if <hi>the Rate of the Ceſs</hi> be not a juſt Eſtimate of the Value of the Burghs, <hi>tho I can prove it was the Original of their Right of being Burghs;</hi> then I refer to any Man to calculate the Inhabitants and Number of Free-men in each Burgh, and he will find the twenty Burghs that refuſed to Addreſs, have more Inhabitants in them, than both the twenty four that Addreſs'd, and the twenty two that were abſent, the City of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> excepted.</p>
            <p>So that, upon the Foot of this Calcul, tho the Addreſs may legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be called the Addreſs of the Burrows; yet it did not follow, that the Trading Part of the Nation had Addreſſed, or were againſt the Union; for that, in an Arithmetical Calculation, or a Calculation upon Value and Payment of Taxes, the far greater Number oppoſed the very Addreſſing at all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0554400100:248"/>
This is obſerved here, in order to clear up a Point hereafter; which will require a like kind of Calculating, on the Foot of the whole Nation.</p>
            <p>The Burghs however, by this ſeeming Majority, did Addreſs; and becauſe the ſaid Addreſs is very particular, and contains in it all the Popular Arguments, which the Enemies of the Treaty had blinded the People with, <hi>as before;</hi> particularly of the Surrender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sovereignity, and Independency of the Nation, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting their Religion, Church Government, Claim of Right, Laws, Liberties, and Trade, to be Altered or Subverted by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament; For this Reaſon, I have given you the Addreſs it ſelf at large in the <hi>Appendix, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>.

            </p>
            <p>I cannot, <hi>I confeſs,</hi> but wonder, how it was poſſible to impoſe things ſo abſurd upon a whole Nation! And how ſo Great a People, ſo clear Sighted, and Wary in all other Caſes, came, at this time, to run ſo apparently upon a plain Miſtake! Since, as nothing is more plain, than that the Articles of the Treaty, and conſequently the Great Heads mentioned in the above Addreſs, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be touch'd by the Parliament of <hi>Britain;</hi> and that the Moment they Attempt it, they Diſſolve their own Conſtitution; ſo it is an Union upon no other Terms, and is expreſly Stipulate, what ſhall, and what ſhall not be Alterable by the ſubſequent Parliaments;—And as the Parliaments of <hi>Britain</hi> are founded, not upon the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Right of the People, as the ſeparate Parliaments of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> were before, but upon the Treaty, which is prior to the ſaid Parliament, and conſequently ſuperior;—So, for that Reaſon, it cannot have Power to Alter its own Foundation, or Act againſt the Power which formed it; ſince all Conſtituted Power is Subordinate, and Inferior to the Power Conſtituting.</p>
            <p>This is ſo clear, and has been ſo often Inculcated in this very Caſe, and is ſo Unanſwerably Stated in the very Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament themſelves, <hi>Ratifying the Treaty,</hi> that I need ſay no more to it here.</p>
            <p>But it was a ſtrange Time now, and there was no making the leaſt Impreſſion upon the Minds of the People, <hi>already prepoſſeſs'd;</hi>—Nothing was to be heard now, but of Slavery to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> running away with the Crown, taking away their Nation, and the like:—And it was impoſſible to Stem this Tide of Diſtraction for a Time;—It is true, that the Generality of the People came off from this Deluſion at laſt; and the Unalterableneſs of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if finiſh'd, began to obtain a little upon the Senſes of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;—The Truth is, the Demonſtration of the Thing was ſo viſible, that it could not but prevail; and the Beſt, and moſt Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious, beginning to ſee into it, the reſt of the People began, to ſink under the Power of the Conviction, and ſo by Degrees the Scruple began to wear off.</p>
            <p>Nay, the ſame People, who firſt argued againſt this Truth, <hi>viz. Of the Parliament of</hi> Britains <hi>not being able to Invade the Treaty,</hi> took it up themſelves afterward, when it ſerved their Turn, and ſtrongly
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0554400100:249"/>
urged it againſt Conſenting to the Church Eſtabliſhment on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Side; ſince it was a Confirming the Epiſcopal Power, and ſetting it up above the Power of a Parliament to pull down; <hi>So freely will Men accept of an Argument, when it ſerves their Occaſion, which they will reject, while it ſeems to oppoſe their Intereſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Ruines of this Suggeſtion, another ſtarted up; which, as it was capable of being Embaraſs'd with greater Doubts, and with ſome, had Inſuperable Difficulties; ſo, had not the Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Miniſters Interpoſed, it might have been of far worſe Conſequence in this Caſe; and this was a Scruple againſt the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Groſs, as being directly againſt, and inconſiſtent with the Covenant; and that therefore it could not be entred into, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out incurring the Guilt of National Perjury.</p>
            <p>This brought the Church into the General Appearance againſt the Treaty;—Nor will I ſay, but that great Means were uſed, if poſſible, to bring the Commiſſion then ſitting, to declare againſt the Union. upon this Account.</p>
            <p>This was a great Tryal of Skill; and I ſay, this roſe out of the Ruines of the other Scruple, becauſe it was forcibly enough alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That, if the Conſtitution of this Treaty was ſuch, that no Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration could be ſuffered; and that not the Parliament of <hi>Britain</hi> could infringe one Article of it; Then this for ever ſhut the Door againſt the Poſſibility of their Aſſiſting, to Reform the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which they alledged, by their Covenant, they were bound to uſe all lawful Endeavours to perform.</p>
            <p>This, and ſubmitting to the Juriſdiction of the Biſhops in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and who were to ſit ſtill in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by owning the Agency of Spiritual Men in Civil Imployments, they alſo alledged was againſt the Covenant: And conſequently, if the Nation went into this Union, they incurred directly the Guilt of National Perjury; and I allow, that a great many Good and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable People were very Melancholly upon this Head, and ſome are not eaſy in it to this Hour.</p>
            <p>I cannot paſs this thing here, without ſpeaking to it; becauſe I foreſee dayly Diſputes do ſtill ariſe upon this Head, and are like to do ſo every day, and I ſhall not interrupt the Thread of the Story by it at all; rather it will ſeem neceſſary to be conſidered, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to carry on the Courſe of the Story, ſome of which, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>at this very Juncture,</hi> very much depends upon it.</p>
            <p>I am not at all entring here, upon the Obligation of the ſeveral Convenants, engaged in by the People of <hi>Scotland;</hi> 'Tis neceſſary here, for Argument ſake, to allow them to be Obligatory, in as large a Senſe as can be deſired.</p>
            <p>As to the being Obliged to Reform the Church of CHRIST in the whole Iſland;—It is granted here, by the moſt ſevere Aſſertors of the Covenants Obligation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That, <hi>as is expreſs'd,</hi> they are to uſe all lawful Means only; and that they are not to uſe any ſuch thing as Force.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0554400100:250"/>
And the Reverend Doctor <hi>Rule,</hi> a Divine of great Candor and Learning, and Principal of the College of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> has ſtated this Obligation very diſtiuctly, as follows,<q>What we are bound to by the Covenant, is not to Reform them, but to concur with them, when lawfully called, to advance Reformation; And it is far from our Thought, to go beyond that Boundary, in being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in their Affairs, we wiſh their Reformation, but leave the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of it to themſelves. <bibl>Doctor <hi>Rule's ſecond Vindication of the Church of</hi> Scotland, <hi>P.</hi> 16.</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now I think nothing is more clear, than that there is all the Room in the World for the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> to concur in a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Reformation, notwithſtanding the Union; Nay, they will be better Qualifyed for it, now than ever; in ſo far as they will, I hope, always have the Aſſiſtance of all Good Men in the South, both Diſſenters, and Church Men, to Encourage them.</p>
            <p>As to the Civil Power of Church Men, or in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the Biſhops Voting in the Parliament, and its being declared againſt in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; I will not Diſpute the Suggeſtion, whether it be againſt the Covenant or no, the Diſcord lyes here.</p>
            <p>One Party ſays, it is expreſly againſt the Covenant; and that the yielding to it, and yielding to have the Church of <hi>England</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed by the Treaty, is ſetting up that very Power they were ſworn to Reform, to the utmoſt of their Power, in all lawful Means; and theſe are the particulars, in which, they ſay, the Union is a Breach upon the Covenant, and has brought the Nation into the dreadful Sin of publick Perjury.</p>
            <p>The other ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. They are not guilty of National Perjury; For that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, the Union does no way oblige them further, than as before, in the Senſe of Doctor <hi>Rule,</hi> to concur with all lawful Methods for Reformation, and to cloſe with all Opportunities, which ſhall be put into their Hands for the Purpoſe; and this they are yet as free to do as before.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to their Conſenting to the Act for the Security, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> it is not againſt the Covenant, ſince it is not an Erecting a Church; Nay, it is not, in the leaſt, a Recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing or Acknowledging them that are Erected;—but 'tis a letting <hi>that be,</hi> which <hi>was before,</hi> and which they had no lawful Call, <hi>the Thing expreſly mentioned in the Covenant,</hi> to concern themſelves in Altering; They were not legally called to it, for they were legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, at this time, excluded on either ſide, from meddling in the reſpective Settlements of the Church, by the Queens Power.</p>
            <p>And, at laſt, they alledge, that, in ſo far as the Covenant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages them againſt the Civil Power of Church Men, they did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onerate themſelves fairly, in their publick Proteſt againſt the Votes of the Biſhops, <hi>viz.</hi> The Repreſentation and Petition, Rejecting, as far as in them lyes, all Submiſſion to their ſaid Power; and that they conceive, being not called to any other oppoſition, they
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0554400100:251"/>
have fully diſcharged their Duty as a Nation, and have, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of their Power, oppoſed it.</p>
            <p>I think, this is a clear, tho' a ſhort State of the Queſtion; And ſome of the moſt Conſcientious and Pious, of both Miniſters and People, on one ſide, thought the Caſe of the Covenant clear in this Point.</p>
            <p>I know, there are others disſatisfied ſtill, of whom I have only this to ſay, If they are certain it is a National Crime, I wiſh they would apply themſelves to National Humiliation, and be found of them that ſtand in the Gap, to prevent GOD's Judgments, rather than forgetting that part, fill the Days with their Complaint of the Sin,—and only apply it, to make the People uneaſy at the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>The Union is finiſht: Even breaking it again, if that were in their Power, would not undo the Crime, if it be one; and would, at the ſame time, involve their Country in a Thouſand Calamities, Blood and Diſtreſſes.</p>
            <p>I cannot be ſo Uncharitable, as to think, any Man that raiſes the Scruple we are now upon, would be willing to be thought to be moving the Nation, to break this New, and moſt Solemn Conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and fall all to pieces again: I would then ask, To what end are publick Exclamations, and Excurſions of the Tongue about it? They can tend to nothing, but to keep the People in a continual Alarm, keep their Minds in a conſtant Perturbation and Uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and 'tis a ſad Work for any Man to be employed in, meerly to diſturb and diſtract his Country.</p>
            <p>While theſe things were debating at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> the Affair grew ſtill darker and darker all over the Kingdom; and they were far from carrying it with equal Temper and Moderation in other Places.</p>
            <p>In the Weſt, the People, called <hi>Cameronians,</hi> began to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended as Dangerous, and that Cloud was diligently repreſented as very Black; That, according to the Raſh Wiſhes of ſome People, <hi>whoſe Endeavours too had not been wanting,</hi> they would fall into ſome Deſperate Action or other on this Account;—The Prejudices a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Union had reach'd them very early: Nor was it to be ſuppoſed, that thoſe People, who were ſo diligent to Alarm the Country every where againſt the Union, and poſſeſs'd them with Fears and Jealouſies of their Liberties, Trade, Crown, and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, would fail to fall to Work in theſe Parts, where they muſt needs know, the general Character of the People, was to be Tenacious of their Opinions; and far from being always preſcribed by the moſt Prudent and Moderate Councils;—As to other Places, the Arguments were ſuited to the People, as to ſome, the Loſs of Trade, to others Taxes, to theſe the Liberty, to thoſe the Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Nation, ſo to theſe the great Pretence uſed, was Religion, the Danger of, not the Church, <hi>for that many of them did not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to or acknowledge;</hi>—But Religion in general, and theſe two Heads in particular, the Return of Prelacy, and the Breach of the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0554400100:252"/>
Covenant; However, they had all the very ſame things in their Allegations.</p>
            <p>In carrying on the Deſign of Enſlaving theſe poor People, great Artifice was uſed;—And, as if they had been prepared for the Deſign before hand,—they waited till the Articles were printed, which were formed by the Treaters in <hi>England,</hi> and the ſeveral Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuts of the Treaty.</p>
            <p>When theſe were ſeen, a Number of theſe People got together; And tho they were not the Number by far, as was diligently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, in order to make them Formidable; yet the Beginning might have been Dangerous enough, if it had been puſh'd on far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; what Number they might really be in other places, I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver learn ſo particularly, as to venture aſſerting it: But about Two Hundred Men, in a Tumultuous Manner, came to the Town of <hi>Dumfreis,</hi> a Sea-port on the Weſt-ſide of <hi>Scotland,</hi> about Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Eight Miles from <hi>Carliſle;</hi>—They came into the Town in the Middle of the Day, on the Twentieth of <hi>November,</hi> made a Fire in the Market Place, burnt the Articles of the Union, and burnt a Paper with the Names of the Commiſſioners of the Treaty, and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed another Paper of their own upon the Croſs; and having done thus, they march'd off, and diſpers'd themſelves peaceably.</p>
            <p>This Paper indeed was no leſs Seditious in its Nature, than the Attempt was Inſolent and Daring.</p>
            <p>When the Report came to <hi>Edinburgh</hi> of this Tumult, the Concern of thoſe, who wiſh'd well to their Country, was very great, and Wiſe Men began to give the Deſign of the Treaty for loſt; They knew the unhappy Temper of thoſe Honeſt People; for ſuch, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I muſt call them, becauſe I believe their Intention is Religious and Honeſt, tho they may be miſtaken, and, no doubt, are miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, in their Principles, about Government and Obedience; But, as they knew, I ſay, the Temper of theſe People, how Tenacious of their own Sentiments, and how Precipitant in their Proſecution, it bred no ſmall Concern in the Minds of all People, who were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to Peace; Concluding, That the Party, who oppoſed the Union from worſe Principles, had gain'd their Point, <hi>viz.</hi> To im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the Hands of Proteſtants, one againſt another, in this Diſpute, and make the Honeſt Meaning, but Warm People, the Tools to Ruine both themſelves, and their Country.</p>
            <p>There were not wanting, at the ſame time, People, who dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently ſpread Extravagant Rumours of the Numbers of theſe People; Some ſaid, that there were Six Thouſand Men in Arms at the Place; others, that Two Thouſand Horſe only came into the Town; and that Five Thouſand Foot-ſtood ready, in the Hill Country, to March with them, as Occaſion ſhould require: Others, that the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of them were up; and that the whole Weſt was in Arms, and at leaſt Twelve Thouſand of them were to March for <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to raiſe the Parliament; and that they had publickly declared, they would Sacrifice the Treaters, as Betrayers of their Country, and Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of her Liberty and Sovereignty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:0554400100:253"/>
To back theſe Reports, the Paper they fix'd up at <hi>Dumfreis</hi> was officiouſly printed; and at the End of it, a Poſtſcript, ſignifying, <hi>That this Paper was publickly read from the Market Croſs at</hi> Dumfreis, <hi>about one of the Clock Afternoon, on the Twentieth of</hi> November <hi>One Thouſand Seven Hundred and Six, with great Solemnity, in the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of many Thouſands; the Fire being ſurrounded with double Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons of Horſe and Foot in Martial Order.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The printing of this Paper was reſented by the Government, and the Printer fled from their Hands for the preſent; but this, as all other Inſults of this Nature, were no farther proſecuted, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment chooſing rather to pity and overlook the Follies of the People, on this Occaſion, as what they ſaw was politickly Enflamed by a Party, who only ſought to Embroil the Nation, and bring the beſt of the People to fall out with one another, that the Game might be made up out of the Deſtruction of both.</p>
            <p>By this Poſtſcript above, may appear to any Unbyaſs'd Perſon, the Artifice made uſe of, to magnify every Story, to encreaſe the Terror of the People, and, if poſſible, to encourage the like Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in other Places; For, as to the Fact, 'tis true, there were a Rabble of Country People, to the Number, as above, of about Two Hundred; I could never find, that they deſerved to be called more;—That there was any ſuch thing, as Squadrons or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, either of Horſe or Foot, or any Martial Order, ſuch as Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers or Commanders, or any thing like Troops, was a manifeſt For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, on purpoſe to Amuſe the Nation, and make the People Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, what they really had ſome Ground to Fear.</p>
            <p>I muſt alſo do thoſe People in the Weſt this Juſtice, that, tho great Endeavours had been uſed to Exaſperate them, and they were heartily againſt the Union, as appear'd, upon all Occaſions;—But when they came to ſee a little into the Hands that were at Work againſt it, and with whom they were like to joyn, even the Hotteſt among them came to themſelves, and to give them their Due, they behaved with great Calmneſs and Diſcretion; nor could they be brought into any Precipitations or Extravagancies, as was dayly threatned;—Mr. <hi>John Hepburn,</hi> their chief Leader and Miniſter, had been Reflected on, as one that had Inflamed and Animated them to riſe and take Arms, and that had been ſaid to threaten the Parliament;—when he was Diſcourſed with by ſome, who were under Concern for the publick Peace, it diſcovered the Frauds and Falſities of thoſe Suggeſtions, and how they were ſpread about to ſerve the great end of the publick Diſorders, and only amuſe the World; for he declared himſelf readily, that indeed they had Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, that the Union would be prejudicial to them; that they did not like the Articles, and thought the Treaters had not done their Duty, and the like; but that, as to their having any Deſign to diſturb the Government, or to appear in Arms, it was an Abuſe upon them; They had no ſuch Thought, nor ſhould they do any thing, but in a National Way; much leſs would they adhere to,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0554400100:254"/>
or encourage the Deſigns of a <hi>Jacobite French</hi> Party, whom, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, they abhorred, and would never joyn with.</p>
            <p>I think this is a plain Demonſtration of the Truth of what I have alledged all along this Story, <hi>viz.</hi> That there was a buſy Party, who run thro' the whole Country, by all poſſible Artifice, to Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate and Diſturb the Minds of the peaceable People; and, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, to bring them firſt to miſtaken Notions about, and Averſions to the Union in general; and then, to purſue thoſe Averſions, by all poſſible Methods of Diſtraction and Confuſion; and that this might bring the Honeſt and Well-meaning People of the Nation, either by their Numbers and Intereſt, to overthrow the Treaty; or, by their Folly and Miſcarriage, to overthrow themſelves, and ſo to weaken both.</p>
            <p>But GOD's Goodneſs to this Innocent People diſappointed them here, and we never found the leaſt Tumult or Diſorder on this ſide afterward, to the particular Mortification of the Party that hoped for worſe things from them.</p>
            <p>The Declaration therefore, or Proteſt, which they poſted up at <hi>Dumfries,</hi> and which the Party handed about at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> as a great Inſtance of what they hoped for from them, is rather publiſhed here, as an Example of the Notions they had poiſoned the Minds of the People with, than as the Senſe of the Nation, in the Caſe of the Union, and a Sketch of what they endeavoured to obtain from all the reſt, <hi>Appendix, N. E. x.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are now, in the Proceſs of this Affair, come on to the middle of <hi>November;</hi>—I muſt deſire the Reader, to go back a little to the Parliament; They had begun to read the Articles the ſecond time, in order to Vote on them; The beginning was a remarkable Debate, and held for ſeveral days, as will appear in the Minuts.</p>
            <p>The firſt Article was like putting the previous Queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether there ſhould be an Union with <hi>England,</hi> in the Senſe of the preſent Articles, or no: That is, whether there ſhould be an Incorporate Union of the Nation into one Kingdom, to have but one Name, Head, Signature, Conſtitution and Parliament, Yea or No.</p>
            <p>The Manner of this Queſtion, and the Difficulty with which it was carried in the Houſe, I refer to the Minuts, <hi>Folio</hi> But I cannot but obſerve one ſignificant <hi>Omen</hi> of the future good Succeſs of this Treaty, and which, I muſt owne, very much encouraged me to think it would go on, notwithſtanding all the vigorous Oppoſition it met with, was, That it was Voted on the moſt remarkable Day for Publick Deliverance, that ever happened to this Iſland. I am as far from laying any Streſs on ſuch inſignificant Circumſtances, as any Man; and I know, they can have no Efficiency in the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to paſs the mighty Events, which may be uſher'd ſo into the World; and therefore I beſpeak the Reader to note this, not as a thing I lay any real Weight upon.</p>
            <p>And yet it was impoſſible to obſerve, without ſome Emotion of the Mind, and without ſome Preſage of the good Iſſue of this Matter;

That the firſt Article, being the Great and Eſſential Part of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, was Voted and Approved on that remarkable 4<hi>th</hi> Day of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi> which was made happy to <hi>Britain; Firſt,</hi> By the Birth of the Great and Immortal King <hi>William,</hi> to whom theſe Nations owe ſo much, that they cannot look on their Church Reſtored, the Bloody Perſecuting Race of Tyrants Abdicated and Fled, Cruelty and Prelacy Dethroned, and all the Miſchiefs of a Ruin'd Nation Vaniſhed, and not Bleſs the Memory of that Great Agent of GOD's Goodneſs to them, without remarkable Ingratitude both to GOD Himſelf the Original, and to that Glorious Inſtrument of our Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city the King;—Nor was it this alone, which rendered this Day remarkable to us, but alſo, that the great and remarkable Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Britain</hi> formed in, and founded upon the Expedition of the ſame King <hi>William,</hi> bears Date from this Time, being the Day which he firſt Landed on at <hi>Torbay</hi> in the Weſt of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It could not but be a pleaſant Reflection to thoſe, who remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred the particulars of theſe things, to find, that, without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Calculation, or Direction of Men, the Concurrence of Cauſes ſhould ſo effectually jump, for the bringing to paſs the moſt remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable Tranſactions of <hi>Britain's</hi> Eſtabliſhment on the ſame Day; That her Deliverance from Tyranny, and the many many Oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a moſt Cruel and Barbarous Generation, that Aim'd at Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the Foundations of Liberty, and Overthrowing the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of both Kingdoms;—And her Deliverance from private Antipathies, the Peace of her Inhabitants, and the great Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>WE HOPE,</hi> of the Hearts and Affections of Two Nations, which, for many Years, had been filled with the moſt Fatal and Inveterat Averſions, ſhould take their Riſe together, and Date their Beginning both on the ſame Fourth of <hi>November;</hi> and both on that very Day, when the Great Inſtrument of her Deliverance, by whom ſhe was put in a Condition to bring all the reſt to paſs, was born into the World. Happy Day! Happy to <hi>Britain!</hi> Happy to all <hi>Europe!</hi> Since the Events of this Birth, the Actions of Heaven in the Hand of this Prince, have been the Foundation of all the Glorious Things, which have ſince happened in <hi>Europe,</hi> and of the Humbling the Great Thunderer of this Age, who had Eſtabliſhed his Kingdom in the Deſtruction of the Liberties of <hi>Europe,</hi> and in a View of the Subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
            <p>It was, on this Happy Day, that the firſt Article of the Union was paſs'd in the Parliament, after Infinite Struggles, Clamour, Railing, and Tumult of a Party; who, however they endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Engage the Honeſt Scrupulous Part of the People with them, yet gave this Eminent Diſcovery of the Principles of their own Actings, in that there was an Entire Conjunction of the <hi>Jacobite,</hi> the <hi>Prelatick,</hi> and the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Intereſt, in this particular; and the very Diſcovery of this, opened the Eyes of a great many People, who, in the Simplicity of their Hearts, had joyned in the general Oppoſition to the Union; but, when they ſaw the Tendency of Things, and whither it all led, when they ſaw the Society they
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0554400100:256"/>
were going to Embark with; when they ſaw the Enemies of the Proteſtant Settlement all Engag'd, and theſe very People, who had filled the Land with the Groans of Oppreſſion, and the Cries of Blood,—coming to Joyn Hands with them, againſt an Union with <hi>England;</hi> when they ſaw, that, to ſhun an Union with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, they were, of Neceſſity, to come into an Union with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils; Men that had Transformed themſelves into the very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal Nature, and viſibly Acted from Principles, in this particular Diabolical, in that they Tended to Erect the Abſolute Subjection of Nations to the Luſt, and Unbounded Appetites of Lawleſs Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants; when they ſaw theſe things ſo plainly, we then found an Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and the beſt, the moſt thinking, and moſt Judicious People, began firſt to ſtop, and conſider, and afterward wholly to withdraw from the Party; and the Clamour of the People, as if come to a <hi>Criſis,</hi> began not to be ſo univerſal, but to abate; and the more it did ſo, the more the ſecret Party, who lay at the Bottom of all the reſt, began to appear, and diſtinguiſh themſelves.</p>
            <p>The firſt Article being paſt, the Hopes of the Party depended upon Debating the Matters of Taxes, Exciſes, Cuſtoms; and, as far as poſſible, ſetting up the Popular Arguments of Care for the Poor,—the Impoſſibility of paying Duties, the Incapacity of the Trade to ſupport Exciſes and Cuſtoms, and the like; and here they had Recourſe from one Shift to another, and, like True Souldiers, tho in a Bad Cauſe, they fought their Ground by Inches.</p>
            <p>From Article to Article, they Diſputed every Word, every Clauſe, Caſting Difficulties and Doubts in the way of every Argument, Twiſting and Turning every Queſtion, and continually Starting Objections to gain Time; and, if poſſible, to throw ſome Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurmountable Obſtacle in the way.</p>
            <p>The Conſequence of this was, making Amendments to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles; Nor was it a ſmall Diſappointment to them, when they ſaw the Parliament willing to come into Amendments; and when, by the Prudence of the Committee, Appointed to make Calculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Examine thoſe already made, it appeared, that their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections were either Anſwer'd and Confuted, or the Clauſes ſo Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and Amended, as that they had no more Room to faſten any of their Cavils; They were intirely Defeated, and the Diſaſter was particular in this, that it ſhew'd ſtill the more plainly to the World, that their Deſign was not to be ſatisfied in the Amendment, and Alteration of what they Objected againſt; but, in having ſomething to demand, that would not, or could not have been reconciled.</p>
            <p>This cauſed a great many Trifling Emendations to paſs, which, in themſelves, had not Signification enough, either to deſerve the Name of Objections, or to need any Diſputing.</p>
            <p>'Tis evident, the Deſign was to load the Treaty with a Multitude of Amendments; Among which, it was to be hoped, ſome-might be found, which the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> would Scruple; or, at leaſt, that it would be a Precedent for the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> to Conſider the Treaty, and make more Amendments; which being
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0554400100:257"/>
to come down to <hi>Scotland</hi> again, to be conſidered here, would bring another Sitting on of Courſe; when, by Delays, the Time fix'd to the Firſt of <hi>May</hi> might be elapſed, the Seaſon of the Year ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, which hitherto had not favour'd them for the Riots and Tumults of the Country; and, in this Delay, they might find fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Advantages.</p>
            <p>How their future Actions conformed to this Suggeſtion, and how they were, in every Step, diſappointed, is the next thing to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd on;—But I muſt Adjourn it a little, and Return to the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Church, which were, at this time, in equal Agitation, proportionably conſidered; and the Party who oppoſed the Union, uſed all poſſible Artifice to bring things into Confuſion there, in which they diſcovered a double Miſchief in their Deſign, 1. To bring to paſs the grand Deſign of Obſtructing the Treaty. And, 2. if poſſible, to make the Diſorders they aim'd at, take their Riſe in the Churches Diſſatisfactions; by which laſt Thing, two other Ends would have been obtain'd.<list>
                  <item>1. They would have fix'd the Scandal of all the Conſequences, even of their own raſheſt Actions, upon the Church.</item>
                  <item>2. They would have drawn in Multitudes of Zealous, but In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent People, to have puſh'd on their Deſigns blindly, imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning they had been Acting for the Church.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>But, as before, ſo even now, the Prudence and Steadineſs of the Miniſters, in the Commiſſion of the Aſſembly, defeated all the wicked Deſigns of this Party;—For tho there were, in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, a great many Miniſters, who were ſincerely and heartily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Union,—yet they were not to be drawn in to Act with ſo much Imprudence, as the Projects of that Party deſigned; and therefore, what ever of Heat, or unhappy Warmth, at ſeveral times, happen'd there; and which, at one time, was feared, would have gone higher, yet the Temper and Sincerity of the main Body, both Miniſters and Elders, always over-ruled, and, in good time, ſuppreſs'd it.</p>
            <p>I have already given you the Addreſs, which the Commiſſion of the Aſſembly gave in to the Parliament, in order to obtain a Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for the Church.—This Addreſs effectually Anſwer'd the End of the Miniſters, in that it obtain'd a Vote in Parliament, <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 2<hi>d, viz. That, immediatly after the firſt Article of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion was Voted, the Parliament will proceed to an Act for the Security of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, Diſcipline, Worſhip and Government of the Church, as now by Law Eſtabliſhed within this Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this Time an Overture, or a Draught of an Act, Intituled, <hi>An Act for Security of the True Proteſtant Religion, and the Government of the Church, as by Law Eſtabliſhed within this Kingdom,</hi> was Read, and Ordered to be Printed.</p>
            <p>While this Overture was preparing in the Parliament; and after it was printed, there was no ſmall Endeavours uſed to poſſeſs the Minds of the People, that it was not a ſufficient Security for the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:0554400100:258"/>
There had been ſome Suggeſtions ſpread, that the Parliament would put them off, without effectually ſecuring the Church; and all poſſible Care was taken to improve this Notion, and the People were agitated on that Head, as much as poſſible: Some ſaid, the Overture ought to have been drawn up by the Commiſſion, not by the Parliament; and that it was leading them on in the Dark, with a general Vote, that an Act ſhould be paſs'd, without letting the Church judge, what was ſufficient for her Security, and what not.</p>
            <p>It was urg'd againſt this, That the Commiſſion had mentioned in their Addreſs, the Heads in which they ought to be ſecured; and there was no doubt, but the Parliament would make that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs the Foundation of the Act of Security; That, if there was any thing wanting, they would have time enough to renew their Addreſs, for the adding ſuch things, as they judged reaſonable; and that therefore they ought to ſtay, and not Interfere with the Proceedings of the Parliament, whoſe proper Work it was, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare their own Acts.</p>
            <p>But this did not ſatisfy ſome People, who inſiſting on the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions concerning themſelves in it; The Committee for Publick Affairs moved, <hi>October</hi> 25. in the Commiſſion, that ſome Members might be appointed, to ſee what the Parliament Men had prepar'd for the Security of the Church.</p>
            <p>This was the Time, in which the Debates in the Commiſſion run higheſt, and when ſome of the Elders, taking Offence at the Warmth of ſome of the Miniſters, withdrew themſelves from the Commiſſion;—But wiſer and more moderate Heads interpoſed, and prevented the ill Conſequences of theſe things, as will after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards appear.</p>
            <p>Upon Inſpecting the Overture for Security of the Church, and Viewing the Proviſion made there for ſuch Security, the Members of the Commiſſion, who were appointed as above, Reported, That there were ſome Difficulties remaining, which they deſired might be Conſidered.</p>
            <p>Theſe Difficulties began a warm Debate in the Committee of the Commiſſion, which were Reported as Conſidered by the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee; and are as follows,</p>
            <p>1<hi>ſt,</hi> That it would ſeem, That the Sovereign of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> in the Coronation Oath, is to be Sworn to Maintain the Rights and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as by Law Eſtabliſhed, without any Reſpect to the Church of <hi>Scotland.</hi> 2<hi>ly,</hi> That, by the Oath of Abjuration taken in <hi>England,</hi> obliging to Maintain the Limitations of the Succeſſion, and Qualification of the Succeſſor to the Crown, the Taker ſeems to be obliged to endeavour, to the outmoſt, the Secluſion even of ſuch Proteſtants from the Crown of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> who are not of the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as now by Law Eſtabliſhed there. 3<hi>ly,</hi> Several Difficulties being propoſed, with relation to Oaths, it was diſcours'd, how a Bar may be put to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliaments Impoſing Oaths upon the Miniſtry and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0554400100:259"/>
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> Inconſiſtent with the Principles of this Church. 4<hi>ly,</hi> That the People of <hi>Scotland</hi> may be exempted from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Teſt, in Uſe in <hi>England,</hi> which ſecludes all from any Office in <hi>Britain,</hi> or Benefit from the Crown thereof, who are of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and ſome other things, which was thought, might be uneaſy, and of Dangerous Conſequence to this Church, if not provided againſt in the Concluſion of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And theſe things being Diſcours'd upon at great length, were again Referred to the Committee for the Publick Affairs of the Church, to be further Conſidered, and they to Report.</p>
            <p>The Committee, to whom this Affair was Referred, Reported, That they have had ſeveral Meetings, and Diſcours'd at great length upon the Four Particulars relating to the Union, and heard ſeveral Miniſters and others upon their Scruples thereanent; and likeways upon a Fifth Particular, That the Conſtitution of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where Twenty Six Biſhops do Sit as Members, ſeems to be Inconſiſtent both with the Principles of Presbyterians, and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants and Engagements of this Church and Nation.</p>
            <p>It would be too long to ſet down here, how the Commiſſion was dayly Beſieg'd with Clamours and Cryes, raiſed upon the Jealouſics of the People;—And how they were urged to all manner of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper Reſentment, upon the Allegation now raiſed againſt the Security of the Church, as it was offered in the Overture: This De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate riſing ſo high, I think it not improper to print the Overture it ſelf, as it was firſt drawn up, as well as when it was with Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Engroſſed; The firſt Draught therefore you will find in the <hi>Appendix, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. F x.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall forbear entring here into any of the Heats and Indecencies which paſſed upon this Debate, ſince they came to no Extraordinary Height; and the Wiſdom and Forbearance on both ſides, prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Evil Conſequences which ſome hoped for from them.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Addreſs of the Commiſſion had its Birth in theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes; and tho the Enemies of the Union expected great Things from it, yet, as it came out quite another Thing than they deſigned, having been reduc'd to Shape, and ſtrip'd of all its Monſtrous Figure, in which it was expected to come into the World, it had two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, which ſerv'd to aſſiſt even againſt the Party, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed themſelves ſo much Good from it.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt,</hi> It convinced the World, That however it was ſpread abroad, that the Commiſſion would violently oppoſe the paſſing the Act of Security, as a Thing of no Conſequence, and ſo put a full Stop to the Work; it was evident, the Commiſſion was not to be Blinded by Out-ſides, nor Screwed up by Parties; but that, Calm and clear Sighted, they would go on, in all Caſes, with the ſame Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Conſideration and Temper, which they had ſhown from the Beginning.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>ly,</hi> It obviated the great Debate about the Church here ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Epiſcopal Juriſdiction of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or to the Votes and Suffrages of the Biſhops in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, in
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0554400100:260"/>
that, tho they did not Interfere, or Preſcribe to the Parliament, yet they Exonerated their Conſciences, and the whole Church of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by making, as it were, a Proteſt againſt it, as what they would not be underſtood to Comply with, either now, or by any Action in time coming, which ſhould be the Conſequence of the Union.</p>
            <p>Thus the Difficulties, tho reſolv'd to be preſented to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet came out in a Modeſt and Humble Dreſs, ſuitable to the Dignity, as well as Diſtance, of the Aſſembly, to which, and from which, it was preſented; and yet it came out in a Dreſs, which ſome Gentlemen of the Commiſſion, particularly of the Ruling El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, did not Approve of.</p>
            <p>Some would have had this Addreſs been called a Proteſt, but the Moderation of that Reverend Aſſembly cruſh'd that Motion; and after ſome Debate, it obtain'd the Title of the Repreſentation and Petition,—and was Reſolved on in the Commiſſion the 8<hi>th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> and the ſame Day preſented to the Parliament. The exact Copy of this Paper, you will find in the <hi>Appendix, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. G x.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When this Paper was Agreed on in the Commiſſion, the Earls of <hi>Rothes</hi> and <hi>Marchmont,</hi> Lords <hi>Polwarth</hi> and <hi>Forglen,</hi> Sir <hi>James Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell,</hi> the Lairds of <hi>Jerviſwood</hi> and <hi>Ardkinlaſs</hi> younger, and ſeveral other of the Gentlemen, who Sat there as Ruling Elders, Declared their Diſſent, and Entered their Proteſt againſt it, taking Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Hands of the Clerk of the Commiſſion; and promiſed to give in the Reaſons of their Diſſenting, which accordingly they gave in on the 15<hi>th</hi> of <hi>November.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the giving in theſe Reaſons by the Elders, the Commiſſion appointed a Committee to wait upon the Elders; and to know, if they inſiſted upon having their Reaſons for Proteſting Recorded; and to ſignify to them, That, if they did, the Commiſſion would be obliged to draw up their Anſwer to thoſe Reaſons, and to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord the ſame likewiſe.</p>
            <p>The Committee never obtain'd an Anſwer from the Gentlemen; in a Body; but as many as they met with, gave for Anſwer, That they did not inſiſt poſitively on it, but left it to the Commiſſion; either to Record it, and Form Anſwers to it, or not, as they ſaw moſt proper.</p>
            <p>The Committee having Reported this, the Commiſſion did, at laſt, think fit to Record the Proteſts, and the Reaſons annexed, and drew up their Anſwers to them, tho they waited two Months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they entered it; which, becauſe they are very material to a right Underſtanding of the preſent Debate, I have annexed to this Work, in the <hi>Appendix, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. H x I x.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I think the Reaſons and Anſwer are a ſufficient Comment upon this Text; and whoever pleaſes to peruſe them, will ſee, that tho the Deſigns of wicked Men pointed much farther, yet the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, both Miniſters and Elders, were wholly influenc'd by Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Peace, Honour, Conſcience, and the Good of the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:0554400100:261"/>
I know, ſome thought the Church went too far in this Affair, and eſpecially in the Matter of the Sacramental Teſt, which ſeem'd a Thing perfectly remote to them, and what they could have no Concern at all in; And the Gentlemen, in particular, were yet more willing than the Miniſters, to have let both that, and the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Civil Power of the Biſhops quite alone.</p>
            <p>But if we ſhall conſider, how the Miniſters were dayly beſieg'd, <hi>as before,</hi> with the Importunate Violences of the People; How many among them really, thought this part in particular directly againſt the Covenant; and how, by falſe Reports, many had been ſo Impoſed upon, as to Believe the Sacramental Teſt in <hi>England,</hi> extended even to the Members of Parliament, which ſhould be ſent from <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When, I ſay, they conſider the Fears and Jealouſies, which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread all ſorts of People; and how far the Artifices of a wicked Party were, at this time, in their Meridian, and had inexpreſſible Influences on all ſorts of People, they will, with me, admire, that the Commiſſion was able to maintain their ſteady Reſolution; How they Work't thro' thoſe Flouds, and kept the middle way with Temper and Moderation, to preſerve themſelves from the Snares laid for them.</p>
            <p>All theſe things conſidered, it was, in moſt Peoples Opinion, a Victory gain'd, and the Party received a manifeſt Diſappointment, even in this Repreſentation, in that the Commiſſion could be brought to no Precipitations, as ſome People flattered themſelves they ſhould.</p>
            <p>However this may be the general Opinion, I know ſome People took ill the Length they went in this Affair, and thought they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded their proper Sphere;—But, I believe, thoſe Gentlemen are very well ſatisfied with the Unanſwerable Arguments drawn from hence againſt thoſe, <hi>who, not content with this Length,</hi> thought to Upbraid them with Forgetting the National Obligation of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which they fairly quitted themſelves of by that Article, in which they declare Civil Places of Church Men to be not ſubmitted to by them, but againſt both their Covenant and Conſciences, and ſo have fairly Exonerated the Church from that Affair, which ſtuck ſo near her.</p>
            <p>The Repreſentation was preſented to the Houſe, juſt when the Overture for the Security of the Church was under their Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and however it did not, at preſent, meet with a very favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Reception, even by thoſe who were the Churches very Good Friends, who thought, <hi>as before,</hi> they run it too high, and alſo ill tim'd it; yet neither did the Gentlemen wholly omit the things requeſted therein, tho they ſeem'd to ſleep for ſome time; but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the Clauſe about the Valuation of Teinds and Plantation of Kirks, which they paſs'd an Act for by it ſelf: The Matter of Oaths ſeems alſo ſettled in the Amendments to the Overture: The other, as the Matter of the Sacramental Teſt, and the Suffrages of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0554400100:262"/>
Biſhops in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, was ſilently let fall, as things they could, by no means, meddle with in the Treaty.</p>
            <p>Here the Oppoſers of the Union met with another Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; For, had theſe Two Articles been inſiſted on, they knew the Event would have been a Rupture of the Treaty, and their great End had been Anſwer'd, <hi>viz.</hi> To obtain the Parliament to demand ſomething, which they knew <hi>England</hi> could never grant.</p>
            <p>Thus this Storm blew over, the Act of Security for the Church was Voted, and laid by to be annexed to the Articles, and made part of the Union, as ſhall afterwards appear.</p>
            <p>As this had made a great Noiſe in the Aſſembly, ſo it had been no leſs canvaſſed all over the Nation: Some condemned the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly in the main, and pretended to cenſure them publickly, for engaging themſelves in Matters, that had ſo plain a Tendency to breaking up the Union, and deſiring the Parliament to concern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in thoſe Affairs in <hi>England,</hi> which could really admit of no Debate in this Caſe.</p>
            <p>But, as if the Commiſſion wanted the Authority of their Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuents to back them in their Proceedings, and to juſtify their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, the reſpective Presbyteries in the Country began to come in with Letters, or a ſort of Addreſſes, teſtifying their Approbation of what the Commiſſion had done, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the Commiſſion diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly avoiding every thing that was Tumultuary or Popular, gave a cold Anſwer to them; as particularly, to that of <hi>Dumfermling,</hi> who ſubjoyning to their Approbation of the Petition their Deſire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Faſts Publick and Private, as in a Time of Impending Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; The Commiſſion Reſolved, That <hi>their Act about Faſts paſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, did ſufficiently Anſwer the Presbyteries Deſire,</hi> and ſo took no notice of the reſt; which prudent way of Proceeding ſtopt that Deſign, which ſeem'd to be only to make the Repreſentation as Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular as they could, that it might, on the one Hand, encourage further Petitions, and ſecondly oblige the Parliament to come into their Meaſures.</p>
            <p>While this was thus carrying on in the Commiſſion, the Country began to be very Uneaſy, and Threatnings came in every day, of coming up in Armies and Rabbles, to raiſe the Parliament, and to deſire, that the Church might be ſecured.</p>
            <p>The Presbyteries of <hi>Glaſgow</hi> and of <hi>Stirling</hi> ſent Letters to the Commiſſion, containing Heads of Grievances, and repreſenting ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things, which they deſired the Commiſſion to demand of the Parliament, for the Churches Security.</p>
            <p>To this the Commiſſion of the Aſſembly anſwer'd, That they had done, or were now doing, all that was deſir'd in their Letters.</p>
            <p>An ill natur'd Motion was made in the Commiſſion alſo, to ſend Circular Letters to all the Presbyteries, to ſend up their Members to the Commiſſion, and a Committee was appointed to conſider of it;—But this occaſioned ſuch Variety of Debates, That the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee could come to no Reſolution, but referred it back to the Commiſſion, and there it dropped.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:0554400100:263"/>
This was a plain Deſign to renew the Debates; and, if poſſible, to bring the Commiſſion to proteſt, or declare themſelves againſt the Union.</p>
            <p>The Repreſentation was now before the Parliament, but, as yet, they took no notice of it; and it was apparent, That they purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Treaty, for ſome time, without any reſpect to the ſaid Repreſentation; and indeed it was foreſeen they would do ſo, the Gentlemen eaſily ſeeing, that, if theſe things were inſiſted, it was juſt a Reſolution to break off the Union.</p>
            <p>The other Party eagerly Reported about Town, That it was a Diſreſpect to the Church, not to regard her Solemn Repreſentation; and then the Conſequences of the Biſhops Voting in Parliament were laid forth, and the Danger of the Church was now their general Diſcourſe: Some were alarm'd with this <hi>Chimera,</hi> That the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament had not a ſincere Reſpect for the Churches Safety; That the Gentlemen had no great Concern about the Matter, and ſo the Church would be Expoſed to her Enemies, by the Negligence of her Friends.</p>
            <p>But the Commiſſion ſaw thro' all this; and having done what they thought their Duty, both for the Churches Security, and for the Exonerating their Conſciences in the Caſes they could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with, they reſolved to ſtand ſtill, and leave the Conſequences of Things to-Divine Providence, without puſhing at Things Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable, or ſuch Things as tended only to Diviſion.</p>
            <p>This Steadineſs of the Miniſters broke all the Meaſures of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; Their Hopes to Embroil the Miniſters with the Parliament va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed;—And the Diſcourſe of the Repreſentation or Petition began to grow old and die.</p>
            <p>The Commisſion had their Hands full of their Repreſentations of another ſort, about the Growth of Popery, the ill Practices of ſome of the Depoſed Miniſters, and the like, and ſo it wore off by Degrees.</p>
            <p>I mention, in this Account, the Prudence and Moderation of the Miniſters ſo often, not that I deſign to write Panegyricks here, much leſs to flatter the Perſons of the Miniſters; but who ever knew the Management of that Time, and reflects back on the Particulars, will eaſily joyn with me in this,—That there were ſeveral parts of Management practiſed upon the Miniſters, in order to ruine their Counſels, beſides what the Open Debates of the Commisſion diſcovered, and particularly ſuch as follows,</p>
            <p n="1">1. There was a Deſign, if posſible, to bring the Miniſters into a general Declaration againſt the Union, as dangerous to their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, inconſiſtent with their Principles, and contrary to the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the National Covenant; <hi>Of this I have ſpoken in the Courſe of the Story.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. There was a manifeſt Deſign to bring them to a Rupture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves; and that, if poſſible, ſuppoſing the Union ſhould proceed, or not proceed, the diſagreeing Party might be brought to a breaking off, or dividing from the reſt, and ſo form a ſettled ſtated Diſſent, or Breach in the Church;—Nor was this
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0554400100:264"/>
a thing of ſmall Conſequence; For it was really big with a large Variety of Miſchiefs, and very cunningly contriv'd; Snares were laid for the whole Body, not of the Aſſembled Miniſters only, but the Conſtitution of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> whoſe Deſtruction was almoſt viſible in the Project, had it met with Succeſs.</p>
            <p>Had the Union been compleated without the Concurrence of the Miniſters in Commiſſion,—either the Church Affair muſt have been left out, or the Enemies of it would have always ſaid, it had been ſettled without her Approbation, and conſequently the Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment been both Imperfect and Illegal.</p>
            <p>Had one Party declared for the Union, and another againſt it, and, had both thoſe Parties adhered to their reſpective Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by any publick Separation as a Party, the Houſe had been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided againſt it ſelf, and the Conſequence would have been hoped for with but too much probability.</p>
            <p>In this very Caſe, the Prudence of the Miniſters, I ſay, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, and next to the Wiſdom of Providence directing, was the only means of preventing the Miſchief contrived: It is not to be doubted, but, in the Commiſſion of the Aſſembly, and among the Miniſters without, there were men of various Sentiments, ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, and ſome for the Union; But their Wiſdom was particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſeen in this, that however they differed in the debating things, they always concurr'd in every publick Act of the Commiſſion, and made no Diviſion for nor againſt it.</p>
            <p>We find but one Proteſt in the whole Affair, which was in the Caſe of the Repreſentation and Petition; and this began among the Ruling Elders, and continued there; for none of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ever adhered to that Proteſt, but even thoſe that were againſt ſome parts of the Repreſentation, yet, ſeeing themſelves out-voted, acquieſc'd; Nor was all the Repreſentation objected againſt by any Body;—It was a Paper, I doubt nor, ſome hoped to draw Miſchief from, yet that Miſchief had its Diſappointment effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, tho the Paper had its Succeſs, in being carryed on; for it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed the Minds of many, who, being ſatisfied of having Exone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated their Conſcience, acquieſe'd in other Caſes with the more Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; Nor was the Repreſentation in general without its Particular Reaſons to be aſſigned for it, as is further expreſs'd in the Sequel of the Story: As to the Miniſters in all other Caſes, how warmly ſoever they debated, and with whatſoever Firmneſs the ſeveral Miniſters adhered to their Opinions, yet they ſubmitted their Votes to the Plurality, and all things were carryed in a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and orderly way, to the great Diſappointment of their Enemies, and to the great Eaſe and Satisfaction of all good Men of every Opinion.</p>
            <p>Nor ſhould I do Juſtice here to particular Perſons, if I did not acknowledge, and record it to his Honour, That much of this is juſtly due to the Prudence, Patience and Temper of the Reverend Moderator Mr. <hi>William Wiſhart,</hi> then Miniſter of <hi>Leith,</hi> who was Moderator of the Aſſmbly, and alſo of the Commiſſion, and who
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0554400100:265"/>
acted the true Moderator in all theſe Diſputes wiſely, Calming, Tempering, and with Difficulty enough, Reducing the warmeſt Debates to a Method of Concluſion;—And I muſt owne, he had a Task of no ſmall Difficulty, tho he had, no doubt, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence and Aſſiſtance of the Men of moſt Candor, Temper and Judgment on either ſide, ſince it could not but be viſible to every Thinking Man, who had any Concern for the Good of the Church, that, to run any Differences up to a Head, could iſſue in nothing but the utmoſt Confuſion, gratifie the Enemy, grieve all Good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and in the end ruine the Peace of the Church.</p>
            <p>And this Remark of mine is the more juſt, in that I could not but obſerve, that the Debates on theſe Affairs had ſometimes that unhappy Warmth, that they ſeem'd to tend neceſſarily to a Breach; and to come to the very point, and Lookers on, of whom I was one <hi>with a ſad Heart,</hi> expected ſomething Fatal, not to the Union only, but to the whole Church, muſt unavoidably have follow'd every Debate;—and yet we always found cooler Thoughts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, and wiſe Men yielding this way and that, continually main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a Harmony, in concluding what ever there was in debating.</p>
            <p>Another piece of Conduct was very Inſtrumental to preſerving the publick Tranquillity, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Miniſters generally ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, kept theſe Debates out of the Pulpit; For tho all manner of Society was taken up with Diſputes of the grand Affair, the Pulpit was very free of it; I ſay, generally ſpeaking, what Indiſcretions there were, had not Influence enough on the reſt, to recommend the Example;—Particularly, I think it was a very great Wiſdom in thoſe Miniſters, who were for the Union, and who had many Prompters to it, had the Government to countenance them in it, and Enemies enough to catch at it, if they had; I ſay, it was their Wiſdom that they forbore it;—And I think theſe happy Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences followed to prove it ſo.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It took away all pretence from thoſe People, who deſigned, in this unhappy Game, to play one part of the Church againſt the other, and ſet up one ſide againſt the other more effectually.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It took away the Ground of Pulpit Clamour, and kept thoſe People ſilent, who, had it once begun there, would have been loudeſt by far in the Exclamation;—For, had one Party firſt preached for it, the other would, of Courſe, have preached againſt it, and ſo the Pulpit been made a meer Stage of Contention.</p>
            <p>But, on both ſides, the Miniſters, as well on private as publick Days, let it generally alone; They prayed for Direction and Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on the Parliament, and on the Meeting of the Miniſters, as tranſacting difficult and doubtful Caſes, but avoided entring into Debates.</p>
            <p>I think I do them nothing but Juſtice therefore, in hinting, that the Temper and Calmneſs, with which the Generality of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters behaved in this nice Occaſion, was very great, and contribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very much to the quiet carrying on the great Work.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0554400100:266"/>
Soon after this, the Country Tumults came upon the Stage; and, as it was <hi>a Peculiar</hi> to this Treaty, that the very Methods taken to ruine it, concurred to preſs it forward; ſo theſe Tumults ſerved to open the Eyes, and calm the Spirits of abundance of thoſe honeſt People, who were prejudiced before; who, tho they were willing to oppoſe the Union, as what did not correſpond with their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and as they thought with the publick Good; yet, when they ſaw it going to Arms, Rebellion, and Blood; and when they ſaw <hi>this farther,</hi> that, in order to oppoſe this National Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they were to joyn in a Civil War againſt their Governours, with their and the Nations known Enemies; Their Eyes began to open, and they ſlackned very much, from that time, their Appearance againſt the Treaty.</p>
            <p>This manifeſtly ſhewed the difference between the Men, who, in the Singleneſs of their Hearts, oppoſed it, as apprehending it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe for the eſtabliſh'd Church, and inconſiſtent with their National Engagements; and thoſe, on the other Hand, who oppoſed it, as contrary and fatal to the Popiſh Succeſſion of <hi>James</hi> VIII, as they called him, and the Epiſcopal Hierarchy:—And theſe differed juſt as the <hi>Two Harlots</hi> in <hi>Solomons</hi> time;—The true Mother of the Child choſe to loſe her Poſſeſſion of him, rather than that the Child ſhould be murthered; ſo theſe faithful Friends to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, however poſſeſſed againſt the Union by the publick Clamour; yet they would chooſe to ſuffer the Inconveniencies they feared, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than ſee their Country involved in Blood, a Civil War break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out in the Bowels of the Kingdom, and Forreign Popiſh, or Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical Powers invading their Privileges, and pulling down all before them.</p>
            <p>This will appear to be the Caſe, in the farther purſuit of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and the ſight of this affected the Hearts of a great many of thoſe, who had any Compaſſion for their Country; and from this time forward, the Commiſſion met with leſs Diſturbance from the hot People on theſe Heads, but went on calmly, and with all the Temper and Moderation that could be expected.</p>
            <p>The Letter from the Presbytery of <hi>Hamilton</hi> gave them ſome little Diſturbance, but it was ſoon over; and their Circular Letter to Presbyteries, to endeavour to preſerve the publick Peace, not only ſhewed their own Reſolution to keep all quiet and peaceable, but diſcouraged all Endeavours afterward to diſorder them: Of which by it ſelf.—</p>
            <p>But things were now grown to a ſtrange Height; and the ſame Engines, who ſo boaſted of the Effects of the Repreſentation and Petition above ſaid, ſhewed themſelves not idle in their Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Affairs abroad; for they carryed on the Diſcontents of the People to all poſſible Height.</p>
            <p>And indeed the Caſe of the poor common People of <hi>Scotland</hi> was very hard, in reſpect to their Share in theſe Matters; They are not the only common People in the World, who take Things by whole Sale; and who being inflamed with the Clamours and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0554400100:267"/>
of the more knowing ſort, their Land-Lords, Leaders, Heads of Families, and, <hi>as they too properly call them, MASTERS,</hi> and alarmed with Out-cries of Dangers, and Diſtreſſes; which were to come upon them by the Union; Things which they could not Anſwer, nor had any Reaſon to queſtion the Truth of, ſeeing their great Men poſſeſſed with the Belief of them: 'Tis no wonder they were exaſperated to the higheſt Degree, and ready to attempt any thing, to ſave themſelves from the Deſtruction at Hand.</p>
            <p>Again, they were not altogether the People, that were diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to them neither, from whom theſe Diſcontents began; Had they been only the Epiſcopal, or <hi>Jacobite,</hi> or Popiſh Party, that had ſtarted theſe Things, a ſhort Anſwer would have opened the Eyes of the common People; and it had ſufficed to tell them, from whom their Objections came.</p>
            <p>But when, by the Subtilty and Artifice of theſe Men, they had drawn in a great many of the Honeſt Well-meaning People of the Country, who were known to be well affected to the preſent Civil Eſtabliſhment of the Nation, and zealous for its Religious Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; when theſe were ſeen among the Number of the Warm Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers of the Union, ſhaking their Heads at the Articles, and fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the terrible Conſequences, which were talk'd of;—Who can wonder, that the reſt of the People began to be uneaſy, and that thoſe Uneaſineſſes, at laſt, broke out into Exceſſes, Madneſs, and Diſtraction.</p>
            <p>The People of <hi>Scotland,</hi> I ſay, are not the firſt Inſtance; How eaſily it is to be impoſed upon; and how readily a Mob is raiſed by a Rumour. How ſoon did the <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Aſia</hi> put all <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in an Uproar, when they made them believe their Worſhip was in Danger by <hi>Paul</hi>'s Preaching; and that he not only invaded their Worſhip, but had actually defiled the Temple. How readily did they lay hold of the Bleſſed Apoſtle, and had certainly Murdered him, if the Civil Authority had not, <hi>aſſiſted by the Military,</hi> reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him out of the Hands of the Mob, and put the Caſe in the way of a fair Hearing.</p>
            <p>It was not for the poor People, to diſtinguiſh the Original of Cauſes and Things, nor who was at the Bottom of theſe Rumours; it was not for them to diſtinguiſh the Hand of <hi>Joab</hi> in all this; whether <hi>Jacobite</hi> or Papiſt was the Original of this Matter, was not for them to examine; They ſaw their Superiors joyning in the ſame Complaint, and every Party ſaw ſome of their reſpective Chiefs embark'd.</p>
            <p>The common People could look no further; The Epiſcopal Poor ſaw their Curates Tooth and Nail againſt it; The Ignorant and Indifferent Poor, ſaw their <hi>Jacobite</hi> Land-Lords and Maſters Railing at it; and which was worſe ſtill, the Honeſt Presbyterian poor People ſaw ſome of their Gentlemen, and ſuch as they had remarked and noticed <hi>to be Hearty Presbyterians,</hi> yet appearing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it;—Who then can cenſure the poor depending, uninfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and abuſed People?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:0554400100:268"/>
And how, but by theſe concurring Accidents, was it poſſible, the poor deluded People of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> and the Weſt, could be drawn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Mobs and Tumults, in Gratification of that very Party, to whom they have been the very Antipodes, the Reverſe, even in all the Ages of the Reformation: By whom they had been Plundered, Rifled, Butchered, and Perſecuted, in the moſt Barbarous Manner, with Cruelties and Extravagancies innumerable; Will any Man ſay, the Men of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> Famous for their Zeal in Religion, and the Liberties of their Country, even from the very Infancy of the Reformation, were now turned Enemies to the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and ready to Fight againſt her, in the Quarrel of their Bloody and Inveterate Enemies, the Papiſts and <hi>Jacobites?</hi> It could not be.</p>
            <p>Will any Man ſuggeſt, That <hi>Glaſgow</hi> had forgotten her ſelf ſo much, that the Blood of her Citizens and Inhabitants, ſhed in the old Articles of <hi>Pentland,</hi> and <hi>Bothwell,</hi> and the Ravages made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her, and the Countries round her, after thoſe Unhappy Times, even to the Confines of the Revolution, were forgotten?—Will any Body think, the <hi>Glaſgow</hi> Men had ſo far forgot the Hiſtory of Twenty Years ago only, that they could now joyn with the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers of their Brethren and Fathers, and take up Arms in favour of their Mortal Enemies? No, No, Nothing leſs, It was all Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and meer Artifice, the Party played the Presbyterian againſt the Presbyterian, the <hi>Williamite</hi> againſt the <hi>Williamite;</hi> and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubtilly poſſeſs'd a few Honeſt, but Deluded People, with the Frenzy of the Time, made them the Tools of their Projects, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, to bring them to pull down one another, that they might af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, with the more Eaſe, devour them both.—</p>
            <p>And this leads me of Courſe into the Story of the <hi>Glaſgow</hi> Rabble, which now came upon the Stage; and which, in its Turn, tho raiſed with a differing Deſign, was one of the Proofs of GODs Providence, working every thing, <hi>howſoever pointed at the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> to Act for it, and further its Concluſion.</p>
            <p>They had had in <hi>Edinburgh</hi> continual Alarms of the Riſing of the People in the Weſt and North parts, in order, by Force, to put an end to the Treaty, tho the People themſelves knew nothing of it, nor had any ſuch Deſign: To day it was in <hi>Angus,</hi> to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in <hi>Galloway,</hi> now at <hi>Stirling,</hi> then at <hi>Lanerk,</hi> then at <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> then at <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> but nothing yet appeared; and ſome began to mock theſe Fears as groundleſs:—The Party made their different Uſes of the Reports, to day enlarge them to terrify and amuſe, to morrow leſſen them again as meer Rumours, to leſſen the Watchfulneſs of the Government, and make them ſecure; but the Deſign was manifeſtly to procure the Tumults they expected, by reporting they were begun.</p>
            <p>That theſe Fears were not groundleſs, or thoſe Alarms meer <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera's,</hi> may be ſeen by the Commiſſion of the Kirks Circular Letters to the ſeveral Presbyteries, to deſire them to keep the Peace, and to be earneſt to prevent ſuch Tumults; To which the Presbytery of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:0554400100:269"/>
gave an Anſwer, which ſeemed to object againſt thoſe Fears as unjuſt, tho it did not afterwards appear ſo. <hi>Vide</hi> the <hi>Appendix, N. M.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, tho in the Story of the <hi>Glaſgow</hi> Rabble, I ſhall be obliged to mention the unhappy Slip in thoſe Prudentials, which, as I have obſerved, the Miniſters, <hi>generally ſpeaking,</hi> behaved with;—I ſhall not, however, offend any Perſon of common Charity, ſince I ſhall be far from ſaying, the Gentleman here did this with a Deſign to raiſe the Tumult that followed; much leſs would I ſo much as ſuſpect, that he could, in the leaſt, have it in his Thoughts, to gratify the Folly and projected Deſtruction of the Kirk of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which, in all theſe things, was apparent enough in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Party that puſhed on theſe things.</p>
            <p>As to the Raſhneſs and Intemperate Zeal, or <hi>whatever other miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Foundation it had,</hi> producing the Heat and Warmth of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, I have the Charity to believe, he is convinced of the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of that; and ſo, while I am obliged to repeat the Circumſtance, I ſhall, as little as poſſible, reflect upon the Perſon, being deſirous, in all Caſes, rather to Cover than Expoſe the Undeſigning Failures of all Honeſt Men, as what they may be led into by Miſtake, but never proſecute, when their Judgments are better Informed.</p>
            <p>But to come to the particulars of this Unhappy Story at <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> which I ſhall relate with all the Impartiality poſſible, and without Reſpect of Perſons, both for the ſake of the Hiſtory, which 'tis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Tranſmit faithfully to Poſterity; as alſo, for ſetting things in a true Light, and placing the Guilt where it is juſtly due, which, at preſent, is underſtood to the prejudice of that City in general; and of thoſe Honeſt Gentlemen among the Inhabitants, who had no Concern in it, unleſs it were to be Inſulted and made Uneaſy by it.</p>
            <p>The firſt Uneaſineſs that I meet with among the People here, I mean that was particular, <hi>for the general <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neaſineſſes about the Treaty were viſible every where, as I have hinted already,</hi> was about Addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</p>
            <p>Great had been the Endeavours of a Party of Men, all over the Kingdom, to bring in numerous Addreſſes to the Parliament againſt the Treaty, in order to fortify that Argument, which was now brought in, as a ſtrong Bar againſt the immediat Proceeding, <hi>viz.</hi> That it was againſt the general Inclination of the People; which you will find Moved in the Houſe, upon the ſecond Reading of the firſt Article, as <hi>per</hi> the Minuts.</p>
            <p>The Party at <hi>Glaſgow</hi> had been very buſy to perſwade the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates to Addreſs, as the other Royal Burghs had <hi>many of them</hi> done; but the Magiſtrates ſhewing no Inclination to it, they found there was no way to bring it about, but by the common People.</p>
            <p>Nor could all their Credit with the common People bring it to paſs; the Inſtruments being chiefly <hi>Jacobites,</hi> Papiſts, and Epiſcopal Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whoſe Reputation and Intereſt in the City of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> and parts adjacent, had always been but very low, and now lower than
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0554400100:270" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ever; ſo that, to effect their Deſign, they had Recourſe to the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy of the Times, <hi>viz.</hi> Deluding and Impoſing upon others, and this did their Work; for, had they not made uſe of ſome weaker Brethren, who had more Influence upon the People, they had never brought it to paſs.</p>
            <p>To bring in ſome of theſe, all the Popular Arguments mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before were Improved; among others, the Danger of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> I believe I may ſay <hi>in their favour,</hi> was not the leaſt.</p>
            <p>Drawn in by theſe ſpecious Pretences, the <hi>Jacobite</hi> Party had the Pleaſure to ly by, and ſee their Work done to their Hand; and the People being ſufficiently Enflamed, they waited the Iſſue, when one Unhappy Indiſcretion, <hi>to ſay no worſe of it,</hi> finiſhed all their Hopes, and brought to paſs the Miſchief they deſigned, in the beſt manner for them they could have wiſhed for.</p>
            <p>Some of the Elders of the Church had privatly waited on the Provoſt, whether moved by their Miniſter, or by the common People, or of their own Heads, I ſhall not determine, tho 'tis not very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to Trace it to its beginning; but 'tis apparent, the Miniſter we are to mention, as well as ſome others in the Town, were very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt for the thing; Their Buſineſs was, it ſeems, to move the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſt, that an Addreſs might be pretented to the Parliament againſt the Union; They might have commanded a Popular Addreſs among themſelves, but that was not what they deſired, but an Addreſs in the Name of the City by the Provoſt, Baillies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Provoſt anſwered <hi>to this purpoſe,</hi> That he did not think it would be prudent for them to Addreſs at this time, that he had been at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and had conſulted the Lord Advocat, and ſome of the City of <hi>Glaſgows</hi> beſt Friends, and all unanimouſly adviſed them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, and gave it as their Opinion, it was not their Intereſt to do it: Particularly he reminded them, the Parliament had but, the laſt Seſſion, granted them the Tax of Two Pennies the Pint; and if they ſhould now appear as a Town in this Addreſs, it might urge them to Repeal their Grant, and the City might be a great Sufferer.</p>
            <p>This was a very good Reaſon, why he ſhould decline the Addreſs, if the Gentlemen had been in a Condition to hearken to Reaſon; for if the Magiſtrates had Addreſſed, they muſt alſo have followed it with Reaſons and Arguments openly as a Body, which, in ſuch Caſe, would have been, in all Probability, ill taken by the Parliament, if, <hi>as is very likely,</hi> thoſe Reaſons had been ſuch, as came in from other places, peremptorily Inhibiting their Proceedings, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaching <hi>their Power to Act,</hi> without Leave from their Conſtituents, which indeed was the thing now inſiſted upon, and generally aimed at in the Project of Addreſſing.</p>
            <p>The Provoſt having thus, tho very calmly and reſpectfully, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined the Matter, the People appeared very uneaſy, and ſome hot Expreſſions had been let fall in Diſcourſe about the Town, That they would have an Addreſs one way or other; But one Unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Accident ſoon diſcovered the Meaning of the whole.</p>

               </expan> the Faſt appointed by the Commiſſion of the Aſſembly was kept in <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> Mr. <hi>C—k</hi> Miniſter of the Trone Kirk Preached from the Words in <hi>Ezra</hi> 8. 21. <hi>And I proclaimed a Faſt at the River of</hi> AHAVA, <hi>that we might afflict our ſelves before our GOD, to ſeek of Him a right Way for us, and for our little Ones, and for all our Subſtance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall convince the Gentleman concerned, that this Account is not made for a Satyr upon him, 'tis too ſerious a Subject; and when both he, and thoſe who heard him, reflects on, how much more his Unhappy Temper, at that time, forc'd from him, than I ſet down here, all which I have by me <hi>verbatim,</hi> as he ſpoke it, he will, I ſay, be convinced, that I talk no more, than, in the Obligation of a Hiſtorian to Truth of Fact, I am bound to do.</p>
            <p>In the Concluſion of his Sermon, after telling his Hearers the ſad Condition they were brought to, and how forward <hi>Glaſgow</hi> uſed to be in the Honeſt Cauſe, he added to this purpoſe, <q>Addreſſes would not do, and Prayers would not do, there muſt be other Methods; 'Tis true Prayer was a Duty, but we muſt not reſt there,—</q> and cloſed it with theſe Words, <q>Wherefore up, and be Valiant for the City of our GOD.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I am not at all apprehenſive of having the Truth of theſe Words queſtioned, having received them from the Mouths of more than two or three of the principal Inhabitants of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> who heard them ſpoken; and if the miſplacing a Word ſhould be ſnatcht at, <hi>I venture to ſay,</hi> that this was the full Purport of the Expreſſion, without the leaſt Variation; as to the Weak Good Man that ſpoke them, I will not ſuggeſt, that he foreſaw the Conſequence of them, or had any ſuch thing in his Deſign, tho it calls for ſome Charity to gueſs his Meaning; The kindeſt thing I can ſay of them, is, that he did not mean at all what followed, but ſpoke in his Haſte; for GOD forbid I ſhould ſuggeſt he mean'd to raiſe a Rebellion, and to bring his Country into all that Blood and Confuſion, which, if GODs Goodneſs had not prevented it, had certainly followed.</p>
            <p>The Sermon ended about eleven a Clock, and the People were ſo Enflamed before, that, by one of the Clock, the Mob were gotten together, their Drum was Beat in the Back-ſtreets, and all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions we are now to ſpeak of followed.</p>
            <p>The next day, the Deacons of the Trades, <hi>which is the ſame as in</hi> London, <hi>the Maſters of the Companies,</hi> followed with a meddling Number of <note n="a" place="bottom">By Tradeſmen in <hi>Scotland</hi> is underſtood none but the meaner ſort of People, ſuch as Shoemakers, Smiths, Butchers, Weavers, and the like, as in <hi>England</hi> are called Handycrafts, the Shop-Keepers, ſuch as Mercers, Drapers, Grocers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are all called Merchants.</note> Tradeſmen, came to <note n="b" place="bottom">A Chamber in the Tolbooth, where the Magiſtrates ſit, and where the City Council aſſembles, and where the Provoſt generally is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Morning.</note> the Council-Houſe, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0554400100:272"/>
leaving the People below, the Deacons of Trades and ſome few went up to the Provoſt, and demanded of him very rudely, if he would Addreſs.</p>
            <p>The Provoſt, tho ſurprized with their manner, compoſed himſelf, and, according to his known Calmneſs and Steadineſs of Temper, told them, that he was not ſatisfied to Addreſs; and an Eminent Inhabitant of the Town, <hi>viz.</hi> The Laird of <hi>Blackhouſe,</hi> uſed a great many Arguments with them, civilly to perſwade them to be eaſy and ſatisfied, and not to promote any Diſorders in the City.</p>
            <p>While they were thus Diſcourſing in the Town-Houſe, the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the People encreaſed without, and began to be Tumultuous; but as ſoon as the Deacons came out, and Reported to them in ſhort, that the Provoſt had refuſed to Addreſs, the People fell a Shouting, and Raging, and Throwing Stones, and Raiſed a very great Uproar.</p>
            <p>And here the Deacons deſervedly obtain the Title of the Raiſers of this Rabble; for, had they related the Calmneſs, the Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and the Manner, with which the Provoſt very diſcreetly An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered them, the People might very eaſily have been quietly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed; but now it was too late, the Anſwer, as it was given to them, was only in groſs, that the Provoſt was Reſolute, and would not Addreſs.</p>
            <p>Enraged thus, they ſlung Stones at the Windows, and, as much as they could, Inſulted the Provoſt; but he found Means to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, ſo that they could not hurt him for that time.</p>
            <p>In this Rage, they went directly to the Provoſts Houſe, got into it, took away all his Arms, which were about twenty five Muſquets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some few things were ſtollen in the Throng, but that was not much: From thence they went to the Laird of <hi>Blackhouſe</hi>'s Dwelling, broke his Windows, and ſhewed their Teeth, and thus the firſt Tumult ended.</p>
            <p>The Provoſt retired for a while out of Town, and the Laird of <hi>Blackhouſe</hi> alſo, not knowing what the Iſſue of theſe things might be.</p>
            <p>I pay no Complement at all here, but a Debt to Truth, in not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the Provoſt of <hi>Glaſgow</hi> for that time, <hi>

            <p>I mention this to obviate the Suppoſition, that the Rabble took this Occaſion to Inſult him, upon former Reſentments, as has been uſual in like Caſes.</p>
            <p>The Provoſt being withdrawn, and the Addreſs they deſigned thus baulk'd.</p>
            <p>They ſet it on Foot without him, and indeed they effectually An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Magiſtrates Deſire, who reſolved, if there was an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, it ſhould be a meer Mob Addreſs.</p>

            <p>Every Man that refuſed to ſign it, was Threatned to be Rabbled, and have his Houſe Plundered, which made a great many Timorous People ſign it, that did not approve of it.</p>
            <p>This being the Method, it may eaſily be imagined, the Addreſs was not many days a finiſhing; and ſuch as it was, they ſent it away by four of the Townſmen, whereof the firſt two <note n="a" place="bottom">Robert Scot Deacon of the Taylors, <hi>

            <p>If the Multitude of Addreſſes, which have been boaſted of, as a Declaration of the Averſion of the People to the Union, may be gueſs'd at by this, thoſe Gentlemen, who bring this as an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, have ſmall Reaſon to Boaſt, and need not be very Forward, to have the Particulars Examined into.</p>
            <p>The Addreſs having thus been ſigned, and ſent away, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple begun to be quiet again, and the Tumults ſeemed to have an end; The Provoſt, who had fled to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> came home again, and every one went quietly about their Buſineſs, till, a little while after, a new Occaſion ſet all in a Flame again, worſe than it was before, and made it appear, who was at the Bottom of it all.</p>
            <p>And here the Warm Gentleman, who, from the Pulpit put the Match to this Gun Powder, may ſee who laid the Train;—The Triffle of Addreſſing was the leaſt thing they ſought for, tho that ſerved a purpoſe alſo;—And theſe good People, who were drawn in to begin it, ſaw no farther; but now it appeared to be all <hi>Jacobite</hi> and Papiſt at the Bottom; That Blood and Confuſion was the thing they drove at, and King <hi>James,</hi> Prelacy, Tyranny, Popery, and all the Miſchiefs this Nation has to fear from them, lay hid in the Deſign, as will preſently appear, and the poor Thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Multitude were only Hurryed into it, by a Conjunction of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes.</p>

One of the Magiſtrates <note n="a" place="bottom">It was Baillie <hi>Hamilton.</hi>
               </note> of the City, had committed a <note n="b" place="bottom">The Fellows Name was <hi>Parker,</hi> a Looſe, Vagabond, Profligate Fellow, of a very ill Character, a Spinner of Tobacco by Imployment, but a very Scandalous Perſon.</note> Fellow to the Tolbooth for Theft;—He had, it ſeems, been taken offering to Sale a Muſquet, or ſome other things, which, it was made appear, belonged to the Provoſt of the City, and which was taken out of his Houſe in the time of the Rabble above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
            <p>This Fellow lay in the Tolbooth for ſome time; but it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that, in an Evening, there would be ſeveral of the common People at the Window, talking to him thro' the Grates of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;—The Provoſt apprehending, that the Impriſonment of this Fellow, might be a Pretence for a new Diſturbance, reſolved to diſcharge him; but, that it might not ſeem to be done for Fear, took a <note n="c" place="bottom">This is called there a Bond of Preſentation, and is all one with a ſimple Recognizance without Bail.</note> Bond of him, to appear again, when called for, and, among the reſt of the People, who came to talk with him at the Grate, was one <hi>Finlay,</hi> a looſe ſort of a Fellow, who had formerly been a Sergeant in <hi>Dumbartons</hi> Regiment in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and who openly profeſſed himſelf a <hi>Jacobite,</hi> a Fellow that followed no Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy, but his Mother kept a little <note n="d" place="bottom">The common Name for an Ale Houſe, or Inn, in that Country.</note> Change Houſe at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteſt part of the Town on the <hi>Edinburgh</hi> ſide.</p>
            <p>The Fellow had given his Comrades an Account, that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates had taken a Bond of him; and the next Morning, this <hi>Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay,</hi> and a Rabble with him, comes up to the Clerks Chamber, another Office in the <note n="e" place="bottom">The Town Houſe, in which is their Offices, and alſo the Priſon for the City; It is generally like the Guild Hall of a City, or the Town Houſe in <hi>England,</hi> ſaving that the Priſon is generally in the ſame Houſe in <hi>Scotland.</hi>

            <p>The Magiſtrates willing to take away all Occaſions of Tumult, and to leave them no Excuſe, ordered the Bond to be delivered up, for the Gentlemen Rabble had now the full Command of the Town.</p>
            <p>But to let it be ſeen, that theſe were but ſeeking Occaſions, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Provoſt had told them, they ſhould have the Bond delivered up; and they had now no Reaſon but to be ſatisfied, the Clerk having Orders to deliver it; They continued together, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to Inſult the Provoſt, at his coming out.</p>
            <p>The Provoſt not imagining any Danger, having granted their Requeſt, comes innocently out of the Tolbooth, and went toward his own Houſe; The Rabble immediatly gathered about him,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0554400100:275"/>
Thruſting and Abuſing him, and not with Villainous Language only, but with Stones and Dirt, and ſuch like thrown at him.</p>
            <p>He would have made to his own Houſe, but the Multitude increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and growing Furious, he took Sanctuary in a Houſe, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning up a Stair Caſe, loſt the Rabble for ſome time, they purſuing him into a wrong Houſe; However, they ſearched every Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Top of the Stair, and came into the very Room where he was; But the ſame Hand that ſmote the Men of <hi>Sodom</hi> with Blindneſs, when they would have Rabbled the Angels, protected him from this many Headed Monſter, and ſo Blinded them, that they could not find him: It is the Opinion of many of the Sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt Judicious of the Citizens, that, if they had found him, their Fury was, at that time, ſo paſt all Government, that they would have Murdered him, and that in a manner Barbarous enough; and if they had, as we ſay of a Bull Dog, once but Taſted Blood, who knows where they would have ended?</p>
            <p>The Provoſt was hid in a Bed, which folded up againſt the Wall, and which they never thought of taking down;—Having eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this eminent Danger, he was conveyed out of Town the next day by his Friends, and went for the ſecond time to <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Rabble was now fully Maſter of the Town, they ranged the Streets, and did what they pleaſed; No Magiſtrate durſt ſhow his Face to them, they challenged People as they walk'd the Streets with this Queſtion, <hi>Are you for the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion?</hi> And no Man durſt owne it, but at their extremeſt Hazard.</p>
            <p>The next thing they did, was to ſearch for Arms in all the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of thoſe, that had appeared for the Union; And firſt they went to the Dean of Guild, and, upon his refuſing to give them his Arms, they took them away by Force; They ſtopt here a little, but having given out, that they would ſearch the Houſes of all that were for the Union, the Magiſtrates Aſſembled, and Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that, if the Citizens were Diſarmed, and the Rabble poſſeſt of their Weapons, they might, in the next place, poſſeſs their Houſes, Wives and Wealth, at their Command; and that it was better to Defend themſelves now, than be Murdered and Plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in cold Blood; They reſolved therefore to raiſe ſome Strength, to oppoſe this Violence, and accordingly ordered the Town Guards to be doubled that Night, and removed the place of Arms from the uſual Guard Houſe to the Tolbooth;—And that this Guard ſhould be of Select Perſons, ſuch as they knew.</p>
            <p>Accordingly Orders were ſent to all the Captains of the City Militia, that each of them ſhould bring twelve Men with them, ſuch as, they could depend upon, would ſtand by them, to ſecure the Peace of the City; and this was beſides the ordinary Guard.</p>
            <p>This was done readily, and with great Secrecy and Celerity, the Captains of the Militia being Faithful Honeſt Gentlemen, brought their Men without any Noiſe, Beat of Drum, or the like, and leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>When he came to the Top of the Stair, the Centinel challeng'd him, and thruſt him back; but he comes on again, and thruſts in with the Centinel, and gets by him.</p>
            <p>At this Juncture, one of the Citizens, who was privately appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to meet as above, was juſt coming up; and having paſs'd as privately as he could thro' the Mob, who were at the Stair Foot to the Number of about 100, being a Select Party only, for the reſt were not then got together, was going up the Stairs; This Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſeeing a Fellow aſſault the Centinel, boldly ſtept up to him, and knockt him down on the Stair Head with the Butt End of his Muſquet, and immediately calls the Guard.</p>
            <p>The Guard immediately took to their Arms, and headed by one Lieutenant <hi>Lindſay</hi> an old Soldier of King <hi>William</hi>'s, but now a Burgeſs and Inhabitant of the City, they came down and drew up at the Foot of the Stair.</p>
            <p>Some Pieces were Fired in the Street, but whether at the Guard or no, was not known; The Multitude was great by this Time, and being late at Night, it could not well be diſcern'd: But as they had all the Reaſon in the World to expect it, they fell reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to Work with them, and Sallying upon the Rabble, they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately fled and diſpers'd.</p>
            <p>Having thus broke the firſt Body of them, it was obſerv'd, that they only fled from the immediate Shock, but ſtood in Throngs under the <note n="d" place="bottom">The new Buildings at the Croſs have ſmall Piazzas of Stone on both Sides, under which the Shops are, and the People may walk in wet Weather.</note> Piazzas, and in the Heads of Cloſſes <note n="e" place="bottom">Cloſſes are the ſame with By-Lanes or Alleys.</note>, to ſee what the Guard would do; and that, with one Hallow, they could all be together again in a Moment, whereupon a Party was ordered down <note n="f" place="bottom">There are but four principal Streets which all meet at the Croſs, and lead to the four Gates of the City.</note> every Street to clear the Piazzas and Cloſſes, and ſee

            <p>Had they been able to have renew'd this Guard, the Publick Peace had been maintain'd, and the whole Deſign of this Rabble diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed: But it is to be noted, theſe Gentlemen were all Citizens, Heads of Families, and of the principal Inhabitants; The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty was univerſally debauch'd, and not to be truſted, and the Gentlemen could not do Duty every Night, neither had all that were Zealous enough againſt the Tumults, either Bodies to bear the Fatigue of Soldiers, or Hearts to adventure; and thoſe that were Forwardeſt, could not be always in Arms:—This firſt Piece of Work was on <hi>Saturday</hi> Night, the next Night they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd the Guard by the like Select Number, and all was quiet; for, while theſe Men appear'd, the Rabble durſt not ſtir.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Monday,</hi> the Magiſtrates Summoned the Town Council, and, ſending for the Deacons of the Tradeſmen, the thing propoſed was, What Courſe ſhould be taken to ſecure the Peace of the City, and keep the Magiſtrates and Inhabitants from Plunder and Inſult.</p>
            <p>The Deacons of Trades, ſubtilly, and as appear'd, deſignedly, at leaſt ſuch of them as were in the Deſign, propoſed, That this Select Guard ſhould be omitted, and pretended to promiſe, That, if any Tumult happened, they would come to the Town Guard with their Men to defend the City; which, whoever obſerves how well they performed, will think it no Breach of Charity, to ſay they never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned it:—However, for this Week, there was no more Tumult, but the Mob reign'd Maſters, and <hi>Finlay,</hi> who now had made himſelf one of their Leaders, ſet up a Guard at the Upper End of the Town near the Cathedral, as it were in Oppoſition to the Town Guard.</p>
            <p>This whole Week was ſpent in Amuſements, and raiſing Reports of the Riſing of the People at <hi>Stirling,</hi> at <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and in <hi>Angus;</hi> and that a great Army of them was to Rendezvous at <hi>Hamilton,</hi> from whence they were to March to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to raiſe the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: <hi>Finlay</hi> gives out, That he will March with all the Men of <hi>Glaſgow</hi> to meet their Brethren at <hi>Hamilton</hi> on the ſame Deſign;—by whoſe Aſſiſtance all this was done, the Government was too Merciful to make a narrow Enquiry, and ſo I muſt leave it as they did in the dark: Having brought the Folly and Madneſs of the poor People to ſuch a Height, <hi>Finlay</hi> actually gets together about 45 Men, or that was the moſt of the great Army he raiſed; and on the <hi>Friday</hi> following, this Contemptible Wretch having made himſelf their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, Marches out of the City with them for <hi>Hamilton;</hi> they were Armed with Muſquets and Swords, ſuch as they had taken out of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates Houſes; and (wherever he procur'd it, for every one knows he had it not of his own) he Diſtributed to every Man a Dollar;—And thus in Arms againſt their Native Country, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, theſe poor Deluded People March'd away, under the Command of an Abject Scondrel Wretch, that openly profeſs'd
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0554400100:278"/>
himſelf a <hi>Jacobite,</hi> and that, with his Good Will, would have ſeen all the Presbyterians in <hi>Scotland</hi> ruin'd.</p>
            <p>But to ſuch a Paſs were Things now come, and who can Account for ſome Critical Junctures, in which Men may be brought to ruine themſelves with their own Hands, and never ſuffer themſelves to liſten to the Cautions of their Friends.</p>
            <p>The Town, tho' rid of <hi>Finlay</hi> and his Vanguard, enjoy'd not the more Peace, or were in leſs Danger, for the Mob that remain'd kept up their Guard, threaten'd yet worſe things than had been done, and were afterward as good as their Words to a Title.</p>
            <p>The Government, it may be ſuppoſed, were conſtantly acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with thoſe things, and their Forbearance had not a little hearten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up the Party that puſh'd theſe Miſchiefs on; However, being loth to come to Extremities, they tryed Gentler Methods firſt, and the Lord High Commiſſioner having laid it before the Parliament, they immediately paſs'd an Act, Diſcharging the Muſtering of Troops in the Country during this Seſſion, and a Proclamation was publiſhed againſt Tumults, and both theſe were ſent to <hi>Glaſgow</hi> to be publiſhed.</p>
            <p>It ſhould be noted here, That, by the Act of Security, any of the Nobility, Gentry, or Towns, might meet in Arms, Muſter and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe their Fencible Men, and the like, upon any Occaſion of which they were Judges; which was done in order to make the Militia of <hi>Scotland</hi> more Serviceable, or as ſome think <hi>in Terrorem</hi> to Serve a Cauſe; but be that as it will, it may remain undetermined; but, at this Juncture, the Parliament foreſaw, it might be a Handle for the drawing together any Number of Men at ſuch a Time as this, and might be dangerous to the Peace, wherefore they cauſed an Act to be brought in to Repeal that part of the Act of Security, for ſo long only as the preſent Parliament was ſitting.</p>
            <p>When this Act of Parliament and Proclamation came to Town, which was on the <hi>Monday</hi> after <hi>Finlay</hi>'s March, the Magiſtrates aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled about ten in the Morning, and cauſed the Meſſenger that brought it to read it at the Croſs; Accordingly the Meſſenger goes up to the <note n="(a)" place="bottom">The Head of the Stone Stair on the Out-ſide of the Tolbooth juſt fronting the Croſs, the ſame mentioned before where the Centinel ſtood.</note> uſual place, and read firſt the Act of Parliament, the Magiſtrates were below, and the Officers attending as uſual, and a vaſt Multitude of People were got together to hear what it was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Officer had done, the People began to make a Noiſe, and throw Stones at him; but however, the Man went on, and read out the Act, and began the Proclamation againſt Tumults; but he had hardly read the Title of the Proclamation, when the Stones came ſo thick, there was no ſtanding it, and the poor Fellow not a little Bruiſed was driven off the Stair.</p>
            <p>Upon this the Magiſtrates ordered one of the Town Officers to go up and Read, which he did as far as he could, but was in like manner
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0554400100:279"/>
driven off by the Fury of the Stoning: In the <hi>Interim</hi> of this, the Magiſtrates had ſent for the Town Guard to protect the ſecond Officer in Reading; The Officer of the Guard ſeeing the other Officer abuſed thus before their Faces, commands his Men to fall upon the Rabble with the Clubs of their Muſquets, which they did, and knockt down ſome of them; but the Tradeſmen that were upon the Guard, in the very Action deſerted, and refuſed to obey the Command of their Officers, which ſo encouraged the Rabble, that they came on again with Shouts and Huzza's, and with Volleys of Stones they fell upon the few of the Guard that were Faithful, and drove them off from the Street.</p>
            <p>The Officer that commanded them Retreated them into the Guard Houſe, but this was not a place to be defended againſt ſuch a Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, ſo in ſhort they broke in upon them and diſarm'd them, and well it was they came off without Blood,—ſome of them were very much Bruiſed with Stones.</p>
            <p>The Rabble now fluſht with Victory, were in a terrible Fury, and this was the moſt Outragious Part of the whole Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaction; having diſarm'd the Guard, the next thing was to Storm the Tolbooth, immediately they get Ladders to the Windows, and breaking in, they ſeize upon 250 Halberts which are the Towns Arms; with theſe upon their Shoulders in Rank and File they Rov'd about the Streets, and made their Rendezvous at the Old Caſtle where their Guard was kept; Here they gave out, That, in the Afternoon, they would come down and Plunder the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants Houſes, nay, and threatened their Lives too, which put the whole City in an Unſpeakable Conſternation.</p>
            <p>Nor were they wanting in ſome part of their Threatened Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for about three in the Afternoon they Detach'd a Party of about twenty Men Arm'd, ſome with Muſquets, ſome with Halberts, theſe, with a Drum before them, came to the Croſs, and from thence took their March down the High Streets, breaking open the Doors and Houſes of who ever they pleaſed, pretending to ſearch for Arms, but Stole and Plundered whatever came in their way, and thus they continued till ten a Clock at Night.</p>
            <p>They got not above thirty Muſquets, with ſome Piſtols and Swords, but the Terror of the Inhabitants is not to be expreſs'd, who were oblig'd to bear this Violence without Complaint; This ſmall Party was follow'd by a vaſt Throng of Boys and Idle Fellows like themſelves, which encreaſed the Fright of the Citizens.—</p>
            <p>Having thus Ranged the City at Pleaſure till about ten a Clock at Night, they March'd away with the Spoil of their Maſters up to their Main Guard, from thence they Beat their Tatoo round the Town like a Gariſon; and indeed they were no leſs, for they had the City in their full Poſſeſſion, and every Bodies Life and Goods at their Mercy.</p>
            <p>Their Rudeneſs in this pretended Search for Arms is not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, and had they met with any Oppoſition, no doubt it would have been worſe; They came into the Rooms where Perſons that lay Sick were juſt Dying, and put all things into inexpreſſible Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0554400100:280"/>
They came into Chambers, where Women were Lying in, and Barbarouſly made them Riſe, pretending to Search under their Beds for Arms: In ſhort, except that there was no Blood ſhed, they acted the exact part of an Enraged Ungoverned Multitude.</p>
            <p>But, to return to their Army of Fourty Five, which was all this while on its March; And were advanc'd as far as <hi>Kilſyth,</hi> on their Way to <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Government, who had an exact Account of all theſe things, and who had tryed all the Gentle Methods of Proclamations, Acts of Parliament, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Finding to what Height Things were brought, and that nothing but Force could Remedy Them, prepar'd to be before-hand with theſe Forward Gentlemen; And having an Account both of their March and Number, The Lord Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ordered a Detachment of Dragoons, joyn'd with ſome Horſe Granadeers of the Guard, under the Command of Colonel <hi>Campbell,</hi> Uncle to the Duke of <hi>Argyll,</hi> to March with all Expedition for <hi>Glaſgow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finlay,</hi> in the mean time being at <hi>Kilſyth,</hi> has Notice of the March of theſe Dragoons, within a few Hours after his Arrival there; And hearing no News of the great Parties of 5 and 6000, which he had perſwaded his Men would meet him there; And being alarm'd at the News of the Dragoons he ſends back—<hi>Campbell,</hi> another of the Ring-Leaders of his Rabble, to bring up the ſecond Body which was to be ready to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and which were Reported to be 400, <hi>but they Thank'd him, and Stay'd at Home;</hi> And with the reſt he March'd to <hi>Hamilton,</hi> where he Arriv'd on <hi>Sunday</hi> about Noon, the third day after his March from <hi>Glaſgow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here he Quartered his Army that Night, and finding, as before, none of the Friends that were to Aſſemble from all Parts, nor no News of them, he beſtow'd a Volley of Curſes upon them, and Marches directly back to <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> where he Arriv'd, to the no ſmall Mortification of his Fellows, on <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> the next day but one after the Plunderings I have related before; They had Halted at <hi>Rugland,</hi> a Burgh about two Miles from <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> where, as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, they called a Council of War among themſelves; but, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Voters, they Agreed upon nothing, but to March Home, which accordingly they did; and, in Order of Battel, enter'd the City, and March'd directly up to their Main Guard aforeſaid: Here they made, <hi>ſays my Author,</hi> their Rendezvous, having not thought fit to keep the Field any longer.</p>
            <p>And now they began to think a little, for I cannot allow my ſelf to ſay they had done it before; Their Danger began now to ſhow it ſelf, and to ſtare in their Faces a little; They began to conſider what they had been doing with others, and what was now like to be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them; They had no more Protection from the Act about Muſtering, and the proclamation began to work with them; And now they did the only Rational Act of their whole Management, and which indeed ſaved all their Lives.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:0554400100:281"/>
On <hi>Thurſday</hi> Morning, having maturely weighed their Affairs, they reſolved to ſeparate, and lay down their Arms, which accordingly they did very quietly and calmly, and carryed their Arms, not to the Magiſtrates, where they had them, but to the Deacons of their Trades, who they knew were their Friends.</p>
            <p>How it came to paſs, That Providence, whom they had ſo far provoked, Inſpir'd them with this Prudence, ſo ſeaſonably for their own Safety, none, but that Infinite Goodneſs, that puniſhes leſs than Crimes deſerve, can ſay; 'Tis moſt certain, they had no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Intelligence of the March of the Queens Troops, for the City it ſelf knew nothing of them more than in general; But it was not full two Hours after they had ſeparated, delivered their Arms, and all was quiet, but the Dragoons enter'd the Town, not a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, nor an Inhabitant knew of them, till they ſaw them upon the Street, to their no ſmall Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>The whole Party was about 220 Men; They had march'd with great Secrecy all Night, and ſuffered no Body to paſs by them, to carry Notice before of their Coming—; When they came near the City, Colonel <hi>Campbell</hi> detach'd an Advanc'd Party of twenty five Dragoons, under the Command of Lieutenant <hi>Pollock</hi> who knew the Town, and knew where <hi>Finlay</hi> liv'd, the whole Body following at a ſmall Diſtance.</p>
            <p>The Lieutenant entering the Town, ſtopt, and Allighted juſt at <hi>Finlay</hi>'s Door, and ruſhing immediately in with two or three Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons, they find <hi>Finlay</hi> and one <hi>Montgomery,</hi> another of the Knot, but Famous for nothing that ever I heard of, but his being taken with him, ſitting by the Fire; They ſeiz'd them immediately, and by this time the whole Body was entered the City, March'd down to the Croſs, and Drew up there on the Street, where they ſate ſtill upon their Horſes, it Raining very hard all the time, which was about three Hours.</p>
            <p>The Mob of the City were in no ſmall Conſternation, as may well be ſuppoſed, at this Appearance; And ſeveral, whoſe Guilt gave them Ground to think of the Gallows, made the beſt of their way out of the Town; There was no Appearance of any Reſcue, and the Dragoons Commanded the People off of the Street, and to keep their Houſes—; Two Fellows had the Boldneſs to Beat a Drum in two ſeveral parts of the City, but the Gentlemen they call'd for, had more Wit than to come, and the Drummers, with very much Difficulty, narrowly eſcap'd being killed.</p>
            <p>The Dragoons having ſecur'd their Priſoners, and mounted them on Horſe-back, with their Legs tyed under the Horſes Bellys; Never ſo much as Allighted or Baited their Horſes, but Marched away the ſame Afternoon to <hi>Kilſyth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As they were going away, they had ſome Stones Thrown at them from the Tops of Houſes, and ſome that were ſtragling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind had like to have been Knock'd off of their Horſes, but Six or Seven Dragoons coming back, they were ſetched off without Hurt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:0554400100:282"/>
No ſooner were they gone out of the Town, but the Drums beat again in all the Streets, and the Rable got together with all the Rage and Venome imaginable, and coming to the Magiſtrates, they told them in ſo many words, that they ſhould ſend ſome of their Number to <hi>Edinburgh</hi> immediately, for that if they had not their two Men delivered to them, they would pull their Houſes down about their Ears. Some have blam'd the Magiſtrates for ſending to <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> But if ſuch would conſider Circumſtances, how the Dragoons were gone, they had an Enrag'd Mob to deal with, and no ſtrength to Defend themſelves, it can not but be thought the Gentlemen were in the right to comply with the Juncture of the Time, and Gratifie rather than Exaſperate them, when they were abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely in their Power.</p>
            <p>The Magiſtrates, however, according to the Command of their Maſters the Mobb, (for ſuch at this time they were,) ſent away two of the Baillies of the Town, and ſome of the Deacons of Trades went with them, but they ſoon came back again as wiſe as they went, having received a ſevere Check from the Council by the Mouth of the Lord Chancellor; and it was once within a little of their being committed to Priſon with the other.</p>
            <p>Thus ended, this petty War, being the only Violence we meet with in the whole Tranſaction. I had not been ſo large in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of ſo triffling an Affair, but that it ſerves to clear up ſeveral other Caſes to the World, which otherwiſe there are ſeveral Miſtakes about.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And principally indeed for the ſake of the City of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> a City which in all Ages ſince the Reformation, and in the very Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation it ſelf, has been particularly Famous for Honeſty, Zeal, and Bravery in a conſtant Oppoſition to the Enemies either of the Religion or Liberties of their Countrey—, a City Eminent for the True and Sincere Profeſſion of the Reformed Religion, and forward upon all Occaſions to ſpend their Blood and Treaſure in Defence of it: And as nothing can be more Untrue than to ſuggeſt, this Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult was the Act and Deed of the City of <hi>Glaſgow:</hi> So to clear her of that Scandal, I thought my ſelf oblig'd to do her Juſtice, by ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Caſe in its true Light; nothing clears up the Innocence of a Perſon or Party like bare matter of Fact, and therefore I have Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially related this Story juſt as I receiv'd it upon the Spot from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the principal Inhabitants of the City, whoſe Integrity in the Relation I have no Reaſon to queſtion.</p>
            <p>Nothing is more certain, than that the Tumult at <hi>Glaſgow</hi> had its Riſe and Beginning among the <hi>Jacobite</hi> Party: In all the Rabble and Riots, they were ſecured as they paſt the Streets, they were Carreſt by the Mob, they Huzza'd them to the Work, their Houſes were never ſearch'd for Arms, nor the leaſt Inſult offered to their Perſons; The very Leaders of the Rabble were of their Party, and indeed their Friends mixt themſelves with the Rabbles on all Occaſions, to prompt them to Inſult the Citizens.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:0554400100:283"/>
The Rabblers themſelves on the other hand were a ſort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ignorantly Inflam'd by this Party, and unhappily ſet on Fire by an Accident which had its beginning rather in an Ignorance of the Plot of that Party, than Deſign to ſerve them in it.</p>
            <p>But for the City of <hi>Glaſgow</hi> it is clear, not a Citizen of any Note, not a Magiſtrate, not a Merchant, not any thing that can be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Denominating to a Place, but what Abhorr'd it, and as far as they durſt Oppoſed it; and I think 'tis hard they ſhould firſt fall under the Misfortune, and then under the Scandal of it too; And for that Reaſon I have been thus particular in the Story.</p>
            <p>Again, here may be ſeen a ſmall Scetch of the Petitioners and Addreſſers againſt the Union, &amp; of their Original, who they are that were moved, and who moved them; not a Papiſt, not a Jacobite, not a Prelatiſt in <hi>Scotland</hi> but what Declar'd themſelves againſt the Union; and thoſe honeſt Men that unhappily Approve them in that, may ſee what Bleſſed Company they were yoked with, which is a Hint I cannot avoid leaving upon Record for their Inſtruction.</p>
            <p>I ſhould have told you that the <hi>Sunday</hi> after being the 15<hi>th</hi> of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi> the Dragoons returned to <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> and in ſtead of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the two Priſoners they had taken, carried away three more, and had Directions for others, but it ſeems they were fled.</p>
            <p>They went to <hi>Hamilton</hi> alſo, and ſeiz'd two Gentlemen &amp; a Lady, who belong'd to the Dutcheſs—, and who, they ſaid, <hi>Finlay</hi> Accuſed, but both theſe, and all the reſt, were, after the Union was finiſhed, Diſcharged without Puniſhment; the Merciful Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Her Majeſty rather delighting to Pity, than to Puniſh the Follies of the poor deluded people; ſhewing them the Difference between the legally Eſtabliſh'd Power, which they blindly Oppoſed, and the paſt Implacable and Mercileſs Tyrrany, which they as blindly Eſpouſed.</p>
            <p>And thus happily Ended the Tumult at <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> which put the Honeſt People of both Nations in no ſmall Apprehenſions; and which, if the Party had obtain'd their Deſign, in getting the poor People into Arms in other Places, might have been Fatal enough.</p>
            <p>Mean time, the Queen was not Unconcerned at theſe Diſorders, and Troops were ſent from <hi>England</hi> to the Borders, to be ready to Aſſiſt the <hi>Scots</hi> Forces, and to ſupport the Government, if there had been Occaſion; having Orders given them to Quarter in the moſt Northerly Towns of <hi>England,</hi> and to take their farther Orders from the Lord High Commiſſioner of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as there ſhould be Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. But the Succeſs of Things beginning to change a little after theſe Hurreys, there was no Occaſion for them.</p>
            <p>The Parliament was now entered upon the cloſs Debate of the Articles, and the firſt and chief Points being paſt in the Houſe, it was plain to every body, that the Houſe was reſolved to go thorow the Work; And it is no wonder if the laſt Struggles of all the Parties Oppoſing it, were now ſeen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:0554400100:284" rendition="simple:additions"/>
All the Attempts to raiſe Tumults, and to Rabble the Parliament out of it, had proved Abortive; And it was found impoſſible to bring the Common People into any thing Extraordinary, while few or none of the Gentry thought fit to appear with them; All that had hitherto been done, was, by an underhand kind of Management of the <hi>Jacobite</hi> Party, <hi>as they called them,</hi> to ſee, if poſſible, they could puſh the Presbyterians, or the meer Rabble of the Common People upon making ſome Diſturbance, that ſo they might pull down their Enemies, by the Hands of one another, and ſee their Work done for them; This was apparent from the manner of Proceedings, which was by dropping Papers, and ſending about private Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages from no particular Perſon, but as from their Brethren in this or that Shire, Inviting, Directing, and Encouraging the People to Meet and Aſſemble, to furniſh themſelves with Arms and Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, and Nameing Place and Day where to Meet and Aſſemble, in order to March to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and to Raiſe the Parliament, and prevent the Ruine, <hi>ſuch they then called the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and their being given up to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They took all theſe Courſes to Raiſe and Excite the People, but ſtill they found it Ineffectual as to Meetings and Rendezvouzes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept as you have ſeen; however, the Parliament took ſome notice of it, the Lord Commiſſioner laid it before them on the 29 <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi> and they immediately cauſed a Proclamation to be publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to prevent Tumultary and Irregular Convocations of the Liedges; This was the ſame which was Read in <hi>Glaſgow</hi> at the Time of the Tumult, as aforeſaid, when the People Stoned the Meſſenger that Read it, off from the Head of the Stairs of the Town Hall or Tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>booth.</p>
            <p>It had been conſidered, that there was a Clauſe in the Act of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, which Impowered the People to Meet, or Conveen in Arms, under pretence of Exerciſing the Fencible Men—; The Clauſe was as follows.<q>And for a further Security to this Realm, Her Majesty with Advice and Conſent aforeſaid, Statutes and Enacts, That the whole Proteſtant Heretors, and all the Burghs within the ſame, ſhall forthwith provide themſelves with Fire Arms for all the fencible Men who are Proteſtants within their reſpective Bounds, and thoſe of the Bore proportioned to a Bullet of 14 Drop weight running; And the ſaid Heretors and Burghs are hereby Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered and Ordained to Diſcipline and Exerciſe their fencible Men, once in the Month at leaſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now the firſt Rumours of Country Tumults had been pretended to be founded upon this Clauſe, and that under pretence of this Exerciſing and Diſciplining the Fencible Men, any number of Men might appear together in Arms without Breach of the Law—. This was indeed a wide Gap in the publick Peace, at which there was Room for a whole Army to enter. For any of the Gentry, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0554400100:285"/>
or Heretors, who were Diſaffected to the Affair now in hand under the protection of this Clauſe, pretending only Exerciſing and Diſciplining the Fencible Men, might Aſſemble together, and keep together without any Limitation of Number or Time, till they had formed a ſufficient Force, and then March'd, to the Deſtruction of the Government, the Laws, and all the Defences of the publick Peace.</p>
            <p>It was time now to ſtop this Breach, and therefore an Act was paſt in the Houſe, to Repeal the above-ſaid Clauſe, ſo far forth as it extended to the Meeting, Muſtering, and Conveening together of the People during the ſitting of the Parliament; which Act being a very plain Evidence to the Truth of what I am upon, I have Added here, as being not long enough to interrupt the Thread of this Diſcourſe.<q>OUR SOVEREIGN LADY Conſidering, That, by the 3<hi>d</hi> Act of the 2<hi>d</hi> Seſſion of this Parliament, Intituled, <hi>Act for Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the Kingdom,</hi> It is Statute and Enacted, That the whole Proteſtant Heretors, and all the Burghs within the ſame, ſhall furthwith provide themſelves with Fire Arms for all the Fencible Men, who are Proteſtants, within their reſpective Bounds, and the ſaid Heretors and Burghs are thereby Impowered and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to Diſcipline and Exerciſe their Fencible Men once in the Month at leaſt; And alſo Conſidering, That the Diſorderly and Seditious Meetings and Tumults in ſome Places in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, do make it neceſſary, at this Occaſion, to Suſpend the Effect of the foreſaid Clauſe, during this Seſſion of Parliament allen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narly. <hi>Therefore</hi> Her Majeſty, with Advice and Conſent of the Eſtates of Parliament, doth hereby Suſpend the Effect of the foreſaid Clauſe, and that during this Seſſion of Parliament al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennarly. <hi>And further,</hi> Her Majeſty, with Advice and Conſent foreſaid, Diſcharges and ſtrictly Prohibites the Subjects of this Kingdom, to Meet and Aſſemble together in Arms, after the Publication hereof, upon any Pretence whatſoever, during the Space foreſaid, without Her Majeſties ſpecial Command, or expreſs Licence had or obtained thereto. And Requires and Commands all the Subjects of this Kingdom, to Retire to their own Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and Lawful Employments; Certifying ſuch as ſhall do in the contrary That they ſhall be lyable to the Pains of High Treaſon, conform to the Laws and Acts of Parliament made againſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful Convocations and Riſing in Arms.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This was a moſt Effectual Step to Check the Riots and Tumults of the People, for after this, no Man of any Conſideration durſt ſhow himſelf; And finding the Government Reſolved to puniſh whoever ſhould make any Attempt of that Nature, they began to give over the Thought of taking Arms.</p>
            <p>Thus the Affair without Doors ſeem'd to attend the Debates of the Parliament, and all we meet from Abroad, amounted to no
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0554400100:286"/>
more than Addreſſes without Number from the Towns and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys and ſome from the Presbyteries, againſt the Union in the Terms of the Articles, with Diſputes about Amendments to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Articles, as they came before them: The particular Caſes of which will come of Courſe, in the Obſervations on the Minutes of Parliament.—</p>
            <p>Mean time it may be noted, the Parliament enter'd upon the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate of the Articles, Stating the Duties, Settling the Equivalent that was to be paid to <hi>Scotland,</hi> in Conſideration of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Debts, Proportioning the Exciſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Affair of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Debts has been ſuch an Occaſion of Clamour in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that I cannot but think it very neceſſary to give a State of it in ſhort, as it lay before the Parliament.</p>
            <p>The Treaters in <hi>England,</hi> as has been noted in the Obſervations on the Minutes of the Treaty in <hi>London,</hi> had been convinced of the Neceſſity of having the Cuſtoms and Exciſes of <hi>Scotland,</hi> when they came to an Union, run in the ſame Channel with the Exciſes and Cuſtoms in <hi>England;</hi> and this, by Conſequence, engaged them in the ſame Appropriations and Incumberances, that the ſame Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in <hi>England</hi> were lyable to.</p>
            <p>This created an Objection, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Scotland</hi> was under no Incumberance of Debt, at leaſt none that thoſe Duties were appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to; and therefore, to bring her into Taxes <hi>of any ſort,</hi> other than ſuch as were to bear the Burthen of the War, was not conſiſtent with the Equalities of Burthens, which were allowed to be the only Foundation of an Union.</p>
            <p>The Equity of this was not to be withſtood, and therefore the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſſioners readily agreed, there was no Reaſon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould be applyed to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Debt without Conditions—; But as the Circumſtances of the Nations requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an Equality of Taxes, and thoſe Taxes in <hi>Scotland</hi> muſt run in the Channel of the Taxes of the ſame Kinds in <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> muſt pay to <hi>Scotland</hi> an Equivalent in Money: This was ſettled by the Treaty, as in the Minutes appears at large.</p>
            <p>Now the Equivalent being determin'd, the Parliament was for a long while imployed in debating what Taxes, what Cuſtoms, and what Exciſes ſhould be paid by <hi>Scotland</hi>—; It is needleſs to enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the particular Reaſonings on the ſeveral Heads as they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated in the Parliament, ſince the Minutes of the Parliament will particularly diſcuſs thoſe Points, but it may be needful to note a little the Reaſons of all thoſe Diſputes.</p>
            <p>I have often noted, That there was a Party who were buſy, not ſo much in Arguing for Regulating, as Deſtroying the Articles; that Argued againſt the Union in general, not againſt the Articles in particular; Theſe having in vain ſtruggled againſt the main Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Treaty, ſuch as Union in general, Succeſſion, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of Trade, and the like, began now to Labour at the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Heads; and firſt they would have it, that <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould not pay any of the Cuſtoms or Exciſes in Uſe in <hi>England,</hi> but when
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0554400100:287"/>
convinc'd of the Injuſtice of thoſe Pretences, they could no longer object againſt an Equality of Taxes; Then they began new De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates upon the Circumſtances of the ſaid Cuſtoms and Exciſes, and puſh'd at all ſorts of Exemptions, Inequalities of Payments, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions and Latitudes they could imagine, if poſſible to bring on ſome Amendments upon the Articles, which they knew would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex the Union in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament, ſuch were the Liberty of Exporting Wooll, the Exemption from the Duties on Salt for ever, the Reducing their Ale to the Exciſe of Small Beer in <hi>England,</hi> and the like; And this makes it appear, that I have not wronged them, in ſaying, that their Deſign was at the Union in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</p>
            <p>It would be too much to enter upon the Diſcourſe here of the ſeveral Objections againſt the Equivalent, the Taxes, the Exciſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and innumerable Cavils at the ſeveral Duties on Export or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port—. Theſe things occupied the whole Town, and all the People, as their ſeveral Fancies and Informers led them, ſpent the time in Canvaſſing and Diſputing the Articles of Commerce, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> what could be paid, and what not.</p>
            <p>Nor is it to be wondred, that theſe Debates were Warm, for as the proſpect of Tumult began to abate, the People took the more liberty in Speech, and the Government being very backward to Puniſh the Exorbitances of the Tongue, at a Time when they were Inviting all the People to Unite, all the Gall and ill Humour of the Party vented it ſelf at the Mouth. This filled the Countrey with innumerable Railry and Reproach, all Companies were divided; nay, even Families, Relations, and the neareſt in Affection, divided upon this Subject.</p>
            <p>The Scruples of Religion alſo revived now, and a great many finding the Treaty was like to go on, began to ſet up their Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations for Oppoſition, and revive the Scruples of the Union in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiring with the National Covenant, the Danger of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> from the Suffrages of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Biſhops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All theſe things helped to raiſe Heats among the People, and ſome went up to a ſtrange height of Jealouſie and Diſcontent, and what <hi>they could do,</hi> they did; As for Tumults and Rebellions, that time began to be over with them, but Parties and Feuds encreaſed every Day: And ſo they went on till the Parliament went thro' the whole Treaty, and how they behaved then, will follow to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to in its Courſe.</p>

The Party againſt the Union finding the Articles, as they were concluded at <hi>London,</hi> were concealed, or at leaſt not made publick, gave out in <hi>Scotland,</hi> That the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners having had it in their Power to obtain moſt Advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conditions from <hi>England,</hi> but having been brought baſely to ſubmit to the Arbitrary Deſigns of ſome Leading Men im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the Treaty in <hi>England,</hi> they had been very ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial in their Demands, and therefore durſt not publiſh their Proceedings, till the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> met, and then the whole Treaty would be rejected, which would be agreeable to others of the Commiſſioners of both Nations: This groundleſs Opinion being diffuſed, and believed by many of their Party of beſt Senſe, made them eaſie and unactive, till too late they perceived the Queen, Her Miniſters, and all Perſons concerned in Adjuſting that Treaty, to be in earneſt, and then they turn'd the ſame Notion to another Uſe, <hi>viz.</hi> To Calumniate and Reproach the Commiſſioners.</p>
               <p>The Printing the Articles alſo, which the Oppoſers of the Union afterwards boaſted of as their Act and Deed, was introduced againſt their Deſign; For, at the private Meetings of thoſe againſt the Union, the Queſtion was, how to delay the Printing of the Articles, or any thing elſe, whereby to gain Time, till the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> ſhould meet, which was then Prorogued to the twenty third of <hi>October;</hi> So that both Parliaments ſitting together, they expected to confound the Meaſures for carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Treaty by mutual Propoſals, Doubts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this Project of delaying the Printing of the Articles was prevented, for the Articles being preſented and read, after a long Silence in the Houſe, Mr. <hi>Seton</hi> of <hi>Pitmedden</hi> roſe up, and told the Lord Chancellor, That he found himſelf obliged to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Printing the Articles, which had been read in the Houſe, to the end the Curioſity and Judgment of all ſorts of People might be ſatisfied, and that the not Printing might be no Argument, in time coming, for a Delay to the Ratifying of the Treaty. Which Propoſal was reſumed by the Lord Chancellor, and no Member oppoſing or ſeconding it, he looked upon it as Acquieſced to, and Ordered the Articles to be Printed.</p>

to prevent, but as in great Diſtreſs, to fly to their Prayers as Mariners in a Storm—: This they thought would, of Courſe, be made the more Terrible by the Miniſters in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, exciting the People to extraordinary Humiliations, which, <hi>whether ill deſign'd or no,</hi> might be ill enough Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and the People thereby made the more Uneaſy.</p>
               <p>Perhaps alſo they might hope for ſome Indiſcretion and undue Warmth in the Pulpit, eſpecially from ſome Men, which they were willing to think they could influence to ſo much Weakneſs, but in this alſo they were diſappointed.</p>
               <p>For the ſame Reaſons, thoſe Gentlemen who were of the moſt Religious Converſation, and known to be well Affected to the Church, and to any thing that had but an Aſpect of ſincere Piety, were nevertheleſs againſt this Faſt, as Unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and Dangerous, and as a thing they foreſaw was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd particularly to make the People Uneaſy with theſe Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects; The Debate was urged warmly enough on both ſides, but at laſt was Adjourn'd; and ſo the deſigned Faſt was put off for the preſent, tho' it was afterwards introduced piece meal, and all the uſe made of it that could be to raiſe the Spirits of the People, if poſſible, to the Diſorders aimed at, as we ſhall ſee in the Sequel of this Hiſtory.</p>

               <p>Here, the Gentlemen who appeared againſt the Union, finding they could not carry the Point, as Debated the laſt Day, Moved for a Delay of but Eight Days; and ſeveral Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments were offered, to obtain ſo ſhort a Delay.</p>
               <p>But in this, they loſt ſeveral of thoſe who Voted with them before, and who ſeeing the Vote of Conſulting Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuents Rejected, could not be convinced of the Advantage of eight days Delay; and this made it ſeem more particularly a Deſign only to Delay.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the Queſtion being put, it was carried by a great Majority; And this was the firſt Tryal of the Strength of the Parties, and the firſt encouraging Proof that the Union would go on: The Majority on this Vote was ſixty four, but the Names having not yet been Ordered to be made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, it was not known who were on one ſide or the other.</p>
               <p>Before this Vote was put, it was alſo Debated, whether this Reading of the Articles, ſhould be in order to proceed upon them to a Vote. And here again the Gentlemen had their Turn of Advantage, nor was there any great Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for thoſe who were for the Union; were yet willing to have it fully Debated, and all things for its better Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion underſtood; and were content to have it as thorowly Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined as they pleaſed, and therefore gave their Votes freely for a general Reading.</p>
               <p>The other Gentlemen who were only puſhing at Delays, and ſtriving to gain Time, thought they gain'd a great Point in this, and therefore with all their Intereſt they puſh'd at a general Reading only, which was preſently agreed to, <hi>viz. That the Articles ſhould be Read and</hi> Diſcourſed <hi>of in this Parliament; but that none of them ſhould be Voted, till all was Read over and Conſidered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the above Debate, and concluding only to Read and Diſcourſe, the firſt Article of the Treaty was Read publickly, but the Reading of the Commiſſions and Minutes, taking up a great deal of Time, there was not much Diſcourſe in the Houſe at that time, for the great Affair now in Agitation, was to ſtir up the People without Doors, and bring them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Clamour, Tumult, or Tumultuous Addreſſes, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare a general Diſlike both of the Union in General, and of the Articles in Particular; And at this time they began to Threaten from without Doors.</p>
               <p>The Streets and Doors were exceedingly Throug'd this Day in expectation of the Event, the People expecting igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly to hear whether the firſt Article was Voted and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, or Rejected; and when ſome Body came out and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0554400100:295"/>
ſaid Unwarrily the firſt Article was not Voted, it run thro' the Town, that it was Rejected; And the Mob, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared now to be Managed by ſome Gentlemen, began to Shout, and People apprehended the Union had been Voted againſt in the General, but they were Diſcovered too ſoon by this, and it was preſently underſtood, that the Article was only Diſcourſed of and the Diſcourſe Adjourned too.</p>
               <p>The next day the Minutes being Printed, the Minds of the People were a little Cool'd, when they ſaw the Houſe went on ſo deliberately, and that nothing was to be Voted, while all the Articles were Read over and Conſidered.</p>

               <p>The Commiſſion of the General Aſſembly having ſate from the 9<hi>th</hi> Inſtant, had been in ſeveral warm Debates about the Matter, in what manner they ſhould behave themſelves in this Juncture: Some Hot Gentlemen had given them Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0554400100:296"/>
enough about the Matter of the Faſt, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Doors it was Reported, they would Proteſt againſt the Union.</p>
               <p>But the Generality being Governed by more Temper and Moderation than ſome People hoped for, all things went on there peaceably, <hi>I mean,</hi> as to their publick Reſolutions; And the Addreſs to the Parliament was conceived in as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Terms as could be expected, and is at large Printed in the <hi>Appendix, N. B*.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Anſwer to it was alſo ſatisfactory enough—, in that they declared, they would go upon the Addreſs, before any thing was concluded; It was however warmly preſſed in the Parliament, That the ſaid Addreſs ſhould be immediately entered upon, before they went on upon the Union—; But this, as another Advantage deſign'd for Delay, was check'd, and the Anſwer in the Minute agreed upon.</p>
               <p>Great Pains was taken alſo at this time, to make the Commiſſion of the Aſſembly uneaſy at this Anſwer, as not ſatisfactory; Jealouſies were fomented, and Suggeſtions whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered about from one to another, as if the Parliament de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to poſtpone the Affairs of the Church to the laſt, and ſo perhaps drop them at once: This obtained but too much, and being put forward by warm and uneaſy People, grew higher and higher, and help'd on the Inflammations which unhappily follow'd.</p>
               <p>The ſubject of the Firſt Article, tho' not Named in the Minutes was alſo re-aſſumed in the Diſcourſes of this Day, and ſeveral Arguments againſt the Union it ſelf, as an Incorporating Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, were brought, in order to prove it Impracticable, Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, and Diſadvantageous to <hi>Scotland;</hi> And therefore, that they ought rather to proceed upon the Conſideration of the general, before they went on to the particular Articles.</p>
               <p>This however was only Diſcourſed, and the Reading the ſeveral Articles having been already Approven, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the Reading the reſt of the Articles, as in the Minutes.</p>
               <p>In the Reading the Second Article, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Act of Parliament for Limiting the Succeſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was Diſcourſed on, and much was ſaid about the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Limitations; and ſome People that had been of another Mind formerly, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to diſcover an Inclination of coming into the Succeſſion with Limitations, and began to enter into the Matter of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations; But this being remote to the Work was dropt for the preſent, and we ſhall meet with it again in its place.</p>
               <p>The Third Article alſo relating to Uniting the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of both Kingdoms was Read, and ſome took the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to Jeſt with it as a Chytherical Calculation, and that they had no Power to Alter the Repreſentative of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that <hi>Scotland</hi> could not Conſent to be Govern'd by any
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0554400100:297"/>
other Repreſentative, than they were now; And that, if the Parliaments were to be made one, <hi>Scotlands</hi> whole Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ought to be joyned to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament, and that <hi>Scotland</hi> ought no more to Abridge her Repreſentative than <hi>England,</hi> and the like.</p>
               <p>But the Unreaſonableneſs of this was urged from the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity, in Extent of the Country, Number of People, and Proportion of Taxes, of which hereafter.</p>
               <p>The Five Enſuing Articles being all upon Privileges of Trade, Exciſes and Cuſtoms, the Diſcourſes were very gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral on both ſides, and thoſe things ſeem'd referr'd to more Debates afterwards: All that was ſaid of thoſe things now, ſeem'd rather to tend, if poſſible, to perſwade the People in general, that the Union was Impracticable, that <hi>Scotland</hi> could not come into the Taxes, and that the Equalities talk'd of, would ruine their Trade and ſtarve their Poor.</p>
               <p>Without Doors, ſtrange Uſe was made of theſe Articles of Taxes, and the People were made to believe, their Salt, their Malt, their Beer, their Fiſh, would all be Loaded with Inſupportable Taxes, and their whole Trade ſhould be ruin'd, their Houſes plunder'd for Taxes, and their People ſtarv'd; And no Man that ſhall ſee, with what Frightful Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the poor People were poſſeſt, will any more wonder, they were ſo eaſily brought into Tumults and Diſorders—.</p>
               <p>Nota, <hi>This Day there were ſtrong Rumours about the Town, of the Mob coming up to the Parliament, to demand, That the Crown and Scepter of</hi> Scotland <hi>ſhould not be given up, and carryed away to</hi> England.</p>
               <p>This was the Effect of ſome Popular Speeches let fall by thoſe Gentlemen who oppoſed the Treaty, and induſtriouſly ſpread about the Town a Report, That the Sovereignty of <hi>Scotland</hi> was to be Subjected to the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> And the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Sort that underſtood leſs, had the ſame Thing in other Words, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Crown of <hi>Scotland</hi> was Betray'd; That it was to be carryed to <hi>England,</hi> and never to be ſeen here more. Of which ſee at large in its place.</p>
               <p>The Houſe, however, took no Notice of this yet, as being a Rumour only, tho' the Members were not without Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, That it might riſe to a greater Height; And that they might come to be Inſulted, even in the Houſe, as indeed was afterwards very probable.</p>

               <p>The Calculations of the Ninth Article were a little Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, but appeared ſo juſt, and the Equalities ſo well Stat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That there was no Room to object; For the Ceſs being but the ſame upon <hi>Scotland</hi> as before, there could nothing be ſaid, why they ſhould not go into Meaſures for carrying on any joynt Expence, which, in Time to come, the United Body ſhould ſee Cauſe to put the Whole to.</p>
               <p>And this was the firſt Viſible Explication of the Doctrine of Equalities, and a Proof that Equalities conſiſted in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions, <hi>of which more hereafter:</hi> Some People, to ſerve the Deſigns now on Foot, had made the Ignorant People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, That, by Equalities, would be underſtood a Numerical Equality, and that <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould pay in every Thing juſt as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> did—; This did therefore a little ſerve to open the Eyes of Conſidering People and let them ſee, that the Treaty had been founded upon ſomething of Juſtice; For, by this time, it had been Repreſented as a Strange many-Headed Monſter, that had nothing but Mouths and Teeth, and Unfathomable Gulphs to Devour and Deſtroy the People.</p>
               <p>The Five Articles between the Ninth and Fifteenth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd little Debate, ſince they conſiſted only of Negatives, and Proviſion made for <hi>Scotland</hi> againſt payment of any of the Duties then Levyed in <hi>England</hi> by the Stamp-Office Tax, Glaſs-Window Tax, and the ſeveral Duties on Coals and Malt, together with Exemption from any of the Proportions of Ceſs as above for the firſt Year—; Only, from theſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0554400100:299"/>
ſome Gentlemen took Occaſion to remind them of the Neceſſary Care taken by the Treaters, to Exempt <hi>Scotland</hi> in all Caſes from ſuch Burdens, as they found them unable to bear, and which abſolute Neceſſity did not oblige them to ſubject her to, and in ſuch Caſes to receive Equivalents, for what ever they were oblig'd to come into by the Neceſſity of Trade.</p>
               <p>But the Ferment was now grown high, and theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes had little Signification, the People being Unhappily Prepoſſeſſ'ſt beyond the power of Convictions.</p>
               <p>The 14<hi>th</hi> Article occaſioned long Diſcourſes, both within Doors and without, and a great many ill natur'd Things were ſaid on both ſides, the Matter of an Equivalent had not yet been Examined much into, and the Reaſon, Nature, and Neceſſity of it, had gone but a very little way into the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, even of the Gentlemen themſelves. The Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters alſo here met with ſome Indecencies, and the Reflections made on them, had ſuch an Effect in publick, as had they not met with ſome Check, might have been perſonally Miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to them, as to the partacted Abroad; ſee Fol. 28 <hi>of the next precedent part.</hi> Within Doors they met with ſome very unkind Reproaches, as if they had not made due Proviſions for their Countries Neceſſities, had conſented to Intolerable and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Burthens, and had Mock'd them with the Notion of an Equivalent, which did not leſſen the Burthens upon the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion their payment being to be Levied where it could not be paid; and then repaid again where it was not Levied.</p>
               <p>To make good theſe Charges, they pretended to make Calculations upon the Proportions of the ſaid Equivalent and ſome indeed brought in their own rough Draughts of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportions, whereupon it was Moved, That the Houſe ſhould enter upon more exact Calculations, and Examine the matters of Fact.

This, tho' it look'd, as if the Committee were to be a Jury upon the Treaters, to Examine their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, yet the Gentlemen unanimouſly agreed to; And the Chooſing a Committee was Approven, who went thorow the Calculations, and gave in ſuch exact Accounts of Things, as abundantly cleared up the Reputation of the Commiſſioners.</p>
               <p>It was alſo Moved, that to Aſſiſt the ſaid Committee, Two very able Accomptants; or Arithmeticians ſhould be found, to Examine the Calculations; one of which was Dr. <hi>James Gregory;</hi> Profeſſor of the Mathematicks in the College of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh;</hi> The other was Dr. <hi>Thomas Bowar,</hi> Profeſſor of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks in the College of <hi>Aberdeen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Sixteenth and Seventeenth Articles about the Coin, and about Weights and Meaſures, occaſioned little or no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.</p>

The Eighteenth Article had indeed ſome Diſcourſe upon it, as what ſhould, or ſhould not be Alterable by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and ſome Gentlemen were for Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the preſent Laws, without Alteration; A thing no Nation in the World practiſes, ſince Circumſtances of Nations Altering, may always make it Neceſſary to Alter, Amend, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new, or Repeal the Laws and Uſages of a Nation:</p>
               <p>And the Diſtinction in the Article it ſelf, was ſuch, as few could object, viz. <hi>That no Alteration ſhould be made in the Laws, reſpecting private Rights, except for the evident <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tility of the Subject within</hi> Scotland. This therefore, ſeemed to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the true Meaning of the Article in that Point; yet the other part of the Article about the Laws of Publick Right, Policy, and Civil Government, being made the ſame thro' out the whole United Kingdom; this occaſioned long Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, and held the Houſe ſo late, that they thought fit to Adjourn it till the next <hi>Sederunt.</hi>

               <p>This was the Fatal Day of the Tumult in the Streets, and the Houſe was no leſs warm within, proportionably ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than the Gentlemen were without, all which had its Share in Agitating the publick Confuſions: I am far from ſaying, That the Arguments uſed within Doors, occaſioned the Rabbles, but the Improvement a Party without Doors made of them, and the manner in which things now ſaid in the Parliament were Repreſented without, concurr'd to encreaſe the Ferment of the Nation.</p>
               <p>The Diſcourſes on the Eighteenth Article were now car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed on with great Warmth; Many long Speeches were made this Day, too long to be ſet down here, but tending all to this, That <hi>Scotland</hi> ought not to ſubject themſelves to Duties of any ſort, before it ſhould be known what ſuch Duties were; That no Laws of Cuſtoms or Exciſes ſhould take place, and that it could not be proper to allow the ſeveral Laws of Exciſe or Cuſtoms in <hi>England,</hi> till it was firſt calculated and agreed, what Cuſtoms and Exciſes <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was to pay—; Then the Diſcourſes on the paying Equalities of Taxes being re-aſſumed, ſome took Occaſion to make Reflections again on the Treaters, for ſubjecting their Country to Taxes, which firſt they alledged they did not underſtand, and ſecondly they were not able to pay.</p>
               <p>The Reproaches caſt upon the Treaters, the ill Behaviour of ſome Members, and the Indecencies ſhown in theſe Caſes, were ſo Univerſal, that even Her Majeſties High Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner did not eſcape, but was very ill uſed, which neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs His Grace with a great deal of Temper ſuffered, without any Diſorder, preferring the publick Peace to all his private Reſentments; And by this Prudence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented thoſe who deſired to have things Exaſperated, and hoped to ſee the Reſentment of the Government run up firſt, that they might have ſomething to pretend for the Irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities which follow'd.</p>
               <p>It may alſo be obſerved here, That the Printing the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Laws, Books of Rates, Exciſes and Cuſtoms, which it was very certain would not be underſtood here, and from which a thouſand falſe Suggeſtions would every day be raiſed, whence few People could Anſwer, was a Deſign calculated for a great many Ends, which were to be Anſwer'd in the future Proceedings, and of which we ſhall hear more hereafter.</p>

A Committee was Nominated alſo for this Work, and thouſands of Difficulties were continually raiſed in the Mouths of the People, to Expoſe the Treaty, and Exaſperate the People, ſuch as, That the Tax upon Salt was Intolerable, and that it would Deſtroy the Fiſhery, and the Poor were Repreſented to Subſiſt ſo much upon Salt, as if it had been one of the greateſt parts of their Food.</p>
               <p>The Exciſe on Beer, Ale, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was Repreſented as Inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable, and great Pains were taken to prove, that the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> paid 4 <hi>ſh.</hi> 9 <hi>d. per</hi> Barrel upon their Table Beer; and that the <hi>Scots</hi> Small Ale muſt pay equal Exciſe to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Strong Beer; And this was publickly Printed in the Streets, on purpoſe to Enrage the People.</p>
               <p>It was in vain to offer Calculations on theſe Heads—; And tho' it was, by the Author of this Work, proved by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and poſitive Demonſtration, that the Exciſe of their Ale could, in Proportion, pay no more than it did now, even by the Calculation of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Exciſes; And that the Expence of Salt, in any Houſe in the Kingdom, could not riſe to above 20 <hi>d. per</hi> Head <hi>per Annum,</hi> yet it was in vain; all Calculations of this ſort were ridiculed and expoſed as falſe and partial, and the Author maltreated in Print for his Eſſays on thoſe things, as an Enemy to the Country, and in order to expoſe him to the Fury of the Rabble, which had particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly mark'd him out for Deſtruction, in the general Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which follow'd.</p>
               <p>But all theſe Calculations appeared afterward to be right, as in their place will more particularly appear.</p>
               <p>However, the whole Debate of this Day could not bring them over the Eighteenth Article, the farther Diſcourſe of which was, as <hi>per</hi> the Minute, adjourned, and what inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted it further, you will ſee in the next Days Work.</p>
               <p>The Salt was an Argument People ſtuck very cloſs to, and ſtrove to make it Popular; For the Poor ſeemed to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it, and thoſe that eſpouſed it, whatever their Ends were in eſpouſing it, they always made the Relief and Eaſe of the Poor the main Argument: This was Taking and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging with the Common People, and as much Uſe was made of it, as if the Salt had been a principal part of their Food, and the Duty ſo great, that the Poor muſt have been ſtarved, if they had payed it—; The Debate, however, had this Effect, that it brought the Parliament to enter into the Conſideration of Amendments and Exemptions, which they particularly ſettled in this Affair, and which the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> eaſily came into, as will appear in its place.</p>

               <p>The Lord high Chancellor Repreſented to the Parliament, That he was directed by the Lords of Her Majeſties Privy Council, to Acquaint the Parliament, That upon occaſion of a Rabble and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult that happened in <hi>Edinburgh</hi> upon <hi>Wedneſday</hi> Night laſt, by which ſeveral Members of Parliament were Threatned and Inſulted; The Privy Council had, for the Security of the Members of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Peace of the Town, brought in a part of the Foot Guards to the Town of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and had iſſued forth a Proclamation againſt ſuch Tumultary Meetings, in the Terms of ſeveral Acts of Parliament.</p>
               <p>Whereupon, and after ſome Reaſoning, a Propoſition was made in thir Terms, That the Eſtates of Parliament being ſenſible of the Care and Concern of the Lords of Privy Council, to Suppreſs the late Tumult and Mob, and to ſecure the Safety and Quiet of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, That therefore they ſhould Return to their Lordſhips the Thanks of the Parliament, and ſhould Recommend to my Lord high Commiſſioner and the Privy Council to continue their Care for the Safety and Security of the Parliament, and the Peace and Quiet of the Town; which being Read,</p>

               <p>This whole day was a meer Interruption to the Reading of the Articles, and the Houſe was employed wholly on the Affair of the Rabbles.</p>
               <p>The Lord Commiſſioner having found the encreaſe of the Mob come to ſuch a Degree, as that the whole City was in Danger, and indeed the whole Conſtitution would otherwiſe have been Expoſed; His Grace ordered the Guards to enter the City about One of the Clock in the Morning, to aſſiſt the Magiſtrates, by which means the Tumult was Appeaſed, and the Rabble diſperſ'd; ſome of the Rioters had been ſeized and ſecured, and the Souldiers kept Poſt in the City all that Night, the enſuing Day and the Night, and part of this Day, without being Relieved, tho the Weather was exceeding Cold.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0554400100:306"/>
The Council had the Day before, Ratified what the Lord Commiſſioner had done, and it was not doubted but the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament would do the ſame; the abſolute Neceſſity of ſuch a proceeding, being, as was thought, enough to ſatisfie any Body who was not for having the Civil Authority ſubjected to the Inſolencies of the Rabble.</p>
               <p>But People were ſtrangely ſurprized, when they ſaw this ſtrenuouſly oppoſed in the Parliament; and had it not been carryed by a Majority in the Houſe, the Conſequences muſt have terminated in a ſecond Rabble, more Fatal and Furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than the firſt.</p>
               <p>The Marqueſs of <hi>A—le</hi> was the firſt Man who made Objection againſt it, and pleaded, That it was an Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the Liberty of Parliament, and taking away their Freedom of Speech; That it was Awing the Houſe with Souldiers, and bringing upon them Arbitrary Government; and ſeveral Speeches were made to this purpoſe, in which one Noble Perſon ſaid, He could perceive the Difference al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in the Votes of the Houſe, and that the Influence of the Souldiers had Altered the Matter.</p>
               <p>Theſe were hard Sayings indeed, and it was thought a hard Point, that People ſhould call the being ſubjected to an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>govern'd Rabble, Liberty of Parliament, and the Clamours of the Mob, Freedom of Speech; It was plain, if the Guards were not brought up, the Members of Parliament would be Aw'd, and the Treaters Maſſacred by the Mob; and to place Guards to Suppreſs Tumults, and Reſtrain the Head-ſtrong Multitude, was very far from Awing the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; it being alſo apparent, that this Guard was intirely Subordinate to the Commands of the Parliament, and were placed to Maintain, not Infringe the Liberty of Speech they ſpoke of; That no Man could be Influenc'd by Men ſet on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to keep the Peace, and diſperſe Rabbles, and in a Caſe when it was apparent to all the World, the Neceſſity was ſuch, That, unleſs thoſe Rabbles were ſuppreſs'd, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament could not ſit at all, nor the Buſineſs they were Aſſembled for be Debated.</p>
               <p>The Oppoſers, however, maintain'd the Diſpute a long time; but when they came to the Queſtion, it was appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, a great many of their Friends, in other Caſes yet, were ſo convinc'd of the Neceſſity of this, That they Voted againſt them, and ſo the Actings of the Lord Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner, and alſo of the Council, were Approved, and the Thanks of the Houſe Ordered, as in the Vote.</p>
               <p>The Proteſters are Named in the Minute, as above; And this, I think, was the firſt Proteſt made in Parliament, upon the Affair of the Union.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0554400100:307"/>
This Debate, of Courſe, put off the further Conſideration of the Eighteenth Article of the Union, which was the Work of the Day.</p>
               <p>There was great Struggling in the Houſe, on Pretence of the Infringing the Privileges of the City of <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> But the Magiſtrates having declared themſelves ſatisfied in the Neceſſity of the Caſe, and the Impoſſibility of Keeping the Peace without this Method, that Debate was alſo couch'd in the Proteſt as above, and every Body acquieſc'd; The Guards continued in their Poſts, and the reſpective Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Reliev'd one another with Beat of Drum, as is uſual, but the Effect was only Keeping the Peace; No Violence was offered to the Parliament, neither were any Souldiers plac'd at the Door to Awe the Members, much leſs was any denyed Enterance, or any other Perſon Acceſs to them, as on other Occaſions—; But the Parliament was perfectly Free, Open and Uninterrupted, the Souldiers were a Guard to them, but not a Guard againſt them, and it was not in the Power of any Perſon to ſay, he received the leaſt Affront from them: Indeed the Souldiers appeared wholly Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in any part of the Affair, they only Executed the Office of a Guard to preſerve the Peace, and keep the Government from being Inſulted.</p>
               <p>And in this peaceable Behaviour of the Souldiery, conſiſted a great deal of the Succeſs of the Treaty, for this took away all pretence from a party of Men, who aim'd at, and ſought for ſome ſuch Irregularity to complain of, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to have Proteſted againſt the Parliament, as under Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, and ſo having a legal Objection againſt the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as not Acted in a Free Parliament.</p>
               <p>This was a Diſappointment to a certain great Perſon, who propoſed a Proteſt againſt this very Thing, as an Act of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and ſo leaving the Houſe as a Body, pretending they were under the power of the Army; But the Souldiers being ſo Ordered, as to behave themſelves quietly, and only taking Poſt as a Guard to the City, to preſerve the publick Peace; the Doors of Parliament being always free and Uninterrupted, thoſe People were Defeated; and even their own Friends, whom they propoſed it to, refuſed them, acknowledging they could not ſuſtain the Allegation.</p>
               <p>I think it is very neceſſary to be particular in this caſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I know great Clamours were made, as well in <hi>England</hi> as in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as if the Souldiers, who upon this extraordinary Occaſion, were brought into the City, and who did indeed keep Guard in the Parliament Cloſs, were an Awe and a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to the Parliament, and that conſequently it was not a free Parliament.</p>

               <p>The great Queſtion came now to be Determined—, Whether they ſhould go upon the Treaty, or no.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that oppoſed it, would not directly Argue againſt Reading the Articles at all, &amp; ſo at once Reject the Treaty; But they began to ſtart a new Scruple, <hi>viz.</hi> Why ſhould it be put upon the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to Determine firſt upon the Treaty? Why ſhould not <hi>England,</hi> where the Treaty had been Form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and where their Parliament was now to Sit in a few Days; Why ſhould not they firſt Signify their Conſent to the Treaty, and then the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> might Conſider, whether they could joyn with them upon the Terms, YEA or NO?</p>
               <p>This occaſioned great Diſputes, and many Speeches were made, endeavouring to ſhew the Reaſonableneſs of having this Matter firſt Determin'd in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was among other things offered as a ſufficient Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, That, as it was the Queens Prerogative to Call Parliaments, to Appoint and Limit their Sittings, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to them any Matters as the Subject of their Meeting, which they ſhould Conſult about, not Excluſive of what they ſhould think fit to Debate themſelves, Her Majeſty had Determined which Parliament ſhould begin upon the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, by Appointing this Parliament for that End, and had particularly Recommended this Matter to them, and that therefore they ought to go about it.</p>
               <p>That the Priority was a Diſpute of no Conſequence at all, and that they had all the Liberty in the World to Paſs or not Paſs, Approve or not Approve of the Treaty now, as they ſhould have then; That, if there was any Difference, the Honour was done to <hi>Scotland,</hi> in putting the Treaty firſt into their Hands, as the Principal Perſons, who were ſuppoſed to have Objections to make, and that they might
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0554400100:311"/>
be made intirely eaſy, in every Thing that was Material, to their Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding all this, they renewed the Debate, and brought it to a Motion in the Parliament, as appears by the Vote, in which they alſo added the former Suggeſtion of Conſulting their Conſtituents; And ſome Members alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they had expreſs Directions from their Principals, and the Countries they Repreſented, Reſtraining, and poſitively Obliging them, not to Enter upon the Treaty.</p>
               <p>This brought Things to a great Height, and ſome Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, <hi>as was ſaid,</hi> began to Talk of Proteſting, and Leaving the Parliament, but they had more Wiſdom than that came to—; They indeed very earneſtly preſs'd this Motion, which was in ſhort to Obtain a Delay, and that made them fly from one Argument to another.</p>
               <p>Together with their Arguments, and to Second their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of Conſulting Principals, they brought in Addreſſes from the ſeveral Places mentioned above, and vehemently urged, That it appeared by them, that it was the Senſe of the People, that the whole Nation was againſt it, and that they ought not to Poceed without their Aſſent.</p>
               <p>Here it was Noted, That the Addreſs from <hi>Mid-Lothian</hi> was Signed by not above Twelve of the Gentlemen, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, tho' there were above Two Hundred Gentlemen in that County; And that therefore it ſeemed the Argument, of its being the Senſe of the Nation, muſt be very ill Grounded.</p>
               <p>At length they dropt the Debate, and obtained the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Parliament ſhould immediately proceed to Reading the Articles.</p>
               <p>But then a new Project was ſet on Foot; and it was an odd thing to ſee, that after a long Debate whether the Articles ſhould be Read <hi>at all</hi> or no, it occaſioned another Queſtion, and no ſmall Debate upon it, which End of them they ſhould begin at.</p>
               <p>When they had gotten over the Queſtion as before, for Reading, they fell out which Article they ſhould Read firſt; the Party which had at firſt oppoſed Reading them all, now ſtruggled to begin in the middle of the Treaty, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was, as they alledged, they were for Examining the Particulars before they Voted the General. The firſt Article con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, That from and after the firſt Day of <hi>May,</hi> the two Kingdoms ſhould be United, <hi>&amp;c. This they would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed;</hi> and then followed the Conditions which they would have be agreed firſt of all.</p>
               <p>Others alledged, that it would be needleſs to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Particulars till it was agreed, whether they ſhould be UNITED or No; and therefore it was neceſſary to Examine the firſt Article in its order, not only becauſe it was the firſt, but becauſe it was moſt rational to Determine, whether there
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0554400100:312"/>
ſhould be an Union or no, before they deſcended to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, becauſe, if all the Articles were agreed to, yet if it ſhould be ſo precarious as to ſtate the Queſtion afterwards, whether there ſhould be a Union or no, it might at once ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all their Labour Fruitleſs.</p>
               <p>Upon this Debate, they reſolved, it was firſt neceſſary to get over the main Article, Whether there ſhould be a Union or not, before they entred into the Merits of the Particulars, or Examined the Conditions; and they only Read the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle to finiſh the Debate, and prevent any more Difficulty.</p>

               <p>Whereupon there was a Reſolve offered in thir Terms, <hi>That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Houſe proceed to Vote any of the Articles of the Treaty, they will hear what Security the Commiſſion of the Church is to offer for the Church Government, and that before any Incorporating <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion be voted;</hi> And after ſome further Debate upon the ſaid Motion and Reſolve, a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond State of a Vote was offered, That the Church Government be taken into Conſideration before the Articles of Treaty, <hi>Yea</hi> or <hi>No.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>The firſt Article was now Read, and all the Oppoſition hitherto made, had been over. But two plauſible Things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd; one was, To Debate whether it ſhould be ſo ſettled that if all the Articles were not Concluded, none of them which were Conſidered, ſhould be of any Force; this was ſo plauſible, no Body could withſtand it.</p>
               <p>Then they Objected in the Name of the Church, on the Occaſion brought before them formerly, <hi>viz.</hi> The Act of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity. Unhappy was the Condition at this time of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> if what ſeem'd to appear, had been her real Caſe, <hi>viz.</hi> To have her greateſt Enemies be her beſt Solicitors, as if ſhe had been ſo deſperate, that even thoſe that formerly Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to pull her down, were the only ſeeming Advocates for her preſent Eſtabliſhment.</p>
               <p>Or elſe ſurely Her Caſe was very happy, on the other hand, that Her Eſtabliſhment was ſo viſibly neceſſary at this time, that even Her apparent Enemies were careful to ſupport Her.</p>
               <p>I ſhall enter no further into the Myſtery of it here, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had Voted to conſider the Addreſs of the Commiſſion, before any thing was Concluded, and whether that word, <hi>Concluded,</hi> was to ſignifie before they Voted any Article, or before the whole Union was Concluded, was now Immateri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; and tho' it was expreſly ſaid in the Vote of <hi>October</hi> 17, That it ſhould be before the Union was Concluded, yet it was Moved now, and the Parliament was ſo willing to do every thing for the Satisfaction of the Nation, that they Reſolved to go upon it immediately after the paſſing the firſt Article.</p>
               <p>The Party that ſtill Oppoſed, were for going on the Affair of the Church, before any of the Articles were Concluded on, alledging, That if the Security of the Church could not be agreed on, the Union could not be entered upon; but it was returned to that, That juſt on the contrary, it was neceſſary firſt to Vote the General, Whether there ſhould be a Union or no in the Terms of the Treaty, which General was included in the firſt Article, and it was eaſie to be ſeen, that if that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle was Voted againſt, the Union was Rejected; and if the Union was Rejected, there was then no need for Diſcourſing on the Act of Security for the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:0554400100:314"/>
This was too ſtrong a way of Reaſoning to be Reſiſted, and therefore when it came to the Queſtion, it paſt, as <hi>per</hi> the Minute.<q>That it be agreed to, in the firſt place, To proceed to take the firſt Article of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion to Conſideration, with this Proviſion, That if the other Articles of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion be not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted by the Parliament, then the Agreeing to, and Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Firſt, ſhall be of no Effect; And that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after the ſaid firſt Article, the Parliament will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to an Act for Security of the Doctrine, Diſcipline, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Government of the Church, as now by Law Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed within this Kingdom.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And now the firſt Article came upon the Stage, and the firſt Bruſh it met with was, That it was againſt the Claim of Right, as <hi>per</hi> the Minute.</p>
               <p>This was a Surprizing Blow indeed, and made the Houſe immediately Call for the Claim of Right, but that which was Remarkable upon Reading the Claim of Right was, it became neceſſary to Read the Letter of the Convention at that time ſent to King <hi>William,</hi> in which, the Eſtates then met, humbly deſired His Majeſty, to ſet on Foot an Union in the very Senſe and Meaning of this Incorporation of the Kingdoms, as the only Happineſs the Kingdom deſired.<q>We are moſt ſenſible of Your Majeſties Kindneſs, and Fatherly Care to both Your Kingdoms, in promoving their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, which we hope hath been Reſerved to be Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by You; That as both Kingdoms are <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited in one Head and Soveraign, ſo they may become one Body Politick, one Nation, to be Repreſented in one Parliament. And to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie our Readineſs to Comply with Your Majeſty in that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; We have Nominated Commiſſioners to Treat the Terms of an Entire and Perpetual <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion betwixt the Two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, with Reſervation to us of our Church Government, as it ſhall be Eſtabliſhed at the Time of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion. Theſe Commiſſioners do wait Your Majeſties Approbation and Call, That they may Meet and Treat with the Commiſſioners to be Appointed for <hi>England,</hi> at what Time and Place Your Majeſty ſhall Appoint. And if any Difficulty ſhall ariſe in the Treaty, We do, upon our Part, Refer the Determination thereof to Your Majeſty. And we do Aſſure our ſelves, from Your Majeſties Prudence and Goodneſs, of a Happy Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to that Important Affair, ſo as the ſame may be Agreed to, and Ratified by Your Majeſty in Your firſt Parliament.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This indeed occaſioned a long Debate and much Warmth on both ſides, which held the Houſe very late; And after Reading all the Papers, the Inconſiſtency of the Union with the Claim of Right was thorowly Examin'd, where it could not but be very remarkable to obſerve ſome Gentlemen giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Sanction to the Claim of Right, who never before ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowleg'd
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0554400100:315"/>
it, owning it now as a Sacred Foundation, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to oppoſe it to the Scheme of Union now drawn; which being of more Fatal Conſequence to their Real Deſign, as well as Party, they were brought to the Neceſſity of Cloſing with the firſt to Confront the laſt; ſo Playing one againſt another, Recognizing the Revolution as the leſſer Evil to Repulſe the Union, which they ſaw plainly Aim'd at the Foundation, Struck at the Root, and muſt for ever Forecloſe <hi>Jacobitiſm</hi> and <hi>Prelacy,</hi> the two Columes which ſupported their Cauſe—. The Reaſonings here in the Houſe began with much Calmneſs; Immediately after Reading the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, Mr. <hi>Seton</hi> of <hi>Pitmedden</hi> took the Opportunity to ſay, That, having had the Honour to be one of the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners for the Treaty, he thought it his Duty to give ſome Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which mov'd him to Approve that Article at <hi>London;</hi> That he was perſwaded, there were ſeveral Members ſo Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced againſt all the Articles, that he could not hope from them a Favourable Audience. And that what he had to ſay to the preſent Subject of Debate, had been thought upon, when he Signed the Treaty; therefore he would preſume to make Uſe of his Papers, hoping, tho' his Reaſons could not convince any Member, yet they might ſerve to Vindicate his Conduct to Poſterity. Then he proceeded, and the Second of <hi>November</hi> 1706, made the following Speech.<q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>My Lord Chancellor,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THis Honourable Houſe has heard the ſeveral <hi>Articles of the Treaty of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> twice Read, has ſpent a conſiderable time in Diſcourſing to each of them, and after much Debate is come to Examine and Determine upon the Firſt: Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Arguments offered againſt it, I cannot find the leaſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive for Altering the Opinion I had at Signing this Article, having had the Honour to be one of the Commiſſioners Appointed by Her Majeſty for that End; but that I may give all Satisfaction to every Member, I ſhall humbly offer in a plain manner my Thoughts in relation to it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>My Lord,</hi> This Article is the Foundation of the whole Treaty, and the Approving or Rejecting of it muſt Determine Union or no Union betwixt both Kingdoms.</p>
                     <p>How far the Approving this Article conduces to our Happineſs, appears evidently, by conſidering the three different Ways propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for Retriving the Languiſhing Condition of this Nation; which are, That we continue under the ſame Sovereign with <hi>England,</hi> with Limitations on his Prerogative as King of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> That the two Kingdoms be Incorporated into one, or that they be entirely ſeparated.</p>
                     <p>That the Union of Crowns with Limitations on the Succeſſor is not ſufficient to Rectifie the bad State of this Nation, appears from theſe Poſitions founded on Reaſon and Experience.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0554400100:316"/>
Two Kingdoms ſubject to one Sovereign, having different Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, the nearer theſe are one to another, the greater Jealouſie and Emulation will be betwixt 'em.</p>
                     <p>Every Monarch, having two or more Kingdoms, will be obliged to prefer the Counſel and Intereſt of the Stronger to that of the Weaker: And the greater Diſparity of Power and Riches there is betwixt theſe Kingdoms, the greater influence the more powerful Nation will have on the Sovereign. Notwithſtanding theſe Poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I ſhall ſuppoſe the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> is Veſted with the Power of making Peace and War, of Rewarding and Puniſhing Perſons of all Ranks, of Levying Troops, and of the <hi>Negative</hi> it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>I cou'd ſhow the Inconveniencies that muſt attend ſuch a State of Government, in Diſpoſal of Places and Managing Publick Affairs; I cou'd likewiſe ſhow the Improbability of Attaining ſuch Conditions, or keeping 'em if attained; but laying aſide ſuch Conſiderations, my humble Opinion is, That we cannot reap any Benefit from theſe Conditions of Government, without the Aſſiſtance of <hi>England:</hi> And the People thereof will never be convinced to promote the Intereſt of <hi>Scotland,</hi> 'till both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms are Incorporated into One: So that I conceive ſuch a State of Limitations to be no better for <hi>Scotland,</hi> than if it were intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeparated from <hi>England,</hi> in which State there's little Appearance of procuring any Remedy to our preſent Circumſtances, which appears from theſe uncontraverted Poſitions.</p>
                     <p>The People and Government of <hi>Scotland</hi> muſt be Richer or Poorer, as they have Plenty or Scarcity of Money, the common Meaſure of Trade.</p>
                     <p>No Money or Things of Value can be purchaſed in the Courſe of Commerce: but where there's a Force to protect it.</p>
                     <p>This Nation is behind all other Nations of <hi>Europe</hi> for many years, with reſpect to the Effects of an extended Trade.</p>
                     <p>This Nation being Poor, and without Force to protect it's Commerce, cannot reap great Advantages by it, till it partake of the Trade and Protection of ſome powerful Neighbour Nation, that can Communicate both theſe.</p>
                     <p>To Illuſtrate this laſt Poſition, I ſhall give a ſhort View of the State of Commerce we muſt needs be in, with reſpect to our Neighbour Nations, ſuppoſing an entire Separation from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ordinary Mean, whereby we can flouriſh in Wealth, is, That Ballance which ariſes from the Exchange of our Natural or Artificial Product with other Places: But we have no Valuable Branch of Export, which does not Interfere with the like Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, in ſome more powerful Neighbour Nation, who's Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt it is to Suppreſs or Diſcourage our Commodity, for Raiſing the Value of its own; ſo that there's no Demonſtrable Security for the Vent and Encouragement of any Branch of our Export.</p>

Can it be expected, That <hi>Holland</hi> will ſuffer us to Improve our Fiſhery, which is to them a Nurſery for Seamen, a Livelyhood to many Families, and an immenſe Treaſure to the Publick?</p>
                     <p>If we Traffick with <hi>England;</hi> our Linnen-Cloth, Cattle, and Coals will be Diſcouraged, at leaſt, after the ſame manner that we diſcourage Export from thence. If we Traffick with <hi>Muſcovy, Sweden, Denmark, Poland, Germany, France, Spain, Portugal</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> the Sale of our Commodities will be of ſmall Value in theſe Places; ſeing the <hi>Dutch</hi> or <hi>Engliſh,</hi> by their Increaſe of Trade, are capable to ſerve them with moſt of the like Goods, cheaper and better than we.</p>
                     <p>Let us look to any other Part of the World, for Vent to our Product, and we'll find other Nations have prevented us.</p>
                     <p>If we attempt the <hi>Eaſt-India-</hi>Trade, that is already Enhanſed by the <hi>Dutch, Engliſh, French, Spaniards</hi> or <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> from whom we muſt expect Oppoſition, they themſelves Oppoſing one another daily; and we of no Force to Debate the ſame, with the moſt Inconſiderable of them.</p>
                     <p>The Trade of <hi>Africae</hi> is, for the moſt part, of ſmall Value; and every Province of <hi>America</hi> is claimed as Property, by ſome powerful <hi>European</hi> Nation.</p>
                     <p>If it be ſaid, That <hi>Scotland</hi> may make Alliance with one of its Neighbour Nations for Protection; that Alliance muſt be with <hi>Holland, England</hi> or <hi>France:</hi> Other Countries being ſo Remote or Poor, that their Friendſhips can be of little Uſe to us.</p>
                     <p>With <hi>Holland</hi> we can have no Advantageous Alliance, becauſe its chief Branch of Trade is the ſame with ours; with the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> we can expect no profitable Friendſhip, for they being our near Neighbours, will be Jealous of our Increaſe in Power; and from <hi>France,</hi> few Advantages can be reap'd, till the old Offenſive and Defenſive <hi>League</hi> be revived betwixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> which wou'd give Umbrage to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and occaſion a War betwixt them and us. And allowing the <hi>Scots,</hi> in ſuch a Juncture, with the Aſſiſtance of <hi>France,</hi> to Conquer <hi>England; Scotland,</hi> by that Conqueſt, cou'd not hope to better its preſent State; for 'tis more than probable, the Conquerour wou'd make his Reſidence in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as formerly the Northern People uſed to do in their Southern Expeditions.</p>
                     <p>From theſe Conſiderations I conceive, That this Nation, by an entire Separation from <hi>England,</hi> cannot extend it's Trade, ſo as to raiſe its Power in Proportion to other Trafficking Nations in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope;</hi> but that hereby we may be in Danger of returning to that <hi>Gothick</hi> Conſtitution of Government, wherein our Forefathers were, which was frequently attended with Feuds, Murders, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predations and Rebellions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>My Lord,</hi> I'm ſorry, That, in place of Things, we Amuſe our ſelves with Words; for my part, I comprehend no durable Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> but that expreſſed in this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0554400100:318"/>
by <hi>One Kingdom,</hi> that is to ſay, One People, One Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and One Intereſt.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, the Words, <hi>Federal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> are become very Faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and may be handſomely fitted to delude unthinking People; But if any Member of this Houſe will give himſelf the Trouble to examine what Conditions or Articles are underſtood by theſe words, and reduce them into any kind of Federal Compacts, whereby diſtinct Nations have been United: I'll preſume to ſay, Theſe will be found Impracticable, or of very little Uſe to us.</p>
                     <p>But to put that Matter in a clear Light, theſe <hi>Queries</hi> ought to be duly Examined, Whether a Federal Union be Practicable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two Nations accuſtomed to a Monarchical Government? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there can be any ſure Guaranty projected for the Obſervance of the Articles of a Federal Compact, ſtipulated betwixt two Nations; whereof the one is much Superior to the other in Riches, Numbers of People, and an extended Commerce? Whether the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of a Federal Union do Ballance its Diſadvantages? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Engliſh</hi> will accept a Federal Union, ſuppoſing it to be for the true Intereſt of both Nations? Whether any Federal Compact betwixt <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> is ſufficient to ſecure the Peace of this Iſland, or Fortify it againſt the Intrigues and Invaſions of its Foreign Enemies? And whether <hi>England</hi> in Prudence, ought to Communicate its Trade and Protection to this Nation, till both Kingdoms are Incorporated in one?</p>
                     <p> To clear this laſt <hi>Querie,</hi> I ſhall offer a Remark from Hiſtory.</p>
                     <p>Of two Independent and diſtinct Kingdoms United by a Federal Compact under one Sovereign, the Weaker to preſerve its Intereſt, has ſome times ſeparated from the Stronger, unleſs prevented by open Force, or ſecret Influence on its Government.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi> were ſubject to the ſame Sovereign, <hi>Philip</hi> II. And notwithſtanding the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> got moſt Advantagious Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from <hi>Spain,</hi> they no ſooner found a favourable Opportunity in the Reign of <hi>Philip</hi> IV. than they revolted from their Allegiance, and Elected the Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi> for their King.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Denmark</hi> were United by a Federal Compact under one Monarch, but the <hi>Swedes</hi> judging a Separation more for their Intereſt, broke off, and choſe <hi>Guſtavus</hi> the 1. for their King.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>My Lord,</hi> I ſhould now conſider an Incorporating Union, as it is expreſſed in this Article by <hi>One Kingdom;</hi> but that I may not take up the time of the Houſe, I ſhall only give one Hiſtorical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark with Relation to it.</p>
                     <p>Two or more diſtinct Kingdoms or States, by incorporating in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one Kingdom, have continued under the ſame Sovereign, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying equally the Protection of his Government, and every part of the Body Politick, tho never ſo far remov'd from the Seat of Government, has Flouriſhed in Wealth in proportion to the Value of it's Natural Product, or the Induſtry of its Inhabitants. To prove this Remark there are many Examples.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0554400100:319"/>
                        <hi>Spain</hi> was formerly divided into ſeveral Kingdoms, ten where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are Incorporated into the one Kingdom of <hi>Spain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>France</hi> was formerly divided into 12 States, which are Incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into the one Kingdom of <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>England</hi> was formerly divided into ſeven Kingdoms, which are Incorporated into the one Kingdom of <hi>England; Scotland</hi> it ſelf was formerly divided into two Kingdoms, which at preſent are Incorporated into the one Kingdom of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I cou'd give ſome Account of the particular Advantages we'll obtain by an Incorporating Union with <hi>England,</hi> but there will be occaſions to Diſcourſe of theſe, as the other Articles fall under the Conſideration of this Parliament. In general, I may aſſert, That by this Union, we'll have Acceſs to all the Advantages in Commerce, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> enjoy; we'll be capable, by a good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, to improve our National Product, for the benefit of the whole Iſland; and we'll have our Liberty, Property and Religion, ſecured under the Protection of one Sovereign, and one Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, <hi>My Lord,</hi> If Limitations on the Succeſſor can be of little or no Uſe to us; if an entire Separation from <hi>England</hi> brings no Advantage to this Nation: and if all Federal Compacts, as we are ſtated, have inſuperable Difficulties, which in ſome meaſure I have cleared, there is but one of two left to our Choiſe, <hi>to wit,</hi> That both Kingdoms be United into one, or that we continue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame Sovereign with <hi>England</hi> as we have done theſe 100 years paſt. This laſt I conceive to be a very ill State, for by it (if Experience be convincing) we cannot expect any of the Advantages of an Incorporating Union; but on the contrair, Our Sovereignty and Independency will be eclipſed, the number of our Nobility will Encreaſe, Our Commons will be Oppreſſed, Our Parliaments will be influenced by <hi>England,</hi> the Execution of our Laws will be neglected; Our Peace will be interrupted by Factions for Places and Penſions; Luxury together with Poverty (tho' ſtrange) will invade us; Numbers of <hi>Scots</hi> will withdraw themſelves to Foreign Countries; and all the other Effects of Bad Government muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily attend us.</p>
                     <p>Let us therefore, <hi>My Lord,</hi> after all theſe Conſiderations ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove this Article: and when the whole Treaty ſhall be duly Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and Ratified, I'm hopeful, this Parliament will return their moſt Dutiful Acknowledgments to Her Majeſty, for Her Royal En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours in promoting a Laſting Union betwixt both Nations.</p>

                        <hi>My Lord Chancellor,</hi> The greateſt Honour that was done unto a <hi>Roman,</hi> was to allow him the Glory of a Triumph; the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt diſhonourable Puniſhment was that of <hi>Paricide:</hi> He that was Guilty of <hi>Paricide,</hi> was beaten with Rods upon his naked Body, till the Blood guſht out of all the Veins of his Body; then he was ſowed up in a Leathern Sack called a <hi>Culeus,</hi> with a Cock, a Viper, and an Ape, and thrown Headlong into the Sea.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>My Lord, Patricide</hi> is a greater Crime than <hi>Paricide,</hi> all the World over.</p>
                     <p>In a Triumph, <hi>My Lord,</hi> when the Conqueror was Riding in his Triumphal Chariot, Crowned with Lawrels, Adorned with Trophies, and Applauded with Huzza's, there was a <hi>Monitor</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to ſtand behind him, to warn, Not to be High-minded, nor Puffed up with Overveening Thoughts of himſelf; and to his Chariot were tied a Whip and a Bell, to mind him, That, for all his Glory and Grandeur, he was Accountable to the People for his Adminiſtration, and would be Puniſhed as other Men, if found Guilty.</p>
                     <p>The greateſt Honour amongſt us, <hi>My Lord,</hi> is to Repreſent the Sovereign's Sacred Perſon in Parliament; and, in one particular,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0554400100:323"/>
it appears to be greater than that of a Triumph; becauſe the whole Legiſlative Power ſeems to be wholly Intruſted with him: If he give the Royal Aſſent to an Act of the Eſtates, it becomes a Law Obligatory upon the Subject, tho' contrary or without any Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the Sovereign: If he refuſe the Royal Aſſent to a Vote in Parliament, it cannot be a Law, tho' he has the Sovereign's particular and poſitive Inſtructions for it.</p>
                     <p>His Grace the Duke of <hi>Queensberry,</hi> who now Repreſents Her <hi>Majeſty</hi> in this Seſſion of Parliament, hath had the Honour of that Great Truſt, as often, if not more than any <hi>Scots</hi> Man ever had; He hath been the Favorite of two Succeſſive Sovereigns; and I cannot but commend his Conſtancy and Perſeverance, that, notwithſtanding his former Difficulties and unſucceſsful Attempts, and maugre ſome other Specialities not yet determined, that his Grace has yet had the Reſolution, to undertake the moſt unpopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Meaſures laſt: If his Grace ſucceed in this Affair of an Union, and that it prove for the Happineſs and Welfare of the Nation, then he juſtly Merits to have a Statue of Gold erected for himſelf: but if it ſhall tend to the intire Deſtruction &amp; Abolition of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that we the Nation's Truſtees ſhall go into it; then I muſt ſay, That a Whip and a Bell, a Cock, a Viper, and an Ape, are but too ſmall Puniſhments for any ſuch bold unnatural Undertaking and Complaiſance.</p>
                     <p>That I may path a way, <hi>My Lord,</hi> to a full, calm and free Reaſoning upon this Affair, which is of the laſt Conſequence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Nation; I ſhall mind this Honourable Houſe, that we are the Succeſſors of our Noble Predeceſſors who founded our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, framed our Laws, amended, altered and corrected them from time to time, as the Affairs and Circumſtances of the Nation did require, without the Aſſiſtance or Advice of any Foreign Power or Potentate, and who, during the time of 2000 Years, have handed them down to us a free Independent Nation, with the Hazard of their Lives and Fortunes; Shall not we then ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue for that, which our Progenitors have purchaſed for us at ſo dear a Rate, and with ſo much Immortal Honour and Glory? GOD forbid. Shall the Hazard of a Father unbind the Ligaments of a Dumb Son's Tongue; and ſhall we hold our Peace, when our <hi>Patria</hi> is in Danger? I ſpeak this, <hi>My Lord,</hi> That I may incourage every Individual Member of this Houſe, to ſpeak their Mind freely. There are many Wiſe and Prudent Men amongſt us, who think it not worth their while to open their Mouths; there are others, who can ſpeak very well, and to good Purpoſe, who ſhelter themſelves under the ſhameful Cloak of Silence, from a Fear of the Frowns of Great Men and Parties. I have obſerved, <hi>My Lord,</hi> by my Experience, the greateſt Number of Speakers in the moſt Trivial Affairs; and it will always prove ſo, while we come not to the right Underſtanding of our Oath <hi>de fideli,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are bound not only to give our Vote, but our Faithful Advice in Parliament, as we ſhould <hi>Anſwer to GOD;</hi> and in our
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0554400100:324"/>
Ancient Laws, the Repreſentatives of the Honourable Barons and the Royal Burrows are termed Spokeſmen: It lyes upon your Lordſhips therefore, particularly to take notice of ſuch, whoſe Modeſty makes them Baſhful to Speak. Therefore I ſhall leave it upon you, and conclude this Point, with a very Memorable Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of an Honeſt private Gentleman, to a great <hi>Queen,</hi> upon Occaſion of a State Project, contrived by an able Stateſman, and the Favorite to a great <hi>King,</hi> againſt a Peaceable Obedient People, becauſe of the Diverſity of their Laws and Conſtitutions. <hi>If at this time thou hold thy Peace, Salvation ſhall come to the People from another place, but thou and thy Houſe ſhall periſh.</hi> I leave the Application to each particular Member of this Houſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>My Lord,</hi> I come now to conſider our <hi>Diviſions.</hi> We are under the Happy Reign (Bleſſed be GOD) of the <hi>Beſt of Queens,</hi> Who has no Evil Deſign againſt the meaneſt of Her Subjects, Who Loves all Her People, and is equally Beloved by them again; and yet, that, under the Happy Influence of our moſt Excellent <hi>Queen,</hi> there ſhould be ſuch Diviſions and Factions, more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and threatning to Her Dominions, than if we were under an Arbitrary Government, is moſt ſtrange and unaccountable. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an Arbitrary Prince, all are willing to Serve, becauſe all are under a Neceſſity to Obey, whether they will or not. He chooſes therefore whom he will, without reſpect to either Parties or Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and if he think fit to take the Advices of his Councils or Parliaments, every Man ſpeaks his Mind freely, and the Prince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the Faithful Advice of his People, without the Mixture of Self-deſigns: If he prove a Good Prince, the Government is eaſy; if Bad, either Death or a Revolution brings a Deliverance. Whereas here, <hi>My Lord,</hi> there appears no End of our Miſery, if not prevented in time; Factions are now become Independent, and have got Footing in Councils, in Parliaments, in Treaties, in Armies, in Incorporations, in Families, among Kindred, yea Man and Wife are not free from their Political Jarrs.</p>
                     <p>It remains therefore, <hi>My Lord,</hi> that I enquire into the Nature of theſe things, and ſince the Names give us not the Right Idea of the thing, I am afraid I will have Difficulty to make my ſelf well underſtood.</p>
                     <p>The Names generally uſed to denote the Factions, are <hi>Whig</hi> and <hi>Torie,</hi> as obſcure as that of the <hi>Guelfs</hi> and <hi>Gibelins:</hi> Yea, <hi>My Lord,</hi> they have different Significations, as they are applyed to Factions in each Kingdom, a <hi>Whig</hi> in <hi>England</hi> is a Heterogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Creature, in <hi>Scotland</hi> he is all of a piece; a <hi>Tory</hi> in <hi>England</hi> is all of a piece and a <hi>Stateſman,</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> he is quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, an Anti-courteour and Anti-ſtateſman.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Whig</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> appears to be ſomewhat like <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi>'s Image of different Mettals, different Claſſes, different Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and different Deſigns; yet take them all together, they are like a piece of fine mixed Droggat of different Threeds, ſome Finer, ſome Courſer, which after all make a comely Appearance,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0554400100:325"/>
and an agreeable Suit. A <hi>Tory</hi> is like a piece of Loyal-made <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cloath, the true Staple of the Nation, all of a Threed: yet if we look narrowly into it, we ſhall perceive Diverſity of Colours, which, according to the Various Situations and Poſitions, makes Various Appearances; ſometimes <hi>Tory</hi> is like the Moon in its Full, as appeared in the Affair of the <hi>Bill of the Occaſional Conformity;</hi> upon other occaſions it appears to be under Cloud, and as if it were Eclipſed by a greater Body, as it did in the Deſign of the Calling over the Illuſtrious Princeſs <hi>Sophia.</hi> However, by this we may ſee their deſigns are to outſhoot <hi>Whig</hi> in his own Bow.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Whig</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> is a true blew <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> who, without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering Time or Power, will <hi>venture their All for the Kirk:</hi> but ſomething leſs for the State. <hi>The greateſt Difficulty</hi> is, how to deſcribe a <hi>Scots Tory:</hi> Of old, when I knew them firſt, <hi>Tory</hi> was an Honeſt Hearted Comradiſh Fellow, who, provided he were Maintain'd and Protected in his Benefices, Titles and Dignities by the State, he was the leſs anxious who had the Government and Management of the Church: but now, what he is ſince <hi>Jure-Divinity</hi> came in Faſhon; and that Chriſtianity, and by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, Salvation, comes to depend upon Epiſcopal Ordination, I profeſs I know not what to make of him; only this I muſt ſay for him, That he endeavours to do, by Oppoſition, that, which his Brother in <hi>England</hi> endeavours, by a more Prudent and leſs Scrupulous Method.</p>
                     <p>Now, <hi>My Lord,</hi> from theſe Diviſions there has got up a kind of <hi>Ariſtocracy,</hi> ſomething like the Famous Triumvirate at <hi>Rome,</hi> they are a kind of Undertakers and Pragmatick Stateſmen, who, finding their Fower and Strength great, and anſwerable to their Deſigns, will make Bargains with our Gracious Sovereign, they will ſerve Her faithfully, but upon their own Terms: they muſt have their own Inſtruments, their own Meaſures, this Man muſt be turned out, and that Man put in, and then they'll make Her the moſt <hi>Glorious Queen</hi> in <hi>Europe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Where will this end, <hi>My Lord?</hi> Is not Her Majeſty in Danger by ſuch a Method? Is not the Monarchy in Danger? Is not the Nation's Peace and Tranquillity in Danger? Will a Change of Parties make the Nation more Happy? No, <hi>My Lord,</hi> the Seed is ſowen, that is like to afford us a perpetual Increaſe; it's not an Annual Herb, it takes deep Root, it Seeds and Breeds; and, if not timeouſly prevented by Her Majeſty's Royal Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, will ſplit the whole Iſland in two.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>My Lord,</hi> I think, conſidering our preſent Circumſtances at this time, the Almighty GOD has reſerved this great Work for us: We may Bruiſe this <hi>Hydra</hi> of Diviſion, and Cruſh this <hi>Cocka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice</hi>'s Egg; our Neighbours in <hi>England</hi> are not yet fitted for any ſuch thing, they are not under the Afflicting Hand of Providence, as we are; their Circumſtances are Great and Glorious, their Treaties are prudently managed both at Home and Abroad, their Generals Brave and Valorous, their Armies Succeſsful and Victorious, their
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0554400100:326"/>
Trophies and Lawrels Memorable and Surpriſing; Their Enemies Subdued and Routed, their Strong Holds Beſieged and Taken, Sieges Relieved, Mariſhals Killed and Taken Priſoners, Provinces and Kingdoms are the Reſults of their Victories; the Royal Navy is the Terror of <hi>Europe,</hi> their Trade and Commerce Extended through the Univerſe, Incircling the whole Habitable World, and Rendering their own Capital City the <hi>Emporium</hi> for the whole Inhabitants of the Earth; and which is yet more than all theſe things, the Subjects freely beſtowing their Treaſury upon their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign; and above all, theſe vaſt Riches, the Sinews of War, and without which all the Glorious Succeſs had proven abortive; theſe Treaſures are managed with ſuch Faithfulneſs and Nicety, that they Anſwer ſeaſonably all their Demands, tho at never ſo great a diſtance. Upon theſe Conſiderations, <hi>My Lord,</hi> how hard and difficult a thing will it prove, to perſwade our Neighbours to a ſelf-denyal Bill.</p>
                     <p>It's quite otherways with us, <hi>My Lord,</hi> we are an Obſcure poor People, tho' formerly of better account; removed to a remote cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the World, without Name and without Alliances, our Poſts mean and precarious; ſo that I profeſs, I don't think any one Poſt of the Kingdom worth the Briguing after, ſave that of being Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner to a long Seſſion of a Factious <hi>Scots</hi> Parliament, with an antedated Commiſſion, and that yet renders the reſt of the Miniſters more Miſerable: What hinders us then, <hi>My Lord,</hi> to lay aſide our Diviſions to unite Cordially and heartily together in our preſent Circumſtances, when <hi>our All is at the Stake; Hannibal, My Lord,</hi> is at our Gates, <hi>Hannibal</hi> is come within our Gates, <hi>Hannibal</hi> is come the length of this Table, he is at the Foot of this Throne, he will demoliſh this Throne, if we take not Notice he'll ſeiſe upon theſe <hi>Regalia;</hi> he'll take them as our <hi>ſpolia opima,</hi> and whip us out of this Houſe never to return again.</p>
                     <p>For the Love of GOD then, <hi>My Lord,</hi> for the Safety and Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of our Ancient Kingdom, whoſe ſad Circumſtances I hope we ſhall yet Convert unto Proſperity and Happineſs! We want no Means, if we Unite, GOD bleſſeth the Peace-makers, we want nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men nor Sufficiency of all manner of things neceſſary, to make a Nation happy: all depends upon Management, <hi>Concordia res parvae creſcunt.</hi> I fear not theſe Articles, tho they were ten times worſe than they are, if we once Cordially forgive one another, and that according to our Proverb, <hi>bygones be bygones and fair play to come.</hi>) For my part in the ſight of GOD and in the preſence of this Honourable Houſe I heartily forgive every Man, and beggs that they may do the ſame to me, and I do moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly propoſe, that his Grace <hi>My Lord Commiſſioner</hi> may appoint an <hi>Agape,</hi> may order a Love-Feaſt for this Honourable Houſe, that we may lay aſide all ſelf deſigns, and after our Faſts and Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may have a day of Rejoicing and Thankfulneſs, may eat our Meat with Gladneſs, and our Bread with a Merry Heart, then ſhall we <hi>ſit each Man under his own Fig-tree,</hi> and <hi>the Voice of the Turtle</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>My Lord Chancellor,</hi> I am ſorry, that I muſt purſue the Threed of my Sad and Melancholy Story: what remains, I am afraid, prove as afflicting as what I have ſaid; I ſhall therefore Conſider the Motives, which have ingaged the two Nations to enter upon a Treaty of Union at this time: in general, <hi>My Lord,</hi> I think both of them had in their View to better themſelves by the Treaty; but before I enter upon the Particular Motives of each Nation, I muſt inform this Honourable Houſe, that ſince I can Remember, the two Nations have altered their Sentiments upon that Affair, even almoſt to Downright Contradiction, they have changed Headbands, as we ſay, for <hi>England</hi> till of late never thought it worth their pains of Treating with us; the good Bargain they made at the Beginning, they reſolve to keep, and that which we call an Incorporating Union was not ſo much as in their thoughts. The firſt Notice they ſeem'd to take of us, was in our Affair of <hi>Caledonia,</hi> when they had moſt effectually broke off that deſign in a manner very well known to the World, and unneceſſary to be repeated here, they kept themſelves quiet during the time of our Complaints upon that Head. In which time our Sovereign, to ſatisfie the Nation and allay their Heats, did condeſcend to give us ſome good Laws, and amongſt others that of Perſonal Liberties and of Peace and War; but <hi>England</hi> having declared their Succeſſion and extended their Intail without ever taking Notice of us; our Gracious Sovereign QUEEN <hi>ANNE</hi> was Graciouſly pleaſed to give the Royal Aſſent to our <hi>Act of Security,</hi> and to give us a hedge to all our Sacred and Civil Intereſts, by Declaring it High Treaſon to endeavour the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of them, as they were then Eſtabliſhed. Thereupon did follow the Threatning and Minatory Laws againſt us by the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament of <hi>England</hi> and the unjuſt and unequal Character of what Her Majeſty had ſo Graciouſly Condeſcended to in our Favours: Now My <hi>Lord</hi> whether the deſire they had to have us ingaged in the ſame Succeſſion with them; Or whether that they found us like a free and independent People breathing after more Liberty than what formerly was lookt after; Or whether they were afraid of our <hi>Act of Security</hi> in caſe of Her Majeſties Deceaſe: which of all theſe Motives has induced them to a Treaty I leave it to themſelves, this I muſt ſay only, they have made a good Bargain this time alſo.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0554400100:328"/>
For the particular Motives that induced us, I think, they are Obvious to be known; we found by ſad Experience, that every Man hath advanced in Power and Riches, as they have done in Trade, and at the ſame time conſidering that no where through the World, Slaves are found to be Rich, though they ſhould be adorned with Chains of Gold, we thereupon changed our Notion of an Incorporating Union to that of a Federal one; and being reſolved to take this Opportunity to make Demands upon them, before we enter into the Succeſſion, we were content to Impower Her Majeſty to Authoriſe and Appoint Commiſſioners to Treat with the Commiſsioners of <hi>England,</hi> with as ample Powers as the Lords Commiſsioners from <hi>England</hi> had from their Conſtituents, that we might not appear to have leſs Confidence in Her Majeſty, nor more narrow hearted in our Act than our Neighbours of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> and thereupon laſt Parliament, after Her Majeſty's Gracious Letter was Read, Deſiring us to declare the Succeſsion in the firſt place, and afterwards to appoint Commiſsioners to Treat; we found it neceſſary to renew our former <hi>Reſolve,</hi> which I ſhall Read to this Honourable Houſe. <q>
                           <hi>Reſolve preſented by the Duke of</hi> Hamilton <hi>laſt Seſſion of Parliament.</hi>
                           <p>That this Parliament will not proceed to the Nomination of a Succeſſor, till we have had a previous Treaty with <hi>England,</hi> in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to our Commerce and other Concerns with that Nation. And furder, it is <hi>Reſolved,</hi> That this Parliament will proceed to make ſuch Limitations and Conditions of Government, for the Rectifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Conſtitution, as may ſecure the Liberty, Religion and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency of this Kingdom, before they proceed to the ſaid Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, <hi>My Lord,</hi> the laſt Seſſion of Parliament having, before they would enter upon any Treaty with <hi>England,</hi> by a Vote of the Houſe, paſt both an Act for Limitations, and an Act for Rectification of our Conſtitution. What mortal Man has reaſon to doubt, the Deſign of this Treaty was only Federal?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>My Lord Chancellor,</hi> It remains now, that we conſider the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of the Lords Commiſsioners at the opening of this Treaty. And before I enter upon that, allow me to make this Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that if our Poſterity, after we are all dead and gone, ſhall find themſelves under an ill made Bargain, and ſhall have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe unto our Records, and ſee who have been the Managers of that Treaty, by which they have ſuffered ſo much; when they read the Names, they will certainly conclude and ſay, Ah! our Nation has been reduced to the laſt Extremity, at the time of this Treaty; all our great Chieftains, all our great Peers and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Men; who uſed formerly to defend the Rights and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0554400100:329"/>
of the Nation, have been all Killed and Dead in the Bed of Honour, before ever the Nation was neceſsitate to Condeſcend to ſuch Mean and Contemptible Terms; Where are the Names of the chief Men, of the Noble Families of <hi>Stewarts, Hamiltons, Grahams, Campbells, Gordons, Johnſtons, Homes, Murrays, Kers,</hi> &amp;c. Where are the two great Officers of the Crown, the <hi>Conſtable</hi> and the <hi>Mariſchal</hi> of <hi>Scotland?</hi> They have certainly all been extinguiſhed, and now we are Slaves for ever.</p>
                     <p>Whereas the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Records will make their Poſterity, Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence the Memory of the Honourable Names who have brought under, their Fierce, Warlike and Troubleſome Neighbours, who had Struggled ſo long for Independency, ſhed the beſt Blood of their Nation, and reduced a conſiderable Part of their Country to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Waſte and Deſolate.</p>
                     <p>I am Informed, <hi>My Lord,</hi> That our Commiſsioners did indeed frankly tell the Lords Commiſsioners for <hi>England,</hi> That the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the People of <hi>Scotland</hi> were much altered of late, in relation to an Incorporating Union, and that therefore ſince the Entail was to end with Her Majeſty's Life, whom GOD long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, it was proper to begin the Treaty upon the Foot of the Treaty the 1604 year of GOD, the time when we came firſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one Sovereign: but this the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſsioners would not agree to, and our Commiſsioners, that they might not ſeem ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, were willing to Treat and Conclude in the Terms laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Honourable Houſe, and ſubjected to their Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>If the Lords Commiſsioners for <hi>England</hi> had been as Civil and Complaiſant, they ſhould certainly have finiſhed a Federal Treaty likeways, that both Nations might have the Choice, which of them to have gone into as they thought fit; but they would hear of nothing but of an intire and compleat Union, a Name which comprehends an Union, either by Incorporation, Surrender or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, whereas our Commiſsioners thought of nothing but a fair equal Incorporating Union; whether this be ſo or no, I leave it to every Man's Judgment; but as for my ſelf, I muſt beg liberty to think it no ſuch thing. For I take an Incorporating Union to be, where there is a change both in the material and formal Points of Government, as if two Pieces of Mettal were melted down into one Maſs, it can neither be ſaid to retain its former Form or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as it did before the mixture. But now when I conſider this Treaty, as it hath been Explained and Spoke to before us theſe three Weeks by paſt, I ſee the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſtitution remaining firm, the ſame two Houſes of Parliament, the ſame Taxes, the ſame Cuſtoms, the ſame Exciſes, the ſame Trade in Companies, the ſame Municipal Laws and Courts of Judicature, and all ours either ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Regulations, or Annihilations: only we have the Honour to pay their old Debts, and to have ſome few Perſons preſent for Witneſſes to the Validity of the Deed, when they are pleaſed to contract more.</p>

                        <hi>My Lord,</hi> I find my Heart ſo full of Grief and Indignation, That I muſt beg Pardon, not to finiſh the laſt part of my Diſcourſe, that I may drop a Tear as the Prelude to ſo ſad a Story.</p>

                        <hi>My Lord Chancellor,</hi> What I am now to ſay, relates to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Proceeding in this Weighty Affair: I hear it propoſed by a Noble Member of the other ſide, that we ſhould proceed in the ſame Order, as the Lords Commiſſioners Treaters did. In my humble Opinion, <hi>My Lord,</hi> It is neither the natural Method, nor can it be done without great Confuſion and Repetition. To ſay, You'll agree to the Union of the two Kingdoms, before you agree in the Terms upon which they are to be United, ſeems like <hi>driving the Plough before the Oxen:</hi> The Articles, which narrate the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, ſeem to be the Premiſſes, upon which the Concluſion is inferred; and, according as they are found good or bad, the Succeſs will follow. When a Man is Married to a Fortune in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as they call it, I ſuppoſe he is ſatisfied with the thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he determines himſelf to Marry; and the Propoſal I have heard of agreeing to the firſt Article with a <hi>Proviſo,</hi> That, if the reſt of the Articles ſhall be found Satisfactory, and no otherwiſe, is of a Piece with the reſt, and looks like Beating the Air, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Conſiſtent with fair and ſquare Dealings. Beſides, <hi>My Lord,</hi> if we were to go upon the firſt Article, are not all the reſt of the Articles, beſides many others not contained in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, valid Arguments either, <hi>Pro</hi> or <hi>Con,</hi> againſt Concluding, or not Concluding the firſt Article? And no Vote in this Houſe, can hinder a Man, from making uſe of what Arguments he thinks fit. Moreover, the Searching the Records, and the Reviſing the <hi>Statute Books,</hi> Comparing <hi>the Books of Rates, Cuſtoms, Exciſe, Taxes,</hi> of both Nations, with one another, muſt all be previouſly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, ere we determine our ſelves in one ſingle Article; Add to this, That the Prohibitory Clauſe, with Relation to the Trade of both Nations, muſt be Adjuſted, leſt, like <hi>Eſop</hi>'s Dog, we loſe the Old, in Graſping at the New; the State of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies muſt alſo be Expoſed, how far we ſhall have Liberty into them, and what Advantage we may propoſe to our ſelves, by Trading to theſe Places, where they are ſecured, and above all, <hi>My Lord,</hi> the Security of our National Church, and of all that's dear unto us, muſt be previouſly Eſtabliſhed to us, if practicable, before we Conclude the firſt Article. Therefore, <hi>My Lord,</hi> tho my particular Opinion be, tho we had a <hi>Cart Blanch</hi> from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> yet the Delivery up of our Sovereignty, gives back with one Hand, what we receive with the other, and that there can be no Security, without the Guarrantee of a Diſtinct Independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy betwixt the Parties Treating: Yet, <hi>My Lord,</hi> for further Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0554400100:331"/>
to this Honourable Houſe, That every Member may fully ſatisfie himſelf, I humbly propoſe, That, paſſing by the firſt three Articles, which appear to be much of a Piece, we begin at the fourth Article of the Treaty, and if I be ſeconded in this, I deſire it may be put to the Queſtion.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall make no Remarks upon this laſt and famous Speech, the Noble Perſon that ſpoke it, however he happened to miſtake in ſome things, was a Perſon of extraordinary Parts and Capacity; And as he was very warm againſt the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it made that Oppoſition the more conſiderable.</p>
               <p>This Speech, the Reader may ſee, was pointed directly againſt the Union, and in the firſt part of it argues againſt the Whole, in the laſt againſt the Parts—; but concludes to move againſt the immediate Proceedings.</p>
               <p>The firſt Speech was from a Perſon no leſs capable in the Matter of the Treaty, and that had been a Commiſſioner in the Treaty at <hi>London;</hi> The Speeches are directly oppoſite, and are left thus upon Record to argue againſt one another.</p>
               <p>The time had been taken up with their length, and the Houſe, as well as the Nation, was, at this time, in an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual Ferment, ſo not many Replies were made. Mr. <hi>Seton,</hi> who made the firſt Speech, ſtood up to Anſwer the Lord <hi>Beilhaven,</hi> but, as he had already ſpoken, the Orders of the Houſe, <hi>viz. That the ſame Member could not ſpeak twice in the ſame Cauſe,</hi> were urged againſt his ſpeaking, and the Earl of <hi>Ma—mont</hi> ſtanding up to ſpeak at the ſame time, the Lord Chancellor gave place to him; who indeed made a very ſhort Return to ſo long a Speech, and which Anſwer occaſioned ſome Laughter in the Houſe: The Earl of <hi>Ma—monts</hi> Speech was to this Purpoſe, <hi>viz. He had heard a long Speech and a very terrible one, but he was of Opinion, it required a ſhort Anſwer,</hi> which he gave in theſe Words, <hi>Behold he Dream'd, but, lo! when he awoke, he found it was a Dream;</hi> This Anſwer, ſome ſaid, was as Satisfactory to the Members, who underſtood the Deſign of that Speech, as if it had been Anſwered Viſion by Viſion.</p>
               <p>After theſe two Speeches, ſeveral Members ſpoke <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con;</hi> But the Debate, in Cloſe of the Day, turned ſo Warm, That, at the Deſire of the Houſe, it was Adjourned to the next <hi>Sederunt.</hi>

               <head>OBSERVATION XV.</head>
               <p>It is very remarkable, That the Addreſſes now began to Throng upon the Houſe, and we find them at the beginning of every Vote; The Debates of this Day viſibly diſcovered the Reaſon and Deſign of procuring theſe Addreſſes, <hi>viz.</hi> That they might form an Argument from the general Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Nation, and from thence, &amp; the bringing the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers into the City, it was called a Cramming the Union down their Throats.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time it was viſible, there were ſuch Methods made uſe of to procure Addreſſes, ſuch want of Hands, ſuch kinds of People who ſigned, ſuch a Paucity of Gentry, where the Counties were full of Gentlemen, and ſuch Varieties of Circumſtances concurring, to make it appear, that it was the labour'd performance of a Party, that, <hi>it was thought,</hi> they met with the leſs regard.</p>
               <p>There were indeed in ſeveral places Addreſſes prepared from the Gentry of the Country for the Encouragement of the Treaty, but it was concluded to be needleſs, ſince that would have been a kind of telling Noſes without Doors, and the Party would have been pleaſed, to have had it paſt for a ſort of Polling the Nation, in which, they having before diſſatisfied and allarm'd the common People, they had the moſt Hopes of Succeſs—; This therefore was laid aſide, as a Step that would be of no uſe, and would put the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon a Tryal altogether inconſiſtent with the Conſtitution, and, as it were, debate it <hi>a-la-Mob.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore none of the Addreſſes on the other ſide were preſented, tho I have the Originals of ſome by me, which were actually ſign'd by the Country Gentlemen, and which were highly Expreſſive of their Aſſent to the Treaty, and of their Reaſons for it, ſome of which were particularly the Danger of Popery, and of Introducing the old Tyranny in the Prince of <hi>Wales.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0554400100:335"/>
Nor can it but be reaſonably ſuppoſed, That had the Noblemen and Gentlemen of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as well in the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament as without, who were Hearty in the Buſineſs of the Union, gone Home, and raiſed their Tenants, Vaſſals, and Dependencies, to have appeared for the Union, either in the Addreſſes, or in the Field, they would, taking it at firſt, as much have Overpowered the other Party without Doors, as they Outvoted them within, ſince it was known, that except the Duke of <hi>At—le,</hi> the principal Number of the Oppoſers, were not Men of the greateſt Intereſt in their Country, I mean as to the Command of their Vaſſals and Attendants.</p>
               <p>But they never brought it to the Extremity of that Tryal, and therefore the Motions of the Party as to General Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, being laid aſide, they found themſelves under a Neceſſity of Struggling in Parliament only.</p>
               <p>The Endeavours of Mobbing the Parliament were ſuppreſt, and the Addreſſes obtained only a Reading, but had no direct Anſwer given them, other than the Proceedings of the Houſe of Courſe, made out; the Thing now to be carried on within Doors was, to load the Treaty with Impracticable Amendments, while the Party without Doors endeavoured on the one Hand, to raiſe Tumults in the Country, bring up popular Addreſſes, and at laſt, down-right Rebellion, as in its place will appear: And on the other Hand, to Diſpleaſe and Diſſatisfie the Miniſters, and bring them to appear publickly Uneaſy; Of which we ſhall ſee further in its place.</p>
               <p>The Debates of this day were very Warm, and ſeveral long Speeches were made, but it was impoſſible to obtain Abſtracts of Speeches, which we could but juſt hear, and I ſhall not venture to Injure, either the Speaker or Hearer, by impoſing my Language upon them, to Expreſs what others ſaid.</p>
               <p>Long Debates were offered to the ſecond part of the Vote above, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Union was Impracticable, that the Joyning of Nations could not be, would tend to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and be neceſſarily broken, as in the Vote. This was raiſed upon the aforeſaid Book of Mr. <hi>Hodges,</hi> and proved evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, that it was not his Hypotheſis, but a Concert of Heads—, and his interfeiring Intereſts were here diſcourſ'd of.</p>
               <p>I am not willing, to Examine into the Inconſiſtencies of ſome peoples Notions, ſtarted here in Matters of Intereſts, and how they raiſed Objections, which were not Grounded on Fact, Eſpecially in Matters of Trade, I bury them in Silence, in reſpect to the Gentlemen; But it was next to Miraculous, to hear Men of ſenſe alledge, That <hi>England</hi> got nothing by her <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Trade, that moſt of her Forreign Trade was Engroſſed by excluſive Companies, that <hi>Scotland</hi>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:0554400100:336"/>
got nothing by Trading with <hi>England,</hi> that <hi>Scotland</hi> could Gain by any Foreign Trade but <hi>England,</hi> and the like; theſe things will more evidently be detected hereafter.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, a Federal Union was offered, <hi>That was underſtood,</hi> any thing but the Right, any thing but the Treaty now begun, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anduſe, could they have obtain'd a Vote againſt the preſent Teaty, the gaining Time for another Parliament had followed, and the Deſign of putting off, or delaying Time, had taken Effect.</p>
               <p>Some Gentlemen, with extraordinary Reaſon and Force of Argument, endeavoured to Explain them the Abſurdities and Inconſiſtencies of that Project, &amp; put the Houſe in mind, that it was not a Federal Union, or a better Union that thoſe Gentlemen deſired, but really no Union at all; And that the Deſign was to Defeat the Endeavours of the Union only, in order to bring in <hi>French</hi> Bondage, and King <hi>James</hi> VIII upon them.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole, the other Party ſoon ſaw in the Houſe, it would go againſt them, &amp; therefore, before it was put to the Vote, the Duke of <hi>A—ole</hi> gave in his Proteſt, as in the Vote, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the whole Party of Oppoſets, on whatſoever prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple they Oppoſed; which Proteſt they had ready Concerted before, expecting, as was ſuppoſed, Things would go as they did, and that they ſhould be Overpowered in the Houſe.</p>
               <p>I can not but Note here, that this great Debate, and on which the whole Weight of the Matter depended, happened on that Famous Day to <hi>Britain,</hi> I mean the very Day on which the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> afterward King <hi>William</hi> came to <hi>England,</hi> and was alſo the Birth-day of that Glorious Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch.</p>
               <p>On the ſame day, now a ſecond time, the Fate of <hi>Britain</hi> had a new Turn, and the ſucceſs of that gave a pleaſant preſage to many obſerving People of the future happy Iſſue of the Thing now in hand.</p>
               <p>The Gentlemen, who let ſlip no occaſion to puzzle the Debates of this Matter, had now conceiv'd great hopes of a Broil among the Miniſters, and were exceeding buſie, to fill the Heads of ſome of the Gentlemen of the Clergy with Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies and Diſſatisfactions—, and yet I can not ſay, they brought in the Overture at this time, tho' they were always forward to puſh on that ſide too.</p>
               <p>I can not ſay neither, that they met with no Encouragement here, or that there were no WarmHeads to be found in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, who apter to take Fire than was to be wiſhed, were more eaſily gain'd, but if there were any ſuch, the Prudence and Moderation of the reſt of the Commiſſion, ſo Over-ruled them, as kept them from any Precipitations, and Contributed greatly to the General Safety; Of which I have ſpoken more largely in its place.</p>

               <p>The Fatigue of the laſt day was ſo great, that both ſides ſeem'd as it were, to take Breath; and little was done to day, except Reading the Church Act.</p>

               <p>I have already given an account of the Birth of this Paper called, <hi>The Repreſentation and Petition,</hi> and the ſeveral Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties it met with in the Commiſſion of the Aſſembly, and which, ſome have ſaid, was a Reaſon, why it met with leſs Encouragement in the Parliament, than was expected, but it may be worth Notice, that notwithſtanding it did not meet with a very kind Reception, ſome of the Gentlemen having been diſobliged in the Caſe of their Proteſt, yet the Houſe did not wholly Omit the Things deſired in it.</p>
               <p>Some of the Gentlemen, who, as Ruling Elders, had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted in the Commiſſion, had it ſeems met with ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Reflections from the Raſhneſs of ſome Members; that was diſobliging enough, and upon which they had withdrawn themſelves from the Commiſſion, and ſeldom, if at all, came there any more during the whole Sitting; And tho' the Raſhneſs of the Perſons who gave thoſe Reflections, was not Approved by the Commiſſion, yet it ſtuck a little too cloſs with ſome People, and it was thought, made them leſs careful of the Application made by the Miniſters in this Caſe.</p>
               <p>Upon the receiving the Repreſentation or Petition into the Houſe, there were no Debates of any Conſequence, it was only Read, and the Act of Security being as <hi>per</hi> the Minutes Adjourned, the other lay by of Courſe.</p>
               <p>The Money Bill now came on, and as the other Party thought the ſpeeding of it might be a Step, to put an End to the Seſſion, they all came into it, and gave it all the diſpatch poſſible.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:0554400100:340"/>
It was apparent, that in order to break up this Treaty, the Gentlemen ſtudied all poſſible Methods to raiſe the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament—, this they could never have done while the Funds remained Unſettled, becauſe it being a Thing of ſuch Conſequence to the Kingdom, the whole Countrey would have laid it at their Door, and the Queen would have had the higheſt Affront put upon both Her Perſon and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment imaginable; And therefore this was one of the firſt Things they puſht at, and that made it paſs immediately with no Oppoſition at all, thoſe Gentlemen complying with it as it was removing an Obſtruction to their General Deſign.</p>

               <p>The Act for Supply was Touched with the Scepter by Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties high Commiſſioner in the uſual manner.</p>
               <p>Thereafter the following Addreſſes were given in and read, <hi>viz.</hi> Addreſs by the Provoſt, Baillies, Town-Council and Burgeſſes of the Burgh of <hi>Forfar</hi> ſubſcribing the ſame.

               <p>Thereafter the Act for Security of the True <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> and Government of the Church as by Law eſtabliſhed within this Kingdom was again read; And upon reading the firſt Clauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, It was moved, that there ſhould be a particular Enumeration made of all the Acts in favours of the Kirk; And after ſome Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning thereon, the Vote was ſtated, <hi>Approve of the Clauſe as it ſtands, or amend and enumerat the Acts,</hi> and it carried <hi>Approve.</hi>

               <p>The Amendments here made to the Act for Security of the Church, make it evident, that the Parliament did not ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſs over that Affair, as ſome people pretended they would do, tho' they did not enter into the Debate of the Inſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy which ſome offered, as Things which tended not to Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Act as it was offered, but to a Rupture of the Debate; for the People who offered at the Inſufficiency of the Act, went upon this Foot; Not that this Overture or Act was an Inſufficient Security, but that really the Union with <hi>England</hi> as an Epiſcopal Nation, was Inconſiſtent with the Safety of the Church of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and that not this Act only was, but any other Act that could be made, would be Inſufficient to ſecure the Church of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This appeared to be the plain Deſign, in that as I have already noted, the Gentlemen that ſpoke Loudeſt for the Inſufficiency of the Act of Security, were not of thoſe People, who really were moſt concerned for the Safety of the Church of <hi>Scotland;</hi> the Objections alſo were not Calculated for Amendments or Additions, but for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the Bill it ſelf, as Built on the ſuppoſition of a Union, which, they ſaid, Was a Foundation that would not bear ſuch a Superſtructure—. And tho' ſome well meaning Men too were of Opinion, that the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> could not really be ſafe in a Union within <hi>England;</hi> yet theſe Gentlemen, as is noted, applyed it purely as an Obſtacle to the Union, and as a Thing by which means, they hoped, to render the Union Univerſally Odious and Terrible to the People.</p>
               <p>And this will be more apparent from the Proteſt entered into, after all the Clauſes were Read, and after all Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that could be reaſonably deſired, were agreed to, as will appear in the next days Minute.</p>

               <p>The reading of the Act of Security having been begun laſt day, ſeveral Amendments were offered, ſuch as firſt the Enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merating the Acts of Parliament upon which it was grounded; This admitted no long Debates, if it had had any Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it would have been granted, but it was generally eſteemed a thing of no value, meerly unneceſſary and trifling, and as ſuch was rejected: The Reaſon given was, becauſe one Act is particularly ſpecified to be ratified by this Treaty, <hi>to wit,</hi> The 4<hi>th Act</hi> of the 1<hi>ſt Parliament</hi> of King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> Intituled, <hi>An Act Ratifying the Confeſſion of Faith, and Settling Presbyterian Church Government,</hi> and then it mentions, <hi>With the hail other Acts relating thereunto,</hi> which was thought ſufficient and full enough.</p>
               <p>The next Amendment was for the Colleges, which was found reaſonable, and was hinted by ſome, who had, not without juſt Cauſe obſerved, how much the Schools of the Diſſenters in <hi>England</hi> are regretted by ſome People, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy the Encreaſe of their Number; And this therefore, as a moſt reaſonable Demand, was immediately agreed to by the the Parliament, and is made part of the Act, as will appear by the Draught of the Bill.</p>
               <p>The Fourth Clauſe had an Objection of greater Moment depending on it, which cauſed long Debates, and was built on a Foundation, however plauſible and juſt in it ſelf, had yet ſuch a known Impoſſibility before it, <hi>morally ſpeaking,</hi> as that no ſmall Hopes were conceived from it, that it would ſhock the whole Treaty.</p>
               <p>All Men know, That, in <hi>England,</hi> by the <hi>TEST ACT, as it is called,</hi> all Perſons that obtain any Office, Civil or Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are obliged to take the Sacrament, according to the Uſage of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and to bring Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the ſame, under pain of Incapacity, among
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0554400100:344"/>
other Penalties: Now it was a moſt plauſible Argument, That, if the Subjects of both Kingdoms were to enjoy equal Privileges, the Subjects of <hi>Scotland</hi> taking the Sacrament in the National Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> ought to be as capable of Places or Offices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the Subjects of <hi>England</hi> taking the Sacrament in the National Church of <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>Nor was this Matter carried a little Way, but became the Subject of infinite Diſcontents without Doors, and of long Diſputes within—; It was ſuggeſted <hi>and printed too, by the ſame Author, of whom mention is already made, as Writing againſt the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> That all the Members of Parliament in <hi>England</hi> were obliged to take the Sacrament before they could ſit in the Houſe, but this, <hi>as falſe in Fact,</hi> was cruſh'd at firſt, ſeveral Accounts being given of its being quite otherways—; But then this Clauſe coming in upon the Neck of that Surmiſe, it was thought a Popular Argument, and indeed was ſo: And the People began to be very uneaſy about it, ſaid the Parliament would give up all to the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> That this was ſo fair a Thing, it could not be argued againſt, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a great many People looked upon the Thing, <hi>viz. taking of the Engliſh TEST,</hi> as what they wiſhed earneſtly enough to have done; but the more penetrating Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſaw further into the Depth of this, and finding it a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign purely ſtrikeing at the Root of the Union, they were the rather inclined to drop it, tho' they at the ſame time deſired it—, the Difficulty lying in this, That the Sacramental Teſt being a thing the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament have been very Tenacious of, upon all Occaſions, this would be to ask ſomething which they knew would not be granted, and conſequently put the Treaty to a Stop.</p>
               <p>Others again propoſed a Reciprocal Teſt to be placed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to ſecure <hi>or exclude all ſuch of the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Nation, as would not acknowlege this Church, &amp;c.</hi> The Tenor of this was according to the following Copy, which they called a <hi>Formula.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> A. B. <hi>do Swear and Declare, That the Presbyterian Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of this Church is a lawful Government, and that I ſhall neither, directly nor indirectly, do any thing to the Alteration thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this alſo dropped of it ſelf, for ſome People that were nevertheleſs againſt the Union; yet were againſt this ſort of Reciprocal Oath, as a thing they did not approve on any Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count one or other.</p>
               <p>there were ſome ſmall Amendments to the Fifth and Sixth Clauſe, but not of Conſequence, and thus this difficult Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was paſt into a Law.</p>
               <p>There were ſome who clamour'd very much on this Head, and a great many perſonal Reflections were made, I will not ſay, altogether without Cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Church was aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by her own Friends, <hi>or at leaſt by thoſe who pretended to be ſo;</hi> That, if they had asked more, it might have been
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0554400100:345"/>
obtained; and that the Demands the Miniſters made, were not duly weighed, <hi>much leſs anſwered;</hi> but yet it ſeems, on the whole, that the main Foundation Article, <hi>viz.</hi> The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhment of the Church Government unalterable, was effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ſecured; and tho' ſome particulars might be omitted, the Church has no open place left, at which her Enemies can wound her Conſtitution.</p>
               <p>There were great Clamours raiſed, both within and without the Houſe, about the Inſufficiency of this Act of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, as that it was <hi>leſſening the Security the Church already had by the Claim of Right,</hi> and not providing an Equivalent Security in the Room of it; That the very Treating of it, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed a further Security was needful, and yet no further Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was provided, than alone confirming the Claim of Right.</p>
               <p>This was the Foundation of the Propoſal of the Reciprocal Teſt, or an Oath to ſecure the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in like manner, as the Teſt Act is for the Security of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Of which above.</p>
               <p>Another Objection was, That tho' indeed the Act of <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> was confirmed, yet, that the Act declaring it to be High Treaſon to Impugn the Claim of Right was not confirmed, nor the other Acts relating thereto ſpecified—; Nor ſome Ancient obſolete Acts taken away, which ſtand unrepealed, and which are inconſiſtent with Presbyterian Government.</p>
               <p>This was Anſwered, particularly as to Enumerating the Acts <hi>as above</hi> and as to Repealing the Acts, the Twenty Fifth Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the Union declares all Acts contraveening this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be ſo far, as they do ſo contraveen this Treaty, <hi>ipſo facto</hi> Repealed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again it was objected, That here was no Proviſion made for Prevention of Miſchief to the Church, for want of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion or Court for Plantation of Kirks, and Valuation of Teinds, which is what the Church will be in great want of.</p>
               <p>This was effectually Anſwered, by ſettling an Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, previous to the Union, for the Plantation of Kirks and Valuation of Teinds, <hi>Impowering the Lords of Council and Seſſion to Judge, Cognoſce and Determine in all Affairs and Cauſes whatſoever, which, by the Laws and Acts of Parliament of this Kingdom, were formerly referred to, and did pertain and belong to the Juriſdiction and Cognizance of the Commiſſioners formerly appointed for that Effect, as fully and freely in all reſpects, as the ſaid Lords do or may in other Civil Cauſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The great and main Objections were againſt the Poſſibility of either Church or State being ſecured ſo by this Treaty, as that a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament might not overwhelm it again by Plurality of Voices, which is a ſuppoſed Conſent.</p>
               <p>This, as the ſame, with the general Objection againſt the Union, was anſwered in the general Terms of the Union,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0554400100:346"/>
                  <hi>viz.</hi> That this was to remain Unalterable for ever, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not be ſuppoſed to be Temporary.</p>
               <p>Upon the Debate of theſe Things its plain, what I have ſo often alledged on theſe Gentlemen, and which therefore is not putting it as my Opinion, which I am not at all forward to offer to the World; but it appears, That the Objection of the Gentlemen did not ſo much ly againſt particular Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, tho' they thought fit to diſpute their Ground by Inches there too, but this Objection lay againſt the general Head, <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> and they brought every Head, as they went thro' them, to ſhock directly with the whole Treaty.</p>
               <p>Thus in the Proteſt given in here by the Lords Diſſenting, it is expreſly ſaid, That the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> can have no real and ſolid Security by any manner of Union, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—as <hi>per</hi> the Minute.</p>
               <p>Alſo it is to be noted here, That the Gentlemen <hi>of that ſide</hi> were the firſt who Moved to Print the Names of all thoſe that Voted to the firſt Article, <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con,</hi> which was thought at that time a day, an Expoſing the Perſons to the popular Reſentment, the Tumults of the People beginning to be at that time very high.</p>
               <p>But the other Party, who had agreed voluntarily to the, ſaid Printing of Names, took the Advantage now, and Mov'd, That the ſame might be done alſo, in the Vote about the Church, by which the Epiſcopal Party were brought in, proteſting in behalf of the Church: The Gentlemen would have avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, but having been the firſt in putting the like upon the other, they could not ſhun it: This Expoſed them very much, and opened the Eyes of many of the People, when they ſaw ſuch People Voting for the Church, who never own'd the Church in their Lives; and others Voting againſt the Thing, who were conſtant Members of the Church, and had given conſtant proof of their Zeal for the Churches advantage.</p>
               <p>And thus the Act of Security was paſt, and after Engroſſed into the Body of the Articles, as will appear by the Act of Parliament.</p>

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0554400100:351"/>
                        <hi>ANSWER</hi> ſhould be given to this Queſtion, ſave that, <hi>When you come to conſider the reſt of the Articles, you ſhall be ſatisfied on that Demand?</hi> This is a new way of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing, <hi>My Lord,</hi> a Method without Precedent, ranver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Nature; and looks more like Deſign than Fair-Dealing. I profeſs, I think the Huge and Prodigious Rains, that we have had of late, have either drowned out, or found out another Channel for <hi>Reaſoning,</hi> than what was formerly; for by what I can ſee by this <hi>New Method,</hi> the Agreeing to the <hi>Firſt</hi> Article, ſhall be found a ſufficient Reaſon, why we ſhould agree to the <hi>Second,</hi> and the Agreeing to the <hi>Second</hi> for the <hi>Third,</hi> and ſo for all.</p>
                     <p>If there was ever ſuch a Farce acted; if ever Reaſon was <hi>Hudibras'd,</hi> this is the time: Conſult all the Treaties ſince the beginning of the World to this day, and if you can find any one Precedent, I ſhall yield the Cauſe.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall Inſtance, <hi>My Lord,</hi> one for all, and that is, The firſt and worſt Treaty that ever was ſet on Foot for Mankind; and yet, I am ſorry to ſay it, there appears more Ingenuity in it, than in our Procedure: When the <hi>Serpent</hi> did Deceive our Mother <hi>Eve,</hi> he propoſed three Advantages, before he preſum'd to Adviſe her to to <hi>Eat the Forbidden Fruit:</hi> The <hi>Firſt</hi> was taken from the <hi>Sight,</hi> the <hi>Second</hi> from the <hi>Taſte,</hi> and the <hi>Third</hi> from the <hi>Advantage</hi> following thereupon. That from the <hi>Sight,</hi> was inforced by a <hi>Behold, how lovely and comely a thing it is, it's pleaſant to the Eye.</hi> That from the <hi>Taſte,</hi> from a Perſwaſion, that it was Good for Nouriſhment, <hi>it's good for Food.</hi> That from the <hi>Advantage,</hi> it will <hi>make you wiſe, ye ſhall be as the Gods;</hi> therefore, upon all theſe Conſiderations, <hi>Eat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Allow me, <hi>My Lord,</hi> to run the Parallel of this, with Relation to our Procedure in this <hi>Treaty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon the firſt Account that our Nation had, of the Treaty's being finiſhed betwixt the two Nations, People appeared all generally very well ſatisfied, as a thing that would tend to the Removal of all Jealouſies, and the ſettling a good Underſtanding betwixt the two Kingdoms. But, ſo ſoon as the <hi>Articles of the Treaty</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in Print, the very Sight of them made ſuch a Change, as is almoſt inconceivable; they were ſo far from being pleaſant to the Eye, <hi>My Lord,</hi> that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion appears to abhor them.</p>
                     <p>One would think, <hi>My Lord,</hi> That it had been the Intereſt of thoſe, who are ſatisfied with the Thing, to have gone immediately into the Merits of theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Articles which relate to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and to have ſaid, <hi>Gentlemen, be not affrighted with their ugly Shape, they are better than they are bonny; Come, Taſte, come make a</hi>
                        <pb n="65" facs="tcp:0554400100:352"/>
                        <hi>narrow Search and Inquiry, they are good for</hi> Scotland, <hi>the wholeſomeſt Food that a Decaying Nation can take: You ſhall find the Advantages, you ſhall find a Change of Condition, you ſhall become Rich immediately; you ſhall be like the</hi> Engliſh, <hi>the moſt Flouriſhing and Richeſt People of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But our Procedure, <hi>My Lord,</hi> hath been very far from the Prudence of the <hi>Serpent;</hi> for all our Arguments have run upon this blunt Topick, <hi>Eat, ſwallow down this Incorporating <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, tho it pleaſe neither Eye nor Taſte, it muſt go over: You muſt believe your Phyſicians, and we ſhall conſider the Reaſons for it afterwards.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I wiſh, <hi>My Lord,</hi> That our Loſs be not in ſome ſmall manner Proportionable to that of our firſt Parents, they thought to have been Incorporate with the Gods: But in place of that, they were juſtly Expelled Paradiſe, Loſt their Sovereignty over the Creatures, and were forced to Earn their Bread with the Sweat of their Brows.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>My Lord Chancellor,</hi> I have heard a Propoſal, made from the other Side by the Marquis of <hi>Annandale;</hi> That, in place of Agreeing to this <hi>Second Article,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Succeſſion is to be Declared, as a Conſequence of our being United to <hi>England</hi> in one Kingdom, we ſhould immediately go to Intail our Crown upon the Illuſtrious Family of <hi>Hannover,</hi> upon ſuch Conditions and Limitations as are in our own Power to make, for the Security of our Sacred and Civil Concerns. I think, This is the Import of what his Lordſhip gave in, by a Reſolve formerly, and hath told this Honourable Houſe, That he thinks, he acts Conſequentially to his Former declared Principles, and that this is now the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Meaſure, which can ſettle and ſecure the Peace and Quiet of this Nation, and fix a firm Security for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Intereſt, and a perfect Underſtanding betwixt the two Nations.</p>
                     <p>I have alſo heard a Diſcourſe, by his Grace the Duke of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> ſhewing, That ever ſince his Grace had the Honour to be a Member of this Honourable Houſe; he had made it his Buſineſs to ſerve the Sovereign and his Nation faithfully and honeſtly, without any By-Ends, By-Views, or Self-Intereſts; That before the Affair of the Succeſſion was Tabled in <hi>Scotland,</hi> he had endeavoured to promote the Intereſt of his Nation, by Good Laws, and by the beſt Counſels he was capable to give, for rectifying Things amiſs, and advancing the ſolid Intereſt of his Country; That ſince the Affair of the Succeſſion came to be Conſidered, he could never give himſelf the Liberty to believe, but that previous to any Settlement, we ought to have had ſuch Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſions
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0554400100:353"/>
with Relation to Trade and Commerce from <hi>England,</hi> as might Retrieve the Loſſes the, Nation hath ſuſtained from them, ever ſince the Union of the Two Crowns under one Sovereign; and that thereupon, to prevent all Faction and Party in the Treating of an Affair of ſuch Importance, he had freely left the Nomination of the Lords Commiſſioners to Her Majeſty, and wiſhes the Choice had been Anſwerable to his Deſign: But none can accuſe him as Bargaining for himſelf, ſince he has no Reaſon to Complain of the Breach of any Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation upon that Head; That now having Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Articles of this Treaty lying before us, and the Fatal Conſequences that may follow upon the Finiſhing of an Incorporating Union with <hi>England,</hi> with the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Averſation</hi> that <hi>appears by the Addreſſes from the ſeveral Shires of the Kingdom,</hi> and particularly from <hi>the Addreſs of the Commiſſion of the General Aſſembly, and of the Royal Burrows of</hi> Scotland; he finds it neceſſary to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Thoughts of that Matter, That he was none of theſe who loved to keep Things Looſe and in Confuſion; He had an Eſtate in both Kingdoms, and therefore it was not to be ſuppoſed, he would make uſe only of a Treaty, to throw out the Succeſſion one time; and of the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to throw off the Treaty another time. Therefore to prevent worſe Conſequences, he is content, That in this Parliament, the Succeſſion be Declared and Settled upon the Illuſtrious Princeſs <hi>Sophia</hi> Electoreſs of <hi>Hannover,</hi> and the Heirs of Her Body, upon ſuch Conditions and Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations as ſhall be found neceſſary by this Parliament, to ſecure our Civil Rights and Liberties, the Independency and Sovereignty of the Nation, &amp; the Presbyterian Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Church, as it is Founded upon the <hi>Claim of Right,</hi> and Eſtabliſhed by Law, and whoſe Privileges and Settlement he Reſolves to Support with the Outmoſt of his Power.</p>
                     <p>And therefore, his Grace thinks himſelf Obliged with all Humility in this preſent Juncture of Affairs, to Addreſs himſelf particularly to His Grace My Lord Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner, and to beg of his Grace, That he would be pleaſed to acquaint Her Majeſty with the True State of the Nation, and with the Propoſal made for Allaying the preſent Ferment and Settling a Solid Peace and Good Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding betwixt Her Two Kingdoms, and that a ſmall Receſs may be granted in the mean time, till Her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's Gracious Anſwer come, which, with all Submiſſion, he conceives, will prevent theſe Bad Conſequences, that the further Puſhing on of this Treaty may occaſion. I think, <hi>My Lord,</hi> this is materially what his Grace ſaid, tho' not ſo fully nor ſo well expreſſed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="67" facs="tcp:0554400100:354"/>
Now, <hi>My Lord,</hi> it remains, that I give Account of my ſelf and of my own Opinion of this Affair: All who know me, <hi>My Lord,</hi> know that I have been from the beginning on a Revolution foot; I ventured my Life and Fortune with the Firſt, and I have ever ſince acted Conſequentially to my Principle. It's true I was never a good Courtier under any Reign; becauſe I had a Rule for my Obedience, and never made Obedience my Rule; my Reputation was never ſtained, Nor had I ever any Reproach laid upon me, ſave when I was brought in, Head over Ears, in a <hi>SCOTS</hi> PLOT, <hi>A Plot, very well known, deſign'd to blaſt the Reputation of a Set of People, the beſt affected to the Sovereign, and to the true Intereſt of their Nation, that ever</hi> Scotland <hi>bred.</hi> What my Opinion was with Relation to the Succeſſion is very well known alſo, I lookt upon Limitations with another Eye, than ſome others were pleaſed to do, I was far from Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in Ridicule; Becauſe as all Human Affairs, they are lyable to Alterations, and might be taken off: that Argument proves too much, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently proves nothing at all. Should a Man refuſe to have a good Eſtate ſettled upon him, becauſe he may ſquander it away, and become Bankrupt? Muſt a Good Law be refuſed, becauſe it may afterwards be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed? No, <hi>My Lord.</hi> Where the Power is lodged in our ſelves, we have all Human Security Imaginable for the Thing; It is not ſo, where the Power is lodged in others: therefore I ſhall alwiſe Chooſe that Security, which depends upon my ſelf, preferable to any other.</p>
                     <p>This, <hi>My Lord,</hi> hath Confirmed me, That Limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our own making is the beſt Security; tho I alwiſe thought them not the Full, of what we merited, for the going into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Succeſſion. For Conſidering the Injuries, that we have received from them, we ought to have Reparation upon this Emergent: and I think with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Incorporating with them, they might have given us ſome ſmall Incouragement in our Trade with them, which would have been profitable unto us, and no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of way prejudicial unto them, as I can clearly Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, if there be Occaſion for it: But ſince this is not the proper Place nor Seaſon for ſuch Propoſals, I ſhall go in with the Propoſal made by the Marquis of <hi>Annan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi> and fortified by his Grace the Duke of <hi>Hamilton:</hi> becauſe I think, it is the beſt that we can make of it at this time, the fitteſt Meaſure to prevent Civil Wars, allay the Ferment of the Nation, and far preferable to <hi>this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporating <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> which <hi>as to us in all it's Clauſes</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be <hi>moſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nreaſonable.</hi>

This was a Politick Speech, there appeared ſome ill Nature in it, &amp; a great deal of Satyre upon the Union, but that was the Temper of the Times, and muſt be paſt over on that account; nor ſhall I ſay any thing to it here, the Noble Perſon that made it, acquieſced in the Union freely enough when it was made; as ſhall appear in its place.</p>
               <p>But I can not paſs it over without obſerving, That—this Speech gives Light into ſeveral Things; <hi>Firſt,</hi> It gives a hint at the Suggeſtion that had been made of D— <hi>H—s</hi> aiming at his own Title in all his former Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made againſt the Succeſſion, as well formerly as now, and clears that Noble Perſon from all ſuppoſition of ſuch a thing, by his having offered now to come into the Succeſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It gives a true ſight of the genuine Reaſon of all this ſudden Complyance with the Succeſſion, a Thing which had ſomething very ſurprizing in it, and which, ſome thought, muſt have preſently carried abundance of People from the other Party, the Deſign being, as was afterward publickly own'd, <hi>if poſſible, to Evade the paſſing this Article, as a Branch of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion.</hi> The Caſe was, They were content with the Succeſſion, as an Act of the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſettled and Eſtabliſhed in the Form, neceſſary in that Caſe; but they would not have the Succeſſion brought upon them as the Conſequence of the Union.</p>
               <p>And at laſt, they had this at the Bottom of it all, That if the Succeſſion had been taken, <hi>as it was now offered,</hi> it muſt have been taken in ſtead of the Union, and that had anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the preſent Occaſion, <hi>viz. Diverting the Grand Affair</hi> of the Union.</p>
               <p>But they met with a double Diſappointment in this, <hi>Firſt,</hi> As to offering the Succeſſion in ſtead of the Union, they came too late, ſince the Party who were for the Succeſſion formerly with Limitations, were now come into the Union, as the beſt Scheme of Limitations they could ever hope to attain, and would not go back, finding the Union a better Scheme of Limitation than their own, becauſe it Entitled them to all the Limitations already ſettled in <hi>England,</hi> which they could not but allow, were more and better than any they had propoſed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> or than indeed they could expect to obtain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> They were diſappointed in <hi>the way,</hi> for the <hi>Jacobites who held with them before</hi> in Oppoſing the Union, <hi>broke with them here,</hi> ſince they found themſelves abandon'd by them in the main Article for which they oppoſed the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>viz.</hi> The Tranſpoſing the Crown, as they called it, from the Son of the late King <hi>James;</hi> and if they were obliged to quite the Article of the Succeſſion, the reſt was indifferent to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:0554400100:356"/>
And therefore you find the Proteſt at the End of the Vote of this Day, was directly againſt the Union, tho' it was put <hi>in the uſual Form,</hi> of the former Article of Limitations; ſo theſe things did but increaſe the Diviſion, and weaken the Party that Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the Union, and by that means gave the more Room for thoſe who were for the Union, to carry it; And <hi>thus the Second Article paſt,</hi> which concluded the Settlement of the Proteſtant Succeſſion. And it was to be obſerved, that the ſettling this Article was very ſatisfactory to abundance of People, who were otherwiſe not very well reconciled to the Treaty, and gave a Handle to the Friends of the Union, to bring ſome People to a clearer ſight of their Intereſt, ſince they might ſee the Union was the readieſt way, <hi>and perhaps the only way,</hi> to obtain the Proteſtant Succeſſion, and to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it upon the firmeſt Foundation, and on the beſt Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, a Thing which had been long wiſh'd, and very much ſtruggled for before.</p>

               <head>OBSERVATION XXII.</head>
               <p>The Parliament were all this while Debating the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals of the Treaty, and therefore the Debates were alſo in general: The Work of this Day was not at all debating what Number of Members ſhould be the Proportion of the Parliament, or how, or in what manner they ſhould be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, and the like; but whether <hi>Britain,</hi> as now to be Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhould be Repreſented by one and the ſame Parliament, yea or no.</p>
               <p>The Debates were very long upon this Head; And as, in other Caſes, it had, for ſome Days, taken up part of their Time, in Reading the long Addreſſes of Shires, Burghs and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0554400100:359"/>
Pariſhes againſt the Union; ſo, on this Day, there were ſome very particular ones reſerved, and which ſeemed to be calculated for the Day, in which, according to the Popular Arguments of the Time, the Union was called a Surrendering the Sovereignty of <hi>Scotland</hi> to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I could never indeed ſee any Schemes offered, or learn that there was any ſuch Propoſal, in what manner thoſe that were for reſerving the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> would have formed two ſeparate Parliaments in an United Kingdom; ſo that the Debates of this Day were not of what ſhould be, but of what ſhould not be; and the Uniting the Parliament was objected againſt, but without offering an Alternative of what they would have in the Room of it.</p>
               <p>The principal Arguments made uſe of in this Days Debate were,<list>
                     <item>1. That Uniting the Parliament, was actually giving up the Conſtitution of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item> 2. That it was ſubjecting <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>England.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. That it was dangerous to the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> whoſe Government was to be ſubjected to a Parliament of Epiſcopal Members.</item>
                     <item>4. That it was contrary to the National Oath or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>It is not my Deſign to make Arguments of my own, in order to anſwer them, or to make this Hiſtory a Diſpute, inſtead of a Relation of Fact—: But there having been ſuch loud Clamours againſt the Union in general, and ſuch violent Struggles againſt it in Parliament, it may not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with an Hiſtory, to relate the Foundation on either ſide which they acted upon, and as much of the Argument on both ſides, either <hi>within</hi> the Houſe or <hi>without,</hi> as is uſeful to let the Reader into a true Underſtanding of the Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this Critical Time; and for this Reaſon I have divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Part into the Minutes and Obſervations, the one is perfectly Hiſtorical, the other Explanatory of the Particulars, and I hope I need make no more Apology for the Method.<list>
                     <item>1<hi>ſt,</hi> It was alledged, That this Conjunction of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments was a giving up the Conſtitution; Or, as it was frequently Worded in their printed Addreſſes, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendering the Sovereignty and Independency of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>It was anſwered, This was from a Defect in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Acceptation of the Word <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NION,</hi> as it was now Treating of, and of its full Extent—of the Unions being <hi>CENTERAL</hi> and <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NIVERSAL;</hi> in which it was alledged, That the Union now Treating of was, in the utmoſt poſſible Meaning of the Word, comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of every Good to both; excluſive of all manner of Preference or Diſparity of Parts, abhorring all things In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0554400100:360"/>
or Diminiſhing to either; a full Coalition, a general Incorporation of Nations, of Intereſts, of Power, and of Safety:—A Sameneſs of Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and of Sympathies; becoming one and the ſame Body, with one and the ſame Head, Life, Soul, Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Point and Period; an Union of the very SOUL OF THE NATION, all its Conſtitution, Cuſtoms, Trade and Manners, muſt be blended together, digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and concocted, for the mutual United, Undiſtinguiſh'd Good, Growth and Health of the one whole United Body; and that all the Suggeſtions of ſubjecting or ſurrendering one part to another, were owing to the want of a right Conception, both of the Terms and of the Thing deſigned by the Term <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NION.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>It was urged further, That this extended Signification of the Union excluded all poſſibility of a Separation of Intereſts, or Claſhing of Properties, and that mutual Protection, mutual Increaſe, mutual Improvements were the Conſequences to be expected, not from this or that Circumſtance, Policy or Management, but from the Nature of the Thing.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>One may be ſure theſe things were warmly argued within Doors, when without, the People were in the utmoſt Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and the whole Nation ſeemed as in an Agony, the Enemies of the Union went about Bemoaning <hi>Scotland,</hi> and Sighing, as they called it, for the Dying Conſtitution, and a Noble Lord within, ſtanding up to make a Speech on this Occaſion, but being ſtop'd by the Order of the Day, ſaid Mournfully, It was hard he could not be allowed to ſpeak one Word for their Dying Country—; Theſe and the like Speeches had put the People in the laſt Degree of Concern.</p>
               <p>The Capital Arguments made uſe of on this Occaſion, and made Popular againſt the Uniting the Parliaments, were ſuch as theſe,<list>
                     <item>1. That whatever Agreement is now concluded between the two Kingdoms, will never be binding to the New Parliament.</item>
                     <item>2. That the two Kingdoms effectually ſubject them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the New Parliament, all the Conditions ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated on either ſide to the contrary in any wiſe notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>To this it was Anſwered, That the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament were abſolutely bound up by the Stipulations of this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>reaty; that they being a ſubſequent Power to the two reſpective Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of either Kingdom, had no other or further Power to act, than was Limited them by the Stipulations of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; That all ſubſequent Power is inferior in its Extent to the Power which it derives from; That the Parliament of <hi>Britain</hi> being the Creature of the Union, formed by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0554400100:361"/>
Stipulations between the two ſeparate Parliaments of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> &amp; <hi>Scotland</hi> cannot but be unalterably bound by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions ſo ſtipulated, and upon which it received its Beeing, Name and Authority: The Foundation of a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is this Treaty; to ſay, They will <hi>not</hi> be bound by it, is to ſay, they will pull themſelves up by the Roots: they dye when the Union receives any mortal Wound; they cannot infringe one Article of the Union; they cannot put a Queſtion in the Houſe upon any one Article.</p>
               <p>As to the Objection, That there was a Surrender of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty and Conſtitution, and delivering <hi>Scotland</hi> bound Hand and Foot into the abſolute Diſpoſe of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was Anſwered by way of Queſtion and Anſwer, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other Things, thus,</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is it conſtitutes the Parliament of</hi> Britain?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion.</hi> Let any Man give another Anſwer to it, if he can.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How is it conſtituted?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>By Treaty</hi> between two Nations by their Heads and Repreſentatives, <hi>viz.</hi> the Queen and Parliament of each Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How do they bring it to paſs?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By mutual altering their reſpective Conſtitutions, and forming one general Conſtitution upon a Treaty of Equalities and Equivalents; the Stipulations of which Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are agreed to by the Conſtituent Parts of the ſubſequent Body.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon what Right doth the preſent reſpective Parliaments depend?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Natural Right of the Free-holders of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, which entitles them by the Poſſeſſion of their Lands, to have the free Exerciſe and Power of making the Laws by which they are to be governed.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Does this new Conſtitution deſtroy that Right?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Not at all, but reſerving that Right, which indeed it cannot deſtroy, agrees to limit the Exerciſe of it by ſuch and ſuch Forms, and on ſuch and ſuch Conditions, which Conditions are the Limitations of the Power of the new Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, as being the Act and Deed of the old Parliaments, whoſe Conſtitution was founded on Original Right.</p>
               <p>The next Popular Argument, &amp; which took up much of the Debates of this Day, was, That <hi>the Parliament had not a Power to it into this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion;</hi> Or, as it was Worded in the publick Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes, <hi>That 'tis not in the Power of the</hi> Scots <hi>Government to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude ſuch an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, without a manifeſt Violation of Truſt, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing a manifeſt Act of Injuſtice, Oppreſſion and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Fundamental Rights and Liberties of this Free Kingdom;</hi> and this was the Subſtance of moſt of the Addreſſes preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Parliament.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:0554400100:362"/>
This was Anſwered by Enquiring into the Right Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments had to Leſſen, Enlarge, or Limit the Repreſentative; of which when the Number of Members comes to be Treated of.</p>
               <p>The laſt Argument, and which indeed was made more uſe of without Doors than within, was the Danger to the Church Government of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by the Uniting the Repreſentative; in which it was argued,<list>
                     <item>1. That the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament being chiefly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of Perſons of another Communion, might, when ever they pleaſed, by a Majority of Votes overpowering the <hi>Scots,</hi> Overthrow their Church, introduce Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, and reduce the Presbyterians to a Toleration, or perhaps worſe.</item>
                     <item>2. That there being twenty ſix <hi>Engliſh</hi> Biſhops ſitting in the Houſe of Peers, and who were by this Treaty to continue ſitting there; this was ſubjecting <hi>Scotland</hi> in all its future Laws, to the ſuffrage of Biſhops, and by conſenting to the Treaty in which they were Eſtabliſhed, it was Recognizing and Eſtabliſhing Epiſcopacy, which was to involve the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> in National Perjury, they being obliged by the National Covenant, never to ſubject themſelves to Epiſcopacy, but to their power to Reform the Churches of both Kingdoms.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Suggeſtions indeed had but too much Succeſs Abroad, and were the principal Subject of the ſeveral Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes, ſome of which the Reader may ſee in the Appendix, as a Sample of the reſt.</p>
               <p>The Arguments had their particular Anſwers, too long to inſert here, and are Touch'd in another part of this Work, the general Anſwer is contained in the former Paragraphs, <hi>viz.</hi> the Obligation of the future Parliament to the exact Obſervation of the Treaty, in which the Security of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> was particularly provided for, and left Unalterable for ever—. A Security ſo firm as the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> never enjoyed before from any Civil Government, or Humane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the World.</p>
               <p>As to the Objection about the Covenant, it was indeed mentioned in moſt of the Addreſſes, but it was never menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in Parliament at all; or at leaſt, not ſo as to come to any Debate, or to put any Queſtion upon it; and therefore I refer it to its proper place.</p>
               <p>There were ſeveral long Speeches made on this Article, ſome to ſhew, that it was not in their power to Vote upon it at all, without Conſulting Conſtituents, that the Parliament was a Fundamental of Government, and could not be ſo much as altered, much leſs given up—, and that this Treaty was an entire Surrender of the Conſtitution. It would take up too much Room in this Work, to repeat all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments brought on this Head, or to inſert the Speeches that were
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0554400100:363"/>
made much more to Collect the Arguments brought by way of Anſwer—; But as the following Speech was made on this day, and ſeems to be a full Anſwer to the Main of theſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, I could not omit it, as it was ſpoken by a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man eminently concerned, both in the preſent Debate, and in the Treaty at <hi>London.</hi>

                           <p>Having heard with much Attention the third Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle Debated; I find it lyable with the other Articles of this Treaty, to be put in a falſe or true Light by the Speakers to it, in proportion to thoſe Notions they have of the Nature of this Union: What I am to ſay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, ſhall be to remove ſome Objections, which in my Opinion is the proper Method to ſmooth the way for approving it.</p>
                           <p>The principal Objections are; That the Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives for Shires and Burghs, cannot legally approve this Article, without the Aſſent of their Conſtituents; and that by the Approbation of it, the Sovereignty and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency of this Kingdom, will be ſurrendered to <hi>England.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>My Lord,</hi> To give a diſtinct and convincing Anſwer to the firſt Objection, let us look a little to the Nature of our Conſtitution of Government.</p>
                           <p>Our Government is not a <hi>Poliſh</hi> Ariſtocracy, founded on <hi>Pacta Conventa,</hi> whereby all the Gentry are Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered in their particular Meetings, to preſcribe Rules to their Repreſentatives in a General Dyet.</p>
                           <p>Our Government is not a common Democracy, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by every Subject of <hi>Scotland</hi> may claim a Vote in the <hi>Legiſlature.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Our Government is and has been many Ages paſt, a Limited Monarchy, wherein the Sovereign and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative are the only Judges of every thing which does contribute to the Happineſs of the Body Politick, and from whom no Appeal can legally be made; and this Deſcription is agreeable to Reaſon, to our Law, and to our Hiſtory.</p>
                           <p>Reaſon teaches us, that <hi>Anarchy</hi> is deſtructive to Mankind, and that no Society of People can be well
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0554400100:364"/>
Governed without a Supreme Power, whoſe proceedings are only alterable by it ſelf; <hi>Grotius</hi> ſays (L. 1. <hi>C.</hi> 3. §. 7.) That we call the Supreme Power, whoſe Acts are not ſubject to the Power of another.</p>
                           <p>Our Law is poſitive, that this Supreme Court is ſubject to no Humane Authority, <hi>Act</hi> 130. <hi>P.</hi> 8. <hi>J.</hi> 6. &amp; we learn from our Hiſtory, that the greateſt Alrerations have been made in the Conſtitution of our Government, without Conſulting the People: out of which I humbly offer a few Examples: In the Reign of <hi>Kenneth</hi> the 3d the Monarchy that Originally was Elective, became Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary: In the Reign of <hi>James</hi> 6th the Repreſentation of the Clergy in Parliament was reſtored: In the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the 2d the Prerogative was exalted above its natural Level; and in the year 1698, the King was Dethroned, and the Clergy Expelled this Houſe.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>My Lord,</hi> I have heard aſſerted, that there are Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of Government which cannot be altered by this Houſe, without the Conſent of every <hi>Scotſman:</hi> But where were theſe ſtipulated? Where are they Recorded? Were theſe made by our Forefathers at the firſt Inſtitution of their Government, and have all ſucceeding Parliaments Sworn to their Obſervance? Theſe Queſtions, Methinks, deſerve our Conſideration, before it be aſſerted what is an unalterable Fundamental by this Houſe.</p>
                           <p>As to the Arguments of Sir <hi>George Mackenzie,</hi> and other eminent Lawyers, brought upon the Stage to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port this Notion of Fundamentals; I think they require no particular Anſwer, becauſe any Member who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands the Nature of Government may ſee clearly, that theſe Arguments are founded on Roman Laws Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated for People, as Members of private Societies, and not for perpetual Rules to the Supreme Power of any Nation.</p>
                           <p>In fine, I believe there are no Fundamentals of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in any Nation, which are not alterable by its Supreme Power, when the Circumſtances of Times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire; and whoever is acquainted with Hiſtory may learn, that there are no People at preſent in <hi>Europe,</hi> which in different Ages have not ſuffered variety of Changes in Government. I do indeed acknowledge, there are Fundamentals in Nature, to wit, Liberty and Property, which this Houſe can never deſtroy, without exceeding its outmoſt Bounds of Power, that are always limited to the Publick Good; Nevertheleſs this Honourable Houſe is only capable to Judge of the moſt proper Means of ſecuring theſe Fundamentals: And for my part I ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely believe that no judicious Man will ſay, There is the leaſt danger of our Liberty and Property by an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                              <hi>My Lord,</hi> I come now to the next Objection, That by the Approbation of this Article, we Surrender the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty and Independency of this Kingdom.</p>
                           <p>Theſe words I acknowledge are very long, and may ſound Harmoniouſly in the Ears of the Populace: for my part, I would be ſorry juſt now to have occaſion to ſay, that in Fact, our Supremacy and Independency were Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered the day King <hi>James</hi> got poſſeſſion of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Throne, if at the ſame time I could not affirm, that theſe are again reſtored to us by this Treaty, which was managed with a Decorum &amp; Equality, that became two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent and diſtinct Nations; and not after ſuch a Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine manner as was uſed by Queen <hi>Mary</hi> &amp; the <hi>French,</hi> the 4th of <hi>April</hi> 1554, on which day our Sovereignty was indeed ſurrendered, as may be ſeen in the <hi>Recueil de Traitez,</hi> &amp;c. P. 510.</p>
                           <p>But to put this Queſtion above Controverſie, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive two ways only whereby a Free Nation loſes its Sovereignty and Independency, which are Conqueſt, and a voluntar Surrender of its Rights to another Nation, without any Reſervation.</p>
                           <p>I am ſure no perſon in right Judgment will alledge, That this intended Union is a Conqueſt; Nor can it be called a Surrender, ſeeing the Treaty contains certain and diſtinct Reſervations to both Kingdoms: Nor can I comprehend how either of two Nations, by an entire Union, ſurrenders its Privileges: on the contrair, I agree with the learned <hi>Grotius</hi> (<hi>L.</hi> 2. <hi>C.</hi> 9. §. 9—.) who's Opinion is, That the Rights and Privileges of two diſtinct Nations United, are conſolidated into one, by a mutual Communication of them.</p>
                           <p>Another Objection, <hi>My Lord,</hi> has been moved againſt this Article, which belongs more properly to the 22d Article, and that's concerning the Number of the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives from <hi>Scotland,</hi> to a Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> This Objection I'll endeavour to Anſwer in as few words as the Nature of it will allow.</p>
                           <p>If both Nations are to be repreſented by one Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there muſt be Members from both Nations, and their Numbers muſt be adjuſted by ſome Rule, which can be no other than that Fundamental in the Union of all Societies, whereby Suffrages are computed, to wit, the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0554400100:366"/>
Proportion each Society contributes for the ſupport of the whole: Now, the Union of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England</hi> is but the Union of two great Societies of People, into one Body Politick; So that we have nothing to direct our Forming a true Notion about the Number of the Repreſentative agreed to by this Treaty, on the part of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but the Proportion we are able to contribute for the ſupport of the Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                                 <desc>•…</desc>
                              </gap>nment of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and that has reſpect to the Numbers of our People, to the Extent of our Taxes, or to an Arithmetical proportion betwixt theſe, and thoſe of <hi>England;</hi> All which being duly conſidered, I may be bold to Affirm, that the Repreſentative agreed to by the Commiſſioners for <hi>Scotland,</hi> is more than falls to our Share.</p>
                           <p>Several Authors, who have wrote about the Nature of Society, or the Union of two or more Societies, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to this Fundamental; and <hi>Grotius</hi> (<hi>L.</hi> 2. <hi>C.</hi> 5. § 22.) has two Examples out of <hi>Strabo</hi> relating to it; One is, When <hi>Lybica</hi> United with Three Neighbouring Cities, It was ſtipulated, That each of the Three was to have one Voice, but <hi>Lybica</hi> Two, becauſe it contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted much more to the common Benefite, than any of the reſt: The other Example is, That there were 23 Cities in <hi>Licia</hi> United, whereof ſome had three Voices, ſome two, and ſome but one.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>My Lord,</hi> By the Repreſentative of Sixteen for the Nobility, there's no greater Hardſhip put upon them, than was put upon the ſmall Barons in the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt, who then were of the ſame State with the Nobility, and ſubmitted to the Law for Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency.</p>
                           <p>By the Repreſentative of Fourty Five for the Commons, no prejudice is done to the State of Barons in reſpect of Repreſentation; for if they be Repreſented from every Shire, or at leaſt from the moſt conſiderable Shires, 'tis of no Import, whether every Shire be Repreſented by one or more: And as to the State of Burrows, I'll pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to ſay, That the Retrenchment of their Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation is a Piece of Juſtice done to this Nation, if Property or Taxes be the Rule of Repreſentation.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>My Lord,</hi> So far have I endeavoured to Anſwer the material Objections againſt this Article, not out of any Proſpect to convince the Members againſt this Union, as to fortifie the Judgments of thoſe for it; And I wiſh heartily, That the Conſtituents for Shires and Burghs may have a true Confidence in their Repreſentatives, while they are Accompliſhing this Great and Noble Work of an Union of both Kingdoms, eſpecially conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, That they are bound by Oath to give their beſt

Advices and Suffrages; That they were choſen by themſelves in a free Election; That they have their Families and Eſtates among 'em; That the ſame Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, Property and Religion are common to 'em both; And that the Good or Bad Conſequences of this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, muſt equally affect Repreſentatives and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents.</p>

               <p>The Debates held very long, but at length the Queſtion being propoſed, the Vote was carried with the uſual <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, viz.

               <p>The Lord Chancellor acquainted the Parliament, that laſt Night his Grace Her Majeſties High Commiſſioner, in his Return to the Palace, was Inſulted by a Number of People of the meaneſt Degree with Stones, which was an high Affront both to Her Majeſties High Commiſſioner, and to the Parliament; And therefore moved, that the Parliament may give the neceſſary Orders, not only to find out ſuch as have been guilty as Actors or Abettors therein, but to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the like in time coming; and after ſome Reaſoning on the ſaid Repreſentation and Motion:</p>
               <p>It was agreed, to Remit to the Committee Nominate for Examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Calculation of the Equivalent, to enquire into the Matter of this Inſult; And to endeavour to find out the Actors and Abettors, if any be, with Power to the ſaid Committee to promiſe Indemnities and Rewards for Diſcoveries, and to Seize and Impriſon any Perſon whom they ſhall have ground to ſuſpect to be guilty, as Actors or Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, &amp; to call for the Magiſtrates &amp; Neighbours of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and to Report to the Parliament, what Information and Diſcovery they ſhall make of the ſaid Inſult, or of any former.

alſo, to Report their Opinion, what Meaſures may be proper for preventing the like in time coming, and the Committee appointed to meet the firſt Interval Day of Parliament at nine of the Clock.</p>
               <p>The Parliament did likeways Recommend to the Lord High Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable to proſecute forthwith theſe Perſons, who were Impriſoned on Account of a former Tumult, and ordained the Magiſtrates of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to furniſh what Probation they can, to the Fiſcal of the Conſtables Court, againſt ſuch as were ſo Impriſoned.</p>

               <p>Thereafter it was moved. That the Parliament proceed to the Fourth Article of Union.</p>
               <p>Moved alſo, That, before proceeding to the Conſideration of the Fourth Article, a Clauſe be added to the Third Article in thir Terms, <hi>And that the ſaid Parliament of</hi> Great-Britain <hi>ſhall meet and ſit once in Three Years at leaſt, in that Part of</hi> Great-Britain <hi>now called</hi> Scotland.</p>
               <p>And after ſome Debate thereupon, the Conſideration of the ſaid Additional Clauſe delayed, till the Parliament come to the Twenty Second Article.</p>
               <p>Then the Fourth Article of Union was Read, and after ſome Diſcourſe thereupon, the further Conſideration thereof was delayed till the next <hi>Sederunt</hi> of Parliament, and the Conſideration thereof to be then reſumed previous to all other Buſineſs.</p>

               <head>OBSERVATION XXIII.</head>
               <p>The Affairs of Tumult and Clamour from the Street, I have related in its proper place; yet, as far as it came to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in Parliament, I muſt take notice of it here, but ſhall be the briefer, referring to what is ſaid elſewhere.</p>
               <p>The firſt Rabble had been cruſh'd for ſome time, <hi>as has been obſerved already,</hi> and the Vigilance of the Government had ſecured the Parliament hitherto; But the Inveterate Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the poor ignorant People, impoſed upon by the Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Arguments of the Times, and theſe enlarged upon by the various Pamphlets and Speeches againſt the Union, which were ſpread amongſt them, was very hard to be reſtrained.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Queensberry,</hi> the Queens High Commiſſioner, received divers Affronts in his going to and from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, tho' his Grace did not think worth his while to trouble the Parliament with it, while it was any thing tolerable; But it was now grown to that Height, That not only the Commiſſioners Life was in Danger, but the Publick Peace ſeemed manifeſtly aimed at, and it was very neceſſary to put a Check to ſuch Inſults, leſt the whole might be endangered.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:0554400100:369"/>
The High Commiſſioner had received ſeveral private Intimations of Deſigns to aſſaſinate him, and ſeveral Letters, ſome abuſive and threatning, others pretending to give him Caution to preſerve his Perſon, others directly pretending to inform of the Deſigns, the Time when, Manner how, and Weapons by which he was to be Murdered; whether theſe were real Deſigns, or only Attempts to amuſe, and perhaps diſcourage his Grace in the Diſcharge of his Duty in ſo weighty a Work, was, I believe, never certainly known: But whoever will calmly conſider the Temper of the People at that time, how inflamed by the Artifice of a Party, and how frequently they ſhew'd their Readineſs to have undertaken any Thing, tho' never ſo deſperate, to have broken off this Affair, will wonder, That no Agent of Satan was found hardned enough to have committed that, or any like ſort of Villany.</p>
               <p>Nor did it ſeem that there was any thing wanting, but the meer Courage to venture their Lives in ſuch a Bloody Action, ſince, in the Occaſion which was now brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Houſe, it appeared there were Stones thrown at the Commiſſioners Coach from the Tops of Houſes, ſufficient to have Murdered him, if Providence had not more eſpecially protected both his Perſon, and the Affair in Hand; which, had any ſuch Villany been perpetrated, would, moſt certainly, have all been loſt in the neceſſary Confuſions that muſt have followed.</p>
               <p>For the Readers particular Information of the Temper and Humour of the People at that time, ſome of the Threatning Letters ſent to his Grace the High Commiſſioner, are Printed in the Appendix N. <hi>G xx.</hi> faithfully Tranſcribed from the Original.</p>
               <p>As to the manner of the preſent Inſult offered the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner—, it was thus, Opportunity was taken, upon the length of the Debates that Day, which keeping the Houſe late—, and the Lord Commiſſioner being to paſs the Streets in the Night, the whole length of the City from the Parliament Houſe to the Palace, the Mob took the opportunity of the Darkneſs, a Time proper for ſuch Villanies; Firſt they affronted the Guards, and followed them with Curſes and Opprobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Words, and their Numbers increaſing as they went on, they began to throw Stones at them, which occaſioned ſome little Diſorder among the Horſes, and this at laſt encreaſed to the throwing Stones at the Commiſſioner himſelf, one of which narrowly miſs'd his Perſon.</p>
               <p>The Coachman and Poſtilion, whether <hi>frighted themſelves,</hi> or that the Horſes were unruly, drove a little faſter than uſual down the Street, which put the Guards to a full Trot; and that heartening the Rabble, as if the Guards had fled from them, they Shouted and continued purſuing them with
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0554400100:370"/>
Dirt, Stones, and ſuch ſort of Violence, till they came to the Palace, where the Foot Guards received them, and kept off the Croud.</p>
               <p>Every Body will allow, that conſiders theſe Circumſtances, which I was an Eye Witneſs to, That it was time to put a Stop to this Violence, and to reſtrain a Head-ſtrong Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude thus made Bold and Furious, leſt they ſhould, <hi>as in ſuch Caſes is not uncommon,</hi> run on to more violent Extremes; and therefore the Lord Commiſſioner ordered the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor to Repreſent it to the Houſe, as in the Vote.</p>
               <p>The Motion for the Parliament ſitting once in Three Years was needleſs, for that indeed it was ſettled in the Twenty Second Article for the Firſt Parliament, and eſtabliſhed in <hi>England</hi> by other Laws made there, which were to continue in Force by the Treaty.</p>

               <p>This Article being General, but containing ſeveral Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, it was judged proper to paſs it in the groſs firſt, with a Reſerve for ſuch Clauſes and Branches of Trade, as ſhould come into Conſideration afterward; for otherwiſe theſe Branches of Trade would have been forecloſed, by agreeing to this Article in the full Extent of the Words.</p>
               <p>Theſe Branches came all to be Conſidered in the Debating other Articles, as particularly, when they came to Examine the Affairs of Drawbacks, Bounties on Exportation, Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Reſtrictions in Trade, the ſeveral Cuſtoms, Duties, Equalities and Proportions of Trade; Of which in their Courſe.</p>
               <p>This Reſerve, however, made the Article it ſelf paſs the more readily at this Time, for it was the firſt Article after Voting the Generals, that was Branched out into Particulars, and therefore the Adjourning theſe Particulars was the more acceptable.</p>
               <p>The Debate of the Fifth Article lay only here, the Treaters had Debated about the Time limited for allowing the Ships then in the Hands of the <hi>Scots,</hi> to be free Ships, the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners would have had it been the Time of Ratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Union; The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſſioners inſiſted on it, that it ſhould be the Time of Signing the Treaty; and the Reaſons were good, that otherwiſe People might buy multitudes of Foreign Ships, and have time to furniſh themſelves, and paſs theſe Foreign Built Ships as free Bottoms, in the Terms of the Act of Navigation, to the infinite Damage of the whole Iſland; And this had the more Force with it, in that it could not but be allowed, that it was the great Advantage of this whole Iſland, to encourage the Building, and conſequently the Employing our own Ships—. However, many popular Arguments were uſed to lengthen out the Time, ſuch as, That <hi>Scotland</hi> was not yet in a Condition to Build, and that this would check her Trade, to leave her naked of Ships till ſhe could furniſh her ſelf with Materials for Building; that for
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0554400100:372"/>
the Fiſhing and Eaſt-Country Trade, it was abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to furniſh Foreign Built Ships, till <hi>Scotland</hi> could Build for her ſelf.</p>
               <p>It was alledged, <hi>England</hi> could furniſh Ships, and it was ſo material a Thing to Encourage the Building, and Increaſe of our own Shipping, that <hi>England</hi> would inſiſt upon it, and had reaſon ſo to do.</p>
               <p>However, after long Debating, it was agreed, to lengthen the Term to the Ratifying the Treaty; and this was the firſt Alteration made in the Articles—; But it was referred to the next day.</p>

               <p>The Debate about the admitting the <hi>Scots</hi> Ships as free Bottoms, was now reaſſumed, and the Time limited for the Properties to be made out, was altered from the Time of Signing the Articles, to the Time of Ratifying the Treaty.</p>
               <p>The preſent Diſpute was, Whether it ſhould be the Time of Ratifying the Treaty in <hi>Scotland,</hi> or the Ratification in both Kingdoms—, this Article was Diſputed by Inches, and ſome thought, there was more Nicety uſed here, than was of any Signification; and that therefore it ſeem'd the effect of a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Struggle againſt the Union, where every thing was laid hold on, that either might bring on ſome Alteration they thought <hi>England</hi> could not comply with, or that at leaſt might but cauſe a Diſpute in <hi>England,</hi> or that might ſo gain
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0554400100:374"/>
time, as to avoid having the thing Compleated in the then ſitting Parliament.</p>
               <p>It was well known, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would be very tender of their Act of Navigation, which is the Security of their Trade, and the main Encourager of their Shipping, and the longer this Liberty of purchaſing Ships from the <hi>Dutch</hi> was extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the more Room there would be for Exceptions in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> their Trade being the more expoſed to the bringing in Foreign Bottoms among them.</p>
               <p>And if it be true, as I have ſeen a Minute made of it in Writing—, That the Party had prepared Schemes of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections to be offered in the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> againſt the very Alterations which they themſelves had procured to be made in <hi>Scotland;</hi> If this be true, it will abundantly juſtifie the general Suppoſition I have ſo often hinted at, <hi>viz.</hi> That theſe Objections were rather calculated to delay the Treaty, and overthrow the Union it ſelf, than from any particular Regard had to the Reaſon and Nature of the Thing objected.</p>
               <p>Nothing elſe could be the Occaſion of ſuch ſtrong Struggles for things in themſelves not of any great Advantage to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as in this Caſe of the Ships, of which, it may be noted, That, after that Matter was ſettled, it was hardly known, that one Ship was bought, either in <hi>Scotland</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> with the Deſign of making it Free, as was ſuggeſted.</p>
               <p>However, after long Debate, the middle Courſe was taken, and the Time was extended from the Time of Signing the Articles, as it was Agreed in <hi>London,</hi> to the Time of Ratification in the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi>—, but not to the Time of Ratification in both Parliaments, as was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
               <p>The laſt Propoſal againſt Preſſing of Seamen, was a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Attempt of the kind above mentioned, and a ſeeking an Occaſion to interrupt the main Treaty, ſince no Body could imagine, That ſuch a Clauſe could have paſſed in <hi>England,</hi> all their own Seamen having been lyable to be preſs'd into the Service of the Navy; And both Nations being to enjoy equal Privileges, this had been to put ſuch a Diſadvantage, and ſuch Inequalities upon the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as would have made juſt Complaints in <hi>England,</hi> and have been a ſufficient Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle to the whole, eſpecially when it was remembred, that in <hi>Scotland</hi> there was no want of Seamen, but that on the contrary many Thouſands of their Seamen, for want of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, entered themſelves on Board the Men of War in Foreign Service, with the <hi>Danes, Swedes,</hi> and <hi>Hollanders;</hi> And it would be hard, That they ſhould ſeek a Liberty from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Service, which would now be their own; and at the ſame time, for want of Buſineſs, ſeek Service among Foreigners; it being alledged, That, at this time, there were

16000 <hi>Scots</hi> Sailers in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Service—; This was ſo plain a Caſe, that the Propoſal was rejected, and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle Paſs'd with only the firſt Amendment.</p>

               <p>The Sixth Article of Courſe began the Debates about Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowances, Drawbacks, Prohibitions and Reſtrictions, which, as has been obſerved, were to be equal to all the Subjects—; But <hi>Scotland</hi> finding ſome Difference in the Value and Frequency of Import or Export of Grain, they found a Neceſſity to come into ſome Amendments here too: The Caſe was thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>England</hi> allowed a Bounty to the Exporter of Corn at all times, when the Plenty of Grain kept the Price under ſuch a ſtated Rate; But it was obſerved there was no Bounty on the Exportation of Oats, the Reaſon was, becauſe <hi>England</hi> rather wanted Oats than had them to ſpare, one Seaſon with another.</p>
               <p>On the other Hand, <hi>Scotland</hi> producing vaſt Quantities of Oats, and having a large Trade for the Exporting the ſame to <hi>Norway,</hi> and other Parts, the <hi>Scots</hi> Members inſiſted,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0554400100:377"/>
That a Drawback ſhould be allowed on Oats and Oat Meal Exported.</p>
               <p>Another Caſe alſo required an Alteration, and this reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Ireland,</hi> which Bordering on <hi>Scotland,</hi> could and might eaſily throw in great Quantities of Oats or Oat Meal into <hi>Scotland,</hi> which being cheap in <hi>Ireland,</hi> would leſſen the Conſumption of the Growth of <hi>Scotland;</hi> There was, it ſeems, a Prohibition formerly laid on the Importation of Oats or Oat Meal, but this being taken off by the Union, it was requiſite to make ſome Proviſion, where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Laws was defective, which was thus,</p>
               <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> had, by Act of Parliament, a Duty of Five Shillings Six Pence <hi>per</hi> Quarter laid upon all Oats Import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that they thought was ſufficient; But there being no more Duty on Oat Meal than on Oats, it was alledged, That the <hi>Iriſh</hi> might Import the Oat Meal, and afford to pay the Duty, ſince it was not above half the Value of the Duty of Oats, the Value of the Meal reducing the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>This therefore was provided againſt by this Additional Clauſe, which doubled the Duty upon Oat Meal Imported, by reckoning every Quarter of Oat Meal as two Quarters of Oats.</p>
               <p>The Acts in Favours of the reſpective Burghs were in order to continue to them the ſeveral Impoſitions on Ale and Wine cuſtomary in <hi>Scotland,</hi> or granting them anew, being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally granted for the publick Uſes of the Towns, ſuch as build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or maintaining publick Edifices, Harbours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Juſt as has been practiſed in <hi>England</hi> in the Duties on Coals, as at <hi>London</hi> for building the Churches, at <hi>Yarmouth</hi> for their Pier; or on Ships, as at <hi>Dover</hi> for the Repair of their Harbour, and the like: And this being the laſt Parliament to ſit in <hi>Scotland,</hi> if the Union ſucceeded, and all private Rights be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made perpetual, or to continue to the Times they were Entailed for, this made the Towns the more ſolicitous to have Acts paſſed in their Favours at this time; The Exciſe upon Liquors, <hi>payable to private Hands,</hi> indeed was a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty in <hi>England,</hi> and ſeemed to be a very odd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt at this time, That while, on one Hand, they ſhould be pleading, that <hi>Scotland</hi> could not pay more Exciſe on their Liquor than they did before, at the ſame time they ſhould, on the other Hand, be ſeeking an Additional Duty to be paid to the Burghs—; But the Duty being ſo ſmall as two Pennies <hi>Scots,</hi> which is but ⅙ of a Penny on the Pint <hi>Scots,</hi> which is two Quarts <hi>Engliſh,</hi> it was generally agreed to, and principally forth at it was not extended all over the Kingdom, but only in the few Towns, that having publick Trade to ſupport, and chargeable

               <p>Whereupon it was Moved, That the Sixth Article and Propoſals and Additional Clauſes relating thereto, ſhould be Remitted to the Committee for examining the Calculation of the <hi>Equivalent,</hi> which was agreed to.</p>
               <p>Thereafter it was alſo moved that a further Number of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of each State ſhould be added to the ſaid Committee, and thereupon a Vote was put, <hi>Add or not,</hi> and it carried <hi>add.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then it was moved, that two of each State be the Number to be added, and likeways moved, that the Number of four of each State be added, and after ſome Reaſoning, it was put to the Vote <hi>Two</hi> or <hi>Four,</hi> and it carried <hi>Two,</hi> and the next <hi>Sederunt</hi> of Parliament ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for choiſing the Additional Members.</p>
               <p>Then the Seventh Article of Union was Read, and the Reaſoning thereupon delayed till the next <hi>Sederunt</hi> of Parliament, to be then proceeded upon previous to all other Buſineſs, after choiſing of the Additional Members for the Committee.</p>

The Amendment of <hi>(Drawbacks)</hi> was not ſcrupled, it was included before in the word <hi>Allowances,</hi> but it was ſuch a Triffle, that no Body would Diſpute it, ſeing it contained nothing but what was intended in the Article it ſelf.</p>
               <p>The Amendments offered were many, and the refering them to a Committee was, <hi>no Queſtion,</hi> the beſt Method to come to a Settlement in the ſeveral Particulars; but this may be obſerved, and it was remarkable, that ſuch was the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Objectors in theſe Caſes, and ſo much had they been impoſed upon in Matters of Trade, that they De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded inconſiſtent and impracticable Things, they deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Exemption from Impoſts which no Body paid, they De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Liberty where there were no Prohibitions, and Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities which were already agreed to.</p>
               <p>For Example, Liberty of Exporting Wooll, a Thing on which the whole <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commerce depended, and without a Reſtraint upon which, all their Manufactures would have been Ruin'd, a Thing Impracticable in the Nature of their Trade, and which it was inconſiſtent with Reaſon to expect.</p>
               <p>Then they required Liberty of Exporting Linen Duty free, whereas it was evident, had they conſulted the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Affairs, they would have found, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> gave that Liberty to all the World; And if any Linen was Imported into <hi>England,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Duty it paid there, was allowed back again, upon Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation by Certificate.</p>
               <p>Next, They demanded Liberty to Export their Woollen Goods free of all Duties and Cuſtoms, whereas it was known, <hi>England</hi> had, long ſince, taken off all Duty or Cuſtom upon their Woollen Manufactures for ſeveral Reaſons of Trade, and for the Encouragement of the Poor.</p>
               <p>Again they asked Freedom of carrying their Goods &amp; Cattel into <hi>England</hi> without Cuſtoms and Toll, which it was evident, without any Proviſion, was the Conſequence of the Union; And there could no more remain any Toll, Cuſtom or Duty, on Paſſing and Repaſſing of Cattel or Goods between <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> than there could in either Kingdom, from one County to another.</p>
               <p>But this will further appear, when the Report of the Committee comes to be under Conſideration.</p>

               <head>OBSERVATION XXVIII.</head>
               <p>The Debate of this Article had made much more Noiſe out of the Houſe than it did within, ſome People had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly alarmed <hi>Scotland</hi> with an Apprehenſion, That,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0554400100:382"/>
according to the Words of the Article, <hi>Scotland</hi> was to pay equal Exciſe with <hi>England;</hi> That is, that as the ſtrong Beer or Ale in <hi>England</hi> paid Four Shillings Nine Pence <hi>per</hi> Barrel, ſo muſt the common Beer, then Brewed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> pay the ſame price; And it was manifeſt, that this was the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſeveral Members of Parliament, by their Speeches on this Occaſion in the Houſe, as well as without.</p>
               <p>On the other Hand, others pretended to bring all the Ale Brewed then in <hi>Scotland</hi> down to the Denomination of <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſmall Beer, as being not ſold for more than ſome of the Table Beer in <hi>England</hi> was ſold for, which paid but as ſmall Beer after the Rate of One Shilling Three Pence <hi>per</hi> Barrel.</p>
               <p>I ſhall be very far from offering to make any part of this Hiſtory Officious, in giving an Account of any mean Share the Author had in this Affair, yet I cannot omit relating this part of the Concern which caſually happened to him in this particular; And it may be mentioned for the ſake of the Jeſt it made in the Town, <hi>viz.</hi> That while it was thought well done to have a Share in ſtating the Proportions of the Exciſe, ſeveral Perſons pretended to the Title of being the firſt Contrivers of it; but when afterwards, on ſome Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour raiſed upon the Inequality of the Proportions, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers began to be blamed, and a little threatned <hi>a-la-Mob,</hi> then it was <hi>D. F.</hi> made it all, and he was to be Stoned for it; And afterward, when thoſe Differences appearing but Trifles, were by the Prudence of the Commiſſioner reconciled, then they would willingly have reaſſumed the Honour of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt Formers of this Affair.</p>
               <p>It was indeed no ſmall Difficulty at firſt, how to ſtate a <hi>Medium</hi> between the two Nations; It had been laid down as a Maxim, <hi>That</hi> Scotland <hi>could, by no means, bear the high Exciſes paid for their ſtrong Beer in</hi> England; It was alſo abſolutely neceſſary to regard doing Juſtice to <hi>England,</hi> who, paying Four Shillings Nine Pence <hi>per</hi> Barrel Exciſe, would have had a great Hardſhip, if <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould have had all their Beer as <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſmall Beer.</p>
               <p>Again, the <hi>Scots</hi> Ale which was ſold in the Publick Houſes, and commonly called <hi>TIPPONY,</hi> was in no Proportion like the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſtrong Beer, either in Price or in Strength, being fold for one Penny the <hi>Chappin,</hi> which was near the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Quart, by Retail, after paying a ſubſequent Exciſe to the Cities or Burghs, and not one Half, or above one Third as ſtrong as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ale or ſtrong Beer. Upon this I ſhall impartially ſet down the Matter of Fact.</p>
               <p>The Author of this being ſent for by the Committee of Parliament then ſitting, <hi>the ſame to whom the Sixth Article was committed, as is above ſaid,</hi> attended them at their Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Lord <hi>Ceſnock</hi>'s Chamber; And being called in,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0554400100:383"/>
the Committee did him the Honour to tell him, they were informed he had ſpent ſome Thoughts on the Affair of the Exciſes, and that he had made ſome Calculations; They told him, the Parliament were coming upon the Debate of the Seventh Article, and the great Difficulty before them was, to find out a <hi>Medium</hi> between the <hi>Scots</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, ſo as might make it tolerable to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and not give <hi>England</hi> Reaſon to take Umbrage, or complain of Injuſtice.</p>
               <p>He frankly owned, he thought it would be very hard, and propoſed what he had formerly inſiſted on, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Scots</hi> Ale or Tippony being ſold for no more Money, than the Houſhold or Table Beer in the City of <hi>London,</hi> which is called Eight Shilling Beer, and is often ſold for Ten Shillings <hi>per</hi> Barrel, the <hi>Scots</hi> ought alſo to pay no more.</p>
               <p>But the Lord Preſident of the Seſſion objected, That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would never be ſatisfied with that Payment, as not being a juſt Proportion; That the Act of Parliament was expreſs, That all Beer above the Price of Six Shillings <hi>per</hi> Barrel ſhould pay as ſtrong Beer; That thoſe kinds of Beer, called Eight Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Beer, were generally Mixtures after the Exciſe was paid; and that the Denomination in <hi>England</hi> being but of two kinds, it would not be poſſible to place this on either Head, and to leave it to the Method of the Eight Shilling Beer in <hi>London,</hi> would be to lay all <hi>Scotland</hi> at the Mercy of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe Officers, which would be unſufferable.</p>
               <p>This Diſcourſe put a Thought in the Authors Head juſt in the Moment, upon which he told their Lordſhips, he thought a Proportion to both Sides might be formed, taking its Riſe from the Price of the Beer, and Value of the Exciſe in either Kingdom, and that he thought, he could form it for them, ſo as that it ſhould not grieve either Party.</p>
               <p>Upon which their Lordſhips deſired him to try, he took the Pen and Ink, and immediately ſtated the Caſe thus,</p>
               <p>There are in <hi>England</hi> but two Denominations of Exciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Beer, ſmall and ſtrong.</p>
               <p>The ſmall was ſuppoſed in the Act at Six Shillings <hi>per</hi> Barrel, and payed One Shilling Three Pence <hi>per</hi> Barrel Exciſe, which is excluded out of the Six Shillings <hi>per</hi> Barrel.</p>
               <p>The ſtrong was ſuppoſed at Eighteen or Twenty Shillings <hi>per</hi> Barrel, and payed Four Shillings Nine Pence Exciſe, which is included in the Eighteen or Twenty Shillings <hi>per</hi> Barrel.</p>
               <p>There is in <hi>Scotland</hi> but one Denomination of Exciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Beer, <hi>which we call, as above for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe ſake,</hi> Tippony.</p>
               <p>This was ſold for about Nine Shillings Six Pence <hi>Sterling per</hi> Twelve <hi>Scots</hi> Gallons to the Retailer, and payed Twenty Three Pence <hi>ſterling</hi> Duty, which is not included in the Nine Shillings Six Pence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> Twelve <hi>Scots</hi> Gallons was ſuppoſed to hold much about the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ale Gauge of Thirty Four Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0554400100:384"/>
there were ſome Fractions or ſmall Differences, which the Committee did not Examine into; Of which by it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Taking then this <hi>Engliſh</hi> Exciſe from Twenty ſhilling <hi>per</hi> Barrel downward to Nine Shillings Six Pence; or from Six Shillings <hi>per</hi> Barrel upward to Nine Shillings Six Pence; and then Calculate the Exciſe from either of theſe Extremes, and the middle ſeemed to be a juſt Exciſe; and this Project had two happy Circumſtances in it, which exactly ſupplyed the Difficulty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For Example.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Price of the <hi>Scots</hi> ſtrong Beer being Nine Shillings Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence <hi>per</hi> Barrel <hi>excluſive</hi> of the Exciſe, and the Price of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Beer <hi>reckoning it at Twenty Shillings</hi> per <hi>Barrel</hi> incluſive <hi>of the Exciſe,</hi> being Fourteen Shillings Three Pence <hi>per</hi> Barrel, <hi>excluſive</hi> of the Exciſe, Nine Shillings Sixpence is to Fourteen Shillings Three pence, as Nineteen to Fourteen Shillings Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.</p>
               <p>Thus,</p>
               <p>9 <hi>ſh.</hi> 6 <hi>d. ſterling</hi> is Pence 114, the Price of the <hi>Scots</hi> ſtrong Beer <hi>excluſive</hi> of the Exciſe.</p>
               <p>14 <hi>ſh.</hi> 3. <hi>d. ſterling</hi> is Pence 171—<hi>Ditto.</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two Thirds of 171, which is 14 <hi>ſh.</hi> 3 <hi>d.</hi> is 114, which is 9 <hi>ſh.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two Thirds of 57 Pence, which is 4 <hi>ſh.</hi> 9 <hi>d.</hi> is 19 <hi>d.</hi> which is the <hi>Medium</hi> of Exciſe this way.</p>
               <p>Again, if you begin at the loweſt Rate of the Exciſe, and the loweſt Price of Beer, and from thence draw the Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upward, then Two Shillings the preſent ſtated Exciſe, is the ſame to Twelve, as Fifteen Pence is to Six Shil. or ſo near it, as they ſell the Beer <hi>incluſive:</hi> So that the difference is of no extraordinary Conſequence; <hi>For Example,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Twelve Gallons <hi>Scots</hi> paying Two Shillings Exciſe, is ſold for Twelve Shilling <hi>ſterling</hi> including the Duty.</p>
               <p>One Barrel <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſmall <hi>Beer,</hi> paying One Shilling Three Pence Exciſe, is ſold at Seven Shillings Six Pence <hi>per</hi> Barrel <hi>incluſive</hi> of the Duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> Two Shilling is One ſixth Part of Twelve Shilling, and One Shilling Three Pence is One ſixth Part of Seven Shillings Six Pence.</p>
               <p>Thus the Exciſe of both Kingdoms ſtands upon the ſame Foot, and are an Exact proportion to one another; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving drawn a rough Scheme of theſe Proportions, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners Ordered them to be laid before them, Finiſhed the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0554400100:385"/>
next Morning, which was done; And the Author had the Honour done him to have them Accepted, which was a full Reward to him, and compleatly ſuited to his Expectations; And they ſtand in the Treaty of Union in his very Words.</p>
               <p>This is put down here, not at all to Value the Merit of the Author upon, but however, to do himſelf Juſtice againſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming Pretenders.</p>
               <p>As to the Miſtake between the Brewers and the Exciſe Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, which fell out afterward in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and which ſome People induſtriouſly ſtrove to blow into a Flame, it is explained in its Place.</p>

               <head>OBSERVATION XXIX.</head>
               <p>The Affair of the Rabbles in the Country came now before the Parliament, for things were come to that Height in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that it was no longer to be Tampered with; The Party who oppoſed the Union had ſo far prevailed upon the People, that they began to break all Bounds; at <hi>Dumfries</hi> the Articles of the Union were burnt at the Market Croſs, by a Number of People in Arms, tho' they were not near ſo many as was Reported at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where they induſtriouſly enlarged thoſe Reports, to Intimidate the Party that was for the Union, and, <hi>if poſſible,</hi> to ſet the Mob in <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to Work again; But the Guards there did their Duty ſo effectually, that there was no more Appearance in the Street, tho' loud Threatnings were made of it.</p>
               <p>As to the Burning the Articles, it was true, That a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of People being got together, did publickly burn the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Union, as concluded at <hi>London,</hi> with the Liſt of the Names of the Commiſſioners of the Treaty, and did affix a Paper upon the Croſs of <hi>Dumfreis,</hi> which they called, <hi>Reaſons for and Deſigns in Burning the Articles, &amp;c.</hi> after having read the ſaid Paper from the Croſs.</p>
               <p>This Paper was afterwards printed, and the Printer being ordered to be apprehended, fled for it till the firſt Heat was over, and then he appeared again, and was not queſtioned for it.</p>
               <p>The Copy of the ſaid Paper is added in the <hi>Appendix</hi> to this Work, <hi>N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. E x.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:0554400100:387"/>
But it is to be noted, That whereas the Paper mentions Squadrons of Foot and Horſe, and the Report was of 5000 and 7000 People, 5000 in Arms that entered the Town, and 7000 in the Hills to ſupport them—; It was all Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, the moſt that appeared in this Action being about 200, and theſe in no ſort of Military Order or Equippage, as I have noted before.</p>
               <p>Yet was this Diſorder improved to a great Height, and particularly as it was improved to make the Government ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, the Weſtern People were reſolved to concern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this Affair, and to take Arms againſt the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; The Parliament was very ſenſible of this, and being very loth to have any Force made uſe of, they tryed all the Methods poſſible, by Proclamations, and publick Repealing the Licence for Muſtering, to take away all Opportunity of Aſſembling together, by which the People might be drawn into the Snare.</p>
               <p>It is obſervable, That even, in the Houſe, there appeared ſome, who were very loth to have theſe Rabbles diſcourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and diſcountenanced; And tho I could give more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Inſtances of it, yet this of Objecting againſt the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the Accounts, viz. <hi>That it did not appear, that there was a particular Information of any Tumultuary Meetings, or Irregular Convocations;</hi> This, I ſay, is a clear Proof of it, for theſe Objectors were openly againſt preventing the Muſtering or Aſſembling the Lieges according to the Act of Security, and gave this Suggeſtion, viz. <hi>Want of Information</hi> for a Reaſon, whereas the Matter of Fact was, That the Lord Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner had real and direct Information of this Affair of <hi>Dumfries,</hi> and of private Emiſſaries gone abroad to excite the People to take Arms, and the reſpective Meetings of theſe Agents or Emiſſaries in the County of <hi>Lanerk,</hi> and elſewhere, more than ſufficient to juſtifie the Precautions mentioned in the Minute.</p>
               <p>Upon this Debate the Proclamation was Voted, and the Act of Security, ſo far as it concerned this Caſe, was repealed, which had various Effects in ſeveral parts of the Country, in ſome places it really cruſh'd and prevented their aſſembling, at <hi>Glaſgow</hi> it irritated and provoked them, and made them more Furious than before—; But generally it had a very good Effect, for it took away the pretence which any of the Lairds or Heads of Clans might have had before, to have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared with the People in Arms, and under the pretence whereof, they might have been exonered in Law, while an Act of Parliament was in Force to protect them, for no Man could ſay, if a Gentleman gathered 100 or 500 Men together, that he had any ill Deſign, and tho' he Arm'd them and Train'd them, and kept them together, he could not be accuſed for any Crime, becauſe the Law allowed him to do ſo,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0554400100:388"/>
under pretence of Arming and Diſciplining the Fencible Men, as Authorized by the Act of Security.</p>
               <p>This appeared therefore ſo neceſſary at this Time, That a Propoſal was immediately brought in to Repeal that part of the Act of Security, at leaſt to Suſpend it for a Time; There was great Oppoſition made to this Propoſal, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Speeches made Applauding the Act of Security, how difficultly it was obtained, and how much of the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Scotland</hi> depended upon it—; But the Motion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeconded with the Neceſſity of the Time, and the Cauſes as above, and withal the Propoſal being made to extend it only to the Time of the preſent Seſſion of Parliament, as <hi>per</hi> the Vote, it admitted the leſs Oppoſition.</p>

               <p>The Debates of this Day were principally taken up about Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing the Clauſe of the Act of Security anent Arming &amp; Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing as before, and great Struggles were made to preſerve the Clauſe, but it look'd ſo like Abetting the Tumults which were now in their Height, that no Man could ſpeak heartily to it, for all Men pretended, at leaſt, to diſowne the Deſign of Rabbling the Parliament, and breaking up their Conſultations by Tumults and Violence, but yet, as far as they could drive it, they oppoſed this Vote.</p>
               <p>At laſt it was carried, and the Act was touched, and is printed in that part of this Work, Intituled, <hi>Of the carrying on the Treaty in</hi> Scotland, <hi>Folio</hi> 74.</p>
               <p>The Paper about Burning the Articles at <hi>Dumfreis</hi> was now cenſur'd, and the Printer, kept out of the way ſome time, but no Proceedings were made on it, only that the Paper was burnt by the Hangman according to the Order.</p>

               <head>OBSERVATION XXXII.</head>
               <p>The Affair of the Malt-Tax came upon the Stage, in the Debate of the Fourteenth Article, becauſe it was but a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Tax in <hi>England;</hi> and therefore was to be Conſidered amongſt theſe Things, which the Parliament of <hi>Great Britain</hi> might hereafter lay Taxes upon.</p>
               <p>The Treaters had Acquieſced in a Suppoſition offered in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> in theſe Words, <hi>That the Parliament of</hi> Great-Britain <hi>could not be ſuppoſed to lay any ſorts of Burdens upon the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but what they ſhall find of Neceſſity at that time for the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and Good of the whole and with due Regard to the Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Abilities of every part of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Kingdom; Therefore it is agreed, that there be no further Exemption inſiſted upon for any part of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Kingdom, but that the Conſideration of any Exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions beyond what are already agreed on in this Treaty ſhall be left to the Determination of the Parliament of</hi> Great-Britain; Upon this Account they did not inſiſt upon Exemptions of Duties any further, than the ſaid Duties were then Extended in <hi>England.</hi> But People were now come a greater length, and they did not care to Truſt the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament ſo far—; They had encouraged all manner of Jealouſies of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, the People had received no Notions, but of <hi>Scotlands</hi> being always Oppreſt by them, both in Civil and Religious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns: And that therefore nothing was to be left to them. That the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament was to be Fenced againſt as a declared Enemy, and the Repreſentatives of <hi>Scotland</hi> being like to be but a Few, <hi>viz. Fourty Five</hi> to Five Hundred and Thirteen, they were to be Cruſhed by Number, Outvoted and Diſregarded in every Thing relating to <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is no more Wonder to be made, that they were for making every Thing ſecure, and ſettling it to Points and Punctilios, who had entertain'd ſuch Notions as theſe; The Malt-Tax therefore being acknowledged Inſupportable in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:0554400100:394"/>
and the Treaters having Determined it ſo, and Exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Scotland</hi> from it, for as long Time as it was now in Force in <hi>England,</hi> the Parliament building upon that Suppoſition, reſolve to Determine the time of the Exemption, that they may be ſure of it.</p>
               <p>It was moved very briskly, That <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould for ever be Exempt from it; but that went not far, as appears in the Vote, ſome were for a certain Term of years, ſome for an Exemption during the War, others for a certain Number of years after the War.</p>
               <p>The Exemption during the War, ſeem'd the moſt rational, becauſe it was known, that the Tax upon Malt was a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Tax, given but upon the Emergence of the War, and as the Gentry of <hi>England</hi> were with difficulty brought to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to it, ſo they were not Eaſie under it, and would never ſuffer it to continue after the War, having for that End given it but from year to year, that it might not be entangled with Anticipations, or appropriated to Payments that ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue it; And therefore to Exempt <hi>Scotland</hi> during the War, was a total Exemption in its kind, and ſeemed ſufficient—; This was Oppoſed <hi>a little,</hi> but as being a Point gain'd, thoſe who ſought the Regulation of Conditions only, came freely into it, and ſo it paſſed.</p>

               <head>OBSERVATION XXXIII.</head>
               <p>The Debate of this Day run only upon the Affair men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether they ſhould depend upon the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament maintaining a juſt and equal Regard to the Good of the whole United Iſland after the Union, and that they would have Reſpect to the Circumſtances of every part in their laying on Taxes, or whether they ſhould pin them down in all time coming, that no other Burdens or Taxes ſhould be laid on, than thoſe already mentioned.</p>
               <p>The Suppoſition of the Parliament of <hi>Britains</hi> being par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial againſt <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Repreſentatives of <hi>Scotland</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing few, being oppreſs'd and out-voted, as I have noted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, tho' it was a Popular Notion, and improved to an extravagant Height without Doors, yet it had not obtained ſo, as to be owned in the Parliament, nor indeed could any Man, with juſt Reaſon, have ſuppoſed ſuch a thing; And therefore, to offer at a poſitive Limitation on the Parliament of <hi>Britain,</hi> ſeemed to have ſomething in it very harſh.</p>
               <p>Again it was alledged, That, to Limit the Parliament of <hi>Britain,</hi> not to lay on any other Cuſtoms, Exciſes, Taxes, Duties or Burdens, than thoſe conſented to in this Act, was to take away the Power from the People of <hi>Britain,</hi> to conform their Affairs even to their own Circumſtances, ſince the Time might come, when ſome of theſe Duties might become bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome, that now were not ſo, and others, which now would be burdenſome, might be more for the Publick Service; but to ty the Parliament down abſolutely as in this Clauſe, would be to Limit them from making Alterations in the Publick Taxes, tho' apparently for the Publick Advantage, and would in effect take from them that Power, for which they were really conſtituted, <hi>viz.</hi> To Diſpoſe the Peoples Purſes, and Redreſs their Grievances.</p>
               <p>It was long Argued, That the Parliament ought to be Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited in this Caſe, becauſe of the Danger there was of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> being burdened with Intolerable Taxes, and of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Circumſtances of <hi>Scotland</hi> which were allowed to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to bear them; That under the pretence of Alteration of Taxes, Oppreſſive Duties might be laid upon <hi>Scotland,</hi> which, tho' they might be tolerable in <hi>England,</hi> were not ſo here, and they ought to provide againſt them.</p>
               <p>But it was Reſolved at laſt into this, That all future Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies muſt be left to a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, and the Words of the Articles contained a ſufficient Reaſon for ſo doing, <hi>viz. It could not be ſuppoſed, That the Parliament of</hi> Great-Britain <hi>will ever lay any ſorts of Burdens upon the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but what they ſhall find of Neceſſity, at that time, for the Preſervation and Good of the whole, and with due Regard to the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances</hi>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:0554400100:396"/>
                  <hi>and Abilities of every part of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Kingdom; Therefore it is Agreed, That there be no further Exemption inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon for any part of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Kingdom, but that the Conſideration of any Exemptions, beyond what are already agreed on in this Treaty, ſhall be left to the Determination of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of</hi> Great-Britain.</p>
               <p>And thus, with ſome Difficulty, the Clauſe was paſs'd, without any further Amendment.</p>

               <p>Whereupon it was propoſed, to delay the Conſideration of the ſaid Fifteenth Article, until Reports be brought in, in Relation to the Sixth and Eighth Articles, from the Committee, to whom the ſaids Articles are remitted.</p>

               <p>The firſt Queſtion then was, Why <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould concern it ſelf in paying <hi>Englands</hi> Debts at all, and on this Head it is neceſſary to be ſomething large, ſince the Learned Debates on this Head filled the whole Nation, and the Oppoſers of the Union advanced abundance of Objections againſt the very Thing called an Equivalent, in the firſt place, as needleſs and impertinent; That <hi>England</hi> ſhould pay its own Debts, and keep her own Money, and the like; That, to make <hi>Scotland</hi>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:0554400100:398"/>
pay Taxes, and then give her an Equivalent, was doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as to Equalities, for that tho' it might be an Equality, Nationally ſpeaking, it had no Perſonal Juſtice or Equality at all, ſince the private Perſons that ſhould pay it, would never receive any Equivalent for the Injury they received.</p>
               <p>Some Anſwers to this I ſhall ſet down here, as they were argued in the Houſe, and after made publick by an Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Member of the Parliament, now Baron of the Exchequer in <hi>Scotland,</hi> Mr. <hi>Clark</hi> of <hi>Pennycook.</hi>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. That no Communication of the Trade of <hi>England</hi> can be given to the Subjects of <hi>Scotland,</hi> unleſs we are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied to pay equal Cuſtoms and Duties upon Export and Import, and equal Exciſes. The Reaſon is plain, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Merchants reſiding in <hi>Scotland,</hi> would be put in a Condition to Ruine the whole Trade of <hi>England.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. That an <hi>Equality of Exciſes</hi> in both Kingdoms, is as neceſſary as an <hi>Equality of Cuſtoms,</hi> for not only all imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Burdens on <hi>Trade</hi> are to be regarded, but even theſe things which Affect and Influence Trade.</item>
                     <item>3. That tho' a <hi>Federal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> was Practicable between the two kingdoms (as I believe it is not) yet even by that Union, we behoved to undergo the Burden of equal Cuſtoms and Exciſes, otherwiſe there could be no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of Trade.</item>
                     <item>4. That a great part of <hi>the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Cuſtoms and Exciſes</hi> is appropriated towards Payment of their Debts; ſo that the paying of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Debts, and the paying of equal Cuſtoms and Exciſes, are almoſt reciprocal Terms to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie one and the ſame thing, or otherwiſe, that theſe Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms and Exciſes payed after the Union, will be appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated towards paying our own Debts, which is the ſame, as ſhall more fully appear hereafter.</item>
                     <item>5. That theſe Debts (being after the Union, to be called <hi>The Debts of</hi> Great-Britain) are ſo neceſſary and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable Burdens on <hi>Scotland,</hi> that neither by an Incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating or Federal Union with <hi>England,</hi> can <hi>Scotland</hi> be free of 'em, ſince as is ſaid before, they are included and wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up in the very Notion of equal Cuſtoms and Exciſes.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>From theſe Poſitions it follows, That ſince under all ſorts of Union whatſomever, with a Communication of Trade, we muſt be Subjected to <hi>equal Cuſtoms and Exciſes,</hi> and that a great part of theſe is applyed towards Payment of the <hi>Debts of</hi> England, therefore in common Juſtice, a Proviſion behoved to be made to <hi>Scotland,</hi> for re-imburſing what we ſhall be charged on the Score of theſe Debts, which by <hi>this Article of the Treaty,</hi> is called <hi>An Equivalent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Equivalent</hi> is ſo Contrived and Adjuſted, that thereby we cannot properly look on our ſelves as engaged
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0554400100:399"/>
in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Debts, for no Man can be properly ſaid to pay a Debt for another, when the Money is either advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced before hand to the Payer, or at furtheſt, the next Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after it is payed out, which will be <hi>Scotlands</hi> Caſe.</p>
               <p>It was evident that a Communication of Trade was the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and was the cleareſt Advantage on the <hi>Scots</hi> ſide, and moſt Unexceptionable in the whole Treaty; It was impoſſible this Communication of Trade could be E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed, and could be entirely Free, unleſs an Equality of Cuſtoms, Exciſes, and of all ſorts of Payments were ſettled at the ſame Time; So that theſe People who were ſo back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to come into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Debts, were leading into a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the only Advantage, which they themſelves acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged was to be had by the Union.</p>
               <p>The Equality of Exciſes and Cuſtoms being thus abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Debts came to be concerned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Cuſtoms and Exciſes of <hi>England</hi> being appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated as Funds to pay the Intereſts of Annuities, and ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances, the ſame Duties in <hi>Scotland</hi> would of courſe run in the ſame Channel, come into the ſame Charge, and under the ſame Incumbrances, as it could not be otherwiſe, without running Things into all manner of Confuſion.</p>
               <p>The Treaters in <hi>London</hi> had been convinc'd of this, and therefore readily came into it, demanding an Equivalent to <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſuited to ſo much of the <hi>Scots</hi> Revenue, as ſhould be ſo appropriated to the payment of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Debts.</p>
               <p>But it was the hardeſt Thing in the World, to make the People in <hi>Scotland</hi> apprehend it—; Not but that thoſe who were more immediately concern'd in the Debating it, underſtood it well enough; But it ſerv'd as a Handle to Rally the Union, &amp; the Thing being rendred as Intricate to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People as poſſible, that they might be the more moved to Oppoſe it; Theſe Ignorantly running away with a Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that <hi>Scotland</hi> was to pay the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Debts, began to Rage at the Treaters again, and cry out, <hi>They were Sold and Betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> to tell them of an Equivalent, was to ſay nothing, and as, many did not underſtand it, ſo they that did, would not ſeem to underſtand it; the very Word became Proverbial, and was the Jeſt of Converſation, till the Averſion to it ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it in a manner Contemptible. To bring <hi>Scotland</hi> in to pay the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Debts! What was not <hi>Scotland</hi> Poor enough already? Was this the Advantage of the Union! It could not be ſuffered, and the Treaters had Betrayed them: Such Diſcourſe as this was the Subject of the common Peoples Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and the Anſwering them with the ſtory of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent to be paid them, was to tell them ſomething which they neither underſtood, nor entered into the Examination of.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:0554400100:400"/>
It would be very hard to deſcribe, how this kind of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe irritated the poor People, and how they were impoſed upon in the daily Accounts ſpread of this new Wonder, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>The Equivalent,</hi> of which Calculations were made publick, repreſenting, That in a year <hi>Scotland</hi> would Repay all the Money advanced from <hi>England,</hi> by the increaſe of Cuſtoms and Exciſes; &amp; ſo after that Rate, notwithſtanding of the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, <hi>Scotland</hi> would be drawn into an Entail of Taxes for an Hundred Years, to clear off the vaſt Debt of Twenty Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, which <hi>England</hi> was now liable to.</p>
               <p>I ſhall have occaſion to Anſwer this in a ſubſequent Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But I can not but <hi>Note,</hi> That by a due Calculation laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Parliament, it was made very plain, That <hi>England</hi> would be ſo far from being Re-imburſt in a Year, <hi>as above,</hi> that reckoning the common Intereſt of the Money advanced in the Equivalent, with the <hi>Medium</hi> of Years in which great part of the Duties the other People had Calculated from, was to Expire, the Equivalent Advanced in Money to <hi>Scotland</hi> would not be Re-payed in Ninety Years.</p>
               <p>Yet was not all this able to Allay the Prejudices of the People, at the Affair of paying the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Debt, which they run away with ſo eagerly, and ſo univerſally Raged againſt, that had not the Rabbles been in good time Cruſh'd before, and that ſo effectually, that they could not begin again, it was thought this very thing would have Influenced them to a more dangerous Degree than any thing.</p>
               <p>But this was offer'd by degrees, the Work of this Day was only to Debate the firſt Clauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould be intirely free from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Debts, or whether they ſhould come in to the Appropriations of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Duties, accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of an Equivalent, and after a very Warm Debate, the Caſe was carried, as by the Minute.</p>

               <head>OBSERVATION XXXV.</head>
               <p>The Commmittee to whom the ſeveral Articles about Trade were refer'd, began now to make their Reports, and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with the Sixth Article concerning Equalities of Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances and Encouragements, they made their Report about the Allowances on Exporting <hi>Victual,</hi> by which is underſtood <hi>Corn</hi> only, which is commonly called <hi>Victual</hi> in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Allowance here offered by the Committee, was on theſe Conſiderations, It had been uſed in <hi>England</hi> to give a Bounty or Allowance on the Exportation of Grain, to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the Merchant to Export it, being a ſure Rule in Trade, that all the meer Product of the Earth which can be ſpared and Exported Abroad, over and above the neceſſary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the Nation, is clear-Gain to the publick Stock.</p>
               <p>But Oats in <hi>England</hi> had no Allowance or Bounty on the Exportation, becauſe it was generally ſuppoſed, That <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> had never any Quantity of Oats to ſpare more than they Conſumed among themſelves, but were rather alwiſe ready to Buy Oats from Abroad, than to Export them.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, Oats being the principal kind of Grain Sowed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> it was equally neceſſary to Encourage the Exporting of Oats, as it was to Encourage the Exporting Wheat in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this was Anſwered, by telling them, that there was no need of propoſing a Bounty upon the Exportation of Oats, for that <hi>England</hi> would always take off what ever Quantity of Oats they would part with, and to offer a Bounty for Expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of that Abroad, which was really wanted at Home,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0554400100:402"/>
was Abſurd, contrary to the Rules of Trade, and the Nature of the Thing. <hi>Further</hi> it was offered, That ſhould a Bounty be offer'd on the Exportation of Oats, the Out-ports in <hi>England,</hi> who now ſupply <hi>London,</hi> lying ready for the Trade to <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> would ſend all their Oats Abroad, and <hi>London</hi> would not be ſupplyed but upon dear Rates.</p>
               <p>Theſe Arguments prevailed with the Committee as to Oats, but there being a very Gainful Trade carried on from <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>Norway</hi> for Oat-Meal, which it was worth while to encourage, as a Trade that Generally brought into <hi>Scotland</hi> a great deal of Bullion, and Money in <hi>ſpecie,</hi> the Committee thought fit to place a Bounty upon the Exportation of the Oat-Meal, as <hi>per</hi> the Vote, and the ſtate of the Time when the ſaid Bounty ſhould be paid being fix'd, when Oats ſhall be no higher than Fifteen Shillings <hi>per</hi> Quarter, there could be no danger, that the greatneſs of the Export ſhould Influence the Market at <hi>London,</hi> ſo as to make Oats Scarce or Dear, ſince after they came to Fifteen Shillings <hi>per</hi> Quarter, no Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Money could be demanded.</p>
               <p>This was founded upon ſo juſt a Calculation of Equalities in Trade, that it met with no Oppoſition in the Parliament.</p>

               </p>
               <p>And after ſome Reaſoning, it was propoſed to add to the above Report the ſubſequent Clauſe, <hi>viz. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntil more proper and effectual ways be provided by the Parliament of</hi> Great-Britain, <hi>for diſcouraging the Importation of the ſaid Victual from beyond Sea:</hi> And after ſome further Reaſoning, the ſaid ſecond Report was agreed to, And it was put to the Vote, <hi>Add the above Clauſe to the ſaid Report,</hi> or <hi>not,</hi> and it carried <hi>Add.</hi>

               <p>Notwithſtanding what was argued in the Committeee, which I have noted above, and at which I was preſent, having had the Occaſion to make ſeveral of theſe Calculations for the Service of the ſaid Committee: Some Gentlemen in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament inſiſted upon the allowing a Drawback or Bounty Money upon Exportation <hi>of Oats;</hi> but when the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons mentioned above, which had been argued in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, came to be offered in full Parliament, it was ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing, that they ſoon acquieſc'd, and ſo it was carryed without, as <hi>per</hi> the Minute.</p>
               <p>The ſubſequent Reports of the Committee mentioned in this Days Minutes, ſeemed only to add the Authority of the Committees Examinations to what had before been offered in Publick, <hi>viz.</hi> That, after the Union, the Exportation of Linen and Woollen Manufactures would be free, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Manufactures be under no Reſtraint or Regulations, but that either in Tranſporting them to <hi>England,</hi> or Exporting them to Foreign Parts, all was open and free by the Union.</p>
               <p>And this Report of the Committee was a full Proof of what I have all along alledged, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Common People of <hi>Scotland</hi> were intolerably impoſed upon, in the Accounts ſpread abroad relating eſpecially to Trade, and in this in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Scots</hi> Woollen and Linen Manufacture would be ſubjected to ſeveral Reſtrictions and Regulations in <hi>England,</hi> which could not be complyed with.</p>
               <p>This was grounded upon an Office in <hi>England,</hi> granted by Patent ſome Years ſince, which was called the Aulnage, which amounted to no more, than putting a Seal and demanding a Fee upon every parcel of Woollen Manufactures brought to <hi>London,</hi> under pretence of Viewing if they were Marketable—; But this Duty or Fee being a very ſmall Trifle, and the Power of Inſpecting found deficient, it was of no Force at all, and therefore, upon the Committees Examining this, they ſaw no Ground of Objection.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:0554400100:405"/>
The next Objection was about Exportation, and here it is obſervable, That the Oppoſers of the Union had not only ſuggeſted, but openly printed, and expoſed about the Streets ſuch Abſurdities as theſe, That the <hi>Scots</hi> Linen would not be admitted into <hi>England,</hi> but a great Duty would be laid upon it to gratifie the <hi>Dutch;</hi> That great Duties were to be paid upon both Linen and Woollen Manufactures on their Exportation, and the like. Now it was very happy, that theſe things came to be Conſidered and Examined by a Committee.</p>
               <p> For now it was evident,<list>
                     <item>1. That no Duty could be laid on the Tranſporting any Linen or Woollen Goods from <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> which were the Growth or Manufacture of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Article of Communication of Trade having effectually taken off all Impoſitions between the Counties or Shires of all <hi>Great-Britain</hi> equally to all.</item>
                     <item>2. As to the Duty on Woollen Goods, there never was any Duty paid Outward, but what was called the Old Subſidy of Tonnage and Poundage, which was Five <hi>per Cent.</hi> which had been effectually taken off, &amp; that Act Repealed in the Act of Parliament mentioned in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and no Duty at all was paid on any Woollen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture whatever Exported out of <hi>England,</hi> and by Conſequence could not be out of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. All Linen Cloth was ſo free, That the Duty on Cloth Imported to <hi>England</hi> from Foreign Parts, was all drawn back by Certificate on the Exporting it again, in order to encourage the ſaid Exportation, and for Linen Exported made in <hi>Britain,</hi> it was ſo ſmall a Trifle paid, <hi>viz.</hi> Sixpence on Fourty Ells, that it was not worth notice.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>This Report of the Committee put a great Stop to the Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, that had been ſo loud upon the Article of Trade; and when this Vote was made publick, the People began to ſee they were impoſed upon, and that theſe things in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> were miſrepreſented.</p>

               <head>OBSERVATION XXXVII.</head>
               <p>There was a Clauſe in the Treaty for the reſerving all pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Rights, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as <hi>per</hi> the 20<hi>th</hi> Article; Now ſome of theſe private Rights amounted to Exemption from certain Cuſtoms &amp; Exciſes, as particular Privileges to this or that Place or Perſon, as at <hi>Glaſgow</hi> for Encouragement of their Sugar-works, they are Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from paying any Exciſe for the Spirits they Diſtill from the Melaſſes, Bottoms, Scummings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo in ſeveral Towns they were Exempted from ſuch and ſuch Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms—; Theſe were of neceſſity to be Exempted, becauſe by another Article as above, private Rights on both ſides were to be preſerved.</p>
               <p>Now, as this was for <hi>Scotland</hi> on one hand, ſo it was for <hi>England</hi> on another, for the City of <hi>Carliſle</hi> and the Family of Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Muſgrave</hi> had an ancient Right of taking Toll of all the Cattel which paſſed from <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> over ſuch Paſſes or Bridges as they had the Lordſhip of, and theſe by private Rights were actually reſerved.</p>
               <p>But the Committee having demanded here the taking away the Toll, <hi>payed as above,</hi> the private Right on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſide ceaſed; So that what ſeem'd ſolid and confirm'd by the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in one part, was yet Invaded and taken away by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther—. But to Reconcile this Matter, the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> Interpoſed, and when ſome People thought they had now brought their Affair to a Head, and that now the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty muſt break, behold, a <hi>Medium</hi> was found out in <hi>England, viz.</hi> That the Parliament in <hi>England</hi> Bought theſe private Rights of the City of <hi>Carliſle</hi> and of the Family of Sir <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopher Muſgrave,</hi> and giving them an Equivalent for them, they Acquieſced, and all ways were laid open for all manner of <hi>Scots</hi> or <hi>Engliſh</hi> Goods to Paſs and Repaſs without any Toll, Stoppage, or Interruption, whether Cattle or Corn, or any other kind of Goods except ſuch as (<hi>Scotland</hi> being Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from the Taxes of in this Treaty for a Time,) were not to be carried into <hi>England</hi> during that Limited Time, or if they were carried in, were lyable to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Duties as ſoon as they came into <hi>England,</hi> ſuch as Salt, Coals, Malt, Fiſh Cur'd with <hi>Scots</hi> Salt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As is more particularly Explained hereafter.</p>
               <p>Thus the private Rights in <hi>Scotland</hi> were preſerved intire, according to the Treaty, and in <hi>England</hi> alſo, for if they were Invaded by the Treaty, the Subject had ſuch ſatisfaction gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him in Money, as that he appeared willing to Reſign thoſe Rights—, as the City of <hi>Carliſle</hi> for inſtance, who, I think, had Two Thouſand Five Hundred Pound <hi>Sterling</hi> given them, for parting with the Right of Toll upon <hi>Scots</hi> Cattle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:0554400100:409"/>
In this exact Equality, the Sixth Report of the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee about <hi>Scots</hi> Cattle, became as it were ſettled; but it was Objected, That the Parliament might hereafter lay on a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Tax upon the <hi>Scots</hi> Cattle paſſing into <hi>England,</hi> either in Favours of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Cattle, or upon any other ſubſequent Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion which could not be foreſeen; And therefore, the ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lean Cattle from <hi>Scotland</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> being ſuch a conſiderable Article to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and on which the Eſtates of the Northern Gentry did almoſt wholly depend, all their Rents being paid them in Cattle, for which they had no other Vent or Market but their being ſent into <hi>England,</hi> and that any Tax or Toll being hereafter laid on them, might intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put a ſtop to it, and conſequently Impair, and almoſt Ruine the Eſtates of the Gentry and Nobility of <hi>Scotland;</hi> On this Conſideration, it was thought fit by the Committee, to ſecure <hi>Scotland</hi> effectually from ſo much as a Jealouſie or Uneaſineſs about it, by making it a Part of the Union, That <hi>From and after the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, no</hi> Scots <hi>Cattle carried into</hi> England <hi>ſhall be liable to any other Duties either publick or private than the Cattle of</hi> England. This was again an Article of Equality, for the Caſe was, not to Exempt the <hi>Scots</hi> Cattle intirely from any Tax, which the United Parliament might think fit to lay on Cattle in General, if ever the Article of General Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes ſo much talk'd of in <hi>England,</hi> ſhould be offered at; but to bring the <hi>Scots</hi> Cattle upon a Level with all the reſt of the Cattle in <hi>England;</hi> and to provide that <hi>Scots</hi> Cattle, <hi>Qua</hi> Scots <hi>Cattle,</hi> ſhould be under no particular National Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage—; And this was thought Reaſonable on every ſide.</p>
               <p>The Seventh Report of the Committee requires ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication on ſeveral Accounts—, It was true, and no Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion was to be made of it, That <hi>Scotland</hi> having then an open Trade with <hi>France</hi> without Reſtriction, and that their Wooll was under no Prohibition at all, but freely Exported to <hi>France,</hi> or any other Part of the World, and that this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty being by the Union to be abſolutely and intirely Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, the Prices of Wooll in <hi>Scotland</hi> would of courſe very much Fall, and the Gentlemen of the South and Weſt Parts of <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſuch as in <hi>Roxburgh</hi> Shire, <hi>Selkirk, Tweed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi> and <hi>Galloway,</hi> whoſe Eſtates very much conſiſted in the Product of their Sheep, would receive a very ſenſible Blow by it; Tho' it was remarkable that ſome People was for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all <hi>Britain</hi> a worſe Blow, to prevent the Injury done to thoſe Countries, <hi>viz.</hi> To allow Exporting the Wooll, and ſome Warm Debates were upon this Head.</p>
               <p>To Explain this, it was to be Enquired into, under what kind of Influence, and by whoſe Management the Trade of <hi>Scotland</hi> was at firſt laid open, and the Exporting of Wooll permitted in General; This as it produc'd no Effect, but the ripping up old Sores, and reviving Perſonal and Party Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0554400100:410"/>
I ſhall let Fall. But this was certain, That whoever were the the Occaſion of it, the Shipping off the Wooll from <hi>Scotland,</hi> was very Injurious to the publick Advantage of <hi>Scotland,</hi> a Mortal Wound given to the Induſtry of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, diſcouraging all Attempts of Manufacturing among them, which they were now coming into, and which their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of <hi>England</hi> had ſo much been Enriched by: It was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, That the ſmall Exportation they formerly had of coarſe Woollen Manufactures to <hi>Swedeland</hi> and the <hi>Baltick,</hi> was now almoſt brought to a full Stop, and the <hi>Swedes</hi> on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary took their Wooll from <hi>Scotland,</hi> which they had not been uſed to do, by which it was apparent, they having the Wooll, made the Manufactures themſelves, and this was a dead Loſs to <hi>Scotland,</hi> juſt ſo much as the Employment and Labour of their Poor amounted to.</p>
               <p>From this part of National ill Husbandry, no Body could be ſuppoſed to receive any Benefit, except the Exporter and the Wooll Maſter, ſo they call the Gentlemen of <hi>Galloway, Roxburgh</hi> Shire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whoſe Eſtates are very much depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Sheep.</p>
               <p>This being the Occaſion of the Riſing the Prices of their Wooll, and their Advantage being thus begun in the Error and Injury of their Country, it ſeemed to be no National Affair to make good the Loſs that was ſuppoſed now to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen by the Union; which was indeed but reducing Things to where they were before, and taking away that Advantage, which, if the Eyes of their Repreſentatives in former Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments had been open, they had never had, and which it was the great Loſs of the whole Kingdom, that they ever had at all.</p>
               <p>However the Parliament, who, going upon the great Scheme of Equalities ſo often mentioned, appeared willing to make all People eaſy; were ready and forward enough to have an Allowance by way of Equivalent given to the Gentlemen that were Sheep Maſters, and who ſhould be pinched by the falling of the price of their Wooll; but then it was debated, in what manner that Equivalent ſhould be given, for, to give to particular Perſons ſuch and ſuch a Sum of Money, would ſeem partial, and be ſhort of the Deſign; as it would be ſome Perſonal Satisfaction indeed, but no National Satisfaction: The Money given therefore ought to be for the Publick Good; and this could be by no Method ſo exactly ſtated to the Circumſtance, as by appropriating the Money to ſuch Gentlemen, who being Wooll Maſters, would apply that Money to the Manufacturing that Wooll in their own Country; thereby both encreaſing the Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Wooll, and ſetting the Poor of their reſpective Countries to Work—; This Scheme had too much Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in it, and too much of the Publick Good in it to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0554400100:411"/>
nor did thoſe that oppoſed it pretend to object much againſt the Reaſonableneſs of it, but ſtill it was oppoſed, and the Reaſons for which it was oppoſed were manifeſt.</p>
               <p>The Party, who, as I have all along noted, ſought ſome Occaſion or other to break off the Treaty, had now this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod only left, <hi>viz.</hi> To clog the Affair with ſuch Amendments or Alterations, which they knew <hi>England</hi> either would not or could not grant—; Nor did they ſtick in Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on honeſtly to owne, That they did not diſlike the Reaſons of ſeveral Things that they oppoſed, were they conſenting to the Union in general, but they were <hi>againſt the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NION,</hi> and therefore they were obliged to oppoſe the Particulars, in order to oppoſe the General.</p>
               <p>Theſe Gentlemen therefore very warmly argued for a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Exportation of Wooll, and for having it made a Clauſe in the Articles; which, if they had gain'd, they eaſily fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw the Union muſt ſplit upon that Rock, for that <hi>England,</hi> who have made it Felony, and always prohibited the Export of their Wooll under the greateſt Penalties, neither would or indeed could come into it.</p>
               <p>It was urged, this Liberty of Exporting Wooll might be reſtrained to <hi>Scotland</hi> only; That it was abſolutely neceſſary to <hi>Scotland,</hi> for that they could not Manufacture all their Wooll in their own Country; That their Wool was Coarſe, and did not injure the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trade, ſince all their Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures were of Fine Wooll; That, if <hi>Scotland</hi> could not Manufacture their Wooll, nor ſhould be ſuffered to Export it, the Wooll would be of no Uſe, but muſt periſh, and be good for nothing; That the Manufactures now ſet up in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> being chiefly Fine Goods, were generally made of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Wooll, and after the Union, the Wooll from <hi>England</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing generally brought in thither, the Wooll of <hi>Scotland</hi> would be of no manner of Value.</p>
               <p>But theſe Arguments were Anſwered thus, That, to allow the Exportation of Wooll from <hi>Scotland</hi> only, would oblige the Government to keep ſtill on the Borders, an Army of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, to Search and Examine the Paſſage of all Goods paſſing between the Kingdoms, and keep up that Diſtinction of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, which, as to Trade, as well as Government, was to be wholly taken away by the Union—; That, after all, it would be impoſſible to prevent the carrying of Wooll into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and conſequently the Exportation of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Wooll with, or inſtead of <hi>Scots</hi> Wooll.</p>
               <p>In the next place, this would oblige the Government of <hi>Britain</hi> to a ſtrict Prohibition of the bringing any <hi>Engliſh</hi> Wooll into <hi>Scotland</hi> after the Union, leſt the ſame ſhould be Exported, which, after its being in <hi>Scotland,</hi> could not be ſo diſtinguiſh'd as to be prevented; and that this Prohibition would Rob <hi>Scotland</hi> of all that Advantage which it is propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0554400100:412"/>
ſhe ſhall enjoy after the Union, by her People being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the Manufacturing of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Wooll.</p>
               <p>Again, That this would deſtroy all Freedom of Commerce and Communication of Trade between the Kingdoms, that all Veſſels to and from <hi>Scotland</hi> muſt be Viſited and Searched equally with Strangers, and the Face of an Union be ruffled with continued Jealouſies of, and Watchings againſt Clande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine Trade.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, That it was inconſiſtent with the Publick Good of <hi>Scotland</hi> in its Proportion, as much as of <hi>England,</hi> and that it would effectually deſtroy the Hopes of <hi>Scotlands</hi> Encreaſing in Manufactures, and Encouraging her Trade by the Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her Poor.</p>
               <p>As to the Conſumption, it was urged, That <hi>England</hi> was always a Market for Wooll, where it might be ſold without fail, at ſome Price or other; and if the Price was low juſt then, that was but a common Calamity the Effect of the long War with <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> in which they had ſtill a Share with their Neighbours, but that the Wooll of <hi>Scotland</hi> would always ſell as well as the Wooll of <hi>England,</hi> in Proportion to its Fineneſs; And this led of Courſe to the firſt Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, That what Encouragement was poſſible to be given to the Wooll Maſters by the Treaty, ſhould be given them on the Conditions of ſetting the Poor to Work in their reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective Countries, which, in that Caſe, would have this double Advantage, 1. The Employment and Subſiſtence of the Poor; and, 2. The Conſumption of the Wooll at Home, which directly took off the pretended Neceſſity of Exporting it to other Countries, for want of a Vent of it at Home, or their ſending it to <hi>England</hi> to be ſold, as they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it, for little or nothing: How well this Money was paid after the Union, or when paid, how well applyed to the Common Good of <hi>Scotland,</hi> is none of my Buſineſs here to enquire.</p>
               <p>I have been the longer in ſtating this Caſe, becauſe it has been often objected to the <hi>Scots</hi> Members of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, That they were too Forward to comply with the Prohibition of Wooll, and that their Country loſt a great Advantage by it.</p>
               <p>There was a pretended Expedient then offered, about the manner of Diſpoſing the Equivalent to ſuch Perſons, as had ſuch or ſuch certain Quantities of Tarr'd Wooll; but the Reaſonableneſs of the above Propoſal prevailed againſt any other, and therefore it needs not be enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into.</p>

The Committee of Parliament, to whom the Sixth Article of the Treaty was Remitted, having Conſidered the Remit to them, with the Books of Rates both for</hi> Scotland <hi>and</hi> England, <hi>and the ſeveral Acts of Parliament relating thereto, the Schemes or Abſtracts from the Cuſtom-Houſe Books given in to them from the Council of Trade, and the Report thereanent of their Sub-Committee, who, on a Report from them, had compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Cuſtoms and Duties on Export and Import ſettled in</hi> England <hi>with theſe ſettled in</hi> Scotland, <hi>and had calculated the Duties payable in</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>upon Tarr, Tobacco, Iron, Dails, ſingle and double Trees, Lint and Lintſeed, and compared the ſame with the Duties payable upon the ſame Goods in</hi> England, <hi>at a</hi> Medium <hi>of the Three Years, whereof they had the ſaid Abſtracts from the Cuſtom-Houſe Books:</hi> They find, <hi>That, as to the Cuſtoms and Duties on Export and Import in general, the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms in</hi> Scotland <hi>belong to the Crown, and are perpetual, whereas thoſe in</hi> England <hi>terminate at a certain Number of Years,</hi> viz. <hi>About Two Fifteen Parts thereof at</hi> 8th March 1709 <hi>Years, Nine Fifteen Parts thereof at</hi> 1ſt. Auguſt 1710, <hi>about Three Fifteen Parts thereof continue only during Her Majeſties Life, and about One Fifteen Part thereof for Ninety Five Years; And that the Duties upon Exportation, which were granted</hi> 12<hi rend="sup">o</hi> Car. 2.

                  <hi>Calculation can be made, amounts to</hi> 253184 l. 15 ſh. 7 d. <hi>and now payable in</hi> England <hi>to</hi> 413559 l. 8 ſh. 4 d. <hi>and payable in</hi> England <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> 1710 <hi>to</hi> 129640 l. 9 ſh. 8 d.

               </p>
               <p>And after ſome Reaſoning thereon a ſtate of a Vote was offered, <hi>Approve of the Sixth Article of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion as Explained and Enlarged, or Not.</hi>

               <head>OBSERVATION XXXVIII.</head>
               <p>The long Report of the Committee, on this Point of the Cuſtoms is very diſtinct, but may require ſome Explanation, and in order to that, it is neceſſary to enter into the ſhort Hiſtory of the Reaſon of this Calculation.</p>
               <p>Two great Complaints ran through the whole Nation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Subject of Taxes and Trade, 1. That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> clog'd the Trade of <hi>Scotland</hi> with Intolerable Burdens: And 2. That they raiſed their Cuſtoms, and would Gain great Sums of Money from <hi>Scotland</hi> by doing ſo; <hi>For the</hi> Scots <hi>had no Notion of the Equivalent, nor would they for along time after this, entertain any Notion of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In order to clear up the Objections of the People againſt the Cuſtoms, the particular Heads were referred to this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee to Examine.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:0554400100:416"/>
The firſt, were the Duties on Import, which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee obſerved very well in <hi>England,</hi> is always laid higheſt on ſuch Goods as contribute to Luxury, or are Manufactured within the Iſland, the firſt Eſteem'd leſs neceſſary, ſuch as Wine, Brandy, Foreign Linen, Fruit, Druggs, Eaſt <hi>India</hi> Goods, Coffee, Tea, Sugars, Tobacco, Deals, Timber, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Things we might live without, or might ſupply in part at Home; or being willing to have, and being Generally uſed by the Richer ſort of People, the payments are leſs felt. The ſecond, For the Encouragement of our own Poor, who ought upon all occaſions to be Employed; and if any thing which comes from Abroad can be made at Home, that Home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part ought to be Encouraged, by laying high Duties and Impoſts, or perhaps Prohibitions on the like from Abroad, ſuch are the Prohibitions of or high Duties, on wrought Silks, Woollen Manufactures, Bone Lace, Braſil Sugar, wrought Iron, Hats, Glaſs, Printed Callicoes, Pantiles, Earthen Ware, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was now Objected in <hi>Scotland,</hi> That the Cuſtoms there would be very grievous, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Duties on Tar, Tobacco, Iron, Deals, and Timber, Lint and Lint-Seed, would be Intolerable to the Poor, and raiſe the Cuſtoms of <hi>Scotland</hi> to a very great Height.</p>
               <p>The Committee Examined the Proportions of Things, and ſetting the whole upon an Equality, produc'd a very well grounded Concluſion, That the Cuſtoms of <hi>Scotland</hi> would be leſs to be paid after the Union than before; and it gave great ſatisfaction at that time, to thoſe People who were capable of receiving Impreſſions from juſt Calculations, when the Calculations of this Committee really ſtated the Ballance of Trade, for that was eaſie to Draw out of theſe Calculations: It had been offered in the Parliament, (with how little Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, or how much Aſſurance, I ſhall not determine); (1.) That <hi>Scotland</hi> got nothing by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trade. (2.) That <hi>Scotland</hi> were conſiderable Gainers by the <hi>French</hi> Trade.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not Cenſure the People that offered this, as Aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a <hi>French</hi> Union, not an <hi>Engliſh;</hi> for they did not ſtick to owne that, but it is not to the purpoſe here—; I ſhall only conſider the State of the Trade of either King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as it ſtood at this Time, and as it was ſtated to the Parliament.</p>
               <p>The Trade to <hi>France</hi> ſtood thus,<list>

The ſeveral Quantities of theſe, however Uncertain, as the Trade Increaſed or Decreaſed, had nevertheleſs this Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Proportion, That the Wine and Brandy Imported into <hi>Scotland,</hi> did over and above Ballance all the Export out of <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> by above one half Part, the Conſequence of which, was, That the <hi>French</hi> Trade muſt draw away ready Money from <hi>Scotland</hi> for the other Half, beſides all the other Imports from thence, over and above this Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That all the Import from <hi>France,</hi> was meer Luxury and unneceſſary Conſumption.</p>

               <p>Thereafter a Petition of the Salt Owners, Fiſhers of Herring and White Fiſh, and others who make uſe of <hi>Scots</hi> Salt, was given in, craving, That ſuch Amendments might be made to the ſaid Eighth Article of Union, as would put them in an equal Footing with their Neighbours in <hi>England,</hi> with regard to their Salt, and alſo the Freedom of making Salt upon Salt.</p>
               <p>Which being read, after ſome Debate thereon, and upon the above laſt inſert Report of the Committee, the further Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof was delayed till the next <hi>Sederunt</hi> of Parliament.</p>

               <head>OBSERVATION XXXIX.</head>
               <p>The Report of the Committee on the firſt Paragraph of the Eighth Article is printed in the precedent Minute relating to the Duties on Salt—; The payment of equal Duties on Foreign Salt was not objected, but it was argued, That the <hi>Scots</hi> Merchants being poor, and being nevertheleſs obliged to Import large Quantities of Foreign Salt at the proper Times, which muſt ly by till the Seaſon for uſing the ſame, and the Duties being now very large which were to be paid; they might not be able either to advance the Money, or find ſufficient Security for the Duties, as the Law in that Caſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided—; And therefore this Amendment was made for the Eaſe of the Merchant, which was both Reaſonable to the Government, and Eaſy to the Merchant, and took off all pretence of Quarrel upon the Disburſe of Money, or lying out of Stock.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Report upon the Eight Article was founded upon equal Reaſoning: It had been agreed in <hi>England</hi> in the ſaid Eighth Article, That all Fleſh Salted in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and carryed to <hi>England,</hi> or Fleſh Salted in <hi>Scotland</hi> for Victualling Ships or Exportation; ſhould be Forfeited, if Cured with <hi>Scots</hi> Salt—; But this was counted a Hardſhip on ſeveral Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, and <hi>England</hi> being allowed to Cure all ſorts of Fleſh with their own, whether for their own Conſumption, Victual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Ships or Exportation; it ought to be alſo allowed to <hi>Scotland,</hi> by virtue of the Subjects enjoying equal Allowances and Reſtrictions, <hi>Article</hi> VI. Wherefore the Committee made this Amendment, That the <hi>Scots</hi> might Cure Fleſh with their own Salt, provided all Fleſh ſo Cured, that was either ſent for <hi>England,</hi> or uſed in Victualling Ships, or Exported for Sale, ſhould be charged with the Duty on Salt paid in <hi>England,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Third Report upon the Eighth Article concerned the Laws in Force in <hi>Scotland</hi> for Curing and Packing of Herring, White Fiſh and Salmond, which, by this Article, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; Theſe Laws were the 5<hi>th. Act</hi> 3<hi>d. Seſſion</hi> 1<hi>ſt. Parliament,</hi>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:0554400100:421"/>

               <p>But, upon this new Treaty, reſpecting the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Duty on Salt, it was calculated as you ſee in the Minute, That the Salt commonly uſed in Curing a Barrel of Herring, amounted to about Nine Shillings <hi>per</hi> Barrel; And in regard of the Waſting of the Salt, Loſs in carrying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to put it at Ten Shillings <hi>per</hi> Barrel, which fully An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Petition of the Fiſh and Salt Merchants mentioned in the ſame Minute.</p>

               <p>The Report of the Committee laſt day was now only Conſidered, with Relation to the main part of the Queſtion, Whether their Fiſh ſhould be Cured with Foreign Salt only, or not, and it was agreed, it ſhould be ſo.</p>
               <p>It was counted a very great Hardſhip, That the Fiſh Cured in <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſhould not be Cured but with Foreign Salt; ſome People alledging, That the Salt made in <hi>Scotland</hi> would Cure the Herring as well as Foreign Salt—; But it had been found by Experience, That the Fiſh Cured with <hi>Scots</hi> Salt, did not keep, nor was it equal in Goodneſs when it came to Market, which added to the Diſputes which would ariſe in the Article of the Drawbacks, now coming on to be Debated, made the Parliament poſitive in that part, <hi>viz:</hi> That all Fiſh Cured for Exportation, ſhould be Cured with Foreign Salt, without any Mixture of <hi>Britiſh</hi> Salt.</p>
               <p>In giving Drawbacks and Allowances for the Exportati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Fiſh, on Account of the Salt, it had here been impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to come to an Equality, ſince no Officer could have been ſure which had been Cur'd with <hi>Britiſh</hi> Salt, and which with Foreign Salt, and which with a Mixture of either.</p>
               <p>It was then alledged, That the <hi>Dutch</hi> Importing their Salt from St. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bies,</hi> Re-make the Salt, Boyling it again when they come to <hi>Holland,</hi> which they call <hi>Salt upon Salt,</hi> and that their Herring are Cur'd with the ſaid Salt, which being of a finer and ſubtiler Quality than the other Salt, is of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to their ſaid Trade; and that the aforeſaid Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be given to the <hi>Scots</hi> to do the ſame—; But this came to nothing.</p>

alſo a Report brought in from the Committee to whom the ſaid Eighth Article was remitted inſert in the Minutes of the 17th in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, <hi>Number</hi> 39. in theſe Terms; <hi>But in reſpect it appears from the Books of the Royal Fiſherie Company confirmed by Practice, that the Quantity of</hi> 102 1058/1200 <hi>of pound weight</hi> Aver de Pois <hi>of Foreign Salt, which pays eight Shillings and four pence of Duty, is neceſſary for the right Curing and Packing a Barrel of White-Herrings; Therefore, there ſhall be paid during the preſent Allowances for other Fiſhes, for every Barrel of White Herrings which ſhall be Exported, ten Shillings</hi> Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
               <p>And another Report brought in from the ſaid Committee was alſo read, in theſe Terms, <hi>That ſixteen Shillings and eight Pence upon every Barrel of Salmond, ſix Shilling and eight Pence upon every Barrel of Red-Herrings, that two Pound ten Shillings upon every hundred Cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh, Ling, or Haick, of twenty four Inches and upwards, from the Bone in the Finn to the third Joynt of the Tail; one Pound fifteen Shillings</hi> Sterling <hi>for every ſuch Fiſh of the length of eighteen Inches and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and under twenty four Inches, and one Moiety of the foreſaid Allowance for every ſuch Fiſh dryed, commonly called</hi> Haverdens, <hi>of the like Dimenſions (being the Drawbacks allowed by the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Laws upon the Exportation of theſe Fiſhes) are ſufficient Encouragements.</hi>

               <p>And after Reaſoning on the above ſeveral Reports, it being moved a higher Drawback ſhould be allowed upon the Exportati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of White Herring;</p>
               <p>After ſome Debate thereon, the ſaid laſt Clauſe of the Eighth Article of Union was agreed to with this Addition, <hi>That there ſhall be allowed and paid to the Subjects Inhabitants of</hi> Great-Britain, <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the preſent Allowances for other Fiſhes, for every Barrel of White Herrings which ſhall be Exported from</hi> Scotland, <hi>ten Shillings and five Pence</hi> ſterling.</p>

               <p>The Difficulty now lay about ſettling the Drawbacks upon the Exportation of Fiſh—; and the Rule the Committee had gone upon, ſeemed the readieſt way to Determine it, <hi>viz.</hi> They laid the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Drawbacks before them, and Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined then the Quantity of Salt uſed in Curing every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective kind of Fiſh, and then comparing the whole, tryed whether the Drawback allowed was adequate, and proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to the Duty paid upon the Quantity of Salt uſed in the Curing.</p>

               <p>The Herrings indeed they had longer Debates about, and after ſome Reaſonings upon the Waſte of the Salt, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage and other Pretences, They obtained the Allowance of Ten Shillings and Five Pence to be paid to the Exporter, for every Barrel of Herrings Cured with Foreign Salt and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, which was Five Pence <hi>per</hi> Barrel more than the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee had at firſt Determined.</p>

               <p>The Drawbacks propoſed upon Beef and Pork to be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, were now the Subject of Debate, it had been Examined in the Committee, and they finding, That 1.

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0554400100:425"/>
And 2. That the Quantity of Beef and Pork ſo ſalted, and Exported out of <hi>England,</hi> or out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> was very inconſiderable, had Reported, <hi>That there ought to be no Drawbacks upon the Exportation of ſalted Beef and Pork,</hi> as in the Minute of <hi>December</hi> 19th.</p>
               <p>But when this came to be Debated in the Parliament, it was all Unravelled again; Some Gentlemen would have it, That <hi>Scotland</hi> was able to Export great Quantities of Beef, Salted and Cured to Foreign Parts; Nay, ſome had before carried it further, and in their Arguing for a Trade with <hi>France,</hi> had advanced what had never before been heard of, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould ſupply <hi>France</hi> with Beef, as they have formerly been ſupplyed from <hi>Ireland,</hi> and propoſed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Advantages from ſuch a Trade—.</p>
               <p>But theſe Gentlemen were ſoon ſilenced, when it was Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined a little, upon what Conditions, and in what Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties <hi>Ireland</hi> was able to ſupply, and did ſupply, not <hi>France</hi> and our Iſland Colonies only, but were able to ſupply all the Parts of the World, where Beef was Generally Exported—; That at that time Beef in any Quantity was to be bought, ready Cured in <hi>Ireland,</hi> including the Salt and the Cask it was Packed in, at a Half-penny <hi>ſterling per</hi> Pound, and that <hi>England</hi> was ſo convinc'd of this, that they could Export no Fleſh, but ſent their Ships Generally to <hi>Ireland,</hi> to Load Beef for their Iſlands, and that <hi>France</hi> upon all Occaſions, got their Beef, if poſſible, from <hi>Ireland,</hi> for the Victualling their Navys and Merchant Ships—. Again, that the Cattel in <hi>Ireland</hi> were Larger and Fatter than in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and their Quantity ſo great, that <hi>England</hi> was obliged to Prohibit their being brought over thither, otherwiſe they would Over run the three Kingdoms with the Quantity; and that <hi>Scotland</hi> having leſs Quantity of Feeding Grounds, and their Cattel being Generally Leſſer, it was not poſſible that they could ſupply the Quantity of Beef, or any thing near the Price with the <hi>Iriſh;</hi> and that therefore, it could not be ſuppoſed, the Exportation of Beef from <hi>Scotland</hi> could be conſiderable, any more than from <hi>England;</hi> and on this Foot it was that the Committee made their Report, That it was not needful to allow any Drawback upon the Exportation of Beef, <hi>England</hi> at the ſame Time having no Allowances granted in the ſame Caſe.</p>
               <p>But a new Objection turned the Scale—, It was offered by ſome, That in the North Eaſt Parts of <hi>Scotland, viz.</hi> At <hi>Aberdeen</hi> and the Country adjacent, there was a New and very Advantageous Trade, lately Erected for Feeding Swine, which being made Fat with Corn in great Quantities (&amp; that being a Conſumption of the Produce of the Land) the Fleſh was Cured and Salted, Barrelled and Exported to <hi>Holland</hi> for Sale—; And that this was a Trade which ought to be Encouraged. It was added, That this as it was an
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0554400100:426"/>
Advantageous Trade to <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſo it was a Growing Trade, and might in Time increaſe to a very great Degree, the <hi>Dutch</hi> Demanding every year more Quantities than the Country had been yet able to ſupply, that there had been ſeveral years Exported from 1500 to 2000 Barrels of ſalted Pork—from <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>Holland,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> uſing the ſame for Victualling their Eaſt <hi>India</hi> Ships, and other Ships that went upon long Voyages.</p>
               <p>This had ſome appearance of Argument in it, and being puſh'd very heartily at, in behalf of the <hi>Aberdeen</hi> Merchants; brought the Parliament to alter the Report, and agree to an Allowance upon the Exportation of Pork, and afterward of Beef and Pork, the Beef being brought in by the by.</p>
               <p>It had been ſaid, as above, That the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Beef was Exported Cheaper than <hi>Scotland</hi> could afford it—; It was therefore Argued, That <hi>Scotland</hi> ought to have the Drawback allowed on their Beef, to encourage the Exportation, and if poſſible, to ſet them upon an equal Foot with <hi>Ireland,</hi> in the Trade of Exporting Beef, which, tho' it was proved, was not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, yet as the <hi>Affirmative</hi> carried ſome poſſibility, and the <hi>Negative</hi> ſeemed to be of no great Conſequence, the Members came in to it, and they paſſed together.</p>

               <p>Agreed, That the Drawbacks ſhall be Five Shillings <hi>Sterling</hi> for every Barrel of Beef or Pork, and the Clauſe was accordingly ſo Amended and Read.</p>

               <p>The Debates about the Drawbacks on Beef and Pork ended now in a ſhort Queſtion, Whether it ſhould be Four Shillings Seven Pence <hi>per</hi> Barrel, or Five Shillings—; And the Difference being of no great Conſequence, the ſame Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that carryed it before to have any Drawback at all, carryed it now to have that Drawback ſettled at the largeſt Rate of the Two, ſo that Affair ended.</p>
               <p>Then the Houſe proceeded to the Grand Affair, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptions from the Salt Tax in <hi>England</hi>—; Great Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels were raiſed at the Conceſſions made by the Treaters in this Caſe, who had exempted <hi>Scotland</hi> from the Duties on Salt payable in <hi>England</hi> for Seven Years only; whereas it was alledged, That the Salt Tax was a Burden Intolerable for <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that they would no more be able to bear that Duty in ſeven years, than now, and that therefore they ought not to have Subjected <hi>Scotland</hi> to it at all; That it had been allowed, the Salt Tax was a Burden chiefly laid upon the Poor, the Poor People in <hi>Scotland</hi> Feeding much upon ſalt Meats, and uſing great Quantities of Salt—; That to lay a Tax on their Salt, was to aſſiſt in Starving them, and the like—. This was an Argument ſo pleaſing, and ſo much Improved without Doors, that it made the Oppoſers of the Union grow popular, and ſeem as if they were but meer Advocates for the Poor; That they were now really De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending their Country, which the Commiſſioners had aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and ſhewed, that the Concern for the Burdening

                  <hi>Scotland</hi> with unreaſonable Exactions had not been part of their Buſineſs—; Great Hopes therefore were conceived from this Debate by ſome People, who had the Deſtruction of the Treaty chiefly in their Eyes, for as the Struggle had not been ſmall in <hi>England,</hi> to obtain an Exemption from the Salt Tax to <hi>Scotland</hi> for Seven Years, it was more than probable, That, if a perpetual Exemption was inſiſted on, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would refuſe it, and ſo the Union might ſplit upon that Rock; which being ſo ſpecious, and ſeeming to be all done in meer Concern for the Poor of <hi>Scotland,</hi> would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore engage all the People of <hi>Scotland</hi> in Defence of it—; But this Cloud vaniſh'd afterward, tho' at firſt it look'd black enough.</p>

               <head>OBSERVATION XLIV.</head>
               <p>The Debate of the laſt Day being Renewed, occaſioned ſome Warmth in the Houſe, and great Arguings there were about the Poor in <hi>Scotland</hi> being Unable to pay the Tax upon Salt at all, and that therefore they ought not to be left to the Mercy of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament; the Matters alſo of the Diſproportion in the Duties to the Value in the reſpective Kingdoms, was alſo made a ſtrong Motive againſt the Duty being laid upon the <hi>Scots,</hi> as a plain Inequality, ſince, as the Duty on Salt lay then, being Taxed by Weight, the <hi>Scots</hi> ſhould pay Sixteen Shillings Four Pence upon what in their Country yielded <hi>excluſive</hi> of the Duty but Three Shillings; Whereas the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould pay no more on the Value of Ten Shillings Six Pence, which was a great Diſparity in the Taxation by Value—. But to this it was Anſwered, If the Bulk or Quantity of Salt was equal, and <hi>Scotland</hi> having their Salt made juſt where it was Expended, had, or could buy as much for Three Shillings, as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had, or could buy for Ten Shillings Six Pence, the Weight of the Salt being the ſame, they were ſo much the better able to pay Sixteen Shillings Four Pence on that Quantity of Salt in <hi>Scotland,</hi> by how much it was had Cheaper by Seven Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings Six Pence in its firſt Coſt, than the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were, who were obliged to pay Seven Shillings Six Pence for the ſame Quantity in its firſt Coſt, than the <hi>Scots</hi> payed.</p>
               <p>To this again was Objected, the Poverty of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Difference this made in the Price of Salt to the Poor, how neceſſary the Salt was to the Subſiſtence of the Poor, and how much it would raiſe the Price, to the General Diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement and Impoveriſhing the Labouring part of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Duties being very near one Penny <hi>per</hi> Pound <hi>ſterling</hi> upon the Salt, moſt of which Duty would ly on thoſe who were leaſt able to bear it; And this, as I Noted before, made the Argument become popular, and the Oppoſers of the Union began to be counted Patriots, who ſtrove meerly for the ſecuring their Country from Unreaſonable and Inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable Taxes.</p>
               <p>It is neceſſary to Note here, <hi>in order to let the Reader in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a true ſtate of this Queſtion,</hi> what the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Duties on Salt were, which were thus ſtrenuouſly Argued againſt—, they were in ſhort thus.<list>

granted 9<hi>th</hi> King <hi>William,</hi> and appropriated for the payment of Annuities Redeemable by Parliament.</item>
                  </list> As may more at large be ſeen in the Appendix.</p>
               <p>The Treaters at <hi>London</hi> had agreed on both Hands, to Exempt <hi>Scotland</hi> from the whole Tax upon Salt for ſeven Years as appears in the Obſervations on the Minutes of the Eighth Article in that Treaty—, but had then left it—, with a Conceſſion, that then <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould pay as <hi>England</hi> ſhould pay at that Time—, only it was ſuppoſed, the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament would Conſider, Whether <hi>Scotland</hi> was any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter able to pay then than before—, according to that Clauſe added in the Fourteenth Article, <hi>viz. That it could not be ſuppoſed, that the Parliament of</hi> Great-Britain <hi>would ever lay any ſorts of Burdens upon the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Kingdom, but what they ſhould find of Neceſſity at that time, for the Preſervation and Good of the whole—, and with due Regard to</hi> the Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Abilities <hi>of every part of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Kingdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it was again alledged, That the Words in this Eighth Article, <hi>viz. But from the Expiration of the ſaid ſeven years,</hi> Scotland <hi>ſhall be lyable to the ſame Duties for Salt made in</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>as ſhall be then payable for Salt made in</hi> England, <hi>Vide</hi> the Treaty at <hi>London</hi> Article VIII. <hi>Page</hi> 5<hi>th.</hi> Obliged the <hi>Scots</hi> to the payment, and put it out of the Power of the Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> to Alter it; and that therefore the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> ought to take effectual Care to prevent it, and to ſecure the People of Scotland againſt it.</p>
               <p>There were a great many Speeches made on this Subject, and ſomething Harſh enough paſt on both ſides, which I care not to Relate—, for the ſakes of the Gentlemen that ſhewed themſelves a little out of Temper here—; But at length a <hi>Medium</hi> was propoſed in the Terms <hi>of the firſt Clauſe of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute,</hi> which Exempted <hi>Scotland</hi> from the Two Shillings Four Pence <hi>per</hi> Buſhel, mentioned above, and appropriated to the Eaſt <hi>India</hi> Company, and let the Twelve Pence <hi>per</hi> Buſhel ſtand, as a Thing not of ſo much Conſequence, 1. Becauſe the Sum was not ſo conſiderable, as to make it Inſupportable to the Poor. 2. It was not appropriated to any payment fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to the year 1710, and ſo might Determine in a ſhort Time; Whereas the Two Shillings Four Pence <hi>per</hi> Buſhel, was actually ſettled as a Fund for payment of Annuities for Ninety Nine Years, and muſt certainly fall upon <hi>Scotland</hi> at the end of ſeven Years.</p>
               <p>This ſeemed a very reaſonable Propoſal, tho' it did not anſwer the End of theſe Gentlemen, whoſe Aim, as I Hinted before, was at the Treaty in General—. For it was a Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating between both, bearing a part which they could bear,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0554400100:432"/>
and yet taking off that part which the Poor were ſaid to be pinch'd by, and which they pretended would effectually have raiſed a National Diſcontent.</p>
               <p>The Gentlemen on the other ſide, were a little ſilenced with this Propoſal—; they at firſt indeed poſitively inſiſted, as in the D. of <hi>A—ls</hi> Proteſt, That <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould be for ever free <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of all Duties on Salt—, but they were ſubdued by the Reaſonings of the other Gentlemen, upon the Equity of the above Propoſal, and unleſs, as in General, objecting againſt the whole Treaty, there was no withſtanding it—; yet after ſome Debating, there was found an Exception to this too, and that was, That tho' the Two Shillings four Pence was thus provided againſt, it was but a ſingle Term, and the Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> might ſet that Duty aſide, and lay ſome other Tax on in the Room of it, which might be the ſame thing, or worſe, and ſo this Exemption might be Eluded, and this they called without Doors, <hi>a Deſign to Trepan</hi> Scotland, <hi>or draw her into the ſnare of the Duty, under the pretence of an Exemption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this was ſoon Warded againſt, and the latter part of the Clauſe effectually ſtopt that Gap, <hi>viz. That if the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of</hi> Great-Britain <hi>ſhall at, or before the Expiring of the ſaid ſeven years, ſubſtitute any other Fund in the place of the ſaid Two Shillings Four Pence of Exciſe on the Buſhel of Home Salt—,</hi> Scotland <hi>ſhall after the ſaid ſeven years, bear a proportion of the ſaid Fund,</hi> but <hi>ſhall have an Equivalent in the Terms of the Treaty,</hi> that is in the Terms of the Fourteenth Article, which ſays, That <hi>Scotland ſhall have an Equivalent for what the Subjects thereof ſhall be Charged towards payment of the Debts of</hi> England, <hi>in all particulars whatſoever,</hi> Vide Treaty at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> Art. 15. <hi>Pag.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>This brought the Matter of Debate to an End, and there was nothing left but to put the Vote—, the other Party of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered a Clauſe of General and Abſolute Exemption, as <hi>per</hi> the Minute—; but it was Voted not to be the ſtate of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, ſo the Affair ended with the D. of <hi>A—ls</hi> Proteſt, as <hi>per</hi> the Minute.</p>
               <p>Yet it muſt be obſerved, That this ſtep taken by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, went a great way to ſtop the Mouths of the People, who began to be ſtrangely Allarm'd at the Apprehenſions of the Salt Duty, which was cryed out upon as Inſupportable,; but their being wholly Exempted from it for ſeven years, and for ever Exempt from all but Twelve Pence <hi>per</hi> Buſhel, the Burden was both leſſened in the Main, and Remote in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and ſo the General Clamour wore off.</p>
               <p>It was indeed a great Abatement to that Article as ſtated at <hi>London,</hi> and ſome People flattered themſelves with the Hopes, that it would occaſion ſome Debates in the Parliament in <hi>England,</hi> and perhaps ſuffer ſome Alterations there, which
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0554400100:433"/>
might occaſion the Returning the whole to <hi>Scotland</hi> again—; But that View proved Fictitious, and the Gentlemen found themſelves diſappointed.</p>

               <p>The Eighth Article was now paſſed without any more De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, the Amendments were all Read, being put together, and as the Houſe had Ordered, Tranſcribed into Form, as you will find them in the Treaty, Printed in the <hi>Appendix.</hi>

And now we are come to the great Article of the Equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, which has of it ſelf made more Noiſe in the World, than all the other Articles; and which, tho' in it ſelf founded upon the higheſt Juſtice to <hi>Scotland,</hi> being the only Mean to bring the Diſcording Circumſtances of the Nations to Unite, and was ſtated with the greateſt Exactneſs, and the niceſt and moſt unexceptionable Calculations, that the Wit of Man could perform; yet it met with the greateſt Oppoſition, and was Treated with the moſt Contempt in <hi>Scotland</hi> of any other part of the Union; Nay to that Degree, that, when the very Money it ſelf came to be brought into <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Common People were excited to that Height, as to call it the Price of their Country, and to Inſult the very People that brought it.</p>
               <p>I muſt therefore be excuſed, if the Obſervations on this Point exceed the Bounds of that Brevity I at firſt propoſed to my ſelf, and that I endeavour to be as particular as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible upon this Head.</p>
               <p>The firſt Clauſe of this Article had been Voted and Agreed to, not without a great Struggle in the Parliament, on the Seventh of the ſame Month of <hi>December,</hi> as <hi>per</hi> the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon the Minutes of that Day appears, to which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and the remaining part of the Article was adjourned till the Reports of the Committee appointed to conſider of the Sixth and Eighth Articles were received and conſidered, which being now ended, the Houſe proceeded to the ſubſequent Articles.</p>
               <p>The Firſt Clauſe of the Article was the main Prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary to the reſt, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould be oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to come in to the appropriated Duties of <hi>England,</hi> and conſequently have her Revenues appropriated to the payment of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Debts, receiving from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> an Equivalent—; What that Equivalent ſhould be, <hi>viz. Ready Money?</hi> How much it ſhould be, <hi>viz.</hi> Three Hundred Ninety Eight Thouſand Eighty Five Pounds Ten Shillings—? And whether that Sum was rightly calculated? All this was determined as above.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Clauſe which came now to be debated was thus, <hi>And in regard, That, after the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> Scotland <hi>becoming liable to the ſame Cuſtoms and Duties payable on Import and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and to the ſame Exciſes on all Exciſeable Liquors as in</hi> England, <hi>as well upon that Account as upon the Account of the Encreaſe of Trade and People, (which will be the Happy Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion) The ſaid Revenues will much improve be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the before mentioned Annual Values thereof, of which no preſent Eſtimate can be made; Yet nevertheleſs, for the Reaſons aforeſaid, there ought to be a proportionable Equivalent anſwered to</hi> Scotland; It is agreed, <hi>That, after the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, there ſhall</hi>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:0554400100:435"/>
                  <hi>be an Account kept of the ſaid Duties ariſing in</hi> Scotland, <hi>to the end it may appear, what ought to be Anſwer'd to</hi> Scotland, <hi>as an Equivalent for ſuch Proportion of the ſaid Encreaſe, as ſhall be applicable to the Payment of the Debts of</hi> England.</p>
               <p>This was only to oblige the Perſons appointed by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to direct the Treaſury of <hi>Britain,</hi> That an exact Account might be kept, what part of the Revenue of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was to be appropriate, and for which the Equivalent was to be raiſed, in order alſo to come to a Certainty in the Meaſures which were to be taken with the Remainder—; And therefore this needed little Debate, yet it will occaſion a further Remark preſently.</p>
               <p>The Third Clauſe runs thus, <hi>And for the further and more effectual anſwering the ſeveral Ends hereafter mentioned,</hi> it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, <hi>That, from and after the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, the whole Encreaſe of the Revenues of Cuſtoms, and Duties on Import and Export, and Exciſe upon Exciſeable Liquors in</hi> Scotland, <hi>over and above the Annual Produce of the ſaid reſpective Duties, as above ſtated, ſhall go and be apply'd, for the Term of Seven Years, to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after mentioned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was a general Referring alſo to the Particulars, to which the Overplus of the Revenue of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, and this will alſo come to be diſcourſed of in its place, being here paſs'd of Courſe.</p>
               <p>The Fourth Clauſe was, <hi>And that, upon the ſaid Account, there ſhall be anſwered to</hi> Scotland <hi>Annually, from the end of Seven Years after the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, an Equivalent in Proportion to ſuch Part of the ſaid Encreaſe, as ſhall be applicable to the Debts of</hi> England.</p>
               <p>This Clauſe could admit no Debate on the <hi>Scots</hi> ſide, ſince, as they had agreed, by the firſt Clauſe, to come into an Equality of Duties, this was Capitulating in behalf of <hi>Scotland,</hi> That an Equivalent ſhould be paid by <hi>England</hi> for ſo much of the Revenues of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as ſhould be applyed to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Debts, over and above what had been already ſtated in the Equivalent named in the former Clauſe.</p>
               <p>And here I ſhall take the Freedom to quote what the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Gentleman I quoted before gave <hi>as his Opinion</hi> on this very Head, I mean Mr. Baron <hi>Clark,</hi> whoſe Judgment I think I may be allowed to appeal to, and who was a Witneſs to, and preſent in Parliament at all theſe Debates. <hi>See his Eſſay on the</hi> 15<hi>th. Article of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, Pag.</hi> 13<hi>th.</hi> in theſe Words—<q>
                     <p>2. That which is moſt Remarkable in this whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, and particularly to be taken Notice of, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That, from the Commencement of the <hi>Union,</hi> the whole Increaſe of the Revenues of <hi>Cuſtoms and Duties</hi> on Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and Export, and <hi>Exciſe</hi> upon <hi>Exciſeable Liquors,</hi> over and above the Annual Produce of the ſaid reſpective Duties, as above ſtated, ſhall be applyed for the Term of 
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0554400100:436"/>
Seven Years, to the Uſe and Advantage of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Meaning whereof is hereby Illuſtrated.</p>
                     <p>Suppoſe, the <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> after the Union, <hi>(what upon the Account of a greater Trade, or upon the Account of taking upon us the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Cuſtoms)</hi> ſhould increaſe to 80000 Pounds <hi>Sterling, which I believe no Trading Man will doubt of;</hi> then 'tis plain, that in regard there's an Increaſe of theſe Cuſtoms of 50000 Pounds above the preſent Extent, therefore that Increaſe is by this Paragraph allowed to <hi>Scotland</hi> yearly, for the foreſaid <hi>Term</hi> of Seven Years, <hi>which will be a great Encouragement to</hi> Scotland, <hi>and by Conſequence an Advantage to the whole</hi> Iſland; <hi>ſince 'tis not to be doubted, but ſuch an</hi> Annual Sum <hi>of</hi> 50000 Pounds <hi>will be imployed during that time, towards ſuch Ends and Uſes as will be moſt for the Honour and Advantage of this Poor Country.</hi>

                     <p>Suppoſe, after the foreſaid Term of Seven Years, the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould riſe to 120000 Pounds yearly, which is an Increaſe of 90000 Pounds above what they are new ſtated at; in that Caſe, the ſaid Increaſe of 90000 Pounds wou'd be diſpoſed of as follows,</p>

                     <p>This laſt Article of the Accompt is very Remarkable, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to no leſs than a Sum of 71287 Pounds to be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable towards the Debts contracted before the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion. But this needs not amuſe any Perſon: For in the <hi>firſt</hi> place, it was ſuppoſed, if there be a Peace concluded, and ſo an end put to the preſent <hi>War,</hi> then will the Debts of <hi>England</hi> be in a few Years fully payed. The Conſequence of which will be, That the Cuſtoms and Exciſes, which after the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, 
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0554400100:437"/>
will be payable by the Subjects of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> ſhall then be intirely taken off and let fall. In the <hi>next</hi> place, Tho' the ſaid Sum of 71287 Pounds be applicable yearly towards the Payment of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Debts; yet there ſhall be an Annual <hi>Equivalent</hi> given by <hi>England</hi> to the Extent of that Sum. Which leads us to conſider a <hi>Queſtion,</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or not that Sum of 71287 Pounds will be ſent up yearly to <hi>England</hi> for paying theſe Debts? I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> No, for if it ſhould, then, by the Nature of the Equivalents, that very Sum behoved to be ſent back to us again, which is a certain needleſs Trouble; and Lawyers, when they intend to amuſe their Clients with ſpeaking a ſort of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine; have this in their Mouths, applicable enough to this Purpoſe, <hi>Fruſtra petitur quod mox eſt reſtituendum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wherefore any Man may ſee, that this Sum is not to be ſent to <hi>England,</hi> but muſt remain among us.</p>
                     <p>Could it ever have entered into the Heads of Men, in their right Wits, to burden a Poor Nation with an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Payment of a great Sum, for Debts they never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, without at the ſame time allowing a Re-imburſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them? And if ſo, can we imagine, that Matters will be ſo confounded, as that they muſt ſend yearly great Sums out of <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> for no other End, than immediately to be returned back again? This is ſo ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, that 'tis ſcarcely to be ſpoken of.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus far Mr. Baron <hi>Clark,</hi> to which I ſhall add nothing, but that his Reaſonings were ſo plain, that they needed no Explication—</p>
               <p>The Fifth Clauſe was thus, <hi>And whereas, from the Expira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Seven Years after the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> Scotland <hi>is to be lyable to the ſame Duties for Salt made in</hi> Scotland, <hi>as ſhall be then pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for Salt made in</hi> England; It is agreed, <hi>That, when ſuch Duties take place there, an Equivalent ſhall be Anſwered to</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>for ſuch Part thereof, as ſhall be apply'd towards payment of the Debts of</hi> England; <hi>Of which Duties an Account ſhall be kept, to the end it may appear, what is to be Anſwered to</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>as the ſaid Equivalent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This required only to be left out as being uſeleſs, ſince the Affair of the Salt was ſettled otherways in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Days Vote; So that hitherto theſe were all Negative Clauſes in the Main.</p>
               <p>The Sixth Clauſe was, <hi>And generally, That an Equivalent ſhall be Anſwered to</hi> Scotland <hi>for ſuch Parts of the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Debts, as</hi> Scotland <hi>may hereafter become lyable to pay by Reaſon of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, other than ſuch for which Appropriations have been made by Parliament in</hi> England <hi>of the Cuſtoms, or other Duties on Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and Import, Exciſes on all Exciſeable Liquors or Salt, in Reſpect of which Debts, Equivalents are herein before provided.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Oppoſition made to this Article was on the ſame Foot as the Oppoſition made to the firſt Clauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That they
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0554400100:438"/>
would not have <hi>Scotland</hi> come into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Debts at all, but having conſented to come in as far as the Equivalent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, they were for making a Stop there—; But this was found Impracticable, after the Duties which were to be paid by <hi>Scotland</hi> were aſſented to, to have turned them from the Channel of Appropriation which the like Duties in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> were appointed to run in by Act of Parliament, could not well be done, ſo after a ſhort Diſpute about the Poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of this, it was paſs'd over alſo.</p>
               <p>They now came to the Debate of the Application of the Equivalent, but this was too long a Subject to enter upon that Day, ſo it was adjourned to the next Time—.</p>

               <p>The Work of this Day Explains it ſelf—, and needs but little Remark; This was a new ſhift, if poſſible, to have Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the Parliament from going on with the great Work of the Union, Tumults and Riots in the Country had been tryed in Vain, and the <hi>Glaſgow</hi> Rabblers were cloſs in the Caſtle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> Mobs and Rabbles in the Streets had been ſuppreſt, and the Guards did conſtant Duty in the City, walked the Rounds in the Night, and kept the Streets quiet, the Meeting of the Heretors and Fencible Men, had been Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged by Proclamation, and the Clauſe in the <hi>Act of Security,</hi> Licenſing them to do ſo, had been Repealed; So that now no Room was left for violent Methods, except by open and actual Rebellion, and that had all poſſible proviſion made for it in the Laws, and the Queen had Ordered Troops to the Borders of <hi>England,</hi> as is before Noted, in order to aſſiſt and ſupport the Government, in caſe of Neceſſity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:0554400100:440"/>
The only Pretence therefore now, was this, The Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes, as you will Read in the Minutes, had been continually brought in againſt the Union from all parts of the Kingdom, Anſwers were not given, nor expected to be given by the Parliament, but they lay before the Parliament for their Conſideration; and an Addreſs lying before the Parliament, is, by the Nature of the Thing, ſuppoſed to be under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration—; But the Addreſſers pretending, That no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard was had to their Addreſſes, pretend now to come all up to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to wait for, or rather to Demand Anſwers to their Addreſſes—; This was too bare faced a Pretence not to diſcover its own Meaning; And therefore the Parliament immediately agreed to the Proclamation, to Diſcharge or Forbid all ſuch Gatherings or Meetings of the Subjects, as Unwarrantable and contrair to Law. See the Proclamation in the <hi>Appendix N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>.</hi> B x x.</p>
               <p>You will obſerve, That on ſeveral Occaſions after the firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of Printing the Names of ſuch as Voted on either ſide, the like Liſt of Names was Ordered to be made publick—, it would have been too long to have ſubjoyned theſe to every Vote—, and alſo been Troubleſome and Uſeleſs to the Reader—; But this Caſe being ſomething ſingular, I have put the Names of the Members as they were Printed by Order of Parliament, in the Appendix of this Work, marked with this Mark D x x, by which ſome gueſs may be made, who Encouraged or Diſcouraged the Violences of thoſe Times, and what Encouragement were ſuggeſted to thoſe without, from the Proceedings and Conduct of thoſe within.</p>
               <p>It was expected by ſome People, That theſe Tumults ſhould have had great Encouragement on the part of the Church; and great pains were taken to draw in the Miniſters in ſeveral parts, to Eſpouſe the Quarrel, and to appear with the People againſt the Union.</p>
               <p>But the Miniſters, however they ſhewed themſelves againſt the Union in General, and againſt the ſeveral Particulars as they concerned them, yet they ſhewed no Inclination to Encourage the Tumultary Methods, that the Violent Tempers of other People, ſeemed to be precipitating the Nation into; and therefore the Letter written by the Commiſſion to the ſeveral Presbyteries, was very ſeaſonable, not only to prevent the Miſchiefs Threatning the Peace of the Kingdom at that Time, but alſo to Vindicate the Commiſſion of the Aſſembly from the Aſperſions raiſed upon them from the above Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, Copy of which I have inſerted in the <hi>Appendix,</hi> with the Anſwer of the Presbytery of <hi>Hamilton</hi> to it N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>.

               <p>It would have been endleſs to have added here, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Addreſſes which were preſented from the ſeveral parts of the Kingdom, however, ſome of the moſt ſignificant I

               </p>
               <p>It is agreed, That, in the firſt place, out of the foreſaid Sum, what Conſideration ſhall be found neceſſary to be had for any Loſſes which private Perſons may ſuſtain, by reducing the Coin of <hi>Scotland</hi> to the Standart and Value of the Coin of <hi>England</hi> may be made good.

Increaſe of the ſaid Revenues of Cuſtoms, Duties and Exciſes, above the preſent Value, which ſhall ariſe in <hi>Scotland</hi> during the ſaid Term of Seven Years, together with the Equivalent, which ſhall become due upon the Improvement thereof in <hi>Scotland,</hi> after the ſaid Term, and alſo as to all other Sums, which according to the Agreements aforeſaid may become payable to <hi>Scotland</hi> by way of Equivalent, for what that Kingdom ſhall hereafter become lyable, towards payment of the Debts of <hi>England;</hi> It is agreed, That the ſame be applyed in manner following, <hi>viz.</hi> That all the Publick Debts of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as ſhall be adjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this preſent Parliament, ſhall be payed, and that 2000 Pounds <hi>Sterling per Annum,</hi> for the ſpace of Seven Years, ſhall be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards Incouraging and Promoting the Manufacture of courſe Wooll within theſe Shires which produce the Wooll, and that the firſt 2000 Pounds <hi>Sterling</hi> be payed at <hi>Martinmaſs</hi> next, and ſo yearly at <hi>Martinmaſs</hi> during the ſpace foreſaid; and afterwards the ſame ſhall be wholly applyed towards the Incouraging and Promoting the Fiſheries and ſuch other Manufactures and Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as may moſt conduce to the general Good of the United Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Which being Read, and after Reaſoning thereon, it was Moved, That the Company of <hi>Scotland</hi> Trading to <hi>Africa</hi> and the <hi>Indies</hi> be heard by their Lawyers upon the Rights and Priviledges of the ſaid Company before any further Procedure: And after Debate,</p>

               <p>Upon this part of the Application of the Equivalent, great Stir was made, on pretence of preſerving the <hi>African</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and ſome Papers were offered to the Parliament.</p>
               <p>The Company made a long Repreſentation to the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, needleſs to be inſerted here—.</p>
               <p>There were a Party who pretended to ſtruggle, <hi>and ſome Motions appeared in the Houſe to that purpoſe,</hi> againſt the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving the <hi>African</hi> Company; It is confeſt, the Company was a Thing the Nation had a great Concern in, almoſt every conſiderable Family in the Kingdom having ſome ſhare in the Stock, and conſequently in the Loſs, for it was reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned no better: The Hiſtorical part of that Tranſaction does not relate to this place, but it may be proper to ſay a little to it, to introduce the true underſtanding of the Vote.</p>
               <p>The Company had been Erected upon a General Subſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of 600000 <hi>lib. ſterling,</hi> moſt of it ſubſcribed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> upon which every Subſcriber had paid down a certain part of the Sum ſubſcribed, and was lyable at the Call of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, to be purſued for the Remainder, and to pay it all in, as by the ſeveral Acts of Parliament, ſettling and confirming the ſaid Company, will appear.</p>
               <p>Upon the Miſcarriage of the Expedition to <hi>Daricn,</hi> and the Return of their Ships, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Company was ſo Diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged and Diſheartned, that no new Attempt either there, or any where elſe, had been ſo much as Talked of, nor were any other Payments demanded, the Loſs of what was already Expended lying very heavy upon the Nation, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly upon ſome Families who could very ill bear it.</p>
               <p>The Deſign had ſo effectually Miſcarried, that the Stock advanc'd was not only Expended, but the Company was brought very low, and was very far in Debt upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their ſaid Expedition to <hi>Darien</hi>—, and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers were always apprehenſive of a Call upon them of ſome further payment, to diſcharge the Remainder due on the old Voyage, or perhaps to Form ſome new Expedition, and this made ſome People ſo Uneaſie, that they ſold their Stock in the ſaid Company for Trifles, <hi>only to be ſecured againſt further Demands;</hi> In General, the Intereſt in the ſaid Stock was come to ſo low an Ebb, that People valued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves little or nothing upon their Shares in it, and when the firſt View of the Union came on, and ſome thought one way
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0554400100:444"/>
of it, ſome another, they either Bought or Sold as their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Union, and its proſpect of Succeſs either increaſed or decreaſed; and indeed the publick Expectation of the Succeſs of the Union ran very low at this Time, as may be ſuppoſed, from the Value now put on the Stock of the <hi>African</hi> Company, which was fallen ſo low, that ſeveral People offered to Sell their whole Intereſt for 10 <hi>per Cent.</hi> on the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Stock, tho' at the ſame time they ſaw, that if the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on took place, the whole principal Money with Intereſt was to be repaid them.</p>
               <p>There ſeemed to be abundance of Difficulties in the way of the Treaty; he Fury of the Rabbles, the Tumults in the Streets, the Strength of the Oppoſition, and the abundance of Debates they were yet to go thro', gave ſo mean a proſpect of the Union, that tho' it was an Article in the Treaty, that when it was Finiſhed, all the Stock of the <hi>African</hi> Company ſhould be repaid with Intereſt, as above, <hi>out of the Equivalent Money,</hi> yet no Body Valued themſelves upon it then, nor were any very fond of Buying, tho' the Demand was extravagantly low; and indeed ſo low as told every one, the Sellers look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon it as a deſparate Caſe, that they had no Dependance upon, and very little Expectation from</p>
               <p>It was expected there ſhould have been a Debate upon the previous Queſtion, Whether the <hi>African</hi> Company ſhould be Diſſolved or no, and as <hi>per</hi> the Vote, it was propoſed to hear Lawyers or Counſel in behalf of the Company, but it was apparent, this alſo was a Propoſal not ſo much in behalf of the Company, as in order to put a full ſtop to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſince it was evident, two Companies could not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent in <hi>Britain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor was it alledged, That the Proprietors of the Company had it been put to the Queſtion, would have deſired the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to continue, and ſo have Disburſed further Sums to carry on their Trade, in hope of making up and recovering their Money; and this rather than have received their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Sums with Intereſt back again, which was a Thing they had no reaſon to expect.</p>
               <p>The Propoſal therefore was rejected, not that every Mans Conſent in his own private Right was not acknowledged to be needful—; But this being a publick Act granted by Parliament, the Parliament firſt ſecuring every Man his whole Principal and Intereſt, from the very time of payment, had undoubtedly a Power to Reſcind their own Act, and cauſe ceaſe all the Powers and Privileges which derived from them.</p>
               <p>Upon this Foot, it was thought juſt to Repeal the Acts Eſtabliſhing the Company, even without hearing their Lawyers, or demanding their Aſſent—. Again, had the Aſſent been demanded, it ought to have been not an Aſſent
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0554400100:445"/>
of the Directors or Council, but of every Proprietor, which, as it might have been Difficult, and perhaps Impoſſible, would have effectually anſwered the End of thoſe Gentlemen, who ſought to bring theſe Matters to a Head of Debate, and ſo have wrought out of them the wiſhed for Delay to the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> then in hand.</p>
               <p>Some alſo alledged this Caſe as parallel to the great Caſe now depending, and would have argued the laſt from the conſequence of the firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> That as the Company could not be Diſſolved by the Conſent of the Directors, or Council, or Managers of their Affairs, but by the univerſal Conſent of the whole Body of Subſcribers; ſo neither could the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of <hi>Scotland</hi> be Altered by the Act and Deed of the Repreſentative, without the Concurrence and Aſſent of the Conſtituents from whom the Repreſentatives derived—. But this ſeeming parallel appeared to be Imperfect, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to be no parallel at all, ſince the Company could at any time be legally Diſſolved, and their Charters, Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, and Powers be made to ceaſe, by the ſame Power that made them, without asking the Aſſent either of the Directors or Subſcribers; <hi>That is,</hi> without Conſulting the Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or Conſtituent, Parts of that Body, and the Power ſo Diſſolving, or taking away the ſaid Company, had no other Obligation upon them, than in Juſtice to make good all Damage or Detriment to private Perſons; and this was effectually done.</p>
               <p>The Fate of the <hi>African</hi> Company of <hi>Scotland</hi> being thus Determined, the further Application of the Equivalent was the next Work—; and there ſeemed only two Things to call immediately for help.<list>
                     <item>1. The Coin, which of Neceſſity required a new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation.</item>
                     <item>2. The publick Debts of the Nation, which called loudly to be Diſcharged.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The Coin was agreed to be the firſt Conſideration, and as <hi>per</hi> the Minute appears, was unanimouſly agreed to—, the ſtate of which was in ſhort thus;</p>
               <p>By the lowneſs of the Coin in <hi>Scotland,</hi> both as to Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Quantity, I mean the Old Money, <hi>Scotland</hi> came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this General Diſadvantage, <hi>viz.</hi> That almoſt every Foreign Coin paſt current in <hi>Scotland</hi> to advantage: For Example—, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Shilling paſt at Thirteen Pence, the <hi>French</hi> Crown which in <hi>London</hi> goes at Four Shillings Six Pence, paſt at Five Shillings, the <hi>Dutch</hi> Dollar at Fifty Eight Pence, the Bank Dollar, and Three other ſorts commonly called the Wild-Horſe, the Wild-Man, and Caſtle, being generally Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial or Rex Dollars, were by Act of Council raiſed to Sixty Pence.</p>
               <p>

This indeed had been occaſioned by the Government in <hi>Scotland,</hi> formerly crying up their own Money above the uſual Rate, a Thing always Fatal to the Nations that have thought fit to Venture upon it, and which Precipice <hi>England</hi> narrowly miſs'd ſplitting upon <hi>in the late Reſtoration of her Coin,</hi> at which time, ſome People puſh'd hard at raiſing the Value of the Standart, not being aware of the National In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury of Raiſing the Value of Foreign <hi>Species,</hi> and ſubjecting the General Credit to a Loſs on Exchange with all Nations of the World.</p>
               <p>By the Union the Coin of <hi>Scotland</hi> was to be reduced, and brought to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Standart, the Conſequence of this was of neceſſity, that there would be a Loſs upon all the kinds of Money, both Foreign and Proper—; To cry down the Foreign Money, and bring it to a Value, could not be, becauſe the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Money being the Standart, was to be the only current Money, and all other Money would, as in <hi>England,</hi> go by Weight only; To ſink the Difference in the Hands of particular Perſons, who had ſuch Money in Poſſeſſion, would have been a great Loſs upon the poor People, and what they could not eaſily bear—</p>
               <p>The Advance upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Money, which was one Penny on every Shilling of the Silver, and Two Shillings Two Pence upon every Guinea, fell by the Courſe of Things, that Money being to go current at the Rates as in <hi>England,</hi> and this was no ſmall Loſs to the People that had <hi>Engliſh</hi> Money by them, but the Foreign and <hi>Scots</hi> Money being no more to be current, it was but reaſonable, that the Publick ſhould defray the Charge, and make good the Loſs, and therefore this was allotted out of the Equivalent.</p>
               <p>Nor was that all, but as this was a Caſe which admitted no Delay, ſo it obtained the Preference of every Thing elſe, for till this was ſettled, the Circulation of Money would have been ſtopp'd, and a general Stagnation of Trade would have followed, and therefore it was appointed to be made good out of the Equivalent, before the <hi>African</hi> Company was refunded, and this ſet the Mint quickly to Work, as will appear in its place.</p>
               <p>The next thing to be paid out of the Equivalent was the Publick Debts, there were ſome who ſtruggled heartily to have the Debts of the Government come in before the Affair of the <hi>African</hi> Company, but it could not be carryed, thoſe Debts were not all aſcertain'd, and the Claims were to be remitted to the Deciſion of the Law, at leaſt many of them, and this would have left the <hi>African</hi> Affair to a long Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, which neither the Nature of the Thing, nor the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion that Subſcribers had for their Money could admit of—; For it is to be obſerved by the Clauſe, That if the whole was not paid them within Twelve Months, they had
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0554400100:447"/>
Privilege to Trade, or give Licence to Trade, as if they were not to Diſſolve at all.</p>
               <p>Next after the <hi>African</hi> Company therefore the Publick Debts came to be conſidered, and the Equivalent was appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to the Diſcharge of the ſaid Debts; And if the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Sum fell ſhort, it was to be made good out of the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cuſtoms and Revenue of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which for Seven Years was to be appropriate for ſuch Uſes, as will hereafter appear.</p>
               <p>The next in order was to beſtow this Money for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of Trade, and firſt the Wooll Maſters as they are called, that is the Gentlemen whoſe Eſtates were in the Sheep Countries, and whoſe Rents were generally paid in Wooll, theſe made loud Complaints, that the Unions bringing upon them a Prohibition or Reſtraint of the Exportation of Wooll, and there being no Conſumption by Manufacturing at Home, and their Wooll too courſe for Sale in <hi>England,</hi> their Eſtates would be viſibly ſunk, and therefore that they ought to have ſome <hi>Equivalent</hi> alſo.</p>
               <p>To this it was alledged, That the Exportation of Wooll, however obtained lately in <hi>Scotland,</hi> yet was grievous to the whole Nation, and ought to be reſtrained by Law, as it was injurious to Trade, and that it uſed in former Times to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained; that therefore if this was a preſent Loſs to them, it was nothing but a reducing them to what they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and taking away the Advantages they had made for a few Years out of the Publick Loſſes: But however, That all Parties might, as far as poſſible, be made ſenſible of the Equity and Juſtice of the Union, a Conſideration of 2000 Pounds <hi>Sterling per Annum</hi> was allowed to encourage ſetting up ſuch Manufactures in theſe places, as might imploy the Poor, and help forward the Conſumption of the Wooll in the Countries where it is grown—; How this 2000 Pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> was diſpoſed, and what Effect it had on the Wooll, or on the Trade, I may Examine hereafter.</p>
               <p>A Remainder after this is allotted to the Fiſhing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the Iſſue of this alſo being not come to Knowledge at Writing of this Hiſtory, I can give no further Account of it.</p>
               <p>As to the Affair of the Coin and of the <hi>African</hi> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the particulars were referr'd to the Committee, and we ſhall meet with them again in their Courſe, the Report of the ſaid Committee being formed into an Act of Parliament, as will appear in its place—</p>

               <head>OBSERVATION XLVIII.</head>
               <p>The Matter committed to the Committee here, was not whether the Coin ſhould be reduc'd to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Standart, and be alike all over the Iſland, for that every one ſeemed to agree to, eſpecially after it had been agreed before, that the Deſiciency ſhould be made good out of the Equivalent—; But how, and in what manner the Deficiency of the Money ſhould be made good, was the thing the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee was to conſider—; And here, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary almoſt to the Hopes of the People, the Committee concluded, that the Deficiency even of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Money, <hi>viz.</hi> One Penny in each Shilling ſhould be made good.</p>
               <p>But here was a great Difficulty, and that was this, if it ſhould be Voted, that no Conſideration ſhould be given for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Money, the People would be great Loſers, and the Article of making good the Loſſes of the Coin would not be made good to them—; If the Deficiency was Voted, then the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would bring in vaſt Sums of Money upon them to receive the Deficiency, and have it out in current Money, and ſo carry it home again, and by this Trick, as ſome ſuggeſted, all the Equivalent might be exhauſted.</p>
               <p>But the Committee found a Cure for both theſe Evils to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, 1. They reſolved to make good the Deficiency of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Money, <hi>that is,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Silver Money, not the Guineas, and ſo all the Objections of that ſort fell to the Ground; And to prevent the Poſſibility of bringing in any Quantity of Silver Money from <hi>England,</hi> they appointed all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Money in the Nation to be brought in to certain places all in one Day, where the Sums being told, Sealed up, and laid by till no more was left to bring in, the Money was delivered back again the ſame day, with a Certification of the ſame, which entitled the Proprietor to the Deficiency to be paid out of the Equivalent.</p>
               <p>Thus in one day all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Money in the Kingdom, (<hi>viz.</hi> all the Silver Money) was reduc'd to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Value, and went after that as in <hi>England,</hi> and for no more—; And as the Rate of Exchanges always attends the Intrinſick Value of the <hi>Specie,</hi> ſo the Exchanges, which before ran at Eleven or Twelve <hi>per Cent.</hi> to the Diſadvantage of <hi>Scotland,</hi> immediately came to <hi>A PAR,</hi> and Money ran between <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> and <hi>Edinburgh</hi> at a half <hi>per Cent.</hi> or at moſt one <hi>per Cent.</hi> ſometimes this way, ſometimes that way, as the Demand of Remitters and Drawers happened to alter the Caſe.</p>
               <p>However the Proclamation mentioned in this Vote was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, till the Time that all Things were ready for this Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the Money, that People might not have Notice of the Thing, and conſcquently have Room to bring in Money from <hi>England;</hi> It was alledged nevertheleſs, That ſeveral conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0554400100:450"/>
Sums were brought over the Borders, but I never could underſtand, That it was proved; for the particulars, the Reader is referred to the Proclamation which contains the Report of the Committee, and ſhall come in its place.</p>
               <p>The Seventeenth Article required no Debate at all, being what every Body acknowledged to be needful.</p>
               <p>The Eighteenth Article was ſo well worded, and every Thing that related to <hi>Scotland</hi> ſo well provided for, that there was very little Room for Objection, and what was offered merits not to be remembred—; What was ſaid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the Laws, being made Alterable by the Parliament, amounted to nothing but juſt what had been Argued in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> at the Treaty; as for thoſe that would have it out of the Power of ſubſequent Parliaments to alter any of the Laws, when they came to conſider, that this was to Bar <hi>Scotland</hi> from having the advantage of a Legiſlature, and from what is Eſſential to all Government, <hi>viz.</hi> To have a Power in Beeing to make ſuch Laws as they ſhall want, they preſently Quitted a Notion ſo wild, remembring that Laws which are for the publick Good in one Age, may be directly otherwiſe in another; And to leave the Parliament no Power to Amend or Alter the Laws, would be to put <hi>Scotland</hi> in a worſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition than any Nation in the World, that when any part of Her Law became Grievous to Her, it could not, tho' at Her own Requeſt, receive any Amendment; the Reaſonableneſs therefore of its being always in the Power of ſubſequent Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments to Make or Amend Laws being granted, the Diſtinction of the Article admitted the leſs Debate, all things being to be done only to the <hi>evident <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tility of</hi> Scotland.</p>
               <p>There was a ſecond Attempt made here, with relation to Exempting the <hi>Scots</hi> from the Sacramental Teſt in <hi>England,</hi> but as it was juſt the ſame thing as is mentioned already in the Obſervation of <hi>November</hi> 12<hi>th.</hi> I need make no further Remark upon it, than this, That it was thrown by as a Thing in its ſelf Impracticable, Unreaſonable for the <hi>Scots</hi> Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to meddle with, and as offered only to Embarraſs the preſent great Affair upon the Stage.</p>
               <p>The Seſſion or Term for Law-proceedings was now further to be Adjourned, and this was thought Neceſſary, not only becauſe of the preſent Hurry the Nation was in, being Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally taken up about the great Affair of the Union; but it was thought ſome Advantages were deſigned againſt the Treaty, from the Confluence of People that from all Parts of the Kingdom, generally come together on this Occaſion; and the Gentlemen who were for the Union, did not think it Safe to give ſuch an Opportunity or Pretence, for the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey to gather to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> as that muſt of Neceſſity offer to them.</p>

               <p>I have given the Reaſons for Adjourning the Seſſion in the laſt Obſervation; The Debates of this Day were only upon the Day to which it ſhould be Adjourned, which are not Material, only to Note, That the Gentlemen againſt the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion were always for the ſhorteſt Adjournment, which ſome ſaid, was in hopes to get the Seſſion to begin before the Parliament ſhould end.</p>
               <p>By the Nineteenth Article, the Court of Seſſion, or as it is called, The Colledge of Juſtice, with the Court of Juſticiary, are here effectually Eſtabliſhed and Confirmed, their Being and Conſtitution can not be Touched, no not by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; They are indeed to ſubmit to Regulations, and it can not but be Reaſonable it ſhould be ſo, but none of theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations can affect them as a Court.</p>
               <p>It may not be unneceſſary, for the ſake of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Reader, to Explain the Terms in this Article, and to Deſcribe the People mentioned here, by the like kind of Offices known in <hi>England,</hi> and to Note,<list>
                     <item>1. That the Colledge of Juſtice, conſiſts of the Lords of Seſſion, Advocats, and Writers to the Signet; The Lords of the Seſſion are a Bench of Judges, conſiſting of Fifteen, of whom one is Lord Preſident of the Seſſion, now poſſeſt by Sir <hi>Hugh Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rymple</hi> Brother to the Earl of <hi>Stair</hi>—; Theſe are Judges of all Cauſes of private Right, like as the Court of <hi>Queens Bench</hi> and <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> from whom Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals lay before the Parliament, called <hi>Petitions for Remeid of Law;</hi> Their Sallary was Two Hundred Pound <hi>per Annum,</hi> but is now ſince the Union Five Hundred Pound.</item>
                     <item>2. The Court of Juſticiary is a Criminal Court, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of Five Judges, who are called, <hi>The Lords of Juſticiary,</hi> of whom the Earl of <hi>Cromerty</hi> is Preſident or Chief, and is called, <hi>Juſtice General.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>Advocats here, are Lawyers, ſuch as the Counſellors at Law in <hi>England,</hi> who Plead before the Lords of the Seſſion, (the Judges) and give Advice, take Fees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the Connſellors of the Inns of Court in <hi>England.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>Writers are ſomething like Attorneys, who proſecute Law Suits, and prepare Things in due Form for Trials at the Bar.</item>
                     <item>Writers to the Signet, are a Select Number of thoſe by whom all Proceſſes muſt be Signed, before they can go on in Form.</item>

It was the Subject of no ſmall Debate here, Whether any Writer ſhould be capable of being Lord of the Seſſion, or Advocats or Counſellors only; It had been alledged, that it was Diſhonourable to the Bench of Judges, to raiſe any of the Writers, which are a lower Rank of Practitioners, to the Dignity of a Lord of the Seſſion; That it was Advancing them over the Heads of the Advocats, that in <hi>England</hi> no Man arrives to the Dignity of a Judge, till he is firſt received within the Bar, <hi>That is,</hi> made a Serjeant; and that till now, Writers were not Admitted.</p>
               <p>The firſt Motion was even againſt Advocates or Clerks of the Seſſion too, <hi>till they had ſerved a certain Number of Years as Advocats;</hi> but the Writers finding themſelves ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by that Vote, got it added after a long Debate.</p>
               <p>It remained then to Determine, what Writers ſhould be Qualified, and which Excluded; but as this Debate ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſomething of a Surprize to the Parliament, and the whole Faculty ſeemed concerned in it, it was put off to the next day—; The Debate ſeemed of no great Concern to the Publick, but as it affected private Perſons, whoſe Intereſt was at that time ſtrong in the Parliament, it occaſioned warm Debates.</p>

               <p>Then the Parliament reſumed the Conſideration of the Debate anent the Qualification of Writers to the Signet, before they can be named ordinary Lords of Seſſion: And after ſome further Debate as to the time they are to ſerve as Writers, before they can be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to be named Lords, there were two States of a Vote offered; the firſt in theſe Terms, <hi>Whether they ſhall ſerve Twenty Years,</hi> or <hi>none,</hi> and the ſecond in theſe Terms, <hi>Whether they are to ſerve Eight or Ten Years;</hi> And after ſome Reaſoning, which of the two ſhould be the State of the Vote, <hi>Firſt</hi> or <hi>Second,</hi>

undergoing a Five Years Probation at the Bar: On the other Hand, if the Vote ſhould be carried for a Writers being Twenty Years in that Station, before being capable to be named by the Sovereign to be an ordinary Lord of the Seſſion, that ſeems to be Tantamount to an abſolute Excluſion of Writers from the ſad Office,</q> and thereupon he took Inſtruments.</p>

               <p>There needs little to be ſaid of this Days Work, our laſt Obſervation having ſtated the Caſe, and the Vote it ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more particular than ordinary in that Matter.</p>
               <p>The Writers to the Signet were admitted to be made or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Lords of the Seſſion, upon Conditions and Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as by the Minute, <hi>viz.</hi> Ten Years Continuance as Writer, and Two Years afterward paſſing a Tryal before the Advocats.</p>
               <p>But it may not be Unneceſſary to Note, That all this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate had ſome Ground for it that did not yet appear, and ſome perſonal Views were in it on either Hand; The latter, it can be of no uſe to meddle with here, but the Reaſons in general of this Debate were, to forecloſe the admitting Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

to be Judges, who had not been bred to the Law, a Thing really Significant in it ſelf, and which ſome alledged had been but too much practiſed, in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to the great prejudice of the College of Juſtice in general, the Injury of the Gentlemen who were bred up to the Study of, and had run thro' long Practice in the Law, and not over much to the Reputation of the whole Seſſion in general—; It was ſaid alſo, That there were Views of this ſort at this time, and that much of the Debate was founded upon that Head, but this I will not affirm, it is certain, the Lawyers made no ſmall Struggle in the Caſe of Qualifications on both Sides—; The People generally ſeemed very well pleaſed with the Limitations, as what ſeemed very much to regard the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Law, and be ſome Security for the time to come, that ſuch as ſhall be advanced to be Judges of the Law, ſhall be choſen from among thoſe who beſt underſtand the Law—; At laſt the Debate ſeemed to meet with ſome Interruption on the Account of ſubmitting theſe Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain</hi>—; This was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by ſeveral ſorts of People; and it may be noted, ſome were for ſubmitting this to ſuch Alteration, which were very warm againſt ſubmitting other things—; Their Reaſons were plain to the Perſons concerned, but being of no publick Conſequence to Record thoſe things, I leave them to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the reſpective Parties.</p>
               <p>It was at laſt ſettled, as <hi>per</hi> the Vote, alterable by the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> Parliament; And I cannot but note, That thoſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who expect the Limitations, ſhall be enlarged by a <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> Parliament, and were, on that Account, forward to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it to ſuch Alteration, may very probably be diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Parliaments in <hi>England</hi> having on all Occaſions, ſhowen themſelves forward to ſecure a Succeſſion of able and well Qualified Perſons to be Judges in <hi>England,</hi> and will no doubt be careful of the ſame in <hi>Scotland,</hi> when ever that caſe ſhall come before them.</p>

Study of Antiquity—; In the proſecution of which, he had begun a moſt Tedious and Chargeable Work in Search after the Antiquities of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and had formarly laid before them the Specimens he had made of that Work, which met with a General Approbation, and the Reward allotted him for it, ſhews the ſenſe the Houſe had of the Greatneſs of the Undertaking, which if that Gentleman live to Finiſh, it may let the world know, their Money was not ill beſtowed.</p>
               <p>The Naturalizing Monſieur <hi>Huguetan</hi> was a Thing lay open to ſome Reflections, and at firſt look'd meanly enough; The Man was fled from <hi>France,</hi> and as was ſaid, had De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded the King of <hi>France,</hi> and private Perſons alſo, of great Sums of Money, and finding himſelf unſafe in <hi>England,</hi> where a Commiſſion of Bankrupt had been attempted to be Sued out—, he ſought Protection here.</p>
               <p>However the Parliament conſented to the Naturalization—, but Limited and Reſtricted the Protection he ſought with ſuch juſt and reaſonable Clauſes, as that Monſieur <hi>Hugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> never thought fit to take the Benefit of it, but went away to <hi>Holland,</hi> where, what became of him, how he was near being Trapann'd away into <hi>France,</hi> where his Fate had been moſt certain; How the States General reſented the Attempt, and puniſhed the Perſons, tho', at the ſame time, they did it in Reſpect to their own Juriſdictions and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, rather than in reſpect to the Perſon—; How afterward he was Marryed to Madamoiſell <hi>D'Odyke,</hi> in ſpite of all the Oppoſition made by Monſieur <hi>D'Auverkirke</hi> her near Relation, and Velt Mareſchal of the Forces of the States; Theſe things, as not material to this Hiſtory, I ſhall take no notice of, and only mention the other, to let the World ſee, That, tho' the Enemies of <hi>Scotland</hi> loudly clamoured, that, for the ſake of bringing Money thither, they would make themſelves the Sanctuary of the moſt Infamous Perſons; yet, that upon the Application of this Man, they clogg'd the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour they beſtowed with ſuch juſt Clauſes in Relief of the Claims of private Perſons, that, if the Perſon ſought any Sanctuary againſt his juſt Debts, he found it was not to be had in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and therefore he was ſo far intirely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed.

               <head>OBSERVATION LII.</head>
               <p>The Affair of the Courts of Admiralty and Exchequer, need very little Remark, they were by the Nineteenth Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle reſerved, and their diſtinct Powers are very expreſly ſtated in the Article it ſelf, nor did it occaſion any great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate in the Parliament; for thoſe Debates which were raiſed upon a ſuppoſition of the Union taking place, it was obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, gave the Houſe the leaſt Trouble—, which I take to be a further proof, that the main Deſign in Oppoſing and Debating the Particulars, was, as they pointed at the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and it was therefore a juſt Obſervation, that any Head of Argument became more or leſs vigourſly oppoſed, as it, more or leſs puſhed at the Union in General.</p>
               <p>The Office of the Lord high Admiral for all <hi>Britain,</hi> it was abſolutely neceſſary to reduce to one—; But the Courts of Admiralty having their ſeveral Juriſdictions &amp; Authorities were as neceſſary as ſeveral private Rights, which by the next Article were to be reſerved, depending intirely upon it.</p>
               <p>The heretable Rights of Admiralty, &amp; the Vice Admiralties, were alſo neceſſary to be ſupported; and all theſe Things made it abſolutely neceſſary to preſerve a Court of Admiralty, the Tryals being to be had in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and which by the Conſtitution and Laws of <hi>Scotland,</hi> reſerved as before, could not be legally Transferred to, or taken Cognizance of by the Court of Admiralty of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The like in the Affair of the Exchequer, where, if the Seizures of the Cuſtoms, if private Rights and Debates between the Queen and Subject, could not have been Tryed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the General Reſerve of the Laws to <hi>Scotland;</hi> could not have been maintained, and the Subject would have been put to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable Inconveniencies and Expences in Purſuing and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending in all Pleas of the Crown, or Caſes between the Queen and Her Subjects.</p>
               <p>Theſe Things therefore admitted of very little Debate, but were regulated by the Methods required by the Cuſtoms and Forms of Law, and then paſt as it were in courſe.</p>
               <p>The Affair of the Privy Council was alſo left to its own Fate, the Story of which I omit here, becauſe it will come neceſſarly to be ſpoken of in the ſubſequent part of this
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0554400100:461"/>
Hiſtory, when it was Depoſed with ſome Struggle, and as ſome thought, a little ſooner than was needful.</p>
               <p>The preſent Article, which I take to be a very Extenſive one, had paſſed, and been in all its parts Unexceptionable, had not one unhappy Word been brought in, and this was the word <hi>S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>PERIORITIES;</hi> But this being added without any Condition or Power left in Parliament to Diſſolve thoſe Superiorities, upon an Equivalent to the Owners, whenever the United Parliament ſhould find Occaſion for the publick Good to do ſo; has bound down <hi>Scotland</hi> to the private Tyrrany and Oppreſſion of the Heretors and Lairds, which it is eaſie to make appear, is at this Time one of the greateſt Obſtructions to Her Peace and Proſperity.</p>
               <p>The Superiorities meant here, are the Rights of Vaſſalage which the Gentry of <hi>Scotland</hi> have over the People, which, as it is Extended, gives the Chiefs and Heads of Clans, Lairds and Heretors, ſuch an abſolute Dominion over both the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Goods of the poor ſubjected People, as ſeems per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly inconſiſtent both with the Peace and the Improvement of <hi>Scotland</hi> in particular, or of any Free Nation in General, and this two ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As it gives too great a Power to particular perſons, who are thereby rendred Independent of the Law, and put in too eaſie a Condition to Inſult the Government, and break the publick Peace; Inſtances of which have been given ſince the Union, as ſhall particularly appear in the Proceſs of this Hiſtory, where Perſons by the Aſſiſtance of their Tenantry, and the Dominion of their own Superiorities, protected them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the publick Juſtice, and bid Defiance to the juſt Reſentments and Suſpicions of the Government, even in a Time of <hi>French</hi> Invaſion—. That a Power to put any one in ſuch a poſture, is inconſiſtent with the publick peace; I need not ſpend Time here to Diſpute, and <hi>Scotland</hi> may have, and I doubt will have occaſion to acknowledge.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As it keeps the Common People and Tenantry of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in a Condition inconſiſtent with the Liberty of a Free Nation, and under an intolerable Slavery to their Landlords, by which they are effectually prevented either Improving their Stocks for themſelves, or their Lands for their Landlords;—, which the Landlord himſelf effectually prevents, by his abſolutely Ruining and Devouring their Induſtry at his own will.</p>
               <p>This Subject is too long for the Extent of a ſingle Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and will be more particularly ſpoken to in its place; but I note it here as the proper Subject of the place, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Day when it was introduc'd into the Treaty, and had only this Unhappineſs, that it came in, as it were, by Head and Shoulders, without any previous Conditionary Clauſe—; I do not alledge, That the Superiorities of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0554400100:462"/>
ſhould have been taken away by Law, without Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made to the private Eſtates of thoſe, from whom they ſhould have been taken, farther is it yet from me to ſay, or think, they ſhould be ſurrendered to the Crown—; But certainly had it been left to a Parliament of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> to have Diſſolved them upon any juſt Occaſion, and, by Land or Money, have made a full Recompence to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors, and ſo have broken that Bond of Slavery by which <hi>Scotland</hi> has been ſo long ſuppreſs'd, and the Poor kept Poor, their Induſtry diſcouraged, and their Labour devoured; From that Day the Nation had dated its Liberty and Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity; Plenty, and Encouragement to Trade and Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures muſt have followed, ſince no People can be ſuppoſed to Work cheerfully, when they cannot enjoy what they gain, or call it their own.</p>
               <p>But this was a Time of Hurry, and People could not look about them as at other Times; Nor was the Liberty of the poor People ſo near in View, as to move that Concern in Mens minds, which perhaps were it now to be done, might be otherwiſe; Whether this or the Fate of <hi>Scotland,</hi> I ſhall not Determine as the Cauſe of the Omiſſion—. But 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, The Thing is <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhappily for Scotland,</hi> Omitted; And the great Opportunity of extending the Love of Liberty, as well as the Taſte of it, to all the People Irrecoverably Loſt.</p>
               <p>The Rights of the Burghs came next to be Debated, the whole Rights of the Burrows were reſerved to them by the Union; Nor was any Thing offered now to Abridge thoſe Rights, yet it was thought, it both might be the Advantage of the Burrows, and of the Nation in General, to have thoſe Rights ſubjected to Parliamentary Regulations, but ſome People took an Alarm at this, as if the Parliament in time coming, would take away the Privileges of the Royal Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows; and thus in this particular Time of Jealouſie, the great Advantages which both the Burghs of <hi>Scotland</hi> in particular, and the People of <hi>Scotland</hi> in General, might have had from Parliamentary Regulations, were loſt and Forecloſed, and the Door Barr'd againſt any future Alterations to be made by Parliament, were they never ſo much to the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and Benefit of the reſpective Parts.</p>
               <p>The next Thing brought upon the Stage, was the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and Manner of Electing the Repreſentative, it had been moved in the Debates of the Third Article, but was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely Adjourned to this, as the proper Time of entring upon it—. It was too long an Affair to begin at the end of the Day; ſo it was Adjourned to the next <hi>Sederunt,</hi> when it took up Time enough.</p>

               <p>But before Voting, there were Four ſeveral Proteſts given in, <hi>viz.</hi> One by the Duke of <hi>Athole,</hi> a Second by the Earl of <hi>Buchan,</hi> a Third by <hi>George Lockhart</hi> of <hi>Carnwath,</hi> and a Fourth by <hi>Walter Stuart</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner for the Burgh of <hi>Linlithgow,</hi> all againſt the ſaid Vote, and the ſeveral Proteſters took Inſtruments thereupon.</p>

               </p>

               <p>The Affair of the Number of the Repreſentative, whether of the Nobility or Commons, was the Contents of the firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph now debated; How, and with what Difficulty, this part of the Equality was ſettled in <hi>England,</hi> has been noted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and the Reaſonableneſs of the Proportion duly ſtated there.</p>
               <p>It was indeed urged again here, and ſeveral ways diſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but the Diſputes here ſeemed to look another way; And firſt it was vigorouſly oppoſed, That <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould come to any Repreſentative at all; That her whole Parliament ſhould ſit in Conjunction with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament, and long Speeches were made on that Head; Some alledging, That it was Diſhonourable to <hi>Scotland</hi> to leſſen the Number of her Repreſentative, while <hi>England</hi> retained her intire Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Others again attempted to argue againſt the very Uniting of the Parliament at all, tho' that was forecloſed by the firſt Vote paſs'd on the Third Article—. 3. Others yet went into the Merit of the Cauſe, and to Examine the juſt Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Repreſentative, and theſe objected very vigorouſly, that the Numbers were not equal—; The Opinions were variouſly divided, as to the Foundation of a true Equality, upon what Principle an Equality of Proportions could be raiſed—; Some ſtating the Numbers of People to be the Teſt of the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative; others the Proportion of Taxes, ſome an Eſtimate from both; others alledged, there could be no juſt Rule laid down, how an equal Proportion of Repreſentatives could be made, to ballance a Kingdom that is not <hi>IT SELF</hi> equally repreſented, and that before <hi>England</hi> had required <hi>Scotland</hi> to reduce their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative to a juſt Proportion <hi>to her,</hi> ſhe ought to have reduced her own Repreſentative to a juſt Proportion to her ſelf, either in Number of People, or Payment of Taxes, neither of which, <hi>as they alledged,</hi> were at all regarded in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; That it was the Complaint in <hi>England,</hi> and ſeveral had wrote very warmly upon that Subject, that their Taxes were not equally Levyed, or their People equally Repreſented; and it was unreaſonable to talk of proportioning <hi>Scotland</hi> to a Country, whoſe Repreſentative was not in its ſelf equal.</p>
               <p>There were ſeveral Anſwers given to this, the preſent Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of both Nations in general ſeemed to be the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Foundation of a Proportion, wherein, tho' the particular Towns in <hi>England</hi> might not be juſtly proportioned, yet the general might be equal, and thus, without enquiring, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0554400100:466"/>
the parts of the Repreſentative were equally choſen in <hi>England,</hi> it might be a juſt Proportion, in having the whole brought to a State; And if the Number for <hi>Scotland</hi> bare the ſame Proportion to the Number for <hi>England,</hi> as the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of People, and Wealth or Payment of Taxes, joyntly conſidered, of the one part bare to the ſame Articles in the other, the Equality was then preſerved—.</p>
               <p>It was remembred, That this had been fully debated in <hi>England,</hi> and that the Number was brought up to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Proportion that <hi>England</hi> could poſſibly grant—; Mr. <hi>Seton,</hi> in his Speech printed in the Minutes herewith, <hi>Folio</hi> 79<hi>th,</hi> declared, it was above what <hi>Scotland</hi> ought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, and that it was a full Proportion.

               <p>Then the third Paragraph of the twenty ſecond Article of Union, beginning thus; <hi>And if Her Majeſty on or before the firſt day of</hi> May <hi>next,</hi> &amp;c. and ending with theſe Words: <hi>And that Parliaments may continue for ſuch time only as the preſent Parliament of</hi> England <hi>might have continued if the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of the two Kingdoms had not been made, unleſs ſooner diſſolved by Her Majeſty,</hi> was read.</p>

               <p>The Debate about the Proteſtations of the Four Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men above-mentioned, ended now, after ſome Heat, in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Proteſtations to be Recorded and Enrolled in the Regiſters of Parliament, which ſatisfied all Parties.</p>
               <p>It was very much enquired after, Why theſe Proteſtations ſhould not be made publick, ſince the Gentlemen that made them, did not concern themſelves to Conceal them; Some alledged, The Parliament behoved to enter into a Confutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Matter of the Proteſts, if they made them publick, and either to Approve or Cenſure them: Others thought, The publiſhing them might do Harm among the people; and that ſince the Parliament were now juſt at the End of the Work, it was better to keep them all Eaſie, than ſtart any new Diſpute. So the Proteſts were not publiſhed, but En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in the Rolls or Regiſters Office of the Kingdom of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>—, from whence the true Copies of them are taken, and added in the <hi>Appendix</hi> to this Work N<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> 
                  <hi>L. M. N. O.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then they went upon the Debate of Triennial Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, included in the Third Paragraph of the Twenty Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Article—, and ſome were very Urgent for a new Clauſe, as in the Minute—; But when the Gentlemen were put in mind, That by the very Words of the Paragraph, it was expreſly provided, That the Firſt Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> could ſit no longer than the next enſuing Seſſion, being the Termination of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament then in Beeing, and that by the Act then in Force in <hi>England,</hi> called <hi>The Triennial Act,</hi> every Parliament was to Terminate in Three Years; The Thing appeared already ſettled, and ſo admitted no further Debate, that Law being among others, continued by the Twenty Fifth Article; Of which in its or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>

                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:0554400100:470"/>
It was very ſtrange, that notwithſtanding the Debates of this Day, and the expreſs Proviſion of the Treaty many People flattered themſelves with the Notion of the Parliaments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing to ſit, nor could it be beaten out of their Thoughts in <hi>England</hi> as well as in <hi>Scotland,</hi> till they ſaw the very Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations making for a new Election.</p>
               <p>The Propoſal for Explaining the ſeveral Oaths to be taken by the Members of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, was Oppoſed, not that there could be any concealed Oath, that was not known to the Members—; And the particular Oaths of Allegiance, the Declaration, and Abjuration were laid before the Houſe—, but the Gentlemen who thought fit to Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it, did it on this Foot, That they thought the Articles ſo expreſly directed to the particular Acts in which the ſaid Oaths were contain'd, and in which no other Oaths were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, that the Acts being named at large, and referred to, And the Cuſtom and Uſage of Parliament known, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, there could be no poſſible Fraud, Miſtake, or Miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, but that it was this way as expreſly and directly pointed out, as if it had been Repeated in the Articles, Word for Word.</p>
               <p>The Exception about the <hi>Limitation,</hi> mentioned in the 13. <hi>William</hi> III. <hi>Cap.</hi> 6. referring to the Qualification of the Succeſſors to the Crown, alſo will come to be ſpoken to again in its place.</p>
               <p>The Overture about the Qualification of Perſons to Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of Truſt, has been ſpoken to more than once already, and needs no further Obſervation at this Time.</p>

               <p>This whole Day was taken up in debating the Subject of the Word <hi>Limitation,</hi> mentioned in that Famous Act of 13<hi>th W.</hi> 3. in <hi>England</hi>—; Some had alledged, That, by that Act, if any Perſon took upon him the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified by any of the Articles therein-named, the Allegiance
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0554400100:472"/>
Sworn was not due, and that the Subject would be thereby obliged, by his Oath, to oppoſe ſuch Succeſſor; Others had declared the Limitations to mean nothing but an Entail of the Succeſſion by Parliament, without any Conditions of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and upon theſe ſeeming Uncertainties, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that moved this Clauſe demanded an Explanation; but it was, upon the whole, not thought proper to undertake any Explanation of an Act, which, as it ſtood, ſeemed ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſettle the Proteſtant Succeſſion, and could not hurt the preſent Scheme, ſince, ſo far as it might oppoſe any Branch of the Union, it was provided againſt in the Twenty Fifth Article; And to put any Conſtruction upon it, which might be inconſiſtent with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Affairs, would be but to lay a Stumbling Block in the way of the Union, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Project was alſo rejected.</p>
               <p>The Affair of the Sacramental Teſt had been mentioned before, but never ſo plainly moved in Parliament as now; It had been moved in the Commiſſion of the Aſſembly, and great Endeavours had been uſed, to bring the Miniſters in, as Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors, and a <hi>Formula</hi> like this had been propoſed there, as is noted already, but it failed on their ſide; The Miniſters were, in the firſt place, not willing to meddle with Things of that Nature; And, ſecondly, As to the <hi>Formula,</hi> many of the Miniſters gave their Opinion, That they did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of Impoſing any Oath, or Acknowledgment of the Church, as a Teſt of Civil Imployment; And, to have an Oath of Acknowledgment to the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> be a Counter Teſt, was a Tacit Approbation of the Method practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in <hi>England,</hi> which they deteſted.</p>
               <p>Others again were of the Opinion, That the Subjects of <hi>Scotland</hi> were already, by the Union, Exempted from the Sacramental Teſt in <hi>England</hi> by two ſeveral Clauſes—; 1. In that the Subjects of both Kingdoms were, by the Fourth Article of the Union, to enjoy equal Privileges and Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements—; And, 2. That, by the Adam for the Security of the Church Government, no Oath was to be Impoſed upon the Members of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their Principles—; In arguing the firſt of theſe, it was alledged, That, <hi>if a Subject of</hi> Scotland <hi>taking the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament in the National Eſtabliſh'd Church of</hi> Scotland, <hi>ſhall not be capable of any Place of Preferment under the Government of</hi> Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, <hi>as well as a Subject of</hi> England <hi>taking the Sacrament in the National Eſtabliſh'd Church of</hi> England; Then, do not the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of either Kingdom enjoy <hi>Equal Privileges</hi>—; And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it was argued, That, by the laſt Article of the Treaty, the Sacramental Teſt might be underſtood to be actually Repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as Contraveening the Equalities of the Treaty.</p>
               <p>Upon theſe Debates it was thought, That, to meddle with this Matter, might do much more Harm than Good; And
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0554400100:473"/>
therefore, it was firſt let fall without Doors, and now reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within, and the Article paſs'd without it.</p>

               <p>The Debates of this Day related wholly to the Privileges of the Peers, and particularly to the differing Privileges
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0554400100:474"/>
of thoſe who were to ſit in the Parliament of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> from thoſe who were not, <hi>i. e.</hi> for the time they were to ſit; Some would have had it, That thoſe that did not ſit, ſhould have no manner of Privilege, any more than as a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, till ſuch time as they ſhould come to ſit by Election in the Houſe of Lords, and then thoſe that were formerly ſitting Peers, or Parliament Lords, became diveſted of all their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, unleſs they were of the New Election—; Some thought, the Gentlemen, who were of this Opinion, moved it chiefly, to bring the Peers into a Diſtaſte of the Union, (all other Hopes being now almoſt over, as to the Union on the Side of <hi>Scotland</hi>)—; And that the Nobility being thereby, as it were, degraded of their Characters, would think it too great a Hardſhip, and ſo fly off from the Treaty in general, or fly to ſome Extreme on the other Hand, make<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing ſome Demand which the Peers of <hi>England</hi> would not ſubmit to.</p>
               <p>Others, it was thought, had this further View in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, for Levelling the <hi>Scots</hi> Nobility that were not ſitting Peers with the Commons, That they deſigned to propoſe the unſitting Lords to be capable of being Elected into the Houſe of Commons, and ſitting in the Lower Houſe.</p>
               <p>This was received with ſome Reſentment, as a great Diſhonour to the Peerage of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by ſome people, and eſpecially without Doors; The <hi>Engliſh</hi> were Upbraided with endeavouring to have it ſo—, in order to leſſen the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the Nobility of <hi>Scotland.</hi> But in this they wrong'd their own Judgment, as well as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, ſince, had ſuch a Thing been offered, it had been rejected in <hi>England,</hi> as Unequal and Injurious to the Equality we have been ſo often ſpeaking of, as the Ground of the whole Treaty—. Nor could it have been Conſented to in <hi>England,</hi> ſince it had been a bringing the <hi>Scots</hi> Nobility into too great an Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Parliamentary Affairs, when Sixteen being already judged ſufficient; there might be now Sixty One <hi>Scots</hi> Lords in every Parliament, <hi>viz.</hi> Sixteen in the Houſe of Lords, and Fourty Five in the Commons; Which, when any Thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating, eſpecially to the Nobility, or to the Privileges of one Houſe againſt the other, might turn the Ballance to this or that ſide, to the manifeſt Injury of the Conſtitution, which now conſiſts in the Equality of Powers and Privileges, and the due Limits ſet between each kind, to prevent their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment upon one another.</p>
               <p>But the Wiſdom and Modeſty of the Nobility of <hi>Scotland,</hi> prevented this—; and the Article had been ſo well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered at <hi>London,</hi> and was ſo warily Worded, that there was Room for little or no Exception on behalf of the Peers: For 1. As to Privileges, the Sixteen Peers, or the Peers of Parliament for the Time being, had effectually all the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0554400100:475"/>
of the Peers of <hi>England</hi> in the utmoſt Extent, and all the Privileges they ever after could receive, could not be received but in Common with the ſaid Sixteen; Nor could any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception be made to it, Whether in the Caſes of Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Privileges, or the perſonal Privileges in caſe of Trying of Peers, or being Tryed as Criminals.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The remainder of the Nobility enjoyed Privileges, every way equal to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility, excepting only, <hi>as it is in the Article,</hi> the Rights of ſitting in the Houſe of Lords, and the Privileges depending thereupon.</p>
               <p>But the great Debates of this Day began upon this Clauſe, The Rights and Privileges of the <hi>Scots</hi> Nobility who were not Lords of Parliament <hi>for the Time being.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And Firſt it was moved to be excepted, That the ſaid Lords ſhould not enjoy the Privilege of perſonal Protection in Caſes of Debt, as is the Privilege of the Peers of <hi>England</hi>—; Some alledged they pleaded for the Honour of the <hi>Scots</hi> Nobility in this Head, that it was below their Dignity to be protected by their Titles againſt their juſt Obligations, and a Meanneſs they had all along Contemned, to plead the Privilege of their Houſe againſt the proceedings of the Law; That it was not agreeable to the true Intent and Meaning of Parliamentary Privileges, that this Privilege ſhould extend to thoſe that did not ſit in Parliament, ſince the Privileges of Parliament of this kind, were at firſt appointed to provide againſt any Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment to ſitting in Parliament, that the Members of either Houſes ſhould on no pretence what ever, be hindred from the Service of their Countrey in Parliament—; And this could not be of any Signification in thoſe Peers that were not ſitting Members of the Houſe of Lords; That for the <hi>Scots</hi> Peers to claim Protection for their Perſons againſt their juſt Debts, was more than levelling their Perſons with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, for it was ſetting them below the Commons, ſince no Man would then Truſt the Nobility in Matters of Debt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome Commoner being Security for them, againſt whom they might have remedy at Law.</p>
               <p>Theſe Objections had no little Weight, and this Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of the Perſons of the Peers in Caſes of Debt, ſeemed at firſt View, very grievous to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and ſome of the Peers themſelves looked upon it as Diſhonourable.</p>
               <p>But when it was calmly Conſidered and Anſwered, That the Perſons of the Peers in <hi>England,</hi> are accounted Sacred on ſeveral Accounts, beſides thoſe of Debt—, that even the Government can not proceed againſt a Peer, but in an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary way, that no Warrant can be Executed in the Houſe of a Peer, but by Three Juſtices of the Peace—; And that there are ſeveral neceſſary Exemptions to the Peerage which this Privilege preſerves, beſides that of Debt—; And which, as they are the Hereditary Counſellors of the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0554400100:476"/>
Nation, and have frequently Great Truſts committed to, them—; And both are, and ought to be a great and ready Aſſiſtance to the publik Good, upon ſudden Emergencies, which, upon pretence of Arreſts and Attachments for Debt, may be prevented. That as to the Juſtice of Perſonal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection in caſe of Debt, it was Anſwered, Their Eſtates were not protected in ſeveral Caſes, only their Perſons—; And it was as Reaſonable to purſue the Eſtate, as the Perſon of the Debitor—, and eſpecially in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where the Law reaches the Effects of the Debitor, tho' on perſonal Bonds—. That as to the Credit and Honour of being protected againſt juſt Debts, it would be much more for the Honour of the <hi>Scots</hi> Nobility, that they gave all Men Notice, That they deſpiſed the Advantage of their perſonal Credit, and ſince they could not Sue a Nobleman, they might Decline Truſting them, and welcome: And for thoſe that were Truſted, tho' they could not be Sued, it was yet greater Reputation to them, that the principle of Honour in them was ſo well known, that Men would depend upon their Honour, where they could not otherwiſe oblige them to make payment.</p>
               <p>Upon theſe, and the like Conſiderations, this Motion was Rejected, and the <hi>Scots</hi> Nobility by virtue of that Clauſe in the Twenty Third Article, <hi>And ſhall enjoy all other privileges of Peers, as fully as the Peers of</hi> England <hi>now do, or as they, or any other Peers of</hi> Great-Britain <hi>may hereafter enjoy the ſame;</hi> are protected in their Perſons and Eſtates as the Peers of <hi>England</hi> are—, whether they (the <hi>Scots</hi> Peers) are Peers of Parliament at that Time, or no.</p>
               <p>The next Diſpute was, a Privilege demanded for the Peers of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that they, not being of the Parliament at that Time, might ſit in the Houſe of Lords Cover'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but not have any Right to Vote—; This was Urged many ways, either that they might have a Gallery to ſit in as Spectators, or that they might ſtand behind the Throne, as the eldeſt Sons of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Peers may—; And either of theſe, was thought, might have been obtained—. But the main Deſign of bringing them in to be preſent at Debates, to Argue, Speak and Debate upon the ſeveral Matters that ſhould be brought before the Houſe, this was Oppoſed upon ſeveral Accounts; <hi>Firſt,</hi> As it was thought Impracticable, and an Invaſion of the Houſe of Peers as a Houſe, and what could not be obtained, if puſht at. <hi>Secondly,</hi> As it was thought an Inſignificant Thing, to have perſons to ſit and argue, who had no power to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine. And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As it would be far from any Honour to the Nobility of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to be admitted into Debates, where they muſt always have the Mortification of being diſtinguiſhed, and like meer Solicitors, whoſe place is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Bar, be allowed to Talk, and yet have no ſignification in a Queſtion—; But if the Houſe divided, be obliged to
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0554400100:477"/>
ſtand all together like Mutes in an Alphabet, who have no ſound in the Expreſſion of a Syllable.</p>
               <p>And thus ended the Debates of this great point, the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of the Peerage, and the Article received no manner of Alteration.</p>

               <p>The Debate of the Rank and Precedency of the Heraulds, and of the Quartering of Arms, the Standards and Colours was a Thing of no great Conſequence, nor could it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to any Body better than to Her Majeſty; and therefore the Diſpute of this was not long.</p>
               <p>The keeping the Honours, as they called them, in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, viz.</hi> The Crown, Scepter and Sword, was indeed a Material Point, at leaſt, as it had been made ſo by ſome Gentlemen, who had pretended to excite the Common People with Apprehenſions, That they were to be all carryed away to <hi>England,</hi> as Tokens of Surrendering the Sovereignty of <hi>Scotland</hi> to the <hi>Engliſh</hi>—; But, as no ſuch Thing was ever thought of in <hi>England,</hi> the Propoſal met with no Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; And ſome people thought, That not only the Enſigns of Royalty, but the Royalty it ſelf, Sovereignty and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Scotland,</hi> remain as intire, as the ſame Things reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>England</hi> remain intire, either Kingdom voluntarly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to an Union of Power, an Union of Government, and of all Things needful to preſerve both.</p>
               <p>The laſt Article, reſpecting the Abrogation of all Laws, which might be ſuppoſed to Contraveen the Treaty, met with no Oppoſition at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And thus this Weighty Affair was Finiſhed on the Side of</hi> Scotland, <hi>contrary, I believe I may ſay, to the Expectation of all the World, who were amazed to ſee a Thing of that Conſequence, and with Difficulties which ſeemed in themſelves inſuperable, ſo ſucceſsfully brought to a Cloſe; A Thing which had been ſo many Times attempted in vain; A Thing which had ſo often been ſet about, rather in a Show than Deſign of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niting; And I think I may ſay, a Thing that never was heartily ſet about on both Sides before.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It had held the Parliament of</hi> Scotland <hi>a Long, a Troubleſome, a Dangerous, and I muſt owne a very <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncomfortable Debate, Step by Step, and Article by Article, from the Third of</hi> October <hi>to the Fourteenth of</hi> January, <hi>with very little Intermiſſion, for never was Buſineſs cloſer applyed, more ſtrenuouſly puſh'd, or more vigorouſly oppoſed.</hi>

The Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> having been effectually ſecured by an Act of Parliament, called, <hi>The Act of Security,</hi> &amp;c. and which was made a part of the Act of Union, as appears in its place; There was a Clauſe added in the End of the Act of Union, in theſe Words; <hi>Declaring nevertheleſs, that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of</hi> England <hi>may provide for the Security of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>as they ſhall think Expedient, to take place within the Bounds of the ſaid Kingdom of</hi> England, <hi>and not Derogating from the Security above provided for Eſtabliſhing the Church of</hi> Scotland <hi>within the Bounds of this Kingdom, which ſhall not Suſpend or Derogate from the Force and Effect of this preſent Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, but ſhall be underſtood as here included, without any neceſſity of any new Ratification in the Parliament of</hi> Scotland.</p>

               <p>The Parliament of <hi>England</hi> being to be the Finiſhers of this great Work, and the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> not Meeting till it was late enough in the year, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſecond of <hi>October;</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament were by ſmall Adjournments, put off, as long as it was poſſible the publick Affairs of <hi>England</hi> could permit, and longer than any Parliament ſince the <hi>Revolution</hi> had been delayed, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Met till the Third of <hi>December</hi>—, when the publick Buſineſs admitting no more delay, they came together:</p>
               <p>It is worth Obſervation, that this was a ſtrange concurring Juncture, a Critical Moment, as it may be called, in which Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſeemed to bring every Thing together, that could Propagate the Great Affair of the Uniting the Kingdoms; And which it may not be Improper to Notice in this place, becauſe at the Opening of this Seſſion of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament, the Queen Her ſelf took No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it.</p>
               <p>The Campaign Abroad had Ended in the moſt Glorious manner for the Confederates, that could be deſired, and above all manner of Expectation, the <hi>French</hi> had received three Blows that very Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, enough to Overthrow the greateſt Empire in the World; One under the Conduct of the Earl of <hi>Peterburgh,</hi> with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces and Fleet in the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> Relieving the City of <hi>Barce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lona,</hi> and cauſing the <hi>French</hi> with the Loſs of all their Cannon and Ammunition, to raiſe the Siege; One under the Command of the Duke of <hi>Marlborough,</hi> being the great Victory at <hi>Ramellies</hi> in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;</hi> And the laſt under the Command of Prince <hi>Eugene</hi> of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,</hi> at <hi>Turin.</hi> In all which Actions, it was Calculated, that the <hi>French</hi> loſt, Slain in Action, Taken Priſoners, Deſerted, and Dead of their Wounds, above 100000 Men, with 300 pieces of Cannon and Mortars, and other Spoil without, and indeed paſt all manner of Account.</p>
               <p>There are two Reaſons, why I take this Occaſion to mention this here—, and both are Introductory to the preſent Affair.<list>
                     <item>1. The People of <hi>England</hi> by theſe great Succeſſes, made Glad and Eaſie in Hopes of a ſpeedy Peace, were prepared to Grant almoſt any thing which the Queen in Reaſon could Ask, and the Queen diſcovering a paſſionate Deſire, to ſee Her two Jarring, long Contending Kingdoms United, the Parliament came together with a Temper diſpoſed to yield (as far as Reaſon could ſuggeſt) more, than perhaps at any other Juncture could have been expected.</item>

2. The Enemies of the Union, whether Abroad or at Home, received moſt ſenſible Diſcouragement in their Deſigns againſt it—, and firſt Abroad.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>There could be but two kinds of Enemies Abroad, to the Union, and theſe were the <hi>French,</hi> or the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> they were now in ſo cloſs a Confederacy with <hi>England,</hi> and their whole Concern as to the War, was ſo involved together, that there was no Room for any publick Differences about it. Nor indeed could the <hi>Dutch</hi> have put in any rational Objection againſt it, to either Side, if the Intereſt of <hi>Holland</hi> Claſht with the Union upon any ſort, it was only with reſpect to Trade; and tho' they might perhaps on that Score, have ſome Reaſon to be Jealous of it, as what might <hi>ſome Time or other</hi> Claſh with them in the Fiſhing and Eaſtern Trades, yet they could have no pretence to concern themſelves publickly and Nationally againſt it. And as for private Negotiations to Embarraſs or prevent it, tho' as <hi>I have been Informed,</hi> they were once or twice conſidering of it, yet they never thought fit to meddle, whether it was that they ſaw no proſpect of ſucceeding in it, or that they were not willing to do any thing at that Time, that ſhould give an Uneaſineſs to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or not, I ſhall not pretend to Determine.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>French,</hi> theſe had no doubt Stomach enough to it, and had Tools enough to work with; And I muſt own, had they but made the leaſt Attempt, they had effectually broke up the Treaty for that Time; But GOD had tyed their Hands, and Cut them out other Work, they were beſet and Embarraſt on every Hand, and had no Leaſure to look this way; Nor, if they had had Leaſure, had they Men or Money then to ſpare, being Imployed with all their Power and Diligence, to Recruit their Troops, and Reſtore their own Affairs.</p>
               <p>And I cannot but Record this, as a ſingular Hand of Heaven, in the Affair of the Union; For tho', when the next year the <hi>French</hi> did make an Attempt upon <hi>Scotland,</hi> when their Affairs being bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered after their Succeſs in <hi>Spain,</hi> they thought themſelves in a Condition for it—, they found it too late; And that the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers of the Union were ſettled, and would not appear for them—, yet I muſt ſay, had they made that Attempt at the Time of this Treaty, whatever they might have done in the End, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Opening the Eyes of the People, and Reſtoring them to their Senſes, they had certainly put all the Nation into the utmoſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion for the Time, and effectually have broken up the Treaty.</p>
               <p>The Parliament of <hi>England</hi> was now Met <hi>December</hi> 3. 1707, &amp; the Queen Opened the Seſſion with the following Speech, which I Inſert here, as it refers to the Treaty of Union, and alſo as it Hints at the Succeſſes I mentioned above.</p>

                           <p>In Purſuance of the Powers Veſted in Me by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> I have appointed Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to Treat of an Union between the Two Kingdoms, and tho' this be a Work of ſuch a Nature, as could not but be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with great Difficulties, yet ſuch has been the Application of the Commiſſioners, that they have Concluded a Treaty, which is at this Time before the Parliament of <hi>Scotland;</hi> And I Hope the Mutual Advantages of an Entire Union of the Two Kingdoms will be found ſo apparent, that it will not be long before I ſhall have an Opportunity of Acquainting You with the Succeſs which it has Met with there.</p>
                           <p>Your Meeting at this Time being Later than Uſual, I cannot Conclude, without Earneſtly Recommending to You to Give as
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0554400100:487"/>
much Diſpatch to the Publick Affairs, as the Nature of them will Admit, it being of the Greateſt Conſequence, that both Our Friends and Our Enemies ſhou'd be Fully Convinced of Your Firmneſs, and the Vigour of Your Proceedings.</p>

               </q>
               <p>I ſhall not meddle here with any of the Proceedings of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <hi>England</hi> in their own Affairs, they having no relation to the Caſe in Hand; Only make this ſhort Remark, That, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Lateneſs of their coming together, <hi>the Occaſion of which was known to be to attend the Debates of the Parliament of</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, they fell ſo heartily about their Buſineſs, and went on ſo ſmoothly in every Thing, that they got the Land Tax Bill paſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſooner in it than it uſed to be in any former Parliaments—; And before <hi>Chriſtmaſs,</hi> had not only the Land Tax, but ſeveral other of their Publick Funds ſettled, and in an unuſual Forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs—, which is a Confirmation of the Extraordinary Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which, as I have noted, appeared in <hi>England</hi> at this time, and of which we ſhall ſee further Inſtances preſently.</p>
               <p>It was the Sixteenth Day of <hi>January,</hi> that the Ratification of the Union paſs'd in <hi>Scotland;</hi> On the Eighteenth the Duke of <hi>Queensberry</hi> diſpatch'd it away by an Expreſs; There were ſeveral Gentlemen who contended for the Honour of Carrying it up to the Queen, but, to avoid giving any Offence, it was ſent by an ordinary Courrier or Expreſs.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as it came to the Queen, Her Majeſty cauſed it to be laid before both Houſes, that, tho' it was firſt to paſs one Houſe, and then the other, yet the particular Houſes might be upon the ſeveral Articles together.</p>
               <p>Great was the Expectation in both Kingdoms from theſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament, and in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Fears on one Hand, and the Hopes on the other, are not to be expreſs'd—, but the Houſe of Commons deceived both Sides.</p>
               <p>On the Twenty Second of <hi>January</hi> it was read in the Houſe of Commons—. and as the beſt way to go thro' the whole, they ordered every Article to be Read and Voted upon ſingly in the Committee of the whole Houſe.</p>
               <p>It may perhaps ſurprize Poſterity, when the <hi>Debates, Diſputes, Heats</hi> and long <hi>Speeches,</hi> which theſe Articles occaſioned in <hi>Scotland,</hi> come to be read—, and they ſhall come to underſtand, that, in the Houſe of Commons in <hi>England,</hi> every Article paſs'd one by one after the Sedateſt Reading, Calmeſt Conſidering, and Leaſurely Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, without any Oppoſition, Amendment or Alteration, no not in the leaſt.</p>
               <p>There was ſome ſmall Oppoſition againſt it in general in the Houſe of Lords—, but no Amendment offered to any particular Article, nor any thing conſiderable objected; what was objected ſeems generally contained in ſome Proteſts, and Reaſons given in by the Perſons Proteſting againſt it, which were but few, and not much noticed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:0554400100:488"/>
At the ſame time that the Articles were Reading in the Houſe of Commons, an Act was alſo prepared by the Biſhops, to whom that Affair was referred for Security of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to be paſſed in the Parliament, and then Ratified, by being Inſerted in the Body of the Act of Union, as the Act for the Security of of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> had been done before.</p>
               <p>This had been ſo far provided for by a Blank left in the Treaty of Ratification to which, ſo far as it concerned the Security of the Church of <hi>England</hi> only, the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> declared themſelves to aſſent, as if it was expreſſed; And this was thought but juſt, the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> having had the Drawing up, and Wording of their own Act of Security themſelves, tho' ſome People made loud Objections againſt this, as a plain Eſtabliſhing Epiſcopacy in <hi>England</hi> by the very Parliament of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was indeed leaving the Thing as Self-exiſtent, as it was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, it was abſolutely neceſſary, That the Treaty of Union ſhould be Ratified by either Kingdom—; But, as to the Acts ſeverally Eſtabliſhing the reſpective Churches, they were the diſtinct Act and Deed of either Kingdom: And, if the <hi>Scots</hi> may be ſaid to have Conſented to Eſtabliſh Epiſcopacy, it is every whit as plain, That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have Eſtabliſh'd Presbytery in <hi>Scotland,</hi> with this fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diſtinction, That what has been done in <hi>Scotland,</hi> is an Act of the State only, in <hi>England</hi> both Church and State have given their Sanction to the Eſtabliſhment of the Presbyterian Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Biſhops being the Repreſentatives of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in this Caſe—; At the ſame Time, I think the Matter clear, That, with reſpect to Union, their Eſtabliſhment is Recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally ſecure, and either Kingdoms cannot now put their Hand to the Weakening or Injuring the Eſtabliſhment of the other, without ſetting, at the ſame time, its Hand to the Deſtruction of its own Conſtitution.</p>
               <p>This Act for the Security of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſeems to be the exact Copy of the Act for Security of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> with the neceſſary Alterations only of Names, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A Teſtimony indeed unexpected to the Sufficiency of the Act of Security for <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in that the Church of <hi>England</hi> Divines being left to their full Liberty to make their Conſtitution as ſafe as it was poſſible to be, contented themſelves with the very ſame Model which the <hi>Scots</hi> had paſs'd for themſelves, as the beſt and compleateſt Security they could deviſe—, which they that cavilled ſo much at the Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Act in <hi>Scotland</hi> as inſufficient, might have received great Satisfaction from, if they had thought fit—.</p>
               <p>The Copy of this Act in <hi>England</hi> is added in the <hi>Appendix, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. H. xx.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I need not Count Days, nor Enter into the Minutes of this Affair in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament; It may ſuffice to tell the Reader, That the whole Act paſs'd both Houſes by the Fourth of <hi>March,</hi> and the Queen paſs'd it on the Sixth: It was deſigned to have delayed the paſſing it to the Eighth, which was the Day of Her Majeſties
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0554400100:489"/>
coming to the Crown; That ſo the Day might have been doubly Remembered, for the Commencement of Her Majeſties Reign over the Three Kingdoms firſt, and then over the United Kingdom of <hi>Britain;</hi> But Her Majeſty, not willing to delay a Thing which the whole Iſland waited ſo much for, and had their Eyes upon, went to the Houſe of Lords on the Sixth of <hi>March,</hi> and having paſs'd the Bill, made the following Speech, with which I think I may cloſe this ſhort Period of the Union, I mean its paſſing in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  <q>There was ſome Oppoſition made to the Articles in the Houſe of Lords in <hi>England,</hi> and ſome Lords Proteſted againſt the ſeveral Articles, and ſome againſt all of them—; But the Houſe of Lords in <hi>England</hi> having expreſly forbid the Printing any of the Proceedings of their Houſe, I cannot enter upon the Hiſtorical Part of it; I hope ſomething like an Abridgment of ſome Matters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be found in the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix,</hi> N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>.

                           <p>I conſider this UNION as a Matter of the greateſt Importance to the Wealth, Strength and Safety of the whole Iſland; And at the ſame time, as a Work of ſo much Difficulty and Nicety, in its own Nature, That, till now, all Attempts which have been made toward it, in the Courſe of above an Hundred Years, have proved ineffectual: And therefore I make no doubt, but it will be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred and ſpoke of hereafter, to the Honour of thoſe who have been Inſtrumental in bringing it to ſuch an Happy Concluſion.</p>
                           <p>I deſire and expect from all my Subjects of both Nations, That, from henceforth, they Act with all poſſible Reſpect and Kindneſs to one another, That ſo it may appear to all the World, they have Hearts diſpoſed to become one People.</p>

               <p>It was not very eaſie to know the Reaſon, why they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the Petitory part, as they called it, of this Paper to be inſerted in the Minutes—; Some were of the Opinion, it was to ſhow the Nation, That the Oppoſers of the Union were Friends to the Church, and that they would have it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, they ſtood up for the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi>—; Others thought it was with deſign to Expoſe the Presbyterians to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as utter Enemies to their Conſtitution—; Nor could I ever hear any other Reaſons given for it—. However, the Duke after having with ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty obtained a Vote upon it, <hi>LOST IT;</hi> And ſo the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation and Petition was left juſt where they found it, <hi>viz.</hi> As a Teſtimony of the Church againſt ſome Things which were thought to Claſh, both with their Conſtitution and a little with their Principles, and in this it was thought it had its Uſes, tho' it was not effectually Anſwered in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The Affair of the Electing their Members for the firſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <hi>Britain,</hi> came next upon the Stage, and the Ground of the Motion mentioned in the Minutes, was foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon a Suppoſition mentioned in the Twelfth Article of the Treaty, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Her Majeſty on or before the firſt day of</hi> May, <hi>on which day the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion was to take place, ſhould declare under the Great Seal of</hi> England, <hi>that it is Expedient that the Lords of Parliament of</hi> England, <hi>and Commons of the preſent Parliament of</hi> England, <hi>ſhould be the Members of the reſpective Houſes of the first Parliament of</hi> Great-Britain, <hi>for and on the part of</hi> Great-Britain.

               </p>
               <p>It was pretty eaſie to conjecture, that Her Majeſty would appoint theſe Members of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament, to Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute the firſt <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, as it after happened, and therefore this was Moved now—, in order to ſettle it in the Act of Parliament now to be made, in which it was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to be Determined, this Matter being to be Signed, and paſt into a Law, before the Union was to take place—.

               <p>The Reaſon of the Earl of <hi>Stair</hi>'s taking the Oaths now, and his place in Parliament, was very Unhappy at this Time; his Father the Earl of <hi>Stair,</hi> juſtly reputed the greateſt Man of Counſel in the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> died ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Eighth of this Moneth—; he had been an Eminent Inſtrument in carrying on the Union, and had, the very day of his Death, ſpoken very Earneſtly in the Houſe, upon ſome particular Caſes relating to the Union, he went out of the Houſe not very Well, yet went Home, and Wrote ſeveral Letters that very Night to <hi>England,</hi> and in the Morning Died in his Bed, without being able to ſpeak ſo much as to his Lady, who was with him, to the general Grief of the whole Iſland, being Univerſally Lamented.</p>
               <p>The Debate was now renewed about Chooſing the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives for the firſt Parliament, the principal Objection was againſt Chooſing them out of the current Parliament—; As to the Allegations of its being againſt Law and Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and againſt the Twenty Second Article of the Treaty juſt then ratified, they all Center'd in this, that it was to be paſſed and approved by Parliament; And that Parliament having yet the whole Legiſlature in their Hands, had power to Repeal any Law, or Statute then in Beeing, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently did ſo far repeal any Clauſe in any Act of Parliament formerly made—; As to its being againſt the Treaty now ratified, that was Rectified thus, That whereas the Act of Ratification of the Treaty of Union in the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in which ſeveral Acts ſince made and to be made in the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> were yet to be inſerted, lay now before the Parliament of <hi>England</hi>—; What ever Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> thought fit to take, for the Nomination of the Members of Parliament, for the firſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> ſhould, and muſt of Courſe alſo be inſerted, and ſo be and become an Eſſential Part or Branch of the Union; And this Vote having paſſed as <hi>per</hi> the Minute, is inſerted in the ſaid Act for ſettling the Election
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0554400100:495"/>
of the Members, and again Recited in the Act of Union, as <hi>per</hi> the Exemplification, appears, in theſe Words; <hi>in that Caſe only, Doth hereby</hi> Statute <hi>and</hi> Ordain, <hi>That the Sixteen Peers and Fourty Five Commiſſioners for Shires and Burghs, who ſhall be Choſen by the Peers, Barons and Burghs reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectively in this preſent Seſſion of Parliament, and out of the Members thereof, in the ſame manner as Committees of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are uſually now Choſen, ſhall be the Members of the reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective Houſes of the ſaid Firſt Parliament of</hi> Great Britain, <hi>for and on the part of</hi> Scotland; <hi>Which Nomination and Election being Certifyed by a Write under the Lord Clerk Regiſters Hand, The Perſons ſo Nominated and Elected ſhall have Right to Sit and Vote in the Houſe of Lords, and in the Houſe of Commons of the ſaid Firſt Parliament of</hi> Great Britain; <hi>As by the ſaid Act paſſed in</hi> Scotland, for ſettling the Manner of Electing the Sixteen Peers and Fourty Five Members to Repreſent <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in the Parliament of <hi>Great Britain</hi> may appear; <hi>Be it therefore further</hi> Enacted <hi>and</hi> Declared <hi>by the Authority afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, That the ſaid laſt mentioned Act paſſed in</hi> Scotland, for ſettling the Manner of Electing the Sixteen Peers and Fourty Five Members to Repreſent <hi>Scotland</hi> in the Parliament of <hi>GREAT BRITAIN,</hi> as aforeſaid, <hi>ſhall be, and the ſame is hereby Declared to be as valid, as if the ſame had been part of, and Ingroſſed in the ſaid Articles of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, Ratified and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the ſaid Act of Parliament of</hi> Scotland, <hi>and by this Act as aforeſaid,</hi> and carried it for the New Model; The Two Proteſtations againſt it made a great Noiſe, and were print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and carryed all over the Kingdom, beſides their being printed in the Minutes of Parliament. Some ſaid, the chief Reaſon why they inſiſted on this ſo much was, That the Party who oppoſed the Union foreſaw, that, as they had been outvoted and overpowered, as they called it, in every Queſtion relating to the Union, ſo they would be in this, and that, by Conſequence, few or none of them would be Named to the Firſt <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, which was really true in the Conſequence.</p>

               <p>I put theſe three Minutes together, becauſe they are all on the ſame Subject, <hi>viz.</hi> The Electing the Repreſentatives to the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0554400100:498"/>
Parliament of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> which was now to be formed into an Act by it ſelf.</p>
               <p>There had been ſeveral Schemes of Elections laid down for the Peers, and three Overtures had been preſented to the Houſe—; Some were for Naming the ſeveral Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and Fixing the Repreſentative to be Choſen out of them Excluſively—, and theſe were thoſe who pretended to make Diſtinctions between the Ancient and Modern No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility—; They thought it was reaſonable, ſince the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Noblemen lately made, and eſpecially in the laſt Thirty or Fourty Years, were but burdenſome, as they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, to the Nation, that thoſe Families newly made Noble ſhould relinquiſh this Affair to the Ancient Nobility, as what was Inherent in them, but a new Acceſſion to theſe; and that, ſince <hi>Scotland</hi> was to Retrench her Nobility, as to ſitting in Parliament, it was but juſt they ſhould be preferred, who had the moſt Ancient Title.</p>
               <p>Others were for dividing the Nobility into Four Claſſes, and taking every Year a proportioned Number out of each Claſs.</p>
               <p>Others were for taking by Rotation, and ſo, beginning at the Extremes, take the Families as they Riſe, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at the eldeſt or youngeſt Peers.</p>
               <p>But all theſe Methods were rejected, and that of Election carryed it, whether it were, that each Party thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves able to carry it from the other, or that they thought it their Advantage, that they ſhould carry it, who could make the beſt Intereſt I know not—; But I cannot ſay they took the beſt way for the preſerving the publick Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, ſince the Factions and Party-makings for the Intereſt of Elections, which muſt neceſſarily be the Conſequence of this Method, cannot but keep up a conſtant Feud of Parties and Families in the Nation, which muſt neceſſarily be renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every Three Year, the Parliament being to be new Choſen ſo often—; During which time, the Parties will be at Work, to Cultivate, Encreaſe, and Fortify their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Intereſts, which, <hi>it is to be doubted,</hi> will go a great way to Entailing a Spirit of Diviſion and Party-ſtrife upon the whole Nation—; I wiſh I may be found to have made a wrong Conjecture,—, but I ſhall have Occaſion to ſpeak to this again in the Proceſs of this Story, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, how too much of this was made good in the very firſt Election, <hi>I mean,</hi> for the ſecond <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament. Of which hereafter—.</p>
               <p>After the ſettling of the Affair of the Peers, it was to be Determined how the Fourty Five Members for the Houſe of Commons ſhould be proportioned, and this was prepared for them before hand, and given in in a Scheme or Overture, which occaſioned ſome Diſpute—; The number of the

Shires and Counties and Stewartries that formerly Elected, were <expan>

                  </expan> theſe were now to be reduced by joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Two or Three together, where they were ſmall and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, to Thirty Members, each County chooſing none but One—, and each Head of Counties, where any were joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, chooſing but One—, the Burghs or Royal Burrows were <expan>

                  </expan> in Number, theſe were Formed into Claſſes or Diſtricts—, and were for each Diſtrict to chooſe one Member; And becauſe the meeting together of the Votes in the ſaid Burghs, might be both Chargeable and Inconvenient, a <hi>Medium</hi> was found out, each Burgh was to chooſe a Commiſſioner, in the ſame manner as uſual, which Commiſſioner was to meet with the Commiſſioners of the other Burghs of that Diſtrict, and theſe were to chooſe the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
               <p>The reſpective Perſons concerned, made ſome Oppoſition about the Joyning of Shires—, but this had been a Thing well Concerted, and therefore admitted the leſs Diſpute in the Houſe; the Perſons alſo who had made the Calculations, being prepared to Defend the Equalities of it—; It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained therefore to agree on the Partition of the Counties and Towns, or as called in the Minutes, Barons and Burghs, which was done with little Diſpute, as <hi>per</hi> the Minute.</p>
               <p>The Motion againſt the Eldeſt Sons of Peers, had not a little to be ſaid for it, particularly that when the Influence of the Nobility in <hi>Scotland</hi> comes to be conſidered, with the ſmall Number of Members to be choſen, it might in time to come riſe to what was Hinted before, in the Project of reducing the Lords that did not ſit in the Houſe of Peers, to a Level with the Commons, and make them capable of ſitting in the Houſe of Commons, that then it might come to paſs, that <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould be Repreſented only by her Nobility, and that there ſhould be <hi>Scots</hi> Lords in the Parliament of <hi>Britain;</hi> So here in time it might happen, that the Nobility in the Houſe of Peers, and their Eldeſt Sons in the Houſe of Commons, might make up the whole Repreſentative of <hi>Scotland</hi>—.</p>

               <p>This Propoſal was ill received indeed, and a horrid Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour raiſed at it without Doors; The People who had been hot againſt the Union took hold of it with an Unbridled Railery, Reproaching the Treaters in a moſt Indecent Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, Exclaiming at the very Thing it ſelf; Now the Nation might ſee they ſaid what they had been doing at <hi>London,</hi> and what they had been purſuing ever ſince that they had ſold their Country for a Sum of Money, &amp; they were beginning to ſhare it among them, this referred to the Equivalent out of which this Money was to be paid—; That they Voted for one another, the new Commiſſioners and the old; and that this was taking that Money away to their private Uſes, which they had pretended was to be Imployed in Incouraging the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0554400100:504"/>
Manufactures and Imploying the Poor, Raiſing Stocks for the Woollen Trade and Funds for the Fiſhing; That theſe were the ſpecious Pretences, when the Nation was brought in to accept of the Equivalent, but that now it was done and over, now they were dividing the Spoil—; It would be endleſs to ſet down the ill Nature of the Day, as ſoon as this Propoſal was talked of without Doors, and yet there was really no Reaſon, the Gentlemen who went to <hi>England</hi> upon that Occaſion, who ſet all their private Affairs aſide to ſerve their Country, and attended in <hi>England</hi> ſeveral Months at Expence enough, ſhould do all this at their own Charges, when, at the ſame time, every other Article had its Supply out of the General Fund; And therefore, notwithſtanding the Clamours of the People, and ſeveral Attempts within Doors, firſt to reject it wholly, then to refuſe the payment of it out of the Equivalent, which was indeed refuſing it wholly, ſince there was no other Fund to pay it—; And laſtly, to Reſtrict the Quantity, yet at laſt it paſt, as it had been at firſt propoſed.</p>
               <p>The Allowance to the Old Treaters, they alledged, was a Trick to draw in the Allowance for the New, becauſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be Voted together, it was certain, <hi>the Old</hi> would Vote for the <hi>New,</hi> that they might be ſure, <hi>the New</hi> would, in Return, Vote for <hi>the Old</hi>—; But there was certainly the ſame Reaſon, that one ſhould be allowed their Expence as the other, ſince, tho' they could not then bring it to a Concluſion, yet their Pains and Expences might not be the leſs, but rather the more for that, and thus they were both Vot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be allowed their Charges, as <hi>per</hi> the Minute.</p>

               <p>The Charges being allowed to the Treaters, it was thought the Houſe would go on and allow this alſo, but it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently rejected—; Some ſaid it was offered by way of Jeſt, as a Reproach to the Gentlemen that took Money for the Service of their Country.</p>
               <p>But the Propoſal was made another way, <hi>viz. That no Repreſentative, from either Shire or Burgh, from this Kingdom to the Parliament of</hi> Great Britain, <hi>ſhall have any Allowance for their Charges or Expences, &amp;c.</hi> It was alledged, That the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> took no ſuch Allowance; and that it would be a Reproach
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0554400100:506"/>
to <hi>Scotland,</hi> if the <hi>Scots</hi> Gentry ſhould take their Charges from the Country, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> did not.</p>
               <p>To this it was Anſwered, That, tho' the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men generally refuſed the Allowance of the Countries for their Attendance, yet that, by Law, there was ſuch an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance due to them from the Countries, and they might not only juſtify accepting it, but might legally demand it; And therefore it ought, in like manner, be left at Liberty in <hi>Scotland,</hi> when doubtleſs the <hi>Scots</hi> Repreſentatives, in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to their Capacities, would be found as Frank and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous in ſparing the Country as the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it was remarkable, That in ſubſequent Elections in <hi>Scotland</hi> for the Counties, it was very often agreed joyntly by the ſeveral Candidates for Election, That whoſoever carried it, ſhould relinquiſh any pretence to an Allowance from the County, for their Service in Parliament.</p>
               <p>The Affair of Proxies in Election of Peers, is expreſt at large in the Minute, and needs no Remark; nor was there any long Debate upon it in the Houſe.</p>
               <p>The other Heads alſo being Matter of Form, only were readily agreed to.</p>
               <p>There was indeed ſome Struggle about Excluding theſe Noblemen of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who were Noblemen in <hi>England,</hi> or ſhould be Peers of <hi>Britain,</hi> from Voting, but they could not carry it—; And yet 'tis to be obſerved, that at the firſt Election of the Sixteen Peers by virtue of this Act, ſome of the Peers of <hi>Scotland</hi> proteſted againſt the Votes of thoſe that had <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Britiſh</hi> Titles, a Debate that is not yet (<hi>viz.</hi> at the Writing theſe Sheets) Determined, tho' this Vote ſeems to conclude it directly.</p>

               <p>This was a great Loſs to the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> upon ſeveral Accounts, and had it remained Unſettled at this Juncture, the Injury had been paſt Remedy; Wherefore it was earneſtly Deſir'd, and readily Granted, That all the Powers formerly Exerciſed by the ſaid Commiſſion of Parliament, ſhould now be Conveyed to ſome particular Court Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory or Body of Men, that ſhould Judge and Determine in ſuch Caſes; ſome were for having it Veſted in the Church it ſelf, and committed to the General Aſſembly—; But it was alledged, That were to make the Church Judge in Her own Cauſe, and put too much Power into the Hands of the Aſſembly; Others were for Deſiring it to be in the Hands of the Crown, to Grant Commiſſion to proper Perſons, as the Parliament did before—; But that was Objected againſt, as dangerous to the Safety and Conſtitution of the Church; at length it was Devolved on the Lords of the Seſſion, and there it paſt, as in the Act Printed alſo at large in the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix N<hi rend="sup">o.</hi>

               <p>The Church Act about Kirks and Teinds was now ſettled, the Motion of having theſe things ſtill referred to a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Commiſſion was thought to proceed from theſe, who were willing it ſhould remain in the ſame Condition it had lyen in for a long time, <hi>viz. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſettled and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nprovided for,</hi> ſince it muſt yearly put the Perſons concerned to make Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the Parliament of <hi>Britain,</hi> which was Remote, and very Troubleſome to get ſuch Commiſſion ſettled, or Triennial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at leaſt—; And whereas, while it lay before their own Parliament, it had, for ſome Years, been Unſettled; and the Church left, as it were, Unregarded in thoſe Affairs, it might much more be ſuppoſed to be neglected, if referred to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament—; That, at the end of every Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, which, at furtheſt, would be but Three Years, this
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0554400100:514"/>
Matter behoved to be laid before them again, and diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſolicited, in order to have it effectually ſettled—; This therefore was vigorouſly oppoſed, and it was carryed to be referred to the Lords of the Seſſion, as <hi>per</hi> the Act. <hi>Vide</hi> the <hi>Appendix, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>.</hi> K <hi>xx.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Proemiums</hi> and Drawbacks on the Exportation of Corn had been ſettled, as before is obſerved, and are inſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Union, as <hi>per</hi> the Act appears; But, in regard the Union was not to take place till <hi>May,</hi> and the want of thoſe Allowances might put a Stop to the Exportation in the mean time, and particularly, That there was a great <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet and ſeveral <hi>Norway</hi> Ships in the Port of <hi>Leith</hi> at that time, which would, in caſe of the Encouragements now to be given, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry away a great Quantity of Corn, before the Firſt of <hi>May,</hi> which Exportation of Corn would be a great Advantage to the Counny, therefore this ſhort lived Act was propoſed for the Encouragement of Trade: But it was alledged, That the Term of the Commencement of the Union was ſo near, that no Convoy would ſtir, or Ships ſail, before that time would be come, and the Advantages would be the ſame to the Merchant; Upon which, the Bill was dropp'd in the Houſe, and came to nothing.</p>
               <p>The Debate about the Chirurgeons and Apothecaries, never came to any Head, the Deſign was to Authorize the Apothecaries and Chirurgeones, to Adminiſter Phyſick with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Aſſiſtance or Preſcription of the Phyſicians, in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary caſes—; It would have been perhaps a a conteſted Thing, if the Houſe had been of longer Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, but the End of the Parliament being ſo near, there was no Time for it.</p>
               <p>The Act about Kirk-lands, and Diſcharging the Feu-duties, was a neceſſary Law at that Time, in ſome ſpecial Cauſes, and met with no Oppoſition.</p>
               <p>The Houſe ſat on <hi>Thurſday</hi> the Twentieth of <hi>February,</hi> but was wholly Imployed about private Buſineſs, which I have all along Omitted, as not to the purpoſe; on the Twenty Firſt they did little, but read the Bill about Prohibiting Muſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and paſt it with the Church Act.</p>

               <p>The Committee had now ſettled the Sum, which in the Groſs was to be paid to the Proprietors of the <hi>African</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; the Queſtion that remained, was, by what Method it ſhould be Diſtributed, and to whom it ſhould be paid—; Two Motions were made about it.<list>
                     <item>1. That it ſhould be paid out by the Commiſſioners who were to be appointed for the general Diſtribution of the Equivalent, and by them immediately paid to the Perſons, who had a Right to the payment by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</item>
                     <item>2. Some thought this was Diſhonourable to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors of the Company, and they moved, that they ſhould appoint Perſons to Receive and Diſtribute the Money, but this laſt met with very little Approbation.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>I care not to take notice of ſome Diſputes that happened upon this Occaſion, becauſe they ſeemed to make Perſonal Reflections—; and only ſignified, that ſome People were more Jealous of one another, than I hope there was occaſion for on either Side—; But it was evident, the People who were to receive the Money, were Generally moſt Concerned to have it paid them by the Commiſſioners of the Equivalent immediately, as being the ſureſt Method, and ſo it was at laſt agreed.</p>
               <p>The Money being thus Directed, and who ſhould have the payment, it is not Material to take notice of the ſeveral Claims put in, Debts demanded of the Company, and Services to be rewarded, they were all matter of private Intereſt, and I omit them of courſe.</p>
               <p>The Affair of the Coyn, and the Report of the Committee, I have Noted already, and as it iſſued in a Proclamation, and that Proclamation recited the Report of the Committee, I have inſerted the whole in the <hi>Appendix N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>

               <head>APPENDIX, Part I. Containing an Account of Tranſactions in both Parts of the United Kingdoms, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent to the <hi>UNION;</hi> being an Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſeveral Alterations made in the Laws, Trade, Cuſtoms, and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of both Kingdoms by the <hi>Union.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe Union was no ſonner Concluded, and the Ratifications Exchanged, as has been ſaid, but an unlucky Buſineſs hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, that opened afreſh the Mouths of thoſe that had all along watched Occaſions for that purpoſe, and furniſhed them with matter of new Clamour. The particulars are as follows;</p>
               <p>The Time when the Union was to take place, was the firſt of <hi>May,</hi> after which, by the Fourth Article of the Treaty, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of either Kingdom were to have a free Intercourſe of Trade, to enjoy equal Privileges, and were to be upon an equal Foot as to Taxes, Cuſtoms, Duties, Prohibitions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as by Words of the Treaty, <hi>viz.</hi> Article 4<hi>th.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>That all the Subjects of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Kingdom of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> ſhall, from and after the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, have full Freedom and Intercourſe of Trade and Navigation, to and from any Port or Place within the ſaid <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Kingdom, and the Dominions and Plantations thereunto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing; And that there be a Communication of all other Rights, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges and Advantages, which do, or may belong to the Subjects of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kingdom, except where it is otherways expreſly agreed in theſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.</q>
               <p>But in the Interval of Time, between the finiſhing of the Treaty and the firſt of <hi>May,</hi> all Things by Conſequence remained as they were, and all Merchandizes being Imported into <hi>Scotland</hi> upon the Foot of the former Cuſtoms, which were much Lower than in <hi>England,</hi> the Merchants in both Kingdoms laying hold of that Advantage, for their private Gain, Fraughted abundance of Ships in <hi>France</hi> and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0554400100:563"/>
                  <hi>Holland</hi> with all ſorts of Goods, which payed high Duties in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> Landing them in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and paying only the <hi>Scots</hi> Dues, preſuming that after the firſt of <hi>May,</hi> they ſhould be ſent Free to <hi>England,</hi> according to the general Article of Freedom of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce.</p>
               <p>To let the Reader more Exactly into this Caſe, I ſhall ſtate the difference of the Duties of ſome of the ſeveral Commodities, which being thus Imported into <hi>Scotland,</hi> were after to be carried into <hi>England;</hi> ſuch as, Wines, Brandies, Salt, Lintſeed, Iron, Timber, Deals, <hi>&amp;c</hi> being the chief kinds of Goods Imported in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and which the Duties were moſt Complained of.</p>
               <p>Beſides this, it is to be obſerved, That the Cuſtoms of <hi>Scotland</hi> being Let in Tack, <hi>as they call it</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> or in Farm, <hi>as in England,</hi> the Tackſmen or Farmers, to Encourage the Merchants to make large Importations, made ſeveral Compoſitions and Abatements to them leſs or more, according as the Quantity of the Goods Imported, Encouraged, by this means the Cuſtoms were ſtill reduced, and yet the Farmers of the Cuſtoms made great Gain of that Interval of Trade.</p>
               <p>Another Article of the Contrivance of the Merchants on this Head, was in <hi>England,</hi> upon the Drawbacks on Foreign Goods Imported there, and Exported again by Certificate.</p>
               <p>And this indeed was leſs Honeſt by far than the other, tho' both of them Politick enough; and, which was thought, had ſlipt the Notice of the Treaters on both ſides, during the Negotiating the Treaty.</p>
               <p>The Exporters in this Caſe, ſent Goods from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by Certificate, drawing back the Duties paid on their Import in <hi>England,</hi> as being ſent to a Foreign Country: After the Union the Kingdoms becoming One, it was by the Treaty left open for them, to carry the ſame Goods back into <hi>England,</hi> and Sell them there, as if they had paid the Duty.</p>
               <p>The principal Article this Circumſtance relates to, was Tobacco, which paying a large Duty of near Six Pence <hi>per</hi> Pound in <hi>England,</hi> above Six Thouſand Hogſheads as I have been told, <hi>(Some have ſaid much more, even to double the Quantity, but I chooſe to relate the loweſt Number,)</hi> was ſent into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and 5 <hi>per</hi> Pound of the ſaid Cuſtom drawn back by the Merchant.</p>
               <p>I need not acquaint the Reader, That the Exporter was both bound in a Bond with Securities, and alſo Sworn againſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landing or returning it into <hi>England</hi> again; But as the Union gave a free Intercourſe of Trade, <hi>i. e.</hi> Exporting and Importing to and from the reſpective Kingdoms, without paying any Duties, or any Moleſtation whatſoever, ſo their Bonds ſeem'd to be of no Value in that Caſe; But whether the Oath was of no Value to them, is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Affair, and not for me to Determine here.</p>
               <p>It is evident, the Tobacco was ſent to <hi>Scotland</hi> in Quantities, ſo much above the uſual Conſumption of that Country, that it
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0554400100:564"/>
could rationally be eſteemed to be with no other Proſpect, than of Returning it into <hi>England</hi> again after the Union, and ſo to obtain the Advantage of the Drawback.</p>
               <p>In like manner it is evident, the great Import into <hi>Scotland</hi> of Wines and Brandy from <hi>France,</hi> either directly, or by way of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> was ſo much beyond the ordinary Conſumption of the Place, that it could be with no other End, than the carrying it into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> after the Union ſhould take place, nor did the Merchants ſtick to owne that to be in the Deſign.</p>
               <p>The Merchants in <hi>London,</hi> eſpecially ſuch as were concerned in the Trade to <hi>Spain, Italy</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> and conſequently had the greateſt Injury, made loud Complaints of this, as an Intolerable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality, and a Thing ſo Unjuſt that they made no doubt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Government in it, and the Parliament being then ſitting, they Addreſſed the Houſe of Commons for Relief.</p>
               <p>Their Addreſs was followed with Numerous Solicitations, they even wearied the Members, the Secretaries of State, and every Body, that they thought would Eſpouſe their Cauſe; that as ſome have Expreſſed it, They almoſt drove the Houſe by the Force of their Clamours, upon a Debate of a Thing, which moſt People thought they had really no Power, <hi>at leaſt no Reaſon,</hi> to meddle with.</p>
               <p>The Parliament then ſitting was the ſame, which had in Concert with the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> made this Union; And it could not ſeem Reaſonable, That the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> in its ſeparate Capacity, could be Qualified to Explain any part of the Articles, which were then Ratified and Recorded in both Kingdoms, and neither Parliament could Determine in Things belonging to the other, any more than they could have done before the Treaty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>However this was,</hi> the Houſe of Commons went upon it, great Application being made by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants, and after ſome Debate, came to this Reſolution.<q>
                     <hi>Reſolved,</hi>
                     <p>That the Importation of Goods and Merchandizes of the Growth and Produce of <hi>France,</hi> and other Forreign Parts into <hi>Scotland,</hi> in order to be brought from thence into <hi>England</hi> after the firſt of <hi>May,</hi> and with Intention to avoid the payment of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Duties, will be to the Damnage &amp; Ruine of the Fair Traders, to the Prejudice of the Manufactures of <hi>England,</hi> a great Loſs to Her Majeſties Revenue of the Customs, and a very great Detriment to the Publick.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And in purſuance of this Reſolution, a Bill was ordered to be brought in, the Enacting part of which I have Annexed to this Work, in the <hi>Appendsx N<hi rend="sup">o.</hi>
                  </hi> C (3). The Title of it was as follows.<q>A Bill to prevent the Miſchiefs of a Fraudulent Practice, in obtaining Drawbacks for Goods carried from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Scotland,</hi>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0554400100:565"/>
in order to be brought back again; and in carrying Goods from For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign Parts into <hi>Scotland,</hi> in order to be brought into <hi>England,</hi> without paying the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Duties, and for better ſecuring the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Goods brought from the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> was (according to order) read a ſecond time, and committed to a Committee of the whole Houſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This Bill paſt all the uſual Forms in the Houſe of Commons, and went up to the Lords, but after long Debate in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper-Houſe, the Lords rejected it.</p>
               <p>It's true, that upon the Petitions and Repreſentations of the <hi>Scots</hi> Merchants, there were long Debates, and great Difficulties in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this Bill in the Houſe of Commons, and the <hi>Scots</hi> demanding <hi>by the Letter of the Treaty</hi> a free Intercourſe of Trade, alledged they could not be refuſed the importing of any Goods out of <hi>Scotland</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> which were not by Law Counterband in <hi>Scotland</hi> before the ſaid Treaty, ſince having been fairly admitted to an Entry in the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom-houſe of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and all the Duties which were demanded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paid, the free Intercourſe of Trade between the Nations immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately opened all the Ports of <hi>England</hi> to their Goods.</p>
               <p>This Argument was too Powerful and too Plain not to have its Weight in the Houſe: <hi>But to ſolve this,</hi> there was an Exception put in to the Bill for the Property of <hi>Scots</hi> Merchants, as a thing which would effectually remove their Scruples, and anſwer the End both of the Union one way, and of the <hi>Portugal</hi> Merchants another; For the Complaint ſeemed to ly not ſo much againſt the Freedom of <hi>Scots</hi> Merchants importing their own Goods, but of Forreigners, <hi>Dutch, French, Jews</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who under the cover of <hi>Scots</hi> Men had crouded in vaſt Quantities of Wine and Brandy, meerly to evade paying the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Dutie, taking the Advantage of the Interval of Time, and thereby bringing their Goods to Market upon Terms vaſtly diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from the courſe of Trade.</p>
               <p>To prevent this, the Act was to provide, that all the Properties of the <hi>Scots</hi> Merchants ſhould be exempted, and be allowed to come to <hi>England,</hi> but this was reſtricted in point of Proof. (1.) The <hi>onus Probandi</hi> lay upon the Merchant, in which many Niceties occurred needleſs to be mentioned here. (2.) None were to be reputed <hi>Scots</hi> Merchants but ſuch as reſided in <hi>Scotland,</hi> this excluded the <hi>Scots</hi> Merchants at <hi>London</hi> and in <hi>Holland,</hi> who were deeply Embarke in theſe Importations, and on whoſe Management the chief part of the Deſign was charged. (3.) The Proof of the Importations and Properties lay before the Commiſſioners of the Cuſtoms, and it was doubtful how it ſhould be determin'd.</p>
               <p>Under all theſe Difficulties, with other Reſtrictions needleſs here, this firſt Act ſtruggl'd and paſt the Commons, and yet it was thought alſo, that had the <hi>Scots</hi> been fairly excepted they would have been well enough pleaſed with ſuch a Difference, and they would have had ſome reaſon to have been ſo; Nor was the Exception of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners altogether unreaſonable, the thing being really a Fraud in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0554400100:566"/>
Trade, and a Hardſhip upon the fair Traders: But the main Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection turn'd upon another Point, <hi>viz. The Power the Parliament of</hi> England <hi>alone could have to Determine, Construe, or Explain any one of the Articles of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, which being made by the Concurrence of the two reſpective Kingdoms, could not be ſubject to the Cogniſance of either Parliament in its ſeparate Capacitie,</hi> and upon this Head the Lords rejected the Bill. And this being the main thing in my Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, on which the whole Caſe depended, I have purpoſly omitted the Reaſonings on that Article on either ſide, which were very many, referring my Reader to the Subſtance of the Addreſs of the <hi>Scots</hi> Merchants to the Houſe of Lords, and to an Obſervation made by an eminent Member of the Parliament, which I have added in the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix,</hi> in order to leave this Caſe as clear to Poſterity as is poſſible, marked N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> (<hi>D</hi>3.) and N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> (<hi>E</hi>3.)</p>
               <p>However it was abſolutely neceſſary if poſſible to bring this Affair to ſome Concluſion, and in order to this the Parliament at that time draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near an end, for they could ſit no longer than the laſt of <hi>April,</hi> the Union commencing the 1<hi>ſt.</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> wherefore it was thought expedient to give the Houſe a ſhort Receſs, that this matter might come again upon the Stage, whereupon the Queen prorogued the Parliament for three days only, and in a ſhort Speech made them acquainted with the Reaſon of it, <hi>viz.</hi> In order to find out an Expedient to prevent any Miſchiefs ariſing to either Kingdom in the ſhort Interval of time between that and the Commencement of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion.</p>
               <p>When the Houſe met again, the Commons began again and voted to the ſame purpoſe as before, and ordered a Bill to be brought in in the ſame terms as before.</p>
               <p>The Vote of the Houſe of Commons ran thus;<q>That the Importation of ſundry Goods of the Growth of <hi>France</hi> thro' <hi>Scotland</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> with deſign to avoid paying the Duties payable for the ſame in <hi>England,</hi> is a notorious Fraud, ruinous to the fair Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and injurious to Her Majesties Revenue.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this Vote the Merchants at <hi>London</hi> renewed their Clamours, and all Methods poſſible were made uſe of to bring the Parliament in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; The Government would willingly have foundout ſome Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to have ſoftned the general Complaint, and to have prevented the Injury to the Revenue, but all <hi>Mediums</hi> were found imperfect, and the Houſe of Lords perſiſting in the firſt Scruple, it fell to the Ground.</p>
               <p>While this was tranſacting, the Merchants went on with their Importation, and tho' the Quantity did not amount to what had been alledged <hi>would be brought in,</hi> yet it was a very great Quantity indeed, and the Damage to the Revenue in <hi>England,</hi> appears by the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Calculation.</p>
               <p>There were not ſome wanting in either Kingdom, who expected to make early Objections againſt this proceeding, as a Breach of the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0554400100:567"/>
Union on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſide, and had the Act paſt, tho' with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Precautions, diſcovered that they would have improved that Suggeſtion to the utmoſt, and yet it was obſervable that none were ſo forward to approve of the Act of Reſtriction as ſome Gentlemen who declared their Averſion to the Union, and their willingneſs to have it diſſolved again.</p>
               <p>Whatever Loſs therefore the Government received by this Affair, they avoided the Stroke it would have given to the Union and the Enemies of the Treaty loſt the Opportunity of ſaying it was broken.</p>
               <p>The firſt of <hi>May</hi> being arriv'd, the <hi>Scots</hi> Merchants began to apply themſelves to the Government for the Settlement of this Matter, and the Importation of their Goods to <hi>England;</hi> This held a long De bate, and took up a great deal of time, however the <hi>Scots</hi> ſhipped their Goods, took Certificats in <hi>Scotland</hi> of their being fairly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported there before the firſt of <hi>May,</hi> and tho' after many Heſitations and Delays, about the middle of <hi>June</hi> the Fleet ſailed for <hi>London,</hi> conſiſting of about 40 Sail moſtly loaded with Wine and Brandy:</p>
               <p>As ſoon as they arrived in the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> the Cuſtom-houſe Officers made a general Seizure both of Ship and Goods; and all was put to a full ſtop.</p>
               <p>This perplex'd the Merchands very much, and loud Clamours were made of it in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as a Breach of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion; The Royal Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs in <hi>Scotland</hi> held their Convention upon this Affair, and the Merchants concerned in the ſaid Ships preſented a Petition to them, which becauſe it relates the Complaint in expreſs terms, and for the Information of thoſe People in <hi>England,</hi> who do not particularly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Methods there, I inſert at large in the <hi>Appendix.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be obſerved that the Royal Burghs in <hi>Scotland</hi> have their Meetings on emergent Occaſions, for the Regulation of Trade, and ſettling their own Affairs, beſides their Annual Meeting.</p>
               <p>The Merchants of <hi>Scotland</hi> generally ſpeaking are all Free-men of ſome one or other of theſe Burghs, and there hapning to be a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention or Meeting as above at that time, the Merchants preſented to them their Petition, intreating them to repreſent their Caſe to the Queen, ſetting furth their Grievances, this Petition you will find in the <hi>Appendix</hi> N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
                  <hi>A.</hi> (3.)</p>
               <p>Purſuant to this Petition, the Convention of Burroughs repreſented their caſe very earneſtly to the Government, by the means of the <hi>Scots</hi> Secretarys of State then at <hi>London</hi>—their Addreſs I have alſo placed in the <hi>Appendix</hi> to this Work N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
                  <hi>B</hi> (3)</p>
               <p>And thus the Caſe was wholly referred to the Queen and Council.</p>
               <p>It was thought hard indeed that the Ships ſhould not be ſuffered to unlade, the Seaſon being Hot, and the Wines expoſed to ſpoil; But there was no immediate Remedy, the Cuſtom-houſe Officers could not poſſibly do otherwiſe, <hi>for this Reaſon:</hi> Had the Debate been, what Duty they ſhould pay, they might have ſuffered them to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lade into the Queens Ware-houſes, and have detained them there till ſuch Duty had been paid; But the Trade of <hi>France</hi> being univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0554400100:568"/>
Prohibit by Act of Parliament, they could not be admitted to an Entry, but were all Forfeited, both Ships and Goods.</p>
               <p>The Government willing, if poſſible, to give the neceſſary Relief in this Exigence, the Attorney General, and all other Judges, whoſe Advice was neceſſary, were required to give their Opinion, but they differ'd in their Judgments ſo much, that no Reſolution could be made in it.</p>
               <p>However, that the Merchants might be made Eaſie, it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to them, That they ſhould Land their Goods, upon Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they gave Security to ſtand to the Judgment of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> Parliament; This was thought but reaſonable, and ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed with it, and had their Ships Unloaden: Others refuſed ſuch Securities, and their Goods lay longer, and ſuffered more.</p>
               <p>At length a <hi>Medium</hi> was found out, which was, to let all the Merchants have the poſſeſſion of their Goods, ſerving the Poſſeſſors of the Goods with a Writ of <hi>Devenirunt</hi> out of the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer—; This is a kind of Write which puts the Matter in a Form of Proſecution only, that in caſe of further occaſion, the Queen might recover her Dues, and ſo the Merchants had their Goods, and the Deciſion of it was left to Time, and to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament.</p>
               <p>Thus it continued in a Courſe of Law, tho' not under proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, till the Meeting of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, when by a Vote of the Houſe of Commons, the whole Affair was Diſcharged, and all proſecutions ordered to be ſtopt, of which hereafter. Mean time the Clauſe in Parliament ſo much ſtruggled about, you will find in the <hi>Appendix</hi> to this Work, <hi>N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>
                  </hi> C (3)</p>
               <p>Thus ended this difficult Matter, in which is to be Noted the Exactneſs of the Houſe of Lords, and Tenderneſs in reſpect to the Union, which delivered us from the Apprehenſions of an Invaſion upon the Articles; and notwithſtanding the Damage done to the Revenue, which was finally ſacrificed to the Eaſe of the Peoples Minds, the whole Claim was let fall.</p>
               <p>It may be thought it had this Uſe, however, that the Difficulty which appeared in it, Checkt the Quantity of the Goods that would otherways have been brought in, which would have been Intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and ſome thought this was part of the Deſign in it.</p>
               <p>while this was Tranſacting, the Government began to take the State of the Nation into their Conſideration, in order to ſettle Things conform to the reſpective Conſtitutions, and yet to put the Union as far in Practice as the General Circumſtances would admit; And this took up the moſt part of the Time between the firſt of <hi>May, when the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion took place,</hi> and the Sitting down of the firſt <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, nor was the Thing without its Difficulties, as will appear in the ſeveral Articles following.<list>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0554400100:569"/>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Previous to theſe Particulars, it is requiſite to obſerve, That the Adminiſtration of publick. Affairs was left to remain as before, in the Miniſtry of a Privy Council, a Treaſury, a Chancellor, and Two Secretaries of State, with all other Dependents and Subſtitutes as before.</p>
               <p>This the Queen thought fit to Order, not only, becauſe the Weight of Buſineſs was too great, and the particulars too Nice, and of too much Conſequence to ſuffer a ſudden Change, which would have made large Intervals in the Courſe of Adminiſtration, put a ſtop to the publick Buſineſs, and Influence private Perſons Affairs alſo. But as the Queen has always thought it beſt, in ſuch Caſes, to take Advice of Her Great Council the Parliament, a Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs we have often Complained for want of in former Reigns; So it was referred to the Sitting of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, that it might be ſettled, to the Satisfaction of the Nation, by the Advice of their full Repreſentative.</p>
               <p>Thus the Civil Liſt remained as it was, the Army was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon the old Eſtabliſhment, and paid from the Ceſs granted by the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as far as it Extended, the Defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency was left to the Parliament of <hi>Britain</hi> to ſupply, as appears by the Act of Parliament granting the Ceſs.</p>
               <p>On the firſt of <hi>May One Thouſand Seven Hundred and Eight,</hi> the Army received their pay from <hi>London,</hi> the Regiment of Foot Guards was received as <hi>Engliſh</hi> Guards, and the Command of them given to the Marquiſs of <hi>Lothian</hi> as Colonel; The Guards were Clothed after the <hi>Engliſh</hi> manner, I mean, as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Guards, and the whole Eſtabliſhment of the Forces received their Regulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Pay from the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Government.</p>
               <p>But two Things required an immediate Application, <hi>viz.</hi> The Cuſtoms and Exciſe, for theſe being to be Eſtabliſhed upon a new Foot, <hi>viz.</hi> According to the Articles, and to Commence preciſely on the firſt of <hi>May,</hi> it was abſolutely neceſſary that they ſhould be firſt ſettled.</p>
               <p>The ſame Reaſons made it abſolutely neceſſary to bring down ſome <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> to ſupply Inferiour Offices, both in the Cuſtoms and Exciſe, at leaſt, till proper Perſons might be found, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed to Act without them.</p>
               <p>It was thought at firſt, That as <hi>Scotland</hi> being United to <hi>England,</hi> the whole United Kingdom coming under one Denomination, and under one Method of Government, ſo the Revenues ſhould become
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0554400100:570"/>
united in one general Collection, that the Cuſtoms ſhould be manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Commiſſioners at <hi>London,</hi> and under them only by Collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and other Officers in the reſpective Ports in <hi>Scotland</hi> as it is in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> all ſubſervient to, and under the Government of the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners at <hi>London,</hi> and the like in the Exciſe.</p>
               <p>But the Buſineſs appeared too weighty and embarraſt with too many Difficulties to admit of ſuch a Conjunction, and indeed were I to enter into an Hiſtorical Account of the Labyrinths which the firſt Settlement of theſe Duties led the Managers of them into, what Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties they met with, what Clamours were raiſed at their Conduct, however impartially they endeavoured to act, it would look as if I were going to Write of perſons inſtead of relating things, and that is none of my buſineſs here.</p>
               <p>It will be enough here to touch the matters of Fact, by which it will appear, both that the Government proceeded in the beſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, in puting the Cuſtoms and Exciſe into a diſtinct Management in <hi>Scotland;</hi> And alſo, that the Commiſſioners of both ſhewed they wanted neither Judgment or Application in a Settlement ſo ſpeedy under ſuch perplext Circumſtances as they found theſe Revenues in at firſt.</p>

               <p>The whole Extent of the Kingdom lay before them and they had not only new Officers to place in the reſpective Ports, but they had all their old Officers to inſtruct in the new Methods, Cuſtoms and Manner of ſecuring and accounting the reſpective Duties.</p>
               <p>This obliged the Government, even before Commiſſioners were named, and before the time for the new Collection began, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect five perſons from <hi>England,</hi> experienced in the Methods and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>

brought them to a little of a Form, and prepared them the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the Regulations which were to follow.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The firſt Clamour I meet with againſt theſe proceedings, was, the filling all the Commiſſions up with <hi>Engliſh Men</hi> and Strangers, and I mention it, not that it was a real Ground of Complaint, their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber being not one fifth Part of the whole, as appears by their Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment; But to remark how readily every thing was laid hold upon to reproach the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, as being either originally deſigned for, or conſequentially improved to the particular Advantage of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſeparately conſidered.</p>
               <p>Now altho' the ſmall Number of <hi>Engliſh</hi> imployed in the Cuſtoms, were a ſufficient Anſwer to the Objections, and a full Juſtification of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government in that Caſe; yet it is a more clear Defence when it is conſidered that it was impoſſible to introduce the new Method of collection, the Rules of their keeping their ſeveral Offices, and their Accompts, which were all now to be done after the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manner, without the Aſſiſtance of Officers from <hi>England,</hi> who had been bred up to the ſame Buſineſs, and were abſolutely Maſters of the Methods practiſed in <hi>England:</hi> of which by it ſelf.</p>
               <p>But to return to the Queſtion, I mean the neceſſity of a ſeparate Collection of the Cuſtoms and Exciſe in <hi>Scotland,</hi> it will further appear in reflecting on the Proceedings of the Officers in the proſecution of their new Methods.</p>
               <p>For Firſt, the People finding the Duties on <hi>French</hi> Goods ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagantly high, that the ſtealing the Cuſtoms was more worth their while than uſual, ſell upon that Practice with ſo much eagerneſs, that it was not in the power of the Cuſtom-houſe Officers at firſt to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it; At, ſeveral places they practiſed it ſo openly, and with ſuch aſſurance, that when the Officers had made their Seizures they were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from them by the Rabbles, and the Goods attempted to be taken from them by force, &amp; a Fleet arriving from <hi>Holland</hi> about the Months of <hi>August</hi> or <hi>September</hi> after the Union, it was thought that ſeveral thouſand ſmall Casks of Brandy were conveyed ſecretly on Shore, which it was impoſſible to prevent: But of this I ſhall be more particular by and by.</p>
               <p>It was time therefore to take new Methods, and the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0554400100:572"/>
Applying themſelves to the Government in this Matter, Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were appointed to Defend the Collectors, as occaſion ſhould offer, and the Perſons who had Reſiſted, as above, were Seized, and ordered to be proſecuted; I might give a long Hiſtory here, of the Frauds and Violences put upon the Government, in the matters of the Cuſtoms, by which whole Ships Loadings of Goods were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to be put on Shore, without paying the Cuſtom; But this is enough to make it plain, what Occaſion there was of a ſtrict and exact Management in this Affair, and conſequently of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>The Buſineſs of the Cuſtoms alſo in <hi>Scotland,</hi> had been under a Management quite different from that in <hi>England;</hi> the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſound the Trade ſmall, the Officers few, and Diſcouraged, their Salaries ſmall, and the Extent of the Ports vaſtly large; So that of that ſmall Buſineſs there was in the Nation, much of it was carried on by the Clandeſtine Management of the Merchant, and tho' the Farmers or Tackſmen did their utmoſt, with the Officers they had, yet it was impoſſible to prevent the Running great Quantities of Goods.</p>
               <p>If this was a General Practice before, much more was it ſo now, when the Sweetneſs of it was Taſted by the Merchants after the Union, when the Duty of Wine and Brandy, was about Five times to Eight times as much as it was before. This added to the Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies the Cuſtom-Houſe at firſt laboured under, made it impoſſible to put a ſtop to the Irregular Practice of the Merchants, the Firths of <hi>Forth</hi> and <hi>Clyde,</hi> are known to be very large, and the whole Kingdom full of Creiks, Coves, Harbours and Bays, that unleſs a little Army of Officers had been maintained, it was not poſſible they could eaſily check the running Goods on Shore, where there was ſo great a Temptation and Opportunity.</p>
               <p>But in order to Rectifie this as much as poſſible, Riding Officers were appointed to Survey the Coaſt, theſe were Uſeful to obſerve the Officers, that they did their Duty, and withal, to Inform the Commiſſioners of what happened, to Regulate the Ports, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the fixing Officers in proper places.</p>
               <p>Theſe conſiſted of Four general Riding Surveyors, who dividing the whole Kingdom in proper Diſtricts, had Twelve Riding Officers under them. Three to each Surveyor, theſe were ſubject to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Inſpection of the firſt Four, and all ſubject to the General Orders of the Commiſſioners themſelves, as they found occaſion; Nor did the Commiſſioners themſelves ſtick, as they found the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice required it, to take a perſonal Inſpection into the Buſineſs of the Cuſtomes at their firſt Planting, frequently making long Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys themſelves, to Viſit the Coaſt, and Rectifie ſuch Abuſes as they found requiſite, which tho' not uſual, they made no Difficulty to do, at the firſt Settlement of this nice Branch of the Revenue.</p>
               <p>Several Cruiſing Veſſels alſo &amp; ſmall Boats were built, <hi>For the Cuſtom-Houſe Officers were intirely without them before,</hi> by which they were
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0554400100:573"/>
able to Viſit and Search Ships as they appeared, at any Time, in the Sea, off of the Ports, or in all the Creiks and Rivers as there was occaſion—; for want of which, it was frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practiſed, for Ships to appear at a diſtance, make Signals for their Confederates, who came off in Boats, and ſo delivered the Goods they deſigned to Run, before they came into Port; Theſe Boats particularly in the Firth of <hi>Forth,</hi> having the whole Firth to Range in, had their appointed Signals alſo on the Shores, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they never failed to have Notice, if the Officers appeared, and could ſhift from Port to Port, or from one ſide of the Firth to the other, till they had a clear Port to Land in; and the Cuſtom-Houſe Officers might have the Satisfaction to ſtand on the Shore, and look on, but having no Veſſel or Boat to go off in, could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Fraud.</p>
               <p>But this was intirely prevented by the Vigilance of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, who placed their Cruiſing Veſſels in proper Stations on the Sea, and their ſeveral ſmaller Boats in the Rivers, Creiks and Ports; and theſe concurred together with the Riding Officers and Surveyors on Shore, who, in their conſtant Circuits, anſwered ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly by Land, what the ſaid Veſſels did on the Sea—; By the Exactneſs of this Method, the Affair of the Cuſtoms preſently came into Form, and Things looked with a new Face in Trade, to the Satisfaction of Fair Traders, and the better Collecting and ſecuring the Duties.</p>
               <p>And for the better Explaining the particular Management of the Cuſtoms in <hi>Scotland</hi> as to this Point, and giving a Proof of what I have Noted as above, I have added a brief Scheme of the ſeveral Stations of the ſaid Cruiſers by Sea, their appointed Buſineſs, and Original Coaſts, together with the Stations of the Riding Officers on Shore, which will be found <hi>Appendix</hi> Part 11. N<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> (R x x, S x x.) and to which the Reader is referred; a Scheme alſo of the Difference of ſeveral Duties before and after the Union, from which the Encouragement for theſe Diſorders were drawn; Theſe you will find <hi>Appendix</hi> Part 11. N<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> (T x x, V x x, X x x.)</p>
               <p>I have been the longer on this, as well to give the true Reaſons, why it was abſolutely neceſſary to place <hi>Engliſh</hi> Officers in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in order to Regulate the Collection, as why it was abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary to have a diſtinct Commiſſion in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and this will always hold to be a Reaſon for ſuch a Method; It being Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable, that all the variety of Caſes which ſhall happen there, ſhould be Determined by the Board at <hi>London,</hi> or left to the Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Deciſion of ſingle Collectors; And this was one Reaſon among others, why the Parliament found it neceſſary, to have a Court of Exchequer Eſtabliſhed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in which all the Seizures, Confiſcations, and Pleas between the Merchant and the Cuſtom-Houſe Officers, ſhould be Determined, ſince it would have been an inſupportable Grievance, both to the Queen as well as to the Subject; to the firſt, to have had ſuch Pleas be Determined in the Ordinary Methods of the Law. And to the ſecond, to have been
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0554400100:574"/>
obliged to Defend themſelves in <hi>England,</hi> whither Witneſſes muſt have been ſent, and the Defendants have been bound to have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared upon every trifling Occaſion; Of which by it ſelf.</p>
               <p>As the Cuſtoms were thus neceſſarily put under a ſeparate Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, ſo was the Exciſe—; that Branch of the Revenue was not without its Difficulties, and as there would be every day Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Difficulties ariſing, which no Government could Foreſee; So it would have been too great a Neglect of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to have put the Determination of that whole Branch of the Revenue, into the Hands of ſingle Collectors.</p>
               <p>Again, the Diſputes in the Exciſe in <hi>England,</hi> being referred wholly to the Juſtices of the Peace, and at the firſt ſettling this Duty, there being no Juſtices of the Peace ſettled in <hi>Scotland,</hi> it would too much have Expoſed the Subject, to have left them to the Arbitrary Deciſion of Inferiour Collectors, and too much have Expoſed the Government to have left the Queen, without a due Power to have ſecured the Revenue.</p>
               <p>But there was yet other Reaſons, which made the Eſtabliſhing ſeparate Commiſſions in <hi>Scotland</hi> for the Revenue, as above, to be abſolutely neceſſary, and this was the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Articles of the Union, which appointed the Laws of <hi>Scotland</hi> to remain in Force as they were—; One Conſequence of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, was, That all the Pleas of the Crown, as well as all Matters of private Right, became Cognoſcable only in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and to be Judged by what was before, or was now to be Deem'd, the Law of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it appeared abſolutely neceſſary, to have Two new Courts Erected in <hi>Scotland,</hi> That is to ſay, New in Method, tho' not in Name, <hi>viz.</hi> a Court of Admiralty, and a Court of Exchequer; The firſt to Determine Maritime Diſputes, the other, ſuch as related to the Receipt of the Revenue, as Seizures, Forfeitures Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Crown Lands, Leaſes, Grants, Patents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and whatever De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the Sovereign had upon the Subjects.</p>
               <p>It was expreſly ſtipulated in the Twenty Fourth Article of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; <hi>That a Seal in</hi> Scotland <hi>after the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion be always kept and made uſe of in all things relating to private Rights or Grants, which have uſually paſſed the Great Seal of</hi> Scotland, <hi>and which only concern Offices, Grants, Commiſſions, and private Rights within that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; And that, until ſuch Seal ſhall be appointed by Her Majeſty, the preſent Great Seal of</hi> Scotland <hi>ſhall be uſed for ſuch Purpoſes; And that the Privy Seal, Signet, Caſſet, Signet of the Juſticiary Court, Quarter-Seal, and Seals of Courts now uſed in</hi> Scotland <hi>be continued.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this Clauſe, all Grants, Patents, Commiſſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily to be paſt in <hi>Scotland</hi>—; By this Clauſe alſo it became ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that there ſhould be a diſtinct Keeper of the Seal, and a diſtinct Keeper of the Signet in <hi>Scotland,</hi> tho' there was but one Lord Chancellor.</p>
               <p>Again, by the Eighteenth Article, it was expreſly ſtipulated; <hi>That the Laws concerning Regulation of Trade, Cuſtoms, and ſuch</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0554400100:575"/>
                  <hi>Exciſes, to which</hi> Scotland <hi>is, by virtue of this Treaty, to be lyable, be the ſame in</hi> Scotland, <hi>from and after the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion as in</hi> England; <hi>And that all other Laws, in uſe within the Kingdom of</hi> Scotland, <hi>do after the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, and notwithſtanding thereof, remain in the ſame Force as before, (except ſuch as are contrary to, or inconſiſtent with the Terms of this Treaty) but alterable by the Parliament of</hi> Great-Britain, <hi>with this Difference betwixt the Laws concerning Publick Right, Policy, and Civil Government, and thoſe which concern private Right; That the Laws which concern publick Right, Policy, and Civil Government, may be made the ſame throughout the whole united Kingdom; But that no Alteration be made in Laws which concern private Rights, except for evident <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tility of the Subjects within</hi> Scotland.</p>
               <p>This drove the Treaters to the abſolute neceſſity of Forming all thoſe Particulars of the Nineteenth Article, which are but the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of the Eighteenth; <hi>That the Court of Seſſion, or Colledge of Justice, do after the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, and notwithſtanding thereof, remain in all time coming within</hi> Scotland <hi>as it is now Conſtituted by the Laws of that Kingdom, and with the ſame Authority and Privileges as before the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſettled the Laws of private Right; Then the Court of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty comes, as a Conſequence of the ſecond Clauſe, as follows; <hi>And that all</hi> Admiralty Juriſdictions <hi>be under the Lord High</hi> Admiral <hi>or</hi> Commiſſioners <hi>for the</hi> Admiralty <hi>of</hi> Great-Britain <hi>for the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; And that the</hi> Court <hi>of</hi> Admiralty <hi>now Establiſhed in</hi> Scotland <hi>be continued, and that all Reviews, Reductions, or Suſpenſions, of the Sentences in Maritime Caſes competent to the Juriſdiction of that</hi> Court, <hi>remain in the ſame manner after the</hi> Union, <hi>as now in</hi> Scotland, <hi>until the</hi> Parliament <hi>of</hi> Great-Britain <hi>ſhall make ſuch Regulations and Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, as ſhall be judged Expedient for the whole <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Kingdom, ſo as there be always continued in</hi> Scotland <hi>a</hi> Court <hi>of</hi> Admiralty, <hi>ſuch as is in</hi> England, <hi>for Determination of all Maritime Caſes relating to private Rights in</hi> Scotland, <hi>competent to the Juriſdiction of the</hi> Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty Court, <hi>ſubject nevertheleſs to ſuch Regulations and Alterations, as ſhall be thought proper to be made by the Parliament of</hi> Great-Britain; <hi>And that the Heretable Rights of Admiralty and Vice-Admiralties in</hi> Scotland <hi>be Reſerved to the Reſpective Proprietors as Rights of Property, ſubject nevertheleſs, as to the manner of Exerciſing ſuch Heretable Rights.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That all Pleas of Right, whether in private Right or Pleas of the Crown, were Cogniſable only in <hi>Scotland,</hi> is proved by the ſame Article, in the following words; <hi>And that no Cauſes in</hi> Scotland <hi>be Cognoſcable by the Courts of</hi> Chancery, Queens-bench, Common-Pleas, <hi>or any other Court in</hi> Weſtminſter-Hall; <hi>and that the ſaid Courts, or any other of the like Nature, after the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, ſhall have no Power to Cognoſce, Review, or Alter the Acts or Sentences of the Judicatures with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</hi> Scotland, <hi>or to ſtop the Execution of the ſame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Exchequer as a further Conſequence follows next, in theſe words; <hi>And that there be a Court of Exchequer in</hi> Scotland <hi>after the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, for Deciding Queſtions concerning the Revenues of Cuſtoms and Exciſes there, having the ſame Power and Authority in ſuch Caſes, as</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0554400100:576"/>
                  <hi>the Court of Exchequer has in</hi> England; <hi>And that the ſaid Court of Exchequer in</hi> Scotland <hi>have Power of paſſing Signatures, Gifts, Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, and in other Things, as the Court of Exchequer at preſent in</hi> Scotland <hi>hath; And that the Court of Exchequer that now is in</hi> Scotland <hi>do remain, until a new Court of Exchequer be ſettled by the Parliament of</hi> Great-Britain <hi>in</hi> Scotland <hi>after the Union.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By theſe particular Eſtabliſhments may be ſeen not only the manner of the publick Management in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but the Reaſon of it, and from whence it became neceſſary to have the Court of Exchequer, the Commiſſions, and the ſeparate Collection of the Publick Revenue ſettled in <hi>Scotland,</hi> all flowing from this main Original ſtated in the Treaty, <hi>viz.</hi> That all Cauſes between the Queen and the Subject are only cogniſable in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>According to this Foundation, the Collections for the Cuſtoms and Exciſes were ſettled in <hi>Scotland</hi> in diſtinct Commiſſions, as has been ſaid, and tho' at firſt the Difficulties in the ſaid Collections ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared great, and ſome uneaſineſs on every ſide began to riſe, yet as they principally lay on the backwardneſs of the Subject to come under a ſtrict Survey as to the Duties, Time wore off theſe Things, and the People became more ſenſible of the Neceſſity of the exact Collection, in order to bring Trade to an Equality.</p>
               <p>At the beginning, the People thought every Seizure of prohibited Goods a Violence upon their Properties, and clamoured at the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion; as if the Union had been made not to bring them under good Government, but to leave them without Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this Notion they fell to running of Brandy in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar at that prodigious Rate, that ſome thouſands of ſmall Casks of Brandy was in ſpight of all the Vigilance of Officers ſecretly ſuppoſed to be put on Shore out of the firſt <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet that came to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> after the Union; and when the Officers made Seizure of ſeveral Parcels, the Rabbles by Violence reſcued them again, as is already noted above.</p>
               <p>But this Practice was eaſily ſuppreſt, for not the Government only, but all the fair Merchants were concerned in it, ſince the running of Goods on Shore, without paying Cuſtom, is a known prejudice to the Merchant, who entring his Goods fairly, and paying large Cuſtoms, is by theſe People under-ſold, and the Market foreſtal'd; Theſe things therefore began to meet with leſs Encouragement, and having no Countenance but from the meer Rabble, the frequent Loſſes they met with, by the activity of the Officers of the Cuſtoms by little and litle, diſcouraged the Adventurers, and Trade began to run in it's proper Channel.</p>
               <p>The Difficulties of the Exciſe were of another kind; Of which by themſelves; And tho' the Rules of the Collecting the Exciſe, &amp; the Methods of charging the Subject were very exact and regular, yet they were not without great Obſtructions in their Work, as has been noted. The firſt by reaſon of a Miſunderſtanding of the Senſe of the Article in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, ſettling the Duty of Exciſe, which having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt the ſeveral Meaſures, not very exactly, admitted a double Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction as to the Quantity what was to be eſteemed the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0554400100:577"/>
Barrel: The Commiſſioners had charged it one way, and the Brewers demanded it another, as follows.</p>
               <p>The Act expreſſes it thus.<q>VII. That all the parts of the united Kingdom be for ever and after the Union, Liable to the ſame Exciſes upon all exciſeable liquors, excepting only that the thirty four Gallons <hi>Engliſh</hi> to the Barrel of Beer or Ale, amounting to Twelve Gallons <hi>Scots</hi> preſent meaſure, ſold in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by the Brewer at nine ſhilling ſix pence <hi>Sterling</hi> excluding all Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and retailed including Duties on the Retailers profit, at two pence the <hi>Scots</hi> Pint, or eight part of the <hi>Scots</hi> Gallon, be not after the Union lyable on account of the preſent Exciſe upon Exciſeable Liquors in <hi>England,</hi> to any higher Impoſition than two ſhillings <hi>Sterling</hi> upon the foreſaid thirty four Gallons <hi>Engliſh</hi> Meaſure being twelve Gallons the preſent <hi>Scots</hi> Meaſure, and that the Exciſe ſettled in <hi>England</hi> on all other Liquors when the Union Commences, take place throughout the whole united Kingdom.</q>
               </p>
               <p>When the Exciſe Office came to Charge the Brewer upon this Cauſe, they could reckon it no otherwiſe than as in <hi>England,</hi> by the Gauge of Thirty Four Gallons <hi>Engliſh</hi> to the Barrel; And thus the Brewer ſtood Charged for ſome Time.</p>
               <p>But the Brewers objected, and ſticking to the Letter of the Article demanded, to pay but 2 <hi>ſh.</hi> for 12 <hi>Scots</hi> Gallons, whether it over-run the <hi>Engliſh</hi> 34 Gallons or no.</p>
               <p>This occaſioned ſome ſmall Debate, but the Prudence of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners prevented the Clamour ſome People would willingly have raiſed upon it, and the Juſtices of Peace directing 1/17. in each Thirty Four Gallons to be allowed, the Brewer for the preſent left it Undetermined till the Parliament ſhould ſettle it; And thus the Brewers were made Eaſie; It is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, to the Honour of the perſons employed in the firſt Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Exciſe in <hi>Scotland;</hi> That conſidering the Ignorance of the moſt part of their Officers in the Art of Gauging, and in the new Methods of taking the Worts, and making a Charge, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Difficulty of ſatisfying and convincing the People who were to pay the Duty, that they had no wrong done them, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves being unable to examine the Gaugers Accounts, no Duty was ever ſettled with ſo little Noiſe, or with ſo few Complaints, not one perſon that ever I could hear of having any Appeal from the Commiſſioners Sentences, or making any Complaint of Injuſtice done them; But the Collection went on eaſie, was collected quietly, paid cheerfully, and viſibly improved the Revenue, tho' nothing was paid by the Brewer more than they paid before.</p>
               <p>Nor had it been poſſible to collect this Duty legally, if it had not been ſo, for the Commiſſioners of the Exciſe laboured under another Difficulty which none of the other Branches of the Revenue were troubled with, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Laws of Collection being by the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion to be the ſame as in <hi>England,</hi> and the Juſtices of the Peace being by the Act of Parliament 12. <hi>Carol.</hi> II. in <hi>England</hi> made Judges between the Queen and the Subject, in caſes of Diſpute; from
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0554400100:578"/>
the beginning of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion till about <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1708, which was 15 Months, they were without the Aſſiſtance of Juſtices to determine thoſe Diſputes.</p>
               <p>There was indeed a Nomination of Juſtices by the Privy Council of <hi>Scotland</hi> 15 <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1707, as will appear in its place, and for ſome few Months they did meet and Act; But this was a new Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, and the Centlemen named were yet young in their Buſineſs, little help could be had from them, and which was ſtill worſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had time to inform themſelves, their Power died by the Act of Paliament in <hi>England,</hi> diſſolving the Privy Council in <hi>Scotland.</hi> This Act paſt in the beginning of the firſt <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, and by the Ceaſing of that Power, from whence thoſe Juſtices derived, the Power of the Juſtices alſo Ceaſed; and they were now to receive new Commiſſions from the Lord Chancellor of <hi>Britain,</hi> as the Juſtices in <hi>England</hi> alſo did—; This was not Finiſhed till <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1708; ſo that in all that Time, the Commiſſioners of the Exciſe had no legal Authority before whom they could Convict any Offender, or puniſh any Breach of the Law, or by whom any Caſe could be Determined.</p>
               <p>Yet their Buſineſs went on, and no Complaint was heard againſt their Management, no Appeal made againſt them, no Difficulties but what they work'd thro', to the general ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>The Exciſe as well as Cuſtoms in <hi>Scotland</hi> had been Farmed out; or Let in Tack, <hi>as they call it,</hi> the Tackſmen or Farmers did their beſt—, for their own Intereſt; But ſeveral Circumſtances rendred their Method of Collecting the Exciſe, unfit to be Imitated, ſuch as their Officers, <hi>who were intirely ignorant of the Art of Gauging,</hi>

               <p>On this account when the firſt of <hi>May</hi> came, &amp; the Union taking place, the new Duty was to begin, the Government found themſelves ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to ſend down a great many Officers into <hi>Scotland,</hi> if poſſible, to put Things into ſome Order, and prepare the People for the new Method of Collection—; What Treatment theſe Officers received in <hi>Scotland,</hi> how ill the People there uſed them, and how little they were able to do, will beſt appear by this, That the Government found themſelves obliged by Proclamation, to let the Duty go on for ſome Time in the ſame Methods, and Collected by the ſame Officers, till the new Methods could be prepared.</p>

               <p>This makes the Difficulty of Settling the Exciſe in <hi>Scotland</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and indeed who ever conſiders the manner of Collection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Union, as before; will Wonder, how it was poſſible ever to bring the Buſineſs into any Order, for the People being moſt intolerably Averſe at firſt, to the new Regulations, raiſed innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Clamours at the Officers that came from <hi>England,</hi> as Impoſing Novelties on them, and confounding their Buſineſs—; And here, as well as in the Cuſtoms, the Clamour againſt <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> being imployed, was laid hold of, but the Conduct of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners here likewiſe effectually Anſwered that Pretence, for no ſooner had the Officers, ſent by the Commiſſioners in <hi>England,</hi> as above, done the Work they came about, <hi>viz.</hi> in Directing and Inſtructing the Officers in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but the greateſt part of them were ſent back again, and ſo few <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> remained in the Exciſe, that it is not worth Naming.</p>

               <p>Nor was the Duty of Exciſe as a Revenue without its Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>as well as the Cuſtoms,</hi> the Article of Private Rights, reſerved by the Union, had of courſe brought ſeveral Exemptions upon them, ſome of which have proved very conſiderable Hindrances to the Duty.</p>
               <p>The Commiſſioners however, Diſputed with ſome of thoſe People who claim'd Exemptions of Duty, and the Debate on thoſe Heads, lay Undetermined before the Barons of Exchequer, at the Writing theſe Sheets.</p>
               <p>Under all theſe Diſcouragements, yet the Collection went on, and the Brewers ſoon became Satisfied with the manner of Charging the Exciſe, <hi>viz.</hi> by Gauging, as the moſt Equal, Indifferent, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably certain; and, as a method no Man could be Wronged by—; Which giving them all an Equality with one another; was very much the Advantage of the Fair Traders—, who always Suffer by the Frauds of Clandeſtine Dealing.</p>
               <p>Nay, this was evident by the Brewers themſelves, who differing with the City of <hi>Edinburghs</hi> Aſſeſſors, about the Taxes paid to the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0554400100:580"/>
City, endeavoured to have the City Officers, Charge them by the Gauging Rod, as in the Exciſe, but could not obtain it.</p>
               <p>I have inſiſted upon the Difficulties of ſettling theſe Things, to ſhow the World the abſolute Neceſſity, of placing the Collection of the Revenue in <hi>Scotland,</hi> diſtinct from that in <hi>England;</hi> And alſo, as a Thing needful, to ſhow by what Steps the ſeveral Offices ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to that Order and Exactneſs, which they now appeared to be Managed in.</p>
               <p>I come now to the Affair of the Equivalent.</p>
               <p>The Calculations and Proportions between the Nations, <hi>being the Ground from whence it became payable to Scotland;</hi> I have gone thro' already, as diſtinctly as I can, in the ſeveral Obſervations on the Minutes of the Treaty, firſt at <hi>London,</hi> and after, in the Parliament of <hi>Scotland;</hi> We are now come to the payment of it.</p>
               <p>The Parliament had Determined, both how it ſhould be Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of, and who ſhould Diſpoſe it, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Queen ſhould Name Commiſſioners to Receive and Iſſue out the ſaid Money, according to the Terms of the Union; This you have expreſly in the Fifteenth Article of the Union, as concluded at <hi>London,</hi> as follows; <hi>And it is agreed, That Her Majeſty be Impowered to appoint Commiſſioners, who ſhall be accountable to the Parliament of</hi> Great-Britain, <hi>for diſpoſing the ſaid Summe of three hundred, ninety eight thouſand, eighty five Pounds, ten Shillings, and all other Moneys which ſhall ariſe to</hi> Scotland, <hi>upon the Agreements aforeſaid, to the purpoſes before-mentioned: Which Commiſſioners ſhall be Impowered to call for, Receive, and Diſpoſe of the ſaid Moneys in manner aforeſaid, and to inſpect the Books of the ſeveral Collectors of the ſaid Revenues, and of all other Duties, from whence an Equivalent may ariſe; And that the Collectors and Managers of the ſaid Revenues and Duties be obliged to give to the ſaid Commiſſioners ſubſcribed Authentick Abbreviates of the Produce of ſuch Revenues and Duties ariſing in their reſpective Diſtricts; And that the ſaid Commiſſioners ſhall have their Office within the Limits of</hi> Scotland, <hi>and ſhall, in ſuch Office, keep Books containing Accounts of the Amount of the Equivalents, and how the ſame ſhall have been diſpoſed of from time to time, which may be inſpected by any of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects who ſhall deſire the ſamen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Queen, purſuant to this Power, appointed Commiſſioners for the Management of the Equivalent, and the Money being raiſed by Parliament, lay ready in the Bank of <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>The Four Merchants of <hi>London</hi> were Named, becauſe as Members of the Bank of <hi>England,</hi> they were required to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent upon the Spot, in order to ſupport the Credit of the Bank, in caſe any Body had ſcrupled their Bills; And indeed there was Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſufficient for their being there, as will appear preſently.</p>
               <p>It was now the beginning of <hi>July,</hi> and the Money was not yet come away from <hi>London;</hi> It would be Endleſs to Record here, the Scandalous Reflections ſpread about, of the Delay of Payment, and how the <hi>Engliſh</hi> having ſecured the main Point, would pay the Money when they pleaſed, or perhaps never; and ſome ran it up to that Height, as to ſay, That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Deſigned to Cheat them of the Money.</p>
               <p>Again, another ſort of People pretended the Union was broke, becauſe the Money was not paid by the firſt of <hi>May,</hi> and there was a Diſcourſe of ſome Gentlemen, who came up to the Croſs of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> and Proteſted in the Name of the whole <hi>Scots</hi> Nation, That the Conditions of the Treaty being not complyed with, and the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0554400100:582"/>
Terms performed, the whole was Void, and <hi>Scotland</hi> was again Free, when ever an Occaſion offered, to lay hold of that Freedom—; That ſome People were ſo weak to Talk thus, and that a certain Gentleman was Fooliſh enough, to make ſuch a Formal Proteſtation, I have ſome Reaſon to believe; But that D— <hi>H—</hi> was the Man, I profeſs not to know, and believe, that Noble Perſon to underſtand the Nature of the Treaty, and the Nature of Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo, better than ſo.</p>
               <p>Be it as it will, ſuch Proteſtation was of no uſe, neither could it have any Signification, being made purely without Ground, the Treaty having no where Tyed up the Government of <hi>England,</hi> to have the Money actually in <hi>Scotland</hi> by ſuch a Day—; Nor was <hi>England</hi> by the Treaty, under any Obligation to a Day of Payment; But Two Things preſcribed the payment, and a Third clears it all moſt effectually.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That by the Cuſtom of <hi>England,</hi> any payment Contracted for, <hi>ſine Die,</hi> becomes a <hi>Debt Demander,</hi> or payable at Demand; and ſo the Day being not prefixt in the Articles, the Money became pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently due, <hi>viz.</hi> the firſt of <hi>May,</hi> but under no Forfeiture on delay of Days, much leſs a Diſſolution of Articles.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But if this Nicety had been inſiſted on, then it is Anſwered, That the Money was actually payed by <hi>England,</hi> being delivered by the Treaſury to a certain Number of the Commiſſioners, appointed for receiving the Equivalent, and this, either upon or before the firſt of <hi>May;</hi> And tho' it was not actually come down into <hi>Scotland,</hi> yet if it was delivered in <hi>London,</hi> to the proper Perſons appointed to receive it, the Government of <hi>England</hi> was fairly acquitted of the payment—; And this is to be ſeen by the ſaid Commiſſioners Receipt in the Exchequer in <hi>England,</hi> when the Money was paid.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But a third Clauſe ſhewed all this to be an Inſignificant and a moſt Ignorant Pretence, for the Equivalent was actually paid, and made good to <hi>Scotland,</hi> before the Treaty was concluded, and it was expreſly ſtipulated ſo to be Ordered, in the Fifteenth Article, in theſe words; <hi>It is agreed, that</hi> Scotland <hi>ſhall have an Equivalent for what the Subjects thereof ſhall be ſo charged towards payment of the ſaid Debts of</hi> England, <hi>in all particulars whatſoever, in manner fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,</hi> viz. <hi>That before the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of the ſaid Kingdoms, the Summe of three hundred, ninety eight thouſand and eighty five pound ten ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings be granted to Her Majeſty by the Parliament of</hi> England, <hi>for the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes after-mentioned, being the Equivalent, to be anſwered to</hi> Scotland <hi>for ſuch parts of the ſaid Cuſtoms and Exciſes upon all Exciſeable Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, with which that Kingdom is to be charged upon the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, as will be applicable to the payment of the ſaid Debts of</hi> England, <hi>accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Proportions which the preſent Cuſtoms in</hi> Scotland, <hi>being Thirty thouſand Pounds</hi> per Annum, <hi>do bear to the Cuſtoms in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>computed at one Million, three hundred, forty one thouſand, five hundred and fifty nine Pounds</hi> per Annum: <hi>And which the preſent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes on Exciſeable Liquors in</hi> Scotland, <hi>being thirty three thouſand and</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0554400100:583"/>
                  <hi>five hundred Pounds</hi> per Annum, <hi>do bear to the Exciſes on Exciſeable Liquors in</hi> England, <hi>computed at nine hundred, forty ſeven thouſand, ſix hundred and two Pounds</hi> per Annum; <hi>Which Summe of three hundred, ninety eight thouſand, eighty five Pounds, ten Shillings, ſhall be due and payable from the time of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is evident from this Article, That the Security Demanded by <hi>Scotland,</hi> for the payment of this Money, was, <hi>That the Parliament of</hi> England <hi>ſhould raiſe the Sum agreed, and ſhould grant it to Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, for the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes in that Fifteenth Article Expreſſed,</hi> That is in ſhort, <hi>That the Parliament ſhould grant to Her Majeſty ſuch a Sum of Money, and appropriate it to the payment of the Equivalent</hi>—; This really was payment, and was ſo Accepted, and the Money being Granted to the Queen, was nothing but as a Depoſite in a Third Hand, till the Ratification of the Treaty ſhould paſs in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and be Confirmed in <hi>England,</hi> or till the Union ſhould take place, WHEN, AND AS SOON AS that was done, the Money was actually the Right, the proper Goods of the <hi>Scots,</hi> and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>England</hi> could not have kept it back, no tho' the Treaty had been <hi>afterward</hi> Diſſolved, or broken; So that the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt the payment of the Equivalent, <hi>in Time,</hi> Dyes, and falls to the Ground, in this, That it was actually payed by <hi>England</hi> before the Union began, and plac'd in ſuch Hands as a Truſt, to be at the Demand of the <hi>Scots,</hi> as ſoon as the Union took place, <hi>Due and payable from the Time of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> are the Words of the Article—; As ſoon therefore as the Union took place, the Treaſury of <hi>England</hi> became Debitor to <hi>Scotland,</hi> for ſuch a Sum of Money—; But the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> with whom the Treaty was made, were Diſcharged of the Payment, as ſoon as ever the Act of Appropriation was paſt in the Houſe.</p>
               <p>This, I think, is clear, and admits of no Diſpute, but it ſhows the Weakneſs of thoſe People, that promiſed themſelves any thing from the delay of the Money coming into <hi>Scotland</hi>—; Nor did their Error ceaſe here, for when the Money came, they were not at all better pleaſed, but raiſed new Clamours at the Union—, and really went to that Height in their Reproaches, that it ſeemed as if they had yet latent Expectations of raiſing a new Tumult.</p>
               <p>It was indeed ſomething remarkable here, and not a few People took notice of it, That the very ſame People, who juſt before Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed at the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for not paying the Money, and cried out they were Cheated, and the Union broken, were the ſame—, who, when the Money came, made as much Noiſe on the other hand of being Bought and Sold, &amp; that Money being the Price of their Countrey.</p>
               <p>The Violence of this Temper appearing ſo openly, I can not be counted partial in giving a true Account of it, ſince I could not be Faithful to the Matters of Fact, if I Omitted it.</p>
               <p>On the Day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the Money came to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> in Twelve Waggons, Guarded by a Party of <hi>Scots</hi> Dragoons, and was carried directly to the Caſtle; If I omit to enter into the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0554400100:584"/>
of the Reproaches and Railings at the poor Innocent People that brought it, nay, at the very Horſes that drew the Carriages, it is, becauſe it was a Folly below Reproof, and rather deſerves Pity.</p>
               <p>If I omit Naming a known Perſon, in no concealed Station, who was for having the Dragoons that Guarded it, Hanged for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in—; And being asked, What he would have the poor Men do with it? Anſwered, They ſhould have cut all them that brought it to pieces, and kept the Money from coming into the Countrey: If I omit Naming this Gentleman, it is in reſpect to his Character, and in hopes he may live to be Wiſer, and to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his inconſiderate Raſhneſs.</p>
               <p>The Waggons, as is Noted, were driven directly to the Caſtle, and the Money Lodged there, to be iſſued in its Courſe—; The People ſet on by proper Engines, ſhewed their Diſſatisfaction at firſt, by rudely Stoning the poor Carters and Drivers, and Two or Three were very much hurt by Stones, as they came back with their Horſes from the Caſtle.</p>
               <p>But this was but the Remains of the Tumultuous Temper, we have been taking Notice of before, and the poor Ignorant People Acting only from outward appearances, without Conſideration—, grew Calm again of courſe—; Nor among the moſt Malecontent perſons could I ever find any, that when the Money upon the <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> Stock came to be paid, would think the <hi>Species</hi> Unhallowed, enough to refuſe their ſhare of it.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the Money was Arrived, the Commiſſioners for the Equivalent began to Sit, and immediately applyed themſelves to the Diſtribution of it according to the Terms of the Treaty—; And having ſet a parta due Proportion for the Expence of the Coinage, they went immediately to Work with the <hi>African</hi> Stock, and began to pay off.</p>
               <p>Yet I muſt not Omit a Difficulty here, that had almoſt put the Affair to a full ſtop for a while—, and this was from the <hi>Species</hi> of the Money they had brought; The Caſe was as follows.</p>
               <p>The Bank of <hi>England</hi> had that year, upon an Advance of a Sum of Money to the Government, received 1200000 <hi>libs.</hi> or there abouts, in Exchequer Bills—, which being made Current by the Credit, both of the Government in publick, and after by the Bank in particular, they preſumed would paſs in payment, as common paper Credit uſually did in <hi>London,</hi> without Intereſt, being always payable at demand by the Bank in <hi>London,</hi> this they expected ſhould go down without any Difficulty in <hi>Scotland.</hi>

               <p>But the Bank ſeemed under ſome Miſtake as to the Extent of their Reputation, or at leaſt as to the Circumſtances of <hi>Scotland,</hi> when they propoſed the putting off theſe Exchequer Bills there.</p>
               <p>However, they ventur'd, and ſending only 100000 <hi>lib:</hi> in ready Money, in the Waggons mentioned before, the other 298085 <hi>lib.</hi> 10 <hi>ſhillings</hi>—, was ſent down in this Paper Credit or Exchequer Bills.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0554400100:585"/>
This raiſed a new Clamour in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and abundance of People run away with it, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trick'd them; that they had ſent them Paper in ſtead of Money, that the great Argument formerly uſed to perſwade <hi>Scotland</hi> to the Union, to take upon them a ſhare of the Burden of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Debts, and to accept of an Equivalent, was the great Advantage that ſhould accrue to <hi>Scotland,</hi> by the Circulating of ſo much ready Money in the Nation—; And that now they were to be put off with Bills payable 300 Miles off, and which if Loſtor Miſlaid, or by Accident Burnt, were Irrecoverable.</p>
               <p>The Truth is, The Bank of <hi>England</hi> took a wrong ſtep here—; For <hi>First,</hi> They ventured upon <hi>Scotland</hi> with their Bills in ſtead of Money, without Conſulting either the Temper or the Circumſtances of <hi>Scotland</hi> at that Time.</p>
               <p>Had they Correſponded with the Bank of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and obtained of the ſaid Bank to Circulate their Bills, either by their own Credit or Caſh, had they Eſtabliſhed any running Caſh in <hi>Scotland</hi> for the Circulation, where they ſhould have been Received and Iſſued on Occaſion, they had come off better—; Or had the Bills had running Intereſt upon them, that thoſe People who laid them up, might have had an Increaſe upon them as they lay by, there had been ſome Reaſon to expect they might have paſt.</p>
               <p>But the Bank had Ingroſſed the Intereſt paid on the Bills by the Government, and then ſent them Naked into the World, to Run purely on the Credit of their Fund, without any Intereſt running upon them. This, and conſidering <hi>Scotland,</hi> a Place not yet of a great in land Commerce, in which alone ſuch Bills are capable of being made Current, made it very improbable, that their Bills ſhould paſs in <hi>Scotland;</hi> This Miſtake the Commiſſioners them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſaw, as ſoon as they came to <hi>Scotland</hi>—; And therefore immediately ſent away to <hi>England</hi> for 50000 <hi>lib. ſterling</hi> more in Gold—; Nor had this been able to have carried them thorow the Payment, had not the Commiſſioners, very prudently taken all the Exchequer Bills that any One brought them, and given Bills of Exchange for them payable in <hi>London</hi>—.</p>
               <p>When the Commiſſioners found how it was—, they ſaw no Remedy, but to Declare, That tho' they had brought Exchequer Bills down, in order to ſupply the deficiency of Bullion, which was then ſcarce enough in <hi>England,</hi> yet that no body ſhould be obliged to take them without their Conſent, nor ſhould any body be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed payment as they came in their Order; And as a certain Great Perſon began with them, as ſome thought, by way of Experiment, and having a Demand for 4 or 5000 <hi>lib.</hi> upon the <hi>African</hi> Stock, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to take any of the ſaid Bills, the Commiſſioners immediately Ordered it all to be paid in <hi>Specie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This, and a conſtant Currency of Payment, began to raiſe them ſome Reputation, and ſome who were Friends to the Government, and ſaw the Exigence of the preſent caſe, accepted of Exchequer Bills for large Sums: Others would take half Money, half Bills—;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0554400100:586"/>
And others that came for their Money before their Turn came, yet had it offered them if they would take Bills, ſtill preſerving this Point Sacred, that no body was refuſed his payment in courſe, in Money, if he inſiſted on it; Thus, with a great deal of Difficulty, at laſt they work'd thorow the payment of the <hi>African</hi> Stock—; The Bills went all away to <hi>England</hi> ſo directly, that in ſix Months time there was not one to be ſeen.</p>
               <p>So the Main End of the Bank, <hi>viz.</hi> The Circulation of theſe Bills in Trade, as a paper Credit, was quite Loſt, which, had the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt been runing upon them, would have been eaſie, and readily complyed with.</p>
               <p>However, it was at laſt contrary to Expectation, concluded, and the whole <hi>African</hi> Stock being paid off, that Company Diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and Died.</p>
               <p>The next Affair was the Settlement of Juſtice in <hi>Scotland</hi>—; And this ſuffering ſome Alteration, it is needful to give a true Account of it according to my Title.</p>
               <p>It had been ſtipulated by the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Articles, <hi>That all other Laws, in uſe within the Kingdom of</hi> Scotland, <hi>do after the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, and notwithſtanding thereof, remain in the ſame Force as before (except ſuch as are contrary to, or inconſiſtent with the Terms of this Treaty) but alterable by the Parliament of</hi> Great-Britain, <hi>with this Difference betwixt the Laws concerning Publick Right, Policy, and Civil Government, and thoſe which concern private Right; That the Laws which concern publick Right, Policy, and Civil Government, may be made the ſame throughout the whole <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Kingdom; But that no Alteration be made in Laws which concern private Right, except for evident <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tility of the Subjects within</hi> Scotland.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Court of Seſſion, or Colledge of Juſtice, do after the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, and notwithſtanding thereof, remain in all time coming within</hi> Scotland, <hi>as it is now Conſtituted by the Laws of that Kingdom, and with the ſame Authority and Privileges as before the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, ſubject nevertheleſs to ſuch Regulations for the better Adminiſtration of Juſtice, as ſhall be made by the Parliament of</hi> Great-Britain; <hi>And that the Court of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticiary do alſo after the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, and notwithſtanding thereof, remain in all time coming within</hi> Scotland, <hi>as it is now Constituted by the Laws of that Kingdom, and with the ſame Authority and Privileges as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, ſubject nevertheleſs to ſuch Regulations as ſhall be made by the Parliament of</hi> Great-Britain, <hi>and without prejudice of other Rights of Juſticiary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Clauſes preſerved the ordinary Proceſs of Law in Caſe of private Right, in the ſame Courſe and Condition as before; but all Pleas of the Crown, Matters of Diſpute between the Queen and the Subject, <hi>relating to the Revenue,</hi> and Trade, being to be the ſame as in <hi>England;</hi> For that Reaſon; there were neceſſary Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be made in the Methods, and even new Models of Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to be Formed, ſpecial to <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>

And Firſt of the Civil Peace.</p>
               <p>The ſeveral Branches of the Revenue, depending much upon the Execution of petty Juſtice, and particularly the Exciſe, in which the Juſtices of Peace are in moſt Caſes, the Judges between the Brewer and the Collector; In this caſe, it was Neceſſary to Renew the Model formerly uſed, and taken from <hi>England, viz.</hi> Of Juſtices, Conſtables, Headboroughs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this not only for the Deciding Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in the Duties, but in Forcible Entries, Executing Warrants, Apprehending Offenders, and the like; In which Caſes Conſtables and other Officers are neceſſary, both to preſerve the Peace, to Aſſiſt in ſearching Houſes, and in Executing the reſpective Warrants of the ſaid Juſtices of the Peace.</p>
               <p>This, I ſay, made it abſolutely Neceſſary, to Eſtabliſh the ſame Method of Civil Juſtice in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as in <hi>England, viz.</hi> by Juſtices of the Peace, Conſtables, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which at that Time was not in uſe in the whole Countrey.</p>
               <p>It had indeed been formerly attempted in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and there were ſome Acts of Parliament then in Force, for the making Juſtices of the Peace in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as in <hi>England,</hi> particularly the 12<hi>th. Act</hi> of the firſt <hi>Parl. Carol.</hi> 2. <hi>anno</hi> 1661, and again by the 38<hi>th. Act</hi> of the ſame Parliament—; And theſe Acts are Recited again in the Proclamation for Erecting new Juſtices at this Time, which Proclamation leaving out the Names of the Perſons as <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeleſs and Tedious, I have annexed in the <hi>Appendix</hi> N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> F (3).</p>
               <p>Upon the <hi>Revolution,</hi> this Method of Governing by Juſtices, however uſeful in its kind, yet as having been Negligently or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrarily made uſe of in the former Times, was laid aſide, and the Government of <hi>Scotland</hi> lay as it had uſually done, too much in the abſolute Diſpoſition of the Heretable Magiſtrates, ſuch as Sheriffs of Counties, Steuarts of Stewartries, and ſuch Right as the Superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Uſages of Places gave to the Lairds; A Conſtitution not at all Calculated for the Liberty of <hi>Scotland,</hi> or the increaſe of the Happineſs of the People.</p>
               <p>Upon the Settling the Cuſtoms and Exciſe, as above, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came, I ſay, neceſſary to reſtore the former Model of petty Juſtice, as <hi>per</hi> the Proclamation before Named, was done at this Time, and accordingly Juſtices of the Peace and Conſtables were Erected all over <hi>Scotland</hi>—; But this received another Interruption as a Conſequence of the Union, which put a ſtop to all the Civil Adminiſtration for a Time, as follows.</p>
               <p>By the Nineteenth Article of the Union, the Affair of the Privy Council in <hi>Scotland</hi> was left thus.<q>And that after the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, the Queens Majeſty and Her Royal Succeſſors, may continue a Privy Council in <hi>Scotland,</hi> for preſerving of publick Peace and Order, until the Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> ſhall think fit to alter it, or Eſtabliſh any other effectual Method for that end.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:0554400100:588"/>
As ſoon as the Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> met, and began to Enquire into the Matter, they found the very Nature of a Privy Council in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but eſpecially the Manner, <hi>of their Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,</hi> ſo inconſiſtent with the Treaty of Union, and above all, with the Liberty of the Subject, that they effectually Diſſolved it, and Voted, that there ſhould be but one Privy Council in <hi>Britain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know this Act was oppoſed by ſeveral ſorts of People—, and Complaint was made after its Diſſolution, That <hi>Scotland</hi> was left without any Form of Government; ſome others Complained from another principle, of which I need ſay nothing here.</p>
               <p>The Miniſters of State alſo oppoſed it a little, but no further, than as they thought Things were not Ripe in <hi>Scotland,</hi> for ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den a Diſſolution of the Face of Power among them, and therefore would have had it continued for ſome certain limited Time only, and that with ſuch Limitations of Authority, as might be Regulated by Parliament—; But it was thought both Burdenſome and Dangerous, and indeed the Council in <hi>Scotland</hi> Acting Arbitrarily, had given the Lovers of Liberty ſuch an Averſion to them, that they could not hear of it; And ſo after ſome Struggle, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil was Diſſolved by Act of Parliament.</p>
               <p>This is mentioned here, becauſe of the Interruption given by the Accident of this Diſſolution, to the Courſe of petty Juſtice, as aforeſaid; for now all the Commiſſions of the Peace Ceaſed, being Granted by the ſaid Privy Council, and by the new Eſtabliſhment of the Council which was now to be called <hi>The Council of Great-Britain,</hi> and which was to have the ſame Powers, and no other, which the Council of <hi>England</hi> had before; The Commiſſions of the Peace could no more be Given by the Council, but by the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor; The Commiſſions therefore Terminated, and the new Method of Adminiſtration met with an Interruption of ſeveral Months, but was Reſtored again by a general Commiſſion of the Peace, under the Great Seal of <hi>Britain,</hi> Nominating Juſtices of the Peace thro' all <hi>Scotland,</hi> conform to the Method of <hi>England;</hi> This Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion bears Date the 13 Day of <hi>May Anno</hi> 1708. And on this Foot the whole Iſland now ſtands in one Form of Adminiſtration, as to petty Juſtice, and therefore this Act is called, <hi>An Act for rendring the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion more compleat;</hi> Which Act for the more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular underſtanding this Affair, I have added in the <hi>Appendix,</hi> N<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> (H. 3.) But here it is to be obſerved, That tho' this Act gives Power to all the Juſtices of the Peace in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to <hi>Do, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe, and Exerciſe over all Perſons within their ſeveral Bounds, whatever doth appertain to the Office, and Trust of a Juſtice of Peace, by virtue of the Laws in</hi> England <hi>before the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, in Relation to or for the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Publick Peace;</hi> Yet it is provided, That <hi>in all the Seſſions of the Peace, they are preſcribed to the Methods of Tryal and Judgment, according to the Laws of</hi> Scotland.</p>
               <p>This I Note here, becauſe ſome would have ſuggeſted, That this Erecting of Courts of petty Juſtice, <hi>For ſuch the ſeveral Seſſions of the Juſtices properly are</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> &amp; Giving them Authorities from the Laws
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0554400100:589"/>
and Uſage of <hi>England,</hi> was an Invaſion of the Nineteenth Article of the Union—, but it was clear otherwiſe, for tho' in the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Peace their Methods were the ſame as in <hi>England,</hi> yet it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable;<list>
                     <item>1. That very Clauſe was Enacted in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the ſeveral Acts of Parliament of 1661, recited in the Commiſſion, and never Reſcinded in <hi>Scotland;</hi> And by the Union thoſe Acts are of courſe Confirmed, not being any way inconſiſtent with or contradicting the Treaty.</item>
                     <item>2. Had it not been ſo, the Thing it ſelf had been no way Injurious to the Treaty of Union, the Methods of Tryal, Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Execution, being as above, preſcribed by the Laws of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and to continue in the ſame Form as before.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>And this will more particularly appear, in Reading the very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Form of the Commiſſions of the Peace Granted by the Queen, to the reſpective Counties or Shires in <hi>Scotland,</hi> One of which, <hi>viz.</hi> for the Shire of <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> For the more eſpecial un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding this Matter, I have annexed in the <hi>Appendix,</hi> part II. <hi>Numb.</hi> (G. 3.)</p>
               <p>I might have entred here upon the Differences of Proceedings in the ſeveral new Eſtabliſhed Courts of Juſtice, as of the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, and Admiralty, and the General and petty Seſſions of the Juſtices—; But theſe Things ſeem not the proper Subject of a Hiſtory, ſo I wave them here; The latter part alſo being very well performed to my hand, I mean, relating to the Proceedings and Office of a Juſtice of the Peace in <hi>Scotland,</hi> by the Ingenious Hand of Mr. <hi>William Forbes</hi> Advocate in <hi>Scotland;</hi> To which I refer the Reader.</p>
               <p>There was an Alteration in Matters of Juſticiary, as it is called in <hi>Scotland</hi>—; That is, of Criminal Proceſs; For whereas this was wholly left to a certain Court, conſiſting of Five Judges, who were therefore called, <hi>The Lords of the Juſticiary,</hi> and that their Court was holden only at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> it was conſidered, that this was too great an Interruption of Juſtice, and often times oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned the neglect of Proſecution, as well as made that Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both Difficult and Chargeable to the Subject, by which means Thefts, Violences, and ſometimes Murders eſcaped due Puniſhment, the Parliament Determined by the ſame Act of Parliament, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, That the Lords of the Juſticiary ſhould divide the Kingdom into Circuits, and that theſe Circuits ſhould be Twice a Year—, that thus Juſtice might, as in <hi>England,</hi> be carried Home to every Mans Door, and all the Former Inconveniencies might be for the future avoided.</p>
               <p>The Manner, Methods, and other Circumſtances, ſuch as Time, Place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Since they were nothing at all Altered, the Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament referring wholly to a former Law, made in the 3<hi>d.</hi> Seſſion of the 2<hi>d.</hi> Parliament of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. came not under the Head
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0554400100:590"/>
of Alterations which I am now upon, and conſequently need not be inſerted.</p>
               <p>I might bring the Alterations of Elections of Members for Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament into this Head, as well of the Lords as Commons; But it requires nothing, but to repeat the very Articles of the Union again; And I think it is ſo expreſly ſet down there, that it needs no Comment at all, being nothing but meer Matter of Form; But as there required ſome Addition to the Manner of the Returning of Writs, and of the Managing Elections, you will find them in the ſame Act of Parliament laſt quoted, and printed in the <hi>Appendix</hi> as above—, all that Matter being fully determined in this Act—.</p>
               <p>The Matter of the Exchequer Court now erected, needs no other Deſcription than this, That it is erected in the ſame Form, and proceeds by the ſame Method as in <hi>England,</hi> having Barons, a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancer, Treaſurer, and all the reſpective Clerks and Offices as in <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>The Admiralty Court in <hi>Scotland</hi> remained, and the Earl of <hi>Weemyſs,</hi> who was before Lord Admiral in <hi>Scotland,</hi> was now made Vice-Admiral, by Commiſſion under the Prince of <hi>Denmark</hi> Lord High Admiral of <hi>Britain,</hi> and was, at the ſame time, nominated a Member of the Princes Council in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Inferior Courts of Judicature in the Admiralty remained as before, ſuffering no Alteration in Form, ſave that what related to the Publick Revenue, or the Claims of the Sovereign, began to be modelled as in <hi>England,</hi> agreeable to the 18th. and 19th. Articles of the Union.</p>
               <p>Thus the Law in <hi>Scotland</hi> remained intire, the Proceſs in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Cauſes being the ſame, and the Alterations being conſined, as <hi>per</hi> the Treaty, to the Eſtabliſhed Methods of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I come now to the Coyn; And tho' this has been a Thing of great Conſequence, yet it requires little more to be ſaid to it, than juſt that it ſuffered a general Revolution; And that all the former Coyns of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as well as the Foreign <hi>Species</hi> of Money which went current in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Money excepted, was Called in and Recoyned, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Money being only to paſs current.</p>
               <p>But there was a Difficulty which I have noted in the Minutes gave them ſome Trouble, <hi>viz:</hi> That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Money, which went for one Penny in every Shilling Advance, ſhould be reduced to a <hi>Par,</hi> that the Loſs ſhould be made good by the Government, and yet the <hi>Engliſh</hi> not bring in great Quantities to <hi>Scotland,</hi> to be offered to the Mint at one Penny <hi>per</hi> Shilling, and immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived again with an Allowance of the Difference: To prevent
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0554400100:591"/>
this, that Contrivance was found out, to bring in all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Money at one certain Day, and receive it out again with an Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for the Difference—; This occaſioned the Proclamation for the Alteration, that all the Money ſhould be paid in on a ſhort Day, and immediately returned with Notes for the Difference; This Proclamation, as it expreſſes the whole Scheme, I have added in the <hi>Appendix, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>.

               <p>The ſeveral Proclamations for the gradual Calling in the Old Money, are too many to note here; It may ſuffice to hint, That, as the Foreign Money being brought in, which amounted to above 150000 Pounds <hi>Sterling;</hi> And this going into the Mint, the New Coyn began to Circulate very ſpeedily; And, at the Writing theſe Sheets, the whole Nation was full of New Money.</p>

               <p>There were ſeveral <hi>Species</hi> of <hi>Scots</hi> Money that had been current, and of which ſeveral Remainders were to be found—; But the Quantities were ſo ſmall, that I do not place them among the current Coyn.</p>
               <p>It is enough to ſay, that all ſorts were called in by the Treaty, and no Money made current by the Government, but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Britiſh</hi> Coyn.</p>
               <p>I need not Record the Days and Times, when and how long every particular <hi>Species</hi> were permitted to paſs; 'Tis enough to ſay, the Prudence of the Government ſo ordered it, that the People felt no Miſs, or Want of the current Money; And the Thing was done ſo gradually, that the New Money was Circulating, before the Old was Called in.</p>
               <p>This was done thus—; Firſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Money was reduced, as has been obſerved, by Proclamation—; Then the Foreign Money was brought in; And this being a much greater Quantity than was expected, the Mint immediately fell to Work with it—; And this, joyned to the Money brought down for the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, furniſh'd above 200000 <hi>l.</hi> in Silver Money, beſides what <hi>Engliſh</hi> Money was in the Countrey before; So that the New Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was diſpers'd in every Corner of the Nation inſenſibly, and the Old went off gradually, without any Interruption to Buſineſs—; And at the Writing theſe Sheets, the laſt, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Scots</hi> Milled Money was yet paſſing, but appointed to come into the Mint by a certain Day; There were ſeveral Proclamations for this, and ſeveral Days appointed; I have added only one in the <hi>Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix,</hi> to let the Reader into the Method ſettled for this purpoſe, which terminated the Currency of the <hi>Scots</hi> Money to the 25<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>February</hi> 1707/8; But even that Time was lengthened afterwards, and the <hi>Scots</hi> Money ſuffered to paſs again till the latter end of <hi>September</hi> 1708—; And thus by Degrees the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coyn pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0554400100:593"/>
and is now the only current Coyn of the Nation. This Proclamation is marked in the <hi>Appendix, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. K</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>I cannot ſay ſo much for the New Regulations of Weights and Meaſures, in which, tho' appointed by the Union to be made the ſame, little Progreſs could be made at the Writing of theſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, ſave that the Publick Buſineſs of the Cuſtom-Houſe was all ſettled by the Weights and Meaſures of <hi>England;</hi> But Cuſtom had ſo inured the People to the former Weights and Meaſures, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Weights for their Retailing Goods, and the Meaſures for Corn, that it was impoſſible to bring the Change about ſo ſoon; Time alone can bring it to the Iſſue deſigned.</p>
               <p>Nor is the reducing the Meaſures to an Uniform Standart ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary, as that we ſhould think the Union Defective for want of it; Since the Meaſures, <hi>eſpecially that which we call Dry Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as of Corn and Fruit,</hi> is at this time various almoſt all over <hi>England</hi>—; As particularly in the North, the <hi>Boll</hi> remains a received Meaſure in <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Cumberland,</hi> in the Weſt, as in <hi>Cornwal</hi> and <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> the Buſhel is almoſt two Buſhels of the common Meaſure—; Even the <hi>Wincheſter</hi> Buſhel, which is the Standart of Meaſure in <hi>England,</hi> varies, and in ſome places it contains eight Gallons, in others nine Gallons, in ſome places they have one to the Score thrown into the Meaſure, in other places not—; Again, in Liquid Meaſure we have the Quart of two kinds for ſeveral Liquors, as the Wine Quart and the <hi>Wincheſter</hi> Quart, we have the Pottle and Gallon for dry Meaſure, the Pint and thence up to the Gallon of Liquid Meaſure; in Coals we have what is called the Chalder at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and the Chalder at <hi>London,</hi> and the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chalder in ſeveral differing parts—; At <hi>London</hi> the Chalder is 36 Buſhels, at <hi>Sandwich</hi> 32, at <hi>Lym</hi> 40, at <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> 70 Buſhels; So, tho' the Meaſures of Corn and Liquors ſhould have their Varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in <hi>Scotland,</hi> according to the old Cuſtoms and Uſage of Towns, Counties, and Manners, yet this does not at all render the Union incompleat; Since the reducing the Weights and Meaſures to an equal Standart in the Publick Accounts, ſuch as in the Cuſtoms, Tolls, Exciſes, Publick Receipts and Payments, <hi>and the like,</hi> is as effectual an Equality as is needful; And indeed is as much as was intended by the Union, no Act of Parliament, Law, or Statute that can be made, being able to oblige the Countrey People in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place to leave off their wonted Calculations and Denominations of Things, which are frequently made upon the Foot of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Cuſtoms; <hi>For Example, as before,</hi> the Valuation of Lands, Tenor of Leaſes, the Rents, the Entails, Rent-Charges, Liferents, and Payments for, or out of Land Revenue, are all reckoned in <hi>Scotland</hi> by the <hi>Chalder, Boll, Firlot,</hi> and <hi>Lippy,</hi> and cannot be altered; Even Marriage Settlements and Entails are entered in this manner; And it would run <hi>Scotland</hi> into all manner of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, to oblige them at once to leave off all the Terms, by which their Lands are known Valued, Mortgaged, Entailed, Charged or Conveyed.</p>

I think we have thus gently touch'd at all the Alterations of Moment which were made in the Laws, Trade, Cuſtom and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of <hi>Scotland,</hi> according to my Title; But leſt it may be thought, That theſe Alterations ly too much diſperſed up and down this Book, in the Relation of particular Caſes, I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſum them up in the following Abridgement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> As to the Conſtitution, tho' laſt named—, I conceive it ſuffered ſome Alteration, tho' not, as was alledged by ſome, an intire Diſſolution—; It was not diſſolved, becauſe the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by King and Parliament continued the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> A Limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Monarchy; It received no Diminution, but an Addition of Privileges and Liberties; And had the <hi>Scots</hi> thought ſit to have gone a little further, and made Proviſion for Transferring their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periorities, they might have at laſt come to an intire Enjoyment of that ſame Liberty that <hi>England</hi> is now ſo happy in—; How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, tho' the Conſtitution received no Diſſolution, yet it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that it ſuffered Alterations in ſeveral Articles, of which theſe are the principal.<list>
                     <item>1. That tho the Monarchy is the ſame, yet that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Incorporated into one Monarchy with their Neighbour Kingdom, ſubjected for ever to the ſame Sovereign, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in War, Peace, Alliances and Succeſſion with them; So that they can no more act in their ſeparate Capacity, in any Thing relating to Government or Conſtitution.</item>
                     <item>2. They ſuffer Alterations in their Repreſentative—, and theſe conſiſt in Two Branches; <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Number of their Repreſentative is reduced to 45. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons paſs under a new Regulation, and are managed by a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Method. And, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That they Sit not any more in Parliament by themſelves, but in Conjunction with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament, Repreſenting the ſeveral Counties and Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as Members of the United Kingdom of <hi>Great Britain.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. The Hereditary Branch of Parliament, I mean the Peers, ſuffer alſo an Alteration, being changed from a full Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in Parliament to a Repreſentative Appearance, and that Repreſentative Limited to the Number of Sixteen.</item>
                     <item>4. Their Regal Adminiſtration ſuffers an Alteration; The Sovereign, who before executed the Civil Power in a ſeparate Capacity, being now obliged to change the Face of that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration into an United Management, Governing now by One Parliament, One Privy Council, One High Admiral, One Chancery, One Treaſury—; And, in ſhort, One ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Oeconomy of Government—; Thus the ſeveral di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Offices of Admiral, Chancellor, Treaſurer, Secretaries of State, and Preſident of Privy Council, ſunk in either King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and New Commiſſions were iſſued—; As One Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Council, and One Preſident, under the Title of Lord Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of the Privy Council of <hi>Britain,</hi> Lord High Chancellor of <hi>Britain,</hi> Lord High Treaſurer of <hi>Britain,</hi> Lord High Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0554400100:595"/>
of <hi>Britain,</hi> and the like, and which I cloſe all with, the Queen her ſelf lays down her ſeparate Titles, and is now no more Queen of <hi>England, Scotland, &amp;c.</hi> But Queen of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and is called in Miſſives, and in Foreign Accounts, Her <hi>Britannick</hi> Majeſty—; Her Troops are no more <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> but <hi>Britiſh</hi> Forces—; And the Arms of the Iſland are a new Incorporated and Quartered together—, as appears at large in the foregoing Sheets.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>This, I think, is the Sum of the principal Alterations in the Conſtitution of <hi>Scotland</hi> by the Union; In all which, except that of the Parliament, the Commons being reduced in Number, and the Lords by Repreſentative; I ſay, in all the reſt, <hi>England</hi> ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame Alterations as <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſuch as diſſolving her Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, her Name as a Kingdom, her Council, Great Offices, and Title of her Sovereign—; And all things began <hi>de novo</hi> in both Kingdoms, under the ſingle Denomination of <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Britiſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond Head of Alterations is that of the Laws; And this is ſo particularly entered into in the beginning of this very Part of my Work, that I need be but very ſhort.<list>
                     <item>1. The Laws of Government continue as the Government continues eſtabliſh'd in the Claim of Right, I mean as to the Limitations of Government and Obedience; Nor has <hi>Scotland</hi> ſuffered any Loſs, but rather been a manifeſt Gainer in this Point by the Union; The Privy Council Tyranny being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſh'd, who had arrived to that Height in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as to give their Acts almoſt of an equal Authority to Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment—; A Power wholly diſclaimed by the Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil in <hi>England,</hi> to whoſe Powers and Authorities the preſent Council of <hi>Britain</hi> is by Parliament expreſly Limited and Confined.</item>
                     <item>2. The Laws of Private Right have ſuffered no Alteration, other than as Private Right may be intermix'd with that of the Crown—; But all the Laws of Publick Right, ſuch as relate to Cuſtoms and Exciſes, have ſuffered the Alterations mentioned in the Union, a Court of Exchequer being eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd in <hi>Scotland</hi> for that purpoſe; And this was neceſſary, as has been noted, becauſe of the Alterations neceſſary in the Revenue, and in the reſpective Methods of Aſcertaining and Collecting the Cuſtoms, Exciſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> due to the Crown; And in this Clauſe may be included the ſeveral Laws for Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, Fines, Forfeitures, and Confiſcations, upon the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Treſpaſſes of the Laws relating to Cuſtoms and Exciſe, which were wholly new—.</item>
                     <item>3. The Governing Laws relating to the Civil Peace have ſuffered ſome Alteration, as to what was juſt before the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the Erecting Juſtices of the Peace; But this ſeems a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring what was before, rather than an Alteration of what was, ſince it was nothing but what was actually put in Practice
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0554400100:596"/>
twice before, and what there were Laws then in Being to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify their Return. So all the Alterations that ſeem to be made now, were, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Only that the Juſtices of Peace formerly had their Commiſſion from the Privy Council in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but now received it from the Lord Chancellor of <hi>Britain</hi>—; And, <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> That the Juſtices of Peace had ſome new Powers veſted in them ſince the Union, which they had not before, ſuch as determining Diſputes in the Duty of Exciſe, giving Power of Diſtreſs for Payment, Warrants of Forcible Entries, in caſe of Concealments of Cuſtoms, and the like.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>All the reſt of the Laws of <hi>Scotland</hi> remained the ſame <hi>per</hi> the Union; The Circuits of the Lords of the Juſticiary I take alſo to be no Innovation at all, as what had formerly been practiſed.</p>
               <p>I come now to Alterations of Trade; And theſe can receive but a very ſhort Deſcription here, becauſe the greateſt Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations which happened in Trade, could not follow the Union ſo cloſs at the Heels, as the Time of the Writing theſe Sheets require to relate it; But ſuch as were immediately the Conſequence of the Union, were ſuch as theſe,<list>
                     <item>1. A general Prohibition and Stop of Commerce with <hi>France,</hi> which, till now, <hi>Scotland</hi> publickly carryed on.</item>
                     <item>2. A Prohibition of all Exports and Imports as in <hi>England;</hi> And by virtue of that Clauſe, a particular Prohibition of the Exportation of Wool, which was, till then, publickly allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and which, tho' People ſeemed at firſt very uneaſy at, yet was, without Doubt, very much for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Advantage of <hi>Scotland,</hi> whoſe Manufactures were thereby quite ſunk as to Exportation—; This Article was attended with Penalties and Forfeitures particular, and ſuch as were not practiſed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and for which the Laws of Exciſe and Cuſtoms in <hi>England</hi> were introduced, and the Trials on which were brought on, either before the Juſtices of Peace, or Court of Exchequer, as above.</item>
                     <item>3. Whereas <hi>Scotland</hi> had, before this, prohibited all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woollen Manufactures, under ſevere Penalties, and <hi>England,</hi> on the other Hand, had excluded the <hi>Scots</hi> from Trading with <hi>Scots</hi> Ships to their Colonies in <hi>America,</hi> directly from <hi>Scotland,</hi> and had Confiſcated even their own <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships Trading to the ſaid Colonies from <hi>England,</hi> if Navigat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or Manned with above one Third <hi>Scots</hi> Seamen, had laid Tolls and heavy Impoſts upon Cattel and Linen Imported into <hi>England</hi> from <hi>Scotland,</hi> and had prohibited the Exportation of Corn from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Scotland,</hi> tho' the Occaſion of it might be never ſo great, but on the ſame Conditions, and under the ſame Reſtrictions as to other Countries; Now, by the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, all theſe Prohibitions, Reſtraints, Tolls, Impoſts, and Excluſions on either Hand, were taken off; The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Growth and Manufactures, formerly prohibited, came immediately, free of all Interruptions into <hi>Scotland;</hi> All the Tolls and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſts
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0554400100:597"/>
upon <hi>Scots</hi> Cattel, Linen, or other Goods in <hi>England,</hi> were taken off; All the Ports of <hi>England,</hi> whether in <hi>Europe</hi> or <hi>America,</hi> were open to <hi>Scots</hi> Ships, without any Impoſts or Reſtraint; <hi>Scots</hi> Sailers in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bottoms were immediately free, and Ships from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonies might Sail to, and Unlade free in <hi>Scotland,</hi> without any Obſtruction.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe I call Alterations in the Laws of Trade; Beſides which, there were ſome particular Alterations which relate to the Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backs, Bounties, and Allowances on the Exportation, and for Encouragement of the Exportation of Fiſh, Corn, Pork, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of which I need ſay nothing, having been very particular already in the Relation of the Debates upon thoſe Heads in Parliament.</p>
               <p>The Conſequences of theſe Things upon Trade are at preſent few, but will neceſſarily be far greater hereafter—; The firſt viſible Conſequence was the Riſe and Fall of ſeveral kinds of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes, as the new Alterations, Prohibitions, or Importations of them happened, differing from what they were before.</p>
               <p>As for Example, Wines, Brandy, and all kinds of Goods of the Growth of <hi>France,</hi> muſt of Courſe riſe in their Value, the further Import being prohibited; And this would have enrich'd a great many Families in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who had Quantities of theſe Goods on their Hands, had not the Difficulty of Enforcing theſe Prohibitions at firſt laid Trade open to Clandeſtine Importations, by which the Fair Trader was, as in ſuch Caſes always happens, a very great Sufferer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> All the Goods of the Growth of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonies, or which were to be had from <hi>England,</hi> being now Imported directly to <hi>Scotland,</hi> began to come as the Return of the <hi>Scots</hi> Manufactures—; Several Ships being laden from <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> the very firſt Year after the Union.</p>
               <p>Another Conſequence of this Union in Trade, was the letting fall almoſt all the Woollen Manufactures, which had been erected in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and where they began to come to ſome Perfection in making Broad Cloth, Druggets, and Stuffs of all ſorts; But, upon the Opening the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trade, they were immediately ſo Throng'd with <hi>Engliſh</hi> Goods of the ſame ſorts ſo much cheaper, that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared thoſe Things would die of Courſe.</p>
               <p>Tho' indeed this ſeemed to be ſome Blow to their Trade, and particularly to the Imployment of their Poor, yet, at the ſame time, the Duties upon Linen from <hi>Scotland</hi> being taken off in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> made ſo great a Demand for <hi>Scots</hi> Linen more than uſual, that it ſeemed the Poor could want no Imployment; And ſeveral kinds of Linen being ſet to Work by <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men, which never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were made, or at leaſt for Exportation in <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſuch as Sail-Cloths, Canvas, Damask, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is thought, the Imployment of the Poor was not leſſened by this Alteration.</p>
               <p>On the other Hand, the Lower and Courſer Manufactures in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which were made of their own Wool, ſeemed to increaſe, and not only found a larger Vent in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but were bought up
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0554400100:598"/>
by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants, who brought other Stuffs thither, and ſold in <hi>England;</hi> And theſe Manufactures are not unlikely to riſe to a conſiderable Height, ſuch as <hi>Stirling</hi> Serges, in <hi>England</hi> called <hi>Shaloons, Muſſelburgh</hi> Stuffs, and the like; And we find in <hi>England</hi> ſome Propoſals from the <hi>African</hi> Company, for the making <hi>Guinea</hi> Stuffs there, which perhaps may in time come to be very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
               <p>I might enter here into the Schemes and Projects, which have made much Noiſe in the World for Improvement of Fiſhing in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and of Navigation and building Ships in <hi>Scotland;</hi> But as theſe things have yet made no Alterations in the Trade, and are but in <hi>Embrio</hi> at the Writing theſe Sheets, I cannot mingle them here as Matter of Hiſtory, but have touch'd them more at large in the Preface.</p>
               <p>It remains only to ſpeak of the Alterations of the Cuſtoms—; And this would have required a long Table of the ſeveral Duties and Impoſt formerly paid in <hi>Scotland</hi> upon the Export and Import of Merchandizes—; But having already given an Account, That the whole Cuſtoms are ſettled upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Foot; And the Duties of all Kinds being too large to inſert here, and already Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Book of Rates, Re-printed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> it would be a Vain Labour to recite the Particulars: And as to the Difference between the Duties on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Foot, and the Duties as paid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it required the very ſame Recital of Particulars, the Length of which would be intolerable; And for this Reaſon, tho' I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to ſome Schemes ſaid to be in the ſecond part of this <hi>Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix,</hi> and which I received from the Cuſtom-Houſe in <hi>Scotland,</hi> yet when I came to find upon Examination, that the Tackſmen of the Cuſtoms in <hi>Scotland</hi> uſually compounded with the Merchants, and reduced the ſaid Cuſtoms to what Sum they pleaſed, I choſe to omit a Scheme, which, when put down, would give the Reader no certain Gueſs at the Thing, and conſequently ſignify no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>If any Man ſhould enquire, Whether, upon the whole of theſe Alterations in Trade, <hi>Scotland</hi> is Gainer or Loſer, I muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, it is a difficult Point to reſolve at ſo ſmall a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Finiſhing the Union; But, as to the Profit of the Trade between <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England</hi> in particular, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears at the Writing theſe Sheets, I ſhall leave the Impartial Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver to gueſs by theſe Two Particulars.<list>
                     <item>1. That about Seventeen Ships from the ſeveral Ports of <hi>Scotland</hi> are already fitted out, and ſent away to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonies, whoſe Loading is certainly the Product of the Ground, or Labour of the Poor, and whoſe Return muſt be in Sugar, Tobacco, Cotton, Indico, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Money—.</item>
                     <item>2. That above 170000 Bolls of Corn of ſundry ſorts has already been Shipped off from <hi>Scotland</hi> for <hi>England,</hi> beſides a very great Quantity bought up by <hi>England,</hi> and Shipp'd di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly for <hi>Portugal;</hi> Both theſe Articles are Additions to the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0554400100:599"/>
Trade of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and both within little more than a Year immediately ſucceeding the Union of the Iſland: What fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Encreaſe of Commerce may accrue to <hi>Scotland,</hi> when theſe Bloody Wars ſhall end, and when Peace ſhall be reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Europe,</hi> I ſhall not pretend to Examine; But there ſeems to be no Queſtion, but the Trade of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſtands fair for very great Improvements.</item>

                                 <p n="1">1. The Commiſſion of the <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> having already Addreſt to the Parliament for Securing the Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and Government of this Church; And that Addreſs being read in the Houſe upon the 17<hi>th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> laſt, The Parliament did thereupon Declare, that before concluding the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, they would take the ſaid Addreſs to their Conſideration, and would do every Thing neceſſary for ſecuring the true Proteſtant Religion and Church Government preſently by Law eſtabliſhed in this Kingdom; Which Aſſurance we conceive the Commiſſion may very well rely u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, Seeing it is not to be doubted, that the Parliament will in due Time when the Addreſs is taken to Conſideration, make all neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Proviſions for Securing our Religion and Church Government by Law eſtabliſhed; And it may be conſtructed Jealousie or Diffidence in this Commiſſion to preſs and purſue the ſaid Addreſs further, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0554400100:616"/>
it appear what Steps and Progreſs the Parliament ſhall make u<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pon it, Eſpecially ſeeing there are ſo many Elders of this Commiſſion who are Members of the Houſe: And being heartily Concerned for the Churches Intereſt, will certainly take Care that Nothing be Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted or forgot to be Repreſented in Parliament which is Neceſſary for the Churches Security.</p>
                                 <p n="2">2. The Parliament having upon the 15<hi>th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> laſt, Voted to proceed preſently to the Conſideration of the Articles of the Treaty of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, which might be Known to all by the publiſhed Minutes, We conceive it not Decent or ſuitable to the Prudence of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to preſent an new Addreſs Relating to the Subject of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: whereby the Houſe may be impeded in its Procedure, which may cauſe a longer Delay of Conſidering the firſt Addreſs by Occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning new Queſtions and Debates in the Houſe.</p>
                                 <p n="3">3. The 6<hi>th</hi> Article of the now intended Addreſs, contains Matters which we conceive are not within the Sphere and Compaſs of the Commiſſions Buſineſs preſcribed to them by the <hi>General Aſſembly.</hi> Yet a wide Step is made in quarrelling and Objecting to the Conſtitution of the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> the Repreſentative of that Nation, with which this is now in a Treaty about an Union, likeways in that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle the Form and Frame of the Civil Policy and Government of <hi>England,</hi> in the Extent and Latitude of it, Agreeable to it's Laws is Reflected upon and Challenged; all which in our Opinion, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuates a Blaming and Condemning our Parliament for Treating of an Union with a Kingdom ſo Circumſtantiated as <hi>England</hi> is.</p>
                                 <p n="4">4. Whatever the Conſtitution of the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> now is, and whatever may be the Conſtitution of the Parliament of <hi>Great Britain</hi> after the Union, the preſent legal Eſtabliſhment of our Church is not alterable by it, that being without the bounds of the Treaty, which can reach no farther than the Civil Policy and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the United Kingdom; Beſides that our legal Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will no doubt be further Fenced and Fortified, when the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions Addreſs is taken into Conſideration by the Parliament.</p>
                                 <p n="5">5. The Parliament having upon the fourth of this Month, Voted that the two Kingdoms of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> ſhall upon the firſt Day of <hi>May</hi> next Enſuing, and for ever after be <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited into one Kingdom by the Name of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> with this Proviſion (That if the Articles of Union be not adjuſted by the Parliament, then the Agreeing to and Approving of the firſt ſhall be of no Effect) We Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it may be of Dangerous Conſequence to preſent now any Addreſs which may Admit of a Conſtruction oppoſite to that Vote in Parliament; And certainly it would not be Excuſeable in any who are Members in the Houſe, to concurr in an Addreſs of that ſort.</p>
                                 <p>So being fully perſwaded that the way of proceeding by the New Addreſs now intended, will tend to the great Diſadvantage and Prejudice of the Church as now Eſtabliſhed, and of the Presbyterian Intereſt, we found our ſelves obliged to Enter our Diſſent and to Proteſt.</p>

                              <p>YOur Letter ſigned by the R: Mr. <hi>Carſtairs</hi> Moderator <hi>pro tem Pore</hi> we received this Day, being our firſt Meeting after its Date of the 6th Inſtant; wherein there is mention of your being informed of Diſorders and Tumults in ſome parts of the Countrey, which you recommend unto us to diſcountenance and diſcoursge as we have Acceſs.</p>
                              <p>We know there have been many Reports ſpread Abroad of Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults and Diſorders, not only in <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> which is too true, but in other places within the Shire of <hi>Lanerk;</hi> which as to the bounds of our Presbytery are groſly falſe. And we have reaſon to believe them to be ſo likewiſe, as to the reſt of the Shire. We have heard alſo of ſome calumnious Stories induſtriouſly diſſeminated, concerning ſome of our Number, with reſpect to theſe pretended Diſorders, which are not only contrary to Truth, but to common Senſe. We wiſh the Forgers and Spreaders may be forgiven. They act in this neither the part of good Chriſtians, nor of good Subjects.</p>
                              <p>As to the Diſpoſition of the People, the plain Truth is, That they are generally moſt averſe from the Union; and many have expreſſed themſelves broadly enough againſt it, as what they fear may prove an irremediable Evil, if it ſhould be concluded, wiſhing that ſome Stop might be put to it. And we have not been wanting, as there was occaſion, to adviſe and exhort the People to Calmneſs and Regularity, and to refrain from any undue Keenneſs might be in their Words. But we muſt ſay, That it is utterly falſe and malicious to ſuggeſt, that there hath been the leaſt Tumult or irregular Practice among them, ſince this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion came in Queſtion, far leſs any ſhadow or Appearance of any Undutiful or Diſloyal Thought of Her Majeſty. Yea there has not been ſo much as the leaſt Motion towards their accuſtomed ordinary Rendezvous warranted by Law, ſince the publiſhing of a Proclamation and Act, forbidding the ſame: It is true, That ſome of thoſe Raſh Youths who broke out from <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> paſſed thro' our Bounds, but they were not allowed to make any ſtay, nor received the leaſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement at any Hand, for ought we know: So that we can well aſſure the R. Commiſſion, there is as much Peace and Quiet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the whole Bounds of this Presbytery, as is any Place of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                              <p>We have heard with much Satisfaction, of the Zeal which the R.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0554400100:626"/>
Commiſſion hath ſhewed by their Addreſses mentioned in your Letter for the Intereſts of the Church at this Time, when they are in ſo E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Hazard. And we have teſtified our Concurrence therewith by our Addreſs to the Parliament: But we are ſtill of Opinion, That the preſſing Neceſſity of the preſent Juncture, and the manifeſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility (in the Event of ſuch an Union, as is Moulded in the Treaty) of ſecuring this Church in any of Her precious Concerns, now Eſtabliſhed by the Laws and Conſtitution of our own Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Kingdom, doth not only require the Continuance of Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous Application to the Right Honourable Eſtates of Parliament: But likewiſe, that the Commiſſion, in Name of this Church, teſtify a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the concluding of any <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with <hi>England,</hi> upon the Foot of this Treaty, till the General Aſſembly of this National Church, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Her undoubted Right, as we have ſhewed in our Addreſs be called and Allowed to conſider of Solid and Eſſential Securities for the Church in ſuch an Exigence. This we humbly think, the Truſt repoſed in the Commiſſion, and Faithfulneſs to the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> both in the preſent and ſucceeding Generations doth unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyably Demand. Thus heartily Recommending you to Divine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and Aſſiſtance. We reſt</p>

And whereas they are at preſent 160 in Number, they are by this Article, reduced to 16; which 16 are to be joyned with the Houſe of Lords in <hi>England,</hi> whoſe Number at preſent conſiſts of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 180, whereby it is plain, that the <hi>Scots</hi> Peers ſhare in the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and Judicative Powers in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament is very unequal with that of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> tho the one be Repreſentatives of as Free and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent a Nation as the other; and is therefore a plain Forfeiture of the Peerage of this Kingdom. And as it is the hight of Injuſtice, and againſt all the Laws and Practices of this and all other well govern'd Nations to forfeit any Perſon without a hainous Crime; So its againſt all Law to forfeit either the Peers that are now preſent, or thoſe that are Minors or Abſent, without being ſo much as called or cited for that end.</p>
                        <p>It is likewiſe contrary to the Honour and true Intereſt of Her Majeſty and the Monarchy, to ſuppreſs the Eſtate of Peers, who have formerly been the great Supporters of the Monarchy.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="71" facs="tcp:0554400100:670"/>
And it is Diſhonourable and Diſgraceful to this Kingdom, that the Peers thereof ſhall only have Rank and Precedency next after the Peers of the like Order and Degree in <hi>England,</hi> without regard to their Antiquity, or the Dates of their Patents, as is ſtipulate by the following Articles of this Treaty.</p>
                        <p>In the next place, each Shire and Royal Burgh within this Kingdom have the Number of their Repreſentatives determined by Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whoſe Number at preſent being 155, are by this Article of the Treaty, reduced to 45, and to be joyned to 513 Members in the Houſe of Commons, where they can have no Influence, by reaſon of the vaſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion of their Numbers, beſides, that the Barons and Burrows of this Nation, by this way of Uniting, are deprived of their inherent Right of being fully and individually repreſented in Parliament, both with relation to their legiſlative and judicative Capacities.</p>
                        <p>And they are not only highly prejudged in leſſening their Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but alſo degraded from being Members of the Parliaments of this Kingdom, where they ſit as Judges in all Cauſes Civil and Criminal, to be joyned to the Commons of another Nation, who are accuſtomed to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate for Juſtice at the Bar of the Houſe of Lords.</p>
                        <p>The Barons and Burgeſſes are alſo further prejudged in this; That whereas every Shire and Royal Burgh have their own Repreſentatives, one Commiſſioner will hereafter repreſent ſeveral Shires or Burghs, who it cannot be ſuppoſed will underſtand the ſeveral Intereſts and Concerns of the ſaid ſeveral Shires and Burghs whom he may repreſent.</p>
                        <p>And further, for the preſent Repreſentatives of the Barons and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes to offer, by any Vote or Deed of theirs, to incapacitate their Conſtituents, or deprive them of any part of their inherent Right, is what their Conſtituents may and do juſtly diſſallow, they only having their Commiſſions with the ordinary Powers of making and amending Laws, and giving Supplys, but no ways to alter Fundamental Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or to take away or diminiſh their Repreſentation, which is alſo a plain Forfeiture of their Conſtituents of their inherent Rights and undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Privileges, and is contrary to the fundamental Laws of this Nation, which are the Birth-right of the People thereof.</p>
                        <p>From all which it is plain and evident, That this, from a Sovereign In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Monarchy, ſhall diſſolve its Conſtitution, and be at the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe Conſtitution is not in the leaſt to be altered by this Treaty, and where it is not to be ſuppoſed the <hi>Scots</hi> ſhall have any weight in the making of Laws, even tho' relative to their own Kingdom, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the vaſt Diſproportion and Diſparity of the Repreſentation afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>
                        <p>And therefore I do alſo Proteſt, that no Vote may hinder or prejudge the Noblemen, Barons and Burgeſſes, as now repreſented in Parliament, to Retain, Bruik, Enjoy and Exerce all their Rights, Liberties and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, as fully and freely as hitherto they have enjoyed them.</p>
                        <p>And ſince it evidently appears, not only from the many Proteſts of the Honourable and Worthy Members of this Houſe, but alſo from the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Addreſſes and Petitions, from the ſeveral Parts of this Kingdom, of the Barons, Free-holders, Heretors, Burgeſſes and Commons, and from the Commiſſion of the General Aſſembly, that there is a general Diſlike and Averſion from the Incorporating Union, as contained in theſe Articles; And that there is not one Addreſs, from any part of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in favours of this Union.</p>
                        <p>I do therefore further proteſt againſt concluding this and the following
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0554400100:671"/>
Articles of this Treaty, until HerMajeſty ſhall be fully informed of the In clinations of the People; That if HerMajeſty think fit, She may call a new Parliament to have immediate Sentiments of the Union ſince the Articles have been made publick, where it's hoped they may fall on ſuch Methods as may allay the Ferment of the Nation, ſatisfie the Minds of the People, and create a full Underſtanding betwixt the two Kingdoms, by an Union upon honourable, juſt and equal Terms, which may unite them in Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Intereſt, the ſureſt Foundation of Peace and Tranquility for both Kingdoms: And this my Proteſtation I deſire may be received, and inſert in the Minutes, and recorded in the Books of Parliament, as a Teſtimony of my Diſaſſent, and the Diſaſſent of ſuch as adhere to me.</p>

                  <p>And a Third Proteſt was given in by the Earl of <hi>Buchan,</hi> in theſe Terms.<q>
                        <p>FOrasmuch as, the changing of the Right of the Peers of this Realm, from a conſtant and hereditary Right, to one that is elective; and the debarring all or any of them from taking place, and voting in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, Conventions, or publick Councils, is ſubverſive of the Birth-right, and undoubted Privilege of the Peers, diſhonourable to the whole Kingdom, and contrary to the fundamental Laws and Conſtitutions of it; as well as to all Juſtice and Equity: I do therefore Proteſt for my ſelf, and in Name of all who ſhall adhere to this my Proteſtation, that the foreſaid Right of the Peers of this Realm to Sit and Vote in all Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, publick Councils and Conventions, do, after the intended Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with <hi>England,</hi> and notwithſtanding thereof, continue in full Force, and remain to them as their undoubted Right and Property, and that no Vote to be paſſed in this Houſe, do prejudge all or any of them thereof, or debar them from retaining the ſame in all time coming.</p>

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0554400100:676"/>
two Kingdoms, Ratified in both their Parliaments, have from ſeveral Ports of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſent to <hi>London,</hi> and ſeveral Ports in <hi>England</hi> Goods and Merchandize allowed to be imported to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and actually there im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported before the Union, for which they not only paid Your Majeſties Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; But being reſolved upon the Faith of the ſaid Treaty to ſend them to <hi>England,</hi> after due Deliberation, they by Warrant from <hi>England</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Coaſt-Cocquets and other ordinary Documents from Your Majeſtys Commiſſioners of the Cuſtoms lately eſtabliſhed, and did alſo to cut off all pretext, make faith before the Lords of Your Majeſties Treaſury and Exchequer, and other Judges, That the Goods were imported upon their own proper Account, and upon their own proper Riſque.</p>
                              <p>Notwithſtanding whereof, they have very ſurpriſing Accounts from their Correſpondents in <hi>England,</hi> that the Commiſſioners of Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Cuſtoms there, have given Orders to ſeize their Ships and Goods, and that ſome of them are actually ſeized, and others both ſeized and imbezzelled, and that the beſt Conditions they can obtain from Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties ſaid Commiſſioners in <hi>England,</hi> are; That they ſhould give Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity or Bail in ſome caſes for Ship and Cargo, and in other Caſes, for paying new and high Duties, at the Determination of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: All which being in our humble Apprehenſion nothing agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but contrary to the Faith of the ſaid Articles of Treaty, and a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt Diſappointment of theſe Advantages and Encouragements that we ſtill did, and do firmly promiſe our ſelves from Your Majeſties Royal Juſtice and moſt gracious Government, and with all ſuch viſible Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips as muſt be the Loſs and even the Ruin of many honeſt Traders, who cannot bear their Ships and Goods to be thus incumbred by Bail and Law-ſuits, or double and high Duties, and withal ſubjected to the Delay and Hazard of uncertain Determination.</p>
                              <p>We cannot but in the greateſt Submiſſion whereof we are capable, and with a yet greater Confidence of Your Majeſties Royal Juſtice and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whereof we have had ſo great and innumerable Proofs, lay the Caſe before Your Majeſty as it is, <hi>viz.</hi> That by the firſt Article of the Treaty of Union, the two Kingdoms are for ever united into one after the firſt of <hi>May</hi> laſt, which plainly after that day excludes the very Notion of Importation, or Importers betwixt them, and all former Reſtrictions and Penalties impoſed thereupon: And by the Fourth Article, It is agreed that all the Subjects of the ſaid united Kingdom ſhall from and after the Union, have full Freedom and Intercourſe of Trade to and from any Port or Place within the ſaid united Kingdom, and that there be a Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of all other Rights and Privileges which do or may belong to the Subjects of either Kingdom; By which it is plain, that we have the ſame Privilege to tranſport our Effects notwithſtanding of former Reſtraints from one part of <hi>Britain</hi> to another, which Your Majeſties Subjects of <hi>Berwick, Newcaſtle, Briſtol,</hi> &amp;c. do injoy in importing now to <hi>Scotland,</hi> without any Comptrol all ſuch Goods both of <hi>Engliſh</hi> and Foreign Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture and Growth, as were before the Union expreſly prohibite by our Laws: And farther, by the 25 and laſt Article of the ſaid Treaty, It is by <hi>Statute Enacted,</hi> that all Laws and Statutes in either Kingdom, ſo far as they are contrary to, and inconſiſtent with the Articles of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, ſhall from and after the Union ceaſe and become void; Whereby it evidently appears, that the Prohibitions and Reſtrictions that might have been of Force on either ſide, while we were ſeparate Kingdoms, are now made void and for ever to ceaſe.</p>
                              <p>Being then founded upon ſuch clear and evident Grounds, and yet much more upon the aſſuring Experiences that we have always had of

                              <p>BY the Articles of UNION moſt ſolemnly ratified in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> It is expreſly declar'd, That from and after the firſt of <hi>May</hi> 1707, the two Kingdoms ſhall be United into one, called <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and that all the Subjects of either Kingdom, ſhall have full Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Intercourſe of Trade and Navigation, to and from any Port or Place within the ſaid united Kingdom; and that there ſhall be a Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of all other Rights, Privileges and Advantages, which do or may belong to the Subjects of either Kingdom:</p>
                              <p>It is humbly conceived, that the Bill now before your Lordſhips, is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary to theſe Articles of Union; for nothing can be a greater hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance to the Freedom and Intercourſe of Trade, than the laying ſuch high Duties on Goods brought from <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> as are by this Bill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be impos'd on Her Majeſty's <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects, and the <hi>Scots</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding here, whereby they are deprived of their juſt Right of bringing Goods from <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Tranſire</hi> Duty free, which is plainly granted to them by the fourth Article of Union, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>The Exception in this Bill pretended to be in favour of the Natives of <hi>Scotland</hi> reſiding there, deſtroys their Privileges alſo; becauſe it only al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows them to bring ſuch Goods Duty free into <hi>England</hi> after the Union com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mences, as have been before that time laden beyond Seas, and imported into <hi>Scotland</hi> on their own Accounts, but not to bring any ſuch as they have bought, or may buy at their own Markets, whereby this Retroſpect Bill will ſtop the Circulation of Trade, and entail Ruin on all the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders

in <hi>Scotland,</hi> by confining ſuch Quantities of Goods to that part of <hi>Great Britain</hi> as will exceed the Conſumption thereof.</p>

                              </p>
                              <p>And a particular Hardſhip to the <hi>Scots,</hi> the Bill impoſes on them the unſupportable <hi>onus probandi,</hi> whereby they will be oblig'd to prove their ſole Property from the time of buying the Goods beyond Seas, to their Arrival in <hi>England,</hi> in order whereto their Factors, Mariners, Coopers, Ware-houſe-keepers, Porters, and a great number of other Servants muſt be all produced together at the Exchequer Bar, and all maintain'd during their Voyages and Journeys, and Abode in <hi>London;</hi> ſo that the Evidence neceſſary on this occaſion will coſt at leaſt 300 <hi>l. Sterling</hi> for each parcel of Goods, beſides all the Delay and Vexation of a tedious Courſe of Law, and the ſevere Penalties in caſe they ſhould, by one Neglect or Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, fail in the leaſt Particular of an abſolute Proof.</p>
                              <p>This Bill will not anſwer the propos'd End of advancing Her Majeſties Revenues, but ſeems to be founded on miſtaken Notions of Trade, ſince after the Union commences, the Diſadvantages, or Conveniencies to <hi>Great Britain</hi> will be equal, whether the Goods then in <hi>Scotland</hi> remain, and be conſum'd in that, or any other part of the United Kingdom.</p>
                              <p>The Allowances granted in ſome Articles of the Union, whereby the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation of minute Circumſtances is left to the Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> ſeems to be an unanſwerable Argument, that where no ſuch Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty is given, even the Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> was not intended to have the Power of making any Alterations or Regulations; and as the laſt Article of the Union confirms the whole by repealing all Laws in either Kingdom, which are contrary to the Articles, This Bill, if it ſhould paſs into an act, and all other Laws being inconſiſtent with the Articles, of any of them, will, as it's humbly conceived, be void after the Firſt of <hi>May.</hi>

                  <p n="1">I. EQuity and Reaſon places the Subjects of the ſame Kingdom on equal Foot, when they are Cemented together in Affection, Laws, Trade, and Intereſt, this will be the Caſe after the Union, when Agreements on each ſide are fulfilled; but when <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> were ſeparate, they who ſubmitted, propoſed the Terms, and Equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents of an Union; and when theſe are granted, and agreed, ſhould be honourably maintained, with the greateſt Nicety, and favourable Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation to the Weakeſt. The Reputation of <hi>England</hi> abroad, is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Stability of their Treaties, ss much as on the Strength of their Arms, Treaſure, or Conſtitution.</p>
                  <p>With the ſame Strength of Reaſon and Equity, may the <hi>Scots</hi> deſire that <hi>Engliſh-</hi>Men, ſince <hi>February</hi> laſt, ſhould be ſubject to the <hi>Onus Probandi,</hi> for Goods in their Poſſeſſion, imported by Foreigners, or for Account of Foreigners under Covert.</p>
                  <p>By the ſame Rule of Reaſon, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> require an Augmentation of Duties on Goods imported into <hi>England,</hi> may the <hi>Scots</hi> deſire that Goods in <hi>England</hi> ſhould be Taxed with <hi>Scots</hi> Duties, and then both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms would be on equal Terms.</p>
                  <p>The Eſtabliſhment of the Union, was a Communicatory Contract, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed and fixt, by Perſons equal in Knowledge, and Freedom of Will; the Matter in Debate was Propoſed, Argued, and Covenanted, afterwards Confirmed in the moſt Solemn and Authentick Manner, by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of both Kingdoms, and cannot now legally, and in a decent or friendly Manner, be touched or amended in any oint, but by the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> who are the competent Judges of the Rights, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, and Conveniencies of the United Kingdoms, when the general Good, Safety and Intereſt of the whole, will, with it's natural Weight, ſway the Ballance of Equity, when <hi>England</hi> will have no Reaſon to repine at any accidental Advantage, which <hi>Scotland</hi> may get by the Union, at it's Commencement, ſince it will not only enable, but encourage that Part of the United Kingdom, to undergo with Chearfulneſs their future Reſtrictions, and Taxes.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. To the Second Reaſon the Anſwer is plainly obvious, that the Sixth, Seventh, Fifteenth, and Eighteenth Articles of the Union, were conſented to by <hi>Scotland,</hi> in Conſideration of an Equivalent, and the Senſe of the Commiſſioners, on the Point of Cuſtoms, is more fully explained in the Fourteenth Article of Union, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                     <q rend="inline">'That the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhall not be charged with any Duties laid on by the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> before the Union, except theſe conſented to in this Treaty.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Certainly the <hi>Scots</hi> never expected, that in the Interval between the Ratification of the Articles, and the Commencement of the Union, the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> would have laid the <hi>Onus Probandi</hi> upon the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0554400100:681"/>
Subjects of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and for a time ſo far backward, nor that a greater Proof for the Property of Goods, ſhould be required from the Subjects of <hi>Scotland,</hi> than what is ſtipulated for juſtifying their Intereſt in Shipping, by the Fifth Article of Union, by which they are free from all perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tryals at the Exchequer Barr, and are treated therein as Friends, and Men of Probity, by referring the Proof of their Intereſt, to their proper Oath, to be taken in the Port next to the abode of the Owner; this ſhows that the <hi>Scots</hi> never would have conſented to undergo the <hi>Onus probandi</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> for any Goods in their Poſſeſſion, belonging to them, at or before the Union.</p>
                  <p>It was abſolutely impoſſible to attain this Union, without a free Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of Trade; and in Conſequence, as abſolutely Impoſſible to hinder the <hi>Scots</hi> from Trading; as <hi>Scotſ-men,</hi> in their own Kingdom, until the Union commences; or from trading afterwards, as <hi>Britains,</hi> when the Union takes place. To deny them the firſt Privilege, is to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their Birth-right; and to debar them from the latter Advantage, would be a grievous Detriment, and a ſenſible Injury; becauſe it touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es their Property at preſent, and weakens their Hopes of Advantage in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by the Union: At leaſt it will make them think their Title preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and uncertain.</p>
                  <p>After the firſt of <hi>May</hi> 1707, when the Union is to commence, the Goods then brought from <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>vice verſa</hi> can't in any Senſe be ſaid to be either Exported or Imported; ſeeing, whether by Land or Water, they will only be carried from one place to another, within the ſame Kingdom: And therefore this Matter can no ways be comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded under the Sixth Article.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. To the Third Reaſon, That the fair Traders of <hi>England</hi> will be great Sufferers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It may be anſwer'd, That a certain ſort of fair Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, commonly diſtinguiſh'd by the Character of well-meaning F—s, are greater Sufferers daily, by the cunning Contrivances of Stock-Jobbers, and other over-reaching Practices in Commerce, they would not cenſure a Man, who can take up Money at 4 <hi>per Cent.</hi> from private Perſons, and at the ſame time can lend it to the Government at 8 <hi>per Cent.</hi> If by the fair Traders, be meant the Wine Merchants or Vintners, thoſe who know their Method of Management, will admire how they have gain'd this Character: Allowing it, however, to them for once, in Complaiſance, their Damage will be as ſoon forgot, as the Loſs of a Ship is on the Exchange; and their Loſs will be recompenſed by a publick Advantage, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens but once, and will be of very ſhort Continuance. The Nobility and Gentry of <hi>England</hi> may drink the Queens Health, and Proſperity to the Union, in a Glaſs of Claret, at 2 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d. per</hi> Quart; on which the beſt of the Nation ſaves 2 <hi>s.</hi> ſeeing the Vintner ſells his mixt Liquor at 4 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> The <hi>Scots</hi> Merchant or Importer from <hi>Scotland</hi> cannot gain nor ſave by his Sale, one fourth part of what the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation does; and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion will hold the ſame, upon whatever Quantities of Goods are Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported from <hi>Scotland,</hi> if it were poſſible, to the value of a Million of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. The Nation of <hi>England,</hi> in this Time of Jubilee, will be by far the greateſt Gainer. If the ſole Profit redounds wholly to the <hi>Scots</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, or to the Importers from <hi>Scotland,</hi> then the Price of Goods will be kept at their preſent Height, and the fair Traders of <hi>England</hi> cannot loſe by the Stocks of Goods now on their Hands.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. That the Revenue of the Cuſtoms will be very much diminiſhed, may be anſwered, That this is not a real loſs, but accidental and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary: For without the Union and Freedom of Commerce, thoſe Goods
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0554400100:682"/>
would not have been imported; and I am perſwaded, the Queen would rather loſe the Value of the Goods imported, than ſuffer the Foundation of the Union to be undermined, or Her Subjects in <hi>Scotland</hi> to undergo Hardſhips, from which, in virtue of this Union, they may ſo reaſonably expect an Exemption. And I believe, all Her Majeſties Friends, and Well-wiſhers to <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> will cordially praiſe Her Sentiments, and readily concur in ſuſpecting the Aſſertions of ſome Gentlemen, as to the Quantities of Goods expected from <hi>Scotland.</hi> Theſe very Perſons would not be afraid of finding Money, in a Days time, to purchaſe the whole at prime Coſt, and to put themſelves in place of the <hi>Scots:</hi> Then they would cry up the Union as ſacred, as the firmeſt Foundation of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and would ſeverely cenſure the leaſt Encroachment.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. To the Fifth and moſt important Reaſon, The Promoters of the Bill are great Men in their way, but in Compariſon with <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> like two Drops of Water to the Ocean; and in their greateſt Splendour are only valuable ſo far, as they are uſeful to the Common Good; it's humbly conceiv'd, every prudent Man will conclude, it's better to let a few Men grumble, than to diſguſt a Kingdom, and the beſt of Queens, by endangering the Conſtitution of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>

We intend not to diſherit your Queen, but to make Her Heirs Inheritors alſo of <hi>England.</hi> WE SEEK NOT TO TAKE FROM YOU YOUR LAWS NOR CUSTOMS, but we ſeek to redreſs your Oppreſſion, which of divers ye do ſuſtain. In the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Laws and Cuſtoms be according to the antient uſage thereof, and likewiſe <hi>France, Normandy</hi> and <hi>Gaſcoigne</hi> have ſundry kind of Orders. Have all the Realms and Dominions that the Emperor now hath, one Cuſtom and one Sort of Laws? Theſe vain Fears and Fantaſies of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion of your Nation, of changing of the Laws, of making a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, be driven into your Heads by thoſe, who indeed had rather you were all conquered, ſpoiled and ſlain, than they would loſe any Point of their Will, of their Deſire of Rule, and of their Eſtimation, which they know in Quietneſs would be ſeen what it were, as it were in a Calm Water—If we two being made one by Amity, be moſt able to defend us againſt all Nations; and having the Sea for the Wall, mutual Love for Gariſon, and GOD for Defence, ſhould make ſo Noble and well agreeing Monarchy, that neither in Peace we may be aſhamed, nor in War afraid of any Worldly or Foreign Power: Why ſhould not you be as deſireous of the ſame, and have as much Cauſe to rejoyce at it as we?—And for a more ſure Proof and plainer Token of the good Mind and Will which we bear unto you, that which never yet was granted to <hi>Scotland</hi> in any League, Truce or Peace betwixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> becauſe ye ſhall have Proof of the beginning of Love and Amity of both the Realms, the King's Highneſs conſidering the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of them which are come to His Majeſty's Devotion, and of them that be Well-willers and Aiders of this Godly Enterprize, hath by our Advice and Counſel granted, and by theſe preſents doth grant, that from hence-forth all manner of Merchants and other <hi>Scotſmen,</hi> who will enter their Names with one of the Wardens of the Marches, and there profeſs to take part with us, in this before named godly purpoſe, may lawfully, and without any Trouble and Vexation, enter into any Port, Creek or Haven of <hi>England,</hi> and there uſe their Traffick of Merchandize, buy and ſell, bring in the Commodities of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and take and carry forth the Commodities of <hi>England,</hi> as liberally and as freely, and with the ſame and none other Cuſtoms therefore, than <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> and the King's Subjects do at this preſent. <bibl>

                        <p>THE Commiſſioners being met at <hi>Weſtminster,</hi> the chief Things debat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on were, 1. Whether the two Kingdoms ſhould be united un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Name of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> And 2. Whether both Nations ſhould be equally capable of Honours and Offices in either Kingdom. Some advanc'd againſt the Firſt, That it was without all Example, that two Kingdoms equally ſupreme, ſhould lay aſide their former Names for a third new One: Nor could the Name of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> be ſo Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as the ſeveral Names and Pluralities of Kingdoms: Thus tho <hi>Caſtile, Leon</hi> and <hi>Arragon,</hi> be united under the Subjection of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Navarr</hi> under the <hi>French;</hi> yet theſe Kings alwiſe in their Deſignations mention the ſeveral Kingdoms they command.</p>
                        <p>Others alledg'd this ruight prejudice the Precedency of the Kings of <hi>England</hi> among other Princes; as being but a new one. But for all that, we find in Hiſtory, that this is no new thing; and in particular <hi>Livy</hi> reports, That the <hi>Trojans</hi> and <hi>Aborigines</hi> did after the Union of their Nations aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the common Name of <hi>Latines:</hi> Thus the <hi>Hungarians</hi> derived their Name from the <hi>Huni &amp; Avari (Morden in his Geography mentions the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors from whence we have it)</hi> The <hi>Catalonians</hi> from the <hi>Catti &amp; Albani:</hi> The Counties in <hi>Germany</hi> uſe that common Name: And that only is called <hi>Feudum novum</hi> which is acquired by Money, Donation or Conqueſt, and that <hi>Feudum antiquum</hi> which deſcends by Blood and Succeſſion.</p>
                        <p>When the 2<hi>d</hi> queſtion came under debate, ſome of the Commiſſioners agreed, it was unreaſonable the <hi>Scots</hi> ſhould be admitted to, and made capable of all the Employments in <hi>England.</hi> To this it was anſwered, That to refuſe it would continue the ancient Grudge and Enmity, for the <hi>Romans</hi> were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver engaged in a ſharper War, than in the <hi>Bellum ſociale,</hi> which the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> raiſed againſt them, becauſe they would not admit them to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls after they were united, (<hi>vide Livy, Plutarch, Florus,</hi> &amp;c.) After which the <hi>Romans</hi> did by their own Law Declare, That <hi>inter Concives &amp; Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipes, omnia munera debent eſſe communicata. Municipes enim ſunt qui pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter minera publica ſuſcipiunt.</hi> And <hi>Polybins</hi> in <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. ſpeaking of the Method whereby the <hi>Achaeans</hi> eſtabliſh'd their happy Union, (read alſo <hi>Plutarch</hi>) obſerves it to have been by this means.</p>
                        <p>This Privilege has been allowed the <hi>Scots</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> for the Earl of <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan</hi> was made Conſtable by <hi>Ch.</hi> the 7th, becauſe he defeated the Duke of <hi>Charence: Douglaſs</hi> was made Duke of <hi>Turaine; Aubigney Vice Roy</hi> of <hi>Naples.</hi> Count <hi>Leſly</hi> was preferred lately to be an Earl of the <hi>Empire,</hi> and ſtill in the Emperial Dyets. In <hi>England William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> confeſſes three <hi>Scots-Men</hi> were ſucceſſively created Arch-Biſhops of <hi>Tork,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Forth</hi> was in the late Wars the ſucceſsful General of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army.</p>
                        <p>King <hi>James</hi> thought this Debate encroach'd upon his Prerogative, and therefore deſired it might go no further; That tho by his Prerogative he might imploy Natives of either Kingdom as he pleaſed, yet he would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Subjects of the reſpective Kingdoms in their native Countries, till mutual Education and a laſting Union had fitted them to be indifferently employ'd, upon which Aſſurance all the Commiſſioners reſted, and ſo they proceeded to put theſe Concluſions in Form, and the Articles agreed upon were theſe.</p>
                        <p>It is agreed by the Commiſſioners of <hi>E.</hi> and S. to be mutually propoſed to the Parliaments of both Realms at the next Seſſion, that all
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0554400100:704"/>
Hoſtile Laws made and conceived expreſly, either by <hi>E.</hi> againſt <hi>S.</hi> or <hi>S.</hi> againſt <hi>E.</hi> ſhall in the next Seſſions be abrogated, and utterly extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                        <p>It is alſo agreed, That all Laws, Cuſtoms and Treaties of the Border betwixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhall be declared by a general Act to be abrogated and obliterated: And that the Subjects on either Part ſhall be governed by the Laws and Statutes of the Kingdoms where they dwell, and the Name of the <hi>Borders</hi> extinguiſhed.</p>
                        <p>And becauſe by aboliſhing the Border-Laws and Cuſtoms, it may be doubted, that the Executions ſhall ceaſe upon theſe Sentences that have heretofore been given by the oppoſite Officers of thoſe Borders, upon Wrongs committed before the Death of the late Queen of happy Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; It is therefore thought fit, That in caſe the Commiſſioners or Officers to be appointed by His Majeſty before the time of the next Seſſions of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, ſhall not procure ſufficient Redreſs of ſuch fyled Bills &amp; Sentences, that then the ſaid Parliament may be moved to take ſuch Order, as to their Wiſdoms ſhall ſeem convenient in ſatisfaction of that which has been decerned by ſome Officers. As alſo, how Diſorders and Inſolencies may be hereafter repreſſed, and the Country which was lately of the Borders kept in Peace and Quietneſs in time to come; As likewiſe to preſcribe ſome Orders how the Purſuits of former Wrongs preceeding the Death of the late Queen, and ſince the laſt Treaty of the Borders in the years 1596, and 1597, which have never as yet been moved, may be continued, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted to a definitive Sentence.</p>
                        <p>And foraſmuch as the next Degree to the Abolition of all Memory of Hoſtility, is the Participation of mutual Commodities and Commerce; It is agreed Firſt, concerning Importation of Merchandize into either Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alm from Foreign Parts; That whereas certain Commodities are wholly prohibited by the ſeveral Laws of both Realms to be brought into either of them by the Natives themſelves, or by any other, the ſaid Prohibitions ſhall now be made mutual to both, and neither an <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> bring into <hi>Scotland,</hi> or a <hi>Scotſ-man</hi> into <hi>England</hi> any of theſe prohibited Wares and Commodities: Nevertheleſs if the ſaid Commodities be made in <hi>Scotland,</hi> it ſhall be lawful to bring them out of <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> and ſo recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally of the Commodities made in <hi>England</hi> and carried to <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Whereas a doubt hath been conceived againſt the equal Communication of Trade betwixt the <hi>Engliſh &amp; Scots</hi> Subjects in the matter of Importation, grounded upon ſome Inequality of Privileges, which the <hi>Scots</hi> are report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have in Foreign Parts, and namely in <hi>France,</hi> above the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> whereby the <hi>Engliſh</hi> might be prejudged: And that after a deliberate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration had of the ſuppoſed Inequalities, both private and publick Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of divers Merchants of either ſide, touching all Liberties, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, Immunities, Impoſts and Payments on the part of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and on the part of the <hi>Scots,</hi> either at <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> for their Trade of Wines, or in <hi>Normandy</hi> or any other parts of <hi>France</hi> for other Commodities, it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that in the Trade of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> there was &amp; is ſo little difference in any advantage of Privileges or Immunities, or in the Impoſts and Payments, all being reckoned and well weighed on either ſide, as it could not juſtly hinder the Communication of Trade. In the Trade of <hi>Normandy</hi> likewiſe, or any other Parts of <hi>France,</hi> the advantage the <hi>Scots</hi> Subjects by their Privileges are acknowledged to have, is ſuch as without much Difficulty may be reconciled and reduced to an Equality with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> by ſuch means as are hereafter declared. It is agreed that the <hi>Scotſ-men</hi> ſhall be
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0554400100:705"/>
free for tranſporting of Wine from <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> paying the ſame Cuſtoms &amp; Duties that the <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> do pay, &amp; the <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> likewiſe ſhall be free for tranſporting Wine &amp; other Commodities from <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> to <hi>Scotland</hi> paying the ſame cuſtoms &amp; duties that the <hi>Scots-men</hi> do pay there.</p>
                        <p>And likewiſe for clearing and reſolving the Doubts touching the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage that theſe <hi>Scots</hi> are ſuppoſed to have above the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in Buying and tranſporting the Commodities of <hi>Normandy</hi> and other parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>France,</hi> excepting the buying of Wine in <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready determined. It is agreed, that there ſhall be ſent ſome meet and diſcreet Perſons into <hi>France,</hi> two for either ſide, to take notice of any ſuch Advantage, as either the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have above the <hi>Scots,</hi> or the <hi>Scots</hi> above the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in Buying or Tranſporting of any Commodities of <hi>Normandy,</hi> or any parts of <hi>France,</hi> excepting the Wine of <hi>Bourdeaux:</hi> And as the ſaid Perſons ſhall find the advantage to be, ſo for making the Trade e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, the Cuſtoms ſhall be advanced to the King in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> And for the part of theſe that have the advantage, and according to the Proportion of the ſaid Advantage, the Advancement of the Cuſtom to continue no longer, than the Privilege having ſuch advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage ſhall continue. And that generally for all other Trade from any Parts the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> Subjects, each in others Countrey, ſhall have Liberty of Importation as freely as any of the Native Subjects themſelves having ſpecial Privilege.</p>
                        <p>Next, Concerning Exportation, It is agreed, That all ſuch Goods as are prohibited and forbidden to <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> themſelves to be exported out of <hi>England</hi> to any Foreign Part, the ſame ſhall be unlawful for any <hi>Scotſ-man,</hi> or any other to export to any Foreign Nation beyond Sea, under the ſame Penalties and Forfeitures that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are ſubject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and reciprocally that furth of <hi>Scotland</hi> no <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man ſhall tranſport to any Foreign Parts the Goods and Commodities that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>Scots</hi> Men themſelves. Nevertheleſs ſuch Goods and Commodities and Merchandizes as are licenſed to <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men to tranſport out of <hi>England</hi> to any Foreign Part, the ſame may be likewiſe tranſported by <hi>Scots</hi> Men thither, they certifying their going into For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Parts, and taking a Cocquet accordingly, and paying the ordinary Cuſtom that <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men do pay themſelves at the Exportation of ſuch Wares, the like Liberty to be for <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As for the Native Commodities which either of the Countries do yield, and may ſerve for the uſe and benefit of the other; It is agreed, That mutually there may be tranſported furth of E. to S. and furth of S. to E. all ſuch Wares as are either of the Growth or Handywork of either of the ſaid Realms, without payment of any Impoſt, Cuſtom or Exaction; and as freely in all reſpects as any Wares may be tranſported either in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> from part to part, or in <hi>Scotland</hi> from Part to Part, except ſuch particular Sorts of Goods and Merchandizes as are hereafter mentioned, being reſtrain'd for the proper and inward uſe of each Countrey. And for that purpoſe it is declared, That both in this Communication of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and Participation of the native Commodities of the one Countrey with the other, there ſhall be ſpecially reſerv'd and excepted the ſorts hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpecified; That is to ſay, Wooll, Sheep, Sheepfell, Cattel, Leather, Hides, and Linen-yarn, which are ſpecially reſtrain'd within each Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, not to be tranſported from one to the other; excepting alſo and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving to the <hi>Scots</hi> Men their Trade of Fiſhing within the Lochs, Firths and Bayes, within Land, and in the Seas within 14 Miles of the Coaſts of the Realm of <hi>Scotland,</hi> where neither <hi>Engliſh-</hi>men nor any Strangers have
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0554400100:706"/>
us'd to Fiſh; and ſo reciprocally on the behalf of <hi>England.</hi> All which Reſtrictions and Exceptions are not to be underſtood or mentioned in any ſort for a Mark or Note of Separation and Diviſion, but only as matters of Policy and Conveniency for the ſeveral Eſtates of each Countrey.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore it is agreed, That all foreign Wares to be tranſported forth of <hi>Scotland</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> or out of <hi>England</hi> into <hi>Scotland,</hi> by any of the King's Subjects of either Kingdoms, having at their firſt Entry once paid Cuſtom in either of the Kingdoms, ſhall not pay outward Cuſtoms therein afterwards, ſave only inward Cuſtom at the Port whereunto they ſhall be tranſported: But the Owner of the Goods, or Factor, or Maſter of the Ship ſhall give Bond not to tranſport the ſame into any foreign Parts.</p>
                        <p>It is alſo agreed, That <hi>Scots-</hi>men ſhall not be debarred from being Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociates unto any <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company of Merchants, as Merchant-Venturers or others upon ſuch Conditions as any <hi>Engliſh-</hi>man may be admitted; and ſo reciprocally for <hi>Engliſh</hi> men in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is nevertheleſs agreed by mutual Conſent, and is ſo to be underſtood, that the mutual Liberty aforeſaid of Exportation and Trade in each part from the one to the other, ſhall ſerve for the inward uſe only of either Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ahn; and Order taken for the reſtraining and prohibiting the Tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the ſaid Commodities to foreign Parts, and for due Puniſhment of thoſe that ſhall tranſgreſs in that behalf. And for the Better. Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Caution herein, It is agreed that every Merchant ſo offending ſhall forfeit his Goods, the Ships wherein the ſaid Goods ſhall be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, confiſcated; the Cuſtomers, Searchers, and other Officers of the Cuſtom whatſoever, in caſe of Conſent or knowledge on their part, to loſe their Offices and Goods, and their Bodies to be impriſoned at His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's pleaſure. Of which Eſcheats and Forfeitures two Parts ſhall apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to His Majeſty, if the Cuſtoms be unfarm'd, and the Third to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former: And if the Cuſtoms be farmed, one Third of the Forfeiture to belong to His Majeſty, a Third to the Farmer, and the other Third to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former. The Tryal of the Offence to be ſummar in either Countrey in the Exchequer Chamber; by Writ, ſufficient Witneſſes, or Oath of Party, or before the Juſtice by Jury or Aſſize, and his Majeſty's Officers in either Countrey to concur with the Complainers that inſiſt in the Purſuit.</p>
                        <p>As alſo for the more Security that there ſhall be no Tranſportation of ſuch Goods, it is agreed that at the ſhipping of all ſuch native Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities there be taken by the Cuſtomer of the Port where the Goods or Wares are embark'd a Bond or Obligation ſubſcribed by the Owner of the Goods, and Maſter of the Ship; By the Owner if he be preſent, or by the Maſter of the Ship, or Factor, or Party that loadeth the ſame in caſe of his abſence: Which Bond ſhall contain a Sum of Money anſwerable to the Value of the Goods, with condition of relieving the Party obliged, and diſcharging him of the ſaid Bond in caſe Return be made of a due Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate to the Cuſtom where the Goods were laden, from any Port within <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Certificate to be ſubſcribed and ſealed by the Officers of the Cuſtoms of the Port where the ſaid Goods ſhall arrive to be unladen: Or if there be no ſuch Officers there, by the chief Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate and Town Clerk of that Harbour and Town under their Hand and Seal. And it is further agreed touching the different Fraighting of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities either in <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Scots</hi> Bottoms, that <hi>Engliſh-</hi>men and <hi>Scots</hi> men fraight and laden their Goods each in others Ships &amp; Bottoms indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, paying only <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> Cuſtom, notwithſtanding any contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Laws or Prohibitions. And that a Propoſition be made to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England</hi> for eſtabliſhing ſome good Orders, for upholding and maintaining the great Fiſhing of <hi>England;</hi> as alſo that a Propoſition be
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0554400100:707"/>
made to the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> for making of their ſhipping more proportionable in Burthen to the ſhipping of <hi>England,</hi> the better to ſerve for the Equality of Trade, and a common Defence for the whole Iſle.</p>
                        <p>And becauſe it's Requiſite that the mutual Communication aforeſaid, be not only extended to the Matter of Commerce, but to all other Benefites and Privileges of natural born Subjects; It is agreed that an Act be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned to be paſſed in Manner following: That all the Subjects of both Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alms born ſince the Deceaſe of the late Queen, and that ſhal be born here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after under the Obedience of His Majeſty or His Royal Progeny, are by the common Laws of both Realms, and ſhall be for ever enabled to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, ſucceed, inherit and poſſeſs all Goods, Lands and Chattels, Honours, Dignities, Offices, Liberties &amp; Privileges &amp; Benefices Eccleſiaſtick or Civil, in Parliament and all other places of the Kingdoms, and every one of the ſame, in all reſpects, and without any Exception whatſomever, as fully and amply as the Subjects of either Realm reſpectively might have done, or may do in any ſort within the Kingdom where they are born.</p>
                        <p>Further, his Majeſty out of his great Judgment and Providence, hath not only profeſſed in publick and private Speech to the Nobility and Council of both Kingdoms, but hath alſo vouchſafed to be contented that for a more full Satisfaction and Comfort of all his loving Subjects, it may be compris'd in the ſaid Act, that his Majeſty meaneth not to confer any Office of the Crown, any Office of Judicature, Place, Voice or Office in Parliament of either Kingdom, upon the Subjects of the other, born be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the death of the late Queen, until Time and Converſation have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd and accompliſh'd an Union of the ſaid Kingdoms, as well in the Hearts of all the People, and in the Conformity of Laws and Policies in theſe Kingdoms, as in the Knowledge and Sufficiency of particular men, who being untimely imployed in ſuch Authorities, could no way be able, much leſs acceptable, to diſcharge ſuch Duties belonging to them. It is therefore reſolved by us the Commiſſioners aforeſaid, not only in regard of our Deſires and Endeavours to further a ſpeedy Concluſion of this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Work intended, but alſo as a Teſtimony of our Love and Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for his gracious Promiſe, on whoſe Sincerity and Benignity we build our full Aſſurance, even according to the inward ſenſe and feeling of our own Loyal and Hearty Affections, to obey and pleaſe him in all things worthy the Subjects of ſo worthy a Sovereign, that it ſhall be deſired of both the Parliaments, to be enacted by their Authority, That all the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of both Realms, born before the Deceaſe of the late Queen, may be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and made capable to acquire, purchaſe, inherit, ſucceed, uſe &amp; diſpoſe of all Lands, Goods, Inheritances, Offices, Honours, Dignities Liberties, Privileges Immunities, Benefices and Preferments whatſoever, Each Subject in either Kingdom with the ſame freedom and as lawfully and peaceably as the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry natural and born Subjects of either Realm, where the ſaid Rights, Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates or Profits are Eſtabliſhed; Notwithſtanding whatſoever Law, Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, or former Conſtitution heretofore in Force to the contrary; Other than to acquire, poſſeſs ſucceed or inherit any Office of the Crown, office of Judicatory, or any Voice, place or Office in Parliament. All which ſhall remain free from being claim'd, held or enjoy'd by the Subjects of the one Kingdom within the other, born before the deceaſe of the late Queen, notwithſtanding any Words, Senſe or Interpretation of the Act, or any Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance thereupon depending, untill there be a perfect &amp; full Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Union, as is deſired mutually by both the Realms. In all which points of Reſervation, either in Recital of the words, His Majeſties ſacred Promiſe, or in any Clauſe or Sentence, before ſpecified, from enabling

                              <p n="5">5. That whereas almoſt all the Ships and Veſſels belonging to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Subjects of <hi>Scotland,</hi> were during the late Uſurpation taken, burnt or Deſtroyed, and many of the Veſſels taken or bought ſince His Majeſties happy Return, are foreign built; we deſire that all Veſſels taken from the Kings Enemies, and condemned as lawful Prize, may be Declared Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalized, as is lately done here, and that they and all ſuch Ships as are truly in the Poſſeſſion of His Majeſties Subjects of <hi>Scotland,</hi> may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared capable of free Trade here as if they had been built within His Majeſties Dominions; a Liſt of ſuch Ships being entred betwixt and a day to be agreed upon into the Cuſtom-houſe Books here, Provided that it ſhall not be lawful for <hi>Scotſ-men</hi> to trade here with any foreign built Ships to be bought hereafter, but only with ſuch Ships as are built in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or ſome other of His Majeſties Dominions, and that both the Prize-Ships and other Ships now in the poſſeſſion of the Subjects of <hi>Scotland,</hi> be navigated by 3 Parts of 4 of <hi>Scots-men,</hi> or others His Majeſties Subjects, and fraighted only by His Majeſties Subjects.</p>

                                 <p>THE Commiſſioners being met, the Duke of <hi>Queenſberry</hi> ſaid, That the Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>Scotland</hi> had ſome thing to offer to their Lordſhips, in reference to their Lordſhips Anſwer to the 3<hi>d</hi> Article about Communication of Trade, which was read as follows.</p>
                                 <p>The Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>Scotland</hi> having taken into Conſideration your Lordſhips Anſwer to the 3<hi>d</hi> Article of their Propoſals, wherein your Lordſhips agree. That a mutual Communication of Trade and other Priviledtes and Advantages is proper and reaſonable in a compleat Union of the two Kingdoms, their Lordſhips conceive that the uniting the two Kingdoms into a Monarchy, in one Parliament, and one Line of Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is ſuch an Union as Entitle the Subjects of both Kingdoms to a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Communication of Trade, and other Privileges and Advantages, and if your Lordſhips do acquieſce and conſent to the Communication of Trade in theſe Terms, the Lords Commisſioners for <hi>Scotland</hi> do conſent that the Anſwer and this Addition be entred in the reſpective Books and Journals.</p>
                                 <p>The Lords Commisſioners for <hi>England</hi> withdrew to conſider this, and returning within a little, the Lord Keeper offered what follows, which was read.</p>
                                 <p>Their Lordſhips conceive that the Union cannot be compleat till the Terms are adjuſted, upon which it is to be conſtituted, and therefore tho they allow the Communication of Trade and other Privileges to be the neceſſary Reſult of a compleat Union: yet in the Method of proceeding they muſt firſt ſettle with your Lordſhips the Terms and Conditions of the Communication of Trade and other Privileges, and they are ready to enter upon the Conſideration of them in ſuch a Method as ſhall be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on, and moſt likely to bring this particular Matter to a ſpeedy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination.</p>
                                 <p>They move, That their Anſwer to the Propoſal from the Commiſſioners of <hi>England,</hi> which relates to the uniting the two Kingdoms into one, and ſettling the Succeſſion, may be entred.</p>
                                 <p>To this the Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>Scotland</hi> after having withdrawn for ſome time, and returned, made the following Anſwer, which was read, and agreed to by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſſioners.</p>
                                 <p>The Lords Commisſioners for <hi>Scotland</hi> are ſatisfied to treat the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the Communication of Trade, in order to adjuſt the ſame, and do agree that the Propoſals and Anſwers mutually made on either ſide be entred in the reſpective Books and Journals in the terms of the Prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries.</p>

                                 <p>The Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>Scotland</hi> propoſe to your Lordſhips, That for preparing and facilitating Matters which may occur in this Treaty, there may be a Committee conſiſting of 4 or 5 Perſons of either King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom Nominate from time to time, to meet and diſcourſe the Points that may properly fall in to be conſidered in this Treaty, and to report what hath paſt to the reſpective Commisſioners, that in the General Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they may proceed with the greater Unanimity and Diſpatch.</p>

                                       <p>I Am fully perſwaded, that the Union of the two Kingdoms will prove the Happineſs of Both; and render this Iſland more formidable than it has been in paſt Ages; That I wiſh this Treaty may be brought to a good and ſpeedy Concluſion, I am come to know what Progreſs you have made in it, and I do aſſure you nothing ſhall be wanting on my part to bring it to Perfection.</p>

                                 <p>Some Conſiderations of the Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>England</hi> upon the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0554400100:720"/>
Propoſals delivered by the Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>Scotland</hi> on the 9th inſtant, to be propoſed as the Subject Matter of Debate between the Lords Commiſſioners of both Kingdoms.</p>
                                 <p>As to the Firſt Article, Their Lordſhips are of Opinion that there be a free Trade between the two Kingdoms, for the Native Commodities of the Growth, Product or Manufactory of the reſpective Countries, with an Exception of Wooll, Sheep and Sheep Fells, and without any Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Impoſition other than equal Duties upon the home Conſumption re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively: Their Lordſhips being of Opinion, that the Trade between the two Kingdoms cannot be upon an equal Foot, unleſs the ſaid Duties and Impoſitions be the ſame in <hi>Scotland</hi> as in <hi>England.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>And this Article reſpecting a Coaſt-Trade, it ſeems reaſonable for their Lordſhips to inſiſt, That the Maſter, Mariner and Goods ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame Securities, Penalties and Regulations, as are in that caſe provided by the Laws in <hi>England.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>As to the 2<hi>d</hi> Article, it ſeems reaſonable; But their Lordſhips offer, that it will be neceſſary therein to add a Proviſion, That not only the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions on Trade, but the Prohibitions be the ſame on both Sides, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect as well of Importations as Exportations.</p>
                                 <p>As to the 3<hi>d</hi> Article, Their Lordſhips ſay, That the Plantations are the Property of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men, and that this Trade is of ſo great a Conſequence, and ſo beneficial, as not to be communicated, as is propoſed till all other Particulars which ſhall be thought neceſſary to this Union be adjuſted; And as the Caſe now ſtands by Law, no <hi>European</hi> Goods can be carried to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations, but what have been firſt landed in <hi>England,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Salt, <hi>Iriſh</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> Proviſions, Servants and Horſes, <hi>Madera</hi> Wine, and Wine of the <hi>Azores;</hi> nor can the Product of the Plantations be carryed to other Parts of <hi>Europe</hi> till it be firſt landed in <hi>England.</hi> Their Lordſhips further offer, That in this Article, it will be neceſſary to make Proviſion, that the Subjects of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhall be lyable to be preſsed for the Sea, in the ſame manner as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects are in time of War for Her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's Service.</p>
                                 <p>As to the 4<hi>th</hi> Article, Their Lordſhips agree that an Act of Navigation muſt be granted in both Kingdoms adapted to the Terms of the Union.</p>
                                 <p>As to the 5<hi>th</hi> Article, their Lordſhips ſay, That the Propoſals therein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contained ſeems to contradict what was granted by the 2<hi>d</hi> Article, in as much as there is no Duty ſubſiſting on Trade (excepting only on ſome Funds for the Civil Government) but what is appropriated to the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Debts of the Nation; That tho the ſaid Debts have been contracted by a long War entred into; More particularly for the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of <hi>England,</hi> and the Dominions thereto belonging; Yet that <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> has taſted of the Benefites which have accrued to <hi>Great-Britain</hi> in general, from the Oppoſition that hath been made to the Growth and Power of <hi>France;</hi> That ſuch Burdens will be abundantly recompenſed to <hi>Scotland</hi> by a compleat Union: To which compleat Union as a free Communication of Trade is eſſential, ſo ſuch a free Communication of Trade cannot be eſtabliſhed with Equality, unleſs the ſame Duties both
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0554400100:721"/>
upon Foreign Trade and Home Conſumption be levied on both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms: But how the Sums of Money thereby ariſing within the ſaid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alm ſhall be applyed, or what Equivalent is to be allowed in the Room thereof, may be ſettled when your Lordſhips are ready to offer what Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the publick Burdens <hi>Scotland</hi> propoſes to bear towards the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Support of the Government both in times of Peace and War.</p>
                                 <p>As to the 6<hi>th</hi> Article, their Lordſhips ſay, That it requires to be further explained, before they can be ready to give any anſwer to it.</p>
                                 <p>After giving in the above Propoſals, in anſwer to the laſt Propoſal made by <hi>Scotland,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> deſired a Day for a Conference on both might be appointed, which was accordingly appointed on <hi>Saturday</hi> next.</p>

                                 <p>THE Commiſſioners met, and at their taking their Places, the Lord Keeper ſaid, their Lordſhips of <hi>England</hi> had taken Notice of the publiſhing of ſome of their Proceedings in the Flying-Poſt, which they thought not Convenient, and therefore had ordered their Secretary not to give out any Copies of their Proceedings, and deſired their Lordſhips for <hi>Scotland</hi> would do the like, which was agreed to.

                                 <p>Agreed by the Lords Commiſſioners of both Kingdoms in the terms of the Preliminaries, and to take effect when the Union ſhall be compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.<list>
                                       <item>1.

                                       <item>1. AS to the former part of the firſt Article, <hi>viz.</hi> That neither Kingdom be burdened with the Debts contracted, or to be contracted by the other before the Union, it being the ſame <hi>in terminis</hi> with the 5th Propoſition delivered by your Lordſhips on the 9th <hi>December;</hi> the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation made then may ſuffice for a Reply to it now, <hi>viz.</hi> That tho the Debts of <hi>England</hi> have been contracted by a long War, entred into more particularly for the Preſervation of <hi>England,</hi> and the Dominions thereto belonging, yet <hi>Scotland</hi> has had its Share in the Benefits which
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0554400100:726"/>
have accrued to <hi>Great-Britain</hi> in general from the Oppoſition that has been made to the Growth and Power of <hi>France,</hi> and have encreaſed the Number of their Seamen conſiderably, by the Imployment they had in the Coaſt-Trade of <hi>England</hi> during the War. But as it is neceſſary they ſhould be under equal Impoſitions with regard to the Ballance of Trade, and Manufactories when the Kingdoms ſhall be united, and a free Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of Native Product ſettled, ſo it may be reaſonable that the Money ſo raiſed upon that part which is now called <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſhould be applyed to the Security and Protection of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Trade thereof; nor does it follow, That becauſe the Duties now raiſed on particular Funds in <hi>England</hi> are appropriate for payment of Debts; That therefore when the like Duties are laid on in <hi>Scotland,</hi> they muſt be applyed in the ſame manner, but for their Lordſhips to propoſe that there be no other Duty in <hi>Scotland</hi> than theſe now on Foot there, till the Debts in <hi>England</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, or to be contracted before the Union be fully ſatisfied and paid, ſetts the preſent Trade on an equal Foot, (which is intended by an equality of Impoſitions) at ſuch a diſtance, as gives little hopes to any now alive of coming at it, For one of the nine Pences on Beer and Ale being the Fund of the firſt Million <hi>Act, Anno</hi> 4 and 5. of the late King and Queen, was granted for 99 years; One Nine Pences more (which is the Fund of the Lottery) for about eight years yet to come; One nine Pence more (which is the Bank-Fund) Inheritance to the Crown, as are alſo the ſeveral Duties upon Salt, and half that on Stamped Paper, tho' in theſe latter Duties there are Clauſes of Proviſion for Redemption, but whilſt it is inſiſted, That there ſhall be no other nor greater in <hi>Scotland</hi> than are already paid there, it may be preſumed that theſe already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, are enough to prevent the neceſſity of enquiring into the Number or Proportion of what they have in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where if by Exemption from ſuch Duties, a Clothier can ſubſiſt himſelf at 4<hi>d per diem,</hi> whereas he cannot ſubſiſt in <hi>England</hi> under 8<hi>d per diem;</hi> Then all ſuch Manufactu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res who ſhall go thither; will be able to underſell, and conſequently out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trade thoſe that ſtay in <hi>England</hi> half in half in what relates to their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, by ſubſiſting ſo much cheaper; But the Workmanſhip of every pound of Wooll made in Cloth, advances the value of it near Nine Parts in Ten for its firſt Coſt.</item>
                                       <item>2. As to the ſecond Article, their Lordſhips ſay, That Duties upon the Home Conſumption require to be equally laid on all the parts of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited Kingdoms; Nor do the Northern Counties of <hi>England</hi> pay leſs Duties of Exciſe (as ſeems here ſuggeſted) than the Mid-land, but rather more in Proportion to the value of their Counties and Commodities ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed.</item>
                                       <item>3. As to the Third Article, it is needleſs to debate upon it till the firſt be ſettled, theſe two depending the one upon the other; If indeed the Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>England</hi> ſhould think it expedient to exempt Home-Conſumption of <hi>Scotland</hi> from any new Duties for ſome reaſonable Period of Time, till that Kingdom began to reap the benefite of the free Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of Trade intended by the Union, Then their Lordſhips will inſiſt, that ſuch Commodities as pay Duties in <hi>England</hi> may be cleared with the ſame Duties when they are exported or brought out of <hi>Scotland</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> &amp; upon ſome other Proviſions which will be requiſite to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Frauds in Her Majeſties Revenues.</item>

4. As to the 4th Article, The Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>England</hi> ſay, That the free Communication, eſpecially of the Foreign Trade, to which in the terms of the Preliminaries their Lordſhips have aſſented, is ſo great a Benefite to <hi>Scotland,</hi> that they did not expect an Equivalent ſhould have been mentioned, for the equality of Impoſition on Importation and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation; Beſides, their Lordſhips ſay, your Lordſhips have already a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon an equality of Impoſitions as to Foreign Trade, both as to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation and Importation.</item>
                                       <item>5. As to the 5th Article, It will be impoſſible to determine this Point till their Lordſhips ſhall be informed of the value of the Lands in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and this may be further debated when their Members or Repreſentatives in the Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> ſhall be ſettled.</item>

                                 <p>The Lords Commiſſioners for <hi>England</hi> agree, that neither Kingdom ſhall be burdened with the Debts of the other, contracted before the Union, and that no Duties on Home Conſumption, or Taxes to be levyed from <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> ſhall be applyed for payment of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Debts; and whatever time may be fit to be allowed to <hi>Scotland</hi> to reap the benefite of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of Trade, and enable them the better to pay Duties on Home Conſumption equal to <hi>England,</hi> is moſt proper to be determined in the reſpective Parliaments of both Kingdoms.</p>

                                 <p>As to the laſt Propoſition delivered the 27th Inſtant, their Lordſhips ſay, It has been found by Experience, That two Companies exiſting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the ſame Kingdom, and carrying on the ſame Traffick, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to Trade, and are therefore of Opinion, that to agree with this Propoſition, will be inconſiſtent with the Intereſt of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>
