            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of the ſmall Armoury.</head>
                  <p>THE building itſelf, called the <hi>new Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moury,</hi> where theſe arms
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0845700102:18"/>are laid up, is a moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and magnificent ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It ſtands north of the White Tower, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends in length about a hundred and thirty yards, in depth about twenty. It was begun in the reign of king James the ſecond, and finiſhed in king William's.</p>
                  <p>You go in at the weſt end of this grand build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, behind the chapel, and aſcend a ſpacious and lofty
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0845700102:19"/>ſtair-caſe, at the head of which you turn to your right hand, and entering the room before you, you will ſee one of the greateſt, curioſities, in its kind, ever formed by the art of man: Here are arms, we are told, ſufficient for a hundred thouſand men at a minute's warning, laid up in a moſt ſurprizing artificial order and beauty, all bright and clean to admiration.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0845700102:20"/>Juſt within the door, on the left hand, are, firſt, two lofty beatiful pyramids of piſtols, ſtanding upon the crown, globe and ſceptre, in curious carved work.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is called a wilderneſs of arms; that is, pikes, carbines, muskets, bayonets, halberts, ſwords, piſtols, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo laid up, that you have a proſpect through all their ranges to the farther end of the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0845700102:21"/>room, which is three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and forty-five feet long; the ſight of which is enough to ſtrike one with wonder and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>The third is a figure of arms taken at the Bath in the laſt rebellion in the year 1715.</p>
                  <p>Fourth, is the form of the waves of the ſea, made with ſwords.</p>
                  <p>Fifth, repreſents half-moons
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0845700102:22"/>and fans, made with piſtols and bayonets; and the form of a target in the middle made with bayo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net blades.</p>
                  <p>Sixth, two pillars of pikes, in imitation of flut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed work, with fine carved capitals, of the Corinthian order.</p>
                  <p>Seventh, a pillar made of pikes and ſwords, for the ſea ſervice.</p>
                  <p>Eighth, are blunderbuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0845700102:23"/>in the form of pillars, with capitals of piſtols all the way up; and on both ſides bayonets in the form of the waves of the ſea.</p>
                  <p>Ninth, carbines for the horſe ſervice, and marine hangers ſet in checquer-work.</p>
                  <p>Tenth, carbines for the horſe, lined with pikes.</p>
                  <p>Eleventh, are ſwords and bayonets in the form of half-moons and fans, ſet
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0845700102:24"/>upon ſcollop-ſhells of fine carved work.</p>
                  <p>Twelfth, is the ſun riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, repreſented in a ſquare frame, guarded with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine hangers; and oppoſite to that, in the middle of the room, are four beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful twiſted pillars, made with piſtols up to the top, which is about twenty two feet, the heighth of the room: and in the centre of theſe pillars, is the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0845700102:25"/>form of a dropping ſtar, made of piſtols; upon the left is the form of the ſun ſetting, made anſwerable to that of its riſing.</p>
                  <p>Thirteenth, repreſents the form of a pair of gates, made with ſerjeants hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts.</p>
                  <p>Fourteenth, are carbines hanging in ſurbelows and flounces.</p>
                  <p>Fifteenth, is the form of a whale's backbone, made with carbines.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0845700102:26"/>Sixteenth, repreſents the grand witch of Endor, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led likewiſe Envy, or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſa's head; with the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of ſnakes ſtinging her to death, made with three rows of piſtols, ſet with curious art; the features are of fine carved work.</p>
                  <p>Seventeenth, at the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end of the room, on the left hand, is the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of king Henry the fifth, who conquered
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0845700102:27"/>France, with his flaming ſword in his hand: he took more men priſoners than he had in his army.</p>
                  <p>Next is the figure of a fiery ſerpent, the head and tail of carved work, the body of piſtols.</p>
                  <p>Facing the window, at the eaſt end, is the form of a large and beautiful organ, made with ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand piſtols, ten ſtory, or ranges high.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0845700102:28"/>Between the windows, at the ſame end, is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the Hydra, or ſeven-headed monſter; three of which heads are above, and four below, and not one like the other, all of carved work.</p>
                  <p>Next, is king Henry the ſixth's armour; he was crowned king of France: his father con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered the country, and this prince loſt it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0845700102:29"/>The firſt curioſity on the other ſide, coming back again, is the figure of Jupiter in his fiery chariot, drawn by eagles, in the clouds, with a thunderbolt in his hand, in carved work, guarded round with bayonets.</p>
                  <p>Second, is the ſtar and garter made of piſtols and bayonets; with the thiſtle, roſe and crown over head, in carved work; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0845700102:30"/>are birds, and other curious creatures, in fine carved work.</p>
                  <p>All the way down, on this ſide, are the ſame fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to thoſe we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in going up on the other.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, you are ſhewn a great parcel of arms ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the aſſaſſination plot againſt king William, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly a blunderbus,

                     <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of the Horſe Armoury.</head>
                  <p>HERE you are firſt preſented with a
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0845700102:43"/>view of the ſigures of the horſe guards that attend the kings, whom you will ſee preſently all on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back in bright armour of poliſhed ſteel, and ranged in beautiful order on the other ſide of the houſe; as alſo of a great number of foot-guards, ſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the horſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Second, over head is the famous lance of Charles Brandon, duke of Suffolk,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0845700102:44"/>king Henry the eighth's general in France.</p>
                  <p>Third, a ſuit of tilting armour, with which the nobility and gentry uſed to exerciſe, before guns were invented.</p>
                  <p>Fourth, a curious ſuit of armour made for king Henry the eighth, rough from the hammer, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver filed.</p>
                  <p>Fifth, a little ſuit of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour for king Charles the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0845700102:45"/>ſecond, when he was prince of Wales; with a piece for his horſe's head, of curious workmanſhip.</p>
                  <p>Sixth, my lord Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy's ſuit of armour, great champion of Ireland; and the large two-handed ſword he took from the champion of France: for which gallant action he and his ſucceſſors have the privilege of wearing their hats in the preſence of the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0845700102:46"/>kings of England; which is continued to this day. The lord Kinſale is now head of that noble family.</p>
                  <p>Seventh, a ſuit of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian armour; ſent as a preſent to king Charles the ſecond, from the great Mogul, which is ſaid to be a defence againſt arrows, darts, and poiſoned lances, made uſe of in that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
                  <p>Eighth, a little ſuit of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0845700102:47"/>armour made in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Richard, duke of York, who, with his brother Edward the fifth, was ſmothered in the Tower between two fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-beds, about two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty ſeven years ago; the former being about eleven years old, and the latter thirteen.</p>
                  <p>Ninth, John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaſter's ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; he was both ſon
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0845700102:48"/>and father of a king, but never king himſelf. It is ſaid he was ſeven feet four inches high.</p>
                  <p>Tenth, is the comical figure of Will. Somers, jeſter to king Henry the eighth.— He is called an honeſt man of woman's making—wears his horns upon his head to prevent the making holes in his pocket; and becauſe he was dim-ſighted, he would
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0845700102:49"/>believe neither the king, queen, nor any of the court, that he was a cuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>old, till he had put his ſpectacles on; with which he is repreſented by way of ridicule to this day.</p>
                  <p>Eleventh, is an ill fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured old inſtrument, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>collar of torment,</hi> which we are told was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly put about the necks of ſuch women as either proved falſe to their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0845700102:50"/>beds, or took too great a freedom with their tongues.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>But long this collar has aſide been caſt.</l>
                     <l>Sure! they are now leſs noiſy, and more chaſte.</l>

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0845700102:51"/>of king William the third.</p>
                  <p>Second, another of king Charles the ſecond.</p>
                  <p>Third, of king Charles the firſt.</p>
                  <p>This ſuit of armour, which is ſteel, richly gilt with gold, coſt, as we are informed, fifteen hundred pounds; and was a preſent from the city of London, when he was prince of Wales.</p>
                  <p>Fourth, of king James I.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:0845700102:52"/>Fiſth of king Edward the ſixth, the firſt prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant prince that ever reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in England: He was the royal founder of three hoſpitals, all which he gave to the city of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; <hi>viz.</hi> that of St. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas's for the relief of the ſick and the lame; Chriſt's Church for the ſupport of freemens children, who are orphans; and Bridewell, for training up of youth,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0845700102:53"/>and the encouragement of ſeveral uſeful branches of our Engliſh manufactures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixth, a curious figure of king Henry the eighth.</p>
                  <p>Seventh, of Henry the ſeventh, who killed crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backed Richard the third, in Boſworth-field, Leiceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſhire; ſome ſhort time after he had ſmothered his two young nephews in the Tower.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0845700102:54"/>Eighth, of Edward the fifth, who was proclaimed king, but was never crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the crown hanging over his head. He was ſmothered with his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as mentioned above.</p>
                  <p>Ninth, of Edward the fourth, father of the two laſt named princes. This king was remarkable for his gallantries with the citizens wives, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the famous Jane Shore.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:0845700102:55"/>Tenth, of king Henry the ſixth, crowned alſo king of France, at Paris.</p>
                  <p>Eleventh, of Henry the fifth, who conquered France; the ſame prince whom we mentioned in our chapter <hi>Of the ſmall Armoury,</hi> to have taken more men priſoners than he had in his army.</p>
                  <p>Twelfth, of Henry the fourth, ſon of John of Gaunt,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:0845700102:56"/>Thirteenth, of Edward the third, who was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in having the kings of France and Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land priſoners in England at one time; for which reaſon he wears two crowns upon his ſword.</p>
                  <p>Fourteenth, of Edward the firſt, who fought ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral battles againſt the Turks and Infidedls in the holy land.</p>

It ſtands on a pedeſtal with its wings expanded. The head ſcrews off at the middle of the neck, for the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency of pouring in the oil; the neck being hollow to the beak; the holy oil

                  <p>From this battery, at about two hundred yards diſtance, you come to a ſpacious, ſtrong, ſtone battery, where there are
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0845700102:108"/>eight large iron cannon mounted. This battery is at the north corner of the eaſt end of the Tower.— From thence you paſs on to the fourth battery, where there are ſix guns, which point towards the north. The guns are fired from all theſe batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and from thoſe alſo of the wharf, on ſome particular rejoicing days, ſuch as the king's birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0845700102:109"/>being the 30th of October, and his return from abroad; and from the wharf alone, on all other royal holidays, and likewiſe as often as his majeſty goes to the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment houſe, and on the 29th of May, 5th of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the laſt battery we proceed to the royal mint, where all the gold, ſilver, and copper coins

                  <p>I could very willingly give my young readers a particular account of the art of making of money, but I am afraid it might tempt ſome naughty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to counterfeit, the current coin, for which I ſhould be juſtly blamed,

                     <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of the inſide of the White tower.</head>
                  <p>I Muſt firſt inform my young readers, that the inſide of this grand Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0845700102:112"/>is not publickly ſhewn, but as they, in proceeding from one place to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in order to ſee the rarities, paſs by it two or three times, and will very likely be inquiſitive to know what is with inſide, I ſhall therefore endeavour to ſatisfy their curiouſity.</p>
                  <p>This Tower is a large magazine, or vaſt ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, filled with prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious numbers of various
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0845700102:113"/>kinds of inſtruments. of war: The vaults, which perhaps are the largeſt and fineſt in all the world, are filled with bags of ſalt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, for the making of gunpowder. Upon the firſt ſloor are ſeveral ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious rooms; one of which is a ſmall armoury for the ſea ſervice, for ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men. Which arms are of various ſorts, very cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and laid up in beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful order.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:0845700102:114"/>In another room are a multitude of fine cloſets, preſſes and lockers, all fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with an almoſt incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible number of tools for the war ſervice. As to gunpowder, there is but little kept in this place, only ſo much as will ſerve for the uſe of the garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. This Tower has three very high ſtories, and, upon the top of all, fine leads; and, what is
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0845700102:115"/>ſurprizing, water from the Thames is forced by an engine to the top of this lofty Tower; where it fills a ciſtern of about ſeven feet deep, nine broad, and about ſixty feet in length: being the biggeſt that I ever ſaw or heard of.</p>
                  <p>The walls of this ſtrong Tower, are, at the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>floor, one and twenty feet thick; at the ſecond,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0845700102:116"/>about ſixteen feet, and at the third about ſeven feet thick. At the ſouth ſide of this White Tower is a room, formerly a chapel, where are kept the ancient records of this nation.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall next tell my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the time and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of opening and ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the gates of the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and ſo conclude this hiſtory.</p>

                  <p>AT half an hour after nine o'clock at night the bell on the top of the governor's houſe rings, to warn the inhabitants or others to go out, or come into the garriſon, as their
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0845700102:118"/>affairs may require: At the ſame time the drum beats over the ſpur guard, at the entrance into the Tower, to give notice to the ſoldiers who are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from duty, to come in; likewiſe at ten a-clock the tattoo beats, <hi>Go to bed, Tom,</hi> from the main guard, which is at the weſt ſide of the white Tower, quite round the Tower, to the place from whence they ſet out.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:0845700102:119"/>At eleven o'clock (which is the hour they lock up the gates, both in winter and ſummer) the yeoman porter calls a ſerjeant and a file fo men to attend the keys to lock up the royal Tower; who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with him to the ſpur guard, or outer gates, which being ſecured, they go back to the main guard; where the yeoman porter cries, <hi>God bleſs the king;</hi>
                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:0845700102:120"/>the guard, who are drawn. up in order, anſwer <hi>Amen:</hi> From thence they go to the governor's houſe, where they lodge the keys; after which no perſon, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any account whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, can either go out or come into the Tower, till next morning; when the ſame ceremony is again obſerved at opening the gates; in the ſummer at half an hour after five,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0845700102:121"/>and in the winter at ſeven.</p>
                  <p>About half and hour after nine, before they look up the Tower, one of the warders, with a guard of ſoldiers upon duty, locks up the gates upon the wharf, and, drawing up the draw-bridge, locks the gate which leads to it, and ſo retires into the Tower, after which no perſon can go out, or come in.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:0845700102:122"/>Having now ſhut the gates of the Tower, I have nothing more to add concerning the curioſities of this place — but I beg leave to inform my young readers, that the <hi>Hiſtory of Weſtminſter Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey</hi> is now in hand, and will be got ready for the preſs with all convenient ſpeed: Subſcribers are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to bring or ſend their names to <hi>Thomas Boreman</hi>
