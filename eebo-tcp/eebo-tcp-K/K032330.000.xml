            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And 'tis impoſſible, my Lord, this Poem ſhould find Sanctuary any where but in the Umbrage of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, for the Eyes of all Mankind are ſo fixt upon your Grace, that 'twou'd be a Diſappointment to the Publick. to lay at any other's Door, what is ſo much your Duee And tho' I hit not a <hi>Wildair</hi> for the Humour of the

            <p>Your particular Art, in appearing free, complaiſant and converſible, without quitting a Noble Greatneſs proper to yourſelf, makes us at once approach you with Freedom and with Awe: Your Goodneſs, that makes you ſtoop to your Inferiors, loſes nothing by being view'd near at hand, but is the more admir'd for it; and thus we conſider your Grace arriv'd at the Height of Greatneſs, without a mortifying Reflection on the Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our own Condition; nor does the World envy the truly Great, who by their Goodneſs and Affability make Mankind partake of their Felicity.</p>
            <p>I may plead Preſcription in Excuſe of this Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and tell how Poets in all Ages have pretended a Right to lay their Works at ſome Nobleman's Feet; but I'd rather ſubmit to your Grace's Goodneſs; for if I have offended, 'tis a Fault of the beſt kind, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from too much Zeal to let the World know how much I am,</p>

Theſe ſnarling Sparks were pleas'd to carp at one or two Expreſſions, which are ſpoken in 'em Aſide by one of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Characters in the Drama; and without conſidering the Reputation of the Perſons in whoſe Mouths the Language is put, condemn it ſtrait for looſe and obſcure: Now (with Submiſſion to better Judges) I cannot believe that a Prayer-Book ſhou'd be put into the Hands of a Woman, whoſe innate Virtue won't ſecure her Reputation; nor is it reaſonable to expect a Perſon, whoſe Inclinations are always forming Projects to the Diſhonour of her Husband, ſhou'd deliver her Commands to her Confident in the Words of a Pſalm. I heartily wiſh that thoſe that find fault with the Liberty of my Stile, wou'd be pleas'd to ſet a Pattern to the Town, by retrenching ſome of their Debaucheries, for Modeſty thrives beſt by Example. Modeſt Language from the truly Virtuous is expected; I mean ſuch as will neither act ill, nor ſuffer ill to be acted: It is not enough that <hi>Lucy</hi> ſays ſhe's honeſt, in having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the Brutal Part; who ever thinks Virtue centers in that, has a wrong Notion of it; no, Virtue is a tender Plant, which cannot live in tainted Ground; Virtue is what the Air

of Flattery cannot blaſt, nor the vile ſordid Droſs of Gain poiſon; and ſhe that can withſtand theſe two Shocks, may be ſtil'd truly Virtuous. I ask my Reader's Pardon for my Bluntneſs, but I hope none of my Sex ſo qualified will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn me for expoſing the Vices of the ſeeming Religious</p>
            <p>I fear there are but too many hit by the Character of Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora <hi>Pizalta;</hi> I wiſh, for the ſake of the reverſe Party, there were fewer, or they better known, ſince the malicious World are ſo apt to judge of Peoples Inclinations by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany they keep; which is ſometimes authentick, but not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways an infallible Rule. I ſhall ſay little in Juſtification of the Play, only deſire the Reader to judge impartially, and not condemn it by the Shortneſs of its Life, ſince the Seaſon of the Year never promis'd much better Succeſs. It went off with general Applauſe; and 'tis the Opinion of ſome of our beſt Judges, that it only wanted the Addition of good Actors, and a full Town, to have brought me a Sixth Night, there having been worſe Plays within this Twelve-month approv'd of.</p>
