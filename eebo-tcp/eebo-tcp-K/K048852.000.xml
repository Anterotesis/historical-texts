            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>IN this Pſalm ſome remarkable Victory
and Deliverance is celebrated, which the
<hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation had obtained: A Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in which the Hand of God viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
appeared, reſcuing his People from immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Danger. Very probably it was written
in <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s Reign, on Occaſion of their
being delivered from the formidable Invaſion
of <hi>Sennacherib</hi> and the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Army;
when the Angel of the Lord, in one Night,
diſcomfited all their Hoſt, and ſmote them
with ſudden Deſtruction<note n="a" place="bottom">2 King xix. 35.</note>
. To this ſignal
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0427402000:4"/>
Interpoſition of the Divine Arm, theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
in the Context may be naturally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied;
<hi>There brake, he the arrows of the bow,
the ſhield, the ſword, and the battle—the
ſtout-hearted are ſpoiled: they have ſlept their
ſleep; and none of the men of might have
found their hands. At thy rebuke, O God of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,
both the chariot and the horſe are caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a dead sleep.</hi> In the Words of our Text,
we have the Pſalmiſt's religious and wiſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
upon all theſe Events; upon the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Deſigns of their Enemies, and the Iſſue
to which Providence brought theſe Deſigns;
<hi>Surely, the wrath of man ſhall praiſe thee:
the remainder of wrath ſhalt thou reſtrain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The wrath of man;</hi> that is, all the Rage,
and the impetuous Paſſion of wicked Men;
with the violent Effects of War, Perſecution,
Oppreſſion, and other Diſorders it produces
in the World. All theſe the Pſalmiſt tells us,
<hi>ſhall praiſe God:</hi> Not indeed, by the Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Deſign, nor by the native Tendency,
of the <hi>wrath of man:</hi> But by theſe wiſe and
good Purpoſes, which the Providence of God
cauſes it to <hi>accompliſh;</hi> from this Poiſon <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting</hi>
Health; and of Things, moſt unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and unapt in themſelves to yield him Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0427402000:5"/>
               <hi>forming</hi> Inſtruments of Good. So that,
tho' the <hi>wrath of man,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi>
ſpeaks, <hi>worketh not,</hi> of itſelf, <hi>the righteouſneſs of
God (a),</hi> it is nevertheleſs, <hi>forced</hi> and <hi>compelled</hi>
to miniſter to his <hi>Praiſe.</hi> The Pſalmiſt adds,
<hi>the remainder of wrath ſhalt thou reſtrain:</hi>
That is, GOD will give Way to the Wrath of
Man, and allow it Scope, <hi>ſo far</hi> as it anſwers
his good Purpoſes, and works his Praiſe; the
reſt of it ſhall be curb'd and bound up: When
it would attempt to go beyond its preſcrib'd
Limit, he ſays to it, as to the Waters of the
Sea, <hi>Hitherto ſhalt thou come, but no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and here ſhall thy proud waves be ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
               <note n="b" place="bottom">Jam. i. 20.</note>. All this, the laſt Iſſue of Things ſhall
fully verify and declare: When we ſhall be
able more clearly to trace the divine Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
through its ſeveral Steps, by ſeeing the
Conſummation of the whole. In ſome Caſes,
it may be reſerved for this Period only, to
diſcloſe and unfold the myſterious Wiſdom of
Heaven. But in general, as much of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Conduct and Wiſdom, is at preſent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt,
as gives juſt Ground for this Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that the <hi>wrath of man praiſes God,</hi> now,
before the whole World.<note n="c" place="bottom">Job xxxviii. 11.</note> This was the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0427402000:6"/>
of the Pſalmiſt after Victory and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.
As we, my Brethren, like him, have
lately ſeen the <hi>wrath of man</hi> raging around us,
in all its Violence; and in the midſt of its
Fury have ſeen it reſtrain'd and check'd by
the powerful Hand of GOD; ſuch a Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
muſt be acknowledged very ſuitable and
becoming now: That by ſerious Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Ways of Providence, we may
learn to view theſe Revolutions which befal
Mankind, with the devout Sentiments of our
Pſalmiſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>IN proſecuting this Subject,</hi> I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to illuſtrate and confirm the Obſervation
in my Text; by ſhowing in what Manner the
<hi>wrath of man</hi> is made to <hi>praiſe God.</hi> And
then I ſhall lead your Thoughts to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
we ought to make of ſuch a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation.</p>
            <p>THE different Ways, in which the <hi>wrath
of man</hi> turns out to the <hi>praiſe of God,</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible
chiefly to theſe three. I. As it <hi>mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts</hi> moſt brightly the glorious <hi>Perfections</hi>
of GOD in the Government of the Univerſe.
II. As it <hi>illuſtrates</hi> and <hi>improves</hi> the <hi>Virtues</hi> of good Men; and thus <hi>beautifies</hi> his Church
and People. And, III. As it is made the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0427402000:7"/>
Means of <hi>working</hi> out their greater <hi>Proſperity</hi>
and <hi>Happineſs,</hi> upon the whole.</p>
            <p>I. I ſay, the <hi>wrath of man praiſes God,</hi> as it gives Occaſion for the brighter and more
illuſtrious <hi>Diſcovery of his Perfections,</hi> in the
<hi>Government</hi> of the World.—The <hi>Beauty</hi> and
<hi>Order</hi> of the Univerſe is much heighten'd, by
its being ſo complicated a Syſtem: In which,
there are ſuch a Variety of Springs to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted;
and ſo many different Movements
to be regulated and kept in Order: Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
Intereſts and jarring Paſſions <hi>ballanc'd,</hi>
in ſuch Manner, againſt one another; violent
and unruly Men kept under ſuch a wiſe and
regular <hi>Controul;</hi> and the <hi>wrath of man</hi> made
ſo to know its <hi>Place;</hi> that, how oppoſite ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the ſeveral Motions ſeem to be, yet they
<hi>concur</hi> and meet at laſt in one End. This
renders a Divine Hand <hi>ſenſible</hi> and <hi>illuſtrious:</hi> This opens a more wonderful Proſpect of the
Divine Government, than if all its Subjects
were loyal, and willingly obedient; and makes
that Power and Wiſdom, which can render
ſuch <hi>intractable</hi> Things ſubſervient to the Ends
of Juſtice and Goodneſs, appear ſo much the
more worthy of everlaſting Admiration and
Praiſe. More particularly,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0427402000:8"/>
1. THE <hi>wrath of man</hi> redounds to the
Praiſe of GOD's <hi>almighty Power;</hi> as this is
diſplay'd in his reſtraining and baffling at Pleaſure
all its Fury and Wickedneſs.—To reign
with ſovereign Command, amidſt the moſt
diſorder'd and turbulent State of Things, is
the peculiar Glory of Omnipotence. Hence
we find GOD deſcrib'd in Scripture <hi>ſitting
on the flood, riding on the wings of the wind,
dwelling in the darkneſs and the tempeſt.</hi> As
<hi>he ſtills the raging of the ſeas, and the noiſe of
their waves,</hi> ſo, <hi>he ſtills the tumults of the
people.</hi> When the Paſſions of Men are moſt
<hi>agitated</hi> and <hi>inflamed,</hi> and their violent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
juſt ripe for burſting into Execution;
how oft by ſome unforeſeen. Turn of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
hath he call'd upon Mankind to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
that there is one <hi>higher than the higheſt
on Earth,</hi> who can baffle all their Devices
with the Breath of his Mouth; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the Earth <hi>to be ſtill before him?</hi> When
proud Fleets cover the Ocean, he blows with
his Wind, and they are ſcattered. When
mighty Armies go forth to Battle, in all the
Glory of human Strength, with what <hi>Majeſty</hi>
does an omnipotent Arm ſometimes appear?
—As in the Caſe of haughty <hi>Sennacherib,</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0427402000:9"/>
and that boaſted Tempeſt of Wrath he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to pour upon all the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation:
<hi>I will put my hook,</hi> ſays GOD, <hi>in thy noſe, and
my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back
by the way by which thou cameſt</hi>
               <note n="a" place="bottom">2 Kings xix. 23.</note>. In that
Night the deſtroying Angel ſmote the Hoſt:
And he departed, we are told, with <hi>ſhame of
face to his own land. When the heathen rage,
and the people imagine a vain thing; when the
kings of the earth ſet themſelves, and its rulers
take counſel together; he that ſitteth in the
heavens ſhall laugh: the Lord ſhall hold them
in deriſion: then ſhall he ſpeak to them in
wrath, and vex them in his ſore diſpleaſure</hi>
               <note n="b" place="bottom">Pſal. ii. 1, 2, 4, 5.</note>.
Again,</p>
            <p>2. THE <hi>wrath of man</hi> is made to praiſe the <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> as well as the Power of GOD; when
he makes the unruly Paſſions of bad Men,
<hi>work</hi> in a ſecret Way, towards Ends, by them
altogether unforeſeen. This moſt eminently
diſplays the unſearchable Depths of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Counſel, when we ſee them render'd the
<hi>Miniſters</hi> of Providence, to forward Deſigns
which they intended to deſtroy.—Thus, how
ſurpriſing is it, in the Hiſtory of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> that
the Cruelty of his Brethren, the Lewdneſs
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0427402000:10"/>
and Reſentment of his Miſtreſs, and the Wrath
of <hi>Potiphar,</hi> ſhould all <hi>conſpire</hi> to his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement,
and prove the <hi>Steps,</hi> by which
this perſecuted and friendleſs Man roſe, till he
became the Saviour of all his Kindred? How
remarkably did the <hi>wrath of man</hi> praiſe GOD
in the caſe of <hi>Daniel?</hi> The Malice of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
had thrown him into the Den of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for worſhipping GOD; they preſumed
his Deſtruction accompliſh'd; and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
completely delivered from ſo formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
a Rival; yet this very Event prov'd not
only the Occaſion of <hi>Daniel's</hi> greater Honour,
and their utter Ruin, but of a Decree through
all the Kingdom of the <hi>Medes,</hi> that all Men
ſhould worſhip and fear before the GOD of
<hi>Daniel</hi>
               <note n="a" place="bottom">Dan vi. 25.</note>. Thus GOD <hi>ſnareth the wicked
in the works of their hands</hi>
               <note n="b" place="bottom">Paſl. ix. 16.</note>: And <hi>erects</hi>
his own Counſel upon the Ruin of theirs.
Theſe Things which, view'd apart, appear to
us <hi>Spots</hi> in the divine Adminiſtration, when
conſidered in their <hi>Connection</hi> with all the Train
of ſucceeding Events, often add a great <hi>Luſtre</hi>
and <hi>Beauty</hi> to it. Were our Views extenſive
enough, we ſhould diſcern it always to be thus.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0427402000:11"/>
3. I might obſerve further, that the <hi>wrath
of man</hi> praiſes the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of GOD; in all
theſe Purpoſes of general <hi>Benefit,</hi> both <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral</hi>
and <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> to which his Providence
renders it ſubſervient. But theſe will fall
to be afterwards conſidered; I therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to obſerve,</p>
            <p>4. THAT the <hi>wrath of man</hi> is made to
praiſe the Divine <hi>Juſtice.</hi>—In many Caſes it
is ſufficient for this End, that GOD let looſe
upon bad Men, for their own <hi>Puniſhment,</hi>
theſe angry Paſſions, which make them the
Diſturbers of others. By giving them up to
the Workings of theſe, he opens a Source of
reſtleſs Pain within their Breaſts; and delivers
them over to themſelves, to be their own
<hi>Tormentors.</hi> In thus <hi>connecting</hi> the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with the Crime, cauſing their <hi>own
wickedneſs to reprove them, and their back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidings
to correct them,</hi> the Hand of Juſtice
is plainly ſeen. And tho' the Sinner that
<hi>feels</hi> it, may affect to diſguiſe his Suffering,
yet every one knows that no Puniſhment is
more <hi>real,</hi> or more <hi>intenſe,</hi> than the <hi>inward
Miſery</hi> of a Mind, wrought and torn with

of the Pſalmiſt to receive its Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;

—The <hi>wrath of man</hi> praiſes alſo the Divine
Juſtice, by being the <hi>Inſtrutment</hi> of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>other</hi> ambitious and violent Men. They
are let looſe upon one another to fulfil the
Vengeance of Heaven. One corrupt Nation
is raiſed up againſt another; that <hi>both</hi> may
ſuffer for their Sins. And as there can be no
ſoild nor laſting Bond of Union amongſt wicked
Men, (tho' they may be occaſionally cement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Conſpiracy againſt the Good) their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
interfering Views and Intereſts, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them, in the juſt <hi>Judgment</hi> of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
a Prey to mutual Jealouſy, Strife and
Fraud.—Finally, the Juſtice of GOD is
praiſed in the <hi>Vengeance,</hi> which, ſooner or
later, he executes againſt the Wrath and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of Sinners. They may go on for a
Time, and appear to proſper: The Juſtice of
Heaven may ſeem to ſlumber: but it is <hi>awake:</hi>
and only waits till the <hi>meaſure of their iniquity
be full.</hi> How oft has the World been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened
to the Obſervation of the awful Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0427402000:13"/>
of GOD, by the ſudden Fall and
Deſtruction of Tyrants? GOD repreſents him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in Scripture, as permitting Wickedneſs
ſometimes to ariſe to an over-grown Height,
on Purpoſe that its Ruin may be the <hi>greater,</hi> and the more <hi>aſtoniſhing. For this cauſe</hi> he
tells that wicked Prince <hi>Pharaoh, he had raiſed
him up,</hi> that is, allowed him to proſper and
be exalted, <hi>that he might ſhew in him his
power; and that his name might be declared
throughout all the earth</hi>
               <note n="a" place="bottom">Exod, ix. 16.</note>. The Divine Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
is glorified as well in the <hi>ſtrange
Puniſhment</hi> he hath decreed for the Workers
of Iniquity, as in the <hi>Reward</hi> he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for the Righteous. This is <hi>the purpoſe
which the Lord hath purpoſed upon all the
earth: and this is the hand that ſtretched
forth over all the nations</hi>
               <note n="b" place="bottom">Iſa. xiv, 26.</note>!</p>
            <p>THUS the <hi>wrath of man</hi> is made to <hi>praiſe
God,</hi> by giving Mankind <hi>deep Impreſſions</hi> of that
infinite <hi>Power, Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> that governs
the World. Such Impreſſions it is neceſſary
for Mankind to have; and, in their preſent
imperfect State, they can only receive them
from ſomething that is <hi>ſenſible</hi> and <hi>ſtriking.</hi> The Commotions and Diſorders of the World,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0427402000:14"/>
open a Field for <hi>ſignalizing</hi> the Divine Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
more, than if all Things went on
in a <hi>quiet undiſturbed</hi> Tenor. The Waters
muſt be ſometimes <hi>troubled,</hi> that we may <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend</hi>
to that Hand which ſtills their Raging:
and <hi>Clouds</hi> muſt ariſe, that the heavenly
Light which diſpels them, may <hi>ſtrike</hi> our
Eye with the more ſenſible <hi>Brightneſs.</hi> We
further obſerved,</p>
            <p>II. THAT the <hi>wrath of man</hi> may be juſtly
ſaid to praiſe GOD, by that Tendency which
he gives it to <hi>improve</hi> and <hi>illuſtrate</hi> the <hi>Virtues</hi>
of good Men; and thereby to <hi>beautify</hi> his
Church and People. Now it hath this Effect,</p>
            <p>1. As it is employed by GOD to be the
Means of <hi>correcting</hi> good Men for their Faults.
Theſe <hi>Storms,</hi> which Ambition and Pride raiſe
among Mankind, he permits, with the ſame
Intention, that he ſends forth <hi>Tempeſts</hi> and
<hi>Hurricanes</hi> amongſt the Elements; to clear
the Atmoſphere of noxious Vapours, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify
it from that <hi>Corruption</hi> which all Things
contract by too much Reſt. Bad Men appear
ſometimes to have obtained entire Power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Juſt: they exerciſe their Tyranny,
perhaps, with a very heavy and oppreſſive
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0427402000:15"/>
Hand: the Juſt complain and groan; and in the
Bitterneſs of their Soul, can hardly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to exclaim; "<hi>Where</hi> is the Lord? And
where the <hi>Sceptre</hi> of <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> and
<hi>Truth? Hath God forgotten to be gracious?</hi>
Or doth he indeed <hi>ſee,</hi> and <hi>is there know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in the Moſt High?</hi>"—Their Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
are really no more than the Inſtruments
of GOD to them for <hi>Good:</hi> He ſees they ſtand
in <hi>Need</hi> of ſuch Correction; and therefore
raiſes them up Enemies, to cure the Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Proſperity; And by that Seriouſneſs
which Affliction is fitted to introduce into the
Mind, to lead them to think of themſelves,
of their Duty, and their paſt Errors. In this
Way the Diſturbers of the Earth are often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
to us in Scripture; as <hi>Scourges</hi> in the
Hand of GOD, ſent forth to do his Work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a degenerating People: They are employed
in the Execution of righteous and wiſe Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<hi>concealed</hi> from themſelves; and, when
their Commiſſion is fulfilled, recalled and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed.
Of this we have a remarkable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
in the King of <hi>Aſſyria. I will ſend him,
ſays</hi> GOD, <hi>against an hypocritical nation, and
againſt the people of my wrath, will I give him
a charge, to take the ſpoil and to take the prey:
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0427402000:16"/>
—howbeit he meaneth not ſo, neither doth his
heart think ſo; but it is in his heart to deſtroy
and cut off nations not a few.—Wherefore it
ſhall come to paſs, that when the Lord hath
performed his whole work upon mount Zion
and on Jeruſalem, I will punish the fruit of the
ſtout heart of the king of Aſſyria, and the glory
of his high looks</hi>
               <note n="a" place="bottom">Iſa. x. 6, 7, 12.</note>. Vainly then doth the
<hi>warth of man</hi> lift itſelf up againſt GOD.—
<hi>Shall the ax boaſt itſelf againſt him that hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
therewith? Or ſhall the ſaw magnify it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
againſt him that ſhaketh it?</hi>
               <note n="b" place="bottom">Iſa. x. 15.</note>—<hi>All
things,</hi> whether they will or not, muſt <hi>work
together for good to them that love God.</hi>—This
amongſt the reſt, fills up the Place aſſign'd it,
by the <hi>Ordination</hi> of Heaven;—and the
proudeſt Conqueror, and the moſt oppreſſive
Tyrant, poſſeſs only the ſame <hi>Station,</hi> with
the Famine, the Peſtilence, and the Flood:
their <hi>Triumphs</hi> are no more than the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment
of GOD's Correction: And <hi>the
remainder of their wrath ſhall he reſtrain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. GOD makes the <hi>wrath of man</hi> to praiſe
him, not only by employing it in Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but as the Inſtrument of <hi>improving</hi> and
<hi>ſignalizing</hi> the Graces of good Men; and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0427402000:17"/>
thereby raiſing them to higher <hi>Honour</hi> and
<hi>Glory.</hi>—Had there been no Perſecutors and
Tyrants, no Oppreſſors of Liberty, no wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and furious Men in the World, what a
Number of <hi>great</hi> and <hi>worthy</hi> Actions had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
been heard of? What ſhining Examples
of Fortitude, Conſtancy and Patience, had
been loſt to the World? What a Field of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
<hi>peculiar</hi> to a State of Improvement and
Diſcipline, had lain uncultivated?—Spirits
of a higher Order poſſeſs a State of <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi>
Virtue, that ſtands in Need of no ſuch <hi>Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
and <hi>Trials.</hi> But to <hi>us,</hi> who are only
under Education for ſuch a State, it <hi>belongs</hi> to
paſs through the Furnace, that our Souls may
be <hi>tried, refined,</hi> and <hi>brightened.</hi> We muſt
ſtand the <hi>Conflict,</hi> that we may be graced and
crowned as <hi>Conquerors.</hi> The <hi>wrath of man</hi> gives
the Occaſion, and the Field;—calls us forth
to the moſt conſpicuous and diſtinguiſhed Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of <hi>active</hi> Virtue,—and forms us to all
thoſe <hi>ſuffering</hi> Graces which are amongſt the
brighteſt Ornaments of the human Soul. When
unjuſt Attempts are carried on againſt our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Intereſts, theſe give us the Means of diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
true publick Spirit, and Love to our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
When we ſuffer in our private Concerns,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0427402000:18"/>
there our Enemies put it into our Power
to gain the nobleſt Conqueſt, by overcoming
the World; and to make ourſelves greater than
the greateſt Man who injures us by forgiving
him. When we ſuffer for the Sake of Truth
and a good Conſcience, there we have the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable
Opportunity afforded us, of gaining Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
truly immortal, by being Witneſſes for
GOD, and maintaining an exemplary and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roic
Fidelity. In all this <hi>the wrath of man
praiſes God.</hi>—Every ſingle Inſtance, in which
our Souls are improv'd, or ſome Action of
diſtinguiſhed Goodneſs is produced, by Means
of <hi>the wrath of man,</hi> redounds moſt highly,
both to our <hi>own Good,</hi> and to <hi>his Praiſe,</hi> who
hath <hi>order'd</hi> Things in this Manner for our
<hi>Improvement.</hi>—'Tis thus, the illuſtrious Band
of Patriots and Heroes, of Confeſſors and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
have been ſet forth to the Admiration of
all Ages, as <hi>the lights of the world:</hi> Whilſt the
Violence and Fury of Enemies, inſtead of
bearing them down, has only ſerv'd to exalt
and dignify them the more.—We proceed
now to the</p>
            <p>III. VIEW we propoſed to give of the <hi>wrath
of man praiſing God;</hi> when Providence makes
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0427402000:19"/>
it the Mean of <hi>working</hi> out greater <hi>Proſperity</hi>
and <hi>Happineſs,</hi> upon the whole, to his People
and Church.—I ſay, the Violence of <hi>Enemies,</hi>
the Rage of <hi>Perſecutors,</hi> and the Oppreſſion
of <hi>Tyrants,</hi> not only tend, in the Way of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and religious Improvement to the <hi>better<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
of our Souls; but alſo are often made,
in their Conſequences, to produce other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look'd
for Bleſſings to good Men <hi>in this State.</hi>
As this is no rare nor unfrequent Thing, we
ſhall point out ſome Inſtances in which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears.
Thus,</p>
            <p>THE Hardſhips which good Men ſuffer
from others in their <hi>private</hi> Concerns, are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
ſeen to <hi>give Birth</hi> to their ſucceeding Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity.
Many Exemplifications of this we
find in Hiſtory. The unfortunate Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of <hi>Moſes's</hi> Birth, thro' the Cruelty of
an <hi>Egyptian</hi> Tyrant, were the Means of this
expoſed Infant's being bred up as a King's Son,
and of his being <hi>accompliſh'd</hi> for his future
great Atchievements, with all the Wiſdom
and Learning of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Court. The
Inſolence and proud Reſentment of <hi>Haman</hi>
pav'd the Way for the Advancement of <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai</hi>
his Enemy, at the very critical Time
When he thought his Deſigns ripe for ſinking
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0427402000:20"/>
him into Ruin: And his cruel Scheme for
the Deſtruction of <hi>Mordecai</hi>'s whole Nation,
prov'd the Occaſion of their being raiſed above
<hi>all</hi> their Enemies. <hi>There are many devices in
the heart of a man, but the counſel of the Lord
ſhall ſtand</hi>
               <note n="a" place="bottom">Prov. xix. 21.</note>. He, <hi>connecting</hi> together each
Link in the Chain of Events that fill up our
Life, by an unexpected <hi>Contexture</hi> of Cauſes,
makes thoſe Things which we moſt deplore
<hi>bring on</hi> our better Days: And, in the dark
Boſom of Misfortune, gradually <hi>ripens</hi> the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Seeds of future Proſperity.—How fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
have the Attempts of Enemies to run
down and <hi>blacken</hi> good Men by all the Arts
of Malice, made their Character ſhine the
<hi>fairer</hi> in the Eye of the impartial World?
How frequently have the <hi>Extremities</hi> to which
they have been driven by Injuſtice and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
prov'd the Occaſion of calling forth
their <hi>Courage</hi> and <hi>Activity,</hi> and of putting
them upon ſuch <hi>Efforts</hi> to do themſelves Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
as have raiſed them higher than ever
they fell? How many, in the Courſe of their
Life, have had Reaſon to be <hi>thankful</hi> for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
diſappointed by the Wrath of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
in Deſigns, which, perhaps, they very
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0427402000:21"/>
               <hi>earneſtly</hi> purſued; but which, if they had
<hi>ſuccceſsfully</hi> accompliſh'd, they have afterwards
ſeen would have prov'd their <hi>Ruin? Whoſo is
wiſe and will obſerve theſe things, even he ſhall
understand the loving-kindneſs of the Lord</hi>
               <note n="a" place="bottom">Pſal. cvii. 34.</note>.</p>
            <p>BUT if thus, in <hi>private</hi> Life, the <hi>wrath of
man</hi> is often made to praiſe GOD, by becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Occaſion of greater Good; ſtill more
is the Hand of GOD apparent, in the Ends of
<hi>publick Benefit</hi> it is made to ſerve, to <hi>Nations</hi>
and <hi>Societies.</hi>—The Rage of Civil Wars, the
Oppreſſion of Tyrants, and all the other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Effects of the Ambition and Wrath of
Man, have often ſung the Praiſe of GOD to
many ſucceeding Generations. Thence have
been made to ſpring, publick <hi>Liberty</hi> to a
People, wiſe <hi>Government,</hi> good <hi>Order,</hi> and
laſting <hi>Peace.</hi> Nations have been thereby a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken'd
to ſee their <hi>true Intereſts;</hi> and taught
more effectually to <hi>ſecure</hi> them. Publick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
being once thrown into a <hi>Ferment,</hi> the
Corruptions of Government, like bad Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
in the Body, have been purg'd and
wrought off. The Feeling of grievous Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
has frequently been the firſt Thing
that made Nations <hi>ſhake off</hi> the <hi>Yoke;</hi> and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0427402000:22"/>
led them to aſſert their own <hi>juſt Rights</hi> againſt
tyrannical Governors; <hi>which,</hi> had their Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
been leſs inſolent, theſe Nations would
have remain'd longer, perhaps for ever, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd
of.</hi> Of this we have a memorable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
in the late glorious and happy <hi>Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
in our own Country. Our Conſtitution,
and its Liberties, might have been <hi>inſenſibly
undermined,</hi> and <hi>ruined,</hi> had it not been for
the glaring and open Violation of Laws with
a high Hand; which proclaiming all to be <hi>then</hi>
at Stake, rouz'd up the Spirits of Men to
rnake a determin'd Stand againſt incroaching
<hi>Tyranny:</hi> and thus gave Birth to that <hi>free</hi>
and <hi>legal Establiſhment,</hi> with which we at
this Day are bleſſed; and for which, we hope,
late Poſterity after us, ſhall continue to bleſs
the Providence of GOD. Had it not been for
the <hi>avow'd</hi> Attempts then made againſt our
Religion. and our fundamental Rights <hi>Britain</hi>
might have been now under a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign:
and, inſtead of that mild and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Adminiſtration we have enjoyed, under a
Series of Princes who have always made the
Law their Rule, we would have been the
Subjects, or rather <hi>Slaves,</hi> of thoſe who arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly
claim us as their <hi>Property</hi> by <hi>Divine
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0427402000:23"/>
Right.</hi> In like Manner, the Tyranny and
Violence of <hi>Tarquin,</hi> produced the illuſtrious
and victorious Commonwealth of <hi>Rome.</hi> The
Oppreſſion of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> laid the
Foundation of the Liberty of the <hi>United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces;</hi>
and Liberty, from a few inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Fiſher-towns, has raiſed them to the
moſt flouriſhing Height of Trade and Opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.
—As to the firſt <hi>Eſtabliſhment</hi> of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
ſo to the further <hi>Security</hi> of a publick
Intereſt, unjuſt and violent Deſigns have been
often ſubſervient. Attempts to <hi>overthrow</hi> a
good Government, have generally <hi>ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi>
it more. By theſe its falſe Friends are
<hi>unmasked</hi> and brought to Light; its ſecret
Foes ſuffer for their Treachery: the <hi>Zeal</hi> of
its Well-wiſhers is awakened and increaſed;
and, from what is felt of the <hi>Violence</hi> and
<hi>Outrage</hi> of its Enemies, People are more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
in <hi>Abhorrence</hi> of their Deſigns, and
made more juſtly to prize the Bleſſings of
<hi>Tranquillity</hi> and <hi>legal Protection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FURTHER, the <hi>wrath of man,</hi> in the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution</hi>
of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> ſignally praiſes
GOD, when it is made to turn to the greater
<hi>Advancement</hi> of Religion, and further Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of Truth.—The Church of GOD, ſince
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0427402000:24"/>
the Days of its Infancy, hath never been free
from the World's Wrath; and yet, in theſe
Ages in which it was moſt <hi>perſecuted,</hi> it hath
moſt <hi>flouriſhed.</hi> In vain, the Policy and the
Rage of the World united their Strength, to
extinguiſh this Divine Light. Tho' all the
four Winds blew againſt it, it only ſhone the
brighter; and flam'd the higher: <hi>Many wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
could not quench it, nor all the floods drown
it:</hi> and the Blood of the Martyrs, as has
been often and juſtly ſaid, was the Seed of
the Church. The <hi>Zeal</hi> of the primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
their <hi>Conſtancy</hi> and <hi>Fortitude</hi> in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Teſtimony to Truth, and their chearful
<hi>Patience</hi> in ſuffering for it, did much more
to <hi>increaſe</hi> the Number of Converts to true
Religion, than all the <hi>Terror</hi> and <hi>Cruelty</hi> of
Perſecutors could ever do to <hi>leſſen</hi> it. The At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
that were uſed to bear down Religion,
only enlarg'd its Triumphs, by diſplaying the
victorious Force of Truth. By this Means
the <hi>wrath of man</hi> was made to turn <hi>againſt it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi>
to the Deſtruction of its own Purpoſe;—
like Waves, that, aſſaulting a Rock with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
Fury, diſcover its immoveable Stabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
whilſt they daſh themſelves in Pieces at
its Feet. Proſperity, Greatneſs, and worldly
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0427402000:25"/>
Favour may have corrupted Religion, and
ſullied the Purity of the Church: But, never
did the <hi>wrath of man</hi> try to overthrow it, but
in the Iſſue it made its own Weakneſs appear;
and rais'd the <hi>praiſe of God,</hi> by purifying the
Church, and advancing Religion more.</p>
            <p>I SHALL only add one Inſtance more of
the <hi>wrath of man</hi> praiſing GOD, by accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing
Ends of moſt extenſive Benefit: and
that is, <hi>the Death of</hi> JESUS CHRIST.—Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
did Malice, Rage and Envy pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with the Thoughts of having obtain'd
a more complete Triumph, than in this Caſe.
JESUS was now put to Death; the Revenge
of his Enemies gratified; his Name, and his
Honour, they believ'd, rooted out from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
Men;—yet, behold how vain the
<hi>wrath of man</hi> is! all that they intended to
<hi>overthrow,</hi> they moſt effectually <hi>confirm'd.</hi>
The <hi>Ignominy</hi> of the Croſs became the
Standard of <hi>eternal Honour</hi> to CHRIST, and
his Religion: and his <hi>Death,</hi> perpetrated by
them as a wicked Murder, was, in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
of GOD, the Spring of <hi>everlaſting Life</hi> to
all his Followers. He, who <hi>reſtrains the
Remainder of Wrath</hi> at his Pleaſure, ſuffer'd
their Rage to ſuggeſt no <hi>other</hi> Things to them,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0427402000:26"/>
than what himſelf had long before determin'd,
and his Prophets foretold, ſhould be ſo done.
So that they all <hi>conſpir'd</hi> to render the whole
moſt exactly conformable to his <hi>original Plan</hi>
of Mercy and Goodneſs; and each contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
his <hi>Share,</hi> to finiſh that great Work,
which none of them <hi>knew</hi> any thing of, nor
in the leaſt <hi>intended.</hi>—So <hi>glorious</hi> an Inſtance
as this, fully <hi>aſcertain'd</hi> and laid out to us in
Scripture, of the <hi>wrath of man</hi> miniſtring to
the gracious Deſigns of Heaven, ought to
have the greateſt Weight; as an <hi>Exemplifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the Conduct of Providence in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>other Caſes,</hi> where we have not ſo much
Light afforded us for the Diſcovery of its
Ways.</p>
            <p>AND now, by this Induction of Particulars,
you ſee, upon the whole, how much Ground
there is for aſſerting, that the <hi>wrath of man
ſhall praiſe God;</hi> that all the Diſorders
which the Paſſion and Pride of Men occaſion
in the World, tho' they take their firſt <hi>Riſe</hi>
from the Corruption of human Nature, are ſo
<hi>order'd,</hi> as to become Parts of a wiſe and
good Conſtitution, redounding to his Honour
and Glory, who hath order'd all.—Either illuſtrating
before the World, his <hi>Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0427402000:27"/>
in the Government of Things;—or
ſerving the Purpoſes of <hi>moral</hi> and <hi>religious
Improvement</hi> to the Souls of Men;—or by
ſome ſecret Tendency, <hi>working out Proſperity
and Happineſs</hi> to thoſe whom they ſeem moſt
to threaten with Suffering and Evil.—<hi>Surely,
O GOD, the wrath of man. ſhall praiſe thee!
the remainder of wrath ſhalt thou reſtrain!</hi>
"In thy Hand it is; and thou never lets it
forth but in <hi>Weight</hi> and <hi>Meaſure.</hi> It is
<hi>wild</hi> and <hi>intractable</hi> in its Nature; but thou
<hi>tameſt</hi> it: <hi>blind</hi> and <hi>headlong</hi> in its Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe;
but thou <hi>directeſt</hi> it: ever <hi>ſtruggling</hi>
to break its Chain, knowing no Bounds; but
thou <hi>confineſt</hi> it: Thou <hi>retrencheſt</hi> all the
<hi>Superfluity of its Fury!"</hi>—Let us now
conſider, what is the Improvement to be made
of this Meditation on the Ways of Providence.</p>
            <p>1. Let it lead us to a religious Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Hand of God,</hi> in all the Occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Tranſactions of the World. We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
a very mixed and buſy Scene of Things
paſſing before us: the Paſſions of Men vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
agitated and new Changes daily brought
forth upon this Stage of Time. We behold
Peace and War taking their Turns: the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0427402000:28"/>
Fortunes of private Men riſing and falling:
and Nations and Kingdoms partaking in the
ſame Fluctuation and Viciſſitude. In all this,
if we look no farther than to the Operation
of external Cauſes, and the mere Rotation of,
Events, we behold only the dead Side of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
—ſtop at the Surface of Things;—
contemplate them not like rational and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Beings. The <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Beauty</hi> of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſe
ariſes from the View of that Wiſdom
and Goodneſs, which <hi>animates</hi> and <hi>conducts</hi>
the whole; and <hi>unites</hi> all the Parts in one
great Deſign. There is an eternal Mind that
puts all theſe Wheels in Motion; himſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
for ever at Reſt. Of him we are to
conceive not as removed from this World;
ſitting, a mere Spectator of his Creatures, in
his high Abode: but as an omnipreſent Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<hi>pervading, directing,</hi> and <hi>regulating</hi> all;
ever buſy without <hi>Toil,</hi> and working without
<hi>Wearineſs!</hi> Nothing is void of him: even in
the Paſſions and Ragings of Men, GOD is to
be found: and when they think they guide
themſelves, his Hand controuls and guides
them ſtill.—To what ſerious and ſolemn
Thoughts are we led by ſuch a View as this;
when we attend not merely to the Actings of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0427402000:29"/>
Men, but to the Ways of GOD; deeply im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
with the Belief, that we and all our
Concerns are Parts of his great Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration!</p>
            <p>2. FROM what has been ſaid we ſee, that
we ought not to be ſhaken in our Minds,
by any preſent <hi>ſeeming Diſorders</hi> of the
World, ſo as on Account of them to think ill
of Providence. Many Things, doubtleſs, there
are, which appear as <hi>Blemiſhes</hi> in the general
Order, to a ſuperficial View; and which, if
we were to regulate the World, we think
ſhould have <hi>no Place</hi> in it. And yet, theſe
various Inſtances, which we <hi>ſee,</hi> and can clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>trace,</hi> of the Workings of Paſſion and Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs,
render'd ſubſervient to worthy and
good Ends, give us the higheſt Reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that, in all other Caſes of ſeeming Evil,
the like Ends are promoted. This ought to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy
our Minds, even where the Proſpect is moſt
<hi>diſcouraging,</hi> and the State of human Affairs
moſt <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>embroil'd.</hi> The Schemes of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Wiſdom are too <hi>large</hi> and <hi>comprehenſive,</hi>
to be diſcerned by us, in all their Extent, at
one View; and, where we ſee only by <hi>Parts,</hi>
we muſt be often at a Loſs to judge of the
<hi>Whole. The way of God is in the ſea, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0427402000:30"/>
his path in the great waters: his footſteps are
not known<note n="a" place="bottom">Pſal. lxxvii. 19.</note>. Although thou ſayeſt thou
canſt not ſee him, yet judgment is ſtill before
him, therefore truſt thou in him</hi>
               <note n="b" place="bottom">Job xxxv. 14.</note>. His it
is, to educe Good from Ill, Order from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuiſion,
his own juſt Praiſe from Man's Wrath.
As in the natural World, there is no <hi>real</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity;
nothing but what has either its own
Ornament or Uſe: ſo, the moſt irregular and
deformed <hi>Appearances</hi> in the moral World,
ſhall be made to <hi>heighten</hi> the Beauty of the
whole: And, in the End, <hi>all</hi> the Works of
GOD ſhall appear to be perfect. GOD <hi>binds</hi>
together the moſt oppoſite and diſagreeing
Principles in the Laws of univerſal <hi>Concord:</hi>
and <hi>adapts,</hi> even the moſt harſh and diſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
Notes, to the <hi>Harmony</hi> of his Goodneſs.
As he hath rear'd the goodly Frame of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
from <hi>various</hi> and <hi>jarring</hi> Elements, and
hath ſettled it in Peace; ſo he hath formed
ſuch an <hi>Union,</hi> by his Providence, of the <hi>more
various</hi> Intereſts, and <hi>more jarring</hi> Paſſions of
Men, that they all <hi>conſpire</hi> to his Glory, and
<hi>co-operate</hi> for the general Good.—How a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing
is that Wiſdom, which comprehends
ſuch infinite <hi>Diverſities,</hi> and <hi>Contrarieties,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0427402000:31"/>
its Scheme! How powerful that Hand,
which <hi>bends</hi> to its own Purpoſe, the Good and
the Bad, the Buſy and the Idle, the Friends
and the Foes of GOD; which makes them <hi>all</hi>
hold on their Courſe to his Glory, tho' <hi>divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from one another</hi> by a Multiplicity of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits,
and <hi>differing</hi> often <hi>from themſelves;</hi> and
whilſt they all move themſelves at their <hi>own
Freedom,</hi> yet, by a ſecret Influence, winds
and turns them at <hi>his Will! O the depth of
the riches both of the wiſdom and knowledge of
God! how unſearchable are his judgments,
and his ways paſt finding out</hi>
               <note n="a" place="bottom">Rom. xi. 33.</note>!</p>
            <p>3. From what has been ſaid, we ſee the
greateſt Reaſon for <hi>entire Submiſſion</hi> to the
Will of Heaven, amidſt all Sufferings from
the <hi>Wrath</hi> and Violence of Men. Theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal
us not <hi>in vain:</hi> they are not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
as mere Effects of the arbitrary <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi>
and <hi>Will of Men:</hi> nor are we to believe
ourſelves the <hi>Sport</hi> of <hi>Fortune</hi> and <hi>Paſſion.</hi>
But, good Deſigns are <hi>going on:</hi> GOD is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
carrying forward his <hi>own Ends:</hi> And if
we are certainly aſſured that all is tending to
<hi>his Glory,</hi> which is ever the ſame with the
<hi>general Good,</hi> is not this a ſufficient Reaſon for
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0427402000:32"/>
the moſt peaceable <hi>Acquieſcence</hi> on our Part?
Ought not we, as <hi>Parts</hi> of the <hi>Whole,</hi> chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to reſign our <hi>private</hi> Intereſt, to the
Advancement of a <hi>higher</hi> and more <hi>general
Good?</hi>—But moreover, by this Reſignation,
our <hi>own Intereſt</hi> ſhall ſuffer nothing in the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue.
For the greatest Happineſs of <hi>every</hi> good
Man, of <hi>each Individual,</hi> as well as of <hi>the
whole,</hi> is comprehended in that <hi>Praiſe</hi> which
the <hi>wrath of man</hi> is decreed to yield to GOD.
—Hence ought to ariſe, not unreluctant <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi>
only, but the moſt exalted <hi>Joy</hi> in the
Divine Adminiſtration, to all who are pious
and virtuous. In <hi>all Events,</hi> their Intereſt is
ſecur'd; and the ſevereſt Trials of Life are to
them Matter even of <hi>Thankfulneſs</hi> and <hi>Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi>
when view'd in their juſt Light. For,
in theſe very Trials, their Advantage is <hi>conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi>
by them is their Good <hi>promoted;</hi> and the
moſt hurtful Deſigns of the Wrath of Man are
<hi>converted</hi> into <hi>Benefits</hi> and <hi>Bleſſings.</hi>—Let this
be enough to reconcile our Minds to every
Part of our Lot; and to eſtabliſh them in the
moſt comforting <hi>Truſt</hi> and <hi>Confidence,</hi> in
GOD, in the Way of our Duty.—<hi>If God be
for us who,</hi> or what, <hi>can be againſt us?</hi> He
who can defeat all the Purpoſes of our <hi>Enemies,</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0427402000:33"/>
and transform their <hi>intended Evil</hi> unto <hi>real
Good,</hi> is certainly the moſt powerful <hi>Friend:</hi>
And if <hi>his Wrath</hi> be once, appeas'd, there is
no <hi>other Wrath</hi> from which we have ought
to fear.</p>
            <p>4. FROM all that has been ſaid of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of Providence, let us obſerve, how much
Reaſon there is for acknowledging with Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
the Hand of GOD, in all theſe <hi>Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances,</hi>
which we obtain from the <hi>wrath of
man.</hi> As we ought never to forget, when we
ſuffer by human Violence, that it is his Hand
which <hi>corrects</hi> us; ſo, when that Violence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
a Check, we ought to remember, it is
his Hand which <hi>reſtrains</hi> it. In <hi>both</hi> theſe,
the <hi>wrath of man,</hi> either <hi>permitted,</hi> or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd,</hi>
praiſes GOD: and we have ſeen him
remarkably prais'd <hi>in both.</hi>—Through all the
Steps of our late <hi>Sufferings,</hi> and our preſent
happy <hi>Deliverance,</hi> ſuch a <hi>Series</hi> of Divine
Wiſdom hath appear'd, as muſt preſent, to the
Obſervation of every <hi>conſidering</hi> Spectator, a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>beautiful Scene</hi> in the Hiſtory of Providence.
—GOD beheld a Nation, whom he had fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
with long Tranquillity and Peace, ſunk,
by that Peace and Tranquillity, into <hi>Luxury</hi>
and <hi>Corruption of Manners.</hi> He had bleſs'd
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0427402000:34"/>
them with a happy Conſtitution, a mild Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and equal Laws; but long Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
had <hi>deaden'd</hi> their <hi>Senſe</hi> of ſo invaluable
a Bleſſing, and fed a <hi>giddy</hi> and <hi>factious Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>
He had diſtinguiſh'd them with the
pureſt Enjoyment of pure Religion above moſt
Nations of the Earth; but their religious Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges,
<hi>once</hi> ſtruggled for with Zeal, began
to be <hi>contemn'd</hi> and their <hi>firſt Love to cool.</hi>—
Behold, how <hi>opportunely</hi> GOD ſent forth the
<hi>wrath of man,</hi> to work a Cure for all theſe
Evils;—to ſhake <hi>that Peace</hi> which had foſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Luxury</hi> and <hi>Impiety</hi> under its Wings; to
threaten <hi>that Religion,</hi> and <hi>that Government,</hi>
to the Bleſſings of which we had beeninſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible;
and to diſplay before us theſe Terrors
of <hi>oppreſſive Power,</hi> and <hi>perſecuting Religion,</hi>
to the Danger of which we had been laid
aſleep:—He made us <hi>feel</hi> the Value of all we
ſhould have loſt;—he made the Evil to grow
<hi>ſudden</hi> and <hi>unexpected,</hi> from amongſt ourſelves,
and allowing it to proceed ſo far, as might be
ſufficient to <hi>awaken</hi> the Nation, and to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
us <hi>ſerious</hi> and <hi>wiſe,</hi> he then gave a ſignal
Check to the <hi>wrath of man;</hi> and <hi>reſtrain'd the
remainder of it,</hi> after it had gone the Length
which he ſaw meet. Our Enemies boaſted
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0427402000:35"/>
of the <hi>Favour</hi> and <hi>Countenance</hi> of Heaven:
<hi>Countenanced</hi> they were by Heaven, but not
for their <hi>own Sakes;</hi> and the Succeſs permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them for a Time, was meant for the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement</hi>
and <hi>Benefit</hi> of <hi>thoſe,</hi> whom they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to <hi>deſtroy.</hi> When the proper <hi>Seaſon</hi>
was come, for GOD to aſſert his own Cauſe,
then he rais'd up an illuſtrious <hi>Deliverer,</hi>
whom, for a Bleſſing to his Country, he had
prepared againſt this <hi>Time of Need.</hi> HIM, he
crowned with the Graces of his <hi>Right-hand:</hi>
to the conſpicuous <hi>Bravery</hi> of early <hi>Youth,</hi> he
added that <hi>Conduct</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> which, in
others, is the Fruit only of <hi>long Experience;</hi>
and diſtinguiſh'd Him with all thoſe <hi>Qualities</hi>
which render the <hi>Man,</hi> amiable; as well, as the
HERO, Great: He ſent him forth to be the
<hi>Terror</hi> of his Foes, the <hi>Confidence</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> of
his Friends; and, in the Day of Danger and
Death, commanded the <hi>Shields of Angels</hi> to be
ſpread around him!—What Heart, in which
the Love of BRITISH Liberty remains, <hi>warms</hi>
not at the Mention of his Name?—Whoſe
Boſom overflows not with <hi>Gratitude,</hi> when
he looks back upon the late dark and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
Scenes of <hi>Oppreſſion</hi> and <hi>Terror,</hi> and
ſurveys the fair Proſpect now open'd, by this
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0427402000:36"/>
choſen <hi>Inſtrument</hi> of our Deliverance, of <hi>Peace</hi>
reſtored, <hi>Liberty</hi> flouriſhing, and <hi>Religion</hi>
ſafe?—Let us lift up our Eyes to Heaven,
and ſay, <hi>This is the doing of the Lord, and it
is marvellous in our eyes</hi>
               <note n="a" place="bottom">Pſal. cxviii. 23.</note>!—HIM, the
<hi>wrath of man</hi> hath indeed ſignally <hi>prais'd,</hi> in
our Land: <hi>Prais'd</hi> him, when it rag'd; and
<hi>prais'd</hi> him, when it fell!—<hi>When he aroſe, his
enemies were ſcattered; as ſmoke is driven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and as chaff before the wind.—Give unto
the Lord, ye mighty, give unto the Lord glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and ſtrength</hi>
               <note n="b" place="bottom">Pſal. xxix. 1.</note>! <hi>He breaketh the bow, and
