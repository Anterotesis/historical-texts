            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Vid. Cat.</note> is what I mightily doubt of. Conſider, Sir, I beſeech you, what a deal of Money that ſtrong Fort has coſt him; how he has perpetually annoy'd you from that Coaſt, and—</p>

Nay, even the Conſtables of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh have drunk ſo deep of his Cup, that they make no ſcruple to declare to you, that, as they are Conſtables they are <hi>accountable</hi> to no Man; but that all <hi>England</hi> is <hi>account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> to them; and this they will tell you with an Air of Inſolence.

               <p>What is not every Man free to ſet up for a Politician, eſpecially when he is ſure of his own Sufficiency, and has all the Reaſon in the World to be under <hi>Horrible Expectations.</hi>

               <p>A Politician! yes, provided it be in his Study. He may there indeed pull down and erect, praiſe and condemn, and in ſhort, make a Conſtitution Hereditary or Elective, as he ſhall think fit; but I muſt inſiſt he has no Right openly to revile a Miniſtry, becauſe he likes not the Faces of thoſe that compoſe it, which perhaps may be as good as his own, tho' not yet in Print in <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Shop. Beſides, Sir, every Man in his way: Mr. <hi>Iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides</hi> underſtands <hi>Latin,</hi> underſtands the Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſics, has writ three Comedies <hi>alias</hi> Farces, has din'd with a great Lord, and been at the burning of ſeveral Popes; but what has this to do with Government? Mr. <hi>Dogget,</hi> I allow you may divert us in low Comedy, but can never make a tolerable Figure with

the Buskin and Truncheon—What, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, would Mr. <hi>Ironſides</hi> think, if <hi>Will. Pinkethman</hi> ſhould take a fancy to play <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> if at the beginning of the ſecond Act he ſhould rudely break in, and diſturb Mr. <hi>Booth,</hi> and his little Senate, and talk of his <hi>liberal Education,</hi> of his being a grave Man and fit for Tragedy, ſure neither <hi>He</hi> nor his Circle of Pupils could forgive ſuch an Impertinence.</p>

               <p>Come, come, you are for ſtopping the Mouths of People, and reſtraining the Liberty of the Preſs; a ſure Sign, Mr. <hi>Toby,</hi> your Actions won't bear the Light.</p>

               <p>As for ſtopping Mr. <hi>Ironſides</hi>'s Mouth, I don't think it of moment enough to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it; but you know, Friend, it would be leſs offenſive, were it ſomewhat more clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, therefore I'll compound for waſhing it.</p>

               <p>Nay, provided it be clean, let him do what he will with it—But I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe him to return to his old inoffenſive way of Life.</p>

               <p>All this is very pretty; but really, Sir, theſe Trifles are not for Senators, No, we ſhall hear from Mr. <hi>Ironſides</hi> in another manner—Mr. <hi>Ironſide</hi>'s firſt Speech in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, come a half-peny a piece—Or elſe perhaps, Mr. <hi>Ironſide's</hi> Dying Speech, with a full Account of all thoſe <hi>Jacobites</hi> who paſs'd Sentence againſt him.</p>

               <p>That's as it ſhall happen; but if they don't turn him out, Woe be to them; for he is about qualifying himſelf in ſuch a Manner as will ſoon make him terrible.</p>
