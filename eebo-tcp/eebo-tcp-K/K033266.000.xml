            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AS this is wrote for the benefit of perſons afflicted with the Venereal Diſeaſe, in its various ſtages; for the regulation of their diet and conduct on any emergency that may happen, when it is not in their power to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply immediately to their Surgeon; and alſo proper inſtructions for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting themſelves while under cure; I have therefore not given any ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0202601400:3"/>of the parts, nor entered into the minutiae of the diſeaſe, more than is neceſſary for reſtoring the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and given means for future pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention. Such a ſmall work as this will appear peculiarly neceſſary to every one. In the firſt place, from the ſymptoms of the diſeaſe, prudent perſons will be on their guard, and libertines have a method to prevent any future injury; by which means poſterity will be benefited, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy ſufferers will here have full directions; which will not only be acceptable to them, but to all perſons of either ſex.</p>

            <head>ADVICE, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE Venereal Diſeaſe<note n="*" place="bottom">In ancient records, 1376 and 1398 public ſtews and brothels were tolerated under certain regulations; and thoſe girls that had the Burning, as it was called, were ſeparated from the reſt, and forbid to lie with man while ſhe had it. Falſtaff hints at the diſeaſe in the Second Part of Henry IV. Act II. Scene IV. —"<hi>Fal.</hi> If the cook help to make the gluttons, you help to make diſeaſes, Doll; we catch of you, Doll; we catch of you; grant that my poor virtue—grant that—." Alſo ſee Leviticus, chap. 13, 15, and 20.</note> may be obtained three ways, viz. Firſt, By impure connection. Secondly,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0202601400:5"/>By contact of parts<note n="*" place="bottom">Midwives ought to be exceſſive careful to have no cuts or ſores on their fingers, as numbers of caſes have occurred, where they have obtained a confirmed lues by the contact of parts.</note>. And laſtly, Hereditary. Be it obtained which way it will, we aſcribe it to the French (i. e. the French Pox), they call it the Neapolitan; the Neapolitan, the Spaniſh; and the Spaniſh, the Indian. In its firſt ſtage it is called the Gonorrhoea, or Clap<note n="†" place="bottom">What is commonly called the Dry Clap, is when there is no diſcharge, with difficulty of making water; from the increaſe of the ſwelling and inflammation an iſchury, or total ſuppreſſion of urine, is the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</note>; in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, the Confirmed Pox, or Lues Venerea; and that every one may know when they have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained this horrid diſeaſe, and to what ſtage they have advanced, I ſhall lay down every ſymptom as they occur.</p>

               <head>GONORRHOEA,<note n="*" place="bottom">I believe the gonorrhoea to be merely a local com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint; the lues venerea, conſtitutional. This is proved in the hoſpitals every day; for if a patient ſhould go through a ptylyſmis, or ſpitting, and contract a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norrhoea, during the cure, the conſtitutional diſeaſe would be removed, but the local continue.</note> ITS SIGNS.</head>
               <p>THE firſt ſymptoms are an agreeable ſenſation in the genital parts in general, and the teſticles have a creeping worm-like motion, which ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to venery; next a gradual diſcharge comes on; firſt, a limpid thin humour, which increaſes until it comes a ſharp, ſtinking, purulent matter; the parts inflame, and now great pain is felt in paſſing the urine, like ſo many needles; this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes to ſuch a height, that the patient dreads to make water; and from the pain and fear he does not let it flow, but paſſes it in jerks: his phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiognomy
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0202601400:7"/>at this period is very unfavourable<note n="*" place="bottom">This is called a dyſuria, an inflammable ſymptom: young people, at the firſt time, have it worſe than others.</note>. The miſery is now increaſed by a chordee<note n="†" place="bottom">So called from its ſimilarity to a chorde binding down the penis.</note>, i. e. the penis becomes frequently erect in a diſagreeable manner, curved downwards with exquiſite pain. In thoſe that have long fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkins, it inflames, cannot be drawn back, and is called phymoſis<note n="‡" place="bottom">There is ſometimes veſicles, or bladders, filled with water on the ſurface.</note>; in thoſe that are ſhort, it contracts, and ſwells up behind the nut ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to ſuch a degree as to endanger the patient's life, and is named a paraphimoſis<note n="§" place="bottom">I have known it to ſwell, and contract, till the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation increaſed ſo as to ſtop the circulation in the nut, which by this means mortification came on, and they have loſt this part.</note>. From the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0202601400:8"/>inflammation, deep corroding ulcers<note n="*" place="bottom">Venereal ulcers are always known by their being jagg'd at the edges, and running in different ways, with a ſlough-like appearance.</note> now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, called chancres<note n="†" place="bottom">The firſt appearance of a chancre is not unlike the thruſh in the mouths of children. Parents cannot be too careful who ſuckle their children, as they may obtain this diſeaſe from a ſmall chancre on the nipple, or on the breaſt of the nurſe; nor can youth be too careful who they ſalute, as proſtitutes frequently have ſmall ulcers on their lips, tongue, &amp;c. Whenever theſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, even in the ſlighteſt manner, we ſhould conſider it as the confirmed pox, and treat it under that head.</note>.</p>

               <p>IT makes its appearance in about three or four days; the patient feels a pleaſing irritation, which ſoon degenerates into pain; a prickling ſhooting
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0202601400:9"/>ſenſation within the parts, which inflame and ſwell, is ſore and painful; the urine is hot and ſcalding to ſuch a degree, that the patient dreads to make water; ſhe feels a contractive<note n="*" place="bottom">From the inflammable attack of the virus in women, there is a peculiar conſtriction towards one ſide or the other in the vagina, which anſwers to the chordee in men.</note> and painful ſenſation in the lower part of her body, with a creeping motion within the ſides about the hips, dull pains acroſs the back. The diſcharge is at firſt ſlime; then thin, watery, ſharp, foetid, bloody; and, at length, becomes a deep green.</p>

               <p>In the firſt, the notice of the patient is attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a pain in the groin, and upon examination
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0202601400:10"/>he finds a ſmall lump, the ſize of a pea; there is no inflammation externally, but, after handling, the part becomes more painful, and increaſes to the ſize of a nut; the part is more ſenſible, it throbs, the body is inflamed, a ſlight fever comes on, univerſal laſſitude, pains in the limbs, head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach, thirſt, &amp;c. Still increaſing to the ſize of a pigeon's egg, becomes inflamed, matter forms, and it is now at its maturity. The ſecond makes its approach with a painful worm-like motion in one or both teſticles; the running abates, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſtops; they ſwell and inflame; dull, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, burthenſome pains come on, with ſudden twinges and ſtitches extending into the loins; they now become a painful load; a fever ſucceeds, and the criſis is at hand, by either ſuppuration, gangrene, or cancer<note n="*" place="bottom">When the pain and inflammation in the teſticle abate, the running returns; if the inflammation runs high, it is then that bleeding plentifully is of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; alſo purging, fomentations, &amp;c. which muſt be left to the ſurgeon's care.</note>.</p>

The firſt ſymptoms the patient feels, is an irregular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termittent fever, pain in the head, arms, legs, knees, great laſſitude and dejection of ſpirits; the pain increaſes, eſpecially at night; and when warm in bed, it is paſt bearing, nor can they get any

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0202601400:13"/>and covered with branny ſcales; the eyes are dull, heavy, red, and ſtaring; the face becomes blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the neck ſtiff, the mouth ſore, the cheeks firey, the noſe ſwells, is diſtorted, and ſtuffed with ſcabs, the tongue enlarges, the throat is ſore, the hairy ſcalp is now covered with a cruſt, and loſes its natural colour, the hands ſwell, the nails grow thick and drop off, the voice changes, and the language is unintelligible, the lungs depreſſed, the mouth ſtiff and open, the breath loathſome and foetid, and the mind filled with wretchedneſs and deſpair. To cloſe this horrid ſcene, the burning pains increaſe, a heavy pulſe, univerſal weakneſs, dimneſs of ſight, hiccup, ſtranguary, difficulty of ſpeech and reſpiration, the nodes break open, the ſcaly ſcalp cracks, the noſe and throat is corroded, the teeth drop out, the breath is inſupportable, and the whole fabric is now a maſs of ſtinking carrion; if the malady continues, till limb from limb drops off, the vitals are attacked, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy ſufferer expires, the putrid carcaſe is hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the grave, offenſive to all.</p>

               <p>Having thus far given the hiſtory of the diſeaſe, from the beginning to the end, that every one may know how to avoid thoſe who are unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate enough to have any of the above appearances, I ſhall now proceed to give advice to thoſe who labour under its baneful influence.</p>
               <p>On the firſt appearance of the diſeaſe, let me injoin you to temperance, ſoberneſs, and chaſtity; three moral virtues here indiſpenſably neceſſary. Your diet<note n="*" place="bottom">Neither purging nor a low diet are neceſſary in the cure of the gonorrhoea; draſtic purging will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the inflammation.</note> muſt be moderate, and roaſt meat is preferable to boiled; beef and mutton, to veal or lamb; the former is the more eaſy of digeſtion; but mutton is the eaſieſt of all. Avoid ſpices, or high ſauces; for, as it is in its firſt ſtage a topical inflammation, every thing which increaſes the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of the blood will promote the diſeaſe; conſequently all exceſſive exerciſes muſt be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0202601400:15"/>ſuch as riding on horſe-back, leaping, jump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c. You may drink wine; but beware of intoxication, or you will ſuffer the next day ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely. Though at this time Venus attracts your thoughts, yet pay no homage at her ſhrine. In ſhort, eat when you are hungry, but ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities at a time; let your drink be moderate, and be ſatisfied when your thirſt is quenched. The paſſions of the mind have here great influence; avoid them; they irritate the diſeaſe; and when indulged to exceſs, they have been known to bring on alarming ſymptoms. I muſt lay particular ſtreſs on cleanlineſs<note n="*" place="bottom">A ſpecies of lues venerea prevails in the weſt of Scotland, which the natives call Sibbins, or Sivvins, owing to uncleanlineſs.</note>, eſpecially in the fair ſex; for without this the diſeaſe rapidly increaſes, from the corroding virus lying on the parts, or hid in the folds, by which means the irritation is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and conſequently the inflammation will extend, bringing on chancres, buboes, &amp;c. which
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0202601400:16"/>in many inſtances, by timely care, might have been avoided: and to this end always waſh the parts with a little milk and water two or three times a day; or, what is better, a ſcruple of calomel in two or three ounces of roſe water; and between the folds put a little lint, which change every time. To thoſe who in the firſt ſtage uſe injections, retain them in the parts as long as poſſible; to let it come away immediately is of very little ſervice. By the improper uſe of aſtringent injections<note n="*" place="bottom">Aſtringent injections are ſuch as the vitriol, alum, and the preparations of lead. About 10 or 15 drops of the extract of lead, in four ounces of ſoft water, are ſometimes neceſſary to waſh the parts when a pariphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſis takes place; it acts as a ſeditive, and will abate the inflammation; but ought to be ſparingly uſed.</note> the running at firſt is frequently ſtopped, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy ſufferer thinks he is cured, till, alas! appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances too ſoon inform him of his fatal miſtake. On the contrary, injections that are ſerviceable at firſt increaſe the diſcharge; your body ſhould be
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0202601400:17"/>kept moderate, neither bound nor looſe. If you find a painful ſenſation in your groin, or teſticle, and at this time it is not convenient to apply for advice, ſuſpend the teſticle in a bag, and rub it with a little mercurial ointment mixt with cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor; the ſame by the buboe; but remember, in the latter, rub rather below the part, that the lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatis may carry it through the glands; but if they ſtill increaſe, apply a poultice of bread and milk, mixt with the blue mercurial ointment, which, in general, will carry them off<note n="*" place="bottom">There certainly is no occaſion to bring the buboe to ſuppuration, giving the patient unneceſſary pain and trouble; I do, and always think it adviſable to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs them, eſpecially at the beginning, as they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ariſe from irritation, which cauſes inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the glands, and hence obſtructions. I muſt here aſk the gentlemen of the faculty, if abating the inflammation, leſſening the irritation, and by any means removing the obſtructions, can pox the patient? On the contrary, I think letting it proceed to ſuppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and expoſing a ſurface to the air, is the moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly means in the world. [I knew a worthy practitioner in the country ſo bigotted to the idea of a ſuppurated buboe curing the diſeafe, that after he has applied his cauſtic, he ſeldom took any further notice of it.] But if the patient applies too late, and ſuppuration is at its height, I ſeldom open them in men—in women, never. If an opening is required, I guage the lancet between my finger and thumb, and by drawing the ſame acroſs the buboe, from left to right (and <hi>vice verſa,</hi> as occaſion may require) open it with eaſe and ſafety; by this means the patient is not frightened with the knife, nor tortured with the cauſtic. The dreſſing cannot be too ſlight; and for the firſt day or two apply a poultice of white bread and milk mixt, with a little mercurial ointment over all; this takes off the callous edges, ſo much complained of when the knife is uſed.</note>, or relieve
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0202601400:18"/>till you can get aſſiſtance<note n="*" place="bottom">Buboes ſometimes, by ill treatment, or a bad ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of body, become phagedenic, i. e. when the lips of the wound are hard, looſe, and for the ſpace of an inch does not adhere to the ſurface of the ulcer; under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath this a probe may be paſſed; all round there is a livid appearance, diſcharges a thin fluid very different from the true pus. Some practitioners have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to give mercury at this time, while ſuppuration is going on, and likewiſe after matter has been evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, which will irritate, inflame, and produce a truly phagedenic ſore; when this is the caſe, I would recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the bark and ſarſaparilla; the patient at the ſame time ſhould have a milk and vegetable diet, with coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try air. There is no medicine that ſo ſpeedily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves the effects of mercury, as ſarſaparilla given in powder or decoction, and bark will ſtrengthen the ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem. After this treatment has been uſed for ſome time, and the ſore brought into a good ſtate, it will be apt to ſpread, and break out again, from being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the venereal matter returning, when mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry muſt be had recourſe to, but with a great deal of caution. If the ſore ſhould again have phagedenic appearances, mercury muſt be deſiſted from, and the bark and ſarſaparilla as before; and when at a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſtate, the mercury again continued. Theſe kind of ulcers are the moſt difficult to cure in all ſurgery; outward applications ſhould be mild; the beſt is a white bread poultice.</note>. If a phimoſis comes on, ſoak the part in milk and water, ſyringe the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0202601400:19"/>glands with the calomel injection frequently, after which put up a little lint round the nut with a probe,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0202601400:20"/>or ſkewer. The pariphimoſis treat the ſame; but always have your ſurgeon's advice, eſpecially in the latter, as delays here would be injurious. I would always adviſe, as long as any ſcalding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues, to drink plentifully of linſeed tea, or to eat gum arabic; theſe mucilaginous ſubſtances will abate the acrimony of the urine. If any hard knot ſhould ariſe, rub them with the ointment before-mentioned. Another ſymptom attending this ſtage, is a chordee; no pleaſant companion; but it is ſoon removed, by rubbing the part with a little ointment, and applying a plaſter of the ſame upon it.</p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0202601400:21"/>
               <p>Having thus far given you cautions, I will now proceed to a more pleaſant ſubject, namely, ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of an approaching cure; which is, when the ſcalding abates, the diſcharge thickens, the green appearance gradually vaniſhes, yellow ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, till at laſt it is white, and does not ſtain the linen, and may now be called a common gleet, which is removed by balſamic medicines, freſh air, and moderate exerciſe; to which I will add, frequent topical cold bathing<note n="*" place="bottom">The parts are always, after a gonorrhoea, relaxed, or lame; and nothing is more conducive to reſtore the tone of the fibres than topical cold bathing: what I mean by this is, to pour a bottle of cold water on the parts as ſoon as you riſe in the morning; this ſome call cabbaging.</note> If from ill treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or neglect, the urethra is filled with carno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, or callofities, ſo as to obſtruct the paſſage of urine<note n="†" place="bottom">Where there are ſtrictures in the urethra, the urine is always divided into two ſtreams; and there is always matter on the bougie where the ſtricture or ulcer is. A bougie will ſometimes cauſe a chordee in an healthy perſon; but, as above, it is the moſt painful at the part affected.</note>, then bougies become abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0202601400:22"/>but always be careful to tie a piece of thread round the top, bind and faſten it gently around the nut.</p>
               <p>Though thus far I have treated it as a ſimple inflammation, and ſuppoſed it to be cured on that principle; yet always take ſome alterative medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine<note n="*" place="bottom">Mercurials, in ſmall doſes, are the beſt alterative medicines; and during their courſe I always give the following diet drink—Take of ſaſſafras chips 4 oz. ſarſaparilla 2 oz. guaiacum ſhavings 3 oz. mezerian root 2 drams; pour on this three quarts of boiling water, and when cold, it is fit for uſe; a gill four or five times a day.</note>, to guard againſt any lurking miſchief; for I am certain too great ſecurity here, or rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0202601400:23"/>on the words of boaſting pretenders<note n="*" place="bottom">It is become the faſhion, in modern quackery, to advertiſe to cure without taking a ſingle grain of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury. True; ſo I am ſatisfied it is frequently done; but if there be one out of five that have any virus left in the conſtitution, it ought to induce all to take a few ſmall doſes. I am certain it is from this our hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals are ſo crouded—from this lurking miſchief breaking at a diſtant period in various forms, well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the name of Hydra.</note>, has, in the end, been the ruin of many; for the diſeaſe lying dormant for a number of years, has after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards broke out in the various forms above-men-mentioned, which, had they taken ſome alterative medicines, would never have happened. Where this is the caſe, alterative medicines are the ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and ſafeſt cure; they act without injuring the ſyſtem, and, joined with cleanlineſs, never fail in the moſt confirmed pox. The firſt thing to be thought of is frequently cleaning the teeth, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0202601400:24"/>gargling the throat, change of linen, frequently waſhing the body, and beware of catching cold. If any ſcaley eruptions appear, waſh them with bran and water; or warts, clip them off with a pair of ſciſſars, and apply the ointment over them. If your throat, or noſtrils are affected, uſe the fumes of mercury<note n="*" place="bottom">The beſt method of applying mercury in fumes, is to put ten or fifteen grains of cinnabar on a hot iron, drawing the ſmoak into the throat, or up the noſe, twice a day, through a funnel.</note>, or apply immediately to your ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon. If nodes ariſe, rub them every night with the ointment; keep the body temperate; and, in ſome caſes, it is adviſable to wear a flannel jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin and drawers next the ſkin. When you find all the ſymptoms abate and vaniſh, leave not off your medicines too ſuddenly. After which I would adviſe a courſe of bark, exerciſe, change of air, and cold bathing, to take off the irritability the diſeaſe has cauſed in the ſyſtem.</p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0202601400:25"/>
               <p>Before this advice is cloſed, I ſhall give a few hints on the uſe of mercury.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, I do not agree with ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even in the worſt of caſes. It is from this imprudence that this ſacred medicine has been thrown aſide; a medicine which, when admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered with caution, is not injurious to the human frame; on the contrary, expel it from the Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria Medica, how many millions would ſuffer from the ſcurvy, gout, rheumatiſm, yaws, bilious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, &amp;c.? It ſhould be given in ſmall doſes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any perceptible action. In this manner, what are its effects? it increaſes the action of the lympha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic ſyſtem; the conſequence is, the glands, before obſtructed, have now a free circulation, the offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing virus is abſorbed, and thrown off by the pores of the ſkin, urine, ſtool, &amp;c. the blood is purified, and the body now reſtored to health. On the contrary, if too large a quantity is taken, a foul breath, rotten gums, carious teeth, &amp;c. enſues;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0202601400:26"/>the glands are irritated to ſecretions beyond their power, the appetite is loſt, the inteſtinal canal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, the head ſwells, the tongue hangs out of the mouth, and ſaliva is continually running from it; copious ſweats, and univerſal debility follow; at this period few come near him, from the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſmell. Suppoſe he ſtops here, and the diſeaſe is cured, how dearly is it paid for, when ſo ſafe a remedy is at hand? He lingers out the reſt of his life with a debilitated, irritable conſtitution.— How many by this are brought to an early grave! From this cauſe ſalivation is now juſtly exploded.</p>
               <p>To ſum up the whole, I would adviſe, that in the firſt ſtage of a gonorrhoea, or clap, the method of cure ſhall be to leſſen the inflammation and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritability of the ſyſtem, to promote gentle perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, to correct the acrimony of the fluids, and to protect the body from infection. Injections that will abate the inflammation, that are void of aſtringency, are preferable; they are applied to the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0202601400:27"/>part diſeaſed, and certainly will cure more ſpeedily than medicines taken by the mouth. With pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per injections, where they have applied as ſoon as they have diſcovered the injury, I have complete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cured, in a few days, the moſt virulent gonor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoea. What medicines are taken internally ſhould be anti-inflammatory. After this, when the ſcalding is abated, the colour gone, a ſimple gleet only remaining, balſamics are the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; but, after all, it is prudent to guard the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution by a few alterative medicines. In the lues venerea alteratives are what we muſt depend on; but when joined to balſamics, and others that will promote a gentle perſpiration, they are ſure of ſucceſs. By theſe principles I have always ſucceeded in the worſt of caſes; and weak debilitated habits, ariſing from exceſſes of any kind whatſoever, by cordial tonic medicines, cold bathing, change of air, and exerciſe, are ſure to meet with relief.</p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0202601400:28"/>
               <p>I muſt here guard youth from that diabolical practice of machinery; ſo far is it from being a preſervative, that numbers have been poxed from too great a ſecurity. There is now another faſhionable vice, no leſs injurious in debilitating the ſyſtem, by forcing nature further than her ſtrength will bear, and bringing on a train of ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous complaints; I mean, whipping. I cannot help wiſhing, with Dr. Faulk, that fools who laſciviouſly uſe this exerciſe to ſtir up their luſt, might be ſwitched after emiſſion, as they endured it before; which would ſoon cure them of this diabolical practice.</p>
               <p>To conclude; I ſhall now lay down the moſt ſafe means of preventing this loathſome diſeaſe. After intercourſe with a ſuſpected perſon, always waſh the parts with a little warm water, or ſoap; or if not at hand, your own urine. Be careful to waſh between the folds, or round the glands; and when you get home, uſe the following—calomel
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0202601400:29"/>1 ſcruple, roſe-water 2 ounces<note n="*" place="bottom">I cannot ſpeak too highly of this preparation; it is the moſt ſafe and efficacious application to old ulcers and cancers of every kind, it producing good matter in a few dreſſings; and when the ears are affected, and diſcharge a foetid matter, they ſhould be ſyringed with it three or four times a day.</note>, and leave ſome of it on. Some throw it up the parts with a ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe, and they are ſure of ſucceſs; even if a ſlight gonorrhoea has taken place, it will cure without any further application. In women it is the beſt, eaſieſt, and ſafeſt remedy; not only here, but alſo in the flower albus; it being thrown up the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gina 3 times a-day, and the patient taking a little bark to ſtrengthen and brace the ſyſtem, nothing elſe is further required. By having this by them, they may at all times keep free from the diſeaſe. Some chuſe to rub a ſmall quantity of blue mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial ointment on the groin and parts; this too, like the other, is certainly deſtroying the infection
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0202601400:30"/>in the bud, and adviſable when the other cannot be procured; but there is one caution, always to have the calomel pure and mild: what I prepare for the purpoſe, and for private practice, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes a number of waſhings in lime water, &amp;c. to take off every minute particle of acid.</p>
