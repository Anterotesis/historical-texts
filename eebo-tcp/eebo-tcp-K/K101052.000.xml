            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <sp>
               <l>FAR from the haunts of men, of vice the foe,</l>
               <l>The moon-ſtruck child of genius and of woe,</l>
               <l>Verſed in each magic ſpell, and dear to fame,</l>
               <l>A fair enchantreſs dwells, Romance her name.</l>
               <l>She loathes the ſun, or blazing taper's light:</l>
               <l>The moon-beam'd landſcape and tempeſtuous night</l>
               <l>Alone ſhe loves; and oft, with glimmering lamp,</l>
               <l>Near graves new-open'd, or 'midſt dungeons damp,</l>
               <l>Drear foreſts, ruin'd aiſles, and haunted towers,</l>
               <l>Forlorn ſhe roves, and raves away the hours!</l>
               <l>Anon, when ſtorms howl loud and laſh the deep,</l>
               <l>Deſperate ſhe climbs the ſea-rock's beetling ſteep;</l>
               <l>There wildly ſtrikes her harp's fantaſtic ſtrings,</l>
               <l>Tells to the moon how grief her boſom wrings,</l>
               <l>And while her ſtrange ſong chaunts fictitious ills,</l>
               <l>In wounded hearts Oblivion's balm diſtills.</l>
               <l>A youth, who yet has lived enough to know</l>
               <l>That life has thorns, and taſte the cup of woe,</l>
               <l>As late near Conway's time-bowed towers he ſtray'd,</l>
               <l>Invok'd this bright enthuſiaſts magic aid.</l>
               <l>His prayer was heard. With arms and boſom bare,</l>
               <l>Eyes flaſhing fire, looſe robes, and ſtreaming hair,</l>
               <l>Her heart all anguiſh, and her ſoul all flame,</l>
               <l>Swift as her thoughts, the lovely maniac came!</l>
               <l>High heav'd her breaſts, which ſtruggling paſſions rent,</l>
               <l>As preſt to give ſome fear-fraught myſtery vent:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0615000500:3"/>And oft, with anxious glance and alter'd face,</l>
               <l>Trembling with terror, ſhe relaxed her pace,</l>
               <l>And ſtopt! and liſtened!—Then with hurried tread</l>
               <l>Onwards again ſhe ruſh'd, yet backwards bent her head,</l>
               <l>As if from murderous ſwords or following fiends ſhe fled!</l>
               <l>Soon as near Conway's walls her footſteps drew,</l>
               <l>She bade the youth their ancient ſtate renew:</l>
               <l>Eager he ſped the fallen towers to rear:</l>
               <l>'Twas done, and fancy bore the fabric here.</l>
               <l>Next chooſing from great Shakſpeare's comic ſchool,</l>
               <l>The goſſip crone, groſs friar, and gibing fool—</l>
               <l>Theſe, with a virgin fair and lover brave,</l>
               <l>To our young author's care the enchantreſs gave;</l>
               <l>But charged him, ere he bleſs'd the brave and fair,</l>
               <l>To lay th' exulting villain's boſom bare,</l>
               <l>And by the torments of his conſcience ſhow,</l>
               <l>That proſperous vice is but triumphant woe!</l>
               <l>The pleaſing taſk, congenial to his ſoul,</l>
               <l>Oft from his own ſad thoughts our author ſtole:</l>
               <l>Bleſt be his labours, if with like ſucceſs</l>
               <l>They ſoothe their ſorrows whom I now addreſs.</l>

               <l>Mourn ſlighted talents, or deſert oppreſt,</l>
               <l>Falſe friendſhip, hopeleſs love, or faith betray'd;</l>
               <l>Our author will eſteem each toil o'er-paid,</l>
               <l>If, while his muſe exerts her livelier vein,</l>
               <l>Or tells imagined woes in plaintive ſtrain,</l>
               <l>Her flights and fancies make one ſmile appear</l>
               <l>On the pale cheek, where trickled late a tear;</l>
               <l>Or if <hi>her</hi> fabled ſorrows ſteal one groan,</l>
               <l>Which elſe her hearers would have given their own.</l>

               <l>OSMOND by this arrived at Charon's ferry,</l>
               <l>My honour ſaved, and dad alive and merry,</l>
               <l>Hither I come the public doom to know,</l>
               <l>But come not uncompell'd—the more's my woe!</l>
               <l>E'en now, (oh! pity, friends, my hard miſhap!)</l>
               <l>My ſhoulder felt a Bow-Street runner's tap,</l>
               <l>Who, while I ſhook with fear in every limb,</l>
               <l>Thus ſpoke, with accent ſtern and viſage grim—</l>
               <l>"Miſtreſs!" quoth he, "to me it given in truſt is,</l>
               <l>"To bring you ſtraight before our larned Juſtice;</l>
               <l>"For, know, 'tis ſaid, to-night, the whole town o'er,</l>
               <l>"You've kill'd one Oſmond, alias Barrymore."</l>
               <l>"The fellow's mad!" 'twas thus amaz'd I ſpoke;</l>
               <l>"Lord! Sir, I murdered Oſmond for a joke.</l>
               <l>"This dagger, free from blood, will make it certain,</l>
               <l>"He died but till the prompter dropped the curtain;</l>
               <l>"And now, well pleaſed to quit this ſcene of riot,</l>
               <l>"The man's gone home to ſup in peace and quiet!"</l>
               <l>Finding that all I ſaid was ſaid in vain,</l>
               <l>And Townſhend ſtill his firſt deſign maintain,</l>
               <l>I thought 'twere beſt to fly for ſhelter here,</l>

                  <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0615000500:5"/>Beſides, it muſt appear, on explanation,</l>
               <l>How very tickliſh was my ſituation,</l>
               <l>And all perforce, his crimes when I relate,</l>
               <l>Muſt own that Oſmond well deſerved his fate.</l>
               <l>He heeded not papa's pathetic pleading;</l>
               <l>He ſtabbed mama—which was extreme ill-breeding;</l>
               <l>And at his feet for mercy when <hi>I</hi> ſued,</l>
               <l>The odious wretch, I vow, was downright rude.</l>
               <l>Twice his bold hands my perſon dared to touch!</l>
               <l>Twice in one day!—'Twas really once too much!</l>
               <l>And therefore juſtly filled with virtuous ire,</l>
               <l>To ſave my honour, and protect my fire,</l>
               <l>I drew my knife, and in his boſom ſtuck it;</l>
               <l>He fell, you clapped—and then he kicked the bucket!</l>
               <l>So periſh ſtill the wretch, whoſe ſoul can know</l>
               <l>Selfiſh delight, while cauſing other's woe;</l>
               <l>Who blaſts that joy, the ſweeteſt God has given,</l>
               <l>And makes an hell, where love would make an heaven!</l>
               <l>Forbear, thou lawleſs libertine! nor ſeek</l>
               <l>Forc'd favours on that pale averted cheek:</l>

               <l>Unleſs thoſe lips with thine keep playful meaſure,</l>
               <l>And that ſweet tear ſhould be a tear of pleaſure!</l>
               <l>Now as for Oſmond—at that villain's name</l>
               <l>I feel reviving wrath my ſoul inflame!</l>

               <l>No! To your bar, dear friends, for aid I fly!</l>
               <l>Bid Oſmond live again, again to die;</l>

he'd have been quite edified. But yet what does talking ſignify? The eloquence of my lips is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teracted by the luſtre of my eyes; and really the little devils are ſo tender, and ſo troubleſome, that I'm half angry with nature for having made me ſo very bewitching.</p>

I proteſt I'm grateful to Heaven that among the unclean Beaſts who accompanied Noah, there went not into the ark a pair of fat monks: they muſt infallibly have created a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and then the world would never have been re-peopled.—Next, for incontinence, you muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low yourſelf that you are unequalled.</p>

You were then ſcarce fourteen, and I had been your companion and play-fellow from your child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.

Still do I regret my native land, and the partners of my poverty.

Twenty years have elapſed ſince theſe Chriſtians tore me away: they trampled upon my heart, mocked my deſpair, and, when in frantic terms I raved of Samba, laughed, and wondered how a negro's ſoul could feel! In that moment when the laſt point of Africa faded from my view, when as I ſtood on the veſſel's deck I felt that all I loved was to me loſt for ever, in that bitter mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment did I baniſh humanity from my breaſt. I tore from my arm the bracelet of Samba's hair, I gave to the ſea the precious token, and, while the high waves ſwift bore it from me, vowed aloud endleſs hatred to mankind. I have kept my oath, I <hi>will</hi> keep it!</p>

You may have obſerved two folding-doors, which are ever kept locked: they lead to the Oratory, in which the Lady Evelina paſſed moſt of her time, while my Lord was engaged in the Scottiſh wars. She would fit there, good ſoul! hour after hour, playing on the lute, and ſinging airs ſo ſweet, ſo ſad, that many a time and oft have I wept to hear her. Ah! when I kiſſed her hand at the Caſtle-gate, little did I ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that her fate would have been ſo wretched!</p>

                     <p>A ſad one, Lady! Impatient to embrace her Lord, after a year's abſence, the Counteſs ſet out to meet him on his return from Scotland, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by a few domeſtics and her infant-daughter, then ſcarce a twelvemonth old. But, as ſhe returned with her huſband, robbers ſurpriſed the party ſcarce a mile from the Caſtle; and ſince that time no news has been received of the Earl, of the Counteſs, the ſervants, or the child.</p>

                     <p>Never! The only domeſtic who eſcaped pointed out the ſcene of action; and as it proved to be on the river's banks, doubtleſs the aſſaſſins plunged the bodies into the ſtream.</p>

                     <p>Speak lower, Lady! It was ſaid ſo, I own: but for my own part I never believed it. To my certain knowledge Oſmond loved the Lady Evelina too well to hurt her; and when he heard of her death, he wept, and ſobbed as if his heart were breaking. Nay, 'tis certain that he propoſed to her before marriage, and would have made her his wife, only that ſhe liked his brother better. Well ſhe might indeed, for Earl Reginald was a ſweeter gentleman by half.</p>

                     <p>Willingly. You are to know, that ſince the late Earl's death the Caſtle is thought to be haunted: the ſervants are fully perſuaded that his ghoſt wanders every night through the long galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and parades the old towers and dreary halls which abound in this melancholy manſion. He is ſuppoſed to be dreſt in compleat armour; and that which you wear at preſent was formerly his. Now hear my plan. The Earl prepares to hold a confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with Lady Angela; even now I heard her ſummoned to attend him in the Armoury. Placed upon this pedeſtal you may liſten to their diſcourſe unobſerved, and thus form a proper judgment both of your miſtreſs and her guardian. As ſoon as it grows dark I will conduct you to Angela's apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: the obſcurity will then ſhelter you from diſcovery; and even ſhould you be obſerved, you will paſs for Earl Reginald's ſpectre.</p>

Above all, they ſay that the ſpirit of the late Counteſs ſits nightly in her Oratory, and ſings her baby to ſleep! However, if it be ſo— <stage>A bell ſounds thrice, loud and ſolemn</stage>—Hark!

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0615000500:30"/>
to my ſoul, ſave Angela's, ſave only Angela's! Doting upon one whom death has long claſped in his arms; tortured by deſires which I never hoped to ſatisfy, many a mournful year has my heart known no throb but of anguiſh, no gueſt but remorſe at committing a fruitleſs crime. Hope, that ſtranger, once more reviſits my boſom: the fiend, who led me through paſſion's mazes to the heights of guilt, owns that a crime ſo great well merits a reward. He bids the monument's jaws uncloſe: Evelina revives in her daughter, and ſoon ſhall the fires which conſume me be quenched in Angela's arms. What though her heart be Percy's?

Edwy has my plighted faith: He received it on the laſt evening which I paſſed in Northumberland, as we ſat on a low bench before old Allan's cottage. It was an heavenly night, ſweet and tranquil as the loves of angels: A gentle breeze whiſpered among the honeyſuckles which bloomed above us, and the full moon tinged with her ſilver light the diſtant towers of Alnwic. It was then that for the firſt time I gave him my hand, and I ſwore that I never would give it but to him!

Should other means fail, I will this very night attack the Caſtle, and compel Oſmond to reſign his prey.</p>

You may be certain that I was frightened enough. I inſtantly took to my heels; and juſt as I got without ſide of the door, I heard a loud clap of thunder, and the whole chamber ſhook as if tumbling into a thouſand pieces!</p>

thou too count the moments which divide us?— Doſt thou too chide the ſlowneſs of Time's pinions, which moved ſo ſwiftly when we ſtrayed together on the Cheviot Hills?—Methinks I ſee him now, as he paces the Conway's margin: If a leaf falls, if a bird flutters, he flies towards it, for he thinks 'tis the foot-ſtep of Angela: Then, with ſlow ſteps and bending head, diſappointed he regains the fiſher's cottage. Perhaps, at this moment, his eyes like mine are fixed on yonder planet; perhaps, this ſweet wind which plays on my cheek, is freighted with the ſighs of my Lover.—Oh! ſigh no more, my Percy!—Soon ſhall I repoſe in ſafety on your boſom; ſoon again ſee the moon ſhed her ſilver light on Cheviot, and hea: its green hills repeat the carol of your mellow horn!

With this intention he ſought your retreat; but when in you he beheld Evelina's living image, he changed his bloody purpoſe.

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>MANY erroneous aſſertions have been made reſpecting this Drama; ſome, that the language was originally extremely licentious; others, that the ſentiments were violently demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratic; and others again, that if Mr. Sheridan had not adviſed me to content myſelf with a ſingle Spectre, I meant to have exhibited a whole regiment of Ghoſts. To diſprove theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports I have deviated from the uſual mode of publiſhing Plays, as performed, and have printed mine almoſt verbatim, as originally written. Whether it merited the above accuſations, the reader has now had an opportunity of judging for himſelf. I muſt juſt mention that the laſt line of the Piece is altered, and that in the Second Scene of the Fifth Act, <hi>The Friar</hi> was made to ſtick in the door-way, whereas he now makes his exit without difficulty.</p>
            <p>Other charges, however, have been brought againſt me on better grounds, and I muſt requeſt the reader's patience while I ſay a few words reſpecting them. To originality of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter I make no pretence. Perſecuted heroines and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience-ſtung villains certainly have made their courteſies and bows to a Britiſh audience long before the appearance of <hi>"The Caſtle Spectre;"</hi> the <hi>Friar</hi> and <hi>Alice</hi> are copies, but very faint ones, from <hi>Juliet's Nurſe,</hi> and Sheridan's <hi>Father Paul,</hi> and <hi>Percy</hi> is a mighty pretty-behaved young gentleman with nearly no character at all. I ſhall not ſo readily give up my claim to novelty, when I mention my miſanthropic <hi>Negro:</hi> He has been compared to <hi>Zanga;</hi> but Young's Hero differs widely from what I meant in <hi>Haſſan. Zanga</hi>'s hatred is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to one object; to deſtroy the happineſs of that object is
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0615000500:107"/>
his ſole aim, and his vengeance is no ſooner accompliſhed, than he repents its gratification. <hi>Haſſan</hi> is a man of violent paſſions, and warm feelings, whoſe boſom is filled with the milk of human kindneſs, but that milk is ſoured by deſpair; whoſe nature was ſuſceptible of the tendereſt affections, but who feels that all the chains of his affections are broken for ever. He has loſt every thing, even hope; he has no ſingle object againſt which he can direct his vengeance, and he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects it at large againſt mankind. He hates all the world, hates even himſelf; for he feels that in that world there is no one that loves him.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Lorſque l'on peut ſouffrir, ſure que ſes douleurs</l>
               <l>D'aucun mortel ne font jamais couler les pleurs,</l>
               <l>On ſe deſintereſſe à la fin de ſoi-même;</l>
               <l>On ceſſe de s'aimer, ſi quelqu'un ne nous aime!</l>
            </q>
            <p>But though Haſſan's heart is changed by diſappointment and misfortune, that heart once was feeling and kind; nor could he hate with ſuch inveteracy, if he had not loved with extreme affection. In my opinion this character is not <hi>Zanga's;</hi> but this I muſt leave to the public deciſion. I may, however, boldly, and without vanity, aſſert, that <hi>Motley</hi> is quite new to the Stage. In other plays the Fool has always been a ſharp knave, quick in repartee, and full of whim, fancy, and entertainment; whereas <hi>my</hi> Fool (but I own I did not mean to make him ſo) is a dull, flat, good ſort of plain matter of fact fellow, as in the courſe of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance Mr. Banniſter diſcovered to his great ſorrow.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Oſmond</hi> is attended by <hi>negroes</hi> is an anachroniſm, I allow; but from the great applauſe which Mr. Dowton con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly received in <hi>Haſſan</hi> (a character which he played ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely well), I am inclined to think that the audience was not greatly offended at the impropriety. For my own part, I by no means repent the introduction of my <hi>Africans:</hi> I
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0615000500:108"/>
thought it would give a pleaſing variety to the characters and dreſſes, if I made my ſervants black; and could I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the ſame effect by making my heroine blue, blue I ſhould have made her.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Friar</hi>'s defence, when he moſt ungallantly leaves <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gela</hi> in the cavern to ſhift for herſelf, I can only plead the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the caſe. Stay where he was he could not; go he muſt at any rate: I trundled him off in the beſt way that I could; and, for the ſake of the public, I heartily wiſh that way had been better. With regard to his not meeting <hi>Oſmond</hi> in his flight, a little imagination will ſoon conquer that diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty: It may be ſuppoſed, that as he loſt his way in coming, he loſt it again in going; or, that he concealed himſelf till <hi>the Earl</hi> had paſſed him; or, that he tumbled down and broke his neck; or, that he....did any thing elſe you like better. I leave this matter entirely to the reader's fancy.</p>
            <p>Againſt my <hi>Spectre</hi> many objections have been urged: one of them I think rather curious. She ought not to appear, becauſe the belief in Ghoſts no longer exiſts! In my opinion, this is the very reaſon why ſhe <hi>may</hi> be produced without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; for there is now no fear of increaſing the influence of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, or ſtrengthening the prejudices of the weak-minded. I confeſs I cannot ſee any reaſon why Apparitions may not be as well permitted to ſtalk in a tragedy, as Fairies be ſuffered to fly in a pantomime, or Heathen Gods and Goddeſſes to cut capers in a grand ballet; and I ſhould rather imagine that <hi>Oberon</hi> and <hi>Bacchus</hi> now find as little credit to the full as the <hi>Cock-lane Ghoſt,</hi> or the Spectre of <hi>Mrs. Veal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Never was any poor ſoul ſo ill-uſed as <hi>Evelina</hi>'s, previous to her preſenting herſelf before the audience. The Friends to whom I read my Drama, the Managers to whom I preſented it, the Actors who were to perform in it—all combined to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute my <hi>Spectre,</hi> and requeſted me to confine my Ghoſt to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0615000500:109"/>
the Green-Room. Aware that without her my cataſtrophe would cloſely reſemble that of the <hi>Grecian Daughter,</hi> I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in retaining her. The event juſtified my obſtinacy: <hi>The Spectre</hi> was as well treated before the curtain as ſhe had been ill-uſed behind it; and as ſhe continues to make her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance nightly with increaſed applauſe, I think myſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der great obligations both to her and her repreſentative.</p>
            <p>But though I am conſcious that it is very imperfect, I ſhall not ſo far offend my own feelings, or inſult the judgment of the public, which has given it a very favourable reception, as to ſay that I think my Play very bad. Had ſuch been my opinion, inſtead of producing it on the ſtage, or committing it to the preſs, I ſhould have put it behind the fire, or, throwing it into the <hi>Thames,</hi> made a preſent of it to the Britiſh <hi>Scombri.</hi> Still its ſucceſs on the ſtage (great enough to content even an author) does not prevent my being very doubtful as to its reception in the cloſet, when diveſted of its beautiful muſic, ſplendid ſcenery, and, above all, of the acting, excellent throughout. Without detracting from the merits of the other performers (to all of whom I think myſelf much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted for their reſpective exertions), I muſt here be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to return particular thanks to Mrs. Jordan, whoſe manner of ſuſtaining her character exceeded my moſt ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine hopes, and in whoſe hands my heroine acquired an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance for which ſhe was entirely indebted to the talents of the actreſs.</p>
