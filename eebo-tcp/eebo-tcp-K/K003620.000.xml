            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN ESSAY ON PHYSICK.</head>
            <p>I SHALL not trouble the Reader with the Occaſion of the following Eſſay, or make any Apology for publiſhing it; the Subject of it is too Important to need the latter, and the former is a matter of no Conſequence to the Publick: and as I am not in humour, at preſent, to compliment either my Self or Others, and have neither leiſure nor inclination to be Impertinent, I ſhall directly fall on my Subject, without farther Preface or Dedication.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0490901800:3"/>
            <p>'TIS a matter of Fact beyond diſpute in the Hiſtory of Phyſick, as far as we have any remaining Records of it, from its firſt Riſe to this Day, that the <hi>Materia Medica</hi> has ſtill grown more and more Bulky in every Age. From what Cauſes this aroſe, and what Effects it has produced, will be farther ſeen in the Courſe of this Eſſay.</p>
            <p>THE moſt antient Phyſicians, as far as we can find, made uſe of but very few Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and thoſe few were entirely directed to the natural Evacuations; either to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote ſuch as were Obſtructed and Defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, or to check and reſtrain ſuch as were Exceſſive and Redundant. And herein they exactly followed the Direction and Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Nature, by obſerving what Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation or Diminution of theſe Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, brought on ſuch and ſuch morbid Symptoms, and by what ways and means they were removed and carried off, when the whole Proceſs was left to Nature only, without any aſſiſtance or interpoſition of Art. And as this was the only proper foundation to erect a laudable <hi>Praxis</hi> upon; ſo in fact we find that the Medical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0490901800:4"/>of the Antients, were always more or leſs ſucceſsful, as they had a nearer or more remote relation, in their intention of Cure, to the Operations of unaſſiſted Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and were directed, governed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by this Principle.</p>
            <p>WHILE Men thus contented themſelves with knowing only what they could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover in Fact, confined their Reaſonings to ſuch Phaenomena as occurr'd by Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Experience, and were not aſhamed to confeſs their Ignorance where they had no true Knowledge; they ſtudyed Nature more ſucceſsfully, and applyed their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to much better purpoſe: and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, as well as other Arts and Sciences, was conſiderably advanced and improved. But ſuch was the Vanity of the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers in pretending to ſearch into the real Eſſences, intrinſick Conſtitutions and formal Cauſes of things, that, in this whimſical purſuit, they had not only ſet aſide the true method of improving Knowledge by careful obſervation and juſt experiments, but introduced into its room a chimerical <hi>Succedaneum,</hi> which had no foundation in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0490901800:5"/>Reaſon and Nature, but was merely Fictiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Imaginary and Hypothetical. And thus while they thought to ranſack the Bowels, and penetrate to the very Centre of Nature, they loſt ſight of the Surface, and could not perceive or judge of what was before their Eyes.</p>
            <p>IF theſe dark and profound Inquiſitors had confin'd their Enquirys and Lucubra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to matters of Speculation and Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, and had not attempted to intrude their Whimſys and Reveries into common Life, and the uſeful Arts and Sciences; tho' no good had come of it, yet, on the other hand, no great harm would have been done: but the miſchief lay here, that in every Age the Philoſophy moſt in vogue, like a Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent carry'd all before it, broke in upon Soul and Body at once, and ſettled not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Faith of Chriſtians, but the Practice of Phyſicians too: and hence we meet with in their turns <hi>Platoniſts, Ariſtotelians, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſians, Corpuſcularians, Specificians,</hi> and <hi>Roſicrucians</hi> in Phyſick, as well as in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Theſe all claimed the ſame implicit Faith and Obedience to their reſpective
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0490901800:6"/>Creeds, Canons and Conſtitutions, equally denyed the Right of private Judgment to all their Diſciples, and, as far as lay in their power, diſcouraged and oppoſed all rational Freedom of Inquiry whatſoever. Thus a Phyſical as well as Theological Orthodoxy was ever inſiſted on, and a Man, in either caſe, was always reputed to die a Heretick, if he did not die in Form.</p>
            <p>THE State of Phyſick thus ſtood for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ages, on the authority of the Schools and whimſies of the Theoriſts. The ſtudy of Nature was almoſt wholly laid aſide, and the good old way to Knowledge by Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations and Experiments, was ſuperſeded by Canons and Aphoriſms founded on a meer verbal and unintelligible Philoſophy; which from authority, only, obtain'd the name of firſt Principles, and of conſequence were not to be diſputed. And hence we find that the Practice of Phyſick in every ſucceeding Age became more and more uncertain and precarious, till it ran quite out of Character, and fell into the hands of Viſionaries and Chemical Enthuſiaſts, who being for the moſt part Men of ſtrong
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0490901800:7"/>Imaginations and weak Judgments, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd all their thoughts, and ſpent all their time, in ſearch after the <hi>Alkaheſt</hi> or <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Medicine;</hi> and ſo eager were they in the purſuit of this Chimaera, that they not only neglected, but almoſt quite loſt, the little knowledge they had of particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies.</p>
            <p>AND that a proper Theory might not be wanting exactly ſuited to this whimſical and ridiculous Enterprize; and finding it impracticable to adapt any one then in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or to contrive a new one in the way of Reaſon and Nature; they wiſely took it into their heads to introduce Machinery into Medicine, and to bring in Demons and ſupernatural Agents to their aſſiſtance. Thus the <hi>Archaeus</hi> came into play and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted Superintendant over the whole A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal Oeconomy. This <hi>Major-Domo,</hi> as long as he was in good humour, executed his Commiſſion very faithfully, and guarded the Health and Safety of the whole Body; ſo that all Danger was prevented, and every thing went on well. But no ſooner was he diſpleaſed and diſobliged, but he neglected
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0490901800:8"/>his guard, Diſeaſe broke in upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and all was out of order; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in Nature could reſtore it again to its former Health and Rectitude, till the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaeus</hi> was pacifyed and appeaſed with the grand Secret or univerſal Medicine. Now this grand Secret, you muſt know, was a certain Chemical Preparation ſo exactly ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Taſte, that it never fail'd, when timely adminiſtred by the Phyſician, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer this intention: but when this peeviſh teſty Phantom happened to be neglected too long, he then fell into a paſſion, became implacable, and in his rage and fury always deſtroyed the Patient.</p>
            <p>THIS Scheme, as whimſical and viſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as it appears to be, has had for its Patrons and Defenders Gentlemen of the greateſt name; and I make no doubt but long e'er this time, ſome happy Genius or other in the Enthuſiaſtick way would have carried this matter, if poſſible, into farther Fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm, had not Mathematical and Mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Learning, which began to be in faſhion in the laſt Age, put People on a better me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of enquiry and a juſter way of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0490901800:9"/>
            <p>And yet notwithſtanding, ſuch is the prodigious and almoſt inſuperable force of Prejudice and Education, that a great part of this Scheme is ſtill retained, by Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who would think themſelves ill uſed if their Mathematical or Mechanical Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſhould be called in queſtion, under the <hi>Animal Spirits,</hi> notion of to whom they have aſſigned much the ſame Province and Powers, as was done to the <hi>Archaeus</hi> before; with this additional abſurdity, that theſe <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal Spirits</hi> have been treated as mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical and intelligent Agents at the ſame time: of which any one may be convinced, who ſhall think it worth his while to look into and examine the ſeveral Hypotheſes on this Subject.</p>
            <p>AND tho' it muſt be owned, that great advances and improvements have been ſince made, by the Moderns, in natural Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, yet 'tis much to be wiſh'd that a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter method had been taken in the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this to the Animal Oeconomy, the Practice of Phyſick, and the Cure of Diſeaſes. But ſuch has been the hard fate of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, that amidſt all other advances Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0490901800:10"/>has been ſo very little improved, that we have but one <hi>Book</hi> in the World, as far as I know, wherein any general Attempt has been made to apply the true Philoſophy of Nature to the <hi>Animal Oeconomy</hi> and the <hi>Materia Medica;</hi> and this in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion has been executed with ſuch ſucceſs by the Ingenious Author of <hi>the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical Principles of Medicine,</hi> that the Intelligent unprejudiced Reader may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe himſelf to meet, therein, with almoſt every thing that is valuable in the <hi>Theory</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> of Phyſick; erected into one conſiſtent Syſtem, founded on indiſputable Principles, and judiciouſly drawn out into all its uſeful Corollaries and Conſequences. Nay, 'tis a Truth but too plain in fact, that in general we are much declined from the more ſimple and natural methods of cure made uſe of by the <hi>Antients;</hi> and as this has been chiefly owing to our neglecting the true rational Indications and Intentions of Cure, ſo inſtead of applying to this as Nature would direct us, we have been, and ſtill are, continually amuſed with an infinite jumble of Medicines under the notion of <hi>Specifick</hi> Alteratives; as if, by a moſt unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable and unintelligible Tranſmutation,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0490901800:11"/>the morbid Matter could be converted into good Blood and Humours, and retain'd in the Body without injury to the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and there were no need at all of throwing it off by any of the natural Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations. Which idle Conceit is without doubt the Bane of all rational Practice, and the common Cheat by which <hi>Quacks, Empyricks</hi> and Ignorant Pretenders, chowſe and dupe People out of their Money and Lives.</p>
            <p>Now in order to ſhew the Folly and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity of this Notion, and to contribute what lies in my power towards reviving the more natural and rational Practice of the <hi>Antients,</hi> I ſhall in this Eſſay, under diſtinct Sections, conſider the principal Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Medicines, and the manner in which they Act; end herein I ſhall confine my ſelf to ſuch <hi>Simples</hi> as are moſt uſeful and neceſſary in Practice, with due allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for ſome choice of things, in the ſame general Intention, for the better accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of them to the Stomach and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular liking of the Patient: avoiding as much as poſſible all ſuch philoſophical Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations, as have the leaſt tendency to lead
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0490901800:12"/>me beſide my Deſign, or to draw me into any Conſiderations or Enquiries, concerning them, beyond their obvious <hi>ſenſible Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> and <hi>Effects;</hi> which, in my opinion, is the true Boundary of all medicinal Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and the <hi>Ne plus ultra</hi> of the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians Empire.</p>

               <p>IT would be impoſſible to give any ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Account of Diſeaſes and their Cure, without a general knowledge of the Animal Oeconomy and the Method of Nature in preparing, digeſting and ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſeveral Liquors of the Glands, and the principal ends and uſes for which they are intended. And as this can only be known by a careful obſervation of Facts and the method of Nature either in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Health, or in the Formation and Cure of Diſeaſes, where there has been no Interpoſition of Art, and no Reaſonings <hi>à priori</hi> or antecedent to the Facts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: ſo it is no wonder that the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſts
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0490901800:13"/>in all Ages, who deviated from this good old way of the <hi>Antients,</hi> and ſet out with other Views and on other Principles, bewildered themſelves and their Followers, and never arrived at any one point of real and uſeful Knowledge, or made the leaſt Advance or Improvement in the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Healing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE moſt antient Phyſicians, who were always the beſt Philoſophers of their time, grounded their Curative Intentions, upon the moſt obvious and ſenſible Effects of Medicines, as they either promoted or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained this or the other natural Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and thereby corrected any ſuch Error either in Exceſs or Defect. And this moſt obvious and ſenſible Effect, viſible to all By-ſtanders or Obſervers, they called the <hi>Virtue, Power</hi> or <hi>Property</hi> of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine; and herein they never expected or promiſed any ſenſible Effect in the Cure of Diſeaſes, from inſenſible or unknown Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; or, which is the ſame thing, they were not let into the Myſtery of our Modern <hi>Specifick</hi> or <hi>Corpuſculariau</hi> Philoſophy; they did not underſtand the Magick of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0490901800:14"/>Curing Diſeaſes, by <hi>Occult Qualities</hi> in Medicines, or of producing ſenſible Effects without ſenſible Cauſes.</p>
               <p>BUT our Modern Writers upon Phyſick and the Cure of Diſeaſes, have for the moſt part inverted this Order of Nature, by a moſt ungeometrical and immechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Application of Geometry and Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm, to the Animal Structure and Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy: And not a few of the great Maſters and Leaders of the Faculty, have either made their own <hi>Data,</hi> aſſumed falſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples without Proofs, or reaſoned Illogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, by drawing falſe Conſequences from real Facts and juſt Principles. Of this I ſhall give ſome very pregnant and convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Inſtances, that I may not be thought to talk at random, or to lay in a Charge againſt our Modern <hi>Medico</hi>-Philoſophers without Ground or Reaſon: for tho' I love Truth, yet I hate any thing that looks like Malice and Defamation, and had much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be convicted of Ignorance than Diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty.</p>
               <p n="1">1. THEN the <hi>Antients</hi> had obſerv'd, that the ſmall parts of ſome ſorts of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0490901800:15"/>would attract and intimately unite or Incorporate with each other; while the Particles of other ſort of matter, would naturally ſeparate and diſunite, and could not eaſily be Incorporated at all. Thus they obſerv'd that the Particles of <hi>Salts</hi> would readily diſſolve in, and intimately mix and incorporate with <hi>Water,</hi> tho' they are Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifically heavier; and that <hi>Oils</hi> and <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurs</hi> would not do ſo, but, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, diſunite, ſeparate and repel each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whatever their different Specifick Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities might be.</p>
               <p>THEY obſerv'd likewiſe in the Animal Body, that the ſeveral parts to be ſupply'd and nouriſh'd, would attract, imbibe and retain their proper Nutritive Matter, and repel or drive on any other ſort of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, not fit for ſuch a purpoſe; and theſe different Powers or Properties, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſorts of Matter which they obſerv'd to be ſo obvious and viſible to the Senſes, they call'd <hi>Sympathy</hi> and <hi>Antipathy,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing the Cauſes of it, or ſo much as pretending to reaſon from it <hi>à priori.</hi> And here therefore they could mean no
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0490901800:16"/>more by it, than we do by <hi>Centripetal</hi> and <hi>Centrifugal Forces,</hi> or the mutual <hi>Attracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and <hi>Repulſion</hi> of the ſeveral parts of Matter. The moſt antient Philoſophers and Phyſicians therefore had as clear and diſtinct Ideas of their <hi>Sympathy</hi> and <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy,</hi> and underſtood what they meant by it, as well as we do the <hi>Gravity</hi> and <hi>Vis Inertiae</hi> of Bodies in general, the <hi>Elaſtici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of the <hi>Air,</hi> or the <hi>Preſſure</hi> of <hi>Fluids,</hi> and the different degrees of <hi>Attraction</hi> in Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. And, 'tis more than probable, were theſe Gentlemen now living, and ask'd to explain themſelves on this Subject, that they might tell us they would aſſign the Cauſes of what they called <hi>Sympathy</hi> and <hi>Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> as ſoon as we had explained and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned the Cauſes of any of the other Facts and ſenſible Appearances before mentioned; and that till we could do this, we ſhould in reality be no wiſer than they.</p>
               <p>IT muſt be own'd that this Doctrine was afterwards very much corrupted and abuſed, and apply'd to a thouſand Caſes, where it could have no place, as the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patetick Philoſophy</hi> grew into Vogue, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0490901800:17"/>came to be more and more celebrated in the <hi>Schools.</hi> For in this Philoſophy, <hi>Words</hi> were never intended to ſignify any real Facts, Appearances or <hi>Phaenomena</hi> in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but only the unknown Cauſes, or internal Conſtitutions of Things. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was a ſhort way of talking, about every thing known or unknown, but a round-about way to Knowledge, as it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver produced any. But as this cannot affect the more antient Phyſicians and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, or thoſe who lived after <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s time who ſtill built their Knowledge of Nature upon Obſervation, Experiment and Fact, as much as if no ſuch Philoſopher had ever been born; ſo it is certain that no other real Improvement of natural Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge has ever been made, or ever can be made, on any other Plan whatſoever.</p>
               <p>WHEN the <hi>Antients</hi> were miſtaken, it was generally owing to want of clearer Facts or <hi>Data</hi> to reaſon upon; but the Moderns, by wrong Reaſoning upon Facts, and drawing falſe Conſequences from <hi>Things</hi> given, have run into more and groſſer Errors, than had ever been known before. In ſhort, the moſt <hi>Antient Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0490901800:18"/>were very good <hi>Modern Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi> in every thing relating to their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,</hi> whatever they might be as to other parts of Nature; while the Generality of the <hi>Moderns,</hi> tho' very good Philoſophers in other Reſpects, are yet, with regard to the Medical Art, in ſpite of all the <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonian</hi> Principles and Diſcoveries, down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right <hi>Atomiſts</hi> or <hi>Ariſtotelians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Antients knew nothing of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of the Blood, from the Heart thro' the Arteries and back again by the return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Veins; nor of the particular Ducts thro' which part of the Chyle is conveyed from the Stomach to the Subclavian Veins. But the Moderns having made theſe Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, let us conſider ſome of the Fruits of it, and the Conſequences they have drawn from it.</p>
               <p>FROM the <hi>Circulation</hi> of the <hi>Blood,</hi> as a Fact given, it has been commonly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that the Action of the Heart, in its alternate <hi>Syſtole</hi> and <hi>Diaſtole,</hi> is the whole Force and adequate Power, by which the Blood is moved in the courſe of its Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.

                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0490901800:21"/>Knowing therefore that the Blood Circulates, and preſuming that the Heart is the moving Force or Power, this Power has been exactly computed, at a great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of Geometry and Mechaniſm. And herein the Gentlemen, who have applyed themſelves to this, have ſucceeded ſo well and come ſo near together, that they have differed only about the Force of the Heart, in the proportion of 500000 to I; for this, upon a juſt Computation, will be found to be nearly the Difference, between Dr. <hi>James Keil,</hi> and the famous <hi>Borelli</hi> in his Book <hi>de Motu Animalium.</hi> But in the mean while, might it not be as well to be quite ignorant of the <hi>Circulation</hi> of the <hi>Blood,</hi> as not to be able to apply it to better Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe? Did not the Antients <hi>Bleed,</hi> when occaſion required, before they knew any thing at all of the <hi>Circulation</hi> of the <hi>Blood?</hi> Nay, did they not uſe <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> with more Judgment and Succeſs, by opening a Vein as near as poſſible to the Part affected; while the Moderns have abſurdly run into the contrary Practice, againſt Fact and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, as well as the Reaſon and Nature of Things; by falſly concluding that 'twould
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0490901800:22"/>be indifferent from what part of the Body Blood ſhould be drawn, ſince, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the <hi>Circulation,</hi> the <hi>Aequilibri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> of the Vital Fluid would neceſſarily be ſoon reſtored again. Or has the Knowledge of the <hi>Circulation,</hi> by any Uſe or Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whatever that has yet been made of it, at all improved the Art of Healing?</p>
               <p>BUT farther, from the Diſcovery of the <hi>Chyliferous Ducts,</hi> which terminate chiefly in the left Subclavian Vein, tho' they are often found in the Right too, it has been concluded that the whole quantity of Chyle, and every thing that can be conveyed from the Stomach thro' the Lacteals, muſt paſs <hi>this way</hi> into the Blood-Veſſels; and that this <hi>Matter</hi> muſt afterwards be derived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain from the Blood in the Arteries, by the Glandular Secretory Ducts, before there can be any ſuch thing as <hi>Animal Nutrition</hi> or <hi>Evacuation.</hi> But as this is contrary to all the Phaenomena of <hi>Animal Nature,</hi> and demonſtratively falſe in Fact, it could not poſſibly have ever entered into the Heads of Men, who had not had the vaſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of <hi>Modern Diſcoverys</hi> in Phyſick.</p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0490901800:23"/>
               <p>ANY Man, I think, who has made the leaſt reflection upon this Matter, if not too ſtrongly prejudiced, or accuſtomed to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way of thinking, muſt be convinced that the <hi>Natural Evacuations,</hi> in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed or diminiſhed Quantities, do not at all follow the Laws and Conditions of the <hi>Sanguineous Circulation,</hi> or the increaſed or diminiſh'd Velocity and <hi>Momentum</hi> of the Blood; but that one may be increaſed while the other is diminiſhed, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce their Effects reciprocally. In Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory and Effluent <hi>Fevers,</hi> where the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity and <hi>Impetus</hi> of the Blood is greateſt, the natural Secretions and Evacuations are generally greatly diminiſh'd. And, on the contrary, in the Paroxiſms of <hi>Diabetical, Hypochondriacal</hi> and <hi>Hyſterick</hi> Diſorders, we often find a very great and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>Profluvium</hi> of Urine, where the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of the Blood is very low and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid, or almoſt quite ſuſpended; which could not poſſibly happen, I think, if theſe Evacuations were made from the <hi>Arterial Blood,</hi> and depended on the Velocity and <hi>Impetus</hi> of that Fluid.</p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0490901800:24"/>
               <p>IN <hi>Atrophys</hi> we frequently ſee People, running off all their Fleſh, till they are reduced to mere Skin and Bones, and yet the Blood-Veſſels remain ſtill full and turgid, and the Blood, upon opening a Vein, comes off with ſufficient Force and Freedom, and there are no Symptoms, or Indications at all, of any Diminution or Defect of that Fluid.</p>
               <p>IN a <hi>Dropſy</hi> every thing that is drank, or taken in of a fluid Nature, fills up and diſtends the Ventricles of the Glands, the Lymphatick Ducts, and Membranous Cells throughout the Body ſtill more and more; while the quantity of Blood, upon the whole, is not at all increaſed, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther much leſſened and diminiſhed: And <hi>Bleeding,</hi> in this Caſe, is ſo far from leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or abating any ſuch Glandular, Lympha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick or Membranous <hi>Plethora,</hi> that, on the contrary, it rather increaſes, ſtrengthens and confirms it: And farther, in this Caſe ſuch a <hi>Plethora,</hi> or Redundancy of Water, may be all drawn off, and diſcharg'd by <hi>Urine, Stools, Sweating,</hi> &amp;c. without affecting
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0490901800:25"/>or altering the State of the Blood, ſo far as can be diſcovered, either as to its Quantity or Quality.</p>
               <p>THESE Facts; and Obſervations, to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion no more, are I think ſufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, that there is no ſuch Intercourſe and Communication between the Glands and Membranous Cells and the Blood, as is commonly Imagined; and that a Defect, or Redundancy, may happen in either inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of each other, and conſequently that thoſe Lacteals, which convey a certain portion of the Chyle from the Stomach, to be emptyed into the <hi>Blood-Veſſels,</hi> may receive either more or leſs than their ſhare, as well as thoſe which are to carry off and convey the ſame to the <hi>Breaſts, Kidneys, Cutaneous Ducts, &amp;c.</hi> and this indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on each other, as the Recipients, lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to one part or the Other, may either be too <hi>Lax</hi> and <hi>Open,</hi> or too much <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringed</hi> and <hi>Obſtructed.</hi> And from hence it is, that we find ſome Perſons and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions very much inclined and diſpoſed to collect and accumulate Blood, while they are ſtill <hi>Thin</hi> and <hi>Lean</hi> in Fleſh; and others to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0490901800:26"/>grow <hi>Fat</hi> and <hi>Fleſhy,</hi> with a Scarcity and Defect of Blood at the ſame time. Which yet, as plain and evident as it is in Fact, I think, could not poſſibly happen upon the Modern <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of Secretion, or if the whole quantity of <hi>Chyle</hi> or <hi>Nutriment</hi> from the Stomach, were to be conveyed and thrown into the Blood, before any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part could be ſupplyed with the Same.</p>
               <p>ANOTHER modern Diſcovery in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, as a Conſequence of the former, is this, That there is no ſuch thing as different <hi>Fermentations, Digeſtions,</hi> and <hi>Separations</hi> of <hi>Liquors</hi> in the Ventricles of the Glands, from different Degrees of <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> but that all the variety of the different Secretions, is effected by a ſimple <hi>Colature</hi> from the Arterial Blood, thro' ſmall Pipes of different Diameters, and which will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of Fluid Particles of one Size, but not of another, without any <hi>Glandular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction</hi> whatſoever. Now if any body had a mind to look like a <hi>Mechanician</hi> and <hi>Chemiſt,</hi> without being one the <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linian</hi> Doctrine, would ſoon furniſh him with Words that might ſound very well;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0490901800:27"/>and a Man who is well verſed in that <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis,</hi> may poſſibly be thought a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Philoſopher, while he is talking the greateſt and moſt egregious Nonſenſe in the World. For tho' we ſee every Day, and in the whole Oeconomy and Proceſs of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, very great Changes and Tranſmuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made upon Fluids by <hi>Fermentation</hi> and <hi>Digeſtion,</hi> under different Degrees of <hi>Heat, Rarefaction</hi> and <hi>Inteſtine Motion,</hi> yet no Man could ever obſerve any ſuch Thing effected by any ſort of <hi>Colature</hi> or Straining whatſoever. And when theſe Gentlemen will be pleaſed to give us any Inſtances of turning <hi>Muſt</hi> into <hi>Wine, Wort</hi> into <hi>Beer,</hi> or <hi>Chyle</hi> into <hi>Milk, Urine, Bile,</hi> &amp;c. by <hi>Straining,</hi> it will then be time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to conſider this Matter farther; but, in the mean while, if they will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced to the contrary themſelves, I hope they will give me and ſome others leave to laugh at ſuch an <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> at leaſt, till they are better able to ſupport it.</p>
               <p>THE Antients, tho' they had not the uſe of <hi>Microſcopes,</hi> the Method of <hi>Injecting</hi> the <hi>Veſſels,</hi> and ſeveral other Helps with
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0490901800:28"/>which Providence has favour'd us, yet they were very careful and diligent Obſervers of all the obvious ſenſible Appearances, or <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature, in the Animal Structure and Oeconomy. And from hence they form'd Judgments and Concluſions more certain and ſucceſsful, concerning the Formation and Cure of Diſeaſes, than ever the Moderns have done from a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of moſt precarious and falſe <hi>Hypotheſes,</hi> under the pretence of a better Application of Geometry, Mechaniſm and Philoſophy, to Phyſick and the Animal Oeconomy. The pretended Fermentations of <hi>Acids</hi> and <hi>Alkalys</hi> in the Blood; the various Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the Chemical Principles of <hi>Salt, Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> in the Body, and the Effects from thence ariſing; the motive Power of the <hi>Animal Spirits,</hi> together with their ſeveral <hi>Suffocations</hi> and <hi>Exploſions, Concentrations</hi> and <hi>Diſſipations;</hi> the <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick Tranſmutations</hi> of morbid Matter, and the Miraculous Power of <hi>Medicinal Corpuſcles</hi> upon the Blood; the myſterious Effects of <hi>Straining,</hi> or the Preparation of all the different Liquors of the Glands, by a Simple <hi>Colature</hi> from the Blood in the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0490901800:29"/>Arteries, Theſe are ſome of the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> which the Moderns have aſſumed and argued upon, as Facts, without the leaſt Ground or Reaſon from any of the reaſt Appearances or <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature: And, to which I ſhall here only add one more, as the Crown and Glory of all the reſt, namely, that the <hi>Blood,</hi> in its Circulation, moves it ſelf by means of the <hi>Animal Spirits,</hi> which are, at the ſame time, moved by the <hi>Blood.</hi> For, in this <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis,</hi> the <hi>Blood</hi> cannot move till the Heart contracts, by the Influx of the <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> from the Nerves; and, on the other hand, the <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> cannot flow thro' the Nerves into the Heart, till they have been ſeparated in the Brain, by the prior Motion or <hi>Circulation</hi> of the <hi>Blood.</hi> So that herein 'tis evident, that they are both ſuppoſed as the Antecedent Cauſes and Conſequent Effects of each other; and the <hi>Blood,</hi> in this way of accounting for its Circulation, can have no Motion but what it communicates to, and returns upon it Self; and this againſt a conſtant Reſiſtance, without any prior independent <hi>Moving Force</hi> at all. Which is juſt as good Senſe
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0490901800:30"/>as if any one ſhould aſſign the Weight, Spring, or <hi>Moving Force,</hi> applyed to the Wheels, or Pullies, as the Cauſe of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Clock, Watch, Crane, or other <hi>Machine,</hi> and at the ſame time ſuppoſe the Motion of the <hi>Engine,</hi> to be the Cauſe of the Weight, Spring, or <hi>Moving Force.</hi> But this, notwithſtanding all the expence of Geometry and Mechaniſm that has been laid out upon it, by its great <hi>Patrons</hi> and Defenders, and its being ſo generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd on their <hi>Authority,</hi> as a firſt Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Phyſick, is an evident Impoſſibility.</p>
               <p>THE firſt and beſt Philoſophers and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, who apply'd themſelves to the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the <hi>Animal Oeconomy,</hi> by obſerving the great Alteration made upon our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Food, by <hi>Fermentation</hi> and <hi>Digeſtion</hi> in the Stomach, whereby a Liquor was prepared to be afterwards farther conveyed to the ſeveral Parts of the Body, while the Excrementitious Indigeſtible Parts of the Aliment were ſeparated, forced forward, and thrown out of the Body, carryed this Reaſoning, by Analogy of Nature, to the other Glands and Ventricles of the Body, where they ſuppoſed a farther <hi>Concoction</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0490901800:31"/>might, in like manner, be made and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Liquors prepared and ſeparated, under different Degrees of <hi>Digeſtive Heat</hi> and <hi>Motion,</hi> ſo as to anſwer the ſeveral Ends and Purpoſes of the <hi>Animal Conſtitution.</hi> And herein they argued right, and grounded their Principles upon the true Method and Oeconomy of Nature in all other like Caſes. But how far the Moderns have mended this Theory, or any other practical Principle of the Antients, by any of the foregoing <hi>Hypotheſes,</hi> or by their clearer Knowledge of Anatomy, I may leave any one to judge.</p>
               <p>BUT, beſides the Virtues, Properties or ſenſible Effects of Medicines, as they viſibly promoted or reſtrained this or the other natural Evacuation, the firſt and moſt ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful Students of this part of Nature, had another Claſs of <hi>Powers</hi> and <hi>Properties</hi> in things given, as they viſibly and ſenſibly affected the <hi>Animal Conſtitution,</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Primary or <hi>Elementary Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> as they choſe to call them, of <hi>Heat Cold, Moiſture</hi> and <hi>Dryneſs.</hi> Or which is the ſame thing, as Things given, whether
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0490901800:32"/>a Medicine or Diet, were found to <hi>Heat</hi> or <hi>Cool, Moiſten</hi> or <hi>Dry</hi> the Solids in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. And upon this they founded their Notion of the four Principal Primary or Elementary Conſtitutions of <hi>Hot</hi> and <hi>Dry, Hot</hi> and <hi>Moiſt, Cold</hi> and <hi>Dry,</hi> and <hi>Cold</hi> and <hi>Moiſt.</hi> Where theſe primary Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Qualities were found to be ſo equally mix'd and contemperated, as that any one of them did not abound or prevail againſt the reſt, this was called the <hi>Natural Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature</hi> or State of Health; For while theſe <hi>Elementary Qualities</hi> were duly tempered and equally blended together, the Body remain'd Sound and Well, and performed all its Functions regularly and in good Order; and no Diſeaſe or Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature could ever be obſerv'd, but upon the Prevalency of ſome one, or more, of theſe Qualities above the others: And from hence in every Diſeaſe the prevailing Humours were diſtinguiſhed into <hi>Blood, Phlegm, Choler</hi> or <hi>Bile,</hi> and <hi>Melancholy</hi> or <hi>Black Bile:</hi> and the general Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were from thence denominated, either <hi>Sanguine, Phlegmatick, Cholorick,</hi> or <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy,</hi> as this or that Humour prevail'd
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0490901800:33"/>or had the Aſcendency in particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>Now this, I think, is plain Senſe and talking very Intelligibly; and the Moderns, who have found out other <hi>Hypotheſes,</hi> better Methods of Reaſoning in Phyſick, and nearer Ways to Health, as the <hi>Event</hi> has plainly prov'd, cannot pretend to be Ignorant of what the Antients meant by <hi>Blood, Phlegm, Choler</hi> or <hi>Bile,</hi> tho' they have been mightily puzzled to know what was underſtood and intended by their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick Humour or <hi>Black Bile.</hi> And yet he who does not underſtand this, muſt either never have practiſed Phyſick, or elſe never have made any Obſervations and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on what he has ſeen and met with in Practice. For, in my Opinion, 'tis extreamly clear that the antient Phyſicians neither did, nor could, underſtand any thing elſe, by their <hi>Melancholia</hi> or <hi>Bilis Atra,</hi> but the Bile corrupted, vitiated, and dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated from its natural State and Uſe; in which caſe it always turns <hi>Black,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a peccant diſtempered Humour. It is true, indeed, that all the Humours by
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0490901800:34"/>Stagnation, Corruption and Fermentation, may change their Original Colours and Qualities, as well as the <hi>Bile,</hi> which was as well known to the Antients as to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns, and taken notice of by them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; but yet this <hi>Corrupt Bile,</hi> when it prevails, is ſo very extenſive in its Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, and productive of ſo many and great Diſeaſes, even where no <hi>Jaundice</hi> enſues, that it was juſtly taken notice of and diſtinguiſhed, by them, as one of the Principal General <hi>Morbid Conſtitutions:</hi> And eſpecially, as this Diſtemperature of the Bile naturally, and almoſt conſtantly, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends a <hi>Cold</hi> and <hi>Dry</hi> State and Habit of Body, or a prevalency of Cold and Dryneſs, above Heat and Moiſture, in the General Conſtitution.</p>
               <p>I am aware ſome trifling Objections may be made to what I have advanced here; but as they would all terminate in this, that the Antients could not always expreſs themſelves accurately enough to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the Moderns; ſo in anſwer to them, without mentioning the particular Objections, it may be only ſaid in general,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0490901800:35"/>that the Moderns, in this Caſe, have been equally culpable, in that they have not been always able to expreſs themſelves, with ſufficient Clearneſs, to be underſtood by one another. But for any one groſs Abſurdity, or Falſhood in Fact, which any Man ſhall produce from the <hi>Antients,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Cauſe, Formation and Cure of Diſeaſes; I will undertake, in defence of the <hi>Moderns</hi> upon this Article, to give him five.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Antients</hi> had, indeed, a particular Notion that the <hi>Blood</hi> is made in the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> to which <hi>Viſcus</hi> they aſcribed the Act of <hi>Sanguification.</hi> This Opinion has been perhaps juſtly rejected by the Moderns, tho' they have not been able yet to ſettle any thing in the room of it; and therefore have had no ground for the Laugh. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, it ſeems, fell into this Miſtake for want of a clearer Knowledge of Anatomy. Well, be it ſo; but how have the Moderns rectified this Error, by their farther Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, and better Acquaintance with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal Structure and Oeconomy; or to what particular <hi>Organ</hi> do they aſcribe this
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0490901800:36"/>Act of Sanguification? Perhaps it may be anſwered, with ſome Triumph here, that the Caſe is now very plain, and that ſince the Diſcovery of the <hi>Elaſticity</hi> of the Air, 'tis evident enough that the <hi>Lungs</hi> are the only proper Sanguifying Organs; where, by the Intromiſſion of a fine <hi>Elaſtick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> theſe Globules are form'd and blown up. But this is a very ſtrange Account of the Matter, indeed, ſince 'tis certain, in Fact, that theſe <hi>Globules</hi> are ſpecifically heavier, inſtead of being lighter than the <hi>Serum.</hi> And conſequently, that they cannot be Veſicles or Bubbles fill'd and blown up with Air. And had one therefore a mind to maintain the Argument, for the ſake of the Jeſt, it would be no great difficulty, in my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to defend the <hi>Liver</hi> againſt the <hi>Lungs,</hi> in ſpite of all ſuch Reaſonings as this.</p>
               <p>BUT he who would follow the Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Nature, and build his Opinion herein on plain Facts and Obſervations, may perhaps ſee Reaſon to conclude, that the Act of <hi>Sanguification</hi> is not appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to any particular <hi>Viſcus</hi> or Bowel,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0490901800:37"/>that the <hi>Lungs</hi> contribute only their ſhare in the Operation, and that the Blood re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives its peculiar Type and Form in the <hi>Arteries,</hi> where it undergoes the higheſt Degrees of <hi>Heat, Impetus</hi> and <hi>Motion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FOR we may obſerve, in Old People, where the natural Heat, and Elaſtick Tone of the Solids are much impaired, that the Blood grows paler, fainter, and runs more into Water, and that the Globular Part or <hi>Cremor</hi> ſenſibly leſſens in proportion to the <hi>Serum.</hi> And this likewiſe is remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the Caſe in a <hi>Chloroſis,</hi> or, indeed, any Obſtruction of the <hi>Menſtrual Secretion</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with <hi>Chillineſs, Lowneſs, Pallor</hi> and <hi>Languor:</hi> In which Caſes we often ſee the <hi>Globules</hi> almoſt loſt, and the Blood is little elſe but <hi>Serum.</hi> But, by reſtoring the natural Heat, and ſtrengthning the Elaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Tone of the Arteries, theſe Globules ſoon riſe again, and the <hi>Craſſamentum</hi> or <hi>Cremor</hi> is reduced to its natural and due State, whether this be done by any Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Means or External only.</p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0490901800:38"/>
               <p>THUS it may likewiſe be obſerved, that People of <hi>Hot, Bilioſe,</hi> and <hi>Sanguine</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, whoſe Fibres are more firm and tenſe, and where conſequently the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Force and Action of the Solids is ſtronger and more vigorous, than in other <hi>Temperaments,</hi> have proportionally more <hi>Cremor</hi> in the Blood than others; and, in ſome high Inflammatory <hi>Fevers,</hi> where the Elaſtick Force of the Solids is ſtill greater and more exalted, the Blood becomes almoſt all <hi>Cremor,</hi> and affords but very little <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> after it has ſtood many Hours in a cold Place. Now, from theſe Obſervations, to mention no more at preſent, it may perhaps be juſtly concluded, that the Blood receives this Form from the Heat and Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boration it undergoes in the Arteries.</p>
               <p>BUT to reſume and conſider a little far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the natural Conſtitutions, as depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Primary or <hi>Elementary Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> above mentioned, it may be proper to take notice, that the true alterative Method of the Antients, conſiſted in regulating and moderating theſe natural Conſtitutions and primary Qualities. And this they did not
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0490901800:39"/>pretend to do by <hi>Specifick Alteratives,</hi> in the Modern Quack Senſe, or by any <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Qualities,</hi> or Magical Effect, of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines on the Blood, where People were not to know what they took, or after what manner they were to expect Relief, but by a skilful Direction and Regimen in the Uſe of thoſe Things, which have, I know not for what Reaſon, been common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called the <hi>Non-Naturals,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Diet, Air, Exerciſe,</hi> &amp;c. But I ſhould rather chuſe to call theſe the <hi>Univerſals</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutionals,</hi> becauſe the Original Natural Conſtitutions and Primary Qualities do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt entirely, abſolutely and univerſally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon them, ſo far as Moderating and Tempering them can fall under the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of a Phyſician.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Ale</hi> Diet increaſes the Craſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſament of the Blood, and accumulates <hi>Fat</hi> more than any thing elſe; it oilifies and enriches the Blood, and promotes the Heat and Humidity of the Conſtitution, which is the Characteriſtick of that Temperament which by the Antients was call'd <hi>Sanguine.</hi> But when this Conſtitution becomes In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0490901800:40"/>and Morbid, it is the Foundation of all thoſe Diſeaſes which are owing to an overgrowth of Fat, and a too thick and rich Blood.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Milk</hi> and <hi>Vegetable Diet,</hi> join'd with <hi>Water-Drinking,</hi> encreaſes the <hi>Serum</hi> of the Blood more than the <hi>Craſſament.</hi> It cools, refrigerates and moiſtens the Habit or Conſtitution, moderately contracts the Solids, and promotes the Alvine and Uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Diſcharges. But it has not the ſame Effect on the Cutaneous Evacuations by <hi>Sweat</hi> and <hi>Perſpiration,</hi> which it rather leſſens and reſtrains. And yet, by joining this Regimen in Diet to a moderate uſe of warm Liquors, or ſuch as contain a <hi>Vinous Spirit,</hi> any immoderate Check or Reſtraint of Perſpiration may eaſily be prevented: As, on the other hand, <hi>Vegetables</hi> and <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-drinking</hi> are, in a good meaſure, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventatives of the ill Conſequences, which might otherwiſe follow, from the too free Uſe of a <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Ale</hi> Diet.</p>
               <p>THE Choice of <hi>Air</hi> is undoubtedly of the utmoſt Conſequence to moderate and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0490901800:41"/>reduce a Conſtitution, when it grows into any Intemperature; and here the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Air, with regard to the Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Qualities above mentioned, compared with the Conſtitution of the Patient, will afford any Man a ſure and unerring Rule in the choice of <hi>Air.</hi> For 'tis certain that any Error of Conſtitution ought to be rectifyed and reduced by the contrary Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Quality of the Air, and no body would chuſe a <hi>Hot Air</hi> for a too <hi>Hot Conſtitution,</hi> or a <hi>Cold Air</hi> for a <hi>Cold One,</hi> and ſo of the Reſt.</p>
               <p>IN a <hi>Phthiſis,</hi> or natural Weakneſs of the Lungs, the ſofteſt and warmeſt Air is to be choſen, provided it be not too Thick, <hi>Moiſt</hi> and <hi>Boggy.</hi> But in an <hi>Aſthma, Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,</hi> Weakneſs and Relaxation of the <hi>Nerves,</hi> and almoſt in all thin declining Habits where the Lungs are ſound, a thin, cool, dry and <hi>Elaſtick Air,</hi> is always beſt and moſt eligible. But Groſs, Fat and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulent People can never be much mended by any Air, without a cooling attenuating Vegetable Diet and proper Exerciſe.</p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0490901800:42"/>
               <p>OF all Exerciſes for Health, as well as Pleaſure, nothing can ſtand in Competition with <hi>Riding</hi> and <hi>Swimming;</hi> which won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully brace the Nerves and Solids in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, reſtore their Elaſtick Tone, open Obſtructions, and promote the ſeveral na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Secretions and Evacuations, beyond any other <hi>Gymnaſtick Regimen</hi> whatſoever.</p>
               <p>MODERATE <hi>Sleep</hi> is the great <hi>Solamen</hi> and Reſtorative of Nature, by which the Organs are warm'd, moiſtned and lubrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the ſeveral Springs of Motion wound up, and prepared for farther Action in the waking Hours. But in this Caſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Indulgence of Sleep, or Overwatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Want of Sleep, are equally injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to, and produce different and contrary Effects upon, the Conſtitution. For <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Sleeping</hi> checks and reſtrains all the natural Secretions and Evacuations, weakens and relaxes the whole Animal Frame, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the Tone of the Muſcles, and induces ſuch a weak, cold, humid and flabby State of the Nerves, as threatens a <hi>Palſy,</hi> and frequently terminates in one; which I have more than once known to be the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of it.</p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0490901800:43"/>
               <p>ON the other hand, <hi>Overwatching</hi> and the Want of natural Sleep, wears and waſtes the whole Animal Conſtitution, heats the Blood, drys and contracts the Nerves, and, in fine, either kills with a <hi>Fever</hi> attended with a <hi>Phrenſy,</hi> or induces a <hi>Mania, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy,</hi> or Diſtraction of ſome ſort or other, as is but too commonly ſeen and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Paſſions</hi> have ſo great a ſhare in the Conſtitutions and Diſeaſes of the Body, that, in my Opinion, this ought to be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned one of the principal Provinces of Phyſick; and indeed, with a Saving to the Divines, I think Phyſicians are the fitteſt Perſons to apply a proper Relief, under thoſe great <hi>Emotions</hi> and <hi>Perturbations of Mind;</hi> which either ariſe from the Body at firſt, or are ſoon <hi>materializ'd</hi> by a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with it. For theſe Paſſions are all either pleaſing or painful Images, and have juſt the ſame Effect upon the Conſtitution, whether they ariſe from things without us, or have their Original from the Mind with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0490901800:44"/>
               <p>'TIS evident that the pleaſurable and painful Paſſions, have very different and even quite contrary Effects upon the Blood, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and reſpective Organs of the Body, of which a Mechanical Account and Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, may be ſeen in the Ingenious Dr. <hi>Morgan's Philoſophical Principles of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine;</hi> a Book that can never be too much ſtudyed by the young Phyſician, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to make a Figure in his Profeſſion, and would build his Practice on plain Facts and indiſputable Principles. To that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, therefore, I ſhall refer the curious Reader; where, I can aſſure him, he will find this Subject: touch'd with uncommon Delicacy, and ſee the Origin, and different Modifications, of the Paſſions beautifully deſcribed, and their Effects on the Animal Organiſm, in a ſtrong and maſterly manner, Anatomically delineated and Mechanically accounted for: Which makes it the leſs neceſſary for me to enter farther into the Theory of the Matter here.</p>
               <p>'TIS evident in Fact that <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Joy</hi> warm the Blood, diffuſe the natural Heat, raiſe the Pulſe, and take off any Irritation
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0490901800:45"/>or painful <hi>Stimulus</hi> upon the Organs; and that <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Grief</hi> produce the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Effects to all theſe. But 'tis obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that <hi>Grief</hi> is the moſt ſinking, waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, diſanimating Paſſion of all; for <hi>Fear</hi> very often inſpires the Perſon Affected, with a Reſolution and Courage proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to the apparent or apprehended Danger, and thereby arms him, with ſuitable Strength and Firmneſs, to encounter with the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties before him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Joy</hi> affect the Blood and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours much after the ſame manner with <hi>Vinous Spirits, Opiates,</hi> and other ſuch Exhilerating <hi>Volatiles;</hi> but <hi>Grief</hi> and <hi>Fear</hi> when they are ſtrong and overbearing, with <hi>Acids</hi> and <hi>Salts</hi> upon the Stomach; <hi>i. e.</hi> they affect the Organs with Pain, lower the Pulſe, repel the natural Heat, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm a Man of Spirit, Strength and Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or, perhaps, keep him conſtantly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake and attentive to the painful diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Scene, till he has quite loſt his Senſes. From this ſhort Account of the Mechanical and moſt obvious Effects of the Paſſions, the Methods of relieving them when they
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0490901800:46"/>grow Exorbitant, may be eaſily drawn; and there is no need that I ſhould farther inſiſt on it here. I had ſome thought indeed of being larger on the conſideration of theſe <hi>Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutionals,</hi> which we ſo improperly call <hi>Non-Naturals;</hi> but the Bounds to which I muſt confine my Self, in this <hi>Eſſay,</hi> will not permit of a longer Detail at preſent; and I muſt, therefore, refer a more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and diſtinct Account of theſe Matters, to ſome fitter Opportunity.</p>

               <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the vaſtneſs of this Subject, I have no deſign to write a Volume upon it, nor do I think it neceſſary. But conſidering the Bulk to which the <hi>Materia Medica</hi> is grown, 'tis certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I think, high time to come to ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Limitations and Reſtrictions concerning it, before it is quite run out into <hi>Infinity.</hi> For, to ſuch an exceſſive Degree is this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter grown already, that a Man had almoſt as good read over all the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:0490901800:47"/>and Laws of <hi>England,</hi> as the Books of Phyſick, and the infinite Jumble and Confuſion of Remedys of one ſort or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. I am ſenſible, indeed, that the beſt and ableſt Phyſicians among us, have very much reduced the <hi>Materia Medica,</hi> and brought it into a narrow Compaſs with reſpect to their own Practice; but this is no advantage to thoſe who have not bought their Experience at ſo dear a rate, or who have not had opportunitys of making tryals themſelves, but muſt ſtill go on, in their Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, upon the Judgments of ſuch as have pretended to vaſt Experience before them, and who have, hereupon, cryed up a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious number of <hi>Simple</hi> and <hi>Compound Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies</hi> as infallible, and fill'd large Volumes with them, when, perhaps, few or none of them, upon tryal, will be found to anſwer their Character. So that, amidſt this huge Lumber, a young Practitioner muſt ſtill be continually ſifting out a Medicine, for his purpoſe, in moſt Caſes, like a <hi>Pearl</hi> in the common <hi>Rubbiſh,</hi> or a Needle in a Heap of Sand.</p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:0490901800:48"/>
               <p>THIS Uncertainty and Confuſion in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, have not ariſen from any of the obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Senſible Properties</hi> or <hi>Effects</hi> of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, as they affect the <hi>Natural Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> or the Primary <hi>Conſtitutional Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;</hi> for here the Practice ſtands upon a pretty good certainty: but only from the vain and fruitleſs ſearch after <hi>Specificks,</hi> in the modern abſurd Senſe, or rather <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe,</hi> of the Word. This, as the Matter appears to me, has been the true Cauſe of all ſuch Darkneſs and Obſcurity, as we find the <hi>Materia Medica</hi> under to this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Day. I ſhall therefore, under this Sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, lay down ſome Principles, well eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in Fact, which may ſerve as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny certain Rules of Judgment, whereby the young Phyſician may govern himſelf in the choice Medicines, ſo as to render his Practice leſs precarious and uncertain, than it otherwiſe might be, upon his firſt ſetting out in the World. And herein, I ſhall proceed in this plain and natural Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, by conſidering how far the ſeveral Parts of the <hi>Materia Medica,</hi> as it now ſtands, are <hi>Digeſtible</hi> or <hi>Indigeſtible;</hi> in what <hi>Caſes</hi> and under what <hi>Circumſtances,</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:0490901800:49"/>they are capable of paſſing the <hi>Lacteals</hi> and mixing with the Blood; and what <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects</hi> may be expected from them, when they get there, which will take in all I intend to ſay on this Subject.</p>
               <p n="1">1. THEN it is certain, that nothing can paſs the <hi>Lacteals,</hi> but what has been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly liquified, and reduced to an <hi>Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vium,</hi> or an exceeding fine, thin and rarefy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Vapour.</hi> Not only the Fibrous <hi>Solid</hi> Parts of our common Food, but likewiſe the more fix'd <hi>Oils</hi> and <hi>Salts,</hi> with which it abounds, are incapable of being diſſolved, liquifyed and volatiliz'd, by the <hi>Digeſtive Heat</hi> and Action of the Stomach, and the <hi>Attractive Power</hi> of the Lacteals; and therefore the Reſidue of the Aliment, which cannot be reſolved, attenuated and fluxili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, by ſuch a degree of Heat and Motion during the time of Concoction, are by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture precipitated, thruſt forward and eject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the Body, thro' the common Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Excretory Ducts and Paſſages. Now, if ſo conſiderable a Part of our common Aliment, which has no ſtronger or cloſer Texture than that of the <hi>Vegetable</hi> and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0490901800:50"/>
                  <hi>Animal Solids,</hi> cannot be ſo far diſſolved and attenuated in the Stomach, as to be ſtrain'd off thro' the Lacteals; what ſhall we ſay to thoſe vaſtly more ſolid and compact Subſtances which are often given as <hi>Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick Alteratives?</hi> or by what <hi>Chemiſtry,</hi> or <hi>Mechaniſm,</hi> can our Specificians pretend to convey ſuch Subſtances as theſe into the Blood, without firſt rendering them, by ſome previous Operation, <hi>Soluble</hi> and <hi>Flux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilizable</hi> in Water?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sulphur, Aethiops, Cinnabar, Antimony, Mineral Bezoar,</hi> and univerſally all <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Glebes</hi> and <hi>Metalline Calces,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate nothing to Boiling Water, but their Parts remain fix'd, inſeparable and unalterable, againſt all the Power of ſuch a degree of Heat and Motion; which is yet vaſtly greater than can be produced, by the natural digeſtive Heat and Action of the Stomach, during the time of Concoction. Nay, if the Parts of any ſuch ſolid cohering Subſtances be firſt of all broken and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, as far as poſſible, by any Grinding or Trituration whatever, yet ſtill, when they are afterwards committed to boiling
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0490901800:51"/>Water, ſuch a degree of Heat and Motion makes no Alteration, and cannot break or divide them farther: but, after all, their ſmalleſt Parts, when examined by a Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope, will appear to be many thouſand times larger than any of the Orifices of the Lacteals, of which any Perſon may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be convinc'd upon tryal. And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, he who expects to paſs ſuch Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles thro' the Lacteals into the Blood, even after their utmoſt Trituration, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Maceration, in any Liquor which the Stomach can bear, will find himſelf deceived, and may as well attempt to thread a Needle with a Cable, or, to ſpeak accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Engliſh Tranſlation, <hi>It is as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible as for a Camel to go thro' the Eye of a Needle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. SUCH <hi>Metalline Subſtances,</hi> as above mentioned, may indeed be converted into the form of a <hi>Salt,</hi> by the Power of ſtrong <hi>Acids,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Oil of Vitriol, Spirit of Nitre,</hi> &amp;c. as is well known to the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts; and in this Caſe they become Soluble in Water, and may be volatiliz'd in it, to any aſſignable degree of Tenuity. But then
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0490901800:52"/>they are converted into <hi>Poyſons,</hi> and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be thought fit <hi>Alteratives,</hi> unleſs the intended Alteration be Death.</p>
               <p>I know that ſome of theſe <hi>Metalline A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid Salts,</hi> may be given in ſome Caſes, as <hi>Emeticks</hi> and <hi>Catharticks:</hi> bu tthen, as they are not intended to paſs into the Blood, but to be preſently thrown out of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy together with ſuch other morbid Matter as they derive from the remote Parts; ſo, in no caſe whatever, ſhould they be exhibited as <hi>Alteratives</hi> in a long continued Courſe of Medicine, nor indeed us'd for any other purpoſe, but with the greateſt Caution, and upon the utmoſt Neceſſity. They are edged Tools, and never to be meddled with without ſome Danger.</p>
               <p>IT is true indeed, that ſome Phyſicians have recommended even the alterative Power of Poyſons, when the firſt Paſſages are guarded againſt them, and they are ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conveyed into the Blood and remote Receſſes of the Body; but, upon what Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples this Practice is founded, I own, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my Comprehenſion. Would any but
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0490901800:53"/>a Madman, truſt an Enemy in his Houſe, or Cloſet, that he knows would murder him in the open Street? or is it conceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that, the much thinner, finer and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer Coats and Membranes of the remote Glands and ſmalleſt Veſſels, under ſuch Recluſes, ſhould be able to bear the Power of ſo vaſt a <hi>Stimulus,</hi> better than the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach it ſelf where there is ſo free and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen a Diſcharge?</p>
               <p>It is well known that <hi>Poyſoning</hi> has been made an Art of, and reckoned a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Part of Magick; and it has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of the <hi>Indians</hi> and ſome <hi>Italians,</hi> that they can give Poyſons to operate in a certain aſſignable time, either longer or ſhorter, without producing any preſent ill Conſequences when firſt exhibited. This method of Poyſoning indeed, might, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, receive vaſt Improvement from ſuch a Notion of Alteratives; but, as this does not belong to <hi>Phyſick,</hi> I ſhall leave the conſideration of it to others. And, ſince no Method has yet been diſcovered, of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning and directing the Venenous Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, when got into the Habit, to the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0490901800:54"/>Matter only, or of preventing their baneful Impreſſion, and deleterious Effects, on every part of the Animal Frame and Conſtitution; I ſhall not only abſolutely reject the internal Uſe of any ſuch ſort of Medicines, but draw one practical Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the whole which I take to be of great Importance; <hi>ſc.</hi> That any Medicine, endued with a ſtrong Emetick or Cathartick <hi>Stimulus,</hi> ſhould never be ſuffered to lie long in the Body, or to paſs the Lacteals where it is capable of it, but ought to be thrown off, as ſoon as poſſible, by the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Outlets and propereſt Excretorys; toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſuch other Matter as it has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived and prepared for Evacuation.</p>
               <p>BUT, beſides thoſe things that are abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely Indiſſoluble, and cannot be convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Blood at all, and ſuch as, by reaſon of their violent <hi>Stimulus</hi> and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive Qualities, ought not to be truſted there, there is another ſort of Medicines which might juſtly be expell'd the Province of Phyſick, under this notion of <hi>Specifick Alteratives,</hi> tho' they are not abſolutely Indigeſtible, nor endued with any hurtful
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0490901800:55"/>
                  <hi>Stimulus:</hi> What I here aim at, is the <hi>Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea, Reſins, Boles,</hi> and <hi>Earths,</hi> which will not impart a Tincture ſo as to be liquifyed and volatiliz'd with Water, or any other common potable Liquor.</p>
               <p>ANY of theſe, when retain'd in the Body, muſt neceſſarily clog and obſtruct the primary concoctive Organs, and do more Miſchief, in a little time, than all the Advantages that can be expected from them. For, as they cannot be ſufficiently reſolv'd, liquifyed and ſublimated, by the natural di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtive Heat of the Stomach, ſo as to paſs the Lacteals, they muſt needs foul and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the firſt Paſſages, impair the Appetite, ſuppreſs the natural Heat, weaken the Force of the Muſcles and Elaſtick Fibres in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and, by continuance, induce an <hi>Atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy</hi> of the worſt ſort, which ariſes from an Obſtruction of the Lacteals, and a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent depravation of Digeſtion and loſs of Appetite.</p>
               <p>BUT while I am exploding, and ſetting aſide theſe things as <hi>Alteratives,</hi> or with regard to any good Effects they can have
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0490901800:56"/>upon the remote Glands and Membranous Veſicles, I would not be thought to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, or ſuppoſe, that they may not, at leaſt ſome of them, be of uſe, in particular Caſes, by their preſent Effects on the firſt Paſſages; provided they are extruded and thrown out of the Body, by Emeticks or Catharticks, as ſoon as they have anſwered their proper Intention. But this will be farther explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſome of the following Sections.</p>
               <p>ANOTHER principal thing, to be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Practice of Phyſick, is the <hi>Doſes</hi> of Medicines, and the Manner of Exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. For 'tis certain, that where a Medicine is never ſo good and efficacious, and capable of anſwering the Intention of the Phyſician of it ſelf; yet ſtill this Effect may be eluded, and Nature deprived of the expected and intended Relief, by a wrong method of Exhibition, or by an Error com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, either in the <hi>Quantitys</hi> or <hi>Forms</hi> of ſuch Simple or Simples, on which the whole Intention of Cure depends.</p>
               <p>AND nothing, in my Opinion, has prov'd more prejudicial in the Practice of Phyſick,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0490901800:57"/>than the Stated <hi>Canonical Doſes</hi> of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, whether Simple or Compound. When once a Man imagines himſelf to be pinn'd down, in the giving of Medicines, to any ſtated Authoriz'd Doſes, he muſt not go beyond it, tho' he ſhould miſs of his Intention and loſe his Patient. And from hence one may venture to ſay, that more hurt has been done by trifling with Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Medicines, and thereby loſing Time, than by miſtaking the Caſe, and directing things contrary to the Intention of Cure.</p>
               <p>BUT this Error is oftneſt committed in the Caſe of <hi>Compounds,</hi> which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly look'd upon and regarded as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Canons</hi> in Phyſick; and conſequently entitled to an abſolute and implicit Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Conformity. But, as this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the prudential Orthodox Method of Trifling, and of doing a great deal of Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief by doing no Good, ſo I dare be bold to ſay, that he who ſhall govern himſelf by theſe Rules, without uſing his own Judgment in varying the <hi>Doſes</hi> and <hi>Forms,</hi> as occaſion requires, will not only often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times loſe his Patient, but his Reputation into the Bargain.</p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0490901800:58"/>
               <p>It is certain that the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in Medicine, upon which all our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Diſpenſatorys are founded, aroſe with the <hi>Specifick</hi> or <hi>Corpuſcularian Philoſophy,</hi> and with that it muſt ſink again; for, while the Practice ſtood upon this Chimaerical Foundation, the Phyſician, for want of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acquainted with the Obvious Senſible Qualities and Effects of Medicines, and the Method that unaſſiſted Nature took to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve her ſelf, under any particular Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, could have no other Intention in his Medical Proceſſes, than to cure by <hi>Magick</hi> or <hi>Occult Qualities;</hi> and conſequently muſt conclude that his chance of Succeſs, always roſe in proportion to the number of Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients in the <hi>Compound Remedy.</hi> But an Extemporaneous Practice is, certainly, the only true and rational Method of practiſing Phyſick; as this may, by the Phyſician who knows what he is about, be always accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to the great Variety and Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Symptoms in particular Caſes: and nothing ſurely can be more Abſurd and Irrational, than <hi>Extemporaneous General Preſcriptions,</hi> or <hi>Stated Canonical Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Remedys.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0490901800:59"/>
               <p>WHOEVER conſiders the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prevailing <hi>Compounds;</hi> will find them to be a general confuſed Jumble of Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of very different Virtues and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and, conſequently, not containing, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole, the real Power or Efficacy of any one Ingredient in the whole Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And if any ſuch General Artificial Compoſition ſhould happen to anſwer the Intention, in ſome particular Caſes, it is more by chance than any thing elſe. And, in theſe <hi>Canonical Compounds,</hi> it may be pretty generally obſerved, that the <hi>Simple</hi> that gives it the Name, or from which the Denomination is taken, has the leaſt ſhare in the Compoſition, and might do much better alone, or with any eaſy extempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Management.</p>
               <p>BUT beſides this Art of Compoſition, or confounding all Virtues and Properties together, there is another artificial Method of ſpoiling, or rendering Uſeleſs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant, the beſt and moſt Efficacious Simples, by pretending to preſerve and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their original native Effects and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0490901800:60"/>in their <hi>Diſtill'd Waters, Syrups, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> and <hi>Conſerves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Simple</hi> and <hi>Compound Waters</hi> drawn from Vegetables, are, for the moſt part, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ineffectual as to any Intention for which they are given; and he, who makes uſe of them for any other purpoſe than as Vehicles, for Medicines of greater Efficacy, will always find himſelf diſappointed; and, even for this purpoſe, the <hi>Simple</hi> or low <hi>Diſtilled Waters,</hi> not having Strength e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough generally to keep from Mothering and Spoiling upon hand, are not half ſo good as <hi>Common Water</hi> or freſh <hi>Small Beer.</hi> But the <hi>Compound Waters,</hi> which are raiſed to a proof Spirit, may, ſome of them at leaſt, do very well and be thought pleaſant enough as a <hi>Dram,</hi> tho', I think, moſt of 'em are fitter to be ſold at <hi>Inns</hi> and <hi>Coffee-houſes</hi> than the Apothecarys Shops.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Medicated Syrups</hi> are, if poſſible, ſtill more Inſignificant; for, excepting a few of them which are intended as <hi>Purgatives,</hi> there is not one of them capable of anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any other Intention in Phyſick: and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0490901800:61"/>ſince they are chiefly uſed in <hi>Juleps,</hi> as Specifick Sweetners by the Phyſician, and as <hi>Sugar</hi> it ſelf would do much better and render the Medicine more agreeable and leſs nauſeous, I think they may be very well left, to the Apothecary, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of particular Forms and to make up dry Subſtances into <hi>Boles, Pills</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuaries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Confections</hi> and <hi>Conſerves</hi> may likewiſe anſwer ſome ſuch uſe as to give an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Reliſh, or to bring <hi>Electuaries</hi> to a due Conſiſtence; but otherwiſe, their Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal Virtues may very well be ſpared.</p>
               <p>BUT, by <hi>Decoctions, Infuſions</hi> and <hi>Tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> the Native Eſſential <hi>Oils</hi> and <hi>Salts</hi> of Simples may be extracted, ſo far as the natural Heat of the Stomach is capable of doing it. And, ſince all the proper Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal Virtues and Powers of the Simples themſelves conſiſts and reſides in theſe <hi>Salts</hi> and <hi>Oils,</hi> by ſuch a Preparation and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement, they may certainly be given to vaſtly greater Advantage than in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Groſs Subſtances.</hi> For by this all the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0490901800:62"/>Efficacy of the Simples may be obtain'd freſh and pure, and to any given degree as the Caſe requires, ſo as to come up fully to the Intention. And hereby alſo the Stomach may be ſaved the Difficulty and Inconvenience of Solution, Digeſtion and Separation of the Parts; which is done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand in this way of Preparation, to the great aſſiſtance of Nature. For it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not certainly be a rational Method, or good Contrivance, to commit <hi>Groſs, Solid</hi> and <hi>Strongly-Cohering Subſtances,</hi> to a ſick, weak and diſtemper'd Stomach, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perhaps retain and digeſt any ordinary ſolid Food.</p>
               <p>AND, from the ſame <hi>Mechaniſm</hi> and <hi>Chemiſtry</hi> of Nature, it muſt likewiſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that all nauſeous, ſickening and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Medicines, ought as much as poſſible to be avoided; that is, they ought abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be avoided and never given or urg'd at all. For 'tis a hard Caſe, indeed, when a weak languid Patient muſt be forced, with Things which he could never have taken, in his beſt Health, without loathing Reluctancy and ſenſible Diſorder.</p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:0490901800:63"/>
               <p>THE Notion of <hi>Specificks,</hi> and the vain pretence of curing Diſeaſes by the <hi>Occult</hi> Operation of Medicines upon the Blood, has been the true ground of all ſuch Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence offered to Nature. For, if the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is to be cured by Things which are to affect the Blood, after a ſecret and inexpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Manner, the Patient muſt believe and ſuffer for the ſake of Health, againſt all ſenſible Appearances to the contrary: for, no doubt, the <hi>Specifick</hi> Remedys will do their Work, and faithfully execute their Commiſſion, when they get into the Blood and arrive at the Seat of the Diſorder, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Miſchief or Injury they may occaſion, to the Conſtitution, before they get there.</p>
               <p>I have made theſe Obſervations, which appear to me plainly neceſſary, with regard to the general Uſe and Application of the <hi>Materia Medica,</hi> for the ſake of ſuch Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, only, as ſhall think it worth their while to form their Conduct upon the Reaſon and Nature of Things, and build their Practice on Facts and Experiments. And, if ſuch Regulations ſhould happen to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0490901800:64"/>throw out a great part of its many Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, I hope, however, it may ſerve to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Healing,</hi> which is all I aim at.</p>

               <p>THE Doctrine of <hi>Stimulation</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification,</hi> or the Effects of Pain and Pleaſure, is of ſo vaſt an extent in Phyſick, and ſo eſſentail to all <hi>Animal Mechaniſm;</hi> that I thought it a matter of the utmoſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, to conſider this part of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria Medica,</hi> in a diſtinct Section by it ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pain,</hi> or Uneaſineſs, is the univerſal <hi>Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus,</hi> or Principle of Motion in all <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Mechaniſm.</hi> When it ariſes from the <hi>Body</hi> it has a material Cauſe, and tho' when it ariſes from the <hi>Mind,</hi> and has no other Cauſe, but the various Modifications of Good and Evil as they appear to the Judgment or Underſtanding; yet ſtill it
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0490901800:65"/>may be obſerv'd, that this mere Mental Pain, when impreſs'd on the <hi>Animal Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſm,</hi> will have juſt the ſame Effect on it, as if it had originally ariſen from ſome material <hi>Stimulus.</hi> And, in this Caſe, alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Judgment and thereby exciting Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, affects the <hi>Animal Conſtitution,</hi> much after the ſame manner, as a <hi>Vinous Spirit, Volatile Salt, Opium,</hi> or any other mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Pacifyer. And this Conſideration is of ſuch conſequence, that, without it, there can be no ſuch Thing as either the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or Application of <hi>Animal Mechaniſm</hi> to the purpoſe of my preſent Subject. But having obſerv'd this once for all, I ſhall confine my ſelf, in what remains, to the Conſideration of <hi>Material Stimulation</hi> and <hi>Pacification;</hi> where the Pain, or Pleaſure, Stimulation, or Pacification, ariſe from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out and may be aſcribed to ſome material Cauſe.</p>
               <p>'Tis well know that the active Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Bodies are their <hi>Salts</hi> and <hi>Oils;</hi> and that theſe variouſly affect the Animal Solids and Fluids, as they are <hi>Pungent</hi> and <hi>Vellicating,</hi> or <hi>Softening</hi> and <hi>Lubricating,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0490901800:66"/>Fix'd</hi> or <hi>Volatile, Heating</hi> and <hi>Rarefying,</hi> or <hi>Cooling</hi> and <hi>Condenſing.</hi> Nor are there any Operations of ſtimulating and quieting Medicines, but what may be underſtood and explained, by theſe their obvious ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Properties or Mechanical Effects.</p>
               <p>IT may be obſerv'd farther, that an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan may be ſtimulated, vellicated, or put to pain, either by an immoderate <hi>Diſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or <hi>Compreſſion:</hi> For, in either of theſe Caſes, the original Structure and Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Organ or Veſſel muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and broken, the natural Indication or Notification of which, in the Animal Conſtitution, is <hi>Pain.</hi> A <hi>Stimulus,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, may be either <hi>Hot</hi> or <hi>Cold; i. e.</hi> the ſtimulating Subſtance may either be a ſtrong, rigid, condenſative <hi>Salt,</hi> or a heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, rarifying or pungent <hi>Oil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN a cold condenſative <hi>Stimulus,</hi> the Afflux and Weight of the Fluids, towards the Organs or Veſſels ſtimulated, and the Evacuations depending thereon, will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed. And when any ſuch <hi>Stimulus</hi> is too ſtrong and powerful, the Afflux of the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0490901800:67"/>Fluids to the ſtimulated Parts, will overbear the contractile Reſtitutive Force of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids, in which Caſe the Parts muſt Swell, Mortify and Gangrene, or the <hi>Stimulus</hi> will act as a <hi>Poyſon,</hi> and the Perſon thus affected dies, under all the Pain and Torture of ſuch an Eroſion, in the full force and vigour of his Senſes, without any <hi>Stupor</hi> or Lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick Symptoms.</p>
               <p>BUT in a hot rarefactive <hi>Stimulus,</hi> the Symptoms will be very different, which I ſhall here briefly conſider and explain. For, tho' the ſwelling of the ſtimulated Part will always be, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the quantity of the Fluid flowing to the Part, yet in this Caſe of a hot rarefactive <hi>Stimulus,</hi> the Organ or Veſſel will be conſiderably more inflated and diſtended, by the Action of the heated rarefied Air included in the Fluid, and the circumjacent Veſſels neceſſarily Compreſs'd and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringed to a greater degree, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the influx of their Fluids will be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted or leſſen'd in proportion. Now the Effects of this Inflation or Diſtention, will be moſt remarkable and ſenſible, when it
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0490901800:68"/>happens in the Stomach, which is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal and original Seat of the Action of Medicines. And here the heating rarefy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Oil,</hi> acting upon this Organ, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flating or diſtending it more or leſs, may in its Effects prove either <hi>Sedative, Pacifying</hi> and <hi>Compoſing; Sickening, Surfeiting</hi> and <hi>Stimulating;</hi> or <hi>Stupifying, Lethargick</hi> and <hi>Mortal;</hi> according to the different degree of ſuch Inflation, and the different power of the Cauſe or Counterforce which it acts againſt.</p>
               <p>LET us ſuppoſe then the Pulſe lower'd, the natural Heat repelled, the Perſpiration check'd, the Tyde of the vital Fluid ſunk and depreſs'd, and conſequently the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes of the Stomach, Inteſtines and <hi>Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cera,</hi> tumifyed and relaxed from a Redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy and Surcharge of Fluids, occaſioned and brought on by Faſting. Watching, hard Labor, immoderate Purging and Vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the like Cauſe. And 'tis well know that, in ſuch Caſes, a moderate quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Wine, or any generous heating and rarifying Liquor abounding with a <hi>Vinous Spirit</hi> or <hi>Volatile Oil,</hi> will give a very great

If this warm <hi>Effluvium,</hi> and conſequent Inflation of the Stomach, be carryed ſomewhat farther, all the foregoing Effects of it will be increaſed; the Pulſe will riſe higher, the external Heat will be greater, and the augmented Perſpiration will break out into Sweats; which Sweats in ſuch a Caſe are vaſtly beneficial, as they deterge and purge the cutaneous Glands and excretory Ducts, which were before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by the Induration and Concretion of their contained Matter.</p>
               <p>BUT, if this Diſtention of the Stomach ſhall be ſtill increaſed, ſo as more ſtrongly to compreſs the deſcending <hi>Aorta</hi> and <hi>Viſcera</hi> contained in the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> and to throw a greater quantity of Blood upwards thro' the more patent Canals; this Increaſe, by compreſſing the <hi>Nerves</hi> in their Origin, will fix them, and induce Sleep, which will be more or leſs ſound, and of longer or ſhorter continuance, according to the different Power and Efficacy of the Cauſe. But when this Cauſe is raiſed to its higheſt
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0490901800:72"/>Degree, and acts with an overbearing Strength and Violence, it produces a <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy, Apoplexy</hi> and mortal <hi>Stupor,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which, the Perſon thus affected dies Senſeleſs and Convulſed, eſpecially in the lower Parts which derive their Blood from the deſcending Trunk of the <hi>Aorta;</hi> while the ſuperior Muſcles, which are overcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Blood, remain fix'd and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner motionleſs. But the direct contrary to all this happens, when a Perſon dies under the Power of any ſtimulating, <hi>acid</hi> or <hi>ſaline Poyſon.</hi> And from hence it may appear, that <hi>Alkaline</hi> and <hi>Acid</hi> Poyſons are a ſort of Antidotes, or Counter-Poyſons to each other: for as <hi>Vinous Spirits</hi> and <hi>Volatile Oils</hi> and <hi>Salts,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Opium,</hi> mitigate the Violence of corroſive <hi>Salts</hi> and <hi>Acids,</hi> ſo do theſe reſtrain and moderate the other. And from hence it is evident, that Life or Death, Killing or Curing depend on the different Uſe of the ſame things; and what is a neceſſary <hi>Antidote</hi> in one Caſe or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Exhibition, will under different Circumſtances act as a deadly <hi>Poyſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:0490901800:73"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Emeticks</hi> and <hi>Catharticks</hi> differ only in the degree of their Vellication or <hi>Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus.</hi> If their ſtimulating Power be ſuch, as to act immediately on the Stomach, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can paſs farther, they prove E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick and are thrown off by Vomiting. But, where the rigid ſtimulating <hi>Salts</hi> or <hi>Acids,</hi> are intimately united with a ſoft lubricating <hi>Oil,</hi> in the eſſential Texture and Conſtitution of the Medicine it ſelf, this qualifying <hi>Oil</hi> is not preſently ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the more ponderous fix'd <hi>Oil</hi> and pungent <hi>Salts;</hi> and conſequently, the Stimulation of the Medicine may not be ſenſible in the Stomach, nor its Action perceiv'd till it comes into the Inteſtines where it operates as a Purge.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Emeticks</hi> and <hi>Catharticks</hi> differ from each other, in the degree of their <hi>Stimulus,</hi> ſo they differ very conſiderably, among themſelves, according to their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Strength or ſtimulating Power; or as their ſtimulating <hi>Salts</hi> and ponderous <hi>Oils,</hi> are more or leſs tempered and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed with a ſoft Lymph and lubricating <hi>Nutritious Oil.</hi> But, of all Catharticks, the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0490901800:74"/>ſtrong purgative <hi>Reſins</hi> artificially drawn upon Spirit of Wine, are the moſt detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental and attended with the worſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences; as the repeated Uſe of them moſt ſenſibly impairs the Appetite, obſtructs the Lacteals, and fouls, clogs and weakens, the concoctive Organs and <hi>Viſcera</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. And this, I think, one may lay down as a certain Rule, that where Nature has prepared a Medicine, it can never be much mended by Art.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jalap</hi> in its natural ſtate, is, perhaps, one of the beſt general <hi>Purgatives</hi> in the World. For tho' it poſſeſſes a ſufficient ſtimulating Power, to anſwer the end of a Purge, even where ſtrong and quick Purging is requiſite; yet it abounds, at the ſame time, with <hi>Phlegm</hi> and <hi>Oil</hi> enough to correct and moderate its Operation, ſo as to render it ſafe as well as effectual: which good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties the artificial <hi>Reſin</hi> is deprived of; nor can any Art afterwards reſtore them again. If this <hi>Cathartick</hi> can be at all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd, it is by mixing and grinding the powdered Root with about a third part of <hi>Calomel,</hi> which makes it more attenuating,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0490901800:75"/>diſſolvent and deterſive, and, at the ſame time, leſſens its <hi>Stimulus</hi> and the adheſive Quality of its <hi>Reſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gutta Gamba</hi> makes a quick, ſafe and excellent Purge in Dropſies, or where-ever ſtrong Purging is required, when corrected with <hi>Mercury:</hi> and tho', in its natural State, it be too violent and ſtimulating in its O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, to be given to any but grown Perſons and thoſe of ſtrong and robuſt Conſtitutions; yet, under this management, I can affirm, from a conſtant courſe of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience for many Years, that it may be exhibited, with great ſafety, to the tendereſt Habits and moſt delicate Conſtitutions. And this indeed, in general, is the only method of correcting every thing poſſeſſed with a powerful <hi>Stimulus,</hi> or at leaſt, as far as I have yet found.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rhubarb</hi> is a very moderate Purgative, but a great <hi>Aſtringent</hi> and ſtrengthner of the Stomach and Bowels, when they are too lax and flaccid, and when given with about a third part of <hi>Engliſh Saffron,</hi> is an excellent and noble Diuretick, in all great
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0490901800:76"/>Relaxations of the Renal Glands and Uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Paſſages. But when 'tis made up into Pills with <hi>Quickſilver,</hi> firſt minutely divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and incorporated with any proper Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the <hi>Turpentine</hi> kind, its purgative Quality is greatly ſtrengthned and improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For, where the firſt Paſſages are foul, and ſtuffed with a load of Matter which wants to be evacuated, <hi>Rhubarb</hi> thus given, will work as much as <hi>Jalap</hi> given alone, or in its natural State; and this without any Pain or Sickneſs, or uneaſy <hi>Stimulus</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. And this, as I ſaid before, is the true Art of correcting, not only <hi>Emeticks</hi> and <hi>Catharticks,</hi> but all other Medicines which would, otherwiſe, act by a too pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful and overbearing <hi>Stimulus</hi> on the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and Inteſtines. For hereby the atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating, diſſolving and deobſtruent Powers of the Medicine are increaſed and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and, at the ſame time, the <hi>Stimulus</hi> and Vellication on the great Organs leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſame proportion. And, indeed, a Phyſician ought never to ſuffer a Medicine to act by any powerful or too violent a <hi>Stimulus,</hi> ſo as to occaſion exceſſive Pain; becauſe, in this Caſe, it comes near to a
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0490901800:77"/>
                  <hi>Poyſon,</hi> and threatens a Mortification or Gangrene of the Part thus ſtimulated. And whenever this happens, accidentally and beſide the Intention, the only effectual way to prevent farther Miſchief, and to quiet and pacify the Tumult raiſed in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, is immediately to give a ſufficient quantity of ſome powerful <hi>Volatile,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Opium,</hi> to take off the Pain and, thereby, to prevent the fatal Effects of ſuch a Stimulation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sudorificks</hi> act counter to <hi>Emeticks</hi> and <hi>Catharticks,</hi> and the Operations of theſe are, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> reciprocally proportional. Almoſt every body muſt have obſerved, that a <hi>Sweat</hi> raiſed ſtops a <hi>Diarrhoea;</hi> and that the checking of Sweat and Perſpiration, occaſions a <hi>Diarrhoea</hi> if the Inteſtines are not obſtructed too at the ſame time. The Reaſon and Mechaniſm of this is very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; for, as all Muſcular, Mechanical or Neceſſary, Motion is propagated from the Heart <hi>Undiquaque</hi> in the Direction of the Arterial Blood, 'tis plain that when the Flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ids move in a ſurplus Quantity from the Heart inwards towards the Stomach and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0490901800:78"/>and their Evacuation that way is increaſed by any Cauſe whatſoever, the Diſcharges, in the contrary direction, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the external Surface or cutaneous E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munctories, muſt be diminiſhed in the ſame proportion, and ſo <hi>vice verſa</hi> reciprocally. And hereupon is grounded the true ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Method of curing a <hi>Diarrhoea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sudorificks, Diureticks</hi> and <hi>Catharticks,</hi> and indeed all other Medicines univerſally, will operate differently according to the different Conſtitution in general, or the preſent occaſional State of the <hi>Animal Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy,</hi> with regard to the primary <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Qualities</hi> before mentioned. And here the different Powers of Heat and Cold, or of Rarefaction and Condenſation, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the different ſtate of the Solids and Fluids, or with the nature of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe as Effluent or Influent, muſt be the Phyſician's Guide. Every one knows that heating and cooling, rarefying and conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Medicines, will either promote or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain <hi>Perſpiration</hi> and <hi>Sweat,</hi> in their place and turns, or under different Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. No Man therefore, who knows
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0490901800:79"/>what he is about, would attempt to promote <hi>Sweat</hi> and <hi>Perſpiration</hi> by heating rarefy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Volatiles,</hi> where the cutaneous Diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges had been obſtructed and retained by a too great Efflux and diffuſion of Heat before; or endeavour to promote this Evacuation, by cooling refrigerating <hi>Salts</hi> and <hi>Acids,</hi> in a low, languid, and depreſs'd State of the Blood and Animal Fluids. And yet, as wrong and irrational as this evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be, any Perſon, who is but mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately acquainted with the Modern Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Phyſical Writers, eſpecially thoſe in the <hi>Specifick</hi> Way, muſt have obſerved, that very little regard has been had in Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, eſpecially in <hi>Fevers,</hi> to this plain, obvious, and indiſputable Principle. <hi>Sudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rificks</hi> and <hi>Diaphoreticks,</hi> therefore, ought to be of one Sort or the other, or the Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of each kind variouſly compounded, in extemporaneous Practice, from a careful and judicious Obſervation of the difference in the ſimple, or complicated, Symptoms. And this farther ſhews the vanity and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity of Stated <hi>Canonical Compounds,</hi> or <hi>General Recipes,</hi> under the infinite diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and various complications of Diſeaſes
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0490901800:80"/>and their Symptoms. But yet I muſt needs ſay, notwithſtanding the general Doctrine here laid down, that there is one Preparation of Nature, ſo nicely tempered and adjuſted with reſpect to Heating and Cooling, that, in this intention o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> promoting <hi>Perſpiration</hi> and <hi>Sweat,</hi> and thereby carrying off the foulneſſes and impurities of the Glands, by the cutaneous Emunctories, is almoſt univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally Beneficial: What I mean here is <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> which, at all Times, and almoſt in all Caſes, greatly promotes the <hi>Sudorifick</hi> and <hi>Diaphoretick</hi> Indications, whether the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Intention, and the Medicines with which it is join'd, be otherwiſe Heating or Cooling, Rarefying or Condenſing.</p>
               <p>BUT, where <hi>Perſpiration</hi> and <hi>Sweating</hi> are neceſſary, and the Intention cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe be obtained, which often happens in Fevers, nothing can come into competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with <hi>Bliſtering,</hi> which is not only a ſafe, but a ſure, Refuge on ſuch occaſions. And this is ſo effectual to the purpoſe here mentioned, that 'tis great pity it ſhould ever be made the laſt Reſort, after other Methods have been tryed in vain, and when,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0490901800:81"/>perhaps this may come too late; eſpecially ſince, in the modern Method of directing and governing it, the moſt dreaded and uſual miſchievous Conſequences of this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration are ſo eaſily prevented.</p>
               <p>To cloſe this Section, I ſhall only make one Obſervation more, as a Matter of great importance; and that is, that the <hi>Metalline Salts,</hi> or ſuch as are prepared by impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating and incorporating Metals, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Iron</hi> and <hi>Copper,</hi> with their proper diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving <hi>Menſtruums</hi> whether <hi>Acid</hi> or <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaline,</hi> are in many great Caſes the moſt effectual Remedies of all; as they may be directed to any of the natural Emunctories, by a skilful and judicious management, and become, then, the moſt certain and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Diſſolvents, Deobſtruents and Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents of any thing yet known. But a full Diſcuſſion of this cannot fall within the Bounds of a ſhort Eſſay, tho' ſomething farther will be obſerved upon it in the following Sections.</p>

               </head>
               <p>'TIS certain that ſome ſorts of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which are in themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſtible, and which can by no means paſs the Lacteals, or mix with the Blood, do yet moſt powerfully attract, imbibe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the morbid <hi>Salts, Acids,</hi> and <hi>Sulphurs</hi> or <hi>Inflammatory Oil</hi> which is often thrown on the firſt Paſſages, in Fevers and other Diſeaſes of the putrefactive kind. And, on this account, ſuch ſort of Medicines may be of great uſe in Phyſick, provided that ſufficient care be taken to extrude them out of the Body, as ſoon as they have done their work, and ſaturated themſelves with the morbid Matter. By this means the peccant Humour is diſcharged and caſt out, together with the Medicine that had attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and imbib'd it. But nothing ſurely can be more irrational and abſurd, than the giving ſuch Medicines under the notion of their Digeſtibility and alterative Effects in the Blood; as if the Stomach could work
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0490901800:83"/>Miracles and, by its natural Heat and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, diſſolve that which no Art can do by degrees of Heat and Motion vaſtly great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. And beſides, if ſuch Subſtances were ſuppoſed capable of being diſſolved and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quifyed in the Stomach, ſo as to be ſtrain'd off through the Lacteals and Lymphatick Recipients, yet ſtill, as in this Caſe they muſt neceſſarily carry the morbid <hi>Fomes</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with them, which they had before imbib'd and retained, and thereby corrupt and poyſon the whole Maſs; ſo conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Practice, in this view, would be rather more abſurd and irrational than before.</p>
               <p>IT may be here obſerved, that ſuch ſort of Subſtances are the beſt <hi>Abſorbents</hi> as are good for nothing elſe, and have no other remarkable Property whatſoever. Such as <hi>Chalk,</hi> dry <hi>Earths,</hi> powdered <hi>Shells,</hi> burnt <hi>Harts-horn,</hi> and the <hi>Mineral Glebes</hi> which have been firſt deprived of their <hi>Salts, Sulphurs</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> or ſtript of their active Qualities, by proper chemical Proceſſes, ſuch as <hi>Diaphoretick Antimony, Mineral Bezoar,</hi> &amp;c. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not therefore wholly condemn theſe things,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0490901800:84"/>as of no uſe at all in Phyſick, eſpecially the <hi>Minerals</hi> before mentioned, as ſome very conſiderable Phyſicians have done, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly that Prince of the Faculty the <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Learned Boerhaave,</hi> becauſe they could find them poſſeſſed of no active Qualities, and could eaſily prove them to be abſolutely indigeſtible, and indiſſoluble in the Stomach, by the cleareſt and moſt convincing Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments. For notwithſtanding their Paſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in other Reſpects, yet, 'tis certain, they ſtill retain the common Power of Attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And as they attract, abſorb, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Salts, Acids</hi> and <hi>Sulphurs,</hi> with the greater force and efficacy, for having been deprived and diveſted of them before; ſo, in this way of preparation of them, they may, I think, be deſervedly reckoned ſome of the moſt efficacious <hi>Abſorbents</hi> in the <hi>Materia Medica.</hi> But then, when the Uſe of ſuch indigeſtible Subſtances is too long continued, which it always muſt be when they are directed under the Notion of <hi>Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives;</hi> or, where they are too long retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Body, and due care is not taken to get rid of them, as ſoon as they have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered their Intention; they muſt neccſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0490901800:85"/>produce Effects very miſchievous to the Conſtitution, and ſuch as may, in ſome Caſes, be abſolutely Irretrievable. And herein Dr. <hi>Boerhaave</hi>'s Obſervations and Reaſonings, upon this Subject, are certainly right.</p>

               <p>IN all Caſes of <hi>Obſtructions,</hi> great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard is to be had to the Nature and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the obſtructing and retained Matter; as whether it be a cold, ſluggiſh, indurated <hi>Phlegm,</hi> or a heating, acrid, concreted <hi>Oil</hi>

And this Diſtinction is of ſuch Conſequence, that all true Practice depends upon it.</p>
               <p>IN all Obſtructions occaſioned by a cold, unactive, indurated <hi>Lymph</hi> or <hi>Phlegm,</hi> where the Complexion is pale, the Pulſe low, the natural digeſtive Heat impaired, and the Serum of the Blood very much abounding, in proportion to the Craſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; in ſuch Caſes, I ſay, <hi>Steel,</hi> join'd with the warm <hi>Bitters</hi> and <hi>Aromaticks,</hi> is a great and noble <hi>Deobſtruent.</hi> It raiſes the Pulſe, ſtrengthens the Digeſtion, diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the natural Heat, reſtores the elaſtick Tone of the Arteries, and, in a little time recovers the Craſſament of the Blood to a wonder, after it had been almoſt quite loſt and run into Water.</p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:0490901800:87"/>
               <p>BUT, on the other hand, when the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions are occaſioned by a hot, acrid, concreted <hi>Oil</hi> and <hi>Salt,</hi> tending to Eroſion and Ulceration, or where the natural Heat is exceſſive, and the Craſſament of the Blood is very predominant in proportion to the Serum. <hi>Steel,</hi> in this Caſe, can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be born at all, and will be ſure to do more Hurt than Good. For as <hi>Steel</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputably one of the warmeſt <hi>Deobſtruents</hi> in the <hi>Materia Medica,</hi> ſo, it is from thence evident, it can have no place as a Medicine here, and can only, then, be proper, when the Obſtruction proceeds from a contrary Cauſe, or, a cold, acid, <hi>Condenſative Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation;</hi> and, in this Caſe, it is <hi>inſtar om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium</hi> and has not its equal.</p>
               <p>BUT the great univerſal <hi>Deobſtruent,</hi> which may be accommodated to all Caſes and ſuited to all Conſtitutions, is <hi>Mercury</hi> or Quickſilver, which is deſervedly ſtil'd by <hi>Belloſte</hi> a <hi>Miracle of Nature,</hi> and <hi>the greateſt Gift of Providence in the whole Materia Medica.</hi> This noble and divine Medicament, being firſt well cleanſed and purifyed from its original <hi>Arſenical Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:0490901800:88"/>and all other <hi>Artificial Heterogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> Mixtures and Impurities, may be given, with the greateſt ſafety, to the youngeſt, tendereſt and moſt delicate Subjects: And, when under a skilful Management, may be directed to any of the natural Emunctories, ſo as to prove <hi>Sudorifick, Cathartick, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uretick, Expectorating</hi> or <hi>Salivatory,</hi> in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny degree, according to the Nature, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and Appearances of Diſeaſes, and their various Indications and Intentions of Cure: And this I can confidently affirm, from my own Experience, in repeated Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of it upon my Self and others, for a Courſe of many Years together. I confeſs indeed, that I have never yet obſerv'd any great or ſenſible Effects from it, beyond the firſt Paſſages, when taken by Ounces at a time, in the <hi>Vulgar</hi> Method and <hi>Quack</hi> way of Preſcription: And notwithſtanding the Facts publiſhed, in the Controverſy on this Subject, which ſeem to prove the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; yet, I am ſtill of Opinion that the Relief obtained, in thoſe Caſes, was purely accidental, and owing rather to the caſual Separation and Diviſion of ſome part of the <hi>Quickſilver</hi> into its <hi>Minutiſſima,</hi> in its
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0490901800:89"/>Paſſage thro' the Stomach and Inteſtines, from the long continued repetition of the Doſes, than to any natural or neceſſary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of it, by the digeſtive Heat and muſcular Action of thoſe <hi>Organs.</hi> But, however it be, thus much, I think, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that it does not ſo quickly, eaſily and ſurely paſs the <hi>Lacteals,</hi> in that way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting it, as when 'tis antecedently divided by Art, and intimately combined and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated with other Bodies: And, in this way of Management, I may venture to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, it will ſeldom or never diſappoint the judicious Phyſician's Intention, even in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of the moſt obſtinate <hi>Chronick</hi> kind, where any Relief is reaſonably to be hoped for or expected. But a particular Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of this Matter, would open one into too large a Field for a ſhort Eſſay, ſuch as I only intend this to be. And beſides, as I can give the World ſome Aſſurance of ſeeing this Subject more thoroughly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by an abler Pen, I ſhall chuſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to that Treatiſe which, I believe, will be ſoon publiſhed, and in which, I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, the Reader will find his Account.</p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:0490901800:90"/>
               <p>I ſhall therefore conclude this Section with one Remark more, by way of Caution to the <hi>Quickſilver Devourers,</hi> eſpecially ſuch of them as take vaſt quantities of it out of mere Whim and Wantonneſs, which is this; That tho' <hi>Quickſilver</hi> be in it ſelf, perhaps, the moſt innocent thing in Nature, and abſolutely incapable of hurting the moſt delicate Conſtitution, if taken pure and in moderate Quantities; yet, ſince it will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately mix and incorporate with other Metals, eſpecially <hi>Lead</hi> with which it is but too commonly adulterated, and which it will ſo ſtrongly attract and retain, as not to be ſeparated from it again by any ſort of <hi>Straining,</hi> or other manual Operation: I ſay, ſince this is the Caſe, it may be worth ſuch Perſons while to conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Quickſilver</hi> thus ſophiſticated, with a Metal endued with ſuch noxious Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, may not, in a long Courſe of taking it, become a <hi>Slow Poyſon,</hi> and do more future Miſchief to the Conſtitution, than can be ballanced by any preſent ſenſible Relief or Advantage whatſoever.</p>

               <p>FOR my own part, I freely acknowledge, I dare not give it, even in ſmall Quantities, for a long Time together, without being well aſſured of its Purity. And tho' a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Judgment may pretty well diſcover, upon view, from the degree of its <hi>Luſtre, Poliſh</hi> and <hi>Fluidity,</hi> whether it be greatly adulterated or not; yet, I am very ſure, from a great number of Experiments, that a ſufficient quantity of noxious Particles may be ſo intimately blended with, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by it, as not only to deceive the ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt Eye, and elude all other Methods of Tryal, ſhort of the <hi>Fiery One,</hi> but to do a great deal of Miſchief, in a long Courſe of taking it in ſurplus Quantities according to the common Way: for which Reaſon, I never preſcribe <hi>Quickſilver,</hi> but as <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viv'd</hi> from <hi>Cinnabar,</hi> or <hi>Rediſtilled,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Art, after it is got into the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary's Hands.</p>
               <p>I had here ſome Thoughts of conſidering the <hi>Materia Medica</hi> more particularly, in another Section, and of ranging and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the moſt approv'd and efficacious Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0490901800:92"/>in their moſt natural and proper Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. But I muſt poſtpone this, to another Opportunity, for the Reaſons already gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and the rather becauſe I intend, one Day or other, if I have Time and Leiſure to make the neceſſary Experiments, to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the World with a new <hi>Pharmacopoeia</hi> upon this Plan, in which I propoſe, accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, to re-examine the whole <hi>Materia Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dica,</hi> both <hi>Chemically</hi> and <hi>Mechanically,</hi> and to diſpoſe the moſt efficacious Simples in every Intention, in diſtinct Claſſes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their moſt Obvious <hi>Senſible Powers</hi> and <hi>Properties,</hi> with regard to the Primary <hi>Elementary Qualities</hi> and <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Evacuations:</hi> And to place them in ſuch a natural Order, according to their different Degrees of Power and Force in each Intention, that none but <hi>Empyricks,</hi> or ſuch as have little or no acquaintance with Philoſophy, and the Animal Structure and Oeconomy, ſhall be eaſily capable of erring in the Uſe and Application of them.</p>
               <p>IN this <hi>Examen,</hi> the Reader, I believe, foreſees that the <hi>Materia Medica,</hi> which, in its preſent State is enormouſly Bulky,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0490901800:93"/>will be greatly reduced and brought into a very narrow Compaſs. But, however, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I would give no Offence to any Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the Faculty, eſpecially the <hi>Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficians,</hi> who may poſſibly think themſelves Neglected, if not Injured, by this Method of treating the Subject; I farther intend, for their Uſe, and the Entertainment of others, tho' it will coſt me no ſmall Pains, to take due notice of the remaining <hi>Simples,</hi> which, for want of proper <hi>Criteria,</hi> cannot be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to a Place in the rational Part of this <hi>Pharmacopoeia;</hi> and which have no claim to any Regard or Eſteem at all, but on the Foot of <hi>Magick</hi> and <hi>Specificiſm.</hi> Theſe I ſhall place in oppoſite Columns, and in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct <hi>Claſſes</hi> likewiſe, according to their Traditional <hi>Occult Virtues</hi> and <hi>Qualities</hi> from the beſt Authorities. By this way of proceeding, the true State of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy between the <hi>Mechanical</hi> and <hi>Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick</hi> Gentlemen will at once be exhibited to View; and, if I am not much miſtaken, will appear in ſo ſtrong a Light, that a Man of no great Abilities may eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine on which Side the Weight of the Argument lies: And whether the <hi>Newto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0490901800:94"/>Philoſopher,</hi> who confines his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings to plain Facts and juſt Experiments, or the <hi>Corpuſcularian</hi> and <hi>Roſicrucian,</hi> who is led by his Imagination into all the Lengths of Whimſy and Enthuſiaſm, is like to prove the better and more uſeful Phyſician.</p>
               <p>UNDER this Article likewiſe, it will clearly appear, from the manifeſt Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Authorities produced in the courſe of the Evidence, that for one true Fact, upon Record, in the Hiſtory of <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cificiſm,</hi> you have ten Falſities; that the Argument, therefore, from <hi>Authority</hi> only, has as little Weight in <hi>Phyſick</hi> as in <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;</hi> and conſequently, that the <hi>Free-Thinker,</hi> in the one Profeſſion as well as in the other, has ten times a better chance of being in the Right, in all Caſes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, than the <hi>Free-Believer</hi> or <hi>Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſt.</hi>
