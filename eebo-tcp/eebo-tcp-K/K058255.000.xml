            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

But they aſſume an Authority, it ſeems, in Things foreign to their Profeſſion, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to decide in Matters whereof their Knowledge can by no Means qualify them to be competent Judges: And as this Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, if not prevented, may be of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Conſequence; he has undertaken to enquire into the Object, Principles and Method of Demonſtration, admitted by the Mathematicians of the preſent Age, with the ſame Freedom, he ſays, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to treat the Principles and Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Religion, to the end, that all Men may ſee what Right they have to lead or what Encouragement others have to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them.</p>
            <p>And whereas Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd to interpoſe in <hi>Prophecies</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations,</hi> and to decide in religious Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, it has been thought proper to begin with his Method of <hi>Fluxions,</hi> and to try what cou'd be done with that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, with the Inventor himſelf, and with his Followers: And what has been done with 'em every intelligent Reader is able to judge.</p>

If this Writer may be credited, the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects about which the Method of <hi>Fluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> is converſant, are difficult to conceive or imagine diſtinctly; the Notions are moſt abſtracted incomprehenſible Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſics, not to be admitted for the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of clear and accurate Science; the Principles are obſcure, repugnant, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious; the Arguments admitted in Proofs, are fallacious, indirect, illogical; and the Inferences and Concluſions not more juſt, than the Conceptions of the Principles are clear.</p>
            <p>How far the Credulous and Injudicious may become infected by this uncommon Way of treating Mathematics and Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians, is not eaſy to foreſee, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it will be neceſſary to give a ſhort Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Nature of <hi>Fluxions,</hi> and of the Objects about which the Method is converſant; and when it ſhall be made apparent, that this Author has not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Metaphyſics he wou'd refute; it will not be difficult to defend the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and their Demonſtrations, from any Imputations of Fallacy or Repugnancy,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0219000100:5"/>
which have yet been pointed at by him or any other Writer.</p>

               <q rend="inline">In the Method of <hi>Fluxions,</hi> Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> conſiders mathematical Quantities, not as compoſed of the ſmalleſt Parts, but as deſcribed or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated by continual Motion. Lines are deſcribed, and by being deſcribed are generated, not by an Appoſition of Parts, but by the Motion of Points; Surfaces by the Motion of Lines, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids by the Motion of Surfaces, Angles by the Rotation of their Sides, Times by a continual Flux, and ſo of the reſt. And by conſidering that Quantities, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing in equal Times, and generated by increaſing, become greater or leſs, according as the Velocity with which they increaſe, and are generated, is greater or leſs, he found a Method of deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the Quantities themſelves from the Velocities of the Motions, or of the Increments, with which they are generated; calling the Velocities of the Motions or of the Increments <hi>Fluxions,</hi> and the Quantities generated <hi>Fluents.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0219000100:6"/>
The momentaneous Increments or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements of flowing Quantities, he elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where calls by the Name of <hi>Moments,</hi> and conſiders the Increments as added or affirmative Moments, and the Decrements as ſubducted or negative ones: By Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we may underſtand the naſcent or evaneſcent Elements or Principles of finite Magnitudes, but not Particles of any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate Size, or Increments actually generated; for all ſuch are Quantities themſelves, generated of Moments.</p>
            <p>The Magnitudes of the momentaneous Increments or Decrements of Quantities are not regarded in the Method of Fluxions, but their firſt or laſt Proportions only; that is, the Proportions with which they begin or ceaſe to exiſt: Theſe are not their Proportions immediately before or after they begin or ceaſe to exiſt, but the Proportions with which they begin to exiſt, or with which they vaniſh. If the Lines AC and BE are ſuppoſed to be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated in the ſame Time, by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Points A and B, to C and E; and if by continuing the Motions of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0219000100:7"/>
thoſe Points to D and F, they generate DC and EF, ſynchronal Increments of AC and BE; <figure/>it is evident that the Points  D and F may flow back in the ſame Time to C and E, and by flowing back perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leſſen the Magnitudes of thoſe Increments till at laſt they vaniſh together, when the Points D and F come to coincide with C and E: Now the ultimate Ratio of thoſe Increments is that Ratio with which they vaniſh and become nothing; or the Ratio with which they ceaſe to be: And the firſt Ratio of them is the Ratio with which they begin to exiſt, at the very firſt ſetting out of the Points from C and E towards D and F.</p>
            <p>Hence, if the deſcribing Points move back to C and E, in the ſame Time wherein by moving forward they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated the Increments DC and EF; and in returning have every where the ſame Velocities, at certain Diſtances from C and E, which they had at thoſe Diſtances
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0219000100:8"/>
in going forward; the laſt and firſt Ratios of the Increments will be equal, or they will vaniſh, and become nothing, with the very ſame Ratio with which they began to exiſt.</p>
            <p>Hence likewiſe it appears, that to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the laſt Ratio of ſynchronal Incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Magnitudes of thoſe Incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements muſt be infinitely diminiſh'd. For their laſt Ratio is the Ratio with which they vaniſh or become nothing: But they cannot vaniſh or become nothing, by a conſtant Diminution, till they are infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diminiſh'd; for without an infinite Diminution they muſt have finite or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignable Magnitudes, and while they have finite or aſſignable Magnitudes they cannot vaniſh.</p>
            <p>The ultimate Ratios with which ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chronal Increments of Quantities vaniſh, are not the Ratios of finite Increments, but Limits which the Ratios of thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements attain, by having their Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes infinitely diminiſh'd: The Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Quantities which grow leſs and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0219000100:9"/>
leſs by Motion, and at laſt ceaſe to be, will continually change, and become dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in every ſucceſſive Diminution of the Quantities themſelves: And there are certain determinate Limits to which all ſuch Proportions perpetually tend, and approach nearer than by any aſſignable Difference, but never attain before the Quantities themſelves are infinitely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh'd; or till the inſtant they evaneſce and become nothing. Theſe Limits are the laſt Ratios with which ſuch Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities or their Increments vaniſh or ceaſe to exiſt; and they are the firſt Ratios with which Quantities or the Increments of Quantities, begin to ariſe or come into being.</p>
            <p>Quantities, and the Ratios of Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which conſtantly tend to an Equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by a Diminution of their Difference, and before the End of ſome finite Time approach nearer to an Equality than by any aſſignable Difference, at laſt become equal. For they become equal when the Difference between them vaniſhes or becomes nothing; and it will
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0219000100:10"/>
vaniſh or become nothing by being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely diminiſhed: If the Quantities AC and AD perpetually tend to an Equality, either by the Motion of the Point D to C, or by that of C to D; they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come equal, and their Ratio a Ratio of Equality, when their Difference CD, by a conſtant Diminution, vaniſhes and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes nothing, which it will do under a Coincidence of the two Points in C or D; and then either AD becomes AC, and ſo AD / AC or AC / AC is a Ratio of Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or elſe AC becomes AD and AD / AC becomes AD / AD; which is alſo a Ratio of Equality.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Fluxions of Quantities are very nearly as the Increments of their Fluents generated in the leaſt equal Particles of Time:</hi> If CD and EF be Increments of the Fluents AC and BE, deſcribed in the leaſt equal Particles of Time; the Fluxions in the Points C and E will be nearly as the Increments DC and EF. For from the exceeding Smallneſs of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0219000100:11"/>
Times it is evident that the Points D and F, muſt be extreamly near to C and E; and by Conſequence however the Velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities are accelerated or retarded thro' the Spaces CD and EF, they will be very nearly the ſame in D and F as they were in C and E: But Velocities which are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nearly uniform, will be very nearly proportional to the Spaces deſcribed by them in equal Times; and therefore the Velocities in the Points C and E, which are the Fluxions of AC and BE in thoſe Points, will be very nearly as the Incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments DC and EF, deſcribed in the leaſt equal Particles of Time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Fluxions of Quantities are accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately in the firſt or laſt Proportions of their naſcent or evaneſcent Increments:</hi> Thus the Fluxions of AC and BE, in the Points C and E, are in the firſt or laſt Ratio of the Increments CD and EF. For the firſt or laſt Ratio of the Incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments CD and EF, is the Ratio with which they begin or ceaſe to exiſt: But the Ratio with which they begin or ceaſe to exiſt, is the ſame with the Ratio of the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0219000100:12"/>
Velocities in C and E, which are the Fluxions in thoſe Points; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Fluxions in C and E are in the firſt or laſt Ratio of the Increments CD and EF.</p>
            <p>The Fluxions of Quantities are only the Velocities with which thoſe Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties begin to be generated or increaſed; or the Velocities with which the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating Quantities begin to ſet out; not the Velocities they have after moving thro' Spaces of any finite or aſſignable Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudes: And therefore if two mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Quantities ſet out together, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to move with Velocities which are as <hi>a</hi> and <hi>b,</hi> they muſt begin to deſcribe Spaces in the ſame Proportion with <hi>a</hi> and <hi>b</hi>; or the Proportion with which the Spaces begin to exiſt or to be deſcribed, muſt be the ſame with that which the Velocities have at the very Beginning of the Motion. For in the very Beginning of the Motion there is neither any Change of Velocity from Acceleration or Retar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, nor Difference of Time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0219000100:13"/>
Hence it appears that to obtain the Ratios of Fluxions, the correſponding ſynchronal or iſochronal Increments muſt be leſſened <hi>in infinitum.</hi> For the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudes of ſynchronal or iſochronal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements muſt be infinitely diminiſhed and become evaneſcent, in order to obtain their firſt or laſt Ratios, to which Ratios the Ratios of their correſponding Fluxions are equal.</p>
            <p>Hence likewiſe it appears that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of like Quantities, compared with each other, are in Ratios compounded of the Ratios of the generating Quantities, taken when firſt they begin to move, and of the Velocities with which they ſet out: Or in Ratios compounded of the Ratios of the generating Quantities when firſt they begin to move, and of the firſt Ratios of their ſynchronal naſcent Incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The Moments of Lines there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are as the generating Points and as the Velocities with which they begin to move taken together: The Moments of Surfaces, which become greater or leſs by carrying of moveable Lines along im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0219000100:14"/>
ones, are in Ratios compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Ratios of the moving Lines, and of their firſt Velocities, or firſt Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tios of the Increments which begin to riſe with thoſe Velocities: And the whole Motion by which Squares or Rectangles begin to alter, either from an Augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Diminution of their Sides, is the Sum of the naſcent Motions of thoſe Sides, or the Sum of the naſcent Incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ariſing with the firſt Motions of the Sides: For the Proportion of naſcent Increments is the ſame with that of the Motions with which they begin to be generated.</p>
            <p>From this ſhort Account of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Fluxions, compared with the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſt,</hi> it appears that the Author of that Paper is greatly miſtaken in the Object of 'em; and he is alſo miſtaken in the Principles: For he thinks the Moment or Fluxion of a Rectangle, contain'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der two indeterminate Quantities A and B, from whence are deduc'd Rules for obtaining the Moments or Fluxions of all other Products or Powers whatever, is
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0219000100:15"/>
no where truly determin'd by Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton:</hi> But he ought to have read Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi> with more Care and Attention than he ſeems to have done, before he ſet up to decide and dictate in Matters of this Nature; and he wou'd do well yet to read him with Attention.</p>
            <p>If any Rectangle CK be increaſed from an Augmentation of its Sides by Motion, ſo as that DK becomes LG in the ſame Time that DC becomes EG; the Moment of that Rectangle is the Sum of the Rectangles of DK into the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of DC, and of DC into the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of DK: That is, putting A and B for the Sides DK and DC, and <hi>a</hi> and <hi>b</hi> for their reſpective Moments, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Rectangle AB will be A<hi>b</hi> + B<hi>a.</hi>
            </p>

In determining the Moments of Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities, Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> expreſly tells us, that we are only to conſider: the Ratios with which they begin or ceaſe to exiſt; and to obtain thoſe Ratios, it is not neceſſary that the inſochronal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements ſhou'd have finite Magnitudes. <q rend="inline">Cave tamen intellexeris particulas finitas, <hi>ſays he,</hi> Particulae finitae non ſunt Momenta, ſed Quantitates ipſae ex Momentis genitae.

            <p>From theſe Paſſages it appears, that the Gnomon CGK in its naſcent or evaneſcent State only, or in the Inſtant it begins or ceaſes to exiſt, is the Moment or Fluxion of the Rectangle CK; and in a naſcent or evaneſcent State, when on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Increments of Quantities become their Moments, its Ratio to A<hi>b</hi> + B<hi>a,</hi> which is the Sum of the Rectangles LD and FC, is a Ratio of Equality. By di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing the Magnitudes of <hi>a</hi> and <hi>b,</hi> which are Increments of DK and DC, it is obvious that the Gnomon CGK di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhes faſter in Proportion, than the Sum of the Rectangles FC and DL does; and by diminiſhing faſter, it continually approaches to an Equality with that Sum, and attains the Equality only, when their Difference FH becomes evaneſcent, that is, when the Points F and H come to coincide with D; ſo that here is no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice or falſe Reaſoning uſed, to get rid of HF, or <hi>ab,</hi> that Term having no

            <p>After Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi> had ſo expreſly told us what he meant by Moments and Fluxions, and by naſcent or evaneſcent Quantities, one wou'd imagine it impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to have miſtaken and miſrepreſented him in the Manner this Author has done. He ſeems indeed to have been lead, or rather to have been deceived, by an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that there can be no firſt or laſt Ratios of mathematical Quantities or of their iſochronal Increments generated or deſtroy'd by Motion; imagining that no ſuch Quantities, by any Diviſion or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution whatever, can be exhauſted or reduc'd to nothing: But if Lines, Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces and Solids can be generated or aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by the Motion of Points, Lines, and Surfaces, they may likewiſe be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd or diminiſh'd by the Motion of the ſame Points, Lines and Surfaces, in returning to the Places from whence they firſt ſet out. While a generating Quantity moves back thro' the ſame

Space it before deſcribed in moving for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the Quantity generated, or its Augment, continually leſſens; and by perſevering in a State of decreaſing, it muſt in ſome finite Time vaniſh and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come nothing; and therefore mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Quantities, by a conſtant Diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may be reduc'd to nothing: And ſuch as are thus generated or deſtroy'd in equal Times by Motion, or which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe and vaniſh together, will ariſe or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh under certain Ratios, which are their firſt or laſt Ratios; or the Ratios with which they begin or ceaſe to be: But it may be neceſſary to perſue this Caſe a little farther, and ſee whether Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi>'s Demonſtration of it cannot be defended, and proved to be geometrical.</p>

            <p>Now, in determining the Moment of a Rectangle, there is nothing to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, when it firſt begins to be aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by the Motions of its Sides, but the Sides themſelves and the Velocities with which they begin to move; or the Sides and the firſt Ratio of the Spaces deſcribed by them.

the Rectangles A<hi>b</hi> and B<hi>a</hi>; for the Sides A and B begin to move with Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locities which are as <hi>b</hi> and <hi>a</hi>: But this Moment A<hi>b</hi> + B<hi>a,</hi> is manifeſtly equal to the Difference between the Rectangles <gap reason="math">

               </gap>; and therefore Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s determination of it is geometrical.</p>
            <p>From the foregoing Principle ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated, the general Rule for finding the Moment or Fluxion of any Power of a flowing Quantity, is eaſily deduc'd: It is eaſy, from hence, to infer that the Moment or Fluxion of A<hi>

            <p>Nothing is more plain and obvious, than that Quantities which begin to exiſt together under certain Proportions, and with certain Velocities; may become evaneſcent and ceaſe to exiſt, under the ſame Proportions and with the ſame Velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities; and this is all Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſuppoſes in that Determination of the Fluxion of <hi>x<hi rend="sup">n</hi>

               </hi> firſt begins to exiſt: For as they vaniſh toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther under a Ratio of Equality, ſo they begin to exiſt together under the ſame Ratio; and therefore in the naſcent or evaneſcent State of <hi>o,</hi> the Fluxions of <hi>x</hi> and <hi>x<hi rend="sup">n</hi>,</hi> are as <hi>o</hi> and <hi>nox<hi rend="sup">n</hi>−1</hi>, which are manifeſtly to each other as 1 and <hi>nx<hi rend="sup">n</hi>−1</hi>.</p>

            <p>The Author of the <hi>Analyſt</hi> therefore, is greatly miſtaken, in thinking Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi> found the Fluxion of <hi>x<hi rend="sup">n</hi>,</hi> by a Method different from that he uſed in finding the Fluxion of a Rectangle, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd under two flowing Quantities: He ſteadily adheres to one and the ſame Method; namely, that of taking the firſt or laſt Ratios of Quantities, or of their iſochronal Increments, for the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Ratios of their Fluxions; and uſes no illegitimate Artifice to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain theſe firſt or laſt Ratios; unleſs it be accounted illegitimate to ſuppoſe that mathematical Quantities can be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and deſtroyed by Motion.</p>
            <p>It is pretended, <q rend="inline">That the Method for finding the Fluxion of a Rectangle of two flowing Quantities, as it is ſet forth in the <hi>Treatiſe of Quadra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0219000100:33"/>
differs from that found in the <hi>ſecond Book of the Principles,</hi> and is in Effect the ſame with that uſed in the <hi>Calculus differentialis:</hi> For the ſuppoſing a Quantity infinitely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh'd and therefore rejecting it, is in Effect the rejecting an Infiniteſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal.</q> But if this Author deduces the Rule from the firſt Propoſition in the <hi>Treatiſe of Quadratures,</hi> and conſiders it ever ſo little, he will find it the very ſame with that ſet down in the <hi>ſecond Book of the Principles:</hi> And it is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in Effect too the ſame with that uſed in the <hi>differential Calculus,</hi> ſo far as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Methods <hi>can</hi> effect the ſame Thing, but no farther: For Quantities are not rejected in the Method of Fluxions, as in the <hi>differential Calculus,</hi> on Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their exceeding Smallneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">But according to the received Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples it is evident, ſays he, that no geometrical Quantity, by being infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely diminiſh'd can ever be exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or become nothing.</q> Now, on the received Principles of Fluxions, this is
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0219000100:34"/>
a direct Abſurdity. For theſe Principles ſuppoſe that mathematical Quantities can be generated by Motion, which he has not yet thought proper to contradict; and conſequently they may alſo by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be deſtroy'd: For Quantities, and the Augments of Quantities, which in ſome finite Time are produc'd by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may perpetually grow leſs and leſs by reverting that Motion; and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly growing leſs and leſs, they may come to be infinitely diminiſhed, or to be leſs than any aſſignable Quantities; and from being leſs than any aſſignable Quantities, the Motion ſtill perſevering, they muſt at laſt vaniſh and become no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; otherwiſe it might be contended that a Body ſetting out from any Place, and, in any finite Time, deſcribing a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain length, cou'd never by moving back and returning in the ſame Line, arrive at the Place from whence it firſt ſet out.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole then it appears, that the Method of Fluxions, as deſcrib'd by Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> in his Introduction to the <hi>Quadrature of Curves,</hi> and in the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0219000100:35"/>
               <hi>ſecond Book of his mathematical Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> is not that wretched un-ſcientifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Knack ſet forth in the <hi>Analyſt</hi>; but a Method founded upon obvious, rational, accurate and demonſtrative Principles: It likewiſe appears, that the Concluſions do not ariſe from illegitimate tentative Ways or Inductions, but follow from ſuch Premiſes, and by ſuch Arguments, as are moſt conformable to the Rules of Logic and right Reaſon: All the Skill and Dexterity therefore by this Author ſhewn, in the Inveſtigation of contrary Errors correcting each other, are vain and impertinent. He has miſtaken the Doctrine of Fluxions, and by not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinguiſhing its Principles from thoſe of the <hi>differential Calculus,</hi> has impoſed a falſe Meaſure of Moments upon his Readers, and arguing from that falſe Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, has unjuſtly charg'd Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi> with Errors ariſing from it; and, to mend the Matter, has inſtituted Computations to ſhew how thoſe Errors redreſs one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and how Mathematicians by Means of Errors bring forth Truth and Science.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0219000100:36"/>
The Diſpute between the Followers of Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton,</hi> and the Author of the <hi>Analyſt,</hi> is not about the Principles of the <hi>differential Calculus,</hi> but about thoſe of Fluxions; and it is whether theſe Principles in themſelves are clear or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, and whether the Inferences from them are juſt or unjuſt, true or falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientific or otherwiſe: We are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned about Infiniteſimals or minute Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, but about the Ratios with which mathematical Quantities begin or ceaſe to exiſt by Motion; and to conſider the firſt or laſt Proportions of Quantities does not imply that ſuch Quantities have any fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Magnitudes: They are not the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions of firſt or laſt Quantities, but Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of Ratios; which Limits, the Ratios of Quantities attain <hi>only</hi> by an infinite Diminution of their Magnitudes, by which infinite Diminution of their Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudes they become evaneſcent and ceaſe to exiſt. If therefore Quantities may ceaſe to exiſt by Motion, and if the Ratios with which they become evane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent be truly determin'd, it will follow that there are no Errors, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever 
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0219000100:37"/>
ſmall, admitted in the Principles of Fluxions; and if no Errors be admitted in the Principles; there can be none in the Concluſions, nor any to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for in the Arguments by which thoſe Concluſions are deduc'd from their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes: The Hints therefore, which this Author has condeſcended to give the Mathematicians for aſcertaining the Truth of their Concluſions, by means of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Errors deſtroying each other, will probably be left to be further extended and apply'd by himſelf, to all the <hi>good Purpoſes</hi> he pleaſes to extend and apply them; as having more Leiſure, and a Science more tranſcendental<note n="*" place="bottom">A <hi>Philoſophia prima,</hi> a certain tranſcendental Science ſuperior to and more extenſive than Mathematics, which, he ſays, it might behove our modern <hi>Analyſts</hi> rather to learn than deſpiſe.</note>, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a much greater Curioſity for ſuch Matters, than they have.</p>
            <p>It has been obſerv'd before, that Fluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may be expounded by any Lines which are proportional to them; and ſo the Analyſis may be inſtituted, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0219000100:38"/>
the mutual Relations or Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of finite Quantities, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions of Fluxions themſelves. To this it is objected, <q rend="inline">That if, in order to arrive at theſe finite Lines propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional to Fluxions, there be certain Steps made uſe of which are obſcure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable, it muſt be acknowleged, that the Proceeding is not clear, nor the Method ſcientific.</q> But there may be many Steps obſcure and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable to Perſons, who are unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi>'s Method of firſt and laſt Ratios, with his Doctrine of Fluxions, and with his Principles of Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and yet thoſe Steps may appear very different to others who have duly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd 'em: And therefore, till it be made apparent from geometrical Principles that the fluxional Triangle, which evaneſces upon the returning of the Ordinate of any Curve to the Place from whence it firſt ſet out, cannot in its laſt Form, that is, in the Form it has at the Inſtant it becomes evaneſcent, be ſimilar to a Triangle contain'd between the Tangent, the Abſciſs extended and the Ordinate of the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0219000100:39"/>
ſame Curve; or till it be proved that no Triangle, which is capable of becoming evaneſcent by a Diminution of its Sides from Motion, can be ſimilar in its laſt Form to any plain Triangle whatſoever; we ſhall continue to expound Fluxions by ſuch Right Lines as are proportional to them; and do aſſert, that the Proceeding is clear, and the Method ſcientific.</p>
