            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO His Honeſt Friend Mr. <hi>WILLIAM PATE,</hi> Of <hi>London,</hi> Woollen-Draper.</head>
            <p>I Know no occaſion wherein all ſorts of People have taken greater liberty, than in their Dedications, both in regard of the Perſons to whom the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement is made, and of the things that are uſually ſaid in them. All Authors pretend to diſclaim flattery upon theſe ſubjects, and yet were Hiſtorians to draw Great Men according as they are repreſented in Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, abundance of Perſons would paſs with Poſterity for men of wit, who never made a jeſt in their lives, and for honeſt Patriots, who were only mere <hi>Fripons</hi> at the bottom; but tho moſt Authors are agreed to wheedle and flatter in their Dedications, yet I ſee they are not ſo well agreed in the choice of their Patron; ſome have choſe whole Corporations, or Societies for this Office, and indeed this conduct would be politick enough, if the Parties, who are concerned in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication were obliged to eſpouſe the Author's quarrel; others have gone a ſtep further, and Dedicated their Books to the reſpective Countries where they live; and laſtly, ſome of a more Univerſal ſpirit, have offered them to the whole World in general, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions or limitations, as it conſiſts of the four known Parts, <hi>Europe, Aſia, Africk</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> and comprehends perſons of all ſorts and characters, thoſe that can read as well as thoſe that cannot, and thoſe that have a Religion as well as thoſe that have none
<pb facs="tcp:0148502701:3"/>
at all. But the generality of Writers decline this courſe of Dedication, becauſe Bodies Politick, and Countries, and the World it ſelf, as large as it is, ſeldom reward the Author, for, as we ſay, what is every mans buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is no mans buſineſs, and therefore they generally make choice of particular perſons, and thoſe for the greateſt part of the beſt Eſtates and Fortunes; not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe an Illuſtrious name gives any better protection to a Book than a Meaner would do, altho this is always pretended, but becauſe ſuch Perſons are beſt able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward an Author, and conſider him for his incenſe. As I never knew a bad Book ſell a farthing the better for having a gaudy Title prefixed to it, ſo a good one never fared the worſe becauſe it appeared without a fine <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>occo</hi>: For in ſhort, if the world has a mind to be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious, a Perſon of Quality's name is as feeble an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulet againſt the Criticks, as a Silver Horſeſhoe nail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a threſhold would be againſt Witchery and Poſſeſſion; for I am of opinion, that an Horſeſhoe made of Iron is full as powerful a preſervative as the other. Now I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap> two reaſons, Mr. <hi>Pate,</hi> to addreſs the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Tranſlation to your ſelf, the firſt is becauſe you are my Friend, with whoſe entertaining learned Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation I have been often diverted, and the next is, becauſe I can approach you without any of that Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ence, ſo he cannot aſſume that familiarity and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3+ letters">
                  <desc>•••…</desc>
               </gap>neſs, which makes all ſorts of Diſcourſes agreeable. However I would not have you think, that I am ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable as to deſire you to ſtand Surety, or (what in a few years will become a ſcandalous word with us God-father to my Tranſlation, becauſe I am ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble there are ſeveral faults in it, nor to ſtand up for the Author of this Epiſtle, for then you muſt reſolve to combat all comers and geers: All I require of you is
<pb facs="tcp:0148502701:4"/>
that if any of your acquaintance ſhould enquire either after the Book or the Tranſlator, you would only tell them that the Book gives a good account of a certain Prince's Court, who at this preſent writing is gazed at by all <hi>Europe,</hi> and that the Tranſlator is a very honeſt Fellow, who between a little <hi>French</hi> and leſs <hi>Latin</hi> makes a ſhift to get a ſorry Livelihood.</p>
            <p>I have been often reproached, and particularly by your ſelf for ſitting idle a whole year, and writing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of my own; now tho I muſt confeſs a certain party amongſt us has given us almoſt daily provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to encounter them, yet I find they are a generation that are never to be edified by Satyr, and indeed all wholſome advice is effectually loſt upon them. Suppoſe you or I ſhould tell honeſt Mr. <hi>Partridge</hi> yonder of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent-Garden,</hi> that it was not civilly done of him to leave the Thirtieth of <hi>January, Good-Friday,</hi> and the Twenty ninth of <hi>May</hi> all at a clap cut of his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manack, and that <hi>John Gadbury</hi> and he may now ſhake hands together, like a couple of Bigotted Raſcals as they are, perhaps another year, (as who knows how far a turbulent Reformer's zeal may carry him) he will leave us never an Apoſtle in the Calendar, to the utter confuſion of the poor People in the Country, who make no other uſe of the Apoſtles, but only to direct them to the next Horſe-race or Fair. To ſay the truth, we have too many ridiculous follies, and diviſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us ever to be cured by writing, which puts me in mind of what Mr. <hi>Burgeſs,</hi> who has made all the Town merry with his Preaching, ſaid lately upon this Argument: <hi>We</hi> Engliſhmen, crys he, <hi>have been fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in all ages for our Wars and Jars, and ſtrife and life, and ſo forth: Why, what do you think</hi> Virgil <hi>ſaid of you ſixteen hundred years ago? Even</hi> Penitus toto diviſes orbe Britannos, i. e. <hi>the</hi> Britains <hi>are the moſt divided people in the whole world.</hi> Thus you ſee, Mr. <hi>Pate,</hi> what little encouragement a
<pb facs="tcp:0148502701:5"/>
man has to write, ſince it is ſo unlikely that he ſhould ever cure any of thoſe diſtempers that are ſo in inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate in our Climate, but I have a more particular reaſon ſtill behind, which obliges me to ſit a ſpectator, and purely reſpects my ſelf; for as I have had the ill luck to diſpleaſe the Moderate Party by attacking the merits of the Comprehenſion in my Dialogue, ſo I have fallen under the indignation of the Criticks by being too profuſe and laviſh of my Similies. As for the firſt I have nothing to ſay to them, becauſe they are a ſort of Gentlemen, to whom I never deſigned to make my Court, and as for the laſt, before I go about to juſtifie my ſelf, I will tell you a ſhort Story. I happened ſome years ago to make a Viſit to an honeſt decayed old Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in <hi>Alſatia,</hi> and his Chamber was a perfect Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs: Pipes and Napkins, and ends of Candles, and old Cloaks were jumbled all together, but what was moſt remarkable a Loaf and a Cheeſe lay upon his Cloſe-ſteel. I asked him the reaſon of it, and the Captain honeſtly told me that he did it only for want of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. And this Mr. <hi>Pate</hi> was my own Caſe exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for there were ſeveral Perſons in the world for whom I had a kindneſs, and theſe for want of a better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience I was often ſorced to throw into a Simile, and to ſay the truth, ſome of them were ſuch ſad wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that they did not deſerve to have a Paragraph beſtowed upon them.</p>
            <p>But now to ſpeak a word or two in behalf of theſe Memoirs, I am in good hopes they will be favourable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="4+ letters">
                  <desc>••••…</desc>
               </gap>ved, becauſe they give us a true Idea of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Court, with which the generality of men amongſt us, are utterly unacquainted, and laſtly becauſe they p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>vide an agreeable entertainment to all ſorts of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: For here is Rain and Sun-ſhine, and Earthquakes and Shows, and Maſquerades, and Proceſſions, and the Lord knows how much Hiſtory in Sippits to divert the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3+ letters">

<pb facs="tcp:0148502701:6"/>
then for Perſons of better Palates here are abundance of Political reflections, and judicious obſervations, with the true reaſons how this vaſt Monarchy, which in the laſt Century made ſo conſiderable a figure in the world, is in this become ſo feeble and Paralytic. I will only take notice of one Inſtance among the reſt to give you a true taſte of this Author's Ingenuity. Don <hi>Juan,</hi> while the adminiſtration of affairs was lodged in his hands removed a poor Dominican from <hi>Salamanca</hi> (which place you know a certain Doctor who pretends he has received more ſtripes on his Back than St. <hi>Paul</hi> and all his Brethren did, has made remarkable in Story by the Chimerical Degree he took there) and made him the King's Confeſſor. He thought by this means to have ſecured the Monk for ever to his own Intereſts, and to have had a truſty Confident upon all occaſions near his Majeſty's Perſon: but he found himſelf mightily mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken in his expectation, for this Beaſt of a Religious, ſoon abandoned his Patron's party, and herded amongſt his profeſt Enemies. <hi>Some People,</hi> ſays this Author, <hi>pretend that he did it out of a Principle of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, but as for my ſelf I am of another opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: It is impoſſible that Ingratitude ſhould ever flow from any good Principle.</hi> I am ſorry that this honeſt Doctrine is not in better Reputation with ſome People amongſt us, for I am ſatisfied that no pretence whatever can atone for ſo black and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous a Sin as Ingratitude is.</p>
            <p>I ſhould here, according to the laudable Cuſtom of all Authors, take occaſion to ſay ſomething in your praiſe, but beſides that I will not offer that Violence to your Modeſty, I cannot handſomely commend you, for ſo great a variety of Learning in ſo much Youth, but at the expence of the City, and you know I have too great a reſpect for our Honourable Metropolis to do any thing of that nature, or indeed without a reproach to our ſelves, who cannot pretend ſuch excuſes, as the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb facs="tcp:0148502701:7"/>
diſtractions of Trade and Buſineſs. Indeed if your good fortune in the world prove anſwerable to your merits, you may for all I know dye a richer man than <hi>Greſham</hi> or <hi>Sutton</hi>: But I muſt tell you, my dear Friend, that good Fortune and Merit are two as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent things as any are in the world. I knew a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who made a pleaſant remark upon this occaſion. I have, ſaid he, in my time laid out for two things, <hi>viz.</hi> Preferment and a Red Noſe, with as much zeal and applicaiton as any man in Town. To attain the laſt I have dutifully drank my Gallon of Claret every night, and a dull ſober Sot, a Neighbour of mine, with his ſingle penurious Pint has arrived to it before me: and as for the former I have wearied out my Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in waiting at Court, and at Noblemens Levees, and yet could never ſtumble upon any; and ſo he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that ſeveral men come by Preferment and Red Noſes, who never deſerved either of them.</p>
            <p>After all, Mr. <hi>Pate,</hi> if my wiſhes will do you any good, I wiſh you ſtore of Cuſtomers, but never a Poet, or Courtier, or disbanded Captain, or Player amongſt them all. May I be ſo fortunate as to behold you advanced to the higheſt Pinacle of honour in the City, to furniſh new matter for <hi>Elkanah Settle</hi>'s Triumphs of <hi>London,</hi> to ſentence light Butter and Bread on Horſeback, to terrify Sabbath-breakers, and thoſe that forget to hang out their Lights, to appear in the next Edition of <hi>Baker</hi> or <hi>Stow,</hi> and arrive to the Priviledge of ſleeping in your Gold Chain at <hi>Guild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall</hi> Chappel. In ſhort, may you be the wealthieſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt man within the Bills of Mortality, and may you ever continue to love</p>

            <p>WE muſt not expect to find in a general Hiſtory thoſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Relations of things, that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually entertain the Reader bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the Hiſtory it ſelf: but when any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is once acquainted with them, he often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects upon them with a great deal of Pleaſure.

However I think it not amiſs to begin theſe Memoirs from the time of <hi>Philip</hi> the IV. in order to render the following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe more intelligible, and to give the Reader a better Idea of the Genius of the <hi>Spaniſh Court.</hi>

               <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> his Queen, being dead, he eſponſed <hi>Mary Ann</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> Daughter of the Emperor <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and Siſter of him that reigns at preſent. She was young, of a fair flaxen complexion, her humour was lively and pleaſant, and ſhe was no leſs agreeable than witty.</p>
            <p>She departed from <hi>Vienna,</hi> in order to go to <hi>Spain</hi> in the year 1649. She loved the Arch-Duke her Brother very affectionately, and as both of them were weeping when they took their leave of one another, ſhe demanded of him what lay in her power to do for his ſervice: My dear Siſter, ſays he, it lies in your power to have an Infanta there, which you may give to me in marriage. This acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent is ſo much the more obſervable, becauſe the Arch-Duke having at that time an Elder Brother, who died afterwards King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and being himſelf deſigned for the Eccleſiaſtic State, there was little probability that he ſhould ever arrive to the Empire, and marry, as it ſince fell out, the Eldeſt Daughter of the Queen his Siſter.</p>
            <p>Amongſt ſeveral other perſons, whom the Emperor gave the Queen his Daughter to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company her into <hi>Spain,</hi> he choſe Father <hi>John Evrard Nitard,</hi> a <hi>German</hi> Jeſuit, to be her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor. His extraction was mean and obſcure, and he employed almoſt all his thoughts in the advancing of his fortune. He was of a ſupple complaiſant temper, he exactly ſtudied the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective characters of thoſe perſons to whom he belonged, and took care never to differ much from them as to matters of opinion. He finiſhed his Studies in the Jeſuits College at <hi>Vienna,</hi> and there took upon him the Habit of his Order and afterwards was ſent to govern one of their
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0148502701:10"/>
Seminaries, in which Office he acquitted himſelf very well. When he came back again to <hi>Vienna,</hi> he began to make himſelf known in the world, and ſeveral Ladies of the Court deſired him to be their Spiritual Director: they omitted no opportunity to do him all the good offices they could with the Emperor; and in fine, ſpoke in ſuch advantageous Terms of him, that he was well enough contented to let the Queen take him along with her.</p>
            <p>This Princeſs was extreamly ſurprized at all the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cuſtoms, which thoſe who came to wait upon her from the King, cauſed her to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in the firſt Days of her Voyage. I have been told that as ſhe arrived to a certain City under the Dominion of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> where the principal Commodities of the place conſiſted in Frocks, Waſtcoats and Silk Stockings; they made her a preſent of a great quantity of them, of different Colours: But her <hi>Major Domo</hi> who religiouſly obſerved the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> gravity, deſpiſed the preſent, and ſo taking up a Bundle of Silk Stockings, threw them at the heads of the Deputies of the Town.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aveis de Saber,</hi> ſays he to them in a very fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Tone, <hi>que las Reynas de Eſpagna no teinen piernas,</hi> that is to ſay,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I would have ye to know that the Queens of</hi> Spain <hi>have no Legs</hi>; meaning, that they are ſo far ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated above others by vertue of their Rank, that they have no Feet to touch the Ground like the reſt of their Sex. However it was, the young Queen, who was not as yet acquainted with the Niceties of the Spaniſh Language, took it in the literal Senſe, and began to weep, <q rend="inline">ſaying that ſhe was fully determined to go back to <hi>Vienna,</hi> and if ſhe had known before her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from thence that they deſign'd to cut
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0148502701:11"/>
off her Legs, ſhe would rather have died, than ſtirred a Foot.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It was no difficult Matter to aſſure her of the contrary, and ſhe continued her Voyage.</p>
            <p>When ſhe came to <hi>Madrid</hi> they told the King of this innocent Simplicity of his Queen, he was ſo mightily pleaſed at the Story, that he vouchſafed to laugh a little at it, and this was the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary thing in the world for him to do, for whether it proceeded from affectation, or was the effect of his Conſtitution, it was obſerved of him that he never laugh'd above thrice in all his Life.</p>
            <p>The King ſhow'd a great reſpect for Father <hi>Nitard</hi> becauſe he was the Queen's Confeſſor, who repoſed an intire Confidence in him, but whatever deſires ſhe had to ſee him advanced, he left him peaceably in his poſt, without confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any other Dignities upon him, and he had unqueſtionably continued a long time in the ſame condition, if the King had not hapned to die.</p>
            <p>When that Prince found himſelf to be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly ill, and ſaw he could not bequeath the care of his Kingdoms to Cardinal <hi>Sandoval,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whoſe Management of Affairs he always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, becauſe he was at that time extremely ſick, and to ſay the truth, died but 20 hours after him; he made his Will, wherein he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that the Queen his Spouſe ſhould be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of the Kingdom, and Governeſs of the young Prince, who was then four years and an half old,<note n="a" place="bottom">Since the time of <hi>Don Loys de Haro.</hi> the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> have had no <hi>Privado</hi> or chief Miniſter: The Duke <hi>di Medina de las Torres</hi> had the Management of the Northern Adairs, and the Count <hi>de Caſtrillo</hi> of the reſt.</note> he named the Cardinal of <hi>Arragon,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Toledo</hi> and Inquiſitor General; the Count of <hi>Caſtrillo</hi> Preſident of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0148502701:12"/>
Count <hi>de Penarauda, Don Criſtoval Creſpi</hi> Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor of <hi>Arragon,</hi> and the Marquiſs <hi>d'Aytona</hi>; to the end that theſe ſix Miniſters ſhould aſſiſt the Queen in her Councils; and thus the King died in the month of <hi>September</hi> 1665.<note n="b" place="bottom">The ſix Miniſters that compoſed the Junta, were thoſe that were or ſhould be Archbiſhop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> Vice-Chancellor of <hi>Arragon,</hi> and Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor General. And beſides theſe a Grandee of <hi>Spain,</hi> and a Counſellor of State.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The Queen reſented the great Loſs ſhe ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with abundance of Sorrow, but ſhe had been ſtill more ſenſible of it, if ſhe had found her ſelf in the Condition of the other Queens of <hi>Spain,</hi> who are obliged to enter into a Convent, when they are Widows, unleſs the King orders the contrary before his Deceaſe; Nor was ſhe inſenſible of the Sweets of Governing. The firſt uſe ſhe made of her Authority, was in favour of Father <hi>Nitard:</hi> For <hi>Don Paſcal</hi> of <hi>Arragon</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been made Archbiſhop of <hi>Toledo</hi> and grand Inquiſitor, in the place of Cardinal <hi>Sandoval,</hi> the Queen ſent for him, and by her repeated impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities prevailed with him to quit the laſt of theſe two Dignities.<note n="c" place="bottom">The Cardinal of <hi>Arragon</hi> being Grand Inquiſitor, and afterwards named to the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Toledo,</hi> quitted the poſt of grand Inquiſitor, becauſe he could not have two places in the Junto.</note> He could not be brought to comply with this Requeſt without a great deal of trouble, for he almoſt choſe rather to be Inquiſitor General, than Archbiſhop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> although that Archbiſhoprick is worth 366 Thouſand Crowns <hi>per annum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he was not able to refuſe the Queen a thing ſhe ſo paſſionately deſired, who as ſoon as ſhe ſaw her ſelf in a capacity to diſpoſe of that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Charge, beſtow'd it upon her Conſeſſor.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0148502701:13"/>
As ſhe engaged her ſelf in this Affair of her own proper Inclination, without conſulting any thing elſe but the deſire ſhe had to ſee him made ſuperior to the other Miniſters, ſo ſhe took occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to diſcourſe of it to them, who immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly began to murmur amongſt themſelves.</p>
            <p>They read over the will of the late King, where they found it expreſly ordered that the Queen ſhould do nothing without conſulting their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and notwithſtanding all this precaution of the deceaſed, they ſaw with no little concern that ſhe had without ever communicating the matter to them, diſpoſed of one of the moſt conſiderable Offices in the Kingdom and that to a meer Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, who had been born and bred up in the <note n="d" place="bottom">Altho 'tis very true that he had been formerly a Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran and it was objected to him, yet he vehemently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

The deſire they had to preſerve their own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and the jealouſie which is natural for all Men to have of a Favourite, made them ſpeak very fiercely in the matter: However the Queen being informed of their diſcontent, took the true Meaſures to appeaſe them. The charming Manner of her Deportment, and particularly the obliging things ſhe ſpoke to them upon this occaſion, prevailed with them to lay aſide their Murmurs, ſo they agreed to diſpatch Letters of Naturalization for the Confeſſor, without which it was impoſſible for him to execute the Office the Queen had given him.</p>
            <p>Altho all thoſe difficulties that at firſt threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to hinder the Elevation of Father <hi>Nitard,</hi> were removed without any great Trouble, yet he did not fail to raiſe ſeveral ſecret Enemies upon
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0148502701:14"/>
himſelf, who envied his growing Fortune. They beheld with great Diſdain and Impatience the extraordinary Confidence that the Queen repoſed in him, for ſhe determined nothing without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing with him, and ſo great was his Credit, and Intereſt with her that he durſt offer to reſolve things of the greateſt Importance, without ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a word about them to the Queen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Juan</hi> was one of thoſe that was the moſt offended at the Advancement of Father <hi>Nitard:</hi> He was ſenſible that they would turn him out of all by little and little, upon this Score he gave way intirely to the Father Confeſſor, whom the Q. had made Counſellor of State; he then retired to <hi>Conſuegra</hi> the ordinary Reſidence of the Grand Prior of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> of the order of <hi>Malta,</hi> and ſaid very imperiouſly, <q rend="inline">that after he had ſeen him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Preſident of the Privy Council of the King his Father, he could never endure a Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that was ſo much his Inferior.</q> But the Queen who was wholly buſied in advancing her chief Miniſter, never diſquieted her ſelf with thinking what Reflections People might make upon him, ſo that without taking the leaſt notice of <hi>Don Juan</hi>'s diſcontent, ſhe ſuffered him to depart, and he continued a long time without viſiting the Court, until the Queen ſent him particular Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders at <hi>Aranjues,</hi> whither he was gone to divert himſelf, to come immediately for <hi>Madrid</hi> upon ſome important Affairs, which ſhe was willing to communicate to him.</p>
            <p>He was the natural Son of King <hi>Philip</hi> IV. and a certain Actreſs whoſe name was <hi>Maria Calderona.</hi> He was privately brought up at <hi>Ocana</hi> near <hi>Madrid,</hi> and of all the natural Sons that King had, he only acknowledged him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were becauſe he loved his Mother better than any of his other Miſtreſſes (and to ſay the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0148502701:15"/>
truth ſhe was the moſt charming perſon in the World) or becauſe Count <hi>d'Olivarez</hi> procured this good Fortune for him; for 'tis commonly given out that the Count had a Son named <hi>Don Julian de Guſman,</hi> whom he had a mind to own, and therefore uſed this Artifice of perſwading the King to begin with <hi>Don Juan,</hi> that ſo he might follow his Example.</p>
            <p>Whatever the matter was, <hi>Philip</hi> loved this young Prince very tenderly, altho ſome people ſuſpected he was the Son of the Duke of <hi>Medina,</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>Guſman,</hi> who had formerly been paſſionately in love with the young <hi>Calderona,</hi> and was in his time the moſt accompliſh'd handſom Cavalier in <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Don Juan</hi> very much reſembled him. But if ſome perſons were of this Opinion, others could never believe it, eſpecially when they conſidered the great kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and fatherly affection that the King had for him, and beſides reflected upon his extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good Qualities, which declared him to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be the Son of ſo great a Monarch. He was brave even to a Contempt of all Dangers whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, gallant and agreeable, well-ſhaped, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, liberal, and a perſon of great Honour; he had abundance of Wit, and was Maſter of a Genius that extended it ſelf to all Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. As there is ne're a Court in <hi>Europe</hi> where natural Sons are treated with ſuch advantageous Diſtinctions as they are in <hi>Spain,</hi> ſo this Prince could ſcarce perceive that the unhappineſs of his Birth did in the leaſt prejudice his Advancement; and tis indeed a certain truth, that we ſee in this Country, the legitimate Sons bred up with thoſe that are not ſo in the ſame father's houſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Diſtinction between one and the other. But this Cuſtom is not altogether obſerved with relation to the natural Sons of the Kings of <hi>Spain:</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0148502701:16"/>
For example, they never beſtow the title of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fante</hi> upon them, and <hi>Don Juan</hi> who paſſionately deſired to have it, uſed his utmoſt efforts to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh it, but had not the fortune to ſucceed in his deſigns.</p>
            <p>From the year 1643 the King had given him the Government of the <hi>Low Countries</hi>
               <note n="e" place="bottom">He held as his proper Right the Government of the <hi>Low Countries.</hi>
               </note> of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy</hi> and <hi>Charolois,</hi> and he always enjoyed it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the time when the Arch-duke <hi>Leopold</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Juan</hi> contributed very much towards the reducing the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Obedience: He took <hi>Piombino</hi> and <hi>Portolongone,</hi> and in all his Campaigns he perform d a World of Actions that equally teſtified his Bravery and Conduct.</p>
            <p>The King his Father having conceived no leſs an eſteem than Tenderneſs for him, Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him the moſt weighty Affairs of State, and choſe him to be chief of an Aſſembly of the chief Miniſters of his Kingdom.</p>
            <p>He was ſcarcely arrived at <hi>Madrid</hi> but a Council was held, where he came to be informed that the King of <hi>France</hi> was reſolved to eſpouſe the intereſts of his Queen, to whom <hi>Brabant</hi> and ſome other ſtates of the <hi>Low Countries</hi> eſcheated by right of Devolution, upon the Death of the Infant <hi>Don Balthazar</hi> her Brother; that his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty had publiſhed a Manifeſto wherein he proved the Juſtice of his claim, and that not thinking himſelf obliged to conſume any time in unprofitable Conteſtations, he had turned his Arms towards that ſide of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; that he had marched his Troops with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible diligence, and made conſiderable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0148502701:17"/>
as ſoon as ever he appeared. Upon a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious examination of the preſent ſtate of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, they were convinced that it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible at the ſame time to maintain War againſt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> and that it was neceſſary for them to lay hold of a certain conjuncture that made a very plauſible appearance; that <hi>Don Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> having by his extravagant conduct loſt the hearts of his People, was diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt of the Government, and his Subjects freed from the Allegiance they ow'd him; that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta <hi>Don Pedro</hi> his Brother had taken upon him the Adminiſtration of Affairs; that things of this conſiderable importance could neither be begun nor ended without ſome diſturbance, during which they muſt have occaſion for their own Troops, and therefore if it was judged expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent they ſhould lay hold of this opportunity to advance propoſals for a Peace.</p>
            <p>After every one had delivered his own opinion of the matter, the Queen came to this concluſion. A Letter was diſpatched to the Marquiſs <hi>de Liche,</hi> who was at that time Priſoner of War at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> wherein he had all neceſſary inſtructions given him. In fine, he managed the affair ſo dexterouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Regent <hi>Don Pedro</hi> liſtened favourably to the propoſals, and ſo a Treaty of Peace was concluded on the 13th of <hi>Jan.</hi> 1668.</p>
            <p>This News was entertained at <hi>Madrid</hi> with a great deal of ſatisfaction, becauſe the affairs of <hi>Flanders</hi> grew every day worſe and worſe, and it was neceſſary to take ſome ſpeedy meaſures to preſerve it, or elſe to abandon it for good and all. New Levies of Soldiers were ordered in <hi>Gallicia</hi> and elſewhere, and the Queen caſt her eyes upon <hi>Don Juan</hi> to ſend him thither to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Troops; for beſides that no Body was more capable of ſo great a Truſt than he was, ſhe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0148502701:18"/>
had obſerved that during the little ſtay he made at <hi>Madrid,</hi> his Averſion to F. <hi>Nitard</hi> daily increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and this reaſon alone was ſufficient to incline her to reſolve upon his Removal. She was not able to indure thoſe biting Reflections which <hi>Don Juan</hi> by way of Raillery very Liberally beſtowed upon the Father Confeſſor. One time among the reſt when the Miniſters demanded of him who was fit to ſend againſt the King of <hi>France.</hi> 
               <q rend="inline">I am clearly of Opinion, ſays he, that we had beſt ſend Father <hi>Nitard,</hi> he is a Saint to whom Heaven can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe nothing; the poſt wherein we behold him at preſent is an undeniable Proof of thoſe mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which he can command upon all occaſions.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Confeſſor anſwered, with a very Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly Air, <q rend="inline">That he was of a Profeſſion which taught him to hope every thing from the Divine Mercy, but that it did not belong to his Function to be a General of an Army. Oh my dear Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, replies <hi>Don Juan,</hi> and don't we ſee your Reverence every day Employed in things that are full as unſuitable to your Profeſſion?</q>
            </p>
            <p>As I ſaid before, it was reſolved to ſend the Prince with the New Supplies to <hi>Flanders,</hi> and a Recruit of nine hundred thouſand Crowns, with which they Furniſhed him out of the Silver that was brought in the Gallions.</p>
            <p>Neceſſary Orders were likewiſe diſpatched to <hi>Cales,</hi> and ſo the Admiral who had Charge given of this Sum, ſet Sail with eight Veſſels, from thence at the ſame time when <hi>Don Juan</hi> was Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching towards the <hi>Groyne,</hi> where the Rendezvous was appointed to be.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> Fleet Cruiſed upon the Coaſts of <hi>Gallicia,</hi> and was Compoſed of 36 Veſſels and 6 Fireſhips. <hi>Don Juan</hi> finding his Forces much Inferiour to the Enemy was not willing to hazard all in a Fight, where in all probability he could
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0148502701:19"/>
not avoid a total Defeat. Therefore he thought it more adviſed to ſend his Troops in ſmall Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to <hi>Flanders,</hi> where they arrived without any Danger.</p>
            <p>The formidable Power of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty not only alarm'd the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> who after a bloody War at Faſt concluded a Peace at <hi>Breda</hi> in 1667. and having ceaſt from all Acts of Hoſtility towards one another, entred into a League, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of 1668. to oblige the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of one of the two alternatives propoſed by the King of <hi>France,</hi> who ſtill perſiſted in his Offers.</p>
            <p>After their Example the Archbiſhop of <hi>Triers,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> the Elector <hi>Palatino,</hi> and Duke <hi>Erneſt Auguſtus</hi> of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Oſnabruck,</hi> concerted their Reſolutions for the common Safety, and made a League, whereby they obliged themſelves to endeavour the adjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the differences between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> or elſe to declare War againſt either of the two Crowns that ſhould refuſe their Mediation, and act againſt the Treaty. The Pope likewiſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the League, and a Peace was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at <hi>Aix la Chapelle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But theſe things were not ſo ſpeedily deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, but that other matters of conſequence happened at <hi>Madrid</hi> and other places. which ſtrangely perplexed thoſe perſons that were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted and concerned in them. <hi>Don Juan</hi> as was before mentioned, was at <hi>Corogne</hi> upon the point of imbarquing himſelf, when he received certain Informations of the Death of <hi>Joſeph Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lades</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Arragon</hi> whom he entirely loved. It was told him to his unexpreſſible A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement, that he had been ſecretly arreſted at <hi>Madrid</hi> about eleven a clock at Night; and that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0148502701:20"/>
by an order of the Queen written by her own hand, he was ſtrangled two hours after. The great care they took to keep this execution pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate only contributed to make it ſpread the faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and it was not doubted but that the Queen ſacrificed this unfortunate Gentleman to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of her Confeſſor.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Juan</hi> was extremely concerned at the Tragical Death of a perſon whom he loved ſo well, and yet more enraged at the injury which he imagined himſelf to have directly received from Father <hi>Nitard,</hi> reſolved not to go to <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi> 
               <q rend="inline">They would never have expoſed me to the puiſance of the moſt Chriſtian King, (ſays he to <hi>Don Diego de Valaſco,</hi> for whom he had an extraordinary Affection) but only with a deſign to compleat my Ruine. They will certainly take care to keep back thoſe Succours from time to time, of which I ſhall ſtand in need, and whatſoever good Conduct I may uſe in the Management of the War, there is no Queſtion to be made, but that they will make me anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for all the ill Succeſs we meet with. You ſee I am now at the Port, and yet they have executed a Man who was guilty of no other Crime than of wearing the Character of my Friend.

            </p>
            <p>He ſcarched the moſt plauſible Pretences he could think of, to-excuſe his going for <hi>Flanders.</hi> For ſome days he feigned himſelf to be indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and ſent word to the Queen that he was troubled with a Defluxion on his Breaſt, that the Phyſicians had made him apprehend the fatal Conſequences of it if he undertook ſo long a Voyage, and therefore he beſeeched her to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe

with him. An Alteration ſo little expected made a great Noiſe at Court, and gave no ſmall Mortification to her Majeſty and Father <hi>Nitard.</hi> They eaſily gueſſed at the Cauſe, and if they had imagined the Prince was no farther off, perhaps they had not Sentenced <hi>Malladas</hi> to die ſo ſoon. The Queen ordered <hi>Don Juan</hi> to reſign his employ to the Conſtable of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> who was to go to <hi>Flanders</hi> in his room, and alſo Commanded him to go immediately to <hi>Conſuegra,</hi> without Preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to come nearer than 20 Leagues of <hi>Madrid,</hi> which he accordingly Obey'd. But it ſeems this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience was not enough to ſatisfie the Queen's Indignation, who was ſo Exaſperated at him, that in <hi>August</hi> 1668. ſhe carried into the Council with her own Hands a Decree againſt the Prince; wherein ſhe repreſented to them <q rend="inline">the Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence he had ſhown at ſo preſſing a Juncture, and the Reaſons which ought to have Obliged him to ſet Sail, altho' the Indiſpoſition he pretended had been really True; that a Lye from a Subject to his Sovereign was always thought Worthy of the higheſt Puniſhments, and eſpecially un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch important Circumſtances.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Juan</hi> was informed of all that this Decree contained againſt him, and he was the more ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly concerned at this ill Uſage, ſince he had Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed ſo much upon Moderation, in not making a louder Complaint of the Death of <hi>Malladas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Man that ſerved altogether to eſtrange his Inclinations from the Queen, was a Captain, whoſe name was <hi>Don Petro de Pinilla,</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving asked leave to ſpeak with the Queen, threw himſelf at her Feet, and Entertained her an hour in Private without any Bodies know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he ſaid to her. It is not doubted by what happened afterwards but that he diſcovered ſomething of Importance againſt
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0148502701:22"/>
               <hi>Don Bernardo Pategno,</hi> Brother to <hi>Don Juan</hi>'s chief Secretary, becauſe he was ſeized the next Morning with 2 of his Servants. Theſe Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were kept ſo Secret that no one knew the Matters they contain'd. The Marquiſs <hi>de Salinas,</hi> Captain of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Guards, received Orders from the Queen to Poſt away with fifty of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Officers, and Arreſt the Prince at <hi>Conſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gra</hi>; but altho' he uſed the utmoſt diligence in this Affair, yet he was not able to find him. That, as it happened, did not prove Unlucky to him, for <hi>Don Juan</hi> had about him at that time a great number of his Friends and Domeſticks, who would all have hazarded their Lives to preſerve him from being taken; but by his great Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence he avoided the Expoſing any ſingle Man of them, for being Advertiſed of what had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed he withdrew in time, and only left a Letter behind him to the Queen, dated <hi>Octob.</hi> 21. wherein he ſpoke to her with greater Liberty than he had hitherto uſed. He there takes an occaſion to acquaint her, <q rend="inline">That he would have certainly gone for <hi>Flanders,</hi> if it had not been for the Surprizing and Tragical Death of his Friend <hi>Malladas</hi>; that he had all the reaſon in the World to believe that Father <hi>Nitard</hi> was the Inſtrument and Author of it; that ſo horrid an Injuſtice cried out aloud for Vengeance againſt the Man that had committed it; that he found himſelf poſſeſt with an earneſt Deſire to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute what lay in his Power towards the removal of ſo Wicked a Man; that he humbly Beſeeched her both for the good of the Kingdom in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as alſo for her Majeſties Glory to conſent to his Baniſhment; that he hop'd he ſhould never be conſtrained to have recourſe to any other Methods than thoſe of Prayer to chaſe him out of that place, where his Preſence was become
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0148502701:23"/>
odious to all the World; that he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf obliged to go and ſeek a Sanctuary againſt the Violences of this Stranger, and that this was a cruel neceſſity for a Perſon of his Quality; that he hoped her Majeſty would be pleaſed to make ſerious Reflections upon the whole, and apply neceſſary Remedies accordingly.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Reading of this Letter awakened all the Reſentment and Indignation that the Queen had naturally to <hi>Don Juan:</hi> She flew into the greateſt Paſſion imaginable, and had made it appear in a terrible manner, if the Grandees and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had not teſtified leſs Inclination for her. I was a new Subject of Diſpleaſure to the Queen and Father <hi>Nitard</hi> to ſee that all the World a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to ſet themſelves free from his Miniſtry, and that they had the hardineſs to tax him pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly with the murder of <hi>Malladas,</hi> and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment of <hi>Patigno.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This obliged the Queen to ſet forth a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, wherein ſhe aſſured the World that both thoſe perſons came to <hi>Madrid</hi> to execute the wicked Deſigns of <hi>Don Juan,</hi> that ſhe was fully inform'd of the whole by their own proper Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and that ſhe had never proceeded ſo far as to take away <hi>Malladas</hi>'s life if ſhe had not been aſſured of his Crime.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time Father <hi>Nitard</hi> printed and publiſhed a ſort of an Apology, in which he accuſes <hi>Don Juan</hi> with having frequently endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to aſſaſſinate him; he ſpoke of this deſign as a thing beyond Conteſt, and declared his own innocence with relation to the Death of <hi>Malladas,</hi> and the impriſonment of <hi>Patigno.</hi> He pretended to give an undeniable Proof of this Aſſertion, in alledging that when the former was ſtrangled, he was ſaying over his Breviary along with Frier <hi>Buſtos</hi>; and that when the ſecond was arreſted, he
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0148502701:24"/>
was ſetting his Papers in order in his Cabinet. Then he took occaſion to enlarge upon the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of his Birth, and upon the conſiderable Services which his Anceſtors had done for the Emperours. This Article only ſerved to ſet People on work to Examine the Obſcurity of his Family. He Addreſſed this writing to the Queen, and ſhe for her part forgot nothing that might make his Atteſtation be the better believed.</p>
            <p>Some time after ſhe preſented to the Council a ſecond Complaint againſt the Prince, charging him with having had his Nativity Calculated in <hi>Flanders</hi>; in which 'twas eaſie to diſcover the high and mighty expectations with which he fed his Ambition. That ſuch an inſufferable Curioſity had been always Puniſhed as a Crime of High Treaſon, that it was not only neceſſary to Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Fault, but alſo the Quality of the Perſon that committed it, that the debate was about a Man of Deſign, who could by no means pretend to Sin out of Ignorance; and an ungrateful rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Subject loaded with Favours and Rewards by the Crown; that it was abſolutely requiſite to Chaſtiſe him, for fear leſt a connivance ſhould Authorize his wicked Deſigns, and put him in a Capacity of accompliſhing them.</p>
            <p>The Prince had too many Friends, not to find ſome amongſt them who had the Courage to Defend him; there was ſcarce any thing to be ſeen in all manner of company but multitude of writings, the bitterneſs of which only ſerved to animate the intereſted Parties, and make them more Inveterate.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that appear'd in behalf of <hi>Don Juan,</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that he was Incapable of forming ſo mean and low a Deſign as that of Aſſaſſinating Father <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard</hi>; that if it had ever entred into his Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Execution of it could have been no difficult
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0148502701:25"/>
Matter; that the difference was only about a Stranger of an Eccleſiaſtic, without Friends or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, ſupported by a Queen who ought to have abandoned him to Vengeance, when ſhe was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of his wicked Conduct; that the beſt Proof one can bring to ſhew that the Prince had no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to do any ſuch thing was, becauſe it was not done; that far from endeavouring to take him off Privately, he had demanded in publick to have him removed from his Miniſtry, and that for attempting his removal, he expoſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to all the Indignation of the Queen: That at the bottom, Father <hi>Nitard</hi> would have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to complain of his ill Uſage, ſince he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to retire with the Puniſhment only of a Penſion of 60000 Crowns <hi>per annum,</hi> which he has hitherto enjoyed, beſides ſome other Private Benevolences that don't appear; that ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable a Revenue one would think might Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the Ambition of a ſimple Eccleſiaſtic; who was himſelf of ſo Vindicative a Nature, that he would fain have Aſſaſſinated the Prince at <hi>Barce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lona</hi> and <hi>Conſuegra</hi>; that it was not the Effect of any particular reſentment which made <hi>Don Juan</hi> Preſs the Queen ſo earneſtly to ſend him home to his own Country, being generous enough to forget any Private Injuries; but that he was too good a Subject to bear any longer with a Man, whoſe raſh and violent Counſels might ſome time or other prove the occaſion of a general Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Kingdom of <hi>Spain.</hi> To this they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſeveral other things, which I ſhall paſs over in ſilence.</p>
            <p>The Court and the City were divided upon this Point, every one engaging himſelf in the Affair, either as his own Sentiments led him, or as he was Influenced by the Reports of others. Nay the Court Ladies entred into the quarrel,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0148502701:26"/>
and for a Diſtinction of the Party they embraced, ſome were called <hi>Auſtrians,</hi> and others <hi>Nitardines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I have given you a Relation of what paſt at <hi>Madrid,</hi> during the time that <hi>Don Juan</hi> kept himſelf at a diſtance from it, and approached to <hi>Barcelona.</hi> The Queen was Ignorant what way he took, and her Diſquietudes doubled upon her, when ſhe conſidered with her ſelf what dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Effects an Affair of this Nature might carry along with it, eſpecially ſeeing it began with ſo much Heat. When he was Arrived there he writ a very reſpectful Letter to the Queen, but did not conceal the Reſolution he had taken, to Demand of her conſtantly the removal of her Confeſſor; he adviſed her to it with very forcible Reaſons, but they only provoked her the more againſt him, and ſhe could never ſuffer her ſelf to be perſwaded, that ſhe ought to deprive her ſelf of the Man in whom ſhe repoſed ſo intire a Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="5+ letters">
                  <desc>•••••…</desc>
               </gap>ce, and for whom ſhe preſerved ſo great an Affection. <q rend="inline">She found that <hi>Don Juan</hi> med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled with an Affair ſhe had no Inclination to, and that ſince the Council which the late King had Aſſigned her, could find nothing to except againſt the Father's Conduct, ſhe was not obliged to gratifie an Averſion, which the Prince had ſo unjuſtly entertained againſt him; that it would be for her Glory, to Teſtifie to the World the firmneſs of her Mind in this Rencounter; and that if ſhe Abandoned her Servants at the firſt Chimerical Objections that were raiſed againſt them, it would be a dangerous Matter for any one to ſerve her.</q> In fine, the extream deſire ſhe had to keep Father <hi>Nitard</hi> with her, furniſhed her with ſuch ſpecious Reaſons, that no Body durſt Combat them.</p>
            <p>The Father on his Part knew not where to turn himſelf, he was pleaſed without Queſtion to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0148502701:27"/>
ſee himſelf beloved and protected by ſo great a Queen, and to enjoy an abſolute Power next to her; but on the other hand, he was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſenſible Emotions when he conſidered what an Enemy he had to deal with: He was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of being poyſoned or aſſaſſinated, and tho the Council had not as yet ſpoken againſt him, yet he was not ignorant that he was but ill beloved by all the Miniſters. And that if ever it was his Fortune to be turned out, the greateſt Part of the Grandees would commend the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Conſtancy of <hi>Don Juan.</hi> Theſe Reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſo palled his Spirits, that he often went and threw himſelf at her Majeſty's feet, with Tears in his Eyes, humbly to beg the favour of her to ſuffer him to depart: but ſhe always aſſur'd him of the Continuance of her Protection, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad him any more to mention that thing, which gave her ſo much Pain and Uneaſineſs.</p>
            <p>The Prince did not content himſelf w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Queen, but writ alſo to the chief Miniſters, in ſuch vehement Terms, that they evidently ſaw what it was he deſired to do with the Father Confeſſor, and likewiſe that he would never depart from his Reſolutions. He pray'd them to ſecond him with her Majeſty, and to repreſent to her, of what a mighty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence it would be to the State, to ſend this Stranger home.</p>
            <p>Theſe Letters mightily augmented the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of F. <hi>Nitard,</hi> his friends were afraid that <hi>Don Juan</hi> would betake himſelf to violent Methods, and his Enemies had the Satisfaction to conſider that the Prince would employ his utmoſt Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts to turn him out of <hi>Spain.</hi> But thoſe that beheld the whole Scene calmly and without Paſſion, judged that the Queens Obſtinacy and the Opiniatrete of <hi>Don Juan,</hi> would neceſſarily
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0148502701:28"/>
involve the Kingdom in ſome great diſorders, where every thing would be equally confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Queen fell into the greateſt Paſſion imaginable, whenever the matter was mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to her, and finding her perſon to be no where elſe in Safety, ſhe order'd the Cavalry to come to <hi>Pardo,</hi> which is a Royal Palace within two Leagues of <hi>Madrid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis certain, that if ſhe had had leſs Fears up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her, ſhe had at that Moment declared <hi>Don Juan</hi> Rebel. She communicated this Deſign to her Father. Confeſſor, who approved of this way of procedure well enough, but others that were conſulted about it, oppoſed it with all their Might. They repreſented to her, <q rend="inline">That in caſe this was done, the Prince would no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger obſerve any Meaſures with her, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he waited for a favourable Pretence to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare himſelf; that he was brave in his own perſon, well beloved by his Friends, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides had the people on his ſide; that leſs cauſes have occaſioned great Revolutions; that there was nothing left but good Uſage and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that could make him return to his Duty, or at leaſt convince him that nothing had been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to inſpire him with a true Senſe of it.</q> Altho this Advice was extremely oppoſite to the Queens Reſentments, and by her good Will ſhe would never have treated with a Prince, by whom ſhe ſuppoſed her ſelf to be injured, yet ſhe was at laſt perſwaded to follow this good Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel. So ſhe wrote a very obliging Letter to him, wherein ſhe conjured him to return to <hi>Corſuegra,</hi> and ſhe engaged her Royal Word for the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his Perſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Juan</hi> made ſome Difficulty at firſt of obeying theſe Orders, whether it were, becauſe he was apprehenſive, as he told the Queen, of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0148502701:29"/>
putting himſelf into the Hands of Father <hi>Nitard,</hi> whom he had but lately eſcaped, or for ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſons that are unknown: But the Duke <hi>d'Oſſore,</hi> who was then at <hi>Barcelona,</hi> ſpoke to him with ſo much Zeal, and ſo vigorouſly Solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited him to obey her Majeſty's Orders, that he ſubmitted to his Reaſons, and ſo departed with three Companies of Horſe, which the Duke had given him for his Guard.</p>
            <p>The Queen having received Advice of it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to give him ſome Affronts upon the Road. She knew that he was to paſs through <hi>Arragon,</hi> and therefore ſhe writ to the States of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to ſhew <hi>Don Juan</hi> no manner of Reſpect, nay, even to ſeek out ſome opportunities to diſguſt him; but herein ſhe was ill obey'd. The States ſent her word back again, that they could not diſpence with themſelves from Paying to the Son of the late King, and the Brother of their preſent Monarch, thoſe Devoirs that were due to his Quality and Merits. To ſay the Truth, they acquitted themſelves herein with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Zeal; and when he approached <hi>Saragoſſa,</hi> all the Inhabitants went out above two Leagues to meet him on the way. The Preſs was ſo great that he had much ado to get through it, they cried all with one voice, <hi>Let the King live, and the Lord</hi> Don Juan<hi>, let him always have the better of his Enemies, ana Curſes light on the Jeſuit that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſecutes him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Every one ſcatter'd Flowers before him, ſuch as the Seaſon of the Year furniſhed them with, and ſprinkled him with perfumed Waters; the Ladies better apparell'd than they uſed to be on the moſt Solemn Days, made a double Lane for him with their Coaches; the Air was filled with nothing but the Benedictions and Praiſes they
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0148502701:30"/>
beſtow'd upon him: In a Word, the Joy was Univerſal in this great City.</p>
            <p>The Queen and Father Confeſſor, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a faithful Relation of the whole proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, were ſenſibly concerned, She to ſee the Contempt wherewith her Orders were Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, He to find himſelf ſo inveterately hated by the People.</p>
            <p>The Report of <hi>Don Juan</hi>'s extraordinary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception ſpread it ſelf as far as <hi>Madrid</hi>; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſeveral Perſons that receiv'd it with Joy and Satisfaction, there were many that Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended ſome Diſorder at the return of the Prince.</p>
            <p>In Order to prevent thoſe Evils that ſeemed to threaten them, the Regidors and other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates of that City Aſſembled on the firſt of <hi>February.</hi> They ſent four of their Body to the Preſident of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> to repreſent to him the great miſchief that might be occaſioned by <hi>Don Juan</hi>'s Arrival with his Troops, at a time when the Court was ſo weak, and the People ſo inſolent and diſpoſed for a Revolt; that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Prince was well Affectioned towards them, yet he would not be able to prevent the lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Effects they had reaſon to fear.</p>
            <p>The Preſident waited upon the Queen, and the Council immediately met, where it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to diſpatch a Courier to <hi>Don Juan,</hi> with her Majeſty's Orders to ſend back his Guards without delay.</p>
            <p>He received the Order, but haſtened his March, making the Courier follow him two days, on the third he gave him a Receipt for his Order, and ſent him back without any anſwer.</p>
            <p>In the mean time that he delay'd the Couriers coming back, they were alarm'd at Court with the ill ſucceſs of his Voyage, and their uneaſineſs
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0148502701:31"/>
was much increas'd in the Palace, when they ſaw him ſent back without any Letter. Some of the Lords went thereupon to find out the Preſident, to deſire him to tell the Queen, that they were ready to undertake any thing in the World for her Service. The Cavalry was drawn up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Preparations were making at <hi>Madrid,</hi> to ſuſtain a Siege, the event whereof appeared very doubtful, altho they had to deal with a Prince who was only attended by 300 Horſe.</p>
            <p>'Twas in effect this Guard that occaſioned the greateſt trouble; the Queen ordered the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>de Penalva</hi> to aſſemble the reformed Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers together, with thoſe that ſhould offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to go upon this occaſion, and tell the Prince, that her Majeſty ordered him to ſend back the three Troops of Horſe, he had brought along with him.</p>
            <p>The Marqueſs <hi>de Penalva</hi> was diſpoſed to obey, but he demanded an Order of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil Royal, and the Secretary of State refuſed to expedite it, alledging that the Queen could do nothing without the Council of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that ſhe had never conſulted them about this Affair. The Queen being provoked, ſent the Secretary word, <q rend="inline">That he ought ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to conſider what Difficulties he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſtart at ſo ill an Exigence, and how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle they were to the purpoſe.</q> The Cardinal <hi>Arragon,</hi> the Count <hi>de Penarauda,</hi> and the Vice-Chancellor came to wait upon her Majeſty; they repreſented to her, that the Secretary was in the right, and gave the Preſident of <hi>Caſtile</hi> a ſevere Reprimand for giving way by his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels to an Order that might have produced very evil Conſequences.</p>
            <p>They reſolved at laſt not to take up Arms; and to diſſipate the Apprehenſions the people
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0148502701:32"/>
were under at <hi>Madrid,</hi> 'twas publickly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed that <hi>Don Juan</hi> had ſent back his Guards, or that if he had not done it as yet, yet he would ſend them back at the firſt warning.</p>
            <p>The Queen having no hopes at all of ſeeing her ſelf obeyed by force, betook her ſelf to more gentle Methods, to try if ſhe could by that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct oblige <hi>Don Juan</hi> to ſend back his Soldiers: She writ to him by <hi>Don Diego de Velaſco,</hi> who was his great Confident, and the Letter was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry courteous and civil.</p>
            <p>The Prince, who came ſecretly to <hi>Madrid</hi> to diſcover the State of Affairs, the Diſpoſitions of his Friends, and what he might be able to effect there, very reſolutely ſent the Queen word again, that there lay no Obligation upon him to expoſe himſelf to the Revenge of Father <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard,</hi> therefore he poſitively demanded to have him turn'd out of the Kingdom; that after this were once done, none of all her Subjects ſhould pay a more dutiful Submiſſion to her Orders than himſelf.</p>
            <p>This was to demand a thing of the Queen, which ſhe had no manner of inclination to grant; The Nuncio <hi>Borromée,</hi> the Council of State, and the Grandees gave themſelves a great deal of trouble to no purpoſe to adjuſt the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. In the mean time the Prince appeared ſo firm in his Reſolution, that all the World judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it would be very happy for the Confeſſor, if he could eſcape with his Life. He himſelf was ſenſible enough of the Danger he was in, ſo he redoubled his Importunities with the Queen to ſuffer him to depart. She returned him no anſwer but by her Tears and Sighs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that he choſe rather to expoſe his own Life to the utmoſt Extremity, than diſoblige her by leaving her Service.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0148502701:33"/>
News arrived, that the Prince was come with his Troops to <hi>Torrejon-dardos,</hi> which is but four Leagues from <hi>Madrid.</hi> Thoſe that were of the Queens party were mightily diſquieted at it, and ſhe her ſelf was more afflicted than the reſt. They heard her ſeveral, times repeat theſe words, <hi>Oh Heavens! this good Father will be the first Sacrifice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Council of the Government met, and deſired the Nuncio to carry <hi>Don Juan</hi> the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Pope had written to him, wherein he conjured him to preſerve thoſe Sentiments of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and Submiſſion for the Queen, which a Subject ow'd his Soveraign.</p>
            <p>The Nuncio went to find him, and came back about midnight. No Body almoſt in this great City went to bed, but attended his Return with impatience, for they knew the occaſion of his Journey; and the people ran up and down the Streets in great Bodies, asking each other who they were for. The news the Nuncio brought back with him did not at all pleaſe the Queen, he told her that he had earneſtly requeſted the Prince to go to <hi>Guadalajara,</hi> or at leaſt to ſtay where he was a few days, that new meaſures might be taken to ſatisfie him, but that the Prince refuſed both the one and the other, and ſaid, that if on the <hi>Monday</hi> following the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor would not go out of the Gate, he would throw him out at the Window, and enter <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid</hi> on purpoſe to put it in execution. It was afterwards known, that this Negotiation paſſed after another manner, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Prince had agreed to let Father <hi>Nitard</hi> be with the Queen, provided ſhe would grant ſome advantages to him which he propoſed; but that the Nuncio, who had no kindneſs for that Father, was reſolved to break the Treaty all to pieces
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0148502701:34"/>
by concealing the favourable inclinations of <hi>Don Juan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Father <hi>Nitard</hi> was informed of all that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, he Confeſſed the Queen the next morning, and afterwards threw himſelf at her feet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching her not to expoſe him to the outrages which he might expect to ſuffer from an incenſed Prince, that his life was at ſtake, and that there was no other way to preſerve it, but by ſubmitting to the preſent neceſſity. The Queen anſwered him with abundance of Tears, that he ſhould not diſquiet himſelf at all, for ſhe would take care to ſet things to rights again.</p>
            <p>He was well enough ſatisfied of her own good will for him, but he queſtioned whether her power anſwered her inclinations; nevertheleſs he reſolved at laſt that he would be torn in pieces by the people, before he would leave <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid</hi> without her Order. So he tarried with her, having all the Apprehenſions upon him that a man, who every moment expects his death, can be capable of.</p>
            <p>Theſe affairs came to this upſhot at laſt, that on <hi>Monday</hi> the 25<hi>th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> the great Court of the Palace was filled with numbers of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of all conditions, who in a diſorderly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that was not eaſie to be ſuppreſſed, loudly demanded to have the Confeſſor diſcarded without any more Delay, <q rend="inline">That no body was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of what <hi>Don Juan</hi> had ſaid to the Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio; that the City would go near to be expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to Plunder and Deſolation for the ſake of a Jeſuit who was a Stranger, and had no other merit to recommend him but his pleaſing the Queen.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>d'Infantado</hi> and the Marqueſs <hi>de Liche</hi> ſeeing ſuch a vaſt Multitude aſſembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ran to the Queens Apartment, who

was then in Bed: She had not cloſed her Eyes all night long, and had not enjoy'd one Moment of Reſt, having it ſeems received ſome informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what had paſt. One of her Ladies, whoſe name was <hi>Donna Eugenia,</hi> was upon her Knees by her to comfort her in theſe Extremities. <hi>Alas,</hi> ſaid the Queen to her, <hi>what ſignifies my Grandeur, and theſe high Titles they give me, ſince I am not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Liberty to keep the good Man any longer with me, upon whom the Conſolation of my Life de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends?

            <p>The Council ſat immediately becauſe the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order ſtill increaſed in the City, and it was to be feared that it would augment more and more. Some of the Miniſters, who were in the Queens Intereſts, were for finding out ſome Expedient to hinder the Departure of Father <hi>Nitard</hi>; but others pretended there was no room left for an Accommodation, and ſaid that if the buſineſs was any longer delayed, all would be loſt: That <hi>Don Juan</hi> would ſoon enter <hi>Madrid,</hi> and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Without demurring any longer upon the matter, they reſolved to ſend <hi>Don Blaſco de Loyola</hi> to wait upon the Queen with a Decree, with which they entruſted him.

The Order was already drawn and the Queen diſcovered no Emotion in reading it: ſhe ſigned it with great Steadineſs of Mind, and without ſhedding one Tear; but being deſirous that her Confeſſors removal ſhould not ſeem to be extorted by Force, but that he made an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Retreat, ſhe procured an Order of Leave to be drawn up in theſe Words,</p>

                  <hi>Whereas F.</hi> John Everard Nitard<hi>, of the Society of</hi> Jeſus<hi>, my Confeſſor, Miniſter of State, and Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor General, has humbly intreated me to give him leave to withdraw himſelf out of theſe Kingdoms; altho I am fully ſatisfied not only of his integrity and his other good qualities, but alſo of the great Zeal and Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherewith he has always ſerved the Crown; yet nevertheleſs upon the account of his earnest Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as well as for divers other important reaſons, I have given him my Permiſſion to go where he pleaſes: And ſince I deſire that this may be done in a manner that is ſuitable to his Merits and Dignity, I have thought it expedient to give him his choice of going in the quality of Embaſſador Extraordinary either to</hi> Germany <hi>or</hi> Rome<hi>, with all the Emoluments and Advantages that belong to that Charge.

            </p>
            <p>As ſoon as <hi>Don Blaſco</hi> was gone, the Queen uſing no farther violence with her ſelf to keep in her Tears, ſhed them very plentifully, and caſting her ſelf upon the bed with all the grief imaginable cryed out inceſſantly, <hi>Alas! alas! to what purpoſe is it to be a Queen and Regent!</hi> On the other hand the Council commanded the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of <hi>Arragon,</hi> and the Count <hi>de Penarauda</hi> to go and acquaint Father <hi>Nitard</hi> with the order her Majeſty had ſigned. He who had long expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Tempeſt, ſeemed not to be ſurprized at the News, but was perſwaded by the Nuncio's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities not to go to Council as he had deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for he told him the people were ſo highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed againſt him, that he would infallibly run the riſque of being torn to pieces if he offer'd to ſhew himſelf.</p>
            <p>The Superiors of the Jeſuits were come to wait upon him to prepare him for this fatal Stroak. The Admiral of <hi>Caſtile</hi> came thither alſo, telling him with great Fierceneſs and the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0148502701:38"/>
freedom of Converſation, that ſo peculiarly diſtinguiſhes Perſons of Quality from others, that he had drawn all theſe Misfortunes upon himſelf by his own ill Meaſures, which he there particularly enumerated to him. The Father who had been never accuſtomed to theſe Repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, replyed that this Diſcourſe was not fit for an Inquiſitor General to hear before all the World.</p>
            <p>When the Cardinal of <hi>Arragon</hi> arrived, he found the Father extremely afflicted. The ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of parting immediately without ſo much as taking leave of the Queen his Miſtriſs touch'd him to the quick. The Cardinal was not able to refrain Tears at beholding it, whether from a Conſideration of the Incertainty of humane Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs that have no ſure Foundation, or elſe from the particular Eſteem he always had for him. He offer'd to furniſh him with a thouſand Piſtols for his Voyage, and the Count <hi>de Penarauda</hi> with Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Exchange for thirty thouſand Ducats, but he would not accept of them, ſaying, that as he came thither a poor Eccleſiaſtic, ſo he knew well enough how to depart from thence under the ſame Circumſtances.</p>
            <p>The Cardinal comforted him as well as he was able, and told him that he would accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny him to <hi>Fuencaral,</hi> then he withdrew to leave him at Liberty to ſet his own things in Order, and towards the Evening came to take him up in his Coach, which was well guarded: He asked him immediately whether all his things were ready, I have no other things, replies the Father, ſave only my Habit and Breviary, ſo they departed, being accompanied by all the Officers of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition. As ſoon as ever the people ſaw Father <hi>Nitard,</hi> they fell a crying and throwing Stones at him, and followed him with Curſes and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations:
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0148502701:39"/>
It happen'd well for him that he was in company with a perſon of the Cardinal's Dignity for otherwiſe he had been expoſed to the fury of the Rabble. The Grief that ſo rude a Treatment poſſeſs'd him with, obliged him ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times to ſay with Tears in his Eyes, that God had now tryed him by throwing him into this Furnace of Tribulations, and that he ſhould be very happy to be found good Alloy. As he paſſed through the Streets, he ſaid to the People who purſued him with contumelious Reproaches, Farewel my Children, farewel, I am going.</p>
            <p>He was not willing to accept of the Embaſſy to <hi>Rome,</hi> altho the Queen writ a very obliging Letter to him at <hi>Fuencaral,</hi> and reiterated the Offer to him. She ſent him two thouſand Piſtoles for his Voyage to <hi>Rome,</hi> ſome Precious Stones, and an Augmentation of two thouſand Crowns by way of Penſion. When he was gone, his Domeſticks found a Hair-cloth and ſome Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines in his Cabinet.</p>
            <p>When there was now no longer any Fear of diſpleaſing the Father Confeſſor by ſhewing reſpect to <hi>Don Juan,</hi> every one went to ſee him at <hi>Conſuegra,</hi> and teſtified their Zeal for him. He wrote to the Queen to thank her for ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away his inveterate Enemy, as well as that of the State, and prayed her to give him leave to come to Court, and kiſs the Kings hands. But inſtead of granting him that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, ſhe order'd him to retire a dozen Leagues from <hi>Madrid.</hi> He was ſenſibly touch'd at this unexpected Severity, and complained of it as of a ſort of Baniſhment. Nevertheleſs this did not hinder him from demanding by Letters, as well to the Queen as the Council, to take the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good into their Conſideration, and fill Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Nitard</hi>'s places with perſons that were capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0148502701:40"/>
of diſcharging them well: he repreſented to them, that thoſe Dignities ought to be taken from him, ſince it was equally as important a matter to hinder him from coming back again into the Kingdom, as it was neceſſary to make him leave it.</p>
            <p>He demanded alſo that they ſhould take away the Place of Preſident of <hi>Caſtile</hi> from the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Placentia,</hi> ſince he was the man that iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued out the Decree, by Virtue of which <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladas</hi> was ſtrangled; and that the Marqueſs <hi>d'Aytone,</hi> his capital Enemy, ſhould no longer have the Liberty of paſſing his Judgment in thoſe Affairs that concerned him.</p>
            <p>The Queen was very much offended at the manner wherein the Prince wrote to her, and yet more enraged at what had happened, ſent him a very unpallatable Meſſage, and order'd him forthwith to diſcharge his Guards, as he had engag'd to do.</p>
            <p>He complained of this to the Cardinal of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon</hi> and the Nuncio, giving them as well as the Queen to underſtand, that he could not part with his Friends that accompanied him, till ſuch time as he was certainly informed that Father <hi>Nitard</hi> was out of the Kingdom, becauſe he had ſtill reaſon to fear ſome Miſchief from that Quarter.</p>
            <p>Hereupon the Council met, and judged it convenient that the Cardinal ſhould go to <hi>Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalajara,</hi> to engage the Prince to comply with the Queens deſires; he conſented to it at laſt and diſmiſt his Guards, after the Cardinal had managed a ſort of a Treaty between that Princeſs and <hi>Don Juan,</hi> by which ſhe confirmed him in the Government of the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> and paſſed her word that the Father Confeſſor ſhould quit his places; that the Preſident of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0148502701:41"/>
               <hi>Caſtile</hi> and the Marqueſs <hi>d'Aytone</hi> ſhould not meddle with the Cognizance of thoſe things wherein the Prince was concerned; that as for himſelf, he might ſettle wherever he thought convenient; that they would take particular care to eaſe the People of their Grievances; that no body ſhould be admitted to any of the Military Orders of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> who had not ſerved ten years by Land or by Sea; that the Pope ſhould be the Depoſitory of the Queens word for the ſecurity of the Prince. There were many other Articles beſides theſe, but not of the ſame weight and conſideration, all tending either to the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Don Juan,</hi> or the eaſe of the People.</p>
            <p>He forbore making his uſual Remonſtrances till the Month of <hi>May,</hi> at which time he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved information that the Queen was ſetting on foot a Regiment of Guards for the Kings Service, whereof ſhe had made the Marques <hi>d'Aytone</hi> Collonel.</p>
            <p>He wrote very ſharply to her about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and repreſented to her, that it was againſt the Cuſtom of the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> to have any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Guards but the Inhabitants of <hi>Madrid,</hi> that this Regiment would be an everlaſting Reproach to the City, and would occaſion abundance of ill Effects, which he there enumerated at length. It is worth the obſerving, (and I could not forbear to take notice of it) that in this ſame Letter he complained, that the Queen did not anſwer him with her own Hand, but uſed that of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of <hi>Arragon,</hi> under pretence that ſhe was troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with a Megrim; telling her in plain down-right Terms, <hi>that a man of his Rank and Quality was not able to bear ſuch a Contempt.</hi> The World may learn from this remarkable Paſſage on what Grounds the natural Sons of the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> pretend to ſtand.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0148502701:42"/>
All the Courts of Judicature as well the Chief as the Subaltern, the Body of the City and the People made ſeveral Remonſtrances to the Queen, to hinder the ſetting up this Regiment in <hi>Madrid,</hi> but to no purpoſe. In fine they importuned her ſo often upon this Score, that ſhe ſigned an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by which ſhe prohibited them to ſpeak to her any more about it, and ſo without any more Delay ſhe compleated the Regiment.</p>
            <p>She afterwards commanded <hi>Don Juan,</hi> under very rigorous Penalties, to remove from <hi>Guada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lajara:</hi> He obeyed her Orders with a great deal of Reſpect, altho he was in a Condition, by the Help of his Friends, that were come to him from <hi>Arragon</hi> and other places, to do what he pleaſed; the Report ran, that he was coming within a little Diſtance of <hi>Madrid,</hi> and this gave ſeveral Perſons abundance of uneaſie Thoughts.</p>
            <p>To pacifie their Spirits, the Queen wrote to him and deſired him to repair to <hi>Arragon,</hi> in the Quality of Viceroy and Vicar-General of the Kingdom dependant upon it.</p>
            <p>This Order affected him with a very ſenſible Joy, and he took care to teſtifie it by the Thanks he returned the Queen, to whom he writ a very large Letter, deſiring her Majeſty to conſider ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly of the Education of the young King. In it he repreſented to her the great Conſequences of it, as being a Man, that was Maſter of a great deal of Wit and Honour. He wrote likewiſe to the Pope on the 7<hi>th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> to conjure him to oblige Father <hi>Nitard</hi> to quit his Offices.</p>
            <p>In the mean time ſome of the Queens Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſet about a ſham Decree, wherein ſhe gave Orders to the Council to diſarm the People im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, and return their Arms into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Hall. It was an eaſie matter to perſwade the World that this was her real Intention, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0148502701:43"/>
indeed this pretended Innovation ſo far eſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Peoples Hearts from her Majeſty, that they were juſt upon the point of making an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.</p>
            <p>This reaſon joyned with the horrible Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that were committed by the Regiment of the <hi>Scambergues</hi> (for ſo the People nick-named them becauſe they were clad <hi>a la Francoiſe,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> copied this Mode from M. <hi>de Schom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi>) this reaſon, I ſay, obliged the Council Ròy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to preſent another Remonſtrance to the Queen, wherein they deſired her to ſend theſe new Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to the Frontiers; but ſhe did not think fit to comply with their Requeſts, becauſe ſhe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined this Body of Military Men would keep the City in Awe and Subjection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Juan</hi> was now at <hi>Saragoſſa,</hi> beloved by the Nobility, and adored by the People: The Queen could never forgive him the irreparable Injury he did her, in forcing her to part with her Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, who made but a ſorry Figure at <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo that by way of Raillery it was frequently ſaid. <hi>That the Queen of</hi> Spain <hi>had ſo invincible an Averſion to the</hi> Spaniards<hi>, that ſhe would never conſent to the Ruine of Father</hi> Nitard<hi>, till he was naturalized a</hi> Spaniard.</p>
            <p>But however ſhe ſtill preſerved ſo great an Eſteem and Affection for him, that ſhe employed her utmoſt Endeavours to procure him a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals Cap. For this reaſon he gave ſecret Orders to the Màrqueſs <hi>de S. Romain,</hi> her Ambaſſador ordinary at <hi>Rome.</hi> This ſoon came to be known at <hi>Madrid,</hi> and the News alarm'd the People ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, every one apprehending that if ever the Father Confeſſor was made Cardinal, he would certainly by thoſe Steps come back to <hi>Spain,</hi> and they were all perſwaded that the Queen maintained the Regiment of the <hi>Schombergs</hi> for no other end, but only to favour this Deſign.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0148502701:44"/>
The Council being really afraid leſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue ſhould ſucceed, bethought themſelves of ſome means to defeat Father <hi>Nitard</hi> in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions, and for that purpoſe they diſpatched a Courier to the Marqueſs <hi>de S. Romain</hi> to propoſe to the Pope ſome other Subjects of <hi>Spain,</hi> who better deſerved the Purple. The Queen made as if ſhe conſented to the Buſineſs, but under hand renewed her Orders: But the Ambaſſador, who was no Friend at all to the Jeſuits, managed his Affairs ſo prudently, that his Holineſs reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Father <hi>Nitard,</hi> and beſides obliged him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign his other Places.</p>
            <p>The General of his Order, whom he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly neglected, and who for that reaſon owed him a great deal of ill will, thought he had now an opportunity in the reverſe of the Fathers, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to pay the debt, ſo he ſent him immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to one of their Houſes near <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He retired thither with a Spirit of Moderation that was very exemplary, and of all his Train he kept no one with him but Friar <hi>Buſtos</hi> his Companion: Behold here a continued Series of Thunder Claps one upon the Neck of another. This harſh Uſage appeared ſo terrible to the poor Queen, who did not in the leaſt queſtion the Succeſs of her Negotiation, that ſhe fell ſick of a Tertian Ague, which continued a long time upon her.</p>
            <p>'Tis eaſie to believe, by what I have already related, that her Reſentments became more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than ever againſt <hi>Don Juan:</hi> from her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Diſpoſition ſhe was inclined to make him reſponſible for every thing that gave her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Diſquiet, and when ſhe ſaw at the ſame time the Bulls for the Charge of Inquiſitor Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral arrived at <hi>Madrid,</hi> ſhe did not doubt but it was all of the Prince's doing. In fine that place
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0148502701:45"/>
whieh ſhe had ſeen ſo deſervedly filled by Father <hi>Nitard,</hi> was poſſeſs'd by <hi>Don Antonio Balladores,</hi> Preſident of <hi>Caſtile</hi>; and Father <hi>Nitard</hi> for his part continued ſtill near <hi>Rome,</hi> but ſubject to all the ill Treatment, with which the General of his Order thought fit to mortifie him.</p>
            <p>The Queen was not able to endure, that a Man who had formerly enjoyed ſo great a ſhare in her Friendſhip and Confidence, and who had governed the whole Monarchy of <hi>Spain</hi> ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely ſhould continue expoſed to all the Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Caprices of his General, therefore ſhe employed all the Credit ſhe had at <hi>Rome</hi> to place Father <hi>Nitard</hi> in another Condition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clement</hi> IX dying in the Month of <hi>December</hi> 1669. Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> was choſen Pope, and took upon him the name of <hi>Clement</hi> X. The Queen, who did not doubt but that this Pope would beſtow a Cap upon her Confeſſor, named the Father to be Embaſſador extraordinary of <hi>Spain</hi> at his Holineſs's Court, an Employment which ſhe had formerly offer'd him, when he departed from <hi>Madrid,</hi> and which he was not then willing to accept of; ſhe procured leave for him to return to <hi>Rome,</hi> and in fine, managed this Affair with his Holineſs ſo ſucceſsfully, that Father <hi>Nitard</hi> was created Archbiſhop of <hi>Edeſſa.</hi> She continued to ſolicit his Promotion with a great deal of Vigour and Application. The Pope being thus importuned, made him Cardinal <hi>Priest</hi> in the Month of <hi>April</hi> 1672, and gave him in the Month of <hi>August</hi> following, the Title of St. <hi>Bartholomew d'Iſola,</hi> and gave him a place in the four Congregations.</p>
            <p>This News filled the Queen with a very ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Joy, and all thoſe Perſons who were of her party did not fail to compliment her upon this Occaſion. The new Cardinal writ a very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliging
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0148502701:46"/>
Letter to <hi>Don Juan</hi> in hopes that this ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility would draw another from the Prince, and that finding by this Correſpondence a means to reconcile himſelf to him, he would at laſt conſent to his Return into <hi>Spain.</hi> But he was mightily miſtaken in his Project, for <hi>Don Juan</hi> ſent him no Anſwer back again. Cardinal <hi>Nitard</hi> ſeeing that the Prince ſtill continued his A verſion to him, laid aſide all Hopes of going to <hi>Madrid,</hi> till the time of the King's Coronation.</p>
            <p>But ſince what I have written concerning Cardinal <hi>Nitard,</hi> has inſenſibly led me to the time of <hi>Don Fernand de Valenzuela,</hi> I think my ſelf obliged to ſpeak of him.</p>
            <p>He was originally of the City <hi>de Ronda</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Granada,</hi> and was ſuppoſed to be an <hi>Hidalgo,</hi> that is to ſay a Gentleman, and not a <hi>Cavallero.</hi> For they make this Difference in <hi>Spain</hi> between a Cavalier and a Gentleman, that the former is deſcended of an ancient Family, or at leaſt allied to ſome illuſtrious Houſe, and pays neither Taxes nor Tribute, whereas the latter is exempt from nothing, tho he perhaps has ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the Quality of a Gentleman.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Valenzuela</hi> came very young to <hi>Madrid,</hi> where the Duke <hi>de l'Infantado</hi> took him for his Page when he went Ambaſſador to <hi>Rome.</hi> He was handſom and well-ſhaped, of an agreeable Meen, had a great deal of Wit, loved his Studies, and was naturally a Poet. The Character of his Verſe was tender and paſſionate, there are ſeveral pieces of his to be ſeen that are compoſed after Faſhion, and among the reſt ſome Comedies which he cauſed to be repreſented for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Queen-Mother, at the time when he firſt began to have the Honour of being in her good Graces.</p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>de l'Infantado</hi> being returned cut
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0148502701:47"/>
of <hi>Italy,</hi> made <hi>Don Fernand</hi> Knight of St. <hi>Jago.</hi> 'Tis by this means ordinarily that great Perſons begin to recompenſe thoſe of their Domeſticks, for whom they have the greateſt Conſideration. But he received nothing elſe but this bare Title for the many years Service he had waited upon his Maſter, becauſe it ſo happened that the Duke died, before he did any farther kindneſs for him.</p>
            <p>He found himſelf therefore all at a Blow deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of a Protector, and ſo miſerably poor that he was obliged to become <hi>Paſſeante en Corte,</hi> which is as much as to ſay, a man that lives by his Wits. To ſay the truth, he was Maſter of very happy Talents, which put him in a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to accompliſh every thing he undertook, ſo that after he had ſeriouſly examined with himſelf the meanneſs of his Fortune, he imagined the beſt Conduct he could uſe to advance it, was to make himſelf acquainted and known to ſome perſons, that were particularly devoted to the Intereſts of the Queen. He ſearch'd out means to effect this Deſign with ſo continued an Application, that at laſt he found acceſs to Father <hi>Nitard,</hi> he choſe him immediately for his Patron, and indeed could not have pitch'd upon a better; and ſoon inſinuated himſelf into his favour by his exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary Submiſſion and Diligence. The Father taking notice that he wanted neither Addreſs nor Wit, and beſides that he was capable of keeping a Secret, communicated to him ſome of his own, and afterwards entruſted him with thoſe of the Queen, acquainting him with the Reſentments ſhe had entertained againſt <hi>Don Juan</hi> of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> He knew very well what Advantages to make, both of the Diſcovery that was made him, and of the favourable Diſpoſition of the Father Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, and rendred himſelf ſo neceſſary to him
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0148502701:48"/>
that he could not almoſt be a Moment without him. This obliged himto give him Admiſſion into the Palace, whether he often came to give him an account of the ſeveral things he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted him with.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as ever <hi>Valenzuela</hi> was introduced into the Palace, he loſt no time there, but improved all his favourable Moments to the beſt Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; he plaid very well at Cards, and being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that amongſt the other Women that waited upon the Queen, there was a <hi>German</hi> Lady whoſe name was <hi>Donna Eugenia,</hi> in whom her Miſtreſs intirely confided, he preſently reſolved to uſe all means to ſee her: He walked often under her Chamber window, and being an handſom agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble young Fellow ſhe for her part failed not to take due Notice of him.</p>
            <p>In ſhort they ſpoke to one another, he pleaſed her at leaſt as well as ſhe pleaſed him, ſhe gave him leave to <hi>Galantear</hi> her, for that is the faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Word with them there, when any Perſon devotes himſelf to the Service of any of the Court-Ladies: And 'tis a thing ſo common among them, that altho a Man is married, yet he does not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to treat his Miſtreſs in publick with all thoſe Ceremonies, that are uſually paid to the Lady, whom they deſign to marry.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Donna Eugenia</hi> did not receive the Teſtimonies, that young <hi>Valenzuela</hi> gave her of his Paſſion with the leaſt coldneſs or indifference, and he purſued the point ſo vigorouſly, and preſs'd her ſo earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly to conſent to marry him, that ſhe diſcourſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Queen about it.</p>
            <p>Her Majeſty had already taken Notice of him, and he had the good Fortune not to diſpleaſe her, ſo that to tye him the faſter to her Intereſts ſhe conſented to let him marry her Favourite, and afterwards beſtowed a Gentleman Querry's place
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0148502701:49"/>
upon the new Bridegroom, About this time the Differences between the Queen and <hi>Don Juan</hi> daily increaſed, and as <hi>Don Fernand</hi> was a Man of Addreſs enough to ſound the Bottom of any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue, ſo he did not omit to do the Queen all the uſeful Services that lay in his Power. She beheld his Zeal with a great deal of Pleaſure, and took him ſo far into her Conſideration, that ſhe daily gave him ſome freſh Aſſurances of her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence.</p>
            <p>Father <hi>Nitard</hi> placed all this to his own Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and voluntarily contributed to <hi>Valenzuela</hi>'s Advancement, becauſe he looked upon him as his own Creature: But tho Fortune now began to deſert and leave him, yet ſhe abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared her ſelf in Favour of <hi>Valenzuela,</hi> about the time when <hi>Don Juan</hi> returned from <hi>Arragon</hi> to <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and cauſed the Father Confeſſor to be turned out of <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Valenzuela</hi> continued the Queen's ſole Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite without any Spy upon him, for the Prince returned back to <hi>Saragoſſa</hi> in Quality of Vicar-General of the Kingdom of <hi>Arragon.</hi> The Queen was ſo extremely perplexed and mortified by the Removal of Father <hi>Nitard,</hi> and her Enemies knew ſo well to make their Advantages of it, that it was ſome time before ſhe could tolerably reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver herſelf from the Impreſſion that ſo rude a Shock had made upon her, but having conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the neceſſity ſhe lay under to have a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Perſon near her, whom ſhe might entruſt with her moſt ſecret Affairs, ſhe caſt her Eyes upon <hi>Valenzuela,</hi> who for his part ſtill continued very much amaz'd at the Misfortunes of Father <hi>Nitard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One day the Queen ſpoke to <hi>Donna Eugenia</hi> to bring her Husband with her privately towards the Evening, becauſe ſhe had a mind to diſcourſe
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0148502701:50"/>
with him alone: <hi>Donna Eugenia,</hi> who wanted neither Wit nor Ambition, was tranſported with Joy to think that <hi>Valenzuela</hi> was going to have ſuch particular Converſations with the Queen, and exactly obeyed the Orders ſhe had received.</p>
            <p>The firſt time he entred into the Queen's Chamber, he was very cautious and fearful, for he came armed with a <hi>Broquel,</hi> which is a ſort of a Buckler, that they generally carry with them in <hi>Spain,</hi> when they go to a place where they apprehend any Danger: His Hair, that was very fine and delicate, he had tyed up in a Rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon knot, he had not his <hi>Golilia</hi> on, for 'tis the faſhion there to leave them off at night, in ſhort he forgot nothing that might render himſelf charming and agreeable to the Queen. She appeared in a <hi>deſhabille</hi> that ſat much better upon her, than the Widows Habit ſhe wore in the day time, which very much reſembles that of a religious Woman.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Velanzuela</hi> threw himſelf immediately at her feet, and after he had returned her his moſt humble Thanks for the great Honour ſhe was now pleaſed to do him, he aſſured her, that his Blood, his Life, in a word every thing that lay in his Power was ſo intirely reſigned to her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, that he had the Preſumption to believe none of all her Subjects was devoted to her Majeſty, after ſo particular a manner as himſelf. The Queen gave credit to his words, and after this meeting, ſcarce a night paſs'd over his Head, but ſhe cauſed him to come privately to her A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment</p>
            <p>His Wife always conducted him thither, and the Queen ordered her to be preſent all the while to take away all Suſpition and Umbrage. Hereit was that he gave her a particular Account of every thing he knew, and informed her of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0148502701:51"/>
all the moſt ſecret Intrigues that were carried on in Court or City, of the Deſigns of <hi>Don Juan,</hi> of thoſe Lords that were of the Prince's Faction, of the Meaſures that were taken againſt her, ſo that ſhe knew all the moſt private Affairs, altho to appearance ſhe ſpoke with no body. It was commonly ſaid at Court that there was a <hi>Duende</hi> in the Palace, that is to ſay a familiar Spirit, that acquainted the Queen with all the News, and and ſecret Deſigns: But ſome time after when it came to be publickly known, that <hi>Valenzuela</hi> was this <hi>Eſprit folet,</hi> this familiar Spirit, he was uſually called <hi>el Duende de la Reina.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Affection ſhe had for him encreaſed to ſuch a Degree, that all the World knew it, and the Courtiers all endeavoured to pleaſe the new Favourite: No Favours were to be obtained but through his Interceſſion, and the Credit of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Miniſters ſunk ſolow that they ſtood only for Ciphers, So they began to murmur amongſt themſelves. <hi>To what purpoſe was it,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>to remove Father</hi> Nitard <hi>and ſend him away, ſince a new Favourite is ſtarted up, that ſucceeds him in his Place, and acts with more Authority than the other ever did?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This good Fortune of <hi>Valenzuela</hi> occaſioned him a thouſand Enemies, they ſpoke of the Queen with all the Freedom and Liberty imaginable; both Grandees and People made no Scruple of ſaying in publick that a young ignorant Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite without Fortune or Merit governed all <hi>Spain,</hi> and that it was a Shame to endure it. The Queen being informed of what was ſaid, reſolved to advance <hi>Valenzuela</hi>'s fortune without delay, to the end that he might feel the good Effects of her Protection, before they were able to hurt him. Upon this Conſideration ſhe gave him the charge of Maſter of the Horſe, without having any
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0148502701:52"/>
regard to the Cuſtom, by which ſhe was obliged to concert it with her Miniſters, as is the way in <hi>Spain,</hi> when they are going to diſpoſe of any conſiderable Poſt, becauſe ſhe apprehended they would have oppoſed her Deſigns; ſo that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out entring into any matter of Conſultation (that is the uſual Term in <hi>Spain</hi>) ſhe ordered his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to be diſpatched.</p>
            <p>The Marqueſs <hi>de Caſtel-Rodrigo</hi> who was at that time Maſter of the Horſe, oppoſed it with all his Power, and peremptorily refuſed to give him Admiſſion into that Place, alledging abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of very diſobliging Reaſons againſt the Pretenſions of <hi>Don Fernand,</hi> and particularly that he had no Title to make him hope ſo great an Honour. The Queen removed that Difficulty very eaſily, for ſhe created him Marqueſs <hi>de San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bortolome de los Pinares.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the World obſerved ſo advantageous an Alteration in the Fortune of <hi>Valenzuela,</hi> no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy queſtioned but that he was a <hi>Valido,</hi> that is to ſay a Favourite. The Report immediately ſpread it ſelf through all <hi>Spain,</hi> attended with ſome Circumſtances that deeply concerned her Majeſty's Reputation, but ſhe made no Account of them; whether it were, becauſe ſhe thought thoſe Perſons not worth her Conſideration that had the Boldneſs to talk ſo freely of her, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe had ſome particular Reaſons to herſelf not to alter this Conduct.</p>
            <p>Some time after, the Marqueſs <hi>de Caſtel-Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drigo,</hi> Maſter of the Horſe, happened to die, and the Queen beſtow'd his Charge upon <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenzuela:</hi> if the Grandees formerly murmured when he was advanced to a leſs conſiderable Poſt, 'tis an eaſie matter to imagine the Exceſs of their Diſſatisfaction and Jealouſie, when they beheld him ſettled in a place, which all of them
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0148502701:53"/>
could have wiſhed to have enjoyed, and of which they believed themſelves to be infinitely more deſerving: But they ceaſed to make any farther Clamours about this Buſineſs, when they found they had a Subject to talk of that was a great deal more ſurprizing. Her Majeſty made <hi>Valenzuela</hi> a Grandee of <hi>Spain</hi> of the firſt Claſs, with a double gold Key. At this piece of news all people looked upon one another, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued mute for ſome time, not being able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Aſtoniſhment they were in. The Lords as they met one another ſaid nothing elſe but, <hi>Valenzuela made a Grandee, O tempora, O mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res:</hi> In fine the Queen declared him her ſole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite, ſo that he iſſued out all Orders for her as chief Miniſter, or to ſpeak more properly, as an abſolute Maſter. No Body was ſurprized at this new Honour that arrived to him, for they made no Queſtion, but that after ſuch ſtrange unaccountable Beginnings, he was marked out and deſigned for the Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>Being elevated to ſo eminent a poſt, he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing but ſome Friends to help and ſupport him, if it ever ſhould be his ill Fortune to make a wrong Step. And it was no difficult Matter for him to effect it in ſo advantageous a Situation, where all Favours, all the Mony, all the Offices and Benefices were at his intire Diſpoſal. But as ſoon as ever he procured a Favour for any ſingle Grandee, he at the ſame Moment diſobliged above twenty more, who from that time dated themſelves his mortal Enemies, and heartily wiſhed his Ruin, becauſe he did not prefer them: So that he was often heard to complain and regret his Fate, for that he could not ſatisfie all the World. And as the Number of his Friends was infinitely inferiour to that of his Enemies, ſo the latter began to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0148502701:54"/>
cabal againſt him, and think of ſome way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to oblige <hi>Don Juan</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> to return, out of an Expectation that he was the fitteſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to remove this univerſal Grievance, this new Creature <hi>Valenzuela.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Cabal of Malecontents increaſed ſo mightily, that there was almoſt nothing to be ſeen but Paſquils, Lampoons, and Satyrs, both in Proſe and Verſe againſt the Queen and againſt him. Nay they had the boldneſs to give out, that he hindered her Majeſty from recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Services of ſeveral Perſons, who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe might have expected conſiderable Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. In ſhort, their inſolence proceeded ſo far, that one Night very near the Palace, they hung up the Portraiture of the Queen with <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zuela.</hi> He had at his feet all the Marks that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented his ſeveral places, a Sword for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, an Anchor for Admiral, a Golden Key for Gentleman of the Bed Chamber, a Collar of the Fleece for Knight of that Order, and ſo of the reſt. He pointed at all theſe things with his hand, and below was written <hi>Eſte ſe Vende,</hi> that is to ſay, all this is ſold. And the Queen leaning her Hand upon his Heart with this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription <hi>Yeſte ſe da,</hi> that is to ſay, and this is given. The Report ran very ſtrong, that he ſold all Offices and Dignities at high Rates, at which ſome Perſons of the higheſt Quality were extremely offended, and his Avarice drew upon him abundance of Enemies.</p>
            <p>But what is ſtill the moſt remarkable is this, that all theſe various Reports made not the leaſt Impreſſion on the Queen. She ſaid <q rend="inline">That her rank placed her above theſe little Contumelies, and that ſhe ſhould be angry with her ſelf if ſhe were capable of being diſquieted at ſuch miſerable Reproaches, that were ſo infinitely
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0148502701:55"/>
below her indignation; that the moſt effectual way to puniſh and extinguiſh theſe licentious Abuſes was to take no notice of them, that the reaſon why they were ſo inveterate againſt the Marqueſs <hi>de Valenzuela</hi> proceeded only from their Envie, that ſhe was reſolved not to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and ſacrifice one of the beſt Subjects that the King her Son had, to gratifie the inſatiable Humour of ſome Malecontents that were never to be ſatisfied.</q> So that now it was apparent, that all the Methods they took to deſtroy this Favourite, ſerved only to confirm him ſo much the deeper in the Affections, and good Graces of the Queen.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs he uſed all poſſible Means to procure the good Will of the People, he took care that <hi>Madrid</hi> ſhould be always plentifully ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with Proviſions, neceſſary for Life; and that all ſorts of Commodities ſhould be ſold at cheap eaſie Rates. He often entertained the City with Bull-Feaſts, where he generally made his Appearance in a black Habit, embroidered over with Silver, and wore black and white Plumes, as being in ſecond Mourning, becauſe the Queen was a Widow: But as ſoon as ever he entred the Liſts, and according to the Cuſtom of thoſe that deſign to combat the Bulls, came under the Queen's Balcony making her a profound Reverence and demanding Permiſſion <hi>de Taurear,</hi> (as they call it there) ſhe ſent a Meſſenger to forbid him to expoſe himſelf. 'Twas obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in one of theſe Courſes, that he wore a Scarf of black Taffata embroidered o're with Gold, with the Device of an Eagle gazing ſtedfaſtly upon the Sun, and for the Motto theſe words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

on his Buckler, (for they always wear them at this ſort of Courſe, which is an ancient Diverſion of the <hi>Moors</hi>) armed with <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s Thunder, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame Motto, <hi>It is only permitted to me.</hi> There being no hazard to run in this Sport, the Queen was willing that <hi>Valenzuela</hi> ſhould ſhew his Dexterity, which he did, and carried away the Prize from a great number of young Lords, that diſputed it with him, and received from the Queen's hand a Sword beſet with Diamonds. They talked hotly at Court of the two Devices of the Favourite, and every one was ready to explain them according to his own Fancy and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination. He cauſed ſome Comedies of his compoſing to be publickly repreſented on the Theatre, and all the Town had the liberty of ſeeing them for nothing. This was the moſt taking way in the World to gain the hearts of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> for they are ſuch paſſionate Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of all publick Shows, that they will lay up the Mony, which ought to be ſpent in maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their poor Families, to purchaſe a dear Seat at a Bull-feaſt. <hi>Valenzuela</hi> was not ſatisfied to cultivate the Affections of the people by theſe magnificences, but ſought other ways to win their hearts. He ſet ſeveral noble Buildings on foot, rebuilt the great Square, the better part of which had been conſumed by Fire, and particularly the Houſe where their Majeſties went to behold the Courſes at the Bull-feaſts, and running at the Ring. He cauſed a Bridge to be built at the gate near <hi>Toledo</hi> over the <hi>Mancanares,</hi> that coſt a million of Ducats, and another Bridge over the ſame River at <hi>Pardo,</hi> which is a houſe of pleaſure belonging to the King. The Frontiſpiece and place before the Palace was finiſhed by his order, as alſo the Tower of the Queen's Apartment was raiſed much higher.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:0148502701:57"/>
He employed all his Thoughts in contributing to the diverſion of the Queen, and the King her Son; this young Prince now began to go to all the meetings of Sport and Pleaſure that were kept at <hi>Aranjues,</hi> the <hi>Eſcurial</hi> and the other Royal Houſes. One day when the Marqueſs <hi>de Valenzuela</hi> had received Orders of the King to prepare a Chaſe for him, and the Court was then at the <hi>Eſcurial,</hi> the King deſigning to ſhoot a Stag, ſhot his Favourite and wounded him on the Thigh; the Queen being terribly affrighted broke out into great Lamentations, and fainted away between the Arms of her Ladies. This accident occaſioned ſome People to predict the approaching Ruin of <hi>Valenzuela,</hi> whereof this odd Adventure ſeemed to be a Preſage.</p>
            <p>The time being now come to order the King's Houſhold, the Marqueſs made choice of all the Officers, he made the Duke <hi>d'Albuquerque</hi> Mayor <hi>Dome</hi> Mayor, the Admiral of <hi>Caſtile, Cavalleri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo</hi> Mayor, and the Duke <hi>de Medinacelli Sumiller de Corps,</hi> this Officer is the ſame in Effect with High Chamberlain, and puts on the Kings Shirt: The name is originally French, and comes from the Dukes of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> from whom the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> is deſcended. After the ſame manner he diſpoſed of the other places.</p>
            <p>Now as there were abundantly more Pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers than places to fill, he drew upon him by this means a conſiderable number of Enemies, who could not digeſt the Affront of having nothing given them, and were leſs inclined to Pardon him for that which directly concerned themſelves, than for what related to the Intereſt of State. At this time they thought more earneſtly than ever of <hi>Don Juan,</hi> hoping that he would come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge their Quarrel upon <hi>Valenzuela,</hi> and beſides they laboured under hand to convince the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0148502701:58"/>
King, how neceſſary it was for the better Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of Affairs to have the Prince about him.</p>
            <p>The Queen being informed of what was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned againſt her, paſſed many ſorrowful Days, and more melancholy Nights, altho ſhe had almoſt continual Conference with the Marqueſs; but ſhe could never repreſent to her mind the killing thought, that they would treat the Marqueſs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame cruel manner as they had uſed Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Nitard,</hi> but ſhe fell a weeping, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered all the Signs of a real Concern. She knew very well, that the Grandees frequently aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together, and that they ſpoke of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with all the freedom imaginable; that the Libels and Paſquils, that were inſolently ſcattered abroad, all tended to Defame her Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, were publickly owned and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by the Authors themſelves, and that ſhe was obliged to ſeem, as if ſhe knew nothing of thoſe matters, becauſe ſhe was not in a Capacity to puniſh them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Valenzuela</hi> for his part was not without his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie Moments, the Elevation of his Fortune only ſerved to make him ſenſible of the terrible Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice he was falling down, from which he did not perceive any viſible means to ſecure himſelf.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Don Juan,</hi> who continued ſtill at <hi>Saragoſſa,</hi> was diſcontented at his Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, how honourable ſoever it appeared, it is ſufficient that it was not voluntary, and that was enough to make him diſreliſh it. The Queen and he had ſtill the ſame natural Averſion to one another as formerly, and notwithſtanding the fair Appearances of his outward Behaviour, he laboured underhand with his Friends to get himſelf declared, Infant <hi>de Caſtile.</hi> At leaſt people report it of him; 'tis indeed very true, that he was never able to accompliſh that Deſign, but
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0148502701:59"/>
they pretend that he was not abſolutely without hopes to effect it.</p>
            <p>However it was, he made ſo great a Faction, by the means of ſome conſiderable perſons about the King, who were for promoting his Return, that his Friends ſent him word, that the King deſired it, that every thing was diſpoſed, and ready to receive him, and that the credit of the Queen would never be able to ſtand in Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt his.</p>
            <p>This good news obliged him to quit <hi>Arragon,</hi> and make all the haſte he could to arrive at <hi>Buen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiro</hi> 1677.</p>
            <p>To bring about this Affair with more Facility, they gave the King to underſtand, <q rend="inline">That he was not only under the Tutorage of the Queen his Mother, but under that of <hi>Valenzuela.</hi> They afterwards repreſented to him the Conſtraint he lived under in ſuch lively Colours, that he proteſted he would free himſelf immediately from this Servitude.</q> And altho the Queen had always her Eye upon him, for fear he ſhould be ſeduced by any ill Counſels, and take contrary meaſures to what ſhe preſcribed him, yet he found the opportunity one night to ſteal out of the Palace with only one Gentleman of his Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, who lay in his Room, and ſo muffled up in his Cloak he walk'd on foot to <hi>Retiro,</hi> which was far enough off: From thence he diſpatch'd an Order immediately to the Queen not to ſtir out of the Palace.</p>
            <p>It is eaſie to imagine what Entertainment ſuch mortifying news found with her, and what Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects this ſudden reverſe of Fortune cauſed in a Princeſs, who had been accuſtomed to govern.</p>
            <p>She employed the remainder of the night in writing to the King, conjuring him in the moſt
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0148502701:60"/>
tender Terms to give her leave to viſit him, but he ſtill refuſed it.</p>
            <p>While the King tarried at <hi>Retiro,</hi> the people being informed of his Intentions, flock'd in Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes to ſalute and acknowledge him. All the Lords of the Court made him very conſiderable Preſents, ſo that ſome Perſons valued them at a hundred thouſand Crowns, either in Mony, Plate, Tapiſtry or Diamonds. There was an univerſal Joy at <hi>Madrid</hi> upon this occaſion, and that for theſe two reaſons, which equally cauſed it. The firſt is, the exceeding Affection the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have for their Prince, the ſecond, becauſe the Queen was ſo ill beloved, and beſides the People could never forget ſome words that drop'd from her once, viz. <hi>That ſhe ſhould never be at rest, till ſhe had brought them all to be cloathed with Eſtera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> This is a ſort of a courſe Matt made of Ruſhes, that ſerves them for Mattreſſes and their Bedding.</p>
            <p>The next night after the King's Retreat, they made Illuminations in all the Streets.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as <hi>Don Juan</hi> arrived, he obliged the King to remove the Queen from thence, ſo ſhe was ſent to <hi>Toledo,</hi> with poſitive orders not to ſtir out of that City. The unfortunate <hi>Valenzuela</hi> took his Leave of her with all the Teſtimonies of Grief and Duty, that ſo ſhort a time would allow him, and retired to the <hi>Eſcurial</hi> according to order.</p>
            <p>Thus there being a new face of Affairs, every body made his Court and Application to <hi>Don Juan,</hi> and the King by his extraordinary Careſſes, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently teſtified how joyful he was to ſee him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. He commanded him to take care of all his Affairs, and indeed <hi>Don Juan</hi> rendred himſelf ſo abſolute a Maſter, that his Authority became much greater than that of the Queen, and her two chief Miniſters.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:0148502701:61"/>
               <hi>Don Juan</hi> earneſtly deſired to have <hi>Valenzuela</hi>'s perſon in his Power, but could not tell whither he was gone. At laſt being informed that he was to be found at the <hi>Eſcurial</hi> he ſhewed a great deal of Joy at the news. This is one of the King's Houſes, and is of ſo prodigious an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that if we take in the Buildings, the Park, and a Convent of Religious <hi>Jeronomits,</hi> which is contained within the Precincts of it, 'tis thought it is ſeveral Leagues in compaſs, and is all incloſed with Walls.</p>
            <p>The King commanded <hi>Don Antonio de Toledo,</hi> Son to the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> to go thither in perſon and arreſt <hi>Valenzuela</hi>; he departed immediately with the Duke <hi>De Medina Sidonia,</hi> and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>de Valpa rayſo, Don Fernand de Toledo,</hi> ſeveral perſons of great quality, and two hundred Horſe. The Marqueſs was then walking in an adjoyning Forreſt full of Heavineſs and Melancholy, but hearing on a ſudden a great noiſe about him, and being informed at the ſame time, of what had happened, by a certain Meſſenger, whom ſome of his Friends had ſent in all ſpeed to acquaint him with the News; he returned haſtily to the <hi>Fſcurial</hi>; and finding out the Prior of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of the <hi>Jeronomites,</hi> who was a very honeſt man, and particularly concerned at the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of this Favourite, he told him in a few words what danger he was in, and what reaſons he had to apprehend the loſs of his Life, in caſe he was taken; praying and conjuring him with all imaginable earneſtneſs to conceal him in ſome place of Safety.</p>
            <p>The Prior immediately ordered a Hole to be contrived in a Cell, belonging to one of the Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ligious, of whoſe Confidence he was well aſſu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red: This Cell it ſeems was all over Wainſcoted, ſo that taking down one of the Pannels of the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0148502701:62"/>
Wainſcot, and making a Cavity in the Wall which was of a conſiderable Thickneſs, in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a Nitch, they threw in a few Mats, and there the poor Marqueſs was ſhut up.</p>
            <p>It being very well known, that the Marqueſs was retired into the Convent, there was no place or corner left unſearch'd by <hi>Don Antonio de Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> and thoſe that accompanied him. They had ſo ſmall a reſpect to the moſt holy places, that they almoſt turned every thing in the Church upſide down.</p>
            <p>But their Search was to no purpoſe; and <hi>Don Antonio</hi> could not tell what to reſolve upon. He had been upon the hunt there ſeveral days to find out <hi>Valenzuela,</hi> who, as he now began to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, had certainly found the means to ſave himſelf: When the unhappy Marqueſs being almoſt ſtifled in the Hole for want of Air, and beſides diſordered with his late Afflictions, fell ſo dangerouſly ill, that there were little hopes of his Life. Finding himſelf therefore in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparate Condition, he cared not what became of him: But the Father Prior having firſt taken the Chirurgion of the Convent's word to keep the ſecret inviolably, ſent him to the Marqueſs to let him Blood: This treacherous Villain within a quarter of an hour after diſcovered the whole Myſtery to <hi>Don Antonio,</hi> who had been it ſeems in the Cell, where poor <hi>Valenzuela</hi> lay immured, almoſt every day ſince he began to make the Search after him. He then immediately entred the Convent, and all on the ſudden commanded the Pannel, which covered the Marqueſs, to be taken down. He found him faſt aſleep: But very much altered by his Indiſpoſition and Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes; his Arms lay ready by him, and if he had been awake, there is no queſtion to be made but that he had reſolutely defended
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0148502701:63"/>
himſelf, being a perſon of great Courage and Bravery: And beſides what would not a man attempt in ſo deplorable a Condition?</p>
            <p>He was conducted to the Caſtle <hi>de Conſuegra,</hi> which belongs to the Grand Priory of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> of the order of <hi>Malta. Don Juan</hi> choſe to make this the Scene of his Confinement, becauſe the Caſtle depended upon him. <hi>Valenzuela</hi> lay there dangerouſly ſick, and often ſaid in the hearing of his Guards, <hi>Oh Heavens! and there is no hope then that I ſhall die immediately, must I ſtill live after I have endured ſo many Afflictions?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When he was ſomewhat better, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to the Caſtle <hi>de los Puntales</hi> at <hi>Cadiz,</hi> where he ſuffered a very cloſe Impriſonment; nevertheleſs he ſhewed a great deal of Conſtancy and Reſolution, in the midſt of all his ill Uſage and Diſgraces.</p>
            <p>At laſt he was imbarked in a Veſſel to be ſent to <hi>Chile</hi> in the <hi>Philippines.</hi> Theſe are certain Iſlands in the extreameſt Part of the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> almoſt adjoyning to <hi>China.</hi> 'Tis a long<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and tedious Voyage thither, and they generally tranſport their moſt notorious Criminals in <hi>Spain</hi> to thoſe Places, where they are forced to work in the Quickſilver mines. They ſeldom tarry above two years in that ſlaviſh Employment but they die, or at leaſt are troubled with a general trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling in their Limbs, which makes them ſuffer infinitely more than Death it ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Valenzuela</hi> was informed before his Departure, that he was degraded from all his Honours, and that the King had taken away all his Offices, leaving only his bare name to him. <hi>I perceive then,</hi> ſays he very penſively, <hi>that I am under more unfortunate Circumſtances by far, than when I first came to Court, and the Duke</hi> de l'Infantado <hi>took me for his Page.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:0148502701:64"/>
But tho they took care to acquaint him with what related particularly to himſelf, yet he could learn nothing of the Queen's Deſtiny, or what became of his Wife and Children. They had ſhut up her Majeſty together with them in a Convent at <hi>Talavera de la Reine,</hi> and ſtrictly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Abbeſs, not to let them ſtir abroad, or ſpeak to any body.</p>
            <p>'Tis commonly reported, that at the time, when he was at the Port of <hi>Cales</hi> ready to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barque, a woman of an extraordinary ſize, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly dreſs'd, and covered with her Veil, as it is the Spaniſh Faſhion, buſtled through the Guards cloſe up to him. <hi>Take courage</hi> Valenzuela, ſays ſhe to him, <hi>thy Enemy will die, and thou ſhalt once more ſee</hi> Spain.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that heard her ſay ſo, would have ſtop'd her, but ſhe found out means to make her Eſcape. What ſhe told him afterwards proved in Effect to be true, for <hi>Don Juan</hi> died, and one of the firſt Graces that the Queen-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther begged of the King at her Return to <hi>Madrid,</hi> was to have <hi>Valenzuela</hi> recalled home. So a Veſſel was ſent to the <hi>Philippines</hi> to bring him back, but he found to his ſorrow, that <hi>d'Eguya</hi> hindered his return, altho the Queen ſo earneſtly deſired it.</p>
            <p>The Pope having received Information of what had paſſed, as well in the Church as in the Convent, when they dragged <hi>Valenzuela</hi> by force out of the <hi>Eſcurial,</hi> excommunicated all thoſe that were concerned in the Fact; ſo that before the Lords could prevail to have the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Cenſure taken off, which by this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation of the Churches Liberty they had incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they were obliged in white Sheets and Halters about their Necks to walk to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Colledge, where Cardinal <hi>Mellini,</hi> who
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0148502701:65"/>
was then Nuncio at <hi>Madrid,</hi> made each of them undergo ſome Blows of Diſcipline.</p>
            <p>All the Kingdom teſtified an extraordinary Satisfaction to ſee <hi>Don Juan</hi> enter upon the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and we may ſafely ſay, that all the Hopes and Expectations of <hi>Spain</hi> were lodged in him.</p>
            <p>As he was Maſter of a great deal of Wit and Vivacity, ſo it was natural to believe that the different Employments of his Life, whether in Peace or War, rendred him extreamly capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of repairing the Breaches and reforming all the Irregularities of the State. Several of the Grandees had entred into a ſort of an Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for his Return: and now they had leiſure to make ſevere Reflections upon the weakneſs of the late Government, where they found nothing but private Intreagues and little Factions, that were extremely diſadvantageous to the Publick Intereſt.</p>
            <p>A German Queen, an Infant King, a Foreigner Chief Miniſter of State and Confeſſor, <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zuela</hi> made a Favourite and Miniſter; without Birth and without Capacity, raiſed upon the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by a ſtrange Caprice of Fortune, and thrown down again into his primitive Nothing: In fine, all their hopes centred in <hi>Don Juan,</hi> and they had long expected him almoſt to a Degree of Impatience: But when he was once arrived, and they beheld him at a nearer View, preſently all thoſe great and glorious Ideas, which they had conceived of him, vaniſhed away like a Dream.</p>
            <p>This is commonly the Fate and Deſtiny of all great Miniſters; the high place they poſſeſs, only ſerves to expoſe them the more to the Envy of their Inferiours. Even thoſe perſons that took the greateſt Pains to place them in that Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, think they have laboured all the while for
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0148502701:66"/>
an ungrateful Wretch, and if he fails to ſhower down all his Favours upon them, will be ſure to give him leſs quarter than any men elſe. So ſmall a diſtance there is from publick Favour and Admiration to publick Hatred. This Rule which generally holds at all times and in all places, did not fail to be accompliſhed in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Don Juan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moſt people were concerned to ſee what harſh Uſage he gave the Queen, and could not forbear to accuſe his Obſtinacy, for refuſing to enter <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi> till the Queen was gone out, and on her way to <hi>Toledo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was not content with this Affront that he put upon her at his firſt Appearance, but to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble her ſtill the more, he added another that was full as mortifying, he deſcended into a ſevere Examination of her paſt Conduct, the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of which had the leaſt Relation to the preſent State of Affairs, and only tended to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame her.</p>
            <p>This Princeſs ſuffered with an incredible Grief a Treatment ſo unbeſitting her high Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſo injurious to her Reputation, but all other ways of ſhewing her Reſentments were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied her, and ſhe had nothing left to exerciſe ſave only her Patience and Virtue.</p>
            <p>But ſeveral Perſons of Quality that were ſtill linked to her, whether out of Affection or Duty, could not without a ſenſible Affliction, behold the Oppreſſion ſhe lay under. They generally ſpoke of it with Heat and Indignation, and ſpread abroad a Report, that altho <hi>Don Juan</hi> was no legitimate Prince, yet he flattered himſelf that he ſhould one day become abſolute Maſter of the Monarchy.</p>
            <p>Abundance of people maintained the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, alledging that he was never guilty of ſuch a
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0148502701:67"/>
Deſign, and that if he had been capable of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring any ſuch thoughts, he might eaſily have ſucceeded in them, by the aſſiſtance of his own Party which was very numerous, and by his own Power; that the King was but fifteen years old, and beſides was equally deſtitute of Authority and Experience.</p>
            <p>What occaſion'd this Suſpicion was his eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſome Innovations that were never practiſed by any Miniſter before him. One that made the greateſt noiſe was this, that in his Chamber of Audience he would never give the right Hand nor a Seat to the Ambaſſadors. At firſt they ſhewed themſelves extreamly diſobliged at it, but at laſt the Nuncio and the other foreign Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſubmitted to this Rule, and viſited him without Difficulty. The Queen's Creatures made a greater buſtle about this affair than even the Ambaſſadors themſelves, who were only concerned in it, and whether they diſcourſed of it with too much freedom, or <hi>Don Juan</hi> only ſuſpected their private Sentiments, he cauſed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of them to be baniſhed. Among the reſt were the Admiral of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> the Duke <hi>de Oſſone,</hi> the Prince <hi>de Stillano,</hi> the Marqueſs <hi>de Manſera,</hi> the Count <hi>d'Humanez,</hi> the Count <hi>d'Aquillar,</hi> and the Marqueſs <hi>de Mondejar.</hi> The laſt of whom was accuſed for making the following Verſes, but they were miſtaken in the Author, for they were written by the Admiral, who was a perſon of extraordinary Wit.</p>

               <hi>Don Juan</hi> found theſe Verſes upon his Toil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lette, and in ſeveral other places of his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; he was more concerned at them, than in reaſon he ought to be, for certainly he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſo vain as to imagine that he was equally acceptable to all the World. Theſe Reſentments having ſowred and exaſperated his Spirit, he obſerved that the Converſation of the Count <hi>de Monterey</hi> diverted the King; this was enough to render him ſuſpected; and altho this Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had ſet himſelf at the Head of a Party, which declared for the Princes Return, yet all his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices were forgot, and the Prejudices of Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, which are ſometimes too headſtrong to be maſtered, made <hi>Don Juan</hi> ſend him to command in <hi>Catalonia.</hi>

               </gap> the ill Effects of a bad Education; for a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter that regards nothing in the world but what has a particular relation to his own Intereſts, will be ſure to keep back thoſe Lights from his Prince, that may help him afterwards to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver by what an ill Conduct he is managed. <hi>Don Juan</hi> was very well acquainted with the Policy of this Maxim, and accordingly took care to conceal the affairs of State from the King, with as much Precaution as the Prieſts keep their My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries from the People. To make himſelf al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways neceſſary to him, he never inſtructed him in the Art of governing, but perpetually amuſed him with ſome little inſignificant Diverſions, that poſſeſſed his tender years with a Spirit of Lazineſs, which could never fail to produce ill Conſequences afterwards, and never gave him leave to ſtir a foot out of the Palace but in his own Company.</p>
            <p>The People that are never ſenſible of Events, but at the very Moment when they feel the Smart, had perhaps looked upon the Baniſhment of the Lords, and the captivity of their King with an indifferent Eye, if they had not been Sufferers themſelves. But the great Scarcity of Proviſions that were daily inhanced, the irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Adminiſtration of Juſtice, and the diſorderly Management of the <hi>Finances,</hi> made them ſoon ſenſible, that the changing of Maſters is not always for the better. And as it is natural to run headlong from one extream into another, and the juſt Limits of carrying on a Reformation are known but to a very few Peerſons, ſo they began to diſreliſh the Regency, and to ſhew a Diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0148502701:73"/>
that might eaſily have been improv'd into an inſurrection, but that the anger of the People of <hi>Spain</hi> is generally week and feeble, and 'tis not only upon theſe occaſions that the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent fierceneſs of that Nation goes off, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes. For 'tis very true, that the People con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves there with railing and murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, ſo that if there was any thing to be feared it was from the Grandees, who nothwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their baniſhment, left very conſiderable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and Friends behind them at Court: Theſe being concerned to ſee them exiled, began pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately to join and aſſociate for the ſame Cauſe; they proceeded ſo far as to ſignifie to the Queen that they paſſionately deſir'd her return, and that ſhe ought to attempt ſomething on her ſide, as they were reſolv'd to do ſomething on theirs, and in ſhort they took an occaſion to diſcourſe the King about the matter.</p>
            <p>They made him ſenſible that he was under a ſlaviſh ignominious dependance, and confirmed him in his natural inclinations to take the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the State into his own hands.</p>
            <p>He reliſhed very well the overtures they made him, and the Queen likewiſe received her infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations not without pleaſure; but it was not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to wiſh well, ſomething of Action was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary: for the King was young, wanted aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and every one ſhifted it off from himſelf to another. The pleaſures of the Court, and that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zineſs which is ſo peculiar to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> made them advance ſo ſlowly in their affairs, that Don <hi>Joan</hi> had leiſure enough to deſtroy in one day the Foundations they had been laying for ſeveral weeks. The Queen for her part was under a conſinement, which held her chained to the place, ſo that ſhe could attempt nothing without being diſcovered. She was affraid too of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0148502701:74"/>
Traitors among her own Servants, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing new Diſgraces upon her, whilſt ſhe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to free her ſelf from thoſe ſhe lay under at preſent. What was paſt inſtructed her in ſome meaſure to fear and avoid what was to come</p>
            <p>As ſhe is naturally of a ſlow diſpoſition, ſo after long reflections upon the matter, ſhe was of the opinion, that ſhe ought not by any precipitate actions hazard the future repoſe of her life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Juan</hi> on his ſide was alarm'd with conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual fears and jealouſies; and having abundance of Spies about him, he was inſtructed of what he did not care to hear, the unwearied deſigns that were daily form'd againſt him. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the great Authority and Power, with which he was inveſted, he could not for bear very ſenſibly to apprehend the bad conſequences of an averſion, that began to be entertained ſo general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt him.</p>
            <p>He was in a manner Reſponſible for all the good and all the bad ſucceſſes of the State, and the Weight of ſo cumberſom a Monarchy hung very heavy about him. He ſometimes conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with regret the Tranquility he had formerly enjoyed in <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Arragon</hi>; in fine his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit was not in its natural Sphere, and we may ſay of him, that he even over bought the pleaſure of making ſo great a figure on the Theatre of the World.</p>
            <p>The War that was kindled 1672. between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> intereſted ſeveral Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> who took their ſides in it, either accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their ſeveral Inclinations, or elſe the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular engagements they had to the Powers, that were then at variance. <hi>Spain,</hi> which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways inſeparable from the intereſts of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, neither ſpared her Mony nor Forces upon
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0148502701:75"/>
this occaſion, when the <hi>Hollanders</hi> made a peace with <hi>France</hi> firſt in the year 1678. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and ſome of the Princes of the Empire fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed their Example, nay <hi>Spain</hi> could not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it ſelf from doing the like. The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> and Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> who as yet kept their Swords in their hands ſtill, laid them down likewiſe, and a Peace was concluded at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> that gave Repoſe to all <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the point off marrying the Arch-Dutcheſs, the Emperor's Daughter: This Affair was ſo far advanced, that the Articles were regulated, and the Contract ſigned. This Marriage was of the Queen's doing, who earneſtly deſired the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of it; but <hi>Don Juan</hi> at his Return broke of this Match, not being deſirous to ſtrengthen his Enemies Party, as it muſt aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have been by the Acceſſion of this young Princeſs, who was of the ſame Name and ſame Country with the Queen, and beſides all this, was her Grand Daughter and Neice. He too much feared the ill Conſequences of this Affair to give his conſent to it.</p>
            <p>The King about his nineteenth year ſeemed to be ſettled in a healthful State of body, which promiſed Succeſſors to the Crown, and he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed a great Inclination to be married; he conſidered that of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> he alone was left remaining of the Spaniſh Branch, and that his whole Kingdom had an equal intereſt to ſee him have Children.</p>
            <p>The Circumſtances of the Peace, that hapned to be concluded at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> made him caſt his Eyes upon Mademoiſelle, Eldeſt Daughter of Monſieur, who was the Kings only Brother. She was almoſt of his own age, amiable, well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaped, of a ſweet Diſpoſition, witty and charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0148502701:76"/>
All her inclinations were noble and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and <hi>Lewis</hi> the Great took an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary affection to her, becauſe her Humour ſo exactly ſuited with his, ſo that all the Courtiers were ſurprized at it.</p>
            <p>The King had accidentally ſeen ſome Portrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of this Princeſs, and ſeveral Spaniſh Lords who had been at the Court of <hi>France</hi> ſpake of her as a Prodigy. Theſe advantagious Teſtimonies ſo luckily concurring, ſenſibly affected him, he could not take his reſt a nights, he carried her Picture next his Heart, and held long Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with it, as if it underſtood him. But what is the moſt incredible thing of all, and yet is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated for a certain Truth, is this, that before he became enamoured he could not endure any Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man near him, but theſe Diſpoſitions were alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in him upon this occaſion, and he beheld the fair Sex never after with Averſion.</p>
            <p>All the People were raviſhed with Joy to hear that the King deſired Mademoiſelle. The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> the firſt Wife of <hi>Philip</hi> the IV. was ſo deeply imprinted upon the Hearts of all the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to ſee one of the ſame blood ſit upon the Throne again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Juan</hi> agreed with the Kings inclinations, as well as thoſe of the People in Relation to this Princeſs. He ſent orders to the Marqueſs <hi>de los Balbazez</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> who was come from <hi>Nime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen,</hi> where he had aſſiſted at the Treaty of Peace, to go and demand Mademoiſelle for the King his Maſter.</p>
            <p>Every one was ſurprized that the Prince lent his helping Hand to this Affair. True Policy would have required him to protract as long as he was able and to delay the Marriage, becauſe
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0148502701:77"/>
as it gave a Wife to the King, ſo it might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps give an Enemy to the Favourite.</p>
            <p>And here many People could not forbear to call to mind the firſt Ideas of that Ambition, of which he was ſuſpected; now it was for good and all to abandon the Deſign of making himſelf declared Infant, to content himſelf with reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the King, in caſe he had no Children. Many Perſons do likewiſe pretend, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the great Earneſtneſs he ſhewed in publick, yet he had no over great Deſire to have the Match ſucceed. They alledge this for a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that he ought to have done ſomething be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo open an Embaſſy, by way of ſecret Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatches, which might abſolutely have had the Succeſs of a Negotiation: But that at the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, whatever he did or whatever he ſaid to the contrary, he did not heartily deſire it; that he was afraid leſt a French Queen, ſupported by the Authority of the greateſt King in the World, would never truckle to him; that now he was Maſter, but hereafter would become no more than a Companion, Others were of the contrary opinion, and ſaid that he had a fair Proſpect of being well received by Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle, eſpecially ſince he had broke off the Marriage with the Arch Dutcheſs, and given the Preference to her. Theſe different Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations embarraſſed and perplexed <hi>Don Juan</hi> to ſuch a Degree, that he knew not which way to determine himſelf, and even at the very time that the Marqueſs <hi>de los Balbazez</hi> demanded the Princeſs in <hi>France,</hi> he very cunningly got the King at <hi>Madrid</hi> to ſee the Portraiture of the Infanta of <hi>Portugal,</hi> who was a Lady of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Beauty: He talked exceedingly of her Charms, and not knowing as yet that her Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was agreed upon,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0148502701:78"/>
he underhand made a Propoſal to give her to the King; but he was too deeply gone to alter his Affections.</p>
            <p>The Demand made by <hi>Don Balbazez</hi> was very agreeable to his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, and <hi>Don Juan</hi> who received Advice of it, did not at firſt doubt of its Succeſs. Therefore he now endeavoured to overſhoot the favourable Diſpoſitions of <hi>France,</hi> either to promote his own intereſt by it, or elſe by demanding things that were too great, to meet a Refuſal, and by that means to find a plauſible Pretence to break off. In effect, he pretended that Mademoiſelle not being the Daughter of a King, they ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for that reaſon on the ſide of the French Court to enter into particular Conſiderations, and reſtore to <hi>Spain</hi> ſome of thoſe Places, that were yielded up to <hi>France</hi> by the laſt Treaty of <hi>Nimeguen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this he held a Council, where he was deſirous to inſinuate his own Sentiments into them, but he found no body inclined to hearken to them. Every one concluded, that they ought to have nothing elſe in view but the King's Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; that they were happy enough in find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out a Princeſs, that was beautiful and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to give them a Soveraign, and that they ought not to take pains to deſtroy a thing of that Conſequence, which all the World ſo earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly deſired to ſee accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>The Queen who continued ſtill very ſolitary at <hi>Toledo,</hi> and who was conſulted in no affairs, wrote a Letter to the King, wherein ſhe told him, ſhe had received Information that he was going to be married, that ſhe counſelled him in the mean time, while that Affair was carrying on, to go to <hi>Arragon,</hi> and <hi>Catalonia,</hi> to confirm the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Privileges of thoſe People. The King ſent
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0148502701:79"/>
her barely word again that he would do it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out explaining himſelf more openly upon his Marriage.</p>
            <p>Ever ſince the twenty fourth of <hi>January</hi> 1679. the King had nominated thoſe Perſons who were to fill up the reſpective Offices of the Houſe of the new Queen. The Dutcheſs <hi>de Terra Nova</hi> was made <hi>Camarera Major,</hi> that is, firſt Lady of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, but her Power is of a greater Extent than that of the other Ladies of Honour; becauſe ſhe is Miſtreſs of all the Women that ſerve the Queen in her Palace. She is the Widow of the Duke <hi>de Terra Nova,</hi> who was of the Houſe of <hi>Pignatelli,</hi> and a Grandee of <hi>Spain.</hi> She inherited a vaſt For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune that deſcended to her from <hi>Fernando Cortez,</hi> for her Mother bore the Name of that famous Captain, who left her a ſmall Kingdom in the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> tho he might, if he pleaſed, have left her a more conſiderable one in that Part of the World, where he made ſo great a Progreſs.</p>
            <p>She is deſcended of a Branch of the Houſe of <hi>Arragon,</hi> that ſetled a long while ago in <hi>Sicily</hi>; ſhe is extreamly rich, of a fierce imperious Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour towards Perſons that are above her, inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable to her Equals, but kind and obliging to her Inferiours. She has a world of Wit, is fixed in her Reſolutions, and is of a deep penetrating Spirit: Her Temper cold and ſerious, ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving her Spaniſh Gravity, and never ſteps a foot backward or forward unleſs ſhe has well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered of it before. She thunders out her <hi>I will,</hi> or <hi>I will not,</hi> enough to make one tremble.</p>
            <p>She is a meager pale Woman, of a long and wrickled Viſage, her Eyes little and ſevere, in ſhort ſhe makes a dangerous terrible Enemy. <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

becauſe he demanded of her Reſtitution of the Dutchy of <hi>Terra Nova,</hi> which was in her Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, altho of right it belonged to him.</p>
            <p>The terrible Noiſe this Affair made in the World, obliged her to retire into <hi>Arragon,</hi> where <hi>Don Juan</hi> reſided at that time, deeply afflicted at his Misfortunes.</p>
            <p>Both of them imagined, that they had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to complain of the Severity of their Fortune, and this ſoon occaſioned a certain Friendſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, as it uſually happens amongſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of their Quality when they come to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in the ſame Circumſtances. After they had frequently converſed with one another, the Prince found out part of the Dutcheſſe's Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; he knew ſhe was ambitious, but as all the other ill qualities of her Soul were outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet off by the appearance of a great Devotion, he never took her for ſo malicious and ſpight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a Devil, as ſhe really was. He therefore caſt his Eyes upon her to make her <hi>Camarera Major</hi> for the young Queen.</p>
            <p>The Marqueſs <hi>d'Aſtorgas</hi> was nominated at the ſame time to be Grand Maſter of her Houſe. <hi>Don Juan</hi> had ſome thoughts at firſt of confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this Office upon <hi>Don Vincente Gonzaga</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and made him quit his Viceroyſhip of <hi>Sicily</hi> to come and poſſeſs it, which the other freely left, in Conſideration of the Place, that was now offered him. But his Expectations were deceived; for the Marqueſs <hi>d'Aſtorgas,</hi> who had heaped up a prodigious Wealth when he was Viceroy or <hi>Naples,</hi> having profered the uſe of it to <hi>Don Juan,</hi> who migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily ſtood in need of Mony at that time and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the Profer, was preferred to <hi>Don Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cente,</hi> who was admitted however into the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0148502701:81"/>
Council of State, where his great Abilities, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Queſtion, did great Service.</p>
            <p>Altho the Duke <hi>d'Oſſone</hi> continued as yet in exile, <hi>Don Juan</hi> did not forget to nominate him for Maſter of the Horſe to the Queen; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed that Place upon him only that he might have an opportunity to take away from him that of the Preſident of the Orders, where his Conduct it ſeems did not pleaſe him. He affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a certain Air of Devotion that ſat very diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably upon him, becauſe he mixed too much Bigotry with it, and it was a ſtrange ſort of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotry too; for this good Duke one evening cauſed the Count <hi>d'Humanez</hi> to be ſet upon in the Streets by ſome men of <hi>Valencia,</hi> who never come to <hi>Madrid</hi> but to commit Murders and other Crimes of that nature. The occaſion of the Quarrel was this, the Duke was paſſionately in Love with a certain Lady, and ſoon after came to diſcover that the Count was a more fortunate man than himſelf. Nevertheleſs the Count eſcaped the Danger. This affair made a great Buſtle; <hi>Don Juan</hi> who was particularly diſguſted at the Duke, laid hold of this oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to baniſh him the Court, but now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured this conſiderable poſt for him, that he might gain over to his party a man of ſo great an importance; beſides it was his intereſt to ſee the Chief Offices of the Queen's Houſe fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with thoſe Perſons that were at his Devotion, and might prepoſſeſs the mind of that young Princeſs in favour of him. The other Officers of her Houſe were likewiſe nominated about the the beginning of <hi>March.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the ſame time the Marqueſs <hi>de Manſera, Major Domo</hi> to the Queen-Mother was fined a hundred thouſand Crowns, which he paid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Nail. After this manner the King ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0148502701:82"/>
puniſhes the Crimes that the Grandees commit againſt him. He was ſoon after baniſhed to the Caſtle <hi>de Cocchia,</hi> and his place was given to the Count <hi>de Chinchon.</hi> But the Queen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing highly incenſed at theſe Proceedings, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that ſhe would never ſuffer it, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Widow of <hi>Philip</hi> the fourth, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond ought not to be treated after this unworthy manner; ſo they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to let the matter drop, and proceed no farther in it.</p>
            <p>There happened a little after another buſineſs, that occaſioned a great Clamour. <hi>Don Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co de Toledo,</hi> ſecond Son of the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> the Count <hi>de Mirande</hi> Grandee of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Marqueſs <hi>de Valero</hi> Son of the Duke <hi>de Bejar,</hi> and the eldeſt Son of the Duke <hi>de Seſſa</hi> occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Eſcape of a man, that was accuſed of great Crimes. The manner whereby they brought it about, was this. They ſent a Woman with a Basket of Fiſh to ſtand near the Priſon, ſhe ſold ſuch good Pennyworths there, that a man ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the pupoſe having informed the Jaylor, and the Keepers of it, they preſently ran to the place to by ſome Fiſh. The Woman amuſed them with abundance of fooliſh Stories ſo well, that ſhe ſuceeded in her Deſign, for in the mean time the above-mentioned Lords broke open the Priſon Gates.</p>
            <p>The King ordered all of them to be arreſted, however this Affair, like others of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at <hi>Madrid,</hi> brought no ill Conſequences upon them.</p>
            <p>The King took all the care imaginable to have the young Queens Apartments in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace fitted up, and made ready. He was to have gone according to the uſual Cuſtom, in the Month of <hi>April</hi> to <hi>Aranjues,</hi> but <hi>Don Juan</hi>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:0148502701:83"/>
hindred him, becauſe that place was too near <hi>Tolcdo,</hi> ſo he went to <hi>Buen-Retiro.</hi> The Queen-Mother wrote to him thither, deſiring that he would be pleaſed to come and ſee her; but tho ſhe preſs'd it with a great deal of Tenderneſs and Importunity, ſhe was not able to ſucceed in her Deſires.</p>
            <p>He diverted himſelf every day with hunting and ſeeing Comedies, either at <hi>Pardo</hi> or <hi>Zar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zuela,</hi> which are two Houſes of Pleaſure belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> The Opera <hi>d'Alcine</hi> was repreſented before him, it coſt a world of Mony, but was miſerably performed.</p>
            <p>There was likewiſe a Bull-feaſt kept, where two young Cavaliers unfortunately periſhed. On the following day there was running at the Ring.</p>
            <p>About this time the Prince <hi>de Ligne</hi> arrived, and a day or two after kiſſed his Majeſty's hand, and took his Place at the Council of State. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Francis de Relux</hi> a Dominican came likewiſe from <hi>Salamanca,</hi> where he had been Profeſſor of Divinity, and was choſen by <hi>Don Juan</hi> to be the Kings Confeſſor. The Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> had enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that he ſhould ſubmit himſelf intirely to <hi>Don Juan</hi>'s Will, who accepted him upon his Parole. At this time the Cardinal <hi>de Portacarero</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Toledo</hi> returned from <hi>Rome.</hi> The Court at <hi>Madrid</hi> was very full and numerous.</p>

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0148502701:84"/>
that Reception, which he might reaſonably pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe himſelf: They knew well enough that the natural Haughtineſs of <hi>Don Juan</hi> would never comply with the Inſtructions of that Miniſter, who to be ſure would never go to viſit the Prince, unleſs he were aſſured beforehand of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the honour of the Hand, the Step and the Chair; that <hi>Don Juan</hi> would never conſent to this Propoſal, becauſe it was not to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that he would eaſily give up the rights he had obtained over the other Ambaſſadors, and that it would be an inconvenient thing for him of <hi>France</hi> not to treat directly with the chief Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter. What People ſurmiſed upon this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on really happened, for rhe Prince would not bate him an Ace, and the Marqueſs <hi>de Villars</hi> kept faſt to his Inſtructions. Therefore they looked upon one another with great coldneſs, but nevertheleſs this did not hinder the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor from having a private Audience of the King on the eighth of <hi>July,</hi> and a publick one a little after, upon the concluſion of his Marriage with Mademoiſelle.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Juan</hi> had three Fits of a Tertian Ague towards the beginning of <hi>July.</hi> On the thirteenth the Secretary of the Marqueſs <hi>de los Balbazez</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, who brought word that the King had conſented to the Marriage of Mademoiſelle with the King of <hi>Spain:</hi> Nothing is equal to the Joy that he ſhew'd upon this Account, for he had expected the news with the greateſt Impatience. He ordered <hi>Te Deum</hi> to be ſung at our Ladies <hi>d'Atocha,</hi> all the Houſes in the City were illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated with white Wax Tapers, and Bonefires were to be ſeen in every Street. An hundred and fifty Cavaliers of the beſt Families in the Kingdom performed a Maſquerate on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, that conſiſted only of ſome Embroiderie,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0148502701:85"/>
Tiffany Ribbons and Feathers; for they were apparalled in black as they uſed to be, but were not maſqued at all. After this manner they ran all night, every man carrying a Flambeaux in his Hand: All theſe Divertiſements laſted three Days and three Nights. A Courier ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived ſoon after, who brought the Contract of the King's Marriage, this was ſoon communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Queen-Mother, who expreſs'd a great deal of Joy at it. The Ratification was preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſent back, and Bonefires were made as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>While the People did thus endeavour to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs their Zeal to the King, the Servants of the Queen-Mother were buſied in finding out ſome means or other to advance her Return. The Marqueſs <hi>de Villars</hi> had refuſed to follow the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the other Ambaſſadors in the Conduct they uſed towards <hi>Don Juan</hi> upon the occaſion of thoſe new cuſtoms, which they ſuffered him to eſtabliſh; and this ſeemed a favourable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to perſwade the Enemies of the Prince, that Monſieur <hi>de Villars</hi> had ſome ſecret Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which were not favourable to him. They flattered themſelves immediately with the hopes of making him one of their party, and believed it would extreamly ſtrengthen their own ſide if they could once bring him over to them. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Conſideration, the greater Part of the Cortiers applauded him mightily for his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauncy, and made him abundance of Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon that Score. He was reſpected at <hi>Madrid,</hi> and had the good fortune to find out ſeveral of his Friends again, and the Queen-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhewed a particular Eſteem for him. She gave him a very obliging proof of this, when he came to wait upon her at <hi>Toledo</hi>; for after publick Audience was over, ſhe was pleaſed to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0148502701:86"/>
entertain him in private about her own Affairs, and teſtified what an entire Confidence ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in him: But altho ſeveral Propoſal were made to him, to be of a Party againſt the Prince, and beſides his own natural Diſpoſition led him to eſpouſe the Quarrel of thoſe Perſons who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed a Miniſter, whoſe civilities he had no great reaſon to applaud, yet he was of opinion that in this preſent Conjuncture it would be his beſt way to remain Neuter.</p>
            <p>He conſidered ſtill, that the Marriage of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> with Mademoiſelle would bring along with it ſome Agreements that were not to be expected before the Arrival of that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, that it was a ſure unfailing way to oppoſe one Power to another, that this young Princeſs would never ſuffer the Miniſter of <hi>France</hi> to be run down in that Court where ſhe was to become the Miſtreſs and ſole Delight, that it was certain ſhe would link her ſelf to the intereſts of the Queen Mother; that the moſt Chriſtian Queen who loved both the one and the other very affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, would be ſure to give her this in charge before her Departure amongſt the other Counſels, which ſhe was always to obſerve; that their Credit being united together and ſeconded by all thoſe Perſons, that deſired another Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Don Juan</hi> would without queſtion find himſelf obliged to give way. Moſt Perſons reaſoned after the ſame manner upon this Affair, and encouraged one another to ſtand firm againſt the Favourite; they now began to ſpeak thoſe Things aloud which before they were almoſt afraid to mutter in private; they complained of him, and importuned the King to call the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>es home, and openly promoted the Return of the Queen-Mother. <hi>Don Juan</hi> was now more
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0148502701:87"/>
diſquieted than ever: The Appearance only of his fall had prevailed with ſeveral Perſons, who ought to have been his Creatures, to abandon him for good and all; and as for thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, they had neither Authority, nor Merit enough to ſupport him. He could ſcarce find a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Comfort but when he was alone, but this ſort of Conduct does not always afford a man a Sanctuary; for even the Silence, the Retirement, and the infinite Reflections we make are rather apt to perplex and diſturb, than to relieve our Spirits. He was ſtill more afflicted, when he ſaw ſome of his Friends, or at leaſt ſuch as he believed to be ſo, embrace the intereſts that were directly oppoſite to his, and he knew they employed the Confeſſor's credit with the King to bring all theſe matters about.</p>
            <p>I have already told you, that <hi>Don Juan</hi> was the man who cauſed him to come from <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manca,</hi> and after he had advanced him to this Preferment, thought he might ever after have him at his Devotion. Nevertheleſs, whether he had promiſed him nothing, or really broke his word, 'tis certain he quitted the Prince's party, and caballed amongſt his Enemies. Some People pretend that this proceeded from a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Conſcience, but it is impoſſible that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude ſhould ever flow from a good Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. However it was, he obtained for the Princeſs <hi>de Stillano,</hi> who was the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi>'s Daughter, the Return of her Husband. <hi>Don Juan</hi> had abſolutely refuſed it, and found ſo little Credit upon this occaſion, that he was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly afflicted at it: For the thing it ſeems was puſhed ſo far, that the King out of pure Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance to his Confeſſor ſaid, <hi>it ſignifies nothing that</hi> Don Juan <hi>oppoſes it, 'tis enough that I would</hi>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:0148502701:88"/>
               <hi>have it ſo.</hi> Theſe few words very much increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Prince's Melancholy; but as Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes ſeldom come unattended, there happened another Mortification upon the Account of the Duke of <hi>Oſſone,</hi> who was in the number of the Exiles. The Prince had ſent him notice by ſome of his Friends, that he deſired him to throw up his Place of Maſter of the Horſe to the new Queen, which he had lately beſtowed upon him, but he rejected his Propoſal with the greateſt Scorn imaginable. <hi>Don Juan</hi> was mightily enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged at it, and would have baniſhed him farther off, to make him ſenſible of his Power, and of the Affront he had done him in pretending to oppoſe his Intentions: but he was ſo far from ſucceeding in his Project, that he ſaw the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> who hitherto kept fair Meaſures with him, had prevailed with the King to recall the Duke <hi>d'Oſſone.</hi> The Son of the Duke <hi>de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina Celi</hi> had married the Daughter of the Duke <hi>d'Oſſone,</hi> and this occaſioned the great Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip between them. The Pretence was, that it was neceſſary for him to be with the Queen, and the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> having found a favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Opportunity, told the King that he was not a little concerned to ſee a man of the Duke <hi>d'Oſſone</hi>'s Quality, who had the honour to poſſeſs one of the higheſt Offices in the Queen's Houſe, baniſhed ſo far from Court, at a time when all thoſe Perſons that ought to ſerve her, ſhould be making Preparations to meet her. The King conſented to his Return, as likewiſe to the Count <hi>de Monterey</hi>'s, upon Condition that they ſhould neither make nor receive any Viſits at <hi>Madrid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A general Cuſtom ſeldom fails to hold true for any particular Perſons, and 'tis an uſual obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that when we begin to receive any one
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0148502701:89"/>
Misfortune, we ought to expect another. <hi>Don Juan</hi> being perſwaded that he was not happy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be excepted from this invidious Rule, was deſirous to ſtrengthen his Party by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Conſtable of <hi>Caſtile</hi>; but he met with a very unlucky Rub in his way, for having engaged the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> to propoſe an Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation to him, the Conſtable calling to mind the inſupportable Pride wherewith <hi>Don Juan</hi> had formerly treated him, and therefore ſtill looking upon the Prince as his formidable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, anſwered very coldly, that the time was paſt. To encreaſe his troubles, all thoſe that were exiled came into favour, for they took an opportunity to ſolicit their Return whilſt he was ſick, and made ſuch Advantages of that Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, and puſhed matters ſo home, that the King was reſolved to call home the Queen-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. While they were deliberating upon the Conduct, that was to be obſerved in this Affair, the King held a long Converſation with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitor General; he ſent his Confeſſor to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the Duke <hi>de Medina Celï</hi> of the Houſe <hi>de la Cerda,</hi> and the Count <hi>d'Oropeza</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>Braganza</hi> to meet at an oppointed Hour at the Inquiſitors. When they were met, the King ſent them word by the aforementioned Father <hi>Relux</hi> to adviſe him of the beſt Method to remove <hi>Don Juan,</hi> and recall the Queen-Mother. The day was ſpent in Conference, and after all, it was unanimouſly agreed that the King ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the Palace as if he were going out to hunt, and that before his Return he ſhould ſend word to the Prince to withdraw immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately. This Project was not put in Execution, the Prince knew not a ſyllable of the matter, and for want of reſolution and courage the deſign fell.</p>
            <p>On the twenty ſixth of <hi>June,</hi> a Bull-feaſt was
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0148502701:90"/>
kept, where there was very good Sport, at the ſame time the Marqueſs <hi>de Fuentes</hi> got to be made Counſeller of the military Affairs. The King gave Orders to the Gentlemen of his Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, who were to meet the Queen upon the way, to furniſh themſelves with three Suits of Clothes apeice, and two of them were to be after the <hi>French</hi> faſhion.</p>
            <p>Our Ambaſſador made his Entry on the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>August,</hi> and we did not fail to go to ſome of our Friends to behold the Show. 'Tis a Cuſtom there for the King to ſend the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor a certain number of Horſes out of his own Stable both for himſelf and his Attendants, for the Ambaſſadors make their Entry on Horſeback; next morning the <hi>Major Domo</hi> in waiting, the Conductor of the Ambaſſadors and his Deputy accompanied him from his own Houſe to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace. In his publick Audience, which he had of the King, he always ſpoke in <hi>French</hi>; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of his Entry was a long time interrupted by the Opiniatreté of the Ambaſſador of <hi>Malta,</hi> who pretended that his Coach ought immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to follow that of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambaſſador, who was the laſt Ambaſſador of the Chappel, in ſuch manner that he was got before the ſecond Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Marqueſs <hi>de Villars:</hi> But to put an End to the Diſpute, the Conductor of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors was ſent to the Palace, where every thing was adjuſted to the Advantage of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador of <hi>France,</hi> and the Pretenſions of him of <hi>Malta,</hi> who was <hi>Don Diego de Braeamonte,</hi> were adjudged to be ill grounded, ſince the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors of Crowned Heads never gave him the right Hand at their Houſes. After ſome Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces on his ſide, his Coach withdrew; he is the firſt Ambaſſador of <hi>Malta</hi> that ever aſpired to this Honour.</p>

All theſe Ladies went to <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledo</hi> to take their Leave of the Queen-Mother, and at their Return they went ſtrait down to the Palace, where he took Poſſeſſion of thoſe Chambers that were allotted to them. The King preſented a thouſand Piſtoles to every Maid of Honour to bear the expence of their Journey, with a Penſion of a thouſand Ducats.

At the ſame time the Count <hi>de Talara</hi> brought the King a Reſignation of his Office of Maſter of the Horſe, the Averſion between him and the Admiral of <hi>Caſtile</hi> made him unwilling to execute his Orders, and ſince he ſaw himſelf recalled from Baniſhment, he thought it the beſt way to leave the Court.</p>

So great and ſo welcom a Reception made him reſolve not to give the right hand to Ambaſſadors and to the Grandees, which at firſt a little diſpleaſed ſome People, but the Dukes <hi>de Medina Celi, d'Oſſone,</hi> and <hi>Alva,</hi> the Popes Nuncio, and the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambaſſador having made him a Viſit, were pleaſed to ſubmit to the new Regulation he had eſtabliſhed, which ſome others followed after their Example.</p>
            <p>When it was known at <hi>Madrid,</hi> that our King was to ſwear to the Peace at <hi>Fountainbleau</hi> on the laſt day of <hi>August,</hi> the King of <hi>Spain</hi> came about four a clock in the afternoon to the great gilded Hall of the Palace, to perform this Ceremony on his ſide. The Marqueſs <hi>de Villars</hi> came to the Palace, where he was received by the Maſter of the Ceremonies: The Conſtable of <hi>Caſtile</hi> followed by all the <hi>Major Domo</hi>'s re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him at the Gate of the firſt Hall; he paſſed through ſeveral Rooms, each more mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent than the other, and hung with the richeſt Tapiſtry in the world.

The Cardinal <hi>Portocarero</hi> ſat up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Chair of State, the Conſtable of <hi>Caſtile</hi> upon a little low Stool; our Ambaſſador ſeated himſelf upon another Bench, the Patriarch of the <hi>Indies</hi> continued ſtanding: The King came follawed by his Grandees and ſat down, and thoſe whoſe right it was to ſit down and be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, did it. <hi>Don Pedro Colonna</hi> Secretary of State read with a loud Voice the Commiſſion which our King had ſent to the Marqueſs <hi>de Villars</hi> to aſſiſt at this Ceremony in his ſtead. A little Silver Table was ſet before the King, on which a Crucifix and the Goſpel was placed. The King kneeling, ſet his right hand upon the Book, all the while that the Cardinal read aloud the Oath which his Majeſty took to keep Peace with <hi>France.</hi> When this was over, the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador approached and made a Compliment to the King, who briefly anſwered him according to the Cuſtom, and returned preſently to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment.</p>
            <p>All the Court was now filled with Joy: A Maſquerade on Horſeback was kept in the great Court of the Palace; it was divided into two Squadrons which ran againſt one another. Prince <hi>Alexander Farneſe</hi> Brother to the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> led one, and the Duke <hi>de Medina de las Torres</hi> led the other. The King named the Conſtable of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> to be Judges and Arbitrators of the Courſe.</p>
            <p>The Marqueſs <hi>Defiat</hi> arrived at <hi>Madrid</hi> from the part of Monſieur, to make his Compliments to the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> He received him very kindly and as a Perſon of his merit deſerved: he went to <hi>Toledo</hi> to wait upon the Queen-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and came back immediately. On the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0148502701:95"/>
ninth of <hi>August</hi> a Courier from the Marqueſs <hi>de los Balbazez</hi> arrived at <hi>Madrid,</hi> who brought the happy news that the marriage of the King with Mademoiſelle had been ſolemnized at <hi>Fountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleau,</hi> and this gave occaſion to Maſquerades on Horſeback, and the Bonefires that were to be ſeen for three days together.</p>
            <p>All this publick Rejoycing did not in the leaſt diminiſh <hi>Don Juan</hi>'s melancholy; and 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, the great Perplexity of mind he was under very much impaired his Health, and the Vigour of his Conſtitution. He was at a ſtand what Party to take, for as he had too much Bavery ever to think of giving way to his Enemies, ſo his Credit was not ſtrong enough to put him in Capacity of reſiſting them. In this violent Condition, he was ſenſible enough that he ſhould never be able to ſuſtain the Weight of his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, and to ſay the truth, it coſt him his Life at laſt; But great men ſeldom complain when they become the Sport of Fortune, and after their Example <hi>Don Juan</hi> expected his laſt day with the Conſtancy and Steadineſs of a Heroe, His Tertian Ague ſeized him again, and on the ſeventh of <hi>September</hi> he found himſelf ſo extreamly ill, that the Phyſicians acquainted the King that there was but little hopes of his Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. At this News his Majeſty wept, and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified a ſenſible Grief. He ordered Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Portocarero</hi> to go to him and learn what Condition he was in; he appeared but little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, and prepared himſelf for Death like a good Chriſtian and Philoſopher: He comforted all his Friends with a wonderful Preſence of mind, <hi>A Man has lived long enough,</hi> ſaid he to them, <hi>when he dies without having any thiog to reproach him, I mean in Relation to Honour: As for what Concerns my duty to God I have been too defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,</hi>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:0148502701:96"/>
               <hi>and the timeof my Repentance cannot be too long.</hi> He received the Holy <hi>Viaticum,</hi> and the King almoſt every other moment came into his Chamber, teſtifying a great deal of Friendſhip for him, and tenderly complained, that he would abandon him at a Juncture, when his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance was become ſo neceſſary to him. <hi>Don Juan</hi> made his Will, by which he conſtituted the King his Heir, he left almoſt all his Jewels to the young Queen, and the Queen-Mother, and named Cardinal <hi>Portocarero,</hi> the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of <hi>Caſtile</hi> to be his Executors. He like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe gave Order, that as ſoon as ever he was dead, they ſhould remove his Cabinet, which was filled with Papers of great Importance, out of his own Apartment to that of the King. This extream Illneſs of the Prince put ſome Stop to the publick Rejoycings that were reſolved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and particularly to a Bull-feaſt, but howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it did not hinder them from making fine artificial Fireworks in the Court of the Palace; nay he deſired it himſelf, altho' he was troubled with a furious pain in his Head, that might very well be increaſed with the Noiſe of Rockets and Crackers. All this while his Phyſicians, who knew nothing of the profound melancholy wherein he was plunged, puniſhed his body for an Indiſpoſition, that was properly lodged in the mind, and made him ſuffer a ſort of Martyrdom by the ſeveral Torments they inflicted upon him. In fine, this poor Prince died on the ſeventeenth of <hi>September</hi> 1679. on the very ſame day that his Father <hi>Philip</hi> IV. did. He was born in 1626. and abounded with a thouſand good Qualities. A little time after his Birth, his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther received the Habit of a religious Woman from the Hands of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> X. who was

then the Pope's Nuncio to King <hi>Philip</hi> IV. this Action of her retiring out of the World, juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her from abundance of Suſpicions, which Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple entertained upon the Score of her impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Conduct. The King did not acknowledge him till the year 1642. He had the Grand Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory of <hi>Malta</hi> in <hi>Caſtile</hi> beſtowed upon him, and was ſent againſt the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> with the Title of <hi>Generaliſſimo</hi> of the Armies by Sea and Land. After this he reduced the City of <hi>Naples</hi> to its obedience and went to <hi>Flanders</hi> to command the Troops there. He was Governour of the Low Countries, of <hi>Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Charolois</hi>; but he came back to march once more againſt the <hi>Portugueſes.</hi> After the Death of the King his Father, he paſſed his time, as is above-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, at <hi>Conſuegra,</hi> the Ordinary Reſidence of the Grand Prior of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and when the preſent King came to be of Age, he continued near him. On the twentieth his body was carried to the <hi>Eſcurial,</hi> and was interred in the <hi>Pantheon,</hi> for ſo the place is called where they lay the Bodies of the Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> but thoſe of the Princes and Princeſſes of the Royal Family are placed in a Vault which is not far from it; nay they don't lay the Bodies of the Queens of <hi>Spain</hi> in the <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theon</hi> unleſs they have had Children. He left a very beautiful Daughter behind him, whom he had by a Perſon of great Quality. She is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Perſon among the <hi>Carmelites</hi> at <hi>Madrid,</hi> who are called <hi>las Deſcalcas Reales.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt Journey the King made after the Death of <hi>Don Juan</hi> was to go and viſit the Queen-Mother. He parted the very ſame day from <hi>Madrid,</hi> and lay on the way at <hi>Aranjuez,</hi> and arrived the next day at <hi>Toledo.</hi> The Queen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him with great Teſtimonies of Tenderneſs, they mnigled their Tears together as they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0148502701:100"/>
one another, and dined, and afterwards entertained one another a long time in private. All thoſe that accompanied the King, kiſſed her Majeſty's hand; ſo after the day was agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for her to come back to <hi>Madrid,</hi> he left her. We may eaſily believe, that ſhe took but little time to prepare her ſelf for a Journey that was ſo welcome to her. The King parted from <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid</hi> on the twenty ſeventh, he lay again at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranjuez</hi> and the next day he ſet forward to meet the Queen on the way that leads to <hi>Toledo.</hi> As ſoon as they met, he deſired her to come into his Coach that they might diſcourſe in private, and ſo he brought her to <hi>Buen Retiro,</hi> which is one of the King's Houſes ſcituate at the end of the City. There ſhe reſted her ſelf for ſome time, till the Houſe of the Duke <hi>Duzeda</hi> could be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up for her, which it ſeems ſhe choſe to reſide in, becauſe the Palace was not ſpacious enough to lodge the two Queens. It would be an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Piece of Trouble to reckon up all the Perſons of Quality, beſides the vaſt Multitudes of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that accompanied their Majeſties at their Arrival; and indeed this mighty Alteration of Fortune was very remarkable on the Queen-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's ſide. There was an univerſal Joy for her Return in the very ſame City, where but two years ago <hi>Don Juan</hi> was ſeen to enter as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer of his Country, and the Queen to go out like a meer Fugitive under all the weight of the publick Hatred. The King tarried there till e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, and there ſcarce paſſed a day over his Head, from the time he went to meet the Queen firſt on the Road, but he dined with her, and ſtaid a long time in her Company.</p>
            <p>All the new Queens Family were juſt upon the Point of going to meet her; the Dutcheſs
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0148502701:101"/>
               <hi>de Terra Nova</hi> made great Preparations, and ſince every body in a manner envyed her for having ſo advantageous a Poſt, and <hi>Don Juan</hi> her Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector was dead, 'twas commonly believed that ſhe would be obliged to reſign it: But ſhe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw and prevented all this by taking Poſſeſſion of her Apartment in the Palace, from whence it was not ſo eaſie a matter to eject her now, as it would have been before. She departed on the twenty ſixth of <hi>September</hi> with the Marqueſs <hi>d'Aſtorgas,</hi> and the whole Family of the Queen ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Duke <hi>d'Oſſone,</hi> whoſe Equipage could not be got ready, becauſe he was but juſt returned from his Baniſhment.</p>
            <p>But before I carry on theſe <hi>Memoirs</hi> any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I judge it not amiſs to ſpeak a few words of ſome of the Lords that belonged to the Court when I was there. I ſhall particularly enlarge upon thoſe that were of the Council of State, for it will be no ſmall Satisfaction to the Reader to know the Characters of thoſe Perſons, whoſe names he meets ſo frequently. I ſhall not here ſpeak of the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> nor of the Conſtable of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> neither do I pretend to name them according to their Rank and Order, but ſhall only place them as they occur firſt to my Remembrance, and ſhall begin with</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> or <hi>Dalbe,</hi> of the Family of <hi>Toledo,</hi> he has a vaſt Eſtate and a conſiderable Revenue, and yet for all that, is not before hand in the World; he enjoys ſeveral good Places and a large Penſion at Court. He was a witty obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Perſon, and ſhew'd but little kindneſs to the Queen-Mother. He was 67 years old.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Pedro de Arragon</hi> was fomerly known by the name of the Marqueſs <hi>de Pobar,</hi> he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to relieve <hi>Perpignan,</hi> when he was Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the Horſe, but had the ill Luck to fall
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0148502701:102"/>
into the Hands of the <hi>French,</hi> amongſt whom he continued a Priſoner for ſome time. At his Return to <hi>Madrid,</hi> the King made him Governour to the Prince <hi>Don Baltazar</hi> his Son, who died by overheating himſelf, and was afterwards let Blood in vain. The King upon this was enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged againſt <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> baniſhed him. When the King was dead, the Queen Regent called him home, and ſent him Ambaſſador to <hi>Rome.</hi> After this he was made Viceroy of <hi>Naples,</hi> where according to the Cuſtom he heaped a great Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure together, and what is more remarkable, knew how to keep it, for this is not the Genius of that Nation. He was 77 years old.</p>
            <p>The Admiral of <hi>Caſtile</hi> of the Family <hi>d'Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riquez,</hi> deſcended from a Baſtard of the Kings of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> was a great Lord, and better ſhaped than any in the Court: He was tall of Stature and well proportioned, the Air of his Face was great and noble, and he had a world of Wit, was of a gentle eaſie Deportment, and had nothing to trouble him, but only his being 58. years old. He had an excellent Tallent at writing of Verſes, which flowed naturally from him, and in theſe Diverſions he employed himſelf more than in his Domeſtick Affairs. He was born a <hi>Libertine,</hi> and lived private, and could not fix himſelf ſo as to make a regular Court either to the King or the Chief Miniſter. He was of opinion that whatever is done by Conſtraint cannot be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed by all the Favours of Fortune, he commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated himſelf to a very few Perſons, whether it were, becauſe he had too exquiſite and nice a Taſt to accommodate himſelf to all the World, or becauſe he was a Lover of Solitude, which the moſt delicious Gardens and the fineſt Houſe in <hi>Madrid</hi> recommended to him. Formerly he kept ſome Miſtreſſes, for whoſe Sakes he almoſt ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0148502701:103"/>
himſelf. He was Maſter of the Horſe to the King.</p>
            <p>The Marqueſs <hi>d'Aſtorgas</hi> of the Family <hi>d'Ozo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio</hi> was in his time a perſon of the greateſt Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry in the World, and notwithſtanding the Diſadvantage of being 68. years old, continued ſtill to be ſo. He was of a chearful lively Spirit, and talked juſtly and well upon all occaſions. He was Grand Maſter of the young Queens Horſe. His Lady having entertained an impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Jealouſie and Hatred againſt a young beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Woman, for whom he had an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Affection, found an occaſion to kill her, took out her Heart and made a Ragoo of it. When her Husband had eaten part of it, ſhe asked him how he liked it, he anſwered very well. I am much ſurprized at it, ſays ſhe, for 'tis the Heart of your Miſtreſs, and immediately drew out her Head, all bloody as it was, from under her Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thingal, and ſo threw it upon the Table, where he was with ſeveral of his Friends.

            <p>The Duke <hi>d'Oſſone</hi> of the Houſe <hi>de' Giron</hi> was Maſter both of good and bad Qualities, that equally diſtinguiſhed him.

            <p>This digreſſion has cauſed me to interrupt the ſeries of theſe Memoirs, but now to reaſſume my diſcourſe, I muſt inform my Reader, that the good underſtanding which paſſed between the King and the Queen-Mother, occaſioned abundance of people to make their Court to the latter. They looked upon her as a Princeſs, who had aſſumed all her former Authority, for the King was ſtill young, and had need of good counſel, and his Mother being accuſtomed to Govern, was for all ſorts of reaſons more capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to direct him than any one beſides. Nay it was commonly believed, that ſhe would not be diſpleaſed to take the Government again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her hands, and ſo ſome by inclination, and others out of policy endeavoured to get into her favour, in order to obtain ſome place or other under the new Miniſtry, that was going to be formed, as well upon the ſcore of her return, as the arrival of the young Queen.</p>

through which her Majeſty paſſed, to receive her with a reſpect ſuitable to her high rank, and we may ſay ſhe ſo much ſet off the Grandeur of her Birth by her natural beauty, and by her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging and courteous deportment; that all <hi>France</hi> was ſenſibly grieved to loſe her.</p>
            <p>One of the firſt perſons that took the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to ſpeak to the Queen and give her advice was a Religious <hi>Theatin,</hi> called Father <hi>Vintimiglia.</hi> He was born in <hi>Sicily</hi> of an Illuſtrious Family, and was Brother to the Count <hi>de Prade</hi> who happened to be Governour of <hi>Palermo</hi> at the time when that City revolted in the late trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.

He told her, that in order to bring this deſign about, ſhe was to chuſe the Duke <hi>d'Oſſone</hi> to be a member of it, becauſe he was a perſon of conſummate abilities, and beſides had a great zeal for her Majeſty, he took care to reckon himſelf in the number of the Miniſters, and could not forbear to write a Scheme of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; the Memoirs of which he gave to the Duke <hi>d'Harcourt,</hi> to the end that he might preſent them to the Queen, but 'tis very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, he never ſhowed them to her Majeſty.</p>
            <p>The Queen was now advanced as far as St. <hi>John-de-Luz,</hi> and ſhe departed from thence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout One a Clock in the Afternoon on the third of <hi>November,</hi> followed by the Guards <hi>du Corps</hi> of the King.

ſhe had to be ſo near leaving <hi>France.</hi> The Prince <hi>d'Harcourt</hi> placed himſelf at her right hand, the Princeſs <hi>d'Harcourt</hi> at her left, the Mareſhal <hi>de Clerambaut</hi>'s Lady and Madam <hi>de Grance</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind her Chair. Monſieur <hi>de Saintot</hi> went to inform the Marqueſs <hi>d'Aſtorgas</hi> of it, who was <hi>Major Domo</hi> to the Queen. He was in a Boat upon the River, near a little Iſland, which the Treaty of the <hi>Pyranees</hi> has rendred ſince ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and which was joyned to the Queen's Houſe by a Bridge of Communication. The Guards <hi>de Corps</hi> formed themſelves into ſeveral Squadrons in this place. The Marqueſs was waiting for his Orders in this Boat, which was very magnificent, and was prepared on purpoſe to carry her Majeſty over to the other ſide.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as he was informed that the Queen expected him, he ſet foot upon the ground, and fourſcore Perſons, Gentlemen, Pages, or Valets marched on foot before him, he threw himſelf immediately at the feet of the Queen, kiſſed her hand, made her a Complement, got up again, and covered himſelf, without ſtaying for the Queen to ſay any thing to him. The Prince <hi>d Harcourt</hi> covered himſelf likewiſe at the ſame time. The Marqueſs ſpoke to her all the while in <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> and preſented her Majeſty with two Letters from the King and Queen-Mother; but before he gave them, he touched them upon his Forehead, his Eyes, his Mouth, and his Heart, as the faſhion is. The Queen told him ſhe was extreamly glad that the King her Husband had given him the charge of conducting her. After this the old Marqueſs turned himſelf towards the Prince <hi>d'Harcourt,</hi> and made him a Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who anſwered that he had Orders from the King his Maſter to deliver the Queen of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0148502701:116"/>
               <hi>Spain</hi> into his hands. Monſieur <hi>de Chateauneuf</hi> Counſellor of the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> read the Act of Deliverance in <hi>French</hi>; and Don <hi>Alanſon, Carnero,</hi> Secretary of State, read the Act of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception in <hi>Spaniſh.</hi> The Marqueſs preſented ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Perſons of Quality to her Majeſty, who kiſſed her hand kneeling down upon one Knee. The Biſhop of <hi>Pampelune</hi> kiſſed her hand, but did not kneel. The Queen did not preſs to depart, but the Marqueſs informed her that it was high time to march; ſhe immediately aroſe, placing him on her right hand, and a <hi>Menin</hi> of Honour on her left, upon whoſe ſhoulder ſhe leaned, for he was a young Boy, and thus ſhe advanced towards the Bridge. The Dutcheſs <hi>de Terra Nova</hi> met her juſt about the middle, and kiſſed her hand with the Ladies of the Palace that followed her, who threw themſelves all at her Feet. After the Dutcheſs had made her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, ſhe preſented ſeveral <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ladies to the Queen. Monſieur <hi>de Repaire,</hi> Lieutenant of the Kings Guards <hi>du Corps,</hi> who carried the Queens Train, gave it to the Dutcheſs. The Queen entred into the Boat along with her, her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber was glazed all over; and thus being all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone with this old Dame, ſhe caſt her eyes fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently towards that ſide of the Kingdom which ſhe had quitted, and her languiſhing air ſufficiently teſtified by what commotions ſhe was agitated within. Twenty four Seamen placed in two Barks drew the Boat along, and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſe diſcharged their Muſquetoons and Piſtols as ſoon as it began to move, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery of <hi>Fontarabia</hi> anſwered them with a great firing. The Prince and Princeſs <hi>d'Harcourt,</hi> the other Ladies and all the Queens Attendants paſſed over in Boats that were prepared on
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0148502701:117"/>
purpoſe. The Queen ſetting foot upon the Ground towards the evening, found her own Coach, her Litter, and a Chair with abundance of Men in Liveries; ſhe placed her ſelf in her Chair, and twenty Valets on foot lighted the way with long Flambeaux of White Wax: when they came to <hi>Irun, Te Deum</hi> was ſung, and this was the firſt time her Supper was ſerved after the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> faſhion; the repaſt was ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and ſo ill dreſt, that ſhe was extremely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized at it, and could ſcarce eat at all.</p>
            <p>Alas! that a young Princeſs bred up in the moſt magnificent and refined Court in the World ſhould be forced to paſs ſo many ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful melancholy moments. She had always had the liberty hitherto to eat in publick, and it had not been denied to her upon the way; ſhe danced, ſhe rode on Horſeback, ſhe knew and eſteemed thoſe that were her Companions, and they (if I may uſe the expreſſion) adored her. And now ſhe found her ſelf all on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den amongſt perſons whom ſhe knew not; and conſequently could not appear amiable enough to divert her grief, ſhe underſtood ſo very little of their Language, that ſhe could not tell what they meant, or return them any anſwer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out trouble; then beſides all this, the manner wherein they ſerved her appeared ſo ſtrange, and carried ſo ſmall a reſemblance to that of <hi>France,</hi> that ſhe was not a little diſcompoſed at it. All was Ceremony, all was Reſtraint and Affectation; from the very firſt day ſhe appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongſt them, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> expected ſhe ſhould know and do every thing as readily as themſelves, who had been learning them the better part of their lives. They never conſidered the difference between the two Nations, that
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0148502701:118"/>
are oppoſite to one another in every punctilio, but believing that her Majeſty ought immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to be made acquainted with their way of living, which ſhe was religiouſly to obſerve for the reſt of her life, they diſpenſed with her in nothing, ſo that from that time ſhe ſuffered a kind of ſlavery, to which the rigid humour of her <hi>Camarera Major</hi> contributed very much; but the natural ſweetneſs of the Queen's temper, and her prudence made her receive all theſe things, that naturally fatigued and diſpleaſed her, with a world of patience.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs one would have been apt to conclude, that out of meer policy the Dutcheſs <hi>de Terra Nova</hi> ought to have managed the good diſpoſition of the Queen after another manner, eſpecially ſince having no intereſt in her at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ſhe ought by a courteous deportment to have gained her favour, becauſe ſhe had ſo great a number of conſiderable enemies; and the greateſt part of the Court Ladies were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of her place. The Prince who advanced her to this Poſt, was already dead, all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances ſeemed to predict her fall, and ſhe her ſelf was very apprehenſive of it. However ſhe took different meaſures from what any body would have thought ſhe ought to obſerve, for inſtead of ſhewing any complaiſance to her young Miſtreſs, ſhe became a ſpy upon her acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo that by this means ſhe might merit the King's favour. She ſtudied all her inclinations, and her humour, ſhe frequently cauſed ſome <hi>French</hi> Women, that follow'd her to <hi>Madrid</hi> to be entertained, ſhe drew ſtrange conſequences from the ſlighteſt occaſions, and every thing became poyſon in her hands. She likewiſe drew for her ſelf a Plan of the conduct ſhe was to follow,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0148502701:119"/>
and this effectually hindred her from being turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of her Poſt.</p>
            <p>She was not only content with taking theſe remote meaſures to ingratiate her ſelf with the King, but likewiſe was of opinion, that to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure her own intereſts, ſhe was to hinder the young Queen from ever having any friendly correſpondence with the Queen-mother, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing any confidence in her: becauſe her party being abſolutely oppoſite to that of Don <hi>Juan,</hi> it was natural to believe that the firſt ſacrifice ſhe would demand of her Daughter-in-Law, would be the removal of the <hi>Camarera,</hi> who was the Creature of her Enemy. Beſides ſhe could not flatter her ſelf, that the young Queen would refuſe to give the Queen-Mother this proof of her complaiſance, at a conjuncture that would deliver her from a ſort of a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whom ſhe had no great reaſon to love; thus ſhe could not think of a better expedient to ſupport her ſelf, than by poſſeſſing the Queen, <q rend="inline">That the Queen-Mother was her ſecret enemy; that ſhe would oppoſe her in every thing; that ſhe could never forget that ſhe was in part the cauſe that the marriage of the Arch-Dutcheſs her Grand-Daughter was not conſummated with the King her Son; that ſhe was always uneaſy becauſe ſhe had not that aſcendant, as ſhe deſired over the King's affections; that ſhe was reſolved to keep her under a ſubjection that was more befitting a Daughter-in-Law, than the Spouſe of ſo great a Monarch.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To effect this more eaſily, ſhe had inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome perſons that ſtood very near the Queen, who acted their parts well enough. When they firſt took the Liberty to diſcourſe her about this affair, ſhe thought them to be altogether
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0148502701:120"/>
devoted to her ſervice, and their pretended tears ſeem'd to engage for the ſincerity of their apparent zeal, <q rend="inline">What have you loſt Madam, would they ſay to her ſometimes with a mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful air, What have you loſt by the Death of Don <hi>Juan?</hi> What would not he have done to pleaſe you? If it had not been for him the King had married the Arch Dutcheſs, and his breaking off that Match drew abundance of mortal enemies upon him. Now if you could promiſe your ſelf, that the Ambaſſador of <hi>France</hi> would prove faithful to you, you might find ſome conſolation in him, you might fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his advice, and profit your ſelf by his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections; but conſidering his preſent diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Heaven preſerve you, Madam, from ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his Counſel: Alas, he quarrelled with Don <hi>Juan</hi> only upon the Queen Mothers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, he clearly declared himſelf for her in his firſt Embaſſie, and ſhe repoſes an intire confidence in him. Thus your Majeſty can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſhow your ſelf too great a ſtranger to ſuch a Miniſter, that will never go cordially along with you, and who will penetrate into your private ſentiments for no other reaſon, than only to make an ill uſe of them.</q> The Queen was extreamly alarm'd at the things they told her, and knew not which way to determine her ſelf, being ſo young, and having no experience in this new world, where ſhe was acquainted with no body.</p>
            <p>She departed from <hi>Irun,</hi> and lay that night at <hi>Hernani.</hi> The next day ſhe mounted on Horſeback, followed by the Dutcheſs <hi>de Terra Nova,</hi> who made but a ſorry figure upon her Mule; Madam <hi>de Grance</hi> accompanied her. The Marqueſs <hi>d'Aſtorgas,</hi> and the Duke <hi>d'Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſone,</hi>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:0148502701:121"/>
with each a pair of Spectacles upon their Noſe, as is the faſhion of the Grandees, bore their ſhares in the Cavalcade. The Marqueſs placed himſelf next her Majeſty, becauſe ſhe was to be his charge till ſhe ſaw the King; but the Duke pretended a Right to the ſame place, as being Maſter of the Horſe, and ſo took it by force, menacing the Marqueſs very haughtily. This diſpute obliged the Queen to take Coach again. She lay that night at <hi>Toloſitte,</hi> where as ſoon as ſhe was arrived, the Duke <hi>d'Oſſone</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted the Guard, who had abuſed his Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, becauſe he would not ſuffer the Coach of the Marqueſs <hi>d'Aſtorgas</hi> to go before his. This quarrel was renewed upon the diſcharging of their Offices; the Marqueſs pretended, that all the honour of the Queens Reception belonged to him; the Duke maintained that he being Maſter of the Horſe, ought therefore to have all the pre-eminences in her Houſe. To decide the matter, they were forced to write to the King about it, who decided it in favour of the Marqueſs. The Duke not thinking himſelf juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dealt with, continued his pretenſions ſtill, but this obſtinacy drew an Order upon him to return to <hi>Madrid,</hi> with a prohibition to paſs through <hi>Burgos,</hi> where the King was at that time.</p>
            <p>In effect, the King left <hi>Madrid</hi> on the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſecond of <hi>October,</hi> being but ſlenderly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied. The Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> Lord Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain, the Conſtable, and Don <hi>Joſeph de Silva</hi> were all three in his Coach; as for the Admiral of <hi>Caſtile</hi> he did not go along with them, for he pretended that for want of mony he was not in a capacity to fit out any anſwerable equipage; there might indeed be ſomething of truth in this
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0148502701:122"/>
pretence, but it is certain, that his natural lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was the real occaſion, he loved his pleaſure, he ſhunned all trouble, and carefully avoided whatever might make him uneaſie, and this was the true reaſon why he did not meet the King and Queen till they were within a days journey of <hi>Madrid.</hi> The King continued fifteen days at <hi>Burgos,</hi> becauſe he was extreamly troubled with a Cold, in the mean time the Queen advanced forwards by ſmall journeys. She wrote to him ſeveral times, and he anſwered her again. Her Majeſty was forced to ſend to him to demand leave to dine in publick, and ſometime to ride on Horſeback; for thoſe two terrible Creatures the Marqueſs <hi>d'Aſtorgas,</hi> and the <hi>Camerara Major</hi> would not conſent to it, till they had received poſitive Orders. He granted it very freely, and ſhe ſent to him in this place a Watch beſet with Diamonds, and a Cravat with a Knot of a fire colour. He immediately put on the Cravat, and ordered five hundred Piſtols to be given to the Gentleman who brought him the Preſent.</p>
            <p>The Count <hi>d'Altamire,</hi> Grandee of <hi>Spain,</hi> came to <hi>Ognate</hi> to complement the Queen from the King, and preſented her with a Bracelet of Diamonds and Rubies. She arrived on the eleventh to <hi>Victoria,</hi> where a lamentable Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was prepared to Regale her. There it was that ſhe dreſt her ſelf firſt <hi>à l'Eſpagnolle,</hi> and ſhe appeared no leſs beautiful and charming in that, than in her <hi>French</hi> Habit. She went like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to the Great Church, where the Biſhop of <hi>Calahorra</hi> received her at the Gate, and held the Canopy over her, ſhe afterwards was pleaſed to go and ſee a Bull-feaſt in the Market-place, but there was little or no magnificence in the ſight,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0148502701:123"/>
becauſe it was only performed by Citizens. She received in this place a pair of Pendants for the Ears, with Pearls to them of a Pear faſhion, this Preſent was ſent to her from the Queen Mother, and was valued at four hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Livers.</p>
            <p>Monſieur the Ambaſſador of <hi>France</hi> came to wait upon her at <hi>Bribieſca,</hi> and tho' he tarried but a little time with her, and their Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was but ſhort, yet he could very eaſily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that ſhe expreſt a great uneaſineſs, and a particular diſtruſt of him; he could not pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate into the reaſon of it, however he preſently judged that theſe diſpoſitions were not natural to her, he told her ſeveral things that might be ſerviceable to her, he adviſed her not to amuſe her ſelf with the different impreſſions that any perſons might endeavour to make upon her, that ſhe ought to conſider that the greateſt part of thoſe that waited on her only minded their own proper intereſts, that her ſureſt way would be to love the King cordially, and ſo by that means engage him to love her; to unite her ſelf to the Queen Mother, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert all Affairs with her; that ſhe ought to reſt ſatisfied, that that Princeſs had a great kindneſs for her, and that if ſhe took care to make ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble returns, ſhe would find the affections of a true Mother in her. The young Queen was already prepared for this diſcourſe, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly for what concerned the Queen Mother. She had been tampered with upon that point before, but if ſhe had ſeriouſly examined what he ſpoke to her, ſhe had ſoon been made ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as ſhe was a perſon of extraordinary wit, that the Ambaſſador dealt plainly with her, and that whoever perſwaded her to the contrary,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0148502701:124"/>
endeavoured to diſunite her from her real in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts. He took his leave of her and went back to the King at <hi>Burgos,</hi> and during this ſhort time he had the honour to diſcourſe with her, ſhe ſtill entertained him with great coldneſs and indifferency.</p>
            <p>The Prince <hi>d'Harcourt</hi> was advanced as far as <hi>Burgos</hi> to ſalute the King; and ſince the Queen was to come to <hi>Quintanapalla,</hi> which is within three leagues of it, it was generally ſuppoſed that ſhe would come to lie there on the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>November,</hi> and that the Ceremony of the Marriage would be there ſolemnized: But the Marqueſs <hi>de Villars,</hi> having met, as he was coming back, the Patriarch of the <hi>Indies</hi> who was going to meet the Queen it came imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately into his head, that the Marriage might perhaps be conſummated, without his being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of it; this thought made him inquire the news of Don <hi>Geronimo d'Eguya,</hi> Secretary of State, who only told him, that the Queen was expected the next day at <hi>Burgos.</hi> This doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful anſwer, which had nothing poſitive in it, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged our Ambaſſador to inform himſelf ſtill more particularly, and he underſtood at laſt that the King was to go the next day to <hi>Quintanapalla</hi> to celebrate the Marriage. Being aſſured of this, he took care to ſend advice of it to the Prince <hi>d'Harcourt,</hi> and they departed together ſoon enough to be with the Queen before the King arrived thither.</p>
            <p>When they came there, they found it no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult matter to diſcover, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to have the Marriage ſolemnized without them. The <hi>Camerara Major,</hi> who was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of that opinion, and to whom they ſpoke with abundance of honeſt freedom, told them
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0148502701:125"/>
coldly that they were not to aſſiſt at the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and that the King would have no body be there, except only thoſe whoſe preſence was indiſpenſably neceſſary, ſuch as the chief Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and ſome Gentlemen of the Bed-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. The Prinoe <hi>d'Harcourt,</hi> and the Marqueſs <hi>de Villars</hi> anſwered, that the King their Maſter had given them Orders to be preſent at it. She fiercely replied, that the King their Maſter had nothing to do to command in <hi>Spain.</hi> Monſieur <hi>de Villars</hi> told her that the King his Maſter was uſed to command his Ambaſſadors, and that they would obey him in every thing, that if the King was not willing to have him aſſiſt at his Marriage, he ought to ſignify to them by an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in writing that they were not to be there. The <hi>Camerara</hi> raviſhed with joy that ſhe had an opportunity to ſhow her zeal for the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> altho this was a very improper time for it, was ſo far tranſported with the matter, and ſpoke ſeveral things ſo incoherent and fierce, that the Ambaſſadors leſt her and addreſſed themſelves to the Marqueſs <hi>d'Aſtorgas</hi>; he pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently liſtned to them, and told them ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly that he would immediately diſpatch a Gentleman to the King to know his pleaſure herein. This Gentleman found him on the way, and he conſented that the Meſſieurs <hi>d'Harcourt</hi> and <hi>Villars</hi> ſhould aſſiſt at the Ceremony. In ſhort it was occaſioned by the induſtrious dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of ſome perſons who had no inclination to the <hi>French,</hi> that this thought was inſinuated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the King: They were of opinion, that ſo Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt a Marriage ought not to be Celebrated in a poor Village, where there were not above a dozen Houſes, and their <hi>Spaniſh</hi> vanity was ſo extreamly offended at it, as to deſire that the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0148502701:126"/>
Ambaſſadors of ſo great a King might not be witneſſes of ſo great a negligence, not to ſay miſery. And now, to excuſe the matter, they gave out that the King was young and amorous, that every thing that haſtned the pleaſure of ſeeing his Spouſe touched him ſo ſenſibly, that he even forgot the magnificence and grandeur of his Rank; that love alone made up the Honours of his Feaſt, and that the King thought this alone ſufficient. The Queen having paſſed the night at <hi>Quintanapalla,</hi> about ten a clock in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was told that the King was arrived; this news cauſed a ſmall emotion in her, and ſpread a colour upon her Cheeks that made her ſtill appear more beautiful and lovely. She went to receive him in her <hi>Spaniſh</hi> dreſs, and having met him as he was juſt going to enter her Anti-Chamber, ſhe would have thrown her ſelf ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times at his feet, and kiſſed his hand, but he hindred her ſtill, and ſaluted her after the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> faſhion, that is, without kiſſing her, but preſſing her arms cloſe with his two hands, and calling her often <hi>Mireina, Mireina,</hi> my Queen, my Queen. They diſcourſed together a long time, without being able to underſtand one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and this was certainly no little pain to them. Monſieur <hi>Villars,</hi> who perceived it, advanced forward to ſerve as an Interpreter; if he did not ſay every thing they ſaid, it is at leaſt very certain that he ſpoiled nothing of their converſation, and that he mingled a great deal of tenderneſs, and paſſion with it. The King was dreſt <hi>à la Scombergue,</hi> which is properly after the <hi>French</hi> mode, and all his attendants were clad after the ſame manner: For the cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne habits of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſomewhat reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:0148502701:127"/>
The Marqueſs <hi>de Villars</hi> having obſerved that the Gandees of <hi>Spain</hi> took the right hand, ſpoke to the King about it, and repreſented to him, the rank the Marqueſs <hi>de los Balbazez</hi> had given to him at <hi>Fountainbleau,</hi> when the Queen was eſpouſed there. This reaſon prevailed, ſo the King ordered the Ambaſſadors of <hi>France</hi> to be treated after the ſame manner. The Conſtable of <hi>Caſtile</hi> could not be brought to quit his place without ſome trouble; he had ſtill a ſmall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute upon the point, which continued a little time between the Ambaſſador and him, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever civility was ſtill preſerved on both ſides, and the reſt of the Grandees placed themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the King <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>on <hi>Antonio de Benavidez y Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zan,</hi> Patriarch of the <hi>Indies</hi> and Grand Almo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner gave them a ſecond benediction; the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony was performed <hi>incognito</hi> in the Queen's Anti-Chamber: If the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Burgos</hi> had not been indiſpoſed, he had performed this Office. Whilſt Maſs was ſaying they put a Ribbond of black Taffaty about the King and Queen, tied up in a true Lovers knot, and a white Gauze with a Silver Fringe upon the King's Shoulders, and over the Queen's Head. The Dutcheſs <hi>de Terra Nova</hi> held up her Train. When the Ceremony was over, the King and Queen withdrew into a Chamber by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, where they continued two hours alone: They dined afterwards in publick, and parted from thence to go and lie at <hi>Burgos.</hi> There was no body with them in the Coach, and ſince they did underſtand one another but very little, one can ſcarce imagine what they ſaid, however the King appeared very amorous and affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; ſeveral Grandees of <hi>Spain</hi> went before their Majeſties with very ſtately Liveries, and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0148502701:128"/>
accompanied them to the Palace, where a Comedy was acted, and artificial Fireworks were to be ſeen.</p>
            <p>The next day the King came to a rich Abbey of Nuns, that are called <hi>Las Huelgas,</hi> which is not much beyond the Suburbs of <hi>Burgos:</hi> She dined there, and about three a Clock made her entry on Horſeback, being dreſt after the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> mode, but appeared ſo beautiful and charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that ſhe raviſhed the hearts of all the Spectators. Three Grandees marched before her, the Marqueſs <hi>d'Aſtorgas</hi> followed her; a Canopy was carried over her Head, the Old Dutcheſs <hi>de Terra Nova</hi> rode upon a Mule, and the Maids of Honour accompanied her on Horſeback. On the twenty ſecond of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> Prince <hi>d'Harcourt</hi> made his entry, and had Audience of the King and Queen; after Dinner there was a Bull-feaſt, which pleaſed the Queen exceedingly, becauſe the Cavaliers ſhowed extraordinary dexterity and courage in the performance. The day following ſhe ſaw the <hi>Parejas,</hi> that is to ſay, an Horſe-Race, in which nothing is obſervable, but that two men who ſtart together, ride even without going a ſtep one before the other, altho they ride full ſpeed: Sixty Gentlemen clad in Silver Brocard ran after this manner.</p>
            <p>After they had thus ſpent three days in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent pleaſures and diverſions, it was high time to think of going to <hi>Madrid</hi>; moſt of the <hi>French</hi> Gentlemen and Ladies that followed the Queen took leave of her in this place, ſo that the greateſt part of the Houſhold went back to <hi>France</hi>; but this was not done without ſhedding abundance of Tears. The Queen had the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty ſtill to keep with her her two Nurſes, two
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0148502701:129"/>
Women of the Chamber, ſome <hi>Valets de Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre,</hi> a Gentleman to look after five or ſix <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Horſes ſhe had ordered to be brought with her, and ſome other Officers for her Table. She preſented the Prince and Princeſs <hi>d'Harcourt,</hi> the Marſhal <hi>d'Clarembaut</hi>'s Lady, and Madam <hi>de Grance</hi> with her Picture enriched with Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds of different prices, according to the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the perſons to whom ſhe gave them: and the obliging manner wherewith ſhe knew how to accompany her liberalities augmented the price of them exceedingly. They pretend that the Preſent the King made the Prince <hi>d'Harcourt</hi> was worth twenty hundred thouſand Crowns, but it fell much ſhort of it; the Queen got a Penſion of two thouſand Crowns for Madam <hi>de Grance,</hi> which was to be paid her where-ever ſhe lived.</p>
            <p>The Princeſs <hi>d'Harcourt,</hi> and the other La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that followed the Queen went back to <hi>France,</hi> while ſhe and the King took the way to <hi>Madrid,</hi> being both by themſelves, and ſate in the back part of the Coach. Several Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Houſhold went before, and marched by different Roads to avoid an embarras; the Counts <hi>d'Arcos,</hi> and <hi>de Talara,</hi> Don <hi>Joſeph de Silva,</hi> and the Duke <hi>d'Hijar,</hi> Gentlemen of the Chamber, were named by the King to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him in his journey; he came back the very ſame way as he went to <hi>Burgos</hi>; he lay at <hi>Lerma,</hi> at <hi>Aranda,</hi> at St. <hi>Stephen de Gormas,</hi> and at <hi>Guadalajara:</hi> The Nuncio and the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambaſſador came thither to make their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements to the Queen: The next day their Majeſties arrived at <hi>Torrejon,</hi> which is within three leagues of <hi>Madrid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:0148502701:130"/>
All the while that the Court was on the way from <hi>Burgos</hi> to this place, the <hi>Camerara Major</hi> frequently diſcourſed the King in private: She found it no difficult matter to inſinuate thoſe ſentiments into him, that are ſo natural to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and he had for his ſhare been educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a Country where they make no reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Ladies virtue, unleſs they take away from her all opportunities of tranſgreſſing: <q rend="inline">She repreſented to him the ill conſequences of that liberty which the Women are allowed in <hi>France</hi>; that it was abſolutely neceſſary for the Queen to live after the retired manner that thoſe of her ſex obſerve at <hi>Madrid</hi>; that ſhe was young, lively, and of a brillant ſpirit, accuſtomed to the <hi>French</hi> faſhions; that what is innocent in one place may become criminal in another; but if he would be pleaſed to confide in her, ſhe would by her great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence prevent every thing.</q> The King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended her zeal, and gave her ſufficient aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances of his confidence.</p>
            <p>The Queen Mother was arrived at <hi>Torrejon</hi> before the King; ſhe quitted her Apartment to go and meet their Majeſties; when the King ſaw her, he ran to her and embraced her very tenderly; the young Queen advanced forward at the ſame time to kiſs her hand, but the Queen Mother would not ſuffer it: She took her between her Arms, and embraced her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times with great teſtimonies of friendſhip, treating her ſtill by the Name of <hi>her Majeſty</hi>; but the young Queen told her, that ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted her to call her Daughter, and love her as one, and to be perſwaded that ſhe had all thoſe dutiful ſentiments for her, that might make her worthy of this Honour. The King
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0148502701:131"/>
gave her his hand on one ſide, and the Queen Mother on the other; and thus going between them ſhe entred the Palace, that had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to receive them. The Queen Mother perceiving that the Queen had never a Muff, preſented her with her own, about which was a great knot of Diamonds; afterward ſhe took from her a Ribbond that tied ſome of her Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and in exchange put upon her Arm a Brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let that was computed to be worth three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Piſtols. In a word, ſhe ſhowed the Queen all marks of her good inclinations to her, from which ſhe might promiſe her ſelf all happy conſequences. She ſtaid with their Majeſties as long as ſhe could, but went home that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, becauſe this place had not conveneincies enough to receive her. The next day which was the ſecond of <hi>December,</hi> the King and Queen arrived at <hi>Madrid,</hi> in a Coach with the Curtains open, that they might be ſeen by the people. They went down to our Ladies <hi>Dato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha,</hi> where <hi>Te Deum</hi> was ſung, and at night lay at <hi>Buen-Retiro</hi>; the next day a Comedy was acted, and ſome <hi>French</hi> Muſicians, that followed the Queen, prepared ſome <hi>Opera's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Dutcheſs <hi>de Terra Nova</hi> being reſolved to take entirely from the Queen that little liberty that remained to her, and deſiring to continue ſole Miſtreſs of her Majeſty's Will, declared when ſhe was arrived at <hi>Buen-Retiro,</hi> that no body, of what quality or condition ſoever, ſhould ſee the Queen till after ſhe had made her publick Entry. This was a ſorrowful ſtate, and a heavy reſtraint to the young Queen to find her ſelf thus all on a ſudden ſhut up from thoſe perſons, that either might have afforded her ſome conſolation, or diverſion, or uſeful advice.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0148502701:132"/>
She kept her in this ſolitary condition at <hi>Retiro,</hi> without permitting her ſo much as to go out of her Apartment. All the entertainment they regal'd her with, was to ſee long fulſom tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Comedies, little of which they underſtood; and the terrible <hi>Camerara</hi> was inceſſantly before her eyes, with a ſevere affected air, and never laught, but was perpetually finding fault with ſomething or other. She was a profeſſed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to all manner of pleaſure, and ſhe treated her Miſtreſs with as much Authority, as a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneſs would uſe towards a little Girl.</p>
            <p>The Marqueſs <hi>de Villars</hi> knew all that paſſed, and was mightily concerned at it, but it was not time as yet to ſpeak of it. He ſent to the Dutcheſs <hi>de Terra Nova</hi> to know whether he might have leave to ſalute the Queen, ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him juſt as ſhe did all the reſt of the world, that ſhe was not to be ſeen till after the Entry was over. This anſwer he looked upon to be ſo poſitive, that not deſirous to run the riſque of meeting a ſecond refuſal, he was ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to acquieſce: but the Queen being informed of what had happened by ſome of the French Women that ſtill continued with her, could not forbear to acquaint the King with it, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained leave to ſee our Ambaſſador <hi>de ſecreto,</hi> that is to ſay, as a private perſon. She imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately took care to inform him of it; and the Marchioneſs <hi>de Villars</hi> imagining that ſhe might likewiſe have the favour of the ſame priviledge, ſent to the <hi>Camerara Major</hi> to know whether ſhe might be admitted to wait upon the Queen, but ſhe received the ſame anſwer that Monſieur the Ambaſſador had received from her before, ſaying in a few words, ſhe had no order to let her in. The Gentleman that diſcourſed the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0148502701:133"/>
matter with her, ſtill inſiſted that ſhe had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of moment to ſay to her; 'tis all one, ſays the <hi>Camerara,</hi> I'll never ſuffer any new cuſtoms to be introduced within theſe Walls.</p>
            <p>Her Majeſty not knowing what had paſſed between the <hi>Camerara</hi> and the Ambaſſador's Lady, charged her Confeſſor to tell her, that ſhe deſired to ſee her, and that ſhe would extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oblige her by making her a viſit. But ſhe was not in a capacity to obey the Orders ſhe had received, and the Confeſſor being informed what obſtacles ſtood in the way, very fairly gave the Queen an account of all. She was not a little troubled at the ill ſervices the Dutcheſs had done her; and one may be able to judge by theſe few inſtances what an abſolute power that old Lady aſſumed in the Queen's Houſe, and over the Queen's perſon. The Queen Mother, who came every day to <hi>Retiro,</hi> obſerved an air of melancholy in the looks of the young Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, which ſufficiently teſtified her diſquietude within: She eaſily apprehended, that a perſon of her age could not chuſe but be diſguſted at the ſeverity of the <hi>Camerara</hi>; ſo ſhe thought her ſelf obliged to acquaint the King with it, and deſired him that he would be pleaſed to treat her after a more gentle method: She ſucceeded in her Petition, and procured leave for the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs <hi>de Villars</hi> to go and wait upon the Queen, who was introduced into her Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment through that of the Dutcheſs <hi>de Terra No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> who appeared leſs ſavage and ſomewhat more reſpectful to her than ſhe uſed to be. The King according to the cuſtom of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſate in a Chair of State, the two Queens upon two low Stools, and preſently another was brought for the Ambaſſador's Lady. Soon after the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0148502701:134"/>
Queen Mother going out along with the King, ſhe found her ſelf alone with the Queen, who ſeeing ſhe was now at liberty to talk, could not forbear to ſhed ſome Tears, as ſhe acquainted her with the ſorrowful life ſhe led. After ſhe ſomewhat eaſed her ſelf by recounting to her the ſeveral ill uſages that ſo much diſturbed her, the Ambaſſador's Lady did not fail to apply thoſe conſolations ſhe judged expedient for one in her condition. <q rend="inline">She made her ſenſible, that this life, ſo full of conſtraint as it was, and for which ſhe expreſſed ſo great a reluctancy, was yet the very ſame that all the Queens and Inſanta's of <hi>Spain</hi> had ever been accuſtomed to; that there was nothing particular in what ſhe ſuffered, and conſequently was not deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to diſoblige her; that ſhe ought to hope, that when the King was better acquainted with her, and ſaw he had an entire poſſeſſion of her heart, he might out of complaiſance al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her ſome relaxations which hitherto her Predeceſſors had never enjoyed; That ſince the Queen Mother loved her, and cheriſhed her intereſt as her own; ſhe could not do too much to cultivate that friendſhip, which would be ſo advantageous and neceſſary to her; that in the diſtribution of humane things, the greateſt happineſs is always attended with ſome inconveniencies; that ſhe was now elevated to the ſupreameſt Grandeur upon Earth, which Heaven would have her purchaſe at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of a few mortifications, but that her complaiſance to the King and Queen Mother would ſoon deliver her out of them.</q> She likewiſe told her ſeveral things, which in the conduct ſhe was to obſerve towards the reſt of the Court, might aſſiſt her to ſupport the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0148502701:135"/>
and render what followed more agreeable to her.</p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Villars</hi> ſpoke with a great deal of zeal of the Queen Mother; but the young Queen being not as yet diſingaged from thoſe ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with which ſhe had been lately poſſeſſed, looked upon all this diſcourſe as deſigned to miſlead her, and tho ſhe ought to have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that the Ambaſſadreſs could have no other views in what ſhe told her, than only to make her ſenſible of her own true interreſts, yet theſe advices did not at that time make thoſe impreſſions upon her, as one could have wiſhed they had for her good. Her prejudices to the Queen Mother, which were perpetually inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into her, ballanced the confidence ſhe had in Madam <hi>de Villars,</hi> and her mind, that was only accuſtom'd to be entertained with thoſe agreeable things, that uſe to employ perſons of her youth, her temper that was naturally free and lively, diſſipated the application ſhe ought to have made, in order to diſtinguiſh good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels from bad. She knew juſt enough to embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſs her and give her occaſions of being uneaſy, but could not tell how to diſintangle her ſelf, and for want of a ſteady reſolution to free her ſelf from theſe melancholy Ideas, thought it too great a fatigue to ſolve theſe apparent contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. So ſhe continued under this uncertainty without being able to reſcue her ſelf from it, and perhaps by this means loſt a favourable jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture that then offer'd it ſelf to deliver her from the Subjection, under which the Dutcheſs kept her afterwards. The Ambaſſador of <hi>France</hi> ſaw her ſometimes whilſt ſhe continued at <hi>Retiro,</hi> but this was before Company, and beſides the time they allotted him to be with her, was ſo
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0148502701:136"/>
ſhort, that in thoſe general viſits they could diſcourſe of no particular affairs.</p>
            <p>The Queen Mother continued to viſit the Queen often, ſhe deſired her to dreſs herſelf af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the French faſhion, becauſe ſhe never beheld her in that dreſs; ſhe did ſo, and the Queen Mother liked it extremely well. When ſhe was returned to her Palace, which is the Houſe of the Duke <hi>d'Uzeda,</hi> and is one of the fineſt in <hi>Madrid,</hi> the Young Queen ſent her two little Cabinets full of pretty curioſities; ſhe on the other hand procured her by way of exchange the diverſion of going a hunting at <hi>Pardo.</hi> She had not been on Horſeback ſince ſhe came to <hi>Retiro.</hi> The King killed a wild Boar before her, and after that day they went frequently to the Chaſe together.</p>
            <p>The Councils of the Inquiſition, of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> of <hi>Italy,</hi> of <hi>Flanders,</hi> of <hi>Arragon,</hi> of the <hi>Indies,</hi> of War, of the <hi>Finances,</hi> of the Cruſade, and of the Orders, went on New years day to wiſh a happy year to their Majeſties; for this is the Cuſtom in <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Marqueſs <hi>Sera</hi> a <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> offer'd to make the <hi>Naples</hi> Squadron conſiſt of fourteen Gallies, which was never more than ſeven, and not put the King to any expence, provided he would allow him the ſame conditions that the Duke <hi>de Turſis</hi> had at <hi>Genoa.</hi> He had made this propoſal to Don <hi>Juan,</hi> ſome time before his death, who found it to be very advantageous. However their reſolutions are ſo long a taking in <hi>Spain,</hi> and they have ſo ſmall a conſideration for Novelties, of whatſoever uſe they may prove, that it is almoſt impoſſible to introduce one; and this affair it ſeems met with the ſame fortune.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:0148502701:137"/>
The Marqueſs <hi>de los Balbazez</hi> took the Oath of fidelity for his place of Counſellor of State, and Don <hi>Manuel de Lira</hi> did the ſame, for that of Secretary of State in <hi>Italy.</hi> The Duke <hi>d'Oſſone</hi> ſtill expected that they would accommodate the diſpute between him and the Marqueſs <hi>d'A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storgas,</hi> but ſeeing that they ſaid nothing to him about it, he took up a reſolution to go no more to Court, and appeared every day in the City with a great equipage. This is often enough practiſed in <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are ſome people in the world that are never to be diſcountenanc'd by a repulſe, and Father <hi>Vintimiglia</hi> was of this number: Altho' he had received no manner of anſwer to the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial he gave the Prince <hi>d'Harcourt</hi> at <hi>Bayonna</hi> to preſent to the Queen, yet he could not forbear to draw up a ſecond, wherein he regulated all the Monarchy; he intruſted a French Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with it, who promiſed to find out ſome means or other to give the Queen a ſight of it: But whether he ſhow'd it her, or not, 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that <hi>Vintimiglia</hi> by an expreſs Order of the King was baniſhed out of all his Dominions. He betook himſelf to the Ambaſſador of <hi>France,</hi> and nothing more became of the matter.</p>
            <p>'Twas expected that immediately after the King's return ſome ſort of Government would be eſtabliſhed to ſettle affairs in their old courſe, which had been intirely ſuſpended ever ſince the Death of Don <hi>Juan.</hi> Juſt as his Death hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, every thing was making ready for the Journey, which employ'd all the Court, and the King in particular; his Marriage might well enough detain him ſome time from making thoſe applications he ought to uſe in the choice of an able Miniſter: And the world was not at
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0148502701:138"/>
all ſurprized, to find him forget the concerns of the kingdom in general, at a time when he was wholly poſſeſs'd with a Paſſion for his Queen; and had his head full of thoſe agreeable Idea's, which all Lovers amuſe themſelves with. But now when that buſineſs was over, they impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently expected to ſee him take up ſome fixed Reſolutions. The Queen Mother who was newly returned from her Exile thought of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe than how to preſerve her ſelf in the favourable Situation ſhe in was in at preſent, and no body in a manner was ſo intereſted with the King as to be able to pretend to the Miniſtry. Thus the whole government was lodged in the hands of a Monarch, who was but 17 years old, and who was never ſo well verſed in things of leſſer conſequence as to have any juſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in greater Affairs.</p>
            <p>The only man that ſhared the Monarchy with him, was Don <hi>Jeronimo d'Eguya,</hi> who had been Secretary of State four years, to which poſt he arrived from that of a ſimple Commiſſary. His addreſs together with his good fortune render'd him agreeable to the King, who had followed no other Counſel than his, unleſs <hi>d'Eguya</hi> who was fearful of giving it ſometimes, had not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed him to conſult the Conſtable of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> in certain affairs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had no mind to anſwer for every thing himſelf. It is indeed true, that during the Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney nothing of importance was debated upon, for they only buſied themſelves about that in particular, and the Orders that are neceſſary to be given upon ſuch occaſions.</p>
            <p>The Court became now very full; the King's marriage and the return of the Q. Mother had brought together the moſt conſiderable perſons
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0148502701:139"/>
of the Kingdom. Every Family was conſulting about the meaſures that were to advance ſome particular man amongſt them to the Chief Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry: Some wiſhed their Relations had it, others deſired it for their Friends, and abundance of people wiſhed to enjoy it themſelves: Among thoſe that had the juſteſt pretenſions were reckoned the Conſtable of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi:</hi> They were both of them furniſhed with great perſonal qualities, were both of an illuſtrious birth, and conſiderable for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; they poſſeſſed the chief Offices of the Crown, were Counſellors of State, and their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits equally diſtinguiſhed them: But nothing was more oppoſite than theſe two Lords were to one another: An old Spirit of hatred, which they were not able to ſuppreſs, and which they had teſtified in a thouſand Rencounters, increaſed their common emulation; their humors and inclinations were as contrary as night is to day. Several of their common Friends had endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to reconcile them, but their pains were to no purpoſe: They were all ſenſible that if they concerted matters together, they would recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally render good Offices to one another, which might ſerve to advance their Fortune. This was one of the reaſons they uſed to accomodate the matter between them; but ſometimes we meet with averſions that are never to be ſurmounted, and this I have mentioned was of that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> was 45 years old, his Humour ſweet and good natur'd, but too ſlow and careleſs in matters of moment, of an inſinuating agreeable Spirit. He was deſcended of the illuſtrious Houſes of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>de Foix:</hi> he is ſeven times a Grandee of <hi>Spain.</hi> His Wife
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0148502701:140"/>
was Heireſs of the Houſe of <hi>Arragon de Cardonne,</hi> ſhe is very rich on her ſide, as well as he is on his. He was Preſident of the Council of the <hi>Indies, Sommellor du Corps,</hi> that is to ſay, High Chamberlain, he made his Court regularly, and always teſtified a particular zeal for the perſon of the King; and his Majeſty as he never fails upon that point, expreſſed a certain affection for him, which he never ſhow'd to any one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides. This made the world believe, that he ſtood fairer for the Miniſtry than all his Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titors.</p>
            <p>The Conſtable of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> deſcended of the Houſe <hi>de Valaſco,</hi> was 57 years old, and was Maſter of a conſiderable eſtate, nevertheleſs he did not live eaſy amidſt all his wealth; he is the tenth Hereditary Conſtable of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> Dean of the Council of State, and Grand Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the King's Houſhold. His Genius is vaſt, his Abilities and Knowledge are ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, and he was always concern'd in employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, where he acquired experience. The laſt of his Governments was that of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and altho theſe poſts ought to have made him ſociable and familiar, yet he always preſerved ſo ſevere and rigid a character, that it rendred him terrible: acceſs to him is very difficult, and his humour is naturally ſo imperious, that he can never ſubmit. And this is the reaſon why he was embroiled ſo deeply with Don <hi>Juan,</hi> and hindring him from receiving ſeveral favours, which that Prince would otherwiſe have wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly beſtowed upon him, to have brought him over to his own Party. 'Tis true he declared himſelf very violently for the Queen Mother, and this might be one of the principal cauſes, that kept him from being of Don <hi>Juan</hi>'s Faction.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0148502701:141"/>
No body doubted but that the King reſpected him very much, for what the Queen Mother might ſay in favour of him, and the world was perſwaded, that among thoſe perſons, whoſe merits ſhe would recommend to the King, the Conſtable would be the firſt, who beſides this would unqueſtionably find himſelf ſupported by all the party that had been ill treated by Don <hi>Juan,</hi> and by all thoſe that continued ſtill in the Intereſts of the Queen Mother: She was obliged for her own proper Intereſts to procure the Kings ſavour, and the Favourite's place for the Conſtable. But amidſt all theſe flattering ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, he ſeemed to be very indifferent in the matter, whether it were becauſe the ill po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of affairs, and the tender Age of the King, made him apprehend ſome danger to be in the chief poſt, or becauſe he was ſenſible that he had not a proſpect of obtaining it at one ſtep, and ſo was willing to aſcend it by degrees. He ſeem'd to deſire that a Junto were eſtabliſhed for the Government, wherein he wou'd bear his ſhare with the Inquiſitor General and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>de Manſera.</hi> He ſometimes told his Friends that the weight of great affairs aſtoniſhed him, and that he found it a harder matter to adjuſt them, than thoſe perſons who behold them only at a diſtance, can well imagine; and that all his ambition was to contribute what in him lay to the erecting a Junto.</p>
            <p>The Queen Mother was not unwilling to have this project take effect; becauſe this was the way to keep the entire Authority in her own hands; for the Council being compoſed of her creatures, they would in all probability act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to her directions. The Conſtable for his part ſecretly promiſed, that by his conduct
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0148502701:142"/>
and management he would always keep the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hand over the other two, and that thus his Companions would only enable him to bear the publick hatred, in caſe any thing ſhould meet with ill ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>But this Junto, that would lodge all the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the hands of three perſons only, deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the ſame time the expectations of all thoſe that would have it be divided amongſt more, out of a conſideration of their own intereſt: This party deſired to have it full as numerous as it was during the Regency, and would have it compoſed of the Cardinal <hi>Portocarero</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> of Don <hi>Melchior Navarra,</hi> who had been formerly Vice-Chancellor of <hi>Arragon,</hi> of the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> and the other three whom I have mentioned.</p>
            <p>After ſo many different projects, people were ſo well ſatisfied, that the Council at laſt would be only compoſed of the Queen-Mother's Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that the alarm became general to thoſe perſons who had been devoted to Don <hi>Juan,</hi> and were very apprehenſive of the credit of the Queen-Mother, and the advancement of the Conſtable: Several of them aſſembled hereupon, they beheld their ruine in the elevation of the contrary party, and united themſelves to the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> to find protection from him, out of hopes of beholding him made Chief Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter: They conſidered that it would be more advantageous to them to ſee one man made happy, who was ſure to befriend them, than to ſee three happy perſons depending upon one alone, who had juſt reaſons to wiſh them ill.</p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> was of an equal and peaceable temper, which rendred him agreeable to the King. This good fortune, which ſeem'd

particular to himſelf, made him be looked upon by the greater part of the Courtiers as the only man that ought to pretend to this favour, in a Court where the greatneſs of rank and birth is one of the moſt eſſential qualities to recommend a Chief Miniſter. Thoſe that penetrated into the true diſpoſition of the King, ſaw very well that in the midſt of theſe different parties, the Duke could not fail to get the better; but whether it was an effect of his Prudence and Moderation, or whether it was occaſioned by the Intrigues of thoſe perſons that were on the contrary ſide, he advanced but ſlowly. It appears probable, that the greateſt part of his ambition came from his Friends, and that he rather followed the advices they inſpired into him, than his own proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations. <q rend="inline">I deſire the ſame thing that you do, would he ſay to them, but in truth the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity a man abandons to expoſe himſelf to all the murmurs of the people, and to all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick inquietudes, very much moderates the pleaſure that is inſeparable from ſo great a Poſt: and unleſs it were for the ſervice we hereby render to our Maſter, I can't imagine how any man could find any ſatisfaction in a thing that draws ſo many hazards along with it.</q>
            </p>

He ſaw himſelf all on the ſudden made Secretary of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0148502701:146"/>
State, when the Marquis <hi>de Valenzuela,</hi> after the removal of F. <hi>Nitard,</hi> became the Queen-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Favourite, and took away that Office from Don <hi>Pedro Fernandez del Campo,</hi> who did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have himſelf ſupple and ſubmiſſive enough to him; ſo that we may ſay his haughtineſs was the occaſion of his Fall, <hi>Valenzuela</hi> having no reaſon to be content with him, obliged him to quit his Office, and beſtowed it upon <hi>d'Eguya.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He had too freſh an example before his eyes to fall into the ſame fault, and being very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droit, complaiſant, and well enough verſed in diſſimulation, neglected nothing to pleaſe <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zuela</hi> as long as he ſtood upon his feet: but when he ſaw his Fortune declining, and that the Court declared in favour of Don <hi>Juan,</hi> he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently copied after them, and preſented himſelf, during that Miniſtry, by his exemplary Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. He was one of the firſt that eſpouſed his party, and was likewiſe one of the firſt that abandon'd the Prince, when he ſaw his credit began to ſink in the world. Nay ſome time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the end of Don <hi>Juan,</hi> he managed himſelf as he had done before <hi>Valenzuela</hi>'s fall, he entred into a correſpondence with the Queen-Mother, aſſuring her that he would only depend upon her; ſo whether ſhe was really perſwaded of his ſincerity, or had not as yet a fit occaſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move him from his Poſt, ſhe ſuffered him to continue in it without the leaſt moleſtation.</p>
            <p>In all theſe Changes he only held his place by a Commiſſion; but as this furniſhed him with an occaſion to ſee the King perpetually, and to diſcourſe him in private about all affairs, ſo he made uſe of this opportunity to poſſeſs him with a diſtruſt of all thoſe that might with juſtice make pretenſions to his ſavour, nay even of the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0148502701:147"/>
moſt conſiderable Perſons: So that being only a ſimple Secretary of State by a Commiſſion, and in all appearance of a narrow unexperienced Genius, he beheld himſelf in a capacity to bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance at one time two powerful Parties, ſo that neither one nor the other could ſucceed in their affairs, ſo long as he oppoſed them.</p>
            <p>Whatſoever Inclinations the King had for the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> Don <hi>Jeronimo</hi> fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, by awakening him with an Idea of Don <hi>Juan</hi>'s Miniſtry: <q rend="inline">The Slavery he then ſuffered, the Perſecution of the Queen-Mother, ſo many Perſons of quality ill uſed without any occaſion, the Miſery of the People, and many other diſorders that inevitably happen, when the Government is abandoned to the Caprice of one man: On the other hand he repreſented a Junto to him, as a Company of Miniſters that would command every body, and everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly embarras their own affairs by their Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and mutual Diſcords; that it would be a burthen to himſelf, as well as unprofitable to the State; that Junto's might do ſome good under a Minority, but that his Majeſty was too far advanced in Age, to want any Governors; that ſuppoſe he were pleaſed to compoſe one, vet the obligation he had to make the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble one of the number, would involve him in new difficulties; that his temper was haughty and imperious in Authority, and that he was wholly devoted to the Queen-Mother; that ſhe had been accuſtomed to govern, and would eaſily come to be Miſtreſs again, by the help of a Junto compoſed of her own Creatures; that ſince he was married, and had Prudence and Wit ſufficient, he ought to manage himſelf, and that if ever he was prevailed upon to do
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0148502701:148"/>
otherwiſe, he would find himſelf by little and little reduc'd to thoſe ſufferings, from which he deſir'd to free him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is natural for a Young King to deſire to be at large, and independent; ſo whilſt he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued thus in ſuſpence, <hi>Eguya</hi> was Maſter of all affairs: The Confeſſor poſſeſſed the King with the ſame ſentiments to chuſe no Chief Miniſter, upon whom he muſt depend: And the Dutcheſs <hi>deTerra Nova</hi> found herſelf equally concerned to keep off the Queen Mother, a Junto, and a Favourite. During this Interregnum, ſhe had opportunity enough to fix and ſettle herſelf in the King's good opinion, ſhe did not queſtion but if the Q. Mother hapned to be once more Miſtreſs, ſhe would endeavour either by herſelf or by her Creatures to turn her out of the Court; this conſideration obliged her to diſcourſe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently with the King, and her only care was to perſwade him, that he ought to be apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of the Queen Mothers deſigns. She like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe inſpired him with the ſame diſtruſt of the Queen, whoſe Youth and Eaſineſs of Temper made her uncapable of taking ſtrict meaſures: She conſtantly whiſpered ſome diſagreeable things or other into his Ear, that only tended to diſquiet him; but he preſerved ſo great a Love for his Queen, that nothwithſtanding he believed all the Stories this old Beldam told him, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had the leſs affection and tenderneſs for her.</p>
            <p>The Court continued ſtill at <hi>Buen-Retiro,</hi> that is to ſay without <hi>Madrid,</hi> expecting the Queen to make her Entry, after which they were to go and lodge in the Palace; the preparations for her Entry were very long, it was commonly believed for ſome time that the Queen was with Child, but all theſe hopes vaniſhing about the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0148502701:149"/>
beginning of <hi>January</hi> 1680, She made her Entry on the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of the ſame Month; The Queen Mother went in the morning to <hi>Buen-Ritiro,</hi> from whence ſhe parted ſome time after along with the King, they went together to ſee all the ſtreets through which the Queen was to paſs, and ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Counteſs <hi>Dognates</hi> in a Balcony made on purpoſe, and having a Lattice Window gilt all over, the Avenues that led to <hi>Retiro</hi> were all ſhut up, and a prohibition was iſſued out for any Coach to go that way. About eleven the Queen mounted on Horſeback, thoſe that were to go before began to march, and paſſed through a marble Gate, which was but lately built: The Kettle Drums and the Trumpets of the City, in their Habits uſed in theſe Ceremonies, marched at the head of all; after them the Alcaldes of the Court, the Nobility, the Knights of the three Military Orders, the Gentlemen of the King's houſe, the Mayor domo's to the Queen, and the Grandees of <hi>Spain,</hi> followed by great number of Lacquays, whoſe different Liveries of Brocard, and Galloon of Gold and Silver of a mixt colour, made an agreeable diverſity; the Querries of the Queen marched on foot immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately before her: the Count <hi>de Villa Mayana</hi> was on her Right hand, who was her Chief Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Uſher: She was ſurrounded with her Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nins and Pages of Honour (when ſhe walks on foot ſhe always leans upon one of them) the Dutcheſs <hi>de Terra nova</hi> followed her; and Donna <hi>Loura de Alargon</hi> Governante of the Maids of Honour, both of them mounted upon their Mules, and in their Widdows habit; which ſomewhat reſembles that of Religious Women, except that when they are on Horſeback, they wear great Hats on their Heads, which made
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0148502701:150"/>
no leſs terrible a figure than the reſt of their garb. But People ſaw after this with a great deal of pleaſure Donna <hi>Tereſa de Toledo,</hi> Donna <hi>Franciſca Henriquez,</hi> Donna <hi>Maria de Guſman, Joſepha de Figueroa,</hi> and Donna <hi>Manuela de Velaſco,</hi> Maids of Honour to the Queen, all very beautiful and richly dreſt; they were on Horſeback, each of them was accompanied by their Relations, in the midſt of whom they marched: There were ſeveral led Horſes admirably fine, led by Grooms clad in rich Liveries, and the paſſage was ſhut up by the <hi>Guards de la Lancilla.</hi> At the <hi>Prado,</hi> which is one of the moſt agreeable walks in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi> by reaſon of the ſeveral Fountains that water it continually, was to be ſeen a Gallery open on every ſide with one and twenty Arches, there were ſeveral jettings out in it, on which the Arms of the ſeveral Kingdoms under the Dominion of <hi>Spain</hi> were affixed to Pillars that ſupported ſome gilt Statues, which carried Devices in honour of the Queen, with Crowns and Inſcriptions that had a relation to the ſeveral Kingdoms; The Queen found at the end of the Gallery a Triumphal Arch, very magnificent and well deſign'd, through which ſhe entred into the City. The Corrigidor and the Rigidors apparelled in Brocard of Gold, of a red Crimſon colour, with Bonnets and Breeches, ſuch as the antient <hi>Caſtilians</hi> wore, preſented her with the Keys of the City, and with a Canopy which they carried over her head, during the proceſſion: The Streets were adorned with the richeſt Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtries, and the precious Stones that were to be ſeen in the Goldſmiths Row were valued at Eleven Millions. It would take up too much time to deſcribe all the magnificences of that day, I ſhall only content my ſelf to ſay, that the Queen
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0148502701:151"/>
was mounted upon a fine <hi>Andaluzian</hi> Horſe, which in this noble march ſeemed proud to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſo beautiful and great a Princeſs. Her Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit was ſo covered with Embroidery that the Stuff was not to be ſeen; ſhe wore on her Hat white Plumes mixt with red; and a Pearl called there the <hi>Peregrina,</hi> which is as big as a ſmall Catherine Pear, and is of an ineſtimable value, hung below a Claſp of Diamonds with which her Hat was beſet. She wore on her finger the great Diamond of the King, which, as they pretend, ſurpaſſes in beauty any thing, of that nature that was ever ſet in a Ring. But the graceful deportment of the Queen in all her actions, and particularly in the management of her Horſe, and the charms of her perſon made a greater luſtre than all the pretious Stones ſhe wore, altho it is certain that people could ſcarce behold the glittering of them. She made an halt before the Balcony of the Counteſs <hi>Dognate</hi> to ſalute the King, and Queen Mother; they opened the Lattice about 4 broad fingers to ſee her, and the K. taking his Handerchief in his hand, carried it ſeveral times to his Mouth, his Eyes and his Heart, which is the greateſt piece of Gallantry in <hi>Spain.</hi> She went on her Proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and the King with the Queen Mother received her in the Court of the Pailace, he helped her to light off her Horſe, and the other taking her by the hand conducted her to her Apartment, where ſhe embraced her often, telling her that ſhe was ever happy to have ſo amiable a Daughter in Law. That Evening there were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>rious Fireworks, and Illuminations for three nights together; the King next day went to the Royal Chappel, where the Queen was likewiſe in her Chair of State, the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0148502701:152"/>
and Grandees were there according to the Cuſtom, and <hi>Te Deum</hi> was ſung. After dinner the King and Queen went out together, which was the firſt time of their appearing in publick: They were in a Chariot made like a Tiumphal Coach without a Crown upon it, and open on all ſides to ſhew themſelves to the People, they traverſed the great Square before the Palace, and paſſed through ſeveral Streets, where the Balconies were full of Ladies, who mingled their Acclamations with thoſe of the people; the Grandees followed their Majeſties in very rich Coaches, with a great number of Livery men. There were abundance of theſe Lords who for nine days together had nine different Liveries, and each finer than the other; after this manner they went to our Ladies <hi>Datocha,</hi> and it being already night before they returned to the Palace, white wax Tapers were lighted at all the Windows, and the Streets were ſo prettily illuminated, by them, that a man might almoſt ſee from one end of the City to the other. The fineſt ſhow of theſe Lights was at the <hi>Placa Mayor,</hi> which is a very large noble Square, the Houſes are built with five Rows of Balconies one over another; and could reckon above three Thouſand Tapers in all. As ſoon as the King and Queen were arrived there, the Fireworks began. Many other diverſions laſted for ſeveral days; ſometimes their Majeſties went a hunting, at other times to a Comedy, or took a Walk: Sometimes they went to Sup with the Queen Mother, or the Queen Mother came to eat with them at the Palace. All the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies had the Honour to kiſs the Queen's Hand, the Councils and the Grandees com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemented her alſo.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:0148502701:153"/>
Some days after her Entry a Bull-feaſt was kept at <hi>Madrid,</hi> which was the moſt magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of the kind that had been ſeen for a long time. The King and the Queen came to the Great Square about one a Clock in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon: afterwards entred the Duke <hi>de Medina Sidonia,</hi> the Marqueſs <hi>Camaraza</hi> Grandees of <hi>Spain,</hi> Don <hi>Felix de Cordova,</hi> Second Son of the Duke <hi>de Seſſa,</hi> Don <hi>Franciſco Moſcoſo,</hi> and Don <hi>Fernando de Lea,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Cordova,</hi> each of them followed by an hundred Lacqueys, ſome dreſſed after the <hi>Turkiſh,</hi> others ofter the <hi>Grecian</hi> faſhion; and after this manner they repreſented ſeveral Nations. They combated the Bulls with extraordinary dexterity and courage; the Son of the Duke <hi>de Seſſa</hi> had two Horſes killed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him. This ſport is an old remainder of the <hi>Moors,</hi> whoſe Genius and Cuſtoms are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely extinguiſhed in <hi>Spain,</hi> altho they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have been long turned out of it. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſtill ſeem to preſerve ſomething of the barbarity of thoſe people, ſince they do ſo freely expoſe themſelves to the rage of Mad Bulls to divert the Publick. But to ſay the truth, this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation is one of the fineſt things in the world, and nothing can afford ſo agreeable a proſpect, as the place of the Combat, which is prodigiouſly ſpacious, encompaſſed with five ranks of Balconies all equal and regular, and curiouſly ſet out with rich hangings and Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as well as filled with almoſt an infinite number of Spectators.</p>
            <p>The King on the eighteenth of <hi>January</hi> named the Marqueſs <hi>d'Oſſera</hi> to go Vice-Roy <hi>per inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim</hi> of <hi>Sardinia,</hi> becauſe the Count <hi>d'Egmon</hi> was not as yet in a condition to go thither: He named the ſame day the Marqueſs <hi>de Fuentes,</hi>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:0148502701:154"/>
Son to him who had been Ambaſſador in <hi>France,</hi> to go thither in that quality in the room of the Duke <hi>de Giovenazzo,</hi> who from an Envoy to the Court of <hi>Savoy,</hi> was nominated to that of <hi>France,</hi> but it ſeems was at laſt deſtined to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Turin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time the Marqueſs <hi>de Villa Mayna,</hi> Chief Gentleman Uſher to the Queen diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Office of Maſter of the Horſe, in the place of the Duke <hi>d'Oſſone,</hi> who for his ill conduct was prohibited to come to the Palace. The Marqueſs <hi>d'Aſtorgas</hi> took the advantage of his abſence to make his own Court, and altho he had been indiſpoſed, and continued to be ſo ſtill, yet he went every day with five Coaches of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary fineneſs, and a numerous retinue of Livery-men to wait upon the King. The Duke <hi>d'Oſſone</hi> being informed of it reſolved to meet him, and give him ſome affront, ſo he took abundance of people with him, and knowing which way the Marqueſs was to paſs, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his Coachman to drive thither full ſpeed, and to overturn the Marqueſs's Coach, in caſe he was within: It happened he went that day in a Chair, and his Coaches followed him, but the Duke <hi>d'Oſſone</hi>'s Coachman for all that met with him ſo conveniently, that he threw him along in the River: This rencounter made a great noiſe, and did not at all accommodate the affairs of the Duke, which before this were in no good condition.</p>
            <p>Madam, the Conſtable <hi>Colonna</hi>'s Lady, who went out of the Convent, where ſhe ſojourned, to behold the Queens Entry, ſtaid with the Marchioneſs <hi>de los Balbazez</hi> till the fifth of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi> when ſhe was carried away by the King's Order to a Convent ſome leagues off <hi>Madrid.</hi>

'Tis the Cuſtom of <hi>Spain,</hi> that upon all ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn occaſions, whether of Joy or Grief, all the Kingdoms and all the Principalities that depend upon the King, ſend their Deputies to comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment him. Thus Don <hi>Pedro de Salinas y Unda</hi> came in the name of the Principality of <hi>d'Avila,</hi> accompanied with the Duke <hi>de Paſtrane,</hi> and Don <hi>Joſeph de Silva</hi> his Brother, to kiſs the King's hand, and complement him upon the ſcore of his marriage. The Kingdoms of <hi>Naples, Navar, Arragon, Granada,</hi> and divers other places ſent likewiſe. After the King had given them Audience, he took the Queen along with him to a great hunting of the Wild Boar, where they killed abundance of them. The Duke <hi>de Paſtrane,</hi> who exerciſed the Office of Chief Ranger in the abſence of the Marqueſs <hi>de Liche,</hi> conducted the Queen to a place in the Forreſt, that was extreamly pleaſant. Several ſtreams of water ran by the place, and under ſome of the higheſt Trees a Pavilion of Gold Brocard adorned with a Fringe of the ſame, was ſet up. All the Trees were covered with little Apes, Squirrels and Parrots, and a thouſand other Birds that were faſtned to them; young Boys that were dreſt like Fauns and Silvanes, and Girls apparelled like Nymphs and Driades, and Sphep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſes ſerved up a noble Collation to her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, who ſeemed to be at firſt extreamly pleaſed with the entertainment. But altho no body knew what it was that diſquieted her afterwards, ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to be very ſad all the remainder of the day.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Candlemas day</hi> there was a proceſſion in the Galleries of the Palace; the Religious of the <hi>Mendicant Orders,</hi> and all the Eccleſiaſticks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Chappel walked before the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the King, and thoſe of the Queen follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0148502701:156"/>
after. The Grandees of <hi>Spain</hi> marched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Majeſties, the Dutcheſs <hi>de Terra Nova</hi> held up the Queens Train, the Maids of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour came next, and there did not ſeem to be above eighteen or twenty of them: 'Tis not here as in other Holidays where they all wait upon their Soveraign.</p>
            <p>Tho the young Queen changed her place of abode, yet ſhe did not change that ſolitary and diſagreeable life ſhe led at <hi>Buen Retiro,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the guard of the Dutcheſs <hi>de Terra Nova.</hi> She governed her like a Child, and continued ſtill to treat her after a worſe manner, unleſs it were that ſhe was permitted to receive the viſits of ſome Ladies, which oftentimes appeared more tedious to her than even ſolitude it ſelf; not that they wanted wit, for no body can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach them with want of that: But the Queen underſtood but a little of what they ſaid, and beſides could not repoſe that confidence in them, which gives liberty, and life, and ſpirit to Converſation; all was Grandeur, and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and Reverence, and State. Much about this time I had the honour to kiſs her hand, but ſhe could not forbear ſmiling, to ſee me ſo much altered for the worſe by my <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Garb, for unleſs her ſelf alone, I never ſaw a Stranger look well in that Habit. After I had paſſed through her Apartments, which to ſay the truth, were exceeding pretty, I found her in her Cloſet, which was painted and gilded, and ſet out with great Looking Glaſſes faſtned to the ceiling; ſhe ſate upon a little ſquare Stool near the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, making Gold Net Work, mingled with Blew Silk; her Hair was parted in the middle of her Head, which was bare, only one knot of her Hair was curled and plaited with great
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0148502701:157"/>
Pearls, and reached down to her Waſte; ſhe had a Velvet Robe on, of a Roſe Colour, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered with Silver, and had Pendants in her Ears that touched her very Breaſt, and ſo heavy that ſhe gave her ſelf the trouble to take-out one of them that I might paſs my judgment on it, and I was exceedingly ſurprized at it. She ſpoke very little <hi>French</hi> to me, affecting to talk <hi>Spaniſh</hi> before the <hi>Camarera Major.</hi> She order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to ſend her all the Letters I received from <hi>France</hi> which had any news in them, to which I replied, that the news which was ſent to me did not deſerve the conſideration of ſo great a Queen. Ah good God, cryed ſhe, lifting up her Eyes with a charming air, I ſhall never think meanly of any thing that comes out of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which is ſo dear to me. This affection, ſaid I to her, which your Majeſty preſerves for your own Native Country, makes me hope eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, Madam, ſince as I have the happineſs to be one, ſo I have all the inclinations of a good <hi>French</hi> Woman. She anſwered this with her uſual goodneſs, and whiſpered me in <hi>French,</hi> that ſhe would rather ſee me apparalled after the <hi>French</hi> faſhion than that of <hi>Spain.</hi> But, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, ſaid I to her, 'tis a ſacrifice which I have made to the reſpect I have for your Majeſty. Say rather, continued ſhe with a ſmiling air, that the rigid temper of the Dutcheſs has frightned you. She appeared to me ſo very charming that day, that I could not forbear to admire her, for in ſpight of her melancholy ſhe was plump and in good liking, and that contributed to make her ſtill more beautiful and agreeable.</p>
            <p>When I came back to my lodgings, I found my Letters from <hi>France</hi> were arrived; there was one amongſt the reſt, which I ſuppoſed would

pleaſe the Queen; ſo I made all the haſte I could the next morning to carry it to her, but the <hi>Camarera</hi> would not ſuffer me to have the honour of ſeeing the Queen two days together, therefore I was contented to write to the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs, deſiring her to preſent that Letter to the Queen.

All the Court was in a tranſport as ſoon as ſhe appeared, and the majeſty of her ſtature was not a little increaſed by a Train five Ells long, which Mademoiſelle <hi>de Nante</hi> carried. The King drew near to a Table that ſtood againſt the Wall; the Queen was on his left hand, and next af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Monſeignear, Monſieur, Madam, Mademoiſelle <hi>d'Orleans,</hi> Madam the Dutcheſs of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Guiſe,</hi> Monſieur the Prince, and Monſieur the Duke, and Madam the Dutcheſs, the Prince de la Roche <hi>Sur-Yon,</hi> Mademoiſelle <hi>de Bourbon,</hi> the Princeſs <hi>de Carignan,</hi> the Count <hi>de Verman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dois,</hi> the Count <hi>du Maine,</hi> Mademoiſelle <hi>de Nante,</hi> and Mademoiſelle <hi>de Tours,</hi> all placed in a Demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circle about the Table. The Prince <hi>de Conty,</hi> and Mademoiſelle <hi>de Blois</hi> came one after the other with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Demicircle over againſt the Table. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0148502701:159"/>
                     <hi>de Seignelay</hi> drew near to the King, and read the beginning of the Contract with a loud voice, but he had ſcarce read the qualifications, when the King told him 'twas enough, and ſo ſigned the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract. After all the Royal Family had ſigned it the Cardinal <hi>de Bouillon</hi> entred, and advanced forward to the middle of the Chamber; then the Prince <hi>de Conty</hi> and Mademoiſelle <hi>de Blois</hi> approached up to him, and performed the Ceremony of the Betrothing. The Princeſs's Name, as you know, is <hi>Anna Maria,</hi> and the Prince's <hi>Louis Armand</hi>: This Ceremony being over, the King and all the Court went to ſee an <hi>Opera.</hi> Next day the Cardinal <hi>de Bouillon</hi> married this young Prince and beautiful Princeſs in the Chappel of the Old Caſtle in the preſence of the King, the Queen, and all the Court: the King dined with all the Royal Family: at night a Comedy was acted, and after that there was a great Supper, where, without reckoning the Princes and Princeſſes of the Blood, there were fifty Ladies that ſate at one Table, which was ſerved with three ſervices of two hundred diſhes each. The Cardinal <hi>Bouillon</hi> bleſſed the Bed, the King gave the Shift to the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> and the Queen to the Princeſs. Next morning their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties went to ſee her at her Apartment in the New Caſtle. The King has given her the Dutchy <hi>de Vaujour,</hi> a Million of mony in hand, a Penſion of a hundred thouſand Livers, and abundance of Jewels; to the Prince <hi>de Conty</hi> fifty thouſand Crowns in hand, and a Penſion of twenty thouſand to the Prince <hi>de la Roche Sur-Yon.</hi>

            <p>The Queen Mother had given all imaginable aſſiſtance to the Queen of <hi>Spain,</hi> to deliver her from part of her troubles, if ſhe could have cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0148502701:160"/>
her ſelf of thoſe ſuſpicions with which ſome people had poſſeſt her againſt her; but ſhe unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily imagining, that the other ſtill regretted the Arch-Dutcheſs, and would have been glad to ſee her in her place, that opinion made her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly diſtruſtful: and the Queen Mother who found nothing of that openneſs of heart and freedom as ſhe deſired, was likewiſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for her part: for in effect, ſhe loved her tenderly, and was ready to give her all poſſible teſtimonies of her affection.</p>
            <p>The Ambaſſador of <hi>France,</hi> his Lady, and the Confeſſor often reminded the Queen of that conduct ſhe was to obſerve, if ſhe intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be happy. <q rend="inline">They told her, that ſhe ought to give her ſelf intirely up to the Queen her Mother in Law out of a principle of Duty, and Gratitude for the friendſhip ſhe ſhowed her, as out of a conſideration of her own proper intereſts: they repreſented to her, that the Queen Mother ought not to be ſuſpected by her, and that altho the Arch-Dutcheſs was her Grand Daughter, yet ſhe had received ſuch few tokens and aſſurances of friendſhip from the Emperour during her diſgrace, that ſhe was too ſenſible ever to forget it: that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of <hi>France</hi> towards her was directly oppoſite to this, that there ſhe had been pitied and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that her Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty had over preſerved a ſtrict correſpondence and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with her, and that the Queen Mother knew well enough that ſhe could not by any returns oblige the Queen of <hi>France</hi> more, than by ſhowing back all that kindneſs to the young Queen of <hi>Spain</hi>; that ſhe had all the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in her, which could engage her heart; that beſides this ſhe hoped to ſee her give an
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0148502701:161"/>
Heir to the Crown, that this was neceſſary for the good of <hi>Spain</hi>; that the melancholy humour, to which ſhe abandoned her ſelf, might hinder her from having one; that they ought to concert all their affairs together, in order to poſſeſs the good graces and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the King; that it was natural to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, he would divide his power between his Mother and his Queen, rather than beſtow it upon a Favourite, who would think of ſerving him no longer than his Family reaped advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by it; whereas the Souls of Sovereigns, having ſomething in them that was more noble and great, than thoſe of private perſons, the motives of Intereſt would never be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to influence two Queens, ſo much as they would a Chief Miniſter; that in fine there ought to be no ſeparation between them, but that they muſt begin with the union of their hearts.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Queen reliſhed theſe reaſons, and found them plauſible enough, but for all that ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſed all on a ſudden into her old diſtruſt, into which the different things that had been ſaid to her did caſt her anew: Beſides the extream trouble ſhe ſuffered from the rigid conduct of the Dutcheſs <hi>de Terra Nova</hi>; ſhe found her ſo abſolute and inflexible that ſhe began to fear her, to which the tenderneſs of her youth, her want of experience, and her natural ſweetneſs contributed not a little, ſo that ſhe could not open her ſelf to the Queen-Mother, when ſhe conſidered, that if ſhe did not really love her, but would make invidious reflections upon what ſhe ſaid, this would be the way to throw her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to new inconveniencies; ſo that notwithſtanding the deſire ſhe had to ſpeak to her, ſhe was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0148502701:162"/>
ſilent in her company. The Queen-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perceived it well enough, yet for all that ſhe continued to viſit her almoſt every day, and ſent her preſents from time to time.</p>
            <p>At laſt the young Queen being entirely van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed by all theſe demonſtrations of amity, reſolved to ſubmit her ſelf wholly to her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections. They had a long conference together, where they took thoſe meaſures which they judged were neceſſary to promote their common ſatisfaction. After this the Queen Mother ſpoke to the King, but found him in a cold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved humour, ſo ſhe made him no diſcoveries of any thing, but took her opportunity to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, imagining with her ſelf that her Son would be obliged to come after her; and that the world might take leſs notice of this alteration, ſhe gave out that ſhe only deſired to live eaſy, and that ſhe preferred her own repoſe to all other conſiderations whatſoever: She talked af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this rate before ſeveral perſons, in whom ſhe repoſed no ordinary confidence, altho at the bottom ſhe was clearly of a different opinion.</p>
            <p>The Conſtable was the firſt man that was aware of this alteration, and was one of thoſe who were mightily troubled at it. He eaſily ſaw that the Queen Mother was leaving all thoughts of advancing him, and as he had his own particular views, ſo he uſed all the means in the world to effect his deſigns. In fine, he joined intereſts with the <hi>Camarera major,</hi> Don <hi>Jeronimo d'Eguya,</hi> and the King's Confeſſor, who brought the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> into the ſame confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy: the deſign of theſe three laſt was to ſet up the Conſtable againſt the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> whoſe favour with the King increaſed, as they thought, very faſt, and this gave them vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0148502701:163"/>
jealouſies of him. The Conſtable for his part endeavoured to gain by them what they deſigned to make the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> loſe; his Emiſſaries began to promote the affair with very favourable appearances, but after they had ſeriouſly reflected upon the imperious humour of the Conſtable. <q rend="inline">He is ſo arrogant and haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſaid they, that he would rather ruin every man of us, than ever be brought to own that he was obliged to us for his e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Don <hi>Jeronimo d'Eguya,</hi> who thought of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but how to ballance the credit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap>ect their reflections. He mentioned them almoſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, and endeavoured to make them more ſtrong if it were poſſible, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound it would be a great deal more advantageous to him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the ſame condition, than to ſee himſelf ſubjected to a new dependance, and this reaſon obliged him to inſpire the King with an averſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and jealouſie for the Conſtable; ſo that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of doing him any ſervice as he promiſed, he did him underhand all the ill offices imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>When our own particular intereſt lies at ſtake, and we are purſuing the dictates of our ambition, we are ſo clear-ſighted, that it is a difficult matter for any one to deceive us long. We penetrate even into the moſt ſecret thoughts of him that calls himſelf our friend, and eaſily find out whether he doth us good or ill. Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuant to this maxim, the Conſtable ſoon percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved how well he was ſerved by his friends, and what deſigns each of them drove in particular. It is no difficult matter to imagine how a perſon
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0148502701:164"/>
of his temper, as I have already deſcribed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented this uſage, and his uneaſineſs to be ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e was ſo much the more violent becauſe he ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd it for ſome time before he let it break out.</p>
            <p>Don <hi>Jeronimo de Eguya</hi> was the firſt perſon whom he attacked. Having repreſented to them one day in a full Council, and that with the greateſt fierceneſs in the world, how all affairs went from bad to worſe, he added, that no body ought to be ſurprized to find it ſo, ſince <hi>d'Eguya,</hi> who pretended to manage every thing, had neither Judgment, nor Experience, nor Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, and that he ought to be confined to the Duties of his Poſt, without medling with thoſe things that had no relation at all to it. When he had ended his diſcourſe, Don <hi>Manuel de Lira,</hi> Secretary of State of the Council of <hi>Italy,</hi> who was of the Conſtable's Faction, preſented to them at the ſame time a large memorial, in which he laid open the vaſt prejudice which the State of Affairs received from the ill conduct of <hi>de Eguya,</hi> and moſt of them there had been well enough ſatisfied, if theſe complaints had obliged the King to remove him.</p>
            <p>Don <hi>Manuel de Lira</hi> did not act only out of Complaiſance to the Conſtable but had his own private ends. He imagined that if <hi>d'Eguya</hi> were once turned out of his Poſt, he might perhaps ſucceed him in it. Now nothing animates a man's zeal in any affair, more than the proſpect of ſome advantage or other to be gained by it. However this ſame buſineſs did not meet with that ſucceſs which he and the Conſtable propoſed to themſelves, ſo after long conſideration the Conſtable was obliged to come back to the Queen Mother, and importune her to appear in
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0148502701:165"/>
favour of him. He repreſented to her, <q rend="inline">That if the chief Miniſter was not one of her party, her repoſe would not be of long continuance; that the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> ſtood very fair for it, and altho he advanced inſenſibly, yet it was probable he would ſoon find himſelf poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of a place where he would make his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſeverely feel the weight of his Indignation; that in ſpight of Politicks, to which he pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he would not fail to ſet up the Preſident of <hi>Caſtile</hi> againſt her, who was a Creature of Don <hi>Juan,</hi> and always ready to execute thoſe reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that had lodged in his breaſt ſo long; that this Duke was the very perſon who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had the hardineſs to carry her the Order for her Exile; that he ſeem'd at that time to rejoyce at her misfortunes and perplexities: that if ever he came to be Favourite, ſhe would find him to be a conſtant rub in her way, and that this conjecture perhaps was not ill ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſince the Duke ſtill poſſeſſed all the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Don <hi>Juan.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The Queen Mother was alarmed at what the Conſtable repreſented to her, and gave him her word to act vigorouſly in his behalf; but the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> being advertiſed of it, was reſolved to prevent the blow, and judged it the beſt expedient to ſoften the Spirit of the Queen Mother, by making a profound Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to her. In fine he went to her, and told her, <q rend="inline">That he was reſolved to be oblig'd to her for all the King's favours, and deſired to depend upon her out of an obligation of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, as he had done a long time ago out of Duty and Inclination; that he humbly begged of her to do him the juſtice as to believe, that his Heart, his Birth, and his Fortune, were too
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0148502701:166"/>
great ever to ſuffer him to be one of Don <hi>Juan</hi>'s Creatures; that he would never receive that title but from his own Maſter, and that the Party muſt wear a Crown who commanded the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi>; that altho he had declared himſelf for the Preſident of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> yet it was not out of a Conſideration of Don <hi>Juan,</hi> but the King's Service, and he was ready to abandon his Intereſt at any time, having no particular engagements of Friendſhip to him; and that if he appeared in this affair, it was only done with a deſign to defend the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the King, which the Nuncio had a mind to invade in the conduct which he uſed towards the Preſident.</q> The Queen Mother anſwered him, that ſhe did not without a great ſatisfaction, believe what he ſaid to be true, that ſhe had a great eſteem for him, and would not fail to give him convincing proofs of it in a ſhort time.</p>
            <p>The Conſtable being informed on his ſide, that Queen Mother had very favourably receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Submiſſion of the Duke, whether out of a Spirit of kindneſs, or indifference to the choice the King might make of a Chief Miniſter, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired at laſt of ſeeing himſelf ſucceed in any of his projects, either of the Junto whereof he pretended to be a Member it one were erected, or in the place of Favourite which he could have deſired rather to fill alone. He reſolved to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſomething at leaſt of the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> by yielding up that Poſt with a good grace, when he was in a capacity to diſpute it with him ſtill.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, he laid hold of the firſt opportunity he could find, to tell the King that no Perſon was fitter to ſerve his Majeſty, and preſerve
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0148502701:167"/>
the Government in good order, than the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi.</hi> He beſtowed wonderful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations upon him for the good conduct he had ever uſed; The free unconſtrained manner wherein he ſpoke all this, was exceeding re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, eſpecially in a man of the Conſtables haughty Temper, who, as the world imagined, would dye a thouſand times, rather than offer this violence inwardly to himſelf: But people at laſt believed that he deſign'd to render himſelf agreeable to the King, by commending a man, for whom his Majeſty teſtified ſo great an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination. After all, it muſt be confeſſed that he ſhowed a generoſity, which is not common, in treating his declared Enemy after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>It cannot be eaſily imagin'd, what a great detriment the Republick received by theſe Factions of the Courtiers, and the King's Irreſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to take or not to take a Chief Miniſter. Nothing was concluded, nothing was done; a Spirit of Lethargy ſeemed to be predominant at Court, which helped to increaſe thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities, under which the Kingdom laboured before. Every body languiſhed to ſee what would be the ſucceſs of the ſmalleſt matters; and buſineſs that had been carried into the Council, tarried there whole years, nay things that went directly into the King's hands were diſpatched never the ſooner. Thus no one knew what Party to take, or where to addreſs himſelf.</p>
            <p>Our Ambaſſador who promiſed himſelf to find a better treatment than he had met with a long while, and which he dexterouſly diſſembled in expectation of the Queen's arrival, perceived at laſt that they deſigned to ſatisfie him no
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0148502701:168"/>
better, than the other Miniſters, who made their Complaints. Above five Months were paſſed ſince he demanded Juſtice for ſome vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of the Peace that were lately committed as well by the Governors of the Provinces, as by the taking of ſeveral Veſſels, and the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of others. But at the time when he was urgent to have a poſitive anſwer, he received a new injury by the inſolence of an <note n="a" place="bottom">Who is a kind of a Provoſt or Judge.</note>Alcade, and ſeveral <note n="b" place="bottom">Theſe are Serjeants and Bayliffs.</note>Alguazils who paſſed before his Houſe, which was never done at <hi>Madrid,</hi> in the quarter belonging to an Ambaſſador. He was extreamly ſurprized at it, but was ſo far from receiving the ſatisfaction that was due to him for this affront, that they told him his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty had given Order that his quarter ſhould be no longer exempt. This Reſolution ſo much the more diſguſted him, becauſe it affected only himſelf, and all the other Ambaſſadors enjoyed their Priviledges as formerly. Not but that they had ſeveral other complaints upon their Hands, as for example, the Envoy from the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> made a great noiſe becauſe they had amuſed him a long time with ſpecious promiſes that had no effect at all; they ow'd his Maſter a great Sum of Money, he demanded the payment of it, but they ſhifted him off from time to time, ſo that at laſt he perceived that they neither had the power nor inclination to ſatisfie him. The Nuncio did not ſeem to be leſs diſguſted for his part, becauſe he ſaw the Preſident of <hi>Caſtile</hi> keep his Place and continue ſtill in Favour, altho
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0148502701:169"/>
the Pope had declared him ſuſpended, and he himſelf omitted no application to have juſtice done upon him.</p>
            <p>In the mean time they wanted mony to raiſe four <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Regiments that were deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be ſent to <hi>Milain,</hi> becauſe they apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome motion from the Court of <hi>France,</hi> but it was almoſt impoſſible to find any funds, and beſides this the Silver that came from the <hi>Indies</hi> in the <hi>Flota</hi> was ſo ſuddenly gone and with ſo little order, that no body knew what was become of it, ſo that it was a difficult matter to ſend any returns into <hi>Flanders,</hi> or other places, where there was occaſion. Thoſe that uſed to advance mony upon theſe ſorts of occaſions, would now do nothing at all, they were all of them drained, and the neceſſities were generally ſo great, that they knew not where to take up mony to defray the ordinary expences of the King and Queens Houſe. This proceeded in part from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order of the mony; a Piſtole which ought to go for no more than fourty eight <hi>Reals de Vellon,</hi> was raiſed up to a hundred and ten; and the Patacoons that are only worth twelve <hi>Reals</hi> went at the rate of thirty. The occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it was this, a great part of the <hi>Reals de Vellon,</hi> that are of Copper, were bad, and the common cuſtom made them paſs as well in commerce, as if they had been good. But at laſt they were called in all on the ſudden, by reaſon of the exceſſive price a Piſtole was raiſed to, and 'tis impoſſible to recount the diſorders and inconveniences that attended this new Regulation. The Court was of opinion in the month of <hi>Februrary</hi> 1680. that there was a neceſſity to find out ſome remedy or other
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0148502701:170"/>
ſuddenly for it; ſo a Piſtole from a hundred and ten <hi>Reals,</hi> was levelled to fourty eight, the Patacoons to twelve, and the other mony was ſo confounded one with the other, that it was reduced to the eighth part of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary value. There was no body almoſt but loſt more or leſs upon the account of this new Regulation, and accordingly felt it; that which before the ſinking the value of the mony was worth fourty <hi>Reals,</hi> which make four Livers of <hi>French</hi> mony, ſince the reducing of it, was worth a hundred and ten <hi>Reals,</hi> which is ten Livers of our mony; ſo that what Commodities a man could buy on <hi>Monday</hi> for fifty Sous, went on the <hi>Tueſday</hi> for above a third part more; and the Debtor, who, it may be, on <hi>Saturday</hi> owed twenty thouſand <hi>Reals de Vellon,</hi> which made but two hundred Piſtoles, found to his ſorrow the next day after that he owed near five hundred Piſtoles. This ruined a great number of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and cauſed a mighty dejection in the ſpirits of the people; for every thing a man has occaſion to buy, is dearer by much in <hi>Madrid</hi> than any where elſe, becauſe they are brought a great way off, and there are few or no Manufactures at all in that part of the Country. A kind of a mutiny happened at <hi>Toledo,</hi> becauſe after this ſinking the value of mony, no care was taken to regulate the price of Proviſions, for which they paid exceſſive rates. It is ſtill to be noted, that the Civil Government in <hi>Spain</hi> is managed but after a very ſorry manner, and that the ſlow lazy humour of thoſe perſons, who might, if they pleaſed, correct the ill conduct of others, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes exceedingly to the publick loſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:0148502701:171"/>
All theſe diſorders and continual complaints, which made a noiſe from all quarters, began at laſt to ſhake and undermine Don <hi>Jeronimo d'Eguya.</hi> He knew very well, that the Poſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he ſtood, was tickliſh and dangerous, and that after all his endeavours to diſguſt the world, in caſe he remedied nothing, the oblige maledi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and hatred would fall upon the Favourite. The preſent ill ſtate of affairs was attributed to his ill conduct, ſo he thought within himſelf, that he could not too ſoon deliver himſelf from the torrent of the popular fury, and therefore reſolved to omit nothing, whereby he might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the King to chooſe a Chief Miniſter. The conſideration of his own intereſt ſoon determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him to act vigorouſly in favour of the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> he knew the King had a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular affection for him, and beſides he perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded himſelf, that when the Duke was informed what good offices he had done him, he would maintain him ſtill in his Poſt, as well out of a principle of acknowledgment, as for the great ſervices he might do him in theſe affairs, ſince he had managed them for ſo long a time, and conſequently was in a capacity to furniſh him with ſome neceſſary lights, which all thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that newly enter into the Government are altogether unacquainted with. And then he knew the natural ſweetneſs of the Duke's temper would never permit him to turn him out of his place, and he was certain that as long as he continued in it, he could manage the King's favour, the functions of his place giving him opportunity to approach near the King's perſon very often.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Camarera Major,</hi> and his Majeſty's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor had each of them particular deſigns in their
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0148502701:172"/>
head, however they were both agreed as to the Duke's advancement, ſo that all the world con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring with the favourable diſpoſitions which the King had for him, he ſigned a Decree (that is the uſual term with them in <hi>Spain</hi>) wherein he declared the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> to be Chief Miniſter. He immediately commanded Father <hi>Relux</hi> to carry it him, who came to his Houſe about ten a Clock at night on the twenty firſt of <hi>February</hi> 1680, and acquainted him with the good news.</p>
            <p>No body had any reaſon to be ſurprized at the Duke's elevation. It ſeems he had promiſed himſelf the Place ſome time before, whether it were becauſe the King gave him his promiſe, or that ſome outward appearances aſſured him of it.</p>
            <p>However it was, it was agreed upon by all hands at Court, that the King could not have made a better choice. He was a Perſon in whom all good qualities were to be found; his agreeable Converſation, his obliging Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, his noble and generous Deportment, his free eaſie Temper, made him beloved by all the world: People only wondred, that being ſo great a Lord as he was, he would ſacrifice his repoſe to the Adminiſtration of Affairs, that were then in a miſerable condition. They could ſcarce imagine (and perhaps he was of the ſame opinion himſelf) how he could ever be able to remedy evils of ſo inveterate a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity. Before he could effect this, he muſt in all appearance make an intire Change in the ordering of the Monarchy; but this was an impracticable deſign, and impoſſible to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:0148502701:173"/>
As ſoon as the Choice his Majeſty had made in favour of the Duke, came to be publickly known; all Perſons that were of any Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty went to complement him, as well the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of foreign Princes, as the Grandees of <hi>Spain.</hi> The next day being accompanied by all his Friends and Relations, he repaired to Court to kiſs his Majeſty's hand, and thank him moſt humbly for all his great favours. On the following days he received viſits in his Bed, pretending a ſlight indiſpoſition to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt himſelf from the fatigue of Ceremonies. His Apartment and Furniture were extreamly magnificent, but it is an odd ſight to ſee a <hi>Spaniard</hi> in his Bed of State, becauſe they wear no Morning-Gowns here, but only their <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilia</hi> and black Cloaks, and have their Hats on, or elſe are bare-headed; for the Men as well as the Women wear no Caps: He had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the place of <hi>Sumiller de Corps, i. e.</hi> Lord-Chamberlian for a long time, and in this Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity he was the only Perſon that commanded in the King's Chamber, and lay there.</p>
            <p>He did not delay to give publick Audience in the Hall, which they call the <hi>Rubis,</hi> and is the place where the Council of State uſes to aſſemble; 'tis under the King's Apartment. Here it was that the Duke received the viſit of the Nuncio and the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambaſſador; they did not ſeem to be pleaſed at the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner wherein the Chairs were diſpoſed, becauſe it could not abſolutely be determined whether either of them or he had the Chief Place of Honour. Beſides this, he only reconduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to the middle of the Hall of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. They acquainted the Marqueſs <hi>de Villars</hi> with it, who told them that he had deſigned
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0148502701:174"/>
to make that viſit along with them, becauſe the Ambaſſadors of the Chappel generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit themſelves of theſe ſorts of devoirs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, but that he was not diſpleaſed with himſelf for not being there, ſince he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to take direction by the fault they had committed; and that he would not neglect, as they did, to uſe all neceſſary precautions about the Step, Place and Rank, and would be aſſured both of the one and the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he performed that Ceremony. In ſhort, he ſent to the Duke to know whether he would not receive him, as Don <hi>Louis de Haro</hi> uſed to receive the Ambaſſadors of <hi>France</hi>; he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately agreed to it, and that there might be no miſtakes committed, the places were marked out, and every thing was adjuſted before the day of Audience. The other Ambaſſadors were concerned at the overſight they had committed, and by this viſit of our Ambaſſador, regulated thoſe they continued to make to the Chief Miniſter.</p>
            <p>The Count <hi>de Monterey</hi> kiſſed the King's hand and the Queen's, he complemented them from the part of the City of St. <hi>Jago de Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stella,</hi> the Marqueſs <hi>d'Aſtorgas</hi> did the ſame from the City of <hi>Avila.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About this time Don <hi>Franciſco d'Agourto</hi> was nominated by the King to be Maſter of the Camp-General of the Cavalry. The Envoy extraordinary from <hi>England</hi> ſurprized all the Court by the ſtrict Prohibition he gave his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticks not to ſuffer any Eccleſiaſticks or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious to come within his doors.</p>
            <p>The young Queen was ſo taken up with the diverſions of the Carnaval, that ſhe had ſcarce opportunity to perceive that this was a
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0148502701:175"/>
ſet time of mirth and jollity: Her beſt days were ſpent in hunting with the King, and the three laſt days of the Carnaval there was a Comedy repreſented upon the Theatre at <hi>Buen-Retiro,</hi> which is a well-contrived Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The King and the Queen ſaw it on the <hi>Sunday,</hi> the next day it was acted before the ſeveral Councils, and on <hi>Tueſday</hi> before the Officers of the City. The Queen being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that the Dutcheſs <hi>de Bejar,</hi> and the Marchioneſs <hi>de Caſtel Rodrigo,</hi> who had never bore any Children before, were each of them delivered of a Son, begged leave of the King to ſend them word that ſhe wiſhed them joy: <q rend="inline">I agree to it, ſays the King ſmiling, on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that within nine months they will come in their turn to perform the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement to you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>All <hi>Spain</hi> impatiently expected to ſee what Remedies the new Miniſters would apply to thoſe diſorders, that ſeemed for a long time to be radicated in the Monarchy; but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever good intentions he had to rectifie them, he found it a difficult matter to put them in execution. The King's Treaſury was exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſeveral private Families ruined, the price of all Commodities exceſſive high; and theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities were heightned by the connivance of the Magiſtrates, and the length of time. During the Miniſtry of Don <hi>Juan</hi> nothing had been ſet in order, and ſince his death one would have thought they had affected to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don all manner of buſineſs.</p>
            <p>To this we may add, that the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> had never been in any employ, where he might learn that experience which is ſo neceſſary for Government. He was born
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0148502701:176"/>
and bred in the Genius of <hi>Madrid,</hi> which is ſo ſupine and careleſs, that nothing almoſt is determined there. Nay what is more, he ſuffered the Maſter of the Council to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate about the Publick Affairs, after the ſame manner, as he did, before his Miniſtry, and ſubmitted to take his Counſel; he likewiſe erected <hi>Junta's</hi> to debate of thoſe things, which he ſuppoſed to carry any great difficulty with them.</p>
            <p>He erected one amongſt the reſt, to which he nominated the Conſtable, the Admiral, and the Marquſs <hi>d'Aſtorgas,</hi> all which three were Councellors of State; he alſo admitted three Divines, whereof the King's Confeſſor was one, and three Councellors of the King's Council to examine along with him the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair of the Preſident of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> about which the Nuncio made ſo great a noiſe. The oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of this Diſpute was this, Monſieur <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lini,</hi> the Nuncio, had a mind to preſide over a Chapter of Religious, whom they call <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricos Minores,</hi> who were going to chooſe a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial. The Preſident deſired that one of his Friends might be named; now he kew that the Nuncio had a kindneſs for another, ſo he went the ſhorteſt way to work, and obtained a Decree of the King, which forbad him to preſide in that Aſſembly, and becauſe he did not exactly obey it, he was fined a thouſand Crowns.</p>
            <p>The Nuncio ſuffered this ſtrange treatment with indignation enough, and complained of it to the Pope. His Holineſs writ to the King about it, and Don <hi>Juan</hi> promiſed him to get the Fine revoked; but the many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders that happened after his death, hindred
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0148502701:177"/>
the execution of it. The King thought the buſineſs was laid aſleep, becauſe he writ a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſubmiſſive Letter to the Pope about it; but for all that the Nuncio, who was not to be appeaſed by a Letter, renewed the Quarrel after the Prince's death. He ſaw that the King had not as yet pitched upon a Chief Miniſter, and judged that the Preſident of <hi>Caſtile</hi> was not well ſupported; he knew he had abundance of Enemies, and that amongſt the reſt the Queen-Mother was the moſt inveterate againſt him. All theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations ſerved to perſwade him, that he ſhould obtain an intire ſatisfaction without any trouble.</p>
            <p>He pretended therefore that he ought to loſe his Place, and to go to <hi>Rome</hi> to have the Suſpenſion taken off, which he had incurred in the year 1679. The Court abſolutely refuſed to grant him what he demanded; upon this he complained very highly to the King, telling him that he ill performed what he had promiſed the Pope in his Letter.</p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> being advanced to the Miniſtry, was willing to examine the Reaſons of the Nuncio, and thoſe of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident by the <hi>Junta.</hi> 'Twas alledged in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the laſt, that being a native of <hi>Spain,</hi> the King could not abandon him to the Pope's reſentments, if at the bottom he did not deſerve it; that it was true indeed he had done irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular things upon ſeveral occaſions, but then his Place was of that nature, that he could not forfeit it unleſs it were for Reaſons of the greateſt importance: The Chief Miniſter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that he ſhould keep his Place of being Preſident of the Council of the <hi>Indies,</hi> and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0148502701:178"/>
that Don <hi>Vincente Gonzaga</hi> ſhould perform all his Functions. He received with extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſatisfaction the offer which the Admiral of <hi>Caſtile</hi> made, to reſign the Office of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Horſe to him, which is generally poſſeſt by the Favourite, but would not accept of it.</p>
            <p>He gave order to Don <hi>Gabriel Quinones,</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of the Council of War, to bring in his Accounts, out of hopes of drawing ſome Money from thence; and indeed the State was never in ſuch extremity of want as now; for ſince the publiſhing of the King's Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ſinking the value of Money, all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce was intirely ſtopt, the Shops continued ſhut up, and the People groaned under the greateſt Neceſſities imaginable. The Duke uſed all his Power to remedy theſe preſſing Grievances, he deſigned to coin new Money, and leſſen the Price of all Commodities; but the effect of his good Intentions was long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed, and the publick Miſery increaſed more and more every day.</p>
            <p>Hereupon a Man of great buſineſs, whoſe name was <hi>Marcos Dias</hi> preſented a Memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to the Duke, wherein he propoſed a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to raiſe the King's Revenue, and yet eaſe the People; he offered to prove that the Magiſtrates of the City of <hi>Madrid,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of reimburſing themſelves of the Money they had lent the late King, had rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed conſiderable Summs, and had never given any account of them. He propoſed a way to force them to refund the overplus, as well to ſupply the preſent want, as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the like Exactions for the time to come. The Duke hearkned to him, and told him
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0148502701:179"/>
his Advice was good. Immediately after this <hi>Marcos Dias</hi> preſented another Memorial to him, wherein he ſhewed, that his Majeſty's Dues were conſiderably diminiſhed, that he offered to pay the full worth of them, and yet to make an Advance of two hundred thouſand Crowns, a Preſent of a hundred thouſand Crowns to the King, and leſſen the Impoſition of the Dues one half of what it amounted to the year 1664, when they were leſs by one third part, than they were this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Year. For this he demanded that the Rents of the Guild-Hall of the City of <hi>Madrid,</hi> the Payments whereof were aſſigned for theſe Funds, ſhould be reduced to five in the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, whereas they were riſen to eight; and what is more, he ſtill offered to reimburſe thoſe Perſons who were not willing to ſuffer this diminution.</p>
            <p>It is natural to believe, that he knew his own Accounts well enough, not to loſe any thing by his Project, and to ſay the truth, he had been no loſer: For the Diſorders and Rapines were at that time ſo great, that not a ninth part of the King's Rights came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Coffers. The Duke foreſeeing the Event of this Affair, adviſed <hi>Marcos Dias</hi> not to ſtir out of the Palace; but he had a mind to go to <hi>Alcala,</hi> and he returned with vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting of Blood and Convulſions, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned the belief that he was poiſoned: For this Overture of accommodating the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Affairs, diſguſted ſome particular Perſons of great Eſtates, who got prodigious Summs at the Expence of the King and People<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Theſe Perſons, to avert this Blow, had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to <hi>Dias,</hi> and threatned to have him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly <pb n="169" facs="tcp:0148502701:180"/>
ſtabbed if he continued his propoſals. He was very apprehenſive of the danger he incurred, and beſides this, theſe very Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates offered the ſame terms to his Majeſty: But the Duke ſaw there was all the reaſon in the world to prefer <hi>Dias,</hi> and ſo he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed the others. Upon a conſideration of what theſe differences might produce, the Duke adviſed him to have a care of himſelf, till the Treaty was concluded. The advice was good, if he had had the good fortune to have followed it, but as he came back from <hi>Alcala</hi> to <hi>Madrid,</hi> he met ſome men in Maſques, who gave him ſeveral blows with little bags full of Sand, ſo that he ſpit abundance of blood at his mouth, and being ſeized with a violent Feavor died on the firſt day of <hi>April.</hi> The Corrigidor, and ſome other Officers of the City were the men that were principally exaſperated againſt him, becauſe he had diſcovered their Villanies a little before: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs they were willing to ſubmit to ſome beneficial alterations in matters, and ſo they reduced the Rents of the Guild-Hall of the City, from eight to five in the hundred. There was alſo ſome ſmall regulation made in the Civil Government, but the Duke could not forbear to be ſenſibly touched for loſing, by the death of <hi>Dias,</hi> an opportunity to ſerve the King and eaſe the People.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the people who had ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flattered themſelves that if the Propoſals made by <hi>Dias</hi> had taken effect, they ſhould have met with plenty inſtead of want; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing informed of his indiſpoſition, flocked about his Houſe, and cryed out aloud, that he was poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, and that this buſineſs ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0148502701:181"/>
to the bottom, becauſe he ſuffered for the good will he had expreſſed towards them. They added menaces againſt thoſe perſons who had oppoſed ſuch profitable advice, and as the King accidentally paſſed by them in his Coach, a great body of them got about the Coach, and followed it crying,</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">
                  <hi>Vive el Roi y muera el mal Goviorno,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Let the King live, and the ill Government dye.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>There were great endeavours uſed to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate the firſt motions of the popular fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which exceedingly increaſed on the day that <hi>Dias</hi> died. Above ſix thouſand were got together, who ran up and down the Streets complaining and weeping bitterly, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of them ſaid, that they had mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the only man that wiſhed them well. They accompanied his body to the place of burial, and the Streets were ſo full of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that the King durſt not ſtir out of his Palace, altho he was to go to a great Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val that was celebrated by the Jeſuits, and he had a great deſire to be there. There was little probability that they would ever be appeaſed, but as good fortune would have it, the multitude was only made up of poor irreſolute people, whoſe ſpirits were broken by the miſeries of which they complained. All this Tempeſt paſt over in vain menaces, and ſome injuries againſt ſome conſiderable perſons, but however it did not alter the State of Affairs.</p>
            <p>At this ſame time word was ſent to the Nuncio, by an expreſs Order from Court, that he ſhould enjoy no other priviledges than what the Ambaſſador of <hi>Spain</hi> did at
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0148502701:182"/>
               <hi>Rome.</hi> This was a new occaſion of diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to him; but the Action was general and they took care to inform the other For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Miniſters, that for the future they would allow them only the ſame priviledges as their Princes allowed to the Ambaſſadors of his Catholick Majeſty; ſo that he had no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to complain ſince he was treated but like the reſt. This reſolution was taken upon this account. Six <hi>Alguazils de Corte</hi> paſſing before the Houſe of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, it ſeems three of his Footmen knew them, and demanded of them how they durſt have the impudence to go through their Quarter. The <hi>Alguazils,</hi> returned them a ſawcy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, whereupon the ſervants drew their Swords, but the <hi>Alguazils</hi> fired immediately upon them, and killed them upon the place. The Ambaſſador made great complaints a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, they promiſed to give him full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, but to avoid the doing of it, they thought it more expedient to revoke all the Franchiſes.</p>
            <p>The King received a Letter from the Vice-Roy of <hi>Naples,</hi> and was extreamly glad to hear that he had found out a way to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row three hundred thouſand Crowns of the Merchants of <hi>Genoa</hi> for the raiſing four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men that were to be ſent into the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laneſe:</hi> But they were perſwaded at Court that it would be a long time before they could be in a condition to get there, becauſe they demanded a further ſupply of mony from <hi>Madrid,</hi> and here they wanted it, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, for every thing. However this did not hinder them from uſing all imaginable efforts to contribute towards the raiſing of
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0148502701:183"/>
theſe four thouſand men, becauſe they were exceedingly alarmed at the Treaty of <hi>Caſal,</hi> which they pretended our King had bought of the Duke of <hi>Mantua.</hi> They apprehended, this was an open paſs to render himſelf Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of <hi>Italy</hi> when he pleaſed, and they were fully perſwaded that he had ſent an Army thither upon this ſcore.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Genoeſe</hi> firſt whiſpered and ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout theſe jealouſies, which at laſt reached the <hi>Venetians,</hi> ſo that they drew their Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers out of their Garriſons in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> and beſtowed them in their own Towns in <hi>Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardy,</hi> where they made ſome new Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The Emperor for his part was as much alarmed as the reſt of his Neighbours, for he ſent his Troops to the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> to guard them, and ſeveral Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> put themſelves to a great deal of trouble, out of an apprehenſion of a rupture. But if there was any reaſon to fear one, it was from the ſide of <hi>Biſca,</hi> where the people of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, who are under the dominion of <hi>Spain,</hi> have almoſt every day ſome diſputes with thoſe that live under the dominion of <hi>France,</hi> ſometimes about the fiſhing, at other times about other differences, each of them appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priating the River <hi>de Bidaſſoa</hi> to themſelves, ſo that they ſeldom live in peace. Matters came to that upſhot at laſt, that they burnt ſeveral Barques, and took ſeveral of the <hi>French</hi> priſoners. Our Ambaſſador was ordered to demand juſtice for theſe injuries, and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpoke to the Miniſters about it, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tued deaf in theſe caſes becauſe they had no mind to redreſs them. They perſiſted to be ſo ſtiff and obſtinate upon this occaſion,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0148502701:184"/>
that the Ambaſſador declared at laſt to Don <hi>Vinzente Gonzaga,</hi> that his Maſter would order his Troops to march towards the Frontiers, by which means it would be more eaſie to get ſatisfaction for the inſolence of the Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayneers, than by ſending to the Council at <hi>Madrid,</hi> that His Majeſty was concerned for the tranquility of his Subjects, and that he would take a due courſe to procure it. <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaga</hi> heard Monſieur <hi>de Villars</hi> very patiently, and told him at laſt that he was ſurprized to find him addreſs himſelf to him becauſe he was no longer Commiſſary, and that the Marqueſs <hi>de los Balbazez</hi> had been nominated to his Place above a month before. The Ambaſſador acquainted him, that generally theſe ſorts of Changes are not made without informing thoſe perſons who are intereſted in them, and that as for himſelf he had never heard the leaſt mention of it. Don <hi>Vincente</hi> replied, that Don <hi>Pedro Colonna</hi> had been or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to inform him of it, but that in truth he was a negligent perſon, and had ſhowed himſelf ſo not only on this occaſion. Upon this he made ſome particular reflections that were not very obliging to the new Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of State.</p>
            <p>Don <hi>Pedro Fernandez del Campo,</hi> Marqueſs <hi>de Majorada,</hi> who had been formerly Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of State, and to whom the Marqueſs <hi>de Valenzuela,</hi> when he became ſole Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite had an averſion, becauſe he would not blindly obey him, died of grief for the loſs of his Place, and to ſee it ſtill poſſeſſed by Don <hi>Jeronimo d'Eguya.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The number of the Maids of Honour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Queen, was about this time
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0148502701:185"/>
augmented. The King added to them the Daughter of the Princeſs <hi>Pio,</hi> thoſe of the Counteſs <hi>de Villambroſa,</hi> the Marqueſs <hi>de Pouar</hi>; the Duke <hi>d'Hijar,</hi> Donna <hi>Eleonora</hi> of the Houſe <hi>de Zapara,</hi> the Niece of the Dutcheſs <hi>de Terra Nova,</hi> and Mademoiſelle <hi>de Lalain,</hi> who was a <hi>Flemiſh</hi> Woman. But altho' this was a Teſtimony of the particular Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration which the King had for his young Queen, becauſe ordinarily the Queens of <hi>Spain</hi> have not ſo many, yet he could not forbear to be ſenſibly tormented at the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which the <hi>Camerara</hi> continually buzzed into his Ear. Don <hi>Melchior Navarra,</hi> who had formerly been Vice-Chancellor of <hi>Arragon,</hi> and whom Don <hi>Juan</hi> baniſhed to <hi>Cienpuzue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los,</hi> was called home at the intreaties of the Queen Mother. Nay it was even believed that the King would give him the Place of Preſident of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> in caſe the Preſident, who was then embroyled with the Nuncio, were turned of his Place.</p>
            <p>The King and Queen had the pleaſure of hearing Maſs celebrated at the Jeſuits College in the <hi>Chaldean-Language,</hi> by a Prieſt of the City of <hi>Muzal,</hi> which was heretofore called <hi>Ninive.</hi> After it was over, the Queen, who was always deſirous of informing her ſelf in matters of Curioſity, ſent for him to come to her, and by the means of an Interpreter, ſhe asked him ſeveral queſtions, and amongſt the reſt, whether the Women were as ſeverely lock'd up at <hi>Muzal,</hi> as they were at <hi>Madrid.</hi> This Queſtion, altho' there was nothing cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal in it, was ſo maliciouſly explained by the Dutcheſs <hi>de Terra Nova,</hi> that the King was obſerved to look upon her with a great
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0148502701:186"/>
deal of Coldneſs for ſome days after. This did not hinder the Queen-Mother from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to viſit her, who aſſured her with all the Tenderneſs imaginable how ſenſibly ſhe was concerned at theſe ill Offices that were done her. They went together to St. <hi>Marie la Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alle,</hi> where was celebrated the Beatification of <hi>Torribio Alphonſo Mogrobejo,</hi> Second Archbiſhop of <hi>Lima:</hi> The Muſick of the Chappel was there; their Majeſties were informed at their return, that the Great Arch-Deacon of <hi>Madrid</hi> was dead. The Queen-Mother ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be deſirous of ſeeing this Dignity filled by one of her own Creatures, and the Young Queen propoſed to ſend to Cardinal <hi>Porto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carero</hi> to demand it of him: But now it was too late, for the Cardinal to prevent all Solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations upon this Point, made haſte to gratify his Nephew Don <hi>Pedro Portocarero</hi> with it.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, whilſt theſe ſmall things happened, News was brought that a Squadron of <hi>French</hi> Men of War, commanded by the Marqueſs <hi>de Valbelle,</hi> was arrived before the Iſle of <hi>Majorca,</hi> to demand of the Viceroy ſome Merchant-men that had been taken by the Corſairs, ſince the Peace, and Monſieur <hi>Valbelle</hi> had in his hands an Order of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> for their Reſtitution. The Viceroy would not reſtore their Prizes, alledging, <q rend="inline">That the Perſons who had taken them had already ſhared and divided them, and that they were not all of them <hi>Majorcans</hi>; that the Effects were all conſumed and gone, and for his part he demanded Damages for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Hoſtilities which theſe Corſairs had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.</q> 
               <hi>Valbelle</hi> continued his Inſtances; but ſeeing they had no Effect, he declared that
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0148502701:187"/>
he would not forget, to make uſe of the Right of Repriſals; <q rend="inline">That the Subjects of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> when-ever he met them on the Sea, ſhould find it to their coſt; that the King his Maſter had reaſon to complain of the uſage he found at their hands; That ſeveral Governors and Viceroys dependant upon the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had taken liberty to commit all Injuſtices againſt the <hi>French</hi>; that it was almoſt to no purpoſe to demand ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction from thoſe at <hi>Madrid,</hi> where the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils were filled with Perſons who had played the ſame Tricks, when they were in the like Poſts, and conſequently durſt not condem and puniſh others for the very ſame crimes they had committed themſelves; that he was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured this was the reaſon that occaſioned this impunity and all their frivolous Pretences: In a word, that he was going to take another courſe with them, and do himſelf Juſtice.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Menaces, one would have thought, were ſufficient to alarm thoſe Perſons that were concerned in them; but they have this Maxim in <hi>Spain,</hi> That provided the danger is a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, they never fear it; whether this happens through inſolence or temerity, and they rather chuſe to ſuffer the diſorders, that always fall out in Military Executions, than give themſelves the trouble to do Juſtice upon the Complaints that are made.</p>

                  <p>This Council is the chief of all, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh it from the reſt by a Title of Honour, the King calls it <hi>Our Council.</hi> It was eſtabliſhed by St. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the third of that name, in the year 1246. There are in this Council a Preſident, Sixteen Councellors, a Fiſcal, Six Reporters, ſix Secretaries, a Regiſter, and a Keeper of the Regiſters, a Receiver of the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0148502701:190"/>
Fines due to the Council, another of the Fines adjudged to particular perſons, a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer, a Deputy, and a dozen Porters. The Council aſſembles every <hi>Friday</hi> in the Palace, towards Evening the King comes there. The Kings, Don <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Fourth, and Don <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonzo</hi> the laſt of that name, eſtabliſhed this Cuſtom. This Council is divided into four Chambers, where they diſtribute thoſe Affairs that are under their Juriſdiction in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One of them goes by the name of the Chamber of the fifteen hundred Piſtoles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch a Sum is to be conſigned before any man can get a review of a proceſs which is pretended to be unjuſtly judged by the Parliaments of <hi>Vailladolid</hi> and <hi>Granada,</hi> which are the two Parliaments of <hi>Caſtile.</hi>

                  <p>When the Preſident of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> goes out of the Council, the Counſellors follow him to his Chair; he never makes any Viſits, never gives the Right hand to any at his Houſe; he is to give the King an account of the moſt important affairs, that paſs in Council, where they name a Council every Week to report them.</p>
                  <p>When the King comes there, they all unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver themſelves and kneel down. Afterwards they cover themſelves and ſit.</p>
                  <p>When Audience is over, the King retires into his Cabinet with the Preſident, who diſcourſes him about buſineſs of the greateſt moment for which the King gives his Orders, and this does not return any more to the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber for the Counſellors to deliberate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>

In the Year 1609. all <hi>Caſtile</hi> was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into five Diſtricts, and every Diſtrict is under a Counſellor of the Council Royal, who takes cognizance of the conduct of the Judges, the Lords, Eccleſiaſticks, and other ſecular perſons. Beſides this, there is a particular Council that is called the Council of the Chamber of <hi>Caſtile</hi>; the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident is the Chief, and the King names a certain number of Counſellors of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil Royal whether they be three, or four that compoſe it. Here it is that they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch all Benefices in the King's Nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Titles, and Patents for the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Places, Letters of Naturalization, and the Ratification of Orders to arreſt the Grandees of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Graces and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, to which his Majeſty is pleaſed to give his Conſent.</p>
                  <p>The King receives prodigious Sums of Money for the Places that are ſold by the means of theſe Counſellors. He gives likewiſe the Patents and Commiſſions of ſeveral places of Juſtice, and 'tis commonly pretended that in the two <hi>Caſtiles,</hi> the Kingdom of <hi>Leon, Guypuſcoa, Biſcay,</hi> the Province <hi>de Hana,</hi> and in <hi>Navarr</hi> there are above 72 thouſand places of Judicature.</p>

                  <p>This Secretary is in a condition to ſerve or injure people, according as he ſtands affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to them, for all the Requeſts and Petitions, which they call Memorials here,

'Tis he who ſends them to his Counſellors, who are to give their advice concerning them: After the conſult is made (for this is their Phraſe in <hi>Spain</hi>) theſe Petitions are ſent back again to the Secretary of State, and when he reports them to the King, his Majeſty orders what pleaſes him, and this is called a Decree.</p>
                  <p>This Decree is expedited by perſons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for that Office; ſo that when theſe Requeſts are carried to the King they ſay the Memorial is mounted; and when they are anſwered, they ſay the Memorial falls down; or elſe the Conſult aſcended and the Decree deſcended.</p>
                  <p>Without counting the Secretary of State, whom I have been ſpeaking of, there are two more that enter the Council, one of them diſpatches the Affairs of <hi>Arragon,</hi> of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> the other thoſe of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and the <hi>North.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One of theſe is named Don <hi>Manuel de Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> who was formerly Maſter of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and Envoy Extraordinary in <hi>Holland</hi>; he was made at his return Secretary of State. The other is called Don <hi>Pedro Colonna,</hi> he is deſcended of a good Family, and thoſe of his Houſe have always poſſeſt great places. They may give their advice in writing in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of conſequence.</p>
                  <p>The King ſends the Decrees to them, and through their hands Affairs go to the Council of State: They make a Report of them there, and gather the voices; and give an account of all to his Majeſty, who at laſt orders it
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0148502701:193"/>
as he thinks fit. They have power to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the Council out of the appointed days, when they judge it convenient, and when the King has a mind that they ſhould have any extraordinary Meeting, they ſend the Order immediately to all the Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors.</p>
                  <p>Every Secretary of State has a chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary, who is called the Official Mayor, and exerciſes his Maſter's Office, when he happens to be abſent. The Secretary of State for <hi>Italy</hi> has eight Commiſſioners, reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him that is the principal, the King pays them: And the Secretary of State for the <hi>North</hi> has ſeven under him: They chuſe them themſelves, and the King gives his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: Theſe diſpatch all Patents, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally thoſe Perſons that get into theſe Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, advance their Fortunes in the World.</p>

They muſt be Men of Experience and Service, the number of them is not fixed, and it depends upon the King's pleaſure to augment, or to diminiſh them. Their Places are not regulated in the Council, but they ſit as they come. It
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0148502701:194"/>
is indeed true, that when the Counſellors of State are called thither, they have the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per end, but then they never come but at a time when a full Council of War is held.

                  <p>When they debate about matters of juſtice an Aſſeſſor of the Council Royal, makes a report of them, who has likewiſe the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to give his opinion before the Dean of the Council: The King comes there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every day. There are beſides ſome other Chambers that depend upon this Council, ſuch as thoſe of the Flota's, the Gallies, and the Garriſons. The King nominates the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers for theſe Chambers.
