            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>About four Years ago I exhibited my LECTURE at <hi>Whitehaven,</hi> and having Occaſion to uſe this Man's Shop, he took the Opportunity of ſolliciting me to give him a few Comic Songs, <q>becauſe he had a Mind to publiſh a Volume to pleaſe his Cuſtomers in the Part of the Country where he lived,</q> and at the ſame Time opening a Song Book, ſhewed me ſeveral under my Name, which he told me he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to print in his Collection:—My Reply was;— <q>
                  <hi>Sir, There is not one of thoſe printed as I wrote them; and ſome to which my Name is affixed are really not mine.</hi>
               </q>—<q>But ſir, replied my Chapman, will you pleaſe to give yourſelf the Trouble to mark ſuch
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0674800100:4"/>of them as are yours.</q>—<q>
                  <hi>Why really, ſir, I am aſhamed of them.</hi>
               </q>—<q>Lord, ſir, they'll do very well here; pray, ſir, take the Book home, and be ſo obliging as to mark them for me. — And, if it would not give Mr <hi>Stevens</hi> too much Trouble, I ſhould be greatly obliged if he would juſt put a Mark upon any other Songs in the Book that he thinks worth printing.</q>—This was done, and the Volume returned the next Day.</p>
            <p>From hence I could not imagine he would do <hi>more</hi> than inſert my Name to the Songs I had owned; and I ſolemnly declare he had no Authority from me to uſe it otherwiſe. — What I did was a meer Act of common Civility;—I had not then, nor have I ſince had any Connections with the Man; and upon this Ground alone he has had the <hi>Modeſty</hi> to charge me with a Breach of Promiſe by my Diſavowal.— This, among other Reaſons, has induced me to publiſh my own Songs, which I now claim as Property, and have entered in the Hall Books of the Stationers Company.</p>

            <p>After <hi>Circe's</hi> elopement with <hi>Ulyſſes,</hi> they became wanderers upon the Face of the Earth, and like <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Strol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-players,</hi> continue <hi>Itinerants</hi> even unto this day; they have nevertheleſs mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied exceedingly, propagating their Convivialities into the different <hi>Orders</hi> of GRIGS, GREGS, and GREGORIANS; —ANTIGALLICANS, FREE MASONS, and MACARONI;—SONS of SOUND SENSE and SATISFACTION;—SONS of KIT, and OLD SOULS;—TRUE BLUES, PUR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLES, and ALBIONS; — The BEEF STEAK, JOCKEY, and CATCH CLUBS; —The MAGDALENS, and LUMBER TROOP, with many Others; all which acknowledge the Affinity they bear to their paternal Society, by celebrating

            </p>
            <p>The CHOICE SPIRITS have ever been famous for their Talents as Muſical Artiſts. They uſually met at the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt-homes of Grape-gathering: There exhilerated by the preſſings of the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, they were wont to ſing Songs, tell Stories, and ſhew Tricks, from their firſt emerging, until their Perihelion under the Preſidentſhip of Mr. GEORGE ALEXANDER STEVENS, <hi>Ballad-Laureat</hi> to the Society of CHOICE SPIRITS, and who appeared at Ranelagh in the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of COMUS, ſupported by thoſe Droles of merry Memory.</p>
            <p>Unparalleled were their performances, as <hi>firſt Fiſts</hi> upon the SALT-BOX, and inimitable the variations they would twang upon the <hi>forte</hi> and <hi>piano</hi> JEWS-HARP.
