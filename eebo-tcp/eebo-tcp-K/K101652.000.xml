            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <l>"HOW idle are mortals!" (ſaid Wiſdom to Youth)</l>
                  <l>"They ſlight the clear dictates of Reaſon and Truth;</l>
                  <l>"They worſhip Ambition, to Pleaſure they bend,</l>
                  <l>"Yet blindly o'erlook a more excellent friend:</l>
                  <l>"And hence their vain hopes are eternally croſt,</l>
                  <l>"Their life in a tempeſt of wiſhes is loſt;</l>
                  <l>"Still deſtin'd to toil, and of toil to repent,</l>
                  <l>"For neglect of juſt vows to the Goddeſs Content;</l>
                  <l>"That Goddeſs from whom all felicity flows,</l>
                  <l>"Who unites every good in the gift ſhe beſtows;</l>
                  <l>"So free of her bounty to all who confeſs it,</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>When I heard this fine ſpeech, my fond paſſion was rais'd,</l>
                  <l>And I ſet forth in queſt of the Being ſo prais'd;</l>
                  <l>At the manſion of Grandeur my ſearch I begin,</l>
                  <l>And aſk if the Goddeſs Content is within:</l>
                  <l>But Pride, who as centinel guarded the door,</l>
                  <l>Said bluntly he ne'er heard her title before;</l>

He told me I wanted a poor ruſtic ſlut,</l>
                  <l>And bade me go look in ſome little thatch'd hut.</l>
                  <l>I march'd to the Villager's lowly abode,</l>
                  <l>'Twas a ſnug pretty cottage, and ſtood near the road:</l>
                  <l>And here a good woman, poſſeſſing, tho' humble,</l>
                  <l>A face that could frown, and a tongue that would grumble,</l>
                  <l>Said—the perſon I aſk'd for had lodg'd in her cot,</l>
                  <l>But, alas! ſuch good luck was no longer her lot;</l>
                  <l>For ſhe quitted her roof, where ſhe oft had repos'd,</l>
                  <l>When you great houſe was built, and the common inclos'd.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>I conceiv'd, as I now bade the village farewell,</l>
                  <l>With the mild ſons of Science this Goddeſs muſt dwell;</l>
                  <l>But thoſe, where I ſought ſome obliging inſtructor,</l>
                  <l>Were ſquabbling about an electric conductor.</l>
                  <l>Some cry'd up the point; ſome commended the ball;</l>
                  <l>The ſoft breath of Science was turn'd to a ſquall:</l>
                  <l>The Sages no mental conductor could find</l>
                  <l>To draw off the flame that now flaſh'd on their mind.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>In haſte I exclaim'd, to the Learned adieu!</l>
                  <l>For even Science offends, when ſhe talks like a ſhrew.</l>

                  <l>Having wander'd ſo wide of the object I ſought,</l>
                  <l>I was now led to think, and rejoic'd at the thought,</l>
                  <l>This Goddeſs (herſelf for her charms ſo renown'd)</l>
                  <l>With the daughters of Beauty muſt ſurely be found</l>
                  <l>With this hope I approach'd (unperceiv'd by them all)</l>
                  <l>Three lovely young girls juſt array'd for the ball;</l>
                  <l>In each, whoſe bright eyes on a mirror were bent,</l>
                  <l>I thought I diſcover'd a ſpark of Content;</l>
                  <l>But watching them more, in their beautiful faces,</l>
                  <l>Of the goddeſs I ſought I no more ſaw the traces;</l>
                  <l>For as they ſurvey'd, with a critical glance,</l>
                  <l>The elegant MONTAGU move in the dance,</l>
                  <l>In her exquiſite figure ſuch graces were ſhewn,</l>
                  <l>That viewing her charms they diſtruſted their own.</l>
                  <l>Thou gentleſt of nymphs! while thy triumphs increaſe,</l>
                  <l>Unconſcious of beauty, ſo fatal to peace!</l>
                  <l>Tho' the ſparks of Content in one ſex thou may'ſt ſmother,</l>
                  <l>Bright Ecſtaſy's flame thou wilt raiſe in the other.</l>
                  <l>If in boſom parental Content could reſide,</l>
                  <l>The heart of thy parent this treaſure muſt hide;</l>
                  <l>But, alas! 'tis a truth which all parents lament,</l>
                  <l>Their tender anxiety ſtifles Content.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>O tell me, while vainly to find thee I pant,</l>
