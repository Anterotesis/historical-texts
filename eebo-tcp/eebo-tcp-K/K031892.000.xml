            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T has ever been the Cuſtom of Poets to ſhelter Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of this Nature un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Patronage of the brighteſt Men of their Time; and 'tis obſerv'd, that the Muſes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways met the kindeſt Reception from Perſons of the greateſt Merit. The World will do me Juſtice as to the Choice of my Patron, but will, I fear,
<pb facs="tcp:0391401600:4"/>
blame my raſh Attempt, in daring to Addreſs Your Grace, and offer at a Work too difficult for our ableſt Pens, <hi>viz.</hi> an Encomium on Your Grace: I have no Plea againſt ſuch juſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, but the Diſadvantage of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, and the Privilege of my Sex.</p>
            <p>If Your Grace diſcovers a Genius ſo ſurpriſing in this Dawn of Life, what muſt your riper Years produce? Your Grace has already been diſtinguiſh'd in a moſt peculiar Manner, being the firſt Young Nobleman that ever was admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into a Houſe of Peers before he reached the Age of One and Twenty: But Your Grace's Judgment and Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence ſoon convinced that Auguſt Aſſembly, that the excelling Gifts of Nature ought not to be confin'd to Time. We hope the Example which <hi>Ireland</hi> has ſet, will ſhortly be followed by an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Houſe of Lords, and Your Grace made a Member of that Body, to which You will be ſo Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous an Ornament.</p>
            <p>Your good Senſe, and real Love for your Country, taught Your Grace to perſevere in the Principles of your Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb facs="tcp:0391401600:5"/>
Anceſtors, by adhering to the Defender of our Religion and Laws: and the penetrating Wiſdom of Your Royal Maſter, ſaw you merited your Honours ere he conferr'd them. It is one of the greateſt Glories of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, to diſtinguiſh where to beſtow his Favours; and the World muſt do ours Juſtice, by owning Your Grace's Titles moſt deſervedly worn.</p>
            <p>It is with the greateſt Pleaſure ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable the Friends of Liberty ſee You purſuing the Steps of Your Noble Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Your Courteous, Affable Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, free from Pride and Oſtentation, makes Your Name ador'd in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and enables Your Grace to carry what Point You pleaſe. The late Lord <hi>Wharton</hi> will be ſtill remember'd by every Lover of his Country, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver felt a greater Shock than what his Death occaſion'd: Their Grief had been inconſolable, if Heaven, out of its won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Beneficence to this Favourite Iſle, had not tranſmitted all his ſhining Qualities to you, and Phenix like, raiſed up one Patriot out of the Aſhes of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0391401600:6"/>
That Your Grace has a high Eſteem for Learning, particularly appears by the large Progreſs you have made therein: and your Love for the Muſes ſhews a Sweetneſs of Temper, and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Humanity, peculiar to the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Your Soul; for ſuch Virtues reign not in the Breaſt of every Man of Quality.</p>
            <p>Defer no longer then, my Lord, to charm the World with the Beauty of your Numbers, and ſhew the Poet, as you have done the Orator; convince our unthinking <hi>Britous,</hi> by what vile Arts <hi>France</hi> loſt her Liberty; and teach 'em to avoid their own Misfortunes, as well as to weep over <hi>Henry</hi> IV. who (if it were poſſible for him to know) would forgive the bold Aſſaſſin's Hand, for the Honour of having his Fall celebrated by Your Grace's Pen.</p>
            <p>To be diſtinguiſh'd by Perſons of Your Grace's Character, is not only the higheſt Ambition, but the greateſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation to an Author; and it is not the leaſt of my Vanities, to have it known to the Publick I had Your Grace's Leave to prefix Your Name to this Comedy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0391401600:7"/>
I wiſh I were capable to cloath the following Scenes in ſuch a Dreſs, as might be worthy to appear before Your Grace, and draw Your Attention as much as Your Grace's admirable Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications do that of all Mankind; but the Muſes, like moſt Females, are leaſt liberal to their own Sex.</p>
            <p>All I dare ſay in Favour of this Piece is, that the Plot is entirely New, and the Incidents wholly owing to my own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention; not borrow'd from our own, or tranſlated from the Works of any Foreign Poet; ſo that they have at leaſt the Charm of Novelty to recommend 'em: If they are ſo lucky in ſome lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure Hour to give Your Grace the Leaſt Diverſion, they will anſwer the utmoſt Ambition of, my Lord,</p>

            <l>TO-Night we come upon a bold Deſign,</l>
            <l>To try to pleaſe without one borrow'd Line:</l>
            <l>Our Plot is new, and regularly clear,</l>
            <l>And not one ſingle Tittle from <hi>Moliere:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>O'er bury'd Poets we with Caution tread,</l>
            <l>And Pariſh Sextons leave to rob the Dead.</l>
            <l>For you, bright <hi>Britiſh</hi> Fair, in hopes to charm ye,</l>
            <l>We bring To-night a Lover from the Army:</l>
            <l>You know the Soldiers have the ſtrangeſt Arts,</l>
            <l>Such a Proportion of prevailing Parts,</l>
            <l>You'd think that they rid Poſt to Womens Hearts.</l>
            <l>I wonder whence they draw their bold Pretence;</l>
            <l>We do not chuſe them ſure for our Defence:</l>
            <l>That Plea is both impolitick and wrong,</l>
            <l>And only ſuits ſuch Dames as want a Tongue.</l>
            <l>Is it their Eloquence and fine Addreſs?</l>
            <l>The Softneſs of their Language?—Nothing leſs.</l>
            <l>Is it their Courage, that they bravely dare</l>
            <l>To ſtorm the Sex at once?—Egad, 'tis there:</l>

               <pb facs="tcp:0391401600:9"/>They act by us as in the rough Campaign,</l>

            <l>They Mine and Countermine, reſolv'd to win,</l>
            <l>And, if a Breach is made—they will come in.</l>
            <l>You'll think, by what we have of Soldiers ſaid,</l>
            <l>Our Female Wit was in the Service bred;</l>
            <l>But ſhe is to the hardy Toil a Stranger,</l>
            <l>She loves the Cloth indeed, but hates the Danger;</l>
            <l>Yet to this Circle of the Brave and Gay,</l>
            <l>She bid me for her good Intentions ſay,</l>
            <l>She hopes you'll not reduce her to Half-Pay.</l>
            <l>As for our Play, 'tis <hi>Engliſh</hi> Humour all;</l>
            <l>Then will you let our Manufacture fall?</l>
            <l>Would you the Honour of our Nation raiſe,</l>
