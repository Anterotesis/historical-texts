            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE truly generous, noble, and indefatigable Spirit you have exerted on the Behalf of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, during your ſitting in Parliament, has drawn upon you the Trouble of this Application. You have ſhewn, not only Inclination, but Ability to do real Service to your Country, by promoting and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on ſeveral Bills, which will greatly contribute to the publick Good,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0492501400:3"/>and tranſmit your Name with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to Poſterity. You are a true Patriot, in the pureſt Senſe of the Word; and, as ſuch, I don't doubt, but you will think the following Pages highly worthy of your ſerious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration; and if you find any Hint in them fair, reaſonable, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated for the Intereſt of your Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-ſubjects, you will gladly improve it, and readily concur in building upon it ſuch an wholſome Law as may redreſs the Grievance complained of. I think it will be eaſily granted, that the Health of the Body is full as valuable as the Property of Eſtates. How difficult would it be for any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe, that our Legiſlature is of that Opinion, who ſhould obſerve, that there are ſo many good Laws en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted by every Parliament for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0492501400:4"/>of the one, and ſcarce ever any Care taken of the Preſervation of the other? Indeed, within a long Series of Years, the Parliament has been moſt graciouſly pleaſed to caſt an Eye towards the Health of the People, by an Act impowering Phyſicians to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect Apothecaries Shops; by an Act for preventing the Retailing ſpirituous Liquors; and by an Act for the Encouragement of the Publication of Mrs. <hi>Stephens</hi>'s Remedies. However, theſe Inſtances, few as they are, prove, that the Honourable Houſe does not think the Health of the Nation intirely below their Care and Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; and therefore we ought to ſuppoſe, that the Reaſon why Acts of Parliament for the like good Purpoſes are not more frequent, is, that the Houſe is not applied to on ſuch Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0492501400:5"/>in a proper manner; that the Grievances the People labour under are not fairly and plainly laid before the Members, or practical Methods of Redreſs are not pointed out.</p>
            <p>The Health of a People can only be preſerved by all the wholſome Laws the Wiſdom of a Legiſlature can contrive, to prevent Luxury, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery, and every kind of Immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which infallibly produce Diſeaſes, or by frequent Inſpections into the State of Phyſick in their Country, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Abuſes will daily creep into every Society, or Set of Men, who find themſelves under no Reſtraint, from any Apprehenſions of being called to an Account for their Method of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mankind, in their moſt moment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Concernments. Tho' the firſt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0492501400:6"/>Part of this general Plan is highly worth your Conſideration, yet I ſhall beg Leave to ſay a few Words to you in regard to the latter only.</p>
            <p>The Reformation of the State of Phyſick in general is greatly wanting in this Nation, and, I believe, moſt warmly wiſhed by every honeſt Man, even of the Faculty itſelf. But tho' general Reformations may be as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult as they are deſireable, yet ſome crying Enormities may themſelves point out the Method of their own Redreſs.</p>
            <p>If we conſider the publick Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of the good People of <hi>England</hi> for theſe laſt Twenty Years, one ſhould be apt to conclude, that certain odd Conjunctions of the heavenly Bodies
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0492501400:7"/>brought on epidemical Follies, as well as Diſeaſes. How have <hi>Shakeſpeare, Johnſon, Otway,</hi> and all the Plays capable of delighting the Mind, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing the Head, or mending the Heart, been totally neglected, or cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received, while dear <hi>Harlequin!</hi> charming Devil! has filled all our Affections, triumphed over our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and emptied our Pockets! During an Aera like this, when ſuch crowded Audiences, compoſed of the great Vulgar and the ſmall, gave ſuch plain Demonſtrations of their polite Taſte, and profound Wiſdom, is it to be wonder'd, that there ſhould appear, from the malign Influences of the ſame Stars, Marks of an epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical Madneſs in other Parts of the Town, as well as in the Theatre? No; Dr. <hi>Fauſtus</hi> will have the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0492501400:8"/>to be handed down to Poſterity as the illuſtrious Contemporary of a <hi>Mapp,</hi> a <hi>Taylor,</hi> and a <hi>Ward.</hi> The Hiſtorian of our Days will be able to inform his Readers, that the Infatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation was ſo general, that <hi>Freind, Mead,</hi> and <hi>Pellet,</hi> were as much eclipſed by this bright Conſtellation, as <hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare</hi> then was by a more happy Genius; a Gentleman, who, with ſurprizing Activity, could turn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into all Shapes, and appear to be any Animal but what he really was. Such are the irreſiſtible Charms of Deluſion! Such the Happineſs of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deceived, that all our Applauſes riſe in Proportion to the Artfulneſs of the Impoſition, and the Difficulty of diſcovering the Cheat!</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0492501400:9"/>
            <p>Let Mrs. <hi>Mapp</hi>'s Bones reſt in Peace, tho' ſhe tortur'd ſo many in the Days of her Fame.</p>
            <p>Let the dexterous Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> be able to purge the viſual Ray of our neighbour Nations, that they may ſee their true Intereſt to conſiſt in treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Great-Britain</hi> with Honour and Reſpect.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Ward</hi> is the only medicinal Meteor which yet continues to ſhine amongſt us, whoſe Fame has raiſed him to the higheſt Degree of Eſteem and Admiration with the <hi>Gay</hi> and the <hi>Polite,</hi> on whoſe Authority and Judgment Thouſands, and Tens of Thouſands, of the lower Part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, ſwallow his Medicines with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit Faith, and are ſaid thereby to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0492501400:10"/>receive moſt wonderful Cures, in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt incurable Diſtempers. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of this Gentleman's Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being now become ſo very exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, his Manner of practiſing Phyſick cannot be thought a Subject unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the Notice and Conſideration of the Legiſlature. I am ſure, Sir, you will afford it your Attention, for a few Minutes, as it is of Importance to the Service of the Publick, to which I well know how much every Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your Time is dedicated.</p>
            <p>I ſhall by no means take upon me to determine, whether the numberleſs Deaths laid to this Gentleman's Charge by his Oppoſers, or the unparallel'd Cures he is ſaid to have performed by his Admirers, come neareſt the Truth. What he owns himſelf, and what all
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0492501400:11"/>his Friends allow, may, I hope, be taken for granted. He confeſſes, with great Candour, that he is wholly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the Hiſtory and Nature of Diſeaſes; that he underſtands nothing of Anatomy, or the animal Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and that he only pretends to ſome Knowledge in Chymiſtry, by which Art he has diſcovered a few Medicines, of greater Efficacy in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Caſes, than thoſe in common Uſe among regular Phyſicians. Suppoſe then, that what this Gentleman aſſerts is true, and that he has ſuch powerful chymical Secrets in his Poſſeſſion; muſt they not be capable of doing as much Harm, when ignorantly and promiſcuouſly adminiſtered, as they would be of doing Good in the Hands of a Perſon duly qualified to know in what Caſes, how, and when, properly
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0492501400:12"/>to apply them? Will that noble chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Charity, which from this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's <hi>known moral Character</hi> cannot but be believed to be the ſole Motive of his great Bounty to the Crowds of poor People who daily attend him, make amends for his dealing out theſe powerful Medicines ſo indiſcriminate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to all who ſhall pay him the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment of being willing to ſwallow them? Do the Multitude of Patients whom he never ſaw before, or will ſee afterwards, want no Attendance during the violent Operation of their Phyſick? No Perſon acquainted with the Nature of their Medicines, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve or correct any Accidents, which ſo often attend the moſt common and gentle Remedies? Surely it muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, to every unprejudiced Perſon, that the moſt uſeful Drugs, under
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0492501400:13"/>ſuch Management, muſt be a ſore Evil, and therefore that nothing can be more uncharitable, than thus to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and hurt a Multitude under the ſpecious Pretence of Charity? But however faulty this Gentleman's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Practice may be, yet his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines may in themſelves, and under proper Direction, be extremely valuable. Let us grant, that they are ſo; Is it not then incumbent on thoſe who have the Good of the People at Heart, to endeavour to render theſe valuable Secrets a publick Benefit, which, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their preſent Circumſtances, are ſo great a Calamity? Every Man ought to be rewarded for his Diſcovery of any thing that may be beneficial to Society. Mr. <hi>Ward</hi> ſhould not be deſired to part with his Property (and his Noſtrums are undoubtedly
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0492501400:14"/>ſuch) without a reaſonable Equivalent. The Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> is able to grant him this Equivalent, and they have a <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>demand</hi> the Knowledge of his Secrets on juſt and equitable Terms. An <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> who poſſeſſes a Piece of Ground which interrupts the making a River navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable, is <hi>obliged</hi> to part with his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty for the Good of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: Surely Mr. <hi>Ward</hi>'s Property in his Secrets is not more inviolable, than what every Man has in his own Land; and therefore it cannot be looked upon as any Hardſhip, if he ſhould be forced to part with them on like Conditions. Should ſuch a Demand be made upon him by Parliament; ſhould the Reward appointed be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>But to You, Sir, I humbly ſubmit the Conſideration of this <hi>important</hi> Point; I call it <hi>important;</hi> and what concerns the Lives of ſo many of the Innocent, and the Ignorant, deſerves to be ſo called. I ſpeak as a Friend to Mr. <hi>Ward,</hi> as well as to my Country. I propoſe a Method, by which, inſtead of being the Idol of a Few, he ſhall become the Darling of a whole People! by which he ſhall remove that huge Load of Scandal, which now lies upon him, to the great Chagrin of his Enemies, who ſhall pine with Envy at the Brightneſs of his Glory. The black Liſt of his private Murders, which is now maliciouſly handed about by Phyſicians, and their Emiſſaries,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0492501400:21"/>ſhall whiten into a pompous Regiſter of publick Cures, performed by his Medicines, on the miſerable Objects, who had been delivered over to the iron Jaws of Death, by the Ignorance or Indolence of thoſe Doctors, falſely ſo called, who have had no Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of underſtanding Phyſick, but their having been bred to the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. By this means this worthy Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman ſhall be freed from that La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and Toil with which he now ſerves his Country in his private Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity. He ſhall do even more Good, and yet, as is moſt meet and fit, he ſhall be able to retire from the World, full of Days and Honours; he ſhall ſpend the few laſt Years he has to come in Dignity and Eaſe, enjoying the calm Evening of a well-ſpent Life, converſing with Nature in the moſt endearing Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0492501400:22"/>to which he has arrived by tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing her ten thouſand Ways, till he made her confeſs thoſe very Secrets, which he has now communicated for the publick Good, and which ſhall draw down Bleſſings on him, and his Poſterity, through all future Ages.</p>
            <p>I beg therefore, Sir, for my Sake, as your Fellow-Citizen; for Mr. <hi>Ward</hi>'s Sake, who can do us all ſo much Service; and for your Country's Sake, whoſe Intereſt you have ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely and warmly at Heart, that you will think ſeriouſly on this Matter. What you ſee to be right, I know you will vigorouſly purſue; and to your good Conduct the Whole is ſubmitted, by, Sir,</p>
