            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THOUGH I can boaſt no acquaintance with Mrs. MONTAGUE, but that intellectual one, which the world of taſte in general claims with her; I truſt ſhe will pardon the liberty of prefixing her name to a comedy, the writer of which feels an admiration equal to her own for Shakeſpeare. When reſearch and criticiſm ſeemed exhauſted in throwing lights on the works of this great fountain of Engliſh dramatic genius, you, Madam, as if a ſpirit more congenial to his own, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach ſtill nearer to the Immortal Poet, diſpel the laſt miſt which time had ſhed

around him, and unveil the full glory of his mind. The ſmall tribute of reſpect I have preſumed to pay your talents in the courſe of my comedy, Madam, was, believe me, the ſpontaneous incenſe of my heart; and I have the ſatisfaction to reflect, that no reader will ſuſpect me of flattery in this declaration, but one who is a ſtranger to your ſame, and to your virtues.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE very great ſucceſs which has at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the performance of the following Comedy, induces the author to ſtate a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance which, on the firſt bluſh of the buſineſs, muſt appear rather ſingular. <hi>He would be a Soldier</hi> was preſented to Mr. Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the courſe of laſt Summer, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned—becauſe <hi>that gentleman did not like a line of it;</hi> and left this comfortable intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence were not ſufficient to wound the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the writer, Mr. Colman added, he did not know <hi>what could be done with it, or in what ſhape it could be produced, ſo as to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the entertainment of the public.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Author declares, that he then enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſuch notions of Mr. Colman's <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, taſte,</hi> and high <hi>ſenſe of honour,</hi> that his opinion was final with him; he laid by his performance in deſpair of ever acquiring pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit or ſame by it:—fortunately an intimate friend one day adviſed him to ſhow the piece to Mr. Harris; imagining even <hi>Mr. Colman might be miſtaken,</hi> or influenced by <hi>motives, the</hi>
               <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0699300800:5"/>
               <hi>writer of this addreſs</hi> never-ſuſpected any man harboured, till bitter experience convinced him of the contrary. Mr. Harris, to the very great ſurpriſe, and, no doubt, very <hi>great pleaſure</hi> of the author, happened to be totally of a different way of thinking from Mr. Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; and what is more, he heard the latter gentleman's opinion of the Comedy, but <hi>had too ſtrong, and too good a mind to be biaſſed by it.</hi> The ſucceſs which has attended the piece makes all farther comment on this ſhort hiſtory of it unneceſſary; and with the live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt ſenſe of gratitude for the marked atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, kindneſs, and liberality of Mr. Harris, the author ſubmits his production to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſal of the world.</p>

                     <p>But this is a matter on which I muſt ſee himſelf.—Col. Talbot, a gentleman of whom I think you muſt have heard, if you be Wilkins' wife, has wrote to him, and deſired I would ſee him in conſequence of that letter: were you at home when he received it?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mrs. Wil.</speaker>
                     <p>No, I was not, Sir: but I have often heard of Col. Talbot; he's an Oxfordſhire gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman; his family, I hear, was the makings of Wilkins. Lord! he has been a long time in the Indies, and, I'm told, has made a power of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. But is he come home, Sir?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Johnſ.</speaker>
                     <p>He is; and ſince, his return has been down in Oxfordſhire, in ſearch of Wilkins, where he thought he ſtill lived; and would have come here himſelf now, only he's very much indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mrs. Wil.</speaker>

                     <speaker>Johnſ.</speaker>
                     <p>He has made a very ungrateful return to his benefactor, Col. Talbot. My maſter thought him dead, not having heard from him ſo many years: a conduct that was unpardonable, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering his obligations to the Colonel, and the great truſt repoſed in him.</p>

                     <p>I cannot be certain: but, as he was a boy of great ſpirit, and ever prattling of being a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, I ſuſpect he was inveigled off by a recruiting

                     <p>Well, all this I can bear, becauſe I like contradiction—I conſider the mind like a ſpring; the more you preſs it, the more vigour you lend to its elaſticity; ſince I can remember, I always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted to be of a different opinion from other people; there's ſomething wonderfully flattering to human pride in being ſingular—but in marriage it is abſolutely necceſſary—man and wife are like the contending qualities of bitter and ſweet; they na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally quarrel, and exiſt by downright oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>

                     <p>Dear Mandeville, what courſe do you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe me to purſue with this untoward boy? With all his faults, I muſt conſider he is my ſon, and pity, whilſt he compels me to bluſh for him.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Man.</speaker>
                     <p>Sir, we muſt endeavour to form him as well as we can: but I am rather inclined to think we ſhall never be able to give him the graces.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Col.</speaker>
                     <p>He's not three and twenty—that's young; we have many begin later in life to acquire the rudiments of thoſe ſciences, in which they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards arriv'd to the higheſt pitch of eminence.— Have you been able to diſcover how the natural bent of his temper inclines, or if he has any ſtrong propenſities?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Man.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, Sir, from what I can collect in my ſhort acquaintance with him, the natural bent of his temper ſeems inclin'd to gallantry; and if he has any ſtrong propenſity, it is to the game of ſkittles.</p>

                  <sp>

                     <p>No matter how low and vulgar the game be, it ſhews a ſpirit of play in him, and it muſt be cruſh'd: but if he has a turn for gallantry,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0699300800:31"/>
it gives me the greateſt hopes of his reformation. The ſociety of an accompliſh'd and beautiful wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſoftens and refines the rougheſt nature; ſhe imparts, by a ſecret magic, her elegances and her graces; and to converſe with her, is a kind of ſtudy that inſenſibly poliſhes her admirer.—But what reaſon have you to ſuppoſe he is inclin'd to gallantry?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Man.</speaker>
                     <p>He has imparted all his amours to me; but one in particular, which very much diverted me, indeed:—After having been ſucceſsful with bar maids, young milleners, and taylors' daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, out of number, Cupid ſhot him from a cheeſe-cake battery, and he fell in love with a paſtrycook's daughter; which, oh, terrible! was the cauſe of his having an affair of honor with an attorney's clerk, in which both parties were bound over: but in painting this Helen, who bred the contention, how ſhall I do him juſtice at ſecond hand? Teniers lent him his pencil for her waiſt, and Titian for her head; for ſhe was ſhap'd like a Dutch cheeſe, and her locks were as red as a carrot.</p>

The Count, Mandeville, is an officer of infinite merit; he was my priſoner during the war, and is warmly attached to Engliſh manners and our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conſtitution.—But, Creveit!—to know the merit of ſuch a man, you muſt be acquainted with him.</p>

                     <p>Yes, and you may judge of his merit as a ſoldier, when I tell you, he has riſen from the ranks, at the age of three and twenty, to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion he now holds of captain. He's the reverſe of this ill-fated boy we have been ſpeaking to. He is ſelf-educated; for with ſcarce any advantages but thoſe he deriv'd from a moſt noble and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent nature, he is the man of ſenſe, the ſcholar, and the poliſh'd gentleman. His father, old Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velt, was no more than a ſerjeant, and ſerv'd in Germany under Lord Granby; he brought this young man with him to India, whilſt yet a boy; the firſt day he ever was in action, he ſaw his father fall; and he was found after the battle amongſt the ſlain, cloſe to his body, apparently lifeleſs with loſs of blood, as if he had died in the pious office of defending a parent.</p>

our manners—we delight in thinking for ourſelves—oppoſition is the very ſoul of an Engliſhman—he likes it in himſelf, and in others alſo; peace and proſperity, with good eating and drinking, would throw him into a lethargy, if imagination didn't ſupply that ſpur to goad him on conſtantly to action.</p>

                     <p>Well ſaid, Monſieur! cart before the horſe.—But now I am alone, let me ſee how my accounts ſtand: I haye ſecured the French nabob for my niece; now it would be a maſter ſtroke if I cou'd obtain the Engliſh one for my daughter, and thus center the two nabobs in my own family. This ſon of the Colonel's is a down right ſavage: Charlotte never cou'd like him; or if ſhe cou'd, intereſt tells me I ſhou'd not; therefore her liking's out of the queſtion: there's to be a diviſion of the Colonel's property, between the ſon and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deville: I want the whole, if poſſible. The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel's not fifty, and in my mind he's a better look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man than either his ſon or his nephew. Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte's having ten thouſand pounds independent of me, makes her very obſtinate; debates will run high, I fear; as, indeed, they very often do in my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, where, tho' I'm conſtantly left in a mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, I never loſe a queſtion—'tis true, I have open mouths upon me from all ſides, till, like greater men, I'm fairly badger'd: but it's only waiting till the ſtrangers are all out, and I tell the houſe

                     <p>Upon my word, Mr, Mandeville, you ſpeak to me in a very ſtrange ſtile; this is not a manner in which I am accuſtom'd to be addreſs'd.

                     <p>Sir, no man honours age more than I; or more readily yields rank every reſpect it can claim, when that rank does not forfeit its title to eſteem, by meanly ſinking and degrading itſelf:—but, when men in ſuperior ſtations behave as if their actions were above all cenſure and control, they muſt be told that they are deceiving themſelves, as well as the world, and that no man is ſuffer'd to injure another with impunity.</p>

                     <p>Mr. Mandeville, the poet ſays, that "Every day's a ſatire on the laſt;" now I ſay that every day's a contradiction to the laſt; as circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances vary, or events fall out, we are compelled by neceſſity to change our minds.

               <lg>
                  <l>NOW critic Jove the ſcale aloft ſuſpends;</l>
                  <l>On whoſe dread beam the poet's fate depends:</l>
                  <l>Ye gods above, high arbiters of wit,</l>
                  <l>Who on your ſhilling thrones in council ſit;</l>
                  <l>You I implore, for our poor bard afraid,</l>
                  <l>To grant celeſtial, upper-gall'ry aid;</l>
                  <l>If you approve, with Cato I ſhall cry</l>
                  <l>The gods take care of poets in the ſky!</l>
                  <l>As for the ladies—they'll ſure hear my pray'r,</l>
                  <l>New charms good-nature lends the faireſt fair;</l>
                  <l>Beſides, I hardly think they can be foes,</l>
                  <l>To a fond maid who a brave ſoldier choſe.</l>
                  <l>Who like a ſoldier charms the fair one's eyes,</l>
                  <l>The queen of beauty was a ſoldier's prize?</l>
                  <l>In love as war, the brave man beſt ſucceeds,</l>
                  <l>Our ſex reveres that valour which it needs.</l>
                  <l>Ye beaux, ſo finely waiſted now-a-days,</l>
                  <l>That one wou'd almoſt ſwear you put on ſtays;</l>
                  <l>You, I confeſs, create no great alarm,</l>
                  <l>You hav'nt ſpirit to do good, or harm.</l>
                  <l>But yonder I eſpy ſome dangerous faces;</l>
                  <l>Good critics, I entreat your favouring graces:</l>
                  <l>All I requeſt is, when a fault's ſet down,</l>
                  <l>Its neighbouring beauty may be told the town;</l>
                  <l>But after this, if you attempt to growl,</l>
                  <l>I'll excommunicate you, every ſoul!</l>
                  <l>In my lawn ſleeves and ſhirt, I'll come ſo big,</l>
                  <l>In every thing a biſhop, but his wig:</l>
                  <l>Nay, if you doubt, an army I will bring</l>
                  <l>Of biſhops, who may crown the greateſt king:</l>
                  <l>Their ſleeves of lawn, the down-wings of the dove;</l>
                  <l>Their ſaſh, the ceſtus of the queen of love:</l>
                  <l>With aid like this, and aid you'll own divine,</l>
                  <l>Who wou'd not think ſucceſs were ſurely mine?</l>
                  <l>In anxious hope I wait the dread decree,</l>
                  <l>That muſt be final both to bard and me.</l>
