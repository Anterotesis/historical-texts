            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>REMARKS, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>I Addreſs the following Remarks to you, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I pretend to gueſs at your Perſon, but becauſe I think you are moſt intereſted in them; and I ſend you them plain and ſimple, without prefacing them either with Compliments or Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
            <p>I entirely agree with you in your firſt general Obſervation, (P. 2.) that of moſt, if not <q rend="inline margQuotes">"all Arts or Exertions of human Faculty, thoſe which Dr. Brown has choſen for his Subject are moſt liable to be influenced by a Variety of Cauſes; ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly moſt remote and minute, and moſt difficult to be obſerved".</q> But ſurely your Concluſion is not logical; <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That to think, by laying down one or a few Principles, to deduce the Progreſs of them ſyſtematically, is parallel to <hi>Almanack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers</hi> foretelling the Weather."</q> In my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion the preſent Queſtion is not whether they can be ſolved ſyſtematically or not, but whether Dr. B—'s Solution is juſt or groundleſs: And if
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0169200700:3"/>
you apply this Concluſion to his Work, before you have examined it, your Determination muſt be ranked with the Judgments of thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, where they <hi>behead</hi> a Man firſt and try after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards whether he is Guilty.</p>
            <p>Your ſecond Obſervation is of the <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Unimpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of ſuch Inveſtigations, as being mere amuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gratifications of Curioſity."</q>Yet if you are really in earneſt, how came you (who have affected to diſplay ſo large a Fund of Reading) to have  <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<note n="a" place="bottom">P. 2.</note> employed ſo much of your Thoughts on a <hi>ſmall Part</hi> of this very Subject? And <note n="b" place="bottom">Ibid.</note> if ever you publiſh your Thoughts,"</q>I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to your own Heart, in what Eſtimation you would hold the Man who ſhould tell you they were of  <q rend="inline margQuotes">"no Importance to Mankind, or rank <hi>them,</hi> as you have done Dr. B—'s, with <hi>Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nack-making.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Your third Objection <q rend="inline margQuotes">"of the doctorial Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and Air of Science with which it has been faſhionable of late to advance Conjectures;"</q> is at leaſt not liberal. If Dr. B—'s Conjectures are falſe, it <hi>ought</hi> to be Triumph enough for you to prove them ſo; if on the contrary, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding your Arguments, they prove <hi>true, ought</hi> they not to be advanced with the Confidence of Truth, by a Man who knows them <hi>ſo."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I entirely acquieſce in your fourth Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <q rend="inline margQuotes">"that, ſince Truth is the principal Purpoſe theſe Inveſtigations can anſwer, <hi>Miſrepreſentation</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0169200700:4"/>
or even <hi>Error</hi> in matter of Fact is leſs excuſable in them than in any other Kind of Enquiry,"</q> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in ſuch as <hi>your's</hi> and <hi>mine,</hi> where if we <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſent</hi> either thro' <hi>Prejudice</hi> or <hi>Partiality,</hi> or <hi>err</hi> in Matters of Fact when we would correct the <hi>Errors</hi> of others, then we are <hi>leſs excuſable,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are <hi>leſs honeſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So much may ſuffice for your Preliminaries; The Body of your Work remains now to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</p>
            <p n="1">1. You ſay, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I will not take the Advantage of the obvious Ridicule which ariſes from the ſearching the Seeds and Principles of all the moſt refined and tranſporting Poetry of Greece, in the dreary Wilds of North-America <note n="c" place="bottom">P. 4.</note>."</q>—'Tis indeed out of the common road, for Dr. B. to carry us ſo <hi>far</hi> in Queſt of <hi>Brutality,</hi> when he might have found it ſo much nearer Home, among the old <hi>Pelaſgi</hi> of ancient <hi>Greece;</hi> who certainly were no better than the modern <hi>Iroquois.</hi> We know they were <hi>Acorn-Eaters</hi> and <hi>Man-Eaters:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sylveſtres Homines,</hi> Sacer Interpreſque Deorum, <hi>Caedibus</hi> &amp; <hi>Victu foedo</hi> deterruit ORPHEUS <note n="d" place="bottom">Horace.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This is the moſt we know of them; and this we know of the modern <hi>Iroquois</hi> too, but then we know <hi>a great dealmore.</hi> Now, what we know of the <hi>mordern Iroquois,</hi> Dr. B. on the Foundation of <hi>Analogy,</hi> applies to the <hi>old Pelaſgi:</hi> He attempts
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0169200700:5"/>
to prove by an eaſy Chain of Reaſoning, that in Caſe of a ſuppoſed Civilization of <hi>Iroquois,</hi> ſuch Conſequences might naturally be expected to ariſe, as did actually ariſe in <hi>antient Greece;</hi> and <hi>viceverſa,</hi> that as the <hi>old Pelaſgi</hi> were once in the ſame State as the <hi>Iroquois</hi> are now, they actually did proceed by the ſame Steps as theſe would probably do upon a ſimilar Civilization. The Argument is new I confeſs, but is not therefore to be treated with Contempt. If the Principles on which all Savage Tribes proceed are <hi>always</hi> ſimple, and nearly the ſame in all, making only ſome ſmall Allowance for the Difference of Soil, and Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate: If the Similarity of Cauſes and Effects be too clear and convincing to be denied; in a Word if, even where Variations of Character ariſe, they ſerve rather to illuſtrate than confound the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, certainly any Concluſions properly drawn from ſo amazing an Analogy, muſt fall little ſhort of Demonſtration.—The Method then of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation no rational Man can object to; let us therefore ſee whether Dr. B—has ſuſtained it properly in thoſe Parts which regard ancient Greece.</p>
            <p>You begin with a very material Point, which if once made out would overthrow Dr. B—'s Hypotheſis from the Foundation. You tell us, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"It is taken for granted all along, that the Poetry and Muſic, and Legiſlation, and Religion of Greece, were entirely the ſpontaneous Productions of that Climate"</q> but that <q rend="inline margQuotes">"it is certain, the firſt Seeds
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0169200700:6"/>
of them were imported <note n="e" place="bottom">P. 4.</note>."</q>You then appeal to ancient Authors, and affirm (from them) that Dr. B's Syſtem  <q rend="inline margQuotes">"cannot hold, ſince their <hi>firſt Civilizers</hi> did certainly introduce <hi>foreign Gods,</hi> and <hi>were not the Object of Worſhip themſelves</hi> 
                  <note n="f" place="bottom">P. 5.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To prove that it was otherwiſe, you cite <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus;</hi> and you ſay, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"he aſſures us that the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſgi had no more than ſome general Notion of <hi>a ſuperior Power</hi> who <hi>made</hi> the World <note n="g" place="bottom">P. 6.</note>."</q> Now, how can <hi>You,</hi> whoſe Work profeſſes to be built on the Pillar of <hi>ſtrict Quotation,</hi> how can <hi>You</hi> begin with ſo egregious an Untruth? In your Tranſlation you have repreſented the PE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LASGI <hi>(Acorn-Eaters</hi> and <hi>Man-Eaters)</hi> as <hi>pure Theiſts;</hi> and it ſeems it was <hi>Orpheus</hi> who <hi>after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> debaſed them into groſs <hi>Idolaters</hi> 
               <note n="h" place="bottom">Euterpe, l. 52.</note>. Now <hi>Herodotus</hi> ſays nothing of all this. He men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions not <hi>a ſuperior Power;</hi> but expreſsly ſays <hi>Gods</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) nor does he ſpeak one Word of their <hi>making,</hi> but only of their <hi>governing</hi> the World <note n="i" place="bottom">P. 6.</note>. And is not this a palmary Argument in Proof of their having no Religion, that <q rend="inline margQuotes">"they <hi>worſhiped</hi> the <hi>Gods,</hi> who in their Opinion <hi>governed the World?"</hi>
               </q>—Well: but it ſeems, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"they knew no Name for any Divinity; the Names of their Gods were brought from Egypt; and if their Gods had been their own Chiefs, <hi>their</hi> Names would have been better remembered than
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0169200700:7"/>
any Thing elſe <note n="k" place="bottom">P. 6.</note>."</q> Here, I confeſs with Pleaſure, is ſome Appearance of good Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>But to ſet this Matter in its true Light; and acquaint you whence it probably came to paſs, that the <hi>ſavage Pelaſgi</hi> had no Names for their Gods, I muſt (in Imitation of Dr. B.) carry you once more among your new Acquaintances, the Savages of America.—You muſt know, then, that the ſavage Tribes ſeldom retain the <hi>particular Name</hi> of the <hi>Chieftain</hi> whom they <hi>deify</hi> and <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip:</hi> and the Reaſon of this is, becauſe he ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally <hi>loſes</hi> it even <hi>before be dies.</hi> When he is exalted to the Rank of <hi>Chief,</hi> his former Name is commonly dropped, and a new Appellation is giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en him, ſuited to the Station he is raiſed to: This Title (rather than Name) is generally that of <hi>Father, Senior,</hi> or <hi>Sun</hi> of the Tribe. In Proof of this I might refer you to all the Writers on the Manners of ſavage Tribes: On this Subject, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, LAFITAU and the <hi>Lettres Edifiantes,</hi> will give you ample Satisfaction. Under this State of Things, the ſavage Tribes offer Sacrifice, conſult Oracles, and perform the general Acts of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Religion. This, then, ſeems to have been the idolatrous State of the old Pelaſgi: They probably worſhipped their firſt ſavage Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; for it is clear, on the Evidence of <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus</hi> himſelf, that they offered <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to their Gods, and <hi>conſulted</hi> the <hi>Oracle</hi> of <hi>Dodona,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0169200700:8"/>
they ſhould give the <hi>Egyptian Names</hi> to <hi>their own Deities</hi> 
               <note n="l" place="bottom">Herod. ib.</note>: two Circumſtances which prove even to Demonſtration, that they had Deities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Time of Orpheus.</p>
            <p>You will ſay, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"what then did Orpheus intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, if he introduced not the Gods of Greece?"</q> Why, Herodotus tells us, as plain as Words can tell us: He introduced <hi>Myſteries</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>): and that he might diſtinguiſh the native Gods whom he found already eſtabliſhed by a general Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, he appropriated particular Rites to each; and to this End, very properly diſtinguiſhed each God by a particular Appellation, But ſure, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was Critic ſo unlucky in his Remarks as You: For it has been made appear by a learned Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that theſe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, theſe very <hi>Myſteries</hi> which ORPHEUS introduced to Greece, were ſo far from being the <hi>Beginnings</hi> of <hi>Heroe Worſhip,</hi> that they were intended as a <hi>Detection</hi> (to the <hi>initiated)</hi> of the <hi>Errors</hi> of <hi>pre-eſtabliſhed Polytheiſm</hi> 
               <note n="m" place="bottom">Div. Leg. of Moſes, B. ii. Sect. 4.</note>.</p>
            <p>It appears then, that the <hi>oldeſt Gods</hi> of Greece were ſtrictly <hi>native:</hi> I ſhall now prove that they were the <hi>Chiefs</hi> and <hi>firſt Civilizers</hi> of the ſavage Inhabitants. That they were ſuch, is evident from the Teſtimony of ſeveral ancient Authors, found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Traditions of the Country, which are the only original Evidences that can be obtained in a Caſe of this Nature.—The firſt and chief of theſe was He, to whom <hi>Orpheus</hi> (it ſeems) gave
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0169200700:9"/>
the Name of JUPITER. This old Chieftain was born in Crete: and was brought young by his Mother into Greece <note n="n" place="bottom">Strabo, l. x.</note>. He conquered the <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> (probably another Tribe of Savages, at En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with the <hi>Pelaſgi)</hi> and civilized the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Country which he ſubdued <note n="o" place="bottom">Diodorus, l. iii.</note>. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had vanquiſhed the <hi>Titans,</hi> he is ſaid by ſome Authors to have inſtituted the Olympian Games, in Commemoration of his Victory <note n="p" place="bottom">Pauſanias, l. v.</note>.</p>
            <p>Another of theſe moſt ancient Gods of Greece, to whom ORPHEUS gave the Name of APOLLO, was a Chief who killed the Serpent <hi>Python,</hi> and the Tyrant <hi>Titius;</hi> taught the Inhabitants of Greece the Uſe of the Fruits of the Earth, and civilized the Inhabitants of ſeveral Diſtricts <note n="q" place="bottom">Strabo, l. ix.</note>.</p>
            <p>Two more of theſe ancient Gods of Greece, were the famed Brothers, CASTOR and POLLUX. They were Natives of the little Iſle of <hi>Pephnos</hi> near <hi>Meſſene</hi> 
               <note n="r" place="bottom">Pauſanias, l.</note>; and taught the Lacedemonians the Arts of Dancing and of War <note n="s" place="bottom">Lucian. de Saltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one.</note>.</p>
            <p>Now theſe <hi>four</hi> are the very <hi>ancient Gods</hi> whom Dr. B. has ſingled out, as being delivered down to Poſterity under the Characters of Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, Singers, and Dancers. All of them Chiefs and Civilizers of ancient Greece, in ſome Depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or other of Legiſlation.</p>
            <p>But he might have added ſeveral more. Of this Claſs was MERCURY. He was born in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0169200700:10"/>
Greece <note n="t" place="bottom">Pauſanias Arcad.</note>; was the <hi>Inventor</hi> of the <hi>Lyre;</hi> and is ſaid to have been deified for this Invention <note n="u" place="bottom">Eliac.</note>.</p>
            <p>Another Deification I muſt not paſs over: You have led me to it yourſelf: It is that of BAC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHUS; whoſe Love of Wine, Dance, and Muſic, is too well known to need a Comment. You ſpeak of his Myſteries, as being not of Grecian but foreign Original; and thence you conclude, that the God himſelf was ſo.

            <p n="4">4. But you have not yet done with the old Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Greece: You ſay you remember a <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of ARISTOTLE full in the Teeth of Dr. B's Syſtem: wherein it is obſerved, that "the Poets never repreſent Jupiter ſinging <note n="z" place="bottom">P. 14.</note>."</q>Truly, neither does Dr. B. for he only ſays (on the Authority of a very old Poet) that  <q rend="inline margQuotes">

            <p n="5">5. You next come to conſider Dr. B's Account of the Origin of Poetic Hiſtory: You charge Dr. B. with miſquoting and miſrepreſenting the Author of the Life of Homer, in order to bring him to his own Purpoſe <note n="d" place="bottom">P. 15.</note>.

            <p n="8">8. You now come to the old poetic Oracles of GREECE: So far as the Affair of mere Reaſoning

is concerned, I ſhall again leave you to the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Penetration of the Reader. With Reſpect to the literary Part of the Argument, I at length give you Joy of a ſmall Diſcovery: for you have detected Dr. B. in calling an ancient Prieſteſs of Apollo by the Name of PHEMONOE inſtead of HEROPHILE. I wiſh you had been as ſucceſsful in your next Attack.</p>
            <p>For the main Point worth contending for an this Subject is, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Whether the ancient Pythian Oracles were the Effect of Enthuſiaſm."</q> To prove that they were not, you bring a Story from Homer, who tells us of a wonderful Feat of APOLLO, who 1ſt changed himſelf into a Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin; 2dly, drove the Cretan Voyagers from their Courſe at Sea; 3dly, appeared to them (Qu. in his own Shape, or the Dolphin's?) and told them, they were to be his Sacrificers; 4thly, that the poor Fellows being hungry, he aſſured them, they need not fear for a Subſiſtence; for that he could foretel, they ſhould live comfortably on the Sacrifices: on which, they believed him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came his Prieſts.—Now, on this curious and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic Trait of Hiſtory, which you call <hi>rational</hi> and <hi>probable,</hi> you found the Riſe of the Delphic Oracle.

and lying Romancer, DIODORUS the <hi>Sicili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</hi> Now this Author tells us, in the moſt expreſs Terms, that <q rend="inline margQuotes">"the Riſe of this famed Oracle was from Enthuſiaſm: That the firſt Diviners being ſeized with this, began to prophecy, and were agitated with <hi>wild and frantic Geſtures,</hi> which were ſo violent, that many of them leapt into the deep Cleft of the Earth, near the Place where now the Temple of Delphi ſtands: And that in Proceſs of Time, the Diviner or Pythia, was <hi>confined</hi> to the <hi>Tripos,</hi> as the Means of <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting</hi> the <hi>like</hi> fatal <hi>Conſequences</hi>

As a full Proof, that this was the Fact in the Poems of the ancient Greeks, I need only refer to what Dr. B. has quoted from Plato <note n="p" place="bottom">Diſſert. Sect. v. Art 12.</note>. There it appears at large, that the Poems of their Bards were taught to their Children, as the <hi>Foundation</hi> both of their <hi>Opinions</hi> and their <hi>Manners.</hi> And the very Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is aſſigned by Plato <hi>why</hi> this Method of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction</hi> was <hi>uſed,</hi>

                  <note n="h" place="bottom">P. 47.</note>."</q> But this was not the Place for you to bring that Circumſtance into View; becauſe it would have unmaſked your Battery. Solon was alarmed at a a Change in their poetic and muſical Conteſts, which hitherto had maintained their <hi>ſimpler Form;</hi> and it was probably his high Idea of their <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhed Utility,</hi> which induced him ſo ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to cenſure this <hi>Innovation.</hi> Thus, in the End, this Affair of Solon and Theſpis tends to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm Dr. B's Opinion, rather than to confute it.</p>
            <p>But now you ſuddenly come round, and become quite good-humoured; nay you are willing to lend Dr. B. a Lift; and produce a Paſſage which tends to the Confirmation of his Syſtem <note n="i" place="bottom">P. 34, 35.</note>: For you tell us, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Euripides himſelf is introduced, affirming that the Reaſon why Poets are to be honoured is for their <hi>Ingenuity, ſalutary Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions,</hi> and <hi>bettering</hi> their Fellow-Citizens."</q> This is a Method of Confutation altogether new, and very ingenious: To confirm an Adverſary's Syſtem by Proofs which he himſelf was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0169200700:25"/>
of; and thus to demonſtrate your Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority.</p>
            <p>And now to cloſe this Article in your own Manner, I will alſo produce ſome additional Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denees in Favour of Dr. B's Syſtem; and then I think we ſhall have <hi>humbled</hi> him ſufficiently between us.</p>
            <p>The Doctor muſt know then (for to be ſure if he <hi>had known</hi> it, he would have <hi>ſaid</hi> it) that in the ancient Times of Greece, there was no other <hi>Code,</hi> either <hi>religious, moral,</hi> or <hi>political,</hi> but the Songs of their Bards. If there was even one let Dr. B. produce it at his Peril. Theſe Songs or Poems, then, were indeed the great <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitory</hi> of their <hi>Principles:</hi> having no <hi>real Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> or <hi>Guide</hi> from <hi>Heaven,</hi> they took up with the <hi>beſt they could find;</hi> and hence laid hold of the <hi>Examples</hi> of their fabulous <hi>Gods</hi> and <hi>Heroes,</hi> as the Means of <hi>fixing</hi> the <hi>fluctuating Principles</hi> of their refpective Societies by a certain <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard,</hi> however <hi>defective.</hi> Theſe Songs, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, may, on this Foundation, be properly ſtiled <hi>legiſlative,</hi> becauſe they actually ſtood in the Place of <hi>Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In farther Proof of this, I will give Dr. B. two or three Authorities. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Heſiod and Homer (ſays Herodotus) were they who formed a Theogony for the Greeks, giving Names to their Gods, and fixing their Shapes or Figures <note n="k" place="bottom">Herod.

Conſequence of this, a reſpectable Modern tells us, that  <q rend="inline margQuotes">"the Writings of Homer became the <hi>Standard</hi> of <hi>private Belief,</hi> and the <hi>grand Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory</hi> of <hi>public Worſhip</hi> 
                  <note n="l" place="bottom">Life of Homer, p. 174.</note>."</q>—Another learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Modern expreſſes himſelf in ſtill ſtronger Terms. For ſpeaking of the ancient Greeks, he affirms that <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Homer was their <hi>Bible:</hi> and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever was not <hi>read therein,</hi> nor could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly <hi>proved thereby,</hi> paſſed with them for <hi>apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphal</hi> 
                  <note n="m" place="bottom">Div. Leg. of Moſes, Vol. ii. Part i. p. 52.</note>."</q>Again, He calls Homer and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiod  <q rend="inline margQuotes">"the popular and only <hi>authorized Books of Divinity</hi> amongſt the Greeks; which aſſign the <hi>Names,</hi> the <hi>Attributes,</hi> and the <hi>Form,</hi> to each God <note n="n" place="bottom">Ib. P. 259.</note>."</q> How it happened, that theſe Fables which were ſwallowed in Times of Ignorance, came to be eſtabliſhed in a more knowing Age, this learned Perſon likewiſe inform us. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"The great Poets of Greece, who had <hi>moſt contributed</hi> to <hi>refine</hi> the <hi>public Taſte</hi> and <hi>Manners,</hi> and were now grown into a Kind of <hi>ſacred Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> had <hi>ſanctified</hi> theſe ſilly Tales in their Writings, which Time had now conſigned to Immortality <note n="o" place="bottom">lb. Vol. i. Part ii. P. 303.</note>."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now all theſe Authorities, every one of them tending to confirm his Syſtem, Dr. B. hath igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly omitted; and (with <hi>an a-priori Notion,</hi> as

you elegantly ſtile it) has pretended to be <hi>wiſer</hi> than his Neighbours, and gone about to prove with the moſt conſummate Arrogance that it <hi>muſt</hi> be ſo; and that from the <hi>natural Progreſſion</hi> of <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage</hi> Manners, it <hi>could not</hi> be <hi>otherwiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus ſufficiently humbled Dr. B. by bringing Arguments in his Favour which he knew nothing of; we will now take Leave of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, and proceed to Number</p>

            </p>
            <p>You next charge Dr. B. with writing in that Stile which <q rend="inline margQuotes">"is neither true nor falſe, becauſe he has not preciſely fixed the Point which ſeparates what he calls the <hi>early</hi> from the <hi>late</hi> Periods of Antiquity, with regard to the Uſe of Muſic merely inſtrumental <hi>(y)."</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0169200700:30"/>But it ſeems, you have at length diſcovered a Paſſage, 
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"where Dr. B. ſpeaks of a particular Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod as an early one, in which I will prove that a Separation had taken Place. In a Paſſage from Strabo, he ſpeaks of ſomething done after the Criſſaean War, as done in ancient Times <note n="y" place="bottom">Ib.</note>."</q> Dr. B. ſays no ſuch Thing: Pray, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine his Book once again: He ſays exactly what Strabo ſays: but <hi>unluckily,</hi> you underſtand neither Dr. B. nor Strabo. That Author ſays, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"that in ancient Times, there was a Conteſt of Muſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:"</q>and then he tells us farther  <q rend="inline margQuotes">"that <hi>this</hi> was <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi> at Delphi, after the Criſſaean War."</q> This Dr. B. tranſlates literally from Strabo <note n="z" place="bottom">Diſſert. p. 107.</note>, who manifeſtly ſpeaks of two diſtinct Periods; but the firſt of theſe happening to lie beyond the Depth of your chronological Plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, you have learnedly jumbled them into one. The ancient Times that Dr. B. (after Strabo) ſpeaks of here, were the Times of Apollo, and his immediate Followers.—But of this you will hear more in due Time.</p>
            <p>However, an early Period you are reſolved to find, though it make never ſo much againſt you. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"If this ſhould not ſatisfy the Doctor; Pauſanias, in his Hiſtory of the Pythian Contentions, will tell him of one Eleutheres, whom he mentions before Heſiod, that gained the Prize for <hi>mere</hi>

Dr. B. affirms there was not; and You bring this Paſſage to prove that there was. Now whoever will look into Pauſanias, will find from this very Paſſage, 1ſt, that Eleutheres, becauſe he <hi>could join</hi> the <hi>vocal</hi> with <hi>inſtrumental</hi> Muſic, was allowed to <hi>ſing</hi> the Compoſition of <hi>another;</hi> and Heſiod, becauſe <hi>he could not join them,</hi> was not allowed to <hi>ſing his own</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="bottom">Pauſanias, Phoc.</note>. His not being able to join the <hi>vocal</hi> and <hi>inſtrumental</hi> Melody was regarded as ſuch a Defect in this Poet, as all his eminent Talents could not make up for.

17. Your next Attack on Dr. B. is upon the Subject of the <hi>hymnal</hi> or <hi>lyric</hi> Species: And here you charge him with confounding two Things together, which were eſſentially different: You affirm, that <q rend="inline margQuotes">"the <hi>Hymn</hi> was always written in <hi>heroic Meaſure,</hi> and was the more ancient Form of the two; that the <hi>lyric Ode</hi> was always written in <hi>varied Meaſures,</hi> and was much later in its Production, being no older than the Age of Theſpis <note n="m" place="bottom">P. 42, 43, 44.</note>."</q> You are ſo confident of the Propriety and Truth of this Diſtinction, that you inſult Dr. B. on his Ignorance; and boaſt, that by this Argument alone you have cut and torn his Cobweb Hypotheſis <note n="n" place="bottom">P. 44.</note>.</p>
            <p>Of all the Men of Criticiſm I ever read, You, my Friend, are the moſt unfortunate.

            <p n="19">19. You next proceed to deliver <hi>Your</hi> Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments concerning the Riſe and Progreſs of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy: But as you confeſs that it is no more than <q rend="inline">"what every School Boys knows <note n="q" place="bottom">P. 45.</note>,"</q> I ſhall ſave myſelf the Trouble of commenting on it; This being indeed the vulgar Track of Criticiſm, which Dr. B. has ſet himſelf to expoſe, through the Courſe of his Work. As therefore you offer no new Evidences, but only retail the old ones, <q rend="inline">"which every School Boy knows,"</q> I ſhall leave this Part of your Obſervations to ſhift for itſelf; with this general Remark, which Truth compels me to make, that the Inconſiſtency and Diſagreement of the ſeveral ancient Writers which you quote on this Subject is ſo glaring; that in Fact they overturn each other's Authority, and would induce any unprejudiced Man to go in Queſt of ſome more general and rational Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for the Riſe of Tragedy, than the mere ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental Adventure of Theſpis and his Route: And this, I perceive, is one of the main Purpoſes
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0169200700:39"/>
of Dr. B's Inquiry; with which, if you pleaſe, we will therefore go on.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"To this (you ſay) I have a few Objections to urge.—1ſt, I would fain know, if this be the natural Origin of Tragedy, how it came to paſs that in all Nations, except Greece, the more pathetic Drama is without a Chorus at all <hi>(r)."</hi>
               </q> Critic, be a little more cautious in your Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. In three other Inſtances, where Tragedy has ariſen from Nature, among the <hi>Chineſe,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Indians,</hi> and <hi>Peruvians,</hi> Dr. B. has ſhewn, that in the firſt there is a manifeſt Remnant of a Choir, in the ſecond a Choir actually exiſts, and in the third (that of <hi>Peru)</hi> we know not whether there was a Choir or not <note n="s" place="bottom">Diſiert. p. 166, &amp;c.</note>. So far is it from the Truth, what you aſſert, that <q rend="inline margQuotes">"in all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, except Greece, the more pathetic Drama is without a Chorus."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Again, you object, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"If the Riſe and Progreſs of Tragedy be ſo extremely natural, ſince <hi>every Thing</hi> that is <hi>natural</hi> is <hi>univerſal,</hi> how came this Species of Poetry to ariſe, or be cultivat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Athens only, which that it was we have Plato's Word <note n="t" place="bottom">P. 48.</note>?"</q>—My Remarks on this Obſervation are—1ſt, Every thing that is <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> is not <hi>univerſal,</hi> becauſe there are different Degrees of Civilization and Knowledge among Mankind, which are attended with Accidents or Improvements <hi>peculiar</hi> and <hi>natural</hi> to <hi>each,</hi>

but <hi>not univerſal</hi> or <hi>natural</hi> to <hi>all.—</hi>2. Dramatic Repreſentation was not cultivated at Athens only: It has been cultivated in <hi>China,</hi> in <hi>India,</hi> and <hi>Peru:</hi> though <q rend="inline margQuotes">"we have not <hi>Plato's</hi> Word for it."</q>—3. The Degree of Civilization, and the concomitant Powers of the Mind, may be ſo weak among many Nations, as never to produce the dramatic Form, which was the Caſe among ſome of the Tribes of ancient <hi>Greece,</hi> as likewiſe of ancient <hi>Gaul, Britain,</hi> and other Countries.—4. The Progreſs of Poetry, up to the drama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Form, may be checked by a Variety of Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents either <hi>internal</hi> or <hi>external.</hi> By Accidents <hi>internal,</hi> as among the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> where the firſt rude Forms of Poem and Melody were eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Law, which prevented all <hi>Change;</hi> that is, either <hi>Improvement</hi> or <hi>Corruption.</hi> And again, as among the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> where the Purity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion prevented their Poetry from aſſuming the dramatic Form.—By Accidents <hi>external;</hi> as where War, Conqueſt, a Subverſion of Religion or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment deſtroyed that original Syſtem of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Principles on which natural Tragedy is built: And if, by any of theſe, the original Form of Tragedy was once changed, it could not proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be renewed, by the mere Force of Nature.—I have been the more particular on this Article, becauſe the Objection, though ignorantly made by You, gave Room for a farther Opening of the main Subject.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0169200700:41"/>But 3dly, you object, that 
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"unfortunately it is declared as fully as any thing can or need be, that the <hi>ancient</hi> Tragedy conſiſted of a <hi>Chorus alone,</hi> and without an Actor <note n="u" place="bottom">P. 48.</note>."</q>—I ſuppoſe you mean it was ſo at <hi>Athens;</hi> but does it therefore follow that it wore the ſame Form every where elſe? Dr. B. has prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (in a Paſſage which muſt ſoon riſe up in Judgment againſt you) that even in the <hi>earlieſt</hi> Celebration of the <hi>Pythian</hi> Games at <hi>Delphi,</hi> there was a <hi>narrative</hi> (if not a <hi>dramatic) Epiſode,</hi> divided into <hi>five Acts:</hi> From this Paſſage it far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appears that long before the Time of <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis,</hi> or even of <hi>Homer,</hi> this Epiſode was perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a <hi>ſingle Perſon,</hi> and not by the <hi>Choir</hi> 
               <note n="w" place="bottom">See Hiſt. of Poetry, p. 110, &amp;c. The Paſſage is quoted below, p. 30, 31.</note>. Now if this exiſted at <hi>Delphi,</hi> even <hi>ſoon after</hi> the <hi>Age</hi> of <hi>Apollo,</hi> what is it to the Purpoſe to ſay that it did not exiſt at <hi>Athens?</hi> Dr. B. is inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating the Riſe of Tragedy from Nature and finds its firſt rude Form exiſting <hi>at Delphi,</hi> in or about <hi>the Time of Apollo:</hi> and to diſprove This, <hi>you</hi> moſt philoſophically endeavour to make it out, that it did not appear <hi>at Athens</hi> till <hi>many Ages after.</hi> This is another of your new Modes of Confutation.</p>
            <p>Your 4th Objection is as follows. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"It will likewiſe follow from the Doctor's Syſtem, that the Choral Part would be of Courſe, only an Appendage to the Epiſode; and the Chorus

               <note n="y" place="bottom">P. 49.</note>.—In Reply to this, I ſhall give you the following Paragraph, from Dr. B's Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of Poetry.</p>
            <q rend="margQuotes">
               <p>"By thus tracing the tragic <hi>Choir</hi> to its true Foundation, the <hi>ſavage Song-Feaſt;</hi> we are now inabled to give a clear and eaſy Solution to a Difficulty which hath embarraſſed all the Critics. It hath been held a Circumſtance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable or abſurd, that the <hi>Choir,</hi> in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the ancient <hi>Greek Tragedies,</hi> ſhould be made <hi>privy</hi> to ſome of the moſt <hi>atrocious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,</hi> and yet ſhould not <hi>reveal</hi> them, though its <hi>Character</hi> was confeſſedly <hi>moral.</hi> This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, on the common Suppoſition, that the <hi>Choir originally</hi> made an eſſential Part of the <hi>dramatic Perſons,</hi> is a thorough Abſurdity. But in Reality it appears in the <hi>ſavage Song-Feaſt,</hi>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:0169200700:43"/>
that they who <hi>recite</hi> or <hi>repreſent</hi> the <hi>Action,</hi> are a <hi>Body</hi> quite diſtinct from the <hi>Choir;</hi> and that the <hi>Choir,</hi> in its <hi>original</hi> State, is indeed the <hi>Audience</hi> who ſurround the <hi>Narrator</hi> or <hi>Actor,</hi> and <hi>anſwer</hi> him at every <hi>Pauſe,</hi> with Shouts of <hi>Triumph, Approbation,</hi> or <hi>Diſlike.</hi> This being ſo, how could they (the <hi>Choir</hi> or <hi>Audience)</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly <hi>reveal</hi> any ſecret Deſigns, either good or bad?—To whom ſhould they <hi>reveal</hi> them? To each other?—This was needleſs, becauſe they knew them already.—Muſt they, then, reveal them to the <hi>Actors</hi> of the Drama? This could only have confounded the Repreſentation, and deſtroyed the Plot. It would have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely on a Level with the Practice of an honeſt Country Lad, who was preſent at the Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of OTHELLO: When he foreſaw, that IAGO's Treachery was likely to end tragically for poor DESDEMONA, he called aloud to OTHELLO, <hi>Sir, the Raſcal lies: he ſtole the Handkerchief himſelf.—</hi>This naturally leads to the Elucidation of another Circumſtance. In the Beginning of the Time of ESCHYLUS, the <hi>Choir</hi> conſiſted of no leſs than <hi>fifty</hi> Perſons: Afterwards the Number was leſſened to <hi>fifteen.</hi> How came it to paſs, that in the more barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Periods the Number ſhould be ſo much greater? Manifeſtly (on the Principles here given) becauſe <hi>that</hi> rude Age bordered on the <hi>ſavage</hi> Times, when the <hi>whole Audience</hi> had
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0169200700:44"/>
                  <hi>ſympathized</hi> with the <hi>narrative Actor,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came as <hi>one general Choir.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>"This Solution naturally clears up another Circumſtance, which is unaccountable on the common Syſtem. If the <hi>Choir</hi> were <hi>originally</hi> a Part of the <hi>dramatic Actors,</hi> why were they placed in a <hi>Balcony</hi> or <hi>Gallery, ſeparate</hi> from the <hi>Stage?</hi> No good Reaſon can be aſſigned. But if we ſuppoſe them to have been <hi>originally</hi> the <hi>Spectators</hi> of the <hi>Drama,</hi> we ſee they were in their <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>proper Situation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>"But to this it may be objected, "that the <hi>Choir</hi> ſometimes maintains a <hi>Dialogue</hi> with the <hi>Actor,</hi> in the <hi>Greek</hi> Tragedies; and ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be regarded as a <hi>dramatic Perſon."</hi>—To this (which hath been obſerved above) it is reply'd, that though the <hi>Choir</hi> ſometimes <hi>ſpeaks,</hi> yet this is only by its <hi>Leader,</hi> and then only <hi>occaſionally,</hi> and from <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> to fill the <hi>Place of another Actor,</hi> when no more than one or two are upon the Stage. For this Reaſon ESCHYLUS uſes the Expedient oftener than his Succeſſors, becauſe his dramatic Perſons were <hi>fewer.</hi> But though the <hi>Choir</hi> ſometimes ſpeak by their <hi>Leader,</hi> yet they never take Part in the <hi>Action;</hi> as ſufficiently appears by their not revealing the Secrets of it.</p>
               <p>"It may be urged again, that in the <hi>Eume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides</hi> and <hi>Iketides</hi> of ESCHYLUS, the <hi>Choir</hi> is certainly to be conſidered as a <hi>dramatic Perſon,</hi> becauſe they are indeed the <hi>chief Actors</hi> in
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0169200700:45"/>
the Drama. True; they are ſo: but though this Objection looks formidable, yet on a deeper Conſideration, the Bugbear will vaniſh—ESCHY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LUS was deſirous to repreſent an Action of <hi>fifty Furies,</hi> and another of <hi>fifty Da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Why, ſurely, no other than That which we find he <hi>hath</hi> uſed: To throw theſe <hi>numerous Bodies</hi> into the Form of a Choir; and thus he gained them Admittance on the Stage.—To ſpeak with Preciſion, therefore, we ought to ſay, that the Action of theſe two Tragedies paſſeth <hi>without a Choir,</hi> that is, without any ſuppoſed <hi>Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> who <hi>take no Part in it</hi>

But though <hi>Eſchylus</hi> is ſaid by ſome, to have been the Inventor of the <hi>Maſque,</hi> yet <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> fairly confeſſes that its <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin</hi> is abſolutely <hi>unknown;</hi> and <hi>Clemens Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus</hi> affirms that it was in Uſe, even in the <hi>Times</hi> of <hi>Orpheus.</hi> Theſe Circumſtances are not a little favourable to Dr. B's Syſtem; and ſeem to imply, that dramatic Repreſentation had exiſted in <hi>Greece,</hi> though not perhaps at <hi>Athens,</hi> even as long ago as the Age of <hi>Orpheus.</hi> And it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all Doubt, that a very little before the Age of <hi>Orpheus,</hi> the Time was, when <q rend="inline margQuotes">"the Savages elected the talleſt and ſtrongeſt Men for Chiefs."</q>

Concluſion as faſt as poſſible. Some few ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Obſervations only now remain.</p>
            <p>You charge Dr. B. with an Error in <q rend="inline margQuotes">"in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting that the laſt Inſtitution of the Pythian Games was no more than a Separation of the Gymnaſtic Exerciſes from the Muſical; whereas the Words of Strabo, whom he quotes, are as clear as poſſible, that only the Muſical ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted before, and that the Gymnaſtic and Equeſtrian were then added to them <note n="y" place="bottom">P. 57.</note>."</q> For Truth's and Decency's Sake, do not give Dr. B. ſo many repeated Occaſions of calling your Sincerity in Queſtion. Who would not believe, from the Tenor of this Paſſage, but that Dr. B. in his Quotation from <hi>Strabo,</hi> had ſome how or other diſguiſed this Circumſtance, of the Addition of the gymnaſtic and equeſtrian Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes? Yet, on looking into the Paſſage in Dr. B's Diſſertation, I find it quoted in the <hi>very ſame Words.</hi> Indeed, the Doctor queſtions the ſtrict <hi>Propriety</hi> of <hi>Strabo's</hi> ſaying <q rend="inline">"that the <hi>gymnaſtic</hi> Exerciſes were <hi>added;"</hi> becauſe he conceives they were there <hi>before,</hi> making a Part of the <hi>ancient Muſical</hi> Exerciſes, under the Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Dance</hi> 
                  <note n="z" place="bottom">Diſſ. p. 121.</note>."</q>  This he has attempted to prove by ſome very plauſible Arguments, I muſt confeſs: not one of which <hi>you</hi> have <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</hi> However, what you cannot <hi>diſprove,</hi> you can <hi>miſrepreſent;</hi> which, with ſome Readers, may do as well.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:0169200700:59"/>Again, you charge him with 
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"interpreting as an Account of the Effect of Muſic on Manners, what Plato means only as an Illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of the ill Effects of a licentious demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratic Spirit, &amp;c. <note n="a" place="bottom">P. 57.</note>."</q> On the contrary, Dr. B. has made it appear, by Paſſages quoted from <hi>Plato</hi> himſelf, that <hi>Plato's</hi> Argument included <hi>both</hi> theſe Cauſes. <note n="b" place="bottom">Diſſ. Sect. vi. Art. 31, 32, 33, 34.</note>.</p>
            <p>Another Cenſure is on <q rend="inline margQuotes">"his ſuppoſing that the Writings of <hi>Archilochus</hi> were baniſhed from <hi>Sparta</hi> on Account of their <hi>ſarcaſtic Turn,</hi> which was indeed on Account of their <hi>Obſcenity</hi> 
                  <note n="c" place="bottom">P. 57.</note>."</q> As the Paſſage in Dr. B. is ſhort, I will give it entire; that every one may judge for himſelf. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"The Spartans ordered the Writings of <hi>Archilochus</hi> to be baniſhed from their City, becauſe they thought the Peruſal of them was <hi>dangerous</hi> to the <hi>Purity</hi> of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> 
                  <note n="d" place="bottom">Diſſ. Sect. vii.

                  <note n="e" place="bottom">Ib.</note>."</q>—Seriouſly I am at a Loſs, how to expreſs myſelf properly on this Occaſion; and therefore ſhall briefly ſet down this, as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Inſtance of <hi>your Modeſty.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:0169200700:60"/>
I ſhall now conclude all, with a moſt ſhining Proof of your being eminently poſſeſſed of this great Virtue. After very notably ſquabbling with Dr. B. about a dubious Paſſage in Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon, and quarrelling him for not rendering it exactly as You would have him; you charge him with falſely tranſlating the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the better to ſerve his Purpoſe: You affirm, that this Word does not imply <q rend="inline margQuotes">
                  <hi>"good</hi> and <hi>virtuous</hi> Men,"</q> but  <q rend="inline margQuotes">"only the <hi>rich</hi> or <hi>powerful,</hi> the <hi>better Sort</hi> as we ſay <note n="f" place="bottom">P. 57.</note>."</q>—Now, my moſt ingenuous Friend, turn back to the 34th and 35th Pages of your own Work, and you will ſee a Gorgon's Head, which (if you are not totally melted into Modeſty) will turn you into Stone. Here we find this very Word tranſlated by your good Self, in that very Senſe in which Dr. B. had tranſlated it. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"The Reaſon (ſay You) why Poets are to be honoured is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </q> But <hi>one Claſs</hi> of Men there is, who, all the World agree, either <hi>have,</hi> or <hi>ought to have</hi> GOOD MEMORIES.</p>
            <p>Two or three other Paragraphs there are, on which I might very reaſonably beſtow a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Panegyric: But this laſt contains ſo deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate a Picture of your <hi>amiable Mind,</hi> and of the <hi>generous Motives</hi> that ſet you to work, to criticize Dr. B. that I am unwilling to draw off the Reader from the Contemplation of ſo <hi>ſweet</hi> a Pourtrait.</p>
            <p>Thus, through the Courſe of my Remarks, you ſee I have been very <hi>free,</hi> but very <hi>friendly.</hi> I cannot help congratulating you on your good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, in falling into the Hands of one who has made great Allowances for your Imperfections; and even paſſes over many inferior Blots, which a cenſorious Critic would have hit <note n="h" place="bottom">Of this Kind is a ſlight Miſtake (p. 5.) in your ſaying the <q rend="inline">"Oracle of <hi>Delphos,</hi> inſtead of the "Oracle of <hi>Delphos."</hi>
                  </q> You may knock down your Adverſary with your critical Dungfork, if you pleaſe: but who gave you Leave, without Provocation to break poor <hi>Priſcian's</hi> Head? What would <hi>You</hi> ſay of Dr. B's Knowledge in Grammar, ſhould he affirm that <q rend="inline margQuotes">
                     <hi>"Ariſtotelem</hi> was not ſo profound a Reaſoner, nor <hi>Longinum</hi> ſo ſublime a Critic as <hi>You?"</hi>
                  </q>—Yet this he might have ſaid with the ſame Propriety:—I mean, ſo far as Grammar is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</note>. The more ſo, becauſe you openly profeſs to treat Dr. B's <hi>Errors</hi> with <hi>Severity</hi> 
               <note n="i" place="bottom">P. 55.</note>; whereas mere <hi>Errors</hi> have ever been ſuppoſed to merit <hi>Indulgence.</hi> Add to this, that your Bitterneſs to a Man who has put his <hi>Name</hi> to his Work, while You <hi>conceal Yours,</hi> has (in the Opinion of ſome People) the Air of diſhoneſt Cowardice, and what they will needs call <hi>ſtabbing in the Dark.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:0169200700:62"/>You conclude with a ſolemn Charge againſt Dr. B. of his being 
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"flagrantly guilty of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoting Authors."</q> I wiſh you had better main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained this heavy Charge: I am bold to ſay, that the Inſtances you have produced have turned out to the Confirmation of <hi>his</hi> Syſtem, and little to <hi>your</hi> Honour. Give me leave to put you in Mind of a Paſſage in a certain Book, which relates to a Man's pulling a <hi>Mote</hi> out of his <hi>Brother's</hi> Eye, while he ſees not the <hi>Beam</hi> that is in his <hi>own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will now conclude with a Hint of Advice to you; in which I am ſure I ſhall <hi>deſerve</hi> your Thanks, whether I <hi>obtain</hi> them or <hi>not.</hi> I mean only to exhort you for the future to ſtick to that Species of Criticiſm for which you are apparently qualified. In every Inſtance where you attack the larger Parts of Dr. B's Syſtem, my Regard to Truth obliges me to ſay, that you fail moſt miſerably. But when you get hold of him upon a <hi>minute</hi> Article, you are ſure to pinch him to the Bone. Thus on the <hi>wide</hi> Subject of the old <hi>Greek Religion,</hi> the <hi>Origin</hi> of <hi>poetic Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> the Genius of <hi>ſavage Manners,</hi> the <hi>Riſe</hi> and <hi>Progreſſions</hi> of <hi>Poetry</hi> conſequent on theſe, with ſeveral other large and extenſive Articles of Inquiry, you are totally off your Ground: But to make Amends for this ſmall Defect, you are amply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged by detecting him in the important Blunder
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0169200700:63"/>
of calling <hi>Herophile</hi> by the Name of <hi>Phenomoë,</hi> ſtiling Pindar's Chair a Chair of <hi>Gold,</hi> when it was only of <hi>Iron:</hi> And in the painful and labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Article of <hi>Proſody</hi> or <hi>ſcanning Verſes, Iſaac Voſſius</hi> himſelf is forced to yield to you.</p>
            <p>Now, as you obſerve in the Beginning of your Work, <q rend="inline">"Multi multa poſſunt, ſed nemo omnia."</q>—Nobody can have at once the <hi>microſcopic</hi> and the <hi>teleſcopic</hi> Eye. Therefore, improve the Talent which Nature has given you: If you cannot <hi>ſee</hi>

            <p>With this Advice, I ſhall take my Leave of you; eſteeming it a ſufficient Waſte of Time and Labour, thus for once to have <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſqued</hi> the <hi>empty Parade</hi> of a trifling and diſinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous Caviler.</p>
