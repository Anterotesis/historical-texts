            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>EVERY work on the ſubject of Topography, founded on au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic records, and executed with accuracy and fidelity, has a natural claim upon the patronage of that particular place or diſtrict, of which it treats. The following may in ſome degree boaſt of more extenſive pretenſions, two conſiderations making an Hiſtory of Newcaſtle upon Tyne of general and national im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance: its ſituation, not far from the borders of Scotland, which rendered it one of the principal frontier towns during the hoſtilities with the ſiſter kingdom; and, ſince that unhappy time, its extenſive coal trade.</p>
            <p>The oldeſt printed account of that place, is, a ſmall book in quarto, conſiſting of thirty-four pages, and intitled, "Chorogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, or a Survey of Newcaſtle upon Tyne, &amp;c. Newcaſtle printed by S. B. 1649. S. P. D. dilectis Burgenſibus et probis Hominibus Novi Caſtri ſuper Tinam. W. G."</p>
            <p>The laſt letters ſtand for the initials of William Grey, of whom I have not been able to recover any particulars. — The Greys of Backworth in Northumberland are ſaid to be of the ſame family. This work, an imperfect outline, but which is extremely ſcarce, was reprinted in the Harleian Miſcellanies, vol. iii. in 1745, with ſome additional remarks.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0442300101:5"/>Another ſmall quarto volume on the ſame ſubject, very rarely to be met with, is intitled, "England's Greivance diſcovered in relation to the Coal Trade; with the map of the river of Tyne, and ſituation of the town and corporation of Newcaſtle, &amp;c. by Ralph Gardiner of Chriton (Chirton) in the county of Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland, Gent. London, 1655." It is dedicated to the Lord Protector Cromwell, conſiſts of two hundred and eleven pages, and is ornamented with the heads of ſeveral kings and queens of England. The author appears to have been a moſt pointed enemy to the magiſtrates of Newcaſtle <note n="a" place="bottom">
                  <p>The mayor and corporation of Newcaſtle upon Tyne, in their anſwer to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of Ralph Gardiner to the committee appointed for trade, &amp;c. 1653 (a MS. which I have read), expreſsly ſay that that writer "broke the goale of Newcaſtle laſt ſummer, being there impriſoned for divers great ſums of money, and again impriſoned at the ſuit of the ſheriff of the ſaid town;" and to this they attribute his malicious charge.</p>
                  <p>The MS. Life of Alderman Barnes, which I ſhall often have occaſion to cite, in a note, p. 420, informs us, that, "upon ſome methods agreed on for reformation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the town, according to that clauſe in the charter, which impowers them to make be laws, there was one Gardiner writ a malicious invective againſt the government of Newcaſtle; but he got his reward, being afterwards at York hanged for coyning."</p>
                  <p>Chirton, where he lived, is a village eaſt of Newcaſtle, near the town of Sheilds. "He was," ſays Bourne, "a bitter enemy to this town, and did all the miſchief to it that lay in his power, as appears in every page of his book, in which are numbers of falſities."</p>
               </note>. From each of theſe curious tracts I have adopted in the ſubſequent collections what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I thought worthy of being preſerved.</p>
            <p>With regard to MS. authorities, I ſhall conſtantly refer my readers to the great national repoſitories—the Heralds' and Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation Offices, the Britiſh Muſeum, the Rolls' Chapel, and the Tower of London.</p>
            <p>The Bodleian library at Oxford, the public library, and thoſe of Trinity and Bennet Colleges in the univerſity of Cambridge, were open to my inſpection.</p>
            <p>I found a very copious ſource of unedited materials in the archives of the corporation of Newcaſtle upon Tyne <note n="b" place="bottom">Permiſſion was granted to me in the moſt liberal manner by the late John Baker, Eſq. alderman of that town, during his laſt mayoralty, to inſpect all the records, with liberty at the ſame time to make what extracts I thought proper.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="v" facs="tcp:0442300101:6"/>My honoured patron, the Duke of Northumberland, conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to allow me the liberty of peruſing and extracting what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I found to my purpoſe from many of the valuable records of his illuſtrious houſe.</p>
            <p>I was indulged with the free uſe of a MS. collection, intitled, "An Abſtract in order of Time of the Charters and other Records concerning the Town of Newcaſtle upon Tyne."</p>
            <p>It appears to have belonged to ſome former recorder or town-clerk, but comes no lower down than the fifth year of the reign of King Charles the Firſt.</p>
            <p>I cite this under the name of "the Aubone MS." it having belonged to the late Mr. Aubone, ſecretary to the Trinity-Houſe. A copy of it, taken by Mr. Aubone's permiſſion, is preſerved in the library of John Eraſmus Blackett, Eſq. alderman of New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle <note n="c" place="bottom">That gentleman uſed his utmoſt endeavours, but without ſucceſs, to obtain for me a ſight of the Milbank MS. ſo often quoted by Bourne.</note>.</p>
            <p>I have derived very conſiderable information from a MS. in folio, which I call "the Murray MS." having received the loan of it from a gentleman <note n="d" place="bottom">Mr. George Parker.</note> to whom it was bequeathed by the late Mr. James Murray, attorney at law <note n="e" place="bottom">Mr. Murray ſerved his clerkſhip to Mr. Ord, attorney at law in Newcaſtle.—He was afterwards in the town-clerk's office.—The MS. devolved to him on the death of Mr. Ord. I have ſome reaſons for thinking that the greateſt part of this collection was made by Sir Robert Shaftoe, on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> recorder of Newcaſtle. Mr. Murray died in 1779. See Inſcriptions in St. Andrew's church-yard, in the following work.</note>. It is written in various hands, and evidently at different periods; ſo that probably it has alſo been the property of ſome former recorder or town-clerk.</p>
            <p>I was favoured with the peruſal of a curious MS. by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent poſſeſſor, John Medley, Eſq. alderman of Newcaſtle upon Tyne. It is intitled, "A Catalogue of all the Mayors and She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs of his Majeſty's Towne and Countye of Newcaſtle upon Tyne, with their Coats of Armes and the Reignes of the ſeveral
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0442300101:7"/>
Kinges and Queens of this Land, with certain Briefs of Chronicles that happened in their ſeveral Reigns ſince Anno Domini 1432." I call this throughout the following work "the Carr MS." as it appears to have owed its preſervation to one of that family.— The ſubſequent inſcription is ſtamped in golden letters on the binding: "Robert Carre, Eſq. St. Helen Auckland 1730;" with the family arms: viz. gules, on a chevron argent three mullets fable. This is doubtleſs the identical MS. mentioned by Bourne in page 121 of his Hiſtory of Newcaſtle<note n="f" place="bottom">
                  <p>In the Introduction to the firſt volume of the Archaeologia, p. 25, notes, it is ſaid that Mr. Elſtob, ſon of Ralph Elſtob, merchant at Newcaſtle upon Tyne, who was born in 1673, fellow of Univerſity College, Oxford, and died rector of the united pariſhes of St. Swithin and St. Mary Botham in London, 1714, collected for an Hiſtory of New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle; but what is become of the MS. is not known.</p>
                  <p>For this collection I made every inquiry, but in vain.</p>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>I have occaſionally made conſiderable uſe of a MS. "Life of Ambroſe Barnes, merchant and ſometime alderman of New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle." It is in folio, cloſely written, with a dedication to Sir Theodore Talbot. It contains ſeveral curious anecdotes; but the writer, whoever he was, appears to have been deeply tinctured both with religious and political fanaticiſm.</p>
            <p>The dedication, ſigned with the initials M. R. is dated June 19th, 1716.</p>
            <p>From Bourne's Hiſtory of Newcaſtle upon Tyne, a thin folio volume, which was publiſhed three years after the death of the author, A. D. 1736, a circumſtance which both apologizes and accounts for the various contradictions with which it abounds, I have ſelected whatever I thought authentic and intereſting to my ſubject <note n="g" place="bottom">
                  <p>In the Newcaſtle Courant for November 20th, 1731, are inſerted Mr. Bourne's propoſals for publiſhing this work by ſubſcription: He had advertiſed for materials in the ſame Courant for September 18th, 1731.</p>
                  <p>The poſthumous work was advertiſed ibid. April 24th, 1736, to be delivered to the ſubſcribers on the 3d of May following.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Bourne, after a very lingering illneſs, died about four o'clock in the afternoon of February 16th, 1733.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0442300101:8"/>George Allan, Eſq. F. S. A. of Darlington in the county of Durham, favoured me, in the moſt liberal and polite manner, with the loan of ſeveral volumes of MSS. copied from original records remaining in the church of Durham, and which had been bequeathed to him by the indefatigable tranſcriber, the Rev. Mr. Randall, late of that city, with liberty of making ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts as I ſhould think proper. I cite theſe paſſim by the title of "Randall's MSS. <note n="h" place="bottom">
                  <p>Dr. Hunter of Durham, often mentioned with reſpect by the learned Mr. Horſley, in his Britannia Romana, tranſcribed a great number of records, relating to Newcaſtle upon Tyne, from the archives of the church of Durham, (as I gather from Randall's MSS.) and ſold a copy of Bourne's Hiſtory aforeſaid, with theſe tranſcripts interleaved, to Mr. Akenhead, bookſeller at Newcaſtle, for five guineas, in 1740. This collection was the ground-work of Mr. Akenhead's engaging in the deſign to publiſh an Hiſtory of Newcaſtle, for which he gave out propoſals, not long after the above purchaſe. This intended work was, however, never publiſhed, nor could I by any means procure a ſight of the interleaved copy of Bourne's Hiſtory; but I have every reaſon to think that I found tranſcripts of the ſame records in Randall's MSS. Mr. Akenhead's propoſals for printing by ſubſcription a Hiſtory of Newcaſtle upon Tyne in two volumes in quarto, were publiſhed in the Newcaſtle Journal ſome time in the year 1750.</p>
               </note>"</p>
            <p>I ſelected ſome very intereſting materials from the MS. collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the late George Grey, of Newcaſtle upon Tyne, Eſq. barriſter at law: all of which, together with his library, had been ſold by his executors to Mr. Robert Harriſon, formerly of that town, of whom they were purchaſed (with ſeveral notes, extracts, and references to books, concerning the ſame place, which he himſelf had made and collected in the courſe of his very extenſive reading), for the uſe of the following work.</p>
            <p>Vicinity and other circumſtances once tempted me to hope that, in the courſe of my progreſs in it, I ſhould have profited much by his judicious obſervations; but from the circumſtance of his removing to the ſouth of England, and of my leaving the north before his return, my expectations on that head were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely fruſtrated.</p>

               <pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0442300101:9"/>Sir Matthew White Ridley, Bart. governor of the Merchants' Company, indulged me in the politeſt manner with the liberty of inſpecting the records of that ſociety.</p>
            <p>Alexander Adams, Eſq. ſteward of the Hoſtmen's Company, did me a ſimilar favour with reſpect to thoſe of that fraternity.</p>
            <p>I am indebted to John Eraſmus Blackett, Eſq. for the loan of a curious MS. collection of pedigrees, &amp;c. which formerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the Calverley family, and to their late moſt reſpectable repreſentative, Sir Walter Blackett, Bart.</p>
            <p>I owe the peruſal of Dr. Elliſon's MS. collections, with many other attentions, to the kindneſs of his grandſon the Rev. Natha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel Elliſon, M. A. vicar of Bolam in Northumberland, and lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer of St. Andrew's in Newcaſtle upon Tyne.</p>
            <p>The late George Stephenſon, Eſq. procured me leave to inſpect the old books and other records of the Trinity-Houſe of that town.</p>
            <p>Liberty to examine and collect notes from the pariſh regiſters was granted me in the moſt friendly manner by the ſeveral clergy and keepers of the regiſters in Newcaſtle and Gateſhead<note n="i" place="bottom">I muſt not omit to mention that a collection of neat drawings of monuments, arms, &amp;c. in the ſeveral churches of Newcaſtle, was purchaſed of Mr. Lambert, formerly clerk to the recorder of Newcaſtle, for the uſe of this work; and had the copies of the inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the monuments been as accurate as they ought to have been, they would have anticipated a great deal of my moſt ungrateful labour.</note>.</p>
            <p>I owe acknowledgments for permiſſion to inſpect ſeveral antient MSS. curious deeds, &amp;c. to Thomas Aſtle, Eſq. F. R. S. and S. A. keeper of the records in the Tower of London; to John Topham, Eſq. F. R. S. and S. A. of the State Paper Office; to Craven Ord, Eſq. F. R. S. and S. A. of the Exchequer; to John Caley, Eſq. keeper of the records in the Augmentation Office.</p>
            <p>For various communications in the courſe of the following work, I ſtand indebted to Charles Coombe, M. D. F. R. S. and S. A.; to the Rev. Mr. Penneck, F. R. S.; the Rev. Mr.
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0442300101:10"/>
Southcote, and the Rev. Mr. Aſcough, of the Britiſh Muſeum; to Mrs Adair, formerly Miſs Shaftoe, of Benwell Lodge, in the county of Northumberland; to Hugh Hornby, Eſq. alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of Newcaſtle upon Tyne; to John Davidſon, Eſq. clerk of the peace for the county of Northumberland; to Nathaniel Clayton, Eſq. town-clerk, and Nathaniel Punſhon, Eſq. under-ſheriff of Newcaſtle; to Jonathan Airey, Eſq. to Thomas Davidſon, Eſq. to Jaſper Harriſon, Eſq. to Mr. George Anderſon, architect; to the late Mr. Daviſon, and to Mr. Rutter, attorneys at law in Newcaſtle; to Robert Page, Eſq. deputy comptroller of the Cuſtom-Houſe of that place; to Mr. Ralph Beilby, and Mr. Richard Fiſher, of the ſame town.</p>
            <p>To the ſeveral ſtewards of the incorporated companies of Newcaſtle, I was obliged for the liberty of ſearching in their reſpective archives for their ordinaries and other antient writings<note n="k" place="bottom">
                  <p>I ſhall juſt barely mention, that the late Rev. Mr. James Murray, a diſſenting miniſter in Newcaſtle, undertook, ſome time before his death, to compile a hiſtory of that town; but, having no means of procuring any other information on the ſubject than was to be obtained from printed books, his deſign came to nothing.</p>
                  <p>From motives of delicacy I contented myſelf with this account of his MS. from thoſe who peruſed it, declining, for very obvious reaſon, to read a line of it myſelf.</p>
                  <p>There is a brief hiſtory of Newcaſtle included in Wallis's Hiſtory of Northumberland, and in Hutchinſon's View of the ſame county.</p>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>After pleading, in excuſe for the rough and unpoliſhed ſtyle of the following collections, the rudeneſs of my materials, deduced from the records of barbarous ages, corrupted in many places by the ignorance and inattention of former tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers, I ſhall conclude in the language of the learned pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, Dr. White Kennet:</p>
            <p>"If the preſent age be too much immerſed in pleaſures to take any reliſh, or to make any uſe of theſe diſcoveries, I then appeal to poſterity: for I believe the times will come,
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0442300101:11"/>
when perſons of better inclination will ariſe, who will be glad to find any collections of this nature, and to ſupply the defects and carry on the continuation of it.—I am under no concern to vindicate it from the ſlights and ridicule that may be caſt upon it by idle, witty (his Lordſhip might have added, ignorant) people, who think all hiſtory to be ſcraps, and all antiquity to be ruſt and rubbiſh." Or in that of the great Camden, in the preface to the Latin edition of his Britannia:</p>
            <p>"Si qui ſint, qui in urbe ſua hoſpites, in patria ſua pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grini, et cognitione ſemper pueri eſſe velint, ſibi per me pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceant, ſibi dormiant, non ego illis haec conſcripſi, non illis vigilavi."</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>ANCIENT FORTIFICATIONS, STREETS <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>The oldeſt <hi>Plan</hi> I have ſeen of Newcaſtle is that in Speed's Map of Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. See a fac-ſimile copy of this in a corner of the new plan that accompanies this work. It was deſcribed by William Mathew, who is mentioned in an inquiſition 18th James I. in the account of the caſtle, about the year 1610.</p>
                     <p>A. D. 1723, a Plan of Newcaſtle upon Tyne, dedicated to Matthew Featherſtone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haugh, mayor, the aldermen, ſheriff, and common council of that town, was publiſhed in two ſheets, with twenty-ſix views of publick buildings, by James Corbridge.</p>
                     <p>The plan prefixed to Bourne's Hiſtory, publiſhed in 1736, is without any engraver's name, and ſeems only a copy of the above, with additions and improvements.</p>
                     <p>Gough, in his Britiſh Topography, Vol. II. p. 57, tells us, he was informed, that "a very correct plan (of Newcaſtle) was taken ſoon after the rebellion, by order, and at the expence, of the late Duke of Cumberland, and is now in the hands of Mr. Thompſon, who drew it." I inquired of Mr. Thompſon's ſon, but could neither learn of him whether ever ſuch a plan had been taken, nor into whoſe hands it had fallen.</p>
                     <p>A moſt correct plan of Newcaſtle upon Tyne, and Gateſhead, taken from an actual ſurvey, finiſhed in the year 1770, engraved in two ſheets by J. Ellis, was publiſhed by Charles Hutton, mathematician.</p>
                     <p>Thoreſby, in his Ducatus Leodenſis, p. 497, mentions a <hi>Proſpect</hi> he had of Newcaſtle, drawn by Mr. William Lodge, of Leeds, who was born in 1649, and died 1689.</p>
                     <p>A ſouth proſpect of the town of Newcaſtle upon Tyne, taken from the top of Gateſhead-Church-ſteeple, by Samuel Buck, was engraved and publiſhed in the month of April, 1724.</p>
                     <p>A large north-eaſt view of Newcaſtle was publiſhed by Samuel and Nathaniel Buck, 1715.</p>
                     <p>Grey, in his Chorographia, p. 27, tells us, that Camden makes Newcaſtle upon Tyne 22 grad. 30 min. longitude—54 grad. 57 min. latitude: and that Hues makes it 23 grad. 10 min. longitude—55 grad. 20 min. latitude.</p>
                     <p>According to Dr. Hutton's plan, it ſtands preciſely in 55 degrees of north latitude, and about 1° 17′ longitude weſt from London.</p>

               <p>HARDYNG, in his Chronicle, informs us that Newcaſtle upon Tyne was incloſed with a wall during the reign of William Rufus <note n="a" place="bottom">

                     <p>Bourne ſuppoſes this poſtern in the wall to have been an outlet to the (White) Friars, that they might walk to the Forth and the neighbouring fields, and that it might be of uſe to the caſtle in times of hoſtility with the Scots.

                     <p>The ſubſequent extract from the Newcaſtle Courant informs us how late that town was in adopting the great convenience of having nightly lamps in the ſtreets:</p>
                     <p>"October 1ſt, 1763. Thurſday night the lamps put up in the ſtreets of this town were lighted up for the firſt time."—This was in conſequence of an act lately paſſed for lighting the ſtreets, and other places, and maintaining a regular and nightly watch within the town and county of the town of Newcaſtle upon Tyne, and for regulating the hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney coachmen and chairmen, cartmen, porters and watermen within the ſame.</p>
                     <p>A propoſal was made and publiſhed, A. D. 1755, for illuminating the ſtreets of that town with 150 lamps.</p>
                     <p>Dr. Stukeley, in his Itinerary, ſpeaking of the inhabitants of Newcaſtle upon Tyne, obſerves: "They ſpeak very broad; ſo that, as one walks the ſtreets, one can ſcarce un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the common people, but are apt to fancy oneſelf in a foreign country."</p>

They attempted to build it again the year following, but other crows pulled it to pieces before it was finiſhed. In the years 1785, 1786, and 1787, the ſame crows, as it was thought, built on the ſame ſpot, or rather point, and ſucceeded each year in hatching and rearing their young.

               <p>THE proofs that a Roman bridge <note n="s" place="bottom">
                     <p>Bourne tells us, "The bridge is of great antiquity, undoubtedly as old as the times of the Romans: there muſt have been a communication between this and the other ſide of the river, and therefore there was a neceſſity for it."—The ingenious Mr. Horſley, p. 104, ſays, "I think there are ſome certain and viſible remains of a military way on Gateſhead-Fell, pointing directly towards the part where, I ſuppoſe, the ſtation has been at New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle, and coming, as I apprehend, from Cheſter-le-Street. Dr. Hunter aſſured me he had alſo obſerved viſible remains of ſuch a way. And it is the common opinion that there has been a military way from Cheſter-le-Street to Newcaſtle. This way tends towards the place where the bridge now is. There muſt then have been a bridge in the Roman times over the river Tyne, near the place where the preſent bridge ſtands." Thus far from Bourne.—Horſley's words are, p. 399, Romana Britannia—"That Dr. Hunter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him, that "he had obſerved a military way going off from Watling-Street, near Bincheſter, which he (Dr. H.) ſuppoſed went to Cheſter-on-the-Street, between Durham and Newcaſtle; he traced it to Branſpeth-Park, but could find it no farther." He adds, p. 391, "That the name of Cheſter-on-the-Street does not a little confirm the opinion, that there has been a Roman ſettlement there of ſome kind or other, and that a military way has paſſed from Newcaſtle to it."—He adds farther on this ſubject, p. 451, "The gardener at Couſins'-Houſe told me, that he had obſerved, when he wrought thereabouts, the military way from Newcaſtle to Cheſter-le-ſtreet, and that it lay to the weſt of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent highway, through the Fell. And Dr. Hunter was poſitive that he had obſerved the ſame way upon this Fell: as alſo ſome remaining tracks of a via vicinalis beyond Cheſter, between Bincheſter and Brancepeth-Caſtle (as I remember) pointing towards Cheſter, which he therefore concluded muſt have gone that way."</p>

               <p>An ancient Itinerary, diſcovered ſince they wrote, ſeems to confirm their account beyond the poſſibility of a doubt <note n="u" place="bottom">
                     <p>The Itinerary of Richard of Cirenceſter, diſcovered and firſt printed by Mr. Bertram in Sweden.

Some have ſuppoſed that there was one of thoſe inns at Gateſhead, called, at that time, from the ſign of a goat's head, "Caprae Caput."—But ſee account of "Gateſhead."</p>

                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0442300101:62"/>The Emperor Aelius Hadrian, who connected the forts erected by Agricola, by raiſing the great vallum, that in this part of the iſland extended nearly from ſea to ſea, was probably the firſt that built a bridge at this place; from which circumſtance, the ſtation it led to from the Roman road was afterwards called "Pons Aelii," an appellation plainly derived, as were thoſe of others of his publick works, from the name of his own family <note n="v" place="bottom">
                     <p>"Thus," ſays Pennant, "Jeruſalem was ſtyled Aelia Capitolina," and the games he inſtituted at Pincum in Maeſia, "Aeliana Pincenſia." It may be added, that the bridge which Hadrian throw over the Tyber at Rome, is called to this hour "Ponte Elio Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ano." See Piraneſi's Views.</p>
                     <p>Two coins appear to have been ſtruck upon the building of two bridges by this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror: one is doubtleſs to be referred to that at Rome: may not the other have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to commemorate the work we are now conſidering? One of the bridges marked on theſe coins has ſeven, the other five arches. The Tyber being a very inconſiderable river, when compared with the Tyne, we muſt therefore claim that with ſeven arches— eſpecially as we find a view of the Pons Aelius at Rome in Piraneſi's Collection, without the modern ornaments, where it is repreſented as conſiſting of exactly five arches. See Vaillant, tom. i. p. 68, where, ſpeaking of the coins of Hadrian, he thus deſcribes one of them: "Sine epigraphe Pons Aelius cum ſeptem fornicibus ſub eo plurimae figurae;"— and the other, p. 194, as follows: "Sine epigraphe Pons Aelius cum quinque forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibus."—(Edition of Paris, 1692, quarto.)</p>

                     <p>"I cannot help thinking," ſays Pennant, Tour, vol. iii. p. 313, "that part of the Roman bridge remained there till very lately: for from the obſervation of workmen upon the old piers, they ſeem originally to have been formed without any ſprings for arches. This was a manner of building uſed by the Romans: witneſs the bridge built over the Danube by Trajan, at Severin, twenty Hungarian miles from Belgrade, whoſe piers, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, ſtill exiſt." Of the coins that were found, Mr. Pennant deſcribes the following:— "Coins, poſterior to the time of Adrian, probably depoſited there in ſome later repairs. One is a beautiful Fauſtina the Elder, after her deification—her forehead is bound with a ſmall tiara—her hair full, twiſted and dreſſed a la moderne—round is inſcribed "Diva Fauſtina." On the reverſe is a Ceres, with a torch in one hand, and ears of corn in the other: the inſcription "Auguſta S. C."</p>

               <p>Bourne's reaſoning <note n="x" place="bottom">His words are theſe: "It has been a query whether the bridge was originally of wood or ſtone, but I think it is altogether needleſs: all the bridges in England were ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally of wood.—In the reign of Richard I.

This, I imagine, has been for the building of keys, and eſpecially for the repairing of the Biſhop's part of the bridge, which is a further proof that the bridge, which was the original one, was wood."

               <p>About the year 1559, the very marvellous event related by Bourne, and others, concerning Mr. Anderſon's ring, dropped by accident over this bridge, as he was fingering it, is ſuppoſed to have happened. The part of the ſtory, which ſome have ventured to doubt the truth of, is, that this identical ring was brought back again, after ſome time, in a fiſh bought in Newcaſtle market, by a ſervant of the above merchant, and moſt unexpectedly reſtored to its owner <note n="c" place="bottom">
                     <p>In the parchment fragment before mentioned, ſuppoſed to have been ſtoler out of the archives of the corporation of Newcaſtle, at the riot there in 1740, is entered, by an after inſertion, an account of what is there called "Sir Francis Anderſon's ring," under the year 1559.</p>
                     <p>Yet the writer of Vox Piſcis, or the Book Fiſh, publiſhed in 1627, tells us, p. 13, that this event "fell out in our memorie," to a "citizen of Newcaſtle, whoſe name I take to be M. Anderſon."—He does not mention the kind of fiſh in which the ring was found.</p>
                     <p>In Grey's Chorographia, M. Anderſon is ſtyled an alderman, and the fiſh called a ſalmon, which, ſome ſay, is incapable of ſwallowing any thing ſo large as a ring. See a ſtory ſimilar to this in Herodotus, lib. iii. c. 41.—In Littlebury's tranſlation of that work, it is in vol. i. p. 272.</p>
                     <p>There is another of the ſame kind related in the Engliſh Morery, or Collier's Diction<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, in verbo "Kentigern."</p>
                     <p>Fuller, in his Worthies, takes notice of this event, referring, in the margin, to the Vox Piſcis.</p>
                     <p>Bourne tells us, p. 132, "This gentleman, from whoſe finger the ring fell, was mayor of Newcaſtle, and was anceſtor of the preſent Mr. Abraham Anderſon, merchant, on the Sand-Hill: the ſaid Francis Anderſon made over his eſtate to his ſon, Henry Anderſon, who was the father of the ſaid Abraham's grandfather." He adds, "On the inſide of the ring, juſt under the ſignet, is the picture of a ſalmon, in commemoration of the fiſh and the tranſaction; on the one ſide of which is the letter F. and on the other, the letter A. in commemoration of the perſon," calling it, at the ſame time, "A curioſity ſo great, that not only the whole kingdom cannot ſhew the like of it, but the whole world beſide."</p>

It appears, alſo, that on the above 29th of December, 1778, they had expended above the ſum of 2400l. mentioned in the former Act, for building the temporary bridge, the ſum of 321l. 18s. 9d. more than the tolls on that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary bridge had produced, nor was it expected that the money to be taken for tolls there, from that time to June 24th, 1779, would reimburſe the overplus of expence.</p>

                     <p>November 13th, 1780, the workmen began to pull down the houſes on the weſt ſide of Tyne-Bridge, for the purpoſe of widening the avenue to the new bridge.—Ibid.</p>
                     <p>On the laſt day of April, 1781, the workmen began to take down the temporary bridge.</p>

                     <p>The orders of mendicants were inſtituted, according to the learned Warton, on the following occaſion:—"The monaſtic orders, in conſequence of their ample revenues, had degenerated from their primitive auſterity, and, long before the thirteenth century, were totally abandoned to luxury and indolence. Hence a new order of religious was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, who being deſtitute of fixed poſſeſſions, and of conſequence obliged to rely on their own merits with the people, might reſtore reſpect to the monaſtic inſtitution, and recover the honour of the church."—This order, one and the firſt of the four, is ſaid to have been founded by St. Dominic, a native of Cologna, in Spain, A. D. 1198. Pope Innocent III. approved it in 1215, and it was confirmed by a bull of Pope Honorius the Third, in 1216. By ſome they are reported to have come into England, A.

                     <p>The lane near this houſe, called at preſent Low-Friar-Chare, anciently was ſtyled Shod-Friar-Chare, from the circumſtance of its vicinity to this monaſtery.</p>
                     <p>Grey, who certainly miſtakes in ſaying this was called in old time, "The Gray Friars," adds, that they were called alſo "Bennet-Cheſſie-Friars," a corruption, ſome have thought, of "Benoiſts Chauſsès," <hi>i. e.</hi> "Shod Bennets," from their having adopted, in a certain meaſure, the rule of St. Bennet or Benedict. The only real evidence for this ſuppoſed title (for I do not think they were ever called ſo) occurs in the common-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil books of Newcaſtle, June 1ſt, 1649, in the account of a <q>parcell of ground, called Benny-Cheſſes-Cloſe,</q> in Fenkell-Street, which was, doubtleſs, part of the poſſeſſions of this monaſtery; but I cannot help being of opinion that it was ſo called from the name of the leſſee, after the diſſolution.—In the books of the merchants of Newcaſtle, A. D. 1560, there occurs one "Bennat Cheſſye," an officer of that reſpectable body, and who was buried, as appears by St. Nicholas' Regiſter, October 23, 1587.</p>

Neither of them has the title of knight in the liſt of mayors, but Leland and a MS. which Bourne often cites, "De Reb. Novocaſtr" affix a "Sir" to each of their names. According to Leland, they were both merchants in Newcaſtle, and owners of the lordſhip of Eſhett in Northumberland. "The beginning of theſe "Scotts," he obſerves, "was by merchandice."</note>.</p>

And ſeeing they are in heaven, we may ſay to any of them, our Father which art in heaven. And ſeeing they are holy, we may ſay to any of them, hallowed be thy name. And ſince they are in the kingdom of heaven, we may ſay, thy kingdom come. And ſeeing their will is God's will, we may ſay to any of them, thy will be done. But when the Gray-Friar preaching came to the fourth petition, give us this day our daily bread, he was hiſſed at, and ſo was conſtrained not only to leave off preaching, but alſo to leave the city for ſhame. Yet among the doctors then aſſembled the diſpute continued about the Pater, for ſome would have it ſaid to God formaliter, and to the Saints materialiter.

The maſter anſwers, what ſhall we do then with the Saints? The fellow replies, give them aves and credes enough, that may ſuffice them and too well too."

               <p>Before I enter upon the hiſtory of the Caſtle of Newcaſtle, I ſhall take occaſion to give a brief account of the famous wall of the emperor Hadrian, which ended at the caſtrum of the Roman ſtation of Pons Aelii, and that of the emperor Severus, which paſſed through the ſite of the preſent Newcaſtle, and ended at Wall's End.</p>
               <p>Hadrian's Wall or Vallum, made A. D. 120, was a wall of turf, with a deep foſs or ditch accompanying it on the north ſide: the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal height of it is not known.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:0442300101:167"/>Severus' Wall was built, A. D. 207, of ſquare ſtones, and every where alſo, except on the edges of precipices, was accompanied by a deep ditch or foſs. The original height thereof was 12 feet, and the breadth 8. Between the village of Walker, <hi>i. e.</hi> the town by the wall, and Byker-Hill, the Wall of Severus, with its foſs, are ſtill plainly diſtinguiſhable: the ſite of the wall at preſent is covered with bruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood and ſtunted trees. Dr. Stukeley has preſerved in his Iter Boreale a view of the appearance of the Roman Wall, between Byker-Hill Mill and Newcaſtle, when he wrote. From this mill to the Smith's ſhop near the firſt mile-ſtone on the Shields road, the ſite of the wall and hollow of the foſs, running parallel with the preſent turnpike way, are yet clearly diſcernible.</p>
               <p>At the head of the bank, over-looking Ouſe-Burn, was a caſtellum or exploratory tower, out of the foundations of which I ſaw many Roman ſtones taken, not many years ago, to build an adjoining houſe.</p>
               <p>Coing down the hill from thence to the rivulet of Ouſe-Burn, the foſs on the north ſide of the hedge is ſtill very deep, and forms what is here called a little gill.</p>
               <p>Severus' Wall muſt have formed a ſmall angle at the arch by which it has croſſed Ouſe-Burn.</p>
               <p>On the riſe of the hill between this ſtreamlet and Red-Barns I found, April 3d, 1783, many of the ſquare ſtones which had evidently been the plunder of the wall.</p>
               <p>About Red-Barns the garden grounds have deſtroyed every veſtige both of the wall and the foſs: but when we are paſt the gardens, the remains of the wall ſeem again to appear, and, having croſſed the field, proceed in a ſtraight line, behind the Keelman's Hoſpital, to the Sally-Port, or Ship-Carpenter's Tower. There was a rope-walk here, upon the foundation of the wall, not many years ago.</p>
               <p>Near the preſent Sally-Port Gate ſtood a turret or Roman caſtlellum. From hence the wall, as the foundations thereof, which were diſcovered ſome years ago<note n="o" place="bottom">
                     <p>Thomaſin Scott, an old woman about 60 years of age, living on the Wall-Knoll, informed me April 3d, 1783, that ſeveral years ago ſome workmen, in building a coach-houſe there for Alderman Sowerby, diſcovered plainly the foundations of the Roman Wall coming over the top of the hill, and bearing to the north ſide of the preſent Sally-Port Gate, and that a great many curious gentlemen came to view it.</p>

the line of the town-wall, a little to the north of the Weſt-Gate, where Horſeley ſuppoſes a very ſmall turn has been made in it, in order to come up to the north rampart of the ſtation<note n="r" place="bottom">Horſeley thus determines the boundaries and ſituation of the ſtation of Pons Aelii: "I hinted before that there was a traditionary account of the wall's paſſing through St. George's Porch, near the north-weſt corner of St. Nicholas' church. But it is certain that the line of the wall lies a little to the north of this end of the church, and I think has not touched this porch, though it comes near it. And therefore I conjecture that the wall which has paſſed through this porch muſt have been the eaſt rampart of the ſtation; for the ſuppoſition will reconcile theſe ſeemingly different accounts: and if a line be erected perpendicular to that of Severus' Wall, ſo as to paſs through that porch, and be continued along the brow of the hill, at the head of the ſide, till it meet the line of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian's Vallum, near the caſt end of Belygate, and not far from the Caſtle, this line ſeems to anſwer ſo well in all reſpects, that I cannot much doubt its having been the eaſtern limits of the ancient ſtation: for this brings the ſtation near to the Caſtle, which probably has been built a little more to the ſouth-eaſt, in order to bring it nearer to the top of a ſteep hill. And fixing the eaſtern boundary of the ſtation here, leaves a plain and level area for the ſtation itſelf, and without it, a deſcent towards the ſouth and the river, for the town to ſtand upon, which might extend itſelf to the bridge, ſuppoſing the ancient bridge to have been near the ſame place where the preſent one ſtands. From which bridge the ancient town and ſtation might probably take the name of Pons Aelii. This eaſtern boundary of the ſtation muſt at that time have been nearer the river than it is now; ſince it is certain, that the river formerly flowed farther up towards this part of the town. The poſition of the eaſtern rampart of the ſtation being thus determined, the other boundaries may be alſo defined; for the diſtance here between the lines of the walls ſeems to be about 6 charms, and it is not much to be queſtioned, but the two walls here (as in other caſes they frequently did) have fallen in with the northern and ſouthern ramparts of the ſtation; ſo that theſe 6 chains have been the breadth of the ſtation. And if we ſuppoſe the ſtation to have been of a middle ſize, we muſt make it a ſquare, and allow 6 chains for the length of it. If at this diſtance another line be drawn equal and parallel to the former, and between the lines of the wall, it will be the weſtern boundary of the ſtation, as the two reſpective parts of the two walls make the northern and ſouthern limits. And upon this ſuppoſition, a line drawn from the ſcot of the Fleſh Market to Barly Gate, near the eaſt end of it, will be the eaſtern limits of the ancient ſtation. That part of the vallum which reaches from Baily-Gate to Mr. Ord's houſe, will be the ſouthern limit, and a line drawn from hence to that part of the line of Severus' Wall, which is about 30 yards eaſt from the end of Roſemary-Lane, muſt be the weſtern boundary, and the part of Severus' Wall included between this and the foot of the Fleſh-Market, remains for the line of the northern rampart," page 133.</note> at Newcaſtle, and to get to a ſufficient diſtance from Hadrian's Vallum.</p>

               <p>However that may be, the greater part of our hiſtorians agree that this work was undertaken during the reign and at the command,

               <p>Its having been called, on its erection, the "New Caſtle," ſeems ſtrongly to imply that it aroſe from the ſite of ſome older fortreſs, from which, by way of contradiſtinction, it derived a name extended after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the adjoining town, and which is ſtill retained in its preſent appellation <note n="a" place="bottom">See Bourne.—The Milbank MS. he ſays, tells us, "that this New Caſtle may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed from the old one," <hi>i. e.</hi> the Round Tower, ſince called the Half-Moon Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, which is ſuppoſed to have been a Roman fortreſs, to command the paſs of the bridge over the river Tyne, built by the Emperor Hadrian, and which gave its name to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſtation, <hi>i. e.</hi> Pons Aelii.

               <p>The grand entrance which is towards the eaſt, has had its arch adorned in a ſuperb manner, with zig-zag, and other Saxon or ſemi-Saxon ornaments.</p>
               <p>The wall here meaſured four yards and a quarter in thickneſs <note n="n" place="bottom">Pennant, in his Tour in Scotland, vol. m p. 305, ſpeaking of the place, tells us, "The walls of Roberts Tower are thirteen feet thick, with galleries ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Gothic maſonry.—This had a diſtinct roof, and the whole forms a projection eaſtward at the north-eaſt angle, againſt the eaſt end of which a modern houſe has been built. From the garret of this houſe there is at preſent an entrance into it through an arched paſſage, where there muſt have been anciently a window. At preſent it is a currier's ſhop. From the richneſs of its interior ornaments I ſuſpected it to have been the chapel, to which ſuppoſition its direction from eaſt to weſt is not unfavourable. It muſt however have been but a very ſmall one. Bourne ſuppoſes the chapel to have been within the walls of this keep, on the ground floor, in a place which at preſent compoſes a part of Mr. Fife's very curious and extenſive cellar.</p>
               <p>The great entrance ſeems to have led immediately into the ſtate apartments <note n="o" place="bottom">"The room," ſays Bourne, "this grand entrance leads into, has its floor broken down cloſe to the caſtle-wall, as indeed all the other floors are, to the top of the caſtles ſo that, excepting the floor above the county-gaol, there is not one left, though there have been five diviſions or ſtories of the caſtle beſides this. This floored room, flagged by William Elliſon, Eſq. mayor of Newcaſtle, in 1723, ſeems to me, without any doubt, to have been the common hall of the caſtle—becauſe, on the north ſide of the ſame room there is an entrance by a deſcent of ſome ſteps, into one where is the largeſt fire-place I ſaw in the caſtle, which plainly ſpeaks it to have been the kitchen."—Near this kitchen Bourne ſuppoſed he could alſo trace the pantry and cellar.—"On the ſouth of this room," ſays Bourne alſo, "there is an entrance into a ſort of a parlour, or withdrawing-room, which has a fire-place in it, which has been a piece of curious workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as is viſible to this day. And this place has no communication with any part of the caſtle but this room."</note>, which have been lighted from the eaſt, by the moſt mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent window in the whole great tower. Near this, and in the body of the wall, is an apartment with a curious draw-well in it—at ſixteen yards depth <note n="p" place="bottom">The water was two yards lower in Bourne's time.</note> we reached the water. The depth in all is thirty-one yards and a quarter. The water is hard and very cold. There are ſquare cavities in the wall on each ſide of this well, in which are round holes for pipes, uſed anciently to convey the water to the ſeveral apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. It meaſures eleven yards to the ground from the window of the apartment that contains the well.</p>
               <p>There is no way at preſent to the top of this keep, where one is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed

to find a little artificial garden, producing apple-trees, roſe-buſhes, &amp;c. except by one great winding ſtair-caſe, about two yards wide, in the north-eaſt angle. There is another ſtair-caſe <note n="q" place="bottom">Thus King, ut ſupra, p. 390—ſpeaking of Canterbury caſtle, he tells us, "There are two circular ſtair-caſes in the corners."</note> in the ſouth-eaſt angle, but it is now built up at the top. It has come down to the ground floor, at which place alſo the communication is now cloſed up.</p>
               <p>By the rows of ſquare holes in which the beams have reſted, there muſt have been five ſtories of apartments, of which the great hall and ſtate rooms were the loweſt, from the preſent flagged floor to the top of this tower.</p>
               <p>There is a gallery of communication in the center or thickneſs of the wall, and on all four ſides of it, about five yards and a half<note n="r" place="bottom">
                     <p>Thus King, ut ſupra, p. 379—"Within the thickneſs of the wall—a gallery—that orders might be ſpeedily communicated to all parts.—And there was beſides another ſmaller and narrower gallery within the thichneſs of the wall in the floor above."</p>
                     <p>Speaking alſo of Guildford caſtle, he ſays, "There are alſo galleries in the thickneſs of the wall, as at Rocheſter."</p>
                  </note> from the top. This paſſage is about two yards and a half high, and has three or four loup holes on each ſide, all widening gradually inwards.</p>
               <p>Below this in the ſouth front is a gallery in the center of the wall, about fifteen yards and three quarters from the ground, in which there have been two large ornamented windows—nearly on a level with which on the north front is another window of the like ſort.</p>
               <p>Two great windows have let in light to the great hall <note n="s" place="bottom">"Theſe great rooms," ſays King, ut ſupra, p. 378, 379, "were undoubtedly hung with arras."</note> of this keep; that in the ſouth front, near the ſouth-weſt angle, having had the pillar or diviſion in it broken away, has now the appearance of a door-way. A door hardly half its ſize is at preſent hung in it. The other window is very obſervable: it is on the weſt ſide near the ſouth-weſt angle.</p>
               <p>The kitchen of this great tower has been in the north wall: it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a much larger fire-place than any other of the apartments. The chimney appears on the outſide of the wall by a ſquare projection,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0442300101:206"/>
ending abruptly, and yet I know not with any degree of certainty whether ever it has been carried up any higher: one of its windows has been enlarged with great labour, to give more light to a joiner's ſhop, into which it has been converted.</p>
               <p>The north-weſt angle of this tower is of an hexagonal form <note n="t" place="bottom">"Neither do they ſeem to have confined themſelves to any particular figure in their towers; ſquare, round, and polygonal oftentimes occurring in the original parts of the ſame building." Groſe, ut ſupra, p. 5.</note>, and projects in a manner different from any of the others <note n="u" place="bottom">Thus King, ut ſupra, p. 388.—"The outlets to the ſinks and other conveyances of filth were nearly in the ſame manner (as the chimneys), only reverſed and going down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards."</note>. In the wall of the weſtern front have been ſeveral neceſſary-houſes, communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the great drains.</p>
               <p>All the apartments of the ground-floor, and the county-priſon itſelf, except when uſed at the aſſizes, have been converted into cellars: a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for which their great coolneſs renders them very fit.—There is a place here, into which if water be poured in the largeſt quantities, it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately diſappears.—It probably communicates with one of the large drains.</p>
               <p>In the center of the preſent county priſon is a remarkable pillar, from which arches branch out very beautifully on all ſides. This co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn is hollow, and a pipe has <note n="v" place="bottom">"Having a hollow in the middle," ſays Bourne, "of a foot wide, with a lead ſpout in the ſide of it."</note> conducted water down through it from the well before-mentioned. There is a very obſervable window <note n="w" place="bottom">
                     <p>"Windows," ſays he, "were ſo contrived, that it was almoſt impoſſible for any wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon to be ſhot into the room, ſo as to do any hurt: for if it went at all aſcending, it would ſtrike againſt a low arch, purpoſely contrived over every window, and could not enter the room at all." King, ut ſupra, p. 374.</p>
                     <p>I know not which is the houſe, which, Bourne ſays, was anciently the county-gaol, and underneath which, he adds, "It is reported there is a vault which leads to the caſtle."— "There is indeed a large door," he continues, "ſtill to be ſeen, which was perhaps the entrance into it: and Mr. George Grey, the preſent poſſeſſor, told me that it was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſo becauſe he had put down through his own ſloot a bailiff's rod, to the very end, and could find no bottom."</p>
                     <p>I know not on what authority Bourne reſts his information when he tells us that the caſtle-gate (I ſuppoſe he means the Black-Gate) was begun to be built by one George Hayroy, but was finiſhed by one John Pickle, who kept a tavern in it.</p>

               <p>Great alterations muſt have been made in the appearance of the low parts of the ſouth front, when the temporary priſon of the county was made in this keep. The preſent entrance, to which we deſcend by four or five ſteps, muſt have been firſt made on that occaſion, for there is no arch over it in the wall. Another ſimilar kind of entrance on the eaſtern ſide of the ſouth-eaſt angle, which is now built up, with a ſwine-ſtye before it, is alſo, without doubt, of a date much poſterior to that of the original building.—</p>
               <p>If there has been a dungeon in this keep, as there probably was, I mean that dreary kind of manſion, to which the only entrance was by a ſquare hole in the top, it muſt have been filled up, as no traces thereof can be diſcovered at preſent.</p>

               <p>TRINITY Chapel. Sir Adam de Athol, and his wife Mary, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a very large ſtone, which has originally been plated very curiouſly with braſs. The remains of their effigies are ſtill to be ſeen.—He is pictured at length in armour, having a ſword on his left ſide, and a dagger on his right.—Her effigy hath nothing remaining of it but from the ſhoulders upwards.—The arms of both their families are ſtill to be ſeen on the tomb-ſtone.</p>
               <p>What remains of the inſcription is this: "Hic jacent Dominus Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marus de Atholl miles &amp; Domina Maria uxor ejus quae obiit quarto decimo die menſis ..... anno Domini milleſimo tricenteſimo...... Animarum propitietur."—The remaining part of the date is broken off: Grey, however, in his account of this ſtone, tells us, it was in the year 1387, which is very probably the time that his wife died; for it is a miſtake that he died then, as appears by the indulgence above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned.—Bourne.</p>
               <p>There was, very lately, on this ſtone, inlaid with braſs, a ſhield with arms, as quartered at this day by the Dukes of Athol.</p>

               <p>The account of this, evidently the oldeſt of the monaſtic buildings here, of which any veſtiges are now to be found, cannot be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly prefaced with a ſhort hiſtory of the firſt introduction of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity into this part of the iſland.</p>
               <p>Bede, the father of our church hiſtory, who was born in this north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern extremity of England, fixes this great event to A. D. 627 <note n="d" place="bottom">See Smith's Bede, lib. ii. cap. 14.</note>.</p>
               <p>The place now called Newcaſtle upon Tyne he mentions, 26 years afterwards, as the ſcene of occurrences inſtrumental, in no common degree, to the general propagation of our religion throughout the whole iſland, by the name of "Ad Murum <note n="e" place="bottom">See under "Annals and Hiſtorical Events," the proofs that "Ad Murum" was neither "Wall-Town,"—"Walbottle," nor "Benwall," but ſtood upon part at leaſt of the ſite of the preſent Newcaſtle upon Tyne.</note>" (<hi>i. e.</hi> At Wall), as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence of the then Chriſtian King of Northumberland, and where two other royal converts became ſuch by the initiatory rite of baptiſm.</p>

Struck with the excellence of the doctrines of this new faith, which were warmly recommended to him on the occaſion by his friend Alchfrid, the natural ſon of Oſwy, who had married Cyniburga his ſiſter, he declared himſelf a convert by conviction; and having been baptized, together with his retinue, by Finan, Biſhop of Lindisfarn, obtained a bride, with whom he may be ſaid to have received a truly royal dower, and who would, doubtleſs, encourage him in the promulgation of the Chriſtian faith, throughout his extenſive dominions. There accompanied him on this miſſion of converſion from the court of the Northumberland King, four prieſts, Cedda, Adda (brother of Uttanus, abbot of Gateſhead), Betti and Dinmi, to teach and baptize his Mercian ſubjects, on their return home.</p>

               <p>To the ancient name of our town, "Ad Murum," ſucceeded the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation of Monk-Cheſter: it is uncertain at what period this new title took place, which has generally been interpreted "The fortified reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of perſons of the monaſtic order,<note n="i" place="bottom">"Sir Robert Shaſtoe (a former recorder of Newcaſtle) was of opinion that Monk-Cheſter had its name from the neighbouring monks' retiring to it for occaſional protection in times of danger and devaſtation."

However this may have been, we are certain, from the cleareſt teſtimony of hiſtorians, that monks, in more than ordinary numbers, reſided at it, and learn farther that neither the idea of local ſanctity with which we have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed its then inhabitants to have been impreſſed, nor the military

                     <p>The following entry concerning this place occurs in the ſee-farm rolls, remaining in the Augmentation-Office: "Parcell of the poſſeſſions of the houſe of nunnes within the towne of Newcaſtle upon Tyne—A free rent or tenth reſerved for lands in Nonne-More granted to William Barrantyne, Kenelme Throgmorton Gen. and Henrie Annet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by lettres patent of King Henry the VIII. dated at Hampton-Courte the 4th of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt in the 36 yeare of his raigne yeilding yearely at the feaſt of St. Michaell th' Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angell on for ever 2s. 4d. a free rent iſſueing out of the mannor of Halliwell alias Harwell by the yeare 3s. 4d."—In the writs claiming the rents of old and new farms, &amp;c. due to the crown, and ſtill continued to be ſent annually to the ſheriff of Newcaſtle upon Tyne, I found (inter alia) the following article:

                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:0442300101:263"/>It became afterwards the property of Lady Gaveere, who ſold it to Robert Anderſon <note n="b" place="bottom">It was ordered to be ſold by Henry Anderſon (probably the ſon of this Robert), as appears by the following clauſe in his will:—"Within three yeares next after my death make ſale of my houſe, land and orchards with the appurtenances, called the Nuns of St. Bartholomew in Newcaſtle."—Vid. Lib. Teſtamen. N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 68, in Conſiſt' Dunelm.</note>: after this it became ſo great a receptacle of Scots, and others not free burgeſſes of the town, perſons who, during the odium that prevailed at that time againſt foreigners, were not accounted the moſt reſpectable neighbours, that Mr. Anderſon thought proper to pull it down, in order to diſlodge them.

               <p>Within our own memory it belonged to the late Sir Walter Blackett, Bart. and after his death was ſold, A. D. 1783, to Mr. George An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſon <note n="d" place="bottom">

               <p>The exact ſite of this nunnery is now unknown <note n="e" place="bottom">
                     <p>Two great houſes are marked out hereabouts in Speed's Plan of Newcaſtle, 1610— one is called "King's Lodgings,"—the other, "The Manor," a part of the Nuns.— I ſhould think it ſtood near the ſpot where a play-houſe has ſince been erected. Indeed the play-houſe ſeems ſupported by part of the north-wall of St. Bartholomew's church, in which the north door-way, built up with ſtone, is ſtill obſervable; ſo that where once theſe daughters of celibacy and retirement heard their maſſes, Thalia and Melpomene now laugh and weep by turns, and farces of another kind have ſucceeded to the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious rites of papal Rome.</p>
                     <p>The above play-houſe, erected by Mr. William Parker, maſter of the Turk's Head Inn, was finiſhed in the latter end of the year 1748.</p>
                     <p>On a view of the Nuns in 1777, I diſcovered that part of the meadow which, Bourne tells us, was filled up to make the ground level—part ſeems to have been left in its original ſtate, in order to preſerve a very fine well—this has occaſioned a remarkable artificial hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. I found alſo the iſſues of the two great conduits, where Lamborn and Lorkburn unite in the deen.—One of them points up towards Fickett-Tower, where it paſſes through the town-wall, and the other towards Execution-Dock.</p>
                  </note>: Bourne, as I
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0442300101:264"/>
think, erroneouſly ſuppoſes, that the paſſage ſtill called Nun-Gate was not the grand entrance to it. Here very lately remained part of a great arch, that once formed a gateway, very unlike that of a back paſſage; eſpecially when we conſider the general poverty of ſtyle in building that prevailed at the time when this was erected.</p>
               <p>The popular tradition, of a ſubterraneous communication with a neighbouring monaſtery, prevailed here alſo <note n="f" place="bottom">See Groſe's account of Godſtow nunnery, in Oxfordſhire: there is a ſimilar tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſubterraneous paſſage under the Thames, from Syon nunnery to the friary of Sheen, now called Richmond, in Surry.</note>: this was ſaid to have been made for purpoſes that we ſhall but hint at, and to have ended at the houſe of Black-Friars. Some large vaulted drain has probably given riſe to the charge againſt our fair and, as it ſhould ſeem by this account, frail ſiſterhood, and it has owed its ſupport to the ill-nature of religious party, than which no ſpecies of rancour has been found to be more malignant.</p>
               <p>Among Fairfax's Views, publiſhed in the time of the civil wars, and now extremely rare, there occurs a ſmall one of the then remains of this nunnery, inſcribed at bottom, the "Nunns Newcaſtle <note n="g" place="bottom">I have cauſed a fac ſimile of this to be engraved.

               <p>Nearly at the end of the Pudding-Chare, the ſtreet called Bigg, or Oat-Market, is ſeparated into three diviſions; of which that next to Weſt-Gate is called the Meal, or Groat-Market <note n="h" place="bottom">An order of common-council, dated June 20th, 1743, confined the meal-ſellers, &amp;c. to ſell their commodities in this ſtreet, "the auncient and accuſtomed markett-place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the ſale of meal and groats."</note>; that next to Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim-Street, the Fleſh-Market; and the ſtreet between the two former is properly called the Middle-Street.</p>

                     <p>St. Nicholas was Biſhop of Myra, a city in Lycia, a province of Aſia Minor; he lived about the beginning of the fourth century, and during the perſecution of Licinius the Roman Emperor, was ſent into baniſhment: but after the death of that tyrant, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſited his dioceſe, and threw out all the idols which he found in it. He is ſaid to have aſſiſted at the general council of Nice, where he ſtrenuouſly oppoſed the Arians. He commemorated on the ſixth of December.</p>
                     <p>Bourne ſays, that in his time a large flag, which was the firſt ſtep into the church, at the north door, was cut all along the ſurface with uneven lines, in imitation of the waves of the ſea, as a ſilent remembrancer of this Saint, ſo famous among ſome for his miracles and apparitions by ſea, that he has merited the title of the Patron of the Sailors.</p>
                     <p>There is a perſpective view of "St. Nicholas' church in Newcaſtle upon Tyne," in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to Lord Crew, Biſhop of Durham. W. Horſeley, del.</p>

                     <p>See afterwards under Henry I.</p>
                     <p>Yet perhaps it was ſo called by way of eminence: for we find, that although in the ordering of the vicarage by Hugh Pudſey, Biſhop of Durham, A. D. 1194, it is called "the church of St. Nicholas, of Newcaſtle upon Tyne;" yet afterwards, in the year 1248, it is ſimply ſtyled, "the church of Newcaſtle," when that of St. Andrew appears to have been built by unqueſtionable evidence.</p>
                     <p>However that may have been, it was certainly the mother, or pariſh-church, to which the other three were no more than parochial chapels, built, it is probable, at different pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods, as the town was enlarged or became more populous.</p>
                     <p>The reſpective limits of the four pariſhes, or parochial diſtricts, in Newcaſtle upon Tyne, are ſaid to have been ſettled in the year 1220, if we may credit an account in Warburton's MS. collections remaining in the archives of the Duke of Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland.</p>

                     <p>It is probable that the body of the church was new roofed at the ſame time, as there remain at preſent on the roof timbers the arms of ſeveral families the chiefs of whom were magiſtrates of the town about that time—ſuch as thoſe of Harding, Carlell, Lawſon, Baxter, Lockwood, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>The original tower appears to have had a battlement of open ſtone work and embraſures like thoſe ſtill remaining on the top of Durham Abbey. At preſent this part is built up with bricks, which probably was done at the erection of the upper ſtructure.

               <p>THE holy table or altar, which in the primitive and in the late re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming times was made of wood, in the middle corrupted times was generally compoſed of ſtone, "as more correſponding with the import of an altar, whereon the ſacrifice of the maſs was and is ſtill offered up in the Roman church <note n="u" place="bottom">Staveley on Churches, p. 207.</note>."</p>

               <p>The font of this church, with a wooden cover to it of very light and elegant workmanſhip, has either been made or repaired by Robert Rhodes, the builder of the upper part of the ſteeple: for his coat of arms, with another, probably his wife's, is ſculptured on the baſis <note n="z" place="bottom">

We are favoured with the following deſcription of the elegant monument, lately erected in St. Nicholas' church, in this town, to the memory of Matthew Ridley, of Blagdon and Heaton, in the county of Northumberland, Eſq.—A figure in ſtatuary marble, as large as life, bearing a reſemblance of the features and perſon of the late Mr. Ridley (at the period to which the medallion and inſcription allude), is repreſented in a Roman habit, ſitting in the curule chair, the ſeat of magiſtracy, with a ſerious, but placid countenance, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering of the general welfare of the people over whom he preſided; under the chair are placed the ſcales and faſces, as emblems of juſtice and authority; beneath this is the entablature, containing the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſcription: "To the memory of Matthew Ridley, Eſq. of Blag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Heaton, in the county of Northumberland, ſenior alderman of the corporation of this town, and governor of the company of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant-adventurers. He four times ſerved the office of mayor, in which ſtation, in the year 1745, he rendered eſſential ſervice to his country; averting, by his prudence and activity, the attack meditated againſt this town, by the enemies of the Houſe of Brunſwick, and thereby materially checking the progreſs of their arms. He was unanimouſly elected by his fellow burgeſſes to repreſent them in five ſucceſſive par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, and retired from that ſituation when the declining ſtate of his health rendered him incapable of conſcientiouſly fulfilling the duties of it. He lived reſpected and beloved, and died unfeignedly lamented, April 6, 1778. Aged 66."</p>
               <p>"The baſe of the monument is formed by a medallion, on which the town of Newcaſtle is repreſented by a female figure, crowned with turrets, having a ſhield by her, bearing the arms of the town; near her is an urn, from which are ſeen iſſuing ſalmon, the peculiar attribute of the river Tyne, attacked by Rebellion, who, treading on the crown and ſceptre (enſigns of royalty), bears in one hand the torch of ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:0442300101:317"/>
in the other the ſword of deſtruction: in an attitude of ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ſhe inclines herſelf towards an armed figure, who protects her with his ſhield, and with a ſword in his right hand reſiſts the figure of Rebellion; on the ſhield are repreſented the arms of the family of Ridley; the helmet is ornamented with a bull, which is the creſt. As a finiſhing, under the medallion two cornucopias are introduced, repreſenting the general effect of plenty (attendant on the care of active magiſtrates), connected by a civic crown, the reward amongſt the Romans of civil virtue. The figure is placed againſt an obeliſk of white marble, eight feet high, on the top of which is a very elegant urn, bearing the family arms emblazoned; and on the foot of it is engraved the motto, "Conſtans Fidei." The whole is relieved by a ground of dove-coloured marble.</p>
               <p>"We feel it a juſtice we owe to the ſuperior abilities of the artiſt, to add, that this elegant monument was executed by John Bacon, Eſq. of the Royal Academy, whoſe natural genius, unaſſiſted by foreign travel, has raiſed him decidedly to the firſt rank in his profeſſion, and has enabled the preſent day to vie with the moſt celebrated ages of antiquity in works of ſculpture. The many invaluable proofs of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence with which this artiſt has enriched his native country, as well as foreign lands, it is unneceſſary here to enumerate; until the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent monument in Weſtminſter-Abbey, deſigned and executed by him, to the memory of the late Earl of Chatham, ſhall moulder into duſt, his fame will be had in remembrance <note n="*" place="bottom">Newcaſtle Courant</note>."</p>

(See alſo lecturers of the other churches.) "The ſalaries were not one and the ſame, but added and increaſed as the town thought fit. Upon this firſt ſettlement they had thoſe ſalaries out of the town for preaching in the forenoon, and the pariſh did contribute for their preaching in the afternoons. Some time after the town of Newcaſtle made an addition to the former ſalaries, and gave them an allowance for preaching both forenoon and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon; upon which augmentation the pariſhes gave no farther contribution. In this ſtate have the lectureſhips continued ever ſince, with an alteration ſtill of ſalaries, more or leſs as there was occaſion, and at the will and pleaſure of the patrons. And when any vacancy happened in any of the churches of the town, the mayor, aldermen and common-council of Newcaſtle from time to time have choſen another in ſuch room and ſtead, and the Biſhop of Durham for the time being did always hitherto allow and approve of, by licence, ſuch perſon ſo choſen, being duly qualified.</p>

                     <p>In November 1723, the town of Newcaſtle gave publick notice for all papiſts to take the oaths of allegiance to his majeſty, and for this purpoſe adjourned the ſeſſions.</p>

               <p>A Mr. Walſh is ſaid to have been prieſt at the chapel in Gateſhead, which was afterwards removed to a houſe that once belonged to Sir John Marley, the celebrated loyaliſt, in the ſtreet called the Cloſe.</p>
               <p>The chapel in the Nuns was removed to a place, the entry to which is near the Black-Horſe-Pant, in the Bigg-Market, where Mr. Cordell at preſent officiates.</p>
               <p>The chapel in the Cloſe has alſo been removed ſince that time to a houſe near the foot of Weſt-Gate, at which Mr. Warilow is the preſent officiating prieſt.</p>
               <p>From the head of the ſtreet called the Side, to about the middle of it, there is a very ſteep deſcent: this name is plainly derived from the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of its being erected on the ſide of a hill. About half-way down it becomes more than double its breadth in the ſteep deſcent.
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:0442300101:364"/>
Bourne tells us, that the eaſt ſide of the wider part was anciently called "Cordiner, or Cordwainer-Rawe <note n="z" place="bottom">
                     <p>See the deſcription of Gunner-Tower-Ward.—It is plain from thence that All-Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Pant and Cordiner-Place have been near the head of what is now called the Butcher-Bank; as alſo that the weſt row of the Side, from Cale-Croſs to Painter-Hugh, was called "Fleſher-Rawe," <hi>i. e.</hi> Butcher-Row.—The "going downwards," which ſeems to have miſſed Bourne, is meant for the deſcent from All-Saints' church to the Cale-Croſs.</p>
                     <p>The following entry occurs in the Harleian MSS. 708, eſchaets 1 Ric. II. "Andreas de Tyndale fuit ſeiſit' die quo obiit de una ſhopa in villa Novi Caſtri ſuper Tynam in le Fleſhewer-Rawe quam tenuit de Domino Rege in libero burgagio per ſervicium unius oboli per annum et de una placea terrae vaſtae in le Coke-Rawe quam tenuit de Rege in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bero burgagio per ſervic' 2d. per annum."</p>
                  </note>."</p>
               <p>There was a poſtern, called the Eaſtern-Poſtern of the Caſtle, that communicated by a very narrow and ſteep flight of ſteps with the Side, a little above the middle of that ſtreet.—See account of the Caſtle.</p>
               <p>A little above, on the oppoſite ſide, we deſcended by a ſmall flight of ſteps into a ſhort narrow lane, which communicated with the bottom of the ſtreet called Painter-Hugh. Bourne ſuppoſes that this was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently called Swinburn-Place <note n="a" place="bottom">
                     <p>It muſt have been ſomewhere hereabouts.</p>
                     <p>See account of Pink-Tower-Ward, which included "all the weſt rawe in the Side unto a great waiſte upon the Caſtel-Hugh ſumtime called Olde Laurence Acton's Waiſte, now Thomas Heryng's foreanents a pant afore Swinborne's doore upon Lorke-Burne." This too is the pant which Bourne has erroneouſly called All-Hallow-Pant.</p>
                     <p>In Corbridge's Plan of Newcaſtle, 1723, this is called Dog-Loop, <hi>i. e.</hi> Leap.</p>
                  </note>. At the north end of this lane there was a place called Pencher-Place <note n="b" place="bottom">It has been conjectured that Pencher-Place means the place of paunch, <hi>i. e.</hi> tripe-women.—Sed quaere? for "Pencher" may have been the ſirname of the owner of the property.</note>. He adds, "perhaps the whole lane was called ſo."</p>
               <p>It went up as far as the late Nether-Dean-Bridge <note n="c" place="bottom">See afterwards "Nether-Dean-Bridge."</note>.</p>
               <p>"Under this very high and ancient arch," he continues, "I am told the rings are ſtill to be ſeen that the boats were faſtened to, which
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:0442300101:365"/>
brought up the merchant-goods, when the merchants had their ſhops in the Fleſh-Market." This arch was lately taken down.</p>
               <p>Lort, or Lork-Burn, up which, for a conſiderable way, the tide flowed formerly, made a diviſion anciently in the lower part of the Side. This runner of water was covered over with ſtone, A. D. 1696 <note n="d" place="bottom">"1696. Lort-Burn arched over and paved from the foot of Side-Pant to the Keyſide-Wall." —Grey's MSS. quarto, No. 3, dorſo.</note>.</p>
               <p>On the north ſide of Lork-Burn, near the Sand-Hill, ſtood the Cale-Croſs <note n="e" place="bottom">
                     <p>Bourne ſuppoſes it to have been called Cale-Croſs, becauſe of the cale, or broth, which was ſold there in former times: I think much more probably from the herb kail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort, which alſo gave a name to broth in the north.—Bourne adds, "This ſeems to have been its original name, for I meet with it in the reign of King Richard II. and alſo in a writing dated in the time of King Edward the Third."</p>
                     <p>In the confirmation of the Wall-Knowl hoſpital, A. D. 1360, it is called "Cale-Croſs."</p>
                     <p>In a deed preſerved in All-Saints' veſtry, dated October 19th, 1319, it is thus mentioned: "In vico qui ducit del Cale-Croſſe."</p>
                     <p>In the common-council books, October 10th, 1653, the name is ſpelled "Keale-Croſſe."</p>
                  </note>, which Grey, in his Chorographia, deſcribes as a "fair one, with columns of hewn ſtone covered with lead."</p>
               <p>There was a ciſtern at the top of it within my remembrance, to hold what was then called the New-Water. It was taken down about No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember 1773 <note n="f" place="bottom">Newcaſtle Courant, November 6th, 1773.</note>. It is ſometimes, but erroneouſly, called Scale-Croſs.</p>
               <p>This croſs was rebuilt, A. D. 1783, after a deſign of Mr. David Stevenſon, architect.—The inſcription as follows: "Sir Matthew White Ridley, Bart. mayor, Richard Bell, Eſq. ſheriff." Here conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to be ſold eggs, milk, cheeſe, butter, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Adjoining to this ſtreet ſtood the houſe of Grey-Friars, or Minors, called alſo Franciſcan-Friars.</p>

                  <pb n="332" facs="tcp:0442300101:366"/>They were one of the moſt eminent of the four orders of mendicants <note n="g" place="bottom">Before perſons could be admitted into this order they were obliged to give a convincing proof of the diſintereſtedneſs of their motives, by ſelling all they had and giving it to the poor.</note>. St. Francis, their founder, gave them one of their names.—They were called Grey Friars from the colour of their habit, and Minors through humility <note n="h" place="bottom">

                     <p>Their habit was a looſe garment reaching to the ancles, with a cowl and a cloak over it when they went abroad—they girded themſelves with cords and went barefooted.—Yet it ſhould ſeem, from the prints in Creccelius's Collectanea, that the Obſervants only, a rigid branch of the order, had their feet uncovered.</p>
                  </note>. Their houſe in Newcaſtle is ſaid to have been founded by the Carliols <note n="i" place="bottom">Their great eſtate, according to Leland, went by marriage to the family of the Thur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gills, of the Wolds in Yorkſhire.</note>, wealthy merchants in the time of King Henry III <note n="k" place="bottom">

                     <p>Bourne, from the authority of the Milbank MS. ſays it ſtood near Pilgrim-Street Gate, and that there was a little lane between it and the walls.</p>
                     <p>The High-Friar-Chare muſt have conducted to it, being ſtyled, in ſeveral ancient writings, "Vicus qui ducit ad Fratres Minores."</p>
                     <p>The burial-ground of the monaſtery was immediately oppoſite to Ficket-Tower, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears before in the old account of Ficket-Ward.</p>

               <p>Bourne, on the authority of ancient writings, obſerves that they were a regular and ſettled body, A. D. 1267.</p>
               <p>At a general chapter of this order held at Narbone in France, A.

He was the ſon of a tenant of that houſe.—In one of his MS. works, folio, D. 1. 6. Theolog. are theſe words: "Explicit lectura doctoris ſubtilis in univerſitate Oxonienſi ſuper quartum librum Sententiarum, ſcilicet, Domini Johannis Duns, nati in quadam villula parochiae de Emyldon vocata Dunſtan in comitatu Northumbriae pertinente domui ſcholarum de Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Hall in Oxonia et quondam ſocii dictae domus."

                     <p>There was preſerved in the town's butch, among other writings preſerved there, A. D. 1565, "a grant by one King Richard for the building of Nether-Dean-Bridge."</p>

               <p>Dr. Elliſon's MSS. call it "an hoſpital in the Nether-Deen-Bridge." It often is mentioned in St. Nicholas' old regiſters—1579, 1581, 1650, &amp;c.</p>

Alſo, in another, ibid. dated 1405. There is a ſtrange derivation of the name of this place given by Dr. Stukeley, in his Iter Boreale, p. 68. He ſays it "is probably from the old name Panna, corrupted." This Panna, the doctor ſuppoſes (but it is a mere ſuppoſition) was the ancient name of the ſtation at Newcaſtle.</note>.</p>

                     <p>Dr. Elliſon's MSS. ſay, that this houſe, called the Pilgrim's Inn, was holden of the dean and chapter of Durham, and belonged in his time to Mr. Ralph Ogle.</p>
                     <p>Bourne deſcribes it as adjoining to the north ſide of Mr. Edward Collingwood's houſe, and exactly 116 yards from the ſouthermoſt corner of Upper-Dean-Bridge: he adds, it is holden of the dean and chapter of Durham, and belongs at preſent to Mr. James Hargrave.</p>
                     <p>This appears to have been called St. Cuthbert's Inn in the time of Henry VIII. See the miniſters' or bailiffs' accounts of the monaſtery of Durham, 4th of February, 32 Hen.

                     <p>The laſt building in this ſtreet, to which tradition had continued the name of Pilgrim's Inn, was pulled down a few years ago by its owner Mr. Thomas Barker, merchant, who has built on the ſite of it a large houſe to front the ſtreet, and converted the back parts of the premiſes into a ſtarch manufactory. Windows of a very ancient model, thick wall, &amp;c. as alſo a crucifix of wood, were diſcovered on pulling down the old building.</p>
                     <p>In the ſummer of 1777 I ſaw at Canterbury a place for ſimilar purpoſes, where the ſhoals of pilgrims that went thither to viſit the ſhrine of St. Thomas a Becket, were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to lodge, which has undergone little or no alteration in its appearance. Chaucer is ſaid to have often ſlept in it. See Goſtling's Canterbury, p. 57, 63, 64. 2d edition.</p>
                  </note> in this ſtreet, ſays Bourne, which the Pilgrims in their journey were wont to call at, which occaſioned their conſtant coming up this ſtreet, and ſo it got its name of Pilgrim-Street, as the inn did that of Pilgrim's Inn.</p>

               <p>The limits for viſiting patients were appointed as follows: Shield-Road-Bridge to the eaſtward, and the utmoſt extent of the town to the weſt, north, and ſouth.

                     <p>Grey (and Bourne after him) calls it a princely houſe, and very ſtately and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, being ſuppoſed to be the moſt ſo of any houſe in the whole kingdom within a walled town. It is ſurrounded with a vaſt quantity of ground.</p>

My authority imagines this to be the burial place of Robert Rhodes. He ſays the picture upon the ſtone was very like that of Roger Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton; all the difference is, that the gown of this picture is not ſo deep as that of Thornton's.—He conjectures it to be the burial place of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Rhodes, becauſe of the words promotor eccleſiarum. Lib. All Hall. The words promotor eccleſiarum are not now to be found. However," continues Bourne, "had they been there ſtill, I think they are but a weak argument to prove that Robert Rhodes was buried here, when it is conſidered that he founded a chantry in St. Nicholas', that his own ſoul and his wife's might be prayed for. For people were generally buried in the ſame church, and near the very place, where they erected a chantry or an altar. But whoever it is, this, I think, may be ſafely concluded from the grandeur of the grave-ſtone, that he was ſome wealthy perſon, and, from his being promotor eccleſiarum, that he was alſo religious.</p>
                  <p>"The effigies is very tall, and is ſurrounded with very curious pictures of the ſaints and ſome other things: but the braſs is now tearing off, and going very faſt into ruin. It is a pity (he adds) there ſhould not be more care taken of it, as it is an ornament to the church, and the monument of its benefactor. The promotors of churches ſhould be always remembered with the moſt grateful reſpect, that they may be ſhining lights to the moſt diſtant ages."</p>

               <p>The owners of houſes in the ſtreet without the Weſt-Gate have votes in the election of members of parliament for the county of Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland. A road branches off here, on the left hand, leading into the Cloſe by the Firth and Infirmary, and another road, turning upon the right hand, conducts to the Town-Moor, &amp;c. paſt the Warden's Cloſe, which belonged to the monaſtery of Black-Friars. Bourne, after Grey, tells us, it ſeems to be called the Warden's Cloſe <note n="n" place="bottom">
                     <p>"For," ſays he, "Grey tells us the warden of Tinmouth had his houſe, garden, fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond, &amp;c. here;" and adds, "this indeed is not improbable, for the monaſtery of the Black-Friars was dependant upon the priory of Tinmouth;" and, "there are ſtill the ſeeming remains of fiſh-ponds, gardens, &amp;c."—I have to obſerve upon the above, that, at the entrance to Warden's Cloſe, one may eaſily diſcover the remains of a ſmall fort—the other inequalities ſeem to have been formed by throwing up earth for breaſt-works, by the Scots, at the ſiege of the town in 1644. Yet there occurs in Madox's Formulare An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glicanum, a record, dated July 13th, 1466, which mentions fiſh-ponds at that time in this place.—It is a leaſe from John Rokeſburgh, prior of the Black-Friars in Newcaſtle, and the brethren thereof, to William Hays, of a certain great cloſe of theirs, built round with a ſtone wall, for the term of his life, at the yearly rent of 25 ſhillings, and allowing him to fix a ſmall leaden pipe, of a bore large enough to admit a wheaten ſtraw, to their aqueduct, running in and through that cloſe, to their monaſtery, in order to ſupply his fiſh-ponds with water, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>It appears by the common-council books, July 5th, 1647, that certain referees, for bringing water to Sand-Gate, were appointed to view the conduit at Warden's Cloſe, and take ſome waſhers with them to view the water, and report. There is an order ibid. dated July 30th, 1647, to bring water into the town of Newcaſtle, from the Warden's Cloſe, "there having bene formerly time out of the memory of man a conduit of water att the north end of the Warden's Cloſe, which water had its courſe and paſſage into the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den's Cloſe, and from thence thro' the Black-Friars, and ſoe came into this towne."—" Of late years the free paſſage and conduit hath bene ſtopped."—</p>

                     <p>Dr. Thomas Henſhaw, in Skinner's Etymology, in verbo, tells us that pond was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently pronounced pand, which Skinner derives, with great probability, from the Anglo-Saxon, pyndan, to incloſe or ſhut up. I am inclined to ſuppoſe that pant is no more than pand, by a very ſmall corruption, meaning a little reſervoir or pond. In a deed, dated 1450, relative to the publick fountain in the market-place of Durham, which is of conſtruction ſimilar to thoſe at Newcaſtle, I find this word uſed: "Ejuſdem fontis caput vulgariter nuncupat' le Pant Head."</p>

                     <p>See account of Ficket-Tower-Ward, where the ſame word occurs, ſeeming plainly to mean a burying-ground. Bourne ſuppoſes the Maudlin-Barrows to be the preſent "Sick Man's Cloſe;" barrows ſignifying tumuli, graves and ſepulchres.</p>
                     <p>Bourne tells us, alſo, that "ſome have imagined it to be called ſo from a perſon of that name, who was its builder, or a benefactor to it." Other accounts, he adds, derive its appellation from the word barracado.—"St. Andrew's church," ſays the Milbank MS. "is the oldeſt church in town, becauſe it is next the Barras, which hath been the ancient barracado of the town." It appears by the following quotation from Hearne's edition of the Chronicon of Whethamſtede, vol. ii. p. 532, that barriers for the defence of a town were erected in different parts of it: and indeed what would it avail to have it barricaded only in one place? "John de Cella," ſays that writer, "made abbot of St. Albans A. D. 1195, and who died A. D. 1214, did as follows, amongſt other good works: Item bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reras illas quas predeceſſor ſuus pro defenſione ville (Sancti Albani) in diverſis illius parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus ſuis in temporibus erigi juſſerat." There is a reference from the word barreras, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining it by repagula, barriers. There were ſuch erections alſo about Newcaſtle.—See Froiſart's Chronicle—Battle of Otterbourn.—See alſo before in the account of Ever-Tower-Ward, where mention occurs of the barriers beyond Gallow-Gate, without New-Gate, "as men go to the gallows."</p>

The area, in the middle of it, is about 83 feet broad, and about 97½ feet long. There are upwards of fifty chambers in it. Who it was built by, may be learned from the inſcription above the entrance of it, which is as follows: "The Keelmen's Hoſpital, built at their own charge, anno Domini, 1701; Matthew White, Eſq. governor, Mr. Edward Grey, Mr. Edward Carr, ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards of the hoſtmen's company for the time being, and truſtees for this hoſpital." I have been told that Dr. Moor, late Biſhop of Ely, upon going down the river in the town's barge, with the magiſtrates, obſerved it, and made inquiry about it: and being told that it was built by the keelmen themſelves (every one allowing towards it a penny a tide), he ſaid, that he had heard of and ſeen many hoſpitals the works of rich men, but that was the firſt he ever ſaw or heard of, which had been built by the poor. 'Tis a pity that the deſign of its building is not thoroughly anſwered, but there are ſome miſcreants who would rather ſtarve in ſickneſs or old age, than not guzzle a penny in their health and youth."</note>.</p>

               <p>December 19th, 1758, the hoſtmen recommended it to the keelmen to make ſome agreement for the better ſupport of their own poor, and to pay one halfpenny per chalder for each tide. And February 3d, 1759, a committee of hoſtmen was choſen to conſider the proper heads of a bill, after they had collected the ſenſe of the greateſt part of the ſkippers and keelmen on the ſubject.</p>
               <p>Nothing however appears to have been finally agreed upon on this occaſion.</p>
               <p>February 16th, 1765, the above matter was revived, and the hoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſent inſtructions to a lawyer to prepare a proper plan for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture eſtabliſhment of an hoſpital for the relief of the keelmen: but this deſign alſo came to nothing <note n="b" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.</p>
               <p>November 26th, 1768, there was a meeting of perſons choſen by the keelmen for the above purpoſes, at which it was reſolved to raiſe a fund, and re-eſtabliſh the hoſpital, for the better proviſion in future of their needy, impotent, and lame poor, by deducting from the wages of every keel's crew one halfpenny for every chaldron of coals <note n="c" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.</p>

He claimed to be of Bernard Gilpin's line, and had his ſcutcheon pinned at his coffin." The ſame authority mentions "Mr. Pleaſance as a preacher at Newcaſtle," alſo "Mr. Pell," who married Mrs. Elliſon, of a great and wealthy family, and died at Newcaſtle (it appears, by St. Nicholas' regiſter, that he was buried December 6th, 1698).—The above MS.

The Lady Bowes, being apprehenſive of danger to him from ſo ſurly and fierce a people, as he was going to preach amongſt: Mr. Rothwell unconcernedly replied: "If I thought I ſhould not meet the devil there, I would not come there.—He and I have been at odds in other places, and I hope we ſhall not agree there." Such another warrior was this gentleman, who could ſay with Mr. Alderman Jurdan, who whilſt he was in ſome trouble in the Star-Chamber, and one told him the Lord-Keeper was againſt him, anſwered, "He had a greater Lord-Keeper than he—The Lord is my Keeper, I will not be afraid."</p>

                     <p>Hearne, in the preface to his Collection of curious Diſcourſes, p. 28, 29, ſpeaking of Antoninus' "ad Anſam," has theſe words: "Though this place grew to be eminent and large at laſt, yet at firſt it was only one diverſorium, or inn, on which there was the ſign of the Anſa, by which name, for that reaſon, the whole ſtation itſelf was called afterwards, a thing not uncommon to ſeveral other places, both in ancient as well as more modern times."</p>
                     <p>Dr. Stukeley, in his Iter Boreale, p. 69, ſpeaking of Gateſhead, ſays, "I gueſs this was a fortified town in the times of the Romans, where a ferry was for paſſage northward; but by reaſon of the buildings no traces of it are left. I ſaw ſeveral Roman ſtones here, the recipient parts of their hand-mills."</p>
                     <p>The doctor ſuppoſed that Gateſhead was the Gabrocentum of the Notitia, where the ſecond cohort of the Thracians were in garriſon, as its name in Britiſh imports "goat's head, I ſuppoſe, from the ſign of ſome inn." He adds, "A goat's head ſtill ſtands upon the ſign of the Golden Lion."</p>
                     <p>"Caput loci," according to Kennet's Gloſſary to his Parochial Antiquities, ſignifies the end of a place—"ad caput villae," at the end of the town. Quaere, May not "Gateſheved" mean barely "the end of the road?" there having been diſcovered no traces of a Roman road carried northwards from Newcaſtle.</p>
                     <p>If Bede confounded "gate," via, with "goat," capra, which was anciently, and is ſtill, in the vulgar language of the north, pronounced "gate," he would naturally latinize it by "caprae caput," inſtead of "viae caput."

Contentions between the foreſter and burgeſſes to be determined, if poſſible, in the borough, if not, to be referred to the biſhop. The cattle of a burgeſs not to be taken out of the borough, but to be replevied there, if the owners chooſe. The burgeſſes to have graſs, ruſhes, fellger (I ſuppoſe, "geare, or ſtuff, from the fell"), and heath for their own uſe, but not to ſell any to others. Any burgeſs digging turf for his own fire, if he have no cart of his own, to pay 2d for each borrowed one. Any burgeſs to give his wood to whom he pleaſes, provided the perſon to whom he gives it lives on this (the Durham) ſide of Tyne, and it be done with no unfair view; but he is not to ſell any without the foreſter's licence. The goods of none coming within the limits aforeſaid, are to be diſturbed by the foreſter. Each burgeſs of Gateſhead to have the ſame liberty of his burgage, that the burgeſſes of Newcaſtle have. A burgeſs of Gateſhead, or his goods, going into any part of the biſhop's land, to have the peace of God and St. Cuth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, and all perſons are forbidden to hurt or exact any thing of them.

                     <p>There is ſaid to have been a monaſtery at Gateſhead, A. D. 653, if the place called in Bede's Church Hiſtory "Caprae Caput," muſt be underſtood to mean Gateſhead, of which one Uttanus was then abbot: but of the foundation, continuance, and deſtruction of this very ancient houſe, no other memorials have been preſerved. Tanner, in his Notitia Monaſtica, cites on this occaſion Bede, lib. iii. cap. 21. See alſo Leland's Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectanea, vol. ii. p. 140. "Uttan preſbyter' inluſtris et abbatis monaſterii quod vocatur ad Caprae Caput." Sic Beda ſcribit: addit autem annotator ejus Doctor Smith in loco: "Caprae Caput hodie Gateſhead ubi nulla remanent antiqui monaſterii Uttani veſtigia. Recentioris quidem pulcherrimam videmus capellam, vix adhuc ruinis ſuccumbentem. Traditio eſt cellam fuiſſe ſanctimonialium Novocaſtrenſium, licet ejus hiſtoriam apud auctores vix inveneris."

                     <p>This author is miſtaken in the account he gives of this place having been ſet on fire. The Catholic chapel, which, out of a miſguided zeal, was ſet on fire on that occaſion, was in a manſion-houſe adjoining to this ruinous chapel, the ruins of which manſion-houſe are ſeen in his view.—He very juſtly obſerves, that the entrance, which is through a low, ſquare, ſtone gate, decorated with pilaſters, is ſeemingly of modern conſtruction. —The ſite of the houſe, he adds, with its offices and gardens, occupied about two acres and a half of land.—Towards the eaſt end of it are the ruins of a manſion, which, from the ſtyle of its architecture, ſeems to have been built ſince the diſſolution of the monaſtery, perhaps out of its materials. This probably was Mr. Riddle's houſe, alluded to by Bourne.—The gateway is probably of the ſame age. Groſe alſo confounds the very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient monaſtery of Uttan and St. Edmund's hoſpital with this ruin.

               <p>WHEREAS the Right Reverend Father in God John Lord Biſhop of Durham is intitled, in right of his ſee, to one-third part of an ancient bridge extending acroſs the river Tyne, between the town of Gateſhead, in the county palatine of Durham, and the town and county of the town of Newcaſtle upon Tyne: and whereas, by the violence and rapidity of a moſt extraordinary flood, which happened on the ſeventeenth day of November, one thouſand ſeven hundred and ſeventy one, in the river of Tyne, the ſaid bridge was very much damaged, broken down in ſeveral places, and rendered utterly impaſſable: and whereas, in order to reſtore an eaſy and ſafe communication between the counties of Durham and Northumberland, it is highly expedient that the ſaid bridge ſhould be rebuilt, or effectually repaired, with all poſſible expedition: and inaſmuch as the neceſſary repairs of the one-third part of the ſaid bridge, belonging to the ſaid Lord Biſhop of Durham in right of his ſee, and extending from two blue marble or boundary ſtones, on the ſouth ſide of the ſaid bridge, to the ſaid town of Gateſhead, will be attended with a great expence; and however reaſonable or proper it may be, that the entire ſum neceſſary to be appropriated for, and employed in, that uſeful and neceſſary work, ought to be raiſed out of, or ſecured upon, the revenues and poſſeſſions of the ſaid ſee of Durham, and that the Lord Biſhop of Durham for the time being, ought not to bear any greater burthen than ſhall ariſe from the intereſt or annual charge to be paid in reſpect of the principal money to be raiſed for the purpoſe aforeſaid; yet the ſaid John Lord Biſhop of Durham is conſenting that a reaſonable and adequate ſum of money may be raiſed by the authority of parliament, by granting an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuities for lives, which will not only be ſpeedy and effectual, but may be a method leſs burthenſome to the ſucceſſors in the ſaid ſee than to the ſaid John now Lord Biſhop of Durham, by the eventual dropping of lives, and the decreaſe of ſuch temporary charge: wherefore, may it therefore pleaſe your Majeſty that it may be enacted, and be it enacted by the King's moſt excellent Majeſty, by and with the advice and conſent of the lords ſpiritual and temporal, and commons, in this preſent parliament aſſembled,

and by the authority of the ſame, that the chancellor of the biſhoprick and county pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine of Durham and Sadberge, the ſheriff of the county palatine of Durham and Sadberge, the vicar-general and principal official of the dioceſe of Durham, the attorney and ſolicitor-general to the Lord Biſhop of Durham, the principal regiſter or regiſtrar of the dioceſe of Durham, the auditor to the Lord Biſhop of Durham, the keeper of Auckland-caſtle, the ſteward of the halmote courts of the Lord Biſhop of Durham, the clerk of the halmote courts of the Lord Biſhop of Durham, the clerk of the great receipt of the exchequer of Durham, the regiſter of the court of chancery of Durham, the clerk of the chancery of Durham, and the keeper of the rolls of the chancery aforeſaid, the clerk of the itinerant juſtices, and other juſtices whomſoever in the county palatine of Durham and Sadberge, and the bailiff of the borough of Auckland for the time being, ſhall be, and they are hereby appointed truſtees for putting this act in execution, by and under the direction of the ſaid John Lord Biſhop of Durham, and his ſucceſſors.</p>
               <p>Provided always, and be it enacted, that no perſon ſhall be capable of acting as a truſtee in the execution of this act, during the time he ſhall hold any office or appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to which any ſalary or pecuniary profit ſhall be annexed, by virtue or in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this act; nor ſhall any ſuch truſtee, on his own private account, enter into any contract, or have any ſhare or intereſt in any contract, relating to the execution of any of the powers contained in this act.</p>
               <p>And whereas it may be neceſſary to open a more convenient avenue and paſſage to that part of the ſaid bridge which belongs to the ſaid ſee of Durham, and to remove the erections and buildings on the ſame, be it therefore enacted, that the ſaid truſtees, or any three or more of them, ſhall, and they are hereby authoriſed, by and under ſuch direction of the ſaid Lord Biſhop of Durham, and his ſucceſſors, as aforeſaid, to treat, contract, and agree with any perſon or perſons, for the abſolute purchaſe of any eſtate or intereſt in any buildings or ground, which ſhall be deemed neceſſary to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated, for the better and more effectually repairing, rebuilding, or improving, ſuch part of the ſaid bridge as belongs to the ſaid ſee of Durham, and for making more convenient the avenue and paſſage leading on the ſame, or to appropriate any building or ground which the ſaid biſhop is intitled unto in right of his ſee, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes aforeſaid.</p>

the ſum of two thouſand four hundred pounds of their own money towards the expence of building ſuch temporary bridge, and purchaſing houſes and ground in Newcaſtle and Gateſhead aforeſaid, for making a road to ſuch temporary bridge, power was given to the mayor, aldermen, and common council, of the ſaid town and county to build the ſaid bridge, and maintain and ſupport the ſame when built, and for that purpoſe to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point a committee to tranſact ſuch matters as they might find neceſſary: and whereas by the ſaid act it was enacted, that the ſaid temporary bridge ſhould continue only for the term of ſeven years, from the twenty-fourth day of June, one thouſand ſeven hundred and ſeventy-two; and that for reimburſing the ſaid mayor, aldermen, and common council, all ſuch ſums as by them ſhould be laid out for the purpoſes in the ſaid act mentioned, over and above the ſaid ſum of two thouſand four hundred pounds, it ſhould be lawful for them to take certain tolls for paſſage over the ſaid temporary bridge: and whereas it was apprehended, at the time of paſſing the ſaid act, that a new ſtone bridge might be built, or the old ſtone bridge effectually repaired, in leſs time than ſeven years from the ſaid twenty-fourth day of June; but it having ſince been ſound neceſſary to take down four arches of that part of the ſaid bridge which belongs to the ſaid cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration (which at the time of paſſing the ſaid act were deemed ſit to be left ſtanding), the building of the new ſtone bridge has been retarded, and the ſame cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted in leſs than three years from this time: and whereas, when the old ſtone bridge was deſtroyed by a flood as before mentioned, there were ſtanding on that part thereof which belongs to the corporation of Newcaſtle, divers houſes, ſhops, and other build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which greatly incommoded the paſſage along the ſaid bridge; all which have been purchaſed by the ſaid corporation at a very conſiderable expence, in order to prevent the publick being incommoded thereby; and whereas the Lord Biſhop of Durham, and the ſaid corporation, have reſpectively proceeded to build a new ſtone bridge in the place where the old bridge ſtood; and the ſaid corporation had, on the twenty-ninth day of December, one thouſand ſeven hundred and ſeventy-eight, expended of their own proper money in building their part of the ſame, the ſum of twenty-one thouſand and forty-two pounds, ſixteen ſhillings, and eleven-pence, including one thouſand eight hundred and thirty-eight pounds, nine ſhillings, and eight-pence, the price of the buildings on the old bridge; and have, ſince that time, incurred further expences in carrying on the ſame: and whereas, upon a moderate computation, the ſaid corporation muſt expend the further ſum of ten thouſand pounds in completing that part of the ſaid bridge which belongs to them: and whereas the ſaid corporation had expended, on the ſaid twenty-ninth day of December, one thouſand ſeven hundred and ſeventy-eight, over and above the ſaid ſum of two thouſand four hundred pounds, in and about the purpoſes of the ſaid recited act, for building a temporary bridge, the ſum of three hundred and twenty-one pounds, eighteen ſhillings, and nine-pence, more than the tolls taken upon the ſaid temporary bridge had produced; and it is apprehended that the tolls taken, and to be taken thereupon, from the twenty-ſeventh day of December, one thouſand ſeven hundred and ſeventy eight, to the twenty-fourth day of June, one thouſand ſeven hundred and ſeventy-nine, and not produce ſo much money a will be ſufficient to reimburſe the ſaid corporation the ſaid ſum of three hundred and twenty-one pounds, eighteen ſhillings, and nine-pence, and the neceſſary expences of repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, preſerving, and ſupporting, the ſaid temporary bridge to the ſaid twenty-fourth day of June: and whereas the ſaid temporary bridge is liable to great damage from floods and ice in the river, and alſo from keels loaded with coals paſſing through the ſame; and it will be of publick utility that the ſame temporary bridge ſhould be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported till the ſaid new ſtone bridge ſhall be built: and whereas, at the time the ſaid bridge was deſtroyed by a flood, there were ſtanding on that part thereof which belong, to the ſee of Durham, divers houſes, ſhops, and other buildings, which greatly incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moded

                  <hi>APPENDIX, P. 52. (No. 2.)</hi> An Act for enlarging the terms and powers of two acts of the twelfth and nineteenth years of his preſent Majeſty's reign, made for building a temporary bridge, and completing a new ſtone bridge, over the river Tyne, between the town of Newcaſtle upon Tyne and Gateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, in the county of Durham, and making the avenues to and the paſſages over the ſame more commodious; and for removing and preventing nuiſances and annoyances in the ſtreets, lanes, or avenues leading to the ſaid new ſtone bridge, within the town of Gateſhead, in the county of Durham.</head>
               <p>WHEREAS an act of parliament paſſed in the twelfth year of his preſent Majeſty's reign, for building a temporary bridge over the river Tyne, between the town of Newcaſtle upon Tyne and Gateſhead, in the county of Durham, which temporary bridge was to have continuance from the twenty-fourth day of June one thouſand ſeven hundred and ſeventy-two, for the term of ſeven years; and in the nineteenth year of his preſent Majeſty's reign, another act of parliament paſſed, whereby the ſaid tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary bridge was continued for the further term of three years, and divers perſons therein named were appointed truſtees for putting the ſaid laſt-mentioned act into execution, and were enabled to complete the new ſtone bridge over the ſaid river, and to make the avenues to, and the paſſage over, the ſaid new ſtone bridge more commodious; and it was thereby enacted, that for and towards raiſing money for the purpoſes of the ſaid act, it ſhould be lawful for the ſaid truſtees to take and receive ſuch and the ſame tolls for the paſſage of cattle, carriages, and other things over the ſaid new ſtone bridge, as by the ſaid firſt-mentioned act were authorized to be taken on the ſaid temporary bridge, until the expiration of twelve years, to be computed from the twenty-fourth day of June one thouſand ſeven hundred and ſeventy-nine, or until ſuch ſooner time as the ſeveral purpoſes of the ſaid act of the nineteenth year of his preſent Majeſty's reign ſhould be carried into execution, and the money borrowed upon the credit thereof, with intereſt, ſhould be repayed; and it was provided and declared, by the ſaid laſt-mentioned act, that the improvement of the avenues to the ſaid new ſtone bridge ſhould end at the meſſuages and premiſes, then late Oliphant's, at the ſouth abutment of the ſaid new ſtone bridge:</p>
               <p>And whereas the ſaid truſtees have duly put the ſaid act in execution, and have, by the money ariſing from the ſaid tolls and borrowed on the credit thereof, made and opened ſuch avenues, and completed ſuch other works within the limits preſcribed by the ſaid laſt-mentioned act, as were adjudged neceſſary for the ſafety and accommodation of the public; but the ſouth avenue to the ſaid new ſtone bridge, beyond the premiſes late Oliphant's, in the town of Gateſhead aforeſaid, is inconvenient and dangerous to paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, by reaſon of the great declivity of the ſtreet there, called the Bottlebank, over which the high road leading from the city of Durham to the ſaid bridge lies, though the ſame is capable of being rendered both ſafe and commodious:</p>
               <p>And whereas it will be of great public utility to effect the improvement of the ſaid ſouth avenue to the ſaid bridge; but in regard that the ſaid truſtees appointed by the ſaid act of the nineteenth year of his preſent Majeſty's reign, are thereby reſtrained from making any improvement beyond the ſaid premiſes late Oliphant's, and ſuch intended improvements of the ſaid ſouth avenue cannot be effectually made, unleſs the ſaid tolls are further continued, and the terms and powers of both the ſaid acts enlarged: May it therefore pleaſe your Majeſty, that it may be enacted, and be it enacted, by the King's moſt excellent Majeſty, by and with the advice and conſent of the lords ſpiritual and

                     <l>Should thus be over-trod; wherefore his wrong to wreake,</l>
                     <l>In their proud preſence thus, doth aged Picts-Wall ſpeake.</l>

                  <p>The annexed plan of this fort, drawn by its late very reſpectable owner, Robert Shafto, Eſq. about the time when the military road leading to Carliſle was made, will give a better idea of it than can be conveyed by any verbal deſcription. The above Mr. Shafto diſcovered a Roman hypocauſt or ſudatory, at the diſtance of about three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yards ſouth-weſt of the ſtation. Of this alſo he has left an accurate plan illuſtrated with written deſcriptions. The annexed copper-plate repreſentation is a fac ſimile of Mr. Shafto's plan. This ſtation was on the top of the firſt eminence beyond Fenham Lodge, and before we arrive at the ſecond mile-ſtone from Newcaſtle.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Gordon by miſtake calls it Benwell-Hill; but that eminence is beyond the ſecond mile-ſtone, where Mr. Shafto diſcovered the remains of an exploratory tower.</p>
                  <p>That part of the ſtation of Benwell, which lies on the north ſide of the turnpike road, is at preſent a plantation, the property of William Ord, Eſq. of Fenham.</p>

                  <p>JUNE 4th, 1783, in ſearching among the ruinous heaps at the ſtation of Halton, I diſcovered a part of the ſhaft and capital of a column, which, no doubt, has anciently ſupported ſome Roman temple there.</p>

<pb n="609" facs="tcp:0442300101:646"/>
It has a ſingular appearance, for the facing-ſtones on both ſides thereof have reſiſted the action of wheels, &amp;c. longer than the battered materials that ſurround them, and riſe a little above the level of the road.</p>
                  <p>Near Brunton was diſcovered ſome years ago a Roman ſtone, having "Legio ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunda" inſcribed on it. This ſtone is at preſent in my poſſeſſion.</p>

                  <p>The foſs of Severus' Wall, running down a pretty ſteep deſcent, from Brunton to the North Tine, conducts us to the very curious remains of a Roman bridge, which has anciently ſpanned that river at this place: innumerable large ſquare ſtones with holes in them, wherein iron rivets have been fixed, but catch away by ruſt many ages ago, ſtill lie bedded on the ſpot, and defy the violence of the rapid ſtoods. It was a remarkably dry ſummer when I viſited this place, and the water was ſo low and clear, that on wading into it, I diſcovered the foundation of one of the piers; one end of it was defaced, but it ſeemed to have originally reſembled the modern ones.</p>

Five ſculptured and inſcribed Roman ſtones, which have been removed from this ſtation, are preſerved at preſent at Walwick-Grange.</p>
                  <p>From Walwick-Cheſters to Carrawbrugh, which is the next ſtation, and diſtant three meaſured miles and a quarter, the Wall of Severus, accompanied by the works of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian, is in very great perfection.</p>
                  <p>There is little at preſent very obſervable about the fort of Carrawbrugh. At Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raw, a little farther weſt, in the gable end of a ſtable, in the inſide, there is built up a Roman ſtone, on which the figure of a man is ſculptured, in ſomething like the ſame attitude in which the river gods are uſually depicted.</p>
                  <p>From Carrawbrugh to Houſe-Steeds, called by Dr. Stukeley, with great propriety, the Tadmor of Britain, the diſtance is ſomewhat more than four miles and five furlongs.

An immenſe quantity of ruins denote the ſite of this once famous ſtation, the Borcovicus of the Notitia. The ſtreets of the Roman town <note n="d" place="bottom">Part of the Roman houſes are remaining in many places: in the corner of one of them I diſcovered what muſt once have been an oven, of curious maſonry, and in its form not unlike the ovens of the preſent day. The action of fire is plainly diſcernible on many of the ſtones.</note> are ſtill pointed out, and ſeveral ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race-like appearances, running weſtward, are marked along the gently-ſloping hill. The altar, No. 36, in Horſley's Britannia Romana, is at preſent built up in the chimney-piece of the farmer's houſe there. A very large ſtone, on which is ſculptured the figure of a Roman ſoldier, holding a ſpear in his hand, was diſcovered not many years ago, and is ſtill preſerved. I found the fragment of a column, of which Dr. Stukeley ſaw ſeveral in his time. Altars ſtill lie ſcattered about in great abundance on Chapel-Hill and the adjacent meadow. Mr. Magnay, the tenant, ſhewed me a large braſs coin of Aelius that was found there.</p>
                  <p>From Houſe-Steeds to the ſtation of Little Cheſters, which is conſiderably to the ſouth of both the walls, it meaſures about a mile and three quarters. It ſtands cloſe to the military way, which proceeds like the ſtring of a bow, in a ſtraight courſe from Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick-Cheſters to Caervorran.</p>
                  <p>I was at Little Cheſters, October 8th, 1783, and found the ramparts and pretorium ſtill diſtinguiſhable. A ſtone, with an inſcription, which I could not make out, is built up in the weſtern gable end of a cottage a little weſtward of this fort <note n="e" place="bottom">A remarkable pillar or milliary ſtone ſtands a little to the eaſt of this ſtation, adjoining to the military way of Severus. I was informed of another to the weſt of the ſtation. I procured here a ſmall ſtone, with the rude ſculpture of a Roman ſoldier, holding a ſpear in one hand and a patera in the other, with ſome fragments of Roman pottery. I ſaw here alſo ſeveral ornamented fragments of ſtones—one in the form of a pine apple, and heard of No. XI. mentioned in Warburton, p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>From Little Cheſters to Great Cheſters, the diſtance is three miles three quarters.— This ſtation is ſtill very entire, and the pretorium plainly diſtinguiſhable. Near this and at the door of the tenant's (Mr. Smith's) houſe, I ſaw No. 63 of Horſley's Britan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia Romana, and alſo a curious ſepulchral ſtone built up as the ſide of a gateway at the adjoining mill, a little to the ſouth of it, where there are ſome remarkable barrows.—I was ſhewn the graves in ſome of theſe that had been opened out—in one of them was found a ſkull. They conſiſted of ſide ſtones ſet down into the earth, and covered at top with other larger ſtones. I ſuppoſe theſe to have been very early Chriſtian ſepulchres.</p>
                  <p>This, no doubt, has been the cemetery of the ſtation in the lower ages of the empire. Some curious inſcriptions have been lately found here, and removed to Wall-Town.</p>

               <q>"HERE lies buried The Reverend <hi>Richard Cuthbert,</hi> S. T. B. vicar of Kirkby in Kendale: In whoſe character the Chriſtian, the ſcholar, and the gentleman rendered each other more illuſtrious. His zeal was happily tempered with knowledge and moderation. His public labours and private conduct agreed to demonſtrate the integrity of his life. Stranger, ſuſpect not this epitaph of flattery; his praiſes are more fully inſcribed on the hearts of all who knew him, and his Maſter's preſence will reward and perfect his virtues, by a more intimate converſe with the great Exemplar.
