            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the PUBLIC.</head>
            <p>LE DESERTEUR, is well known to have been theſe five years the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite Muſical Piece on the French ſtage: ſo great indeed has been its ſucceſs, that in this ſhort time it has been tranſlated into three languages; one of which tranſlations we have lately ſeen at the King's Theatre in the Hay-market, under the title of <hi>Il Deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, when you once admit the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Henry's conſeſſing himſelf a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerter, nothing can be more truly intereſting than ſome of the incidents; but yet they were brought about in a way peculiarly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated for the French ſtage: the reſolution of Henry was too ſudden, too unprepared, as well as the circumſtance of the mock-wedding that precedes it; and throughout the piece there were a number of cold inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating occurrences, that had very little, if any, relation to the main deſign; and, add to this, it was never intended for an Opera, for the author himſelf calls it a Comedy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſperſed with Songs.</p>
            <p>It was thought, therefore, that if the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary incidents were expunged, and thoſe retained were rendered more probable; if,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0723800800:5"/>
by making an uniform partition between the dialogue and the ſongs, it could be brought more to wear the complexion of an Opera, <hi>The Deſerter</hi> might be entitled to a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able reception on the Engliſh ſtage: how far theſe ſuggeſtions were reaſonable, the public (who are the beſt judges, and by whoſe arbitration I ſhall always be proud to abide) will determine.</p>
            <p>With regard to the Muſic, as I found it a work of great invention, I ſhould have kept it in its original ſtate, had it been poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; but beſides the exceſſive length of the ſongs, the continual breaks into recitative, the frequent ſudden alterations of the ſtile, and above all, that ſameneſs which ſo parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly characterizes the French Muſic, I found it much too grave to ſtand the leaſt chance of ſucceſs in an after-piece: I, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſelected what I thought the beauties; and what I could not effect by having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the original, I have endeavoured to ſupply myſelf.</p>
            <p>In juſtice to the French compoſer, I think it abſolutely neceſſary to declare, that the ſongs, beginning "<hi>One conduct's for both love and war;</hi>" "<hi>The nymph who in my boſom reigns;</hi>" "<hi>Mr. Simkin, I'd have you to know;</hi>" and "<hi>The whims of folks in love;</hi>" are wholly my own; and that the firſt air in the piece, and that beginning, "<hi>My life's three parts</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0723800800:6"/>
               <hi>diminiſh'd,</hi>" are by Philidor, a name of no inconſiderable note in the muſical world.</p>
            <p>I have nothing to add but that I take this opportunity of making my acknowledgments to the performers for the ſupport they were of to this piece; I would, indeed, but that I deſpair of finding words worthy the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, expreſs my gratitude to the public for their favourable reception of it.</p>

                  <p>Poor ſoul! how he takes it to heart; but I muſt follow him; for if I loſe this opportunity, I may not find it ſo eaſy to get another. But, ſtay, upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thoughts, if I can but make a tool of Simkin, and by that means alarm Louiſa, I ſhall every way gain my ends; for if ſhe once believes him capable of ſlighting her, I am ſure ſhe has too much ſpirit ever to ſee him again.</p>
