            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>A diſtinguiſhing feature of the preſent times, in a medical point of view, is the prevalence of nervous diſorders, and a great increaſe of paralytic affections. Their origin is not difficult to be aſcertained. A deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination appears to pervade all ranks, to call forth into immediate action all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources of exiſtence, by an employment of the moſt powerful agents; and, in the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of a moment, to riſque their whole ſtock of nervous energy. To ſuch inordinate movements, kept up by a repeated uſe of the moſt active ſtimulants, may we juſtly look for the cauſe of that derangement, which phyſicians have to encounter under the multiplied forms of nervous debility.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0648600700:5"/>Various chemical, pncumatic, and mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical operations, it is well known, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly going forward in the human body: and when any of theſe is too much accele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, or precipitately urged, the machine itſelf is deſtroyed, or is rendered uſeleſs. Strongly incited to animal gratifications, men become inſenſible to the condition of their preſent exiſtence, which, ſo far from implying an inceſſant ſeries of pleaſures, in many caſes ſeems to produce the higheſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments by preceding pain; thus inculcating upon human creatures the neceſſity of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, and, in many inſtances, the utility of ſelf-denial. However, as was ſaid, but fewattend to the admonitions of their animal conſtitution. They aim at acquiring what Nature, more provident than they, has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to be attained; and by a laviſh uſe of wine, ſpirits, or laudanum, endeavour to procure to themſelves the power of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual enjoyment. They bid defiance to the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0648600700:6"/>warnings of experience in the fate of others: and ſolicitous only to appear replete with ſpirit and animation in the eyes of thoſe with whom they aſſociate, (who probably have recourſe to the ſame incitements) they continue to urge on the proceſſes of life, till ſome part of the apparatus gives way, and they ſuddenly feel all the ſymptoms of a ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined conſtitution, not to be repaired by the utmoſt efforts of medical ſkill. Hence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed that train of nervous ſymptoms, which no leſs impede the operations of the mind, than occaſion painful bodily ſenſations: ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations ſo acute, as to drive the unhappy victims into the hands of daring empirics, to whoſe pretended ſkill they too often ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice thoſe lives and fortunes, which ought to have been devoted to the good of their connections.</p>
            <p>In the proſecution of my ſubject, I ſhall endeavour carefully to avoid every thing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0648600700:7"/>that has the appearance of abſtract ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation. I wiſh only to announce what, I conceive, will prove a benefit to the public, in alleviating ſome of the moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſing diſorders, that are incident to the human frame. I will ſimply relate what has taken place under my own obſervation. I will not attempt to account for the <hi>modus operandi</hi> of the plant, which is the ſubject of the preſent eſſay; nor take upon me to decide whether it acts by renewing the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritability of the ſyſtem, or only by giving energy to the natural powers: nor ſhall I preſume to determine whether the nerves, acting as conductors of electricity, are, by its means, made capable of tranſmitting a larger quantity of this ſubtile fluid through the whole frame, as Aurum Muſivum, when applied to the rubber of an electrical appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus, enables the cylinder to accumulate a much larger quantity of that agent—It is
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0648600700:8"/>my intention only, by the relation of facts, to eſtabliſh the uſe of this powerful drug in thoſe diſorders, which uſually attend upon an enervated conſtitution. As the plant is not to be found in our Materia Medica at preſent, I ſhall, as briefly as poſſible, deſcribe it, give it's hiſtory, and relate the caſes in which I have ſucceſsfully employed it; in hopes that the faculty will be induced to make a fair trial of it, and, if found worthy of further notice, that they will furniſh the world with the reſult of their obſervations.</p>
            <p>My firſt acquaintance with the ſubject of this eſſay began while I was examining, about four years ago, the plants in the Nurſery Grounds at Cottingham. I was told by the proprietor, of the wonderful effect of the Poiſon Oak; that, if touched by the fingers, and not immediately waſhed off, the acrimony it imparts would be
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0648600700:9"/>retained for a long time; that ſhould a perſon accidentally touch his eyelids, or any part of the body where the ſkin uſually corrugates, whilſt the virulence of the deleterious particles thus contracted conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues unimpaired, a ſwelling and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome itching would come on, and continue for ſome time; and that even ſome of his men had ſuffered ſo much as to loſe ſuch parts of the ſkin by ſphacelation, as the acrid juice had touched. This deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined me to make further enquiries into it's powers; and I ſoon after ſaw in the Analytical Review (to the conductors of which I beg leave to make my acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements) ſome account of experiments made in France, with the <hi>Rhus Radicans,</hi> to which this plant is cloſely allied, by Monſ. Freſnoi; from which it appeared, that he had given the diſtilled water and extract of this plant, in caſes of paralyſis of the lower extremities, with ſucceſs.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0648600700:10"/>This information induced me to hope, that the Sumach I now poſſeſſed, might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited with equal advantage, in the ſame and ſimilar complaints: and though, in the form of diſtilled water and infuſion I was not ſucceſsful, yet the event of the caſes ſubjoined, in which I have given it in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, has made me ample amends. I muſt, however, confeſs, that it's uſe has not been uniformly attended with complete ſucceſs. Having always adviſed extreme caution in it's firſt exhibition, it has required a greater length of time to produce the deſired effects, than the general impatience, which, I apprehend, all medical men have to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat with in their practice, will allow; an impatience continually encreaſed by the bold advertiſers of ſpecifics for the cure of every diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>I have not found that an attempt has at any time been made in this country, to aſcertain, by experiments, the power of the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0648600700:11"/>
               <hi>Toxicodendron,</hi> as a medicine. In France it ſeems to have been made the ſubject of enquiry for ſome time; for Monſieur Fontana, ſpeaks of the many celebrated writers,<note n="†" place="bottom">"Que les Ecrivains les plus celebres ont communément regardé comme un poiſon tres puiſſant, quoique quelques Phyſiciens modernes ne l'aient pas trouvé tel pour certains Ammaux." <hi>Fontana.</hi>
               </note> who have conſidered it as a moſt virulent poiſon. The experiments how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, which he made upon animals, and has related, are not neceſſary to be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced here, ſince I hold all experiments on animals as inſignificant, and irrelevant to the effects of any medicine on the human ſubject. And thoſe made on himſelf go to ſhew merely the manner in which it affected the ſkin, and ſeem to have terrified<note n="*" place="bottom">"Mais jai été forcé d'abandonner, des le com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement mes recherches fur cette plante, parceque j'ai eu le malheur de m' en poiſonner moimeme par trois fois de ſuite, avee ſes feuilles." <hi>Fontana.</hi>

            <p>The lower ſhoots, on and near the ground, in moiſt ſhady ſituations, which the plant moſt affects, trail conſiderably like the <hi>Rhus radicans Linnoei,</hi> (ſmooth rooting Poiſon-Oak or Sumach) and have like that ſhrub, the property of ſending down radicles into the earth, by which the plant admits of great increaſe, in any of the winter months.</p>
            <p>In ſuch ſituations, however, I have not ſeen it produce ſeeds ſo readily, as in drier and more pinching places, where it looſes in a great degree, it's radicating principle, grows more ſtiff and robuſt, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces annual crops of pale yellow ſtriated berries.</p>
            <p>There is a remarkable inſtance of this kind, (the ſingularity of which induces me
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0648600700:17"/>to mention it) now exiſting in a <hi>wall,</hi> in the Phyſic Garden of the Company of Apothecaries at Chelſea, out of a chink in the ſide of which, and near the ground, grows a ſtrong plant of this <hi>Rhus,</hi> that has proſpered there ever ſince the time of the celebrated Miller, and which Mr. Fairbairn, the Company's preſent gardener, obligingly aſſured me, was what Miller called the ſecond ſpecies of <hi>Toxicodendron,</hi> in his Gardener's Dictionary; it is, in all probability, the identical plant from which the deſcription in that well known work was made; it ſeeds annually, but none of it's lower ſhoots exhibit the leaſt radicating propenſity, although other plants of the ſame kind, in the ſhady parts of the ſame garden, have that quality in great perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but I believe they rarely produce ſeeds; ſo much do local circumſtances affect and alter the moſt permanent and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing characters of vegetables.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0648600700:18"/>
            <p>I believe it is pretty generally known to Gardeners, and others concerned in the pleaſant and inſtructive employment of horticulture, that many other fibrous plants, which, like the <hi>Rhus Toxicoden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron,</hi> poſſeſs the power of encreaſing ing themſelves in any conſiderable degree by their roots, have that property material<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leſſened, when the place they grow in happens to be dry and poor, for nature has chiefly allotted them rich and moiſt habitations, and, with her uſual care, conſtructed their conſtitutions accordingly; the alteration ſuch plants undergo, in ſuch a ſoil, is doubtleſs in the direction of their juices, which (being fewer) appear to paſs by the lower and leſs noble parts, (they had before rendered luxuriantly radicant or prolific) and mount upwards by a natural and almoſt inſtinctive impulſe, to feed and mature, with collected force, the infant germs which they had before too ſparingly ſupplied with nouriſhment.</p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0648600700:19"/>
            <p>Thus Nature checked by art or accident, in any cuſtomary channel of renewing her works, kindly ſearches out and perfects another, that ſhe may not be diſappointed in the multiplication of her productions, for

            <p>I am not acquainted with any common plant, that more abundantly exemplifies the above doctrine, than the Lilly of the Valley, <hi>Convallaria majalis Lin.</hi> which is well known to all who poſſeſs a garden, to flower freely, and increaſe amazingly by the root, in a moiſt north border, yet few, I fancy, have ſeen it produce perfect ſeeds in that ſituation, notwithſtanding the vigour of it's growth; but when it is planted and confined in a garden pot, and it's increaſe

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0648600700:21"/>ſhort petioles, which frequently looſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by a kind of dilatation, in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the leafits; the terminal leafit has often a footſtalk half an inch long or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: all the leafits are dull green, have a drooping poſture, and an unpleaſant aſpect, they are oval-angulate and nervoſe, with a kind of undulated margin, which ſometimes forms diſtant tooth-like crena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. The young wood-buds, petioles, and the nerves on the underſides of the leafits, are furniſhed with a very viſible degree of pubeſcence, on which account I have ventured to give the plant the Engliſh name of Pubeſcent Poiſon Oak, or Sumach, for the purpoſe of diſtinguiſhing it from the <hi>Rhus radicans Lin.</hi> which has conſtantly ſmooth leaves and ſhoots.</p>
            <p>The flowers are produced in June, July, and Auguſt, on ſhort, crowded axilleay racemi, which are paniculate, and in a ſtate
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0648600700:22"/>of nature, dioecious. In our ſpecimens, however, (which were cultivated luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant ones, and the only ones which we could procure in a ſtate of fructification) a few of the flowers were hermaphrodite, and had an encreaſed number of parts, particularly, a minute ſix cleft calyx, ſix ſmall lance-oval whitiſh, rather ſtriated, petals; and ſix ſhort ſtamina, ſupporting as many antherae.</p>
            <p>When not rendered unnaturally luxuriant by cultivation, the male flower conſiſts of a minute calyx with five ſhallow clefts, a corolla of five ſmall petals, and five ſtamina which ſupport as many antherae, and the germen in the female flower is roundiſh, and when a little magnified, appears ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what bottle-ſhaped, and ſupports a ſhort ſtylus, which is crowned with three very ſmall ſtigmata.</p>

            <p>The fruit or ſeed arrives at maturity in England about the month of October and November, it is a round, dry, pale-yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſtriated berry, which is ſomewhat ſcarioſe, and nearly the ſize of a ſmall pea, and encloſes one hard compreſſed end-nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed kernel, which has a thick furrowed mealy covering.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Rhus Toxicodendron</hi> is a native of North America, it has been introduced into England ever ſince the year 1640, and was cultivated in this country as a curious ſhrub in the time of Parkinſon, who figures it in his Theatre.<note n="*" place="bottom">See <hi>Parkinſon</hi>'s Theatrum Botanicum and <hi>Aiton's</hi> Hortus Keweenſis.</note>

            <p>A ſhort account of caſes in which it has been employed, will enable the reader to judge of it's power as a medicine.</p>
            <p>The following caſe is inſerted as drawn up by my ingenious friend Mr. B—, an eminent ſurgeon in this neighbourhood, who paid the greateſt attention to the exhibition of the medicine, and has related, in a clear and intereſting manner, the gradual recovery of his own wife.</p>

               <head>CASE I.</head>
               <p>Mrs. B—, aged 38, always enjoyed remarkable good health, till about eight years ago, at which time ſhe complained of a diſorder in her bowels, which ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to feel as if the bowels had loſt their ſenſation, and that a cold wind ſeemed to riſe up the oeſophagus. As ſhe was coſtive, two ounces of the Ol. Ricini were given at four doſes, which having no effect, ſtronger purgatives were admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered, but without producing a ſtool; after
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0648600700:26"/>which the ſmoke of tobacco was thrown up, the warm bath applied, a doſe of calo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel given, and a bliſter put upon the belly. At length an evacuation was obtained; and from the large quantity of cathartic reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies uſed, the bowels now took on the other extreme, and a violent purging enſued.— She now complained of a pricking pain on the right ſide of the abdomen, which went off upon her voiding by ſtool a piece of a large plumb ſtone, one ſide of which was worn as ſharp as the edge of a knife. After this ſhe was frequently troubled with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate conſtipations of the bowels, and obliged to have recourſe to purgative me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines. In the year 1789, ſhe had two fits, which, I believe, were epileptic; but, as I happened not to ſee her in either of them, I cannot be certain. In the month of September, ſhe was ſeized with pains in her hands and feet, which were ſuppoſed to be gouty; and when theſe went off, ſhe
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0648600700:27"/>loſt entirely the uſe of the extenſor muſcles of the wriſts, and ſoon after thoſe of the feet, which was followed by the loſs of the extenſors of the fingers and toes. A tumour now aroſe upon the metacarpal bones of each hand, which ſeemed a ſwelling either of the pcrioſteum or bone itſelf, and had greatly the appearance of a ſcrophulous affection, The tumours ſeemed ſometimes likely to ſuppurate, but about the end of the year 1790, they gradually diſappeared. The hands now looked livid, and the exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor muſcles upon the arms and hands waſted and ſhrivelled; her feet felt like logs of wood, and the fingers and toes were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from the action of the flexor muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; ſhe could not walk without help, and when ſhe attempted it, always com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of ſomething drawing her back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. During this time, ſhe took a variety of volatile, cardiac, and tonic medicines, but without any good effect. In the month
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0648600700:28"/>of September, 1791, Dr. ALDERSON was conſulted, and adviſed her to take the TOXICODENDRON. Six grains of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered leaves of that plant were infuſed in eight ounces of boiling water, a table ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be given three times a day. The whole of this was taken without any ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble effect, except a ſlight pricking ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the feet and hands:</p>
               <p>Oct. 3d, She took one fourth of a grain of the powdered leaves made into a bolus with Conſ. Cort. Aurant. twice a day.</p>
               <p>4th, The ſame; the pricking ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion continues, and the arms, to the ends of the fingers, feel as if warm water was running-down them.</p>
               <p>5th, Medicines continued three times a day.</p>
               <p>6th, The ſame. In the evening, had an
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0648600700:29"/>irregular ſpaſmodic fluttering in the toes.</p>
               <p>Oct. 7th, Medicines continued. Was agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſurpriſed to find ſhe could extend her fingers and toes a little. Her hands a little ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and her feet and ancles much more ſo. She has, in a great meaſure, recovered the uſe of the extenſor pollicis of the right hand, and that of the left in a ſmaller degree; has alſo loſt the dead hard ſenſation in her finger ends, which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways her conſtant attendant.</p>
               <p>8th, Medicines continued.</p>
               <p>9th, One third of a grain ter die.</p>
               <p>10th, The ſame. Walked up ſtairs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out help, her hands alſo ſtronger and better, but the extenſors of the wriſts ſtill inactive.</p>
               <p>11th, The ſame.</p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:0648600700:30"/>
               <p>Oct. 12th, Took half a grain ter die. Begins to walk tolerably well, and can uſe her hands better, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſor, adductor, and abductor muſcles of the thumbs, having recovered their action.</p>
               <p>15th, Three grains were made into four boluſes, and one taken three times a day. At night the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, as if hot water was run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning down the arms, very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome, with the pricking feel in the fingers.</p>
               <p>17th, One grain ter die.</p>
               <p>30th, Takes one grain and a half ter die; and this day perceived that ſhe had recovered the uſe of the extenſor muſcles of the wriſts.</p>
               <p>She continued the medicine, gradually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing the doſe to four grains ter die, for ſome time longer. It ſeemed to act as a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0648600700:31"/>gentle aperient, and frequently, when the large doſes were taken, occaſioned a ſlight vertigo, with a pain acroſs the forehead, and a nauſea for about half an hour after taking it. She has now left off the medicine twelve months, has entirely recovered the uſe of her hands, and walks a mile or two very well; but the muſcles of the feet are not ſo well recovered as thoſe of the hands, and ſhe always lifts the feet very high when ſhe walks; which may be owing to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance that in her former ſtate, if ſhe attempted walking, and met with the ſmalleſt obſtacle, a fall on the face was generally the conſequence.</p>

               <p>The doſe was gradually increaſed to three grains four times a day, and he has now taken it for three months.
