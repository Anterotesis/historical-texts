            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE LAW OF LIBERTY, OR, ROYAL LAW.</head>
            <p>IN two former Tracts I have attempted to deſcribe the JUST LIMITATION OF SLAVERY IN THE LAWS OF GOD, and THE LAW OF PASSIVE OBEDIENCE, with reſpect more particularly to the due SUBMISSION of <hi>Chriſtian Servants</hi> or <hi>Slaves</hi> to their <hi>Maſters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The purpoſe of the preſent Tract is not only to point out the reciprocal duty of <hi>Chriſtian Maſters</hi> to their <hi>Servants,</hi> and all other perſons with whom they are connected, but alſo more particularly
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1083401400:4"/>to enable our <hi>Britiſh American</hi> Slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders to examine or <hi>meaſure</hi> (with very little trouble) by <hi>the Rule</hi> of God's Holy Word, <hi>the Legality</hi> or <hi>Illegality of Slavery among Chriſtians.</hi> For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſome of the cleareſt and moſt eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial <hi>Maxims</hi> or <hi>Principles</hi> of Scripture are ſelected and compared with each other in the following pages.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>So ſpeak ye, and ſo do, as they that ſhall be</hi> JUDGED <hi>by</hi> THE LAW OF LIBERTY.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This the earneſt advice of the Apoſtle James in his General Epiſtle; (ii. 12.) and as it is therefore manifeſt that we ſhall certainly BE JUDGED by <q>THE LAW OF LIBERTY,</q> it becomes a buſineſs of the utmoſt importance to aſcertain what particular Law is thereby to be underſtood, that we may <hi>write it on our hearts,</hi> ſince our everlaſting hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1083401400:5"/>depends upon it, and the peril of eternal damnation ſeems to attend a breach of it; <q>
                  <hi>for he ſhall have</hi> JUDG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT WITHOUT MERCY</q> (ſays the Apoſtle in the following verſe) <q>
                  <hi>who hath ſhewed</hi> NO MERCY!</q> The ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary premiſes for the examination of the queſtion are nothing leſs than the fundamental moral Principles of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity; and if I am rather prolix in defining them, I hope <hi>the importance of the ſubject</hi> will be conſidered as a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient excuſe; for indeed <hi>the ſubject</hi> is not only <hi>important</hi> to thoſe perſons for whoſe uſe this Tract is particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended (<hi>I mean thoſe perſons who deſire to be ſatisfied concerning</hi> THE LEGALITY <hi>or</hi> ILLEGALITY OF SLAVERY AMONG CHRISTIANS) but to all Mankind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides of every rank and denomination.</p>
            <p>All the moral duties of the Goſpel are briefly comprehended in <hi>two ſingle
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1083401400:6"/>Principles</hi> of the Law of Moſes, viz. THE LOVE OF GOD, and THE LOVE OF OUR NEIGHBOUR. Nothing, therefore, can be eſteemed truly <hi>lawful</hi> under the Goſpel, that is, in the leaſt, repugnant to either of theſe; and we need never be at a loſs to diſtinguiſh what is, or what is not ſo, if we will but carefully conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the proportion or degree of <hi>that Love,</hi> which is clearly expreſſed to be <hi>due,</hi> both to <hi>God</hi> and our <hi>Neighbour</hi> in theſe two comprehenſive and eternal maxims. The degree of <hi>Love due to God</hi> exceeds all compariſon or conſideration of other things; for it muſt (ſays the text) be "<hi>with</hi> ALL <hi>thy heart, and with</hi> 
               <q>ALL <hi>thy ſoul, and with</hi> ALL <hi>thy might.</hi>
               </q> (Deut. vi. 5.) which neceſſarily implies a moſt fervent zeal for the glory of GOD, far exceeding all worldly conſiderations. And with reſpect to the degree or true proportion of <hi>Love due to our Neighbour,</hi> we have no pretence to plead ignorance,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1083401400:7"/>ſince the appointed <hi>meaſure</hi> of it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in <hi>every Man's Breaſt</hi>—<q>THOU SHALT LOVE THY NEIGHBOUR AS THYSELF.</q> (Lev. xix. 18.) <q>
                  <hi>On theſe two Commandments</hi>
               </q> (ſaid the Eternal Judge) <q>
                  <hi>hang</hi> ALL THE LAW <hi>and</hi> THE PROPHETS.</q> (Mat. 22.40.) The ſame Eternal Judge of Mankind made alſo, on another occaſion, a ſimilar declaration concerning the <hi>Sum or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendium</hi> 
               <q>OF THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS</q>—<q>
                  <hi>All things whatſoever ye would that Men ſhould do to you</hi>
               </q> (ſaid he) <q>
                  <hi>do ye even ſo to them; for this is</hi> THE LAW AND THE PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHETS.</q> (Matth. vii. 12.) This moſt excellent rule of conduct and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour towards <hi>our Neighbours,</hi> which includes the whole Subſtance or Spirit of "THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS," ſo perfectly correſponds with the ſecond great Commandment, to LOVE <hi>our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours as ourſelves</hi> (viz. to manifeſt our
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1083401400:8"/>LOVE, <hi>by</hi> DOING <hi>to them, as we ourſelves might</hi> WITH REASON AND JUSTICE <hi>expect and deſire</hi> THEY WOULD DO UNTO US) that it ſeems intended like a ſort of paraphraſe to explain the true tenour of it; for though the mode of expreſſion is different, yet the effect of the doctrine is undoubtedly the ſame; becauſe the Apoſtle Paul has in like manner declared this ſecond great Commandment to be <hi>the Compendium of "all the Law."</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>All the Law</hi>
               </q> (ſays he) <q>
                  <hi>is fulfilled in one word, even in this: Thou ſhalt</hi> LOVE <hi>thy Neighbour</hi> AS THYSELF.</q> (Gal. v. 14.</p>
            <p>SELF-LOVE, therefore, muſt be the RULE or MEASURE (not of Self-grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, or private Intereſt, but) <hi>of our Conduct and Behaviour towards other Men!</hi> It muſt not be SOLE TENANT of the heart; but is always to leave <hi>equal</hi> room for a due balance of <hi>that Love which we

This plain declaration of our duty (<gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, &amp;c. "WE OUGHT <hi>to lay down our Lives,</hi>" &amp;c.) ſufficiently enables us to account for the many extraordinary examples of SELF-LOVE <hi>being ſuperſeded by more noble Principles,</hi> ſome of which I have cited in my Tract on <hi>the Law of Nature, and Principles of Action in Man,</hi> p. 79—105, to which alſo the following may be added.</p>
                     <p>THE GRATITUDE of the <hi>Galatians</hi> to their Teacher <hi>Paul,</hi> is expreſſed by that Apoſtle in the ſtrongeſt terms—<q>
                           <hi>I bear you record</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that if it had been poſſible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.</hi>
                        </q> Gal. iv. 15.</p>
                     <p>Not inferior to this was the LOVE of that ſame Apoſtle himſelf towards <hi>the Corinthians,</hi> though they were ſo far from returning a <hi>mutual affection</hi> like <hi>the Galatians,</hi> that the Apoſtle, it ſeems, had reaſon to complain of their INGRATITUDE—<q>
                           <hi>I will very gladly</hi> SPEND, AND BE SPENT <hi>for you</hi> (literally <hi>"for your Souls,"</hi> ſaid he) <hi>though the more abundantly I</hi> LOVE <hi>you, the leſs I be</hi> LOVED.</q> 2 Cor. xii. 15.</p>
                     <p>To "SPEND, AND BE SPENT" for others, and that <hi>"very gladly!"</hi> is the ſtrongeſt expreſſion of <hi>diſintereſted</hi> LOVE that could have been choſen! It implies a chearful ſacrifice of every thing that is dear in this world (LIFE ITSELF NOT EXCEPTED!) <q>
                           <hi>and greater Love hath no Man than this, that a Man lay down his Life for his friends.</hi>
                        </q> John xv. 13. So that, as <hi>no Man can have greater Love than this,</hi> we may certainly eſteem it the higheſt demonſtration of <hi>"perfect Love;"</hi> and as the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence laſt quoted from the Apoſtle John relates, in its pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary application, to the voluntary ſacrifice which Chriſt made of himſelf to ſave Mankind, it leads us to the true foundation of that <hi>"perfect Love"</hi> enjoined in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which (as the preceding examples demonſtrate) does occaſionally overcome the general Principle of <q>
                           <hi>Self-love,</hi>
                        </q> and every other <hi>intereſted</hi> Motive natural to "MAN!</p>
                     <p>The Apoſtle John informs us, no leſs than <hi>twice</hi> in <hi>one</hi> chapter, that "GOD IS LOVE!" (<gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>This information is introduced in an argument, whereby the Apoſtle endeavours to inculcate a due ſenſe of the neceſſity we are laid under, <hi>to love one another,</hi> becauſe GOD hath firſt <hi>loved us:</hi> ſo that GRATITUDE TO GOD muſt be the foundation of our <hi>"Love to one another;"</hi> and we are therefore bound to imitate (and will certainly endeavour to imitate, if "GOD DWELLETH IN US."

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1083401400:13"/>as that of <hi>laying down our Lives for the Brethren,</hi> can only be required of us on
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1083401400:14"/>very extraordinary occaſions, as in times of perſecution, or on other ſuch preſſing emergencies, when ſome very ſingular Good or Benefit to our <hi>Friends,</hi> our <hi>Country,</hi> or <hi>Mankind in general,</hi> appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently depends upon our perſeverance <hi>unto death</hi> for their ſakes, in a juſt cauſe <hi>to the Glory of God;</hi> or to the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his revealed <hi>Truth,</hi> for their confirmation and example!

PATRIOTISM) by the eternal Rules of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1083401400:15"/>natural Equity and Juſtice. But though a chearful obedience in this ultimate Duty of <hi>laying down our Lives,</hi> and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing <hi>Self-love,</hi> and every temporal Bleſſing <hi>for the Good of others,</hi> does un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly exalt HUMAN NATURE to the higheſt pitch of <hi>Heroiſm</hi> and <hi>real Dignity,</hi> let us all, nevertheleſs, pray God (as in effect we do by that compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive expreſſion in our daily prayers— <hi>"Lead us not into temptation"</hi>) to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve us from any ſuch ſevere trials of our Obedience and LOVE to him as the neceſſity of of <q>

            <p>The OMISSION of an Act of <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Benevolence</hi> towards our Neighbour, when it is in our power, and occaſion requires it, <hi>is declared by our Lord, the Saviour of the World,</hi> to be as groſs an affront, <hi>even to himſelf,</hi> as if <hi>he</hi> had been
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1083401400:17"/>
               <hi>perſonally</hi> neglected and denied by us! <q>
                  <hi>Inaſmuch</hi> (ſays he) <hi>as ye did it not to one of the leaſt of theſe,</hi> YE DID IT NOT TO ME.</q> Matt. xxv. 45. And if SINS of OMISSION, even towards <hi>the meaneſt of our Brethren,</hi> are by OUR LORD eſteemed as a <hi>perſonal Affront to himſelf,</hi> we may be aſſured, that the actual COMMISSION of Injuries will be infinitely more heinous in his ſight, and cannot eſcape his juſt Vengeance. We muſt remember alſo, that <hi>this Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of our Lord will be made to thoſe miſerable wretches, who ſhall ſtand <q>
                  <hi>on the Left Hand,</hi>
               </q> after the tremendous final ſentence is paſſed upon them! <q>
                  <hi>Depart from me ye Curſed, into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels!</hi>
               </q> See verſe 41.</p>
            <p>It is manifeſt therefore, that <hi>a Viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of</hi> THE LOVE THAT IS DUE TO OUR NEIGHBOUR, is a Violation alſo of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1083401400:18"/>THE LOVE OF GOD; and, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, <hi>the latter is perfected</hi> by a ſtrict obedience <hi>to the former—"If we</hi> LOVE <hi>one another</hi>" (ſays <hi>the beloved</hi> Apoſtle) <q>
                  <hi>God dwelleth in us, and</hi> HIS LOVE IS PERFECTED IN US.</q> (1 John iv. 12.) So that the two great Commandments appear to be reciprocally included and blended together in their conſequences; by which we may more readily perceive the propriety of our Lord's declaration, that the <hi>ſecond great Commandment is like unto the firſt</hi>
               <note n="3" place="bottom">(3) <q>
                     <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all thy mind. This is the firſt and great Commandment.</hi> AND THE SECOND IS LIKE UNTO IT, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as thyſelf. On theſe two Commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.</hi>
                  </q> (Matt. xxii. 37. to 40.)</note>; and this reciprocal connexion between them enables us alſo to comprehend the reaſon why <hi>the ſecond</hi> is given <hi>alone</hi> (when BOTH are undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly neceſſary) as the grand teſt of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian obedience, and as the ſum and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1083401400:19"/>of the whole Law of God. <q>
                  <hi>For all the Law is fulfilled</hi>
               </q> (ſays the Apoſtle Paul) <q>
                  <hi>in one word,</hi> (even) <hi>in this, Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thyſelf.</hi>
               </q> (Gal. v. 14.)</p>
            <p>Now a continued multiplication of Statutes (as in England, where the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber exceeds the capacity of the human Memory) affords matter only for <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, Doubt,</hi> and <hi>Evaſion,</hi> whereby SOUND LAW is vitiated and corrupted; and the loathſome <hi>Proſtitute,</hi> ſtill retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the Name of</hi> LAW, <hi>ariſes</hi> (like the Harlot POPERY from pure CHRISTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ANITY) <hi>in another Dreſs!</hi> She is clothed with the many-coloured garment of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtruction, and ſeats herſelf at the right hand of the unjuſt judge, prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with wily Subterfuges, and <hi>bad Precedents</hi> inſtead of LAW; whereby he is enabled to enſnare the innocent, and ſcreen the guilty. But, on the other hand, when we conſider that "ALL LAW" is
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1083401400:20"/>reduced to ſo ſmall a compaſs, that it may be accounted, comparatively, as ONE WORD, there is no room left for offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to plead <hi>Ignorance,</hi> as an excuſe for having violated the general Laws of Morality, and the <hi>natural Rights of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</hi> Let me therefore exhort my op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents, as they regard their own eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal welfare, to take this ſubject into their moſt ſerious conſideration, and no longer refuſe to acknowledge this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious WORD or <hi>Maxim,</hi> as the TRUE MEASURE (except a ſtill greater meaſure of LOVE is required

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1083401400:21"/>Men;</hi> for Tyrants, Slaveholders, Extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners, and other Oppreſſors, would moſt certainly diſlike to be treated as as they treat others; ſo that this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious Law neceſſarily excludes <hi>the leaſt Toleration of Slavery,</hi> or of any other <hi>Oppreſſion,</hi> which an <hi>innocent Man</hi>
               <note n="5" place="bottom">(5) On the other hand, <hi>notorious offenders,</hi> that are clearly convicted of their crimes by the laws of the land, may, conſiſtently <hi>with reaſon and juſtice,</hi> be puniſhed with a temporary DEPRIVATION OF LIBERTY, provided they be not <hi>ſold to ſtrangers,</hi> nor even to <hi>their own country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> to be ſubjected to <hi>private dominion,</hi> or the <hi>abſolute rule of individuals,</hi> which is dreadfully baneful to mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity! The community at large (and <hi>that community only whoſe Laws they have broken</hi>) can alone have any RIGHT to detain them in <hi>bondage;</hi> and this RIGHT of detaining ſhould be moderated by ſuch wholeſome regulations for the religious <hi>inſtruction,</hi> as well as <hi>employment,</hi> of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy convicts, as ſhould apparently tend more to their <hi>reformation,</hi> (to render them worthy of being ſpeedily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to <hi>Liberty</hi>) than to any other object; and no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whatſoever ſhould be entruſted with the care, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, or employment of ſuch <hi>public delinquents,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being ſubject to the inſpection and <hi>legal</hi> controul of the king's judges, and of other regular <hi>crown officers</hi> of the <hi>Law department</hi> (but of no other <hi>crown officers</hi> as ſuch whatever) as alſo of the county courts of aſſizes and ſeſſions, courts of inqueſt, grand juries, juſtices of the peace, ſheriffs, and of ſuch other <hi>legal</hi> guardians of the public peace, for and in behalf of the public, leſt the cauſe of <hi>liberty</hi> ſhould ſuffer by the influence of any innovation in that reſpect.</note> would be unwilling to experience in his own perſon from another.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:1083401400:22"/>We muſt therefore acknowledge this heavenly maxim to be the true ſtandard, not only of <hi>mutual Benevolence</hi> among MEN, but alſo, of <hi>our Love and Duty</hi> to GOD; ſince it includes the firſt great Commandment, by <q>

This "LAW OF LIBERTY," this SUPREAM, this "ROYAL LAW," muſt therefore be our guide in the interpretation and examination of all Laws which relate <hi>to the Rights of Perſons,</hi> becauſe it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes <hi>Partiality,</hi> or <hi>Reſpect of Perſons,</hi> and conſequently removes all ground for the pretence of any <hi>abſolute Right of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion inherent in the Maſters</hi> over their Slaves: for as all Ranks of Men are EQUAL <hi>in the Sight of God</hi> (the Chriſtian <hi>Slave,</hi> or Servant, being <hi>the Freeman</hi> of the Lord, and the Chriſtian <hi>Maſter</hi> the <hi>Servant</hi> of Chriſt, 1 Cor. vii. 22.) there is no doubt but that the ſame <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Qualities are neceſſary to be maintained by the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> MASTER, that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> SERVANT; as <hi>Humility, Forgiveneſs of Treſpaſſes</hi> or <hi>Debts, and</hi> (though not <hi>Submiſſion,</hi> yet certainly) <hi>Brotherly Love towards Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors,</hi> with <hi>unfeigned Charity</hi> and <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1083401400:30"/>Benevolence,</hi> founded on the glorious Maxim, or <hi>Royal Law,</hi> 
               <q>THOU SHALT LOVE THY NEIGHBOUR AS THY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SELF.</q> All which are as indiſpenſably neceſſary to form the diſpoſition of a <hi>true Chriſtian Maſter,</hi> as they are abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely incompatible with the oppreſſive and tyrannical Claims of our American Slaveholders! <q>
                  <hi>Quod tibi fieri non vis, alteri ne feceris. What thou wouldeſt not have done to thee, do not thou to another,</hi>
               </q>—was the favourite Maxim of the Emperor <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Report of <hi>Lampridius</hi> quoted by the learned Joſ. Mede, Book 3. p. 550. This Principle was probably deduced from "THE ROYAL LAW," "or LAW OF LIBERTY;" for <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pridius</hi> relates, that the Emperor heard it either from ſome Jews or Chriſtians: (<q>
                  <hi>Quod à quibuſdam ſive Judoeis ſive Chriſtianis audierat, et tenebat,</hi>
               </q> &amp;c.)
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1083401400:31"/>and it cannot be denied, that the doctrine of it is neceſſarily included in that great and indiſpenſable Commandment. The doctrine was expreſſed even by Chriſt himſelf nearly to the ſame effect, which I have already quoted:—<q>
                  <hi>All things whatſoever ye would that Men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them:</hi> FOR THIS IS THE LAW <hi>and</hi> THE PROPHETS.</q> (Mat. vii. 12.) So that Slavery is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely inconſiſtent with Chriſtianity, becauſe we cannot ſay of any <hi>Slaveholder,</hi> that he <hi>doth not</hi> to another, what he would not have done to himſelf! For he is continually exacting <hi>involuntary Labour</hi> from others <hi>without Wages,</hi> which he would think monſtrouſly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, were he himſelf the Sufferer! Nay, many of them are ſo beſotted with Avarice, that they are not content with reaping <hi>the whole Fruit of other Men's Labour upon Earth</hi> WITHOUT
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1083401400:32"/>WAGES
<note n="3" place="bottom">(3) <q>
                     <hi>Woe unto him that buildeth his Houſe by Unright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs, and his Chambers by Wrong; that</hi> USETH HIS NEIGHBOUR'S SERVICE WITHOUT WAGES, AND GIVETH HIM NOT FOR HIS WORK.</q> Jer. xxii. 13.</note>; but would deprive their poor Labourers even of their <hi>eternal Comfort,</hi> if they could exact a little more Work from them, by reducing them nearer to the State of Brutes!— What I advance cannot be denied; for it is notorious, that <hi>many Maſters</hi> oppoſe the inſtruction of their <hi>Slaves</hi> in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Knowledge; and <hi>but very few</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote it as they ought; ſo that the Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the ignorant Slave muſt reſt <hi>with double Weight</hi> on the guilty head of the owner, to fill up the meaſure of his ſins!</p>
            <p>Suppoſe a reverſe of fortune—that an Engliſh or Scotch <hi>Slaveholder,</hi> or <hi>Slavedealer,</hi> is ſhipwrecked on the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary Coaſt, and is retained, <hi>as a Slave,</hi> by the Moors, who ſeize him; or is <hi>ſold, as ſuch,</hi> to another Perſon, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1083401400:33"/>to the deteſtable cuſtoms of that Savage people!—Would he eſteem him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the <hi>lawful Property</hi> of his tawney Maſter, becauſe the wretched police of thoſe Barbarians, <hi>in tolerating Slavery,</hi> is ſimilar to his own former practices as an <hi>American Slaveholder,</hi> or <hi>African Trader?</hi> Would he not think it cruel treatment to be eſteemed <hi>a mere Chattel;</hi> and, as ſuch, to be ranked with the horſes and oxen of his African Maſter? <hi>Like them,</hi> to be compelled by ſtripes to perform the moſt ſervile and abject Labour? <hi>Like them,</hi> to receive <hi>no Wages,</hi> or other <hi>Reward</hi> for his Service, except a little <hi>coarſe Provender,</hi> merely to keep him in working Order for his Maſter's Benefit? Would he not think himſelf grievouſly injured by being forcibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and prevented from working for himſelf? And would he not think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf abſolutely <hi>robbed of the Fruits of his own Labour?</hi> He would certainly have
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1083401400:34"/>ample reaſon to lament the Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's Ignorance of the heavenly Precept, "THOU SHALT LOVE THY NEIGH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BOUR AS THYSELF; for he would then be taught, by his own Sufferings, to comprehend the full force, extent, and and meaning of that benevolent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, which, in his proſperity, he was never <hi>willing</hi> to underſtand, though the doctrine is ſo plain and obvious, that there can be no excuſe for miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it; for unleſs the Slaveholder can make it appear, <hi>that his</hi> SLAVE <hi>is not his</hi> NEIGHBOUR, he muſt neceſſarily acknowledge <hi>this</hi> "LAW OF LIBERTY" to be <hi>the true Meaſure</hi> of his conduct and behaviour <hi>towards his</hi> SLAVE, as well as <hi>towards all other</hi> MEN!</p>
            <p>Let not <hi>Slaveholders</hi> or <hi>African Traders</hi> conceive, that they are at liberty to receive or reject this glorious Precept, according as it may ſuit their intereſt
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1083401400:35"/>or convenience! But rather let them carefully examine (for they are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly intereſted in the determination of the queſtion) whether obedience to the doctrine of the great <q>LAW OF LIBER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY,</q> is not abſolutely indiſpenſable? And whether the violation of it is not dangerous to ſalvation?</p>
            <p>If they think there is any room to flatter themſelves, that they do not offend God by tolerating Slavery among them, let them but examine their Actions by this "ROYAL LAW," and they will clearly perceive both their <hi>Guilt and Danger, unleſs they have Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences ſeared with a hot Iron!"</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>"If ye have reſpect unto Perſons"</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle James, when he enforces the Obſervation of the ROYAL LAW) <q>
                  <hi>ye commit Sin, and are convinced of</hi> THE LAW AS TRANSGRESSORS,</q> &amp;c. ii. 9.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1083401400:36"/>Now this Offence of <q>
                  <hi>having Reſpect unto Perſons,</hi>
               </q> is a mark which ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly characterizes <hi>Slaveholders</hi> as Violaters of "THE ROYAL LAW."</p>
            <p>They are courteous, friendly, and hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitable enough, in general, to Perſons <hi>of their own Rank,</hi> as, indeed, they ought to be; but, at the ſame time, they look down upon their <hi>Slaves</hi> (who are <hi>equally their Brethren</hi>) as if they were <hi>not Human Beings,</hi> and rank them as <hi>mere Chattels</hi> with their Horſes and Dogs; ſo that there needs no Argument to prove them guilty of <q>
                  <hi>having Reſpect unto Perſons</hi>
               </q> in a moſt notorious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, whereby they ſurely <hi>"commit Sin,"</hi> and are <q>
                  <hi>convinced of the Law as Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors.</hi>
               </q> What therefore have ſuch Men to expect, when they ſhall be judged by "THE LAW OF LIBERTY!" eſpecially as the Apoſtle adds, <q>

               </q> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And even our Lord himſelf has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the very ſame doctrine, though in different Words—<q>
                  <hi>With the ſame</hi> MEASURE <hi>that ye</hi> METE</q> (ſays he) "<hi>ſhall it be</hi> MEASURED <hi>unto you again.</hi>" <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>What MEASURE of <hi>Benevolence,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, have theſe Men to expect, who endeavour to enrich THEMSELVES by <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaving</hi> and <hi>oppreſſing</hi> their BRETHREN? For Men, who, <hi>"without Mercy,"</hi> or Fellow-feeling, have violated <q>THE ROYAL LAW OF LIBERTY,</q> can neither be ſaid to <hi>love God,</hi> nor <hi>their Neighbour,</hi> as directed in the two great Commandments, and conſequently are Violaters of <hi>"the whole Law;"</hi> by which they abſolutely deprive themſelves of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1083401400:38"/>the Benefit of Chriſt's Redemption! This ſeems to be the neceſſary meaning of that dreadful Doom before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; <q>
                  <hi>He ſhall have</hi> JUDGMENT <hi>without</hi> MERCY, that <hi>hath ſhewed</hi> NO MERCY.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But let no Man conceive, that I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to charge Individuals, or <hi>any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in particular,</hi> with the want of this MERCY, ſo neceſſary to Salvation, even though they are apparently guilty of that oppreſſive treatment of their <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> which I now oppoſe; for this would ſeem like ſetting bounds to the <hi>Mency of God,</hi> whereby I ſhould be liable to involve myſelf, as an <hi>uncharitable Judge,</hi> in the ſame condemnation. And there are, certainly, a variety of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, beyond the reach of human knowledge, that may extenuate the guilt of <hi>particular Perſons,</hi> of which the great Searcher of Hearts alone can judge!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:1083401400:39"/>It is not, therefore, <hi>the Perſons,</hi> but <hi>the uncharitable Practices</hi> of Slaveholders and Slavedealers, that I now venture <hi>to condemn;</hi> and theſe I can with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence affirm to be really <hi>damnable,</hi> or <hi>dangerous to Salvation,</hi> as being the moſt notorious violations of that Chriſtian Charity, or LOVE OF OUR NEIGHBOUR, which God indiſpenſably requires of us, and without which, the higheſt Gifts are vain, and even <hi>Faith itſelf!</hi> For, <hi>tho' I have</hi> "ALL FAITH" (ſaid the Apoſtle Paul) <q>

               </q> 1 Cor. xiii. 2. The nature of this indiſpenſable CHARITY is more particularly deſcribed by the ſame Apoſtle under the appellation of LOVE (<gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1083401400:41"/>is the touchſtone or proof of <hi>that ſaving</hi> LOVE, which is THE FULFILL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING OF THE LAW, and without which "FAITH IS DEAD," as declared by <hi>the Apoſtle Paul;</hi> that it is alſo "THE ROYAL LAW," being thus eminently diſtinguiſhed from all other Precepts of the Goſpel, by the <hi>Apoſtle James;</hi> and if it <hi>is not</hi> alſo particularly ſignified (though I am fully convinced that it <hi>is</hi>) under the Title of <q>THE LAW OF LIBERTY,</q> by the <hi>ſame Apoſtle,</hi> in his 2d Chapter; yet it is ſurely one of the moſt eſſential and comprehenſive Principles of that "LAW OF LIBERTY," by which <hi>we ſhall all be judged;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Apoſtle at the ſame time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, that "<hi>he ſhall have Judgment</hi> WITHOUT MERCY, <hi>who hath ſhewed</hi> NO MERCY;" (chap. ii. 13.) by which he manifeſtly refers to the Breach of that particular Precept, which ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate the Conduct of all Mankind to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:1083401400:42"/>each other; and therefore, laſtly, we muſt acknowledge this ſame Precept to be alſo THE TRUE MEASURE or Teſt on which our eternal Doom will depend in that awful Day, when it <q>

                  <hi>Inaſmuch as ye have done it unto one of the leaſt of theſe my Brethren, ye have</hi> DONE IT UNTO ME!</q> (Mat. xxv. 40.)</p>
            <p>This Sentence, indeed, is applied in the Text to thoſe who ſhall have DONE GOOD to their Brethren; yet by neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Conſequence it is equally applicable (as in the 45th verſe) to thoſe who have neglected, or ſhewn them <hi>no Brotherly</hi> LOVE and CHARITY!—"<hi>Inaſmuch</hi> (ſaid our Lord) <q>
