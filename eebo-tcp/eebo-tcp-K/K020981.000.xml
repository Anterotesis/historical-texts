            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>FAR be from the author the preſumption of affixing to this trifle any thing ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable as YOUR Name. What impudence to have ventured to place it, where he has a ſcruple to ſuffer one of ſo little importance
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0783300500:3"/>
as his own to make its appearance! But the character of Writer, which the late ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme abuſe of that talent has not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to illuſtrate, does not invite power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully enough to the producing one's ſelf pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly in that light to the Public.</p>
            <p>The ſole view of the author in the liberty he is now riſking, is only by way of appeal to YOU, MADAM, whether the character of complete domeſtic virtue, attempted in that of <hi>Philodamus,</hi> has been faithfully copied from nature. Of this, MADAM, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, any one can be ſo good a judge as YOURSELF, who have conſtantly before YOUR eyes the moſt perfect example of it, that, perhaps, ever actually exiſted: an example,
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0783300500:4"/>
whoſe luſtre ſtill to increaſe, YOU are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, MADAM, to ſuffer YOUR own great and amiable qualities, which in any other part of the world would have burſt out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivalled, to rank, in this, but in the ſecond place. The loſs is compenſated in the great ſhare it is allowed, MADAM, YOU have in the very virtues to which YOU yield the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence. They are ſuch, that had they been exerciſed only within the walls of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate family, they could not have failed of winning their way abroad into the general eſteem of mankind. What univerſal adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt they then command, when it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than the moſt extended dominion upon the globe, which, in reality, proves to be this vaſt family, under the moſt vigilant
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0783300500:5"/>
and indulgent of parents; and receives to its utmoſt boundary the effects of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly tenderneſs and benevolence, which ſeem to have been firſt put in practice in their more immediate connections, in order to learn from experience how they might afterwards be beſt applied, and diffuſed, to the moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant!</p>
            <p>If, in return, MADAM, our prayers to Heaven are but ſhort, it proceeds from no deficiency in our gratitude; we think we have fulfilled every dictate of duty and love, when we have ardently petitioned, that YOU, MADAM, may long continue to ſhare, adorn, and reward, all the virtues that can render human nature amiable and reſpectable.</p>

                  <l>To draw up our complaint againſt this Verres,</l>
